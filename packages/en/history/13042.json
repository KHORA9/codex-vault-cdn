CONKEY COMPANY\r\n\r\nPUBLISHERS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nKNICKERBOCKER'S HISTORY OF NEW YORK is the book, published in December,\r\n1809, with which Washington Irving, at the age of twenty-six, first won\r\nwide credit and influence. Walter Scott wrote to an American friend, who\r\nsent him the second edition----\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"I beg you to accept my best thanks for the uncommon degree of\r\n    entertainment which I have received from the most excellently\r\n    jocose History of New York. I am sensible that, as a stranger to\r\n    American parties and politics, I must lose much of the concealed\r\n    satire of the piece, but I must own that, looking at the simple\r\n    and obvious meaning only, I have never read anything so closely\r\n    resembling the style of Dean Swift as the annals of Diedrich\r\n    Knickerbocker. I have been employed these few evenings in reading\r\n    them aloud to Mrs. S. and two ladies who are our guests, and our\r\n    sides have been absolutely sore with laughing. I think, too,\r\n    there are passages which indicate that the author possesses\r\n    powers of a different kind, and has some touches which remind me\r\n    much of Sterne.\"\r\n\r\nWashington Irving was the son of William Irving, a sturdy native of the\r\nOrkneys, allied to the Irvines of Drum, among whose kindred was an old\r\nhistoriographer who said to them, \"Some of the foolish write themselves\r\nIrving.\" William Irving of Shapinsha, in the Orkney Islands, was a petty\r\nofficer on board an armed packet ship in His Majesty's service, when he\r\nmet with his fate at Falmouth in Sarah Sanders, whom he married at\r\nFalmouth in May, 1761. Their first child was buried in England before\r\nJuly, 1763, when peace had been concluded, and William Irving emigrated to\r\nNew York with his wife, soon to be joined by his wife's parents.\r\n\r\nAt New York William Irving entered into trade, and prospered fairly until\r\nthe outbreak of the American Revolution. His sympathy, and that of his\r\nwife, went with the colonists. On the 19th of October, 1781, Lord\r\nCornwallis, with a force of seven thousand men, surrendered at Yorktown.\r\nIn October, 1782, Holland acknowledged the independence of the United\r\nStates in a treaty concluded at The Hague. In January, 1783, an armistice\r\nwas concluded with Great Britain. In February, 1783, the independence of\r\nthe United States was acknowledged by Sweden and by Denmark, and in March\r\nby Spain. On the 3rd of April in that year an eleventh child was born to\r\nWilliam and Sarah Irving, who was named Washington, after the hero under\r\nwhom the war had been brought to an end. In 1783 the peace was signed, New\r\nYork was evacuated, and the independence of the United States acknowledged\r\nby England.\r\n\r\nOf the eleven children eight survived. William Irving, the father, was\r\nrigidly pious, a just and honorable man, who made religion burdensome to\r\nhis children by associating it too much with restrictions and denials. One\r\nof their two weekly half-holidays was devoted to the Catechism. The\r\nmother's gentler sensibility and womanly impulses gave her the greater\r\ninfluence; but she reverenced and loved her good husband, and when her\r\nyoungest puzzled her with his pranks, she would say, \"Ah, Washington, if\r\nyou were only good!\"\r\n\r\nFor his lively spirits and quick fancy could not easily be subdued. He\r\nwould get out of his bed-room window at night, walk along a coping, and\r\nclimb over the roof to the top of the next house, only for the high\r\npurpose of astonishing a neighbor by dropping a stone down his chimney. As\r\na young school-boy he came upon Hoole's translation of Ariosto, and\r\nachieved in his father's back yard knightly adventures. \"Robinson Crusoe\"\r\nand \"Sindbad the Sailor\" made him yearn to go to sea. But this was\r\nimpossible unless he could learn to lie hard and eat salt pork, which he\r\ndetested. He would get out of bed at night and lie on the floor for an\r\nhour or two by way of practice. He also took every opportunity that came\r\nin his way of eating the detested food. But the more he tried to like it\r\nthe nastier it grew, and he gave up as impracticable his hope of going to\r\nsea. He fastened upon adventures of real travelers; he yearned for travel,\r\nand was entranced in his youth by first sight of the beauties of the\r\nHudson River. He scribbled jests for his school friends, and, of course,\r\nhe wrote a school-boy play. At sixteen his schooling was at an end, and he\r\nwas placed in a lawyer's office, from which he was transferred to another,\r\nand then, in January, 1802, to another, where he continued his clerkship\r\nwith a Mr. Hoffman, who had a young wife, and two young daughters by a\r\nformer marriage. With this family Washington Irving, a careless student,\r\nlively, clever, kind, established the happiest relations, of which\r\nafterwards there came the deep grief of his life and a sacred memory.\r\n\r\nWashington Irving's eldest brothers were beginning to thrive in business.\r\nA brother Peter shared his frolics with the pen. His artist pleasure in\r\nthe theater was indulged without his father's knowledge. He would go to\r\nthe play, come home for nine o'clock prayers, go up to bed, and climb out\r\nof his bed-room window, and run back and see the after-piece. So come\r\nevasions of undue restraint. But with all this impulsive liveliness, young\r\nWashington Irving's life appeared, as he grew up, to be in grave danger.\r\nWhen he was nineteen, and taken by a brother-in-law to Ballston springs,\r\nit was determined by those who heard his incessant night cough that he was\r\n\"not long for this world.\" When he had come of age, in April, 1804, his\r\nbrothers, chiefly his eldest brother, who was prospering, provided money\r\nto send him to Europe that he might recover health by restful travel in\r\nFrance, Italy and England. When he was helped up the side of the vessel\r\nthat was to take him from New York to Bordeaux, the captain looked at him\r\nwith pity and said, \"There's a chap who will go overboard before we get\r\nacross.\" But Washington Irving returned to New York at the beginning of\r\nthe year 1806 with health restored.\r\n\r\nWhat followed will be told in the Introduction to the other volume of\r\nthis History of New York, by Diedrich Knickerbocker.\r\n\r\nH.M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHOR'S APOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following work, in which, at the outset, nothing more was contemplated\r\nthan a temporary _jeu-d'esprit_, was commenced in company with my brother,\r\nthe late Peter Irving, Esq. Our idea was to parody a small hand-book which\r\nhad recently appeared, entitled, \"A Picture of New York.\" Like that, our\r\nwork was to begin an historical sketch; to be followed by notices of the\r\ncustoms, manners and institutions of the city; written in a serio-comic\r\nvein, and treating local errors, follies and abuses with good-humored\r\nsatire.\r\n\r\nTo burlesque the pedantic lore displayed in certain American works, our\r\nhistorical sketch was to commence with the creation of the world; and we\r\nlaid all kinds of works under contribution for trite citations, relevant\r\nor irrelevant, to give it the proper air of learned research. Before this\r\ncrude mass of mock erudition could be digested into form, my brother\r\ndeparted for Europe, and I was left to prosecute the enterprise alone.\r\n\r\nI now altered the plan of the work. Discarding all idea of a parody on the\r\n\"Picture of New York,\" I determined that what had been originally intended\r\nas an introductory sketch should comprise the whole work, and form a comic\r\nhistory of the city. I accordingly moulded the mass of citations and\r\ndisquisitions into introductory chapters, forming the first book; but it\r\nsoon became evident to me that, like Robinson Crusoe with his boat, I had\r\nbegun on too large a scale, and that, to launch my history successfully, I\r\nmust reduce its proportions. I accordingly resolved to confine it to the\r\nperiod of the Dutch domination, which, in its rise, progress and decline,\r\npresented that unity of subject required by classic rule. It was a period,\r\nalso, at that time almost a _terra incognita_ in history. In fact, I was\r\nsurprised to find how few of my fellow-citizens were aware that New York\r\nhad ever been called New Amsterdam, or had heard of the names of its early\r\nDutch governors, or cared a straw about their ancient Dutch progenitors.\r\n\r\nThis, then, broke upon me as the poetic age of our city; poetic from its\r\nvery obscurity, and open, like the early and obscure days of ancient Rome,\r\nto all the embellishments of heroic fiction. I hailed my native city as\r\nfortunate above all other American cities in having an antiquity thus\r\nextending back into the regions of doubt and fable; neither did I conceive\r\nI was committing any grievous historical sin in helping out the few facts\r\nI could collect in this remote and forgotten region with figments of my\r\nown brain, or in giving characteristic attributes to the few names\r\nconnected with it which I might dig up from oblivion.\r\n\r\nIn this, doubtless, I reasoned like a young and inexperienced writer,\r\nbesotted with his own fancies; and my presumptuous trespasses into this\r\nsacred, though neglected, region of history have met with deserved rebuke\r\nfrom men of soberer minds. It is too late, however, to recall the shaft\r\nthus rashly launched. To any one whose sense of fitness it may wound, I\r\ncan only say with Hamlet----\r\n\r\n    \"Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil\r\n    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts\r\n    That I have shot my arrow o'er the house,\r\n    And hurt my brother.\"\r\n\r\nI will say this in further apology for my work: that if it has taken an\r\nunwarrantable liberty with our early provincial history, it has at least\r\nturned attention to that history, and provoked research. It is only since\r\nthis work appeared that the forgotten archives of the province have been\r\nrummaged, and the facts and personages of the olden time rescued from the\r\ndust of oblivion, and elevated into whatever importance they may actually\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nThe main object of my work, in fact, had a bearing wide from the sober aim\r\nof history, but one which, I trust, will meet with some indulgence from\r\npoetic minds. It was to embody the traditions of our city in an amusing\r\nform; to illustrate its local humors, customs and peculiarities; to clothe\r\nhome scenes and places and familiar names with those imaginative and\r\nwhimsical associations so seldom met with in our new country, but which\r\nlive like charms and spells about the cities of the old world, binding the\r\nheart of the native inhabitant to his home.\r\n\r\nIn this I have reason to believe I have in some measure succeeded. Before\r\nthe appearance of my work the popular traditions of our city were\r\nunrecorded; the peculiar and racy customs and usages derived from our\r\nDutch progenitors were unnoticed, or regarded with indifference, or\r\nadverted to with a sneer. Now they form a convivial currency, and are\r\nbrought forward on all occasions; they link our whole community together\r\nin good-humor and good-fellowship; they are the rallying points of home\r\nfeeling; the seasoning of our civic festivities; the staple of local tales\r\nand local pleasantries; and are so harped upon by our writers of popular\r\nfiction that I find myself almost crowded off the legendary ground which I\r\nwas the first to explore by the host who have followed in my footsteps.\r\n\r\nI dwell on this head because, at the first appearance of my work, its aim\r\nand drift were misapprehended by some of the descendants of the Dutch\r\nworthies, and because I understand that now and then one may still be\r\nfound to regard it with a captious eye. The far greater part, however, I\r\nhave reason to flatter myself, receive my good-humored picturings in the\r\nsame temper with which they were executed; and when I find, after a lapse\r\nof nearly forty years, this haphazard production of my youth still\r\ncherished among them; when I find its very name become a \"household word,\"\r\nand used to give the home stamp to everything recommended for popular\r\nacceptation, such as Knickerbocker societies, Knickerbocker insurance\r\ncompanies, Knickerbocker steamboats, Knickerbocker omnibuses,\r\nKnickerbocker bread, and Knickerbocker ice; and when I find New Yorkers of\r\nDutch descent priding themselves upon being \"genuine Knickerbockers,\" I\r\nplease myself with the persuasion that I have struck the right chord; that\r\nmy dealings with the good old Dutch times, and the customs and usages\r\nderived from them, are n harmony with the feelings and humors of my\r\ntownsmen; that I have opened a vein of pleasant associations and quaint\r\ncharacteristics peculiar to my native place, and which its inhabitants\r\nwill not willingly suffer to pass away; and that, though other histories\r\nof New York may appear of higher claims to learned acceptation, and may\r\ntake their dignified and appropriate rank in the family library,\r\nKnickerbocker's history will still be received with good-humored\r\nindulgence, and be thumbed and chuckled over by the family fireside.\r\n\r\nSunnyside, 1848.\r\n\r\nW.I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotices.\r\n\r\nWHICH APPEARED IN THE NEWSPAPERS PREVIOUS TO THE PUBLICATION OF THIS WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n_From the \"Evening Post\" of October_ 26, 1809.\r\n\r\nDISTRESSING.\r\n\r\nLeft his lodgings some time since, and has not since been heard of, a\r\nsmall elderly gentleman, dressed in an old black coat and cocked hat, by\r\nthe name of _Knickerbocker_. As there are some reasons for believing he is\r\nnot entirely in his right mind, and as great anxiety is entertained about\r\nhim, any information concerning him, left either at the Columbian Hotel,\r\nMulberry Street, or at the office of this paper, will be thankfully\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nP.S.--Printers of newspapers will be aiding the cause of humanity in\r\ngiving an insertion to the above.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_From the same, November_ 6, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the \"Evening Post.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR,--Having read, in your paper of the 26th of October last, a paragraph\r\nrespecting an old gentleman by the name of _Knickerbocker_, who was\r\nmissing from his lodgings; if it would be any relief to his friends, or\r\nfurnish them with any clue to discover where he is, you may inform them\r\nthat a person answering the description given was seen by the passengers\r\nof the Albany stage, early in the morning, about four or five weeks since,\r\nresting himself by the side of the road, a little above King's Bridge. He\r\nhad in his hand a small bundle tied in a red bandana handkerchief: he\r\nappeared to be traveling northward, and was very much fatigued and\r\nexhausted.\r\n\r\nA TRAVELER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_From the same, November_ 16, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the \"Evening Post.\"_\r\n\r\nSIR,--You have been good enough to publish in your paper a paragraph about\r\n_Mr. Diedrich Knickerbocker_, who was missing so strangely some time\r\nsince. Nothing satisfactory has been heard of the old gentleman since; but\r\na _very curious kind of a written book_ has been found in his room, in\r\nhis own handwriting. Now, I wish you to notice him, if he is still alive,\r\nthat if he does not return and pay off his bill for boarding and lodging,\r\nI shall have to dispose of his book to satisfy me for the same.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, your humble servant,\r\n\r\nSETH HANDASIDE,\r\n\r\nLandlord of the Independent Columbian Hotel,\r\n\r\nMulberry Street.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_From the same, November_ 28, 1809.\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICE.\r\n\r\nINSKEEP and BRADFORD have in the press, and will shortly publish,\r\n\r\nA History of New York,\r\n\r\nIn two volumes, duodecimo.

It\r\nis published in order to discharge certain debts he has left behind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_From the \"American Citizen\" December_ 6, 1809.\r\n\r\nIs this day published,\r\n\r\nBy INSKEEP and BRADFORD, No. 128, Broadway,\r\n\r\nA History of New York,\r\n\r\n&c. &c.\r\n\r\n(Containing same as above.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACCOUNT OF THE AUTHOR\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was some time, if I recollect right, in the early part of the fall of\r\n1808, that a stranger applied for lodgings at the Independent Columbian\r\nHotel in Mulberry Street, of which I am landlord. He was a small,\r\nbrisk-looking old gentleman, dressed in a rusty black coat, a pair of\r\nolive velvet breeches, and a small cocked hat. He had a few gray hairs\r\nplaited and clubbed behind, and his beard seemed to be of some\r\neight-and-forty hours' growth. The only piece of finery which he bore\r\nabout him was a bright pair of square silver shoe-buckles; and all his\r\nbaggage was contained in a pair of saddle-bags, which he carried under his\r\narm. His whole appearance was something out of the common run; and my\r\nwife, who is a very shrewd little body, at once set him down for some\r\neminent country schoolmaster.\r\n\r\nAs the Independent Columbian Hotel is a very small house, I was a little\r\npuzzled at first where to put him; but my wife, who seemed taken with his\r\nlooks, would needs put him in her best chamber, which is genteelly set off\r\nwith the profiles of the whole family, done in black, by those two great\r\npainters, Jarvis and Wood: and commands a very pleasant view of the new\r\ngrounds on the Collect, together with the rear of the Poor House and\r\nBridewell, and the full front of the Hospital; so that it is the\r\ncheerfulest room in the whole house.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole time that he stayed with us, we found him a very worthy,\r\ngood sort of an old gentleman, though a little queer in his ways. He would\r\nkeep in his room for days together, and if any of the children cried, or\r\nmade a noise about his door, he would bounce out in a great passion, with\r\nhis hands full of papers, and say something about \"deranging his ideas;\"\r\nwhich made my wife believe sometimes that he was not altogether _compos_.\r\nIndeed, there was more than one reason to make her think so, for his room\r\nwas always covered with scraps of paper and old mouldy books, lying about\r\nat sixes and sevens, which he would never let anybody touch; for he said\r\nhe had laid them all away in their proper places, so that he might know\r\nwhere to find them; though, for that matter, he was half his time worrying\r\nabout the house in search of some book or writing which he had carefully\r\nput out of the way. I shall never forget what a pother he once made,\r\nbecause my wife cleaned out his room when his back was turned, and put\r\neverything to rights; for he swore he would never be able to get his\r\npapers in order again in a twelve-month. Upon this my wife ventured to ask\r\nhim, what he did with so many books and papers? and he told her, that he\r\nwas \"seeking for immortality\"; which made her think, more than ever, that\r\nthe poor old gentleman's head was a little cracked.\r\n\r\nHe was a very inquisitive body, and when not in his room was continually\r\npoking about town, hearing all the news, and prying into everything that\r\nwas going on; this was particularly the case about election time, when he\r\ndid nothing but bustle about him from poll to poll, attending all ward\r\nmeetings and committee-rooms; though I could never find that he took part\r\nwith either side of the question. On the contrary, he would come home and\r\nrail at both parties with great wrath--and plainly proved one day to the\r\nsatisfaction of my wife, and three old ladies who were drinking tea with\r\nher, that the two parties were like two rogues, each tugging at the skirt\r\nof the nation; and that in the end they would tear the very coat off its\r\nback, and expose its nakedness. Indeed, he was an oracle among the\r\nneighbors, who would collect around him to hear him talk of an afternoon,\r\nas he smoked his pipe on the bench before the door; and I really believe\r\nhe would have brought over the whole neighborhood to his own side of the\r\nquestion, if they could ever have found out what it was.\r\n\r\nHe was very much given to argue, or, as he called it, philosophize, about\r\nthe most trifling matter, and to do him justice, I never knew anybody that\r\nwas a match for him, except it was a grave-looking old gentleman who\r\ncalled now and then to see him, and often posed him in an argument. But\r\nthis is nothing surprising, as I have since found out this stranger is the\r\ncity librarian; and, of course, must be a man of great learning; and I\r\nhave my doubts if he had not some hand in the following history.\r\n\r\nAs our lodger had been a long time with us, and we had never received any\r\npay, my wife began to be somewhat uneasy, and curious to find out who and\r\nwhat he was. She accordingly made bold to put the question to his friend\r\nthe librarian, who replied, in his dry way, that he was one of the\r\n_Literati_; which she supposed to mean some new party in politics. I scorn\r\nto push a lodger for his pay, so I let day after day pass on without\r\ndunning the old gentleman for a farthing; but my wife, who always takes\r\nthese matters on herself, and is, as I said, a shrewd kind of a woman, at\r\nlast got out of patience, and hinted, that she thought it high time \"some\r\npeople should have a sight of some people's money.\" To which the old\r\ngentleman replied in a mighty touchy manner, that she need not make\r\nherself uneasy, for that he had a treasure there (pointing to his\r\nsaddle-bags) worth her whole house put together. This was the only answer\r\nwe could ever get from him; and as my wife, by some of those odd ways in\r\nwhich women find out everything, learnt that he was of very great\r\nconnections, being related to the Knickerbockers of Scaghtikoke, and\r\ncousin german to the Congressman of that name, she did not like to treat\r\nhim uncivilly. What is more, she even offered, merely by way of making\r\nthings easy, to let him live scot-free, if he would teach the children\r\ntheir letters; and to try her best and get her neighbors to send their\r\nchildren also; but the old gentleman took it in such dudgeon, and seemed\r\nso affronted at being taken for a schoolmaster, that she never dared to\r\nspeak on the subject again.\r\n\r\nAbout two months ago, he went out of a morning, with a bundle in his\r\nhand--and has never been heard of since. All kinds of inquiries were made\r\nafter him, but in vain. I wrote to his relations at Scaghtikoke, but they\r\nsent for answer, that he had not been there since the year before last,\r\nwhen he had a great dispute with the Congressman about politics, and left\r\nthe place in a huff, and they had neither heard nor seen anything of him\r\nfrom that time to this. I must own I felt very much worried about the poor\r\nold gentleman; for I thought something bad must have happened to him, that\r\nhe should be missing so long, and never return to pay his bill. I\r\ntherefore advertised him in the newspapers, and though my melancholy\r\nadvertisement was published by several humane printers, yet I have never\r\nbeen able to learn anything satisfactory about him.\r\n\r\nMy wife now said it was high time to take care of ourselves, and see if he\r\nhad left anything behind in his room, that would pay us for his board and\r\nlodging. We found nothing, however, but some old books and musty writings,\r\nand his pair of saddle-bags; which, being opened in the presence of the\r\nlibrarian, contained only a few articles of worn-out clothes and a large\r\nbundle of blotted paper. On looking over this, the librarian told us, he\r\nhad no doubt it was the treasure which the old gentleman had spoke about;\r\nas it proved to be a most excellent and faithful History of New York,\r\nwhich he advised us by all means to publish; assuring us that it would be\r\nso eagerly bought up by a discerning public, that he had no doubt it would\r\nbe enough to pay our arrears ten times over. Upon this we got a very\r\nlearned schoolmaster, who teaches our children, to prepare it for the\r\npress, which he accordingly has done; and has, moreover, added to it a\r\nnumber of notes of his own; and an engraving of the city, as it was at the\r\ntime Mr. Knickerbocker writes about.\r\n\r\nThis, therefore, is a true statement of my reasons for having this work\r\nprinted, without waiting for the consent of the author; and I here\r\ndeclare, that if he ever returns (though I much fear some unhappy accident\r\nhas befallen him), I stand ready to account with him like a true and\r\nhonest man. Which is all at present----\r\n\r\nFrom the public's humble servant,\r\n\r\nSETH HANDASIDE.\r\n\r\nINDEPENDENT COLUMBIAN HOTEL, NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe foregoing account of the author was prefixed to the first edition of\r\nthis work. Shortly after its publication, a letter was received from him,\r\nby Mr. Handaside, dated at a small Dutch village on the banks of the\r\nHudson, whither he had traveled for the purpose of inspecting certain\r\nancient records. As this was one of those few and happy villages, into\r\nwhich newspapers never find their way, it is not a matter of surprise,\r\nthat Mr. Knickerbocker should never have seen the numerous advertisements\r\nthat were made concerning him; and that he should learn of the publication\r\nof his history by mere accident.\r\n\r\nHe expressed much concern at its premature appearance, as thereby he was\r\nprevented from making several important corrections and alterations: as\r\nwell as from profiting by many curious hints which he had collected during\r\nhis travels along the shores of the Tappan Sea, and his sojourn at\r\nHaverstraw and Esopus.\r\n\r\nFinding that there was no longer any immediate necessity for his return to\r\nNew York, he extended his journey up to the residence of his relations at\r\nScaghtikoke. On his way thither he stopped for some days at Albany, for\r\nwhich city he is known to have entertained a great partiality. He found\r\nit, however, considerably altered, and was much concerned at the inroads\r\nand improvements which the Yankees were making, and the consequent decline\r\nof the good old Dutch manners. Indeed, he was informed that these\r\nintruders were making sad innovations in all parts of the State; where\r\nthey had given great trouble and vexation to the regular Dutch settlers,\r\nby the introduction of turnpike-gates and country school-houses. It is\r\nsaid, also, that Mr. Knickerbocker shook his head sorrowfully at noticing\r\nthe gradual decay of the great Vander Heyden palace; but was highly\r\nindignant at finding that the ancient Dutch church, which stood in the\r\nmiddle of the street, had been pulled down since his last visit.\r\n\r\nThe fame of Mr. Knickerbocker's History having reached even to Albany, he\r\nreceived much flattering attention from its worthy burghers; some of whom,\r\nhowever, pointed out two or three very great errors he had fallen into,\r\nparticularly that of suspending a lump of sugar over the Albany\r\ntea-tables, which they assured him had been discontinued for some years\r\npast. Several families, moreover, were somewhat piqued that their\r\nancestors had not been mentioned in his work, and showed great jealousy of\r\ntheir neighbors who had thus been distinguished; while the latter, it must\r\nbe confessed, plumed themselves vastly thereupon; considering these\r\nrecordings in the lights of letters patent of nobility, establishing their\r\nclaims to ancestry, which, in this republican country, is a matter of no\r\nlittle solicitude and vain-glory.\r\n\r\nIt is also said, that he enjoyed high favor and countenance from the\r\ngovernor, who once asked him to dinner, and was seen two or three times to\r\nshake hands with him when they met in the street; which certainly was\r\ngoing great lengths, considering that they differed in politics. Indeed,\r\ncertain of the governor's confidential friends, to whom he could venture\r\nto speak his mind freely on such matters, have assured us that he\r\nprivately entertained a considerable good-will for our author--nay, he\r\neven once went so far as to declare, and that openly too, and at his own\r\ntable, just after dinner, that \"Knickerbocker was a very well-meaning sort\r\nof an old gentleman, and no fool.\" From all which may have been led to\r\nsuppose, that, had our author been of different politics, and written for\r\nthe newspapers instead of wasting his talents on histories, he might have\r\nrisen to some post of honor and profit: peradventure to be a notary\r\npublic, or even a justice in the ten-pound court.\r\n\r\nBesides the honors and civilities already mentioned, he was much caressed\r\nby the _literati_ of Albany; particularly by Mr. John Cook, who\r\nentertained him very hospitably at his circulating library and\r\nreading-room, where they used to drink Spa water, and talk about the\r\nancients. He found Mr. Cook a man after his own heart--of great literary\r\nresearch, and a curious collector of books At parting, the latter, in\r\ntestimony of friendship, made him a present of the two oldest works in his\r\ncollection; which were, the earliest edition of the Heidelberg Catechism,\r\nand Adrian Vander Donck's famous account of the New Netherlands; by the\r\nlast of which Mr. Knickerbocker profited greatly in this his second\r\nedition.\r\n\r\nHaving passed some time very agreeably at Albany, our author proceeded to\r\nScaghtikoke; where, it is but justice to say, he was received with open\r\narms, and treated with wonderful loving-kindness. He was much looked up to\r\nby the family, being the first historian of the name; and was considered\r\nalmost as great a man as his cousin the Congressman--with whom, by-the-by,\r\nhe became perfectly reconciled, and contracted a strong friendship.\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of the kindness of his relations, and their great\r\nattention to his comforts, the old gentleman soon became restless and\r\ndiscontented. His history being published, he had no longer any business\r\nto occupy his thoughts, or any scheme to excite his hopes and\r\nanticipations. This, to a busy mind like his, was a truly deplorable\r\nsituation; and had he not been a man of inflexible morals and regular\r\nhabits, there would have been great danger of his taking to politics or\r\ndrinking--both which pernicious vices we daily see men driven to by mere\r\nspleen and idleness.\r\n\r\nIt is true he sometimes employed himself in preparing a second edition of\r\nhis history, wherein he endeavored to correct and improve many passages\r\nwith which he was dissatisfied, and to rectify some mistakes that had\r\ncrept into it; for he was particularly anxious that his work should be\r\nnoted for its authenticity; which, indeed, is the very life and soul of\r\nhistory. But the glow of composition had departed--he had to leave many\r\nplaces untouched which he would fain have altered; and even where he did\r\nmake alterations, he seemed always in doubt whether they were for the\r\nbetter or the worse.\r\n\r\nAfter a residence of some time at Scaghtikoke, he began to feel a strong\r\ndesire to return to New York, which he ever regarded with the warmest\r\naffection; not merely because it was his native city, but because he\r\nreally considered it the very best city in the whole world. On his return\r\nhe entered into the full enjoyment of the advantages of a literary\r\nreputation. He was continually importuned to write advertisements,\r\npetitions, handbills, and productions of similar import; and, although he\r\nnever meddled with the public papers, yet had he the credit of writing\r\ninnumerable essays, and smart things, that appeared on all subjects, and\r\nall sides of the question, in all which he was clearly detected \"by his\r\nstyle.\"\r\n\r\nHe contracted, moreover, a considerable debt at the postoffice, in\r\nconsequence of the numerous letter he received from authors and printers\r\nsoliciting his subscription--and he was applied to by every charitable\r\nsociety for yearly donations, which he gave very cheerfully, considering\r\nthese applications as so many compliments. He was once invited to a great\r\ncorporation dinner; and was even twice summoned to attend as a juryman at\r\nthe court of quarter sessions. Indeed, so renowned did he become, that he\r\ncould no longer pry about, as formerly, in all holes and corners of the\r\ncity, according to the bent of his humor, unnoticed and uninterrupted; but\r\nseveral times when he has been sauntering the streets, on his usual\r\nrambles of observation, equipped with his cane and cocked hat, the little\r\nboys at play have been known to cry, \"There goes Diedrich!\" at which the\r\nold gentleman seemed not a little pleased, looking upon these salutations\r\nin the light of the praise of posterity.\r\n\r\nIn a word, if we take into consideration all these various honors and\r\ndistinctions, together with an exuberant eulogium, passed on his in the\r\nPortfolio (with which, we are told, the old gentleman was so much\r\noverpowered, that he was sick for two or three days) it must be confessed\r\nthat few authors have ever lived to receive such illustrious rewards, or\r\nhave so completely enjoyed in advance their own immortality.\r\n\r\nAfter his return from Scaghtikoke, Mr. Knickerbocker took up his residence\r\nat a little rural retreat, which the Stuyvesants had granted him on the\r\nfamily domain, in gratitude for his honorable mention of their ancestor.\r\nIt was pleasantly situated on the borders of one of the salt marshes\r\nbeyond Corlear's Hook; subject, indeed, to be occasionally over-flowed,\r\nand much infested, in the summer-time, with mosquitoes; but otherwise\r\nvery agreeable, producing abundant crops of salt grass and bulrushes.\r\n\r\nHere, we are sorry to say, the good old gentleman fell dangerously ill of\r\na fever, occasioned by the neighboring marshes. When he found his end\r\napproaching, he disposed of his worldly affairs, leaving the bulk of his\r\nfortune to the New York Historical Society; his Heidelberg Catechism and\r\nVander Donck's work to the City Library; and his saddle-bags to Mr.\r\nHandaside. He forgave all his enemies--that is to say, all that bore any\r\nenmity towards him; for as to himself, he declared he died in good-will to\r\nall the world. And, after dictating several kind messages, to his\r\nrelations at Scaghtikoke, as well as to certain of our most substantial\r\nDutch citizens, he expired in the arms of his friend the librarian.\r\n\r\nHis remains were interred, according to his own request, in St. Mark's\r\nChurchyard, close by the bones of his favorite hero, Peter Stuyvesant; and\r\nit is rumored that the Historical Society have it in mind to erect a\r\nwooden monument to his memory in the Bowling Green.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PUBLIC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"To rescue from oblivion the memory of former incidents, and to render a\r\njust tribute of renown to the many great and wonderful transactions of our\r\nDutch progenitors, Diedrich Knickerbocker, native of the city of New York,\r\nproduces this historical essay.\"[1] Like the great Father of History,\r\nwhose words I have just quoted, I treat of times long past, over which the\r\ntwilight of uncertainty had already thrown its shadows, and the night of\r\nforgetfulness was about to descend for ever. With great solicitude had I\r\nlong beheld the early history of this venerable and ancient city gradually\r\nslipping from our grasp, trembling on the lips of narrative old age, and\r\nday by day dropping piecemeal into the tomb. In a little while, thought I,\r\nand those revered Dutch burghers, who serve as the tottering monuments of\r\ngood old times, will be gathered to their fathers; their children,\r\nengrossed by the empty pleasures or insignificant transactions of the\r\npresent age, will neglect to treasure up the recollections of the past,\r\nand posterity will search in vain for memorials of the days of the\r\nPatriarchs. The origin of our city will be buried in eternal oblivion, and\r\neven the names and achievements of Wouter Van Twiller, William Kieft, and\r\nPeter Stuyvesant be enveloped in doubt and fiction, like those of Romulus\r\nand Remus, of Charlemagne, King Arthur, Rinaldo, and Godfrey of Boulogne.\r\n\r\nDetermined, therefore, to avert if possible this threatened misfortune, I\r\nindustriously set myself to work to gather together all the fragments of\r\nour ancient history which still existed; and, like my revered prototype,\r\nHerodotus, where no written records could be found, I have endeavored to\r\ncontinue the chain of history by well-authenticated traditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this arduous undertaking, which has been the whole business of a long\r\nand solitary life, it is incredible the number of learned authors I have\r\nconsulted, and all to but little purpose. Strange as it may seem, though\r\nsuch multitudes of excellent works have been written about this country,\r\nthere are none extant which give any full and satisfactory account of the\r\nearly history of New York, or of its three first Dutch Governors. I have,\r\nhowever, gained much valuable and curious matter from an elaborate\r\nmanuscript, written in exceeding pure and classic low Dutch, excepting a\r\nfew errors in orthography, which was found in the archives of the\r\nStuyvesant family. Many legends, letters, and other documents have I\r\nlikewise gleaned in my researches among the family chests and lumber\r\ngarrets of our respectable Dutch citizens; and I have gathered a host of\r\nwell-authenticated traditions from divers excellent old ladies of my\r\nacquaintance, who requested that their names might not be mentioned. Nor\r\nmust I neglect to acknowledge how greatly I have been assisted by that\r\nadmirable and praiseworthy institution, the New York Historical Society,\r\nto which I here publicly return my sincere acknowledgments.\r\n\r\nIn the conduct, of this inestimable work I have adopted no individual\r\nmodel, but, on the contrary, have simply contented myself with combining\r\nand concentrating the excellences of the most approved ancient historians.\r\nLike Xenophon, I have maintained the utmost impartiality, and the\r\nstrictest adherence to truth throughout my history. I have enriched it,\r\nafter the manner of Sallust, with various characters of ancient worthies,\r\ndrawn at full length and faithfully colored. I have seasoned it with\r\nprofound political speculations like Thucydides, sweetened it with the\r\ngraces of sentiment like Tacitus, and infused into the whole the dignity,\r\nthe grandeur and magnificence of Livy.\r\n\r\nI am aware that I shall incur the censure of numerous very learned and\r\njudicious critics for indulging too frequently in the bold excursive\r\nmanner of my favorite Herodotus. And, to be candid, I have found it\r\nimpossible always to resist the allurements of those pleasing episodes,\r\nwhich, like flowery banks and fragrant bowers, beset the dusty road of the\r\nhistorian, and entice him to turn aside, and refresh himself from his\r\nwayfaring. But I trust it will be found that I have always resumed my\r\nstaff, and addressed myself to my weary journey with renovated spirits, so\r\nthat both my readers and myself have been benefited by the relaxation.\r\n\r\nIndeed, though it has been my constant wish and uniform endeavor to rival\r\nPolybius himself, in observing the requisite unity of History, yet the\r\nloose and unconnected manner in which many of the facts herein recorded\r\nhave come to hand rendered such an attempt extremely difficult. This\r\ndifficulty was likewise increased by one of the grand objects contemplated\r\nin my work, which was to trace the rise of sundry customs and institutions\r\nin these best of cities, and to compare them, when in the germ of infancy,\r\nwith what they are in the present old age of knowledge and improvement.\r\n\r\nBut the chief merit on which I value myself, and found my hopes for future\r\nregard, is that faithful veracity with which I have compiled this\r\ninvaluable little work; carefully winnowing away the chaff of hypothesis,\r\nand discarding the tares of fable, which are too apt to spring up and\r\nchoke the seeds of truth and wholesome knowledge. Had I been anxious to\r\ncaptivate the superficial throng, who skim like swallows over the surface\r\nof literature; or had I been anxious to commend my writings to the\r\npampered palates of literary epicures, I might have availed myself of the\r\nobscurity that overshadows the infant years of our city, to introduce a\r\nthousand pleasing fictions. But I have scrupulously discarded many a pithy\r\ntale and marvelous adventure, whereby the drowsy ear of summer indolence\r\nmight be enthralled; jealously maintaining that fidelity, gravity, and\r\ndignity which should ever distinguish the historian. \"For a writer of this\r\nclass,\" observes an elegant critic, \"must sustain the character of a wise\r\nman writing for the instruction of posterity; one who has studied to\r\ninform himself well, who has pondered his subject with care, and addresses\r\nhimself to our judgment rather than to our imagination.\"\r\n\r\nThrice happy, therefore, is this our renowned city, in having incidents\r\nworthy of swelling the theme of history; and doubly thrice happy is it in\r\nhaving such an historian as myself to relate them. For, after all, gentle\r\nreader, cities of themselves, and, in fact, empires of themselves, are\r\nnothing without an historian. It is the patient narrator who records their\r\nprosperity as they rise--who blazons forth the splendor of their noontide\r\nmeridian--who props their feeble memorials as they totter to decay--who\r\ngathers together their scattered fragments as they rot--and who piously,\r\nat length, collects their ashes into the mausoleum of his work, and rears\r\na triumphant monument to transmit their renown to all succeeding ages.\r\n\r\nWhat has been the fate of many fair cities of antiquity, whose nameless\r\nruins encumber the plains of Europe and Asia, and awaken the fruitless\r\ninquiry of the traveler? They have sunk into dust and silence--they have\r\nperished from remembrance for want of a historian! The philanthropist may\r\nweep over their desolation--the poet may wander among their mouldering\r\narches and broken columns, and indulge the visionary flights of his\r\nfancy--but alas! alas! the modern historian, whose pen, like my own, is\r\ndoomed to confine itself to dull matter of fact, seeks in vain among\r\ntheir oblivious remains for some memorial that may tell the instructive\r\ntale of their glory and their ruin.\r\n\r\n\"Wars, conflagrations, deluges,\" says Aristotle, \"destroy nations, and\r\nwith them all their monuments, their discoveries, and their vanities. The\r\ntorch of science has more than once been extinguished and rekindled--a few\r\nindividuals, who have escaped by accident, reunite the thread of\r\ngenerations.\"\r\n\r\nThe same sad misfortune which has happened to so many ancient cities will\r\nhappen again, and from the same sad cause, to nine-tenths of those which\r\nnow flourish on the face of the globe. With most of them the time for\r\nrecording their history is gone by: their origin, their foundation,\r\ntogether with the early stages of their settlement, are for ever buried in\r\nthe rubbish of years; and the same would have been the case with this fair\r\nportion of the earth if I had not snatched it from obscurity in the very\r\nnick of time, at the moment that those matters herein recorded were about\r\nentering into the widespread insatiable maw of oblivion--if I had not\r\ndragged them out, as it were, by the very locks, just as the monster's\r\nadamantine fangs were closing upon them for ever! And here have I, as\r\nbefore observed, carefully collected, collated, and arranged them, scrip\r\nand scrap, \"_punt en punt, gat en gat_,\" and commenced in this little\r\nwork, a history to serve as a foundation on which other historians may\r\nhereafter raise a noble superstructure, swelling in process of time, until\r\nKnickerbocker's New York may be equally voluminous with Gibbon's Rome, or\r\nHume and Smollett's England!\r\n\r\nAnd now indulge me for a moment: while I lay down my pen, skip to some\r\nlittle eminence at the distance of two or three hundred years ahead; and,\r\ncasting back a bird's-eye glance over the waste of years that is to roll\r\nbetween, discover myself--little I--at this moment the progenitor,\r\nprototype, and precursor of them all, posted at the head of this host of\r\nliterary worthies, with my book under my arm, and New York on my back,\r\npressing forward, like a gallant commander, to honor and immortality.\r\n\r\nSuch are the vain-glorious misgivings that will now and then enter into\r\nthe brain of the author--that irradiate, as with celestial light, his\r\nsolitary chamber, cheering his weary spirits, and animating him to\r\npersevere in his labors. And I have freely given utterance to these\r\nrhapsodies whenever they have occurred; not, I trust, from an unusual\r\nspirit of egotism, but merely that the reader may for once have an idea\r\nhow an author thinks and feels while he is writing--a kind of knowledge\r\nvery rare and curious, and much to be desired.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [1] Beloe's Herodotus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOK I._\r\n\r\nCONTAINING DIVERS INGENIOUS THEORIES AND PHILOSOPHIC SPECULATIONS,\r\nCONCERNING THE CREATION AND POPULATION OF THE WORLD, AS CONNECTED WITH THE\r\nHISTORY OF NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the best authorities, the world in which we dwell is a huge,\r\nopaque, reflecting, inanimate mass, floating in the vast ethereal ocean of\r\ninfinite space. It has the form of an orange, being an oblate spheroid,\r\ncuriously flattened at opposite parts, for the insertion of two imaginary\r\npoles, which are supposed to penetrate and unite at the center; thus\r\nforming an axis on which the mighty orange turns with a regular diurnal\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nThe transitions of light and darkness, whence proceed the alternations of\r\nday and night, are produced by this diurnal revolution successively\r\npresenting the different parts of the earth to the rays of the sun. The\r\nlatter is, according to the best, that is to say, the latest, accounts a\r\nluminous or fiery body, of a prodigious magnitude, from which this world\r\nis driven by a centrifugal or repelling power, and to which it is drawn by\r\na centripetal or attractive force; otherwise called the attraction of\r\ngravitation; the combination, or rather the counteraction, of these two\r\nopposing impulses producing a circular and annual revolution. Hence result\r\nthe different seasons of the year--viz., spring, summer, autumn, and\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThis I believe to be the most approved modern theory on the subject;\r\nthough there be many philosophers who have entertained very different\r\nopinions; some, too, of them entitled to much deference from their great\r\nantiquity and illustrious characters. Thus it was advanced by some of the\r\nancient sages that the earth was an extended plain, supported by vast\r\npillars; and by others that it rested on the head of a snake, or the back\r\nof a huge tortoise; but as they did not provide a resting place for either\r\nthe pillars or the tortoise, the whole theory fell to the ground for want\r\nof proper foundation.\r\n\r\nThe Brahmins assert, that the heavens rest upon the earth, and the sun and\r\nmoon swim therein like fishes in the water, moving from east to west by\r\nday, and gliding along the edge of the horizon to their original stations\r\nduring the night;[2] while, according to the Pauranicas of India, it is a\r\nvast plain, encircled by seven oceans of mild, nectar, and other delicious\r\nliquids; that it is studded with seven mountains, and ornamented in the\r\ncenter by a mountainous rock of burnished gold; and that a great dragon\r\noccasionally swallows up the moon, which accounts for the phenomena of\r\nlunar eclipses.[3]\r\n\r\nBeside these, and many other equally sage opinions, we have the profound\r\nconjectures of Aboul-Hassan-Aly, son of Al Khan, son of Aly, son of\r\nAbderrahman, son of Abdallah, son of Masoud el-Hadheli, who is commonly\r\ncalled Masoudi, and surnamed Cothbeddin, but who takes the humble title of\r\nLaheb-ar-rasoul, which means the companion of the ambassador of God. He\r\nhas written a universal history, entitled, \"Mouroudge-ed-dharab or the\r\nGolden Meadows, and the Mines of Precious Stones.\"[4] In this valuable work\r\nhe has related the history of the world, from the creation down to the\r\nmoment of writing; which was under the Khaliphat of Mothi Billah, in the\r\nmonth Dgioumadi-el-aoual of the 336th year of the Hegira or flight of the\r\nProphet. He informs us that the earth is a huge bird, Mecca and Medina\r\nconstitute the head, Persia and India the right wing, the land of Gog the\r\nleft wing, and Africa the tail. He informs us moreover, that an earth has\r\nexisted before the present (which he considers as a mere chicken of 7,000\r\nyears), that it has undergone divers deluges, and that, according to the\r\nopinion of some well-informed Brahmins of his acquaintance; it will be\r\nrenovated every seventy thousandth hazarouam; each hazarouam consisting of\r\n12,000 years.\r\n\r\nThese are a few of the many contradictory opinions of philosophers\r\nconcerning the earth, and we find that the learned have had equal\r\nperplexity as to the nature of the sun. Some of the ancient philosophers\r\nhave affirmed that it is a vast wheel of brilliant fire;[5] others that it\r\nis merely a mirror or sphere of transparent crystal;[6] and a third class,\r\nat the head of whom stands Anaxagoras, maintained that it was nothing but\r\na huge ignited mass of iron or stone--indeed he declared the heavens to be\r\nmerely a vault of stone--and that the stars were stones whirled upward\r\nfrom the earth, and set on fire by the velocity of its revolutions.[7] But\r\nI give little attention to the doctrines of this philosopher, the people\r\nof Athens having fully refuted them by banishing him from their city; a\r\nconcise mode of answering unwelcome doctrines, much resorted to in former\r\ndays. Another sect of philosophers do declare, that certain fiery\r\nparticles exhale constantly from the earth, which, concentrating in a\r\nsingle point of the firmament by day, constitute the sun, but being\r\nscattered and rambling about in the dark at night, collect in various\r\npoints, and form stars. These are regularly burnt out and extinguished,\r\nnot unlike to the lamps in our streets, and require a fresh supply of\r\nexhalations for the next occasion.[8]\r\n\r\nIt is even recorded that at certain remote and obscure periods, in\r\nconsequence of a great scarcity of fuel, the sun has been completely burnt\r\nout, and sometimes not rekindled for a month at a time. A most melancholy\r\ncircumstance, the very idea of which gave vast concern to Heraclitus, that\r\nworthy weeping philosopher of antiquity. In addition to these various\r\nspeculations, it was the opinion of Herschel that the sun is a\r\nmagnificent, habitable abode; the light it furnishes arising from certain\r\nempyreal, luminous or phosphoric clouds, swimming in its transparent\r\natmosphere.[9]\r\n\r\nBut we will not enter further at present into the nature of the sun, that\r\nbeing an inquiry not immediately necessary to the development of this\r\nhistory; neither will we embroil ourselves in any more of the endless\r\ndisputes of philosophers touching the form of this globe, but content\r\nourselves with the theory advanced in the beginning of this chapter, and\r\nwill proceed to illustrate by experiment the complexity of motion therein\r\ndescribed to this our rotatory planet.\r\n\r\nProfessor Von Poddingcoft (or Puddinghead, as the name may be rendered\r\ninto English) was long celebrated in the University of Leyden for profound\r\ngravity of deportment and a talent at going to sleep in the midst of\r\nexaminations, to the infinite relief of his hopeful students, who thereby\r\nworked their way through college with great ease and little study. In the\r\ncourse of one of his lectures, the learned professor seizing a bucket of\r\nwater swung it around his head at arm's length. The impulse with which he\r\nthrew the vessel from him, being a centrifugal force, the retention of his\r\narm operating as a centripetal power, and the bucket, which was a\r\nsubstitute for the earth, describing a circular orbit round about the\r\nglobular head and ruby visage of Professor Von Poddingcoft, which formed\r\nno bad representation of the sun. All of these particulars were duly\r\nexplained to the class of gaping students around him. He apprised them,\r\nmoreover, that the same principle of gravitation which retained the water\r\nin the bucket restrains the ocean from flying from the earth in its rapid\r\nrevolutions; and he farther informed them that should the motion of the\r\nearth be suddenly checked, it would incontinently fall into the sun,\r\nthrough the centripetal force of gravitation: a most ruinous event to this\r\nplanet, and one which would also obscure, though it most probably would\r\nnot extinguish, the solar luminary. An unlucky stripling, one of those\r\nvagrant geniuses who seem sent into the world merely to annoy worthy men\r\nof the puddinghead order, desirous of ascertaining the correctness of the\r\nexperiment, suddenly arrested the arm of the professor just at the moment\r\nthat the bucket was in its zenith, which immediately descended with\r\nastonishing precision upon the philosophic head of the instructor of\r\nyouth. A hollow sound, and a red-hot hiss, attended the contact; but the\r\ntheory was in the amplest manner illustrated, for the unfortunate bucket\r\nperished in the conflict; but the blazing countenance of Professor Von\r\nPoddingcoft emerged from amidst the waters, glowing fiercer than ever with\r\nunutterable indignation, whereby the students were marvelously edified,\r\nand departed considerably wiser than before.\r\n\r\nIt is a mortifying circumstance, which greatly perplexes many a\r\npainstaking philosopher, that nature often refuses to second his most\r\nprofound and elaborate efforts; so that often after having invented one\r\nof the most ingenious and natural theories imaginable, she will have the\r\nperverseness to act directly in the teeth of his system, and flatly\r\ncontradict his most favorite positions. This is a manifest and unmerited\r\ngrievance, since it throws the censure of the vulgar and unlearned\r\nentirely upon the philosopher; whereas the fault is not to be ascribed to\r\nhis theory, which is unquestionably correct, but to the waywardness of\r\nDame Nature, who, with the proverbial fickleness of her sex, is\r\ncontinually indulging in coquetries and caprices, and seems really to take\r\npleasure in violating all philosophic rules, and jilting the most learned\r\nand indefatigable of her adorers. Thus it happened with respect to the\r\nforegoing satisfactory explanation of the motion of our planet; it appears\r\nthat the centrifugal force has long since ceased to operate, while its\r\nantagonist remains in undiminished potency: the world, therefore,\r\naccording to the theory as it originally stood, ought in strict propriety\r\nto tumble into the sun; philosophers were convinced that it would do so,\r\nand awaited in anxious impatience the fulfillment of their prognostics.\r\nBut the untoward planet pertinaciously continued her course, not\r\nwithstanding that she had reason, philosophy, and a whole university of\r\nlearned professors opposed to her conduct. The philosophers took this in\r\nvery ill part, and it is thought they would never have pardoned the slight\r\nand affront which they conceived put upon them by the world had not a\r\ngood-natured professor kindly officiated as a mediator between the\r\nparties, and effected a reconciliation.\r\n\r\nFinding the world would not accommodate itself to the theory, he wisely\r\ndetermined to accommodate the theory to the world; he therefore informed\r\nhis brother philosophers that the circular motion of the earth round the\r\nsun was no sooner engendered by the conflicting impulses above described\r\nthan it became a regular revolution independent of the cause which gave it\r\norigin. His learned brethren readily joined in the opinion, being\r\nheartily glad of any explanation that would decently extricate them from\r\ntheir embarrassment; and ever since that memorable era the world has been\r\nleft to take her own course, and to revolve around the sun in such orbit\r\nas she thinks proper.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [2] Faria y Souza: Mick.

And, indeed, the clearing up of\r\nthese points is absolutely essential to my history, inasmuch as if this\r\nworld had not been formed, it is more than probable that this renowned\r\nisland, on which is situated the city of New York, would never have had an\r\nexistence. The regular course of my history, therefore, requires that I\r\nshould proceed to notice the cosmogony or formation of this our globe.\r\n\r\nAnd now I give my readers fair warning that I am about to plunge, for a\r\nchapter or two, into as complete a labyrinth as ever historian was\r\nperplexed withal; therefore, I advise them to take fast hold of my skirts,\r\nand keep close at my heels, venturing neither to the right hand nor to the\r\nleft, lest they get bemired in a slough of unintelligible learning, or\r\nhave their brains knocked out by some of those hard Greek names which will\r\nbe flying about in all directions. But should any of them be too indolent\r\nor chicken-hearted to accompany me in this perilous undertaking, they had\r\nbetter take a short cut round, and wait for me at the beginning of some\r\nsmoother chapter.\r\n\r\nOf the creation of the world we have a thousand contradictory accounts;\r\nand though a very satisfactory one is furnished us by divine revelation,\r\nyet every philosopher feels himself in honor bound to furnish us with a\r\nbetter. As an impartial historian, I consider it my duty to notice their\r\nseveral theories, by which mankind have been so exceedingly edified and\r\ninstructed.\r\n\r\nThus it was the opinion of certain ancient sages, that the earth and the\r\nwhole system of the universe was the Deity himself;[10] a doctrine most\r\nstrenuously maintained by Zenophanes and the whole tribe of Eleatics, as\r\nalso by Strabo and the sect of peripatetic philosophers. Pythagoras\r\nlikewise inculcated the famous numerical system of the monad, dyad, and\r\ntriad; and by means of his sacred quaternary, elucidated the formation of\r\nthe world, the arcana of nature, and the principles both of music and\r\nmorals.[11] Other sages adhered to the mathematical system of squares and\r\ntriangles; the cube, the pyramid, and the sphere; the tetrahedron, the\r\noctahedron, the icosahedron, and the dodecahedron.[12] While others\r\nadvocated the great elementary theory, which refers the construction of\r\nour globe and all that it contains to the combinations of four material\r\nelements, air, earth, fire, and water; with the assistance of a fifth, an\r\nimmaterial and vivifying principle.\r\n\r\nNor must I omit to mention the great atomic system taught by old Moschus\r\nbefore the siege of Troy; revived by Democritus of laughing memory;\r\nimproved by Epicurus, that king of good fellows; and modernized by the\r\nfanciful Descartes. But I decline inquiring, whether the atoms, of which\r\nthe earth is said to be composed, are eternal or recent; whether they are\r\nanimate or inanimate; whether, agreeably, to the opinion of Atheists, they\r\nwere fortuitously aggregated, or, as the Theists maintain, were arranged\r\nby a supreme intelligence.[13] Whether, in fact, the earth be an insensate\r\nclod, or whether it be animated by a soul,[14] which opinion was\r\nstrenuously maintained by a host of philosophers, at the head of whom\r\nstands the great Plato, that temperate sage, who threw the cold water of\r\nphilosophy on the form of sexual intercourse, and inculcated the doctrine\r\nof Platonic love--an exquisitely refined intercourse, but much better\r\nadapted to the ideal inhabitants of his imaginary island of Atlantis than\r\nto the sturdy race, composed of rebellious flesh and blood, which\r\npopulates the little matter-of-fact island we inhabit.\r\n\r\nBesides these systems, we have, moreover, the poetical theogony of old\r\nHesiod, who generated the whole universe in the regular mode of\r\nprocreation; and the plausible opinion of others, that the earth was\r\nhatched from the great egg of night, which floated in chaos, and was\r\ncracked by the horns of the celestial bull. To illustrate this last\r\ndoctrine, Burnet, in his theory of the earth,[15] has favored us with an\r\naccurate drawing and description, both of the form and texture of this\r\nmundane egg, which is found to bear a marvelous resemblance to that of a\r\ngoose. Such of my readers as take a proper interest in the origin of this\r\nour planet will be pleased to learn that the most profound sages of\r\nantiquity among the Egyptians, Chaldeans, Persians, Greeks, and Latins\r\nhave alternately assisted at the hatching of this strange bird, and that\r\ntheir cacklings have been caught, and continued in different tones and\r\ninflections, from philosopher to philosopher, unto the present day.\r\n\r\nBut while briefly noticing long celebrated systems of ancient sages, let\r\nme not pass over, with neglect, those of other philosophers, which, though\r\nless universal than renowned, have equal claims to attention, and equal\r\nchance for correctness. Thus it is recorded by the Brahmins in the pages\r\nof their inspired Shastah, that the angel Bistnoo transformed himself into\r\na great boar, plunged into the watery abyss, and brought up the earth on\r\nhis tusks. Then issued from him a mighty tortoise and a mighty snake; and\r\nBistnoo placed the snake erect upon the back of the tortoise, and he\r\nplaced the earth upon the head of the snake.[16]\r\n\r\nThe negro philosophers of Congo affirm, that the world was made by the\r\nhands of angels, excepting their own country, which the Supreme Being\r\nconstructed himself that it might be supremely excellent. And he took\r\ngreat pains with the inhabitants, and made them very black and beautiful;\r\nand when he had finished the first man, he was well pleased with him, and\r\nsmoothed him over the face, and hence his nose, and the nose of all his\r\ndescendants, became flat.\r\n\r\nThe Mohawk philosophers tell us, that a pregnant woman fell down from\r\nheaven, and that a tortoise took her upon its back, because every place\r\nwas covered with water; and that the woman, sitting upon the tortoise,\r\npaddled with her hands in the water, and raked up the earth, whence it\r\nfinally happened that the earth became higher than the water.[17]\r\n\r\nBut I forbear to quote a number more of these ancient and outlandish\r\nphilosophers, whose deplorable ignorance, in despite of all their\r\nerudition, compelled them to write in languages which but few of my\r\nreaders can understand; and I shall proceed briefly to notice a few more\r\nintelligible and fashionable theories of their modern successors.\r\n\r\nAnd, first, I shall mention the great Buffon, who conjectures that this\r\nglobe was originally a globe of liquid fire, scintillated from the body of\r\nthe sun, by the percussion of a comet, as a spark is generated by the\r\ncollision of flint and steel. That at first it was surrounded by gross\r\nvapors, which, cooling and condensing in process of time, constituted,\r\naccording to their densities, earth, water, and air, which gradually\r\narranged themselves, according to their respective gravities, round the\r\nburning or vitrified mass that formed their center.\r\n\r\nHutton, on the contrary, supposes that the waters at first were\r\nuniversally paramount; and he terrifies himself with the idea that the\r\nearth must be eventually washed away by the force of rain, rivers, and\r\nmountain torrents, until it is confounded with the ocean, or, in other\r\nwords, absolutely dissolves into itself. Sublime idea! far surpassing that\r\nof the tender-hearted damsel of antiquity, who wept herself into a\r\nfountain; or the good dame of Narbonne in France, who, for a volubility of\r\ntongue unusual in her sex, was doomed to peel five hundred thousand and\r\nthirty-nine ropes of onions, and actually run out at her eyes before half\r\nthe hideous task was accomplished.\r\n\r\nWhistorn, the same ingenious philosopher who rivaled Ditton in his\r\nresearches after the longitude (for which the mischief-loving Swift\r\ndischarged on their heads a most savory stanza), has distinguished himself\r\nby a very admirable theory respecting the earth. He conjectures that it\r\nwas originally a chaotic comet, which, being selected for the abode of\r\nman, was removed from its eccentric orbit; and whirled round the sun in\r\nits present regular motion; by which change of direction, order succeeded\r\nto confusion in the arrangement of its component parts. The philosopher\r\nadds that the deluge was produced by an uncourteous salute from the watery\r\ntail of another comet; doubtless through sheer envy of its improved\r\ncondition; thus furnishing a melancholy proof that jealousy may prevail\r\neven among the heavenly bodies, and discord interrupt that celestial\r\nharmony of the spheres so melodiously sung by the poets.\r\n\r\nBut I pass over a variety of excellent theories, among which are those of\r\nBurnet, and Woodward, and Whitehurst; regretting extremely that my time\r\nwill not suffer me to give them the notice they deserve; and shall\r\nconclude with that of the renowned Dr. Darwin. This learned Theban, who is\r\nas much distinguished for rhyme as reason, and for good-natured credulity\r\nas serious research, and who has recommended himself wonderfully to the\r\ngood graces of the ladies, by letting them into all the gallantries,\r\namours, debaucheries, and other topics of scandal of the court of Flora,\r\nhas fallen upon a theory worthy of his combustible imagination. According\r\nto his opinion, the huge mass of chaos took a sudden occasion to explode,\r\nlike a barrel of gunpowder, and in that act exploded the sun--which, in\r\nits flight, by a similar convulsion, exploded the earth, which in like\r\nguise exploded the moon--and thus, by a concatenation of explosions, the\r\nwhole solar system was produced, and set most systematically in\r\nmotion![18]\r\n\r\nBy the great variety of theories here alluded to, every one of which, if\r\nthoroughly examined, will be found surprisingly consistent in all its\r\nparts, my unlearned readers will perhaps be led to conclude that the\r\ncreation of a world is not so difficult a task as they at first imagined.\r\nI have shown at least a score of ingenious methods in which a world could\r\nbe constructed; and I have no doubt that had any of the philosophers above\r\nquoted the use of a good manageable comet, and the philosophical\r\nwarehouse, chaos, at his command, he would engage to manufacture, a planet\r\nas good, or, if you would take his word for it, better than this we\r\ninhabit.\r\n\r\nAnd here I cannot help noticing the kindness of Providence in creating\r\ncomets for the great relief of bewildered philosophers. By their\r\nassistance more sudden evolutions and transitions are effected in the\r\nsystem of nature than are wrought in a pantomimic exhibition by the\r\nwonder-working sword of harlequin. Should one of our modern sages, in his\r\ntheoretical flights among the stars, ever find himself lost in the clouds,\r\nand in danger of tumbling into the abyss of nonsense and absurdity, he has\r\nbut to seize a comet by the beard, mount astride of its tail, and away he\r\ngallops in triumph like an enchanter on his hippogriff, or a Connecticut\r\nwitch on her broomstick, \"to sweep the cobwebs out of the sky.\"\r\n\r\nIt is an old and vulgar saying about a \"beggar on horseback\" which I would\r\nnot for the world have applied to these reverend philosophers; but I must\r\nconfess that some of them, when they are mounted on one of those fiery\r\nsteeds, are as wild in their curvettings as was Phaeton of yore, when he\r\naspired to manage the chariot of Phoebus. One drives his comet at full\r\nspeed against the sun, and knocks the world out of him with the mighty\r\nconcussion; another, more moderate, makes his comet a kind of beast of\r\nburden, carrying the sun a regular supply of food and faggots; a third, of\r\nmore combustible disposition, threatens to throw his comet like a\r\nbombshell into the world, and blow it up like a powder magazine; while a\r\nfourth, with no great delicacy to this planet and its inhabitants,\r\ninsinuates that some day or other his comet--my modest pen blushes while I\r\nwrite it--shall absolutely turn tail upon our world and deluge it with\r\nwater! Surely, as I have already observed, comets were bountifully\r\nprovided by Providence for the benefit of philosophers to assist them in\r\nmanufacturing theories.\r\n\r\nAnd now, having adduced several of the most prominent theories that occur\r\nto my recollection, I leave my judicious readers at full liberty to\r\nchoose among them. They are all serious speculations of learned men--all\r\ndiffer essentially from each other--and all have the same title to belief.\r\nIt has ever been the task of one race of philosophers to demolish the\r\nworks of their predecessors, and elevate more splendid fantasies in their\r\nstead, which in their turn are demolished and replaced by the air-castles\r\nof a succeeding generation. Thus it would seem that knowledge and genius,\r\nof which we make such great parade, consist but in detecting the errors\r\nand absurdities of those who have gone before, and devising new errors and\r\nabsurdities, to be detected by those who are to come after us. Theories\r\nare the mighty soap-bubbles with which the grown-up children of science\r\namuse themselves while the honest vulgar stand gazing in stupid\r\nadmiration, and dignify these learned vagaries with the name of wisdom!\r\nSurely Socrates was right in his opinion, that philosophers are but a\r\nsoberer sort of madmen, busying themselves in things totally\r\nincomprehensible, or which, if they could be comprehended, would be found\r\nnot worthy the trouble of discovery.\r\n\r\nFor my own part, until the learned have come to an agreement among\r\nthemselves, I shall content myself with the account handed down to us by\r\nMoses; in which I do but follow the example of our ingenious neighbors of\r\nConnecticut; who at their first settlement proclaimed that the colony\r\nshould be governed by the laws of God--until they had time to make better.\r\n\r\nOne thing, however, appears certain--from the unanimous authority of the\r\nbefore quoted philosophers, supported by the evidence of our own senses\r\n(which, though very apt to deceive us, may be cautiously admitted as\r\nadditional testimony)--it appears, I say, and I make the assertion\r\ndeliberately, without fear of contradiction, that this globe really was\r\ncreated, and that it is composed of land and water. It further appears\r\nthat it is curiously divided and parceled out into continents and islands,\r\namong which I boldly declare the renowned island of New York will be found\r\nby any one who seeks for it in its proper place.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [10] Aristot. ap, Cic. lib. i. cap. 3.\r\n\r\n   [11] Aristot.

Authors, it is true, are not wanting who affirm that the\r\npatriarch had a number of other children. Thus Berosus makes him father of\r\nthe gigantic Titans; Methodius gives him a son called Jonithus, or Jonicus\r\n(who was the first inventor of Johnny cakes); and others have mentioned a\r\nson, named Thuiscon, from whom descended the Teutons or Teutonic, or, in\r\nother words, the Dutch nation.\r\n\r\nI regret exceedingly that the nature of my plan will not permit me to\r\ngratify the laudable curiosity of my readers, by investigating minutely\r\nthe history of the great Noah. Indeed, such an undertaking would be\r\nattended with more trouble than many people would imagine; for the good\r\nold patriarch seems to have been a great traveler in his day, and to have\r\npassed under a different name in every country that he visited. The\r\nChaldeans, for instance, give us his story, merely altering his name into\r\nXisuthrus--a trivial alteration, which to an historian skilled in\r\netymologies will appear wholly unimportant. It appears, likewise, that he\r\nhad exchanged his tarpaulin and quadrant among the Chaldeans for the\r\ngorgeous insignia of royalty, and appears as a monarch in their annals.\r\nThe Egyptians celebrate him under the name of Osiris; the Indians as Menu;\r\nthe Greek and Roman writers confound him with Ogyges; and the Theban with\r\nDeucalion and Saturn. But the Chinese, who deservedly rank among the most\r\nextensive and authentic historians, inasmuch as they have known the world\r\nmuch longer than any one else, declare that Noah was no other than Fohi;\r\nand what gives this assertion some air of credibility is that it is a\r\nfact, admitted by the most enlightened _literati_, that Noah traveled into\r\nChina, at the time of the building of the Tower of Babel (probably to\r\nimprove himself in the study of languages), and the learned Dr. Shuckford\r\ngives us the additional information that the ark rested on a mountain on\r\nthe frontiers of China.\r\n\r\nFrom this mass of rational conjectures and sage hypotheses many\r\nsatisfactory deductions might be drawn; but I shall content myself with\r\nthe simple fact stated in the Bible--viz., that Noah begat three sons,\r\nShem, Ham, and Japhet. It is astonishing on what remote and obscure\r\ncontingencies the great affairs of this world depend, and how events the\r\nmost distant, and to the common observer unconnected, are inevitably\r\nconsequent the one to the other. It remains to the philosopher to discover\r\nthese mysterious affinities, and it is the proudest triumph of his skill\r\nto detect and drag forth some latent chain of causation, which at first\r\nsight appears a paradox to the inexperienced observer. Thus many of my\r\nreaders will doubtless wonder what connection the family of Noah can\r\npossibly have with this history; and many will stare when informed that\r\nthe whole history of this quarter of the world has taken its character and\r\ncourse from the simplest circumstance of the patriarch's having but three\r\nsons--but to explain.\r\n\r\nNoah, we are told by sundry very credible historians, becoming sole\r\nsurviving heir and proprietor of the earth, in fee simple, after the\r\ndeluge, like a good father, portioned out his estate among his children.\r\nTo Shem he gave Asia; to Ham, Africa; and to Japhet, Europe. Now it is a\r\nthousand times to be lamented that he had but three sons, for had there\r\nbeen a fourth he would doubtless have inherited America, which, of\r\ncourse, would have been dragged forth from its obscurity on the occasion;\r\nand thus many a hard-working historian and philosopher would have been\r\nspared a prodigious mass of weary conjecture respecting the first\r\ndiscovery and population of this country. Noah, however, having provided\r\nfor his three sons, looked in all probability upon our country as mere\r\nwild unsettled land, and said nothing about it; and to this unpardonable\r\ntaciturnity of the patriarch may we ascribe the misfortune that America\r\ndid not come into the world as early as the other quarters of the globe.\r\n\r\nIt is true, some writers have vindicated him from this misconduct towards\r\nposterity, and asserted that he really did discover America. Thus it was\r\nthe opinion of Mark Lescarbot, a French writer, possessed of that\r\nponderosity of thought and profoundness of reflection so peculiar to his\r\nnation, that the immediate descendants of Noah peopled this quarter of the\r\nglobe, and that the old patriarch himself, who still retained a passion\r\nfor the seafaring life, superintended the transmigration. The pious and\r\nenlightened father, Charlevoix, a French Jesuit, remarkable for his\r\naversion to the marvelous, common to all great travelers, is conclusively\r\nof the same opinion; nay, he goes still farther, and decides upon the\r\nmanner in which the discovery was effected, which was by sea, and under\r\nthe immediate direction of the great Noah. \"I have already observed,\"\r\nexclaims the good father, in a tone of becoming indignation, \"that it is\r\nan arbitrary supposition that the grandchildren of Noah were not able to\r\npenetrate into the new world, or that they never thought of it. In effect,\r\nI can see no reason that can justify such a notion. Who can seriously\r\nbelieve that Noah and his immediate descendants knew less than we do, and\r\nthat the builder and pilot of the greatest ship that ever was, a ship\r\nwhich was formed to traverse an unbounded ocean, and had so many shoals\r\nand quicksands to guard against, should be ignorant of, or should not\r\nhave communicates to his descendants, the art of sailing on the ocean?\r\nTherefore, they did sail on the ocean--therefore, they sailed to\r\nAmerica--therefore, America was discovered by Noah!\"\r\n\r\nNow all this exquisite chain of reasoning, which is so strikingly\r\ncharacteristic of the good father, being addressed to the faith, rather\r\nthan the understanding, is flatly opposed by Hans de Laet, who declares it\r\na real and most ridiculous paradox to suppose that Noah ever entertained\r\nthe thought of discovering America; and as Hans is a Dutch writer, I am\r\ninclined to believe he must have been much better acquainted with the\r\nworthy crew of the ark than his competitors, and of course possessed of\r\nmore accurate sources of information. It is astonishing how intimate\r\nhistorians do daily become with the patriarchs and other great men of\r\nantiquity. As intimacy improves with time, and as the learned are\r\nparticularly inquisitive and familiar in their acquaintance with the\r\nancients, I should not be surprised if some future writers should gravely\r\ngive us a picture of men and manners as they existed before the flood, far\r\nmore copious and accurate than the Bible; and that, in the course of\r\nanother century, the log-book of the good Noah should be as current among\r\nhistorians as the voyages of Captain Cook, or the renowned history of\r\nRobinson Crusoe.\r\n\r\nI shall not occupy my time by discussing the huge mass of additional\r\nsuppositions, conjectures, and probabilities respecting the first\r\ndiscovery of this country, with which unhappy historians overload\r\nthemselves in their endeavors to satisfy the doubts of an incredulous\r\nworld. It is painful to see these laborious wights panting, and toiling,\r\nand sweating under an enormous burden, at the very outset of their works,\r\nwhich, on being opened, turns out to be nothing but a mighty bundle of\r\nstraw. As, however, by unwearied assiduity, they seem to have established\r\nthe fact, to the satisfaction of all the world, that this country has\r\nbeen discovered I shall avail myself of their useful labors to be\r\nextremely brief upon this point.\r\n\r\nI shall not, therefore, stop to inquire whether America was first\r\ndiscovered by a wandering vessel of that celebrated Phoenician fleet,\r\nwhich, according to Herodotus, circumnavigated Africa; or by that\r\nCarthaginian expedition which, Pliny the naturalist informs us, discovered\r\nthe Canary Islands; or whether it was settled by a temporary colony from\r\nTyre, as hinted by Aristotle and Seneca. I shall neither inquire whether\r\nit was first discovered by the Chinese, as Vossius with great shrewdness\r\nadvances; nor by the Norwegians in 1002, under Biron; nor be Behem the\r\nGerman navigator, as Mr. Otto has endeavored to prove to the savants of\r\nthe learned city of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nNor shall I investigate the more modern claims of the Welsh, founded on\r\nthe voyage of Prince Madoc in the eleventh century, who, having never\r\nreturned, it has since been wisely concluded that he must have gone to\r\nAmerica, and that for a plain reason if he did not go there, where else\r\ncould he have gone?--a question which most Socratically shuts out all\r\nfurther dispute.\r\n\r\nLaying aside, therefore, all the conjectures above mentioned, with a\r\nmultitude of others equally satisfactory, I shall take for granted the\r\nvulgar opinion that America was discovered on the 12th of October, 1492,\r\nby Christopher Colon, a Genoese, who has been clumsily nicknamed Columbus,\r\nbut for what reason I cannot discern. Of the voyages and adventures of\r\nthis Colon I shall say nothing, seeing that they are already sufficiently\r\nknown. Nor shall I undertake to prove that this country should have been\r\ncalled Colonia, after his name, that being notoriously self-evident.\r\n\r\nHaving thus happily got my readers on this side of the Atlantic, I picture\r\nthem to myself, all impatience to enter upon the enjoyment of the land of\r\npromise, and in full expectation that I will immediately deliver it into\r\ntheir possession. But if I do, may I ever forfeit the reputation of a\r\nregular bred historian! No--no--most curious and thrice-learned readers\r\n(for thrice learned ye are if ye have read all that has gone before, and\r\nnine times learned shall ye be if ye read that which comes after), we have\r\nyet a world of work before us. Think you the first discoverers of this\r\nfair quarter of the globe had nothing to do but go on shore and find a\r\ncountry ready laid out and cultivated like a garden, wherein they might\r\nrevel at their ease? No such thing. They had forests to cut down,\r\nunderwood to grub up, marshes to drain, and savages to exterminate. In\r\nlike manner, I have sundry doubts to clear away, questions to resolve, and\r\nparadoxes to explain before I permit you to range at random; but these\r\ndifficulties once overcome we shall be enabled to jog on right merrily\r\nthrough the rest of our history. Thus my work shall, in a manner, echo the\r\nnature of the subject, in the same manner as the sound of poetry has been\r\nfound by certain shrewd critics to echo the sense--this being an\r\nimprovement in history which I claim the merit of having invented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next inquiry at which we arrive in the regular course of our history\r\nis to ascertain, if possible, how this country was originally peopled--a\r\npoint fruitful of incredible embarrassments; for unless we prove that the\r\naborigines did absolutely come from somewhere, it will be immediately\r\nasserted in this age of scepticism, that they did not come at all; and if\r\nthey did not come at all, then was this country never populated--a\r\nconclusion perfectly agreeable to the rules of logic, but wholly\r\nirreconcilable to every feeling of humanity, inasmuch as it must\r\nsyllogistically prove fatal to the innumerable aborigines of this populous\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nTo avert so dire a sophism, and to rescue from logical annihilation so\r\nmany millions of fellow-creatures, how many wings of geese have been\r\nplundered! what oceans of ink have been benevolently drained! and how many\r\ncapacious heads of learned historians have been addled and for ever\r\nconfounded! I pause with reverential awe when I contemplate the ponderous\r\ntomes in different languages, with which they have endeavored to solve\r\nthis question, so important to the happiness of society, but so involved\r\nin clouds of impenetrable obscurity. Historian after historian has engaged\r\nin the endless circle of hypothetical argument, and, after leading us a\r\nweary chase through octavos, quartos, and folios, has let us out at the\r\nend of his work just as wise as we were at the beginning. It was doubtless\r\nsome philosophical wild-goose chase of the kind that made the old poet\r\nMacrobius rail in such a passion at curiosity, which he anathematises most\r\nheartily as \"an irksome, agonising care, a superstitious industry about\r\nunprofitable things, an itching humor to see what is not to be seen, and\r\nto be doing what signifies nothing when it is done.\" But to proceed.\r\n\r\nOf the claims of the children of Noah to the original population of this\r\ncountry I shall say nothing, as they have already been touched upon in my\r\nlast chapter. The claimants next in celebrity are the descendants of\r\nAbraham. Thus Christoval Colon (vulgarly called Columbus), when he first\r\ndiscovered the gold mines of Hispaniola, immediately concluded, with a\r\nshrewdness that would have done honor to a philosopher, that he had found\r\nthe ancient Ophir, from whence Solomon procured the gold for embellishing\r\nthe temple at Jerusalem; nay, Colon even imagined that he saw the remains\r\nof furnaces of veritable Hebraic construction, employed in refining the\r\nprecious ore.\r\n\r\nSo golden a conjecture, tinctured with such fascinating extravagance, was\r\ntoo tempting not to be immediately snapped at by the gudgeons of\r\nlearning; and, accordingly, there were divers profound writers ready to\r\nswear to its correctness, and to bring in their usual load of authorities\r\nand wise surmises, wherewithal to prop it up. Vatablus and Robert Stephens\r\ndeclared nothing could be more clear; Arius Montanus, without the least\r\nhesitation, asserts that Mexico was the true Ophir, and the Jews the early\r\nsettlers of the country. While Possevin, Becan, and several other\r\nsagacious writers lug in a supposed prophecy of the fourth book of Esdras,\r\nwhich being inserted in the mighty hypothesis, like the keystone of an\r\narch, gives it, in their opinion, perpetual durability.\r\n\r\nScarce, however, have they completed their goodly superstructure when in\r\ntrudges a phalanx of opposite authors with Hans de Laet, the great\r\nDutchman, at their head, and at one blow tumbles the whole fabric about\r\ntheir ears. Hans, in fact, contradicts outright all the Israelitish claims\r\nto the first settlement of this country, attributing all those equivocal\r\nsymptoms, and traces of Christianity and Judaism, which have been said to\r\nbe found in divers provinces of the new world, to the Devil, who has\r\nalways effected to counterfeit the worship of the true Deity. \"A remark,\"\r\nsays the knowing old Padre d'Acosta, \"made by all good authors who have\r\nspoken of the religion of nations newly discovered, and founded, besides,\r\non the authority of the fathers of the church.\"\r\n\r\nSome writers again, among whom it is with much regret I am compelled to\r\nmention Lopez de Gomara and Juan de Leri, insinuate that the Canaanites,\r\nbeing driven from the land of promise by the Jews, were seized with such a\r\npanic that they fled without looking behind them, until stopping to take\r\nbreath, they found themselves safe in America. As they brought neither\r\ntheir national language, manners, nor features with them it is supposed\r\nthey left them behind in the hurry of their flight. I cannot give my\r\nfaith to this opinion.\r\n\r\nI pass over the supposition of the learned Grotius, who being both an\r\nambassador and a Dutchman to boot, is entitled to great respect, that\r\nNorth America was peopled by a strolling company of Norwegians, and that\r\nPeru was founded by a colony from China--Manco or Mungo Capac, the first\r\nIncas, being himself a Chinese. Nor shall I more than barely mention that\r\nFather Kircher ascribes the settlement of America to the Egyptians,\r\nBudbeck to the Scandinavians, Charron to the Gauls, Juffredus Petri to a\r\nskating party from Friesland, Milius to the Celtæ, Marinocus the Sicilian\r\nto the Romans, Le Comte to the Phoenicians, Postel to the Moors, Martin\r\nd'Angleria to the Abyssinians, together with the sage surmise of De Laet,\r\nthat England, Ireland, and the Orcades may contend for that honor.\r\n\r\nNor will I bestow any more attention or credit to the idea that America is\r\nthe fairy region of Zipangri, described by that dreaming traveler Marco\r\nPolo the Venetian; or that it comprises the visionary island of Atlantis,\r\ndescribed by Plato. Neither will I stop to investigate the heathenish\r\nassertion of Paracelsus, that each hemisphere of the globe was originally\r\nfurnished with an Adam and Eve. Or the more flattering opinion of Dr.\r\nRomayne, supported by many nameless authorities, that Adam was of the\r\nIndian race; or the startling conjecture of Buffon, Helvetius, and Darwin,\r\nso highly honorable to mankind, that the whole human species is\r\naccidentally descended foam a remarkable family of monkeys!\r\n\r\nThis last conjecture, I must own, came upon me very suddenly and very\r\nungraciously. I have often beheld the clown in a pantomime, while gazing\r\nin stupid wonder at the extravagant gambols of a harlequin, all at once\r\nelectrified by a sudden stroke of the wooden sword across his shoulders.\r\nLittle did I think at such times that it would ever fall to my lot to be\r\ntreated with equal discourtesy, and that while I was quietly beholding\r\nthese grave philosophers emulating the eccentric transformations of the\r\nhero of pantomime, they would on a sudden turn upon me and my readers, and\r\nwith one hypocritical flourish metamorphose us into beasts! I determined\r\nfrom that moment not to burn my fingers with any more of their theories,\r\nbut content myself with detailing the different methods by which they\r\ntransported the descendants of these ancient and respectable monkeys to\r\nthis great field of theoretical warfare.\r\n\r\nThis was done either by migrations by land or transmigrations by water.\r\nThus Padre Joseph d'Acosta enumerates three passages by land, first by the\r\nnorth of Europe, secondly by the north of Asia, and, thirdly, by regions\r\nsouthward of the Straits of Magellan. The learned Grotius marches his\r\nNorwegians by a pleasant route across frozen rivers and arms of the sea,\r\nthrough Iceland, Greenland, Estotiland, and Naremberga; and various\r\nwriters, among whom are Angleria, De Hornn, and Buffon, anxious for the\r\naccommodation of these travelers, have fastened the two continents\r\ntogether by a strong chain of deductions--by which means they could pass\r\nover dry-shod. But should even this fail, Pinkerton, that industrious old\r\ngentleman, who compiles books and manufactures geographies, has\r\nconstructed a natural bridge of ice, from continent to continent, at the\r\ndistance of four or five miles from Behring's Straits-for which he is\r\nentitled to the grateful thanks of all the wandering aborigines who ever\r\ndid or ever will pass over it.\r\n\r\nIt is an evil much to be lamented that none of the worthy writers above\r\nquoted could ever commence his work without immediately declaring\r\nhostilities against every writer who had treated of the same subject. In\r\nthis particular authors may be compared to a certain sagacious bird,\r\nwhich, in building its nest is sure to pull to pieces the nests of all\r\nthe birds in its neighborhood. This unhappy propensity tends grievously to\r\nimpede the progress of sound knowledge. Theories are at best but brittle\r\nproductions, and when once committed to the stream, they should take care\r\nthat, like the notable pots which were fellow-voyagers, they do not crack\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nMy chief surprise is, that among the many writers I have noticed, no one\r\nhas attempted to prove that this country was peopled from the moon--or\r\nthat the first inhabitants floated hither on islands of ice, as white\r\nbears cruise about the northern oceans--or that they were conveyed hither\r\nby balloons, as modern aeronauts pass from Dover to Calais--or by\r\nwitchcraft, as Simon Magus posted among the stars--or after the manner of\r\nthe renowned Scythian Abaris, who, like the New England witches on\r\nfull-blooded broomsticks, made most unheard-of journeys on the back of a\r\ngolden arrow, given him by the Hyperborean Apollo.\r\n\r\nBut there is still one mode left by which this country could have been\r\npeopled, which I have reserved for the last, because I consider it worth\r\nall the rest; it is--by accident! Speaking of the islands of Solomon, New\r\nGuinea, and New Holland, the profound father Charlevoix observes: \"In\r\nfine, all these countries are peopled, and it is possible some have been\r\nso by accident. Now if it could have happened in that manner, why might it\r\nnot have been at the same time, and by the same means, with the other\r\nparts of the globe?\" This ingenious mode of deducing certain conclusions\r\nfrom possible premises is an improvement in syllogistic skill, and proves\r\nthe good father superior even to Archimedes, for he can turn the world\r\nwithout anything to rest his lever upon. It is only surpassed by the\r\ndexterity with which the sturdy old Jesuit in another place cuts the\r\ngordian knot--\"Nothing,\" says he, \"is more easy. The inhabitants of both\r\nhemispheres are certainly the descendants of the same father. The common\r\nfather of mankind received an express order from Heaven to people the\r\nworld, and accordingly it has been peopled. To bring this about it was\r\nnecessary to overcome all difficulties in the way, and they have also been\r\novercome!\" Pious logician! how does he put all the herd of laborious\r\ntheorists to the blush, by explaining in five words what it has cost them\r\nvolumes to prove they knew nothing about!\r\n\r\nFrom all the authorities here quoted, and a variety of others which I have\r\nconsulted, but which are omitted through fear of fatiguing the unlearned\r\nreader, I can only draw the following conclusions, which luckily, however,\r\nare sufficient for my purpose. First, that this part of the world has\r\nactually been peopled (Q.E.D.) to support which we have living proofs in\r\nthe numerous tribes of Indians that inhabit it. Secondly, that it has been\r\npeopled in five hundred different ways, as proved by a cloud of authors,\r\nwho, from the positiveness of their assertions, seem to have been\r\neye-witnesses to the fact. Thirdly, that the people of this country had a\r\nvariety of fathers, which, as it may not be thought much to their credit\r\nby the common run of readers, the less we say on the subject the better.\r\nThe question, therefore, I trust, is for ever at rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer of a history may, in some respects, be likened unto an\r\nadventurous knight, who having undertaken a perilous enterprise by way of\r\nestablishing his fame, feels bound, in honor and chivalry to turn back for\r\nno difficulty nor hardship, and never to shrink or quail, whatever enemy\r\nhe may encounter. Under this impression, I resolutely draw my pen, and\r\nfall to with might and main at those doughty questions and subtle\r\nparadoxes which, like fiery dragons and bloody giants, beset the entrance\r\nto my history, and would fain repulse me from the very threshold. And at\r\nthis moment a gigantic question has started up, which I must needs take by\r\nthe beard and utterly subdue before I can advance another step in my\r\nhistoric undertaking; but I trust this will be the last adversary I shall\r\nhave to contend with, and that in the next book I shall be enabled to\r\nconduct my readers in triumph into the body of my work.\r\n\r\nThe question which has thus suddenly arisen is, What right had the first\r\ndiscoverers of America to land and take possession of a country without\r\nfirst gaining the consent of its inhabitants, or yielding them an adequate\r\ncompensation for their territory?--a question which has withstood many\r\nfierce assaults, and has given much distress of mind to multitudes of\r\nkind-hearted folk. And, indeed, until it be totally vanquished, and put to\r\nrest, the worthy people of America can by no means enjoy the soil they\r\ninhabit with clear right and title, and quiet, unsullied conscience.\r\n\r\nThe first source of right by which property is acquired in a country is\r\ndiscovery. For as all mankind have an equal right to anything which has\r\nnever before been appropriated, so any nation that discovers an\r\nuninhabited country, and takes possession thereof, is considered as\r\nenjoying full property, and absolute, unquestionable empire therein.[19]\r\n\r\nThis proposition being admitted, it follows clearly that the Europeans who\r\nfirst visited America were the real discoverers of the same; nothing being\r\nnecessary to the establishment of this fact but simply to prove that it\r\nwas totally uninhabited by man. This would at first appear to be a point\r\nof some difficulty, for it is well known that this quarter of the world\r\nabounded with certain animals, that walked erect on two feet, had\r\nsomething of the human countenance, uttered certain unintelligible\r\nsounds, very much like language; in short, had a marvelous resemblance to\r\nhuman beings. But the zealous and enlightened fathers who accompanied the\r\ndiscoverers, for the purpose of promoting the kingdom of heaven by\r\nestablishing fat monasteries and bishoprics on earth, soon cleared up this\r\npoint, greatly to the satisfaction of his holiness the Pope and of all\r\nChristian voyagers and discoverers.\r\n\r\nThey plainly proved, and, as there were no Indian writers arose on the\r\nother side, the fact was considered as fully admitted and established,\r\nthat the two-legged race of animals before mentioned were mere cannibals,\r\ndetestable monsters, and many of them giants--which last description of\r\nvagrants have, since the time of Gog, Magog, and Goliath, been considered\r\nas outlaws, and have received no quarter in either history, chivalry, or\r\nsong. Indeed, even the philosophic Bacon declared the Americans to be\r\npeople proscribed by the laws of nature, inasmuch as they had a barbarous\r\ncustom of sacrificing men, and feeding upon man's flesh.\r\n\r\nNor are these all the proofs of their utter barbarism; among many other\r\nwriters of discernment, Ulla tells us, \"their imbecility is so visible\r\nthat one can hardly form an idea of them different from what one has of\r\nthe brutes. Nothing disturbs the tranquillity of their souls, equally\r\ninsensible to disasters and to prosperity. Though half naked, they are as\r\ncontented as a monarch in his most splendid array. Fear makes no\r\nimpression on them, and respect as little.\" All this is furthermore\r\nsupported by the authority of M. Boggier. \"It is not easy,\" says he, \"to\r\ndescribe the degree of their indifference for wealth and all its\r\nadvantages. One does not well know what motives to propose to them when\r\none would persuade them to any service. It is vain to offer them money;\r\nthey answer they are not hungry.\" And Vane gas confirms the whole,\r\nassuring us that \"ambition they have none, and are more desirous of being\r\nthought strong than valiant. The objects of ambition with us--honor, fame,\r\nreputation, riches, posts, and distinctions--are unknown among them. So\r\nthat this powerful spring of action, the cause of so much seeming good and\r\nreal evil in the world, has no power over them. In a word, these unhappy\r\nmortals may be compared to children, in whom the development of reason is\r\nnot completed.\"\r\n\r\nNow all these peculiarities, although in the unenlightened states of\r\nGreece they would have entitled their possessors to immortal honor, as\r\nhaving reduced to practice those rigid and abstemious maxims, the mere\r\ntalking about which acquired certain old Greeks the reputation of sages\r\nand philosophers; yet were they clearly proved in the present instance to\r\nbetoken a most abject and brutified nature, totally beneath the human\r\ncharacter. But the benevolent fathers, who had undertaken to turn these\r\nunhappy savages into dumb beasts by dint of argument, advanced still\r\nstronger proofs; for as certain divines of the sixteenth century, and\r\namong the rest Lullus, affirm, the Americans go naked, and have no beards!\r\n\"They have nothing,\" says Lullus, \"of the reasonable animal, except the\r\nmask.\" And even that mask was allowed to avail them but little, for it was\r\nsoon found that they were of a hideous copper complexion--and being of a\r\ncopper complexion, it was all the same as if they were negroes--and\r\nnegroes are black, \"and black,\" said the pious fathers, devoutly crossing\r\nthemselves, \"is the color of the devil!\" Therefore, so far from being able\r\nto own property, they had no right even to personal freedom--for liberty\r\nis too radiant a deity to inhabit such gloomy temples. All which\r\ncircumstances plainly convinced the righteous followers of Cortes and\r\nPizarro that these miscreants had no title to the soil that they\r\ninfested--that they were a perverse, illiterate, dumb, beardless,\r\nblack-seed--mere wild beasts of the forests and, like them, should either\r\nbe subdued or exterminated.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing arguments, therefore, and a variety of others equally\r\nconclusive, which I forbear to enumerate, it is clearly evident that this\r\nfair quarter of the globe, when first visited by Europeans, was a howling\r\nwilderness, inhabited by nothing but wild beasts; and that the\r\ntransatlantic visitors acquired an incontrovertible property therein, by\r\nthe right of discovery.\r\n\r\nThis right being fully established, we now come to the next, which is the\r\nright acquired by cultivation. \"The cultivation of the soil,\" we are told,\r\n\"is an obligation imposed by nature on mankind. The whole world is\r\nappointed for the nourishment of its inhabitants; but it would be\r\nincapable of doing it, was it uncultivated. Every nation is then obliged\r\nby the law of nature to cultivate the ground that has fallen to its share.\r\nThose people, like the ancient Germans and modern Tartars, who, having\r\nfertile countries, disdain to cultivate the earth, and choose to live by\r\nrapine, are wanting to themselves, and deserve to be exterminated as\r\nsavage and pernicious beasts.\"[20]\r\n\r\nNow it is notorious that the savages knew nothing of agriculture when\r\nfirst discovered by the Europeans, but lived a most vagabond, disorderly,\r\nunrighteous life, rambling from place to place, and prodigally rioting\r\nupon the spontaneous luxuries of nature, without tasking her generosity to\r\nyield them anything more; whereas it has been most unquestionably shown\r\nthat Heaven intended the earth should be ploughed, and sown, and manured,\r\nand laid out into cities, and towns, and farms, and country seats, and\r\npleasure grounds, and public gardens, all which the Indians knew nothing\r\nabout--therefore, they did not improve the talents Providence had\r\nbestowed on them--therefore they were careless stewards--therefore, they\r\nhad no right to the soil--therefore, they deserved to be exterminated.\r\n\r\nIt is true the savages might plead that they drew all the benefits from\r\nthe land which their simple wants required--they found plenty of game to\r\nhunt, which, together with the roots and uncultivated fruits of the earth,\r\nfurnished a sufficient variety for their frugal repasts; and that as\r\nHeaven merely designed the earth to form the abode and satisfy the wants\r\nof man, so long as those purposes were answered the will of Heaven was\r\naccomplished. But this only proves how undeserving they were of the\r\nblessings around them--they were so much the more savages for not having\r\nmore wants; for knowledge is in some degree an increase of desires, and it\r\nis this superiority both in the number and magnitude of his desires that\r\ndistinguishes the man from the beast. Therefore the Indians, in not having\r\nmore wants, were very unreasonable animals; and it was but just that they\r\nshould make way for the Europeans, who had a thousand wants to their one,\r\nand, therefore, would turn the earth to more account, and by cultivating\r\nit more truly fulfil the will of Heaven. Besides--Grotius and Lauterbach,\r\nand Puffendorf, and Titius, and many wise men beside, who have considered\r\nthe matter properly, have determined that the property of a country cannot\r\nbe acquired by hunting, cutting wood, or drawing water in it--nothing but\r\nprecise demarcation of limits, and the intention of cultivation, can\r\nestablish the possession. Now as the savages (probably from never having\r\nread the authors above quoted) had never complied with any of these\r\nnecessary forms, it plainly follows that they had no right to the soil,\r\nbut that it was completely at the disposal of the first comers, who had\r\nmore knowledge, more wants, and more elegant, that is to say artificial,\r\ndesires than themselves.\r\n\r\nIn entering upon a newly discovered, uncultivated country, therefore, the\r\nnew comers were but taking possession of what, according to the aforesaid\r\ndoctrine, was their own property--therefore in opposing them, the savages\r\nwere invading their just rights, infringing the immutable laws of nature,\r\nand counteracting the will of Heaven--therefore, they were guilty of\r\nimpiety, burglary, and trespass on the case--therefore, they were hardened\r\noffenders against God and man--therefore, they ought to be exterminated.\r\n\r\nBut a more irresistible right than either that I have mentioned, and one\r\nwhich will be the most readily admitted by my reader, provided he be\r\nblessed with bowels of charity and philanthropy, is the right acquired by\r\ncivilization. All the world knows the lamentable state in which these poor\r\nsavages were found. Not only deficient in the comforts of life, but, what\r\nis still worse, most piteously and unfortunately blind to the miseries of\r\ntheir situation. But no sooner did the benevolent inhabitants of Europe\r\nbehold their sad condition than they immediately went to work to\r\nameliorate and improve it. They introduced among them rum, gin, brandy,\r\nand the other comforts of life--and it is astonishing to read how soon the\r\npoor savages learn to estimate those blessings--they likewise made known\r\nto them a thousand remedies, by which the most inveterate diseases are\r\nalleviated and healed; and that they might comprehend the benefits and\r\nenjoy the comforts of these medicines, they previously introduced among\r\nthem the diseases which they were calculated to cure. By these and a\r\nvariety of other methods was the condition of these poor savages\r\nwonderfully improved; they acquired a thousand wants of which they had\r\nbefore been ignorant, and as he has most sources of happiness who has most\r\nwants to be gratified, they were doubtlessly rendered a much happier race\r\nof beings.\r\n\r\nBut the most important branch of civilization, and which has most\r\nstrenuously been extolled by the zealous and pious fathers of the Roman\r\nChurch, is the introduction of the Christian faith. It was truly a sight\r\nthat might well inspire horror, to behold these savages tumbling among the\r\ndark mountains of paganism, and guilty of the most horrible ignorance of\r\nreligion. It is true, they neither stole nor defrauded; they were sober,\r\nfrugal, continent, and faithful to their word; but though they acted right\r\nhabitually, it was all in vain, unless they acted so from precept. The new\r\ncomers, therefore, used every method to induce them to embrace and\r\npractice the true religion--except, indeed, that of setting them the\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nBut not withstanding all these complicated labors for their good, such was\r\nthe unparalleled obstinacy of these stubborn wretches, that they\r\nungratefully refused to acknowledge the strangers as their benefactors,\r\nand persisted in disbelieving the doctrines they endeavored to inculcate;\r\nmost insolently alleging that, from their conduct, the advocates of\r\nChristianity did not seem to believe in it themselves. Was not this too\r\nmuch for human patience? Would not one suppose that the benign visitants\r\nfrom Europe, provoked at their incredulity and discouraged by their\r\nstiff-necked obstinacy, would for ever have abandoned their shores, and\r\nconsigned them to their original ignorance and misery? But no: so zealous\r\nwere they to effect the temporal comfort and eternal salvation of these\r\npagan infidels that they even proceeded from the milder means of\r\npersuasion to the more painful and troublesome one of persecution--let\r\nloose among them whole troops of fiery monks and furious\r\nbloodhounds--purified them by fire and sword, by stake and faggot; in\r\nconsequence of which indefatigable measures the cause of Christian love\r\nand charity was so rapidly advanced that in a few years not one fifth of\r\nthe number of unbelievers existed in South America that were found there\r\nat the time of its discovery.\r\n\r\nWhat stronger right need the European settlers advance to the country than\r\nthis? Have not whole nations of uninformed savages been made acquainted\r\nwith a thousand imperious wants and indispensable comforts of which they\r\nwere before wholly ignorant? Have they not been literally hunted and\r\nsmoked out of the dens and lurking places of ignorance and infidelity, and\r\nabsolutely scourged into the right path? Have not the temporal things, the\r\nvain baubles and filthy lucre of this world, which were too apt to engage\r\ntheir worldly and selfish thoughts, been benevolently taken from them; and\r\nhave they not, instead thereof, been taught to set their affections on\r\nthings above? And finally, to use the words of a reverend Spanish father,\r\nin a letter to his superior in Spain: \"Can any one have the presumption to\r\nsay that these savage pagans have yielded anything more than an\r\ninconsiderable recompense to their benefactors, in surrendering to them a\r\nlittle pitiful tract of this dirty sublunary planet, in exchange for a\r\nglorious inheritance in the kingdom of heaven.\"\r\n\r\nHere then are three complete and undeniable sources of right established,\r\nany one of which was more than ample to establish a property in the\r\nnewly-discovered regions of America. Now, so it has happened in certain\r\nparts of this delightful quarter of the globe that the right of discovery\r\nhas been so strenuously asserted--the influence of cultivation so\r\nindustriously extended, and the progress of salvation and civilization so\r\nzealously persecuted; that, what with their attendant wars, persecutions,\r\noppressions, diseases, and other partial evils that often hang on the\r\nskirts of great benefits--the savage aborigines have, somehow or other,\r\nbeen utterly annihilated--and this all at once brings me to a fourth\r\nright, which is worth all the others put together. For the original\r\nclaimants to the soil being all dead and buried, and no one remaining to\r\ninherit or dispute the soil, the Spaniards, as the next immediate\r\noccupants, entered upon the possession as clearly as the hangman succeeds\r\nto the clothes of the malefactor--and as they have Blackstone[21] and all\r\nthe learned expounders of the law on their side, they may set all actions\r\nof ejectment at defiance--and this last right may be entitled the right by\r\nextermination, or in other words, the right by gunpowder.\r\n\r\nBut lest any scruples of conscience should remain on this head, and to\r\nsettle the question of right for ever, his holiness Pope Alexander VI.\r\nissued a mighty Bull, by which he generously granted the newly-discovered\r\nquarter of the globe to the Spaniards and Portuguese; who, thus having law\r\nand gospel on their side, and being inflamed with great spiritual zeal,\r\nshowed the pagan savages neither favor nor affection, but persecuted the\r\nwork of discovery, colonization, civilization, and extermination with ten\r\ntimes more fury than ever.\r\n\r\nThus were the European worthies who first discovered America clearly\r\nentitled to the soil, and not only entitled to the soil, but likewise to\r\nthe eternal thanks of these infidel savages, for having come so far,\r\nendured so many perils by sea and land, and taken such unwearied pains,\r\nfor no other purpose but to improve their forlorn, uncivilized, and\r\nheathenish condition; for having made them acquainted with the comforts of\r\nlife; for having introduced among them the light of religion; and,\r\nfinally, for having hurried them out of the world to enjoy its reward!\r\n\r\nBut as argument is never so well understood by us selfish mortals as when\r\nit comes home to ourselves, and as I am particularly anxious that this\r\nquestion should be put to rest for ever, I will suppose a parallel case,\r\nby way of arousing the candid attention of my readers.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, then, that the inhabitants of the moon, by astonishing\r\nadvancement in science, and by profound insight into that ineffable lunar\r\nphilosophy, the mere flickerings of which have of late years dazzled the\r\nfeebled optics, and addled the shallow brains of the good people of our\r\nglobe--let us suppose, I say, that the inhabitants of the moon, by these\r\nmeans, had arrived at such a command of their energies, such an enviable\r\nstate of perfectibility, as to control the elements, and navigate the\r\nboundless regions of space. Let us suppose a roving crew of these soaring\r\nphilosophers, in the course of an aerial voyage of discovery among the\r\nstars, should chance to alight upon this outlandish planet. And here I beg\r\nmy readers will not have the uncharitableness to smile, as is too\r\nfrequently the fault of volatile readers, when perusing the grave\r\nspeculations of philosophers. I am far from indulging in any sportive vein\r\nat present; nor is the supposition I have been making so wild as many may\r\ndeem it. It has long been a very serious and anxious question with me, and\r\nmany a time and oft, in the course of my overwhelming cares and\r\ncontrivances for the welfare and protection of this my native planet, have\r\nI lain awake whole nights debating in my mind whether it were most\r\nprobable we should first discover and civilize the moon, or the moon\r\ndiscover and civilize our globe. Neither would the prodigy of sailing in\r\nthe air or cruising among the stars be a whit more astonishing and\r\nincomprehensible to us than was the European mystery of navigating\r\nfloating castles through the world of waters to the simple savages. We\r\nhave already discovered the art of coasting along the aerial shores of our\r\nplanet by means of balloons, as the savages had of venturing along their\r\nsea-coasts in canoes; and the disparity between the former and the aerial\r\nvehicles of the philosophers from the moon might not be greater than that\r\nbetween the bark canoes of the savages and the mighty ships of their\r\ndiscoverers. I might here pursue an endless chain of similar speculations;\r\nbut as they would be unimportant to my subject, I abandon them to my\r\nreader, particularly if he be a philosopher, as matters well worthy of his\r\nattentive consideration.\r\n\r\nTo return, then, to my supposition--let us suppose that the aerial\r\nvisitants I have mentioned, possessed of vastly superior knowledge to\r\nourselves--that is to say, possessed of superior knowledge in the art of\r\nextermination--riding on hippogriffs--defended with impenetrable\r\narmor--armed with concentrated sunbeams, and provided with vast engines,\r\nto hurl enormous moonstones; in short, let us suppose them, if our vanity\r\nwill permit the supposition, as superior to us in knowledge, and\r\nconsequently in power, as the Europeans were to the Indians when they\r\nfirst discovered them. All this is very possible, it is only our\r\nself-sufficiency that makes us think otherwise; and I warrant the poor\r\nsavages, before they had any knowledge of the white men, armed in all the\r\nterrors of glittering steel and tremendous gunpowder, were as perfectly\r\nconvinced that they themselves were the wisest, the most virtuous,\r\npowerful, and perfect of created beings, as are at this present moment the\r\nlordly inhabitants of old England, the volatile populace of France, or\r\neven the self-satisfied citizens of this most enlightened republic.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, moreover, that the aerial voyagers, finding this planet to\r\nbe nothing but a howling wilderness, inhabited by us poor savages and wild\r\nbeasts, shall take formal possession of it, in the name of his most\r\ngracious and philosophic excellency, the Man in the Moon. Finding however\r\nthat their numbers are incompetent to hold it in complete subjection, on\r\naccount of the ferocious barbarity of its inhabitants, they shall take our\r\nworthy President, the King of England, the Emperor of Hayti, the mighty\r\nBonaparte, and the great King of Bantam, and, returning to their native\r\nplanet, shall carry them to court, as were the Indian chiefs led about as\r\nspectacles in the courts of Europe.\r\n\r\nThen making such obeisance as the etiquette of the court requires, they\r\nshall address the puissant Man in the Moon in, as near as I can\r\nconjecture, the following terms:----\r\n\r\n\"Most serene and mighty Potentate, whose dominions extend as far as eye\r\ncan reach, who rideth on the Great Bear, useth the sun as a looking glass,\r\nand maintaineth unrivaled control over tides, madmen, and sea-crabs. We,\r\nthy liege subjects, have just returned from a voyage of discovery, in the\r\ncourse of which we have landed and taken possession of that obscure little\r\ndirty planet, which thou beholdest rolling at a distance. The five uncouth\r\nmonsters which we have brought into this august present were once very\r\nimportant chiefs among their fellow-savages, who are a race of beings\r\ntotally destitute of the common attributes of humanity, and differing in\r\neverything from the inhabitants of the moon, inasmuch as they carry their\r\nheads upon their shoulders, instead of under their arms--have two eyes\r\ninstead of one--are utterly destitute of tails, and of a variety of\r\nunseemly complexions, particularly of horrible whiteness, instead of\r\npea-green.\r\n\r\n\"We have moreover found these miserable savages sunk into a state of the\r\nutmost ignorance and depravity, every man shamelessly living with his own\r\nwife, and rearing his own children, instead of indulging in that community\r\nof wives enjoined by the law of nature, as expounded by the philosophers\r\nof the moon. In a word, they have scarcely a gleam of true philosophy\r\namong them, but are, in fact, utter heretics, ignoramuses, and barbarians.\r\nTaking compassion, therefore, on the sad condition of these sublunary\r\nwretches, we have endeavored, while we remained on their planet, to\r\nintroduce among them the light of reason and the comforts of the moon. We\r\nhave treated them to mouthfuls of moonshine, and draughts of nitrous\r\noxide, which they swallowed with incredible voracity, particularly the\r\nfemales; and we have likewise endeavored to instil into them the precepts\r\nof lunar philosophy. We have insisted upon their renouncing the\r\ncontemptible shackles of religion and common sense, and adoring the\r\nprofound, omnipotent, and all perfect energy, and the ecstatic, immutable,\r\nimmovable perfection. But such was the unparalleled obstinacy of these\r\nwretched savages that they persisted in cleaving to their wives, and\r\nadhering to their religion, and absolutely set at nought the sublime\r\ndoctrines of the moon--nay, among other abominable heresies they even went\r\nso far as blasphemously to declare that this ineffable planet was made of\r\nnothing more nor less than green cheese!\"\r\n\r\nAt these words, the great Man in the Moon (being a very profound\r\nphilosopher) shall fall into a terrible passion, and possessing equal\r\nauthority over things that do not belong to him, as did whilome his\r\nholiness the Pope, shall forthwith issue a formidable Bull, specifying,\r\n\"That whereas a certain crew of Lunatics have lately discovered and taken\r\npossession of a newly-discovered planet called the earth; and that whereas\r\nit is inhabited by none but a race of two-legged animals that carry their\r\nheads on their shoulders instead of under their arms; cannot talk the\r\nLunatic language; have two eyes instead of one; are destitute of tails,\r\nand of a horrible whiteness, instead of pea-green--therefore, and for a\r\nvariety of other excellent reasons, they are considered incapable of\r\npossessing any property in the planet they infest, and the right and title\r\nto it are confirmed to its original discoverers. And, furthermore, the\r\ncolonists who are now about to depart to the aforesaid planet are\r\nauthorised and commanded to use every means to convert these infidel\r\nsavages from the darkness of Christianity, and make them thorough and\r\nabsolute Lunatics.\"\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this benevolent Bull, our philosophic benefactors go to\r\nwork with hearty zeal. They seize upon our fertile territories, scourge us\r\nfrom our rightful possessions, relieve us from our wives, and when we are\r\nunreasonable enough to complain, they will turn upon us and say,\r\n\"Miserable barbarians! ungrateful wretches! have we not come thousands of\r\nmiles to improve your worthless planet? have we not fed you with\r\nmoonshine! have we not intoxicated you with nitrous oxide? does not our\r\nmoon give you light every night? and have you the baseness to murmur, when\r\nwe claim a pitiful return for all these benefits?\" But finding that we not\r\nonly persist in absolute contempt of their reasoning and disbelief in\r\ntheir philosophy, but even go so far as daringly to defend our property,\r\ntheir patience shall be exhausted, and they shall resort to their superior\r\npowers of argument; hunt us with hippogriffs, transfix us with\r\nconcentrated sunbeams, demolish our cities with moonstones; until having\r\nby main force converted us to the true faith, they shall graciously permit\r\nus to exist in the torrid deserts of Arabia, or the frozen regions of\r\nLapland, there to enjoy the blessings of civilization and the charms of\r\nlunar philosophy, in much the same manner as the reformed and enlightened\r\nsavages of this country are kindly suffered to inhabit the inhospitable\r\nforests of the north, or the impenetrable wilderness of South America.\r\n\r\nThus, I hope, I have clearly proved, and strikingly illustrated, the right\r\nof the early colonists to the possession of this country; and thus is this\r\ngigantic question completely vanquished: so having manfully surmounted all\r\nobstacles, and subdued all opposition, what remains but that I should\r\nforthwith conduct my readers into the city which we have been so long in a\r\nmanner besieging? But hold: before I proceed another step I must pause to\r\ntake breath, and recover from the excessive fatigue I have undergone, in\r\npreparing to begin this most accurate of histories. And in this I do but\r\nimitate the example of a renowned Dutch tumbler of antiquity, who took a\r\nstart of three miles for the purpose of jumping over a hill, but having\r\nrun himself out of breath by the time he reached the foot, sat himself\r\nquietly down for a few moments to blow, and then walked over it at his\r\nleisure.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [19] Grotius: Puffendorf, b. v. c. 4, Vattel, b. i. c. 18, etc.\r\n\r\n   [20] Vattel, b. i. ch. 17.\r\n\r\n   [21] Bl.

Then did he spend full three months\r\nmore in trudging on foot, and voyaging in the trekschuit, from Rotterdam\r\nto Amsterdam--to Delft--to Haerlem--to Leyden--to the Hague, knocking his\r\nhead and breaking his pipe against every church in his road. Then did he\r\nadvance gradually nearer and nearer to Rotterdam, until he came in full\r\nsight of the identical spot whereon the church was to be built. Then did\r\nhe spend three months longer in walking round it and round it;\r\ncontemplating it, first from one point of view and then from another--now\r\nhe would be paddled by it on the canal--now would he peep at it through a\r\ntelescope, from the other side of the Meuse--and now would he take a\r\nbird's-eye glance at it, from the top of one of those gigantic windmills\r\nwhich protect the gates of the city. The good folks of the place were on\r\nthe tiptoe of expectation and impatience--notwithstanding all the turmoil\r\nof my great-grandfather, not a symptom of the church was yet to be seen;\r\nthey even began to fear it would never be brought into the world, but that\r\nits great projector would lie down and die in labor of the mighty plan he\r\nhad conceived. At length, having occupied twelve good months in puffing\r\nand paddling, and talking and walking--having traveled over all Holland,\r\nand even taken a peep into France and Germany--having smoked five hundred\r\nand ninety-nine pipes and three hundredweight of the best Virginia\r\ntobacco--my great-grandfather gathered together all that knowing and\r\nindustrious class of citizens who prefer attending to anybody's business\r\nsooner than their own, and having pulled off his coat and five pair of\r\nbreeches, he advanced sturdily up, and laid the corner-stone of the\r\nchurch, in the presence of the whole multitude--just at the commencement\r\nof the thirteenth month.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner, and with the example of my worthy ancestor full\r\nbefore my eyes, have I proceeded in writing this most authentic history.\r\nThe honest Rotterdammers no doubt thought my great-grandfather was doing\r\nnothing at all to the purpose, while he was making such a world of\r\nprefatory bustle about the building of his church; and many of the\r\ningenious inhabitants of this fair city will unquestionably suppose that\r\nall the preliminary chapters, with the discovery, population, and final\r\nsettlement of America, were totally irrelevant and superfluous--and that\r\nthe main business, the history of New York, is not a jot more advanced\r\nthan if I had never taken up my pen. Never were wise people more mistaken\r\nin their conjectures. In consequence of going to work slowly and\r\ndeliberately, the church came out of my grandfather's hands one of the\r\nmost sumptuous, goodly, and glorious edifices in the known\r\nworld--excepting that, like our magnificent capitol at Washington, it was\r\nbegun on so grand a scale that the good folk could not afford to finish\r\nmore than the wing of it. So, likewise, I trust, if ever I am able to\r\nfinish this work on the plan I have commenced (of which, in simple truth,\r\nI sometimes have my doubts), it will be found that I have pursued the\r\nlatest rules of my art, as exemplified in the writings of all the great\r\nAmerican historians, and wrought a very large history out of a small\r\nsubject--which nowadays, is considered one of the great triumphs of\r\nhistoric skill. To proceed, then, with the thread of my story.\r\n\r\nIn the ever-memorable year of our Lord, 1609, on a Saturday morning, the\r\nfive-and-twentieth day of March, old style, did that \"worthy and\r\nirrecoverable discoverer (as he has justly been called), Master Henry\r\nHudson,\" set sail from Holland in a stout vessel called the Half Moon,\r\nbeing employed by the Dutch East India Company to seek a north-west\r\npassage to China.\r\n\r\nHenry (or, as the Dutch historians call him, Hendrick) Hudson was a\r\nseafaring man of renown, who had learned to smoke tobacco under Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh, and is said to have been the first to introduce it into Holland,\r\nwhich gained him much popularity in that country, and caused him to find\r\ngreat favor in the eyes of their High Mightinesses the Lords States\r\nGeneral, and also of the Honorable West India Company. He was a short,\r\nsquare, brawny old gentleman, with a double chin, a mastiff mouth, and a\r\nbroad copper nose, which was supposed in those days to have acquired its\r\nfiery hue from the constant neighborhood of his tobacco pipe.\r\n\r\nHe wore a true Andrea Ferrara tucked in a leathern belt, and a commodore's\r\ncocked hat on one side of his head. He was remarkable for always jerking\r\nup his breeches when he gave out his orders, and his voice sounded not\r\nunlike the brattling of a tin trumpet, owing to the number of hard\r\nnorth-westers which he had swallowed in the course of his seafaring.\r\n\r\nSuch was Hendrick Hudson, of whom we have heard so much, and know so\r\nlittle; and I have been thus particular in his description, for the\r\nbenefit of modern painters and statuaries, that they may represent him as\r\nhe was; and not, according to their common custom with modern heroes, make\r\nhim look like a Cæsar, or Marcus Aurelius, or the Apollo of Belvidere.\r\n\r\nAs chief mate and favorite companion, the commodore chose Master Robert\r\nJuet, of Limehouse, in England. By some his name has been spelt Chewit,\r\nand ascribed to the circumstance of his having been the first man that\r\never chewed tobacco; but this I believe to be a mere flippancy; more\r\nespecially as certain of his progeny are living at this day, who write\r\ntheir names Juet. He was an old comrade and early schoolmate of the great\r\nHudson, with whom he had often played truant and sailed chip boats in a\r\nneighboring pond, when they were little boys; from whence, it is said, the\r\ncommodore first derived his bias towards a seafaring life. Certain it is\r\nthat the old people about Limehouse declared Robert Juet to be a unlucky\r\nurchin prone to mischief, that would one day or other come to the gallows.\r\n\r\nHe grew up as boys of that kind often grow up, a rambling, heedless\r\nvarlet, tossed about in all quarters of the world, meeting with more\r\nperils and wonders than did Sinbad the Sailor, without growing a whit more\r\nwise, prudent, or ill-natured. Under every misfortune he comforted himself\r\nwith a quid of tobacco, and the truly philosophic maxim that \"it will be\r\nall the same thing a hundred years hence.\" He was skilled in the art of\r\ncarving anchors and true lovers' knot on the bulk-heads and quarter\r\nrailings, and was considered a great wit on board ship, in consequence of\r\nhis playing pranks on everybody around, and now and then even making a\r\nwry face at old Hendrick when his back was turned.\r\n\r\nTo this universal genius are we indebted for many particulars concerning\r\nthis voyage, of which he wrote a history, at the request of the commodore,\r\nwho had an unconquerable aversion to writing himself, from having received\r\nso many floggings about it when at school. To supply the deficiencies of\r\nMaster Juet's journal, which is written with true log-book brevity, I have\r\navailed myself of divers family traditions, handed down from my\r\ngreat-great-grandfather, who accompanied the expedition in the capacity of\r\ncabin-boy.\r\n\r\nFrom all that I can learn, few incidents worthy of remark happened in the\r\nvoyage; and it mortifies me exceedingly that I have to admit so noted an\r\nexpedition into my work without making any more of it.\r\n\r\nSuffice it to say, the voyage was prosperous and tranquil--the crew, being\r\na patient people, much given to slumber and vacuity, and but little\r\ntroubled with the disease of thinking--a malady of the mind, which is the\r\nsure breeder of discontent. Hudson had laid in abundance of gin and\r\nsour-krout, and every man was allowed to sleep quietly at his post unless\r\nthe wind blew. True it is, some slight dissatisfaction was shown on two or\r\nthree occasions at certain unreasonable conduct of Commodore Hudson. Thus,\r\nfor instance, he forbore to shorten sail when the wind was light and the\r\nweather serene, which was considered among the most experienced Dutch\r\nseamen as certain weather-breeders, or prognostics, that the weather would\r\nchange for the worse. He acted, moreover, in direct contradiction to that\r\nancient and sage rule of the Dutch navigators, who always took in sail at\r\nnight, put the helm a-port, and turned in; by which precaution they had a\r\ngood night's rest, were sure of knowing where they were the next morning,\r\nand stood but little chance of running down a continent in the dark. He\r\nlikewise prohibited the seamen from wearing more than five jackets and six\r\npair of breeches, under pretence of rendering them more alert; and no man\r\nwas permitted to go aloft and hand in sails with a pipe in his mouth, as\r\nis the invariable Dutch custom at the present day. All these grievances,\r\nthough they might ruffle for a moment the constitutional tranquillity of\r\nthe honest Dutch tars, made but transient impression; they ate hugely,\r\ndrank profusely, and slept immeasurably; and being under the especial\r\nguidance of Providence, the ship was safely conducted to the coast of\r\nAmerica; where, after sundry unimportant touchings and standings off and\r\non, she at length, on the fourth day of September, entered that majestic\r\nbay which at this day expands its ample bosom before the city of New York,\r\nand which had never before been visited by any European.[22]\r\n\r\nIt has been traditionary in our family that when the great navigator was\r\nfirst blessed with a view of this enchanting island, he was observed, for\r\nthe first and only time in his life, to exhibit strong symptoms of\r\nastonishment and admiration. He is said to have turned to master Juet, and\r\nuttered these remarkable words, while he pointed towards this paradise of\r\nthe new world--\"See! there!\"--and thereupon, as was always his way when he\r\nwas uncommonly pleased, he did puff out such clouds of dense tobacco smoke\r\nthat in one minute the vessel was out of sight of land, and Master Juet\r\nwas fain to wait until the winds dispersed this impenetrable fog.\r\n\r\n\"It was indeed,\" as my great-grandfather used to say, though in truth I\r\nnever heard him, for he died, as might be expected, before I was born--\"it\r\nwas indeed a spot on which the eye might have revelled for ever, in ever\r\nnew and never-ending beauties.\" The island of Manna-hata spread wide\r\nbefore them, like some sweet vision of fancy, or some fair creation of\r\nindustrious magic. Its hills of smiling green swelled gently one above\r\nanother, crowned with lofty trees of luxuriant growth; some pointing their\r\ntapering foliage towards the clouds which were gloriously transparent, and\r\nothers loaded with a verdant burden of clambering vines, bowing their\r\nbranches to the earth that was covered with flowers. On the gentle\r\ndeclivities of the hills were scattered in gay profusion the dog-wood, the\r\nsumach, and the wild brier, whose scarlet berries and white blossoms\r\nglowed brightly among the deep green of the surrounding foliage; and here\r\nand there a curling column of smoke rising from the little glens that\r\nopened along the shore seemed to promise the weary voyagers a welcome at\r\nthe hands of their fellow-creatures. As they stood gazing with entranced\r\nattention on the scene before them, a red man, crowned with feathers,\r\nissued from one of these glens, and after contemplating in silent wonder\r\nthe gallant ship, as she sat like a stately swan swimming on a silver\r\nlake, sounded the war-whoop, and bounded into the woods like a wild deer,\r\nto the utter astonishment of the phlegmatic Dutchmen, who had never heard\r\nsuch a noise or witnessed such a caper in their whole lives.\r\n\r\nOf the transactions of our adventurers with the savages, and how the\r\nlatter smoked copper pipes and ate dried currants; how they brought great\r\nstore of tobacco and oysters; how they shot one of the ship's crew, and\r\nhow he was buried, I shall say nothing, being that I consider them\r\nunimportant to my history. After tarrying a few days in the bay, in order\r\nto refresh themselves after their seafaring, our voyagers weighed anchor,\r\nto explore a mighty river which emptied into the bay. This river, it is\r\nsaid, was known among the savages by the name of the Shatemuck; though we\r\nare assured in an excellent little history published in 1674, by John\r\nJosselyn, gent., that it was called the Mohegan;[23] and Master Richard\r\nBloome, who wrote some time afterwards, asserts the same--so that I very\r\nmuch incline in favor of the opinion of these two honest gentlemen. Be\r\nthis as it may, up this river did the adventurous Hendrick proceed, little\r\ndoubting but it would turn to be the much-looked-for passage to China!\r\n\r\nThe journal goes on to make mention of divers interviews between the crew\r\nand the natives in the voyage up the river; but as they would be\r\nimpertinent to my history, I shall pass over them in silence, except the\r\nfollowing dry joke, played off by the old commodore and his schoolfellow\r\nRobert Juet, which does such vast credit to their experimental philosophy\r\nthat I cannot refrain from inserting it. \"Our master and his mate\r\ndetermined to try some of the chiefe men of the countrey whether they had\r\nany treacherie in them. So they tooke them downe into the cabin, and gave\r\nthem so much wine and acqua vitæ that they were all merrie; and one of\r\nthem had his wife with him, which sate so modestly, as any of our countrey\r\nwomen would do in a strange place. In the end, one of them was drunke,\r\nwhich had been aboarde of our ship all the time that we had been there,\r\nand that was strange to them, for they could not tell how to take it.\"[24]\r\n\r\nHaving satisfied himself by this ingenious experiment that the natives\r\nwere an honest, social race of jolly roysterers, who had no objection to\r\na drinking bout, and were very merry in their cups, the old commodore\r\nchuckled hugely to himself, and thrusting a double quid of tobacco in his\r\ncheek, directed Master Juet to have it carefully recorded, for the\r\nsatisfaction of all the natural philosophers of the University of\r\nLeyden--which done, he proceeded on his voyage with great\r\nself-complacency. After sailing, however, above a hundred miles up the\r\nriver, he found the watery world around him began to grow more shallow\r\nand confined, the current more rapid and perfectly fresh--phenomena not\r\nuncommon in the ascent of rivers, but which puzzled the honest Dutchman\r\nprodigiously. A consultation was therefore called, and having deliberated\r\nfull six hours, they were brought to a determination by the ship's\r\nrunning aground--whereupon they unanimously concluded that there was but\r\nlittle chance of getting to China in this direction. A boat, however, was\r\ndespatched to explore higher up the river, which, on its return,\r\nconfirmed the opinion; upon this the ship was warped off and put about\r\nwith great difficulty, being, like most of her sex, exceedingly hard to\r\ngovern; and the adventurous Hudson, according to the account of my\r\ngreat-great-grandfather, returned down the river--with a prodigious flea\r\nin his ear!\r\n\r\nBeing satisfied that there was little likelihood of getting to China,\r\nunless, like the blind man, he returned from whence he set out, and took a\r\nfresh start, he forthwith recrossed the sea to Holland, where he was\r\nreceived with great welcome by the Honorable East India Company, who were\r\nvery much rejoiced to see him come back safe--with their ship; and at a\r\nlarge and respectable meeting of the first merchants and burgomasters of\r\nAmsterdam it was unanimously determined that, as a munificent reward for\r\nthe eminent services he had performed, and the important discovery he had\r\nmade, the great river Mohegan should be called after his name; and it\r\ncontinues to be called Hudson River unto this very day.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [22] True it is, and I am not ignorant of the fact, that in a\r\n        certain apocryphal book of voyages, compiled by one Hackluyt, is\r\n        to be found a letter written to Francis the First, by one\r\n        Giovanni, or John Verazzani, on which some writers are inclined\r\n        to found a belief that this delightful bay had been visited\r\n        nearly a century previous to the voyage of the enterprising\r\n        Hudson. Now this (albeit it has met with the countenance of\r\n        certain very judicious and learned men) I hold in utter\r\n        disbelief, and that for various good and substantial reasons:\r\n        First, because on strict examination it will be found that the\r\n        description given by this Verazzani applies about as well to the\r\n        bay of New York as it does to my nightcap. Secondly, because that\r\n        this John Verazzani, for whom I already begin to feel a most\r\n        bitter enmity, is a native of Florence, and everybody knows the\r\n        crafty wiles of these losel Florentines, by which they filched\r\n        away the laurels from the brows of the immortal Colon (vulgarly\r\n        called Columbus), and bestowed them on their officious townsman,\r\n        Amerigo Vespucci; and I make no doubt they are equally ready to\r\n        rob the illustrious Hudson of the credit of discovering this\r\n        beauteous island, adorned by the city of New York, and placing it\r\n        beside their usurped discovery of South America. And, thirdly, I\r\n        award my decision in favor of the pretensions of Hendrick Hudson,\r\n        inasmuch as his expedition sailed from Holland, being truly and\r\n        absolutely a Dutch enterprise; and though all the proofs in the\r\n        world were introduced on the other side, I would set them at\r\n        nought as undeserving my attention. If these three reasons be not\r\n        sufficient to satisfy every burgher of this ancient city, all I\r\n        can say is they are degenerate descendants from their venerable\r\n        Dutch ancestors, and totally unworthy the trouble of convincing.\r\n        Thus, therefore, the title of Hendrick Hudson to his renowned\r\n        discovery is fully vindicated.\r\n\r\n   [23] This river is likewise laid down in Ogilvy's map as\r\n        Manhattan--Noordt, Montaigne, and Mauritius river.\r\n\r\n   [24] Juet's Journ. Purch. Pil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe delectable accounts given by the great Hudson and Master Juet of the\r\ncountry they had discovered excited not a little talk and speculation\r\namong the good people of Holland. Letters patent were granted by\r\nGovernment to an association of merchants, called the West India Company,\r\nfor the exclusive trade on Hudson River, on which they erected a\r\ntrading-house called Fort Aurania, or Orange, from whence did spring the\r\ngreat city of Albany. But I forbear to dwell on the various commercial and\r\ncolonizing enterprises which took place; among which was that of Mynheer\r\nAdrian Block, who discovered and gave a name to Block Island, since famous\r\nfor its cheese--and shall barely confine myself to that which gave birth\r\nto this renowned city.\r\n\r\nIt was some three or four years after the return of the immortal Hendrick\r\nthat a crew of honest Low Dutch colonists set sail from the city of\r\nAmsterdam for the shores of America. It is an irreparable loss to history,\r\nand a great proof of the darkness of the age and the lamentable neglect of\r\nthe noble art of book-making, since so industriously cultivated by knowing\r\nsea-captains and learned supercargoes, that an expedition so interesting\r\nand important in its results should be passed over in utter silence. To my\r\ngreat-great-grandfather am I again indebted for the few facts I am enabled\r\nto give concerning it--he having once more embarked for this country, with\r\na full determination, as he said, of ending his days here--and of\r\nbegetting a race of Knickerbockers that should rise to be great men in the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe ship in which these illustrious adventurers set sail was called the\r\nGoede Vrouw, or good woman, in compliment to the wife of the president of\r\nthe West India Company, who was allowed by everybody, except her husband,\r\nto be a sweet-tempered lady--when not in liquor. It was in truth a most\r\ngallant vessel, of the most approved Dutch construction, and made by the\r\nablest ship-carpenters of Amsterdam, who, it is well known, always model\r\ntheir ships after the fair forms of their countrywomen. Accordingly, it\r\nhad one hundred feet in the beam, one hundred feet in the keel, and one\r\nhundred feet from the bottom of the stern-post to the taffrail. Like the\r\nbeauteous model, who was declared to be the greatest belle in Amsterdam,\r\nit was full in the bows, with a pair of enormous catheads, a copper\r\nbottom, and withal a most prodigious poop.\r\n\r\nThe architect, who was somewhat of a religious man, far from decorating\r\nthe ship with pagan idols, such as Jupiter, Neptune or Hercules, which\r\nheathenish abominations, I have no doubt, occasion the misfortunes and\r\nshipwreck of many a noble vessel, he I say, on the contrary, did laudably\r\nerect for a head, a goodly image of St. Nicholas, equipped with a low,\r\nbroad-brimmed hat, a huge pair of Flemish trunk hose, and a pipe that\r\nreached to the end of the bow-sprit. Thus gallantly furnished, the staunch\r\nship floated sideways, like a majestic goose, out of the harbor of the\r\ngreat city of Amsterdam, and all the bells that were not otherwise\r\nengaged, rung a triple bobmajor on the joyful occasion.\r\n\r\nMy great-great-grandfather remarks, that the voyage was uncommonly\r\nprosperous, for, being under the especial care of the ever-revered St.\r\nNicholas, the Goede Vrouw seemed to be endowed with qualities unknown to\r\ncommon vessels. Thus she made as much leeway as headway, could get along\r\nvery nearly as fast with the wind a head as when it was a-poop, and was\r\nparticularly great in a calm; in consequence of which singular advantage\r\nshe made out to accomplish her voyage in a very few months, and came to\r\nanchor at the mouth of the Hudson, a little to the east of Gibbet Island.\r\n\r\nHere lifting up their eyes they beheld, on what is at present called the\r\nJersey shore, a small Indian village, pleasantly embowered in a grove of\r\nspreading elms, and the natives all collected on the beach, gazing in\r\nstupid admiration at the Goede Vrouw. A boat was immediately dispatched to\r\nenter into a treaty with them, and, approaching the shore, hailed them\r\nthrough a trumpet in the most friendly terms; but so horribly confounded\r\nwere these poor savages at the tremendous and uncouth sound of the Low\r\nDutch language that they one and all took to their heels, and scampered\r\nover the Bergen Hills: nor did they stop until they had buried themselves,\r\nhead and ears, in the marshes on the other side, where they all miserably\r\nperished to a man; and their bones being collected and decently covered by\r\nthe Tammany Society of that day, formed that singular mound called\r\nRattlesnake Hill, which rises out of the center of the salt marshes a\r\nlittle to the east of the Newark Causeway.\r\n\r\nAnimated by this unlooked-for victory, our valiant heroes sprang ashore in\r\ntriumph, took possession of the soil as conquerors, in the name of their\r\nHigh Mightinesses the Lords States General; and marching fearlessly\r\nforward, carried the village of Communipaw by storm, not withstanding that\r\nit was vigorously defended by some half a score of old squaws and\r\npappooses. On looking about them they were so transported with the\r\nexcellences of the place that they had very little doubt the blessed St.\r\nNicholas had guided them thither as the very spot whereon to settle their\r\ncolony. The softness of the soil was wonderfully adapted to the driving of\r\npiles; the swamps and marshes around them afforded ample opportunities for\r\nthe constructing of dykes and dams; the shallowness of the shore was\r\npeculiarly favorable to the building of docks; in a word, this spot\r\nabounded with all the requisites for the foundation of a great Dutch City.\r\nOn making a faithful report, therefore, to the crew of the Goede Vrouw,\r\nthey one and all determined that this was the destined end of their\r\nvoyage. Accordingly, they descended from the Goede Vrouw, men, women and\r\nchildren, in goodly groups, as did the animals of yore from the ark, and\r\nformed themselves into a thriving settlement, which they called by the\r\nIndian name Communipaw.\r\n\r\nAs all the world is doubtless perfectly acquainted with Communipaw, it may\r\nseem somewhat superfluous to treat of it in the present work; but my\r\nreaders will please to recollect, that not withstanding it is my chief\r\ndesire to satisfy the present age, yet I write likewise for posterity, and\r\nhave to consult the understanding and curiosity of some half a score of\r\ncenturies yet to come; by which time, perhaps, were it not for this\r\ninvaluable history, the great Communipaw, like Babylon, Carthage, Nineveh,\r\nand other great cities, might be perfectly extinct--sunk and forgotten in\r\nits own mud--its inhabitants turned into oysters,[25] and even its\r\nsituation a fertile subject of learned controversy and hard-headed\r\ninvestigation among indefatigable historians. Let me, then, piously rescue\r\nfrom oblivion the humble relics of a place which was the egg from whence\r\nwas hatched the mighty city of New York!\r\n\r\nCommunipaw is at present but a small village, pleasantly situated among\r\nrural scenery, on that beauteous part of the Jersey shore which was known\r\nin ancient legends by the name of Pavonia,[26] and commands a grand\r\nprospect of the superb bay of New York. It is within but half an hour's\r\nsail of the latter place, provided you have a fair wind, and may be\r\ndistinctly seen from the city. Nay, it is a well known fact, which I can\r\ntestify from my own experience, that on a clear still summer evening you\r\nmay hear from the battery of New York the obstreperous peals of\r\nbroad-mouthed laughter of the Dutch negroes at Communipaw, who, like most\r\nother negroes, are famous for their risible powers. This is peculiarly the\r\ncase on Sunday evenings, when, it is remarked by an ingenious and\r\nobservant philosopher, who has made great discoveries in the neighborhood\r\nof this city, that they always laugh loudest, which he attributes to the\r\ncircumstance of their having their holiday clothes on.\r\n\r\nThese negroes, in fact, like the monks in the dark ages, engross all the\r\nknowledge of the place, and, being infinitely more adventurous, and more\r\nknowing than their masters, carry on all the foreign trade, making\r\nfrequent voyages to town in canoes loaded with oysters, buttermilk and\r\ncabbages. They are great astrologers, predicting the different changes of\r\nweather almost as accurately as an almanac; they are, moreover, exquisite\r\nperformers on three-stringed fiddles; in whistling they almost boast the\r\nfar-famed powers of Orpheus' lyre, for not a horse nor an ox in the place,\r\nwhen at the plough or before the wagon, will budge a foot until he hears\r\nthe well known whistle of his black driver and companion. And from their\r\namazing skill at casting up accounts upon their fingers they are regarded\r\nwith as much veneration as were the disciples of Pythagoras of yore when\r\ninitiated into the sacred quaternary of numbers.\r\n\r\nAs to the honest burghers of Communipaw, like wise men and sound\r\nphilosophers, they never look beyond their pipes, nor trouble their heads\r\nabout any affairs out of their immediate neighborhood; so that they live\r\nin profound and enviable ignorance of all the troubles, anxieties, and\r\nrevolutions of this distracted planet. I am even told that many among them\r\ndo verily believe that Holland, of which they have heard so much from\r\ntradition, is situated somewhere on Long Island; that Spiking-devil and\r\nthe Narrows are the two ends of the world; that the country is still under\r\nthe dominion of their High Mightinesses, and that the city of New York\r\nstill goes by the name of Nieuw Amsterdam. They meet every Saturday\r\nafternoon at the only tavern in the place, which bears as a sign a\r\nsquare-headed likeness of the Prince of Orange, where they smoke a silent\r\npipe by way of promoting social conviviality, and invariably drink a mug\r\nof cider to the success of Admiral Van Tromp, whom they imagine is still\r\nsweeping the British Channel with a broom at his masthead.\r\n\r\nCommunipaw, in short, is one of the numerous little villages in the\r\nvicinity of this most beautiful of cities, which are so many strongholds\r\nand fastnesses whither the primitive manners of our Dutch forefathers have\r\nretreated, and where they are cherished with devout and scrupulous\r\nstrictness. The dress of the original settlers is handed down inviolate\r\nfrom father to son--the identical broad-brimmed hat, broad-skirted coat,\r\nand broad-bottomed breeches continue from generation to generation; and\r\nseveral gigantic knee-buckles of massy silver are still in wear that made\r\ngallant display in the days of the patriarchs of Communipaw. The language\r\nlikewise continues unadulterated by barbarous innovations; and so\r\ncritically correct is the village schoolmaster in his dialect that his\r\nreading of a Low Dutch psalm has much the same effect on the nerves as the\r\nfiling of a hand-saw.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [25] Men by inaction degenerate into oysters.--Kaimes.\r\n\r\n   [26] Pavonia, in the ancient maps, is given to a tract of country\r\n        extending from about Hoboken to Amboy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving in the trifling digression which concluded the last chapter\r\ndischarged the filial duty which the city of New York owed to Communipaw,\r\nas being the mother settlement; and having given a faithful picture of it\r\nas it stands at present, I return with a soothing sentiment of\r\nself-approbation to dwell upon its early history. The crew of the Goede\r\nVrouw being soon reinforced by fresh importations from Holland, the\r\nsettlement went jollily on increasing in magnitude and prosperity. The\r\nneighboring Indians in a short time became accustomed to the uncouth sound\r\nof the Dutch language, and an intercourse gradually took place between\r\nthem and the new comers. The Indians were much given to long talks, and\r\nthe Dutch to long silence; in this particular, therefore, they\r\naccommodated each other completely. The chiefs would make long speeches\r\nabout the big bull, the wabash, and the Great Spirit, to which the others\r\nwould listen very attentively, smoke their pipes, and grunt yah, myn-her;\r\nwhereat the poor savages were wondrously delighted. They instructed the\r\nnew settlers in the best art of curing and smoking tobacco, while the\r\nlatter in return, made them drunk with true Hollands, and then taught them\r\nthe art of making bargains.\r\n\r\nA brisk trade for furs was soon opened. The Dutch traders were\r\nscrupulously honest in their dealings, and purchased by weight,\r\nestablishing it as an invariable table of avoirdupois that the hand of a\r\nDutchman weighed one pound, and his foot two pounds. It is true the simple\r\nIndians were often puzzled by the great disproportion between bulk and\r\nweight, for let them place a bundle of furs never so large in one scale,\r\nand a Dutchman put his hand or foot in the other, the bundle was sure to\r\nkick the beam; never was a package of furs known to weigh more than two\r\npounds in the market of Communipaw!\r\n\r\nThis is a singular fact; but I have it direct from my\r\ngreat-great-grandfather, who had risen to considerable importance in the\r\ncolony, being promoted to the office of weigh-master, on account of the\r\nuncommon heaviness of his foot.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch possessions in this part of the globe began now to assume a very\r\nthriving appearance, and were comprehended under the general title of\r\nNieuw Nederlandts, on account, as the sage Vander Donck observes, of their\r\ngreat resemblance to the Dutch Netherlands, which indeed was truly\r\nremarkable, excepting that the former was rugged and mountainous, and the\r\nlatter level and marshy. About this time the tranquillity of the Dutch\r\ncolonists was doomed to suffer a temporary interruption. In 1614, Captain\r\nSir Samuel Argal, sailing under a commission from Dale, Governor of\r\nVirginia, visited the Dutch settlements on Hudson River, and demanded\r\ntheir submission to the English crown and Virginian dominion. To this\r\narrogant demand, as they were in no condition to resist it, they submitted\r\nfor the time, like discreet and reasonable men.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that the valiant Argal molested the settlement of\r\nCommunipaw; on the contrary, I am told that when his vessel first hove in\r\nsight, the worthy burghers were seized with such a panic that they fell\r\nto smoking their pipes with astonishing vehemence; insomuch that they\r\nquickly raised a cloud, which, combining with the surrounding woods and\r\nmarshes, completely enveloped and concealed their beloved village, and\r\noverhung the fair regions of Pavonia--so that the terrible Captain Argal\r\npassed on, totally unsuspicious that a sturdy little Dutch settlement lay\r\nsnugly couched in the mud, under cover of all this pestilent vapor. In\r\ncommemoration of this fortunate escape, the worthy inhabitants have\r\ncontinued to smoke almost without intermission unto this very day, which\r\nis said to be the cause of the remarkable fog which often hangs over\r\nCommunipaw of a clear afternoon.\r\n\r\nUpon the departure of the enemy our magnanimous ancestors took full six\r\nmonths to recover their wind, having been exceedingly discomposed by the\r\nconsternation and hurry of affairs. They then called a council of safety\r\nto smoke over the state of the provinces. At this council presided one\r\nOloffe Van Kortlandt, who had originally been one of a set of peripatetic\r\nphilosophers who passed much of their time sunning themselves on the side\r\nof the great canal of Amsterdam in Holland; enjoying, like Diogenes, a\r\nfree and unencumbered estate in sunshine. His name Kortlandt (Shortland or\r\nLackland) was supposed, like that of the illustrious Jean Sansterre, to\r\nindicate that he had no land; but he insisted, on the contrary, that he\r\nhad great landed estates somewhere in Terra Incognita; and he had come out\r\nto the new world to look after them.\r\n\r\nLike all land speculators, he was much given to dreaming. Never did\r\nanything extraordinary happen at Communipaw but he declared that he had\r\npreviously dreamt it, being one of those infallible prophets who predict\r\nevents after they have come to pass. This supernatural gift was as highly\r\nvalued among the burghers of Pavonia as among the enlightened nations of\r\nantiquity. The wise Ulysses was more indebted to his sleeping than his\r\nwaking moments for his most subtle achievements, and seldom undertook any\r\ngreat exploit without first soundly sleeping upon it; and the same may be\r\nsaid of Oloffe Van Kortlandt, who was thence aptly denominated Oloffe the\r\nDreamer.\r\n\r\nAs yet his dreams and speculations had turned to little personal profit;\r\nand he was as much a lackland as ever. Still he carried a high head in the\r\ncommunity: if his sugar-loaf hat was rather the worse for wear, he set it\r\noft with a taller cock's tail; if his shirt was none of the cleanest, he\r\npuffed it out the more at the bosom; and if the tail of it peeped out of a\r\nhole in his breeches, it at least proved that it really had a tail and was\r\nnot a mere ruffle.\r\n\r\nThe worthy Van Kortlandt, in the council in question, urged the policy of\r\nemerging from the swamps of Communipaw and seeking some more eligible site\r\nfor the seat of empire. Such, he said, was the advice of the good St.\r\nNicholas, who had appeared to him in a dream the night before, and whom he\r\nhad known by his broad hat, his long pipe, and the resemblance which he\r\nbore to the figure on the bow of the Goede Vrouw.\r\n\r\nMany have thought this dream was a mere invention of Oloffe Van Kortlandt,\r\nwho, it is said, had ever regarded Communipaw with an evil eye, because he\r\nhad arrived there after all the land had been shared out, and who was\r\nanxious to change the seat of empire to some new place, where he might be\r\npresent at the distribution of \"town lots.\" But we must not give heed to\r\nsuch insinuations, which are too apt to be advanced against those worthy\r\ngentlemen engaged in laying out towns and in other land speculations.\r\n\r\nThis perilous enterprise was to be conducted by Oloffe himself, who chose\r\nas lieutenants, or coadjutors, Mynheers Abraham Harden Broeck, Jacobus Van\r\nZandt, and Winant Ten Broeck--three indubitably great men, but of whose\r\nhistory, although I have made diligent inquiry, I can learn but little\r\nprevious to their leaving Holland. Nor need this occasion much surprise;\r\nfor adventurers, like prophets, though they make great noise abroad, have\r\nseldom much celebrity in their own countries; but this much is certain\r\nthat the overflowings and offscourings of a country are invariably\r\ncomposed of the richest parts of the soil. And here I cannot help\r\nremarking how convenient it would be to many of our great men and great\r\nfamilies of doubtful origin, could they have the privilege of the heroes\r\nof yore, who, whenever their origin was involved in obscurity, modestly\r\nannounced themselves descended from a god, and who never visited a foreign\r\ncountry but what they told some cock-and-bull stories about their being\r\nkings and princes at home. This venal trespass on the truth, though it has\r\nbeen occasionally played off by some pseudo marquis, baronet, and other\r\nillustrious foreigner, in our land of good-natured credulity, has been\r\ncompletely discountenanced in this sceptical, matter-of-fact age; and I\r\neven question whether any tender virgin, who was accidentally and\r\nunaccountably enriched with a bantling, would save her character at parlor\r\nfiresides and evening tea-parties by ascribing the phenomenon to a swan, a\r\nshower of gold, or a river god.\r\n\r\nHad I the benefit of mythology and classic fable above alluded to, I\r\nshould have furnished the first of the trio with a pedigree equal to that\r\nof the proudest hero of antiquity. His name, Van Zandt--that is to say,\r\nfrom the dirt--gave reasons to suppose that, like Triptolemus, Themis, the\r\nCyclops, and the Titans, he had sprung from Dame Terra or the Earth! This\r\nsupposition is strongly corroborated by his size, for it is well known\r\nthat all the progeny of Mother Earth were of a gigantic stature; and Van\r\nZandt, we are told, was a tall, raw-boned man, above six feet high, with\r\nan astonishingly hard head. Nor is this origin of the illustrious Van\r\nZandt a whit more improbable or repugnant to belief than what is related\r\nand universally admitted of certain of our greatest, or rather richest,\r\nmen, who we are told with the utmost gravity did originally spring from a\r\ndunghill!\r\n\r\nOf the second of the trio but faint accounts have reached to this time,\r\nwhich mention that he was a sturdy, obstinate, worrying, bustling little\r\nman; and, from being usually equipped in an old pair of buckskins, was\r\nfamiliarly dubbed Harden Broeck, or Tough Breeches.\r\n\r\nTen Broeck completed this junto of adventurers. It is a singular but\r\nludicrous fact, which, were I not scrupulous in recording the whole truth,\r\nI should almost be tempted to pass over in silence, as incompatible with\r\nthe gravity and dignity of history, that this worthy gentleman should\r\nlikewise have been nicknamed from what in modern times is considered the\r\nmost ignoble part of the dress. But, in truth, the small-clothes seems to\r\nhave been a very dignified garment in the eyes of our venerated ancestors,\r\nin all probability from its covering that part of the body which has been\r\npronounced \"the seat of honor.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of Ten Broeck, or, as it was sometimes spelt, Tin Broeck, has\r\nbeen indifferently translated into Ten Breeches and Tin Breeches. The most\r\nelegant and ingenious writers on the subject declare in favor of Tin, or\r\nrather Thin, Breeches; whence they infer that the original bearer of it\r\nwas a poor but merry rogue, whose galligaskins were none of the soundest,\r\nand who, peradventure, may have been the author of that truly\r\nphilosophical stanza:----\r\n\r\n    \"Then why should we quarrel for riches,\r\n      Or any such glittering toys?\r\n    A light heart and thin pair of breeches\r\n      Will go through the world, my brave boys!\"\r\n\r\nThe High Dutch commentators, however, declare in favor of the other\r\nreading, and affirm that the worthy in question was a burly, bulbous man,\r\nwho, in sheer ostentation of his venerable progenitors, was the first to\r\nintroduce into the settlement the ancient Dutch fashion of ten pair of\r\nbreeches.\r\n\r\nSuch was the trio of coadjutors chosen by Oloffe the Dreamer to accompany\r\nhim in this voyage into unknown realms; as to the names of his crews they\r\nhave not been handed down by history.\r\n\r\nHaving, as I before observed, passed much of his life in the open air,\r\namong the peripatetic philosophers of Amsterdam, Oloffe had become\r\nfamiliar with the aspect of the heavens, and could as accurately determine\r\nwhen a storm was brewing or a squall rising as a dutiful husband can\r\nforesee, from the brow of his spouse, when a tempest is gathering about\r\nhis ears. Having pitched upon a time for his voyage, when the skies\r\nappeared propitious, he exhorted all his crews to take a good night's\r\nrest, wind up their family affairs, and make their wills; precautions\r\ntaken by our forefathers, even in after times when they became more\r\nadventurous, and voyaged to Haverstraw, or Kaatskill, or Groodt Esopus, or\r\nany other far country, beyond the great waters of the Tappen Zee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now the rosy blush of morn began to mantle in the east, and soon the\r\nrising sun, emerging from amidst golden and purple clouds, shed his\r\nblithesome rays on the tin weathercocks of Communipaw. It was that\r\ndelicious season of the year when Nature, breaking from the chilling\r\nthraldom of old winter, like a blooming damsel from the tyranny of a\r\nsordid old father, threw herself, blushing with ten thousand charms, into\r\nthe arms of youthful Spring. Every tufted copse and blooming grove\r\nresounded with the notes of hymeneal love. The very insects, as they\r\nsipped the dew that gemmed the tender grass of the meadows, joined in the\r\njoyous epithalamium--the virgin bud timidly put forth its blushes, \"the\r\nvoice of the turtle was heard in the land,\" and the heart of man dissolved\r\naway in tenderness. Oh, sweet Theocritus! had I thine oaten reed,\r\nwherewith thou erst did charm the gay Sicilian plains; or, oh, gentle\r\nBion! thy pastoral pipe wherein the happy swains of the Lesbian isle so\r\nmuch delighted, then might I attempt to sing, in soft Bucolic or negligent\r\nIdyllium, the rural beauties of the scene; but having nothing, save this\r\njaded goose-quill, wherewith to wing my flight, I must fain resign all\r\npoetic disportings of the fancy, and pursue my narrative in humble prose;\r\ncomforting myself with the hope, that though it may not steal so sweetly\r\nupon the imagination of my reader, yet it may commend itself, with virgin\r\nmodesty, to his better judgment, clothed in the chaste and simple garb of\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the first rays of cheerful Phoebus dart into the windows of\r\nCommunipaw than the little settlement was all in motion. Forth issued from\r\nhis castle the sage Van Kortlandt, and seizing a conch shell, blew a\r\nfar-resounding blast, that soon summoned all his lusty followers. Then did\r\nthey trudge resolutely down to the water side, escorted by a multitude of\r\nrelatives and friends, who all went down, as the common phrase expresses\r\nit, \"to see them off.\" And this shows the antiquity of those long family\r\nprocessions, often seen in our city, composed of all ages, sizes, and\r\nsexes, laden with bundles and bandboxes, escorting some bevy of country\r\ncousins about to depart for home in a market-boat.\r\n\r\nThe good Oloffe bestowed his forces in a squadron of three canoes, and\r\nhoisted his flag on board a little round Dutch boat, shaped not unlike a\r\ntub, which had formerly been the jolly-boat of the Goede Vrouw. And now,\r\nall being embarked, they bade farewell to the gazing throng upon the\r\nbeach, who continued shouting after them, even when out of hearing,\r\nwishing them a happy voyage, advising them to take good care of\r\nthemselves, not to get drowned--with an abundance of other of those sage\r\nand invaluable cautions generally given by landsmen to such as go down to\r\nthe sea in ships, and adventure upon the deep waters. In the meanwhile the\r\nvoyagers cheerily urged their course across the crystal bosom of the bay,\r\nand soon left behind them the green shores of ancient Pavonia.\r\n\r\nAnd first they touched at two small islands which lie nearly opposite\r\nCommunipaw, and which are said to have been brought into existence about\r\nthe time of the great irruption of the Hudson, when it broke through the\r\nHighlands and made its way to the ocean.[27] For, in this tremendous\r\nuproar of the waters we are told that many huge fragments of rock and land\r\nwere rent from the mountains and swept down by this runaway river, for\r\nsixty or seventy miles; where some of them ran aground on the shoals just\r\nopposite Communipaw, and formed the identical islands in question, while\r\nothers drifted out to sea, and were never heard of more. A sufficient\r\nproof of the fact is, that the rock which forms the bases of these islands\r\nis exactly similar to that of the Highlands; and moreover, one of our\r\nphilosophers, who has diligently compared the agreement of their\r\nrespective surfaces, has even gone so far as to assure me, in confidence,\r\nthat Gibbet Island was originally nothing more nor less than a wart on\r\nAnthony's nose.[28]\r\n\r\nLeaving these wonderful little isles, they next coasted by Governor's\r\nIsland, since terrible from its frowning fortress and grinning batteries.\r\nThey would by no means, however, land upon this island, since they doubted\r\nmuch it might be the abode of demons and spirits, which in those days did\r\ngreatly abound throughout this savage and pagan country.\r\n\r\nJust at this time a shoal of jolly porpoises came rolling and tumbling by,\r\nturning up their sleek sides to the sun, and spouting up the briny element\r\nin sparkling showers. No sooner did the sage Oloffe mark this than he was\r\ngreatly rejoiced. \"This,\" exclaimed he, \"if I mistake not, augurs\r\nwell--the porpoise is a fat, well-conditioned fish--a burgomaster among\r\nfishes--his looks betoken ease, plenty, and prosperity. I greatly admire\r\nthis round fat fish, and doubt not but this is a happy omen of the success\r\nof our undertaking.\" So saying, he directed his squadron to steer in the\r\ntrack of these alderman fishes.\r\n\r\nTurning, therefore, directly to the left, they swept up the strait,\r\nvulgarly called the East River. And here the rapid tide which courses\r\nthrough this strait, seizing on the gallant tub in which Commodore Van\r\nKortlandt had embarked, hurried it forward with a velocity unparalleled in\r\na Dutch boat, navigated by Dutchmen; insomuch that the good commodore, who\r\nhad all his life long been accustomed only to the drowsy navigation of\r\ncanals, was more than ever convinced that they were in the hands of some\r\nsupernatural power, and that the jolly porpoises were towing them to some\r\nfair haven that was to fulfill all their wishes and expectations.\r\n\r\nThus borne away by the resistless current, they doubled that boisterous\r\npoint of land since called Corlear's Hook,[29] and leaving to the right\r\nthe rich winding cove of the Wallabout, they drifted into a magnificent\r\nexpanse of water, surrounded by pleasant shores, whose verdure was\r\nexceedingly refreshing to the eye. While the voyagers were looking around\r\nthem, on what they conceived to be a serene and sunny lake, they beheld at\r\na distance a crew of painted savages busily employed in fishing, who\r\nseemed more like the genii of this romantic region--their slender canoe\r\nlightly balanced like a feather on the undulating surface of the bay.\r\n\r\nAt sight of these the hearts of the heroes of Communipaw were not a little\r\ntroubled. But as good fortune would have it, at the bow of the commodore's\r\nboat was stationed a valiant man, named Hendrick Kip (which, being\r\ninterpreted, means chicken, a name given him in token of his courage).\r\n\r\nNo sooner did he behold these varlet heathens, than he trembled with\r\nexcessive valor, and although a good half mile distant, he seized a\r\nmusketoon that lay at hand, and turning away his head, fired it most\r\nintrepidly in the face of the blessed sun. The blundering weapon recoiled,\r\nand gave the valiant Kip an ignominious kick, which laid him prostrate\r\nwith uplifted heels in the bottom of the boat. But such was the effect of\r\nthis tremendous fire, that the wild men of the woods, struck with\r\nconsternation, seized hastily upon their paddles, and shot away into one\r\nof the deep inlets of the Long Island shore.\r\n\r\nThis signal victory gave new spirits to the voyagers, and in honor of the\r\nachievement they gave the name of the valiant Kip to the surrounding bay,\r\nand it has continued to be called Kip's Bay from that time to the present.\r\nThe heart of the good Van Kortlandt--who, having no land of his own, was a\r\ngreat admirer of other people's--expanded to the full size of a peppercorn\r\nat the sumptuous prospect of rich unsettled country around him, and\r\nfalling into a delicious reverie, he straightway began to riot in the\r\npossession of vast meadows of salt marsh and interminable patches of\r\ncabbages. From this delectable vision he was all at once awakened by the\r\nsudden turning of the tide, which would soon have hurried him from this\r\nland of promise, had not the discreet navigator given signal to steer for\r\nshore; where they accordingly landed hard by the rocky heights of\r\nBellevue--that happy retreat where our jolly aldermen eat for the good of\r\nthe city, and fatten the turtle that are sacrificed on civic solemnities.\r\n\r\nHere, seated on the greensward, by the side of a small stream that ran\r\nsparkling among the grass, they refreshed themselves after the toils of\r\nthe seas by feasting lustily on the ample stores which they had provided\r\nfor this perilous voyage. Thus having well fortified their deliberate\r\npowers, they fell into an earnest consultation what was further to be\r\ndone. This was the first council dinner ever eaten at Bellevue by\r\nChristian burghers; and here, as tradition relates, did originate the\r\ngreat family feud between the Hardenbroecks and the Tenbroecks, which\r\nafterwards had a singular influence on the building of the city. The\r\nsturdy Harden Broeck, whose eyes had been wondrously delighted with the\r\nsalt marshes which spread their reeking bosoms along the coast, at the\r\nbottom of Kip's Bay, counseled by all means to return thither, and found\r\nthe intended city. This was strenuously opposed by the unbending Ten\r\nBroeck, and many testy arguments passed between them. The particulars of\r\nthis controversy have not reached us, which is ever to be lamented; this\r\nmuch is certain, that the sage Oloffe put an end to the dispute, by\r\ndetermining to explore still farther in the route which the mysterious\r\nporpoises had so clearly pointed out; whereupon the sturdy Tough Breeches\r\nabandoned the expedition, took possession of a neighboring hill, and in a\r\nfit of great wrath peopled all that tract of country, which has continued\r\nto be inhabited by the Hardenbroecks unto this very day.\r\n\r\nBy this time the jolly Phoebus, like some wanton urchin sporting on the\r\nside of a green hill, began to roll down the declivity of the heavens; and\r\nnow, the tide having once more turned in their favor, the Pavonians again\r\ncommitted themselves to its discretion, and coasting along the western\r\nshores, were borne towards the straits of Blackwell's Island.\r\n\r\nAnd here the capricious wanderings of the current occasioned not a little\r\nmarvel and perplexity to these illustrious mariners. Now would they be\r\ncaught by the wanton eddies, and, sweeping round a jutting point, would\r\nwind deep into some romantic little cove, that indented the fair island of\r\nManna-hata; now were they hurried narrowly by the very bases of impending\r\nrocks, mantled with the flaunting grape-vine, and crowned with groves,\r\nwhich threw a broad shade on the waves beneath; and anon they were borne\r\naway into the mid-channel and wafted along with a rapidity that very much\r\ndiscomposed the sage Van Kortlandt, who, as he saw the land swiftly\r\nreceding on either side, began exceedingly to doubt that terra firma was\r\ngiving them the slip.\r\n\r\nWherever the voyagers turned their eyes a new creation seemed to bloom\r\naround. No signs of human thrift appeared to check the delicious wildness\r\nof Nature, who here reveled in all her luxuriant variety. Those hills, now\r\nbristled like the fretful porcupine, with rows of poplars (vain upstart\r\nplants! minions of wealth and fashion!), were then adorned with the\r\nvigorous natives of the soil--the lordly oak, the generous chestnut, the\r\ngraceful elm--while here and there the tulip-tree reared its majestic\r\nhead, the giant of the forest. Where now are seen the gay retreats of\r\nluxury--villas half buried in twilight bowers, whence the amorous flute\r\noft breathes the sighings of some city swain--there the fish-hawk built\r\nhis solitary nest, on some dry tree that overlooked his watery domain. The\r\ntimid deer fed undisturbed along those shores now hallowed by the lover's\r\nmoonlight walk, and printed by the slender foot of beauty; and a savage\r\nsolitude extended over those happy regions, where now are reared the\r\nstately towers of the Joneses, the Schermerhornes, and the Rhinelanders.\r\n\r\nThus gliding in silent wonder through these new and unknown scenes, the\r\ngallant squadron of Pavonia swept by the foot of a promontory, which\r\nstrutted forth boldly into the waves, and seemed to frown upon them as\r\nthey brawled against its base. This is the bluff well known to modern\r\nmariners by the name of Gracie's Point, from the fair castle which, like\r\nan elephant, it carries upon its back. And here broke upon their view a\r\nwild and varied prospect, where land and water were beauteously\r\nintermingled, as though they had combined to heighten and set off each\r\nother's charms. To their right lay the sedgy point of Blackwell's Island,\r\ndressed in the fresh garniture of living green; beyond it stretched the\r\npleasant coast of Sundswick, and the small harbor well known by the name\r\nof Hallet's Cove--a place infamous in latter days, by reason of its being\r\nthe haunt of pirates who infest these seas, robbing orchards and\r\nwater-melon patches, and insulting gentlemen navigators when voyaging in\r\ntheir pleasure boats. To the left a deep bay, or rather creek, gracefully\r\nreceded between shores fringed with forests, and forming a kind of vista\r\nthrough which were beheld the sylvan regions of Haerlem, Morrissania, and\r\nEast Chester. Here the eye reposed with delight on a richly weeded\r\ncountry, diversified by tufted knolls, shadowy intervals, and waving lines\r\nof upland, swelling above each other; while over the whole the purple\r\nmists of spring diffused a hue of soft voluptuousness.\r\n\r\nJust before them the grand course of the stream, making a sudden bend,\r\nwound among embowered promontories and shores of emerald verdure that\r\nseemed to melt into the wave. A character of gentleness and mild fertility\r\nprevailed around. The sun had just descended, and the thin haze of\r\ntwilight, like a transparent veil drawn over the bosom of virgin beauty,\r\nheightened the charms which it half concealed.\r\n\r\nAh! witching scenes of foul delusion! Ah! hapless voyagers, gazing with\r\nsimple wonder on these Circean shores! Such, alas! are they, poor easy\r\nsouls, who listen to the seductions of a wicked world; treacherous are its\r\nsmiles, fatal its caresses! He who yields to its enticements launches upon\r\na whelming tide, and trusts his feeble bark among the dimpling eddies of a\r\nwhirlpool! And thus it fared with the worthies of Pavonia, who, little\r\nmistrusting the guileful sense before them, drifted quietly on, until they\r\nwere aroused by an uncommon tossing and agitation of their vessels. For\r\nnow the late dimpling current began to brawl around them, and the waves to\r\nboil and foam with horrible fury. Awakened as if from a dream, the\r\nastonished Oloffe bawled aloud to put about, but his words were lost amid\r\nthe roaring of the waters. And now ensued a scene of direful\r\nconsternation. At one time they were borne with dreadful velocity among\r\ntumultuous breakers; at another, hurried down boisterous rapids. Now they\r\nwere nearly dashed upon the Hen and Chickens (infamous rocks! more\r\nvoracious than Scylla and her whelps!); and anon they seemed sinking into\r\nyawning gulfs, that threatened to entomb them beneath the waves. All the\r\nelements combined to produce a hideous confusion. The waters raged--the\r\nwinds howled--and as they were hurried along several of the astonished\r\nmariners beheld the rocks and trees of the neighboring shores driving\r\nthrough the air!\r\n\r\nAt length the mighty tub of Commodore Van Kortlandt was drawn into the\r\nvortex of that tremendous whirlpool called the Pot, where it was whirled\r\nabout in giddy mazes, until the senses of the good commander and his crew\r\nwere overpowered by the horror of the scene, and the strangeness of the\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nHow the gallant squadron of Pavonia was snatched from the jaws of this\r\nmodern Charybdis has never been truly made known, for so many survived to\r\ntell the tale, and, what is still more wonderful, told it in so many\r\ndifferent ways, that there has ever prevailed a great variety of opinions\r\non the subject.\r\n\r\nAs to the commodore and his crew, when they came to their senses they\r\nfound themselves stranded on the Long Island shore. The worthy commodore,\r\nindeed, used to relate many and wonderful stories of his adventures in\r\nthis time of peril; how that he saw specters flying in the air, and heard\r\nthe yelling of hobgoblins, and put his hand into the pot when they were\r\nwhirled round, and found the water scalding hot, and beheld several\r\nuncouth-looking beings seated on rocks and skimming it with huge ladles;\r\nbut particularly he declared with great exultation, that he saw the losel\r\nporpoises, which had betrayed them into this peril, some broiling on the\r\nGridiron, and others hissing on the Frying-pan!\r\n\r\nThese, however, were considered by many as mere phantasies of the\r\ncommodore, while he lay in a trance, especially as he was known to be\r\ngiven to dreaming; and the truth of them has never been clearly\r\nascertained. It is certain, however, that to the accounts of Oloffe and\r\nhis followers may be traced the various traditions handed down of this\r\nmarvelous strait--as how the devil has been seen there, sitting astride of\r\nthe Hog's Back and playing on the fiddle--how he broils fish there before\r\na storm; and many other stories, in which we must be cautious of putting\r\ntoo much faith. In consequence of all these terrific circumstances, the\r\nPavonian commander gave this pass the name of Helle-gat, or, as it has\r\nbeen interpreted, Hell-gate;[30] which it continues to bear at the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [27] It is a matter long since established by certain of our\r\n        philosophers, that is to say, having been often advanced and\r\n        never contradicted, it has grown to be pretty nigh equal to a\r\n        settled fact, that the Hudson was originally a lake dammed up by\r\n        the mountains of the Highlands. In process of time, however,\r\n        becoming very mighty and obstreperous, and the mountains waxing\r\n        pursy, dropsical, and weak in the back, by reason of their\r\n        extreme old age, it suddenly rose upon them, and after a violent\r\n        struggle effected its escape. This is said to have come to pass\r\n        in very remote time, probably before that rivers had lost the art\r\n        of running up hill. The foregoing is a theory in which I do not\r\n        pretend to be skilled, not withstanding that I do fully give it\r\n        my belief.\r\n\r\n   [28] A promontory in the Highlands.\r\n\r\n   [29] Properly spelt Hoeck (i.e. a point of land).\r\n\r\n   [30] This is a narrow strait in the Sound, at the distance of six\r\n        miles above New York. It is dangerous to shipping, unless under\r\n        the care of skillful pilots, by reason of numerous rocks,\r\n        shelves, and whirlpools. These have received sundry appellations,\r\n        such as the Gridiron, Frying-pan, Hog's Back, Pot, etc., and are\r\n        very violent and turbulent at certain times of tide. Certain\r\n        mealy-mouthed men, of squeamish consciences, who are loth to give\r\n        the devil his due, have softened the above characteristic name\r\n        into Hell-gate, forsooth! Let those take care how they venture\r\n        into the Gate, or they may be hurled into the Pot before they are\r\n        aware of it. The name of this strait, as given by our author, is\r\n        supported by the map of Vander Donck's history, published in\r\n        1656--by Ogilvie's History of America, 1671--as also by a journal\r\n        still extant, written in the sixteenth century, and to be found\r\n        in Hazard's State Papers. And an old MS, written in French,\r\n        speaking of various alterations, in names about this city,\r\n        observes, \"De Hellegat, trou d'Enfer, ils ont fait Hell-gate,\r\n        porte d'Enfer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe darkness of night had closed upon this disastrous day, and a doleful\r\nnight was it to the shipwrecked Pavonians, whose ears were incessantly\r\nassailed with the raging of the elements, and the howling of the\r\nhobgoblins that infested this perfidious strait. But when the morning\r\ndawned the horrors of the preceding evening had passed away, rapids,\r\nbreakers and whirlpools had disappeared, the stream again ran smooth and\r\ndimpling, and having changed its tide, rolled gently back towards the\r\nquarter where lay their much regretted home.\r\n\r\nThe woebegone heroes of Communipaw eyed each other with rueful\r\ncountenances; their squadrons had been totally dispersed by the late\r\ndisaster. Some were cast upon the western shore, where, headed by one\r\nRuleff Hopper, they took possession of all the country lying about the\r\nsix-mile-stone, which is held by the Hoppers at this present writing.\r\n\r\nThe Waldrons were driven by stress of weather to a distant coast, where,\r\nhaving with them a jug of genuine Hollands, they were enabled to\r\nconciliate the savages, setting up a kind of tavern; whence, it is said,\r\ndid spring the fair town of Haerlem, in which their descendants have ever\r\nsince continued to be reputable publicans. As to the Suydams, they were\r\nthrown upon the Long Island coast, and may still be found in those parts.\r\nBut the most singular luck attended the great Ten Broeck, who, falling\r\noverboard, was miraculously preserved from sinking by the multitude of his\r\nnether garments. Thus buoyed up, he floated on the waves like a merman, or\r\nlike an angler's dobber, until he landed safely on a rock, where he was\r\nfound the next morning busily drying his many breeches in the sunshine.\r\n\r\nI forbear to treat of the long consultation of Oloffe with his remaining\r\nfollowers, in which they determined that it would never do to found a city\r\nin so diabolical a neighborhood. Suffice it in simple brevity to say, that\r\nthey once more committed themselves, with fear and trembling, to the briny\r\nelement, and steered their course back again through the scenes of their\r\nyesterday's voyage, determined no longer to roam in search of distant\r\nsites, but to settle themselves down in the marshy regions of Pavonia.\r\n\r\nScarce, however, had they gained a distant view of Communipaw, when they\r\nwere encountered by an obstinate eddy, which opposed their homeward\r\nvoyage. Weary and dispirited as they were, they yet tugged a feeble oar\r\nagainst the stream; until, as if to settle the strife, half a score of\r\npotent billows rolled the tub of Commodore Van Kortlandt high and dry on\r\nthe long point of an island which divided the bosom of the bay.\r\n\r\nSome pretend that these billows were sent by old Neptune to strand the\r\nexpedition on a spot whereon was to be founded his stronghold in this\r\nwestern world; others, more pious, attribute everything to the\r\nguardianship of the good St. Nicholas; and after events will be found to\r\ncorroborate this opinion. Oloffe Van Kortlandt was a devout trencherman.\r\nEvery repast was a kind of religious rite with him; and his first thought\r\non finding him once more on dry ground was how he should contrive to\r\ncelebrate his wonderful escape from Hell-gate and all its horrors by a\r\nsolemn banquet. The stores which had been provided for the voyage by the\r\ngood housewives of Communipaw were nearly exhausted; but in casting his\r\neyes about the commodore beheld that the shore abounded with oysters. A\r\ngreat store of these was instantly collected; a fire was made at the foot\r\nof a tree; all hands fell to roasting, and broiling, and stewing, and\r\nfrying, and a sumptuous repast was soon set forth. This is thought to be\r\nthe origin of those civic feasts with which, to the present day, all our\r\npublic affairs are celebrated, and in which the oyster is ever sure to\r\nplay an important part.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion the worthy Van Kortlandt was observed to be\r\nparticularly zealous in his devotions to the trencher; for having the\r\ncares of the expedition especially committed to his care he deemed it\r\nincumbent on him to eat profoundly for the public good. In proportion as\r\nhe filled himself to the very brim with the dainty viands before him did\r\nthe heart of this excellent burgher rise up towards his throat, until he\r\nseemed crammed and almost choked with good eating and good nature. And at\r\nsuch times it is, when a man's heart is in his throat, that he may more\r\ntruly be said to speak from it, and his speeches abound with kindness and\r\ngood fellowship. Thus, having swallowed the last possible morsel, and\r\nwashed it down with a fervent potation, Oloffe felt his heart yearning,\r\nand his whole frame in a manner dilating with unbounded benevolence.\r\nEverything around him seemed excellent and delightful; and laying his\r\nhands on each side of his capacious periphery, and rolling his half-closed\r\neyes around on the beautiful diversity of land and water before him, he\r\nexclaimed, in a fat, half-smothered voice, \"What a charming prospect!\" The\r\nwords died away in his throat--he seemed to ponder on the fair scene for a\r\nmoment--his eyelids heavily closed over their orbs--his head drooped upon\r\nhis bosom--he slowly sank upon the green turf, and a deep sleep stole\r\ngradually over him.\r\n\r\nAnd the sage Oloffe dreamed a dream--and, lo! the good St. Nicholas came\r\nriding over the tops of the trees, in that self-same wagon wherein he\r\nbrings his yearly presents to children. And he descended hard by where the\r\nheroes of Communipaw had made their late repast. And he lit his pipe by\r\nthe fire, and sat himself down and smoked; and as he smoked the smoke from\r\nhis pipe ascended into the air, and spread like a cloud overhead. And\r\nOloffe bethought him, and he hastened and climbed up to the top of one of\r\nthe tallest trees, and saw that the smoke spread over a great extent of\r\ncountry--and as he considered it more attentively he fancied that the\r\ngreat volume of smoke assumed a variety of marvelous forms, where in dim\r\nobscurity he saw shadowed out palaces and domes and lofty spires, all of\r\nwhich lasted but a moment, and then faded away, until the whole rolled\r\noff, and nothing but the green woods were left. And when St. Nicholas had\r\nsmoked his pipe he twisted it in his hatband, and laying his finger beside\r\nhis nose, gave the astonished Van Kortlandt a very significant look, then\r\nmounting his wagon, he returned over the treetops and disappeared.\r\n\r\nAnd Van Kortlandt awoke from his sleep greatly instructed, and he aroused\r\nhis companions, and related to them his dream, and interpreted it that it\r\nwas the will of St. Nicholas that they should settle down and build the\r\ncity here; and that the smoke of the pipe was a type how vast would be\r\nthe extent of the city, inasmuch as the volumes of its smoke would spread\r\nover a wide extent of country. And they all with one voice assented to\r\nthis interpretation excepting Mynheer Ten Broeck, who declared the meaning\r\nto be that it would be a city wherein a little fire would occasion a great\r\nsmoke, or, in other words, a very vaporing little city--both which\r\ninterpretations have strangely come to pass!\r\n\r\nThe great object of their perilous expedition, therefore, being thus\r\nhappily accomplished, the voyagers returned merrily to Communipaw, where\r\nthey were received with great rejoicings. And here calling a general\r\nmeeting of all the wise men and the dignitaries of Pavonia, they related\r\nthe whole history of their voyage, and of the dream of Oloffe Van\r\nKortlandt. And the people lifted up their voices and blessed the good St.\r\nNicholas, and from that time forth the sage Van Kortlandt was held in more\r\nhonor than ever, for his great talent at dreaming, and was pronounced a\r\nmost useful citizen, and a right good man--when he was asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe original name of the island whereon the squadron of Communipaw was\r\nthus propitiously thrown is a matter of some dispute, and has already\r\nundergone considerable vitiation--a melancholy proof of the instability of\r\nall sublunary things, and the vanity of all our hopes of lasting fame; for\r\nwho can expect his name will live to posterity, when even the names of\r\nmighty islands are thus soon lost in contradiction and uncertainty!\r\n\r\nThe name most current at the present day, and which is likewise\r\ncountenanced by the great historian Vander Donck, is Manhattan, which is\r\nsaid to have originated in a custom among the squaws, in the early\r\nsettlement, of wearing men's hats, as is still done among many tribes.\r\n\"Hence,\" as we are told by an old governor, who was somewhat of a wag, and\r\nflourished almost a century since, and had paid a visit to the wits of\r\nPhiladelphia, \"hence arose the appellation of man-hat-on, first given to\r\nthe Indians, and afterwards to the island\"--a stupid joke!--but well\r\nenough for a governor.\r\n\r\nAmong the more venerable sources of information on this subject is that\r\nvaluable history of the American possessions, written by Master Richard\r\nBlome, in 1687, wherein it is called the Manhadaes and Manahanent; nor\r\nmust I forget the excellent little book, full of precious matter, of that\r\nauthentic historian, John Josselyn, gent., who expressly calls it\r\nManadaes.\r\n\r\nAnother etymology still more ancient, and sanctioned by the countenance of\r\nour ever to be lamented Dutch ancestors, is that found in certain letters,\r\nstill extant,[31] which passed between the early governors and their\r\nneighboring powers, wherein it is called indifferently Monhattoes,\r\nMunhatos, and Manhattoes, which are evidently unimportant variations of\r\nthe same name; for our wise forefathers set little store by those\r\nniceties, either in orthography or orthoepy, which form the sole study and\r\nambition of many learned men and women of this hypercritical age. This\r\nlast name is said to be derived from the great Indian spirit Manetho, who\r\nwas supposed to make this island his favorite abode, on account of its\r\nuncommon delights. For the Indian traditions affirm that the bay was once\r\na translucid lake, filled with silver and golden fish, in the midst of\r\nwhich lay this beautiful island, covered with every variety of fruits and\r\nflowers, but that the sudden irruption of the Hudson laid waste these\r\nblissful scenes, and Manetho took his flight beyond the great waters of\r\nOntario.\r\n\r\nThese, however, are very fabulous legends, to which very cautious\r\ncredence must be given; and though I am willing to admit the last quoted\r\northography of the name as very fit for prose, yet is there another which\r\nI peculiarly delight in, as at once poetical, melodious, and\r\nsignificant--and which we have on the authority of Master Juet, who, in\r\nhis account of the voyage of the great Hudson, calls this Manna-hata--that\r\nis to say, the island of manna--or, in other words, a land flowing with\r\nmilk and honey.\r\n\r\nStill my deference to the learned obliges me to notice the opinion of the\r\nworthy Dominie Heckwelder, which ascribes the name to a great drunken\r\nbout, held on the island by the Dutch discoverers, whereat they made\r\ncertain of the natives most ecstatically drunk for the first time in their\r\nlives; who, being delighted with their jovial entertainment, gave the\r\nplace the name of Mannahattanink--that is to say, the Island of Jolly\r\nTopers--a name which it continues to merit to the present day.[32]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [31] Vide Hazard's Col. Stat. Pap.\r\n\r\n   [32] MSS. of the Rev. John Heckwelder, in the archives of the New\r\n        York Historical Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt having been solemnly resolved that the seat of empire should be removed\r\nfrom the green shores of Pavonia to the pleasant island of Manna-hata,\r\neverybody was anxious to embark under the standard of Oloffe the Dreamer,\r\nand to be among the first sharers of the promised land. A day was\r\nappointed for the grand migration, and on that day little Communipaw as in\r\na buzz and a bustle like a hive in swarming time. Houses were turned\r\ninside out, and stripped of the venerable furniture which had come from\r\nHolland; all the community, great and small, black and white, man, woman,\r\nand child, was in commotion, forming lines from the houses to the water\r\nside, like lines of ants from an ant-hill; everybody laden with some\r\narticle of household furniture; while busy housewifes plied backwards and\r\nforwards along the lines, helping everything forward by the nimbleness of\r\ntheir tongues.\r\n\r\nBy degrees a fleet of boats and canoes were piled up with all kinds of\r\nhousehold articles; ponderous tables; chests of drawers, resplendent with\r\nbrass ornaments, quaint corner cupboards; beds and bedsteads; with any\r\nquantity of pots, kettles, frying-pans, and Dutch ovens. In each boat\r\nembarked a whole family, from the robustious burgher down to the cats and\r\ndogs and little negroes. In this way they set off across the mouth of the\r\nHudson, under the guidance of Oloffe the Dreamer, who hoisted his standard\r\non the leading boat.\r\n\r\nThis memorable migration took place on the first of May, and was long\r\ncited in tradition as the grand moving. The anniversary of it was piously\r\nobserved among the \"sons of the pilgrims of Communipaw,\" by turning their\r\nhouses topsy-turvy, and carrying all the furniture through the streets, in\r\nemblem of the swarming of the parent hive; and this is the real origin of\r\nthe universal agitation and \"moving\" by which this most restless of cities\r\nis literally turned out of doors on every May-day.\r\n\r\nAs the little squadron from Communipaw drew near to the shores of\r\nManna-hata, a sachem, at the head of a band of warriors, appeared to\r\noppose their landing. Some of the most zealous of the pilgrims were for\r\nchastising this insolence with the powder and ball, according to the\r\napproved mode of discoverers; but the sage Oloffe gave them the\r\nsignificant sign of St. Nicholas, laying his finger beside his nose and\r\nwinking hard with one eye; whereupon his followers perceived that there\r\nwas something sagacious in the wind. He now addressed the Indians in the\r\nblandest terms, and made such tempting display of beads, hawks's bells,\r\nand red blankets, that he was soon permitted to land, and a great land\r\nspeculation ensued. And here let me give the true story of the original\r\npurchase of the site of this renowned city, about which so much has been\r\nsaid and written. Some affirm that the first cost was, but sixty guilders.\r\nThe learned Dominie Heckwelder records a tradition[33] that the Dutch\r\ndiscoverers bargained for only so much land as the hide of a bullock would\r\ncover; but that they cut the hide in strips no thicker than a child's\r\nfinger, so as to take in a large portion of land, and to take in the\r\nIndians into the bargain This, however, is an old fable which the worthy\r\nDominie may have borrowed from antiquity. The true version is, that Oloffe\r\nVan Kortlandt bargained for just so much land as a man could cover with\r\nhis nether garments. The terms being concluded, he produced his friend\r\nMynheer Ten Broeck, as the man whose breeches were to be used in\r\nmeasurement. The simple savages, whose ideas of a man's nether garments\r\nhad never expanded beyond the dimensions of a breech clout, stared with\r\nastonishment and dismay as they beheld this bulbous-bottomed burgher\r\npeeled like an onion, and breeches after breeches spread forth over the\r\nland until they covered the actual site of this venerable city.\r\n\r\nThis is the true history of the adroit bargain by which the Island of\r\nManhattan was bought for sixty guilders; and in corroboration of it I will\r\nadd that Mynheer Ten Breeches, for his services on this memorable\r\noccasion, was elevated to the office of land measurer; which he ever\r\nafterwards exercised in the colony.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [33] MSS. of the Rev. John Heckwelder: New York Historical Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe land being thus fairly purchased of the Indians, a circumstance very\r\nunusual in the history of colonization, and strongly illustrative of the\r\nhonesty of our Dutch progenitors, a stockade fort and trading house were\r\nforthwith erected on an eminence in front of the place where the good St.\r\nNicholas had appeared in a vision to Oloffe the Dreamer; and which, as has\r\nalready been observed, was the identical place at present known as the\r\nBowling Green.\r\n\r\nAround this fort a progeny of little Dutch-built houses, with tiled roofs\r\nand weathercocks, soon sprang up, nestling themselves under its walls for\r\nprotection, as a brood of half-fledged chickens nestle under the wings of\r\nthe mother hen. The whole was surrounded by an enclosure of strong\r\npalisadoes, to guard against any sudden irruption of the savages. Outside\r\nof these extended the corn-fields and cabbage-gardens of the community,\r\nwith here and there an attempt at a tobacco plantation; all covering those\r\ntracts of country at present called Broadway, Wall Street, William Street,\r\nand Pearl Street, I must not omit to mention, that in portioning out the\r\nland a goodly \"bowerie\" or farm was allotted to the sage Oloffe, in\r\nconsideration of the service he had rendered to the public by his talent\r\nat dreaming; and the site of his \"bowerie\" is known by the name of\r\nKortlandt (or Cortland) Street to the present day.\r\n\r\nAnd now the infant settlement having advanced in age and stature, it was\r\nthought high time it should receive an honest Christian name. Hitherto it\r\nhad gone by the original Indian name of Manna-hata, or, as some will have\r\nit, \"The Manhattoes;\" but this was now decried as savage and heathenish,\r\nand as tending to keep up the memory of the pagan brood that originally\r\npossessed it. Many were the consultations held upon the subject without\r\ncoming to a conclusion, for though everybody condemned the old name,\r\nnobody could invent a new one. At length, when the council was almost in\r\ndespair, a burgher, remarkable for the size and squareness of his head,\r\nproposed that they should call it New Amsterdam. The proposition took\r\neverybody by surprise; it was so striking, so apposite, so ingenious. The\r\nname was adopted by acclamation, and New Amsterdam the metropolis was\r\nthenceforth called. Still, however, the early authors of the province\r\ncontinued to call it by the general appelation of \"The Manhattoes,\" and\r\nthe poets fondly clung to the euphonious name of Manna-hata; but those are\r\na kind of folk whose tastes and notions should go for nothing in matters\r\nof this kind.\r\n\r\nHaving thus provided the embryo city with a name, the next was to give it\r\nan armorial bearing or device, as some cities have a rampant lion, others\r\na soaring eagle; emblematical, no doubt, of the valiant and high-flying\r\nqualities of the inhabitants: so after mature deliberation a sleek beaver\r\nwas emblazoned on the city standard as indicative of the amphibious origin\r\nand patient persevering habits of the New Amsterdamers.\r\n\r\nThe thriving state of the settlement and the rapid increase of houses soon\r\nmade it necessary to arrange some plan upon which the city should be\r\nbuilt; but at the very first consultation on the subject a violent\r\ndiscussion arose; and I mention it with much sorrowing as being the first\r\naltercation on record in the councils of New Amsterdam. It was, in fact, a\r\nbreaking forth of the grudge and heart-burning that had existed between\r\nthose two eminent burghers, Mynheers Ten Broeck and Harden Broeck, ever\r\nsince their unhappy dispute on the coast of Bellevue. The great Harden\r\nBroeck had waxed very wealthy and powerful from his domains, which\r\nembraced the whole chain of Apulean mountains that stretched along the\r\ngulf of Kip's Bay, and from part of which his descendants have been\r\nexpelled in latter ages by the powerful clans of the Joneses and the\r\nSchermerhornes.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious plan for the city was offered by Mynheer Harden Broeck, who\r\nproposed that it should be cut up and intersected by canals, after the\r\nmanner of the most admired cities in Holland. To this Mynheer Ten Broeck\r\nwas diametrically opposed, suggesting in place thereof that they should\r\nrun out docks and wharves, by means of piles driven into the bottom of the\r\nriver, on which the town should be built. \"By these means,\" said he,\r\ntriumphantly, \"shall we rescue a considerable space of territory from\r\nthese immense rivers, and build a city that shall rival Amsterdam, Venice,\r\nor any amphibious city in Europe.\" To this proposition Harden Broeck (or\r\nTough Breeches) replied, with a look of as much scorn as he could possibly\r\nassume. He cast the utmost censure upon the plan of his antagonist, as\r\nbeing preposterous, and against the very order of things, as he would\r\nleave to every true Hollander. \"For what,\" said he, \"is a town without\r\ncanals?--it is like a body without veins and arteries, and must perish for\r\nwant of a free circulation of the vital fluid.\"--Ten Breeches, on the\r\ncontrary, retorted with a sarcasm upon his antagonist, who was somewhat of\r\nan arid, dry-boded habit; he remarked, that as to the circulation of the\r\nblood being necessary to existence, Mynheer Tough Breeches was a living\r\ncontradiction to his own assertion; for everybody knew there had not a\r\ndrop of blood circulated through his wind-dried carcase for good ten\r\nyears, and yet there was not a greater busybody in the whole colony.\r\nPersonalities have seldom much effect in making converts in argument; nor\r\nhave I ever seen a man convinced of error by being convicted of deformity.\r\nAt least such was not the case at present. If Ten Breeches was very happy\r\nin sarcasm, Tough Breeches, who was a sturdy little man, and never gave up\r\nthe last word, rejoined with increasing spirit; Ten Breeches had the\r\nadvantage of the greatest volubility, but Tough Breeches had that\r\ninvaluable coat of mail in argument called obstinacy; Ten Breeches had,\r\ntherefore, the most mettle, but Tough Breeches the best bottom--so that\r\nthough Ten Breeches made a dreadful clattering about his ears, and\r\nbattered and belabored him with hard words and sound arguments, yet Tough\r\nBreeches hung on most resolutely to the last. They parted, therefore, as\r\nis usual in all arguments where both parties are in the right, without\r\ncoming to any conclusion; but they hated each other most heartily for ever\r\nafter, and a similar breach with that between the houses of Capulet and\r\nMontague did ensue between the families of Ten Breeches and Tough\r\nBreeches.\r\n\r\nI would not fatigue my reader with these dull matters of fact, but that my\r\nduty as a faithful historian requires that I should be particular; and, in\r\ntruth, as I am now treating of the critical period when our city, like a\r\nyoung twig, first received the twists and turns which have since\r\ncontributed to give it its present picturesque irregularity, I cannot be\r\ntoo minute in detailing their first causes.\r\n\r\nAfter the unhappy altercation I have just mentioned, I do not find that\r\nanything further was said on the subject worthy of being recorded. The\r\ncouncil, consisting of the largest and oldest heads in the community, met\r\nregularly once a week, to ponder on this momentous subject; but, either\r\nthey were deterred by the war of words they had witnessed, or they were\r\nnaturally averse to the exercise of the tongue, and the consequent\r\nexercise of the brains--certain it is, the most profound silence was\r\nmaintained--the question, as usual, lay on the table--the members quietly\r\nsmoked their pipes, making but few laws, without ever enforcing any, and\r\nin the meantime the affairs of the settlement went on--as it pleased God.\r\n\r\nAs most of the council were but little skilled in the mystery of\r\ncombining pot-hooks and hangers, they determined most judiciously not to\r\npuzzle either themselves or posterity with voluminous records. The\r\nsecretary, however, kept the minutes of the council with tolerable\r\nprecision, in a large vellum folio, fastened with massy brass clasps; the\r\njournal of each meeting consisted but of two lines, stating in Dutch that\r\n\"the council sat this day, and smoked twelve pipes on the affairs of the\r\ncolony.\" By which it appears that the first settlers did not regulate\r\ntheir time by hours, but pipes, in the same manner as they measure\r\ndistances in Holland at this very time; an admirably exact measurement, as\r\na pipe in the mouth of a true-born Dutchman is never liable to those\r\naccidents and irregularities that are continually putting our clocks out\r\nof order.\r\n\r\nIn this manner did the profound council of New Amsterdam smoke, and doze,\r\nand ponder, from week to week, month to month, and year to year, in what\r\nmanner they should construct their infant settlement; meanwhile the town\r\ntook care of itself, and, like a sturdy brat which is suffered to run\r\nabout wild, unshackled by clouts and bandages, and other abominations by\r\nwhich your notable nurses and sage old women cripple and disfigure the\r\nchildren of men, increased so rapidly in strength and magnitude, that\r\nbefore the honest burgomasters had determined upon a plan it was too late\r\nto put it in execution--whereupon they wisely abandoned the subject\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is something exceedingly delusive in thus looking back, through the\r\nlong vista of departed years, and catching a glimpse of the fairy realms\r\nof antiquity. Like a landscape melting into distance, they receive a\r\nthousand charms from their very obscurity, and the fancy delights to fill\r\nup their outlines with graces and excellences of its own creation. Thus\r\nloom on my imagination those happier days of our city, when as yet New\r\nAmsterdam was a mere pastoral town, shrouded in groves of sycamores and\r\nwillows, and surrounded by trackless forests and wide-spreading waters,\r\nthat seemed to shut out all the cares and vanities of a wicked world.\r\n\r\nIn those days did this embryo city present the rare and noble spectacle of\r\na community governed without laws; and thus being left to its own course,\r\nand the fostering care of Providence, increased as rapidly as though it\r\nhad been burdened with a dozen panniers full of those sage laws usually\r\nheaped on the backs of young cities--in order to make them grow. And in\r\nthis particular I greatly admire the wisdom and sound knowledge of human\r\nnature displayed by the sage Oloffe the Dreamer and his fellow\r\nlegislators. For my part, I have not so bad an opinion of mankind as many\r\nof my brother philosophers. I do not think poor human nature so sorry a\r\npiece of workmanship as they would make it out to be; and as far as I have\r\nobserved, I am fully satisfied that man, if left to himself, would about\r\nas readily go right as wrong. It is only this eternally sounding in his\r\nears that it is his duty to go right which makes him go the very reverse.\r\nThe noble independence of his nature revolts at this intolerable tyranny\r\nof law, and the perpetual interference of officious morality, which are\r\never besetting his path with finger-posts and directions to \"keep to the\r\nright, as the law directs;\" and like a spirited urchin, he turns directly\r\ncontrary, and gallops through mud and mire, over hedges and ditches,\r\nmerely to show that he is a lad of spirit, and out of his leading-strings.\r\nAnd these opinions are amply substantiated by what I have above said of\r\nour worthy ancestors; who never being be-preached and be-lectured, and\r\nguided and governed by statutes and laws and by-laws, as are their more\r\nenlightened descendants, did one and all demean themselves honestly and\r\npeaceably, out of pure ignorance, or, in other words--because they knew no\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nNor must I omit to record one of the earliest measures of this infant\r\nsettlement, inasmuch as it shows the piety of our forefathers, and that,\r\nlike good Christians, they were always ready to serve God, after they had\r\nfirst served themselves. Thus, having quietly settled themselves down, and\r\nprovided for their own comfort, they bethought themselves of testifying\r\ntheir gratitude to the great and good St. Nicholas, for his protecting\r\ncare in guiding them to this delectable abode. To this end they built a\r\nfair and goodly chapel within the fort, which they consecrated to his\r\nname; whereupon he immediately took the town of New Amsterdam under his\r\npeculiar patronage, and he has even since been, and I devoutly hope will\r\never be, the tutelar saint of this excellent city.\r\n\r\nAt this early period was instituted that pious ceremony, still religiously\r\nobserved in all our ancient families of the right breed, of hanging up a\r\nstocking in the chimney on St. Nicholas Eve; which stocking is always\r\nfound in the morning miraculously filled; for the good St. Nicholas has\r\never been a great giver of gifts, particularly to children.\r\n\r\nI am moreover told that there is a little legendary book somewhere extant,\r\nwritten in Low Dutch, which says that the image of this renowned saint,\r\nwhich whilom graced the bow-sprit of the Goede Vrouw, was elevated in\r\nfront of this chapel, in the center of what in modern days is called the\r\nBowling Green--on the very spot, in fact, where he appeared in vision to\r\nOloffe the Dreamer. And the legend further treats of divers miracles\r\nwrought by the mighty pipe which the saint held in his mouth; a whiff of\r\nwhich was a sovereign cure for an indigestion--an invaluable relic in this\r\ncolony of brave trenchermen. As however, in spite of the most diligent\r\nsearch, I cannot lay my hands upon this little book, I must confess that\r\nI entertain considerable doubt on the subject.\r\n\r\nThus benignly fostered by the good St. Nicholas, the infant city thrived\r\napace. Hordes of painted savages, it is true, still lurked about the\r\nunsettled parts of the island. The hunter still pitched his bower of skins\r\nand bark beside the rills that ran through the cool and shady glens, while\r\nhere and there might be seen, on some sunny knoll, a group of Indian\r\nwigwams whose smoke arose above the neighboring trees, and floated in the\r\ntransparent atmosphere. A mutual good-will, however, existed between these\r\nwandering beings and the burghers of New Amsterdam. Our benevolent\r\nforefathers endeavored as much as possible to ameliorate their situation,\r\nby giving them gin, rum, and glass beads, in exchange for their peltries;\r\nfor it seems the kind-hearted Dutchmen had conceived a great friendship\r\nfor their savage neighbors, on account of their being pleasant men to\r\ntrade with, and little skilled in the art of making a bargain.\r\n\r\nNow and then a crew of these half human sons of the forest would make\r\ntheir appearance in the streets of New Amsterdam, fantastically painted\r\nand decorated with beads and flaunting feathers, sauntering about with an\r\nair of listless indifference--sometimes in the marketplace, instructing\r\nthe little Dutch boys in the use of the bow and arrow--at other times,\r\ninflamed with liquor, swaggering, and whooping, and yelling about the town\r\nlike so many fiends, to the great dismay of all the good wives, who would\r\nhurry their children into the house, fasten the doors, and throw water\r\nupon the enemy from the garret windows. It is worthy of mention here that\r\nour forefathers were very particular in holding up these wild men as\r\nexcellent domestic examples--and for reasons that may be gathered from the\r\nhistory of Master Ogilby, who tells us that \"for the least offence the\r\nbridegroom soundly beats his wife and turns her out of doors, and marries\r\nanother, insomuch that some of them have every year a new wife.\" Whether\r\nthis awful example had any influence or not history does not mention; but\r\nit is certain that our grandmothers were miracles of fidelity and\r\nobedience.\r\n\r\nTrue it is that the good understanding between our ancestors and their\r\nsavage neighbors was liable to occasional interruptions, and I have heard\r\nmy grandmother, who was a very wise old woman, and well versed in the\r\nhistory of these parts, tell a long story of a winter's evening, about a\r\nbattle between the New-Amsterdammers and the Indians, which was known by\r\nthe name of the Peach War, and which took place near a peach orchard, in a\r\ndark glen, which for a long while went by the name of Murderer's Valley.\r\n\r\nThe legend of this sylvan war was long current among the nurses, old\r\nwives, and other ancient chroniclers of the place; but time and\r\nimprovement have almost obliterated both the tradition and the scene of\r\nbattle; for what was once the blood-stained valley is now in the center of\r\nthis populous city, and known by the name of Dey Street.\r\n\r\nI know not whether it was to this \"Peach War,\" and the acquisitions of\r\nIndian land which may have grown out of it, that we may ascribe the first\r\nseeds of the spirit of \"annexation\" which now began to manifest\r\nthemselves. Hitherto the ambition of the worthy burghers had been confined\r\nto the lovely island of Manna-hata; and Spiten Devil on the Hudson, and\r\nHell-gate on the Sound, were to them the pillars of Hercules, the _ne plus\r\nultra_ of human enterprise. Shortly after the Peach War however, a\r\nrestless spirit was observed among the New Amsterdammers, who began to\r\ncast wistful looks upon the wild lands of their Indian neighbors; for\r\nsomehow or other wild Indian land always looks greener in the eyes of\r\nsettlers than the land they occupy. It is hinted that Oloffe the Dreamer\r\nencouraged these notions; having, as has been shown, the inherent spirit\r\nof a land speculator, which had been wonderfully quickened and expanded\r\nsince he had become a landholder. Many of the common people, who had never\r\nbefore owned a foot of land, now began to be discontented with the town\r\nlots which had fallen to their shares; others who had snug farms and\r\ntobacco plantations found they had not sufficient elbow-room, and began to\r\nquestion the rights of the Indians to the vast regions they pretended to\r\nhold--while the good Oloffe indulged in magnificent dreams of foreign\r\nconquest and great patroonships in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nThe result of these dreams were certain exploring expeditions sent forth\r\nin various directions to \"sow the seeds of empire,\" as it was said. The\r\nearliest of these were conducted by Hans Reinier Oothout, an old navigator\r\nfamous for the sharpness of his vision, who could see land when it was\r\nquite out of sight to ordinary mortals, and who had a spy-glass covered\r\nwith a bit of tarpaulin, with which he could spy up the crookedest river,\r\nquite to its head waters. He was accompanied by Mynheer Ten Breeches, as\r\nland measurer, in case of any dispute with the Indians.\r\n\r\nWhat was the consequence of these exploring expeditions? In a little while\r\nwe find a frontier post or trading-house called Fort Nassau, established\r\nfar to the south on Delaware River; another called Fort Goed Hoop (or Good\r\nHope), on the Varsche or Fresh, or Connecticut River; and another called\r\nFort Aurania (now Albany) away up the Hudson River; while the boundaries\r\nof the province kept extending on every side, nobody knew whither, far\r\ninto the regions of Terra Incognita.\r\n\r\nOf the boundary feuds and troubles which the ambitious little province\r\nbrought upon itself by these indefinite expansions of its territory we\r\nshall treat at large in the after pages of this eventful history;\r\nsufficient for the present is it to say, that the swelling importance of\r\nthe Nieuw Nederlandts awakened the attention of the mother country, who,\r\nfinding it likely to yield much revenue and no trouble, began to take that\r\ninterest in its welfare which knowing people evince for rich relations.\r\n\r\nBut as this opens a new era in the fortunes of New Amsterdam I will here\r\nput an end to this second book of my history, and will treat of the\r\nmaternal policy of the mother country in my next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOK III._\r\n\r\nIN WHICH IS RECORDED THE GOLDEN REIGN OF WOUTER VAN TWILLER.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrievous and very much to be commiserated is the task of the feeling\r\nhistorian who writes the history of his native land. If it fell to his lot\r\nto be the recorder of calamity or crime, the mournful page is watered with\r\nhis tears--nor can he recall the most prosperous and blissful era without\r\na melancholy sigh at the reflection that it has passed away for ever! I\r\nknow not whether it be owing to an immoderate love for the simplicity of\r\nformer times, or to that certain tenderness of heart incident to all\r\nsentimental historians, but I candidly confess that I cannot look back on\r\nthe happier days of our city, which I now describe, without great\r\ndejection of spirits. With faltering hand do I withdraw the curtain of\r\noblivion that veils the modest merit of our venerable ancestors, and as\r\ntheir figures rise to my mental vision, humble myself before their mighty\r\nshades.\r\n\r\nSuch are my feelings when I revisit the family mansion of the\r\nKnickerbockers, and spend a lonely hour in the chamber where hang the\r\nportraits of my forefathers, shrouded in dust like the forms they\r\nrepresent. With pious reverence do I gaze on the countenances of those\r\nrenowned burghers who have preceded me in the steady march of\r\nexistence--whose sober and temperate blood now meanders through my veins,\r\nflowing slower and slower in its feeble conduits, until its current shall\r\nsoon be stopped for ever!\r\n\r\nThese I say to myself are but frail memorials of the mighty men who\r\nflourished in the days of the patriarchs: but who, alas! have long since\r\nsmouldered in that tomb towards which my steps are insensibly and\r\nirresistibly hastening. As I pace the darkened chamber, and lose myself in\r\nmelancholy musings, the shadowy images around me almost seem to steal once\r\nmore into existence, their countenances to assume the animation of\r\nlife--their eyes to pursue me in every movement! Carried away by the\r\ndelusions of fancy, I almost imagine myself surrounded by the shades of\r\nthe departed, and holding sweet converse with the worthies of antiquity!\r\nAh, hapless Diedrich! born in a degenerate age, abandoned to the\r\nbuffetings of fortune--a stranger and weary pilgrim in thy native\r\nland--blest with no weeping wife, nor family of helpless children; but\r\ndoomed to wander neglected through those crowded streets, and elbowed by\r\nforeign upstarts from those fair abodes where once thine ancestors held\r\nsovereign empire!\r\n\r\nLet me not, however, lose the historian in the man, nor suffer the doting\r\nrecollections of age to overcome me, while dwelling with fond garrulity on\r\nthe virtuous days of the patriarchs--on those sweet days of simplicity and\r\nease, which never more will dawn on the lovely island of Manna-hata.\r\n\r\nThese melancholy reflections have been forced from me by the growing\r\nwealth and importance of New Amsterdam, which, I plainly perceive, are to\r\ninvolve it in all kinds of perils and disasters. Already, as I observed at\r\nthe close of my last book, they had awakened the attention of the mother\r\ncountry. The usual mark of protection shown by mother countries to wealthy\r\ncolonies was forthwith manifested; a governor being sent out to rule over\r\nthe province, and squeeze out of it as much revenue as possible. The\r\narrival of a governor of course put an end to the protectorate of Oloffe\r\nthe Dreamer. He appears, however, to have dreamt to some purpose during\r\nhis sway, as we find him afterwards living as a patroon on a great landed\r\nestate on the banks of the Hudson, having virtually forfeited all right to\r\nhis ancient appellation of Kortlandt, or Lackland.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year of our Lord 1629 that Mynheer Wouter Van Twiller was\r\nappointed governor of the province of Nieuw Nederlands, under the\r\ncommission and control of their High Mightinesses the Lords States General\r\nof the United Netherlands and the privileged West India Company.\r\n\r\nThis renowned old gentleman arrived at New Amsterdam in the merry month of\r\nJune, the sweetest month in all the year; when Dan Apollo seems to dance\r\nup the transparent firmament--when the robin, the thrush, and a thousand\r\nother wanton songsters make the woods to resound with amorous ditties, and\r\nthe luxurious little boblicon revels among the clover blossoms of the\r\nmeadows--all which happy coincidence persuaded the old dames of New\r\nAmsterdam who were skilled in the art of foretelling events, that this was\r\nto be a happy and prosperous administration.\r\n\r\nThe renowned Wouter, or Walter, Van Twiller was descended from a long line\r\nof Dutch burgomasters, who had successively dozed away their lives, and\r\ngrown fat upon the bench of magistracy in Rotterdam; and who had empowered\r\nthemselves with such singular wisdom and propriety that they were never\r\neither heard or talked of--which, next to being universally applauded,\r\nshould be the object of ambition of all magistrates and rulers. There are\r\ntwo opposite ways by which some men make a figure in the world; one by\r\ntalking faster than they think, and the other by holding their tongues and\r\nnot thinking at all. By the first many a smatterer acquires the reputation\r\nof a man of quick parts; by the other many a dunderpate, like the owl, the\r\nstupidest of birds, comes to be considered the very type of wisdom. This,\r\nby the way, is a casual remark, which I would not for the universe have\r\nit thought I apply to Governor Van Twiller. It is true he was a man shut\r\nup within himself, like an oyster, and rarely spoke except in\r\nmonosyllables; but then it was allowed he seldom said a foolish thing. So\r\ninvincible was his gravity that he was never known to laugh, or even to\r\nsmile, through the whole course of a long and prosperous life. Nay, if a\r\njoke were uttered in his presence, that set light-minded hearers in a\r\nroar, it was observed to throw him into a state of perplexity. Sometimes\r\nhe would deign to inquire into the matter, and when, after much\r\nexplanation, the joke was made as plain as a pike-staff, he would continue\r\nto smoke his pipe in silence, and at length, knocking out the ashes, would\r\nexclaim, \"Well! I see nothing in all that to laugh about.\"\r\n\r\nWith all his reflective habits he never made up his mind on a subject. His\r\nadherents accounted for this by the astonishing magnitude of his ideas. He\r\nconceived every subject on so grand a scale that he had not room in his\r\nhead to turn it over and examine both sides of it. Certain it is that if\r\nany matter were propounded to him, on which ordinary mortals would rashly\r\ndetermine at first glance, he would put on a vague mysterious look, shake\r\nhis capacious head, smoke some time in profound silence, and at length\r\nobserve that \"he had his doubts about the matter;\" which gained him the\r\nreputation of a man slow of belief, and not easily imposed upon. What is\r\nmore, it gained him a lasting name, for to this habit of the mind has been\r\nattributed his surname of Twiller, which is said to be a corruption of the\r\noriginal Twijfler, or, in plain English, Doubter.\r\n\r\nThe person of this illustrious old gentleman was formed and proportioned,\r\nas though it had been moulded by the hands of some cunning Dutch statuary,\r\nas a model of majesty and lordly grandeur. He was exactly five feet six\r\ninches in height and six feet five inches in circumference. His head was\r\na perfect sphere, and of such stupendous dimensions, that Dame Nature,\r\nwith all her sex's ingenuity, would have been puzzled to construct a neck\r\ncapable of supporting it; wherefore, she wisely declined the attempt, and\r\nsettled it firmly on the top of his backbone; just between the shoulders.\r\nHis body was oblong and particularly capacious at bottom, which was wisely\r\nordered by Providence, seeing that he was a man of sedentary habits, and\r\nvery averse to the idle labor of walking.\r\n\r\nHis legs were short, but sturdy in proportion to the weight they had to\r\nsustain; so that, when erect, he had not a little the appearance of a beer\r\nbarrel on skids. His face, that infallible index of the mind, presented a\r\nvast expanse, unfurrowed by any of those lines and angles which disfigure\r\nthe human countenance with what is termed expression. Two small gray eyes\r\ntwinkled feebly in the midst, like two stars of lesser magnitude in a hazy\r\nfirmament; and his full-fed cheeks, which seemed to have taken toll of\r\neverything that went into his mouth, were curiously mottled and streaked\r\nwith dusky red, like a Spitzenberg apple.\r\n\r\nHis habits were as regular as his person. He daily took his four stated\r\nmeals; appropriating exactly an hour to each; he smoked and doubted eight\r\nhours, and he slept the remaining twelve of the four-and-twenty. Such was\r\nthe renowned Wouter Van Twiller--a true philosopher, for his mind was\r\neither elevated above, or tranquilly settled below, the cares and\r\nperplexities of this world. He had lived in it for years, without feeling\r\nthe least curiosity to know whether the sun revolved round it, or it round\r\nthe sun; and he had watched for at least half century the smoke curling\r\nfrom his pipe to the ceiling, without once troubling his head with any of\r\nthose numerous theories by which a philosopher would have perplexed his\r\nbrain in accounting for its rising above the surrounding atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn his council he presided with great state and solemnity. He sat in a\r\nhuge chair of solid oak, hewn in the celebrated forest of the Hague,\r\nfabricated by an experienced timmerman of Amsterdam, and curiously carved\r\nabout the arms and feet into exact imitations of gigantic eagle's claws.\r\nInstead of a scepter he swayed a long Turkish pipe, wrought with jasmin\r\nand amber, which had been presented to a stadtholder of Holland, at the\r\nconclusion of a treaty, with one of the petty Barbary Powers. In this\r\nstately chair would he sit, and this magnificent pipe would he smoke,\r\nshaking his right knee with a constant motion, and fixing his eye for\r\nhours together upon a little print of Amsterdam, which hung in a black\r\nframe against the opposite wall of the council chamber. Nay, it has even\r\nbeen said, that when any deliberation of extraordinary length and\r\nintricacy was on the carpet, the renowned Wouter would shut his eyes for\r\nfull two hours at a time, that he might not be disturbed by external\r\nobjects--and at such times the internal commotion of his mind was evinced\r\nby certain regular guttural sounds, which his admirers declared were\r\nmerely the noise of conflict made by his contending doubts and opinions.\r\n\r\nIt is with infinite difficulty I have been enabled to collect these\r\nbiographical anecdotes of the great man under consideration. The facts\r\nrespecting him were so scattered and vague, and divers of them so\r\nquestionable in point of authenticity, that I have had to give up the\r\nsearch after many, and decline the admission of still more, which would\r\nhave tended to heighten the coloring of his portrait.\r\n\r\nI have been the more anxious to delineate fully the person and habits of\r\nWouter Van Twiller, from the consideration that he was not only the first,\r\nbut also the best governor, that ever presided over this ancient and\r\nrespectable province; and so tranquil and benevolent was his reign, that I\r\ndo not find throughout the whole of it a single instance of any offender\r\nbeing brought to punishment--a most indubitable sign of a merciful\r\ngovernor, and a case unparalleled, excepting in the reign of the\r\nillustrious King Log, from whom, it is hinted, the renowned Van Twiller\r\nwas a lineal descendant.\r\n\r\nThe very outset of the career of this excellent magistrate was\r\ndistinguished by an example of legal acumen, that gave flattering presage\r\nof a wise and equitable administration. The morning after he had been\r\ninstalled in office, and at the moment that he was making his breakfast\r\nfrom a prodigious earthen dish, filled with milk and Indian pudding, he\r\nwas interrupted by the appearance of Wandle Schoonhoven, a very important\r\nold burgher of New Amsterdam, who complained bitterly of one Barent\r\nBleecker, inasmuch as he refused to come to a settlement of accounts,\r\nseeing that there was a heavy balance in favor of the said Wandle.\r\nGovernor Van Twiller, as I have already observed, was a man of few words;\r\nhe was likewise a mortal enemy to multiplying writings, or being disturbed\r\nat his breakfast. Having listened attentively to the statement of Wandle\r\nSchoonhoven, giving an occasional grunt, as he shoveled a spoonful of\r\nIndian pudding into his mouth--either as a sign that he relished the dish\r\nor comprehended the story--he called unto his constable, and pulling out\r\nof his breeches proper a huge jack-knife, dispatched it after the\r\ndefendant as a summons, accompanied by his tobacco box as a warrant.\r\n\r\nThis summary process was as effectual in those simple days as was the seal\r\nring of the great Haroun Alraschid among the true believers. The two\r\nparties being confronted before him, each produced a book of accounts,\r\nwritten in a language and character that would have puzzled any but a High\r\nDutch commentator, or a learned decipherer of Egyptian obelisks. The sage\r\nWouter took them one after the other, and having poised them in his hands,\r\nand attentively counted over the number of leaves, fell straightway into a\r\nvery great doubt, and smoked for half an hour without saying a word; at\r\nlength, laying his finger beside his nose, and shutting his eyes for a\r\nmoment, with the air of a man who has just caught a subtle idea by the\r\ntail, he slowly took his pipe from his mouth, puffed forth a column of\r\ntobacco smoke, and with marvelous gravity and solemnity pronounced--that\r\nhaving carefully counted over the leaves and weighed the books, it was\r\nfound that one was just as thick and as heavy as the other--therefore, it\r\nwas the final opinion of the court that the accounts were equally\r\nbalanced--therefore, Wandle should give Barent a receipt, and Barent\r\nshould give Wandle a receipt--and the constable should pay the costs.\r\n\r\nThis decision being straightway made known, diffused general joy\r\nthroughout New Amsterdam, for the people immediately perceived that they\r\nhad a very wise and equitable magistrate to rule over them. But its\r\nhappiest effect was, that not another lawsuit took place throughout the\r\nwhole of his administration--and the office of constable fell into such\r\ndecay, that there was not one of those losel scouts known in the province\r\nfor many years. I am the more particular in dwelling on this transaction,\r\nnot only because I deem it one of the most sage and righteous judgments on\r\nrecord, and well worthy the attention of modern magistrates, but because\r\nit was a miraculous event in the history of the renowned Wouter, being the\r\nonly time he was ever known to come to a decision in the whole course of\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn treating of the early governors of the province I must caution my\r\nreaders against confounding them, in point of dignity and power, with\r\nthose worthy gentlemen who are whimsically denominated governors in this\r\nenlightened republic--a set of unhappy victims of popularity, who are in\r\nfact the most dependent, henpecked beings in the community, doomed to\r\nbear the secret goadings and corrections of their own party, and the\r\nsneers and revilings of the whole world beside--set up, like geese at\r\nChristmas holidays, to be pelted and shot at by every whipster and\r\nvagabond in the land. On the contrary, the Dutch governors enjoyed that\r\nuncontrolled authority, vested in all commanders of distant colonies or\r\nterritories. They were in a manner absolute despots in their little\r\ndomains, lording it, if so disposed, over both law and gospel, and\r\naccountable to none but the mother-country; which, it is well known, is\r\nastonishingly deaf to all complaints against its governors, provided they\r\ndischarge the main duty of their station--squeezing out a good revenue.\r\nThis hint will be of importance to prevent my readers from being seized\r\nwith doubt and incredulity, whenever, in the course of this authentic\r\nhistory, they encounter the uncommon circumstance of a governor acting\r\nwith independence, and in opposition to the opinions of the multitude.\r\n\r\nTo assist the doubtful Wouter in the arduous business of legislation, a\r\nboard of magistrates was appointed, which presided immediately over the\r\npolice. This potent body consisted of a schout, or bailiff, with powers\r\nbetween those of the present mayor and sheriff--five burgermeesters, who\r\nwere equivalent to aldermen, and five schepens, who officiated as scrubs,\r\nsub-devils, or bottle-holders to the burgermeesters, in the same manner as\r\ndo assistant aldermen to their principals at the present day; it being\r\ntheir duty to fill the pipes of the lordly burgermeesters, hunt the\r\nmarkets for delicacies for corporation dinners, and to discharge such\r\nother little offices of kindness as were occasionally required. It was,\r\nmoreover, tacitly understood, though not specifically enjoined, that they\r\nshould consider themselves as butts for the blunt wits of the\r\nburgermeesters, and should laugh most heartily at all their jokes; but\r\nthis last was a duty as rarely called in action in those days as it is at\r\npresent, and was shortly remitted, in consequence of the tragical death of\r\na fat little schepen, who actually died of suffocation in an unsuccessful\r\neffort to force a laugh at one of burgermeester Van Zandt's best jokes.\r\n\r\nIn return for these humble services, they were permitted to say \"yes\" and\r\n\"no\" at the council-board, and to have that enviable privilege, the run of\r\nthe public kitchen--being graciously permitted to eat, and drink, and\r\nsmoke, at all those snug junketing and public gormandisings, for which the\r\nancient magistrates were equally famous with their modern successors. The\r\npost of schepen, therefore, like that of assistant alderman, was eagerly\r\ncoveted by all your burghers of a certain description, who have a huge\r\nrelish for good feeding, and an humble ambition to be great men in a small\r\nway--who thirst after a little brief authority, that shall render them the\r\nterror of the almshouse and the bridewell--that shall enable them to lord\r\nit over obsequious poverty, vagrant vice, outcast prostitution, and\r\nhunger-driven dishonesty--that shall give to their beck a hound-like pack\r\nof catshpolls and bumbailiffs--tenfold greater rogues than the culprits\r\nthey hunt down! My readers will excuse this sudden warmth, which I confess\r\nis unbecoming of a grave historian; but I have a mortal antipathy to\r\ncatchpolls, bumbailiffs, and little great men.\r\n\r\nThe ancient magistrates of this city corresponded with those of the\r\npresent time no less in form, magnitude, and intellect, than in\r\nprerogative and privilege. The burgomasters, like our aldermen, were\r\ngenerally chosen by weight--and not only the weight of the body, but\r\nlikewise the weight of the head. It is a maxim practically observed in all\r\nhonest, plain-thinking, regular cities, that an alderman should be fat;\r\nand the wisdom of this can be proved to a certainty. That the body is in\r\nsome measure an image of the mind, or rather that the mind is moulded to\r\nthe body, like melted lead to the clay in which it is cast, has been\r\ninsisted on by many philosophers, who have made human nature their\r\npeculiar study; for, as a learned gentleman of our own city observes,\r\n\"there is a constant relation between the moral character of all\r\nintelligent creatures, and their physical constitution--between their\r\nhabits and the structure of their bodies.\" Thus we see that a lean, spare,\r\ndiminutive body is generally accompanied by a petulant, restless, meddling\r\nmind; either the mind wears down the body, by its continual motion; or\r\nelse the body, not affording the mind sufficient house-room, keeps it\r\ncontinually in a state of fretfulness, tossing and worrying about from the\r\nuneasiness of its situation. Whereas your round, sleek, fat, unwieldly\r\nperiphery is ever attended by a mind like itself, tranquil, torpid, and at\r\nease; and we may alway observe, that your well-fed, robustious burghers\r\nare in general very tenacious of their ease and comfort; being great\r\nenemies to noise, discord, and disturbance--and surely none are more\r\nlikely to study the public tranquillity than those who are so careful of\r\ntheir own. Who ever hears of fat men heading a riot, or herding together\r\nin turbulent mobs! No--no--it is your lean, hungry men who are continually\r\nworrying society, and setting the whole community by the ears.\r\n\r\nThe divine Plato, whose doctrines are not sufficiently attended to by\r\nphilosophers of the present age, allows to every man three souls--one\r\nimmortal and rational, seated in the brain, that it may overlook and\r\nregulate the body; a second, consisting of the surly and irascible\r\npassions which, like belligerent powers, lie encamped around the heart; a\r\nthird, mortal and sensual, destitute of reason, gross and brutal in its\r\npropensities, and enchained in the belly, that it may not disturb the\r\ndivine soul by its ravenous howlings. Now, according to this excellent\r\ntheory, what can be more clear, than that your fat alderman is most\r\nlikely to have the most regular and well-conditioned mind. His head is\r\nlike a huge spherical chamber, containing a prodigious mass of soft\r\nbrains, whereon the rational soul lies softly and snugly couched, as on a\r\nfeather-bed; and the eyes which are the windows of the bedchamber, are\r\nusually half-closed, that its slumberings may not be disturbed by external\r\nobjects. A mind thus comfortably lodged, and protected from disturbance,\r\nis manifestly most like to perform its functions with regularly and ease.\r\nBy dint of good feeding, moreover, the mortal and malignant soul, which is\r\nconfined in the belly, and which, by its raging and roaring, puts the\r\nirritable soul in the neighborhood of the heart in an intolerable passion,\r\nand thus renders men crusty and quarrelsome when hungry, is completely\r\npacified, silenced, and put to rest; whereupon a host of honest,\r\ngood-fellow qualities and kind-hearted affections, which had lain perdue,\r\nslily peeping out of the loopholes of the heart, finding this Cerberus\r\nasleep, do pluck up their spirits, turn out one and all in their holiday\r\nsuits, and gambol up and down the diaphragm--disposing their possessor to\r\nlaughter, good humor, and a thousand friendly offices towards his\r\nfellow-mortals.\r\n\r\nAs a board of magistrates, formed on this principle, think but very\r\nlittle, they are the less likely to differ and wrangle about favorite\r\nopinions; and, as they generally transact business upon a hearty dinner,\r\nthey are naturally disposed to be lenient and indulgent in the\r\nadministration of their duties. Charlemagne was conscious of this, and\r\ntherefore ordered in his cartularies, that no judge should hold a court of\r\njustice except in the morning on an empty stomach. A pitiful rule which I\r\ncan never forgive, and which I warrant bore hard upon all the poor\r\nculprits in the kingdom. The more enlightened and humane generation of the\r\npresent day have taken an opposite course, and have so managed that the\r\nalderman are the best fed men in the community; feasting lustily on the\r\nfat things of the land, and gorging so heartily on oysters and turtles,\r\nthat in process of time they acquire the activity of the one, and the\r\nform, the waddle, and the green fat of the other. The consequence is, as I\r\nhave just said, these luxurious feastings do produce such a dulcet\r\nequanimity and repose of the soul, rational and irrational, that their\r\ntransactions are proverbial for unvarying monotony; and the profound laws\r\nwhich they enact in their dozing moments, amid the labors of digestion,\r\nare quietly suffered to remain as dead letters, and never enforced when\r\nawake. In a word, your fair, round-bellied burgomaster, like a full-fed\r\nmastiff, dozes quietly at the house-door, always at home, and always at\r\nhand to watch over its safety; but as to electing a lean, meddling\r\ncandidate to the office, as has now and then been done, I would as lief\r\nput a greyhound to watch the house, or a racehorse to draw an ox-wagon.\r\n\r\nThe burgomasters then, as I have already mentioned, were wisely chosen by\r\nweight, and the schepens, or assistant aldermen, were appointed to attend\r\nupon them, and help them eat; but the latter, in the course of time, when\r\nthey had been fed and fattened into sufficient bulk of body and drowsiness\r\nof brain, became very eligible candidates for the burgomasters' chairs,\r\nhaving fairly eaten themselves into office, as a mouse eats his way into a\r\ncomfortable lodgment in a goodly, blue-nosed, skimmed milk, New England\r\ncheese. Nothing could equal the profound deliberations that took place\r\nbetween the renowned Wouter and these his worthy compeers, unless it be\r\nthe sage divans of some of our modern corporations. They would sit for\r\nhours smoking and dozing over public affairs, without speaking a word to\r\ninterrupt that perfect stillness so necessary to deep reflection. Under\r\nthe sober sway of Wouter Van Twiller and these his worthy coadjutors, the\r\ninfant settlement waxed vigorous apace, gradually emerging from the swamps\r\nand forests, and exhibiting that mingled appearance of town and country\r\ncustomary in new cities, and which at this day may be witnessed in the\r\ncity of Washington; that immense metropolis, which makes so glorious an\r\nappearance on paper.\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasing sight in those times to behold the honest burgher, like\r\na patriarch of yore, seated on the bench at the door of his whitewashed\r\nhouse, under the shade of some gigantic sycamore or overhanging willow.\r\nHere would he smoke his pipe of a sultry afternoon, enjoying the soft\r\nsouthern breeze and listening with silent gratulation to the clucking of\r\nhis hens, the cackling of his geese, and the sonorous grunting of his\r\nswine; that combination of farmyard melody, which may truly be said to\r\nhave a silver sound, inasmuch as it conveys a certain assurance of\r\nprofitable marketing.\r\n\r\nThe modern spectator, who wanders through the streets of this populous\r\ncity, can scarcely form an idea of the different appearance they presented\r\nin the primitive days of the doubter. The busy hum of multitudes, the\r\nshouts of revelry, the rumbling equipages of fashion, the rattling of\r\naccursed carts, and all the spirit-grieving sounds of brawling commerce,\r\nwere unknown in the settlement of New Amsterdam. The grass grew quietly in\r\nthe highways--the bleating sheep and frolicksome calves sported about the\r\nverdant ridge, where now the Broadway loungers take their morning\r\nstroll--the cunning fox or ravenous wolf skulked in the woods, where now\r\nare to be seen the dens of Gomez and his righteous fraternity of\r\nmoney-brokers--and flocks of vociferous geese cackled about the fields,\r\nwhere now the great Tammany wigwam and the patriotic tavern of Martling\r\necho with the wranglings of the mob.\r\n\r\nIn these good times did a true and enviable equality of rank and property\r\nprevail, equally removed from the arrogance of wealth, and the servility\r\nand heart-burnings of repining poverty--and what in my mind is still more\r\nconducive to tranquillity and harmony among friends, a happy equality of\r\nintellect was likewise to be seen. The minds of the good burghers of New\r\nAmsterdam seemed all to have been cast in one mould, and to be those\r\nhonest, blunt minds, which, like certain manufactures, are made by the\r\ngross, and considered as exceedingly good for common use.\r\n\r\nThus it happens that your true dull minds are generally preferred for\r\npublic employ, and especially promoted to city honors; your keen\r\nintellects, like razors, being considered too sharp for common service. I\r\nknow that it is common to rail at the unequal distribution of riches, as\r\nthe great source of jealousies, broils, and heart-breakings; whereas, for\r\nmy part, I verily believe it is the sad inequality of intellect that\r\nprevails, that embroils communities more than anything else; and I have\r\nremarked that your knowing people, who are so much wiser than anybody\r\nelse, are eternally keeping society in a ferment. Happily for New\r\nAmsterdam, nothing of the kind was known within its walls--the very words\r\nof learning, education, taste, and talents were unheard of--a bright\r\ngenius was an animal unknown, and a blue-stocking lady would have been\r\nregarded with as much wonder as a horned frog or a fiery dragon. No man in\r\nfact seemed to know more than his neighbor, nor any man to know more than\r\nan honest man ought to know, who has nobody's business to mind but his\r\nown; the parson and the council clerk were the only men that could read in\r\nthe community, and the sage Van Twiller always signed his name with a\r\ncross.\r\n\r\nThrice happy and ever to be envied little burgh! existing in all the\r\nsecurity of harmless insignificance--unnoticed and unenvied by the world,\r\nwithout ambition, without vain-glory, without riches, without learning,\r\nand all their train of carking cares; and as of yore, in the better days\r\nof man, the deities were wont to visit him on earth and bless his rural\r\nhabitations, so we are told, in the sylvan days of New Amsterdam, the\r\ngood St. Nicholas would often make his appearance in his beloved city, of\r\na holiday afternoon, riding jollily among the treetops, or over the roofs\r\nof houses, now and then drawing forth magnificent presents from his\r\nbreeches pockets, and dropping them down the chimneys of his favorites.\r\nWhereas, in these degenerate days of iron and brass he never shows us the\r\nlight of his countenance, nor ever visits us, save one night in the year;\r\nwhen he rattles down the chimneys of the descendants of the patriarchs,\r\nconfining his presents merely to the children, in token of the degeneracy\r\nof the parents.\r\n\r\nSuch are the comfortable and thriving effects of a fat government. The\r\nprovince of the New Netherlands, destitute of wealth, possessed a sweet\r\ntranquillity that wealth could never purchase. There were neither public\r\ncommotions, nor private quarrels; neither parties, nor sects, nor schisms;\r\nneither persecutions, nor trials, nor punishments; nor were there\r\ncounsellors, attorneys, catchpolls, or hangmen. Every man attended to what\r\nlittle business he was lucky enough to have, or neglected it if he\r\npleased, without asking the opinion of his neighbor. In those days nobody\r\nmeddled with concerns above his comprehension, nor thrust his nose into\r\nother people's affairs, nor neglected to correct his own conduct and\r\nreform his own character, in his zeal to pull to pieces the characters of\r\nothers; but in a word, every respectable citizen ate when he was not\r\nhungry, drank when he was not thirsty, and went regularly to bed when the\r\nsun set and the fowls went to roost, whether he were sleepy or not; all\r\nwhich tended so remarkably to the population of the settlement, that I am\r\ntold every dutiful wife throughout New Amsterdam made a point of enriching\r\nher husband with at least one child a year, and very often a brace--this\r\nsuperabundance of good things clearly constituting the true luxury of\r\nlife, according to the favorite Dutch maxim, that \"more than enough\r\nconstitutes a feast.\" Everything, therefore, went on exactly as it should\r\ndo, and in the usual words employed by historians to express the welfare\r\nof a country, \"the profoundest tranquillity and repose reigned throughout\r\nthe province.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nManifold are the tastes and dispositions of the enlightened _literati_ who\r\nturn over the pages of history. Some there be whose hearts are brimful of\r\nthe yeast of courage, and whose bosoms do work, and swell, and foam with\r\nuntried valor, like a barrel of new cider, or a train-band captain fresh\r\nfrom under the hands of his tailor. This doughty class of readers can be\r\nsatisfied with nothing but bloody battles, and horrible encounters; they\r\nmust be continually storming forts, sacking cities, springing mines,\r\nmarching up to the muzzles of cannon, charging bayonet through every page,\r\nand revelling in gunpowder and carnage. Others, who are of a less martial,\r\nbut equally ardent imagination, and who, withal, are little given to the\r\nmarvelous, will dwell with wondrous satisfaction on descriptions of\r\nprodigies, unheard of events, hair-breadth escapes, hardy adventures, and\r\nall those astonishing narrations which just amble along the boundary line\r\nof possibility. A third class, who, not to speak slightly of them, are of\r\na lighter turn, and skim over the records of past times, as they do over\r\nthe edifying pages of a novel, merely for relaxation and innocent\r\namusement, do singularly delight in treasons, executions, Sabine rapes,\r\nTarquin outrages, conflagrations, murders, and all the other catalogues of\r\nhideous crimes, which, like cayenne in cookery, do give a pungency and\r\nflavor to the dull detail of history; while a fourth class, of more\r\nphilosophic habits, do diligently pore over the musty chronicles of time,\r\nto investigate the operations of the human kind, and watch the gradual\r\nchanges in men and manners, effected by the progress of knowledge, the\r\nvicissitudes of events, or the influence of situation.\r\n\r\nIf the three first classes find but little wherewithal to solace\r\nthemselves in the tranquil reign of Wouter Van Twiller, I entreat them to\r\nexert their patience for a while, and bear with the tedious picture of\r\nhappiness, prosperity, and peace, which my duty as a faithful historian\r\nobliges me to draw; and I promise them that as soon as I can possibly\r\nalight upon anything horrible, uncommon, or impossible, it shall go hard\r\nbut I will make it afford them entertainment. This being premised, I turn\r\nwith great complacency to the fourth class of my readers, who are men, or,\r\nif possible, women after my own heart; grave, philosophical, and\r\ninvestigating; fond of analyzing characters, of taking a start from first\r\ncauses, and so haunting a nation down, through all the mazes of innovation\r\nand improvement. Such will naturally be anxious to witness the first\r\ndevelopment of the newly-hatched colony, and the primitive manners and\r\ncustoms prevalent among its inhabitants, during the halcyon reign of Van\r\nTwiller, or the Doubter.\r\n\r\nI will not grieve their patience, however, by describing minutely the\r\nincrease and improvement of New Amsterdam. Their own imaginations will\r\ndoubtless present to them the good burghers, like so many painstaking and\r\npersevering beavers, slowly and surely pursuing their labors--they will\r\nbehold the prosperous transformation from the rude log hut to the stately\r\nDutch mansion, with brick front, glazed windows, and tiled roof; from the\r\ntangled thicket to the luxuriant cabbage garden; and from the skulking\r\nIndian to the ponderous burgomaster. In a word, they will picture to\r\nthemselves the steady, silent, and undeviating march of prosperity,\r\nincident to a city destitute of pride or ambition, cherished by a fat\r\ngovernment, and whose citizens do nothing in a hurry.\r\n\r\nThe sage council, as has been mentioned in a preceding chapter, not being\r\nable to determine upon any plan for the building of their city, the cows,\r\nin a laudable fit of patriotism, took it under their peculiar charge, and\r\nas they went to and from pasture, established paths through the bushes, on\r\neach side of which the good folks built their houses; which is one cause\r\nof the rambling and picturesque turns and labyrinths, which distinguish\r\ncertain streets of New York at this very day.\r\n\r\nThe houses of the higher class were generally constructed of wood,\r\nexcepting the gable end, which was of small black and yellow Dutch bricks,\r\nand always faced on the street, as our ancestors, like their descendants,\r\nwere very much given to outward show, and were noted for putting the best\r\nleg foremost. The house was always furnished with abundance of large doors\r\nand small windows on every floor, the date of its erection was curiously\r\ndesignated by iron figures on the front, and on the top of the roof was\r\nperched a fierce little weathercock, to let the family into the important\r\nsecret which way the wind blew. These, like the weathercocks on the tops\r\nof our steeples, pointed so many different ways, that every man could have\r\na wind to his mind;--the most staunch and loyal citizens, however, always\r\nwent according to the weathercock on the top of the governor's house,\r\nwhich was certainly the most correct, as he had a trusty servant employed\r\nevery morning to climb up and set it to the right quarter.\r\n\r\nIn those good days of simplicity and sunshine, a passion for cleanliness\r\nwas the leading principle in domestic economy, and the universal test of\r\nan able housewife--a character which formed the utmost ambition of our\r\nunenlightened grandmothers. The front door was never opened except on\r\nmarriages, funerals, new year's days, the festival of St. Nicholas, or\r\nsome such great occasion. It was ornamented with a gorgeous brass knocker,\r\ncuriously wrought, sometimes in the device of a dog, and sometimes of a\r\nlion's head, and was daily burnished with such religious zeal, that it was\r\noft-times worn out by the very precautions taken for its preservation. The\r\nwhole house was constantly in a state of inundation, under the discipline\r\nof mops and brooms and scrubbing brushes; and the good housewives of those\r\ndays were a kind of amphibious animal, delighting exceedingly to be\r\ndabbling in water--insomuch that an historian of the day gravely tells us,\r\nthat many of his townswomen grew to have webbed fingers like unto a duck;\r\nand some of them, he had little doubt, could the matter be examined into,\r\nwould be found to have the tails of mermaids; but this I look upon to be a\r\nmere sport of fancy, or, what is worse, a wilful misrepresentation.\r\n\r\nThe grand parlor was the _sanctum sanctorum_, where the passion for\r\ncleaning was indulged without control. In this sacred apartment no one was\r\npermitted to enter excepting the mistress and her confidential maid, who\r\nvisited it once a week, for the purpose of giving it a thorough cleaning,\r\nand putting things to rights; always taking the precaution of leaving\r\ntheir shoes at the door, and entering devoutly on their stocking feet.\r\nAfter scrubbing the floor, sprinkling it with fine white sand, which was\r\ncuriously stroked into angles, and curves, and rhomboids with a broom;\r\nafter washing the windows, rubbing and polishing the furniture, and\r\nputting a bunch of evergreens in the fireplace--the window shutters were\r\nagain closed to keep out the flies, and the room carefully locked up until\r\nthe revolution of time brought round the weekly cleaning day.\r\n\r\nAs to the family, they always entered in at the gate, and most generally\r\nlived in the kitchen. To have seen a numerous household assembled round\r\nthe fire, one would have imagined that he was transported back to those\r\nhappy days of primeval simplicity, which float before our imaginations\r\nlike golden visions. The fireplaces were of a truly patriarchal magnitude,\r\nwhere the whole family, old and young, master and servant, black and\r\nwhite, nay, even the very cat and dog, enjoyed a community of privilege,\r\nand had each a right to a corner. Here the old burgher would sit in\r\nperfect silence, puffing his pipe, looking into the fire with half-shut\r\neyes, and thinking of nothing for hours together; the goede vrouw, on the\r\nopposite side, would employ herself diligently in spinning yarn or\r\nknitting stockings. The young folks would crowd around the hearth,\r\nlistening with breathless attention to some old crone of a negro, who was\r\nthe oracle of the family, and who, perched like a raven in the corner of a\r\nchimney, would croak forth for a long winter afternoon a string of\r\nincredible stories about New England witches, grisly ghosts, horses\r\nwithout heads, and hair-breadth escapes and bloody encounters among the\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nIn those happy days a well-regulated family always rose with the dawn,\r\ndined at eleven, and went to bed at sunset. Dinner was invariably a\r\nprivate meal, and the fat old burghers showed incontestable signs of\r\ndisapprobation and uneasiness at being surprised by a visit from a\r\nneighbor on such occasions. But though our worthy ancestors were thus\r\nsingularly averse to giving dinners, yet they kept up the social bands of\r\nintimacy by occasional banquettings, called tea-parties.\r\n\r\nThese fashionable parties were generally confined to the higher classes,\r\nor noblesse: that is to say, such as kept their own cows and drove their\r\nown waggons. The company commonly assembled at three o'clock, and went\r\naway about six, unless it was in winter time, when the fashionable hours\r\nwere a little earlier, that the ladies might get home before dark. The\r\ntea-table was crowned with a huge earthen dish, well stored with slices of\r\nfat pork, fried brown, cut up into morsels, and swimming in gravy. The\r\ncompany being seated round the genial board, and each furnished with a\r\nfork, evinced their dexterity in launching at the fattest pieces in this\r\nmighty dish--in much the same manner as sailors harpoon porpoises at sea,\r\nor our Indians spear salmon in the lakes. Sometimes the table was graced\r\nwith immense apple-pies, or saucers full of preserved peaches and pears;\r\nbut it was always sure to boast an enormous dish of balls of sweetened\r\ndough, fried in hog's fat, and called doughnuts, or olykoeks--a delicious\r\nkind of cake, at present scarce known in this city, except in genuine\r\nDutch families.\r\n\r\nThe tea was served out of a majestic delf teapot, ornamented with\r\npaintings of fat little Dutch shepherds and shepherdesses, tending pigs,\r\nwith boats sailing in the air, and houses built in the clouds, and sundry\r\nother ingenious Dutch fantasies. The beaux distinguished themselves by\r\ntheir adroitness in replenishing this pot from a huge copper tea-kettle,\r\nwhich would have made the pigmy macaronies of these degenerate days sweat\r\nmerely to look at it. To sweeten the beverage, a lump of sugar was laid\r\nbeside each cup, and the company alternately nibbled and sipped with great\r\ndecorum; until an improvement was introduced by a shrewd and economic old\r\nlady, which was to suspend a large lump directly over the tea-table by a\r\nstring from the ceiling, so that it could be swung from mouth to mouth--an\r\ningenious expedient, which is still kept up by some families in Albany,\r\nbut which prevails without exception in Communipaw, Bergen Flatbush, and\r\nall our uncontaminated Dutch villages.\r\n\r\nAt these primitive tea parties the utmost propriety and dignity of\r\ndeportment prevailed. No flirting nor coquetting--no gambling of old\r\nladies, nor hoyden chattering and romping of young ones--no\r\nself-satisfied struttings of wealthy gentlemen with their brains in their\r\npockets--nor amusing conceits and monkey divertissements of smart young\r\ngentlemen with no brains at all. On the contrary, the young ladies seated\r\nthemselves demurely in their rush-bottomed chairs, and knit their own\r\nwoollen stockings; nor ever opened their lips excepting to say \"_yah\r\nMynheer_,\" or \"_yah ya Vrouw_,\" to any question that was asked them;\r\nbehaving, in all things, like decent, well-educated damsels. As to the\r\ngentlemen, each of them tranquilly smoked his pipe, and seemed lost in\r\ncontemplation of the blue and white tiles with which the fireplaces were\r\ndecorated; wherein sundry passages of Scripture were piously\r\nportrayed--Tobit and his dog figured to great advantage, Haman swung\r\nconspicuously on his gibbet, and Jonah appeared most manfully bouncing out\r\nof the whale like Harlequin through a barrel of fire.\r\n\r\nThe parties broke up without noise and without confusion. They were\r\ncarried home by their own carriages, that is to say, by the vehicles\r\nnature had provided them, excepting such of the wealthy as could afford to\r\nkeep a wagon. The gentlemen gallantly attended their fair ones to their\r\nrespective abodes, and took leave of them with a hearty smack at the door;\r\nwhich, as it was an established piece of etiquette, done in perfect\r\nsimplicity and honesty of heart, occasioned no scandal at that time, nor\r\nshould it at the present. If our great-grandfathers approved of the\r\ncustom, it would argue a great want of reverence in their descendants to\r\nsay a word against it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this dulcet period of my history, when the beauteous island of\r\nManna-hata presented a scene the very counterpart of those glowing\r\npictures drawn of the golden reign of Saturn, there was, as I have before\r\nobserved, a happy ignorance, an honest simplicity prevalent among its\r\ninhabitants, which, were I even able to depict, would be but little\r\nunderstood by the degenerate age for which I am doomed to write. Even the\r\nfemale sex, those arch innovators upon the tranquillity, the honesty, and\r\ngrey-beard customs of society, seemed for a while to conduct themselves\r\nwith incredible sobriety and comeliness.\r\n\r\nTheir hair, untortured by the abominations of art, was scrupulously\r\npomatomed back from their foreheads with a candle, and covered with a\r\nlittle cap of quilted calico, which fitted exactly to their heads. Their\r\npetticoats of linsey-woolsey were striped with a variety of gorgeous\r\ndyes--though I must confess these gallant garments were rather short,\r\nscarce reaching below the knee; but then they made up in the number, which\r\ngenerally equalled that of the gentleman's small clothes; and what is\r\nstill more praiseworthy, they were all of their own manufacture--of which\r\ncircumstance, as may well be supposed, they were not a little vain.\r\n\r\nThese were the honest days, in which every woman stayed at home, read the\r\nBible, and wore pockets--ay, and that too of a goodly size, fashioned with\r\npatchwork into many curious devices, and ostentatiously worn on the\r\noutside. These, in fact, were convenient receptacles, where all good\r\nhousewives carefully stored away such things as they wished to have at\r\nhand, by which means they often came to be incredibly crammed; and I\r\nremember there was a story current, when I was a boy, that the lady of\r\nWouter Van Twiller once had occasion to empty her right pocket in search\r\nof a wooden ladle, when the contents filled a couple of corn baskets, and\r\nthe utensil was discovered lying among some rubbish in one corner; but we\r\nmust not give too much faith to all these stories, the anecdotes of those\r\nremote periods being very subject to exaggeration.\r\n\r\nBesides these notable pockets, they likewise wore scissors and pincushions\r\nsuspended from their girdles by red ribands, or among the more opulent and\r\nshowy classes by brass, and even silver, chains, indubitable tokens of\r\nthrifty housewives and industrious spinsters. I cannot say much in\r\nvindication of the shortness of the petticoats; it doubtless was\r\nintroduced for the purpose of giving the stockings a chance to be seen,\r\nwhich were generally of blue worsted, with magnificent red clocks; or\r\nperhaps to display a well-turned ankle, and a neat though serviceable\r\nfoot, set off by a high-heeled leathern shoe, with a large and splendid\r\nsilver buckle. Thus we find that the gentle sex in all ages have shown the\r\nsame disposition to infringe a little upon the laws of decorum, in order\r\nto betray a lurking beauty, or gratify an innocent love of finery.\r\n\r\nFrom the sketch here given, it will be seen that our good grandmothers\r\ndiffered considerably in their ideas of a fine figure from their\r\nscantily-dressed descendants of the present day. A fine lady, in those\r\ntimes, waddled under more clothes, even on a fair summer's day, than would\r\nhave clad the whole bevy of a modern ball-room. Nor were they the less\r\nadmired by the gentlemen in consequence thereof. On the contrary, the\r\ngreatness of a lover's passion seemed to increase in proportion to the\r\nmagnitude of its object; and a voluminous damsel, arrayed in a dozen\r\npetticoats, was declared by a low Dutch sonneteer of the province to be\r\nradiant as a sunflower, and luxuriant as a full-blown cabbage. Certain it\r\nis that in those day the heart of a lover could not contain more than one\r\nlady at a time, whereas the heart of a modern gallant has often room\r\nenough to accommodate half a dozen; the reason of which I conclude to be,\r\nthat either the hearts of the gentlemen have grown larger, or the persons\r\nof the ladies smaller; this, however, is a question for physiologists to\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nBut there was a secret charm in these petticoats, which, no doubt, entered\r\ninto the consideration of the prudent gallants. The wardrobe of a lady was\r\nin those days her only fortune; and she who had a good stock of petticoats\r\nand stockings was as absolutely an heiress as is a Kamschatka damsel with\r\na store of bear-skins, or a Lapland belle with a plenty of reindeer. The\r\nladies, therefore, were very anxious to display these powerful attractions\r\nto the greatest advantage; and the best rooms in the house, instead of\r\nbeing adorned with caricatures of Dame Nature, in water-colors and\r\nneedlework, were always hung round with abundance of homespun garments,\r\nthe manufacture and the property of the females; a piece of laudable\r\nostentation that still prevails among the heiresses of our Dutch villages.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen, in fact, who figured in the circles of the gay world in\r\nthese ancient times, corresponded in most particulars with the beauteous\r\ndamsels whose smiles they were ambitious to deserve. True it is, their\r\nmerits would make but a very inconsiderable impression upon the heart of a\r\nmodern fair; they neither drove their curricles nor sported their tandems,\r\nfor as yet those gaudy vehicles were not even dreamt of; neither did they\r\ndistinguish themselves by their brilliancy at the table, and their\r\nconsequent rencontres with watchmen, for our forefathers were of too\r\npacific a disposition to need those guardians of the night, every soul\r\nthroughout the town being sound asleep before nine o'clock. Neither did\r\nthey establish their claims to gentility at the expense of their tailors\r\nfor as yet those offenders against the pockets of society, and the\r\ntranquillity of all aspiring young gentlemen were unknown in New\r\nAmsterdam; every good housewife made the clothes of her husband and\r\nfamily, and even the goede vrouw of Van Twiller himself thought it no\r\ndisparagement to cut out her husband's linsey-woolsey galligaskins.\r\n\r\nNot but what there were some two or three youngsters who manifested the\r\nfirst dawning of what is called fire and spirit, who held all labor in\r\ncontempt, skulked about docks and market-places, loitered in the sunshine,\r\nsquandered what little money they could procure at hustle cap and chuck\r\nfarthing; swore, boxed, fought cocks, and raced their neighbor's horses;\r\nin short, who promised to be the wonder, the talk, and abomination of the\r\ntown, had not their stylish career been unfortunately cut short by an\r\naffair of honor with a whipping post.\r\n\r\nFar other, however, was the truly fashionable gentleman of those days; his\r\ndress, which served for both morning and evening, street and drawing-room,\r\nwas a linsey-woolsey coat, made, perhaps, by the fair hands of the\r\nmistress of his affections, and gallantly bedecked with abundance of large\r\nbrass buttons--half a score of breeches heightened the proportions of his\r\nfigure--his shoes were decorated by enormous copper buckles--a low\r\ncrowned, broad-brimmed hat overshadowed his burly visage, and his hair\r\ndangled down his back in a prodigious queue of sulskin.\r\n\r\nThus equipped, he would manfully sally forth with pipe in mouth to besiege\r\nsome fair damsel's obdurate heart--not such a pipe, good reader, as that\r\nwhich Acis did sweetly tune in praise of his Galatea, but one of true delf\r\nmanufacture, and furnished with a charge of fragrant tobacco. With this\r\nwould he resolutely set himself down before the fortress, and rarely\r\nfailed, in the process of time, to smoke the fair enemy into a surrender\r\nupon honorable terms.\r\n\r\nSuch was the happy reign of Wouter Van Twiller, celebrated in many a long\r\nforgotten song as the real golden age, the rest being nothing but\r\ncounterfeit copper-washed coin. In that delightful period a sweet and holy\r\ncalm reigned over the whole province. The burgomaster smoked his pipe in\r\npeace; the substantial solace of his domestic cares, after her daily toils\r\nwere done, sat soberly at the door, with her arms crossed over her apron\r\nof snowy white without being insulted by ribald street walkers or vagabond\r\nboys--those unlucky urchins who do so infest our streets, displaying under\r\nthe roses of youth the thorns and briars of iniquity. Then it was that the\r\nlover with ten breeches, and the damsel with petticoats of half a score,\r\nindulged in all the innocent endearments of virtuous love without fear and\r\nwithout reproach; for what had that virtue to fear which was defended by a\r\nshield of good linsey-woolsey, equal at least to the seven bull-hides of\r\nthe invincible Ajax?\r\n\r\nAh! blissful and never to be forgotten age! when everything was better\r\nthan it has ever been since, or ever will be again--when Buttermilk\r\nChannel was quite dry at low water--when the shad in the Hudson were all\r\nsalmon, and when the moon shone with a pure and resplendent whiteness,\r\ninstead of that melancholy yellow light which is the consequence of her\r\nsickening at the abominations she every night witnesses in this degenerate\r\ncity!\r\n\r\nHappy would it have been for New Amsterdam could it always have existed in\r\nthis state of blissful ignorance and lowly simplicity; but, alas! the days\r\nof childhood are too sweet to last. Cities, like men, grow out of them in\r\ntime, and are doomed alike to grow into the bustle, the cares, and\r\nmiseries of the world. Let no man congratulate himself when he beholds the\r\nchild of his bosom, or the city of his birth, increasing in magnitude and\r\nimportance, let the history of his own life teach him the dangers of the\r\none, and this excellent little history of Manna-hata convince him of the\r\ncalamities of the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned that, in the early times of Oloffe the\r\nDreamer, a frontier post, or trading house, called Fort Aurania, had been\r\nestablished on the upper waters of the Hudson, precisely on the site of\r\nthe present venerable city of Albany, which was at time considered at the\r\nvery end of the habitable world. It was, indeed, a remote possession, with\r\nwhich, for a long time, New Amsterdam held but little intercourse. Now and\r\nthen the \"Company's Yacht,\" as it was called, was sent to the Fort with\r\nsupplies, and to bring away the peltries which had been purchased of the\r\nIndians. It was like an expedition to the Indias, or the North Pole, and\r\nalways made great talk in the settlement. Sometimes an adventurous burgher\r\nwould accompany the expedition, to the great uneasiness of his friends;\r\nbut, on his return, had so many stories to tell of storms and tempests on\r\nthe Tappan Zee, of hobgoblins in the Highlands and at the Devil's Dane\r\nKammer, and of all the other wonders and perils with which the river\r\nabounded in those early days, that he deterred the less adventurous\r\ninhabitants from following his xample.\r\n\r\nMatters were in this state, when, one day, as Walter the Doubter and his\r\nburgermeesters were smoking and pondering over the affairs of the\r\nprovince, they were roused by the report of a cannon. Sallying forth, they\r\nbeheld a strange vessel at anchor in the bay; it was unquestionably of\r\nDutch build, broad-brimmed and high-pooped, and bore the flag of their\r\nHigh Mightinesses at the masthead.\r\n\r\nAfter a while a boat put off for land, and a stranger stepped on shore, a\r\nlofty, lordly kind of man, tall and dry, with a meager face, furnished\r\nwith hug mustachios. He was clad in Flemish doublet and hose, and an\r\ninsufferably tall hat, with a cocktail feather. Such was the patroon\r\nKillian Van Rensellaer, who had come out from Holland to found a colony or\r\npatroonship on a great tract of wild land, granted to him by their Hight\r\nMightinesses the Lords States General, in the upper regions of the Hudson.\r\n\r\nKillian Van Rensellaer was a nine day's wonder in New Amsterdam, for he\r\ncarried a high head, looked down upon the portly, short-legged\r\nburgomasters, and owned no allegiance to the governor himself; boasting\r\nthat he held his patroonship directly from the Lords States General.\r\n\r\nHe tarried but a short time in New Amsterdam merely to beat up recruits\r\nfor his colony. Few, however, ventured to enlist for those remote and\r\nsavage regions; and when they embarked, their friends took leave of them\r\nas if they should never see them more; and stood gazing with tearful eyes\r\nas the stout, round-sterned little vessel ploughed and splashed its way up\r\nthe Hudson, with great noise and little progress, taking nearly a day to\r\nget out of sight of the city.\r\n\r\nAnd now, from time to time, floated down tidings to the Manhattoes of the\r\ngrowing importance of this new colony. Every account represented Killian\r\nVan Rensellaer as rising in importance and becoming a mighty patroon in\r\nthe land. He had received more recruits from Holland. His patroonship of\r\nRensellaerwick lay immediately below Fort Aurania, and extended for\r\nseveral miles on each side of the Hudson, beside embracing the mountainous\r\nregion of the Helderberg. Over all this he claimed to hold separate\r\njurisdiction independent of the colonial authorities at New Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nAll these assumptions of authority were duly reported to Governor Van\r\nTwiller and his council, by dispatches from Fort Aurania, at each new\r\nreport the governor and his counsellors looked at each other, raised their\r\neyebrows, gave an extra puff or two of smoke, and then relapsed into\r\ntheir usually tranquillity.\r\n\r\nAt length tidings came that the patroon of Rensellaerwick had extended his\r\nusurpations along the river, beyond the limits granted him by their High\r\nMightinesses, and that he had even seized upon a rocky island in the\r\nHudson, commonly known by the name of Beern or Bear's Island, where he was\r\nerecting a fortress, to be called by the lordly name of Rensellaersteen.\r\n\r\nWouter Van Twiller was roused by this intelligence. After consulting with\r\nhis burgomasters, he dispatched a letter to the patroon of Rensellaerwick,\r\ndemanding by what right he had seized upon this island, which lay beyond\r\nthe bounds of his patroonship. The answer of Killian Van Rensellaer was in\r\nhis own lordly style, \"By _wapen recht!_\" that is to say, by the right of\r\narms, or in common parlance, by club-law. This answer plunged the worthy\r\nWouter in one of the deepest doubts he had in the whole course of his\r\nadministration. In the meantime, while Wouter doubted, the lordly Killian\r\nwent on to finish his fortress of Rensellaersteen, about which I foresee I\r\nshall have something to record in a future chapter of this most eventful\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and four, on a fine\r\nafternoon in the glowing month of September, I took my customary walk upon\r\nthe battery, which is at once the pride and bulwark of this ancient and\r\nimpregnable city of New York. The ground on which is I trod was hallowed\r\nby recollections of the past, and as I slowly wandered through the long\r\nalley of poplars, which, like so many birch-brooms standing on end,\r\ndiffused a melancholy and lugubrious shade, my imagination drew a contrast\r\nbetween the surrounding scenery, and what it was in the classic days of\r\nour forefathers. Where the government house by name, but the customhouse\r\nby occupation, proudly reared its brick walls and wooden pillars, there\r\nwhilom stood the low, but substantial red-tiled mansion of the renowned\r\nWouter Van Twiller. Around it the mighty bulwarks of Fort Amsterdam\r\nfrowned defiance to every absent foe; but, like many a whiskered warrior\r\nand gallant militia captain, confined their martial deeds to frowns alone.\r\nThe mud breastworks had long been leveled with the earth, and their site\r\nconverted into the green lawns and leafy alleys of the battery, where the\r\ngay apprentice sported his Sunday coat, and the laborious mechanic,\r\nrelieved from the dirt and drudgery of the week, poured his weekly tale of\r\nlove into the half averted ear of the sentimental chambermaid. The\r\ncapacious bay still presented the same expansive sheet of water, studded\r\nwith islands, sprinkled with fishing boats, and bounded by shores of\r\npicturesque beauty. But the dark forests which once clothed those shores\r\nhad been violated by the savage hand of cultivation, and their tangled\r\nmazes and impenetrable thickets had degenerated into teeming orchards, and\r\nwaving fields of grain. Even Governor's Island, once a smiling garden\r\nappertaining to the sovereigns of the province, was now covered with\r\nfortifications, inclosing a tremendous block house; so that this once\r\npeaceful island resembled a fierce little warrior in a big cocked hat,\r\nbreathing gunpowder and defiance to the world!\r\n\r\nFor some time did I indulge in a pensive train of thought, contrasting in\r\nsober sadness the present day with the hallowed years behind the\r\nmountains, lamenting the melancholy progress of improvement, and praising\r\nthe zeal with which our worthy burghers endeavor to preserve the wrecks of\r\nvenerable customs, prejudices, and errors, from the overwhelming tide of\r\nmodern innovation; when, by degrees, my ideas took a different turn, and I\r\ninsensibly awakened to an enjoyment of the beauties around me.\r\n\r\nIt was one of those rich autumnal days, which heaven particularly bestows\r\nupon the beauteous island of Mannahata and its vicinity; not a floating\r\ncloud obscured the azure firmament; the sun rolling in glorious splendor\r\nthrough his ethereal course, seemed to expand his honest Dutch countenance\r\ninto an unusual expression of benevolence, as he smiled his evening\r\nsalutation upon a city which he delights to visit with his most bounteous\r\nbeams; the very winds seemed to hold in their breaths in mute attention,\r\nlest they should ruffle the tranquillity of the hour; and the waveless\r\nbosom of the bay presented a polished mirror, in which Nature beheld\r\nherself and smiled. The standard of our city, reserved like a choice\r\nhandkerchief for days of gala, hung motionless on the flag-staff which\r\nforms the handle of a gigantic churn; and even the tremulous leaves of the\r\npoplar and the aspen ceased to vibrate to the breath of heaven. Everything\r\nseemed to acquiesce in the profound repose of Nature. The formidable\r\neighteen-pounders slept in the embrasures of the wooden batteries,\r\nseemingly gathering fresh strength to fight the battles of their country\r\non the next fourth of July; the solitary drum on Governor's Island forgot\r\nto call the garrison to the shovels; the evening gun had not yet sounded\r\nits signal for all the regular well-meaning poultry throughout the country\r\nto go to roost; and the fleet of canoes at anchor between Gibbet Island\r\nand Communipaw slumbered on their rakes, and suffered the innocent oysters\r\nto lie for a while unmolested in the soft mud of their native banks. My\r\nown feelings sympathized with the contagious tranquillity, and I should\r\ninfallibly have dozed upon one of those fragments of benches which our\r\nbenevolent magistrates have provided for the benefit of convalescent\r\nloungers had not the extraordinary inconvenience of the couch set all\r\nrepose at defiance.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this slumber of the soul my attention was attracted to a\r\nblack speck, peering above the western horizon, just in the rear of Bergen\r\nsteeple; gradually it augments and overhangs the would-be cities of\r\nJersey, Harsimus, and Hoboken, which, like three jockeys, are starting on\r\nthe course of existence, and jostling each other at the commencement of\r\nthe race. Now it skirts the long shore of ancient Pavonia, spreading its\r\nwide shadows from the high settlements of Weehawk quite to the lazaretto\r\nand quarantine, erected by the sagacity of our police for the\r\nembarrassment of commerce; now it climbs the serene vault of heaven, cloud\r\nrolling over cloud, shrouding the orb of day, darkening the vast expanse,\r\nand bearing thunder, and hail, and tempest, in its bosom. The earth seems\r\nagitated at the confusion of the heavens--the late waveless mirror is\r\nlashed into furious waves, that roll in hollow murmurs to the shore--the\r\noyster boats that erst sported in the placid vicinity of Gibbet Island,\r\nnow hurry affrighted to the land--the poplar writhes and twists, and\r\nwhistles in the blast--torrents of drenching rain and sounding hail deluge\r\nthe battery walks--the gates are thronged by apprentices, servant-maids,\r\nand little Frenchmen, with pocket-handkerchiefs over their hats,\r\nscampering from the storm--the late beauteous prospect presents one scene\r\nof anarchy and wild uproar, as though old Chaos had resumed his reign, and\r\nwas hurling back into one vast turmoil the conflicting elements of Nature.\r\n\r\nWhether I fled from the fury of the storm, or remained bodly at my post,\r\nas our gallant train-band captains, who march their soldiers through the\r\nrain without flinching, are points which I leave to the conjecture of the\r\nreader. It is possible he may be a little perplexed also to know the\r\nreason why I introduced this tremendous tempest to disturb the serenity of\r\nmy work. On this latter point I will gratuitously instruct his ignorance.\r\nThe panorama view of the battery was given to gratify the reader with a\r\ncorrect description of that celebrated place, and the parts adjacent;\r\nsecondly, the storm was played off partly to give a little bustle and life\r\nto this tranquil part of my work, and to keep my drowsy readers from\r\nfalling asleep, and partly to serve as an overture to the tempestuous\r\ntimes which are about to assail the pacific province of Nieuw Nederlandts,\r\nand which overhang the slumbrous administration of the renowned Wouter Van\r\nTwiller. It is thus the experienced playwright puts all the fiddles, the\r\nFrench-horns, the kettle drums, and trumpets of his orchestra, in\r\nrequisition, to usher in one of those horrible and brimstone uproars\r\ncalled melodrames; and it is thus he discharges his thunder, his\r\nlightning, his rosin, and saltpetre, preparatory to the rising of a ghost,\r\nor the murdering of a hero. We will now proceed with our history.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be advanced by philosophers to the contrary, I am of opinion\r\nthat, as to nations, the old maxim, that \"honesty is the best policy,\" is\r\na sheer and ruinous mistake. It might have answered well enough in the\r\nhonest times when it was made; but, in these degenerate days, if a nation\r\npretends to rely merely upon the justice of its dealings, it will fare\r\nsomething like the honest man who fell among thieves, and found his\r\nhonesty a poor protection against bad company. Such, at least, was the\r\ncase with the guileless government of the New Netherlands; which, like a\r\nworthy, unsuspicious old burgher, quietly settled itself down in the city\r\nof New Amsterdam as into a snug elbow-chair, and fell into a comfortable\r\nnap, while, in the meantime, its cunning neighbors stepped in and picked\r\nhis pockets. In a word, we may ascribe the commencement of all the woes of\r\nthis great province and its magnificent metropolis to the tranquil\r\nsecurity, or, to speak more accurately, to the unfortunate honesty of its\r\ngovernment. But as I dislike to begin an important part of my history\r\ntowards the end of a chapter; and as my readers, like myself, must\r\ndoubtless be exceedingly fatigued with the long walk we have taken, and\r\nthe tempest we have sustained, I hold it meet we shut up the book, smoke a\r\npipe, and having thus refreshed our spirits, take a fair start in a new\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat my readers may the more fully comprehend the extent of the calamity\r\nat this very moment impending over the honest, unsuspecting province of\r\nNieuw Nederlandts and its dubious governor, it is necessary that I should\r\ngive some account of a horde of strange barbarians bordering upon the\r\neastern frontier.\r\n\r\nNow so it came to pass that, many years previous to the time of which we\r\nare treating, the sage Cabinet of England had adopted a certain national\r\ncreed, a kind of public walk of faith, or rather a religious turnpike, in\r\nwhich every loyal subject was directed to travel to Zion, taking care to\r\npay the toll-gatherers by the way.\r\n\r\nAlbeit a certain shrewd race of men, being very much given to indulge\r\ntheir own opinions on all manner of subjects (a propensity exceedingly\r\noffensive to your free governments of Europe), did most presumptuously\r\ndare to think for themselves in matters of religion, exercising what they\r\nconsidered a natural and unextinguishable right-the liberty of conscience.\r\n\r\nAs, however, they possessed that ingenuous habit of mind which always\r\nthinks aloud--which rides cock-a-hoop on the tongue, and is for ever\r\ngalloping into other people's ears--it naturally followed that their\r\nliberty of conscience likewise implied liberty of speech, which being\r\nfreely indulged, soon put the country in a hubbub, and aroused the pious\r\nindignation of the vigilant fathers of the Church.\r\n\r\nThe usual methods were adopted, to reclaim them, which in those days were\r\nconsidered efficacious in bringing back stray sheep to the fold; that is\r\nto say, they were coaxed, they were admonished, they were menaced, they\r\nwere buffeted--line upon line, precept upon precept, lash upon lash, here\r\na little and there a great deal, were exhausted without mercy and without\r\nsuccess; until worthy pastors of the Church, wearied out by their\r\nunparalleled stubbornness, were driven in the excess of their tender mercy\r\nto adopt the Scripture text, and literally to \"heap live embers on their\r\nheads.\"\r\n\r\nNothing, however, could subdue that independence of the tongue which has\r\never distinguished this singular race, so that, rather than subject that\r\nheroic member to further tyranny, they one and all embarked for the\r\nwilderness of America, to enjoy, unmolested, the inestimable right of\r\ntalking. And, in fact, no sooner did they land upon the shore of this\r\nfree-spoken country, than they all lifted up their voices, and made such a\r\nclamor of tongues, that we are told they frightened every bird and beast\r\nout of the neighborhood, and struck such mute terror into certain fish,\r\nthat they have been called dumb-fish ever since.\r\n\r\nThis may appear marvelous, but it is nevertheless true; in proof of which\r\nI would observe, that the dumb-fish has ever since become an object of\r\nsuperstitious reverence, and forms the Saturday's dinner of every true\r\nYankee.\r\n\r\nThe simple aborigines of the land for a while contemplated these strange\r\nfolk in utter astonishment, but discovering that they wielded harmless,\r\nthough noisy weapons, and were a lively, ingenious, good-humored race of\r\nmen, they became very friendly and sociable, and gave them the name of\r\nYanokies, which in the Mais-Tchusaeg (or Massachusett) language signifies\r\nsilent men--a waggish appellation, since shortened into the familiar\r\nepithet of Yankees, which they retain unto the present day.\r\n\r\nTrue it is, and my fidelity as an historian will not allow me to pass over\r\nthe fact, that having served a regular apprenticeship in the school of\r\npersecution, these ingenious people soon showed that they had become\r\nmasters of the art. The great majority were of one particular mode of\r\nthinking in matters of religion; but, to their great surprise and\r\nindignation, they found that divers Papists, Quakers, and Anabaptists were\r\nspringing up among them, and all claiming to use the liberty of speech.\r\nThis was at once pronounced a daring abuse of the liberty of conscience,\r\nwhich they now insisted was nothing more than the liberty to think as one\r\npleased in matters of religion, provided one thought right; for otherwise\r\nit would be giving a latitude to damnable heresies. Now as they, the\r\nmajority, were convinced that they alone thought right, it consequently\r\nfollowed that whoever thought different from them thought wrong: and\r\nwhoever thought wrong, and obstinately persisted in not being convinced\r\nand converted, was a flagrant violator of the inestimable liberty of\r\nconscience, and a corrupt and infestious member of the body politic, and\r\ndeserved to be lopped off and cast into the fire. The consequence of all\r\nwhich was a fiery persecution of divers sects, and especially of Quakers.\r\n\r\nNow I'll warrant there are hosts of my readers ready at once to lift up\r\ntheir hands and eyes, with that virtuous indignation with which we\r\ncontemplate the faults and errors of our neighbors, and to exclaim at the\r\npreposterous idea of convincing the mind by tormenting the body, and\r\nestablishing the doctrine of charity and forbearance by intolerant\r\npersecution. But, in simple truth, what are we doing at this very day, and\r\nin this very enlightened nation, but acting upon the very same principle\r\nin our political controversies? Have we not, within but a few years,\r\nreleased ourselves from the shackles of a government which cruelly denied\r\nus the privilege of governing ourselves, and using in full latitude that\r\ninvaluable member, the tongue? and are we not at this very moment striving\r\nour best to tyrannize over the opinions, tie up the tongues, and ruin the\r\nfortunes of one another? What are our great political societies but mere\r\npolitical inquisitions--our pot-house committees but little tribunals of\r\ndenunciation--our newspapers but mere whipping-posts and pillories, where\r\nunfortunate individuals are pelted with rotten eggs--and our council of\r\nappointment but a grand auto-da-fe, where culprits are annually sacrificed\r\nfor their political heresies?\r\n\r\nWhere, then, is the difference in principle between our measures and those\r\nyou are so ready to condemn among the people I am treating of? There is\r\nnone; the difference is merely circumstantial. Thus we denounce, instead\r\nof banishing--we libel, instead of scourging--we turn out of office,\r\ninstead of hanging--and where they burnt an offender in proper person, we\r\neither tar and feather, or burn him in effigy--this political persecution\r\nbeing, somehow or other, the grand palladium of our liberties, and an\r\nincontrovertible proof that this is a free country!\r\n\r\nBut not withstanding the fervent zeal with which this holy war was\r\nprosecuted against the whole race of unbelievers, we do not find that the\r\npopulation of this new colony was in anywise hindered thereby; on the\r\ncontrary, they multiplied to a degree which would be incredible to any man\r\nunacquainted with the marvelous fecundity of this growing country.\r\n\r\nThis amazing increase may, indeed, be partly ascribed to a singular custom\r\nprevalent among them, commonly known by the name of bundling--a\r\nsuperstitious rite observed by the young people of both sexes, with which\r\nthey usually terminated their festivities, and which was kept up with\r\nreligious strictness by the more bigoted part of the community. This\r\nceremony was likewise, in those primitive times, considered as an\r\nindispensable preliminary to matrimony, their courtships commencing where\r\nours usually finish; by which means they acquired that intimate\r\nacquaintance with each other's good qualities before marriage, which has\r\nbeen pronounced by philosophers the sure basis of a happy union. Thus\r\nearly did this cunning and ingenious people display a shrewdness of making\r\na bargain which has ever since distinguished them, and a strict adherence\r\nto the good old vulgar maxim about \"buying a pig in a poke.\"\r\n\r\nTo this sagacious custom, therefore, do I chiefly attribute the\r\nunparalleled increase of the Yanokie or Yankee race: for it is a certain\r\nfact, well authenticated by court records and parish registers, that\r\nwherever the practice of bundling prevailed, there was an amazing number\r\nof sturdy brats annually born unto the state, without the license of the\r\nlaw or the benefit of clergy. Neither did the irregularity of their birth\r\noperate in the least to their disparagement. On the contrary, they grew up\r\na long-sided, raw-boned, hardy race of whalers, wood-cutters, fishermen,\r\nand pedlars, and strapping corn-fed wenches, who, by their united efforts,\r\ntended marvelously toward peopling those notable tracts of country called\r\nNantucket, Piscataway, and Cape Cod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter I have given a faithful and unprejudiced account of\r\nthe origin of that singular race of people inhabiting the country eastward\r\nof the Nieuw Nederlandts, but I have yet to mention certain peculiar\r\nhabits which rendered them exceedingly annoying to our ever-honored Dutch\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent of these was a certain rambling propensity with which,\r\nlike the sons of Ishmael, they seem to have been gifted by Heaven, and\r\nwhich continually goads them on to shift their residence from place to\r\nplace, so that a Yankee farmer is in a constant state of migration,\r\ntarrying occasionally here and there, clearing lands for other people to\r\nenjoy, building houses for others to inhabit, and in a manner may be\r\nconsidered the wandering Arab of America.\r\n\r\nHis first thought, on coming to the years of manhood, is to settle himself\r\nin the world--which means nothing more nor less than to begin his rambles.\r\nTo this end he takes unto himself for a wife some buxom country heiress,\r\npassing rich in red ribbons, glass beads, and mock-tortoiseshell combs,\r\nwith a white gown and morocco shoes for Sunday, and deeply skilled in the\r\nmystery of making apple sweetmeats, long sauce, and pumpkin pie.\r\n\r\nHaving thus provided himself, like a pedlar, with a heavy knapsack,\r\nwherewith to regale his shoulders through the journey of life, he\r\nliterally sets out on the peregrination. His whole family, household\r\nfurniture, and farming utensils are hoisted into a covered cart; his own\r\nand his wife's wardrobe packed up in a firkin; which done, he shoulders\r\nhis axe, takes his staff in hand, whistles \"Yankee doodle,\" and trudges\r\noff to the woods, as confident of the protection of Providence, and\r\nrelying as cheerfully upon his own resources, as did ever a patriarch of\r\nyore, when he journeyed into a strange country of the Gentiles. Having\r\nburied himself in the wilderness, he builds himself a log hut, clears away\r\na corn-field and potato patch, and, Providence smiling upon his labors, is\r\nsoon surrounded by a snug farm and some half a score of flaxen-headed\r\nurchins, who, by their size, seem to have sprung all at once out of the\r\nearth like a crop of toadstools.\r\n\r\nBut it is not the nature of this most indefatigable of speculators to rest\r\ncontented with any state of sublunary enjoyment; improvement is his\r\ndarling passion, and having thus improved his lands, the next care is to\r\nprovide a mansion worthy the residence of a landholder. A huge palace of\r\npine boards immediately springs up in the midst of the wilderness, large\r\nenough for a parish church, and furnished with windows of all dimensions,\r\nbut so rickety and flimsy withal, that every blast gives it a fit of the\r\nague.\r\n\r\nBy the time the outside of this mighty air castle is completed, either the\r\nfunds or the zeal of our adventurer are exhausted, so that he barely\r\nmanages to half finish one room within, where the whole family burrow\r\ntogether, while the rest of the house is devoted to the curing of\r\npumpkins, or storing of carrots and potatoes, and is decorated with\r\nfanciful festoons of dried apples and peaches. The outside, remaining\r\nunpainted, grows venerably black with time; the family wardrobe is laid\r\nunder contribution for old hats, petticoats, and breeches, to stuff into\r\nthe broken windows, while the four winds of heaven keep up a whistling and\r\nhowling about this aerial palace, and play as many unruly gambols as they\r\ndid of yore in the cave of old Æolius.\r\n\r\nThe humble log hut which whilom nestled this improving family snugly\r\nwithin its narrow but comfortable walls, stands hard by, in ignominious\r\ncontrast, degraded into a cow-house or pig-sty; and the whole scene\r\nreminds one forcibly of a fable, which I am surprised has never been\r\nrecorded, of an aspiring snail who abandoned his humble habitation, which\r\nhe had long filled with great respectability, to crawl into the empty\r\nshell of a lobster, where he would no doubt have resided with great style\r\nand splendor, the envy and the hate of all the painstaking snails in the\r\nneighborhood, had he not perished with cold in one corner of his\r\nstupendous mansion.\r\n\r\nBeing thus completely settled, and, to use his own words, \"to rights,\" one\r\nwould imagine that he would begin to enjoy the comforts of his situation,\r\nto read newspapers, talk politics, neglect his own business, and attend\r\nto the affairs of the nation like a useful and patriotic citizen; but now\r\nit is that his wayward disposition begins again to operate. He soon grows\r\ntired of a spot where there is no longer any room for improvement--sells\r\nhis farm, air castle, petticoat windows and all, reloads his cart,\r\nshoulders his axe, puts himself at the head of his family, and wanders\r\naway in search of new lands--again to fell trees--again to clear\r\ncorn-fields--again to build a shingle palace, and again to sell off and\r\nwander.\r\n\r\nSuch were the people of Connecticut, who bordered upon the eastern\r\nfrontier of Nieuw Nederlandts, and my readers may easily imagine what\r\nuncomfortable neighbors this light-hearted but restless tribe must have\r\nbeen to our tranquil progenitors. If they cannot, I would ask them if they\r\nhave ever known one of our regular, well-organized Dutch families, whom it\r\nhath pleased Heaven to afflict with the neighborhood of a French\r\nboarding-house? The honest old burgher cannot take his afternoon's pipe on\r\nthe bench before his door but he is persecuted with the scraping of\r\nfiddles, the chattering of women, and the squalling of children; he cannot\r\nsleep at night for the horrible melodies of some amateur, who chooses to\r\nserenade the moon, and display his terrible proficiency in execution on\r\nthe clarionet, hautboy, or some other soft-toned instrument; nor can he\r\nleave the street door open, but his house is defiled by the unsavory\r\nvisits of a troop of pug dogs, who even sometimes carry their loathsome\r\nravages into the _sanctum sanctorum_, the parlor.\r\n\r\nIf my readers have ever witnessed the sufferings of such a family, so\r\nsituated, they may form some idea how our worthy ancestors were distressed\r\nby their mercurial neighbors of Connecticut.\r\n\r\nGangs of these marauders, we are told, penetrated into the New-Netherland\r\nsettlements, and threw whole villages into consternation by their\r\nunparalleled volubility, and their intolerable inquisitiveness--two evil\r\nhabits hitherto unknown in those parts, or only known to be abhorred; for\r\nour ancestors were noted as being men of truly Spartan taciturnity, and\r\nwho neither knew nor cared aught about anybody's concerns but their own.\r\nMany enormities were committed on the highways, where several unoffending\r\nburghers were brought to a stand, and tortured with questions and guesses,\r\nwhich outrages occasioned as much vexation and heart-burning as does the\r\nmodern right of search on the high seas.\r\n\r\nGreat jealousy did they likewise stir up by their intermeddling and\r\nsuccesses among the divine sex, for being a race of brisk, likely,\r\npleasant-tongued varlets, they soon seduced the light affections of the\r\nsimple damsels from their ponderous Dutch gallants. Among other hideous\r\ncustoms, they attempted to introduce among them that bundling, which the\r\nDutch lasses of the Nederlandts, with that eager passion for novelty and\r\nforeign fashions natural to their sex, seemed very well inclined to\r\nfollow, but that their mothers, being more experienced in the world, and\r\nbetter acquainted with men and things, strenuously discountenanced all\r\nsuch outlandish innovations.\r\n\r\nBut what chiefly operated to embroil our ancestors with these strange folk\r\nwas an unwarrantable liberty which they occasionally took of entering in\r\nhordes into the territories of the New Netherlands, and settling\r\nthemselves down, without leave or license, to improve the land in the\r\nmanner I have before noticed. This unceremonious mode of taking possession\r\nof new land was technically termed squatting, and hence is derived the\r\nappellation of squatters, a name odious in the ears of all great\r\nlandholders, and which is given to those enterprising worthies who seize\r\nupon land first, and take their chance to make good their title to it\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nAll these grievances, and many others which were constantly accumulating,\r\ntended to form that dark and portentious cloud which, as I observed in a\r\nformer chapter, was slowly gathering over the tranquil province of New\r\nNetherlands. The pacific cabinet of Van Twiller, however, as will be\r\nperceived in the sequel, bore them all with a magnanimity that redounds to\r\ntheir immortal credit, becoming by passive endurance inured to this\r\nincreasing mass of wrongs, like that mighty man of old, who by dint of\r\ncarrying about a calf from the time it was born, continued to carry it\r\nwithout difficulty when he had grown to be an ox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy this time my readers must fully perceive what an arduous task I have\r\nundertaken--exploring a little kind of Herculaneum of history, which had\r\nlain nearly for ages buried under the rubbish of years, and almost totally\r\nforgotten; raking up the limbs and fragments of disjointed facts, and\r\nendeavoring to put them scrupulously together, so as to restore them to\r\ntheir original form and connection; now lugging forth the character of an\r\nalmost forgotten hero, like a mutilated statue: now deciphering a\r\nhalf-defaced inscription, and now lighting upon a mouldering manuscript,\r\nwhich, after painful study, scarce repays the trouble of perusal.\r\n\r\nIn such cases how much has the reader to depend upon the honor and probity\r\nof his author, lest, like a cunning antiquarian, he either impose upon him\r\nsome spurious fabrication of his own for a precious relic from antiquity,\r\nor else dress up the dismembered fragment with such false trappings, that\r\nit is scarcely possible to distinguish the truth from the fiction with\r\nwhich it is enveloped. This is a grievance which I have more than once had\r\nto lament, in the course of my wearisome researches among the works of my\r\nfellow-historians, who have strangely disguised and distorted the facts\r\nrespecting this country, and particularly respecting the great province of\r\nNew Netherlands, as will be perceived by any who will take the trouble to\r\ncompare their romantic effusions, tricked out in the meretricious gauds of\r\nfable, with this authentic history.\r\n\r\nI have had more vexations of the kind to encounter, in those parts of my\r\nhistory which treat of the transactions on the eastern border than in any\r\nother, in consequence of the troops of historians who have infested those\r\nquarters, and have shown the honest people of Nieuw Nederlands no mercy in\r\ntheir works. Among the rest, Mr. Benjamin Trumbull arrogantly declares\r\nthat \"the Dutch were always mere intruders.\" Now, to this I shall make no\r\nother reply than to proceed in the steady narration of my history, which\r\nwill contain not only proofs that the Dutch had clear title and possession\r\nin the fair valleys of the Connecticut, and that they were wrongfully\r\ndispossessed thereof, but, likewise, that they have been scandalously\r\nmaltreated ever since by the misrepresentations of the crafty historians\r\nof New England. And in this I shall be guided by a spirit of truth and\r\nimpartiality, and a regard to immortal fame; for I would not wittingly\r\ndishonor my work by a single falsehood, misrepresentation, or prejudice,\r\nthough it should gain our forefathers the whole country of New England.\r\n\r\nI have already noticed, in a former chapter of my history that the\r\nterritories of the Nieuw Nederlandts extended on the east quite to the\r\nVarsche, or Fresh, or Connecticut River. Here, at an early period, had\r\nbeen established a frontier post on the bank of the river, and called Fort\r\nGoed Hoop, not far from the site of the present fair city of Hartford. It\r\nwas placed under the command of Jacobus Van Curlet, or Curlis, as some\r\nhistorians will have it, a doughty soldier, of that stomachful class\r\nfamous for eating all they kill. He was long in the body and short in the\r\nlimb, as though a tall man's body had been mounted on a little man's legs.\r\nHe made up for this turnspit construction by striding to such an extent,\r\nthat you would have sworn he had on the seven-leagued boots of Jack the\r\nGiant Killer; and so high did he tread on parade, that his soldiers were\r\nsometimes alarmed lest he should trample himself under foot.\r\n\r\nBut not withstanding the erection of this fort, and the appointment of\r\nthis ugly little man of war as commander, the Yankees continued the\r\ninterlopings hinted at in my last chapter, and at length had the audacity\r\nto squat themselves down within the jurisdiction of Fort Goed Hoop.\r\n\r\nThe long-bodied Van Curlet protested with great spirit against these\r\nunwarrantable encroachments, couching his protest in Low Dutch, by way of\r\ninspiring more terror, and forthwith dispatched a copy of the protest to\r\nthe governor at New Amsterdam, together with a long and bitter account of\r\nthe aggressions of the enemy. This done, he ordered his men, one and all,\r\nto be of good cheer, shut the gate of the fort, smoked three pipes, went\r\nto bed, and awaited the result with a resolute and intrepid tranquillity,\r\nthat greatly animated his adherents, and, no doubt, struck sore dismay and\r\naffright into the hearts of the enemy.\r\n\r\nNow it came to pass that, about this time, the renowned Wouter Van\r\nTwiller, full of years and honors, and council dinners, had reached the\r\nperiod of life and faculty which, according to the great Gulliver,\r\nentitles a man to admission into the ancient order of Struldbruggs. He\r\nemployed his time in smoking his Turkish pipe amid an assemblage of sages\r\nequally enlightened, and nearly as venerable, as himself, and who, for\r\ntheir silence, their gravity, their wisdom, and their cautious averseness\r\nto coming to any conclusion in business, are only to be equalled by\r\ncertain profound corporations which I have known in my time. Upon reading\r\nthe protest of the gallant Jacobus Van Curlet, therefore, His Excellency\r\nfell straightway into one of the deepest doubts that ever he was known to\r\nencounter; his capacious head gradually drooped on his chest; he closed\r\nhis eyes, and inclined his ear to one side, as if listening with great\r\nattention to the discussion that was going on in his belly, and which all\r\nwho knew him declared to be the huge courthouse or council chamber of his\r\nthoughts, forming to his head what the House of Representatives does to\r\nthe Senate. An inarticulate sound, very much resembling a snore,\r\noccasionally escaped him; but the nature of this internal cogitation was\r\nnever known, as he never opened his lips on the subject to man, woman or\r\nchild. In the meantime, the protect of Van Curlet lay quietly on the\r\ntable, where it served to light the pipes of the venerable sages assembled\r\nin council; and, in the great smoke which they raised, the gallant\r\nJacobus, his protest, and his mighty fort Goed Hoop, were soon as\r\ncompletely beclouded and forgotten, as is a question of emergency\r\nswallowed up in the speeches and resolutions of a modern session of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThere are certain emergencies when your profound legislators and sage\r\ndeliberative councils are mightily in the way of a nation, and when an\r\nounce of hair-brained decision is worth a pound of sage doubt and cautious\r\ndiscussion. Such, at least, was the case at present; for while the\r\nrenowned Wouter Van Twiller was daily battling with his doubts, and his\r\nresolution growing weaker and weaker in the contest, the enemy pushed\r\nfarther and farther into his territories, and assumed a most formidable\r\nappearance in the neighborhood of the Fort Goed Hoop. Here they founded\r\nthe mighty town of Pyquag, or, as it has since been called,\r\nWeathersfield--a place which, if we may credit the assertions of that\r\nworthy historian, John Josselyn, gent., \"hath been infamous by reason of\r\nthe witches therein.\" And so daring did these men of Pyquag become, that\r\nthey extended those plantations of onions, for which their town is\r\nillustrious, under the very noses of the garrison of Fort Goed Hoop,\r\ninsomuch that the honest Dutchmen could not look toward that quarter\r\nwithout tears in their eyes.\r\n\r\nThis crying injustice was regarded with proper indignation by the gallant\r\nJacobus Van Curlet. He absolutely trembled with the violence of this\r\ncholer and the exacerbations of his valor, which were the more turbulent\r\nin their workings from the length of the body in which they were agitated.\r\nHe forthwith proceeded to strengthen his redoubts, heighten his\r\nbreastworks, deepen his fosse, and fortify his position with a double row\r\nof abattis; after which he dispatched a fresh courier with accounts of his\r\nperilous situation.\r\n\r\nThe courier chosen to bear the dispatches was a fat, oily little man, as\r\nbeing less liable to be worn out or to lose leather on the journey; and,\r\nto insure his speed, he was mounted on the fleetest wagon horse in the\r\ngarrison, remarkable for length of limb, largeness of bone, and hardness\r\nof trot; and so tall, that the little messenger was obliged to climb on\r\nhis back by means of his tail and crupper. Such extraordinary speed did he\r\nmake, that he arrived at Fort Amsterdam in a little less than a month,\r\nthough the distance was full two hundred pipes, or about one hundred and\r\ntwenty miles.\r\n\r\nWith an appearance of great hurry and business, and smoking a short\r\ntraveling pipe, he proceeded on a long swing trot through the muddy lanes\r\nof the metropolis, demolishing whole batches of dirt pies which the little\r\nDutch children were making in the road, and for which kind of pastry the\r\nchildren of this city have ever been famous. On arriving at the governor's\r\nhouse, he climbed down from his steed, roused the gray-headed doorkeeper,\r\nold Skaats, who, like his lineal descendant and faithful representative,\r\nthe venerable crier of our court, was nodding at his post, rattled at the\r\ndoor of the council chamber, and startled the members as they were dozing\r\nover a plan for establishing a public market.\r\n\r\nAt that very moment a gentle grunt, or rather a deep-drawn snore, was\r\nheard from the chair of the governor, a whiff of smoke was at the same\r\ninstant observed to escape from his lips, and a light cloud to ascend from\r\nthe bowl of his pipe. The council, of course, supposed him engaged in deep\r\nsleep for the good of the community, and according to custom, in all such\r\ncases established, every man bawled out \"Silence!\" when, of a sudden, the\r\ndoor flew open, and the little courier straddled into the apartment, cased\r\nto the middle in a pair of Hessian boots, which he had got into for the\r\nsake of expedition. In his right hand he held forth the ominous\r\ndispatches, and with his left he grasped firmly the waistband of his\r\ngalligaskins, which had unfortunately given way in the exertion of\r\ndescending from his horse. He stumped resolutely up to the governor, and,\r\nwith more hurry than perspicuity, delivered his message. But, fortunately,\r\nhis ill tidings came too late to ruffle the tranquillity of this most\r\ntranquil of rulers. His venerable Excellency had just breathed and smoked\r\nhis last; his lungs and his pipe having been exhausted together, and his\r\npeaceful soul having escaped in the last whiff that curled from his\r\ntobacco pipe. In a word, the renowned Walter the Doubter, who had so often\r\nslumbered with his contemporaries, now slept with his fathers, and\r\nWilhelmus Kieft governed in his stead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOK IV._\r\n\r\nCONTAINING THE CHRONICLES OF THE REIGN OF WILLIAM THE TESTY.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the lofty Thucydides is about to enter upon his description of the\r\nplague that desolated Athens, one of his modern commentators assures the\r\nreader that the history is now going to be exceedingly solemn, serious and\r\npathetic; and hints, with that air of chuckling gratulation with which a\r\ngood dame draws forth a choice morsel from a cupboard to regale a\r\nfavorite, that this plague will give his history a most agreeable variety.\r\n\r\nIn like manner did my heart leap within me when I came to the dolorous\r\ndilemma of Fort Good Hope, which I at once perceived to be the forerunner\r\nof a series of great events and entertaining disasters. Such are the true\r\nsubjects for the historic pen. For what is history, in fact, but a kind of\r\nNewgate Calendar--a register of the crimes and miseries that man has\r\ninflicted on his fellow-men? It is a huge libel on human nature to which\r\nwe industriously add page after page, volume after volume, as if we were\r\nbuilding up a monument to the honor, rather than the infamy, of our\r\nspecies. If we turn over the pages of these chronicles that man has\r\nwritten of himself, what are the characters dignified by the appellation\r\nof great, and held up to the admiration of posterity? Tyrants, robbers,\r\nconquerors, renowned only for the magnitude of their misdeeds and the\r\nstupendous wrongs and miseries they have inflicted on mankind--warriors,\r\nwho have hired themselves to the trade of blood, not from motives of\r\nvirtuous patriotism, or to protect the injured and defenseless, but merely\r\nto gain the vaunted glory of being adroit and successful in massacring\r\ntheir fellow-beings! What are the great events that constitute a glorious\r\nera? The fall of empires, the desolation of happy countries, splendid\r\ncities smoking in their ruins, the proudest works of art tumbled in the\r\ndust, the shrieks and groans of whole nations ascending unto heaven!\r\n\r\nIt is thus the historians may be said to thrive on the miseries of\r\nmankind, like birds of prey which hover over the field of battle to fatten\r\non the mighty dead. It was observed by a great projector of inland lock\r\nnavigation, that rivers, lakes, and oceans were only formed to feed\r\ncanals. In like manner I am tempted to believe that plots, conspiracies,\r\nwars, victories, and massacres are ordained by Providence only as food for\r\nthe historian.\r\n\r\nIt is a source of great delight to the philosophers, in studying the\r\nwonderful economy of nature, to trace the mutual dependencies of\r\nthings--how they are created reciprocally for each other, and how the most\r\nnoxious and apparently unnecessary animal has its uses. Thus those swarms\r\nof flies which are so often execrated as useless vermin are created for\r\nthe sustenance of spiders; and spiders, on the other hand, are evidently\r\nmade to devour flies. So those heroes who have been such scourges to the\r\nworld were bounteously provided as themes for the poet and historian,\r\nwhile the poet and the historian were destined to record the achievements\r\nof heroes!\r\n\r\nThese and many similar reflections naturally arose in my mind as I took up\r\nmy pen to commence the reign of William Kieft; for now the stream of our\r\nhistory, which hitherto has rolled in a tranquil current, is about to\r\ndepart, for ever from its peaceful haunts, and brawl through many a\r\nturbulent and rugged scene.\r\n\r\nAs some sleek ox, sunk in the rich repose of a clover field, dozing and\r\nchewing the cud, will bear repeated blows before it raises itself, so the\r\nprovince of Nieuw Nederlandts, having waxed fat under the drowsy reign of\r\nthe Doubter, needed cuffs and kicks to rouse it into action. The reader\r\nwill now witness the manner in which a peaceful community advances towards\r\na state of war; which is apt to be like the approach of a horse to a drum,\r\nwith much prancing and little progress, and too often with the wrong end\r\nforemost.\r\n\r\nWilhelmus Kieft, who in 1634 ascended the gubernatorial chair, to borrow a\r\nfavorite though clumsy appellation of modern phraseologists, was of a\r\nlofty descent, his father being inspector of windmills in the ancient town\r\nof Saardam; and our hero, we are told, when a boy, made very curious\r\ninvestigations into the nature and operation of these machines, which was\r\none reason why he afterwards came to be so ingenious a governor. His name,\r\naccording to the most authentic etymologists, was a corruption of Kyver;\r\nthat is to say, a wrangler or scolder; and expressed the characteristic of\r\nhis family, which for nearly two centuries had kept the windy town of\r\nSaardam in hot water, and produced more tartars and brimstones than any\r\nten families in the place; and so truly did he inherit this family\r\npeculiarity that he had not been a year in the government of the province\r\nbefore he was universally denominated William the Testy. His appearance\r\nanswered to his name. He was a brisk, wiry, waspish little old gentleman,\r\nsuch a one as may now and then be seen stumping about our city in a\r\nbroad-skirted coat with huge buttons, a cocked hat stuck on the back of\r\nhis head, and a cane as high as his chin. His face was broad, but his\r\nfeatures were sharp; his cheeks were scorched into a dusky red, by two\r\nfiery little gray eyes, his nose turned up, and the corners of his mouth\r\nturned down pretty much like the muzzle of an irritable pug-dog.\r\n\r\nI have heard it observed by a profound adept in human physiology that if\r\na woman waxes fat with the progress of years her tenure of life is\r\nsomewhat precarious, but if haply she withers as she grows old, she lives\r\nfor ever. Such promised to be the case with William the Testy, who grew\r\ntough in proportion as he dried. He had withered, in fact, not through the\r\nprocess of years, but through the tropical fervor of his soul, which burnt\r\nlike a vehement rushlight in his bosom, inciting him to incessant broils\r\nand bickerings. Ancient traditions speak much of his learning, and of the\r\ngallant inroads he had made into the dead languages, in which he had made\r\ncaptive a host of Greek nouns and Latin verbs, and brought off rich booty\r\nin ancient saws and apophthegms, which he was wont to parade in his public\r\nharangues, as a triumphant general of yore his _spolia opima_. Of\r\nmetaphysics he knew enough to confound all hearers and himself into the\r\nbargain. In logic, he knew the whole family of syllogisms and dilemmas,\r\nand was so proud of his skill that he never suffered even a self-evident\r\nfact to pass unargued. It was observed, however, that he seldom got into\r\nan argument without getting into a perplexity, and then into a passion\r\nwith his adversary for not being convinced gratis.\r\n\r\nHe had, moreover, skirmished smartly on the frontiers of several of the\r\nsciences, was fond of experimental philosophy, and prided himself upon\r\ninventions of all kinds. His abode, which he had fixed at a bowery, or\r\ncountry seat, at a short distance from the city, just at what is now\r\ncalled Dutch Street, soon abounded with proofs of his ingenuity; patent\r\nsmoke jacks that required a horse to work them; Dutch ovens that roasted\r\nmeat without fire; carts that went before the horses; weathercocks that\r\nturned against the wind; and other wrong-headed contrivances that\r\nastonished and confounded all beholders. The house, too, was beset with\r\nparalytic cats and dogs, the subjects of his experimental philosophy; and\r\nthe yelling and yelping of the latter unhappy victims of science, while\r\naiding in the pursuit of knowledge, soon gained for the place the name of\r\n\"Dog's Misery,\" by which it continues to be known even at the present day.\r\n\r\nIt is in knowledge as in swimming, he who flounders and splashes on the\r\nsurface makes more noise and attracts more attention than the pearl diver\r\nwho quietly dives in quest of treasures to the bottom. The vast\r\nacquirements of the new governor were the theme of marvel among the simple\r\nburghers of New Amsterdam; he figured about the place as learned a man as\r\na Bonze at Pekin, who has mastered one-half of the Chinese alphabet; and\r\nwas unanimously pronounced a \"universal genius!\"\r\n\r\nI have known in my time many a genius of this stamp; but, to speak my mind\r\nfreely, I never knew one who, for the ordinary purposes of life, was worth\r\nhis weight in straw. In this respect a little sound judgment and plain\r\ncommon sense is worth all the sparkling genius that ever wrote poetry or\r\ninvented theories. Let us see how the universal acquirements of William\r\nthe Testy aided him in the affairs of government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sooner had this bustling little potentate been blown by a whiff of\r\nfortune into the seat of government than he called his council together to\r\nmake them a speech on the state of affairs.\r\n\r\nCaius Gracchus, it is said, when he harangued the Roman populace,\r\nmodulated his tone by an oratorical flute or pitch pipe. Wilhelmus Kieft,\r\nnot having such an instrument at hand, availed himself of that musical\r\norgan or trump which nature has implanted in the midst of a man's face; in\r\nother words, he preluded his address by a sonorous blast of the nose; a\r\npreliminary flourish much in vogue among public orators.\r\n\r\nHe then commenced by expressing his humble sense of his utter unworthiness\r\nof the high post to which he had been appointed, which made some of the\r\nsimple burghers wonder why he undertook it, not knowing that it is a point\r\nof etiquette with a public orator never to enter upon office without\r\ndeclaring himself unworthy to cross the threshold. He then proceeded, in a\r\nmanner highly classic and erudite, to speak of government generally, and\r\nof the governments of ancient Greece in particular; together with the wars\r\nof Rome and Carthage, and the rise and fall of sundry outlandish empires\r\nwhich the worthy burghers had never read nor heard of. Having thus, after\r\nthe manner of your learned orators, treated of things in general, he came\r\nby a natural roundabout transition to the matter in hand, namely, the\r\ndaring aggressions of the Yankees.\r\n\r\nAs my readers are well aware of the advantage a potentate has of handling\r\nhis enemies as he pleases in his speeches and bulletins, where he has the\r\ntalk all on his own side, they may rest assured that William the Testy did\r\nnot let such an opportunity escape of giving the Yankees what is called \"a\r\ntaste of his quality.\" In speaking of their inroads into the territories\r\nof their High Mightinesses, he compared them to the Gauls, who desolated\r\nRome; the Goths and Vandals, who overran the fairest plains of Europe; but\r\nwhen he came to speak of the unparalleled audacity with which they at\r\nWeathersfield had advanced their patches up to the very walls of Fort Goed\r\nHoop, and threatened to smother the garrison in onions, tears of rage\r\nstarted into his eyes, as though he nosed the very offence in question.\r\n\r\nHaving thus wrought up his tale to a climax, he assumed a most belligerent\r\nlook, and assured the council that he had devised an instrument potent in\r\nits effects, and which he trusted would soon drive the Yankees from the\r\nland. So saying, he thrust his hand into one of the deep pockets of his\r\nbroad-skirted coat and drew forth, not an infernal machine, but an\r\ninstrument in writing, which he laid with great emphasis upon the table.\r\n\r\nThe burghers gazed at it for a time in silent awe, as a wary housewife\r\ndoes at a gun, fearful it may go off half-cocked. The document in question\r\nhad a sinister look, it is true; it was crabbed in text, and from a broad\r\nred ribbon dangled the great seal of the province, about the size of a\r\nbuckwheat pancake. Herein, however, existed the wonder of the invention.\r\nThe document in question was a proclamation, ordering the Yankees to\r\ndepart instantly from the territories of their High Mightinesses, under\r\npain of suffering all the forfeitures and punishments in such case made\r\nand provided. It was on the moral effect of this formidable instrument\r\nthat Wilhelmus Kieft calculated; pledging his valor as a governor that,\r\nonce fulminated against the Yankees, it would in less than two months\r\ndrive every mother's son of them across the borders.\r\n\r\nThe council broke up in perfect wonder, and nothing was talked of for some\r\ntime among the old men and women of New Amsterdam but the vast genius of\r\nthe governor and his new and cheap mode of fighting by proclamation.\r\n\r\nAs to Wilhelmus Kieft, having dispatched his proclamation to the\r\nfrontiers, he put on his cocked hat and corduroy small clothes, and,\r\nmounting a tall, raw-boned charger, trotted out to his rural retreat of\r\nDog's Misery. Here, like the good Numa, he reposed from the toils of\r\nstate, taking lessons in government, not from the nymph Egeria, but from\r\nthe honored wife of his bosom, who was one of that class of females, sent\r\nupon the earth a little after the flood, as a punishment for the sins of\r\nmankind, and commonly known by the appellation of knowing women. In fact,\r\nmy duty as an historian obliges me to make known a circumstance which was\r\na great secret at the time, and consequently was not a subject of scandal\r\nat more than half the tea tables in New Amsterdam, but which, like many\r\nother great secrets, has leaked out in the lapse of years; and this was,\r\nthat Wilhelmus the Testy, though one of the most potent little men that\r\never breathed, yet submitted at home to a species of government, neither\r\nlaid down in Aristotle or Plato; in short, it partook of the nature of a\r\npure, unmixed tyranny, and is familiarly denominated petticoat government.\r\nAn absolute sway, which, although exceedingly common in these modern days,\r\nwas very rare among the ancients, if we may judge from the rout made about\r\nthe domestic economy of honest Socrates, which is the only ancient case on\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nThe great Kieft, however, warded off all the sneers and sarcasms of his\r\nparticular friends, who are ever ready to joke with a man on sore points\r\nof the kind, by alleging that it was a government of his own election, to\r\nwhich he submitted through choice; adding, at the same time, a profound\r\nmaxim which he had found in an ancient author, that \"he who would aspire\r\nto govern should first learn to obey.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever was a more comprehensive, a more expeditious, or, what is still\r\nbetter, a more economical measure devised than this of defeating the\r\nYankees by proclamation--an expedient, likewise, so gentle and humane,\r\nthere were ten chances to one in favor of its succeeding; but then, there\r\nwas one chance to ten that it would not succeed. As the ill-natured Fates\r\nwould have it, that single chance carried the day! The proclamation was\r\nperfect in all its parts, well constructed, well written, well sealed, and\r\nwell published; all that was wanting to insure its effect was, that the\r\nYankees should stand in awe of it; but, provoking to relate, they treated\r\nit with the most absolute contempt, applied it to an unseemly purpose,\r\nand thus did the first warlike proclamation come to a shameful end--a fate\r\nwhich I am credibly informed has befallen but too many of its successors.\r\n\r\nSo far from abandoning the country, those varlets continued their\r\nencroachments, squatting along the green banks of the Varsche river, and\r\nfounding Hartford, Stamford, New Haven, and other border towns. I have\r\nalready shown how the onion patches of Pyquag were an eyesore to Jacobus\r\nVan Curlet and his garrison, but now these moss troopers increased in\r\ntheir atrocities, kidnaping hogs, impounding horses, and sometimes\r\ngrievously rib-roasting their owners. Our worthy forefathers could\r\nscarcely stir abroad without danger of being outjockeyed in horseflesh, or\r\ntaken in in bargaining; while, in their absence, some daring Yankee pedlar\r\nwould penetrate to their household, and nearly ruin the good housewives\r\nwith tinware and wooden bowls.[34]\r\n\r\nI am well aware of the perils which environ me in this part of my\r\nhistory. While raking, with curious hand but pious heart, among the\r\nmouldering remains of former days, anxious to draw therefrom the honey of\r\nwisdom, I may fare somewhat like that valiant worthy, Samson, who, in\r\nmeddling with the carcase of a dead lion, drew a swarm of bees about his\r\nears. Thus, while narrating the many misdeeds of the Yanokie or Yankee\r\nrace, it is ten chances to one but I offend the morbid sensibilities of\r\ncertain of their unreasonable descendants, who may fly out and raise such\r\na buzzing about this unlucky head of mine, that I shall need the tough\r\nhide of an Achilles, or an Orlando Furioso, to protect me from their\r\nstings.\r\n\r\nShould such be the case, I should deeply and sincerely lament--not my\r\nmisfortune in giving offence--but the wrong-headed perverseness of an\r\nill-natured generation, in taking offence at anything I say. That their\r\nancestors did use my ancestors ill is true, and I am very sorry for it. I\r\nwould, with all my heart, the fact were otherwise; but as I am recording\r\nthe sacred events of history, I'd not bate one nail's breadth of the\r\nhonest truth, though I were sure the whole edition of my work would be\r\nbought up and burnt by the common hangman of Connecticut. And in sooth,\r\nnow that these testy gentlemen have drawn me out, I will make bold to go\r\nfarther, and observe that this is one of the grand purposes for which we\r\nimpartial historians are sent into the world--to redress wrongs, and\r\nrender justice on the heads of the guilty. So that, though a powerful\r\nnation may wrong its neighbors with temporary impunity, yet sooner or\r\nlater an historian springs up, who wreaks ample chastisement on it in\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nThus these moss-troopers of the east little thought, I'll warrant it,\r\nwhile they were harassing the inoffensive province of Nieuw Nederlandts,\r\nand driving its unhappy governor to his wits' end, that an historian would\r\never arise, and give them their own with interest. Since, then, I am but\r\nperforming my bounden duty as a historian in avenging the wrongs of our\r\nreverend ancestors, I shall make no further apology; and, indeed, when it\r\nis considered that I have all these ancient borderers of the east in my\r\npower, and at the mercy of my pen, I trust that it will be admitted I\r\nconduct myself with great humanity and moderation.\r\n\r\nIt was long before William the Testy could be persuaded that his\r\nmuch-vaunted war measure was ineffectual; on the contrary, he flew in a\r\npassion whenever it was doubted, swearing that though slow in operating,\r\nyet when it once began to work it would soon purge the land of those\r\ninvaders. When convinced at length of the truth, like a shrewd physician,\r\nhe attributed the failure to the quantity, not the quality of the\r\nmedicine, and resolved to double the dose. He fulminated, therefore, a\r\nsecond proclamation more vehement than the first, forbidding all\r\nintercourse with these Yankee intruders; ordering the Dutch burghers on\r\nthe frontiers to buy none of their pacing horses, measly pork, apple\r\nsweetmeats, Weathersfield onions, or wooden bowls, and to furnish them\r\nwith no supplies of gin, gingerbread, or sourkrout.\r\n\r\nAnother interval elapsed, during which the last proclamation was as little\r\nregarded as the first, and the non-intercourse was especially set at\r\nnought by the young folks of both sexes.\r\n\r\nAt length one day inhabitants of New Amsterdam were aroused by a furious\r\nbarking of dogs, great and small, and beheld to their surprise the whole\r\ngarrison of Fort Good Hope straggling into town all tattered and way-worn,\r\nwith Jacobus Van Curlet at their head, bringing the melancholy\r\nintelligence of the capture of Fort Good Hope by the Yankees.\r\n\r\nThe fate of this important fortress is an impressive warning to all\r\nmilitary commanders. It was neither carried by storm nor famine; nor was\r\nit undermined, nor bombarded, nor set on fire by red-hot shot, but was\r\ntaken by a stratagem no less singular than effectual, and which can never\r\nfail of success whenever an opportunity occurs of putting it in practice.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the Yankees had received intelligence that the garrison of\r\nJacobus Van Curlet had been reduced nearly one-eighth by the death of two\r\nof his most corpulent soldiers, who had over-eaten themselves on fat\r\nsalmon caught in the Varsche river. A secret expedition was immediately\r\nset on foot to surprise the fortress. The crafty enemy, knowing the habits\r\nof the garrison to sleep soundly after they had eaten their dinners and\r\nsmoked their pipes, stole upon them at the noonstide of a sultry summer's\r\nday, and surprised them in the midst of their slumbers.\r\n\r\nIn an instant the flag of their High Mightinesses was lowered, and the\r\nYankee standard elevated in its stead, being a dried codfish, by way of a\r\nspread eagle. A strong garrison was appointed of long-sided, hard-fisted\r\nYankees, with Weathersfield onions for cockades and feathers. As to\r\nJacobus Van Curlet and his men, they were seized by the nape of the neck,\r\nconducted to the gate, and one by one dismissed with a kick in the\r\ncrupper, as Charles XII dismissed the heavy-bottomed Russians at the\r\nbattle of Narva; Jacobus Van Curlet receiving two kicks in consideration\r\nof his official dignity.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [34] The following cases in point appear in Hazard's \"Collection\r\n        of State Papers:\"--\"In the meantime, they of Hartford have not\r\n        onely usurped and taken in the lands of Connecticott, although\r\n        uprighteously and against the lawes of nations, but have hindered\r\n        our nation in sowing theire own purchased broken-up lands, but\r\n        have also sowed them with corne in the night, which the\r\n        Nederlanders had broken up and intended to sowe; and have beaten\r\n        the servants of the high and mighty the honored companie, which\r\n        were labouring upon theire masters' lands, from theire lands,\r\n        with sticks and plow staves in hostile manner laming, and, among\r\n        the rest, struck Ever Duckings [Evert Duyckink] a hole in his\r\n        head with a stick, so that the bloode ran downe very strongly\r\n        downe upon his body.\"\r\n\r\n        \"Those of Hartford sold a hogg, that belonged to the honored\r\n        companie, under pretence that it had eaten of theire grounde\r\n        grass, when they had not any foot of inheritance. They proffered\r\n        the hogg for 5s. if the commissioners would have given 5s. for\r\n        damage; which the commissioners denied, because noe man's own\r\n        hogg (as men used to say), can trespass upon his owne master's\r\n        grounde.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage cannot express the awful ire of William the Testy on hearing of\r\nthe catastrophe at Fort Goed Hoop. For three good hours his rage was too\r\ngreat for words, or rather the words were too great for him (being a very\r\nsmall man), and he was nearly choked by the misshapen, nine-cornered Dutch\r\noaths and epithets which crowded at one into his gullet. At length his\r\nwords found vent, and for three days he kept up a constant discharge,\r\nanathematising the Yankees, man, woman, and child, for a set of dieven,\r\nschobbejacken, deugenieten, twist-zoekeren, blaes-kaken, loosen-schalken,\r\nkakken-bedden, and a thousand other names, of which, unfortunately for\r\nposterity, history does not make mention. Finally, he swore that he would\r\nhave nothing more to do with such a squatting, bundling, guessing,\r\nquestioning, swapping, pumpkin-eating, molasses-daubing,\r\nshingle-splitting, cider-watering, horse-jockeying, notion-peddling\r\ncrew--that they might stay at Fort Goed Hoop and rot, before he would\r\ndirty his hands by attempting to drive them away; in proof of which he\r\nordered the new-raised troops to be marched forthwith into winter\r\nquarters, although it was not as yet quite midsummer. Great despondency\r\nnow fell upon the city of New Amsterdam. It was feared that the conquerors\r\nof Fort Goed Hoop, flushed with victory and apple-brandy, might march on\r\nto the capital, take it by storm, and annex the whole province to\r\nConnecticut. The name of Yankee became as terrible among the Nieuw\r\nNederlanders as was that of Gaul among the ancient Romans, insomuch that\r\nthe good wives of the Manhattoes used it as a bugbear wherewith to\r\nfrighten their unruly children.\r\n\r\nEverybody clamored round the governor, imploring him to put the city in a\r\ncomplete posture of defence, and he listened to their clamors. Nobody\r\ncould accuse William the Testy of being idle in time of danger, or at any\r\nother time. He was never idle, but then he was often busy to very little\r\npurpose. When a youngling he had been impressed with the words of Solomon,\r\n\"Go to the ant, thou sluggard, observe her ways and be wise,\" in\r\nconformity to which he had ever been of a restless, ant-like turn;\r\nhurrying hither and thither, nobody knew why or wherefore, busying himself\r\nabout small matters with an air of great importance and anxiety, and\r\ntoiling at a grain of mustard-seed in the full conviction that he was\r\nmoving a mountain. In the present instance he called in all his inventive\r\npowers to his aid, and was continually pondering over plans, making\r\ndiagrams, and worrying about with a troop of workmen and projectors at his\r\nheels. At length, after a world of consultation and contrivance, his plans\r\nof defence ended in rearing a great flag-staff in the center of the fort,\r\nand perching a windmill on each bastion.\r\n\r\nThese warlike preparations in some measure allayed the public alarm,\r\nespecially after an additional means of securing the safety of the city\r\nhad been suggested by the governor's lady. It has already been hinted in\r\nthis most authentic history that in the domestic establishment of William\r\nthe Testy \"the grey mare was the better horse;\" in other words, that his\r\nwife \"ruled the roast,\" and, in governing the governor, governed the\r\nprovince, which might thus be said to be under petticoat government.\r\n\r\nNow it came to pass that this time there lived in the Manhattoes a jolly,\r\nrobustious trumpeter, named Anthony Van Corlear, famous for his long wind;\r\nand who, as the story goes, could twang so potently upon his instrument\r\nthat the effect upon all within hearing was like that ascribed to the\r\nScotch bagpipe when it sings right lustily i' the nose.\r\n\r\nThis sounder of brass was moreover a lusty bachelor, with a pleasant,\r\nburly visage, a long nose, and huge whiskers. He had his little bowery, or\r\nretreat in the country, where he led a roystering life, giving dances to\r\nthe wives and daughters of the burghers of the Manhattoes, insomuch that\r\nhe became a prodigious favorite with all the women, young and old. He is\r\nsaid to have been the first to collect that famous toll levied on the fair\r\nsex at Kissing Bridge, on the highway to Hell-gate.[35]\r\n\r\nTo this sturdy bachelor the eyes of all the women were turned in this time\r\nof darkness and peril, as the very man to second and carry out the plans\r\nof defence of the governor. A kind of petticoat council was forthwith held\r\nat the government house, at which the governor's lady presided: and this\r\nlady, as has been hinted, being all potent with the governor, the result\r\nof these councils was the elevation of Anthony the Trumpeter to the post\r\nof commandant of windmills and champion of New Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nThe city being thus fortified and garrisoned, it would have done one's\r\nheart good to see the governor snapping his fingers and fidgeting with\r\ndelight, as the trumpeter strutted up and down the ramparts twanging\r\ndefiance to the whole Yankee race, as does a modern editor to all the\r\nprincipalities and powers on the other side of the Atlantic. In the hands\r\nof Anthony Van Corlear this windy instrument appeared to him as potent as\r\nthe horn of the paladin Astolpho, or even the more classic horn of Alecto;\r\nnay, he had almost the temerity to compare it with the rams' horns\r\ncelebrated in Holy Writ, at the very sound of which the walls of Jericho\r\nfell down.\r\n\r\nBe all this as it may, the apprehensions of hostilities from the east\r\ngradually died away. The Yankees made no further invasion; nay, they\r\ndeclared they had only taken possession of Fort Goed Hoop as being erected\r\nwithin their territories. So far from manifesting hostility, they\r\ncontinued to throng to New Amsterdam with the most innocent countenances\r\nimaginable, filling the market with their notions, being as ready to trade\r\nwith the Netherlands as ever, and not a whit more prone to get to the\r\nwindward of them in a bargain.\r\n\r\nThe old wives of the Manhattoes who took tea with the governor's lady\r\nattributed all this affected moderation to the awe inspired by the\r\nmilitary preparations of the governor, and the windy prowess of Anthony\r\nthe Trumpeter.\r\n\r\nThere were not wanting illiberal minds, however, who sneered at the\r\ngovernor for thinking to defend his city as he governed it, by mere wind;\r\nbut William Kieft was not to be jeered out of his windmills; he had seen\r\nthem perched upon the ramparts of his native city of Saardam; and was\r\npersuaded they were connected with the great science of defence; nay, so\r\nmuch piqued was he by having them made a matter of ridicule, that he\r\nintroduced them into the arms of the city, where they remain to this day,\r\nquartered with the ancient beaver of the Manhattoes, an emblem and memento\r\nof his policy.\r\n\r\nI must not omit to mention that certain wise old burghers of the\r\nManhattoes, skilful in expounding signs and mysteries, after events have\r\ncome to pass, consider this early intrusion of the windmill into the\r\nescutcheon of our city, which before had been wholly occupied by the\r\nbeaver, as portentous of its after fortune, when the quiet Dutchman would\r\nbe elbowed aside by the enterprising Yankee, and patient industry\r\novertopped by windy speculation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [35] The bridge here mentioned by Mr. Knickerbocker still exists;\r\n        but it is said that the toll is seldom collected nowadays\r\n        excepting on sleighing parties, by the descendants of the\r\n        patriarchs, who still preserve the traditions of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the wrecks and fragments of exalted wisdom which have floated down\r\nthe stream of time from venerable antiquity, and been picked up by those\r\nhumble but industrious wights who ply along the shores of literature, we\r\nfind a shrewd ordinance of Charondas the Locrian legislator. Anxious to\r\npreserve the judicial code of the state from the additions and amendments\r\nof country members and seekers of popularity, he ordained that, whoever\r\nproposed a new law should do it with a halter about his neck; whereby, in\r\ncase his proposition were rejected, they just hung him up--and there the\r\nmatter ended.\r\n\r\nThe effect was, that for more than two hundred years there was but one\r\ntrifling alteration in the judicial code; and legal matters were so clear\r\nand simple that the whole race of lawyers starved to death for want of\r\nemployment. The Locrians, too, being freed from all incitement to\r\nlitigation, lived very lovingly together, and were so happy a people that\r\nthey make scarce any figure in history; it being only your litigatous,\r\nquarrelsome, rantipole nations who make much noise in the world.\r\n\r\nI have been reminded of these historical facts in coming to treat of the\r\ninternal policy of William the Testy. Well would it have been for him had\r\nhe in the course of his universal acquirements stumbled upon the\r\nprecaution of the good Charondas; or had he looked nearer home at the\r\nprotectorate of Oloffe the Dreamer, when the community was governed\r\nwithout laws. Such legislation, however, was not suited to the busy,\r\nmeddling mind of William the Testy. On the contrary, he conceived that the\r\ntrue wisdom of legislation consisted in the multiplicity of laws. He\r\naccordingly had great punishments for great crimes, and little punishments\r\nfor little offences. By degrees the whole surface of society was cut up by\r\nditches and fences, and quickset hedges of the law, and even the\r\nsequestered paths of private life so beset by petty rules and ordinances,\r\ntoo numerous to be remembered, that one could scarce walk at large without\r\nthe risk of letting off a spring-gun or falling into a man-trap.\r\n\r\nIn a little while the blessings of innumerable laws became apparent; a\r\nclass of men arose to expound and confound them. Petty courts were\r\ninstituted to take cognizance of petty offences, pettifoggers began to\r\nabound, and the community was soon set together by the ears.\r\n\r\nLet me not be thought as intending anything derogatory to the profession\r\nof the law, or to the distinguished members of that illustrious order.\r\nWell am I aware that we have in this ancient city innumerable worthy\r\ngentlemen, the knights-errant of modern days, who go about redressing\r\nwrongs and defending the defenceless, not for the love of filthy lucre,\r\nnor the selfish cravings of renown, but merely for the pleasure of doing\r\ngood. Sooner would I throw this trusty pen into the flames, and cork up my\r\nink-bottle for ever, than infringe even for a nail's breadth upon the\r\ndignity of these truly benevolent champions of the distressed. On the\r\ncontrary, I allude merely to those caitiff scouts who, in these latter\r\ndays of evil, infest the skirts of the profession, as did the recreant\r\nCornish knights of yore the honorable order of chivalry; who, under its\r\nauspices, commit flagrant wrongs; who thrive by quibbles, by quirks and\r\nchicanery, and like vermin increase the corruption in which they are\r\nengendered.\r\n\r\nNothing so soon awakens the malevolent passions as the facility of\r\ngratification. The courts of law would never be so crowded with petty,\r\nvexatious, and disgraceful suits were it not for the herds of\r\npettifoggers. These tamper with the passions of the poorer and more\r\nignorant classes; who, as if poverty were not a sufficient misery in\r\nitself, are ever ready to embitter it by litigation. These, like quacks in\r\nmedicine, excite the malady to profit by the cure, and retard the cure to\r\naugment the fees. As the quack exhausts the constitution the pettifogger\r\nexhausts the purse; and as he who has once been under the hands of a quack\r\nis for ever after prone to dabble in drugs, and poison himself with\r\ninfallible prescriptions, so the client of the pettifogger is ever after\r\nprone to embroil himself with his neighbors, and impoverish himself with\r\nsuccessful lawsuits. My readers will excuse this digression into which I\r\nhave been unwarily betrayed; but I could not avoid giving a cool and\r\nunprejudiced account of an abomination too prevalent in this excellent\r\ncity, and with the effects of which I am ruefully acquainted, having been\r\nnearly ruined by a lawsuit which was decided against me; and my ruin\r\nhaving been completed by another, which was decided in my favor.\r\n\r\nTo return to our theme. There was nothing in the whole range of moral\r\noffences against which the jurisprudence of William the Testy was more\r\nstrenuously directed than the crying sin of poverty. He pronounced it the\r\nroot of all evil, and determined to cut it up root and branch, and\r\nextirpate it from the land. He had been struck, in the course of his\r\ntravels in the old countries of Europe, with the wisdom of those notices\r\nposted up in country towns, that \"any vagrant found begging there would be\r\nput in the stocks,\" and he had observed that no beggars were to be seen in\r\nthese neighborhoods; having doubtless thrown off their rags and their\r\npoverty, and become rich under the terror of the law. He determined to\r\nimprove upon this hint. In a little while a new machine of his own\r\ninvention was erected hard by Dog's Misery. This was nothing more nor less\r\nthan a gibbet, of a very strange, uncouth, and unmatchable construction,\r\nfar more efficacious, as he boasted, than the stocks, for the punishment\r\nof poverty. It was for altitude not a whit inferior to that of Haman, so\r\nrenowned in Bible history; but the marvel of the contrivance was, that the\r\nculprit, instead of being suspended by the neck according to venerable\r\ncustom, was hoisted by the waistband, and kept dangling and sprawling\r\nbetween heaven and earth for an hour or two at a time, to the infinite\r\nentertainment and edification of the respectable citizens who usually\r\nattend exhibitions of the kind.\r\n\r\nSuch was the punishment of all petty delinquents, vagrants, and beggars\r\nand others detected in being guilty of poverty in a small way. As to those\r\nwho had offended on a great scale, who had been guilty of flagrant\r\nmisfortunes and enormous backslidings of the purse, and who stood\r\nconvicted of large debts which they were unable to pay, William Kieft had\r\nthem straightway enclosed within the stone walls of a prison, there to\r\nremain until they should reform and grow rich. This notable expedient,\r\nhowever, does not appear to have been more efficacious under William the\r\nTesty than in more modern days, it being found that the longer a poor\r\ndevil was kept in prison the poorer he grew.\r\n\r\nEND OF VOLUME I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKNICKERBOCKER'S\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF NEW YORK.\r\n\r\nVOLUME II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe playful devices by which attention was directed to the coming\r\npublication of the History of Diedrich Knickerbocker are represented in\r\nthe author's opening to the first volume. Irving joined afterward in\r\nbusiness as a sleeping partner, visited England in 1815, and, while\r\ncordially welcomed here by Thomas Campbell, Walter Scott, and others, the\r\nfailure of his brother's business obliged him to make writing his\r\nprofession. The publishers at first refused to take one of the most\r\ncharming of his works, the \"Sketch Book\"; but John Murray yielded at last\r\nto the influence of Walter Scott, and paid £200 for the copyright of it, a\r\nsum afterward increased to £400. \"Bracebridge Hall\" and the \"Tales of a\r\nTraveler\" followed. Irving went to Spain with the American Ambassador to\r\ntranslate documents and acquire experience which he used afterward in\r\nsuccessive books. \"The Life and Voyages of Columbus\" appeared in 1828, and\r\nwas followed by \"Voyages of the Companions of Columbus.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1829 Washington Irving came again to England, this time as Secretary to\r\nthe American Legation. He published the \"Conquest of Granada.\" In 1831 he\r\nreceived the honorary degree of LL.D. from the University of Oxford. Then\r\nhe returned to America, published in 1832 \"The Alhambra;\" in 1835 \"Legends\r\nof the Conquest of Spain.\" In 1842 he went again to Spain, this time as\r\nAmerican Minister. Other works were produced, and at the close of his life\r\nhe achieved his early ambition, by writing a Life of Washington, after\r\nwhom he had been named, and who had laid his hand upon his head and\r\nblessed him when he was a child of five. Although the first of the five\r\nvolumes of the Life of Washington did not appear until he was more than\r\nseventy years old, he lived to complete his work, and died on the 28th of\r\nNovember, 1859. Washington Irving never married. He had loved in his early\r\nyears a daughter of his friend Mrs. Hoffman, had sat by her death-bed when\r\nshe was a girl of seventeen, and waited until his own death restored her\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nH.M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF NEW YORK\r\n\r\n_BOOK IV_. (_continued._)\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to his projects for the suppression of poverty may be classed those\r\nof William the Testy for increasing the wealth of New Amsterdam. Solomon\r\nof whose character for wisdom the little governor was somewhat emulous,\r\nhad made gold and silver as plenty as the stones in the streets of\r\nJerusalem. William Kieft could not pretend to vie with him as to the\r\nprecious metals, but he determined, as an equivalent, to flood the streets\r\nof New Amsterdam with Indian money. This was nothing more nor less than\r\nstrings of beads wrought out of clams, periwinkles, and other shell-fish,\r\nand called seawant or wampum. These had formed a native currency among the\r\nsimple savages, who were content to take them of the Dutchmen in exchange\r\nfor peltries. In an unlucky moment, William the Testy, seeing this money\r\nof easy production, conceived the project of making it the current coin of\r\nthe province. It is true it had an intrinsic value among the Indians, who\r\nused it to ornament their robes and moccasins; but among the honest\r\nburghers it had no more intrinsic value than those rags which form the\r\npaper currency of modern days. This consideration, however, had no weight\r\nwith William Kieft. He began by paying all the servants of the company and\r\nall the debts of government, in strings of wampum. He sent emissaries to\r\nsweep the shores of Long Island, which was the Ophir of this modern\r\nSolomon, and abounded in shell-fish. These were transported in loads to\r\nNew Amsterdam, coined into Indian money, and launched into circulation.\r\n\r\nAnd now for a time affairs went on swimmingly; money became as plentiful\r\nas in the modern days of paper currency, and, to use the popular phrase,\r\n\"a wonderful impulse was given to public prosperity.\" Yankee traders\r\npoured into the province, buying everything they could lay their hands on,\r\nand paying the worthy Dutchmen their own price--in Indian money. If the\r\nlatter, however, attempted to pay the Yankees in the same coin for their\r\ntinware and wooden bowls the case was altered; nothing would do but Dutch\r\nguilders, and such-like \"metallic currency.\" What was worse, the Yankees\r\nintroduced an inferior kind of wampum, made of oyster shells, with which\r\nthey deluged the province, carrying off all the silver and gold, the Dutch\r\nherrings and Dutch cheeses: thus early did the knowing men of the East\r\nmanifest their skill in bargaining the New Amsterdammers out of the\r\noyster, and leaving them the shell.[36]\r\n\r\nIt was a long time before William the Testy was made sensible how\r\ncompletely his grand project of finance was turned against him by his\r\neastern neighbors; nor would he probably have ever found it out had not\r\ntidings been brought him that the Yankees had made a descent upon Long\r\nIsland, and had established a kind of mint at Oyster Bay, where they were\r\ncoining up all the oyster banks.\r\n\r\nNow this was making a vital attack upon the province in a double sense,\r\nfinancial and gastronomical. Ever since the council dinner of Oloffe the\r\nDreamer, at the founding of New Amsterdam, at which banquet the oyster\r\nfigured so conspicuously, this divine shell-fish has been held in a kind\r\nof superstitious reverence at the Manhattoes; as witness the temples\r\nerected to its cult in every street and lane and alley. In fact, it is the\r\nstandard luxury of the place, as is the terrapin at Philadelphia, the soft\r\ncrab at Baltimore, or the canvas-back at Washington.\r\n\r\nThe seizure of Oyster Bay, therefore, was an outrage not merely on the\r\npockets, but on the larders of the New Amsterdammers; the whole community\r\nwas aroused, and an oyster crusade was immediately set on foot against the\r\nYankees. Every stout trencherman hastened to the standard; nay, some of\r\nthe most corpulent burgomasters and schepens joined the expedition as a\r\n_corps de reserve_, only to be called into action when the sacking\r\ncommenced.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the expedition was entrusted to a valiant Dutchman, who,\r\nfor size and weight, might have matched with Colbrand, the Danish\r\nchampion, slain by Guy of Warwick. He was famous throughout the province\r\nfor strength of arm and skill at quarter-staff, and hence was named\r\nStoffel Brinkerhoff; or rather, Brinkerhoofd; that is to say, Stoffel the\r\nHead-breaker.\r\n\r\nThis sturdy commander, who was a man of few words but vigorous deeds, led\r\nhis troops resolutely on through Nineveh, and Babylon, and Jericho, and\r\nPatch-hog, and other Long Island towns, without encountering any\r\ndifficulty of note, though it is said that some of the burgomasters gave\r\nout at Hard-scramble Hill and Hungry Hollow; and that others lost heart,\r\nand turned back at Puss-panick. With the rest he made good his march until\r\nhe arrived in the neighborhood of Oyster Bay.\r\n\r\nHere he was encountered by a host of Yankee warriors, headed by Preserved\r\nFish, and Habakkuk Nutter, and Return Strong, and Zerubbabel Fisk, and\r\nDetermined Cock! at the sound of whose names Stoffel Brinkerhoff verily\r\nbelieved the whole parliament of Praise-God Barebones had been let loose\r\nupon him. He soon found, however, that they were merely the \"select men\"\r\nof the settlement, armed with no weapon but the tongue, and disposed only\r\nto meet him on the field of argument. Stoffel had but one mode of\r\narguing--that was with the cudgel; but he used it with such effect that he\r\nrouted his antagonists, broke up the settlement, and would have driven the\r\ninhabitants into the sea, if they had not managed to escape across the\r\nSound to the mainland by the Devil's Stepping-stones, which remain to this\r\nday monuments of this great Dutch victory over the Yankees.\r\n\r\nStoffel Brinkerhoff made great spoil of oysters and clams, coined and\r\nuncoined, and then set out on his return to the Manhattoes. A grand\r\ntriumph, after the manner of the ancients, was prepared for him by William\r\nthe Testy. He entered New Amsterdam as a conqueror, mounted on a\r\nNarraganset pacer. Five dried codfish on poles, standards taken from the\r\nenemy, were borne before him; and an immense store of oysters and clams,\r\nWeathersfield onions, and Yankee \"notions\" formed the _spolia opima;_\r\nwhile several coiners of oyster-shells were led captive to grace the\r\nhero's triumph.\r\n\r\nThe procession was accompanied by a full band of boys and negroes,\r\nperforming on the popular instruments of rattle-bones and clam-shells,\r\nwhile Anthony Van Corlear sounded his trumpet from the ramparts.\r\n\r\nA great banquet was served up in the Stadthouse from the clams and oysters\r\ntaken from the enemy, while the governor sent the shells privately to the\r\nmint, and had them coined into Indian money, with which he paid his\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nIt is moreover said that the governor, calling to mind the practice among\r\nthe ancients to honor their victorious generals with public statues,\r\npassed a magnanimous decree, by which every tavern-keeper was permitted to\r\npaint the head of Stoffel Brinkerhoff upon his sign!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [36] In a manuscript record of the province, dated 1659, Library\r\n        of the New York Historical Society, is the following mention of\r\n        Indian money:--\"Seawant, alias wampum. Beads manufactured from\r\n        the Quahang or whelk, a shell-fish formerly abounding on our\r\n        coasts, but lately of more rare occurrence of two colors, black\r\n        and white; the former twice the value of the latter. Six beads of\r\n        the white and three of the black for an English penny. The\r\n        seawant depreciates from time to time. The New England people\r\n        make use of it as a means of barter, not only to carry away the\r\n        best cargoes which we send thither, but to accumulate a large\r\n        quantity of beavers' and other furs, by which the company is\r\n        defrauded of her revenues, and the merchants disappointed in\r\n        making returns with that speed with which they might wish to meet\r\n        their engagements; while their commissioners and the inhabitants\r\n        remain overstocked with seawant, a sort of currency of no value\r\n        except with the New Netherland savages,\" etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked by the observant writer of the Stuyvesant manuscript,\r\nthat under the administration of William Kieft the disposition of the\r\ninhabitants of New Amsterdam experienced an essential change, so that they\r\nbecame very meddlesome and factious. The unfortunate propensity of the\r\nlittle governor to experiment and innovation, and the frequent\r\nexacerbations of his temper, kept his council in a continual worry; and\r\nthe council being to the people at large what yeast or leaven is to a\r\nbatch, they threw the whole community in a ferment; and the people at\r\nlarge being to the city what the mind is to the body, the unhappy\r\ncommotions they underwent operated most disastrously upon New Amsterdam;\r\ninsomuch that, in certain of their paroxysms of consternation and\r\nperplexity, they begat several of the most crooked, distorted, and\r\nabominable streets, lanes, and alleys, with which this metropolis is\r\ndisfigured.\r\n\r\nThe fact was, that about this time the community, like Balaam's ass, began\r\nto grow more enlightened than its rider, and to show a disposition for\r\nwhat is called \"self-government.\" This restive propensity was first\r\nevinced in certain popular meetings, in which the burghers of New\r\nAmsterdam met to talk and smoke over the complicated affairs of the\r\nprovince, gradually obfuscating themselves with politics and tobacco\r\nsmoke. Hither resorted those idlers and squires of low degree who hang\r\nloose on society and are blown about by every wind of doctrine. Cobblers\r\nabandoned their stalls to give lessons on political economy; blacksmiths\r\nsuffered their fires to go out, while they stirred up the fires of\r\nfaction; and even tailors, though said to be the ninth parts of humanity,\r\nneglected their own measures to criticise the measures of government.\r\n\r\nStrange! that the science of government, which seems to be so generally\r\nunderstood, should invariably be denied to the only one called upon to\r\nexercise it. Not one of the politicians in question, but, take his word\r\nfor it, could have administered affairs ten times better than William the\r\nTesty.\r\n\r\nUnder the instructions of these political oracles, the good people of New\r\nAmsterdam soon became exceedingly enlightened; and, as a matter of course,\r\nexceedingly discontented. They gradually found out the fearful error in\r\nwhich they had indulged, of thinking themselves the happiest people in\r\ncreation; and were convinced that, all circumstances to the contrary not\r\nwithstanding, they were a very unhappy, deluded, and consequently ruined\r\npeople!\r\n\r\nWe are naturally prone to discontent, and avaricious after imaginary\r\ncauses of lamentation. Like lubberly monks, we belabor our own shoulders,\r\nand take a vast satisfaction in the music of our own groans. Nor is this\r\nsaid by way of paradox; daily experience shows the truth of these\r\nobservations. It is almost impossible to elevate the spirits of a man\r\ngroaning under ideal calamities; but nothing is easier than to render him\r\nwretched, though on the pinnacle of felicity: as it would be an herculean\r\ntask to hoist a man to the top of a steeple, though the merest child could\r\ntopple him off thence.\r\n\r\nI must not omit to mention that these popular meetings were generally\r\nheld at some noted tavern; these public edifices possessing what in modern\r\ntimes are thought the true fountains of political inspiration. The ancient\r\nGermans deliberated upon a matter when drunk, and reconsidered it when\r\nsober. Mob politicians in modern times dislike to have two minds upon a\r\nsubject, so they both deliberate and act when drunk; by this means a world\r\nof delay is spared; and as it is universally allowed that a man when drunk\r\nsees double, it follows conclusively that he sees twice as well as his\r\nsober neighbors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilhelmus Kieft, as has already been observed, was a great legislator on a\r\nsmall scale, and had a microscopic eye in public affairs. He had been\r\ngreatly annoyed by the facetious meetings of the good people of New\r\nAmsterdam, but observing that on these occasions the pipe was ever in\r\ntheir mouth, he began to think that the pipe was at the bottom of the\r\naffair, and that there was some mysterious affinity between politics and\r\ntobacco smoke. Determined to strike at the root of the evil, he began\r\nforthwith to rail at tobacco as a noxious, nauseous weed, filthy in all\r\nits uses; and as to smoking, he denounced it as a heavy tax upon the\r\npublic pocket, a vast consumer of time, a great encourager of idleness,\r\nand a deadly bane to the prosperity and morals of the people. Finally, he\r\nissued an edict, prohibiting the smoking of tobacco throughout the New\r\nNetherlands. Ill-fated Kieft! Had he lived in the present age, and\r\nattempted to check the unbounded license of the press, he could not have\r\nstruck more sorely upon the sensibilities of the million. The pipe, in\r\nfact, was the great organ of reflection and deliberation of the New\r\nNetherlander. It was his constant companion and solace--was he gay, he\r\nsmoked: was he sad, he smoked; his pipe was never out of his mouth; it was\r\na part of his physiognomy; without it, his best friends would not know\r\nhim. Take away his pipe? You might as well take away his nose!\r\n\r\nThe immediate effect of the edict of William the Testy was a popular\r\ncommotion. A vast multitude, armed with pipes and tobacco-boxes, and an\r\nimmense supply of ammunition, sat themselves down before the governor's\r\nhouse, and fell to smoking with tremendous violence. The testy William\r\nissued forth like a wrathful spider, demanding the reason of this lawless\r\nfumigation. The sturdy rioters replied by lolling back in their seats, and\r\npuffing away with redoubled fury, raising such a murky cloud that the\r\ngovernor was fain to take refuge in the interior of his castle.\r\n\r\nA long negotiation ensued through the medium of Anthony the Trumpeter. The\r\ngovernor was at first wrathful and unyielding, but was gradually smoked\r\ninto terms. He concluded by permitting the smoking of tobacco, but he\r\nabolished the fair long pipes used in the days of Wouter Van Twiller,\r\ndenoting ease, tranquillity, and sobriety of deportment; these he\r\ncondemned as incompatible with the despatch of business; in place whereof\r\nhe substituted little captious short pipes, two inches in length, which,\r\nhe observed, could be stuck in one corner of the mouth, or twisted in the\r\nhatband, and would never be in the way. Thus ended this alarming\r\ninsurrection, which was long known by the name of the Pipe Plot, and\r\nwhich, it has been somewhat quaintly observed, did end, like most plots\r\nand seditions, in mere smoke.\r\n\r\nBut mark, O reader! the deplorable evils which did afterward result. The\r\nsmoke of these villainous little pipes, continually ascending in a cloud\r\nabout the nose, penetrated into and befogged the cerebellum, dried up all\r\nthe kindly moisture of the brain, and rendered the people who used them as\r\nvaporish and testy as the governor himself. Nay, what is worse, from\r\nbeing goodly, burly, sleek-conditioned men, they became, like our Dutch\r\nyeomanry who smoke short pipes, a lantern-jawed, smoke-dried,\r\nleather-hided race.\r\n\r\nNor was this all. From this fatal schism in tobacco pipes we may date the\r\nrise of parties in the Nieuw Nederlandts. The rich and self-important\r\nburghers who had made their fortunes, and could afford to be lazy, adhered\r\nto the ancient fashion, and formed a kind of aristocracy known as the Long\r\nPipes; while the lower order, adopting the reform of William Kieft as more\r\nconvenient in their handicraft employments, were branded with the plebeian\r\nname of Short Pipes.\r\n\r\nA third party sprang up, headed by the descendants of Robert Chewit, the\r\ncompanion of the great Hudson. These discarded pipes altogether, and took\r\nup chewing tobacco; hence they were called Quids; an appellation since\r\ngiven to those political mongrels which sometimes spring up between two\r\ngreat parties, as a mule is produced between a horse and an ass.\r\n\r\nAnd here I would note the great benefit of party distinctions in saving\r\nthe people at large the trouble of thinking. Hesiod divides mankind into\r\nthree classes--those who think for themselves, those who think as others\r\nthink, and those who do not think at all. The second class comprises the\r\ngreat mass of society; for most people require a set creed and a\r\nfile-leader. Hence the origin of party, which means a large body of\r\npeople, some few of whom think, and all the rest talk. The former take the\r\nlead and discipline the latter, prescribing what they must say, what they\r\nmust approve, what they must hoot at, whom they must support, but, above\r\nall, whom they must hate; for no one can be a right good partisan who is\r\nnot a thoroughgoing hater.\r\n\r\nThe enlightened inhabitants of the Manhattoes, therefore, being divided\r\ninto parties, were enabled to hate each other with great accuracy. And\r\nnow the great business of politics went bravely on, the Long Pipes and\r\nShort Pipes assemblings in separate beer-houses, and smoking at each\r\nother with implacable vehemence, to the great support of the state and\r\nprofit of the tavern-keepers. Some, indeed, went so far as to bespatter\r\ntheir adversaries with those odoriferous little words which smell so\r\nstrong in the Dutch language; believing, like true politicians, that they\r\nserved their party and glorified themselves in proportion as they bewrayed\r\ntheir neighbors. But, however they might differ among themselves, all\r\nparties agreed in abusing the governor, seeing that he was not a governor\r\nof their choice, but appointed by others to rule over them.\r\n\r\nUnhappy William Kieft! exclaims the sage writer of the Stuyvesant\r\nmanuscript, doomed to contend with enemies too knowing to be entrapped,\r\nand to reign over a people too wise to be governed. All his foreign\r\nexpeditions were baffled and set at naught by the all-pervading Yankees;\r\nall his home measures were canvassed and condemned by \"numerous and\r\nrespectable meetings\" of pot-house politicians.\r\n\r\nIn the multitude of counsellors, we are told, there is safety; but the\r\nmultitude of counsellors was a continual source of perplexity to William\r\nKieft. With a temperament as hot as an old radish, and a mind subject to\r\nperpetual whirlwinds and tornadoes, he never failed to get into a passion\r\nwith every one who undertook to advise him. I have observed, however, that\r\nyour passionate little men, like small boats with large sails, are easily\r\nupset or blown out of their course; so was it with William the Testy, who\r\nwas prone to be carried away by the last piece of advice blown into his\r\near. The consequence was that though a projector of the first class, yet,\r\nby continually changing his projects, he gave none a fair trial; and by\r\nendeavoring to do everything, he, in sober truth, did nothing.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the sovereign people, having got into the saddle, showed\r\nthemselves, as usual, unmerciful riders; spurring on the little governor\r\nwith harangues and petitions, and thwarting him with memorials and\r\nreproaches, in much the same way as holiday apprentices manage an unlucky\r\ndevil of a hack-horse; so that Wilhelmus Kieft was kept at a worry or a\r\ngallop throughout the whole of his administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we could but get a peep at the tally of Dame Fortune, where like a\r\nvigilant landlady she chalks up the debtor and creditor accounts of\r\nthoughtless mortals, we should find that every good is checked off by an\r\nevil; and that however we may apparently revel scot-free for a season, the\r\ntime will come when we must ruefully pay off the reckoning. Fortune, in\r\nfact, is a pestilent shrew, and, withal, an inexorable creditor; and\r\nthough for a time she may be all smiles and courtesies, and indulge us in\r\nlong credits, yet sooner or later she brings up her arrears with a\r\nvengeance, and washes out her scores with our tears. \"Since,\" says good\r\nold Boethius, \"no man can retain her at his pleasure, what are her favors\r\nbut sure prognostications of approaching trouble and calamity?\"\r\n\r\nThis is the fundamental maxim of that sage school of philosophers, the\r\nCroakers, who esteem it true wisdom to doubt and despond when other men\r\nrejoice, well knowing that happiness is at best but transient; that the\r\nhigher one is elevated on the see-saw balance of fortune, the lower must\r\nbe his subsequent depression; that he who is on the uppermost round of a\r\nladder has most to suffer from a fall, while he who is at the bottom runs\r\nvery little risk of breaking his neck by tumbling to the top.\r\n\r\nPhilosophical readers of this stamp must have doubtless indulged in\r\ndismal forebodings all through the tranquil reign of Walter the Doubter,\r\nand considered it what Dutch seamen call a weather-breeder. They will not\r\nbe surprised, therefore, that the foul weather which gathered during his\r\ndays should now be rattling from all quarters on the head of William the\r\nTesty.\r\n\r\nThe origin of some of these troubles may be traced quite back to the\r\ndiscoveries and annexations of Hans Reinier Oothout, the explorer, and\r\nWynant Ten Breeches, the land-measurer, made in the twilight days of\r\nOloffe the Dreamer, by which the territories of the Nieuw Nederlandts were\r\ncarried far to the south, to Delaware River and parts beyond. The\r\nconsequence was many disputes and brawls with the Indians, which now and\r\nthen reached the drowsy ears of Walter the Doubter and his council, like\r\nthe muttering of distant thunder from behind the mountains, without,\r\nhowever, disturbing their repose. It was not till the time of William the\r\nTesty that the thunderbolt reached the Manhattoes. While the little\r\ngovernor was diligently protecting his eastern boundaries from the\r\nYankees, word was brought him of the irruption of a vagrant colony of\r\nSwedes in the South, who had landed on the banks of the Delaware, and\r\ndisplayed the banner of that redoubtable virago Queen Christina, and taken\r\npossession of the country in her name. These had been guided in their\r\nexpedition by one Peter Minuits or Minnewits, a renegade Dutchman,\r\nformerly in the service of their High Mightinesses; but who now declared\r\nhimself governor of all the surrounding country, to which was given the\r\nname of the province of New Sweden.\r\n\r\nIt is an old saying, that \"a little pot is soon hot,\" which was the case\r\nwith William the Testy. Being a little man, he was soon in a passion, and\r\nonce in a passion he soon boiled over. Summoning his council on the\r\nreceipt of this news, he belabored the Swedes in the longest speech that\r\nhad been heard in the colony since the wordy warfare of Ten Breeches and\r\nTough Breeches. Having thus taken off the fire-edge of his valor, he\r\nresorted to his favorite measure of proclamation, and despatched a\r\ndocument of the kind, ordering the renegade Minnewits and his gang of\r\nSwedish vagabonds to leave the country immediately, under pain of\r\nvengeance of their High Mightinesses the Lords States General, and of the\r\npotentates of the Manhattoes.\r\n\r\nThis strong measure was not a whit more effectual than its predecessors\r\nwhich had been thundered against the Yankees, and William Kieft was\r\npreparing to follow it up with something still more formidable, when he\r\nreceived intelligence of other invaders on his southern frontier, who had\r\ntaken possession of the banks of the Schuylkill, and built a fort there.\r\nThey were represented as a gigantic, gunpowder race of men, exceedingly\r\nexpert at boxing, biting, gouging, and other branches of the\r\nrough-and-tumble mode of warfare, which they had learned from their\r\nprototypes and cousins-german the Virginians, to whom they have ever borne\r\nconsiderable resemblance. Like them, too, they were great roisterers, much\r\ngiven to revel on hoe-cake and bacon, mint-julep and apple toddy; whence\r\ntheir newly formed colony had already acquired the name of Merryland,\r\nwhich, with a slight modification, it retains to the present day.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Merrylanders and their cousins, the Virginians, were\r\nrepresented to William Kieft as offsets from the same original stock as\r\nhis bitter enemies the Yanokie, or Yankee, tribes of the east; having both\r\ncome over to this country for the liberty of conscience, or, in other\r\nwords, to live as they pleased; the Yankees taking to praying and\r\nmoney-making and converting Quakers, and the Southerners to horse-racing\r\nand cock-fighting and breeding negroes.\r\n\r\nAgainst these new invaders Wilhelmus Kieft immediately despatched a naval\r\narmament of two sloops and thirty men, under Jan Jansen Alpendam, who was\r\narmed to the very teeth with one of the little governor's most powerful\r\nspeeches, written in vigorous Low Dutch.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Alpendam arrived without accident in the Schuylkill, and came upon\r\nthe enemy just as they were engaged in a great \"barbecue,\" a king of\r\nfestivity or carouse much practised in Merryland. Opening upon them with\r\nthe speech of William the Testy, he denounced them as a pack of lazy,\r\ncanting, julep-tippling, cock-fighting, horse-racing, slave-driving,\r\ntavern-haunting, Sabbath-breaking, mulatto-breeding upstarts: and\r\nconcluded by ordering them to evacuate the country immediately; to which\r\nthey laconically replied in plain English, \"They'd see him d----d first!\"\r\n\r\nNow this was a reply on which neither Jan Jansen Alpendam nor Wilhelmus\r\nKieft had made any calculation. Finding himself, therefore, totally\r\nunprepared to answer so terrible a rebuff with suitable hostility, the\r\nadmiral concluded his wisest course would be to return home and report\r\nprogress. He accordingly steered his course back to New Amsterdam, where\r\nhe arrived safe, having accomplished this hazardous enterprise at small\r\nexpense of treasure, and no loss of life. His saving policy gained him the\r\nuniversal appellation of the Savior of his Country, and his services were\r\nsuitably rewarded by a shingle monument, erected by subscription on the\r\ntop of Flattenbarrack Hill, where it immortalized his name for three whole\r\nyears, when it fell to pieces and was burnt for firewood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this time, the testy little governor of the New Netherlands appears\r\nto have had his hands full, and with one annoyance and the other to have\r\nbeen kept continually on the bounce. He was on the very point of following\r\nup the expedition of Jan Jansen Alpendam by some belligerent measures\r\nagainst the marauders of Merryland, when his attention was suddenly called\r\naway by belligerent troubles springing up in another quarter, the seeds of\r\nwhich had been sown in the tranquil days of Walter the Doubter.\r\n\r\nThe reader will recollect the deep doubt into which that most pacific\r\ngovernor was thrown on Killian Van Rensellaer's taking possession of Bearn\r\nIsland by _wapen recht_. While the governor doubted and did nothing, the\r\nlordly Killian went on to complete his sturdy little castellum of\r\nRensellaersteen, and to garrison it with a number of his tenants from the\r\nHelderberg, a mountain region famous for the hardest heads and hardest\r\nfists in the province. Nicholas Koorn, a faithful squire of the patroon,\r\naccustomed to strut at his heels, wear his cast-off clothes, and imitate\r\nhis lofty bearing, was established in this post as wacht-meester. His duty\r\nit was to keep an eye on the river, and oblige every vessel that passed,\r\nunless on the service of their High Mightinesses, to strike its flag,\r\nlower its peak, and pay toll to the Lord of Rensellaersteen.\r\n\r\nThis assumption of sovereign authority within the territories of the Lords\r\nStates General, however it might have been tolerated by Walter the\r\nDoubter, had been sharply contested by William the Testy, on coming into\r\noffice and many written remonstrances had been addressed by him to Killian\r\nVan Rensellaer, to which the latter never deigned a reply. Thus by degrees\r\na sore place, or, in Hibernian parlance, a raw, had been established in\r\nthe irritable soul of the little governor, insomuch that he winced at the\r\nvery name of Rensellaersteen.\r\n\r\nNow it came to pass that, on a fine sunny day, the company's yacht, the\r\nHalf Moon, having been on one of its stated visits to Fort Aurania, was\r\nquietly tiding it down the Hudson; the commander, Govert Lockerman, a\r\nveteran Dutch skipper of few words but great bottom, was seated on the\r\nhigh poop, quietly smoking his pipe, under the shadow of the proud flag\r\nof Orange, when, on arriving abreast of Bearn Island, he was saluted by a\r\nstentorian voice from the shore, \"Lower thy flag, and be d----d to thee!\"\r\n\r\nGovert Lockerman, without taking his pipe out of his mouth, turned up his\r\neye from under his broad-brimmed hat to see who hailed him thus\r\ndiscourteously. There, on the ramparts of the forts, stood Nicholas Koorn,\r\narmed to the teeth, flourishing a brass-hilted sword, while a\r\nsteeple-crowned hat and cock's tail-feather, formerly worn by Killian Van\r\nRensellaer himself, gave an inexpressible loftiness to his demeanor.\r\n\r\nGovert Lockerman eyed the warrior from top to toe, but was not to be\r\ndismayed. Taking the pipe slowly out of his mouth, \"To whom should I lower\r\nmy flag?\" demanded he. \"To the high and mighty Killian Van Rensellaer, the\r\nlord of Rensellaersteen!\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"I lower it to none but the Prince Orange and my masters, the Lords States\r\nGeneral.\" So saying, he resumed his pipe and smoked with an air of dogged\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\nBang! went a gun from the fortress; the ball cut both sail and rigging.\r\nGovert Lockerman said nothing, but smoked the more doggedly.\r\n\r\nBang! went another gun; the shot whistling close astern.\r\n\r\n\"Fire, and be d----d,\" cried Govert Lockerman, cramming a new charge of\r\ntobacco into his pipe, and smoking with still increasing vehemence.\r\n\r\nBang! went a third gun. The shot passed over his head, tearing a hole in\r\nthe \"princely flag of Orange.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the hardest trial of all for the pride and patience of Govert\r\nLockerman; he maintained a stubborn though swelling silence, but his\r\nsmothered rage might be perceived by the short vehement puffs of smoke\r\nemitted from his pipe, by which he might be tracked for miles, as he\r\nslowly floated out of shot and out of sight of Bearn Island. In fact, he\r\nnever gave vent to his passion until he got fairly among the Highlands of\r\nthe Hudson, when he let fly whole volleys of Dutch oaths, which are said\r\nto linger to this very day among the echoes of the Dunderberg, and to give\r\nparticular effect to the thunder-storms in that neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIt was the sudden apparition of Govert Lockerman at Dog's Misery, bearing\r\nin his hand the tattered flag of Orange, that arrested the attention of\r\nWilliam the Testy, just as he was devising a new expedition against the\r\nmarauders of Merryland. I will not pretend to describe the passion of the\r\nlittle man when he heard of the outrage of Rensellaersteen. Suffice it to\r\nsay, in the first transports of his fury, he turned Dog's Misery\r\ntopsy-turvy, kicked every cur out of doors, and threw the cats out of the\r\nwindow; after which, his spleen being in some measure relieved, he went\r\ninto a council of war with Govert Lockerman, the skipper, assisted by\r\nAnthony Van Corlear, the trumpeter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eyes of all New Amsterdam were now turned to see what would be the end\r\nof this direful feud between William the Testy and the patron of\r\nRensellaerwick; and some, observing the consultations of the governor with\r\nthe skipper and the trumpeter, predicted warlike measures by sea and land.\r\nThe wrath of William Kieft, however, though quick to rise, was quick to\r\nevaporate. He was a perfect brush-heap in a blaze, snapping and crackling\r\nfor a time, and then ending in smoke. Like many other valiant potentates,\r\nhis first thoughts were all for war, his sober second thoughts for\r\ndiplomacy.\r\n\r\nAccordingly Govert Lockerman was once more despatched up the river in the\r\ncompany's yacht, the Goed Hoop, bearing Anthony the Trumpeter as\r\nambassador, to treat with the belligerent powers of Rensellaersteen. In\r\nthe fulness of time the yacht arrived before Bearn Island, and Anthony the\r\nTrumpeter, mounting the poop, sounded a parly to the forces. In a little\r\nwhile the steeple-crowned hat of Nicholas Koorn, the wacht-meester, rose\r\nabove the battlements, followed by his iron visage, and ultimately his\r\nwhole person, armed, as before, to the very teeth; while one by one a\r\nwhole row of Helderbergers reared their round burly heads above the wall,\r\nand beside each pumpkin-head peered the end of a rusty musket. Nothing\r\ndaunted by this formidable array, Anthony Van Corlear drew forth and read\r\nwith audible voice a missive from William the Testy, protesting against\r\nthe usurpation of Bearn Island, and ordering the garrison to quit the\r\npremises, bag and baggage, on pain of the vengeance of the potentate of\r\nthe Manhattoes.\r\n\r\nIn reply, the wacht-meester applied the thumb of his right hand to the end\r\nof his nose, and the thumb of the left hand to the little finger of the\r\nright, and spreading each hand like a fan, made an aerial flourish with\r\nhis fingers. Anthony Van Corlear was sorely perplexed to understand this\r\nsign, which seemed to him something mysterious and masonic. Not liking to\r\nbetray his ignorance, he again read with a loud voice the missive of\r\nWilliam the Testy, and again Nicholas Koorn applied the thumb of his right\r\nhand to the end of his nose, and the thumb of his left hand to the little\r\nfinger of the right, and repeated this kind of nasal weathercock. Anthony\r\nVan Corlear now persuaded himself that this was some short-hand sign or\r\nsymbol, current in diplomacy, which, though unintelligible to a new\r\ndiplomat like himself, would speak volumes to the experienced intellect of\r\nWilliam the Testy. Considering his embassy therefore at an end, he sounded\r\nhis trumpet with great complacency, and set sail on his return down the\r\nriver, every now and then practising this mysterious sign of the\r\nwacht-meester, to keep it accurately in mind.\r\n\r\nArrived at New Amsterdam, he made a faithful report of his embassy to the\r\ngovernor, accompanied by a manual exhibition of the response of Nicholas\r\nKoorn. The governor was equally perplexed with his ambassador. He was\r\ndeeply versed in the mysteries of freemasonry, but they threw no light on\r\nthe matter. He knew ever variety of windmill and weathercock, but was not\r\na whit the wiser as to the aerial sign in question. He had even dabbled in\r\nEgyptian hieroglyphics, and the mystic symbols of the obelisk, but none\r\nfurnished a key to the reply of Nicholas Koorn. He called a meeting of his\r\ncouncil. Anthony Van Corlear stood forth in the midst, and putting the\r\nthumb of his right hand to his nose, and the thumb of his left hand to the\r\nfinger of the right, he gave a faithful fac-simile of the portentous sign.\r\nHaving a nose of unusual dimensions, it was as if the reply had been put\r\nin capitals, but all in vain, the worthy burgomasters were equally\r\nperplexed with the governor. Each one put his thumb to the end of his\r\nnose, spread his fingers like a fan, imitated the motion of Anthony Van\r\nCorlear, then smoked on in dubious silence. Several times was Anthony\r\nobliged to stand forth like a fugleman and repeat the sign, and each time\r\na circle of nasal weathercocks might be seen in the council chamber.\r\n\r\nPerplexed in the extreme, William the Testy sent for all the soothsayers\r\nand fortune tellers and wise men of the Manhattoes, but none could\r\ninterpret the mysterious reply of Nicholas Koorn. The council broke up in\r\nsore perplexity. The matter got abroad; Anthony Van Corlear was stopped at\r\nevery corner to repeat the signal to a knot of anxious newsmongers, each\r\nof whom departed with his thumb to his nose and his fingers in the air, to\r\ncarry the story home of his family. For several days all business was\r\nneglected in New Amsterdam; nothing was talked of but the diplomatic\r\nmission of Anthony the Trumpeter, nothing was to be seen but knots of\r\npoliticians with their thumbs to their noses. In the meantime the fierce\r\nfeud between William the Testy and Killian Van Rensellaer, which at first\r\nhad menaced deadly warfare, gradually cooled off, like many other war\r\nquestions, in the prolonged delays of diplomacy.\r\n\r\nStill, to this early affair of Rensellaersteen may be traced the remote\r\norigin of those windy wars in modern days which rage in the bowels of the\r\nHelderberg, and have well nigh shaken the great patroonship of the Van\r\nRensellaers to its foundation: for we are told that the bully boys of the\r\nHelderberg, who served under Nicholas Koorn, the wacht-meester, carried\r\nback to their mountains the hieroglyphic sign which had so sorely puzzled\r\nAnthony Van Corlear and the sages of the Manhattoes; so that to the\r\npresent day, the thumb to the nose and the fingers in the air is apt to be\r\nthe reply of the Helderbergers whenever called upon for any long arrears\r\nof rent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was asserted by the wise men of ancient times who had a nearer\r\nopportunity of ascertaining the fact, that at the gate of Jupiter's palace\r\nlay two huge tuns, one filled with blessings, the other with misfortunes;\r\nand it would verily seem as if the latter had been completely overturned,\r\nand left to deluge the unlucky province of Nieuw Nederlandts; for about\r\nthis time, while harassed and annoyed from the south and the north,\r\nincessant forays were made by the border chivalry of Connecticut upon the\r\npig-sties and hen-roosts of the Nederlanders. Every day or two some\r\nbroad-bottomed express rider, covered with mud and mire, would come\r\nfloundering into the gate of New Amsterdam, freighted with some new tale\r\nof aggression from the frontier; whereupon Anthony Van Corlear, seizing\r\nhis trumpet, the only substitute for a newspaper in those primitive days,\r\nwould sound the tidings from the ramparts with such doleful notes and\r\ndisastrous cadence, as to throw half the old women in the city into\r\nhysterics; all which tended greatly to increase his popularity, there\r\nbeing nothing for which the public are more grateful than being frequently\r\ntreated to a panic--a secret well known to modern editors.\r\n\r\nBut oh, ye powers! into what a paroxysm of passion did each new outrage of\r\nthe Yankees throw the choleric little governor! Letter after letter,\r\nprotest after protest, bad Latin, worse English, and hideous Low Dutch,\r\nwere incessantly fulminated upon them, and the four-and-twenty letters of\r\nthe alphabet, which formed his standing army, were worn out by constant\r\ncampaigning. All, however, was ineffectual; even the recent victory at\r\nOyster Bay, which had shed such a gleam of sunshine between the clouds of\r\nhis foul weather reign, was soon followed by a more fearful gathering up\r\nof those clouds and indications of more portentous tempests; for the\r\nYankee tribe on the banks of the Connecticut, finding on this memorable\r\noccasion their incompetency to cope in fair fight with the sturdy chivalry\r\nof the Manhattoes, had called to their aid all the ten tribes of their\r\nbrethren who inhabit the east country, which from them has derived the\r\nname of Yankee land. This call was promptly responded to. The consequence\r\nwas a great confederacy of the tribes of Massachusetts, Connecticut, New\r\nPlymouth, and New Haven, under the title of the \"United Colonies of New\r\nEngland;\" the pretended object of which was mutual defense against the\r\nsavages, but the real object the subjugation of the Nieuw Nederlandts.\r\n\r\nFor, to let the reader into one of the greatest secrets of history, the\r\nNieuw Nederlandts had long been regarded by the whole Yankee race as the\r\nmodern land of promise, and themselves as the chosen and peculiar people\r\ndestined, one day or other, by hook or by crook, to get possession of it.\r\nIn truth, they are a wonderful and all-prevalent people; of that class who\r\nonly require an inch to gain an ell; or a halter to gain a horse. From the\r\ntime they first gained a foothold on Plymouth Rock, they began to migrate,\r\nprogressing and progressing from place to place, and land to land, making\r\na little here and a little there, and controverting the old proverb, that\r\na rolling stone gathers no moss. Hence they have facetiously received the\r\nnickname of \"The Pilgrims,\" that is to say, a people who are always\r\nseeking a better country than their own.\r\n\r\nThe tidings of this great Yankee league struck William Kieft with dismay,\r\nand for once in his life he forgot to bounce on receiving a disagreeable\r\npiece of intelligence. In fact, on turning over in his mind all that he\r\nhad read at the Hague about leagues and combinations, he found that this\r\nwas a counterpart of the Amphictyonic League, by which the states of\r\nGreece attained such power and supremacy; and the very idea made his heart\r\nquake for the safety of his empire at the Manhattoes.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of the confederacy were managed by an annual council of\r\ndelegates held at Boston, which Kieft denominated the Delphos of this\r\ntruly classic league. The very first meeting gave evidence of hostility to\r\nthe New Nederlanders, who were charged, in their dealings with the\r\nIndians, with carrying on a traffic in \"guns, powther, and shott--a trade\r\ndamnable and injurious to the colonists.\" It is true the Connecticut\r\ntraders were fain to dabble a little in this damnable traffic; but then\r\nthey always dealt in what were termed Yankee guns, ingeniously calculated\r\nto burst in the pagan hands which used them.\r\n\r\nThe rise of this potent confederacy was a death-blow to the glory of\r\nWilliam the Testy, for from that day forward he never held up his head,\r\nbut appeared quite crestfallen. It is true, as the grand council augmented\r\nin power, and the league, rolling onward, gathered about the red hills of\r\nNew Haven, threatening to overwhelm the Nieuw Nederlandts, he continued\r\noccasionally to fulminate proclamations and protests, as a shrewd sea\r\ncaptain fires his guns into a water spout, but, alas! they had no more\r\neffect than so many blank cartridges.\r\n\r\nThus end the authenticated chronicles of the reign of William the Testy,\r\nfor henceforth, in the troubles, perplexities, and confusion of the times,\r\nhe seems to have been totally overlooked, and to have slipped for ever\r\nthrough the fingers of scrupulous history. It is a matter of deep concern\r\nthat such obscurity should hang over his latter days; for he was in truth\r\na mighty and great little man, and worthy of being utterly renowned,\r\nseeing that he was the first potentate that introduced into this land the\r\nart of fighting by proclamation, and defending a country by trumpeters and\r\nwindmills.\r\n\r\nIt is true that certain of the early provincial poets, of whom there were\r\ngreat numbers in the Nieuw Nederlandts, taking advantage of his mysterious\r\nexit, have fabled that, like Romulus, he was translated to the skies, and\r\nforms a very fiery little star, somewhere on the left claw of the crab;\r\nwhile others, equally fanciful, declare that he had experienced a fate\r\nsimilar to that of the good King Arthur, who, we are assured by ancient\r\nbards, was carried away to the delicious abodes of fairyland, where he\r\nstill exists in pristine worth and vigor, and will one day or another\r\nreturn to restore the gallantry, the honor, and the immaculate probity,\r\nwhich prevailed in the glorious days of the Round Table.[37]\r\n\r\nAll these, however, are but pleasing fantasies, the cobweb visions of\r\nthose dreaming varlets the poets, to which I would not have my judicious\r\nreader attach any credibility. Neither am I disposed to credit an ancient\r\nand rather apocryphal historian, who asserts that the ingenious Wilhelmus\r\nwas annihilated by the blowing down of one of his windmills, nor a writer\r\nof later times, who affirms that he fell a victim to an experiment in\r\nnatural history, having the misfortune to break his neck from a garret\r\nwindow of the stadthouse in attempting to catch swallows by sprinkling\r\nsalt upon their tails. Still less do I put my faith in the tradition that\r\nhe perished at sea in conveying home to Holland a treasure of golden ore,\r\ndiscovered somewhere among the haunted regions of the Catskill\r\nmountains.[38]\r\n\r\nThe most probable account declares, that what with the constant troubles\r\non his frontiers--the incessant schemings and projects going on in his own\r\npericranium--the memorials, petitions, remonstrances, and sage pieces of\r\nadvice of respectable meetings of the sovereign people, and the refractory\r\ndisposition of his councillors, who were sure to differ from him on every\r\npoint, and uniformly to be in the wrong--his mind was kept in a furnace\r\nheat, until he became as completely burnt out as a Dutch family pipe which\r\nhas passed through three generations of hard smokers. In this manner did\r\nhe undergo a kind of animal combustion consuming away like a farthing\r\nrushlight, so that when grim Death finally snuffed him out, there was\r\nscarcely left enough of him to bury!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [37] \"The old Welsh bards believed that King Arthur was not dead,\r\n        but carried awaie by the fairies into some pleasant place, where\r\n        he sholde remaine for a time, and then returne againe and reigne\r\n        in as great authority as ever.\"--_Holinshed_.\r\n\r\n        \"The Britons suppose that he shall come yet and conquere all\r\n        Britaigne; for, certes, this is the prophicye of Merlyn--He say'd\r\n        that his deth shall be doubteous; and said soth, for men thereof\r\n        yet have doubte and shullen for evermore, for men wyt not whether\r\n        that he lyveth or is dede.\"--_De Leew Chron_.\r\n\r\n   [38] Diedrich Knickerbocker, in his scrupulous search after\r\n        truth, is sometimes too fastidious in regard to facts which\r\n        border a little on the marvelous. The story of the golden ore\r\n        rests on something better than mere tradition. The venerable\r\n        Adrian Van der Donck, Doctor of Laws, in his description of the\r\n        New Netherlands, asserts it from his own observation as an\r\n        eye-witness. He was present, he says, in 1645, at a treaty\r\n        between Governor Kieft and the Mohawk Indians, in which one of\r\n        the latter, in painting himself for the ceremony, used a pigment,\r\n        the weight and shining appearance of which excited the curiosity\r\n        of the governor and Mynheer Van der Donck. They obtained a lump\r\n        and gave it to be proved by a skillful doctor of medicine,\r\n        Johannes de la Montagne, one of the councillors of the New\r\n        Netherlands. It was put into a crucible, and yielded two pieces\r\n        of gold worth about three guilders. All this, continues Adrian\r\n        Van der Donck, was kept secret. As soon as peace was made with\r\n        the Mohawks, an officer and a few men were sent to the mountain,\r\n        in the region of the Kaatskill, under the guidance of an Indian,\r\n        to search for the precious mineral. They brought back a bucketful\r\n        of ore, which, being submitted to the crucible, proved as\r\n        productive as the first. William Kieft now thought the discovery\r\n        certain. He sent a confidential person, Arent Corsen, with a\r\n        bagful of the mineral to New Haven, to take passage in an English\r\n        ship for England, thence to proceed to Holland. The vessel sailed\r\n        at Christmas, but never reached her port. All on board\r\n        perished.[A]\r\n\r\n        In the year 1647, Wilhelmus Kieft himself embarked on board the\r\n        _Princess_, taking with him specimens of the supposed mineral.\r\n        The ship was never heard of more!\r\n\r\n        Some have supposed that the mineral in question was not gold, but\r\n        pyrites; but we have the assertion of Adrian Van der Donck, an\r\n        eye-witness, and the experiment of Johannes de la Montagne, a\r\n        learned doctor of medicine, on the golden side of the question.\r\n        Cornelius Van Tienhooven, also, at that time secretary of the New\r\n        Netherlands, declared, in Holland, that he had tested several\r\n        specimens of the mineral, which proved satisfactory. It would\r\n        appear, however, that these golden treasures of the Kaatskill\r\n        always brought ill luck; as is evidenced in the fate of Arent\r\n        Corsen and Wilhelmus Kieft, and the wreck of the ships in which\r\n        they attempted to convey the treasure across the ocean. The\r\n        golden mines have never since been explored, but remain among the\r\n        mysteries of the Kaatskill mountains, and under the protection of\r\n        the goblins which haunt them.\r\n\r\n        [A] See Van der Donck's description of the New Netherlands,\r\n            Collect.

Much as we may think of\r\nourselves, and much as we may excite the empty plaudits of the million, it\r\nis certain that the greatest among us do actually fill but an exceedingly\r\nsmall space in the world; and it is equally certain, that even that small\r\nspace is quickly supplied when we leave it vacant. \"Of what consequence is\r\nit,\" said Pliny, \"that individuals appear, or make their exit? the world\r\nis a theater whose scenes and actors are continually changing.\" Never did\r\nphilosopher speak more correctly, and I only wonder that so wise a remark\r\ncould have existed so many ages, and mankind not have laid it more to\r\nheart. Sage follows on in the footsteps of sage; one hero just steps out\r\nof his triumphal car, to make way for the hero who comes after him; and of\r\nthe proudest monarch it is merely said that, \"he slept with his fathers,\r\nand his successor reigned in his stead.\"\r\n\r\nThe world, to tell the private truth, cares but little for their loss,\r\nand, if left to itself, would soon forget to grieve; and though a nation\r\nhas often been figuratively drowned in tears on the death of a great man,\r\nyet it is ten to one if an individual tear has been shed on the occasion,\r\nexcepting from the forlorn pen of some hungry author. It is the historian,\r\nthe biographer, and the poet, who have the whole burden of grief to\r\nsustain; who, kind souls! like undertakers in England, act the part of\r\nchief mourners; who inflate a nation with sighs it never heaved, and\r\ndeluge it with tears it never dreamt of shedding. Thus, while the\r\npatriotic author is weeping and howling in prose, in blank verse, and in\r\nrhyme, and collecting the drops of public sorrow into his volume, as into\r\na lachrymal vase, it is more than probable his fellow-citizens are eating\r\nand drinking, fiddling and dancing, as utterly ignorant of the bitter\r\nlamentations made in their name as are those men of straw, John Doe and\r\nRichard Roe, of the plaintiffs for whom they are generously pleased to\r\nbecome sureties.\r\n\r\nThe most glorious hero that ever desolated nations might have mouldered\r\ninto oblivion among the rubbish of his own monument, did not some\r\nhistorian take him into favor, and benevolently transmit his name to\r\nposterity; and much as the valiant William Kieft worried, and bustled, and\r\nturmoiled, while he had the destinies of a whole colony in his hand, I\r\nquestion seriously whether he will not be obliged to this authentic\r\nhistory for all his future celebrity.\r\n\r\nHis exit occasioned no convulsion in the city of New Amsterdam nor its\r\nvicinity; the earth trembled not, neither did any stars shoot from their\r\nspheres; the heavens were not shrouded in black, as poets would fain\r\npersuade us they have been, on the death of a hero; the rocks\r\n(hard-hearted varlets!) melted not into tears, nor did the trees hang\r\ntheir heads in silent sorrow; and as to the sun, he lay abed the next\r\nnight just as long, and showed as jolly a face when he rose, as he ever\r\ndid, on the same day of the month in any year, either before or since. The\r\ngood people of New Amsterdam, one and all, declared that he had been a\r\nvery busy, active, bustling little governor; that he was \"the father of\r\nhis country;\" that he was \"the noblest work of God;\" that \"he was a man,\r\ntake him for all in all, they ne'er should look upon his like again;\"\r\ntogether with sundry other civil and affectionate speeches, regularly said\r\non the death of all great men; after which they smoked their pipes,\r\nthought no more about him, and Peter Stuyvesant succeeded to his station.\r\n\r\nPeter Stuyvesant was the last, and, like the renowned Wouter Van Twiller,\r\nthe best of our ancient Dutch governors; Wouter having surpassed all who\r\npreceded him, and Pieter, or Piet, as he was sociably called by the old\r\nDutch burghers, who were ever prone to familiarize names, having never\r\nbeen equalled by any successor. He was, in fact, the very man fitted by\r\nNature to retrieve the desperate fortunes of her beloved province, had not\r\nthe Fates, those most potent and unrelenting of all ancient spinsters,\r\ndestined them to inextricable confusion.\r\n\r\nTo say merely that he was a hero would be doing him great injustice; he\r\nwas, in truth, a combination of heroes; for he was of a sturdy, raw-boned\r\nmake, like Ajax Telamon, with a pair of round shoulders that Hercules\r\nwould have given his hide for (meaning his lion's hide) when he undertook\r\nto ease old Atlas of his load. He was, moreover, as Plutarch describes\r\nCoriolanus, not only terrible for the force of his arm, but likewise for\r\nhis voice, which sounded as though it came out of a barrel; and, like the\r\nself-same warrior, he possessed a sovereign contempt for the sovereign\r\npeople, and an iron aspect, which was enough of itself to make the very\r\nbowels of his adversaries quake with terror and dismay. All this martial\r\nexcellency of appearance was inexpressibly heightened by an accidental\r\nadvantage, with which I am surprised that neither Homer nor Virgil have\r\ngraced any of their heroes.\r\n\r\nThis was nothing less than a wooden leg, which was the only prize he had\r\ngained in bravely fighting the battles of his country, but of which he was\r\nso proud, that he was often heard to declare he valued it more than all\r\nhis other limbs put together; indeed, so highly did he esteem it, that he\r\nhad it gallantly enchased and relieved with silver devices, which caused\r\nit to be related in divers histories and legends that he wore a silver\r\nleg.[39]\r\n\r\nLike that choleric warrior Achilles, he was somewhat subject to extempore\r\nbursts of passion, which were rather unpleasant to his favorites and\r\nattendants, whose perceptions he was apt to quicken after the manner of\r\nhis illustrious imitator, Peter the Great, by anointing their shoulders\r\nwith his walking staff.\r\n\r\nThough I cannot find that he had read Plato, or Aristotle, or Hobbes, or\r\nBacon, or Algernon Sydney, or Tom Paine, yet did he sometimes manifest a\r\nshrewdness and sagacity in his measures that one would hardly expect from\r\na man who did not know Greek and had never studied the ancients. True it\r\nis, and I confess it with sorrow, that he had an unreasonable aversion to\r\nexperiments, and was fond of governing his province after the simplest\r\nmanner; but then he contrived to keep it in better order than did the\r\nerudite Kieft, though he had all the philosophers, ancient and modern, to\r\nassist and perplex him. I must likewise own that he made but very few\r\nlaws, but then again he took care that those few were rigidly and\r\nimpartially enforced; and I do not know but justice, on the whole, was as\r\nwell administered as if there had been volumes of sage acts and statutes\r\nyearly made, and daily neglected and forgotten.\r\n\r\nHe was, in fact, the very reverse of his predecessors, being neither\r\ntranquil and inert, like Walter the Doubter, nor restless and fidgeting,\r\nlike William the Testy; but a man, or rather a governor, of such uncommon\r\nactivity and decision of mind, that he never sought nor accepted the\r\nadvice of others, depending bravely upon his single head, as would a hero\r\nof yore upon his single arm, to carry him through all difficulties and\r\ndangers. To tell the simple truth, he wanted nothing more to complete him\r\nas a statesman than to think always right, for no one can say but that he\r\nalways acted as he thought. He was never a man to flinch when he found\r\nhimself in a scrape, but to dash forward through thick and thin, trusting,\r\nby hook or by crook, to make all things straight in the end. In a word, he\r\npossessed in an eminent degree that great quality in a statesman, called\r\nperseverance by the polite, but nicknamed obstinacy by the vulgar. A\r\nwonderful salve for official blunders; since he who perseveres in error\r\nwithout flinching gets the credit of boldness and consistency, while he\r\nwho wavers, in seeking to do what is right, gets stigmatised as a trimmer.\r\nThis much is certain, and it is a maxim well worthy the attention of all\r\nlegislators great and small, who stand shaking in the wind, irresolute\r\nwhich way to steer, that a ruler who follows his own will pleases himself,\r\nwhile he who seeks to satisfy the wishes and whims of others runs great\r\nrisk of pleasing nobody. There is nothing, too, like putting down one's\r\nfoot resolutely when in doubt, and letting things take their course. The\r\nclock that stands still points right twice in the four-and-twenty hours,\r\nwhile others may keep going continually, and be continually going wrong.\r\n\r\nNor did this magnanimous quality escape the discernment of the good people\r\nof Nieuw Nederlandts; on the contrary, so much were they struck with the\r\nindependent will and vigorous resolution displayed on all occasions by\r\ntheir new governor, that they universally called him Hard Koppig Piet, or\r\nPeter the Headstrong, a great compliment to the strength of his\r\nunderstanding.\r\n\r\nIf, from all that I have said, thou dost not gather, worthy reader, that\r\nPeter Stuyvesant was a tough, sturdy, valiant, weather-beaten, mettlesome,\r\nobstinate, leathern-sided, lion-hearted, generous-spirited old governor,\r\neither I have written to but little purpose, or thou art very dull at\r\ndrawing conclusions.\r\n\r\nThis most excellent governor commenced his administration on the 29th of\r\nMay, 1647; a remarkably stormy day, distinguished in all the almanacks of\r\nthe time which have come down to us by the name of \"Windy Friday.\" As he\r\nwas very jealous of his personal and official dignity, he was inaugurated\r\ninto office with great ceremony, the goodly oaken chair of the renowned\r\nWouter Van Twiller being carefully preserved for such occasions, in like\r\nmanner as the chair and stone were reverentially preserved at Scone, in\r\nScotland, for the coronation of the Caledonian monarchs.\r\n\r\nI must not omit to mention that the tempestuous state of the elements,\r\ntogether with its being that unlucky day of the week termed \"hanging day,\"\r\ndid not fail to excite much grave speculation and divers very reasonable\r\napprehensions among the more ancient and enlightened inhabitants; and\r\nseveral of the sager sex, who were reputed to be not a little skilled in\r\nthe mysteries of astrology and fortune-telling, did declare outright that\r\nthey were omens of a disastrous administration; an event that came to be\r\nlamentably verified, and which proves beyond dispute the wisdom of\r\nattending to those preternatural intimations furnished by dreams and\r\nvisions, the flying of birds, falling of stones, and cackling of geese, on\r\nwhich the sages and rulers of ancient times placed such reliance; or to\r\nthose shootings of stars, eclipses of the moon, howlings of dogs, and\r\nflarings of candles, carefully noted and interpreted by the oracular\r\nSibyls of our day, who, in my humble opinion, are the legitimate\r\ninheritors and preservers of the ancient science of divination. This much\r\nis certain, that Governor Stuyvesant succeeded to the chair of state at a\r\nturbulent period, when foes thronged and threatened from without, when\r\nanarchy and stiff-necked opposition reigned rampant within; when the\r\nauthority of their High Mightinesses the Lords States General, though\r\nsupported by economy, and defended by speeches, protests, and\r\nproclamations, yet tottered to its very center; and when the great city of\r\nNew Amsterdam, though fortified by flag-staffs, trumpeters, and windmills,\r\nseemed, like some fair lady of easy virtue, to lie open to attack, and\r\nready to yield to the first invader.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [39] See the histories of Masters Josselyn and Blome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe very first movements of the great Peter, on taking the reins of\r\ngovernment, displayed his magnanimity, though they occasioned not a little\r\nmarvel and uneasiness among the people of the Manhattoes. Finding himself\r\nconstantly interrupted by the opposition, and annoyed by the advice of his\r\nprivy council, the members of which had acquired the unreasonable habit of\r\nthinking and speaking to themselves during the preceding reign, he\r\ndetermined at once to put a stop to such grievous abominations. Scarcely,\r\ntherefore, had he entered upon his authority, than he turned out of office\r\nall the meddlesome spirits of the factious cabinet of William the Testy;\r\nin place of whom he chose unto himself councillors from those fat,\r\nsomniferous, respectable burghers who had flourished and slumbered under\r\nthe easy reign of Walter the Doubter. All these he caused to be furnished\r\nwith abundance of fair long pipes, and to be regaled with frequent\r\ncorporation dinners, admonishing them to smoke, and eat, and sleep for the\r\ngood of the nation, while he took the burden of government upon his own\r\nshoulders--an arrangement to which they all gave hearty acquiescence.\r\n\r\nNor did he stop here, but made a hideous rout among the inventions and\r\nexpedients of his learned predecessor--rooting up his patent gallows,\r\nwhere caitiff vagabonds were suspended by the waistband; demolishing his\r\nflag-staffs and windmills, which, like mighty giants, guarded the ramparts\r\nof New Amsterdam; pitching to the Duyvel whole batteries of Quaker guns;\r\nand, in a word, turning topsy-turvy the whole philosophic, economic, and\r\nwindmill system of the immortal sage of Saardam.\r\n\r\nThe honest folk of New Amsterdam began to quake now for the fate of their\r\nmatchless champion, Antony the Trumpeter, who had acquired prodigious\r\nfavor in the eyes of the women by means of his whiskers and his trumpet.\r\nHim did Peter the Headstrong cause to be brought into his presence, and\r\neyeing him for a moment from head to foot, with a countenance that would\r\nhave appalled anything else than a sounder of brass--\"Pr'ythee, who and\r\nwhat art thou?\" said he. \"Sire,\" replied the other, in no wise dismayed,\r\n\"for my name, it is Antony Van Corlear--for my parentage, I am the son of\r\nmy mother--for my profession, I am champion and garrison of this great\r\ncity of New Amsterdam.\" \"I doubt me much,\" said Peter Stuyvesant, \"that\r\nthou art some scurvy costard-monger knave: how didst thou acquire this\r\nparamount honor and dignity?\" \"Marry, sir,\" replied the other, \"like many\r\na great man before me, simply by sounding my own trumpet.\" \"Ay, is it so?\"\r\nquoth the governor; \"why, then, let us have a relish of thy art.\"\r\nWhereupon the good Antony put his instrument to his lips, and sounded a\r\ncharge with such tremendous outset, such a delectable quaver, and such a\r\ntriumphant cadence, that it was enough to make one's heart leap out of\r\none's mouth only to be within a mile of it. Like as a war-worn charger,\r\ngrazing in peaceful plains, starts at a strain of martial music, pricks up\r\nhis ears, and snorts, and paws, and kindles at the noise, so did the\r\nheroic Peter joy to hear the clangor of the trumpet; for of him might\r\ntruly be said, what was recorded of the renowned St. George of England,\r\n\"there was nothing in all the world that more rejoiced his heart than to\r\nhear the pleasant sound of war, and see the soldiers brandish forth their\r\nsteeled weapons.\" Casting his eye more kindly, therefore, upon the sturdy\r\nVan Corlear, and finding him to be a jovial varlet, shrewd in his\r\ndiscourse, yet of great discretion and immeasurable wind, he straightway\r\nconceived a vast kindness for him, and discharging him from the\r\ntroublesome duty of garrisoning, defending, and alarming the city, ever\r\nafter retained him about his person, as his chief favorite, confidential\r\nenvoy, and trusty squire. Instead of disturbing the city with disastrous\r\nnotes, he was instructed to play so as to delight the governor while at\r\nhis repasts, as did the minstrels of yore in the days of glorious\r\nchivalry; and on all public occasions to rejoice the ears of the people\r\nwith warlike melody, thereby keeping alive a noble and martial spirit.\r\n\r\nBut the measure of the valiant Peter which produced the greatest agitation\r\nin the community was his laying his hand upon the currency. He had\r\nold-fashioned notions in favor of gold and silver, which he considered the\r\ntrue standards of wealth and mediums of commerce, and one of his first\r\nedicts was that all duties to government should be paid in those precious\r\nmetals, and that seawant, or wampum, should no longer be a legal tender.\r\n\r\nHere was a blow at public prosperity! All those who speculated on the rise\r\nand fall of this fluctuating currency found their calling at an end;\r\nthose, too, who had hoarded Indian money by barrels full, found their\r\ncapital shrunk in amount; but, above all, the Yankee traders, who were\r\naccustomed to flood the market with newly-coined oyster-shells, and to\r\nabstract Dutch merchandise in exchange, were loud-mouthed in decrying this\r\n\"tampering with the currency.\" It was clipping the wings of commerce; it\r\nwas checking the development of public prosperity; trade would be at an\r\nend; goods would moulder on the shelves; grain would rot in the granaries;\r\ngrass would grow in the marketplace. In a word, no one who has not heard\r\nthe outcries and howlings of a modern Tarshish, at any check upon \"paper\r\nmoney,\" can have any idea of the clamor against Peter the Headstrong for\r\nchecking the circulation of oyster-shells.\r\n\r\nIn fact, trade did shrink into narrower channels; but then the stream was\r\ndeep as it was broad. The honest Dutchman sold less goods; but then they\r\ngot the worth of them, either in silver and gold, or in codfish, tinware,\r\napple-brandy, Weathersfield onions, wooden bowls, and other articles of\r\nYankee barter. The ingenious people of the east, however, indemnified\r\nthemselves in another way for having to abandon the coinage of\r\noyster-shells, for about this time we are told that wooden nutmegs made\r\ntheir first appearance in New Amsterdam, to the great annoyance of the\r\nDutch housewives.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NOTE.\r\n\r\n    From a manuscript record of the province (Lib, N.Y. Hist,\r\n    Soc.).--\"We have been unable to render your inhabitants wiser,\r\n    and prevent their being, further imposed upon, than to declare,\r\n    absolutely and peremptorily, that henceforward seawant shall be\r\n    bullion--not longer admissable in trade, without any value, as it\r\n    is indeed. So that every one may be upon his guard to barter no\r\n    longer away his wares and merchandise for these baubles; at least\r\n    not to accept them at a higher rate, or in a larger quantity,\r\n    than as they may want them in their trade with the savages.\r\n\r\n    \"In this way your English [Yankee] neighbors shall no longer be\r\n    enabled to draw the best wares and merchandise from our country\r\n    for nothing; the beavers and furs not excepted. This has, indeed,\r\n    long since been insufferable; although it ought chiefly to be\r\n    imputed to the imprudent penuriousness of our own merchants and\r\n    inhabitants, who, it is to be hoped, shall, through the abolition\r\n    of this seawant, become wiser and more prudent.\r\n\r\n    \"27th January, 1662,\r\n\r\n    \"Seawant falls into disrepute; duties to be paid in silver coin.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it came to pass, that while Peter Stuyvesant was busy regulating the\r\ninternal affairs of his domain, the great Yankee league, which had caused\r\nsuch tribulation to William the Testy, continued to increase in extent and\r\npower. The grand Amphictyonic council of the league was held at Boston,\r\nwhere it spun a web which threatened to link within it all the mighty\r\nprincipalities and powers of the east. The object proposed by this\r\nformidable combination was mutual protection and defence against their\r\nsavage neighbors; but all the world knows the real aim was to form a grand\r\ncrusade against the Nieuw Nederlandts and to get possession of the city of\r\nthe Manhattoes--as devout an object of enterprise and ambition to the\r\nYankees as was ever the capture of Jerusalem to ancient Crusaders.\r\n\r\nIn the very year following the inauguration of Governor Stuyvesant, a\r\ngrand deputation departed from the city of Providence (famous for its\r\ndusty streets and beauteous women) in behalf of the plantation of Rhode\r\nIsland, praying to be admitted into the league.\r\n\r\nThe following minute of this deputation appears in the ancient records of\r\nthe council.[40]\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Will. Cottington and Captain Partridg of Rhoode Island presented this\r\ninsewing request to the commissioners in wrighting----\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"Our request and motion is in behalfe of Rhoode Iland, that wee\r\n    the ilanders of Rhoode Iland may be rescauied into combination\r\n    with all the united colonyes of New England in a firme and\r\n    perpetual league of friendship and amity of ofence and defence,\r\n    mutuall advice and succor upon all just occasions for our mutuall\r\n    safety and wellfaire, etc.\r\n\r\n    \"WILL COTTINGTON.\r\n    \"ALICXSANDER PARTRIDG.\"\r\n\r\nThere was certainly something in the very physiognomy of this document\r\nthat might well inspire apprehension. The name of Alexander, however\r\nmis-spelt, has been warlike in every age, and though its fierceness is in\r\nsome measure softened by being coupled with the gentle cognomen of\r\nPartridge, still, like the color of scarlet, it bears an exceeding great\r\nresemblance to the sound of a trumpet. From the style of the letter,\r\nmoreover, and the soldier-like ignorance of orthography displayed by the\r\nnoble Captain Alicxsander Partridg in spelling his own name, we may\r\npicture to ourselves this mighty man of Rhodes, strong in arms, potent in\r\nthe field, and as great a scholar as though he had been educated among\r\nthat learned people of Thrace, who, Aristotle assures us, could not count\r\nbeyond the number four.\r\n\r\nThe result of this great Yankee league was augmented audacity on the part\r\nof the moss-troopers of Connecticut, pushing their encroachments farther\r\nand farther into the territories of their High Mightinesses, so that even\r\nthe inhabitants of New Amsterdam began to draw short breath, and to find\r\nthemselves exceedingly cramped for elbow-room.\r\n\r\nPeter Stuyvesant was not a man to submit quietly to such intrusions; his\r\nfirst impulse was to march at once to the frontier, and kick these\r\nsquatting Yankees out of the country; but, bethinking himself in time that\r\nhe was now a governor and legislator, the policy of the statesman for once\r\ncooled the fire of the old soldier, and he determined to try his hand at\r\nnegotiation. A correspondence accordingly ensued between him and the great\r\ncouncil of the league, and it was agreed that commissioners from either\r\nside should meet at Hartford, to settle boundaries, adjust grievances,\r\nand establish a \"perpetual and happy peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe commissioners on the part of the Manhattoes were chosen, according to\r\nimmemorial usage of that venerable metropolis, from among the \"wisest and\r\nweightiest\" men of the community; that is to say, men with the oldest\r\nheads and heaviest pockets. Among these sages the veteran navigator, Hans\r\nReinier Oothout, who had made such extensive discoveries during the time\r\nof Oloffe the Dreamer, was looked up to as an oracle in all matters of the\r\nkind; and he was ready to produce the very spy-glass with which he first\r\nspied the mouth of the Connecticut river from his masthead, and all the\r\nworld knows that the discovery of the mouth of the river gives prior right\r\nto all the lands drained by its waters.\r\n\r\nIt was with feelings of pride and exultation that the good people of the\r\nManhattoes saw two of the richest and most ponderous burghers departing on\r\nthis embassy; men whose word on 'Change was oracular, and in whose\r\npresence no poor man ventured to appear without taking off his hat: when\r\nit was seen, too, that the veteran Reinier Oothout accompanied them with\r\nhis spy-glass under his arm, all the old men and old women predicted that\r\nmen of such weight, with such evidence, would leave the Yankees no\r\nalternative but to pack up their tin kettles and wooden wares, put wife\r\nand children in a cart, and abandon all the lands of their High\r\nMightinesses on which they had squatted.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the commissioners sent to Hartford by the league seemed in no\r\nwise calculated to compete with men of such capacity. They were two lean\r\nYankee lawyers, litigious-looking varlets, and evidently men of no\r\nsubstance, since they had no rotundity in the belt, and there was no\r\njingling of money in their pockets; it is true they had longer heads than\r\nthe Dutchmen; but if the heads of the latter were flat at top, they were\r\nbroad at bottom, and what was wanting in height of forehead was made up\r\nby a double chin.\r\n\r\nThe negotiation turned as usual upon the good old corner-stone of original\r\ndiscovery; according to the principle that he who first sees a new country\r\nhas an unquestionable right to it. This being admitted, the veteran\r\nOothout, at a concerted signal, stepped forth in the assembly with the\r\nidentical tarpaulin spy-glass in his hand with which he had discovered the\r\nmouth of the Connecticut, while the worthy Dutch commissioners lolled back\r\nin their chairs, secretly chuckling at the idea of having for once got the\r\nweather-gauge of the Yankees, but what was their dismay when the latter\r\nproduced a Nantucket whaler with a spy-glass, twice as long, with which he\r\ndiscovered the whole coast, quite down to the Manhattoes: and so crooked\r\nthat he had spied with it up the whole course of the Connecticut river.\r\nThis principle pushed home, therefore, the Yankees had a right to the\r\nwhole country bordering on the Sound; nay, the city of New Amsterdam was a\r\nmere Dutch squatting-place on their territories.\r\n\r\nI forbear to dwell upon the confusion of the worthy Dutch commissioners at\r\nfinding their main pillar of proof thus knocked from under them; neither\r\nwill I pretend to describe the consternation of the wise men at the\r\nManhattoes when they learnt how their commissioner, had been out-trumped\r\nby the Yankees, and how the latter pretended to claim to the very gates of\r\nNew Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nLong was the negotiation protracted, and long was the public mind kept in\r\na state of anxiety. There are two modes of settling boundary questions,\r\nwhen the claims of the opposite parties are irreconcilable. One is by an\r\nappeal to arms, in which case the weakest party is apt to lose its right,\r\nand get a broken head into the bargain; the other mode is by compromise,\r\nor mutual concession--that is to say, one party cedes half of its claims,\r\nand the other party half of its rights; he who grasps most gets most, and\r\nthe whole is pronounced an equitable division, \"perfectly honorable to\r\nboth parties.\"\r\n\r\nThe latter mode was adopted in the present instance. The Yankees gave up\r\nclaims to vast tracts of the Nieuw Nederlandts which they had never seen,\r\nand all right to the island of Manna-hata and the city of New Amsterdam,\r\nto which they had no right at all; while the Dutch, in return, agreed that\r\nthe Yankees should retain possession of the frontier places where they had\r\nsquatted, and of both sides of the Connecticut river.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of this treaty arrived at New Amsterdam, the whole city was\r\nin an uproar of exultation. The old women rejoiced that there was to be no\r\nwar, the old men that their cabbage-gardens were safe from invasion; while\r\nthe political sages pronounced the treaty a great triumph over the\r\nYankees, considering how much they had claimed, and how little they had\r\nbeen \"fobbed off with.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now my worthy reader is, doubtless, like the great and good Peter,\r\ncongratulating himself with the idea that his feelings will no longer be\r\nharassed by afflicting details of stolen horses, broken heads, impounded\r\nhogs, and all the other catalogue of heart-rending cruelties that\r\ndisgraced these border wars. But if he should indulge in such\r\nexpectations, it is a proof that he is but little versed in the\r\nparadoxical ways of cabinets; to convince him of which I solicit his\r\nserious attention to my next chapter, wherein I will show that Peter\r\nStuyvesant has already committed a great error in politics, and, by\r\neffecting a peace, has materially hazarded the tranquillity of the\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [40] Haz. Coll. Stat. Pap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the opinion of that poetical philosopher, Lucretius, that war was\r\nthe original state of man, whom he described as being, primitively, a\r\nsavage beast of prey, engaged in a constant state of hostility with his\r\nown species, and that this ferocious spirit was tamed and ameliorated by\r\nsociety. The same opinion has been advocated by Hobbes;[41] nor have there\r\nbeen wanting many other philosophers to admit and defend it.\r\n\r\nFor my part, though prodigiously fond of these valuable speculations, so\r\ncomplimentary to human nature, yet, in this instance, I am inclined to\r\ntake the proposition by halves, believing with Horace,[42] that though war\r\nmay have been originally the favorite amusement and industrious employment\r\nof our progenitors, yet, like many other excellent habits, so far from\r\nbeing ameliorated, it has been cultivated and confirmed by refinement and\r\ncivilization, and increases in exact proportion as we approach towards\r\nthat state of perfection which is the _ne plus ultra_ of modern\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nThe first conflict between man and man was the mere exertion of physical\r\nforce, unaided by auxiliary weapons--his arm was his buckler, his fist was\r\nhis mace, and a broken head the catastrophe of his encounters. The battle\r\nof unassisted strength was succeeded by the more rugged one of stones and\r\nclubs, and war assumed a sanguinary aspect. As man advanced in refinement,\r\nas his faculties expanded, and as his sensibilities became more\r\nexquisite, he grew rapidly more ingenious and experienced in the art of\r\nmurdering his fellow beings. He invented a thousand devices to defend and\r\nto assault--the helmet, the cuirass, and the buckler, the sword, the dart,\r\nand the javelin, prepared him to elude the wound as well as to launch the\r\nblow. Still urging on, in the career of philanthropic invention, he\r\nenlarges and heightens his powers of defense and injury. The aries, the\r\nscorpio, the balista, and the catapulta, give a horror and sublimity to\r\nwar, and magnify its glory, by increasing its desolation. Still\r\ninsatiable, though armed with machinery that seemed to reach the limits of\r\ndestructive invention, and to yield a power of injury commensurate even\r\nwith the desires of revenge--still deeper researches must be made in the\r\ndiabolical arcana. With furious zeal he dives into the bowels of the\r\nearth; he toils midst poisonous minerals, and deadly salts--the sublime\r\ndiscovery of gunpowder blazes upon the world; and finally, the dreadful\r\nart of fighting by proclamation seems to endow the demon of war with\r\nubiquity and omnipotence!\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, is grand!--this, indeed, marks the powers of mind, and\r\nbespeaks that divine endowment of reason, which distinguishes us from the\r\nanimals, our inferiors. The unenlightened brutes content themselves with\r\nthe native force which Providence has assigned them. The angry bull butts\r\nwith his horns, as did his progenitors before him; the lion, the leopard,\r\nand the tiger, seek only with their talons and their fangs to gratify\r\ntheir sanguinary fury; and even the subtle serpent darts the same venom,\r\nand uses the same wiles, as did his sire before the flood. Man alone,\r\nblessed with the inventive mind, goes on from discovery to discovery,\r\nenlarges and multiplies his powers of destruction; arrogates the\r\ntremendous weapons of Deity itself, and tasks creation to assist him in\r\nmurdering his brother worm!\r\n\r\nIn proportion as the art of war has increased in improvement has the art\r\nof preserving peace advanced in equal ratio; and as we have discovered, in\r\nthis age of wonders and inventions, that proclamation is the most\r\nformidable engine of war, so have we discovered the no less ingenious mode\r\nof maintaining peace by perpetual negotiations.\r\n\r\nA treaty, or, to speak more correctly, a negotiation, therefore, according\r\nto the acceptation of experienced statesmen learned in these matters, is\r\nno longer an attempt to accommodate differences, to ascertain rights, and\r\nto establish an equitable exchange of kind offices; but a contest of skill\r\nbetween two powers which shall overreach and take in the other it is a\r\ncunning endeavor to obtain by peaceful manoeuvre and the chicanery of\r\ncabinets those advantages which a nation would otherwise have wrested by\r\nforce of arms; in the same manner as a conscientious highwayman reforms\r\nand becomes a quiet and praiseworthy citizen, contenting himself with\r\ncheating his neighbor out of that property he would formerly have seized\r\nwith open violence.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the only time when two nations can be said to be in a state of\r\nperfect amity is when a negotiation is open and a treaty pending. Then,\r\nwhen there are no stipulations entered into, no bonds to restrain the\r\nwill, no specific limits to awaken the captious jealousy of right\r\nimplanted in our nature; when each party has some advantage to hope and\r\nexpect from the other; then it is that the two nations are wonderfully\r\ngracious and friendly, their ministers professing the highest mutual\r\nregard, exchanging _billets-doux_, making fine speeches, and indulging in\r\nall those little diplomatic flirtations, coquetries, and fondlings, that\r\ndo so marvelously tickle the good humor of the respective nations. Thus it\r\nmay paradoxically be said, that there is never so good an understanding\r\nbetween two nations as when there is a little misunderstanding--and that\r\nso long as they are on terms at all they are on the best terms in the\r\nworld!\r\n\r\nI do not by any means pretend to claim the merit of having made the above\r\ndiscovery. It has, in fact, long been secretly acted upon by certain\r\nenlightened cabinets, and is, together with divers other notable theories,\r\nprivately copied out of the commonplace book of an illustrious gentleman\r\nwho has been member of congress, and enjoyed the unlimited confidence of\r\nheads of departments. To this principle may be ascribed the wonderful\r\ningenuity shown of late years in protracting and interrupting\r\nnegotiations. Hence the cunning measure of appointing as ambassador some\r\npolitical pettifogger skilled in delays, sophisms, and misapprehensions,\r\nand dexterous in the art of baffling argument; or some blundering\r\nstatesman, whose errors and misconstructions may be a plea for refusing to\r\nratify his engagements. And hence, too, that most notable expedient, so\r\npopular with our government, of sending out a brace of ambassadors,\r\nbetween whom, having each an individual will to consult, character to\r\nestablish, and interest to promote, you may as well look for unanimity and\r\nconcord as between two lovers with one mistress, two dogs with one bone,\r\nor two naked rogues with one pair of breeches. This disagreement,\r\ntherefore, is continually breeding delays and impediments, in consequence\r\nof which the negotiation goes on swimmingly, inasmuch as there is no\r\nprospect of its ever coming to a close. Nothing is lost by these delays\r\nand obstacles but time; and in a negotiation, according to the theory I\r\nhave exposed, all time lost is in reality so much time gained; with what\r\ndelightful paradoxes does modern political economy abound!\r\n\r\nNow all that I have here advanced, is so notoriously true, that I almost\r\nblush to take up the time of my readers, with treating of matters which\r\nmust many a time have stared them in the face. But the proposition to\r\nwhich I would most earnestly call their attention is this, that though a\r\nnegotiation be the most harmonizing of all national transactions, yet a\r\ntreaty of peace is a great political evil, and one of the most fruitful\r\nsources of war.\r\n\r\nI have rarely seen an instance of any special contract between individuals\r\nthat did not produce jealousies, bickerings and often downright ruptures\r\nbetween them; nor did I ever know of a treaty between two nations that did\r\nnot occasion continual misunderstandings. How many worthy country\r\nneighbors have I known, who, after living in peace and good-fellowship for\r\nyears, have been thrown into a state of distrust, caviling, and animosity,\r\nby some ill-starred agreement about fences, runs of water, and stray\r\ncattle! and how many well-meaning nations, who would otherwise have\r\nremained in the most amicable disposition towards each other, have been\r\nbrought to swords' points about the infringement or misconstruction of\r\nsome treaty, which in an evil hour they had concluded, by way of making\r\ntheir amity more sure!\r\n\r\nTreaties at best are but complied with so long as interest requires their\r\nfulfilment; consequently they are virtually binding on the weaker party\r\nonly, or, in plain truth, they are not binding at all. No nation will\r\nwantonly go to war with another if it has nothing to gain thereby, and\r\ntherefore needs no treaty to restrain it from violence; and if it have\r\nanything to gain, I much question, from what I have witnessed of the\r\nrighteous conduct of nations, whether any treaty could be made so strong\r\nthat it could not thrust the sword through; nay, I would hold ten to one\r\nthe treaty itself would be the very source to which resort would be had to\r\nfind a pretext for hostilities.\r\n\r\nThus, therefore, I conclude--that though it is the best of all policies\r\nfor a nation to keep up a constant negotiation with its neighbors, yet it\r\nis the summit of folly for it ever to be beguiled into a treaty; for then\r\ncomes on non-fulfillment and infraction, then remonstrance, then\r\naltercation, then retaliation, then recrimination, and finally open war.\r\nIn a word, negotiation is like courtship, a time of sweet words, gallant\r\nspeeches, soft looks, and endearing caresses--but the marriage ceremony is\r\nthe signal for hostilities.\r\n\r\nIf my painstaking reader be not somewhat perplexed by the ratiocination of\r\nthe foregoing passage, he will perceive at a glance that the great Peter,\r\nin concluding a treaty with his eastern neighbors, was guilty of\r\nlamentable error in policy. In fact, to this unlucky agreement may be\r\ntraced a world of bickerings and heart-burnings between the parties, about\r\nfancied or pretended infringements of treaty stipulations; in all which\r\nthe Yankees were prone to indemnify themselves by a \"dig into the sides\"\r\nof the New Netherlands. But, in sooth, these border feuds, albeit they\r\ngave great annoyance to the good burghers of Mannahata, were so pitiful in\r\ntheir nature, that a grave historian like myself, who grudges the time\r\nspent in anything less than the revolutions of states and fall of empires,\r\nwould deem them unworthy of being inscribed on his page. The reader is,\r\ntherefore, to take it for granted--though I scorn to waste in the detail\r\nthat time which my furrowed brow and trembling hand inform me is\r\ninvaluable--that all the while the great Peter was occupied in those\r\ntremendous and bloody contests which I shall shortly rehearse, there was a\r\ncontinued series of little, dirty, sniveling scourings, broils, and\r\nmaraudings, kept up on the eastern frontiers by the moss-troopers of\r\nConnecticut. But, like that mirror of chivalry, the sage and valorous Don\r\nQuixote, I leave these petty contests for some future Sancho Panza of an\r\nhistorian, while I reserve my prowess and my pen for achievements of\r\nhigher dignity; for at this moment I hear a direful and portentous note\r\nissuing from the bosom of the great council of the league, and resounding\r\nthroughout the regions of the east, menacing the fame and fortunes of\r\nPeter Stuyvesant; I call, therefore, upon the reader to leave behind him\r\nall the paltry brawls of the Connecticut borders, and to press forward\r\nwith me to the relief of our favorite hero, who, I foresee, will be\r\nwofully beset by the implacable Yankees in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [41] Hobbes, Leviathan, part i., ch. 13.\r\n\r\n   [42]\r\n        \"Cum prorepserunt primis animalia terris,\r\n        Mutum et turpe pecus, glandem atque cubilia propter,\r\n        Unguibus et pugnis, dein fustibus, atque its porro\r\n        Pugnabaut armis, quæ post fabricaverat usus.\"\r\n                    --Hor. _Sat._ lib. i. s. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the reader may be aware of the peril at this moment menacing Peter\r\nStuyvesant and his capital, I must remind him of the old charge advanced\r\nin the council of the league in the time of William the Testy, that the\r\nNederlanders were carrying on a trade \"damnable and injurious to the\r\ncolonists,\" in furnishing the savages with \"guns, powther, and shott.\"\r\nThis, as I then suggested, was a crafty device of the Yankee confederacy\r\nto have a snug cause of war _in petto_, in case any favorable opportunity\r\nshould present of attempting the conquest of the New Nederlands, the great\r\nobject of Yankee ambition.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we now find, when every other ground of complaint had\r\napparently been removed by treaty, this nefarious charge revived with\r\ntenfold virulence, and hurled like a thunderbolt at the very head of Peter\r\nStuyvesant; happily his head, like that of the great bull of the Wabash,\r\nwas proof against such missiles.\r\n\r\nTo be explicit, we are told that, in the years 1651, the great confederacy\r\nof the east accused the immaculate Peter, the soul of honor and heart of\r\nsteel, of secretly endeavoring, by gifts and promises, to instigate the\r\nNarroheganset, Mohaque, and Pequot Indians to surprise and massacre the\r\nYankee settlements. \"For,\" as the grand council observed, \"the Indians\r\nround about for divers hundred miles cercute seeme to have drunk deepe of\r\nan intoxicating cupp, att or from the Manhattoes against the English,\r\nwhoe have sought their good, both in bodily and spirituall respects.\"\r\n\r\nThis charge they pretended to support by the evidence of divers Indians,\r\nwho were probably moved by that spirit of truth which is said to reside in\r\nthe bottle, and who swore to the fact as sturdily as though they had been\r\nso many Christian troopers.\r\n\r\nThough descended from a family which suffered much injury from the losel\r\nYankees of those times, my great-grandfather having had a yoke of oxen and\r\nhis best pacer stolen, and having received a pair of black eyes and a\r\nbloody nose in one of these border wars; and my grandfather, when a very\r\nlittle boy tending pigs, having been kidnaped and severely flogged by a\r\nlong-sided Connecticut schoolmaster--yet I should have passed over all\r\nthese wrongs with forgiveness and oblivion--I could even have suffered\r\nthem to have broken Everett Ducking's head; to have kicked the doughty\r\nJacobus Van Curlet and his ragged regiment out of doors; to have carried\r\nevery hog into captivity, and depopulated every hen-roost on the face of\r\nthe earth with perfect impunity--but this wanton attack upon one of the\r\nmost gallant and irreproachable heroes of modern times is too much even\r\nfor me to digest, and has overset, with a single puff, the patience of the\r\nhistorian and the forbearance of the Dutchman.\r\n\r\nOh, reader, it was false! I swear to thee, it was false! If thou hast any\r\nrespect to my word, if the undeviating character for veracity, which I\r\nhave endeavored to maintain throughout this work, has its due weight with\r\nthee, thou wilt not give thy faith to this tale of slander; for I pledge\r\nmy honor and my immortal fame to thee, that the gallant Peter Stuyvesant\r\nwas not only innocent of this foul conspiracy, but would have suffered his\r\nright arm, or even his wooden leg, to consume with slow and everlasting\r\nflames, rather than attempt to destroy his enemies in any other way than\r\nopen, generous warfare. Beshrew those caitiff scouts that conspired to\r\nsully his honest name by such an imputation!\r\n\r\nPeter Stuyvesant, though haply he may never have heard of a knight errant,\r\nhad as true a heart of chivalry as ever beat at the round table of King\r\nArthur. In the honest bosom of this heroic Dutchman dwelt the seven noble\r\nvirtues of knighthood, flourishing among his hardy qualities like wild\r\nflowers among rocks. He was, in truth, a hero of chivalry struck off by\r\nNature at a single heat, and though little care may have been taken to\r\nrefine her workmanship, he stood forth a miracle of her skill. In all his\r\ndealings he was headstrong perhaps, but open and above board; if there was\r\nanything in the whole world he most loathed and despised, it was cunning\r\nand secret wile; \"straight forward\" was his motto, and he at any time\r\nrather run his hard head against a stone wall than attempt to get round\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSuch was Peter Stuyvesant, and if my admiration of him has on this\r\noccasion transported my style beyond the sober gravity which becomes the\r\nphilosophic recorder of historic events, I must plead as an apology that\r\nthough a little grey-headed Dutchman, arrived almost at the down-hill of\r\nlife, I still retain a lingering spark of that fire which kindles in the\r\neye of youth when contemplating the virtues of ancient worthies. Blessed\r\nthrice, and nine times blessed be the good St. Nicholas, if I have indeed\r\nescaped that apathy which chills the sympathies of age and paralyses every\r\nglow of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe first measure of Peter Stuyvesant, on hearing of this slanderous\r\ncharge, would have been worthy of a man who had studied for years in the\r\nchivalrous library of Don Quixote. Drawing his sword and laying it across\r\nthe table to put him in proper tune, he took pen in hand and indited a\r\nproud and lofty letter to the council of the league, reproaching them with\r\ngiving ear to the slanders of heathen savages against a Christian, a\r\nsoldier, and a cavalier; declaring that whoever charged him with the plot\r\nin question lied in his throat; to prove which he offered to meet the\r\npresident of the council, or any of his compeers; or their champion,\r\nCaptain Alexander Partridge, that mighty man of Rhodes, in single combat;\r\nwherein he trusted to vindicate his honor by the prowess of his arm.\r\n\r\nThis missive was intrusted to his trumpeter and squire, Anthony Van\r\nCorlear, that man of emergencies, with orders to travel night and day,\r\nsparing neither whip nor spur, seeing that he carried the vindication of\r\nhis patron's fame in his saddle-bags. The loyal Anthony accomplished his\r\nmission with great speed and considerable loss of leather. He delivered\r\nhis missive with becoming ceremony, accompanying it with a flourish of\r\ndefiance on his trumpet to the whole council, ending with a significant\r\nand nasal twang full in the face of Captain Partridge, who nearly jumped\r\nout of his skin in an ecstasy of astonishment.\r\n\r\nThe grand council was composed of men too cool and practical to be put\r\nreadily in a heat, or to indulge in knight-errantry, and above all to run\r\na tilt with such a fiery hero as Peter the Headstrong. They knew the\r\nadvantage, however, to have always a snug, justifiable cause of war in\r\nreserve with a neighbor who had territories worth invading; so they\r\ndevised a reply to Peter Stuyvesant, calculated to keep up the \"raw\" which\r\nthey had established.\r\n\r\nOn receiving this answer, Anthony Van Corlear remounted the Flanders mare\r\nwhich he always rode, and trotted merrily back to the Manhattoes, solacing\r\nhimself by the way according to his wont; twanging his trumpet like a very\r\ndevil, so that the sweet valleys and banks of the Connecticut, resounded\r\nwith the warlike melody; bringing all the folks to the windows as he\r\npassed through Hartford and Pyquag and Middletown, and all the other\r\nborder towns; ogling and winking at the women, and making aerial\r\nwindmills from the end of his nose at their husbands; and stopping\r\noccasionally in the villages to eat pumpkin-pies, dance at country\r\nfrolics, and bundle with the Yankee lasses, whom he rejoiced exceedingly\r\nwith his soul-stirring instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reply of the grand council to Peter Stuyvesant was couched in the\r\ncoolest and most diplomatic language. They assured him that \"his confident\r\ndenials of the barbarous plot alleged against him would weigh little\r\nagainst the testimony of divers sober and respectable Indians;\" that \"his\r\nguilt was proved to their perfect satisfaction,\" so that they must still\r\nrequire and seek due satisfaction and security; ending with--\"so we rest,\r\nsir--Yours in ways of righteousness.\"\r\n\r\nI forbear to say how the lion-hearted Peter roared and ramped at finding\r\nhimself more and more entangled in the meshes thus artfully drawn round\r\nhim by the knowing Yankees. Impatient, however, of suffering so gross an\r\naspersion to rest upon his honest name, he sent a second messenger to the\r\ncouncil, reiterating his denial of the treachery imputed to him, and\r\noffering to submit his conduct to the scrutiny of a court of honor. His\r\noffer was readily accepted; and now he looked forward with confidence to\r\nan august tribunal to be assembled at the Manhattoes, formed of\r\nhigh-minded cavaliers, peradventure governors and commanders of the\r\nconfederate plantations, where the matter might be investigated by his\r\npeers in a manner befitting his rank and dignity.\r\n\r\nWhile he was awaiting the arrival of such high functionaries, behold, one\r\nsunshiny afternoon there rode into the great gate of the Manhattoes two\r\nlean, hungry-looking Yankees, mounted on Narraganset pacers, with\r\nsaddle-bags under their bottoms, and green satchels under their arms, who\r\nlooked marvelously like two pettifogging attorneys beating the hoof from\r\none county court to another in quest of lawsuits; and, in sooth, though\r\nthey may have passed under different names at the time, I have reason to\r\nsuspect they were the identical varlets who had negotiated the worthy\r\nDutch commissioners out of the Connecticut river.\r\n\r\nIt was a rule with these indefatigable missionaries never to let the grass\r\ngrow under their feet. Scarce had they, therefore, alighted at the inn and\r\ndeposited their saddle-bags, than they made their way to the residence of\r\nthe governor. They found him, according to custom, smoking his afternoon\r\npipe on the \"stoop,\" or bench at the porch of his house, and announced\r\nthemselves at once as commissioners sent by the grand council of the east\r\nto investigate the truth of certain charges advanced against him.\r\n\r\nThe good Peter took his pipe from his mouth, and gazed at them for a\r\nmoment in mute astonishment. By way of expediting business, they were\r\nproceeding on the spot to put some preliminary questions; asking him,\r\nperadventure, whether he pleaded guilty or not guilty; considering him\r\nsomething in the light of a culprit at the bar; when they were brought to\r\na pause by seeing him lay down his pipe and begin to fumble with his\r\nwalking-staff. For a moment those present would not have given half a\r\ncrown for both the crowns of the commissioners; but Peter Stuyvesant\r\nrepressed his mighty wrath and stayed his hand; he scanned the varlets\r\nfrom head to foot, satchels and all, with a look of ineffable scorn; then\r\nstrode into the house, slammed the door after him, and commanded that they\r\nshould never again be admitted to his presence.\r\n\r\nThe knowing commissioners winked to each other and made a certificate on\r\nthe spot that the governor had refused to answer their interrogatories or\r\nto submit to their examination. They then proceeded to rummage about the\r\ncity for two or three days, in quest of what they called evidence,\r\nperplexing Indians and old women with their cross-questioning until they\r\nhad stuffed their satchels and saddle-bags with all kinds of apocryphal\r\ntales, rumors, and calumnies; with these they mounted their Narraganset\r\npacers, and travelled back to the grand council. Neither did the\r\nproud-hearted Peter trouble himself to hinder their researches nor impede\r\ntheir departure; he was too mindful of their sacred character as envoys;\r\nbut I warrant me had they played the same tricks with William the Testy,\r\nhe would have had them tucked up by the waistband, and treated to an\r\naerial gambol on his patent gallows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grand council of the east held a solemn meeting on the return of their\r\nenvoys. As no advocate appeared in behalf of Peter Stuyvesant, everything\r\nwent against him. His haughty refusal to submit to the questioning of the\r\ncommissioners was construed into a consciousness of guilt. The contents of\r\nthe satchels and saddle-bags were poured forth before the council, and\r\nappeared a mountain of evidence. A pale bilious orator took the floor, and\r\ndeclaimed for hours and in belligerent terms. He was one of those furious\r\nzealots who blow the bellows of faction until the whole furnace of\r\npolitics is red-hot with sparks and cinders. What was it to him if he\r\nshould set the house on fire, so that he might boil his pot by the blaze?\r\nHe was from the borders of Connecticut; his constituents lived by\r\nmarauding their Dutch neighbors, and were the greatest poachers in\r\nChristendom, excepting the Scotch border nobles. His eloquence had its\r\neffect, and it was determined to set on foot an expedition against the\r\nNieuw Nederlandts.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary, however, to prepare the public mind for this measure.\r\nAccordingly the arguments of the orator were echoed from the pulpit for\r\nseveral succeeding Sundays, and a crusade was preached up against Peter\r\nStuyvesant and his devoted city.\r\n\r\nThis is the first we hear of the \"drum ecclesiastic\" beating up for\r\nrecruits in worldly warfare in our country. It has since been called into\r\nfrequent use. A cunning politician often lurks under the clerical robe;\r\nthings spiritual and things temporal are strangely jumbled together, like\r\ndrugs on an apothecary's shelf; and instead of a peaceful sermon, the\r\nsimple seeker after righteousness has often a political pamphlet thrust\r\ndown his throat, labeled with a pious text from Scripture.\r\n\r\nAnd now nothing was talked of but an expedition against the Manhattoes. It\r\npleased the populace, who had a vehement prejudice against the Dutch,\r\nconsidering them a vastly inferior race, who had sought the new world for\r\nthe lucre of gain, not the liberty of conscience: who were mere heretics\r\nand infidels, inasmuch as the refused to believe in witches and\r\nsea-serpents, and had, faith in the virtues of horse-shoes nailed to the\r\ndoor; ate pork without molasses; held pumpkins in contempt, and were in\r\nperpetual breach of the eleventh commandment of all true Yankees, \"Thou\r\nshalt have codfish dinners on Saturdays.\"\r\n\r\nNo sooner did Peter Stuyvesant get wind of the storm that was brewing in\r\nthe east, than he set to work to prepare for it. He was not one of those\r\neconomical rulers who postpone the expense of fortifying until the enemy\r\nis at the door. There is nothing, he would say, that keeps off enemies and\r\ncrows more than the smell of gunpowder. He proceeded, therefore, with all\r\ndiligence, to put the province and its metropolis in a posture of defence.\r\n\r\nAmong the remnants which remained from the days of William the Testy were\r\nthe militia laws, by which the inhabitants were obliged to turn out twice\r\na year, with such military equipments as it pleased God; and were put\r\nunder the command of tailors and man-milliners, who, though on ordinary\r\noccasions they might have been the meekest, most pippin-hearted little men\r\nin the world, were very devils at parades, when they had cocked hats on\r\ntheir heads and swords by their sides. Under the instructions of these\r\nperiodical warriors, the peaceful burghers of the Manhattoes were schooled\r\nin iron war, and became so hardy in the process of time, that they could\r\nmarch through sun and rain, from one end of the town to the other, without\r\nflinching; and so intrepid and adroit, that they could face to the right,\r\nwheel to the left, and fare without winking or blinking.\r\n\r\nPeter Stuyvesant, like all old soldiers who have seen service and smelt\r\ngunpowder, had no great respect for militia troops: however, he determined\r\nto give them a trial, and accordingly called for a general muster,\r\ninspection, and review. But, O Mars and Bellona! what a turning-out was\r\nhere! Here came old Roelant Cuckaburt, with a short blunderbuss on his\r\nshoulder and a long horseman's sword trailing by his side; and Barent\r\nDirkson, with something that looked like a copper kettle, turned upside\r\ndown on his head, and a couple of old horse pistols in his belt; and Dirk\r\nVolkertson, with a long duck fowling-piece without any ramrod, and a host\r\nmore, armed higgledy-piggledy with swords, hatchets, snickersnees,\r\ncrowbars, broomsticks, and what not; the officers distinguished from the\r\nrest by having their slouched hats cocked up with pins and surmounted with\r\ncocktail feathers.\r\n\r\nThe sturdy Peter eyed this nondescript host with some such rueful aspect\r\nas a man would eye the devil, and determined to give his feather-bed\r\nsoldiers a seasoning. He accordingly put them through their manual\r\nexercise over and over again, trudged them backwards and forwards about\r\nthe streets of New Amsterdam, until their short legs ached and their fat\r\nsides sweated again, and finally encamped them in the evening on the\r\nsummit of a hill without the city, to give them a taste of camp life,\r\nintending the next day to renew the toils and perils of the field. But so\r\nit came to pass that in the night there fell a great and heavy rain, and\r\nmelted away the army, so that in the morning when Gaffer Phoebus shed his\r\nfirst beams upon the camp, scarce a warrior remained, excepting Peter\r\nStuyvesant and his trumpeter, Van Corlear.\r\n\r\nThis awful desolation of a whole army would have appalled a commander of\r\nless nerve; but it served to confirm Peter's want of confidence in the\r\nmilitia system, which he thenceforward used to call, in joke--for he\r\nsometimes indulged in a joke--William the Testy's broken reed. He now took\r\ninto his service a goodly number of burly, broad-shouldered,\r\nbroad-bottomed Dutchmen, whom he paid in good silver and gold, and of whom\r\nhe boasted that, whether they could stand fire or not, they were at least\r\nwater-proof.\r\n\r\nHe fortified the city, too, with pickets and palisadoes, extending across\r\nthe island from river to river; and above all cast up mud batteries or\r\nredoubts on the point of the island where it divided the beautiful bosom\r\nof the bay.\r\n\r\nThese latter redoubts, in process of time, came to be pleasantly overrun\r\nby a carpet of grass and clover, and overshadowed by wide-spreading elms\r\nand sycamores, among the branches of which the birds would build their\r\nnests and rejoice the ear with their melodious notes. Under these trees,\r\ntoo, the old burghers would smoke their afternoon pipe, contemplating the\r\ngolden sun as he sank in the west, an emblem of the tranquil end toward\r\nwhich they were declining. Here, too, would the young men and maidens of\r\nthe town take their evening stroll, watching the silver moon beams as they\r\ntrembled along the calm bosom of the bay, or lit up the sail of some\r\ngliding bark, and peradventure interchanging the soft vows of honest\r\naffection; for to evening strolls in this favored spot were traced most of\r\nthe marriages in New Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nSuch was the origin of that renowned promenade, The Battery, which, though\r\nostensibly devoted to the stern purposes of war, has ever been consecrated\r\nto the sweet delights of peace. The scene of many a gambol in happy\r\nchildhood--of many a tender assignation in riper years--of many a soothing\r\nwalk in declining age--the healthful resort of the feeble invalid--the\r\nSunday refreshment of the dusty tradesman--in fine, the ornament and\r\ndelight of New York, and the pride of the lovely island of Manna-hata.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus provided for the temporary security of New Amsterdam, and\r\nguarded it against any sudden surprise, the gallant Peter took a hearty\r\npinch of snuff, and snapping his fingers, set the great council of\r\nAmphictyons and their champion, the redoubtable Alicxsander Partridg, at\r\ndefiance. In the meantime the moss-troopers of Connecticut, the warriors\r\nof New Haven and Hartford, and Pyquag--otherwise called Weathersfield,\r\nfamous for its onions and its witches--and of all the other border towns,\r\nwere in a prodigious turmoil, furbishing up their rusty weapons, shouting\r\naloud for war, and anticipating easy conquests and glorious rummaging of\r\nthe fat little Dutch villages.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these warlike preparations, however, they received the\r\nchilling news that the colony of Massachusetts refused to back them in\r\nthis righteous war. It seems that the gallant conduct of Peter Stuyvesant,\r\nthe generous warmth of his vindication, and the chivalrous spirit of his\r\ndefiance, though lost upon the grand council of the league, had carried\r\nconviction to the general court of Massachusetts, which nobly refused to\r\nbelieve him guilty of the villainous plot laid at his door.[43]\r\n\r\nThe defection of so important a colony paralysed the councils of the\r\nleague. Some such dissension arose among its members as prevailed of yore\r\nin the camp of the brawling warriors of Greece, and in the end the crusade\r\nagainst the Manhattoes was abandoned.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the moss-troopers of Connecticut were sorely disappointed;\r\nwell for them that their belligerent cravings were not gratified, for, by\r\nmy faith, whatever might have been the ultimate result of a conflict with\r\nall the powers of the east, in the interim the stomachful heroes of Pyquag\r\nwould have been choked with their own onions, and all the border towns of\r\nConnecticut would have had such a scouring from the lion-hearted Peter and\r\nhis robustious myrmidons, that I warrant me they would not have had the\r\nstomach to squat on the land, or invade the hen-roost of a Nederlander for\r\na century to come.\r\n\r\nBut it was not merely the refusal of Massachusetts to join in their unholy\r\ncrusade that confounded the councils of the league; for about this time\r\nbroke out in the New England provinces the awful plague of witchcraft,\r\nwhich spread like pestilence through the land. Such a howling abomination\r\ncould not be suffered to remain long unnoticed; it soon excited the fiery\r\nindignation of those guardians of the commonwealth, who whilom had evinced\r\nsuch active benevolence in the conversion of Quakers and Anabaptists. The\r\ngrand council of the league publicly set their faces against the crime,\r\nand bloody laws were enacted against all \"solem conversing or compacting\r\nwith the devil by the way of conjuracion or the like.\"[44] Strict search,\r\ntoo, was made after witches, who were easily detected by devil's pinches;\r\nby being able to weep but three tears, and those out of the left eye; and\r\nby having a most suspicious predilection for black cats and broomsticks!\r\nWhat is particularly worthy of admiration is, that this terrible art,\r\nwhich has baffled the studies and researches of philosophers, astrologers,\r\ntheurgists, and other sages, was chiefly confined to the most ignorant,\r\ndecrepid, and ugly old women in the community, with scarce more brains\r\nthan the broomsticks they rode upon.\r\n\r\nWhen once an alarm is sounded, the public, who dearly love to be in a\r\npanic, are always ready to keep it up. Raise but the cry of yellow fever,\r\nand immediately every headache, indigestion, and overflowing of the bile\r\nis pronounced the terrible epidemic; cry out mad dog, and every unlucky\r\ncur in the street is in jeopardy; so in the present instance, whoever was\r\ntroubled with colic or lumbago was sure to be bewitched; and woe to any\r\nunlucky old woman living in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIt is incredible the number of offences that were detected, \"for every one\r\nof which,\" says the Reverend Cotton Mather, in that excellent work, the\r\nHistory of New England, \"we have such a sufficient evidence, that no\r\nreasonable man in this whole country ever did question them; and it will\r\nbe unreasonable to do it in any other.\"[45]\r\n\r\nIndeed, that authentic and judicious historian, John Josselyn, gent.,\r\nfurnishes us with unquestionable facts on this subject. \"There are none,\"\r\nobserves he, \"that beg in this country, but there be witches too\r\nmany--bottle-bellied witches and others, that produce many strange\r\napparitions, if you will believe report, of a shallop at sea manned with\r\nwomen--and of a ship and great red horse standing by the mainmast; the\r\nship being in a small cove to the eastward vanished of a sudden,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe number of delinquents, however, and their magical devices, were not\r\nmore remarkable than their diabolical obstinacy. Though exhorted in the\r\nmost solemn, persuasive and affectionate manner, to confess themselves\r\nguilty, and be burnt for the good of religion, and the entertainment of\r\nthe public, yet did they most pertinaciously persist in asserting their\r\ninnocence. Such incredible obstinacy was in itself deserving of immediate\r\npunishment, and was sufficient proof, if proof were necessary, that they\r\nwere in league with the devil, who is perverseness itself. But their\r\njudges were just and merciful, and were determined to punish none that\r\nwere not convicted on the best of testimony; not that they needed any\r\nevidence to satisfy their own minds, for, like true and experienced\r\njudges, their minds were perfectly made up, and they were thoroughly\r\nsatisfied of the guilt of the prisoners before they proceeded to try them;\r\nbut still something was necessary to convince the community at large, to\r\nquiet those praying quidnuncs who should come after them--in short, the\r\nworld must be satisfied. Oh, the world! the world! all the world knows the\r\nworld of trouble the world is eternally occasioning! The worthy judges,\r\ntherefore, were driven to the necessity of sifting, detecting and making\r\nevident as noonday, matters which were at the commencement all clearly\r\nunderstood and firmly decided upon in their own pericraniums; so that it\r\nmay truly be said that the witches were burnt to gratify the populace of\r\nthe day, but were tried for the satisfaction of the whole world that\r\nshould come after them.\r\n\r\nFinding, therefore, that neither exhortation, sound reason, nor friendly\r\nentreaty had any avail on these hardened offenders, they resorted to the\r\nmore urgent arguments of torture; and having thus absolutely wrung the\r\ntruth from their stubborn lips, they condemned them to undergo the\r\nroasting due unto the heinous crimes they had confessed. Some even\r\ncarried their perverseness so far as to expire under the torture,\r\nprotesting their innocence to the last; but these were looked upon as\r\nthoroughly and absolutely possessed by the devil, and the pious bystanders\r\nonly lamented that they had not lived a little longer to have perished in\r\nthe flames.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Ephesus, we are told that the plague was expelled by\r\nstoning a ragged old beggar to death, whom Apollonius pointed out as being\r\nthe evil spirit that caused it, and who actually showed himself to be a\r\ndemon by changing into a shagged dog. In like manner, and by measures\r\nequally sagacious, a salutary check was given to this growing evil. The\r\nwitches were all burnt, banished, or panic-stuck, and in a little while\r\nthere was not an ugly old woman to be found throughout New England; which\r\nis doubtless one reason why all the young women there are so handsome.\r\nThose honest folk who had suffered from their incantations gradually\r\nrecovered, excepting such as had been afflicted with twitches and aches,\r\nwhich, however, assumed the less alarming aspects of rheumatism, ciatics,\r\nand lumbagos; and the good people of New England, abandoning the study of\r\nthe occult sciences, turned their attention to the more profitable hocus\r\npocus of trade, and soon became expert in the legerdemain art of turning a\r\npenny. Still, however, a tinge of the old leaven is discernible, even unto\r\nthis day, in their characters; witches occasionally start up among them in\r\ndifferent disguises, as physicians, civilians and divines. The people at\r\nlarge show a keenness, a cleverness and a profundity of wisdom, that\r\nsavors strongly of witchcraft; and it has been remarked, that whenever any\r\nstones fall from the moon, the greater part of them is sure to tumble into\r\nNew England.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [43] Hazard's State Papers.\r\n\r\n   [44] New Plymouth Record.\r\n\r\n   [45] Mather's Hist. New Eng. b. vi. ch. 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen treating of these tempestuous times, the unknown writer of the\r\nStuyvesant manuscript breaks out into an apostrophe in praise of the good\r\nSt. Nicholas, to whose protecting care he ascribes the dissensions which\r\nbroke out in the council of the league, and the direful witchcraft which\r\nfilled all Yankee land as with Egyptian darkness.\r\n\r\nA portentous gloom, says he, hung lowering over the fair valleys of the\r\neast; the pleasant banks of the Connecticut no longer echoed to the sounds\r\nof rustic gayety; grisly phantoms glided about each wild brook and silent\r\nglen; fearful apparitions were seen in the air; strange voices were heard\r\nin solitary places, and the border towns were so occupied in detecting and\r\npunishing losel witches, that for a time all talk of war was suspended,\r\nand New Amsterdam and its inhabitants seemed to be totally forgotten.\r\n\r\nI must not conceal the fact, that at one time there was some danger of\r\nthis plague of witchcraft extending into the New Netherlands; and certain\r\nwitches, mounted on broomsticks, are said to have been seen whisking in\r\nthe air over some of the Dutch villages near the borders; but the worthy\r\nNederlanders took the precaution to nail horse-shoes to their doors, which\r\nit is well known are effectual barriers against all diabolical vermin of\r\nthe kind. Many of those horse-shoes may be seen at this very day on\r\nancient mansions and barns, remaining from the days of the patriarchs;\r\nnay, the custom is still kept up among some of our legitimate Dutch\r\nyeomanry, who inherit from their forefathers a desire to keep witches and\r\nYankees out of the country.\r\n\r\nAnd now the great Peter, having no immediate hostility to apprehend from\r\nthe east, turned his face, with characteristic vigilance, to his southern\r\nfrontiers. The attentive reader will recollect that certain freebooting\r\nSwedes had become very troublesome in this quarter in the latter part of\r\nthe reign of William the Testy, setting at naught the proclamations of\r\nthat veritable potentate, and putting his admiral, the intrepid Jan Jensen\r\nAlpendam, to a perfect nonplus. To check the incursions of these Swedes,\r\nPeter Stuyvesant now ordered a force to that frontier, giving the command\r\nof it to General Jacobus Van Poffenburgh, an officer who had risen to\r\ngreat importance during the reign of Wilhelmus Kieft. He had, if histories\r\nspeak true, been second in command to the doughty Van Curlet, when he and\r\nhis warriors were inhumanly kicked out of Fort Goed Hoop by the Yankees.\r\nIn that memorable affair Van Poffenburgh is said to have received more\r\nkicks, in a certain honorable part, than any of his comrades; in\r\nconsequence of which, on the resignation of Van Curlet, he had been\r\npromoted to his place, being considered a hero who had seen service, and\r\nsuffered in his country's cause.\r\n\r\nIt is tropically observed by honest old Socrates, that heaven infuses into\r\nsome men at their birth a portion of intellectual gold; into others, of\r\nintellectual silver; while others are intellectually furnished with iron\r\nand brass. Of the last class was General Van Poffenburgh, and it would\r\nseem as if Dame Nature, who will sometimes be partial, had given him brass\r\nenough for a dozen ordinary braziers. All this he had contrived to pass\r\noff upon William the Testy for genuine gold; and the little governor would\r\nsit for hours and listen to his gunpowder stories of exploits, which left\r\nthose of Tirante the White, Don Belianis of Greece, or St. George and the\r\nDragon, quite in the background. Having been promoted by William Kieft to\r\nthe command of his whole disposable forces, he gave importance to his\r\nstation by the grandiloquence of his bulletins, always styling himself\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Armies of the New Netherlands; though in sober\r\ntruth these Armies were nothing more than a handful of hen-stealing,\r\nbottle-bruising ragamuffins.\r\n\r\nIn person he was not very tall, but exceedingly round: neither did his\r\nbulk proceed from his being fat, but windy; being blown up by a prodigious\r\nconviction of his own importance, until he resembled one of those bags of\r\nwind given by Æolus, in an incredible fit of generosity to that vagabond\r\nwarrior, Ulysses. His windy endowments had long excited the admiration of\r\nAntony Van Corlear, who is said to have hinted more than once to William\r\nthe Testy, that in making Van Poffenburgh a general, he had spoiled an\r\nadmirable trumpeter.\r\n\r\nAs it is the practice in ancient story to give the reader a description of\r\nthe arms and equipments of every noted warrior, I will bestow a word upon\r\nthe dress of this redoubtable commander. It comported with his character,\r\nbeing so crossed and slashed, and embroidered with lace and tinsel, that\r\nhe seemed to have as much brass without as nature had stored away within.\r\nHe was swathed too in a crimson sash, of the size and texture of a\r\nfishing-net; doubtless to keep his swelling heart from bursting through\r\nhis ribs. His face glowed with furnace heat from between a huge pair of\r\nwell-powdered whiskers; and his valorous soul seemed ready to bounce out\r\nof a pair of large, glassy, blinking eyes, projecting like those of a\r\nlobster.\r\n\r\nI swear to thee, worthy reader, if history and tradition belie not this\r\nwarrior, I would give all the money in my pocket to have seen him\r\naccoutred cap-a-pie--booted to the middle--sashed to the chin--collared to\r\nthe ears--whiskered to the teeth--crowned with an overshadowing cocked\r\nhat, and girded with a leathern belt ten inches broad, from which trailed\r\na falchion, of a length that I dare not mention. Thus equipped, he\r\nstrutted about, as bitter looking a man of war as the far-famed More, of\r\nMore Hall, when he sallied forth to slay the Dragon of Wantley. For what\r\nsays the ballad?\r\n\r\n    \"Had you but seen him in this dress,\r\n      How fierce he looked and how big,\r\n    You would have thought him for to be\r\n      Some Egyptian porcupig.\r\n    He frighted all--cats, dogs, and all,\r\n      Each cow, each horse, and each hog;\r\n    For fear did flee, for they took him to be\r\n      Some strange outlandish hedgehog.\"[46]\r\n\r\nI must confess this general, with all his outward valor and ventosity, was\r\nnot exactly an officer to Peter Stuyvesant's taste, but he stood foremost\r\nin the army list of William the Testy, and it is probable the good Peter,\r\nwho was conscientious in his dealings with all men, and had his military\r\nnotions of precedence, thought it but fair to give him a chance of proving\r\nhis right to his dignities.\r\n\r\nTo this copper captain, therefore, was confided the command of the troops\r\ndestined to protect the southern frontier; and scarce had he departed from\r\nhis station than bulletins began to arrive from him, describing his\r\nundaunted march through savage deserts over insurmountable mountains,\r\nacross impassable rivers, and through impenetrable forests, conquering\r\nvast tracts of uninhabited country, and encountering more perils than did\r\nXenophon in his far-famed retreat with his ten thousand Grecians.\r\n\r\nPeter Stuyvesant read all these grandiloquent dispatches with a dubious\r\nscrewing of the mouth and shaking of the head; but Antony Van Corlear\r\nrepeated these contents in the streets and market-places with an\r\nappropriate flourish upon his trumpet, and the windy victories of the\r\ngeneral resounded through the streets of New Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the southern frontier, Van Poffenburgh proceeded to erect a\r\nfortress, or stronghold, on the South of Delaware river. At first he\r\nbethought him to call it Fort Stuyvesant, in honor of the governor, a\r\nlowly kind of homage prevalent in our country among speculators, military\r\ncommanders, and office-seekers of all kinds, by which our maps come to be\r\nstudded with the names of political patrons and temporary great men; in\r\nthe present instance, Van Poffenburgh carried his homage to the most lowly\r\ndegree, giving his fortress the name of Fort Casimir, in honor, it is\r\nsaid, of a favorite pair of brimstone trunk-breeches of his excellency.\r\n\r\nAs this fort will be found to give rise to important events, it may be\r\nworth while to notice that it was afterwards called Nieuw-Amstel, and was\r\nthe germ of the present flourishing town of Newcastle, or, more properly\r\nspeaking, No Castle, there being nothing of the kind on the premises.\r\n\r\nHis fortress being finished, it would have done any man's heart good to\r\nbehold the swelling dignity with which the general would stride in and out\r\na dozen times a day, surveying it in front and in rear, on this side and\r\non that; how he would strut backwards and forwards, in full regimentals,\r\non the top of the ramparts, like a vain-glorious cock-pigeon, swelling and\r\nvaporing on the top of a dovecote.\r\n\r\nThere is a kind of valorous spleen which, like wind, is apt to grow unruly\r\nin the stomachs of newly-made soldiers, compelling them to box-lobby\r\nbrawls and brokenheaded quarrels, unless there can be found some more\r\nharmless way to give it vent. It is recorded, in the delectable romance of\r\nPierce Forest, that a young knight, being dubbed by King Alexander, did\r\nincontinently gallop into an adjacent forest, and belabor the trees with\r\nsuch might and main, that he not merely eased off the sudden effervescence\r\nof his valor, but convinced the whole court that he was the most potent\r\nand courageous cavalier on the face of the earth. In like manner the\r\ncommander of Fort Casimir, when he found his martial spirit waxing too hot\r\nwithin him, would sally forth into the fields and lay about him most\r\nlustily with his sabre; decapitating cabbages by platoons; hewing down\r\nlofty sunflowers, which he termed gigantic Swedes; and if, perchance, he\r\nespied a colony of big-bellied pumpkins quietly basking in the sun, \"Ah!\r\ncaitiff Yankees!\" would he roar, \"have I caught ye at last?\" So saying,\r\nwith one sweep of his sword, he would cleave the unhappy vegetables from\r\ntheir chins to their waist-bands; by which warlike havoc, his choler being\r\nin some sort allayed, he would return into the fortress with the full\r\nconviction that he was a very miracle of military prowess.\r\n\r\nHe was a disciplinarian, too, of the first order. Woe to any unlucky\r\nsoldier who did not hold up his head and turn out his toes when on parade;\r\nor who did not salute the general in proper style as he passed. Having one\r\nday, in his Bible researches, encountered the history of Absalom and his\r\nmelancholy end, the general bethought him that, in a country abounding\r\nwith forests, his soldiers were in constant risk of a like catastrophe; he\r\ntherefore, in an evil hour, issued orders for cropping the hair of both\r\nofficers and men throughout the garrison.\r\n\r\nNow so it happened, that among his officers was a sturdy veteran named\r\nKeldermeester, who had cherished, through a long life, a mop of hair not a\r\nlittle resembling the shag of a Newfoundland dog, terminating in a queue\r\nlike the handle of a frying-pan, and queued so tightly to his head that\r\nhis eyes and mouth generally stood ajar, and his eyebrows were drawn up to\r\nthe top of his forehead. It may naturally be supposed that the possessor\r\nof so goodly an appendage would resist with abhorrence an order condemning\r\nit to the shears. On hearing the general orders, he discharged a tempest\r\nof veteran, soldier-like oaths, and dunder and blixums--swore he would\r\nbreak any man's head who attempted to meddle with his tail--queued it\r\nstiffer than ever, and whisked it about the garrison as fiercely as the\r\ntail of a crocodile.\r\n\r\nThe eelskin queue of old Keldermeester became instantly an affair of the\r\nutmost importance. The commander-in-chief was too enlightened an officer\r\nnot to perceive that the discipline of the garrison, the subordination and\r\ngood order of the armies of the Nieuw-Nederlands, the consequent safety of\r\nthe whole province, and ultimately the dignity and prosperity of their\r\nHigh Mightinesses the Lords States General, imperiously demanded the\r\ndocking of that stubborn queue. He decreed, therefore, that old\r\nKeldermeester should be publicly shorn of his glories in presence of the\r\nwhole garrison--the old man as resolutely stood on the defensive-whereupon\r\nhe was arrested and tried by a court-martial for mutiny, desertion, and\r\nall the other list of offences noticed in the articles of war, ending with\r\na \"videlicet, in wearing an eelskin queue, three feet long, contrary to\r\norders.\" Then came on arraignments, and trials, and pleadings; and the\r\nwhole garrison was in a ferment about this unfortunate queue. As it is\r\nwell known that the commander of a frontier post has the power of acting\r\npretty much after his own will, there is little doubt but that the veteran\r\nwould have been hanged or shot at least, had he not luckily fallen ill of\r\na fever, through mere chagrin and mortification--and deserted from all\r\nearthly command, with his beloved locks unviolated. His obstinacy remained\r\nunshaken to the very last moment, when he directed that he should be\r\ncarried to his grave with his eelskin queue sticking out of a hole in his\r\ncoffin.\r\n\r\nThis magnanimous affair obtained the general great credit as a\r\ndisciplinarian; but it is hinted that he was ever afterwards subject to\r\nbad dreams and fearful visitations in the night, when the grizzly spectrum\r\nof old Keldermeester would stand sentinel by his bedside, erect as a pump,\r\nhis enormous queue strutting out like the handle.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [46] Ballad of Dragon of Wantley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOK VI._\r\n\r\nCONTAINING THE SECOND PART OF THE REIGN OF PETER THE HEADSTRONG, AND HIS\r\nGALLANT ACHIEVEMENTS ON THE DELAWARE.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto, most venerable and courteous reader, have I shown thee the\r\nadministration of the valorous Stuyvesant, under the mild moonshine of\r\npeace, or rather the grim tranquillity of awful expectation; but now the\r\nwar-drum rumbles from afar, the brazen trumpet brays its thrilling note,\r\nand the rude clash of hostile arms speaks fearful prophecies of coming\r\ntroubles. The gallant warrior starts from soft repose--from golden visions\r\nand voluptuous ease; where, in the dulcet \"piping time of peace,\" he\r\nsought sweet solace after all his toils. No more in Beauty's siren lap\r\nreclined he weaves fair garlands for his lady's brows; no more entwines\r\nwith flowers his shining sword nor through the livelong lazy summer's day\r\nchants forth his love-sick soul in madrigals. To manhood roused, he spurns\r\nthe amorous flute, doffs from his brawny back the robe of peace, and\r\nclothes his pampered limbs in panoply of steel. O'er his dark brow, where\r\nlate the myrtle waved, where wanton roses breathed enervate love, he rears\r\nthe beaming casque and nodding plume; grasps the bright shield, and shakes\r\nthe ponderous lance; or mounts with eager pride his fiery steed, and burns\r\nfor deeds of glorious chivalry.\r\n\r\nBut soft, worthy reader! I would not have you imagine that any _preux\r\nchevalier_, thus hideously begirt with iron, existed in the city of New\r\nAmsterdam. This is but a lofty and gigantic mode, in which we heroic\r\nwriters always talk of war, thereby to give it a noble and imposing\r\naspect; equipping our warriors with bucklers, helms, and lances, and\r\nsuch-like outlandish and obsolete weapons, the like of which perchance\r\nthey had never seen or heard of; in the same manner that a cunning\r\nstatuary arrays a modern general or an admiral in the accoutrements of a\r\nCæsar or an Alexander. The simple truth, then, of all this oratorical\r\nflourish is this: that the valiant Peter Stuyvesant all of a sudden found\r\nit necessary to scour his rusty blade, which too long had rusted in its\r\nscabbard, and prepare himself to undergo those hardy toils of war, in\r\nwhich his mighty soul so much delighted.\r\n\r\nMethinks I at this moment behold him in my imagination; or rather, I\r\nbehold his goodly portrait, which still hangs in the family mansion of the\r\nStuyvesants, arrayed in all the terrors of a true Dutch general. His\r\nregimental coat of German blue, gorgeously decorated with a goodly show of\r\nlarge brass buttons, reaching from his waistband to his chin; the\r\nvoluminous skirts turned up at the corners, and separating gallantly\r\nbehind, so as to display the seat of a sumptuous pair of brimstone-colored\r\ntrunk-breeches, a graceful style still prevalent among the warriors of our\r\nday, and which is in conformity to the custom of ancient heroes, who\r\nscorned to defend themselves in rear. His face, rendered exceeding\r\nterrible and warlike by a pair of black mustachios; his hair strutting out\r\non each side in stiffly pomatumed ear-locks, and descending in a rat-tail\r\nqueue below his waist; a shining stock of black leather supporting his\r\nchin, and a little but fierce cocked hat, stuck with a gallant and fiery\r\nair over his left eye. Such was the chivalric port of Peter the\r\nHeadstrong; and when he made a sudden halt, planted himself firmly on his\r\nsolid supporter, with his wooden leg inlaid with silver a little in\r\nadvance, in order to strengthen his position, his right hand grasping a\r\ngold-headed cane, his left resting upon the pummel of his sword, his head\r\ndressing spiritedly to the right, with a most appalling and hard-favored\r\nfrown upon his brow, he presented altogether one of the most commanding,\r\nbitter-looking, and soldier-like figures that ever strutted upon canvas.\r\nProceed we now to inquire the cause of this warlike preparation.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter we have spoken of the founding of Fort Casimir,\r\nand of the merciless warfare waged by its commander upon cabbages,\r\nsunflowers, and pumpkins, for want of better occasion to flesh his sword.\r\nNow it came to pass that higher up the Delaware, at his stronghold of\r\nTinnekonk, resided one Jan Printz, who styled himself Governor of New\r\nSweden. If history belie not this redoubtable Swede, he was a rival worthy\r\nof the windy and inflated commander of Fort Casimir; for Master David\r\nPieterzen de Vrie, in his excellent book of voyages, describes him as\r\n\"weighing upwards of four hundred pounds,\" a huge feeder, and bouser in\r\nproportion, taking three potations, pottle-deep, at every meal. He had a\r\ngarrison after his own heart at Tinnekonk, guzzling, deep-drinking\r\nswashbucklers, who made the wild woods ring with their carousals.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did this robustious commander hear of the erection of Fort\r\nCasimir, than he sent a message to Van Poffenburgh, warning him off the\r\nland, as being within the bounds of his jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nTo this General Van Poffenburgh replied that the land belonged to their\r\nHigh Mightinesses, having been regularly purchased of the natives as\r\ndiscoverers from the Manhattoes, as witness the breeches of their land\r\nmeasurer, Ten Broeck.\r\n\r\nTo this the governor rejoined that the land had previously been sold by\r\nthe Indians to the Swedes, and consequently was under the petticoat\r\ngovernment of her Swedish majesty, Christina; and woe be to any mortal\r\nthat wore a breeches who should dare to meddle even with the hem of her\r\nsacred garment.\r\n\r\nI forbear to dilate upon the war of words which was kept up for some time\r\nby these windy commanders; Van-Poffenburgh, however, had served under\r\nWilliam the Testy, and was a veteran in this kind of warfare. Governor\r\nPrintz, finding he was not to be dislodged by these long shots, now\r\ndetermined upon coming to closer quarters. Accordingly he descended the\r\nriver in great force and fume, and erected a rival fortress just one\r\nSwedish mile below Fort Casimir, to which he gave the name of Helsenburg.\r\n\r\nAnd now commenced a tremendous rivalry between these two doughty\r\ncommanders, striving to outstrut and outswell each other, like a couple of\r\nbelligerent turkey-cocks. There was a contest who should run up the\r\ntallest flag-staff and display the broadest flag; all day long there was a\r\nfurious rolling of drums and twanging of trumpets in either fortress, and,\r\nwhichever had the wind in its favor, would keep up a continual firing of\r\ncannon, to taunt its antagonist with the smell of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nOn all these points of windy warfare the antagonists were well matched;\r\nbut so it happened that the Swedish fortress being lower down the river,\r\nall the Dutch vessels, bound to Fort Casimir with supplies, had to pass\r\nit. Governor Printz at once took advantage of this circumstance, and\r\ncompelled them to lower their flags as they passed under the guns of his\r\nbattery.\r\n\r\nThis was a deadly wound to the Dutch pride of General Van Poffenburgh, and\r\nsorely would he swell when from the ramparts of Fort Casimir he beheld the\r\nflag of their High Mightinesses struck to the rival fortress. To heighten\r\nhis vexation, Governor Printz, who, as has been shown, was a huge\r\ntrencherman, took the liberty of having the first rummage of every Dutch\r\nmerchant-ship, and securing to himself and his guzzling garrison all the\r\nlittle round Dutch cheeses, all the Dutch herrings, the gingerbread, the\r\nsweetmeats, the curious stone jugs of gin, and all the other Dutch\r\nluxuries, on their way for the solace of Fort Casimir. It is possible he\r\nmay have paid to the Dutch skippers the full value of their commodities,\r\nbut what consolation was this to Jacobus Van Poffenburgh and his garrison,\r\nwho thus found their favorite supplies cut off, and diverted into the\r\nlarders of the hostile camps? For some time this war of the cupboard was\r\ncarried on to the great festivity and jollification of the Swedes, while\r\nthe warriors of Fort Casimir found their hearts, or rather their stomachs,\r\ndaily failing them. At length the summer heats and summer showers set in,\r\nand now, lo and behold! a great miracle was wrought for the relief of the\r\nNederlands, not a little resembling one of the plagues of Egypt; for it\r\ncame to pass that a great cloud of mosquitos arose out of the marshy\r\nborders of the river, and settled upon the fortress of Helsenburg, being\r\ndoubtless attracted by the scent of the fresh blood of the Swedish\r\ngormandisers. Nay, it is said that the body of Jan Printz alone, which was\r\nas big and as full of blood as that of a prize ox, was sufficient to\r\nattract the mosquito from every part of the country. For some time the\r\ngarrison endeavored to hold out, but it was all in vain; the mosquitos\r\npenetrated into every chink and crevice, and gave them no rest day nor\r\nnight; and as to Governor Jan Printz, he moved about as in a cloud, with\r\nmosquito music in his ears, and mosquito stings to the very end of his\r\nnose. Finally, the garrison was fairly driven out of the fortress, and\r\nobliged to retreat to Tinnekonk; nay, it is said that the mosquitos\r\nfollowed Jan Printz even thither, and absolutely drove him out of the\r\ncountry; certain it is, he embarked for Sweden shortly afterward, and Jan\r\nClaudius Risingh was sent to govern New Sweden in his stead.\r\n\r\nSuch was the famous mosquito war on the Delaware, of which General Van\r\nPoffenburgh would fain have been the hero; but the devout people of the\r\nNieuw-Nederlands always ascribed the discomfiture of the Swedes to the\r\nmiraculous intervention of St. Nicholas. As to the fortress of Helsenburg,\r\nit fell to ruin, but the story of its strange destruction was perpetuated\r\nby the Swedish name of Myggen-borg, that is to say, Mosquito Castle.[47]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [47] Acrelius' History N. Sweden. For some notices of this\r\n        miraculous discomfiture of the Swedes, see N.Y. Hist. Col., new\r\n        series, vol. i., p. 412.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nJan Claudius Risingh, who succeeded to the command of New Sweden, looms\r\nlargely in ancient records as a gigantic Swede, who, had he not been\r\nrather knock-kneed and splay-footed, might have served for the model of a\r\nSamson or a Hercules. He was no less rapacious than mighty, and withal, as\r\ncrafty as he was rapacious, so that there is very little doubt that, had\r\nhe lived some four or five centuries since, he would have figured as one\r\nof those wicked giants, who took a cruel pleasure in pocketing beautiful\r\nprincesses and distressed damsels, when gadding about the world, and\r\nlocking them up in enchanted castles, without a toilet, a change of linen,\r\nor any other convenience. In consequence of which enormities they fell\r\nunder the high displeasure of chivalry, and all true, loyal, and gallant\r\nknights were instructed to attack and slay outright any miscreant they\r\nmight happen to find above six feet high; which is doubtless one reason\r\nwhy the race of large men is nearly extinct, and the generations of latter\r\nages are so exceedingly small.\r\n\r\nGovernor Risingh, not withstanding his giantly condition, was, as I have\r\nhinted, a man of craft. He was not a man to ruffle the vanity of General\r\nVan Poffenburgh, or to rub his self-conceit against the grain. On the\r\ncontrary, as he sailed up the Delaware, he paused before Fort Casimir,\r\ndisplayed his flag, and fired a royal salute before dropping anchor. The\r\nsalute would doubtless have been returned, had not the guns been\r\ndismounted; as it was, a veteran sentinel who had been napping at his\r\npost, and had suffered his match to go out, returned the compliment by\r\ndischarging his musket with the spark of a pipe borrowed from a comrade.\r\nGovernor Risingh accepted this as a courteous reply, and treated the\r\nfortress to a second salute, well knowing its commander was apt to be\r\nmarvelously delighted with these little ceremonials, considering them so\r\nmany acts of homage paid to his greatness. He then prepared to land with a\r\nmilitary retinue of thirty men, a prodigious pageant in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nAnd now took place a terrible rummage and racket in Fort Casimir, to\r\nreceive such a visitor in proper style, and to make an imposing\r\nappearance. The main guard was turned out as soon as possible, equipped to\r\nthe best advantage in the few suits of regimentals, which had to do duty,\r\nby turns, with the whole garrison. One tall, lank fellow appeared in a\r\nlittle man's coat, with the buttons between his shoulders; the skirts\r\nscarce covering his bottom; his hands hanging like spades out of the\r\nsleeves; and the coat linked in front by worsted loops made out of a pair\r\nof red garters. Another had a cocked hat stuck on the back of his head,\r\nand decorated with a bunch of cocks' tails; a third had a pair of rusty\r\ngaiters hanging about his heels; while a fourth, a little duck-legged\r\nfellow, was equipped in a pair of the general's cast-off breeches, which\r\nhe held up with one hand while he grasped his firelock with the other. The\r\nrest were accoutred in similar style, excepting three ragamuffins without\r\nshirts, and with but a pair and a half of breeches between them; wherefore\r\nthey were sent to the black hole, to keep them out of sight, that they\r\nmight not disgrace the fortress.\r\n\r\nHis men being thus gallantly arrayed--those who lacked muskets\r\nshouldering spades and pickaxes, and every man being ordered to tuck in\r\nhis shirttail and pull up his brogues--General Van Poffenburgh first took\r\na sturdy draught of foaming ale, which, like the magnanimous More, of\r\nMore Hall,[48] was his invariable practice on all great occasions; this\r\ndone, he put himself at their head, and issued forth from his castle like\r\na mighty giant just refreshed with wine. But when the two heroes met,\r\nthen began a scene of warlike parade that beggars all description. The\r\nshrewd Risingh, who had grown grey much before his time, in consequence\r\nof his craftiness, saw at one glance the ruling passion of the great Van\r\nPoffenburgh, and humored him in all his valorous fantasies.\r\n\r\nTheir detachments were accordingly drawn up in front of each other, they\r\ncarried arms and they presented arms, they gave the standing salute and\r\nthe passing salute, they rolled their drums, they flourished their fifes,\r\nand they waved their colors; they faced to the left, and they faced to the\r\nright, and they faced to the right about; they wheeled forward, and they\r\nwheeled backward, and they wheeled into echelon; they marched and they\r\ncountermarched, by grand divisions, by single divisions, and by\r\nsubdivisions; by platoons, by sections, and by files; in quick time, in\r\nslow time, and in no time at all; for, having gone through all the\r\nevolutions of two great armies, including the eighteen manoeuvres of\r\nDundas; having exhausted all that they could recollect or image of\r\nmilitary tactics, including sundry strange and irregular evolutions, the\r\nlike of which were never seen before or since, excepting among certain of\r\nour newly-raised militia, the two commanders and their respective troops\r\ncame at length to a dead halt, completely exhausted by the toils of war.\r\nNever did two valiant train-band captains, or two buskined theatric\r\nheroes, in the renowned tragedies of Pizarro, Tom Thumb, or any other\r\nheroical and fighting tragedy, marshal their gallows-looking, duck-legged,\r\nheavy-heeled myrmidons with more glory and self-admiration.\r\n\r\nThese military compliments being finished, General Van Poffenburgh\r\nescorted his illustrious visitor, with great ceremony, into the fort,\r\nattended him throughout the fortifications, showed him the horn-works,\r\ncrown-works, half-moons, and various other outworks, or rather the places\r\nwhere they ought to be erected, and where they might be erected if he\r\npleased; plainly demonstrating that it was a place of \"great capability,\"\r\nand though at present but a little redoubt, yet that it was evidently a\r\nformidable fortress in embryo. This survey over, he next had the whole\r\ngarrison put under arms, exercised, and reviewed, and concluded by\r\nordering the three Bridewell birds to be hauled out of the black hole,\r\nbrought up to the halberds, and soundly flogged for the amusement of his\r\nvisitors, and to convince him that he was a great disciplinarian.\r\n\r\nThe cunning Risingh, while he pretended to be struck dumb outright with\r\nthe puissance of the great Van Poffenburgh, took silent note of the\r\nincompetency of his garrison, of which he gave a wink to his trusty\r\nfollowers, who tipped each other the wink, and laughed most obstreperously\r\nin their sleeves.\r\n\r\nThe inspection, review, and flogging being concluded, the party adjourned\r\nto the table; for, among his other great qualities, the general was\r\nremarkably addicted to huge carousals, and in one afternoon's campaign\r\nwould leave more dead men on the field than he ever did in the whole\r\ncourse of his military career. Many bulletins of these bloodless\r\nvictories do still remain on record, and the whole province was once\r\nthrown in amaze by the return of one of his campaigns, wherein it was\r\nstated, that though, like Captain Bobadil, he had only twenty men to back\r\nhim, yet in the short space of six months he had conquered and utterly\r\nannihilated sixty oxen, ninety hogs, one hundred sheep, ten thousand\r\ncabbages, one thousand bushels of potatoes, one hundred and fifty\r\nkilderkins of small beer, two thousand seven hundred and thirty-five\r\npipes, seventy-eight pounds of sugar-plums, and forty bars of iron,\r\nbesides sundry small meats, game, poultry, and garden stuff: an\r\nachievement unparalleled since the days of Pantagruel and his\r\nall-devouring army, and which showed that it was only necessary to let Van\r\nPoffenburgh and his garrison loose in an enemy's country, and in a little\r\nwhile they would breed a famine, and starve all the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nNo sooner, therefore, had the general received intimation of the visit of\r\nGovernor Risingh, than he ordered a great dinner to be prepared, and\r\nprivately sent out a detachment of his most experienced veterans to rob\r\nall the hen-roosts in the neighborhood, and lay the pigstyes under\r\ncontribution: a service which they discharged with such zeal and\r\npromptitude, that the garrison table groaned under the weight of their\r\nspoils.\r\n\r\nI wish, with all my heart, my readers could see the valiant Van\r\nPoffenburgh, as he presided at the head of the banquet: it was a sight\r\nworth beholding: there he sat in his greatest glory, surrounded by his\r\nsoldiers, like that famous wine-bibber, Alexander, whose thirsty virtues\r\nhe did most ably imitate, telling astounding stories of his hair-breadth\r\nadventures and heroic exploits; at which, though all his auditors knew\r\nthem to be incontinent lies and outrageous gasconades, yet did they cast\r\nup their eyes in admiration, and utter many interjections of astonishment.\r\nNor could the general pronounce anything that bore the remotest\r\nresemblance to a joke, but the stout Risingh would strike his brawny fist\r\nupon the table till every glass rattled again, throw himself back in the\r\nchair, utter gigantic peals of laughter, and swear most horribly it was\r\nthe best joke he ever heard in his life. Thus all was rout and revelry and\r\nhideous carousal within Fort Casimir, and so lustily did Van Poffenburgh\r\nply the bottle, that in less than four short hours he made himself and his\r\nwhole garrison, who all sedulously emulated the deeds of their chieftain,\r\ndead drunk, with singing songs, quaffing bumpers, and drinking patriotic\r\ntoasts, none of which but was as long as a Welsh pedigree or a plea in\r\nChancery.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did things come to this pass, than Risingh and his Swedes, who\r\nhad cunningly kept themselves sober, rose on their entertainers, tied them\r\nneck and heels, and took formal possession of the fort and all its\r\ndependencies, in the name of Queen Christina of Sweden, administering at\r\nthe same time an oath of allegiance to all the Dutch soldiers who could be\r\nmade sober enough to swallow it. Risingh then put the fortifications in\r\norder, appointed his discreet and vigilant friend Suen Schute, otherwise\r\ncalled Skytte, a tall, wind-dried, water-drinking Swede, to the command,\r\nand departed, bearing with him this truly amiable garrison and its\r\npuissant commander, who, when brought to himself by a sound drubbing, bore\r\nno little resemblance to a \"deboshed fish,\" or bloated sea-monster, caught\r\nupon dry land.\r\n\r\nThe transportation of the garrison was done to prevent the transmission of\r\nintelligence to New Amsterdam; for much as the cunning Risingh exulted in\r\nhis stratagem, yet did he dread the vengeance of the sturdy Peter\r\nStuyvesant, whose name spread as much terror in the neighborhood as did\r\nwhilom that of the unconquerable Scanderbeg among his scurvy enemies the\r\nTurks.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [48]\r\n              \"As soon as he rose,\r\n          To make him strong and mighty,\r\n        He drank by the tale, six pots of ale,\r\n          And a quart of aqua vitæ.\"\r\n\r\n                    _Dragon of Wantley._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhoever first described common fame, or rumor, as belonging to the sager\r\nsex, was a very owl for shrewdness. She has in truth certain feminine\r\nqualities to an astonishing degree, particularly that benevolent anxiety\r\nto take care of the affairs of others, which keeps her continually hunting\r\nafter secrets and gadding about proclaiming them. Whatever is done openly\r\nand in the face of the world, she takes but transient notice of; but\r\nwhenever a transaction is done in a corner, and attempted to be shrouded\r\nin mystery, then her goddess-ship is at her wits' end to find it out, and\r\ntakes a most mischievous and lady-like pleasure in publishing it to the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIt is this truly feminine propensity which induces her continually to be\r\nprying into the cabinets of princes, listening at the key-holes of senate\r\nchambers, and peering through chinks and crannies, when our worthy\r\ncongress are sitting with closed doors, deliberating between a dozen\r\nexcellent modes of ruining the nation. It is this which makes her so\r\nbaneful to all wary statesmen and intriguing commanders--such a\r\nstumbling-block to private negotiations and secret expeditions; betraying\r\nthem by means and instruments which never would have been thought of by\r\nany but a female head.\r\n\r\nThus it was in the case of the affair of Fort Casimir. No doubt the\r\ncunning Risingh imagined, that, by securing the garrison he should for a\r\nlong time prevent the history of its fate from reaching the ears of the\r\ngallant Stuyvesant; but his exploit was blown to the world when he least\r\nexpected, and by one of the last beings he would ever have suspected of\r\nenlisting as trumpeter to the wide-mouthed deity.\r\n\r\nThis was one Dirk Schuiler (or Skulker), a kind of hanger-on to the\r\ngarrison, who seemed to belong to nobody, and in a manner to be\r\nself-outlawed. He was one of those vagabond cosmopolites who shark about\r\nthe world, as if they had no right or business in it, and who infest the\r\nskirts of society like poachers and interlopers. Every garrison and\r\ncountry village has one or more scapegoats of this kind, whose life is a\r\nkind of enigma, whose existence is without motive, who comes from the Lord\r\nknows where, who lives the Lord knows how, and who seems created for no\r\nother earthly purpose but to keep up the ancient and honorable order of\r\nidleness. This vagrant philosopher was supposed to have some Indian blood\r\nin his veins, which was manifested by a certain Indian complexion and cast\r\nof countenance, but more especially by his propensities and habits. He was\r\na tall, lank fellow, swift of foot, and long-winded. He was generally\r\nequipped in a half Indian dress, with belt, leggings, and moccasins. His\r\nhair hung in straight gallows locks about his ears, and added not a little\r\nto his sharking demeanor. It is an old remark, that persons of Indian\r\nmixture, are half civilized, half savage, and half devil--a third half\r\nbeing provided for their particular convenience. It is for similar\r\nreasons, and probably with equal truth, that the backwoodsmen of Kentucky\r\nare styled half man, half horse, and half alligator by the settlers on the\r\nMississippi, and held accordingly in great respect and abhorrence.\r\n\r\nThe above character may have presented itself to the garrison as\r\napplicable to Dirk Schuiler, whom they familiarly dubbed Gallows Dirk.\r\nCertain it is, he acknowledged allegiance to no one--was an utter enemy to\r\nwork, holding it in no manner of estimation--but lounging about the fort,\r\ndepending upon chance for a subsistence, getting drunk whenever he could\r\nget liquor, and stealing whatever he could lay his hands on. Every day or\r\ntwo he was sure to get a sound rib-roasting for some of his misdemeanors;\r\nwhich, however, as it broke no bones, he made very light of, and scrupled\r\nnot to repeat the offence whenever another opportunity presented.\r\nSometimes, in consequence of some flagrant villainy, he would abscond from\r\nthe garrison, and be absent for a month at a time; skulking about the\r\nwoods and swamps, with a long fowling-piece on his shoulder, lying in\r\nambush for game, or squatting himself down on the edge of a pond catching\r\nfish for hours together, and bearing no little resemblance to that notable\r\nbird of the crane family, yclept the mudpoke. When he thought his crimes\r\nhad been forgotten or forgiven, he would sneak back to the fort with a\r\nbundle of skins or a load of poultry, which, perchance, he had stolen, and\r\nwould exchange them for liquor, with which having well soaked his carcase,\r\nhe would lie in the sun, and enjoy all the luxurious indolence of that\r\nswinish philosopher Diogenes. He was the terror of all the farmyards in\r\nthe country, into which he made fearful inroads; and sometimes he would\r\nmake his sudden appearance in the garrison at daybreak, with the whole\r\nneighborhood at his heels; like the scoundrel thief of a fox, detected in\r\nhis maraudings and hunted to his hole. Such was this Dirk Schuiler; and\r\nfrom the total indifference he showed to the world and its concerns, and\r\nfrom his truly Indian stoicism and taciturnity, no one would ever have\r\ndreamt that he would have been the publisher of the treachery of Risingh.\r\n\r\nWhen the carousal was going on, which proved so fatal to the brave\r\nPoffenburgh and his watchful garrison, Dirk skulked about from room to\r\nroom, being a kind of privileged vagrant, or useless hound whom nobody\r\nnoticed. But though a fellow of few words, yet, like your taciturn people,\r\nhis eyes and ears were always open, and in the course of his prowlings he\r\noverheard the whole plot of the Swedes. Dirk immediately settled in his\r\nown mind how he should turn the matter to his own advantage. He played the\r\nperfect jack-of-both-sides--that is to say, he made a prize of everything\r\nthat came in his reach, robbed both parties, stuck the copper-bound cocked\r\nhat of the puissant Van Poffenburgh on his head, whipped a huge pair of\r\nRisingh's jack-boots under his arms, and took to his heels, just before\r\nthe catastrophe and confusion at the garrison.\r\n\r\nFinding himself completely dislodged from his haunt in this quarter, he\r\ndirected his flight towards his native place, New Amsterdam, whence he had\r\nformerly been obliged to abscond precipitately, in consequence of\r\nmisfortune in business--that is to say, having been detected in the act of\r\nsheep-stealing. After wandering many days in the woods, toiling through\r\nswamps, fording brooks, swimming various rivers, and encountering a world\r\nof hardships that would have killed any other being but an Indian, a\r\nbackwoodsman, or the devil, he at length arrived, half famished, and lank\r\nas a starved weasel, at Communipaw, where he stole a canoe, and paddled\r\nover to New Amsterdam. Immediately on landing, he repaired to Governor\r\nStuyvesant, and in more words than he had ever spoken before in the whole\r\ncourse of his life, gave an account of the disastrous affair.\r\n\r\nOn receiving these direful tidings, the valiant Peter started from his\r\nseat--dashed the pipe he was smoking against the back of the\r\nchimney--thrust a prodigious quid of tobacco into his left cheek--pulled\r\nup his galligaskins, and strode up and down the room, humming, as was\r\ncustomary with him when in a passion, a hideous north-west ditty. But, as\r\nI have before shown, he was not a man to vent his spleen in idle vaporing.\r\nHis first measure, after the paroxysm of wrath had subsided, was to stump\r\nupstairs to a huge wooden chest which served as his armory, from whence he\r\ndrew forth that identical suit of regimentals described in the preceding\r\nchapter. In these portentous habiliment she arrayed himself, like Achilles\r\nin the armor of Vulcan, maintaining all the while an appalling silence,\r\nknitting his brows, and drawing his breath through his clenched teeth.\r\nBeing hastily equipped, he strode down into the parlor, and jerked down\r\nhis trusty sword from over the fireplace, where it was usually suspended;\r\nbut before he girded it on his thigh, he drew it from its scabbard, and as\r\nhis eye coursed along the rusty blade, a grim smile stole over his iron\r\nvisage; it was the first smile that had visited his countenance for five\r\nlong weeks; but every one who beheld it prophesied that there would soon\r\nbe warm work in the province!\r\n\r\nThus armed at all points, with grisly war depicted in each feature, his\r\nvery cocked hat assuming an air of uncommon defiance, he instantly put\r\nhimself upon the alert, and dispatched Antony Van Corlear hither and\r\nthither, this way and that way, through all the muddy streets and crooked\r\nlanes of the city, summoning by sound of trumpet his trusty peers to\r\nassemble in instant council. This done, by way of expediting matters,\r\naccording to the custom of people in a hurry, he kept in continual bustle,\r\nshifting from chair to chair, popping his head out of every window, and\r\nstumping up and downstairs with his wooden leg in such brisk and incessant\r\nmotion, that, as we are informed by an authentic historian of the times,\r\nthe continual clatter bore no small resemblance to the music of a cooper\r\nhooping a flour-barrel.\r\n\r\nA summons so peremptory, and from a man of the governor's mettle, was not\r\nto be trifled with; the sages forthwith repaired to the council chamber,\r\nseated themselves with the utmost tranquillity, and lighting their long\r\npipes, gazed with unruffled composure on his excellency and his\r\nregimentals; being, as all counsellors should be, not easily flustered,\r\nnor taken by surprise. The governor, looking around for a moment with a\r\nlofty and soldier-like air, and resting one hand on the pommel of his\r\nsword, and flinging the other forth in a free and spirited manner,\r\naddressed them in a short but soul-stirring harangue.\r\n\r\nI am extremely sorry that I have not the advantages of Livy, Thucydides,\r\nPlutarch, and others of my predecessors, who were furnished, as I am told,\r\nwith the speeches of all their heroes taken down in short-hand by the most\r\naccurate stenographers of the time, whereby they were enabled wonderfully\r\nto enrich their histories, and delight their readers with sublime strains\r\nof eloquence. Not having such important auxiliaries, I cannot possibly\r\npronounce what was the tenor of Governor Stuyvesant's speech. I am bold,\r\nhowever, to say, from the tenor of his character, that he did not wrap his\r\nrugged subject in silks and ermines, and other sickly trickeries of\r\nphrase, but spoke forth like a man of nerve and vigor, who scorned to\r\nshrink in words from those dangers which he stood ready to encounter in\r\nvery deed. This much is certain, that he concluded by announcing his\r\ndetermination to lead on his troops in person, and rout these\r\ncostard-monger Swedes from their usurped quarters at Fort Casimir. To this\r\nhardy resolution, such of his council as were awake gave their usual\r\nsignal of concurrence; and as to the rest, who had fallen asleep about the\r\nmiddle of the harangue (their \"usual custom in the afternoon\"), they made\r\nnot the least objection.\r\n\r\nAnd now was seen in the fair city of New Amsterdam a prodigious bustle and\r\npreparation for iron war. Recruiting parties marched hither and thither,\r\ncalling lustily upon all the scrubs, the runagates, and tatterdemalions of\r\nthe Manhattoes and its vicinity, who had any ambition of sixpence a day,\r\nand immortal fame into the bargain, to enlist in the cause of glory; for I\r\nwould have you note that you warlike heroes who trudge in the rear of\r\nconquerors are generally of that illustrious class of gentlemen who are\r\nequal candidates for the army or the bridewell, the halberds or the\r\nwhipping-post, for whom Dame Fortune has cast an even die whether they\r\nshall make their exit by the sword or the halter, and whose deaths shall,\r\nat all events, be a lofty example to their countrymen.\r\n\r\nBut, not withstanding all this martial rout and invitation, the ranks of\r\nhonor were but scantily supplied, so averse were the peaceful burghers of\r\nNew Amsterdam from enlisting in foreign broils, or stirring beyond that\r\nhome which rounded all their earthly ideas. Upon beholding this, the great\r\nPeter, whose noble heart was all on fire with war, and sweet revenge,\r\ndetermined to wait no longer for the tardy assistance of these oily\r\ncitizens, but to muster up his merry men of the Hudson, who, brought up\r\namong woods, and wilds, and savage beasts, like our yeomen of Kentucky,\r\ndelighted in nothing so much as desperate adventures and perilous\r\nexpeditions through the wilderness. Thus resolving, he ordered his trusty\r\nsquire, Antony Van Corlear, to have his state galley prepared and duly\r\nvictualed; which being performed, he attended public service at the great\r\nchurch of St. Nicholas, like a true and pious governor; and then leaving\r\nperemptory orders with his council to have the chivalry of the Manhattoes\r\nmarshaled out and appointed against his return, departed upon his\r\nrecruiting voyage up the waters of the Hudson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow did the soft breezes of the south steal sweetly over the face of\r\nnature, tempering the panting heats of summer into genial and prolific\r\nwarmth, when that miracle of hardihood and chivalric virtue, the dauntless\r\nPeter Stuyvesant, spread his canvas to the wind, and departed from the\r\nfair island of Manna-hata. The galley in which he embarked was\r\nsumptuously adorned with pendants and streamers of gorgeous dyes, which\r\nfluttered gayly in the wind, or drooped their ends into the bosom of the\r\nstream. The bow and poop of this majestic vessel were gallantly bedight,\r\nafter the rarest Dutch fashion, with figures of little pursy Cupids with\r\nperiwigs on their heads, and bearing in their hands garlands of flowers\r\nthe like of which are not to be found in any book of botany, being the\r\nmatchless flowers which flourished in the golden age, and exist no longer,\r\nunless it be in the imaginations of ingenious carvers of wood and\r\ndiscolorers of canvas.\r\n\r\nThus rarely decorated, in style befitting the puissant potentate of the\r\nManhattoes, did the galley of Peter Stuyvesant launch forth upon the bosom\r\nof the lordly Hudson, which, as it rolled its broad waves to the ocean,\r\nseemed to pause for a while and swell with pride, as if conscious of the\r\nillustrious burden it sustained.\r\n\r\nBut trust me, gentlefolk, far other was the scene presented to the\r\ncontemplation of the crew from that which may be witnessed at this\r\ndegenerate day. Wildness and savage majesty reigned on the borders of this\r\nmighty river; the hand of cultivation had not as yet laid low the dark\r\nforest and tamed the features of the landscape, nor had the frequent sail\r\nof commerce broken in upon the profound and awful solitude of ages. Here\r\nand there might be seen a rude wigwam perched among the cliffs of the\r\nmountains, with its curling column of smoke mounting in the transparent\r\natmosphere, but so loftily situated that the whoopings of the savage\r\nchildren, gamboling on the margin of the dizzy heights, fell almost as\r\nfaintly on the ear as do the notes of the lark when lost in the azure\r\nvault of heaven. Now and then, from the beetling brow of some precipice,\r\nthe wild deer would look timidly down upon the splendid pageant as it\r\npassed below, and then, tossing his antlers in the air, would bound away\r\ninto the thickets of the forest.\r\n\r\nThrough such scenes did the stately vessel of Peter Stuyvesant pass. Now\r\ndid they skirt the bases of the rocky heights of Jersey, which sprang up\r\nlike everlasting walls, reaching from the waves unto the heavens, and were\r\nfashioned, if tradition may be believed, in times long past, by the mighty\r\nspirit of Manetho, to protect his favorite abodes from the unhallowed eyes\r\nof mortals. Now did they career it gayly across the vast expanse of Tappan\r\nBay, whose wide extended shores present a variety of delectable scenery;\r\nhere the bold promontory, crowned with embowering trees, advancing into\r\nthe bay; there the long woodland slope, sweeping up from the shore in rich\r\nluxuriance, and terminating in the upland precipice, while at a distance,\r\na long waving line of rocky heights threw their gigantic shades across the\r\nwater. Now would they pass where some modest little interval, opening\r\namong these stupendous scenes, yet retreating as it were for protection\r\ninto the embraces of the neighboring mountains, displayed a rural\r\nparadise, fraught with sweet and pastoral beauties; the velvet-tufted\r\nlawn, the bushy copse, the tinkling rivulet, stealing through the fresh\r\nand vivid verdure, on whose banks was situated some little Indian village,\r\nor, peradventure, the rude cabin of some solitary hunter.\r\n\r\nThe different periods of the revolving day seemed each, with cunning\r\nmagic, to diffuse a different charm over the scene. Now would the jovial\r\nsun break gloriously from the east, blazing from the summits of the hills,\r\nand sparkling the landscape with a thousand dewy gems; while along the\r\nborders of the river were seen heavy masses of mist, which, like midnight\r\ncaitiffs, disturbed at his reproach, made a sluggish retreat, rolling in\r\nsullen reluctance upon the mountains. As such times all was brightness,\r\nand life, and gayety; the atmosphere was of an indescribable pureness and\r\ntransparency; the birds broke forth in wanton madrigals, and the\r\nfreshening breezes wafted the vessel merrily on her course. But when the\r\nsun sunk amid a flood of glory in the west, mantling the heavens and the\r\nearth with a thousand gorgeous dyes, then all was calm, and silent, and\r\nmagnificent. The late swelling sail hung lifelessly against the mast; the\r\nseamen, with folded arms, leaned against the shrouds, lost in that\r\ninvoluntary musing which the sober grandeur of nature commands in the\r\nrudest of her children. The vast bosom of the Hudson was like an unruffled\r\nmirror, reflecting the golden splendor of the heavens; excepting that now\r\nand then a bark canoe would steal across its surface, filled with painted\r\nsavages, whose gay feathers glared brightly, as perchance a lingering ray\r\nof the setting sun gleamed upon them from the western mountains.\r\n\r\nBut when the hour of twilight spread its majestic mists around, then did\r\nthe face of nature assume a thousand fugitive charms, which to the worthy\r\nheart that seeks enjoyment in the glorious works of its Maker are\r\ninexpressibly captivating. The mellow dubious light that prevailed just\r\nserved to tinge with illusive colors the softened features of the scenery.\r\nThe deceived but delighted eye sought vainly to discern, in the broad\r\nmasses of shade, the separating line between the land and water, or to\r\ndistinguish the fading objects that seemed sinking into chaos. Now did the\r\nbusy fancy supply the feebleness of vision, producing with industrious\r\ncraft a fairy creation of her own. Under her plastic wand the barren rocks\r\nfrowned upon the watery waste, in the semblance of lofty towers, and high\r\nembattled castles; trees assumed the direful forms of mighty giants, and\r\nthe inaccessible summits of the mountains seemed peopled with a thousand\r\nshadowy beings.\r\n\r\nNow broke forth from the shores the notes of an innumerable variety of\r\ninsects, which filled the air with a strange but not inharmonious concert;\r\nwhile ever and anon was heard the melancholy plaint of the whip-poor-will,\r\nwho, perched on some lone tree, wearied the ear of night with his\r\nincessant moanings. The mind, soothed into a hallowed melancholy, listened\r\nwith pensive stillness to catch and distinguish each sound that vaguely\r\nechoed from the shore--now and then startled, perchance, by the whoop of\r\nsome straggling savage, or by the dreary howl of a wolf, stealing forth\r\nupon his nightly prowlings.\r\n\r\nThus happily did they pursue their course, until they entered upon those\r\nawful defiles denominated the Highlands, where it would seem that the\r\ngigantic Titans had erst waged their impious war with heaven, piling up\r\ncliffs on cliffs, and hurling vast masses of rock in wild confusion. But\r\nin sooth very different is the history of these cloud-capped mountains.\r\nThese in ancient days, before the Hudson poured its waters from the lakes,\r\nformed one vast prison, within whose rocky bosom the omnipotent Manetho\r\nconfined the rebellious spirits who repined at his control. Here, bound in\r\nadamantine chains, or jammed in rifted pines, or crushed by ponderous\r\nrocks, they groaned for many an age. At length the conquering Hudson, in\r\nits career toward the ocean, burst open their prison-house, rolling its\r\ntide triumphantly through the stupendous ruins.\r\n\r\nStill, however, do many of them lurk about their old abodes; and these it\r\nis, according to venerable legends, that cause the echoes which resound\r\nthroughout these awful solitudes, which are nothing but their angry\r\nclamors when any noise disturbs the profoundness of their repose. For when\r\nthe elements are agitated by tempest, when the winds are up and the\r\nthunder rolls, then horrible is the yelling and howling of these troubled\r\nspirits, making the mountains to re-bellow with their hideous uproar; for\r\nat such times it is said that they think the great Manetho is returning\r\nonce more to plunge them in gloomy caverns, and renew their intolerable\r\ncaptivity.\r\n\r\nBut all these fair and glorious scenes were lost upon the gallant\r\nStuyvesant; nought occupied his mind but thoughts of iron war, and proud\r\nanticipations of hardy deeds of arms. Neither did his honest crew trouble\r\ntheir heads with any romantic speculations of the kind. The pilot at the\r\nhelm quietly smoked his pipe, thinking of nothing either past, present, or\r\nto come; those of his comrades who were not industriously smoking under\r\nthe hatches were listening with open mouths to Antony Van Corlear, who,\r\nseated on the windlass, was relating to them the marvelous history of\r\nthose myriads of fireflies, that sparkled like gems and spangles upon the\r\ndusky robe of night. These, according to tradition, were originally a race\r\nof pestilent sempiternous beldames, who peopled these parts long before\r\nthe memory of man, being of that abominated race emphatically called\r\nbrimstones; and who, for their innumerable sins against the children of\r\nmen, and to furnish an awful warning to the beauteous sex, were doomed to\r\ninfest the earth in the shade of these threatening and terrible little\r\nbugs; enduring the internal torments of that fire, which they formerly\r\ncarried in their hearts and breathed forth in their words, but now are\r\nsentenced to bear about for ever--in their tails!\r\n\r\nAnd now I am going to tell a fact, which I doubt much my readers will\r\nhesitate to believe; but if they do, they are welcome not to believe a\r\nword in this whole history--for nothing which it contains is more true. It\r\nmust be known then that the nose of Antony the Trumpeter was of a very\r\nlusty size, strutting boldly from his countenance like a mountain of\r\nGolconda, being sumptuously bedecked with rubies and other precious\r\nstones, the true regalia of a king of good fellows, which jolly Bacchus\r\ngrants to all who bouse it heartily at the flagon. Now thus it happened,\r\nthat bright and early in the morning, the good Antony, having washed his\r\nburly visage, was leaning over the quarter-railing of the galley,\r\ncontemplating it in the glassy wave below. Just at this moment the\r\nillustrious sun, breaking in all his splendor from behind a high bluff of\r\nthe Highlands, did dart one of his most potent beams full upon the\r\nrefulgent nose of the sounder of brass; the reflection of which shot\r\nstraightway down, hissing hot, into the water, and killed a mighty\r\nsturgeon that was sporting beside the vessel! This huge monster being with\r\ninfinite labor hoisted on board, furnished a luxurious repast to all the\r\ncrew, being accounted of excellent flavor, excepting about the wound,\r\nwhere it smacked a little of brimstone; and this, on my veracity, was the\r\nfirst time that ever sturgeon was eaten in those parts by Christian\r\npeople.[49]\r\n\r\nWhen this astonishing miracle came to be made known to Peter Stuyvesant,\r\nand that he tasted of the unknown fish, he, as may well be supposed,\r\nmarveled exceedingly: and as a monument thereof, he gave the name of\r\nAntony's Nose to a stout promontory in the neighborhood; and it has\r\ncontinued to be called Antony's Nose ever since that time.\r\n\r\nBut hold, whither am I wandering? By the mass, if I attempt to accompany\r\nthe good Peter Stuyvesant on this voyage, I shall never make an end; for\r\nnever was there a voyage so fraught with marvelous incidents, nor a river\r\nso abounding with transcendent beauties, worthy of being severally\r\nrecorded. Even now I have it on the point of my pen to relate how his crew\r\nwere most horribly frightened, on going on shore above the Highlands, by a\r\ngang of merry roistering devils, frisking and curveting on a flat rock,\r\nwhich projected into the river, and which is called the Duyvel's\r\nDans-Kamer to this very day. But no! Diedrich Knickerbocker, it becomes\r\nthee not to idle thus in thy historic wayfaring.\r\n\r\nRecollect, that while dwelling with the fond garrulity of age over these\r\nfairy scenes, endeared to thee by the recollections of thy youth, and the\r\ncharms of a thousand legendary tales, which beguiled the simple ear of thy\r\nchildhood--recollect that thou art trifling with those fleeting moments\r\nwhich should be devoted to loftier themes. Is not Time, relentless Time!\r\nshaking, with palsied hand, his almost exhausted hour-glass before\r\nthee?--hasten then to pursue thy weary task, lest the last sands be run\r\nere thou hast finished thy history of the Manhattoes.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, commit the dauntless Peter, his brave galley, and his loyal\r\ncrew, to the protection of the blessed St. Nicholas, who, I have no doubt,\r\nwill prosper him in his voyage, while we await his return at the great\r\ncity of New Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [49] The learned Hans Megapolonsis, treating of the country about\r\n        Albany, in a letter which was written some time after the\r\n        settlement thereof, says, \"There is in the river great plenty of\r\n        sturgeon, which we Christians do not make use of, but the Indians\r\n        eat them greedily.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile thus the enterprising Peter was coasting, with flowing sail, up the\r\nshores of the lordly Hudson, and arousing all the phlegmatic little Dutch\r\nsettlements upon its borders, a great and puissant concourse of warriors\r\nwas assembling at the city of New Amsterdam. And here that invaluable\r\nfragment of antiquity, the Stuyvesant manuscript, is more than commonly\r\nparticular; by which means I am enabled to record the illustrious host\r\nthat encamped itself in the public square in front of the fort, at present\r\ndenominated the Bowling Green.\r\n\r\nIn the center, then, was pitched the tent of the men of battle of the\r\nmanhattoes, who being the inmates of the metropolis, composed the\r\nlifeguards of the governor. These were commanded by the valiant Stoffel\r\nBrinkerhoff, who whilom had acquired such immortal fame at Oyster Bay;\r\nthey displayed as a standard a beaver rampant on a field of orange, being\r\nthe arms of the province, and denoting the persevering industry and the\r\namphibious origin of the Nederlanders.[50]\r\n\r\nOn their right hand might be seen the vassals of that renowned Mynheer,\r\nMichael Paw[51], who lorded it over the fair regions of ancient Pavonia,\r\nand the lands away south, even unto the Navesink Mountains,[52] and was,\r\nmoreover, patroon of Gibbet Island. His standard was borne by his trusty\r\nsquire, Cornelius Van Vorst, consisting of a huge oyster recumbent upon a\r\nsea-green field, being the armorial bearings of his favorite metropolis,\r\nCommunipaw. He brought to the camp a stout force of warriors, heavily\r\narmed, being each clad in ten pair of linsey-woolsey breeches, and\r\novershadowed by broad-brimmed beavers, with short pipes twisted in their\r\nhat-bands. These were the men who vegetated in the mud along the shores of\r\nPavonia, being of the race of genuine copper-heads, and were fabled to\r\nhave sprung from oysters.\r\n\r\nAt a little distance was encamped the tribe of warriors who came from the\r\nneighborhood of Hell-gate. These were commanded by the Suy Dams and the\r\nVan Dams, incontinent hard swearers, as their names betoken; they were\r\nterrible looking fellows, clad in broad-skirted gaberdines, of that\r\ncurious colored cloth called thunder and lightning, and bore as a standard\r\nthree devil's darning-needles, volant, in a flame-colored field.\r\n\r\nHard by was the tent of the men of battle from the marshy borders of the\r\nWaale-Boght[53] and the country thereabouts; these were of a sour aspect,\r\nby reason that they lived on crabs, which abound in these parts. They were\r\nthe first institutors of that honorable order of knighthood, called\r\nFlymarket shirks; and, if tradition speak true, did likewise introduce the\r\nfar-famed step in dancing, called \"double trouble.\" They were commanded by\r\nthe fearless Jacobus Varra Vanger, and had, moreover, a jolly band of\r\nBreuckelen[54] ferry-men, who performed a brave concerto on conch shells.\r\n\r\nBut I refrain from pursuing this minute description, which goes on to\r\ndescribe the warriors of Bloemen-dael, and Weehawk, and Hoboken, and\r\nsundry other places, well known in history and song--for now do the notes\r\nof martial music alarm the people of New Amsterdam, sounding afar from\r\nbeyond the walls of the city. But this alarm was in a little while\r\nrelieved; for, lo! from the midst of a vast cloud of dust, they recognized\r\nthe brimstone-colored breeches and splendid silver leg of Peter\r\nStuyvesant, glaring in the sunbeams; and beheld him approaching at the\r\nhead of a formidable army, which he had mustered along the banks of the\r\nHudson. And here the excellent but anonymous writer of the Stuyvesant\r\nmanuscript breaks out into a brave and glorious description of the forces,\r\nas they defiled through the principal gate of the city, that stood by the\r\nhead of Wall Street.\r\n\r\nFirst of all came the Van Brummels, who inhabit the pleasant borders of\r\nthe Bronx: these were short fat men, wearing exceeding large\r\ntrunk-breeches, and were renowned for feats of the trencher; they were the\r\nfirst inventors of suppawn, or mush and milk. Close in their rear marched\r\nthe Van Vlotens, or Kaats-kill, horrible quavers of new cider, and arrant\r\nbraggarts in their liquor. After them came the Van Pelts of Groodt Esopus,\r\ndexterous horsemen, mounted upon goodly switch-tailed steeds of the Esopus\r\nbreed; these were mighty hunters of minks and musk-rats, whence came the\r\nword Peltry. Then the Van Nests of Kinderhoeck, valiant robbers of birds'\r\nnests, as their name denotes; to these, if report may be believed, are we\r\nindebted for the invention of slap-jacks, or buckwheat cakes. Then the Van\r\nHigginbottoms, of Wapping's Creek; these came armed with ferrules and\r\nbirchen rods, being a race of schoolmasters, who first discovered the\r\nmarvelous sympathy between the seat of honor and the seat of intellect.\r\nThen the Van Grolls, of Antony's Nose, who carried their liquor in fair\r\nround little pottles, by reason they could not bouse it out of their\r\ncanteens, having such rare long noses. Then the Gardeniers, of Hudson and\r\nthereabouts, distinguished by many triumphant feats: such as robbing\r\nwater-melon patches, smoking rabbits out of their holes, and the like, and\r\nby being great lovers of roasted pigs' tails; these were the ancestors of\r\nthe renowned congressman of that name. Then the Van Hoesens, of Sing-Sing,\r\ngreat choristers and players upon the jewsharp; these marched two and two,\r\nsinging the great song of St. Nicholas. Then the Couenhovens of Sleepy\r\nHollow; these gave birth to a jolly race of publicans, who first\r\ndiscovered the magic artifice of conjuring a quart of wine into a pint\r\nbottle. Then the Van Kortlandts, who lived on the wild banks of the\r\nCroton, and were great killers of wild ducks, being much spoken of for\r\ntheir skill in shooting with the long bow. Then the Van Bunschotens, of\r\nNyack and Kakiat, who were the first that did ever kick with the left\r\nfoot; they were gallant bush-whackers and hunters of raccoons by\r\nmoonlight. Then the Van Winkles, of Haerlem, potent suckers of eggs, and\r\nnoted for running of horses, and running up of scores at taverns; they\r\nwere the first that ever winked with both eyes at once. Lastly came the\r\nKnickerbockers, of the great town of Schaghtikoke, where the folk lay\r\nstones upon the houses in windy weather, lest they should be blown away.\r\nThese derive their name, as some say, from Knicker, to shake, and Beker, a\r\ngoblet, indicating thereby that they were sturdy toss-pots of yore; but,\r\nin truth, it was derived from Knicker, to nod, and Boeken, books; plainly\r\nmeaning that they were great nodders or dozers over books; from them did\r\ndescend the writer of this history.\r\n\r\nSuch was the legion of sturdy bush-beaters that poured in at the grand\r\ngate of New Amsterdam; the Stuyvesant manuscript, indeed, speaks of many\r\nmore, whose names I omit to mention, seeing that it behooves me to hasten\r\nto matters of greater moment. Nothing could surpass the joy and martial\r\npride of the lion-hearted Peter as he reviewed this mighty host of\r\nwarriors, and he determined no longer to defer the gratification of his\r\nmuch-wished-for revenge upon the scoundrel Swedes at Fort Casimir.\r\n\r\nBut before I hasten to record those unmatchable events, which will be\r\nfound in the sequel of this faithful history, let us pause to notice the\r\nfate of Jacobus Van Poffenburgh, the discomfited commander-in-chief of the\r\narmies of the New Netherlands. Such is the inherent uncharitableness of\r\nhuman nature that scarcely did the news become public of his deplorable\r\ndiscomfiture at Fort Casimir, than a thousand scurvy rumors were set\r\nafloat in New Amsterdam, wherein it was insinuated that he had in reality\r\na treacherous understanding with the Swedish commander; that he had long\r\nbeen in the practice of privately communicating with the Swedes; together\r\nwith divers hints about \"secret service money.\" To all which deadly\r\ncharges I do not give a jot more credit than I think they deserve.\r\n\r\nCertain it is that the general vindicated his character by the most\r\nvehement oaths and protestations, and put every man out of the ranks of\r\nhonor who dared to doubt his integrity. Moreover, on returning to New\r\nAmsterdam, he paraded up and down the streets with a crew of hard swearers\r\nat his heels--sturdy bottle companions, whom he gorged and fattened, and\r\nwho were ready to bolster him through all the courts of justice--heroes of\r\nhis own kidney, fierce-whiskered, broad-shouldered, colbrand-looking\r\nswaggerers--not one of whom but looked as though he could eat up an ox,\r\nand pick his teeth with the horns. These lifeguard men quarreled all his\r\nquarrels, were ready to fight all his battles, and scowled at every man\r\nthat turned up his nose at the general, as though they would devour him\r\nalive. Their conversation was interspersed with oaths like minute-guns,\r\nand every bombastic rhodomontade was rounded off by a thundering\r\nexecration, like a patriotic toast honored with a discharge of artillery.\r\n\r\nAll these valorous vaporings had a considerable effect in convincing\r\ncertain profound sages, who began to think the general a hero, of\r\nunmatchable loftiness and magnanimity of soul; particularly as he was\r\ncontinually protesting on the honor of a soldier--a marvelously\r\nhigh-sounding asseveration. Nay, one of the members of the council went so\r\nfar as to propose they should immortalise him by an imperishable statue of\r\nplaster of Paris.\r\n\r\nBut the vigilant Peter the Headstrong was not thus to be deceived. Sending\r\nprivately for the commander-in-chief of all the armies, and having heard\r\nall his story, garnished with the customary pious oaths, protestations,\r\nand ejaculations--\"Harkee, comrade,\" cried he, \"though by your own\r\naccount you are the most brave, upright, and honorable man in the whole\r\nprovince, yet do you lie under the misfortune of being damnably traduced,\r\nand immeasurably despised. Now, though it is certainly hard to punish a\r\nman for his misfortunes, and though it is very possible you are totally\r\ninnocent of the crimes laid to your charge; yet as heaven, doubtless for\r\nsome wise purpose, sees fit at present to withhold all proofs of your\r\ninnocence, far be it from me to counteract its sovereign will. Besides, I\r\ncannot consent to venture my armies with a commander whom they despise,\r\nnor to trust the welfare of my people to a champion whom they distrust.\r\nRetire therefore, my friend, from the irksome toils and cares of public\r\nlife, with this comforting reflection--that if guilty, you are but\r\nenjoying your just reward--and if innocent, you are not the first great\r\nand good man who has most wrongfully been slandered and maltreated in this\r\nwicked world--doubtless to be better treated in a better world, where\r\nthere shall be neither error, calumny, nor persecution. In the meantime,\r\nlet me never see your face again, for I have a horrible antipathy to the\r\ncountenances of unfortunate great men like yourself.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [50] This was likewise a great seal of the New Netherlands, as\r\n        may still be seen in ancient records.\r\n\r\n   [51] Besides what is related in the Stuyvesant MS., I have found\r\n        mention made of this illustrious patroon in another manuscript,\r\n        which says, \"De Heer (or the squire) Michael Paw, a Dutch\r\n        subject, about 10th Aug., 1630, by deed purchased Staten Island.\r\n        N.B.--The same Michael Paw had what the Dutch call a colonie at\r\n        Pavonia, on the Jersey shore, opposite New York: and his\r\n        overseer, in 1636, was named Corns. Van Vorst, a person of the\r\n        same name, in 1769, owned Pawles Hook, and a large farm at\r\n        Pavonia, and is a lineal descendant from Van Vorst.\"\r\n\r\n   [52] So called from the Navesink tribe of Indians that inhabited\r\n        these parts. At present they are erroneously denominated the\r\n        Neversink, or Neversunk, mountains.\r\n\r\n   [53] Since corrupted into the Wallabout, the bay where the\r\n        navy-yard is situated.\r\n\r\n   [54] Now spelt Brooklyn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs my readers and myself are about entering on as many perils as ever a\r\nconfederacy of meddlesome knights-errant wilfully ran their heads into it\r\nis meet that, like those hardy adventurers, we should join hands, bury all\r\ndifferences, and swear to stand by one another, in weal or woe, to the end\r\nof the enterprise. My readers must doubtless perceive how completely I\r\nhave altered my tone and deportment since we first set out together. I\r\nwarrant they then thought me a crabbed, cynical, impertinent little son of\r\na Dutchman; for I scarcely ever gave them a civil word, nor so much as\r\ntouched my beaver, when I had occasion to address them. But as we jogged\r\nalong together on the high road of my history, I gradually began to relax,\r\nto grow more courteous, and occasionally to enter into familiar discourse,\r\nuntil at length I came to conceive a most social, companionable kind of\r\nregard for them. This is just my way--I am always a little cold and\r\nreserved at first, particularly to people whom I neither know nor care for\r\nand am only to be completely won by long intimacy.\r\n\r\nBesides, why should I have been sociable to the crowd of how-d'ye-do\r\nacquaintances that flocked around me at my first appearance? Many were\r\nmerely attracted by a new face; and having stared me full in the title\r\npage walked off without saying a word; while others lingered yawningly\r\nthrough the preface, and, having gratified their short-lived curiosity,\r\nsoon dropped off one by one, but more especially to try their mettle, I\r\nhad recourse to an expedient, similar to one which, we are told, was used\r\nby that peerless flower of chivalry, King Arthur; who, before he admitted\r\nany knight to his intimacy, first required that he should show himself\r\nsuperior to danger or hardships, by encountering unheard-of mishaps,\r\nslaying some dozen giants, vanquishing wicked enchanters, not to say a\r\nword of dwarfs, hippogriffs, and fiery dragons. On a similar principle did\r\nI cunningly lead my readers, at the first sally, into two or three knotty\r\nchapters, where they were most woefully belabored and buffeted by a host\r\nof pagan philosophers and infidel writers. Though naturally a very grave\r\nman, yet could I scarce refrain from smiling outright at seeing the utter\r\nconfusion and dismay of my valiant cavaliers. Some dropped down dead\r\n(asleep) on the field; others threw down my book in the middle of the\r\nfirst chapter, took to their heels, and never ceased scampering until they\r\nhad fairly run it out of sight; when they stopped to take breath, to tell\r\ntheir friends what troubles they had undergone, and to warn all others\r\nfrom venturing on so thankless an expedition. Every page thinned my ranks\r\nmore and more; and of the vast multitude that first set out, but a\r\ncomparatively few made shift to survive, in exceedingly battered\r\ncondition, through the five introductory chapters.\r\n\r\nWhat, then! would you have had me take such sunshine, faint-hearted\r\nrecreants to my bosom at our first acquaintance? No--no; I reserved my\r\nfriendship for those who deserved it, for those who undauntedly bore me\r\ncompany, in despite of difficulties, dangers, and fatigues. And now, as to\r\nthose who adhere to me at present, I take them affectionately by the hand.\r\nWorthy and thrice-beloved readers! brave and well-tried comrades! who have\r\nfaithfully followed my footsteps through all my wanderings--I salute you\r\nfrom my heart--I pledge myself to stand by you to the last; and to conduct\r\nyou (so Heaven speed this trusty weapon which I now hold between my\r\nfingers) triumphantly to the end of this our stupendous undertaking.\r\n\r\nBut, hark! while we are thus talking, the city of New Amsterdam is in a\r\nbustle. The host of warriors encamped in the Bowling Green are striking\r\ntheir tents; the brazen trumpet of Antony Van Corlear makes the welkin to\r\nresound with portentous clangour--the drums beat--the standards of the\r\nManhattoes, of Hell-gate, and of Michael Paw wave proudly in the air. And\r\nnow behold where the mariners are busily employed, hoisting the sails of\r\nyon topsail schooner and those clump-built sloops which are to waft the\r\narmy of the Nederlanders to gather immortal honors on the Delaware!\r\n\r\nThe entire population of the city, man, woman, and child, turned out to\r\nbehold the chivalry of New Amsterdam, as it paraded the streets previous\r\nto embarkation. Many a handkerchief was waved out of the windows, many a\r\nfair nose was blown in melodious sorrow on the mournful occasion. The\r\ngrief of the fair dames and beauteous damsels of Grenada could not have\r\nbeen more vociferous on the banishment of the gallant tribe of\r\nAbencerrages than was that of the kind-hearted fair ones of New Amsterdam\r\non the departure of their intrepid warriors. Every love-sick maiden fondly\r\ncrammed the pockets of her hero with gingerbread and doughnuts; many a\r\ncopper ring was exchanged, and crooked sixpence broken, in pledge of\r\neternal constancy: and there remain extant to this day some love verses\r\nwritten on that occasion, sufficiently crabbed and incomprehensible to\r\nconfound the whole universe.\r\n\r\nBut it was a moving sight to see the buxom lasses how they hung about the\r\ndoughty Antony Van Corlear; for he was a jolly, rosy-faced, lusty\r\nbachelor, fond of his joke, and withall a desperate rogue among the women.\r\nFain would they have kept him to comfort them while the army was away, for\r\nbesides what I have said of him, it is no more than justice to add that he\r\nwas a kind-hearted soul, noted for his benevolent attentions in comforting\r\ndisconsolate wives during the absence of their husbands; and this made him\r\nto be very much regarded by the honest burghers of the city. But nothing\r\ncould keep the valiant Antony from following the heels of the old\r\ngovernor, whom he loved as he did his very soul: so embracing all the\r\nyoung vrouws, and giving every one of them, that had good teeth and rosy\r\nlips, a dozen hearty smacks, he departed, loaded with their kind wishes.\r\n\r\nNor was the departure of the gallant Peter among the least causes of\r\npublic distress. Though the old governor was by no means indulgent to the\r\nfollies and waywardness of his subjects, yet somehow or other he had\r\nbecome strangely popular among the people. There is something so\r\ncaptivating in personal bravery that, with the common mass of mankind, it\r\ntakes the lead of most other merits. The simple folk of New Amsterdam\r\nlooked upon Peter Stuyvesant as a prodigy of valor. His wooden leg, that\r\ntrophy of his martial encounters, was regarded with reverence and\r\nadmiration. Every old burgher had a budget of miraculous stories to tell\r\nabout the exploits of Hardkoppig Piet, wherewith he regaled his children\r\nof a long winter night, and on which he dwelt with as much delight and\r\nexaggeration as do our honest country yeomen on the hardy adventures of\r\nold General Putnam (or, as he is familiarly termed, Old Put) during our\r\nglorious revolution.\r\n\r\nNot an individual but verily believed the old governor was a match for\r\nBeelzebub himself; and there was even a story told, with great mystery,\r\nand under the rose, of his having shot the devil with a silver bullet one\r\ndark stormy night as he was sailing in a canoe through Hell-gate; but this\r\nI do not record as being an absolute fact. Perish the man who would let\r\nfall a drop to discolor the pure stream of history!\r\n\r\nCertain it is, not an old woman in New Amsterdam but considered Peter\r\nStuyvesant as a tower of strength, and rested satisfied that the public\r\nwelfare was secure, so long as he was in the city. It is not surprising,\r\nthen, that they looked upon his departure as a sore affliction. With heavy\r\nhearts they dragged at the heels of his troop, as they marched down to the\r\nriverside to embark. The governor from the stern of his schooner gave a\r\nshort but truly patriarchal address to his citizens, wherein he\r\nrecommended them to comport like loyal and peaceable subjects--to go to\r\nchurch regularly on Sundays, and to mind their business all the week\r\nbesides. That the women should be dutiful and affectionate to their\r\nhusbands--looking after nobody's concerns but their own, eschewing all\r\ngossipings and morning gaddings, and carrying short tongues and long\r\npetticoats. That the men should abstain from intermeddling in public\r\nconcerns, intrusting the cares of government to the officers appointed to\r\nsupport them--staying at home, like good citizens, making money for\r\nthemselves, and getting children for the benefit of the country. That the\r\nburgomasters should look well to the public interest--not oppressing the\r\npoor nor indulging the rich--not tasking their ingenuity to devise new\r\nlaws, but faithfully enforcing those which were already made--rather\r\nbending their attention to prevent evil than to punish it; ever\r\nrecollecting that civil magistrates should consider themselves more as\r\nguardians of public morals than ratcatchers, employed to entrap public\r\ndelinquents. Finally, he exhorted them, one and all, high and low, rich\r\nand poor, to conduct themselves as well as they could, assuring them that\r\nif they faithfully and conscientiously complied with this golden rule,\r\nthere was no danger but that they would all conduct themselves well\r\nenough. This done, he gave them a paternal benediction, the sturdy Anthony\r\nsounded a most loving farewell with his trumpet, the jolly crews put up a\r\nshout of triumph, and the invincible armada swept off proudly down the\r\nbay.\r\n\r\nThe good people of New Amsterdam crowded down to the Battery--that blest\r\nresort, from whence so many a tender prayer has been wafted, so many a\r\nfair hand waved, so many a tearful look been cast by love-sick damsel,\r\nafter the lessening barque, bearing her adventurous swain to distant\r\nclimes! Here the populace watched with straining eyes the gallant\r\nsquadron, as it slowly floated down the bay, and when the intervening land\r\nat the Narrows shut it from their sight, gradually dispersed with silent\r\ntongues and downcast countenances.\r\n\r\nA heavy gloom hung over the late bustling city; the honest burghers smoked\r\ntheir pipes in profound thoughtfulness, casting many a wistful look to the\r\nweathercock on the church of St. Nicholas; and all the old women, having\r\nno longer the presence of Peter Stuyvesant to hearten them, gathered their\r\nchildren home, and barricaded the doors and windows every evening at sun\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the armada of the sturdy Peter proceeded prosperously on\r\nits voyage, and after encountering about as many storms, and waterspouts,\r\nand whales, and other horrors and phenomena, as generally befall\r\nadventurous landsmen in perilous voyages of the kind; and after undergoing\r\na severe scouring from that deplorable and unpitied malady, called\r\nsea-sickness, the whole squadron arrived safely in the Delaware.\r\n\r\nWithout so much as dropping anchor, and giving his wearied ships time to\r\nbreathe, after laboring so long on the ocean, the intrepid Peter pursued\r\nhis course up the Delaware, and made a sudden appearance before Fort\r\nCasimir. Having summoned the astonished garrison by a terrific blast from\r\nthe trumpet of the long-winded Van Corlear, he demanded, in a tone of\r\nthunder, an instant surrender of the fort. To this demand, Suen Skytte,\r\nthe wind-dried commandant, replied in a shrill, whiffling voice, which, by\r\nreason of his extreme spareness, sounded like the wind whistling through a\r\nbroken bellows--\"that he had no very strong reason for refusing, except\r\nthat the demand was particularly disagreeable, as he had been ordered to\r\nmaintain his post to the last extremity.\" He requested time, therefore, to\r\nconsult with Governor Risingh, and proposed a truce for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe choleric Peter, indignant at having his rightful fort so treacherously\r\ntaken from him, and thus pertinaciously withheld, refused the proposed\r\narmistice, and swore by the pipe of St. Nicholas, which, like the sacred\r\nfire, was never extinguished, that unless the fort were surrendered in ten\r\nminutes, he would incontinently storm the works, make all the garrison run\r\nthe gauntlet, and split their scoundrel of a commander like a pickled\r\nshad. To give this menace the greater effect, he drew forth his trusty\r\nsword, and shook it at them with such a fierce and vigorous motion that\r\ndoubtless, if it had not been exceeding rusty, it would have lightened\r\nterror into the eyes and hearts of the enemy. He then ordered his men to\r\nbring a broadside to bear upon the fort, consisting of two swivels, three\r\nmuskets, a long duck fowling-piece, and two braces of horse-pistols.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the sturdy Van Corlear marshaled all his forces, and\r\ncommenced his warlike operations. Distending his cheeks like a very\r\nBoreas, he kept up a most horrific twanging of his trumpet--the lusty\r\nchoristers of Sing-Sing broke forth into a hideous song of battle--the\r\nwarriors of Breuckelen and the Wallabout blew a potent and astounding\r\nblast on their conch shells, altogether forming as outrageous a concerto\r\nas though five thousand French fiddlers were displaying their skill in a\r\nmodern overture.\r\n\r\nWhether the formidable front of war thus suddenly presented smote the\r\ngarrison with sore dismay--or whether the concluding terms of the summons,\r\nwhich mentioned that he should surrender \"at discretion,\" were mistaken by\r\nSuen Skytte, who, though a Swede, was a very considerate, easy-tempered\r\nman, as a compliment to his discretion, I will not take upon me to say;\r\ncertain it is he found it impossible to resist so courteous a demand.\r\nAccordingly, in the very nick of time, just as the cabin-boy had gone\r\nafter a coal of fire to discharge the swivel, a chamade was beat on the\r\nrampart by the only drum in the garrison, to the no small satisfaction of\r\nboth parties; who, not withstanding their great stomach for fighting, had\r\nfull as good an inclination to eat a quiet dinner as to exchange black\r\neyes and bloody noses.\r\n\r\nThus did this impregnable fortress once more return to the domination of\r\ntheir High Mightinesses; Skytte and his garrison of twenty men were\r\nallowed to march out with the honors of war; and the victorious Peter, who\r\nwas as generous as brave, permitted them to keep possession of all their\r\narms and ammunition--the same on inspection being found totally unfit for\r\nservice, having long rusted in the magazine of the fortress, even before\r\nit was wrested by the Swedes from the windy Van Poffenburgh. But I must\r\nnot omit to mention that the governor was so well pleased with the service\r\nof his faithful squire Van Corlear, in the reduction of this great\r\nfortress, that he made him on the spot lord of a goodly domain in the\r\nvicinity of New Amsterdam, which goes by the name of Corlear's Hook unto\r\nthis very day.\r\n\r\nThe unexampled liberality of Peter Stuyvesant towards the Swedes\r\noccasioned great surprise in the city of New Amsterdam; nay, certain\r\nfactious individuals, who had been enlightened by political meetings in\r\nthe days of William the Testy, but who had not dared to indulge their\r\nmeddlesome habits under the eye of their present ruler, now emboldened by\r\nhis absence, gave vent to their censures in the street. Murmurs were heard\r\nin the very council-chamber of New Amsterdam; and there is no knowing\r\nwhether they might not have broken out into downright speeches and\r\ninvectives, had not Peter Stuyvesant privately sent home his walking-stick\r\nto be laid as a mace on the table of the council-chamber, in the midst of\r\nhis counsellors, who, like wise men, took the hint, and for ever after\r\nheld their peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike as a mighty alderman, when at a corporation feast the first spoonful\r\nof turtle-soup salutes his palate, feels his appetite but tenfold\r\nquickened, and redoubles his vigorous attacks upon the tureen, while his\r\nprojecting eyes rolled greedily round, devouring everything at table; so\r\ndid the mettlesome Peter Stuyvesant feel that hunger for martial glory,\r\nwhich raged within his bowels, inflamed by the capture of Fort Casimir,\r\nand nothing could allay it but the conquest of all New Sweden. No sooner,\r\ntherefore, had he secured his conquest than he stumped resolutely on,\r\nflushed with success, to gather fresh laurels at Fort Christina.[55]\r\n\r\nThis was the grand Swedish post, established on a small river (or, as it\r\nis improperly termed, creek) of the same name; and here that crafty\r\ngovernor Jan Risingh lay grimly drawn up, like a grey-bearded spider in\r\nthe citadel of his web.\r\n\r\nBut before we hurry into the direful scenes which must attend the meeting\r\nof two such potent chieftains, it is advisable to pause for a moment, and\r\nhold a kind of warlike council. Battles should not be rushed into\r\nprecipitately by the historian and his readers, any more than by the\r\ngeneral and his soldiers. The great commanders of antiquity never engaged\r\nthe enemy without previously preparing the minds of their followers by\r\nanimating harangues; spiriting them up to heroic deeds, assuring them of\r\nthe protection of the gods, and inspiring them with a confidence in the\r\nprowess of their leaders. So the historian should awaken the attention and\r\nenlist the passions of his readers; and having set them all on fire with\r\nthe importance of his subject, he should put himself at their head,\r\nflourish his pen, and lead them on to the thickest of the fight.\r\n\r\nAn illustrious example of this rule may be seen in that mirror of\r\nhistorians, the immortal Thucydides. Having arrived at the breaking out of\r\nthe Peloponnesian War, one of his commentators observes that \"he sounds\r\nthat charge in all the disposition and spirit of Homer. He catalogues the\r\nallies on both sides. He awakens our expectations, and fast engages our\r\nattention. All mankind are concerned in the important point now going to\r\nbe decided. Endeavors are made to disclose futurity. Heaven itself is\r\ninterested in the dispute. The earth totters, and nature seems to labor\r\nwith the great event. This is his solemn, sublime manner of setting out.\r\nThus he magnifies a war between two, as Rapin styles them, petty states;\r\nand thus artfully he supports a little subject by treating it in a great\r\nand noble method.\"\r\n\r\nIn like manner, having conducted my readers into the very teeth of peril:\r\nhaving followed the adventurous Peter and his band into foreign regions,\r\nsurrounded by foes, and stunned by the horrid din of arms, at this\r\nimportant moment, while darkness and doubt hang o'er each coming chapter,\r\nI hold it meet to harangue them, and prepare them for the events that are\r\nto follow.\r\n\r\nAnd here I would premise one great advantage, which, as historian, I\r\npossess over my reader; and this it is, that though I cannot save the life\r\nof my favorite hero, nor absolutely contradict the event of a battle (both\r\nwhich liberties, though often taken by the French writers of the present\r\nreign, I hold to be utterly unworthy of a scrupulous historian), yet I can\r\nnow and then make him bestow on his enemy a sturdy back stroke sufficient\r\nto fell a giant; though, in honest truth, he may never have done anything\r\nof the kind; or I can drive his antagonist clear round and round the\r\nfield, as did Homer make that fine fellow Hector scamper like a poltroon\r\nround the walls of Troy; for which, if ever they have encountered one\r\nanother in the Elysian Fields, I'll warrant the prince of poets has had to\r\nmake the most humble apology.\r\n\r\nI am aware that many conscientious readers will be ready to cry out, \"foul\r\nplay!\" whenever I render a little assistance to my hero; but I consider it\r\none of those privileges exercised by historians of all ages, and one which\r\nhas never been disputed. An historian is in fact, as it were, bound in\r\nhonor to stand by his hero--the fame of the latter is intrusted to his\r\nhands, and it is his duty to do the best by it he can. Never was there a\r\ngeneral, an admiral, or any other commander, who, in giving an account of\r\nany battle he had fought, did not sorely belabor the enemy; and I have no\r\ndoubt that, had my heroes written the history of their own achievements,\r\nthey would have dealt much harder blows than any that I shall recount.\r\nStanding forth, therefore, as the guardian of their fame, it behoves me to\r\ndo them the same justice they would have done themselves; and if I happen\r\nto be a little hard upon the Swedes, I give free leave to any of their\r\ndescendants, who may write a history of the State of Delaware, to take\r\nfair retaliation, and belabor Peter Stuyvesant as hard as they please.\r\n\r\nTherefore stand by for broken heads and bloody noses! My pen hath long\r\nitched for a battle--siege after siege have I carried on without blows or\r\nbloodshed; but now I have at length got a chance, and I vow to Heaven and\r\nSt. Nicholas that, let the chronicles of the times say what they please,\r\nneither Sallust, Livy, Tacitus, Polybius, nor any other historian did ever\r\nrecord a fiercer fight than that in which my valiant chieftains are now\r\nabout to engage.\r\n\r\nAnd you, O most excellent readers, whom, for your faithful adherence, I\r\ncould cherish in the warmest corner of my heart, be not uneasy--trust the\r\nfate of our favorite Stuyvesant with me; for by the rood, come what may,\r\nI'll stick by Hardkoppig Piet to the last. I'll make him drive about these\r\nlosels vile, as did the renowned Launcelot of the Lake a herd of recreant\r\nCornish knights; and if he does fall, let me never draw my pen to fight\r\nanother battle in behalf of a brave man, if I don't make these lubberly\r\nSwedes pay for it.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had Peter Stuyvesant arrived before Forth Christina, than he\r\nproceeded without delay to entrench himself, and immediately on running\r\nhis first parallel, dispatched Antony Van Corlear to summon the fortress\r\nto surrender. Van Corlear was received with all due formality, hoodwinked\r\nat the portal, and conducted through a pestiferous smell of salt fish and\r\nonions to the citadel, a substantial hut built of pine logs. His eyes were\r\nhere uncovered, and he found himself in the august presence of Governor\r\nRisingh. This chieftain, as I have before noted, was a very giantly man,\r\nand was clad in a coarse blue coat, strapped round the waist with a\r\nleathern belt, which caused the enormous skirts and pockets to set off\r\nwith a very warlike sweep. His ponderous legs were cased in a pair of\r\nfoxy-colored jack-boots, and he was straddling in the attitude of the\r\nColossus of Rhodes, before a bit of broken looking-glass, shaving himself\r\nwith a villainously dull razor. This afflicting operation caused him to\r\nmake a series of horrible grimaces, which heightened exceedingly the\r\ngrisly terrors of his visage. On Antony Van Corlear's being announced, the\r\ngrim commander paused for a moment, in the midst of one of his most\r\nhard-favored contortions, and after eyeing him askance over the shoulder,\r\nwith a kind of snarling grin on his countenance, resumed his labors at the\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nThis iron harvest being reaped, he turned once more to the trumpeter, and\r\ndemanded the purport of his errand. Antony Van Corlear delivered in a few\r\nwords, being a kind of short-hand speaker, a long message from his\r\nexcellency, recounting the whole history of the province, with a\r\nrecapitulation of grievances, and enumeration of claims, and concluding\r\nwith a peremptory demand of instant surrender; which done, he turned\r\naside, took his nose between his thumb and finger, and blew a tremendous\r\nblast, not unlike the flourish of a trumpet of defiance, which it had\r\ndoubtless learned from a long and intimate neighborhood with that\r\nmelodious instrument.\r\n\r\nGovernor Risingh heard him through trumpet and all, but with infinite\r\nimpatience; leaning at times, as was his usual custom, on the pommel of\r\nhis sword, and at times twirling a huge steel watch-chain, or snapping\r\nhis fingers. Van Corlear having finished, he bluntly replied, that Peter\r\nStuyvesant and his summons might go to the d----, whither he hoped to send\r\nhim and his crew of ragamuffins before supper time. Then unsheathing his\r\nbrass-hilted sword, and throwing away the scabbard, \"'Fore gad,\" quoth he,\r\n\"but I will not sheathe thee again until I make a scabbard of the\r\nsmoke-dried leathern hide of this runagate Dutchman.\" Then having flung a\r\nfierce defiance in the teeth of his adversary, by the lips of his\r\nmessenger, the latter was reconducted to the portal, with all the\r\nceremonious civility due to the trumpeter, squire, and ambassador, of so\r\ngreat a commander; and being again unblinded, was courteously dismissed\r\nwith a tweak of the nose, to assist him in recollecting his message.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the gallant Peter receive this insolent reply, than he let\r\nfly a tremendous volley of red-hot execrations, which would infallibly\r\nhave battered down the fortifications, and blown up the powder magazine\r\nabout the ears of the fiery Swede had not the ramparts been remarkably\r\nstrong, and the magazine bomb proof. Perceiving that the works withstood\r\nthis terrific blast, and that it was utterly impossible, as it really was\r\nin those unphilosophic days, to carry on a war with words, he ordered his\r\nmerry men all to prepare for an immediate assault. But here a strange\r\nmurmur broke out among his troops, beginning with the tribe of the Van\r\nBummels, those valiant trenchermen of the Bronx, and spreading from man to\r\nman, accompanied with certain mutinous looks and discontented murmurs. For\r\nonce in his life, and only for once, did the great Peter turn pale; for he\r\nverily thought his warriors were going to falter in this hour of perilous\r\ntrial, and thus to tarnish forever the fame of the province of New\r\nNetherlands.\r\n\r\nBut soon did he discover, to his great joy, that in this suspicion he\r\ndeeply wronged this most undaunted army; for the cause of this agitation\r\nand uneasiness simply was that the hour of dinner was at hand, and it\r\nwould almost have broken the hearts of these regular Dutch warriors to\r\nhave broken in upon the invariable routine of their habits. Besides, it\r\nwas an established rule among our ancestors always to fight upon a full\r\nstomach, and to this may be doubtless attributed the circumstance that\r\nthey came to be so renowned in arms.\r\n\r\nAnd now are the hearty men of the Manhattoes, and their no less hearty\r\ncomrades, all lustily engaged under the trees, buffeting stoutly with the\r\ncontents of their wallets, and taking such affectionate embraces of their\r\ncanteens and pottles as though they verily believed they were to be the\r\nlast. And as I foresee we shall have hot work in a page or two, I advise\r\nmy readers to do the same, for which purpose I will bring this chapter to\r\na close; giving them my word of honor that no advantage shall be taken of\r\nthis armistice to surprise, or in anywise molest the honest Nederlanders\r\nwhile at their vigorous repast.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [55] At present a flourishing town, called Christiana, or\r\n        Christeen, about thirty-seven miles from Philadelphia, on the\r\n        post road to Baltimore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Now had the Dutchmen snatched a huge repast,\" and finding themselves\r\nwonderfully encouraged and animated thereby, prepared to take the field.\r\nExpectation, says the writer of the Stuyvesant manuscript, expectation now\r\nstood on stilts. The world forgot to turn round, or rather stood still,\r\nthat it might witness the affray, like a round-bellied alderman watching\r\nthe combat of two chivalrous flies upon his jerkin. The eyes of all\r\nmankind, as usual in such cases, were turned upon Fort Cristina. The sun,\r\nlike a little man in a crowd at a puppet-show, scampered about the\r\nheavens, popping his head here and there, and endeavoring to get a peep\r\nbetween the unmannerly clouds that obtruded themselves in his way. The\r\nhistorians filled their inkhorns; the poets went without their dinners,\r\neither that they might buy paper and goose-quills, or because they could\r\nnot get anything to eat. Antiquity scowled sulkily out of its grave to see\r\nitself outdone; while even Posterity stood mute, gazing in gaping ecstasy\r\nof retrospection on the eventful field.\r\n\r\nThe immortal deities, who whilom had seen service at the \"affair\" of Troy,\r\nnow mounted their feather-bed clouds, and sailed over the plain, or\r\nmingled among the combatants in different disguises, all itching to have a\r\nfinger in the pie. Jupiter sent off his thunderbolt to a noted coppersmith\r\nto have it furbished up for the direful occasion. Venus vowed by her\r\nchastity to patronize the Swedes, and in semblance of a blear-eyed trull\r\nparaded the battlements of Fort Christina, accompanied by Diana, as a\r\nsergeant's widow, of cracked reputation. The noted bully Mars stuck two\r\nhorse-pistols into his belt, shouldered a rusty firelock, and gallantly\r\nswaggered at their elbow as a drunken corporal, while Apollo trudged in\r\ntheir rear as a bandy-legged fifer, playing most villainously out of tune.\r\n\r\nOn the other side the ox-eyed Juno, who had gained a pair of black eyes\r\nover night, in one of her curtain lectures with old Jupiter, displayed her\r\nhaughty beauties on a baggage wagon; Minerva, as a brawny gin-suttler,\r\ntacked up her skirts, brandished her fists, and swore most heroically, in\r\nexceeding bad Dutch, (having but lately studied the language), by way of\r\nkeeping up the spirits of the soldiers; while Vulcan halted as a\r\nclub-footed blacksmith, lately promoted to be a captain of militia. All\r\nwas silent awe or bustling preparation, war reared his horrid front,\r\ngnashed loud his iron fangs, and shook his direful crest of bristling\r\nbayonets.\r\n\r\nAnd now the mighty chieftains marshaled out their hosts. Here stood stout\r\nRisingh, firm as a thousand rocks, incrusted with stockades and in\r\ntrenched to the chin in mud batteries. His valiant soldiery lined the\r\nbreastwork in grim array, each having his mustachios fiercely greased, and\r\nhis hair pomatumed back, and queued so stiffly, that he grinned above the\r\nramparts like a grisly death's head.\r\n\r\nThere came on the intrepid Peter, his brows knit, his teeth set, his fists\r\nclenched, almost breathing forth volumes of smoke, so fierce was the fire\r\nthat raged within his bosom. His faithful squire Van Corlear trudged\r\nvaliantly at his heels, with his trumpet gorgeously bedecked with red and\r\nyellow ribands, the remembrances of his fair mistresses at the Manhattoes.\r\nThen came waddling on the sturdy chivalry of the Hudson. There were the\r\nVan Wycks, and the Van Dycks, and the Ten Eycks; the Van Nesses, the Van\r\nTassels, the Van Grolls; the Van Hoesens, the Van Giesons, and the Van\r\nBlarcoms; the Van Warts, the Van Winkles, the Van Dams; the Van Pelts, the\r\nVan Rippers, and the Van Brunts. There were the Van Hornes, the Van Hooks,\r\nthe Van Bunschotens; the Van Gelders, the Van Arsdales, and the Van\r\nBummels; the Vander Belts, the Vander Hoofs, the Vander Voorts, the Vander\r\nLyns, the Vander Pools, and the Vander Spiegles; there came the Hoffmans,\r\nthe Hooglands, the Hoppers, the Cloppers, the Ryckmans, the Dyckmans, the\r\nHogebooms, the Rosebooms, the Oothouts, the Quackenbosses, the Roerbacks,\r\nthe Garrebrantzes, the Bensons, the Brouwers, the Waldrons, the\r\nOnderdonks, the Varra Vangers, the Schermerhorns, the Stoutenburghs, the\r\nBrinkerhoffs, the Bontecous, the Knickerbockers, the Hockstrassers, the Ten\r\nBreecheses, and the Tough Breecheses, with a host more of worthies, whose\r\nnames are too crabbed to be written, or if they could be written, it would\r\nbe impossible for man to utter--all fortified with a mighty dinner, and,\r\nto use the words of a great Dutch poet,\r\n\r\n    \"Brimful of wrath and cabbage.\"\r\n\r\nFor an instant the mighty Peter paused in the midst of his career, and\r\nmounting on a stump, addressed his troops in eloquent Low Dutch, exhorting\r\nthem to fight like _duyvels_, and assuring them that if they conquered,\r\nthey should get plenty of booty; if they fell, they should be allowed the\r\nsatisfaction, while dying, of reflecting that it was in the service of\r\ntheir country; and after they were dead, of seeing their names inscribed\r\nin the temple of renown, and handed down, in company with all the other\r\ngreat men of the year, for the admiration of posterity. Finally, he swore\r\nto them, on the word of a governor (and they knew him too well to doubt it\r\nfor a moment), that if he caught any mother's son of them looking pale, or\r\nplaying craven, he would curry his hide till he made him run out of it\r\nlike a snake in spring time. Then lugging out his trusty sabre, he\r\nbrandished it three times over his head, ordered Van Corlear to sound a\r\ncharge, and shouting the words, \"St. Nicholas and the Manhattoes!\"\r\ncourageously dashed forwards. His warlike followers, who had employed the\r\ninterval in lighting their pipes, instantly stuck them into their mouths,\r\ngave a furious puff, and charged gallantly under cover of the smoke.\r\n\r\nThe Swedish garrison, ordered by the cunning Risingh not to fire until\r\nthey could distinguish the whites of their assailants' eyes, stood in\r\nhorrid silence on the covert-way, until the eager Dutchmen had ascended\r\nthe glacis. Then did they pour into them such a tremendous volley that the\r\nvery hills quaked around, and were terrified even into an incontinence of\r\nwater, insomuch that certain springs burst forth from their sides, which\r\ncontinue to run unto the present day. Not a Dutchman but would have\r\nbitten the dust beneath that dreadful fire had not the protecting Minerva\r\nkindly taken care that the Swedes should, one and all, observe their usual\r\ncustom of shutting their eyes, and turning away their heads at the moment\r\nof discharge.\r\n\r\nThe Swedes followed up their fire by leaping the counterscarp, and falling\r\ntooth and nail upon the foe with furious outcries. And now might be seen\r\nprodigies of valor, unmatched in history or song. Here was the sturdy\r\nStoffel Brinkerhoff brandishing his quarter-staff like the giant Blanderon\r\nhis oak tree (for he scorned to carry any other weapon), and drumming a\r\nhorrific tune upon the hard heads of the Swedish soldiery. There were the\r\nVan Kortlandts, posted at a distance, like the Locrian archers of yore,\r\nand plying it most potently with the long-bow, for which they were so\r\njustly renowned. On a rising knoll were gathered the valiant men of\r\nSing-Sing, assisting marvellously in the fight, by chanting the great song\r\nof St. Nicholas; but as to the Gardeniers of Hudson, they were absent on a\r\nmarauding party, laying waste the neighboring water-melon patches.\r\n\r\nIn a different part of the field were the Van Grolls of Anthony's Nose,\r\nstruggling to get to the thickest of the fight, but horribly perplexed in\r\na defile between two hills, by reason of the length of their noses. So\r\nalso the Van Bunschotens of Nyack and Kakiat, so renowned for kicking with\r\nthe left foot, were brought to a stand for want of wind, in consequence of\r\nthe hearty dinner they had eaten, and would have been put to utter rout\r\nbut for the arrival of a gallant corps of voltigeurs, composed of the\r\nHoppers, who advanced nimbly to their assistance on one foot. Nor must I\r\nomit to mention the valiant achievements of Antony Van Corlear, who, for a\r\ngood quarter of an hour, waged stubborn fight with a little pursy Swedish\r\ndrummer, whose hide he drummed most magnificently, and whom he would\r\ninfallibly have annihilated on the spot, but that he had come into the\r\nbattle with no other weapon but his trumpet.\r\n\r\nBut now the combat thickened. On came the mighty Jacobus Varra Vanger and\r\nthe fighting men of the Wallabout; after them thundered the Van Pelts of\r\nEsopus, together with the Van Riepers and the Van Brunts, bearing down all\r\nbefore them; then the Suy Dams and the Van Dams, pressing forward with\r\nmany a blustering oath, at the head of the warriors of Hell-gate, clad in\r\ntheir thunder and lightning gaberdines; and, lastly, the standard-bearers\r\nand body-guards of Peter Stuyvesant, bearing the great beaver of the\r\nManhattoes.\r\n\r\nAnd now commenced the horrid din, the desperate struggle, the maddening\r\nferocity, the frantic desperation, the confusion, and self-abandonment of\r\nwar. Dutchman and Swede commingled, tugged, panted, and blowed. The\r\nheavens were darkened with a tempest of missives. Bang! went the guns;\r\nwhack! went the broad-swords! thump! went the cudgels; crash! went the\r\nmusket-strocks; blows, kicks, cuffs, scratches, black eyes, and bloody\r\nnoses swelling the horrors of the scene! Thick thwack, cut and hack,\r\nhelter skelter, higgledy-piggledy, hurly-burly, head over heels, rough and\r\ntumble! Dunder and blixum! swore the Dutchmen; splitter and splutter!\r\ncried the Swedes. Storm the works, shouted Hardkoppig Peter. Fire the\r\nmine, roared stout Risingh. Tanta-ra-ra-ra! twanged the trumpet of Antony\r\nVan Corlear, until all voice and sound became unintelligible; grunts of\r\npain, yells of fury, and shouts of triumph mingling in one hideous clamor.\r\nThe earth shook as if struck with a paralytic stroke; trees shrunk aghast,\r\nand withered at the sight; rocks burrowed in the ground like rabbits; and\r\neven Christina Creek turned from its course, and ran up a hill in\r\nbreathless terror!\r\n\r\nLong hung the contest doubtful; for though a heavy shower of rain, sent by\r\nthe \"cloud-compelling Jove,\" in some measure cooled their ardor, as doth\r\na bucket of water thrown on a group of fighting mastiffs, yet did they but\r\npause for a moment, to return with tenfold fury to the charge. Just at\r\nthis juncture a vast and dense column of smoke was seen slowly rolling\r\ntoward the scene of battle. The combatants paused for a moment, gazing in\r\nmute astonishment until the wind, dispelling the murky cloud, revealed the\r\nflaunting banner of Michael Paw, the patroon of Communipaw. That valiant\r\nchieftain came fearlessly on at the head of a phalanx of oyster-fed\r\nPavonians and a corps de reserve of the Van Arsdales and Van Bummels, who\r\nhad remained behind to digest the enormous dinner they had eaten. These\r\nnow trudged manfully forward, smoking their pipes with outrageous vigor,\r\nso as to raise the awful cloud that has been mentioned; but marching\r\nexceedingly slow, being short of leg, and of great rotundity in the belt.\r\n\r\nAnd now the deities who watched over the fortunes of the Nederlanders,\r\nhaving unthinkingly left the field and stepped into a neighboring tavern\r\nto refresh themselves with a pot of beer, a direful catastrophe had\r\nwell-night ensued. Scarce had the myrmidons of Michael Paw attained the\r\nfront of battle, when the Swedes, instructed by the cunning Risingh,\r\nlevelled a shower of blows full at their tobacco-pipes. Astounded at this\r\nassault, and dismayed at the havoc of their pipes, these ponderous\r\nwarriors gave way, and like a drove of frightened elephants, broke through\r\nthe ranks of their own army. The little Hoppers were borne down in the\r\nsurge; the sacred banner emblazoned with the gigantic oyster of Communipaw\r\nwas trampled in the dirt; on blundered and thundered the heavy-sterned\r\nfugitives, the Swedes pressing on their rear, and applying their feet _a\r\nparte poste_ of the Van Arsdales and the Van Bummels with a vigor that\r\nprodigiously accelerated their movements; nor did the renowned Michael Paw\r\nhimself fail to receive divers grievous and dishonorable visitations of\r\nshoe leather.\r\n\r\nBut what, O Muse! was the rage of Peter Stuyvesant, when from afar he saw\r\nhis army giving way! In the transports of his wrath he sent forth a roar,\r\nenough to shake the very hills. The men of the Manhattoes plucked up new\r\ncourage at the sound; or rather, they rallied at the voice of their\r\nleader, of whom they stood more in awe than of all the Swedes in\r\nChristendom. Without waiting for their aid, the daring Peter dashed, sword\r\nin hand, into the thickest of the foe. Then might be seen achievements\r\nworthy of the days of the giants. Wherever he went, the enemy shrank\r\nbefore him; the Swedes fled to right and left, or were driven, like dogs,\r\ninto the own ditch; but, as he pushed forward singly with headlong\r\ncourage, the foe closed behind and hung upon his rear. One aimed a blow\r\nfull at his heart; but the protecting power which watches over the great\r\nand the good turned aside the hostile blade, and directed it to a side\r\npocket, where reposed an enormous iron tobacco-box, endowed, like the\r\nshield of Achilles, with supernatural powers, doubtless from bearing the\r\nportrait of the blessed St. Nicholas. Peter Stuyvesant turned like an\r\nangry bear upon the foe, and seizing him as he fled, by an immeasurable\r\nqueue, \"Ah, whoreson caterpillar,\" roared he, \"here's what shall make\r\nworms' meat of thee!\" So saying, he whirled his sword, and dealt a blow\r\nthat would have decapitated the varlet, but that the pitying steel struck\r\nshort, and shaved the queue for ever from his crown. At this moment an\r\narquebusier levelled his piece from a neighboring mound, with deadly aim;\r\nbut the watchful Minerva, who had just stopped to tie up her garter,\r\nseeing the peril of her favorite hero, sent old Boreas with his bellows,\r\nwho, as the match descended to the pan, gave a blast that blew the priming\r\nfrom the touch-hole.\r\n\r\nThus waged the fight, when the stout Risingh, surveying the field from\r\nthe top of a little ravelin, perceived his troops banged, beaten, and\r\nkicked by the invincible Peter. Drawing his falchion, and uttering a\r\nthousand anathemas, he strode down to the scene of combat with some such\r\nthundering strides as Jupiter is said by Hesiod to have taken when he\r\nstrode down the spheres to hurl his thunderbolts at the Titans.\r\n\r\nWhen the rival heroes came face to face, each made prodigious start, in\r\nthe style of a veteran stage champion. Then did they regard each other for\r\na moment with the bitter aspect of two furious ram-cats on the point of a\r\nclapper-clawing. Then did they throw themselves into one attitude, then\r\ninto another, striking their swords on the ground, first on the right\r\nside, then on the left; at last at it they went, with incredible ferocity.\r\nWords cannot tell the prodigies of strength and valor displayed in this\r\ndireful encounter--an encounter compared to which the far-famed battles of\r\nAjax with Hector, of Aeneas with Turnus, Orlando with Rodomont, Guy of\r\nWarwick and Colbrand the Dane, or of that renowned Welsh knight, Sir Owen\r\nof the Mountains, with the giant Guylon, were all gentle sports and\r\nholiday recreations. At length the valiant Peter, watching his\r\nopportunity, aimed a blow, enough to cleave his adversary to the very\r\nchine; but Risingh, nimbly raising his sword, warded it off so narrowly,\r\nthat glancing on one side, it shaved away a huge canteen in which he\r\ncarried his liquor: thence pursuing its trenchant course, it severed off a\r\ndeep coat pocket, stored with bread and cheese which provant rolling among\r\nthe armies, occasioned a fearful scrambling between the Swedes and\r\nDutchmen, and made the general battle wax ten times more furious than\r\never.\r\n\r\nEnraged to see his military stores laid waste, the stout Risingh,\r\ncollecting all his forces, aimed a mighty blow full at the hero's crest.\r\nIn vain did his fierce little cocked hat oppose its course. The biting\r\nsteel clove through the stubborn ram beaver, and would have cracked the\r\ncrown of any one not endowed with supernatural hardness of head; but the\r\nbrittle weapon shivered in pieces on the skull of Hardkoppig Piet,\r\nshedding a thousand sparks, like beams of glory, round his grizzly visage.\r\n\r\nThe good Peter reeled with the blow, and turning up his eyes, beheld a\r\nthousands suns, beside moons and stars, dancing about the firmament; at\r\nlength, missing his footing, by reason of his wooden leg, down he came on\r\nhis seat of honor with a crash which shook the surrounding hills, and\r\nmight have wrecked his frame had he not been received into a cushion\r\nsofter than velvet, which Providence or Minerva, or St. Nicholas, or some\r\nkindly cow, had benevolently prepared for his reception.\r\n\r\nThe furious Risingh, in despite of the maxim, cherished by all true\r\nknights, that \"fair play is a jewel,\" hastened to take advantage of the\r\nhero's fall; but, as he stooped to give a fatal blow, Peter Stuyvesant\r\ndealt him a thwack over the sconce with his wooden leg, which set a chime\r\nof bells ringing triple bob majors in his cerebellum. The bewildered Swede\r\nstaggered with the blow, and the wary Peter seizing a pocket-pistol which\r\nlay hard by, discharged it full at the head of the reeling Risingh. Let\r\nnot my reader mistake; it was not a murderous weapon loaded with powder\r\nand ball, but a little sturdy stone pottle charged to the muzzle with a\r\ndouble dram of true Dutch courage, which the knowing Antony Van Corlear\r\ncarried about him by way of replenishing his valor, and which had dropped\r\nfrom his wallet during his furious encounter with the drummer. The hideous\r\nweapon sang through the air, and true to its course, as was the fragment\r\nof a rock discharged at Hector by bully Ajax, encountered the head of the\r\ngigantic Swede with matchless violence.\r\n\r\nThis heaven-directed blow decided the battle. The ponderous pericranium of\r\nGeneral Jan Risingh sank upon his breast; his knees tottered under him; a\r\ndeath-like torpor seized upon his frame, and he tumbled to the earth with\r\nsuch violence that old Pluto started with affright, lest he should have\r\nbroken through the roof of his infernal palace.\r\n\r\nHis fall was the signal of defeat and victory; the Swedes gave way, the\r\nDutch pressed forward; the former took to their heels, the latter hotly\r\npursued. Some entered with them pell mell through the sallyport, others\r\nstormed the bastion, and others scrambled over the curtain. Thus in a\r\nlittle while the fortress of Fort Christina, which, like another Troy, had\r\nstood a siege of full ten hours, was carried by assault, without the loss\r\nof a single man on either side. Victory, in the likeness of a gigantic\r\nox-fly, sat perched on the cocked hat of the gallant Stuyvesant; and it\r\nwas declared by all the writers whom he hired to write the history of his\r\nexpedition that on this memorable day he gained a sufficient quantity of\r\nglory to immortalize a dozen of the greatest heroes in Christendom!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks to St. Nicholas, we have safely finished this tremendous battle.\r\nLet us sit down, my worthy reader, and cool ourselves, for I am in a\r\nprodigious sweat and agitation. Truly this fighting of battles is hot\r\nwork! and if your great commanders did but know what trouble they give\r\ntheir historians, they would not have the conscience to achieve so many\r\nhorrible victories. But methinks I hear my reader complain that throughout\r\nthis boasted battle there is not the least slaughter, nor a single\r\nindividual maimed, if we except the unhappy Swede, who was shorn of his\r\nqueue by the trenchant blade of Peter Stuyvesant; all of which, he\r\nobserves, as a great outrage on probability, and highly injurious to the\r\ninterest of the narration.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly an objection of no little moment, but it arises entirely\r\nfrom the obscurity enveloping the remote periods of time about which I\r\nhave undertaken to write. Thus, though doubtless, from the importance of\r\nthe object, and the prowess of the parties concerned, there must have been\r\nterrible carnage and prodigies of valor displayed before the walls of\r\nChristina, yet, not withstanding that I have consulted every history,\r\nmanuscript, and tradition, touching this memorable though long-forgotten\r\nbattle, I cannot find mention made of a single man killed or wounded in\r\nthe whole affair.\r\n\r\nThis is, without doubt, owing to the extreme modesty of our forefathers,\r\nwho, unlike their descendants, were never prone to vaunt of their\r\nachievements; but it is a virtue which places their historian in a most\r\nembarrassing predicament; for, having promised my readers a hideous and\r\nunparalleled battle, and having worked them up into a warlike and\r\nblood-thirsty state of mind, to put them off without any havoc and\r\nslaughter would have been as bitter a disappointment as to summon a\r\nmultitude of good people to attend an execution, and then cruelly balk\r\nthem by a reprieve.\r\n\r\nHad the Fates allowed me some half a score of dead men, I had been\r\ncontent; for I would have made them such heroes as abounded in the olden\r\ntime, but whose race is now unfortunately extinct; any one of whom, if we\r\nmay believe those authentic writers, the poets, could drive great armies,\r\nlike sheep before him, and conquer and desolate whole cities by his single\r\narm.\r\n\r\nBut seeing that I had not a single life at my disposal, all that was left\r\nme was to make the most I could of my battle, by means of kicks, and\r\ncuffs, and bruises, and such-like ignoble wounds. And here I cannot but\r\ncompare my dilemma, in some sort, to that of the divine Milton, who,\r\nhaving arrayed with sublime preparation his immortal hosts against each\r\nother, is sadly put to it how to manage them, and how he shall make the\r\nend of his battle answer to the beginning; inasmuch as, being mere\r\nspirits, he cannot deal a mortal blow, nor even give a flesh wound to any\r\nof his combatants. For my part, the greatest difficulty I found was, when\r\nI had once put my warriors in a passion, and let them loose into the midst\r\nof the enemy, to keep them from doing mischief. Many a time had I to\r\nrestrain the sturdy Peter from cleaving a gigantic Swede to the very\r\nwaistband, or spitting half a dozen little fellows on his sword, like so\r\nmany sparrows. And when I had set some hundred of missives flying in the\r\nair, I did not dare to suffer one of them to reach the ground, lest it\r\nshould have put an end to some unlucky Dutchman.\r\n\r\nThe reader cannot conceive how mortifying it is to a writer thus in a\r\nmanner to have his hands tied, and how many tempting opportunities I had\r\nto wink at, where I might have made as fine a death-blow as any recorded\r\nin history or song.\r\n\r\nFrom my own experience I begin to doubt most potently of the authenticity\r\nof many of Homer's stories. I verily believe that when he had once\r\nlaunched one of his favorite heroes among a crowd of the enemy, he cut\r\ndown many an honest fellow, without any authority for so doing, excepting\r\nthat he presented a fair mark; and that often a poor fellow was sent to\r\ngrim Pluto's domains, merely because he had a name that would give a\r\nsounding turn to a period. But I disclaim all such unprincipled liberties:\r\nlet me but have truth and the law on my side, and no man would fight\r\nharder than myself, but since the various records I consulted did not\r\nwarrant it, I had too much conscience to kill a single soldier. By St.\r\nNicholas, but it would have been a pretty piece of business! My enemies,\r\nthe critics, who I foresee will be ready enough to lay any crime they can\r\ndiscover at my door, might have charged me with murder outright; and I\r\nshould have esteemed myself lucky to escape with no harsher verdict than\r\nmanslaughter!\r\n\r\nAnd now, gentle reader, that we are tranquilly sitting down here, smoking\r\nour pipes, permit me to indulge in a melancholy reflection which at this\r\nmoment passes across my mind. How vain, how fleeting, how uncertain are\r\nall those gaudy bubbles after which we are panting and toiling in this\r\nworld of fair delusions! The wealth which the miser has amassed with so\r\nmany weary days, so many sleepless nights, a spendthrift heir may squander\r\naway in joyless prodigality; the noblest monuments which pride has ever\r\nreared to perpetuate a name, the hand of time will shortly tumble into\r\nruins; and even the brightest laurels, gained by feats of arms, may\r\nwither, and be for ever blighted by the chilling neglect of mankind. \"How\r\nmany illustrious heroes,\" says the good Boetius, \"who were once the pride\r\nand glory of the age, hath the silence of historians buried in eternal\r\noblivion!\" And this it was that induced the Spartans, when they went to\r\nbattle, solemnly to sacrifice to the Muses, supplicating that their\r\nachievements might be worthily recorded. Had not Homer turned his lofty\r\nlyre, observes the elegant Cicero, the valor of Achilles had remained\r\nunsung. And such, too, after all the toils and perils he had braved, after\r\nall the gallant actions he had achieved, such too had nearly been the fate\r\nof the chivalric Peter Stuyvesant, but that I fortunately stepped in and\r\nengraved his name on the indellible tablet of history, just as the caitiff\r\nTime was silently brushing it away for ever!\r\n\r\nThe more I reflect, the more I am astonished at the important character of\r\nthe historian. He is the sovereign censor, to decide upon the renown or\r\ninfamy of his fellow-men. He is the patron of kings and conquerors on whom\r\nit depends whether they shall live in after ages, or be forgotten as were\r\ntheir ancestors before them. The tyrant may oppress while the object of\r\nhis tyranny exists; but the historian possesses superior might, for his\r\npower extends even beyond the grave. The shades of departed and\r\nlong-forgotten heroes anxiously bend down from above, while he writes,\r\nwatching each movement of his pen, whether it shall pass by their names\r\nwith neglect, or inscribe them on the deathless pages of renown. Even the\r\ndrop of ink which hangs trembling on his pen, which he may either dash\r\nupon the floor, or waste in idle scrawlings--that very drop, which to him\r\nis not worth the twentieth part of a farthing, may be of incalculable\r\nvalue to some departed worthy--may elevate half a score, in one moment, to\r\nimmortality, who would have given worlds, had they possessed them, to\r\nensure the glorious meed.\r\n\r\nLet not my readers imagine, however, that I am indulging in vain-glorious\r\nboastings, or am anxious to blazon forth the importance of my tribe. On\r\nthe contrary, I shrink when I reflect on the awful responsibility we\r\nhistorians assume; I shudder to think what direful commotions and\r\ncalamities we occasion in the world; I swear to thee, honest reader, as I\r\nam a man, I weep at the very idea! Why, let me ask, are so many\r\nillustrious men daily tearing themselves away from the embraces of their\r\nfamilies, slighting the smiles of beauty, despising the allurements of\r\nfortune, and exposing themselves to the miseries of war? Why are kings\r\ndesolating empires, and depopulating whole countries? In short, what\r\ninduces all great men, of all ages and countries, to commit so many\r\nvictories and misdeeds, and inflict so many miseries upon mankind and upon\r\nthemselves, but the mere hope that some historian will kindly take them\r\ninto notice, and admit them into a corner of his volume? For, in short,\r\nthe mighty object of all their toils, their hardships, and privations, is\r\nnothing but immortal fame. And what is immortal fame? Why, half a page of\r\ndirty paper! Alas, alas! how humiliating the idea, that the renown of so\r\ngreat a man as Peter Stuyvesant should depend upon the pen of so little a\r\nman as Diedrich Knickerbocker!\r\n\r\nAnd now, having refreshed ourselves after the fatigues and perils of the\r\nfield, it behoves us to return once more to the scene of conflict, and\r\ninquire what were the results of this renowned conquest. The fortress of\r\nChristina being the fair metropolis, and in a manner the key to New\r\nSweden, its capture was speedily followed by the entire subjugation of the\r\nprovince. This was not a little promoted by the gallant and courteous\r\ndeportment of the chivalric Peter. Though a man terrible in battle, yet in\r\nthe hour of victory was he endued with a spirit generous, merciful and\r\nhumane. He vaunted not over his enemies, nor did he make defeat more\r\ngalling by unmanly insults; for, like that mirror of knightly virtue, the\r\nrenowned Paladin Orlando, he was more anxious to do great actions than to\r\ntalk of them after they were done. He put no man to death, ordered no\r\nhouses to be burnt down, permitted no ravages to be perpetrated on the\r\nproperty of the vanquished, and even gave one of his bravest officers a\r\nsevere punishment with his walking-staff, for having been detected in the\r\nact of sacking a hen-roost.\r\n\r\nHe moreover issued a proclamation, inviting the inhabitants to submit to\r\nthe authority of their High Mightinesses, but declaring, with unexampled\r\nclemency, that whoever refused should be lodged, at the public expense, in\r\na goodly castle provided for the purpose, and have an armed retinue to\r\nwait on them in the bargain. In consequence of these beneficent terms,\r\nabout thirty Swedes stepped manfully forward and took the oath of\r\nallegiance; in reward for which they were graciously permitted to remain\r\non the banks of the Delaware, where their descendants reside at this very\r\nday. I am told, however, by divers observant travelers, that they have\r\nnever been able to get over the chap-fallen looks of their ancestors; but\r\nthat they still do strangely transmit, from father to son, manifest marks\r\nof the sound drubbing given them by the sturdy Amsterdammers.\r\n\r\nThe whole country of New Sweden having thus yielded to the arms of the\r\ntriumphant Peter, was reduced to a colony called South River, and placed\r\nunder the superintendence of a lieutenant-governor, subject to the control\r\nof the supreme government of New Amsterdam. This great dignitary was\r\ncalled Mynheer William Beekman, or rather Beck-man, who derived his\r\nsurname, as did Ovidius Naso of yore, from the lordly dimensions of his\r\nnose, which projected from the center of his countenance like the beak of\r\na parrot. He was the great progenitor of the tribe of the Beekmans, one of\r\nthe most ancient and honorable families of the province; the members of\r\nwhich do gratefully commemorate the origin of their dignity, nor as your\r\nnoble families in England would do by having a glowing proboscis\r\nemblazoned in their escutcheon, but by one and all wearing a right goodly\r\nnose stuck in the very middle of their faces.\r\n\r\nThus was this perilous enterprise gloriously terminated, with the loss of\r\nonly two men--Wolfet Van Horne, a tall spare man, who was knocked\r\noverboard by the boom of a sloop in a flaw of wind, and fat Brom Van\r\nBummel, who was suddenly carried off by an indigestion; both, however,\r\nwere immortalized as having bravely fallen in the service of their\r\ncountry. True it is, Peter Stuyvesant had one of his limbs terribly\r\nfractured in the act of storming the fortress; but as it was fortunately\r\nhis wooden leg, the wound was promptly and effectually healed.\r\n\r\nAnd now nothing remains to this branch of my history but to mention that\r\nthis immaculate hero and his victorious army returned joyously to the\r\nManhattoes, where they made a solemn and triumphant entry, bearing with\r\nthem the conquered Risingh, and the remnant of his battered crew who had\r\nrefused allegiance; for it appears that the gigantic Swede had only\r\nfallen into a swoon at the end of the battle, from which he was speedily\r\nrestored by a wholesome tweak of the nose.\r\n\r\nThese captive heroes were lodged, according to the promise of the\r\ngovernor, at the public expense, in a fair and spacious castle, being the\r\nprison of state of which Stoffel Brinkerhoff, the immortal conqueror of\r\nOyster Bay, was appointed governor, and which has ever since remained in\r\nthe possession of his descendants.[56]\r\n\r\nIt was a pleasant and goodly sight to witness the joy of the people of New\r\nAmsterdam at beholding their warriors once more return from this war in\r\nthe wilderness. The old women thronged round Antony Van Corlear, who gave\r\nthe whole history of the campaign with matchless accuracy, saving that he\r\ntook the credit of fighting the whole battle himself, and especially of\r\nvanquishing the stout Risingh, which he considered himself as clearly\r\nentitled to, seeing that it was effected by his own stone pottle.\r\n\r\nThe schoolmasters throughout the town gave holiday to their little urchins\r\nwho followed in droves after the drums, with paper caps on their heads and\r\nsticks in their breeches, thus taking the first lesson in the art of war.\r\nAs to the sturdy rabble, they thronged at the heels of Peter Stuyvesant\r\nwherever he went, waving their greasy hats in the air, and shouting,\r\n\"Hardkoppig Piet forever!\"\r\n\r\nIt was indeed a day of roaring rout and jubilee. A huge dinner was\r\nprepared at the stadthouse in honor of the conquerors, where were\r\nassembled, in one glorious constellation, the great and little luminaries\r\nof New Amsterdam. There were the lordly Schout and his obsequious deputy,\r\nthe burgomasters with their officious schepens at their elbows, the\r\nsubaltern officers at the elbows of the schepens, and so on, down to the\r\nlowest hanger-on of police; every tag having his rag at his side, to\r\nfinish his pipe, drink off his heel-taps, and laugh at his flights of\r\nimmortal dulness. In short--for a city feast is a city feast all over the\r\nworld, and has been a city feast ever since the creation--the dinner went\r\noff much the same as do our great corporation junketings and Fourth of\r\nJuly banquets. Loads of fish, flesh, and fowl were devoured, oceans of\r\nliquor drunk, thousands of pipes smoked, and many a dull joke honored with\r\nmuch obstreperous fat-sided laughter.\r\n\r\nI must not omit to mention that to this far-famed victory Peter Stuyvesant\r\nwas indebted for another of his many titles, for so hugely delighted were\r\nthe honest burghers with his achievements, that they unanimously honored\r\nhim with the name of Pieter de Groodt; that is to say, Peter the Great;\r\nor, as it was translated into English by the people of New Amsterdam, for\r\nthe benefit of their New England visitors, Piet de pig--an appellation\r\nwhich he maintained even unto the day of his death.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [56] This castle, though very much altered, and modernized, is\r\n        still in being and stands at the corner of Pearl Street, facing\r\n        Coentie's Slip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_BOOK VII._\r\n\r\nCONTAINING THE THIRD PART OF THE REIGN OF PETER THE HEADSTRONG--HIS\r\nTROUBLES WITH THE BRITISH NATION, AND THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE DUTCH\r\nDYNASTY.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the reign of Peter Stuyvesant furnishes an edifying picture\r\nof the cares and vexations inseparable from sovereignty, and a solemn\r\nwarning to all who are ambitious of attaining the seat of honor. Though\r\nreturning in triumph and crowned with victory, his exultation was checked\r\non observing the abuses which had sprung up in New Amsterdam during his\r\nshort absence. His walking-staff which he had sent home to act as his\r\nvicegerent, had, it is true, kept his council chamber in order; the\r\ncounsellors eyeing it with awe as it lay in grim repose upon the table,\r\nand smoking their pipes in silence; but its control extended not out of\r\ndoors.\r\n\r\nThe populace unfortunately had had too much their own way under the slack\r\nthough fitful reign of William the Testy; and though upon the accession of\r\nPeter Stuyvesant they had felt, with the instinctive perception which mobs\r\nas well as cattle possess, that the reins of government had passed into\r\nstronger hands, yet could they not help fretting and chafing and champing\r\nupon, the bit in restive silence.\r\n\r\nScarcely, therefore, had he departed on his expedition against the Swedes,\r\nthan the whole factions of William Kieft's reign had again thrust their\r\nheads above water. Pot-house meetings were again held to \"discuss the\r\nstate of the nation,\" where cobblers, tinkers, and tailors, the\r\nself-dubbed \"friends of the people,\" once more felt themselves inspired\r\nwith the gift of legislation, and undertook to lecture on every movement\r\nof government.\r\n\r\nNow, as Peter Stuyvesant had a singular inclination to govern the province\r\nby his individual will, his first move on his return, was to put a stop to\r\nthis gratuitous legislation. Accordingly, one evening, when an inspired\r\ncobbler was holding forth to an assemblage of the kind, the intrepid Peter\r\nsuddenly made his appearance with his ominous walking staff in his hand,\r\nand a countenance sufficient to petrify a millstone. The whole meeting was\r\nthrown into confusion--the orators stood aghast, with open mouth and\r\ntrembling knees, while \"Horror!\" \"Tyranny!\" \"Liberty!\" \"Rights!\" \"Taxes!\"\r\n\"Death!\" \"Destruction!\" and a host of other patriotic phrases, were bolted\r\nforth before he had time to close his lips. Peter took no notice of the\r\nskulking throng, but strode up to the brawling, bully-ruffian, and pulling\r\nout a huge silver watch, which might have served in times of yore as a\r\ntown-clock, and which is still retained by his descendants as a family\r\ncuriosity, requested the orator to mend it and set it going. The orator\r\nhumbly confessed it was utterly out of his power, as he was unacquainted\r\nwith the nature of its construction. \"Nay, but,\" said Peter, \"try your\r\ningenuity, man; you see all the springs and wheels and how easily the\r\nclumsiest hand may stop it, and pull it to pieces, and why should it not\r\nbe equally easy to regulate as to stop it?\" The orator declared that his\r\ntrade was wholly different--that he was a poor cobbler, and had never\r\nmeddled with a watch in his life--that there were men skilled in the art\r\nwhose business it was to attend to those matters, but for his part he\r\nshould only mar the workmanship, and put the whole in confusion. \"Why,\r\nharkee, master of mine,\" cried Peter, turning suddenly upon him with a\r\ncountenance that almost petrified the patcher of shoes into a perfect\r\nlapstone, \"dost thou pretend to meddle with the movements of government to\r\nregulate, and correct, and patch, and cobble a complicated machine, the\r\nprinciples of which are above thy comprehension, and its simplest\r\noperations too subtle for thy understanding, when thou canst not correct a\r\ntrifling error in a common piece of mechanism, the whole mystery of which\r\nis open to thy inspection?--Hence with thee to the leather and stone,\r\nwhich are emblems of thy head; cobble thy shoes, and confine thyself to\r\nthe vocation for which Heaven has fitted thee; but,\" elevating his voice\r\nuntil it made the welkin ring, \"if ever I catch thee, or any of thy tribe,\r\nmeddling again with affairs of government, by St. Nicholas, but I'll have\r\nevery mother's bastard of ye flayed alive, and your hides stretched for\r\ndrumheads, that ye may thenceforth make a noise to some purpose!\"\r\n\r\nThis threat and the tremendous voice in which it was uttered, caused the\r\nwhole multitude to quake with fear. The hair of the orator rose on his\r\nhead like his own swine's bristles; and not a knight of the thimble\r\npresent but his heart died within him, and he felt as though he could have\r\nverily escaped through the eye of a needle. The assembly dispersed in\r\nsilent consternation: the pseudo-statesmen who had hitherto undertaken to\r\nregulate public affairs were now fain to stay at home, hold their tongues,\r\nand take care of their families; and party feuds died away to such a\r\ndegree, that many thriving keepers of taverns and dram-shops were utterly\r\nruined for want of business. But though this measure produced the desired\r\neffect in putting an extinguisher on the new lights just brightening up,\r\nyet did it tend to injure the popularity of the great Peter with the\r\nthinking part of the community; that is to say, that part which think for\r\nothers instead of for themselves; or, in other words, who attend to\r\neverybody's business but their own. These accused the old governor of\r\nbeing highly aristocratical, and in truth there seems to have been some\r\nground for such an accusation, for he carried himself with a lofty,\r\nsoldier-like air, and was somewhat particular in his dress, appearing,\r\nwhen not in uniform, in rich apparel of the antique flaundish cut, and was\r\nespecially noted for having his sound leg, which was a very comely one,\r\nalways arrayed in a red stocking and high-heeled shoe.\r\n\r\nJustice he often dispensed in the primitive patriarchal way, seated on the\r\n\"stoep\" before the door, under the shade of a great button-wood tree, but\r\nall visits of form and state were received with something of court\r\nceremony in the best parlor, where Antony the Trumpeter officiated as high\r\nchamberlain. On public occasions he appeared with great pomp of equipage,\r\nand always rode to church in a yellow wagon with flaming red wheels.\r\n\r\nThese symptoms of state and ceremony, as we have hinted, were much caviled\r\nat by the thinking, and talking, part of the community. They had been\r\naccustomed to find easy access to their former governors, and in\r\nparticular had lived on terms of extreme intimacy with William the Testy,\r\nand they accused Peter Stuyvesant of assuming too much dignity and\r\nreserve, and of wrapping himself in mystery. Others, however, have\r\npretended to discover in all this a shrewd policy on the part of the old\r\ngovernor. It is certainly of the first importance, say they, that a\r\ncountry should be governed by wise men; but then it is almost equally\r\nimportant that the people should think them wise; for this belief alone\r\ncan produce willing subordination. To keep up, however, this desirable\r\nconfidence in rulers, the people should be allowed to see as little of\r\nthem as possible. It is the mystery which envelopes great men that gives\r\nthem half their greatness. There is a kind of superstitious reverence for\r\noffice which leads us to exaggerate the merits of the occupant, and to\r\nsuppose that he must be wiser than common men. He, however, who gains\r\naccess to cabinets, soon finds out by what foolishness the world is\r\ngoverned. He finds that there is quackery in legislation as in everything\r\nelse; that rulers have their whims and errors as well as other men, and\r\nare not so wonderfully superior as he had imagined, since even he may\r\noccasionally confute them in argument. Thus awe subsides into confidence,\r\nconfidence inspires familiarity, and familiarity produces contempt. Such\r\nwas the case, say they, with William the Testy. By making himself too easy\r\nof access, he enabled every scrub-politician to measure wits with him, and\r\nto find out the true dimensions not only of his person, but of his mind;\r\nand thus it was that, by being familiarly scanned, he was discovered to be\r\na very little man. Peter Stuyvesant, on the contrary, say they, by\r\nconducting himself with dignity and loftiness, was looked up to with great\r\nreverence. As he never gave his reasons for anything he did, the public\r\ngave him credit for very profound ones; every movement, however\r\nintrinsically unimportant, was a matter of speculation; and his very red\r\nstockings excited some respect, as being different from the stockings of\r\nother men.\r\n\r\nAnother charge against Peter Stuyvesant was, that he had a great leaning\r\nin favor of the patricians; and, indeed, in his time rose many of those\r\nmighty Dutch families which have taken such vigorous root, and branched\r\nout so luxuriantly in our state. Some, to be sure, were of earlier date,\r\nsuch as the Van Kortlandts, the Van Zandts, the Ten Broecks, the Harden\r\nBroecks, and others of Pavonian renown, who gloried in the title of\r\n\"Discoverers,\" from having been engaged in the nautical expedition from\r\nCommunipaw, in which they so heroically braved the terrors of Hell-gate\r\nand Buttermilk-channel, and discovered a site for New Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nOthers claimed to themselves the appellation of Conquerors, from their\r\ngallant achievements in New Sweden and their victory over the Yankees at\r\nOyster Bay. Such was that list of warlike worthies heretofore enumerated,\r\nbeginning with the Van Wycks, the Van Dycks, and the Ten Eycks, and\r\nextending to the Rutgers, the Bensons, the Brinkerhoffs, and the\r\nSchermerhorns; a roll equal to the Doomsday Book of William the Conqueror,\r\nand establishing the heroic origin of many an ancient aristocratical Dutch\r\nfamily. These, after all, are the only legitimate nobility and lords of\r\nthe soil; these are the real \"beavers of the Manhattoes;\" and much does it\r\ngrieve me in modern days to see them elbowed aside by foreign invaders,\r\nand more especially by those ingenious people, \"the Sons of the Pilgrims;\"\r\nwho out-bargain them in the market, out-speculate them on the exchange,\r\nout-top them in fortune, and run up mushroom palaces so high, that the\r\ntallest Dutch family mansion has not wind enough left for its weathercock.\r\n\r\nIn the proud days of Peter Stuyvesant, however, the good old Dutch\r\naristocracy loomed out in all its grandeur. The burly burgher, in\r\nround-crowned flaunderish hat with brim of vast circumference, in portly\r\ngaberdine and bulbous multiplicity of breeches, sat on his \"stoep\" and\r\nsmoked his pipe in lordly silence; nor did it ever enter his brain that\r\nthe active, restless Yankee, whom he saw through his half-shut eyes\r\nworrying about in dog day heat, ever intent on the main chance, was one\r\nday to usurp control over these goodly Dutch domains. Already, however,\r\nthe races regarded each other with disparaging eyes. The Yankees\r\nsneeringly spoke of the round-crowned burghers of the Manhattoes as the\r\n\"Copper-heads;\" while the latter, glorying in their own nether rotundity,\r\nand observing the slack galligaskins of their rivals, flapping like an\r\nempty sail against the mast, retorted upon them with the opprobrious\r\nappellation of \"Platter-breeches.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what I have recounted in the foregoing chapter, I would not have it\r\nimagined that the great Peter was a tyrannical potentate, ruling with a\r\nrod of iron. On the contrary, where the dignity of office permitted, he\r\nabounded in generosity and condescension. If he refused the brawling\r\nmultitude the right of misrule, he at least endeavored to rule them in\r\nrighteousness. To spread abundance in the land, he obliged the bakers to\r\ngive thirteen loaves to the dozen--a golden rule which remains a monument\r\nof his beneficence. So far from indulging in unreasonable austerity, he\r\ndelighted to see the poor and the laboring man rejoice; and for this\r\npurpose he was a great promoter of holidays. Under his reign there was a\r\ngreat cracking of eggs at Paas or Easter; Whitsuntide or Pinxter also\r\nflourished in all its bloom; and never were stockings better filled on the\r\neve of the blessed St. Nicholas.\r\n\r\nNew Year's Day, however, was his favorite festival, and was ushered in by\r\nthe ringing of bells and firing of guns. On that genial day the fountains\r\nof hospitality were broken up, and the whole community was deluged with\r\ncherry-brandy, true hollands, and mulled cider; every house was a temple\r\nto the jolly god; and many a provident vagabond got drunk out of pure\r\neconomy, taking in liquor enough gratis to serve him half a year\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nThe great assemblage, however, was at the governor's house, whither\r\nrepaired all the burghers of New Amsterdam with their wives and daughters,\r\npranked out in their best attire. On this occasion the good Peter was\r\ndevoutly observant of the pious Dutch rite of kissing the women-kind for\r\na happy new year; and it is traditional that Antony the trumpeter, who\r\nacted as gentleman usher, took toll of all who were young and handsome, as\r\nthey passed through the ante-chamber. This venerable custom, thus happily\r\nintroduced, was followed with such zeal by high and low that on New Year's\r\nDay, during the reign of Peter Stuyvesant, New Amsterdam was the most\r\nthoroughly be-kissed community in all Christendom.\r\n\r\nAnother great measure of Peter Stuyvesant for public improvement was the\r\ndistribution of fiddles throughout the land. These were placed in the\r\nhands of veteran negroes, who were despatched as missionaries to every\r\npart of the province. This measure, it is said, was first suggested by\r\nAntony the Trumpeter, and the effect was marvelous. Instead of those\r\n\"indignation meetings\" set on foot in the time of William the Testy, where\r\nmen met together to rail at public abuses, groan over the evils of the\r\ntimes, and make each other miserable, there were joyous gatherings of the\r\ntwo sexes to dance and make merry. Now were instituted \"quilting bees,\"\r\nand \"husking bees,\" and other rural assemblages, where, under the\r\ninspiring influence of the fiddle, toil was enlivened by gayety and\r\nfollowed up by the dance. \"Raising bees\" also were frequent, where houses\r\nsprang up at the wagging of the fiddle-stick, as the walls of Thebes\r\nsprang up of yore to the sound of the lyre of Amphion.\r\n\r\nJolly autumn, which pours its treasures over hill and dale, was in those\r\ndays a season for the lifting of the heel as well as the heart; labor came\r\ndancing in the train of abundance, and frolic prevailed throughout the\r\nland. Happy days! when the yeomanry of the Nieuw Nederlands were merry\r\nrather than wise; and when the notes of the fiddle, those harbingers of\r\ngood humor and good will, resounded at the close of the day from every\r\nhamlet along the Hudson!\r\n\r\nNor was it in rural communities alone that Peter Stuyvesant introduced his\r\nfavorite engine of civilization. Under his rule the fiddle acquired that\r\npotent sway in New Amsterdam which it has ever since retained. Weekly\r\nassemblages were held, not in heated ball-rooms at midnight hours, but on\r\nSaturday afternoons, by the golden light of the sun, on the green lawn of\r\nthe Battery; with Antony the Trumpeter for master of ceremonies. Here\r\nwould the good Peter take his seat under the spreading trees, among the\r\nold burghers and their wives, and watch the mazes of the dance. Here would\r\nhe smoke his pipe, crack his joke, and forget the rugged toils of war, in\r\nthe sweet oblivious festivities of peace, giving a nod of approbation to\r\nthose of the young men who shuffled and kicked most vigorously; and now\r\nand then a hearty smack, in all honesty of soul, to the buxom lass who\r\nheld out longest, and tired down every competitor--infallible proof of her\r\nbeing the best dancer.\r\n\r\nOnce, it is true, the harmony of these meetings was in danger of\r\ninterruption. A young belle, just returned from a visit to Holland, who of\r\ncourse led the fashions, made her appearance in not more than half-a-dozen\r\npetticoats, and these of alarming shortness. A whisper and a flutter ran\r\nthrough the assembly. The young men of course were lost in admiration, but\r\nthe old ladies were shocked in the extreme, especially those who had\r\nmarriageable daughters; the young ladies blushed and felt excessively for\r\nthe \"poor thing,\" and even the governor himself appeared to be in some\r\nkind of perturbation.\r\n\r\nTo complete the confusion of the good folk she undertook, in the course of\r\na jig, to describe some figures in algebra taught her by a dancing-master\r\nat Rotterdam. Unfortunately, at the highest flourish of her feet, some\r\nvagabond zephyr obtruded his services, and a display of the graces took\r\nplace, at which all the ladies present were thrown into great\r\nconsternation; several grave country members were not a little moved, and\r\nthe good Peter Stuyvesant himself was grievously scandalized.\r\n\r\nThe shortness of the female dresses, which had continued in fashion ever\r\nsince the days of William Kieft, had long offended his eye; and though\r\nextremely averse to meddling with the petticoats of the ladies, yet he\r\nimmediately recommended that every one should be furnished with a flounce\r\nto the bottom. He likewise ordered that the ladies, and indeed the\r\ngentlemen, should use no other step in dancing than \"shuffle and turn,\"\r\nand \"double trouble;\" and forbade, under pain of his high displeasure, any\r\nyoung lady thenceforth to attempt what was termed \"exhibiting the graces.\"\r\n\r\nThese were the only restrictions he ever imposed upon the sex, and these\r\nwere considered by them as tyrannical oppressions, and resisted with that\r\nbecoming spirit manifested by the gentle sex whenever their privileges are\r\ninvaded. In fact, Antony Van Corlear, who, as has been shown, was a\r\nsagacious man, experienced in the ways of women, took a private occasion\r\nto intimate to the governor that a conspiracy was forming among the young\r\nvrouws of New Amsterdam; and that, if the matter were pushed any further,\r\nthere was danger of their leaving off petticoats altogether; whereupon the\r\ngood Peter shrugged his shoulders, dropped the subject, and ever after\r\nsuffered the women to wear their petticoats, and cut their capers as high\r\nas they pleased, a privilege which they have jealously maintained in the\r\nManhattoes unto the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last two chapters I have regaled the reader with a delectable\r\npicture of the good Peter and his metropolis during an interval of peace.\r\nIt was, however, but a bit of blue sky in a stormy day; the clouds are\r\nagain gathering up from all points of the compass, and, if I am not\r\nmistaken in my forebodings, we shall have rattling weather in the ensuing\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\nIt is with some communities, as it is with certain meddlesome\r\nindividuals--they have a wonderful facility at getting into scrapes; and I\r\nhave always remarked that those are most prone to get in who have the\r\nleast talent at getting out again. This is doubtless owing to the\r\nexcessive valor of those states; for I have likewise noticed that this\r\nrampant quality is always most frothy and fussy where most confined; which\r\naccounts for its vaporing so amazingly in little states, little men and\r\nugly little women more especially.\r\n\r\nSuch is the case with this little province of the Nieuw Nederlands; which,\r\nby its exceeding valor, has already drawn upon itself a host of enemies;\r\nhas had fighting enough to satisfy a province twice its size, and is in a\r\nfair way of becoming an exceedingly forlorn, well-belabored, and woebegone\r\nlittle province. All which was providentially ordered to give interest and\r\nsublimity to this pathetic history.\r\n\r\nThe first interruption to the halcyon quiet of Peter Stuyvesant was caused\r\nby hostile intelligence from the old belligerent nest of Rensellaersteen.\r\nKillian, the lordly patroon of Rensellaerwick, was again in the field, at\r\nthe head of his myrmidons of the Helderberg seeking to annex the whole of\r\nthe Catskill mountains to his domains. The Indian tribes of these\r\nmountains had likewise taken up the hatchet, and menaced the venerable\r\nDutch settlements of Esopus.\r\n\r\nFain would I entertain the reader with the triumphant campaign of Peter\r\nStuyvesant in the haunted regions of those mountains, but that I hold all\r\nIndian conflicts to be mere barbaric brawls, unworthy of the pen which has\r\nrecorded the classic war of Fort Christina; and as to these Helderberg\r\ncommotions, they are among the flatulencies which from time to time\r\nafflict the bowels of this ancient province, as with a wind-colic, and\r\nwhich I deem it seemly and decent to pass over in silence.\r\n\r\nThe next storm of trouble was from the south. Scarcely had the worthy\r\nMynheer Beekman got warm in the seat of authority on the South River, than\r\nenemies began to spring up all around him. Hard by was a formidable race\r\nof savages inhabiting the gentle region watered by the Susquehanna, of\r\nwhom the following mention is made by Master Hariot in his excellent\r\nhistory:----\r\n\r\n\"The Susquesahanocks are a giantly people, strange in proportion, behavior,\r\nand attire--their voice sounding from them as out of a cave. Their\r\ntobacco-pipes were three-quarters of a yard long; carved at the great end\r\nwith a bird, beare, or other device, sufficient to beat out the brains of\r\na horse. The calfe of one of their legges measured three-quarters of a\r\nyard about; the rest of the limbs proportionable.\"[57]\r\n\r\nThese gigantic savages and smokers caused no little disquiet in the mind\r\nof Mynheer Beekman, threatening to cause a famine of tobacco in the land;\r\nbut his most formidable enemy was the roaring, roistering English colony\r\nof Maryland, or, as it was anciently written, Merryland; so called because\r\nthe inhabitants, not having the fear of the Lord before their eyes, were\r\nprone to make merry and get fuddled with mint-julep and apple-toddy. They\r\nwere, moreover, great horse-racers and cock-fighters, mighty wrestlers and\r\njumpers, and enormous consumers of hoe-cake and bacon. They lay claim to\r\nbe the first inventors of those recondite beverages, cock-tail,\r\nstone-fence, and sherry-cobbler, and to have discovered the gastronomical\r\nmerits of terrapins, soft crabs, and canvas-back ducks.\r\n\r\nThis rantipole colony, founded by Lord Baltimore, a British nobleman, was\r\nmanaged by his agent, a swaggering Englishman, commonly called Fendall,\r\nthat is to say, \"offend all,\" a name given him for his bullying\r\npropensities. These were seen in a message to Mynheer Beekman, threatening\r\nhim, unless he immediately swore allegiance to Lord Baltimore as the\r\nrightful lord of the soil, to come at the head of the roaring boys of\r\nMerryland and the giants of the Susquehanna, and sweep him and his\r\nNederlanders out of the country.\r\n\r\nThe trusty sword of Peter Stuyvesant almost leaped from its scabbard, when\r\nhe received missives from Mynheer Beekman, informing him of the swaggering\r\nmenaces of the bully Fendall; and as to the giantly warriors of the\r\nSusquehanna, nothing would have more delighted him than a bout, hand to\r\nhand, with half a score of them, having never encountered a giant in the\r\nwhole course of his campaigns, unless we may consider the stout Risingh as\r\nsuch, and he was but a little one.\r\n\r\nNothing prevented his marching instantly to the South River, and enacting\r\nscenes still more glorious than those of Fort Christina, but the necessity\r\nof first putting a stop to the increasing aggressions and inroads of the\r\nYankees, so as not to leave an enemy in his rear; but he wrote to Mynheer\r\nBeekman to keep up a bold front and a stout heart, promising, as soon as\r\nhe had settled affairs in the east, that he would hasten to the south with\r\nhis burly warriors of the Hudson, to lower the crests of the giants, and\r\nmar the merriment of the Merrylanders.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [57] Hariot's Journal, Purch. Pilgrims.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo explain the apparently sudden movement of Peter Stuyvesant against the\r\ncrafty men of the East Country, I would observe that, during his campaigns\r\non the South River, and in the enchanted regions of the Catskill\r\nMountains, the twelve tribes of the East had been more than usually\r\nactive in prosecuting their subtle scheme for the subjugation of the Nieuw\r\nNederlands.\r\n\r\nIndependent of the incessant maraudings among hen-roosts and squattings\r\nalong the border, invading armies would penetrate, from time to time, into\r\nthe very heart of the country. As their prototypes of yore went forth into\r\nthe land of Canaan, with their wives and their children, their\r\nmen-servants and their maid-servants, their flocks and herds, to settle\r\nthemselves down in the land and possess it; so these chosen people of\r\nmodern days would progress through the country in patriarchal style,\r\nconducting carts and waggons laden with household furniture, with women\r\nand children piled on top, and pots and kettles dangling beneath. At the\r\ntail of these vehicles would stalk a crew of long-limbed, lank-sided\r\nvarlets with axes on their shoulders, and packs on their backs, resolutely\r\nbent upon \"locating\" themselves, as they termed it, and improving the\r\ncountry. These were the most dangerous kind of invaders. It is true they\r\nwere guilty of no overt acts of hostility; but it was notorious that,\r\nwherever they got a footing, the honest Dutchmen gradually disappeared,\r\nretiring slowly as do the Indians before the white men; being in some way\r\nor other talked and chaffered, and bargained and swapped, and, in plain\r\nEnglish, elbowed out of all those rich bottoms and fertile nooks in which\r\nour Dutch yeomanry are prone to nestle themselves.\r\n\r\nPeter Stuyvesant was at length roused to this kind of war in disguise, by\r\nwhich the Yankees were craftily aiming to subjugate his dominions.\r\n\r\nHe was a man easily taken in, it is true, as all great-hearted men are apt\r\nto be; but if he once found it out, his wrath was terrible. He now threw\r\ndiplomacy to the dogs, determined to appear no more by ambassadors, but to\r\nrepair in person to the great council of the Amphictyons, bearing the\r\nsword in one hand and the olive-branch in the other, and giving them\r\ntheir choice of sincere and honest peace, or open and iron war.\r\n\r\nHis privy council were astonished and dismayed when he announced his\r\ndetermination. For once they ventured to remonstrate, setting forth the\r\nrashness of venturing his sacred person in the midst of a strange and\r\nbarbarous people. They might as well have tried to turn a rusty\r\nweathercock with a broken-winded bellows. In the fiery heart of the\r\niron-headed Peter sat enthroned the five kinds of courage described by\r\nAristotle, and had the philosopher enumerated five hundred more, I verily\r\nbelieved he would have possessed them all. As to that better part of valor\r\ncalled discretion, it was too cold-blooded a virtue for his tropical\r\ntemperament.\r\n\r\nSummoning, therefore, to his presence his trusty follower, Antony Van\r\nCorlear, he commanded him to hold himself in readiness to accompany him\r\nthe following morning on this his hazardous enterprise.\r\n\r\nNow Antony the Trumpeter was by this time a little stricken in years, yet\r\nby dint of keeping up a good heart, and having never known care or sorrow\r\n(having never been married), he was still a hearty, jocund, rubicund,\r\ngamesome wag, and of great capacity in the doublet. This last was ascribed\r\nto his living a jolly life on those domains at the Hook, which Peter\r\nStuyvesant had granted to him for his gallantry at Fort Casimir.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, there was nothing that more delighted Antony than this\r\ncommand of the great Peter, for he could have followed the stout-hearted\r\nold governor to the world's end, with love and loyalty--and he moreover\r\nstill remembered the frolicing, and dancing, and bundling, and other\r\ndisports of the east country, and entertained dainty recollections of\r\nnumerous kind and buxom lasses, whom he longed exceedingly again to\r\nencounter.\r\n\r\nThus then did this mirror of hardihood set forth, with no other attendant\r\nbut his trumpeter, upon one of the most perilous enterprises ever\r\nrecorded in the annals of knight-errantry. For a single warrior to venture\r\nopenly among a whole nation of foes--but, above all, for a plain,\r\ndownright Dutchman to think of negotiating with the whole council of New\r\nEngland!--never was there known a more desperate undertaking! Ever since I\r\nhave entered upon the chronicles of this peerless, but hitherto\r\nuncelebrated, chieftain, has he kept me in a state of incessant action and\r\nanxiety with the toils and dangers he is constantly encountering. Oh, for\r\na chapter of the tranquil reign of Wouter Van Twiller, that I might repose\r\non it as on a feather-bed!\r\n\r\nIs it not enough, Peter Stuyvesant, that I have once already rescued thee\r\nfrom the machinations of these terrible Amphictyons, by bringing the\r\npowers of witchcraft to thine aid? Is it not enough that I have followed\r\nthee undaunted, like a guardian spirit, into the midst of the horrid\r\nbattle of Fort Christina? That I have been put incessantly to my trumps to\r\nkeep them safe and sound--now warding off with my single pen the shower of\r\ndastard blows that fell upon thy rear--now narrowly shielding thee from a\r\ndeadly thrust by a mere tobacco-box--now casing thy dauntless skull with\r\nadamant, when even thy stubborn ram beaver failed to resist the sword of\r\nthe stout Risingh--and now, not merely bringing thee off alive, but\r\ntriumphant, from the clutches of the gigantic Swede, by the desperate\r\nmeans of a paltry stone pottle? Is not all this enough, but must thou\r\nstill be plunging into new difficulties, and hazarding in headlong\r\nenterprises thyself, thy trumpeter, and thy historian?\r\n\r\nAnd now the ruddy-faced Aurora, like a buxom chambermaid, draws aside the\r\nsable curtains of the night, and out bounces from his bed the jolly\r\nred-haired Phoebus, startled at being caught so late in the embraces of\r\nDame Thetis. With many a stable-boy oath he harnesses his brazen-footed\r\nsteeds, and whips, and lashes, and splashes up the firmament, like a\r\nloitering coachman, half-an-hour behind his time. And now behold that imp\r\nof fame and prowess, the headstrong Peter, bestriding a raw-boned,\r\nswitch-tailed charger, gallantly arrayed in full regimentals, and bracing\r\non his thigh that trusty, brass-hilted sword, which had wrought such\r\nfearful deeds on the banks of the Delaware.\r\n\r\nBehold hard after him his doughty trumpeter, Van Corlear, mounted on a\r\nbroken-winded, walleyed, calico mare; his stone pottle, which had laid low\r\nthe mighty Risingh, slung under his arm; and his trumpet displayed\r\nvauntingly in his right hand, decorated with a gorgeous banner, on which\r\nis emblazoned the great beaver of the Manhattoes. See them proudly issuing\r\nout of the city gate, like an iron clad hero of yore, with his faithful\r\nsquire at his heels; the populace following with their eyes, and shouting\r\nmany a parting wish and hearty cheering, Farewell, Hardkoppig Piet!\r\nFarewell, honest Antony! pleasant be your wayfaring, prosperous your\r\nreturn!--the stoutest hero that ever drew a sword, and the worthiest\r\ntrumpeter that ever trod shoe-leather!\r\n\r\nLegends are lamentably silent about the events that befell our adventurers\r\nin this their adventurous travel, excepting the Stuyvesant manuscript,\r\nwhich gives the substance of a pleasant little heroic poem, written on the\r\noccasion by Dominie Ægidius Luyck,[58] who appears to have been the poet\r\nlaureate of New Amsterdam. This inestimable manuscript assures us that it\r\nwas a rare spectacle to behold the great Peter and his loyal follower\r\nhailing the morning sun, and rejoicing in the clear countenance of Nature,\r\nas they pranced it through the pastoral scenes of Bloemen Dael; which in\r\nthose days was a sweet and rural valley, beautiful with many a bright\r\nwild flower, refreshed by many a pure streamlet, and enlivened here and\r\nthere by a delectable little Dutch cottage, sheltered under some sloping\r\nhill, and almost buried in embowering trees.\r\n\r\nNow did they enter upon the confines of Connecticut, where they\r\nencountered many grievous difficulties and perils. At one place they were\r\nassailed by a troop of country squires and militia colonels, who, mounted\r\non goodly steeds, hung upon their rear for several miles, harassing them\r\nexceedingly with guesses and questions, more especially the worthy Peter,\r\nwhose silver-chased leg excited not a little marvel. At another place,\r\nhard by the renowned town of Stamford, they were set upon by a great and\r\nmighty legion of church deacons, who imperiously demanded of them five\r\nshillings for traveling on Sunday, and threatened to carry them captive to\r\na neighboring church, whose steeple peered above the trees; but these the\r\nvaliant Peter put to rout with little difficulty, insomuch that they\r\nbestrode their canes and galloped off in horrible confusion, leaving their\r\ncocked hats behind in the hurry of their flight. But not so easily did he\r\nescape from the hands of a crafty man of Pyquag; who, with undaunted\r\nperseverance and repeated onsets, fairly bargained him out of his goodly\r\nswitch-tailed charger, leaving in place thereof a villainous, foundered\r\nNarraganset pacer.\r\n\r\nBut, maugre all these hardships, they pursued their journey cheerily along\r\nthe course of the soft flowing Connecticut, whose gentle waves, says the\r\nsong, roll through many a fertile vale and sunny plain; now reflecting the\r\nlofty spires of the bustling city, and now the rural beauties of the\r\nhumble hamlet; now echoing with the busy hum of commerce, and now with the\r\ncheerful song of the peasant.\r\n\r\nAt every town would Peter Stuyvesant, who was noted for warlike punctilio,\r\norder the sturdy Antony to sound a courteous salutation; though the\r\nmanuscript observes that the inhabitants were thrown into great dismay\r\nwhen they heard of his approach. For the fame of his incomparable\r\nachievements on the Delaware had spread throughout the east country, and\r\nthey dreaded lest he had come to take vengeance on their manifold\r\ntransgressions.\r\n\r\nBut the good Peter rode through these towns with a smiling aspect, waving\r\nhis hand with inexpressible majesty and condescension; for he verily\r\nbelieved that the old clothes which these ingenious people had thrust into\r\ntheir broken windows, and the festoons of dried apples and peaches which\r\nornamented the fronts of their houses, were so many decorations in honor\r\nof his approach, as it was the custom in the days of chivalry to\r\ncompliment renowned heroes by sumptuous displays of tapestry and gorgeous\r\nfurniture. The women crowded to the doors to gaze upon him as he passed,\r\nso much does prowess in arms delight the gentler sex. The little children,\r\ntoo, ran after him in troops, staring with wonder at his regimentals, his\r\nbrimstone breeches, and the silver garniture of his wooden leg. Nor must I\r\nomit to mention the joy which many strapping wenches betrayed at beholding\r\nthe jovial Van Corlear, who had whilom delighted them so much with his\r\ntrumpet, when he bore the great Peter's challenge to the Amphictyons. The\r\nkind-hearted Antony alighted from his calico mare, and kissed them all\r\nwith infinite loving kindness, and was right pleased to see a crew of\r\nlittle trumpeters crowding round him for his blessing, each of whom he\r\npatted on the head, bade him be a good boy, and gave him a penny to buy\r\nmolasses candy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n   [58] This Luyck was, moreover, rector of the Latin School in\r\n        Nieuw Nederlands, 1663. There are two pieces addressed to Ægidius\r\n        Luyck in D. Selyn's MSS. of poesies, upon his marriage with\r\n        Judith Isendoorn. (Old MSS.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow so it happened, that while the great and good Peter Stuyvesant,\r\nfollowed by his trusty squire, was making his chivalric progress through\r\nthe east country, a dark and direful scheme of war against his beloved\r\nprovince was forming in that nursery of monstrous projects, the British\r\nCabinet.\r\n\r\nThis, we are confidently informed, was the result of the secret\r\ninstigations of the great council of the league; who, finding themselves\r\ntotally incompetent to vie in arms with the heavy-sterned warriors of the\r\nManhattoes and their iron-headed commander, sent emissaries to the British\r\nGovernment, setting forth in eloquent language the wonders and delights of\r\nthis delicious little Dutch Canaan, and imploring that a force might be\r\nsent out to invade it by sea, while they should co-operate by land.\r\n\r\nThese emissaries arrived at a critical juncture, just as the British Lion\r\nwas beginning to bristle up his mane and wag his tail; for we are assured\r\nby the anonymous writer of the Stuyvesant manuscript that the astounding\r\nvictory of Peter Stuyvesant at Fort Christina had resounded throughout\r\nEurope, and his annexation of the territory of New Sweden had awakened the\r\njealousy of the British Cabinet for their wild lands at the south. This\r\njealousy was brought to a head by the representations of Lord Baltimore,\r\nwho declared that the territory thus annexed lay within the lands granted\r\nto him by the British Crown, and he claimed to be protected in his rights.\r\nLord Sterling, another British subject, claimed the whole of Nassau, or\r\nLond Island, once the Ophir of William the Testy, but now the\r\nkitchen-garden of the Manhattoes, which he declared to be British\r\nterritory by the right of discovery, but unjustly usurped by the\r\nNederlanders.\r\n\r\nThe result of all these rumors and representations was a sudden zeal on\r\nthe part of his Majesty Charles the Second for the safety and well-being\r\nof his transatlantic possessions, and especially for the recovery of the\r\nNew Netherlands, which Yankee logic had, somehow or other, proved to be a\r\ncontinuity of the territory taken possession of for the British Crown by\r\nthe pilgrims when they landed on Plymouth Rock, fugitives from British\r\noppression. All this goodly land thus wrongfully held by the Dutchmen, he\r\npresented, in a fit of affection, to his brother the Duke of York, a\r\ndonation truly royal, since none but great sovereigns have a right to give\r\naway what does not belong to them. That this munificent gift might not be\r\nmerely nominal, his Majesty ordered that an armament should be straightway\r\ndespatched to invade the city of New Amsterdam by land and water, and put\r\nhis brother in complete possession of the premises.\r\n\r\nThus critically situated are the affairs of the New Nederlanders. While\r\nthe honest burghers are smoking their pipes in somber security, and the\r\nprivy councillors are snoring in the council chamber, while Peter the\r\nHeadstrong is undauntedly making his way through the east country, in the\r\nconfident hope by honest words and manly deeds to bring the grand council\r\nto terms, a hostile fleet is sweeping like a thunder-cloud across the\r\nAtlantic, soon to rattle a storm of war about the ears of the dozing\r\nNederlanders, and to put the mettle of their governor to the trial.\r\n\r\nBut come what may, I here pledge my veracity that in all warlike conflicts\r\nand doubtful perplexities he will every acquit himself like a gallant,\r\nnoble-minded, obstinate old cavalier. Forward, then, to the charge! Shine\r\nout, propitious stars, on the renowned city of the Manhattoes; and the\r\nblessing of St. Nicholas go with thee, honest Peter Stuyvesant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat nations resemble great men in this particular, that their greatness\r\nis seldom known until they get in trouble; adversity, therefore, has been\r\nwisely denominated the ordeal of true greatness, which, like gold, can\r\nnever receive its real estimation until it has passed through the furnace.\r\nIn proportion, therefore, as a nation, a community, or an individual\r\n(possessing the inherent quality of greatness) is involved in perils and\r\nmisfortunes, in proportion does it rise in grandeur; and even when sinking\r\nunder calamity, makes, like a house on fire, a more glorious display than\r\never it did in the fairest period of its prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe vast Empire of China, though teeming with population and imbibing and\r\nconcentrating the wealth of nations, has vegetated through a succession of\r\ndrowsy ages; and were it not for its internal revolution, and the\r\nsubversion of its ancient government by the Tartars, might have presented\r\nnothing but a dull detail of monotonous prosperity. Pompeii and\r\nHerculaneum might have passed into oblivion, with a herd of their\r\ncontemporaries, had they not been fortunately overwhelmed by a volcano.\r\nThe renowned city of Troy acquired celebrity only from its ten years'\r\ndistress and final conflagration. Paris rose in importance by the plots\r\nand massacres which ended in the exaltation of Napoleon; and even the\r\nmighty London has skulked through the records of time, celebrated for\r\nnothing of moment excepting the Plague, the Great Fire, and Guy Faux's\r\nGunpowder Plot! Thus cities and empires creep along, enlarging in silent\r\nobscurity, until they burst forth in some tremendous calamity, and snatch,\r\nas it were, immortality from the explosion.\r\n\r\nThe above principle being admitted, my reader will plainly perceive that\r\nthe city of New Amsterdam and its dependent province are on the high road\r\nto greatness. Dangers and hostilities threaten from every side, and it is\r\nreally a matter of astonishment how so small a State has been able in so\r\nshort a time to entangle itself in so many difficulties. Ever since the\r\nprovince was first taken by the nose, at the Fort of Good Hope, in the\r\ntranquil days of Wouter Van Twiller, has it been gradually increasing in\r\nhistoric importance: and never could it have had a more appropriate\r\nchieftain to conduct it to the pinnacle of grandeur than Peter Stuyvesant.\r\n\r\nThis truly headstrong hero having successfully effected his daring\r\nprogress through the east country, girded up his loins as he approached\r\nBoston, and prepared for the grand onslaught with the Amphictyons, which\r\nwas to be the crowning achievement of the campaign. Throwing Antony Van\r\nCorlear, who, with his calico mare, formed his escort and army, a little\r\nin the advance, and bidding him be of stout heart and great mind, he\r\nplaced himself firmly in his saddle, cocked his hat more fiercely over his\r\nleft eye, summoned all the heroism of his soul into his countenance, and,\r\nwith one arm akimbo, the hand resting on the pommel of his sword, rode\r\ninto the great metropolis of the league, Antony sounding his trumpet\r\nbefore him in a manner to electrify the whole community.\r\n\r\n\r\nNever was there such a stir in Boston as on this occasion; never such a\r\nhurrying hither and thither about the streets; such popping of heads out\r\nof windows; such gathering of knots in market-places Peter Stuyvesant was\r\na straightforward man, and prone to do everything above board. He would\r\nhave ridden at once to the great council-house of the league and sounded a\r\nparley; but the grand council knew the mettlesome hero they had to deal\r\nwith, and were not for doing things in a hurry. On the contrary, they sent\r\nforth deputations to meet him on the way, to receive him in a style\r\nbefitting the great potentate of the Manhattoes, and to multiply all\r\nkinds of honors, and ceremonies, and formalities, and other courteous\r\nimpediments in his path. Solemn banquets were accordingly given him, equal\r\nto thanksgiving feasts. Complimentary speeches were made him, wherein he\r\nwas entertained with the surpassing virtues, long sufferings, and\r\nachievements of the Pilgrim Fathers; and it is even said he was treated to\r\na sight of Plymouth Rock, that great corner-stone of Yankee empire.\r\n\r\nI will not detain my readers by recounting the endless devices by which\r\ntime was wasted, and obstacles and delays multiplied to the infinite\r\nannoyance of the impatient Peter. Neither will I fatigue them by dwelling\r\non his negotiations with the grand council, when he at length brought them\r\nto business. Suffice it to say, it was like most other diplomatic\r\nnegotiations; a great deal was said and very little done; one conversation\r\nled to another; one conference begot misunderstandings which it took a\r\ndozen conferences to explain, at the end of which both parties found\r\nthemselves just where they had begun, but ten times less likely to come to\r\nan agreement.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these perplexities, which bewildered the brain and\r\nincensed the ire of honest Peter, he received private intelligence of the\r\ndark conspiracy matured in the British Cabinet, with the astounding fact\r\nthat a British squadron was already on the way to invade New Amsterdam by\r\nsea, and that the grand council of Amphictyons, while thus beguiling him\r\nwith subtleties, were actually prepared to co-operate by land!\r\n\r\nOh! how did the sturdy old warrior rage and roar when he found himself\r\nthus entrapped, like a lion in the hunter's toil! Now did he draw his\r\ntrusty sword, and determine to break in upon the council of the\r\nAmphictyons, and put every mother's son of them to death. Now did he\r\nresolve to fight his way throughout all the regions of the east, and to\r\nlay waste Connecticut river.\r\n\r\nGallant, but unfortunate Peter! Did I not enter with sad forebodings on\r\nthis ill-starred expedition? Did I not tremble when I saw thee, with no\r\nother councillor than thine own head; no other armour but an honest\r\ntongue, a spotless conscience, and a rusty sword; no other protector but\r\nSt. Nicholas, and no other attendant but a trumpeter--did I not tremble\r\nwhen I beheld thee thus sally forth to contend with all the knowing powers\r\nof New England?\r\n\r\nIt was a long time before the kind-hearted expostulations of Antony Van\r\nCorlear, aided by the soothing melody of his trumpet, could lower the\r\nspirits of Peter Stuyvesant from their warlike and vindictive tone, and\r\nprevent his making widows and orphans of half the population of Boston.\r\nWith great difficulty he was prevailed upon to bottle up his wrath for the\r\npresent; to conceal from the council his knowledge of their machinations;\r\nand by effecting his escape, to be able to arrive in time for the\r\nsalvation of the Manhattoes.\r\n\r\nThe latter suggestion awakened a new ray of hope in his bosom; he\r\nforthwith dispatched a secret message to his councillors at New Amsterdam,\r\napprising them of their danger, and commanding them to put the city in a\r\nposture of defense, promising to come as soon as possible to their\r\nassistance. This done, he felt marvelously relieved, rose slowly, shook\r\nhimself like a rhinoceros, and issued forth from his den, in much the same\r\nmanner as Giant Despair is described to have issued from Doubting Castle,\r\nin the chivalric history of the Pilgrim's Progress.\r\n\r\nAnd now much does it grieve me that I must leave the gallant Peter in this\r\nimminent jeopardy; but it behooves us to hurry back and see what is going\r\non at New Amsterdam, for greatly do I fear that city is already in a\r\nturmoil. Such was ever the fate of Peter Stuyvesant; while doing one thing\r\nwith heart and soul he was too apt to leave everything else at sixes and\r\nsevens. While, like a potentate of yore, he was absent attending to those\r\nthings in person which in modern days are trusted to generals and\r\nambassadors, his little territory at home was sure to get in an\r\nuproar--all which was owing to that uncommon strength of intellect which\r\ninduced him to trust to nobody but himself, and which had acquired him the\r\nrenowned appellation of Peter the Headstrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no sight more truly interesting to a philosopher than a community\r\nwhere every individual has a voice in public affairs; where every\r\nindividual considers himself the Atlas of the nation; and where every\r\nindividual thinks it his duty to bestir himself for the good of his\r\ncountry--I say, there is nothing more interesting to a philosopher than\r\nsuch a community in a sudden bustle of war. Such clamor of tongues--such\r\npatriotic bawling--such running hither and thither--everybody in a\r\nhurry--everybody in trouble--everybody in the way, and everybody\r\ninterrupting his neighbor--who is busily employed in doing nothing! It is\r\nlike witnessing a great fire, where the whole community are agog--some\r\ndragging about empty engines, others scampering with full buckets, and\r\nspilling the contents into their neighbors' boots, and others ringing the\r\nchurch bells all night, by way of putting out the fire. Little firemen,\r\nlike sturdy little knights storming a breach, clambering up and down\r\nscaling-ladders, and bawling through tin trumpets, by way of directing the\r\nattack. Here a fellow, in his great zeal to save the property of the\r\nunfortunate, catches up some article of no value, and gallants it off with\r\nan air of as much self-importance as if he had rescued a pot of money;\r\nthere another throws looking-glasses and china out of the window, to save\r\nthem from the flames; whilst those who can do nothing else run up and down\r\nthe streets, keeping up an incessant cry of \"Fire! fire! fire!\"\r\n\r\n\"When the news arrived at Sinope,\" says Lucian--though I own the story is\r\nrather trite-\"that Philip was about to attack them, the inhabitants were\r\nthrown into a violent alarm. Some ran to furbish up their arms; others\r\nrolled stones to build up the walls; everybody, in short, was employed,\r\nand everybody in the way of his neighbor. Diogenes alone could find\r\nnothing to do; whereupon, not to be idle when the welfare of his country\r\nwas at stake, he tucked up his robe, and fell to rolling his tub with\r\nmight and main up and down the Gymnasium.\" In like manner did every\r\nmother's son in the patriotic community of New Amsterdam, on receiving the\r\nmissives of Peter Stuyvesant, busy himself most mightily in putting things\r\nin confusion, and assisting the general uproar. \"Every man,\" said the\r\nStuyvesant manuscript, \"flew to arms!\" by which is meant that not one of\r\nour honest Dutch citizens would venture to church or to market without an\r\nold-fashioned spit of a sword dangling at his side, and a long Dutch\r\nfowling-piece on his shoulder; nor would he go out of a night without a\r\nlantern, nor turn a corner without first peeping cautiously round, lest he\r\nshould come unawares upon a British army; and we are informed that Stoffel\r\nBrinkerhoff, who was considered by the old women almost as brave a man as\r\nthe governor himself, actually had two one-pound swivels mounted in his\r\nentry, one pointing out at the front door, and the other at the back.\r\n\r\nBut the most strenuous measure resorted to on this awful occasion, and one\r\nwhich has since been found of wonderful efficacy, was to assemble popular\r\nmeetings. These brawling convocations, I have already shown, were\r\nextremely offensive to Peter Stuyvesant; but as this was a moment of\r\nunusual agitation, and as the old governor was not present to repress\r\nthem, they broke out with intolerable violence. Hither, therefore, the\r\norators and politicians repaired, striving who should bawl loudest, and\r\nexceed the others in hyperbolical bursts of patriotism, and in resolutions\r\nto uphold and defend the government. In these sage meetings it was\r\nresolved that they were the most enlightened, the most dignified, the most\r\nformidable, and the most ancient community upon the face of the earth.\r\nThis resolution being carried unanimously, another was immediately\r\nproposed--whether it were not possible and politic to exterminate Great\r\nBritain? upon which sixty-nine members spoke in the affirmative, and only\r\none arose to suggest some doubts, who, as a punishment for his treasonable\r\npresumption, was immediately seized by the mob, and tarred and feathered,\r\nwhich punishment being equivalent to the Tarpeian Rock, he was afterwards\r\nconsidered as an outcast from society, and his opinion went for nothing.\r\nThe question, therefore, being unanimously carried in the affirmative, it\r\nwas recommended to the grand council to pass it into a law; which was\r\naccordingly done. By this measure the hearts of the people at large were\r\nwonderfully encouraged, and they waxed exceeding choleric and valorous.\r\nIndeed, the first paroxysm of alarm having in some measure subsided, the\r\nold women having buried all the money they could lay their hands on, and\r\ntheir husbands daily getting fuddled with what was left, the community\r\nbegan even to stand on the offensive. Songs were manufactured in Low\r\nDutch, and sung about the streets, wherein the English were most woefully\r\nbeaten, and shown no quarter; and popular addresses were made, wherein it\r\nwas proved to a certainty that the fate of Old England depended upon the\r\nwill of the New Amsterdammers.\r\n\r\nFinally, to strike a violent blow at the very vitals of Great Britain, a\r\nmultitude of the wiser inhabitants assembled, and having purchased all\r\nthe British manufactures they could find, they made thereof a huge\r\nbonfire, and in the patriotic glow of the moment, every man present who\r\nhad a hat or breeches of English workmanship pulled it off, and threw it\r\ninto the flames, to the irreparable detriment, loss and ruin of the\r\nEnglish manufacturers! In commemoration of this great exploit they erected\r\na pole on the spot, with a device on the top intended to represent the\r\nprovince of Nieuw Nederlandts destroying Great Britain, under the\r\nsimilitude of an eagle picking the little island of Old England out of the\r\nglobe; but either through the unskillfulness of the sculptor, or his\r\nill-timed waggery, it bore a striking resemblance to a goose vainly\r\nstriving to get hold of a dumpling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will need but little penetration in any one conversant with the ways of\r\nthat wise but windy potentate, the sovereign people, to discover that not\r\nwithstanding all the warlike bluster and bustle of the last chapter, the\r\ncity of New Amsterdam was not a whit more prepared for war than before.\r\nThe privy councillors of Peter Stuyvesant were aware of this; and, having\r\nreceived his private orders to put the city in an immediate posture of\r\ndefense, they called a meeting of the oldest and richest burghers to\r\nassist them with their wisdom. These were of that order of citizens\r\ncommonly termed \"men of the greatest weight in the community;\" their\r\nweight being estimated by the heaviness of their heads and of their\r\npurses. Their wisdom in fact is apt to be of a ponderous kind, and to hang\r\nlike a millstone round the neck of the community.\r\n\r\nTwo things were unanimously determined in this assembly of venerables:\r\nfirst, that the city required to be put in a state of defense; and second,\r\nthat, as the danger was imminent, there should be no time lost; which\r\npoints being settled, they fell to making long speeches, and belaboring\r\none another in endless and intemperate disputes. For about this time was\r\nthis unhappy city first visited by that talking endemic so prevalent in\r\nthis country, and which so invariably evinces itself wherever a number of\r\nwise men assemble together, breaking out in long windy speeches; caused,\r\nas physicians suppose, by the foul air which is ever generated in a crowd.\r\nNow it was, moreover, that they first introduced the ingenious method of\r\nmeasuring the merits of an harangue by the hour-glass, he being considered\r\nthe ablest orator who spoke longest on a question. For which excellent\r\ninvention, it is recorded, we are indebted to the same profound Dutch\r\ncritic who judged of books by their size.\r\n\r\nThis sudden passion for endless harangues, so little consonant with the\r\ncustomary gravity and taciturnity of our sage forefathers, was supposed by\r\ncertain philosophers to have been imbibed, together with divers other\r\nbarbarous propensities, from their savage neighbors, who were peculiarly\r\nnoted for long talks and council fires; and never undertook any affair of\r\nthe least importance without previous debates and harangues among their\r\nchiefs and old men. But the real cause was, that the people, in electing\r\ntheir representatives to the grand council, were particular in choosing\r\nthem for their talents at talking, without inquiring whether they\r\npossessed the more rare, difficult, and oft-times important talent of\r\nholding their tongues. The consequence was, that this deliberative body\r\nwas composed of the most loquacious men in the community. As they\r\nconsidered themselves placed there to talk, every man concluded that his\r\nduty to his constituents, and, what is more, his popularity with them,\r\nrequired that he should harangue on every subject, whether he understood\r\nit or not. There was an ancient mode of burying a chieftain, by every\r\nsoldier throwing his shield full of earth on the corpse, until a mighty\r\nmound was formed; so, whenever a question was brought forward in this\r\nassembly, every member pressing forward to throw on his quantum of wisdom,\r\nthe subject was quickly buried under a mountain of words.\r\n\r\nWe are told that disciples on entering the school of Pythagoras were for\r\ntwo years enjoined silence, and forbidden either to ask questions or make\r\nremarks. After they had thus acquired the inestimable art of holding their\r\ntongues they were gradually permitted to make inquiries, and finally to\r\ncommunicate their own opinions.\r\n\r\nWith what a beneficial effect could this wise regulation of Pythagoras be\r\nintroduced in modern legislative bodies--and how wonderfully would it have\r\ntended to expedite business in the grand council of the Manhattoes.\r\n\r\nAt this perilous juncture the fatal word economy, the stumbling block of\r\nWilliam the Testy, had been once more set afloat, according to which the\r\ncheapest plan of defense was insisted upon as the best; it being deemed a\r\ngreat stroke of policy in furnishing powder to economise in ball.\r\n\r\nThus old Dame Wisdom (whom the wags of antiquity have humorously\r\npersonified as a woman) seem to take a mischievous pleasure in jilting the\r\nvenerable councillors of New Amsterdam. To add to the confusion, the old\r\nfactions of Short Pipes and Long Pipes, which had been almost strangled by\r\nthe Herculean grasp of Peter Stuyvesant, now sprang up with tenfold vigor.\r\nWhatever was proposed by a Short Pipe was opposed by the whole tribe of\r\nLong Pipes, who, like true partisans, deemed it their first duty to effect\r\nthe downfall of their rivals, their second to elevate themselves, and\r\ntheir third to consult the public good; though many left the third\r\nconsideration out of question altogether.\r\n\r\nIn this great collision of hard heads it is astonishing the number of\r\nprojects that were struck out; projects which threw the windmill system of\r\nWilliam the Testy completely in the background. These were almost\r\nuniformly opposed by the \"men of the greatest weight in the community;\"\r\nyour weighty men, though slow to devise, being always great at\r\n\"negativing.\" Among these were a set of fat, self-important old burghers,\r\nwho smoked their pipes, and said nothing except to negative every plan of\r\ndefence proposed. These were that class of \"conservatives\" who, having\r\namassed a fortune, button up their pockets, shut their mouths, sink, as it\r\nwere, into themselves, and pass the rest of their lives in the indwelling\r\nbeatitude of conscious wealth; as some phlegmatic oyster, having swallowed\r\na pearl, closes its shell, sinks in the mud, and devotes the rest of its\r\nlife to the conservation of its treasure. Every plan of defence seemed to\r\nthese worthy old gentlemen pregnant with ruin. An armed force was a legion\r\nof locusts preying upon the public property; to fit out a naval armament\r\nwas to throw their money into the sea; to build fortifications was to bury\r\nit in the dirt. In short, they settled it as a sovereign maxim, so long as\r\ntheir pockets were full, no matter how much they were drubbed. A kick left\r\nno scar; a broken head cured itself; but an empty purse was of all\r\nmaladies the slowest to heal, and one in which nature did nothing for the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\nThus did this venerable assembly of sages lavish away their time, which\r\nthe urgency of affairs rendered invaluable, in empty brawls and\r\nlong-winded speeches, without ever agreeing, except on the point with\r\nwhich they started, namely, that there was no time to be lost, and delay\r\nwas ruinous. At length, St. Nicholas taking compassion on their distracted\r\nsituation, and anxious to preserve them from anarchy, so ordered, that in\r\nthe midst of one of their most noisy debates on the subject of\r\nfortification and defence, when they had nearly fallen to loggerheads in\r\nconsequence of not being able to convince each other, the question was\r\nhappily settled by the sudden entrance of a messenger, who informed them\r\nthat a hostile fleet had arrived, and was actually advancing up the bay!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nLike as an assemblage of belligerent cats, gibbering and caterwauling,\r\neyeing one another with hideous grimaces and contortions, spitting in each\r\nother's faces, and on the point of a general clapper-clawing, are suddenly\r\nput to scampering rout and confusion by the appearance of a house-dog, so\r\nwas the no less vociferous council of New Amsterdam amazed, astounded, and\r\ntotally dispersed by the sudden arrival of the enemy. Every member waddled\r\nhome as fast as his short legs could carry him, wheezing as he went with\r\ncorpulency and terror. Arrived at his castle, he barricaded the\r\nstreet-door, and buried himself in the cider-cellar, without venturing to\r\npeep out, lest he should have his head carried off by a cannon ball.\r\n\r\nThe sovereign people crowded into the marketplace, herding together with\r\nthe instinct of sheep, who seek safety in each other's company when the\r\nshepherd and his dog are absent, and the wolf is prowling round the fold.\r\nFar from finding relief, however, they only increased each other's\r\nterrors. Each man looked ruefully in his neighbor's face, in search of\r\nencouragement, but only found in its woebegone lineaments a confirmation\r\nof his own dismay. Not a word now was to be heard of conquering Great\r\nBritain, not a whisper about the sovereign virtues of economy--while the\r\nold women heightened the general gloom by clamorously bewailing their\r\nfate, and calling for protection on St. Nicholas and Peter Stuyvesant.\r\n\r\nOh, how did they bewail the absence of the lion-hearted Peter! and how\r\ndid they long for the comforting presence of Antony Van Corlear! Indeed a\r\ngloomy uncertainty hung over the fate of these adventurous heroes. Day\r\nafter day had elapsed since the alarming message from the governor without\r\nbringing any further tidings of his safety. Many a fearful conjecture was\r\nhazarded as to what had befallen him and his loyal squire. Had they not\r\nbeen devoured alive by the cannibals of Marblehead and Cape Cod? Had they\r\nnot been put to the question by the great council of Amphictyons? Had they\r\nnot been smothered in onions by the terrible men of Pyquag? In the midst\r\nof this consternation and perplexity, when horror, like a mighty\r\nnightmare, sat brooding upon the little, fat, plethoric city of New\r\nAmsterdam, the ears of the multitude were suddenly startled by the distant\r\nsound of a trumpet;--it approached--it grew louder and louder--and now it\r\nresounded at the city gate. The public could not be mistaken in the\r\nwell-known sound; a shout of joy burst from their lips as the gallant\r\nPeter, covered with dust, and followed by his faithful trumpeter, came\r\ngalloping into the marketplace.\r\n\r\nThe first transports of the populace having subsided, they gathered round\r\nthe honest Antony, as he dismounted, overwhelming him with greetings and\r\ncongratulations. In breathless accents, he related to them the marvelous\r\nadventures through which the old governor and himself had gone, in making\r\ntheir escape from the clutches of the terrible Amphictyons. But though the\r\nStuyvesant manuscript, with its customary minuteness where anything\r\ntouching the great Peter is concerned, is very particular as to the\r\nincidents of this masterly retreat, the state of the public affairs will\r\nnot allow me to indulge in a full recital thereof. Let it suffice to say,\r\nthat, while Peter Stuyvesant was anxiously revolving in his mind how he\r\ncould make good his escape with honor and dignity, certain of the ships\r\nsent out for the conquest of the Manhattoes touched at the eastern ports\r\nto obtain supplies, and to call on the grand council of the league for its\r\npromised co-operation. Upon hearing of this, the vigilant Peter,\r\nperceiving that a moment's delay were fatal, made a secret and precipitate\r\ndecampment, though much did it grieve his lofty soul to be obliged to turn\r\nhis back even upon a nation of foes. Many hair-breadth escapes and divers\r\nperilous mishaps did they sustain, as they scourged, without sound of\r\ntrumpet, through the fair regions of the east. Already was the country in\r\nan uproar with hostile preparation, and they were obliged to take a large\r\ncircuit in their flight, lurking along through the woody mountains of the\r\nDevil's Backbone; whence the valiant Peter sallied forth, one day like a\r\nlion, and put to rout a whole legion of squatters, consisting of three\r\ngenerations of a prolific family, who were already on their way to take\r\npossession of some corner of the New Netherlands. Nay, the faithful Antony\r\nhad great difficulty, at sundry times, to prevent him, in the excess of\r\nhis wrath, from descending down from the mountains, and falling, sword in\r\nhand, upon certain of the border-towns, who were marshaling forth their\r\ndraggle-tailed militia.\r\n\r\nThe first movement of the governor, on reaching his dwelling, was to mount\r\nthe roof, whence he contemplated with rueful aspect the hostile squadron.\r\nThis had already come to anchor in the bay, and consisted of two stout\r\nfrigates, having on board, as John Josselyn, gent., informs us, \"three\r\nhundred valiant red coats.\" Having taken this survey, he sat himself down,\r\nand wrote an epistle to the commander, demanding the reason of his\r\nanchoring in the harbor without obtaining previous permission so to do.\r\nThis letter was couched in the most dignified and courteous terms, though\r\nI have it from undoubted authority that his teeth were clinched, and he\r\nhad a bitter sardonic grin upon his visage all the while he wrote. Having\r\ndespatched his letter, the grim Peter stumped to and fro about the town,\r\nwith a most war-betokening countenance, his hands thrust into his breeches\r\npockets, and whistling a low Dutch psalm-tune, which bore no small\r\nresemblance to the music of a northeast wind, when a storm is brewing. The\r\nvery dogs, as they eyed him, skulked away in dismay; while all the old and\r\nugly women of New Amsterdam ran howling at his heels, imploring him to\r\nsave them from murder, robbery, and pitiless ravishment!\r\n\r\nThe reply of Colonel Nicholas, who commanded the invaders, was couched in\r\nterms of equal courtesy with the letter of the governor, declaring the\r\nright and title of his British Majesty to the province, where he affirmed\r\nthe Dutch to be mere interlopers; and demanding that the town, forts,\r\netc., should be forthwith rendered into his majesty's obedience and\r\nprotection; promising at the same time, life, liberty, estate, and free\r\ntrade, to every Dutch denizen who should readily submit to his Majesty's\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nPeter Stuyvesant read over this friendly epistle with some such harmony of\r\naspect as we may suppose a crusty farmer reads the loving letter of John\r\nStiles, warning him of an action of ejectment. He was not, however, to be\r\ntaken by surprise; but, thrusting the summons into his breeches pocket,\r\nstalked three times across the room, took a pinch of snuff with great\r\nvehemence, and then, loftily waving his hand, promised to send an answer\r\nthe next morning. He now summoned a general meeting of his privy\r\ncouncillors and burgomasters, not to ask their advice, for confident in\r\nhis own strong head, he needed no man's counsel, but apparently to give\r\nthem a piece of his mind on their late craven conduct.\r\n\r\nHis orders being duly promulgated, it was a piteous sight to behold the\r\nlate valiant burgomasters, who had demolished the whole British empire in\r\ntheir harangues, peeping ruefully out of their hiding-places; crawling\r\ncautiously forth; dodging through narrow lanes and alleys; starting at\r\nevery little dog that barked; mistaking lamp-posts for British grenadiers;\r\nand, in the excess of their panic, metamorphosing pumps into formidable\r\nsoldiers, levelling blunderbusses at their bosoms! Having, however, in\r\ndespite of numerous perils and difficulties of the kind, arrived safe,\r\nwithout the loss of a single man, at the hall of assembly, they took their\r\nseats, and awaited in fearful silence the arrival of the governor. In a\r\nfew moments the wooden leg of the intrepid Peter was heard in regular and\r\nstout-hearted thumps upon the staircase. He entered the chamber, arrayed\r\nin full suit of regimentals, and carrying his trusty toledo, not girded on\r\nhis thigh, but tucked under his arm. As the governor never equipped\r\nhimself in this portentious manner unless something of martial nature were\r\nworking within his pericranium, his council regarded him ruefully, as if\r\nthey saw fire and sword in his iron countenance, and forgot to light their\r\npipes in breathless suspense.\r\n\r\nHis first words were to rate his council soundly for having wasted in idle\r\ndebate and party feud the time which should have been devoted to putting\r\nthe city in a state of defence. He was particularly indignant at those\r\nbrawlers who had disgraced the councils of the province by empty\r\nbickerings and scurrilous invectives against an absent enemy. He now\r\ncalled upon them to make good their words by deeds, as the enemy they had\r\ndefied and derided was at the gate. Finally, he informed them of the\r\nsummons he had received to surrender, but concluded by swearing to defend\r\nthe province as long as Heaven was on his side, and he had a wooden leg to\r\nstand upon; which warlike sentence he emphasized by a thwack with the flat\r\nof his sword upon the table that quite electrified his auditors.\r\n\r\nThe privy councillors who had long since been brought into as perfect\r\ndiscipline as were ever the soldiers of the great Frederick, knew there\r\nwas no use in saying a word, so lighted their pipes, and smoked away in\r\nsilence like fat and discreet councillors. But the burgomasters, being\r\ninflated with considerable importance and self-sufficiency acquired at\r\npopular meetings, were not so easily satisfied. Mustering up fresh spirit,\r\nwhen they found there was some chance of escaping from their present\r\njeopardy without the disagreeable alternative of fighting, they requested\r\na copy of the summons to surrender, that they might show it to a general\r\nmeeting of the people.\r\n\r\nSo insolent and mutinous a request would have been enough to have roused\r\nthe gorge of the tranquil Van Twiller himself--what, then, must have been\r\nits effect upon the great Stuyvesant, who was not only a Dutchman, a\r\ngovernor, and a valiant wooden-legged soldier to boot, but withal a man of\r\nthe most stomachful and gunpowder disposition? He burst forth into a blaze\r\nof indignation--swore not a mother's son of them should see a syllable of\r\nit; that as to their advice or concurrence, he did not care a whiff of\r\ntobacco for either; that they might go home and go to bed like old women,\r\nfor he was determined to defend the colony himself without the assistance\r\nof them or their adherents! So saying, he tucked his sword under his arm,\r\ncocked his hat upon his head, and girding up his loins, stumped\r\nindignantly out of the council chamber, everybody making room for him as\r\nhe passed.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was he gone than the busy burgomasters called a public meeting\r\nin front of the stadthouse, where they appointed as chairman one Dofue\r\nRoerback, formerly a meddlesome member of the cabinet during the reign of\r\nWilliam the Testy, but kicked out of office by Peter Stuyvesant on taking\r\nthe reins of government. He was, withal, a mighty gingerbread baker in the\r\nland, and reverenced by the populace as a man of dark knowledge, seeing\r\nthat he was the first to imprint New-year cakes with the mysterious\r\nhieroglyphics of the Cock and Breeches, and such-like magical devices.\r\n\r\nThis burgomaster, who still chewed the cud of ill-will against Peter\r\nStuyvesant, addressed the multitude in what is called a patriotic speech,\r\ninforming them of the courteous summons which the governor had received to\r\nsurrender, of his refusal to comply therewith, and of his denying the\r\npublic even a sight of the summons, which doubtless contained conditions\r\nhighly to the honor and advantage of the province.\r\n\r\nHe then proceeded to speak of his excellency in high-sounding terms of\r\nvituperation, suited to the dignity of his station; comparing him to Nero,\r\nCaligula, and other flagrant great men of yore; assuring the people that\r\nthe history of the world did not contain a despotic outrage equal to the\r\npresent; that it would be recorded in letters of fire on the blood-stained\r\ntablet of history; that ages would roll back with sudden horror when they\r\ncame to view it; that the womb of time (by the way, your orators and\r\nwriters take strange liberties with the womb of time, though some would\r\nfain have us believe that time is an old gentleman)--that the womb of\r\ntime, pregnant as it was with direful horrors, would never produce a\r\nparallel enormity: with a variety of other heart-rending, soul-stirring\r\ntropes and figures, which I cannot enumerate; neither, indeed, need I, for\r\nthey were of the kind which even to the present day form the style of\r\npopular harangues and patriotic orations, and may be classed in rhetoric\r\nunder the general title of Rigmarole.\r\n\r\nThe result of this speech of the inspired burgomaster was a memorial\r\naddressed to the governor, remonstrating in good round terms on his\r\nconduct. It was proposed that Dofue Roerback himself should be the bearer\r\nof this memorial; but this he warily declined, having no inclination of\r\ncoming again within kicking distance of his excellency. Who did deliver\r\nit has never been named in history; in which neglect he has suffered\r\ngrievous wrong, seeing that he was equally worthy of blazon with him\r\nperpetuated in Scottish song and story by the surname of Bell-the-cat. All\r\nwe know of the fate of this memorial is, that it was used by the grim\r\nPeter to light his pipe, which, from the vehemence with which he smoked\r\nit, was evidently anything but a pipe of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow did the high-minded Peter de Groodt shower down a pannier load of\r\nmaledictions upon his burgomaster for a set of self-willed, obstinate,\r\nfactious varlets, who would neither be convinced nor persuaded. Nor did he\r\nomit to bestow some left-handed compliments upon the sovereign people, as\r\na heard of poltroons, who had no relish for the glorious hardships and\r\nillustrious misadventures of battle, but would rather stay at home, and\r\neat and sleep in ignoble ease, than fight in a ditch for immortality and a\r\nbroken head.\r\n\r\nResolutely bent, however, upon defending his beloved city, in despite even\r\nof itself, he called unto him his trusty Van Corlear, who was his\r\nright-hand man in all times of emergency. Him did he adjure to take his\r\nwar-denouncing trumpet, and mounting his horse, to beat up the country\r\nnight and day--sounding the alarm along the pastoral border of the\r\nBronx--startling the wild solitudes of Croton--arousing the rugged\r\nyeomanry of Weehawk and Hoboken--the mighty men of battle of Tappan\r\nBay--and the brave boys of Tarry-Town, Petticoat-Lane, and\r\nSleepy-Hollow--charging them one and all to sling their powder-horns,\r\nshoulder their fowling-pieces, and march merrily down to the Manhattoes.\r\n\r\nNow there was nothing in all the world, the divine sex excepted, that\r\nAntony Van Corlear loved better than errands of this kind. So just\r\nstopping to take a lusty dinner, and bracing to his side his junk bottle,\r\nwell charged with heart-inspiring Hollands, he issued jollily from the\r\ncity gate, which looked out upon what is at present called Broadway;\r\nsounding a farewell strain, that rung in sprightly echoes through the\r\nwinding streets of New Amsterdam. Alas! never more were they to be\r\ngladdened by the melody of their favorite trumpeter.\r\n\r\nIt was a dark and stormy night when the good Antony arrived at the creek\r\n(sagely denominated Haerlem river) which separates the island of\r\nManna-hata from the mainland. The wind was high, the elements were in an\r\nuproar, and no Charon could be found to ferry the adventurous sounder of\r\nbrass across the water. For a short time he vapored like an impatient\r\nghost upon the brink, and then, bethinking himself of the urgency of his\r\nerrand, took a hearty embrace of his stone bottle, swore most valorously\r\nthat he would swim across in spite of the devil (_spyt den duyvel_), and\r\ndaringly plunged into the stream. Luckless Antony! scarce had he buffeted\r\nhalf-way over when he was observed to struggle violently, as if battling\r\nwith the spirit of the waters. Instinctively he put his trumpet to his\r\nmouth, and giving a vehement blast sank for ever to the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe clangor of his trumpet, like that of the ivory horn of the renowned\r\nPaladin Orlando, when expiring in the glorious field of Roncesvalles, rang\r\nfar and wide through the country, alarming the neighbors round, who\r\nhurried in amazement to the spot. Here an old Dutch burgher, famed for his\r\nveracity, and who had been a witness of the fact, related to them the\r\nmelancholy affair; with the fearful addition (to which I am slow of giving\r\nbelief) that he saw the duyvel, in the shape of a huge mossbonker, seize\r\nthe sturdy Antony by the leg and drag him beneath the waves. Certain it\r\nis, the place, with the adjoining promontory, which projects into the\r\nHudson, has been called _Spyt den Duyvel_ ever since; the ghost of the\r\nunfortunate Antony still haunts the surrounding solitudes, and his trumpet\r\nhas often been heard by the neighbors of a stormy night, mingling with the\r\nhowling of the blast.\r\n\r\nNobody ever attempts to swim across the creek after dark; on the contrary,\r\na bridge has been built to guard against such melancholy accidents in the\r\nfuture; and as to moss-bonkers, they are held in such abhorrence that no\r\ntrue Dutchman will admit them to his table who loves good fish and hates\r\nthe devil.\r\n\r\nSuch was the end of Antony Van Corlear--a man deserving of a better fate.\r\nHe lived roundly and soundly, like a true and jolly bachelor, until the\r\nday of his death; but though he was never married, yet did he leave behind\r\nsome two or three dozen children in different parts of the country--fine,\r\nchubby, brawling, flatulent little urchins, from whom, if legends speak\r\ntrue (and they are not apt to lie), did descend the innumerable race of\r\neditors who people and defend this country, and who are bountifully paid\r\nby the people for keeping up a constant alarm and making them miserable.\r\nIt is hinted, too, that in his various expeditions into the east he did\r\nmuch towards promoting the population of the country, in proof of which is\r\nadduced the notorious propensity of the people of those parts to sound\r\ntheir own trumpet.\r\n\r\nAs some way-worn pilgrim, when the tempest whistles through his locks, and\r\nnight is gathering round, beholds his faithful dog, the companion and\r\nsolace of his journeying, stretched lifeless at his feet, so did the\r\ngenerous-hearted hero of the Manhattoes contemplate the untimely end of\r\nAntony Van Corlear. He had been the faithful attendant of his footsteps;\r\nhe had charmed him in many a weary hour by his honest gayety and the\r\nmartial melody of his trumpet, and had followed him with unflinching\r\nloyalty and affection through many a scene of direful peril and mishap. He\r\nwas gone for ever! and that, too, at a moment when every mongrel cur was\r\nskulking from his side. This, Peter Stuyvesant, was the moment to try thy\r\nfortitude; and this was the moment when thou didst indeed shine\r\nforth--Peter the Headstrong!\r\n\r\nThe glare of day had long dispelled the horrors of the stormy night; still\r\nall was dull and gloomy. The late jovial Apollo hid his face behind\r\nlugubrious clouds, peeping out now and then for an instant, as if anxious,\r\nyet fearful, to see what was going on in his favorite city. This was the\r\neventful morning when the Great Peter was to give his reply to the summons\r\nof the invaders. Already was he closeted with his privy council, sitting\r\nin grim state, brooding over the fate of his favorite trumpeter, and anon\r\nboiling with indignation as the insolence of his recreant burgomasters\r\nflashed upon his mind. While in this state of irritation, a courier\r\narrived in all haste from Winthrop, the subtle governor of Connecticut,\r\ncounseling him, in the most affectionate and disinterested manner, to\r\nsurrender the province, and magnifying the dangers and calamities to which\r\na refusal would subject him. What a moment was this to intrude officious\r\nadvice upon a man who never took advice in his whole life! The fiery old\r\ngovernor strode up and down the chamber with a vehemence that made the\r\nbosoms of his councillors to quake with awe; railing at his unlucky fate,\r\nthat thus made him the constant butt of factious subjects and jesuitical\r\nadvisers.\r\n\r\nJust at this ill-chosen juncture the officious burgomasters, who had heard\r\nof the arrival of mysterious despatches, came marching in a body into the\r\nroom, with a legion of schepens and toad-eaters at their heels, and\r\nabruptly demanded a perusal of the letter. This was too much for the\r\nspleen of Peter Stuyvesant. He tore the letter in a thousand pieces--threw\r\nit in the face of the nearest burgomaster--broke his pipe over the head\r\nof the next--hurled his spitting-box at an unlucky schepen, who was just\r\nretreating out at the door; and finally prorogued the whole meeting _sine\r\ndie_, by kicking them downstairs with his wooden leg.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the burgomasters could recover from their confusion, and had\r\ntime to breathe, they called a public meeting, where they related at full\r\nlength, and with appropriate coloring and exaggeration, the despotic and\r\nvindictive deportment of the governor, declaring that, for their own\r\nparts, they did not value a straw the being kicked, cuffed, and mauled by\r\nthe timber toe of his excellency, but that they felt for the dignity of\r\nthe sovereign people, thus rudely insulted by the outrage committed on the\r\nseat of honor of their representatives. The latter part of the harangue\r\ncame home at once to that delicacy of feeling and jealous pride of\r\ncharacter vested in all true mobs; who, though they may bear injuries\r\nwithout a murmur, yet are marvelously jealous of their sovereign dignity;\r\nand there is no knowing to what act of resentment they might have been\r\nprovoked, had they not been somewhat more afright of their sturdy old\r\ngovernor than they were of St. Nicholas, the English, or the d----l\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is something exceedingly sublime and melancholy in the spectacle\r\nwhich the present crisis of our history presents. An illustrious and\r\nvenerable little city--the metropolis of a vast extent of uninhabited\r\ncountry--garrisoned by a doughty host of orators, chairmen, committee-men,\r\nburgomasters, schepens, and old women--governed by a determined and\r\nstrong-headed warrior, and fortified by mud batteries, palisadoes, and\r\nresolutions--blockaded by sea, beleaguered by land, and threatened with\r\ndireful desolation from without; while its very vitals are torn with\r\ninternal faction and commotion! Never did historic pen record a page of\r\nmore complicated distress, unless it be the strife that distracted the\r\nIsraelites during the siege of Jerusalem, where discordant parties were\r\ncutting each other's throats at the moment when the victorious legions of\r\nTitus had toppled down their bulwarks, and were carrying fire and sword\r\ninto the very _sanctum sanctorum_ of the temple!\r\n\r\nGovernor Stuyvesant having triumphantly put his grand council to the rout,\r\nand delivered himself from a multitude of impertinent advisers, despatched\r\na categorical reply to the commanders of the invading squadron, wherein he\r\nasserted the right and title of their High Mightinesses the Lords States\r\nGeneral to the province of New Netherlands, and trusting in the\r\nrighteousness of his cause, set the whole British nation at defiance!\r\n\r\nMy anxiety to extricate my readers and myself from these disastrous scenes\r\nprevents me from giving the whole of this gallant letter, which concluded\r\nin these manly and affectionate terms:----\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"As touching the threats in your conclusion, we have nothing to\r\n    answer, only that we fear nothing but what God (who is as just as\r\n    merciful) shall lay upon us; all things being in His gracious\r\n    disposal, and we may as well be preserved by Him with small\r\n    forces as by a great army, which makes us to wish you all\r\n    happiness and prosperity, and recommend you to His\r\n    protection.--My lords, your thrice humble and affectionate\r\n    servant and friend,\r\n\r\n    \"P. STUYVESANT.\"\r\n\r\nThus having thrown his gauntlet, the brave Peter stuck a pair of\r\nhorse-pistols in his belt, girded an immense powder-horn on his side,\r\nthrust his sound leg into a Hessian boot, and clapping his fierce little\r\nwar-hat on the top of his head, paraded up and down in front of his house,\r\ndetermined to defend his beloved city to the last.\r\n\r\nWhile all these struggles and dissentions were prevailing in the unhappy\r\ncity of New Amsterdam, and while its worthy but ill-starred governor was\r\nframing the above quoted letter, the English commanders did not remain\r\nidle. They had agents secretly employed to foment the fears and clamors of\r\nthe populace; and moreover circulated far and wide through the adjacent\r\ncountry a proclamation, repeating the terms they had already held out in\r\ntheir summons to surrender, at the same time beguiling the simple\r\nNederlanders with the most crafty and conciliating professions. They\r\npromised that every man who voluntarily submitted to the authority of his\r\nBritish Majesty should retain peaceful possession of his house, his vrouw,\r\nand his cabbage-garden. That he should be suffered to smoke his pipe,\r\nspeak Dutch, wear as many beeches as he pleased, and import bricks, tiles,\r\nand stone jugs from Holland, instead of manufacturing them on the spot.\r\nThat he should on no account be compelled to learn the English language,\r\nnor eat codfish on Saturdays, nor keep accounts in any other way than by\r\ncasting them up on his fingers, and chalking them down upon the crown of\r\nhis hat; as is observed among the Dutch yeomanry at the present day. That\r\nevery man should be allowed quietly to inherit his father's hat, coat,\r\nshoe-buckles, pipe, and every other personal appendage; and that no man\r\nshould be obliged to conform to any improvements, inventions, or any other\r\nmodern innovations; but, on the contrary, should be permitted to build his\r\nhouse, follow his trade, manage his farm, rear his hogs, and educate his\r\nchildren, precisely as his ancestors had done before him from time\r\nimmemorial. Finally, that he should have all the benefits of free trade,\r\nand should not be required to acknowledge any other saint in the calendar\r\nthan St. Nicholas, who should thenceforward, as before, be considered the\r\ntutelar saint of the city.\r\n\r\nThese terms, as may be supposed, appeared very satisfactory to the people,\r\nwho had a great disposition to enjoy their property unmolested, and a most\r\nsingular aversion to engage in a contest, where they could gain little\r\nmore than honor and broken heads: the first of which they held in\r\nphilosophic indifference, the latter in utter detestation. By these\r\ninsidious means, therefore, did the English succeed in alienating the\r\nconfidence and affections of the populace from their gallant old governor,\r\nwhom they considered as obstinately bent upon running them into hideous\r\nmisadventures; and did not hesitate to speak their minds freely, and abuse\r\nhim most heartily, behind his back.\r\n\r\nLike as a mighty grampus, when assailed and buffeted by roaring waves and\r\nbrawling surges, still keeps on an undeviating course, rising above the\r\nboisterous billows, spouting and blowing as he emerges, so did the\r\ninflexible Peter pursue, unwavering, his determined career, and rise,\r\ncontemptuous, above the clamors of the rabble.\r\n\r\nBut when the British warriors found that he set their power at defiance,\r\nthey despatched recruiting officers to Jamaica, and Jericho, and Nineveh,\r\nand Quag, and Patchog, and all those towns on Long Island which had been\r\nsubdued of yore by Stoffel Brinkerhoff, stirring up the progeny of\r\nPreserved Fish and Determined Cock, and those other New England squatters,\r\nto assail the city of New Amsterdam by land, while the hostile ships\r\nprepared for an assault by water.\r\n\r\nThe streets of New Amsterdam now presented a scene of wild dismay and\r\nconsternation. In vain did Peter Stuyvesant order the citizens to arm and\r\nassemble on the Battery. Blank terror reigned over the community. The\r\nwhole party of Short Pipes in the course of a single night had changed\r\ninto arrant old women--a metamorphosis only to be paralleled by the\r\nprodigies recorded by Livy as having happened at Rome at the approach of\r\nHannibal, when statues sweated in pure affright, goats were converted into\r\nsheep, and cocks, turning into hens, ran cackling about the street.\r\n\r\nThus baffled in all attempts to put the city in a state of defence,\r\nblockaded from without, tormented from within, and menaced with a Yankee\r\ninvasion, even the stiff-necked will of Peter Stuyvesant for once gave\r\nway, and in spite of his mighty heart, which swelled in his throat until\r\nit nearly choked him, he consented to a treaty of surrender.\r\n\r\nWords cannot express the transports of the populace on receiving this\r\nintelligence; had they obtained a conquest over their enemies, they could\r\nnot have indulged greater delight. The streets resounded with their\r\ncongratulations--they extolled their governor as the father and deliverer\r\nof his country--they crowded to his house to testify their gratitude, and\r\nwere ten times more noisy in their plaudits than when he returned, with\r\nvictory perched upon his beaver, from the glorious capture of Fort\r\nChristina. But the indignant Peter shut his doors and windows, and took\r\nrefuge in the innermost recesses of his mansion, that he might not hear\r\nthe ignoble rejoicings of the rabble.\r\n\r\nCommissioners were now appointed on both sides, and a capitulation was\r\nspeedily arranged; all that was wanting to ratify it was that it should be\r\nsigned by the governor. When the commissioners waited upon him for this\r\npurpose they were received with grim and bitter courtesy. His warlike\r\naccoutrements were laid aside; an old Indian night-gown was wrapped about\r\nhis rugged limbs; a red nightcap overshadowed his frowning brow; an\r\niron-grey beard of three days' growth gave additional grimness to his\r\nvisage. Thrice did he seize a worn-out stump of a pen, and essay to sign\r\nthe loathsome paper; thrice did he clinch his teeth, and make a horrible\r\ncountenance, as though a dose of rhubarb-senna, and ipecacuanha, had been\r\noffered to his lips. At length, dashing it from him, he seized his\r\nbrass-hilted sword, and jerking it from the scabbard, swore by St.\r\nNicholas to sooner die than yield to any power under heaven.\r\n\r\nFor two whole days did he persist in this magnanimous resolution, during\r\nwhich his house was besieged by the rabble, and menaces and clamorous\r\nrevilings exhausted to no purpose. And now another course was adopted to\r\nsoothe, if possible, his mighty ire. A procession was formed by the\r\nburgomasters and schepens, followed by the populace, to bear the\r\ncapitulation in state to the governor's dwelling. They found the castle\r\nstrongly barricaded, and the old hero in full regimentals, with his cocked\r\nhat on his head, posted with a blunderbuss at the garret window.\r\n\r\nThere was something in this formidable position that struck even the\r\nignoble vulgar with awe and admiration. The brawling multitude could not\r\nbut reflect with self-abasement upon their own pusillanimous conduct, when\r\nthey beheld their hardy but deserted old governor, thus faithful to his\r\npost, like a forlorn hope, and fully prepared to defend his ungrateful\r\ncity to the last. These compunctions, however, were soon overwhelmed by\r\nthe recurring tide of public apprehension. The populace arranged\r\nthemselves before the house, taking off their hats with most respectful\r\nhumility; Burgomaster Roerback, who was of that popular class of orators\r\ndescribed by Sallust as being \"talkative rather than eloquent,\" stepped\r\nforth and addressed the governor in a speech of three hours' length,\r\ndetailing, in the most pathetic terms, the calamitous situation of the\r\nprovince, and urging him, in a constant repetition of the same arguments\r\nand words, to sign the capitulation.\r\n\r\nThe mighty Peter eyed him from his garret window in grim silence. Now and\r\nthen his eye would glance over the surrounding rabble, and an indignant\r\ngrin, like that of an angry mastiff, would mark his iron visage. But\r\nthough a man of most undaunted mettle--though he had a heart as big as an\r\nox, and a head that would have set adamant to scorn--yet after all he was\r\na mere mortal. Wearied out by these repeated oppositions, and this eternal\r\nharanguing, and perceiving that unless he complied the inhabitants would\r\nfollow their own inclination, or rather their fears, without waiting for\r\nhis consent; or, what was still worse, the Yankees would have time to pour\r\nin their forces and claim a share in the conquest, he testily ordered them\r\nto hand up the paper. It was accordingly hoisted to him on the end of a\r\npole, and having scrawled his hand at the bottom of it, he anathematised\r\nthem all for a set of cowardly, mutinous, degenerate poltroons--threw the\r\ncapitulation at their heads, slammed down the window, and was heard\r\nstumping downstairs with vehement indignation. The rabble incontinently\r\ntook to their heels; even the burgomasters were not slow in evacuating the\r\npremises, fearing lest the sturdy Peter might issue from his den, and\r\ngreet them with some unwelcome testimonial of his displeasure.\r\n\r\nWithin three hours after the surrender, a legion of British beef-fed\r\nwarriors poured into New Amsterdam, taking possession of the fort and\r\nbatteries. And now might be heard from all quarters the sound of hammers\r\nmade by the old Dutch burghers, in nailing up their doors and windows, to\r\nprotect their vrouws from these fierce barbarians, whom they contemplated\r\nin silent sullenness from the garret windows as they paraded through the\r\nstreets.\r\n\r\nThus did Colonel Richard Nichols, the commander of the British forces,\r\nenter into quiet possession of the conquered realm, as _locum tenens_ for\r\nthe Duke of York. The victory was attended with no other outrage than that\r\nof changing the name of the province and its metropolis, which thenceforth\r\nwere denominated New York, and so have continued to be called unto the\r\npresent day. The inhabitants, according to treaty, were allowed to\r\nmaintain quiet possession of their property, but so inveterately did they\r\nretain their abhorrence of the British nation that in a private meeting of\r\nthe leading citizens it was unanimously determined never to ask any of\r\ntheir conquerors to dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n    NOTE.\r\n\r\n    Modern historians assert that when the New Netherlands were thus\r\n    overrun by the British, as Spain in ancient days by the Saracens,\r\n    a resolute band refused to bend the neck to the invader. Led by\r\n    one Garret Van Horne, a valorous and gigantic Dutchman, they\r\n    crossed the bay and buried themselves among the marshes and\r\n    cabbage gardens of Communipaw, as did Pelayo and his followers\r\n    among the mountains of Asturias. Here their descendants have\r\n    remained ever since, keeping themselves apart, like seed corn, to\r\n    repeople the city with the genuine breed, whenever it shall be\r\n    effectually recovered from its intruders. It is said the genuine\r\n    descendants of the Nederlanders who inhabit New York still look\r\n    with longing eyes to the green marshes of ancient Pavonia, as did\r\n    the conquered Spaniards of yore to the stern mountains of\r\n    Asturias, considering these the regions whence deliverance is to\r\n    come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus then have I concluded this great historical enterprise; but before I\r\nlay aside my weary pen, there yet remains to be performed one pious duty.\r\nIf, among the variety of readers who may peruse this book, there should\r\nhaply be found any of those souls of true nobility, which glow with\r\ncelestial fire at the history of the generous and the brave, they will\r\ndoubtless be anxious to know the fate of the gallant Peter Stuyvesant. To\r\ngratify one such sterling heart of gold, I would go more lengths than to\r\ninstruct the cold-blooded curiosity of a whole fraternity of philosophers.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had that high-mettled cavalier signed the articles of\r\ncapitulation, than, determined not to witness the humiliation of his\r\nfavorite city, he turned his back on its walls, and made a growling\r\nretreat to his bowery, or country seat, which was situated about two miles\r\noff; where he passed the remainder of his days in patriarchal retirement.\r\nThere he enjoyed that tranquillity of mind which he had never known amid\r\nthe distracting cares of government, and tasted the sweets of absolute and\r\nuncontrolled authority, which his factious subjects had so often dashed\r\nwith the bitterness of opposition.\r\n\r\nNo persuasion should ever induce him to revisit the city; on the contrary,\r\nhe would always have his great arm-chair placed with its back to the\r\nwindows which looked in that direction, until a thick grove of trees,\r\nplanted by his own hand, grew up and formed a screen that effectually\r\nexcluded it from the prospect. He railed continually at the degenerate\r\ninnovations and improvements introduced by the conquerors--forbade a word\r\nof their detested language to be spoken in his family, a prohibition\r\nreadily obeyed, since none of the household could speak anything but\r\nDutch, and even ordered a fine avenue to be cut down in front of his house\r\nbecause it consisted of English cherry trees.\r\n\r\nThe same incessant vigilance, which blazed forth when he had a vast\r\nprovince under his care, now showed itself with equal vigor, though in\r\nnarrower limits. He patroled with unceasing watchfulness the boundaries of\r\nhis little territory, repelled every encroachment with intrepid\r\npromptness: punished every vagrant depredation upon his orchard or his\r\nfarmyard with inflexible severity, and conducted every stray hog or cow in\r\ntriumph to the pound. But to the indigent neighbor, the friendless\r\nstranger, or the weary wanderer, his spacious doors were ever open, and\r\nhis capacious fireplace, that emblem of his own warm and generous heart,\r\nhad always a corner to receive and cherish them. There was an exception to\r\nthis, I must confess, in case the ill-starred applicant were an\r\nEnglishman or a Yankee; to whom, though he might extend the hand of\r\nassistance, he could never be brought to yield the rites of hospitality.\r\nNay, if peradventure some straggling merchant of the East should stop at\r\nhis door, with his cart-load of tinware or wooden bowls, the fiery Peter\r\nwould issue forth like a giant from his castle, and make such a furious\r\nclattering among his pots and kettles, that the vender of \"notions\" was\r\nfain to betake himself to instant flight.\r\n\r\nHis suit of regimentals, worn threadbare by the brush, was carefully hung\r\nup in the state bedchamber, and regularly aired the first fair day of\r\nevery month, and his cocked hat and trusty sword were suspended in grim\r\nrepose over the parlor mantelpiece, forming supporters to a full-length\r\nportrait of the renowned admiral Van Tromp. In his domestic empire he\r\nmaintained strict discipline, and a well organized despotic government;\r\nbut though his own will was the supreme law, yet the good of his subjects\r\nwas his constant object. He watched over not merely their immediate\r\ncomforts, but their morals and their ultimate welfare; for he gave them\r\nabundance of excellent admonition; nor could any of them complain, that,\r\nwhen occasion required, he was by any means niggardly in bestowing\r\nwholesome correction.\r\n\r\nThe good old Dutch festivals, those periodical demonstrations of an\r\noverflowing heart and a thankful spirit, which are falling into sad disuse\r\namong my fellow citizens, were faithfully observed in the mansion of\r\nGovernor Stuyvesant. New year was truly a day of open-handed liberality,\r\nof jocund revelry and warm-hearted congratulation, when the bosom swelled\r\nwith genial good-fellowship, and the plenteous table was attended with an\r\nunceremonious freedom and honest broad-mouthed merriment unknown in these\r\ndays of degeneracy and refinement. Paas and Pinxter were scrupulously\r\nobserved throughout his dominions; nor was the day of St. Nicholas\r\nsuffered to pass by without making presents, hanging the stocking in the\r\nchimney, and complying with all its other ceremonies.\r\n\r\nOnce a year, on the first day of April, he used to array himself in full\r\nregimentals, being the anniversary of his triumphal entry into New\r\nAmsterdam, after the conquest of New Sweden. This was always a kind of\r\nsaturnalia among the domestics, when they considered themselves at\r\nliberty, in some measure, to say and do what they pleased, for on this day\r\ntheir master was always observed to unbend and become exceedingly pleasant\r\nand jocose, sending the old gray-headed negroes on April-fool's errands\r\nfor pigeons' milk; not one of whom but allowed himself to be taken in, and\r\nhumored his old master's jokes, as became a faithful and well disciplined\r\ndependent. Thus did he reign, happily and peacefully on his own land,\r\ninjuring no man, envying no man, molested by no outward strifes, perplexed\r\nby no internal commotions; and the mighty monarchs of the earth, who were\r\nvainly seeking to maintain peace, and promote the welfare of mankind by\r\nwar and desolation, would have done well to have made a voyage to the\r\nlittle island of Manna-hata, and learned a lesson in government from the\r\ndomestic economy of Peter Stuyvesant.\r\n\r\nIn process of time, however, the old governor, like all other children of\r\nmortality, began to exhibit evident tokens of decay. Like an aged oak,\r\nwhich, though it long has braved the fury of the elements, and still\r\nretains its gigantic proportions, begins to shake and groan, with every\r\nblast--so was it with the gallant Peter; for though he still bore the port\r\nand semblance of what he was in the days of his hardihood and chivalry,\r\nyet did age and infirmity begin to sap the vigor of his frame--but his\r\nheart, that unconquerable citadel, still triumphed unsubdued. With\r\nmatchless avidity would he listen to every article of intelligence\r\nconcerning the battles between the English and Dutch; still would his\r\npulse beat high, whenever he heard of the victories of De Ruyter--and his\r\ncountenance lower, and his eyebrows knit, when fortune turned in favor of\r\nthe English. At length, as on a certain day he had just smoke his fifth\r\npipe, and was napping after dinner in his arm-chair, conquering the whole\r\nBritish nation in his dreams, he was suddenly aroused by a ringing of\r\nbells, rattling of drums, and roaring of cannon, that put all his blood in\r\na ferment. But when he learnt that these rejoicings were in honor of a\r\ngreat victory obtained by the combined English and French fleets over the\r\nbrave De Ruyter and the younger Van Tromp, it went so much to his heart\r\nthat he took to his bed, and in less than three days was brought to\r\ndeath's door by a violent cholera morbus! Even in this extremity he still\r\ndisplayed the unconquerable sprit of Peter the Headstrong--holding out to\r\nthe last gasp with inflexible obstinacy against a whole army of old women,\r\nwho were bent upon driving the enemy out of his bowels, in the true Dutch\r\nmode of defense, by inundation.\r\n\r\nWhile he thus lay, lingering on the verge of dissolution, news was brought\r\nhim that the brave De Ruyter had made good his retreat with little loss,\r\nand meant once more to meet the enemy in battle. The closing eye of the\r\nold warrior kindled with martial fire at the words. He partly raised\r\nhimself in bed, clinched his withered hand as if he felt within his gripe\r\nthat sword which waved in triumph before the walls of Port Christina, and\r\ngiving a grim smile of exultation, sank back upon his pillow, and expired.\r\nThus died Peter Stuyvesant, a valiant soldier, a loyal subject, an upright\r\ngovernor, and an honest Dutchman, who wanted only a few empires to\r\ndesolate to have been immortalized as a hero!\r\n\r\nHis funeral obsequies were celebrated with the utmost grandeur and\r\nsolemnity. The town was perfectly emptied of its inhabitants, who crowded\r\nin throngs to pay the last sad honors to their good old governor. All his\r\nsterling qualities rushed in full tide upon their recollection, while the\r\nmemory of his foibles and his faults had expired with him. The ancient\r\nburghers contended who should have the privilege of bearing the pall; the\r\npopulace strove who should walk nearest to the bier, and the melancholy\r\nprocession was closed by a number of gray-bearded negroes, who had\r\nwintered and summered in the household of their departed master for the\r\ngreater part of a century.\r\n\r\nWith sad and gloomy countenances the multitude gathered round the grave.\r\nThey dwelt with mournful hearts on the sturdy virtues, the signal\r\nservices, and the gallant exploits of the brave old worthy. They recalled,\r\nwith secret upbraiding, their own factious oppositions to his government;\r\nand many an ancient burgher, whose phlegmatic features had never been\r\nknown to relax, nor his eyes to moisten, was now observed to puff a\r\npensive pipe, and the big drop to steal down his cheek; while he muttered,\r\nwith affectionate accent, and melancholy shake of the head, \"Well,\r\nden!--Hardkoppig Peter ben gone at last!\"\r\n\r\nHis remains were deposited in the family vault, under a chapel which he\r\nhad piously erected on his estate, and dedicated to St. Nicholas, and\r\nwhich stood on the identical spot at present occupied by St. Mark's\r\nchurch, where his tombstone is still to be seen. His estate, or bowery, as\r\nit was called, has ever continued in the possession of his descendants,\r\nwho, by the uniform integrity of their conduct, and their strict adherence\r\nto the customs and manners that prevailed in the \"good old times,\" have\r\nproved themselves worthy of their illustrious ancestor. Many a time and\r\noft has the farm been haunted at night by enterprising money-diggers, in\r\nquest of pots of gold, said to have been buried by the old governor,\r\nthough I cannot learn that any of them have ever been enriched by their\r\nresearches; and who is there, among my native-born fellow-citizens, that\r\ndoes not remember when, in the mischievous days of his boyhood, he\r\nconceived it a great exploit to rob \"Stuyvesant's orchard\" on a holiday\r\nafternoon?\r\n\r\nAt this stronghold of the family may still be seen certain memorials of\r\nthe immortal Peter. His full-length portrait frowns in martial terrors\r\nfrom the parlor wall, his cocked hat and sword still hang up in the best\r\nbed-room; his brimstone-colored breeches were for a long while suspended\r\nin the hall, until some years since they occasioned a dispute between a\r\nnew-married couple; and his silver-mounted wooden leg is still treasured\r\nup in the store-room as an invaluable relique.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous events, which are each in their turn the most direful\r\nand melancholy of all possible occurrences, in your interesting and\r\nauthentic history, there is none that occasions such deep and\r\nheart-rending grief as the decline and fall of your renowned and mighty\r\nempires. Where is the reader who can contemplate without emotion the\r\ndisastrous events by which the great dynasties of the world have been\r\nextinguished? While wandering, in imagination, among the gigantic ruins of\r\nstates and empires, and marking the tremendous convulsions that wrought\r\ntheir overthrow, the bosom of the melancholy inquirer swells with sympathy\r\ncommensurate to the surrounding desolation. Kingdoms, principalities, and\r\npowers, have each had their rise, their progress, and their downfall; each\r\nin its turn has swayed a potent sceptre; each has returned to its primeval\r\nnothingness. And thus did it fare with the empire of their High\r\nMightinesses, at the Manhattoes, under the peaceful reign of Walter the\r\nDoubter, the fretful reign of William the Testy, and the chivalric reign\r\nof Peter the Headstrong.\r\n\r\nIts history is fruitful of instruction, and worthy of being pondered over\r\nattentively; for it is by thus raking among the ashes of departed\r\ngreatness that the sparks of true knowledge are to be found and the lamp\r\nof wisdom illuminated. Let then the reign of Walter the Doubter warn\r\nagainst yielding to that sleek, contented security, and that overweening\r\nfondness for comfort and repose, which are produced by a state of\r\nprosperity and peace. These tend to unnerve a nation; to destroy its pride\r\nof character; to render it patient of insult; deaf to the calls of honor\r\nand of justice; and cause it to cling to peace, like the sluggard to his\r\npillow, at the expense of every valuable duty and consideration. Such\r\nsupineness ensures the very evil from which it shrinks. One right yielded\r\nup produces the usurpation of a second; one encroachment passively\r\nsuffered makes way for another; and the nation which thus, through a\r\ndoting love of peace, has sacrificed honor and interest, will at length\r\nhave to fight for existence.\r\n\r\nLet the disastrous reign of William the Testy serve as a salutary warning\r\nagainst that fitful, feverish mode of legislation, which acts without\r\nsystem, depends on shifts and projects, and trusts to lucky contingencies;\r\nwhich hesitates, and wavers, and at length decides with the rashness of\r\nignorance and imbecility; which stoops for popularity by courting the\r\nprejudices and flattering the arrogance, rather than commanding the\r\nrespect, of the rabble; which seeks safety in a multitude of counsellors,\r\nand distracts itself by a variety of contradictory schemes and opinions;\r\nwhich mistakes procrastination for weariness--hurry for\r\ndecision--parsimony for economy--bustle for business, and vaporing for\r\nvalor; which is violent in council, sanguine in expectation, precipitate\r\nin action, and feeble in execution; which undertakes enterprises without\r\nforethought, enters upon them without preparation, conducts them without\r\nenergy, and ends them in confusion and defeat.\r\n\r\nLet the reign of the good Stuyvesant show the effects of vigor and\r\ndecision, even when destitute of cool judgment, and surrounded by\r\nperplexities. Let it show how frankness, probity, and high-souled courage\r\nwill command respect and secure honor, even where success is unattainable.\r\nBut, at the same time, let it caution against a too ready reliance on the\r\ngood faith of others, and a too honest confidence in the loving\r\nprofessions of powerful neighbors, who are most friendly when they most\r\nmean to betray. Let it teach a judicious attention to the opinions and\r\nwishes of the many, who, in times of peril, must be soothed and led, or\r\napprehension will overpower the deference to authority.\r\n\r\nLet the empty wordiness of his factious subjects, their intemperate\r\nharangues, their violent \"resolutions,\" their hectorings against an absent\r\nenemy, and their pusillanimity on his approach, teach us to distrust and\r\ndespise those clamorous patriots whose courage dwells but in the tongue.\r\nLet them serve as a lesson to repress that insolence of speech, destitute\r\nof real force, which too often breaks forth in popular bodies, and\r\nbespeaks the vanity rather than the spirit of a nation. Let them caution\r\nus against vaunting too much of our own power and prowess, and reviling a\r\nnoble enemy. True gallantry of soul would always lead us to treat a foe\r\nwith courtesy and proud punctilio; a contrary conduct but takes from the\r\nmerit of victory, and renders defeat doubly disgraceful.\r\n\r\nBut I cease to dwell on the stores of excellent examples to be drawn from\r\nthe ancient chronicles of the Manhattoes. He who reads attentively will\r\ndiscover the threads of gold which run throughout the web of history, and\r\nare invisible to the dull eye of ignorance. But before I conclude let me\r\npoint out a solemn warning furnished in the subtle chain of events by\r\nwhich the capture of Fort Casimir has produced the present convulsions of\r\nour globe.\r\n\r\nAttend then, gentle reader, to this plain deduction, which, if thou art a\r\nking, an emperor, or other powerful potentate, I advise thee to treasure\r\nup in thy heart, though little expectation have I that my work will fall\r\ninto such hands; for well I know the care of crafty ministers, to keep all\r\ngrave and edifying books of the kind out of the way of unhappy monarchs,\r\nlest peradventure they should read them and learn wisdom.\r\n\r\nBy the treacherous surprisal of Fort Casimir, then, did the crafty Swedes\r\nenjoy a transient triumph; but drew upon their heads the vengeance of\r\nPeter Stuyvesant, who wrested all New Sweden from their hands. By the\r\nconquest of New Sweden Peter Stuyvesant aroused the claims of Lord\r\nBaltimore, who appealed to the Cabinet of Great Britain, who subdued the\r\nwhole province of New Netherlands. By this great achievement, the whole\r\nextent of North America, from Nova Scotia to the Floridas, was rendered\r\none entire dependency upon the British crown. But mark the consequence:\r\nthe hitherto-scattered colonies being thus consolidated, and having no\r\nrival colonies to check or keep them in awe, waxed great and powerful, and\r\nfinally becoming too strong for the mother country, were enabled to shake\r\noff its bonds, and by a glorious revolution became an independent empire.\r\nBut the chain of effects stopped not here; the successful revolution in\r\nAmerica produced the sanguinary revolution in France which produced the\r\npuissant Bonaparte, who produced the French despotism, which has thrown\r\nthe whole world in confusion! Thus have these great Powers been\r\nsuccessively punished for their ill-starred conquests; and thus, as I\r\nasserted, have all the present convulsions, revolutions, and disasters\r\nthat overwhelm mankind, originated in the capture of the little Fort\r\nCasimir, as recorded in this eventful history.\r\n\r\nAnd now, worthy reader, ere I take a sad farewell, which, alas! must be\r\nfor ever--willingly would I part in cordial fellowship, and bespeak thy\r\nkind-hearted remembrance. That I have not written a better history of the\r\ndays of the patriarchs is not my fault; had any other person written one\r\nas good, I should not have attempted it at all. That many will hereafter\r\nspring up and surpass me in excellence I have very little doubt, and still\r\nless care; well knowing that, when the great Christovallo Colon (who is\r\nvulgarly called Columbus) had once stood his egg upon its end every one at\r\ntable could stand his up a thousand times more dexterously. Should any\r\nreader find matter of offence in this history, I should heartily grieve,\r\nthough I would on no account question his penetration by telling him he\r\nwas mistaken--his good-nature by telling him he was captious--or his pure\r\nconscience by telling him he was startled at a shadow. Surely, when so\r\ningenious in finding offence where none was intended, it were a thousand\r\npities he should not be suffered to enjoy the benefit of his discovery.\r\n\r\nI have too high an opinion of the understanding of my fellow-citizens to\r\nthink of yielding them instruction, and I covet too much their good-will\r\nto forfeit it by giving them good advice. I am none of those cynics who\r\ndespise the world, because it despises them; on the contrary, though but\r\nlow in its regard, I look up to it with the most perfect good-nature, and\r\nmy only sorrow is, that it does not prove itself more worthy of the\r\nunbounded love I bear it.\r\n\r\nIf, however, in this my historic production, the scanty fruit of a long\r\nand laborious life, I have failed to gratify the dainty palate of the age,\r\nI can only lament my misfortune, for it is too late in the season for me\r\neven to hope to repair it. Already has withering age showered his sterile\r\nsnows upon my brow; in a little while, and this genial warmth which still\r\nlingers around my heart, and throbs, worthy reader, throbs kindly toward\r\nthyself, will be chilled for ever. Haply this frail compound of dust,\r\nwhich while alive may have given birth to naught but unprofitable weeds,\r\nmay form a humble sod of the valley, whence may spring many a sweet wild\r\nflower, to adorn my beloved island of Mannahata!\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
