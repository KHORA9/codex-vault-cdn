AND C. F. CLAY,\r\n  AT THE UNIVERSITY PRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FRANCISCO AIDANO GASQUET\r\n  MONACHO BENEDICTINO\r\n  D.D.\r\n  MAGISTRO DISCIPULUS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen engaged in editing and completing _The Architectural History of the\r\nUniversity and Colleges of Cambridge_, I devoted much time and attention\r\nto the essay called _The Library_. The subject was entirely new; and the\r\nmore I looked into it, the more convinced did I become that it would well\r\nrepay fuller investigation than was then possible. For instance, I felt\r\ncertain that the Customs affecting monastic libraries would, if one could\r\nonly discover them, throw considerable light on collegiate statutes\r\nrelating to the same subject.\r\n\r\nThe _Architectural History_ having been published, I had leisure to study\r\nlibraries from my new point of view; and, while thus engaged, I\r\nfortunately met with the admirable paper by Dom Gasquet which he modestly\r\ncalls _Some Notes on Medieval Monastic Libraries_. This brief essay--it\r\noccupies only 20 pages--opened my eyes to the possibilities that lay\r\nbefore me, and I gladly place on record here the debt I owe to the\r\nhistorian to whom I have dedicated this book.\r\n\r\nWhen I had the honour of delivering the Rede Lecture before the University\r\nof Cambridge in June 1894, I attempted a reconstruction of the monastic\r\nlibrary, shewing its relationship, through its fittings, to the\r\ncollegiate libraries of Oxford and Cambridge; and I was also able,\r\nfollowing the example set by Dom Gasquet in the above-mentioned essay, to\r\nindicate the value of illuminated manuscripts as illustrating the life of\r\na medieval student or scribe. In my lectures as Sandars Reader in\r\nBibliography, delivered before the University of Cambridge in 1900, I\r\ndeveloped the subject still further, extending the scope of my enquiries\r\nso as to include the libraries of Greece and Rome.\r\n\r\nIn writing my present book I have availed myself freely of the three works\r\nabove mentioned. At the same time I have incorporated much fresh material;\r\nand I am glad to take this opportunity of stating, that, with the single\r\nexception of the Escorial, I have personally examined and measured every\r\nbuilding which I have had occasion to describe; and many of the\r\nillustrations are from my own sketches.\r\n\r\nI call my book an _Essay_, because I wish to indicate that it is only an\r\nattempt to deal, in a summary fashion, with an extremely wide and\r\ninteresting subject--a subject, too, which might easily be subdivided into\r\nseparate heads each capable of more elaborate treatment. For instance,\r\nwith regard to libraries in Religious Houses, I hope to see a book\r\nwritten, dealing not merely with the way in which the books were cared\r\nfor, but with the subjects most generally studied, as indicated to us by\r\nthe catalogues which have survived.\r\n\r\nA research such as I have had to undertake has naturally involved the\r\nco-operation of numerous librarians and others both in England and on the\r\nContinent. From all these officials I have experienced unfailing courtesy\r\nand kindness, and I beg them to accept this collective expression of my\r\ngratitude. To some, however, I am under such particular obligations, that\r\nI wish to mention them by name.\r\n\r\nIn the first place I have to thank my friends Dr Jackson of Trinity\r\nCollege, Dr Sandys of S. John's College, Dr James of King's College, and\r\nF. J. H. Jenkinson, M.A., University Librarian, for their kind help in\r\nreading proofs and making suggestions. Dr Sandys devoted much time to the\r\nrevision of the first chapter. As my work deals largely with monastic\r\ninstitutions it is almost needless to say that I have consulted and\r\nreceived efficient help from my old friend W. H. St John Hope, M.A.,\r\nAssistant Secretary to the Society of Antiquaries.\r\n\r\nMy researches in Rome were made easy to me by the unfailing kindness and\r\nready help accorded on every occasion by Father C. J. Ehrle, S.J., Prefect\r\nof the Vatican Library. My best thanks are also due to Signor Rodolfo\r\nLanciani, to Professor Petersen of the German Archeological Institute,\r\nRome, and to Signor Guido Biagi of the Biblioteca Laurenziana, Florence.\r\nAt Milan Monsignor Ceriani of the Ambrosian Library was so kind as to have\r\nthe library photographed for my use.\r\n\r\nThe courteous officials who administer the great libraries of Paris with\r\nso much ability, have assisted me in all my researches. I wish specially\r\nto thank in this place M. Leopold Delisle and M. Leon Dorez of the\r\nBibliotheque Nationale; M. A. Franklin of the Bibliotheque Mazarine; M. H.\r\nMartin of the Bibliotheque de l'Arsenal; and M. A. Perate,\r\nSous-Conservateur du Chateau de Versailles.\r\n\r\nI have also to thank Senor Ricardo Velasquez for his beautiful elevation\r\nof the bookcases in the Escorial Library; Father J. van den Gheyn, S.J.,\r\nof the Royal Library, Brussels, for his trouble in shewing me, and\r\nallowing me to have photographed, several MSS. from the library under his\r\ncharge; my friends Mr T. G. Jackson, R.A., Architect, for lending me his\r\nsection of Bishop Cobham's library at Oxford; E. W. B. Nicholson, M.A.,\r\nLibrarian, and Falconer Madan, M.A., Sub-Librarian, in the Bodleian\r\nLibrary, for information respecting the building and its contents; Mr F.\r\nE. Bickley of the British Museum for much help in finding and examining\r\nMSS.; and Lionel Cust, M.A., Director of the National Portrait Gallery,\r\nfor general direction and encouragement.\r\n\r\nMessrs Macmillan have allowed me to use three illustrations which appear\r\nin the first chapter; Mr Murray has given the same permission for the\r\nwoodcut of the carrells at Gloucester; and Messrs Blades for the\r\nrepresentation of James Leaver's book-press.\r\n\r\nLastly I wish to thank the staff of the University Press for using their\r\nbest efforts to produce the work rapidly and well, and for many acts of\r\npersonal kindness to myself.\r\n\r\n                                                     JOHN WILLIS CLARK.\r\n\r\n  SCROOPE HOUSE,\r\n    CAMBRIDGE,\r\n      _September 23rd, 1901._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  Introduction.

LIBRARIES IN\r\n    GREECE, ALEXANDRIA, PERGAMON, ROME. THEIR SIZE, USE,\r\n    CONTEXTS, AND FITTINGS. ARMARIA OR PRESSES. THE VATICAN\r\n    LIBRARY OF SIXTUS V. A TYPE OF AN ANCIENT ROMAN LIBRARY.\r\n\r\nI propose, in the following Essay, to trace the methods adopted by man in\r\ndifferent ages and countries to preserve, to use, and to make accessible\r\nto others, those objects, of whatever material, on which he has recorded\r\nhis thoughts. In this investigation I shall include the position, the\r\nsize, and the arrangement, of the rooms in which these treasures were\r\ndeposited, with the progressive development of fittings, catalogues, and\r\nother appliances, whether defensive, or to facilitate use. But, though I\r\nshall have to trace out these matters in some detail, I shall try to\r\neschew mere antiquarianism, and to impart human interest, so far as\r\npossible, to a research which might otherwise exhaust the patience of my\r\nreaders. Bibliography, it must be understood, will be wholly excluded.\r\nFrom my special point of view books are simply things to be taken care of:\r\neven their external features concern me only so far as they modify the\r\nmethods adopted for arrangement and preservation. I must dismiss the\r\nsubject-matter of the volumes which filled the libraries of former days\r\nwith a brevity of which I deeply regret the necessity. I shall point out\r\nthe pains taken to sort the books under various comprehensive heads; but I\r\nshall not enumerate the authors which fall under this or that division.\r\n\r\nThe earliest repositories of books were connected with temples or palaces,\r\neither because priests under all civilisations have been _par excellence_\r\nthe learned class, while despots have patronised art and literature; or\r\nbecause such a position was thought to offer greater security.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Plan of the Record-Rooms in the Palace of\r\nAssur-bani-pal, King of Nineveh.]\r\n\r\nI will begin with Assyria, where the record-rooms, or we might almost say\r\nthe library, in the palace of Assur-bani-pal, King of Nineveh, were\r\ndiscovered by Mr Layard in 1850 at Kouyunjik, on the Tigris, opposite\r\nMosul. The plan (fig. 1), taken from Mr Layard's work[1], will shew,\r\nbetter than a long description, the position of these rooms, and their\r\nrelation to the rest of the building--which is believed to date from about\r\n700 B.C. The long passage (No. XLIX) is one of the entrances to the\r\npalace. Passing thence along the narrower passage (No. XLII) the explorers\r\nsoon reached a doorway (E), which led them into a large hall (No. XXIX),\r\nwhence a second doorway (F) brought them into a chamber (No. XXXVIII). On\r\nthe north side of this room were two doorways (G. G), each \"formed by two\r\ncolossal bas-reliefs of Dagon, the fish-god.\" \"The first doorway,\" says Mr\r\nLayard, \"guarded by the fish-gods, led into two small chambers opening\r\ninto each other, and once panelled with bas-reliefs, the greater part of\r\nwhich had been destroyed. I shall call these chambers 'the chambers of\r\nrecords,' for, like 'the house of the rolls' or records, which Darius\r\nordered to be searched for the decree of Cyrus concerning the building of\r\nthe Temple of Jerusalem[2], they appear to have contained the decrees of\r\nthe Assyrian kings, as well as the archives of the empire.\"\r\n\r\nMr Layard was led to this conclusion by finding, in these rooms, enormous\r\nquantities of inscribed tablets and cylinders of baked clay. \"To a height\r\nof a foot or more from the floor they were entirely filled with them; some\r\nentire, but the greater part broken into many fragments, probably by the\r\nfalling in of the upper part of the building.... These documents appear to\r\nbe of various kinds. Many are historical records of wars, and distant\r\nexpeditions undertaken by the Assyrians; some seem to be royal decrees,\r\nand are stamped with the name of a king, the son of Esarhaddon; others\r\nagain ... contain lists of the gods, and probably a register of offerings\r\nmade in their temples[3].\"\r\n\r\nSo far Mr Layard. Subsequent researches have shewn that these two small\r\nrooms--they were 27 feet and 23 feet long respectively, with a uniform\r\nbreadth of 20 feet--contained the literature as well as the official\r\ndocuments of Assyria. The tablets have been sorted under the following\r\nheads: History; Law; Science; Magic; Dogma; Legends: and it has been shewn\r\n(1) that there was a special functionary to take charge of them; (2) that\r\nthey were arranged in series, with special precautions for keeping the\r\ntablets forming a particular series in their proper sequence; (3) that\r\nthere was a general catalogue, and probably a class-catalogue as well[4].\r\n\r\nExcavations in other parts of Assyria have added valuable information to\r\nLayard's first discovery. Dr Wallis Budge, of the British Museum, whom I\r\nhave to thank for much kind assistance, tells me that \"Kouyunjik is hardly\r\na good example of a Mesopotamian library, for it is certain that the\r\ntablets were thrown about out of their proper places when the city was\r\ncaptured by the Medes about B.C. 609. The tablets were kept on shelves....\r\nWhen I was digging at Derr some years ago we found the what I call 'Record\r\nChamber,' and we saw the tablets lying _in situ_ on slate shelves. There\r\nwere, however, not many literary tablets there, for the chamber was meant\r\nto hold the commercial documents relating to the local temple....\" Dr\r\nBudge concludes his letter with this very important sentence: \"We have no\r\ndefinite proof of what I am going to say now, but I believe that the\r\nbilingual[5] lists, which Assur-bani-pal had drawn up for his library at\r\nNineveh, were intended 'for the use of students.'\"\r\n\r\nTo this suggestion I would add the following. Does not the position of\r\nthese two rooms, easily accessible from the entrance to the palace, shew\r\nthat their contents might be consulted by persons who were denied\r\nadmission to the more private apartments? And further, does not the\r\npresence of the god Dagon at the entrance indicate that the library was\r\nunder the protection of the deity as well as of the sovereign?\r\n\r\nAs a pendant to these Assyrian discoveries I may mention the vague rumour\r\nechoed by Athenaeus of extensive libraries collected in the sixth century\r\nbefore our era by Polycrates[6], tyrant of Samos, and Peisistratus,\r\ntyrant of Athens, the latter collection, according to Aulus Gellius[7],\r\nhaving been accessible to all who cared to use it. It must be admitted\r\nthat these stories are of doubtful authenticity; and further, that we have\r\nno details of the way in which books were cared for in Greece during the\r\ngolden age of her literature. This dearth of information is the more\r\ntantalizing as it is obvious that private libraries must have existed in a\r\ncity so cultivated as Athens; and we do, in fact, find a few notices which\r\ntell us that such was the case. Xenophon[8], for instance, speaks of the\r\nnumber of volumes in the possession of Euthydemus, a follower of Socrates;\r\nand Athenaeus records, in the passage to which I have already alluded, the\r\nnames of several book-collectors, among whom are Euripides and Aristotle.\r\n\r\nAn allusion to the poet's bibliographical tastes has been detected in the\r\nscene of _The Frogs_ of Aristophanes, where AEschylus and Euripides are\r\nweighing verses against each other in the presence of Dionysus. AEschylus\r\nexclaims:\r\n\r\n  [Greek: kai meket' emoige kat' epos, all' es ton stathmon\r\n  autos ta paidi', he gyne, kephisophon,\r\n  embas kathestho syllabon ta biblia,\r\n  ego de dy' epe ton emon ero monon.]\r\n\r\n  Come, no more single lines--let him bring all,\r\n  His wife, his children, his Cephisophon,\r\n  His books and everything, himself to boot--\r\n  I'll counterpoise them with a couple of lines[9].\r\n\r\nWith regard to Aristotle Strabo has preserved a tradition that he \"was the\r\nfirst who made a collection of books, and taught the kings of Egypt how to\r\narrange a library[10]\"--words which may be taken to mean that Aristotle\r\nwas the first to work out the arrangement of books on a definite system\r\nwhich was afterwards adopted by the Ptolemies at Alexandria.\r\n\r\nThese notices are extremely disappointing. They merely serve to shew that\r\ncollections of books did exist in Greece; but they give us no indication\r\nof either their extent or their arrangement. It was left to the Emperor\r\nHadrian to build the first public library at Athens, to which, as it was\r\nnaturally constructed on a Roman design, I shall return after I have\r\ndescribed those from which it was in all probability imitated.\r\n\r\nBut, if what may be termed Greece in Europe declines to give us\r\ninformation, that other Greece which extended itself to Asia Minor and to\r\nEgypt--Greater Greece it would be called in modern times--supplies us with\r\na type of library-organisation which has been of far-reaching influence.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Alexander the Great (B.C. 323) a Greek dynasty, that of\r\nthe Ptolemies, established itself at Alexandria, and another Greek dynasty\r\nat Pergamon. Both were distinguished--like Italian despots of the\r\nRenaissance--for the splendour and the culture of their courts, and they\r\nrivalled one another in the extent and richness of their libraries; but,\r\nif we are to believe Strabo, the library at Pergamon was not begun until\r\nthe reign of Eumenes II. (B.C. 197-159), or 126 years after that at\r\nAlexandria[11].\r\n\r\nThe libraries at Alexandria (for there were two)--though far more\r\ncelebrated and more extensive than the library at Pergamon--need not, from\r\nmy point of view, detain us for more than a moment, for we are told very\r\nlittle about their position, and nothing about their arrangement. The site\r\nof the earliest, the foundation of which is ascribed to Ptolemy the Second\r\n(B.C. 285-247), must undoubtedly be sought for within the circuit of the\r\nroyal palace, which was in the fashionable quarter of the city called\r\nBrucheion. This palace was a vast enceinte, not a separate building, and,\r\nas Strabo, who visited Alexandria 24 B.C., says,\r\n\r\n    Within the precincts of the palace is the Museum. It has\r\n    a colonnade, a lecture-room, and a vast establishment\r\n    where the men of letters who share the use of the Museum\r\n    take their meals together. This College has a common\r\n    revenue; and is managed by a priest who is over the\r\n    Museum, an officer formerly appointed by the kings of\r\n    Egypt, but, at the present time, by the Emperor[12].\r\n\r\nThat the older of the two libraries must have been in some way connected\r\nwith these buildings seems to me certain from two considerations. First, a\r\nruler who took so keen an interest in books as Ptolemy, would assuredly\r\nhave kept his treasures under his own eye; and, secondly, he would hardly\r\nhave placed them at a distance from the spot where the learned men of\r\nAlexandria held their meetings[13].\r\n\r\nAt some period subsequent to the foundation of Ptolemy's first library, a\r\nsecond, called the daughter of the first[14], was established in connexion\r\nwith the Temple of Serapis, a magnificent structure in the quarter\r\nRhacotis, adorned so lavishly with colonnades, statuary, and other\r\narchitectural enrichments, that the historian Ammianus Marcellinus\r\ndeclares that nothing in the world could equal it, except the Roman\r\nCapitol[15].\r\n\r\nThis brief notice of the libraries of Alexandria shews that the earlier of\r\nthe two, besides being in a building dedicated to the Muses, was also\r\nconnected in all probability with a palace, and the second with a temple.\r\nIf we now turn to Pergamon, we shall find the library associated with the\r\ntemple and [Greek: temenos] of Athena.\r\n\r\nThe founder selected for the site of his city a lofty and precipitous\r\nhill, about a thousand feet above the sea-level. The rocky plateau which\r\nforms the summit is divided into three gigantic steps or terraces. On the\r\nhighest, which occupies the northern end of the hill, the royal palace is\r\nbelieved to have been built. On the next terrace, to the south, was the\r\ntemple of Athena; and on the third, the altar of Zeus. External to those\r\nthree groups of buildings, partly on the edge of the hill, partly on its\r\nsides, were the rest of the public buildings. The lower slopes were\r\nprobably occupied in ancient times, as at present, by the houses of the\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nThese magnificent structures, which won for Pergamon the distinction of\r\nbeing \"by far the noblest city in Asia minor[16],\" were in the main due to\r\nEumenes the Second, who, during his reign of nearly forty years (B.C.\r\n197-159), was enabled, by the wise policy of supporting the Romans, to\r\ntransform his petty state into a powerful monarchy. The construction of a\r\nlibrary is especially referred to him by Strabo[17], and from the\r\nstatement of Vitruvius that it was built for the delight of the world at\r\nlarge (_in communem delectationem_), we may infer that it was intended to\r\nbe public[18]. That he was an energetic book-collector, under whose\r\ndirection a large staff of scribes was perpetually at work, may be\r\ngathered from the well-known story that his bibliographical rival at\r\nAlexandria, exasperated by his activity and success, conceived the\r\ningenious device of crippling his endeavours by forbidding the exportation\r\nof papyrus. Eumenes, however, says the chronicler, was equal to the\r\noccasion, and defeated the scheme by inventing parchment[19]. It is\r\nprobable that Eumenes not only began but completed the library, for in\r\nless than a quarter of a century after his death (B.C. 133) the last of\r\nhis descendants bequeathed the city and state of Pergamon to the Romans.\r\nIt is improbable that they would do much to increase the library, though\r\nthey evidently took care of it, for ninety years later, when Mark Antony\r\nis said to have given it to Cleopatra, the number of works in it amounted\r\nto two hundred thousand[20].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Plan of the temple and precinct of Athena,\r\nPergamon; with that of the Library and adjacent buildings.]\r\n\r\nThe site of the acropolis of Pergamon was thoroughly explored between 1878\r\nand 1886 at the expense of the German Government; and in the course of\r\ntheir researches the archeologists employed discovered certain rooms which\r\nthey believe to have been originally appropriated to the library. I have\r\nhad the accompanying ground-plan (fig. 2) reduced from one of their\r\nplates, and have condensed my description of the locality from that given\r\nin their work[21]. I have also derived much valuable information from a\r\npaper published by Alexander Conze in 1884[22].\r\n\r\nOf the temple of Athena only the foundations remain, but its extent and\r\nposition can be readily ascertained. The enclosure, paved with slabs of\r\nmarble, was entered at the south-east corner. It was open to the west and\r\nto the south, where the ground falls away precipitously, but on the east\r\nand north it was bounded by a cloister in two floors. The pillars of this\r\ncloister were Doric on the ground-floor, Ionic above. The height of those\r\nin the lower range, measured from base to top of capital, was about 16\r\nfeet, of those in the upper range about 9 feet.\r\n\r\nThis enclosure had a mean length of about 240 feet, with a mean breadth of\r\n162 feet[23]. The north cloister was 37 feet broad, and was divided down\r\nthe centre by a row of columns. The east cloister was of about half this\r\nwidth, and was undivided.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the north cloister, the German explorers found four\r\nrooms, which they believe to have been assigned to library purposes. The\r\nplatform of rock on which these chambers stood was nearly 20 feet above\r\nthe level of the floor of the enclosure, and they could only be entered\r\nfrom the upper cloister. Of these rooms the easternmost is the largest,\r\nbeing 42 feet long, by 49 feet broad. Westward of it are three others,\r\nsomewhat narrower, having a uniform width of 39 feet. The easternmost of\r\nthese three rooms is also the smallest, being only 23 feet long; while the\r\ntwo next have a uniform length of about 33 feet.\r\n\r\nAt the south-west corner of this building, but on a lower level, and not\r\naccessible from it, other rooms were found, the use of which is uncertain.\r\n\r\nWe will now return to the eastern room. The foundations of a narrow\r\nplatform or bench extended along the eastern, northern, and western sides,\r\nand in the centre of the northern side there was a mass of stone-work\r\nwhich had evidently formed the base for a statue (fig. 2, A). The\r\ndiscovery of a torso of a statue of Athena[24] in this very room indicated\r\nwhat statue had occupied this commanding position, and also what had\r\nprobably been the use of the room.\r\n\r\nThis theory was confirmed by the discovery in the north wall of two rows\r\nof holes in the stone-work, one above the other, which had evidently been\r\nmade for the reception of brackets, or battens, or other supports for\r\nshelves[25], or some piece of furniture. The lower of these two rows was\r\ncarried along the east wall as well as along the north wall. Further,\r\nstones were found bearing the names of Herodotus, Alcaeus, Timotheus of\r\nMiletus, and Homer, evidently the designations of portrait-busts or\r\nportrait-medallions; and also, two titles of comedies.\r\n\r\nLastly, the very position of these rooms in connexion with the colonnade\r\nindicates their use. It will be observed that the colonnade on the north\r\nside of the area is twice as wide as that on the east side--a peculiarity\r\nwhich is sufficient of itself to prove that it must have been intended for\r\nsome other purpose than as a mere covered way. But, if it be remembered\r\nthat libraries in the ancient world were usually connected with colonnades\r\n(as was probably the case at the Serapeum at Alexandria, and was certainly\r\nthe case at Rome, as I shall proceed to shew) a reason is found for this\r\ndignified construction, and a strong confirmation is afforded for the\r\ntheory that the rooms beyond it once contained the famous library.\r\n\r\nWhen the Romans had taken possession of Pergamon, those who had charge of\r\nthe city would become familiar with the library; and it seems to me almost\r\ncertain that, when the necessity for establishing a public library at Rome\r\nhad been recognised, the splendid structure at Pergamon would be turned to\r\nas a model. But, if I mistake not, Roman architecture had received an\r\ninfluence from Pergamon long before this event occurred. What this was I\r\nwill mention presently.\r\n\r\nNo public library was established in Rome until the reign of Augustus.\r\nJulius Caesar had intended to build one on the largest possible scale, and\r\nhad gone so far as to commission Varro to collect books for it[26]; but it\r\nwas reserved for C. Asinius Pollio, general, lawyer, orator, poet, the\r\nfriend of Virgil and Horace, to devote to this purpose the spoils he had\r\nobtained in his Illyrian campaign, B.C. 39. In the striking words of Pliny\r\n\"he was the first to make men's talents public property (_ingenia hominum\r\nrem publicam fecit_)\" The same writer tells us that he also introduced the\r\nfashion of decorating libraries with busts of departed authors, and that\r\nVarro was the only living writer whose portrait was admitted[27]. Pollio\r\nis further credited, by Suetonius, with having built an _atrium\r\nlibertatis_[28], in which Isidore, a writer of the seventh century,\r\nprobably quoting a lost work of Suetonius, places the library, with the\r\nadditional information, that the collection contained Greek as well as\r\nLatin books[29].\r\n\r\nThe work of Pollio is recorded among the acts of generosity which Augustus\r\nsuggested to others. But before long the emperor turned his own attention\r\nto libraries, and enriched his capital with two splendid structures which\r\nmay be taken as types of Roman libraries,--the library of Apollo on the\r\nPalatine Hill, and that in the Campus Martius called after Octavia, sister\r\nto the emperor. I will take the latter first.\r\n\r\nThe _Porticus Octaviae_, or, as it was sometimes called, the _Opera\r\nOctaviae_, must have been one of the most magnificent structures in Rome\r\n(fig. 3). It stood in the Campus Martius, near the Theatre of Marcellus,\r\nbetween the Capitoline Hill and the Tiber. A double colonnade surrounded\r\nan area which measured 443 feet by 377 feet, with _Jani_, or four-faced\r\narchways, at the four corners, and on the side next the Tiber a double\r\nhexastyle porch, which, with a few fragments of the colonnade, still\r\nexists in a fairly good state of preservation[30]. Within this space were\r\ntwo temples, one of Jupiter, the other of Juno, a _curia_ or hall, in\r\nwhich the Senate frequently met, a _schola_ or \"Conversation Hall[31],\"\r\nand two libraries, the one of Greek, the other of Latin books. The area\r\nand buildings were crowded with masterpieces in bronze and marble.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Plan of the Porticus Octaviae, Rome. From _Formae\r\nUrbis Romae Antiqua_, Berlin, 1896.]\r\n\r\nThis structure was originally built by Quintus Metellus, about 146\r\nB.C.[32]. One of the temples was due to his own liberality, the other had\r\nbeen erected by Domitius Lepidus, B.C. 179. Now twenty years before,\r\nMetellus had fought in a successful campaign against Perseus king of\r\nMacedonia, in which the Romans had been assisted by Eumenes II.: and in\r\nB.C. 148, as Praetor, he received Macedonia as his province. Is it not\r\npossible that on one or other of these occasions he may have visited\r\nPergamon, and, when designing his buildings in Rome, have copied what he\r\nhad seen there? Again, in B.C. 157, Crates of Mallus, a distinguished\r\ngrammarian, was sent from Pergamon as ambassador to Rome, and, being laid\r\nup there by an accident, gave lectures on grammar, in the course of which\r\nhe could hardly have failed to mention the new library[33].\r\n\r\nThe buildings of Metellus were altered, if not entirely rebuilt, by\r\nAugustus, B.C. 33, out of the proceeds of his victorious campaign against\r\nthe Dalmatians; with the additional structures above enumerated. The\r\n_schola_ is believed to have stood behind the temples, and the libraries\r\nbehind the _schola_, with the _curia_ between them[34]. Thus the\r\ncolonnades, which Metellus had restricted to the two temples, came at last\r\nto serve the double purpose for which they were originally intended in\r\nconnexion with a library as well as with a temple.\r\n\r\nThe temple and area of Apollo on the Palatine Hill, which Augustus began\r\nB.C. 36 and dedicated B.C. 28, exhibit an arrangement precisely similar to\r\nthat of the Porticus Octaviae. The size was nearly the same[35], and the\r\nstructures included in the area were intended to serve the same purposes.\r\nThe temple stood in the middle of a large open peristyle, connected with\r\nwhich were two libraries, one for Greek, the other for Latin books; and\r\nbetween them, used perhaps as a reading-room or vestibule, was a hall in\r\nwhich Augustus occasionally convened the Senate. It contained a colossal\r\nstatue of Apollo, made of gilt bronze; and on its walls were\r\nportrait-reliefs of celebrated writers, in the form of medallions, in the\r\nsame material[36].\r\n\r\nOf the other public libraries of Rome--of which there are said to have\r\nbeen in all twenty-six--I need mention only three as possessing some\r\npeculiarity to which I shall have to draw attention. Of these the first\r\nwas established by Tiberius in his palace, at no great distance from the\r\nlibrary of Apollo; the second and third by Vespasian and Trajan in their\r\nFora, connected in the one with the temple of Peace, and in the other with\r\nthe temple dedicated in honour of Trajan himself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Plan of the Forum of Trajan; after Nibby.]\r\n\r\nOf the first two of these libraries we have no information; but in the\r\ncase of the third we are more fortunate. The Forum of Trajan (fig. 4) was\r\nexcavated by order of Napoleon I., and the extent of its buildings, with\r\ntheir relation to one another, is therefore known with approximate\r\naccuracy. The Greek and Latin libraries stood to the right and left of the\r\nsmall court between the _Basilica Ulpia_ and the _Templum Divi Trajani_,\r\nthe centre of which was marked by the existing Column. They were entered\r\nfrom this court, each through a portico of five inter-columniations. The\r\nrooms, measured internally, were about 60 feet long, by 45 feet broad.\r\n\r\nAt this point I must mention, parenthetically, the library built by\r\nHadrian at Athens. Pausanias records it in the following passage:\r\n\r\n    Hadrian also built for the Athenians a temple of Hera\r\n    and Panhellenian Zeus, and a sanctuary common to all the\r\n    gods. But most splendid of all are one hundred columns;\r\n    walls and colonnades alike are made of Phrygian marble.\r\n    Here, too, is a building adorned with a gilded roof and\r\n    alabaster and also with statues and paintings: books are\r\n    stored in it. There is also a gymnasium named after\r\n    Hadrian; it too has one hundred columns from the\r\n    quarries of Libya[37].\r\n\r\nA building called the Stoa of Hadrian, a ground-plan of which (fig. 5) I\r\nborrow from Miss Harrison's _Mythology and Monuments of Ancient Athens_,\r\nhas been identified with part at least of that which Pausanias describes\r\nin the above passage. A lofty wall, built of large square blocks of\r\nPentelic marble, faced on the west side by a row of Corinthian columns,\r\nenclosed a quadrangular court, measuring 328 feet from east to west, by\r\n250 feet from north to south. This court, entered through a sort of\r\npropylaea on the west side (N), was surrounded by a cloister or colonnade\r\n27 feet wide, and containing 100 columns. None of those columns are\r\nstanding, but their number can be accurately calculated from the marks of\r\nthe bases still to be seen on the eastern side of the quadrangle.\r\n\r\nWithin this area are the remains of a building of uncertain use, and at\r\npresent only partially excavated.\r\n\r\nOn the east side a row of five chambers, of which that in the centre was\r\nthe largest, opened off from the colonnade[38].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Plan of the Stoa of Hadrian, at Athens.\r\n\r\n  AE, KI. Pier-arcade of the medieval church of the Panagia.\r\n  B. North-east angle of this church, of Roman work.\r\n  B, C, D, F. Portions of the Roman building which preceded the church.\r\n  L, M. Reservoirs.\r\n  N. Propylaea through which the court was entered.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nIf the ground plan of this structure (fig. 5) be compared with that of the\r\nprecinct of Athena and library at Pergamon (fig. 2), a striking similarity\r\nbetween them will at once be recognised; and, whatever may have been the\r\ndestination of the building within the cloistered area, there can, I\r\nthink, be little doubt that the library was contained in the five rooms\r\nbeyond its limits to the east. They must have been entered from the\r\ncloister, much as those at Pergamon were. It is possible that Hadrian may\r\nhimself have visited Pergamon, for Trajan had built an imperial residence\r\nthere; but, even if he did not do this, he would accept the type from the\r\ngreat libraries built at Rome by Augustus. It should be mentioned that S.\r\nJerome specially commemorates this library among Hadrian's works at\r\nAthens, and says that it was of remarkable construction (_miri\r\noperis_)[39].\r\n\r\nFrom this brief digression I return to the public libraries of Rome. In\r\nthe first place those built by Augustus had a regular organisation. There\r\nappears to have been a general director called _Procurator Bibliothecarum\r\nAugusti_[40]; and subordinate officers for each division: that is to say,\r\none for the Greek books, one for the Latin books. These facts are derived\r\nfrom inscriptions found in _Columbaria_. Secondly, it may be concluded\r\nthat they were used not merely for reading and reference, but as\r\nmeeting-places for literary men.\r\n\r\nThe Palatine libraries evidently contained a large collection of old and\r\nnew books; and I think it is quite certain that new books, as soon as\r\npublished, were placed there, unless there was some special reason to the\r\ncontrary. Otherwise there would be no point in the lines in which Ovid\r\nmakes his book--sent from Pontus after his banishment--deplore its\r\nexclusion. The book is supposed to climb from the Forum to the temple of\r\nApollo:\r\n\r\n  Signa peregrinis ubi sunt alterna columnis\r\n    Belides et stricto barbarus ense pater\r\n  Quaeque viri docto veteres coepere novique\r\n    Pectore lecturis inspicienda patent.\r\n  Quaerebam fratres exceptis scilicet illis\r\n    Quos suus optaret non genuisse parens;\r\n  Quaerentem frustra custos e sedibus illis\r\n    Praepositus sancto iussit abire loco[41].\r\n\r\n    Where, set between each pair of columns from some\r\n    foreign quarry, are statues of the Danaids, and their\r\n    barbarous father with drawn sword; and where whatever\r\n    the minds of men of old or men of to-day have imagined,\r\n    is laid open for a reader's use. I sought my brethren,\r\n    save those of course whom their father would fain have\r\n    never begotten; and, while I was seeking for them in\r\n    vain, he who was set over the room bade me leave that\r\n    holy ground.\r\n\r\nThe second couplet can only mean that old books and new books were alike\r\nto be found there. The general nature of the collection, and its extent,\r\nmay be further gathered from the advice which Horace gives to his friend\r\nCelsus:\r\n\r\n  Quid mihi Celsus agit? monitus multumque monendus\r\n  Privatas ut quaerat opes, et tangere vitet\r\n  Scripta Palatinus quaecunque recepit Apollo[42].\r\n\r\n    What is my friend Celsus about? he who has been\r\n    reminded, and must still be reminded again and again,\r\n    that he should draw upon his own resources, and be\r\n    careful to avoid the multifarious writings which\r\n    Palatine Apollo has taken under his charge.\r\n\r\nA man might say now-a-days, \"Trust to your own wits, and don't go so often\r\nto the library of the British Museum.\"\r\n\r\nAulus Gellius, who lived A.D. 117-180, speaks of \"sitting with a party of\r\nfriends in the library of the palace of Tiberius, when a book happened to\r\nbe taken down with the title M. Catonis Nepotis,\" and they began asking\r\none another who this M. Cato Nepos might be[43]. This library contained\r\nalso public records[44].\r\n\r\nThe same writer tells a story of a grammatical difficulty which was to be\r\nsettled by reference to a book _in templo Pacis_, in the forum of\r\nVespasian; and again, when a particular book was wanted, \"we hunted for it\r\ndiligently,\" he says, \"and, when we had found it in the temple of Peace,\r\nwe read it[45].\"\r\n\r\nThe library in the forum of Trajan, often called _Bibliotheca Ulpia_, was\r\napparently the Public Record Office of Rome. Aulus Gellius mentions that\r\nsome decrees of former praetors had fallen in his way there when he was\r\nlooking for something else, and that he had been allowed to read them[46];\r\nand a statement of Vopiscus is still more conclusive as to the nature of\r\nits contents. It tells us, moreover, something about the arrangement. In\r\nhis life of the Emperor Tacitus (Sept. A.D. 275--Apr. 276) Vopiscus says:\r\n\r\n    And lest anybody should think that I have given too\r\n    hasty a credence to a Greek or Latin author, the Ulpian\r\n    Library has in its sixth press (_armarium_) an ivory\r\n    volume (_librum elephantinum_) in which the following\r\n    decree of the Senate, signed by Tacitus with his own\r\n    hand, is recorded, etc.[47]\r\n\r\nAgain, in his life of the Emperor Aurelian, the same writer records how\r\nhis friend Junius Tiberianus, prefect of the city, had urged him to\r\nundertake the task, and had assured him that: \"even the linen-books\r\n(_libri lintei_) shall be brought out of the Ulpian library for your\r\nuse[48].\"\r\n\r\nBooks could occasionally be borrowed from a public library, but whether\r\nfrom one of those in the city of Rome, I cannot say. The scene of the\r\nstory which proves this is laid by Aulus Gellius at Tibur (Tivoli), where\r\nthe library was in the temple of Hercules--another instance of the care of\r\na library being entrusted to a temple. Aulus Gellius and some friends of\r\nhis were assembled in a rich man's villa there at the hottest season of\r\nthe year. They were drinking melted snow, a proceeding against which one\r\nof the party, a peripatetic philosopher, vehemently protested, urging\r\nagainst the practice the authority of numerous physicians and of Aristotle\r\nhimself. But none the less the party went on drinking snow-water.\r\nWhereupon \"he fetched a treatise by Aristotle out of the library of Tibur,\r\nwhich was then very conveniently accommodated in the temple of Hercules,\r\nand brought it to us, saying----[49].\" But I need not finish the\r\nquotation, as it has no bearing on my special subject.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that numerous collections of books had been got together by\r\nindividuals in Rome, before it occurred to Augustus and his friends to\r\nerect public libraries. One such library, that belonging to the rich and\r\nluxurious Lucullus, has been noticed as follows by Plutarch[50]:\r\n\r\n    His procedure in regard to books was interesting and\r\n    remarkable. He collected fine copies in large numbers;\r\n    and if he was splendid in their acquisition, he was more\r\n    so in their use. His libraries were accessible to all,\r\n    and the adjoining colonnades and reading-rooms were\r\n    freely open to Greeks, who, gladly escaping from the\r\n    routine of business, resorted thither for familiar\r\n    converse, as to a shelter presided over by the Muses.\r\n\r\nThe Romans were not slow in following the example set by Lucullus; and a\r\nlibrary presently became indispensable in every house, whether the owner\r\ncared for reading or not. This fashionable craze is denounced by Seneca\r\n(writing about A.D. 49) in a vehement outburst of indignation, which\r\ncontains so many valuable facts about library arrangement, that I will\r\ngive a free translation of it.\r\n\r\n    Outlay upon studies, best of all outlays, is reasonable\r\n    so long only as it is kept within certain limits. What\r\n    is the use of books and libraries innumerable, if scarce\r\n    in a lifetime the master reads the titles? A student is\r\n    burdened by a crowd of authors, not instructed; and it\r\n    is far better to devote yourself to a few, than to lose\r\n    your way among a multitude.\r\n\r\n    Forty thousand books were burnt at Alexandria. I leave\r\n    others to praise this splendid monument of royal\r\n    opulence, as for example Livy, who regards it as \"a\r\n    noble work of royal taste and royal thoughtfulness.\" It\r\n    was not taste, it was not thoughtfulness, it was learned\r\n    extravagance--nay not even learned, for they had bought\r\n    their books for the sake of show, not for the sake of\r\n    learning--just as with many who are ignorant even of the\r\n    lowest branches of learning books are not instruments of\r\n    study, but ornaments of dining-rooms. Procure then as\r\n    many books as will suffice for use; but not a single one\r\n    for show. You will reply: \"Outlay on such objects is\r\n    preferable to extravagance on plate or paintings.\"\r\n    Excess in all directions is bad. Why should you excuse a\r\n    man who wishes to possess book-presses inlaid with\r\n    _arbor-vitae_ wood or ivory: who gathers together masses\r\n    of authors either unknown or discredited; who yawns\r\n    among his thousands of books; and who derives his chief\r\n    delight from their edges and their tickets?\r\n\r\n    You will find then in the libraries of the most arrant\r\n    idlers all that orators or historians have\r\n    written--book-cases built up as high as the ceiling.\r\n    Nowadays a library takes rank with a bathroom as a\r\n    necessary ornament of a house. I could forgive such\r\n    ideas, if they were due to extravagant desire for\r\n    learning. As it is, these productions of men whose\r\n    genius we revere, paid for at a high price, with their\r\n    portraits ranged in line above them, are got together to\r\n    adorn and beautify a wall[51].\r\n\r\nA library was discovered in Rome by Signor Lanciani in 1883 while\r\nexcavating a house of the 4th century on the Esquiline in the modern Via\r\ndello Statuto. I will narrate the discovery in his own words.\r\n\r\n    I was struck, one afternoon, with the appearance of a\r\n    rather spacious hall [it was about 23 feet long by 15\r\n    feet broad], the walls of which were plain and\r\n    unornamented up to a certain height, but beautifully\r\n    decorated above in stucco-work. The decoration consisted\r\n    of fluted pilasters, five feet apart from centre to\r\n    centre, enclosing a plain square surface, in the middle\r\n    of which there were medallions, also in stucco-work, two\r\n    feet in diameter. As always happens in these cases, the\r\n    frame was the only well-preserved portion of the\r\n    medallions. Of the images surrounded by the frames, of\r\n    the medallions themselves, absolutely nothing was left\r\n    _in situ_, except a few fragments piled up at the foot\r\n    of the wall, which, however, could be identified as\r\n    having been representations of human faces. My hope\r\n    that, at last, after fifteen years of excavations, I had\r\n    succeeded in discovering a library, was confirmed beyond\r\n    any doubt by a legend, written, or rather painted, in\r\n    bright red colour on one of the frames. There was but\r\n    one name POLONIVS THYAN ..., but this name told more\r\n    plainly the purpose of the apartment than if I had\r\n    discovered there the actual bookshelves and their\r\n    contents[52].\r\n\r\nWhen I had the pleasure of meeting Signor Lanciani in Rome in April, 1898,\r\nhe most kindly gave me his own sketch of the pilasters and medallion,\r\ntaken at the moment of discovery. I am therefore able to reproduce exactly\r\n(fig. 6) one compartment of the wall of the library above described. The\r\nheight of the blank wall below the stucco-work, against which the\r\nfurniture containing the books stood, has been laid down as about 3 feet 6\r\ninches, on the authority of Professor Middleton[53]. The remains of the\r\nmedallion are still to be seen in the Museo del Orto Botanico, Rome. The\r\nperson commemorated is obviously Apollonius Tyaneus, a Pythagorean\r\nphilosopher and wonderworker, said to have been born about four years\r\nbefore the Christian era.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Elevation of a single compartment of the wall of\r\nthe Library discovered in Rome, 1883.\r\n\r\nFrom notes and measurements made by Signor Lanciani and Prof. Middleton.]\r\n\r\nA similar room was discovered at Herculaneum in 1754. A full account of\r\nthe discovery was drawn up at once by Signor Paderni, keeper of the\r\nHerculaneum Museum, and addressed to Thomas Hollis, Esq., by whom it was\r\nsubmitted to the Royal Society. I will extract, from this and subsequent\r\nletters, the passages that bear upon my subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   _Naples, 27 April, 1754._\r\n\r\n    ... The place where they are digging, at present, is\r\n    under _Il Bosco di Sant' Agostino_.... All the buildings\r\n    discover'd in this site are noble; ... in one there has\r\n    been found an entire library, compos'd of volumes of the\r\n    Egyptian Papyrus, of which there have been taken out\r\n    about 250....[54]\r\n\r\n                   _To the same._\r\n\r\n                                         _18 October, 1754._\r\n\r\n    ... As yet we have only entered into one room, the floor\r\n    of which is formed of mosaic work, not unelegant. It\r\n    appears to have been a library, adorned with presses,\r\n    inlaid with different sorts of wood, disposed in rows;\r\n    at the top of which were cornices, as in our own times.\r\n\r\n    I was buried in this spot more than twelve days, to\r\n    carry off the volumes found there; many of which were so\r\n    perished, that it was impossible to remove them. Those\r\n    which I took away amounted to the number of three\r\n    hundred and thirty-seven, all of them at present\r\n    uncapable of being opened. These are all written in\r\n    Greek characters. While I was busy in this work I\r\n    observed a large bundle, which, from the size, I\r\n    imagined must contain more than a single volume. I tried\r\n    with the utmost care to get it out, but could not, from\r\n    the damp and weight of it. However I perceived that it\r\n    consisted of about 18 volumes, each of which was in\r\n    length a palm and three Neapolitan inches, being the\r\n    largest hitherto discovered. They were wrapped about\r\n    with the bark of a tree and covered at each end with a\r\n    piece of wood. All these were written in Latin, as\r\n    appears by a few words which broke off from them. I was\r\n    in hopes to have got something out of them, but they are\r\n    in a worse condition than the Greek[55]....\r\n\r\n                   _From Sir J. Gray, Bart._\r\n\r\n                                         _29 October, 1754._\r\n\r\n    ... They have lately met with more rolls of Papyri of\r\n    different lengths and sizes, some with the _Umbilicus_\r\n    remaining in them: the greater part are Greek in small\r\n    capitals.... The Epicurean Philosophy is the subject of\r\n    another fragment.\r\n\r\n    A small bust of Epicurus, with his name in Greek\r\n    characters, was found in the same room, and was possibly\r\n    the ornament of that part of the library where the\r\n    writings in favour of his principles were kept; and it\r\n    may also be supposed that some other heads of\r\n    philosophers found in the same room were placed with the\r\n    same taste and propriety[56].\r\n\r\nBetween 1758 and 1763, the place was visited by Winckelmann, who wrote\r\nlong letters in Italian, describing what he saw, to Consigliere Bianconi,\r\nPhysician to the King of Saxony. One of these, dated 1762, gives the\r\nfollowing account of the library:\r\n\r\n    Ii luogo in cui per la prima volta caddero sott' occhio,\r\n    fu una piccola stanza nella villa d'Ercolano di cui\r\n    parlammo sopra, la cui lunghezza due uomini colle\r\n    braccia distese potevano misurare. Tutto all' intorno\r\n    del muro vi erano degli scaffali quali si vedono\r\n    ordinariamente negli archivi ad altezza d' uomo, e nel\r\n    mezzo della stanza v' era un altro scaffale simile o\r\n    tavola per tenervi scritture, e tale da potervi girare\r\n    intorno. Il legno di questa tavola era ridotto a\r\n    carboni, e cadde, come e facile ad imaginarselo, tutta\r\n    in pezzi quando si tocco. Alcuni di questi rotoli di\r\n    papiri si trovarono involti insieme con carta piu\r\n    grossolana, di quella qualita che gli antichi chiamavano\r\n    _emporetica_, e questi probabilmente formavano le parti\r\n    ed i libri d' un' opera intiera[57]....\r\n\r\n    The place in which they [the rolls] were first seen was\r\n    a small room in the villa at Herculaneum of which we\r\n    spoke above, the length of which could be covered by two\r\n    men with their arms extended. All round the wall there\r\n    were book-cases such as are commonly seen in\r\n    record-rooms, of a man's height, and in the middle of\r\n    the room there was another similar book-case or table to\r\n    hold writings, of such a size that one could go round\r\n    it. The wood of this table was reduced to charcoal, and,\r\n    as may easily be imagined, fell all to pieces when it\r\n    was touched. Some of these papyrus rolls were found\r\n    fastened together with paper of coarser texture, of that\r\n    quality which the ancients called _emporetica_, and\r\n    these probably formed the parts and books of an entire\r\n    work.\r\n\r\nThe information which these observers have given us amounts to this: the\r\nroom was about 12 feet long, with a floor of mosaic. Against the walls\r\nstood presses, of a man's height, inlaid with different sorts of wood,\r\ndisposed in rows, with cornices at the top; and there was also a table, or\r\npress, in the centre of the room. Most of the rolls were separate, but a\r\nbundle of eighteen was found \"wrapped about with the bark of a tree, and\r\ncovered at each end with a piece of wood.\" A room so small as this could\r\nhardly have been intended for study. It must rather have been the place\r\nwhere the books were put away after they had been read elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBefore I quit this part of my subject, I should like to mention one other\r\nbuilding, as its arrangements throw light on the question of fitting up\r\nlibraries and record-offices. I allude to the structure built by\r\nVespasian, A.D. 78, to contain the documents relating to his restoration of\r\nthe city of Rome. It stood at the south-west corner of the Forum of Peace,\r\nand what now exists of it is known as the Church of SS. Cosma e Damiano.\r\n\r\nThe general arrangement and relation to adjoining structures will be\r\nunderstood from the plan (fig. 7). The room was about 125 feet long by 65\r\nfeet broad, with two entrances, one on the north-west, from the _Forum\r\nPacis_, through a hexastyle portico (fig. 7. 2), the other on the\r\nnorth-east, through a square-headed doorway of travertine which still\r\nexists (_ibid._ 1) together with a considerable portion of a massive wall\r\nof Vespasian's time. After a restoration by Caracalla the building came to\r\nbe called _Templum Sacrae Urbis_. It was first consecrated as a church by\r\npope Felix IV. (526-530), but he did little more than connect it with the\r\n_Heroon Romuli_ (_ibid._ 5), and build the apse (_ibid._ 4).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Plan of the Record-House of Vespasian, with the\r\nadjoining structures.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Part of the internal wall of the Record-House of\r\nVespasian.\r\n\r\nReduced from a sketch taken in the 16th century by Pirro Ligorio.]\r\n\r\nThe whole building was mercilessly mutilated by pope Urban VIII. in 1632;\r\nbut fortunately a drawing of the interior had been made by Pirro Ligorio\r\nin the second half of the sixteenth century, when the original treatment\r\nof the walls was practically intact. I give a reduced copy of a small\r\nportion of this drawing (fig. 8). As Lanciani says:\r\n\r\n    The walls were divided into three horizontal bands by\r\n    finely cut cornices. The upper band was occupied by the\r\n    windows; the lower was simply lined with marble slabs\r\n    covered by the bookcases ... which contained the ...\r\n    records ...; the middle one was incrusted with\r\n    tarsia-work of the rarest kinds of marble with panels\r\n    representing panoplies, the wolf with the infant\r\n    founders of Rome, and other allegorical scenes[58].\r\n\r\nI explained at the beginning of this chapter that my subject is the care\r\nof books, not books themselves; but, at the point which we have now\r\nreached in regard to Roman libraries, it is necessary to make a few\r\nremarks about their contents. It must be remembered, in the first place,\r\nthat those who fitted them up had to deal with rolls (_volumina_),\r\nprobably of papyrus, but possibly of parchment; and that a book, as we\r\nunderstand the word, the Latin equivalent for which was _codex_, did not\r\ncome into general use until long after the Christian era. Some points\r\nabout these rolls require notice.\r\n\r\nThe length and the width of the roll depended on the taste or convenience\r\nof the writer[59]. The contents were written in columns, the lines of\r\nwhich ran parallel to the long dimension[60], and the reader, holding the\r\nroll in both hands, rolled up the part he had finished with his left hand,\r\nand unrolled the unread portion with his right. This way of dealing with\r\nthe roll is well shewn in the accompanying illustration (fig. 9) reduced\r\nfrom a fresco at Pompeii[61]. In most examples the two halves of the roll\r\nare turned inwards, as for instance in the well-known statue of\r\nDemosthenes in the Vatican[62]. The end of the roll was fastened to a\r\nstick (usually referred to as _umbilicus_ or _umbilici_). It is obvious\r\nthat this word ought properly to denote the ends of the stick only, but it\r\nwas constantly applied to the whole stick, and not to a part of it, as for\r\ninstance in the following lines:\r\n\r\n    ... deus nam me vetat\r\n  Inceptos olim promissum carmen iambos\r\n    Ad umbilicum adducere[63].\r\n\r\n    ... for heaven forbids me to cover the scroll down to\r\n    the stick with the iambic lines I had begun a song\r\n    promised long ago to the world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. A reader with a roll: from a fresco at Pompeii.]\r\n\r\nThese sticks were sometimes painted or gilt, and furnished with projecting\r\nknobs (_cornua_) similarly decorated, intended to serve both as an\r\nornament, and as a contrivance to keep the ends of the roll even, while it\r\nwas being rolled up. The sides of the long dimension of the roll\r\n(_frontes_) were carefully cut, so as to be perfectly symmetrical, and\r\nafterwards smoothed with pumice-stone and coloured. A ticket (_index_ or\r\n_titulus_, in Greek [Greek: sillubos] or [Greek: sittubos]), made of a\r\npiece of papyrus or parchment, was fastened to the edge of the roll in\r\nsuch a way that it hung out over one or other of the ends. As Ovid says:\r\n\r\n  Cetera turba palam titulos ostendet apertos\r\n    Et sua detecta nomina fronte geret[64].\r\n\r\n    The others will flaunt their titles openly, and carry\r\n    their names on an uncovered edge.\r\n\r\nThe roll was kept closed by strings or straps (_lora_), usually of some\r\nbright colour[65]; and if it was specially precious, an envelope which the\r\nGreeks called a jacket ([Greek: diphthera][66]), made of parchment or some\r\nother substance, was provided. Says Martial:\r\n\r\n  Perfer Atestinae nondum vulgata Sabinae\r\n    Carmina, purpurea sed modo culta toga[67].\r\n\r\n    Convey to Sabina at Ateste these verses. They have not\r\n    yet been published, and have been but lately dressed in\r\n    a purple garment.\r\n\r\nMartial has combined in a single epigram most of the ornaments with which\r\nrolls could be decorated. This I will quote next, premising that the oil\r\nof cedar, or _arbor-vitae_, mentioned in the second line not only imparted\r\nan agreeable yellow colour, but was held to be an antiseptic[68].\r\n\r\n  Faustini fugis in sinum? sapisti.\r\n  Cedro nunc licet ambules perunctus\r\n  Et frontis gemino decens honore\r\n  Pictis luxurieris umbilicis,\r\n  Et te purpura delicata velet,\r\n  Et cocco rubeat superbus index[69].\r\n\r\nHis book had selected the bibliomaniac Faustinus as a patron. Now, says\r\nthe poet, you shall be anointed with oil of cedar; you shall revel in the\r\ndecoration of both your sets of edges; your sticks shall be painted; your\r\ncovering shall be purple, and your ticket scarlet.\r\n\r\nWhen a number of rolls had to be carried from one place to another, they\r\nwere put into a box (_scrinium_ or _capsa_). This receptacle was\r\ncylindrical in shape, not unlike a modern hat-box[70]. It was carried by a\r\nflexible handle, attached to a ring on each side; and the lid was held\r\ndown by what looks very like a modern lock. The eighteen rolls, found in a\r\nbundle at Herculaneum, had doubtless been kept in a similar receptacle.\r\n\r\nMy illustration (fig. 10) is from a fresco at Herculaneum. It will be\r\nnoticed that each roll is furnished with a ticket (_titulus_). At the feet\r\nof the statue of Demosthenes already referred to, and of that of\r\nSophocles, are _capsae_, both of which show the flexible handles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. Book-box or capsa.]\r\n\r\nI will next collect the information available respecting the fittings used\r\nin Roman libraries. I admit that it is scattered and imperfect; but\r\nlegitimate deductions may, I think, be arrived at from it, which will give\r\nus tolerably certain ideas of the appearance of one of those collections.\r\n\r\nThe words used to designate such fittings are: _nidus_; _forulus_, or more\r\nusually _foruli_; _loculamenta_; _pluteus_; _pegmata_.\r\n\r\n_Nidus_ needs no explanation. It can only mean a pigeon-hole. Martial uses\r\nit of a bookseller, at whose shop his own poems may be bought.\r\n\r\n  De primo dabit alterove _nido_\r\n  Rasum pumice purpuraque cultum\r\n  Denaris tibi quinque Martialem[71].\r\n\r\n    Out of his first or second pigeon-hole, polished with\r\n    pumice stone, and smart with a purple covering, for five\r\n    denarii he will give you Martial.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent epigram the word occurs with reference to a private\r\nlibrary, to which the poet is sending a copy of his works.\r\n\r\n  Ruris bibliotheca delicati,\r\n  Vicinam videt unde lector urbem,\r\n  Inter carmina sanctiora si quis\r\n  Lascivae fuerit locus Thaliae,\r\n  Hos _nido_ licet inseras vel imo\r\n  Septem quos tibi misimus libellos[72].\r\n\r\n    O library of that well-appointed villa whence a reader\r\n    can see the City near at hand--if among more serious\r\n    poems there be any room for the wanton Muse of Comedy,\r\n    you may place these seven little books I send you even\r\n    in your lowest pigeon-hole.\r\n\r\n_Forulus_ or _foruli_ occurs in the following passages. Suetonius, after\r\ndescribing the building of the temple of the Palatine Apollo by Augustus,\r\nadds, \"he placed the Sibylline books in two gilt receptacles (_forulis_)\r\nunder the base of the statue of Palatine Apollo\"[73]; and Juvenal,\r\nenumerating the gifts that a rich man is sure to receive if burnt out of\r\nhouse and home, says,\r\n\r\n  Hic libros dabit, et _forulos_, mediamque Minervam[74].\r\n\r\nThe word is of uncertain derivation, but _forus_, of which it is clearly\r\nthe diminutive, is used by Virgil for the cells of bees:\r\n\r\n  Complebuntque _foros_ et floribus horrea texent[75].\r\n\r\nThe above-quoted passage of Juvenal may therefore be rendered: \"Another\r\nwill give books, and cells to put them in, and a statue of Minerva for the\r\nmiddle of the room.\"\r\n\r\nThe word _loculamentum_ is explained in a passage of Columella, in which\r\nhe gives directions for the making of dovecotes:\r\n\r\n    Let small stakes be placed close together, with planks\r\n    laid across them to carry cells (_loculamenta_) for the\r\n    birds to build their nests in, or sets of pigeon-holes\r\n    made of earthenware[76].\r\n\r\nIn a second passage he uses the same word for a beehive[77]; Vegetius, a\r\nwriter on veterinary surgery, uses it for the socket of a horse's\r\ntooth[78]; and Vitruvius, in a more general way, for a case to contain a\r\nsmall piece of machinery[79]. Generally, the word may be taken to signify\r\na long narrow box, open at one end, and, like _nidus_ and _forulus_, may\r\nbe translated \"pigeon-hole.\" Seneca, again, applies the word to books in\r\nthe passage I have already translated, and in a singularly instructive\r\nmanner. \"You will find,\" he says, \"in the libraries of the most arrant\r\nidlers all that orators or historians have written--bookcases\r\n(_loculamenta_) built up as high as the ceiling[80].\"\r\n\r\n_Pegmata_, for the word generally occurs in the plural, are, as the name\r\nimplies, things fixed together, usually planks of wood framed into a\r\nplatform, and used in theatres to carry pieces of scenery or performers up\r\nand down. As applied to books \"shelves\" are probably meant: an\r\ninterpretation borne out by the _Digest_, in which it is stated that\r\n\"window-frames and _pegmata_ are included in the purchase of a house[81].\"\r\nThey were therefore what we should call \"fixtures.\"\r\n\r\nA _pluteus_ was a machine used by infantry for protection in the field:\r\nand hence the word is applied to any fence, or boarding to form the limit\r\nor edge of anything, as a table or a bed. _Plutei_ were not attached so\r\nclosely to the walls as _pegmata_, for in the _Digest_ they are classed\r\nwith nets to keep out birds, mats, awnings, and the like, and are not to\r\nbe regarded as part and parcel of a house[82]. Juvenal uses the word for\r\na shelf in his second Satire, where he is denouncing pretenders to\r\nknowledge:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Indocti primum, quamquam plena omnia gypso\r\n  Chrysippi invenias, nam perfectissimus horum est\r\n  Si quis Aristotelem similem vel Pittacon emit\r\n  Et iubet archetypos pluteum servare Cleanthas[83].\r\n\r\n    In the first place they are dunces, though you find\r\n    their houses full of plaster figures of Chrysippus: for\r\n    a man of this sort is not fully equipped until he buys a\r\n    likeness of Aristotle or Pittacus, and bids a shelf take\r\n    care of original portraits of Cleanthes.\r\n\r\nThis investigation has shewn that three of the words applied to the\r\npreservation of books, namely, _nidus_, _forulus_, and _loculamentum_, may\r\nbe rendered by the English \"pigeon-hole\"; and that _pegma_ and _pluteus_\r\nmean contrivances of wood which may be rendered by the English \"shelving.\"\r\nIt is quite clear that _pegmata_ could be run up with great rapidity, from\r\na very graphic account in Cicero's letters of the rearrangement of his\r\nlibrary. He begins by writing to his friend Atticus as follows:\r\n\r\n    I wish you would send me any two fellows out of your\r\n    library, for Tyrannio to make use of as pasters, and\r\n    assistants in other matters. Remind them to bring some\r\n    vellum with them to make those titles (_indices_) which\r\n    you Greeks, I believe, call [Greek: silluboi]. You are\r\n    not to do this if it is inconvenient to you[84]....\r\n\r\nIn the next letter he says:\r\n\r\n    Your men have made my library gay with their\r\n    carpentry-work and their titles (_constructione et\r\n    sillybis_). I wish you would commend them[85].\r\n\r\nWhen all is completed he writes:\r\n\r\n    Now that Tyrannio has arranged my books, a new spirit\r\n    has been infused into my house. In this matter the help\r\n    of your men Dionysius and Menophilus has been\r\n    invaluable. Nothing could look neater than those shelves\r\n    of yours (_illa tua pegmata_), since they smartened up\r\n    my books with their titles[86].\r\n\r\nNo other words than those I have been discussing are, so far as I know,\r\napplied by the best writers to the storage of books; and, after a careful\r\nstudy of the passages in which they occur, I conclude that, so long as\r\nrolls only had to be accommodated, private libraries in Rome were fitted\r\nwith rows of shelves standing against the walls (_plutei_), or fixed to\r\nthem (_pegmata_). The space between these horizontal shelves was\r\nsubdivided by vertical divisions into pigeon-holes (_nidi_, _foruli_,\r\n_loculamenta_), and it may be conjectured that the width of these\r\npigeon-holes would vary in accordance with the number of rolls included in\r\na single work. That such receptacles were the common furniture of a\r\nlibrary is proved, I think, by such evidence as the epigram of Martial\r\nquoted above, in which he tells his friend that if he will accept his\r\npoems, he may \"put them even in the lowest pigeon-hole (_nido vel imo_),\"\r\nas we should say, \"on the bottom shelf\"; and by the language of Seneca\r\nwhen he sneers at the \"pigeon-holes (_loculamenta_) carried up to the\r\nceiling.\"\r\n\r\nThe height of the woodwork varied, of course, with individual taste. In\r\nthe library on the Esquiline the height was only three feet six inches; at\r\nHerculaneum about six feet.\r\n\r\nI can find no hint of any doors, or curtains, in front of the\r\npigeon-holes. That the ends of the rolls (_frontes_) were visible, is, I\r\nthink, quite clear from what Cicero says of his own library after the\r\nconstruction of his shelves (_pegmata_); and the various devices for\r\nmaking rolls attractive seem to me to prove that they were intended to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nA representation of rolls arranged on the system which I have attempted to\r\ndescribe, occurs on a piece of sculpture (fig. 11) found at Neumagen near\r\nTreves in the seventeenth century, among the ruins of a fortified camp\r\nattributed to Constantine the Great[87]. Two divisions, full of rolls, are\r\nshewn, from which a man, presumably the librarian, is selecting one. The\r\nends of the rolls are furnished with tickets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. A Roman taking down a roll from its place in a\r\nlibrary.]\r\n\r\nThe system of pigeon-holes terminated, in all probability, in a cornice.\r\nThe explorers of Herculaneum depose to the discovery of such an ornament\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe wall-space above the book-cases was decorated with the likenesses of\r\ncelebrated authors--either philosophers, if the owner of the library\r\nwished to bring into prominence his adhesion to one of the fashionable\r\nsystems--or authors, dead and living, or personal friends. This obvious\r\nform of decoration was, in all probability, used at Pergamon[88]; Pollio,\r\nas we have seen, introduced it into Rome: and Pliny, who calls it a\r\nnovelty (_novitium inventum_), deposes to its general adoption[89]. We are\r\nnot told how these portraits were commonly treated--whether they were\r\nbusts standing clear of the wall on the book-cases; or bracketed against\r\nthe wall; or forming part of its decoration, in plaster-work or distemper.\r\nA suitable inscription accompanied them. Martial has preserved for us a\r\ncharming specimen of one of these complimentary stanzas--for such they\r\nundoubtedly would be in the case of a contemporary--to be placed beneath\r\nhis own portrait in a friend's library:\r\n\r\n  Hoc tibi sub nostra breve carmen imagine vivat\r\n    Quam non obscuris iungis, Avite, viris:\r\n  _Ille ego sum nulli nugarum laude secundus,\r\n    Quem non miraris, sed puto, lector, amas.\r\n  Maiores maiora sonent: mihi parva locuto\r\n    Sufficit in vestras saepe redire manus_[90].\r\n\r\n  Placed, with my betters, on your study-wall\r\n  Let these few lines, Avitus, me recall:\r\n  _To foremost rank in trifles I was raised;\r\n  I think men loved me, though they never praised.\r\n  Let greater poets greater themes profess:\r\n  My modest lines seek but the hand's caress\r\n  That tells me, reader, of thy tenderness._\r\n\r\nThe beautiful alto-relievo in the Lateran Museum, Rome, representing an\r\nactor selecting a mask, contains a contrivance for reading a roll (fig.\r\n12) which may have been usual in libraries and elsewhere, though I have\r\nnot met with another instance of it. A vertical support attached to the\r\ntable on which two masks and a MS. are lying, carries a desk with a rim\r\nalong its lower edge and one of its sides. The roll is partially opened,\r\nthe closed portion lying towards the left side of the desk, next the rim.\r\nThe roll may be supposed to contain the actor's part[91].\r\n\r\nIt is much to be regretted that we have no definite information as to the\r\nway in which the great public libraries built by Augustus were fitted up;\r\nbut I see no reason for supposing that their fittings differed from those\r\nof private libraries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. Desk to support a roll while it is being read.]\r\n\r\nWhen books (_codices_), of a shape similar to that with which modern\r\nlibrarians have to deal, had to be accommodated as well as rolls, it is\r\nmanifest that rectangular spaces not more than a few inches wide would be\r\nsingularly inconvenient. They were therefore discarded in favour of a\r\npress (_armarium_), a piece of furniture which would hold rolls\r\n(_volumina_) as well as books (_codices_), and was in fact, as I shall\r\nshew, used for both purposes. The word (_armarium_) occurs commonly in\r\nCicero, and other writers of the best period, for a piece of furniture in\r\nwhich valuables of all kinds, and household gear, were stowed away; and\r\nVitruvius[92] uses it for a book-case. A critic, he says, \"produced from\r\ncertain presses an infinite number of rolls.\" In later Latin writers--that\r\nis from the middle of the first century A.D.--no other word, speaking\r\ngenerally, occurs.\r\n\r\nThe jurist Ulpian, who died A.D. 228, in a discussion as to what is\r\ncomprised under the term _liber_, decides in favour of including all rolls\r\n(_volumina_) of whatever material, and then considers the question whether\r\n_codices_ come under the same category or not--thereby shewing that in his\r\nday both forms of books were in use. Again, when a library (_bibliotheca_)\r\nhas been bequeathed, it is questioned whether the bequest includes merely\r\nthe press or presses (_armarium vel armaria_), or the books as well[93].\r\n\r\nThe Ulpian Library, or rather Libraries, in Trajan's Forum, built about\r\n114 A.D.[94], were fitted up with presses, as we learn from the passage in\r\nVopiscus which I have already quoted; and when the ruins of the section of\r\nthat library which stood next to the Quirinal Hill were excavated by the\r\nFrench, a very interesting trace of one of these presses was discovered.\r\nNibby, the Roman antiquary, thus describes it:\r\n\r\n    Beyond the above-mentioned bases [of the columns in the\r\n    portico] some remains of the inside of the room became\r\n    visible on the right. They consisted of a piece of\r\n    curtain-wall, admirably constructed of brick, part of\r\n    the side-wall, with a rectangular niche of large size in\r\n    the form of a press (_in foggia di armadio_). One\r\n    ascended to this by three steps, with a landing-place in\r\n    front of them, on which it was possible to stand with\r\n    ease. On the sides of this niche there still exist\r\n    traces of the hinges, on which the panels and the\r\n    wickets, probably of bronze, rested[95].\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that we have here an early instance, perhaps the earliest,\r\nof those presses in the thickness of the wall which were so common\r\nafterwards in the monasteries and in private libraries also. A similar\r\npress, on a smaller scale, is described by the younger Pliny: \"My\r\nbedroom,\" he says, \"has a press let into the wall which does duty as a\r\nlibrary, and holds books not merely to be read, but read over and over\r\nagain[96].\"\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be supposed that cupboards were always, or even\r\nusually, sunk into the wall in Roman times. They were detached pieces of\r\nfurniture, not unlike the wardrobes in which ladies hang their dresses at\r\nthe present day, except that they were fitted with a certain number of\r\nhorizontal shelves, and were used for various purposes according to the\r\nrequirements of their owners. For instance, there is a sarcophagus in the\r\nMuseo Nazionale at Rome, on which is represented a shoemaker at work. In\r\nfront of him is a cupboard, exactly like those I am about to describe, on\r\nthe top of which several pairs of shoes are set out.\r\n\r\nI can, however, produce three representations of such presses being used\r\nby the Romans to contain books.\r\n\r\nThe first occurs on a marble sarcophagus (fig. 13), now in the garden of\r\nthe Villa Balestra, Rome, where I had the good fortune to find it in\r\n1898[97]; and Professor Petersen, of the German Archaeological School, was\r\nso kind as to have it photographed for me. He assigns the work to about\r\n200 A.D.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. A Roman reading a roll in front of a press\r\n(_armarium_).\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph of a sarcophagus in the garden of the Villa Balestra.\r\nRome.]\r\n\r\nIn the central portion, 21 in. high, by 15 1/2 in. wide, is a seated\r\nfigure, reading a roll. In front of him is a cupboard, the doors of which\r\nare open. It is fitted with two shelves, on the uppermost of which are\r\neight rolls, the ends of which are turned to the spectator. On the next\r\nshelf is something which looks like a dish or shallow cup. The lower part\r\nof the press is solid. Perhaps a second cupboard is intended. Above, it is\r\nfinished off with a cornice, on which rests a very puzzling object. There\r\nare a few faint lines on the marble, which Professor Petersen believes are\r\nintended to represent surgical instruments, and so to indicate the\r\nprofession of the seated figure[98]. There is a Greek inscription on the\r\nsarcophagus, but it merely warns posterity not to disturb the bones of the\r\ndeceased[99].\r\n\r\nThe second representation (fig. 14) is from the tomb of Galla Placidia, at\r\nRavenna. It occurs in a mosaic on the wall of the chapel in which she was\r\nburied, A.D. 449[100]; and was presumably executed before that date. The\r\npress closely resembles the one on the Roman sarcophagus, but it is\r\nevidently intended to indicate a taller piece of furniture, and it\r\nterminates in a pediment. There are two shelves, on which lie the four\r\nGospels, each as a separate _codex_, indicated by the name of the\r\nEvangelist above it. This press rests upon a stout frame, the legs of\r\nwhich are kept in position by a cross-piece nearly as thick as themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. Press containing the four Gospels.\r\n\r\nFrom a mosaic above the tomb of the Empress Galla Placidia at Ravenna.]\r\n\r\nThe third representation of an _armarium_ (fig. 15) occurs in the\r\nmanuscript of the Vulgate now in the Laurentian Library at Florence, known\r\nas the _Codex Amiatinus_, from the Cistercian convent of Monte Amiata in\r\nTuscany, where it was preserved for several centuries[101]. The thorough\r\ninvestigation to which this manuscript has lately been subjected shews\r\nthat it was written in England, at Wearmouth or Jarrow, but possibly by an\r\nItalian scribe, before A.D. 716, in which year it was taken to Rome, as a\r\npresent to the Pope. The first quaternion, however, on one of the leaves\r\nof which the above representation occurs, is probably older; and it may\r\nhave belonged to a certain _Codex grandior_ mentioned by Cassiodorus, and\r\npossibly written under his direction[102].\r\n\r\nThe picture (fig. 15), which appears as the frontispiece to this work,\r\nshews Ezra writing the law. On the margin of the vellum, in a hand which\r\nis considered to be later than that of the MS., are the words:\r\n\r\n    CODICIBUS SACRIS HOSTILI CLADE PERVSTIS\r\n    ESDRA DEO FERVENS HOC REPARAVIT OPUS.\r\n\r\nBehind him is a press (_armarium_) with open doors. The lower portion,\r\nbelow these doors, is filled in with panels which are either inlaid or\r\npainted, so that the frame on which it is supported is not visible, as in\r\nthe Ravenna example. The bottom of the press proper is used as a shelf, on\r\nwhich lie a volume and two objects, one of which probably represents a\r\ncase for pens, while the other is certainly an inkhorn. Above this are\r\nfour shelves, on each of which lie two volumes. These volumes have their\r\ntitles written on their backs, but they are difficult to make out, and my\r\nartist has not cared to risk mistakes by attempting to reproduce them. The\r\nwords, beginning at the left hand corner of the top-shelf, are:\r\n\r\n  OCT.[103] LIB.     REG.\r\n  HIST. LIB.       PSALM. LIB.\r\n  SALOMON.         PROPH.\r\n  EVANG. IIII.     EPIST. XXI.\r\n  ACT. APOSTOL.\r\n\r\nThe frame-work of the press above the doors is ornamented in the same\r\nstyle as the panels below, and the whole is surmounted by a low pyramid,\r\non the side of which facing the spectator is a cross, beneath which are\r\ntwo peacocks drinking from a water-trough.\r\n\r\nI regret that I could not place this remarkable drawing before my readers\r\nin the rich colouring of the original. The press is of a reddish brown:\r\nthe books are bound in crimson. Ezra is clad in green, with a crimson\r\nrobe. The background is gold. The border is blue, between an inner and\r\nouter band of silver. The outermost band of all is vermilion.\r\n\r\nI formerly thought that this book-press might represent those in use in\r\nEngland at the beginning of the eighth century; but, if the above\r\nattribution to Cassiodorus be accurate, it must be accounted another\r\nItalian example. It bears a general similarity to the Ravenna book-press,\r\nas might be expected, when it is remembered that Cassiodorus held office\r\nunder Theodoric and his successors, and resided at Ravenna till he was\r\nnearly seventy years old.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of Christianity did not alter what I may call the Roman\r\nconception of a library in any essential particular. The philosophers and\r\nauthors of Greece and Rome may have occasionally found themselves in\r\ncompany with, or even supplanted by, the doctors of the Church; but in\r\nother respects, for the first seven centuries, at least, of our era, the\r\nlearned furnished their libraries according to the old fashion, though\r\nwith an ever increasing luxury of material. Boethius, whose _Consolation\r\nof Philosophy_ was written A.D. 525, makes Philosophy speak of the \"walls\r\nof a library adorned with ivory and glass[104]\"; and Isidore, Bishop of\r\nSeville A.D. 600-636, records that \"the best architects object to gilded\r\nceilings in libraries, and to any other marble than _cipollino_ for the\r\nfloor, because the glitter of gold is hurtful to the eyes, while the green\r\nof _cipollino_ is restful to them[105].\"\r\n\r\nA few examples of such libraries may be cited; but, before doing so, I\r\nmust mention the Record-Office (_Archivum_), erected by Pope Damasus\r\n(366-384). It was connected with the Basilica of S. Lawrence, which\r\nDamasus built in the Campus Martius, near the theatre of Pompey. On the\r\nfront of the Basilica, over the main entrance, was an inscription, which\r\nended with the three following lines:\r\n\r\n    ARCHIVIS FATEOR VOLUI NOVA CONDERE TECTA ADDERE PRAETEREA\r\n    DEXTRA LAEVAQUE COLUMNAS QUAE DAMASI TENEANT PROPRIUM PER\r\n    SAECULA NOMEN.\r\n\r\n    I confess that I have wished to build a new abode for\r\n    Archives; and to add columns on the right and left to\r\n    preserve the name of Damasus for ever.\r\n\r\nThese enigmatical verses contain all that we know, or are ever likely to\r\nknow, respecting this building, which is called _chartarium ecclesiae\r\nRomanae_ by S. Jerome[106], and unquestionably held the official documents\r\nof the Latin Church until they were removed to the Lateran in the seventh\r\ncentury. The whole building, or group of buildings, was destroyed in 1486\r\nby Cardinal Raphael Riario, the dissolute nephew of Sixtus IV., to make\r\nroom for his new palace, now called Palazzo della Cancelleria, and the\r\nchurch was rebuilt on a new site. The connexion with Pope Damasus is\r\nmaintained by the name, S. Lorenzo in Damaso. No plan of the old\r\nbuildings, or contemporary record of their arrangement, appears to exist.\r\nMy only reason for drawing attention to a structure which has no real\r\nconnexion with my subject is that the illustrious De Rossi considers that\r\nin the second line of the above quotation the word column signifies\r\ncolonnades; and that Damasus took as his model one of the great pagan\r\nlibraries of Rome which, in its turn, had been derived from the typical\r\nlibrary at Pergamon[107]. According to this view he began by building, in\r\nthe centre of the area selected, a basilica, or hall of basilican type,\r\ndedicated to S. Lawrence; and then added, on the north and south sides, a\r\ncolonnade or loggia from which the rooms occupied by the records would be\r\nreadily accessible. This opinion is also held by Signor Lanciani, who\r\nfollows De Rossi without hesitation. I am unwilling to accept a theory\r\nwhich seems to me to have no facts to support it; and find it safer to\r\nbelieve that the line in question refers either to the aisles of the\r\nbasilica, or to such a portico in front of it as may be seen at San\r\nClemente and other early churches.\r\n\r\nA letter to Eucherius, Bishop of Lyons in A.D. 441, from a correspondent\r\nnamed Rusticus, gives a charming picture of a library which he had visited\r\nin his young days, say about A.D. 400:\r\n\r\n    I am reminded of what I read years ago, hastily, as a\r\n    boy does, in the library of a man who was learned in\r\n    secular literature. There were there portraits of\r\n    Orators and also of Poets worked in mosaic, or in wax of\r\n    different colours, or in plaster, and under each the\r\n    master of the house had placed inscriptions noting their\r\n    characteristics; but, when he came to a poet of\r\n    acknowledged merit, as for instance, Virgil, he began as\r\n    follows:\r\n\r\n  Virgilium vatem melius sua carmina laudant;\r\n  In freta dum fluvii current, dum montibus umbrae\r\n  Lustrabunt convexa, polus dum sidera pascet,\r\n  Semper honos nomenque tuum laudesque manebunt.\r\n\r\n  Virgil's own lines most fitly Virgil praise:\r\n  As long as rivers run into the deep,\r\n  As long as shadows o'er the hillside sweep,\r\n  As long as stars in heaven's fair pastures graze,\r\n  So long shall live your honour, name, and praise.[108]\r\n\r\n\r\nAgapetus, who was chosen Pope in 535, and lived for barely a year, had\r\nintended, in conjunction with Cassiodorus, to found a college for teachers\r\nof Christian doctrine. He selected for this purpose a house on the Caelian\r\nHill, afterwards occupied by S. Gregory, and by him turned into a\r\nmonastery. Agapetus had made some progress with the scheme, so far as the\r\nlibrary attached to the house was concerned, for the author of the\r\nEinsiedlen MS., who visited Rome in the ninth century, saw the following\r\ninscription \"in the library of S. Gregory\"--i.e. in the library attached\r\nto the Church of San Gregorio Magno.\r\n\r\n  SANCTORVM VENERANDA COHORS SEDET ORDINE LONGO\r\n    DIVINAE LEGIS MYSTICA DICTA DOCENS\r\n  HOS INTER RESIDENS AGAPETVS IVRE SACERDOS\r\n    CODICIBVS PVLCHRVM CONDIDIT ARTE LOCVM\r\n  GRATIA PAR CVNCTIS SANCTVS LABOR OMNIBVS VNVS\r\n    DISSONA VERBA QVIDEM SED TAMEN VNA FIDES\r\n\r\n  Here sits in long array a reverend troop\r\n  Teaching the mystic truths of law divine:\r\n  'Mid these by right takes Agapetus place\r\n  Who built to guard his books this fair abode.\r\n  All toil alike, all equal grace enjoy--\r\n  Their words are different, but their faith the same.\r\n\r\nThese lines undoubtedly imply that there was on the walls a long series of\r\nportraits of the Fathers of the Church, including that of Agapetus\r\nhimself, who had won his right to a place among them by building a\r\nsumptuous home for their works[109].\r\n\r\nThe design of Agapetus, interrupted by death, was carried forward by his\r\nfriend Cassiodorus, at a place in South Italy called Vivarium, near his\r\nown native town Squillace. Shortly after his final retirement from court,\r\nA.D. 538, Cassiodorus established there a brotherhood, which, for a time at\r\nleast, must have been a formidable rival to that of S. Benedict. A library\r\nheld a prominent place in his conception of what was needed for their\r\ncommon life. He says little about its size or composition, but much\r\nrhetoric is expended on the contrivances by which its usefulness and\r\nattractiveness were to be increased. A staff of bookbinders was to clothe\r\nthe manuscripts in decorous attire; self-supplying lamps were to light\r\nnocturnal workers; sundials by day, and water-clocks by night, enabled\r\nthem to regulate their hours. Here also was a _scriptorium_, and it\r\nappears probable that between the exertions of Cassiodorus and his friend\r\nEugippius, South Italy was well supplied with manuscripts[110].\r\n\r\nThese attempts to snatch from oblivion libraries which, though probably\r\naccording to our ideas insignificant, were centres of culture in the\r\ndarkest of dark ages, will be illustrated by the fuller information that\r\nhas come down to us respecting the library of Isidore, Bishop of Seville\r\n600-636. The \"verses composed by himself for his own presses,\" to quote\r\nthe oldest manuscript containing them[111], have been preserved, with the\r\nnames of the writers under whose portraits they were inscribed.\r\n\r\nThere were fourteen presses, arranged as follows:\r\n\r\n  I.       Origen.\r\n  II.      Hilary.\r\n  III.     Ambrose.\r\n  IV.      Augustine.\r\n  V.       Jerome.\r\n  VI.      Chrysostom.\r\n  VII.     Cyprian.\r\n  VIII.    Prudentius.\r\n  IX.      Avitus, Juvencus, Sedulius.\r\n  X.       Eusebius, Orosius.\r\n  XI.      Gregory.\r\n  XII.     Leander.\r\n  XIII.    Theodosius, Paulus, Gaius.\r\n  XIV.     Cosmas, Damian, Hippocrates, Galen.\r\n\r\nThese writers are probably those whom Isidore specially admired, or had\r\nsome particular reason for commemorating. The first seven are obvious\r\ntypes of theologians, and the presses over which they presided were\r\ndoubtless filled not merely with their own works, but with bibles,\r\ncommentaries, and works on Divinity in general. Eusebius and Orosius are\r\ntypes of ecclesiastical historians; Theodosius, Paulus, and Gaius, of\r\njurists; Cosmas, Damian, etc. of physicians. But the Christian poets\r\nPrudentius to Sedulius could hardly have needed two presses to contain\r\ntheir works; nor Gregory the Great the whole of one. Lastly, Leander,\r\nIsidore's elder brother, could only owe his place in the series to\r\nfraternal affection. I conjecture that these portraits were simply\r\ncommemorative; and that the presses beneath them contained the books on\r\nsubjects not suggested by the rest of the portraits, as for example,\r\nsecular literature, in which Isidore was a proficient.\r\n\r\nThe sets of verses[112] begin with three elegiac couplets headed _Titulus\r\nBibliothece_, probably placed over the door of entrance.\r\n\r\n  Sunt hic plura sacra, sunt hic mundalia plura:\r\n    Ex his si qua placent carmina, tolle, lege.\r\n  Prata vides, plena spinis, et copia florum;\r\n    Si non vis spinas sumere, sume rosas.\r\n  Hic geminae radiant veneranda volumina legis;\r\n    Condita sunt pariter hic nova cum veteri.\r\n\r\n  Here sacred books with worldly books combine;\r\n  If poets please you, read them; they are thine.\r\n  My meads are full of thorns, but flowers are there;\r\n  If thorns displease, let roses be your share.\r\n  Here both the Laws in tomes revered behold;\r\n  Here what is new is stored, and what is old.\r\n\r\nThe authors selected are disposed of either in a single couplet, or in\r\nseveral couplets, according to the writer's taste. I will quote the lines\r\non S. Augustine:\r\n\r\n  Mentitur qui [te] totum legisse fatetur:\r\n    An quis cuneta tua lector habere potest?\r\n  Namque voluminibus mille, Augustine, refulges,\r\n    Testantur libri, quod loquor ipse, tui.\r\n  Quamvis multorum placeat prudentia libris,\r\n    Si Augustinus adest, sufficit ipse tibi.\r\n\r\n  They lie who to have read thee through profess;\r\n  Could any reader all thy works possess?\r\n  A thousand scrolls thy ample gifts display;\r\n  Thy own books prove, Augustine, what I say.\r\n  Though other writers charm with varied lore,\r\n  Who hath Augustine need have nothing more.\r\n\r\nThe series concludes with some lines \"To an Intruder (_ad\r\nInterventorem_),\" the last couplet of which is too good to be omitted:\r\n\r\n  Non patitur quenquam coram se scriba loquentem;\r\n    Non est hic quod agas, garrule, perge foras.\r\n\r\n  A writer and a talker can't agree:\r\n  Hence, idle chatterer; 'tis no place for thee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16. Great Hall of the Vatican Library, looking west.]\r\n\r\nWith these three examples I conclude the section of my work which deals\r\nwith what may be called the pagan conception of a library in the fulness\r\nof its later development. Unfortunately, no enthusiast of those distant\r\ntimes has handed down to us a complete description of his library, and we\r\nare obliged to take a detail from one account, and a detail from another,\r\nand so piece the picture together for ourselves. What I may call \"the\r\npigeon-hole system,\" suitable for rolls only, was replaced by presses\r\nwhich could contain rolls if required, and certainly did (as shewn (fig.\r\n13) on the sarcophagus of the Villa Balestra), but which were specially\r\ndesigned for _codices_. These presses were sometimes plain, sometimes\r\nrichly ornamented, according to the taste or the means of the owner. With\r\nthe same limitations the floor, the walls, and possibly the roof also were\r\ndecorated. Further, it was evidently intended that the room selected for\r\nbooks should be used for no other purpose; and, as the books were hidden\r\nfrom view in their presses, the library-note, if I may be allowed the\r\nexpression, was struck by numerous inscriptions, and by portraits in\r\nvarious materials, representing either authors whose works were on the\r\nshelves, or men distinguished in other ways, or friends and relations of\r\nthe owner of the house.\r\n\r\nThe Roman conception of a library was realised by Pope Sixtus V., in\r\n1587[113], when the present Vatican Library was commenced from the design\r\nof the architect Fontana. I am not aware that there is any contemporary\r\nrecord to prove that either the Pope or his advisers contemplated this\r\ndirect imitation; but it is evident, from the most cursory inspection of\r\nthe large room (fig. 16), that the main features of a Roman library are\r\nbefore us[114]; and perhaps, having regard to the tendency of the\r\nRenaissance, especially in Italy, it would be unreasonable to expect a\r\ndifferent design in such a place, and at such a period.\r\n\r\nThis noble hall--probably the most splendid apartment ever assigned to\r\nlibrary-purposes--spans the Cortile del Belvedere from east to west, and\r\nis entered at each end from the galleries connecting the Belvedere with\r\nthe Vatican palace. It is 184 feet long, and 57 feet wide, divided into\r\ntwo by six piers, on which rest simple quadripartite vaults. The north and\r\nsouth walls are each pierced with seven large windows. No books are\r\nvisible. They are contained in plain wooden presses 7 feet high and 2 feet\r\ndeep, set round the piers, and against the walls between the windows. The\r\narrangement of these presses will be understood from the general view\r\n(fig. 16), and from the view of a single press open (fig. 17).\r\n\r\nIn the decoration, with which every portion of the walls and vaults is\r\ncovered, Roman methods are reproduced, but with a difference. The great\r\nwriters of antiquity are conspicuous by their absence; but the\r\ndevelopment of the human race is commemorated by the presence of those\r\nto whom the invention of letters is traditionally ascribed; the walls\r\nare covered with frescoes representing the foundation of the great\r\nlibraries which instructed the world, and the assemblies of the Councils\r\nwhich established the Church; the vaults record the benefits conferred\r\non Rome by Sixtus V., in a series of historical views, one above each\r\nwindow; and over these again are stately figures, each embodying some\r\nsacred abstraction--\"Thrones, dominations, princedoms, virtues,\r\npowers\"--with angels swinging censers, and graceful nymphs, and laughing\r\nsatyrs--a strange combination of paganism and Christianity--amid wreaths\r\nof flowers, and arabesques twining round the groups and over every\r\nvacant space, partly framing, partly hiding, the heraldic devices which\r\ncommemorate Sixtus and his family:--a web of lovely forms and brilliant\r\ncolours, combined in an intricate and yet orderly confusion.\r\n\r\nIt may be questioned whether such a room as this was ever intended for\r\nstudy. The marble floor, the gorgeous decoration, the absence of all\r\nappliances for work in the shape of desks, tables, chairs, suggest a place\r\nfor show rather than for use. The great libraries of the Augustan age, on\r\nthe other hand, seem, so far as we can judge, to have been used as\r\nmeeting-places and reading-rooms for learned and unlearned alike. In\r\ngeneral arrangement and appearance, however, the Vatican Library must\r\nclosely resemble its imperial predecessors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.

Nevile's\r\nCourt is 230 feet long from the inside of the pillars supporting the\r\nLibrary to the wall of the Hall; and it has a mean breadth of 137 feet. If\r\nthe width of the cloister, 20 feet, be added to this, we get 157 feet in\r\nlieu of the 162 feet at Pergamon.\r\n\r\n[24] Now in the Royal Museum, Berlin.\r\n\r\n[25] Similar sockets have been discovered in the walls of the chambers\r\nconnected with the Stoa of King Attalus at Athens.

The diagrammatic ground-plan (fig.\r\n18) which accompanies this description, if studied in conjunction with the\r\ngeneral view (fig. 16), will make the relation of the subjects to each\r\nother perfectly clear. The visitor is supposed to enter the Library from\r\nthe vestibule at the east end; and the notation of the piers, windows,\r\nwall-frescoes, etc., begins from the same end. Further, the visitor is\r\nsupposed to examine the east face of each pier first, and then to turn to\r\nthe left.\r\n\r\nI will begin with the figures on the central piers and half-piers. These\r\nfigures are painted in fresco, of heroic size: and over their heads are\r\nthe letters which they are supposed to have invented.\r\n\r\n1. PILASTER AGAINST EAST WALL.\r\n\r\n  ADAM.\r\n\r\n  A tall stalwart figure dressed in short chiton. He holds an apple in his\r\n  left hand, and a mattock in his right.\r\n\r\n  Adam divinitus edoctus primus scientiarum et litterarum inventor.\r\n\r\n2.

PILASTER AGAINST WEST WALL.\r\n\r\n  CHRIST.\r\n\r\n  Our Lord is seated. Over His Head [Greek: Alpha], [Greek: Omega]; in His\r\n  Hand an open book: Ego sum [Greek: Alpha] et [Greek: Omega]; principium\r\n  et finis. At His Feet: Iesus Christus summus magister, caelestis doctrinae\r\n  auctor.\r\n\r\n  On Christ's right hand is a POPE, standing, with triple cross and tiara.\r\n\r\n  Christi Domini vicarius.\r\n\r\n  On Christ's left hand is an EMPEROR, also standing, with crown, sword,\r\n  blue mantle.\r\n\r\n  Ecclesiae defensor.\r\n\r\nI will now pass to the decoration of the walls. On the south wall, between\r\nthe windows, are representations of famous libraries; on the north wall,\r\nof the eight general Councils of the Church. Each space is ornamented with\r\na broad border, like a picture-frame. In the centre above is the general\r\ntitle of the subject or subjects below: e.g. _Bibliotheca Romanorum_; and\r\nbeneath each picture is an inscription describing the special subject.\r\nAbove each window, on the vault, is a large picture, to commemorate the\r\nbenefits conferred by Sixtus V. on Rome and on the world. I will describe\r\nthe libraries first, beginning as before at the east end of the room.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. SIXTUS V. AND THE ARCHITECT FONTANA.\r\n\r\n(Right of Entrance.)\r\n\r\n    Sixtus V. Pont. M. Bibliothecae Vaticanae aedificationem\r\n    prescribit.\r\n\r\nThe Pope is seated. Fontana, a pair of compasses in his right hand, is on\r\none knee, exhibiting the plan of the intended library.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. MOSES ENTRUSTS THE TABLES OF THE LAW TO THE LEVITES.\r\n\r\n(Left of Entrance.)\r\n\r\n    Moyses librum legis Levitis in tabernaculo reponendum\r\n    tradit.\r\n\r\nMoses hands a large folio to a Levite, behind whom more Levites are\r\nstanding. Soldiers, etc., stand behind Moses. Tents in background.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. BIBLIOTHECA HEBRAEA.\r\n\r\n(On first wall-space south side.)\r\n\r\n    Esdras sacerdos et scriba Bibliothecam sacram restituit.\r\n\r\nEzra, attired in a costume that is almost Roman, stands in the centre of\r\nthe picture, his back half turned to the spectator. An official is\r\npointing to a press full of books. Porters are bringing in others.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. BIBLIOTHECA BABYLONICA.\r\n\r\n(Two pictures.)\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The education of Daniel in Babylon._\r\n\r\n    Daniel et socii linguam scientiamque Chaldaeorum\r\n    ediscunt.\r\n\r\nDaniel and other young men are writing and reading at a table on the right\r\nof the picture. A group of elderly men in front of them to the left.\r\nBehind these is a lofty chair and desk, beneath which is a table at which\r\na group of boys are reading and writing. In the background a set of\r\nbook-shelves with a desk, quite modern in style.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The search for the decree of Cyrus._\r\n\r\n    Cyri decretum de templi restauratione Darii iussu\r\n    perquiritur.\r\n\r\nDarius, crowned, his back half turned to the spectator, is giving orders\r\nto several young men, who are taking books out of an _armarium_--evidently\r\ncopied from one of the Vatican book-cupboards.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. BIBLIOTHECA ATHENIENSIS.\r\n\r\n(Two pictures.)\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Pisistratus arranges a library at Athens._\r\n\r\n    Pisistratus primus apud Graecos publicam bibliothecam\r\n    instituit.\r\n\r\nPisistratus, in armour, over which is a blue mantle, is giving orders to\r\nan old man who kneels before him, holding an open book. Behind the old man\r\nattendants are placing books on desks--others are reading. Behind\r\nPisistratus is a group of officers, and behind them again a book-press\r\nwithout doors, and a row of open books on the top.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Restoration of the library by Seleucus._\r\n\r\n    Seleucus bibliothecam a Xerxe asportatam referendam\r\n    curat.\r\n\r\nServants are bringing in books which are being hastily packed into cases.\r\nIn the background is seen the sea, with a ship; and the door of the\r\npalace. A picture full of life and movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. BIBLIOTHECA ALEXANDRINA.\r\n\r\n(Two pictures.)\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Ptolemy organises the library at Alexandria._\r\n\r\n    Ptolemaeus ingenti bibliotheca instructa Hebreorum libros\r\n    concupiscit.\r\n\r\nPtolemy, a dignified figure in a royal habit, stands in the centre. He is\r\naddressing an elderly man who stands on his right. Behind him are three\r\nporches, within which are seen desks and readers. In the central porch are\r\nclosed presses, with rows of folios on the top. Below are desks, at which\r\nreaders are seated, their backs turned to the presses.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Seventy Translators bring their work to Ptolemy._\r\n\r\n    LXXII interpretes ab Eleazaro missi sacros libros\r\n    Ptolemaeo reddunt.\r\n\r\nPtolemy is seated on a throne to right of spectator with courtiers on his\r\nright and left. The messengers kneel before him, and hand him volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. BIBLIOTHECA ROMANORUM.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Tarquin receives the Sibylline Books._\r\n\r\n    Tarquinius Superbus libros Sibyllinos tres aliis a\r\n    muliere incensis tantidem emit.\r\n\r\nTarquin, seated in the centre of the picture, receives three volumes from\r\nan aged and dignified woman. In front a lighted brazier in which the other\r\nbooks are burning.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Augustus opens the Palatine library._\r\n\r\n    Augustus Caes. Palatina Bibliotheca magnifice ornata\r\n    viros litteratos fovet.\r\n\r\nAugustus, in armour, with imperial mantle, crown and sceptre, stands left\r\nof centre. An old man seated at his feet is writing from his dictation.\r\nLeft of the Emperor are five desks; with five closed books lying on the\r\ntop of each. These desks are very probably intended to represent those of\r\nthe Vatican Library as arranged by Sixtus IV. Two men, crowned with\r\nlaurel, are standing behind the last desk, conversing. Behind them again\r\nis a book-case of three shelves between a pair of columns. Books are lying\r\non their sides on these shelves. Beneath the shelves is a desk, with books\r\nopen upon it, and others on their sides beneath it.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. BIBLIOTHECA HIEROSOLIMITANA.\r\n\r\n_Alexander, Bishop and Martyr, collects a library at Jerusalem._\r\n\r\n    S. Alexander Episc. et Mart. Decio Imp. in magna\r\n    temporum acerbitate sacrorum scriptorum libros\r\n    Hierosolymis congregat.\r\n\r\nA picture full of movement, occupying the whole space between two windows.\r\nThe saint is in the centre of the picture, seated. Young men are bringing\r\nin the books, and placing them on shelves.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. BIBLIOTHECA CAESARIENSIS.\r\n\r\n_Pamphilus, Priest and Martyr, collects a library at Caesarea._\r\n\r\n    S. Pamphilus Presb. et Mart. admirandae sanctitatis et\r\n    doctrinae Caesareae sacram bibliothecam conficit multos\r\n    libros sua manu describit.\r\n\r\nPamphilus, in centre of picture, is giving orders to porters who are\r\nbringing in a basket of books. On his left a large table at which a scribe\r\nis writing. S. Jerome, seated in right corner of picture, is apparently\r\ndictating to the scribe. Behind them is a large book-case on the shelves\r\nof which books lie on their sides; others are being laid on the top by a\r\nman standing on a ladder. In the left of the picture is a table covered\r\nwith a green cloth, on which book-binders are at work. In front of this\r\ntable a carpenter is preparing boards. In background, seen through a large\r\nwindow, is a view of Caesarea.\r\n\r\n\r\nX. BIBLIOTHECA APOSTOLORUM.\r\n\r\n_S. Peter orders the safe-keeping of books._\r\n\r\n    S.

Peter carry on the library-tradition._\r\n\r\n    Romani pontifices apostolicam bibliothecam magno studio\r\n    amplificant atque illustrant.\r\n\r\nA pope, his left hand resting on a book, is earnestly conversing with a\r\ncardinal, whose back is half turned to the spectator. Another pope, with\r\nthree aged men, in background.\r\n\r\n[A small picture on west wall.]\r\n\r\nWe will now return to the east end of the room, and take the\r\nrepresentations of Councils, painted on the east and north walls, in\r\nchronological order.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. II. CONCILIUM NICAENUM I.\r\n\r\n(On east wall.)\r\n\r\n_The first Council held at Nicaea_, A.D. 325.\r\n\r\n    S. Silvestro PP. Constantino Mag. imp.

The\r\nmost important of these pictures are above the windows (fig. 16), of which\r\nthere are seven on each side-wall. A Latin couplet above the picture\r\nrecords the subject, and allegorical figures of heroic size, one on each\r\nside, further indicate the idea which it is intended to convey.\r\n\r\nThe series begins at the east end of the room, over the door.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _Procession of Sixtus to his coronation._\r\n\r\n  Hic tria Sixte tuo capiti diademata dantur\r\n  Sed quantum in coelis te diadema manet.\r\n\r\n  ELECTIO SACRA.

USE OF THE APSE. MONASTIC\r\nCOMMUNITIES. S. PACHOMIUS. S. BENEDICT AND HIS SUCCESSORS. EACH HOUSE HAD\r\nA LIBRARY. ANNUAL AUDIT OF BOOKS. LOAN ON SECURITY. MODES OF PROTECTION.\r\nCURSES. PRAYERS FOR DONORS. ENDOWMENT OF LIBRARIES. USE OF THE CLOISTER.\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF CISTERCIAN BOOK-ROOM. COMMON PRESS. CARRELLS. GLASS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evidence collected in the last chapter shews that what I have there\r\ncalled the Roman conception of a library was maintained, even by Christian\r\necclesiastics, during many centuries of our era. I have next to trace the\r\nbeginning and the development of another class of libraries, directly\r\nconnected with Christianity. We shall find that the books intended for the\r\nuse of the new communities were stored in or near the places where they\r\nmet for service, just as in the most ancient times the safe-keeping of\r\nsimilar treasures had been entrusted to temples.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see how this came about. The necessary service-books would\r\nbe placed in the hands of the ecclesiastic who had charge of the building\r\nin which the congregation assembled. To these volumes--which at first were\r\ndoubtless regarded in the same light as vestments or sacred\r\nvessels--treatises intended for edification or instruction would be\r\ngradually added, and so the nucleus of a library would be formed.\r\n\r\nThe existence of such libraries does not rest on inference only. There are\r\nnumerous allusions to them in the Fathers and other writers; S. Jerome,\r\nfor instance, advises a correspondent to consult church-libraries, as\r\nthough every church possessed one[115]. As however the allusions to them\r\nare general, and say nothing about extent or arrangement, this part of my\r\nsubject need not detain us long[116].\r\n\r\nThe earliest collection of which I have discovered any record is that got\r\ntogether at Jerusalem, by Bishop Alexander, who died A.D. 250. Eusebius,\r\nwhen writing his Ecclesiastical History some eighty years later, describes\r\nthis library as a storehouse of historical records, which he had himself\r\nused with advantage in the composition of his work[117]. A still more\r\nimportant collection existed at Caesarea in Palestine. S. Jerome says\r\ndistinctly that it was founded by Pamphilus, \"a man who in zeal for the\r\nacquisition of a library wished to take rank with Demetrius Phalereus and\r\nPisistratus[118].\" As Pamphilus suffered martyrdom in A.D. 309, this\r\nlibrary must have been got together soon after that at Jerusalem. It is\r\ndescribed as not only extensive, but remarkable for the importance of the\r\nmanuscripts it contained. Here was the supposed Hebrew original of S.\r\nMatthew's Gospel[119], and most of the works of Origen, got together by\r\nthe pious care of Pamphilus, who had been his pupil and devoted admirer.\r\nS. Jerome himself worked in this library, and collated there the\r\nmanuscripts which Origen had used when preparing his Hexapla[120]. At\r\nCirta the church and the library were evidently in the same building,\r\nfrom the way in which they are spoken of in the account of the persecution\r\nof A.D. 303-304. \"The officers,\" we are told, \"went into the building\r\n(_domus_) where the Christians were in the habit of meeting.\" There they\r\ntook an inventory of the plate and vestments. \"But,\" proceeds the\r\nnarrative, \"when they came to the library, the presses there were found\r\nempty[121].\" Augustine, on his deathbed, A.D. 430, gave directions that\r\n\"the library of the church [at Hippo], and all the manuscripts, should be\r\ncarefully preserved by those who came after him[122].\"\r\n\r\nFurther, there appears to be good reason for believing that when a church\r\nhad a triple apse, the lateral apses were separated off by a curtain or a\r\ndoor, the one to contain the sacred vessels, the other the books. This\r\nview, which has been elaborated by De Rossi in explanation of three\r\nrecesses in the thickness of the wall of the apse of a small private\r\noratory discovered in Rome in 1876[123], is chiefly supported by the\r\nlanguage of Paulinus, Bishop of Nola, who lived from about A.D. 353 to\r\nA.D. 431. He describes a basilica erected by himself at Nola in honour of\r\nS. Felix, martyr, as having \"an apse divided into three (_apsidem\r\ntrichoram_)[124]\"; and in a subsequent passage, after stating that there\r\nare to be two recesses, one to the right, the other to the left of the\r\napse, he adds, \"these verses indicate the use of each[125],\" and gives the\r\nfollowing couplets, with their headings:\r\n\r\n_On the right of the Apse._\r\n\r\n  Hic locus est veneranda penus qua conditur, et qua\r\n  Ponitur alma sacri pompa ministerii.\r\n\r\n  Here are the sacred vessels stored, and here\r\n  The peaceful trappings of our holy rites.\r\n\r\n_On the left of the same._\r\n\r\n  Si quem sancta tenet meditandi in lege voluntas\r\n  Hic poterit residens sacris intendere libris.\r\n\r\n  Here he whose thoughts are on the laws of God\r\n  May sit and ponder over holy books.\r\n\r\nAs De Rossi explains, the first of the two niches was intended to contain\r\nthe vessels and furniture of the altar; the second was reserved for the\r\nsafe-keeping of the sacred books. The word _trichora_, in Greek [Greek:\r\ntricho], is used by later writers to designate a three-fold division of\r\nany object--as for instance, by Dioscorides, of the seed-pod of the\r\nacacia[126].\r\n\r\nWhether this theory of the use of the apse be accurate or fanciful, the\r\npurely Christian libraries to which I have alluded were undoubtedly\r\nconnected, more or less closely, with churches; and I submit that the\r\nlibraries which in the Middle Ages were connected with cathedrals and\r\ncollegiate churches are their lineal descendants.\r\n\r\nI have next to consider the libraries formed by monastic communities, the\r\norigin of which may be traced to very early times. Among the Christians of\r\nthe first three centuries there were enthusiasts who, discontented with\r\nthe luxurious life they led in the populous cities along the coasts of\r\nAfrica and Syria, fled into the Egyptian deserts, there to lead a life of\r\nrigorous self-denial and religious contemplation. These hermits were\r\npresently joined by other hermits, and small communities were gradually\r\nformed, with a regular organization that foreshadowed the Rules and\r\nCustoms of the later monastic life. Those who governed these primitive\r\nmonasteries soon realised the fact that without books their inmates would\r\nrelapse into barbarism, and libraries were got together. The Rule of S.\r\nPachomius (A.D. 292-345), whose monastery was at Tabennisi near Denderah\r\nin Upper Egypt, provides that the books of the House are to be kept in a\r\ncupboard (_fenestra_) in the thickness of the wall. Any brother who wanted\r\na book might have one for a week, at the end of which he was bound to\r\nreturn it. No brother might leave a book open when he went to church or\r\nto meals. In the evening the officer called \"the Second,\" that is, the\r\nsecond in command, was to take charge of the books, count them, and lock\r\nthem up.[127]\r\n\r\nThese provisions, insisted upon at a very early date, form a suitable\r\nintroduction to the most important section of my subject--the care of\r\nbooks by the Monastic Orders. With them book-preserving and book-producing\r\nwere reduced to a system, and in their libraries--the public libraries of\r\nthe Middle Ages--literature found a home, until the invention of printing\r\nhanded over to the world at large the duties which had been so well\r\ndischarged by special communities. This investigation is full of\r\ndifficulty; and, though I hope to arrive at some definite conclusions\r\nrespecting the position, size, dimensions, and fittings of monastic\r\nlibraries, I must admit that my results depend to a certain extent on\r\nanalogy and inference. It should be remembered that in England the\r\nmonasteries were swept away more than three centuries ago by a sudden\r\ncatastrophe, and that those who destroyed them were far too busy with\r\ntheir own affairs to place on record the aspect or the plan of what they\r\nwere wrecking. In France again, though little more than a century has\r\nelapsed since her monasteries were overwhelmed by the Revolution, and\r\nthough descriptions and views of many of her great religious houses have\r\nbeen preserved, and much has been done in the way of editing catalogues of\r\ntheir manuscripts, there is still a lamentable dearth of information on my\r\nparticular subject.\r\n\r\nI shall begin by quoting some passages from the Rules and Customs of the\r\ndifferent Orders, which shew (1) that reading was encouraged and enforced\r\nby S. Benedict himself, with whom the monastic life, as we conceive it,\r\nmay be said to have originated; (2) that subsequently, as Order after\r\nOrder was founded, a steady development of feeling with regard to books,\r\nand an ever-increasing care for their safe-keeping, can be traced.\r\n\r\nThe Rule of S. Benedict was made public early in the sixth century; and\r\nthe later Orders were but offshoots of the Benedictine tree, either using\r\nhis Rule or basing their own statutes upon it. It will therefore be\r\ndesirable to begin this research by examining what S. Benedict said on the\r\nsubject of study, and I will translate a few lines from the 48th chapter\r\nof his Rule, _Of daily manual labour_.\r\n\r\n    Idleness is the enemy of the soul; hence brethren ought,\r\n    at certain seasons, to occupy themselves with manual\r\n    labour, and again, at certain hours, with holy\r\n    reading....\r\n\r\n    Between Easter and the calends of October let them apply\r\n    themselves to reading from the fourth hour till near the\r\n    sixth hour.\r\n\r\n    From the calends of October to the beginning of Lent let\r\n    them apply themselves to reading until the second\r\n    hour.... During Lent, let them apply themselves to\r\n    reading from morning until the end of the third hour ...\r\n    and, in these days of Lent, let them receive a book\r\n    apiece from the library, and read it straight through.\r\n    These books are to be given out at the beginning of\r\n    Lent[128].\r\n\r\nIn this passage the _library_--by which a book-press is probably to be\r\nunderstood--is specially mentioned. In other words, at that early date the\r\nformation of a collection of books was contemplated, large enough to\r\nsupply the community with a volume apiece, without counting the\r\nservice-books required for use in the church.\r\n\r\nThe Benedictine Order flourished and increased abundantly for more than\r\nfour centuries, until, about A.D. 912, the order of Cluni was established.\r\nIt was so called from the celebrated abbey near Macon in Burgundy, which,\r\nthough not the first house of the Order in point of date, became\r\nsubsequently the first in extent, wealth, and reputation. As a stricter\r\nobservance of the Rule of S. Benedict was the main object which the\r\nfounder of this Order had in view, the Benedictine directions respecting\r\nstudy are maintained and developed. The Customs prescribe the following\r\nregulations for books:\r\n\r\n    On the second day of Lent the only passage of the Rule\r\n    to be read in Chapter is that concerning the observance\r\n    of Lent.\r\n\r\n    Then shall be read aloud a note (_brevis_) of the books\r\n    which a year before had been given out to brethren for\r\n    their reading. When a brother's name is called, he\r\n    rises, and returns the book that had been given to him;\r\n    and if it should happen that he has not read it through,\r\n    he is to ask forgiveness for his want of diligence.\r\n\r\n    A carpet on which those books are to be laid out is to\r\n    be put down in the Chapter-House; and the titles of\r\n    those which are distributed to brethren afresh are to be\r\n    noted, for which purpose a tablet is to be made of\r\n    somewhat larger size than usual[129].\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent chapter it is directed that the books are to be entrusted\r\nto the official \"who is called Precentor and _Armarius_, because he\r\nusually has charge of the library, which is also called the _armarium_\r\n(press)[130]. This arrangement shews that up to this date all the books,\r\nwhether service-books or not, were regarded as belonging to the church.\r\n\r\nI come next to the decrees given to the English Benedictines by Archbishop\r\nLanfranc in or about 1070. \"We send you\" he says \"the Customs of our Order\r\nin writing, selected from the Customs of those houses (_coenobia_) which\r\nare in our day of the highest authority in the monastic order[131].\" The\r\nsection relating to books is so interesting that I will translate it.\r\n\r\n    On the Monday after the first Sunday in Lent ... before\r\n    the brethren go in to Chapter, the librarian (_custos\r\n    librorum_) ought to have all the books brought together\r\n    into the Chapter-House and laid out on a carpet, except\r\n    those which had been given out for reading during the\r\n    past year: these the brethren ought to bring with them\r\n    as they come into Chapter, each carrying his book in his\r\n    hand. Of this they ought to have had notice given to\r\n    them by the aforesaid librarian on the preceding day in\r\n    Chapter. Then let the passage in the Rule of S. Benedict\r\n    about the observance of Lent be read, and a discourse be\r\n    preached upon it. Next let the librarian read a document\r\n    (_breve_) setting forth the names of the brethren who\r\n    have had books during the past year; and let each\r\n    brother, when he hears his own name pronounced, return\r\n    the book which had been entrusted to him for reading;\r\n    and let him who is conscious of not having read the book\r\n    through which he had received, fall down on his face,\r\n    confess his fault, and pray for forgiveness.\r\n\r\n    Then let the aforesaid librarian hand to each brother\r\n    another book for reading; and when the books have been\r\n    distributed in order, let the aforesaid librarian in the\r\n    same Chapter put on record the names of the books, and\r\n    of those who receive them[132].\r\n\r\nIt is, I think, certain that when Lanfranc was writing this passage the\r\nCluniac Customs must have been before him[133]. It should be noted that\r\nthe librarian is not defined otherwise than as \"keeper of the books,\" but\r\nwe learn from the Customs of Benedictine houses subsequent to Lanfranc's\r\ntime that this duty was discharged by the Precentor, as in the Cluniac\r\nCustoms. For instance, in the Customs of the Benedictine house at\r\nAbingdon, in Berkshire, drawn up near the end of the twelfth century, we\r\nread:\r\n\r\n    The precentor shall keep clean the presses belonging to\r\n    the boys and the novices, and all others in which the\r\n    books of the convent are stored, repair them when they\r\n    are broken, provide coverings for the books in the\r\n    library, and make good any damage done to them[134].\r\n\r\n    The precentor cannot sell, or give away, or pledge any\r\n    books; nor can he lend any except on deposit of a\r\n    pledge, of equal or greater value than the book itself.\r\n    It is safer to fall back on a pledge, than to proceed\r\n    against an individual. Moreover he may not lend except\r\n    to neighbouring churches, or to persons of conspicuous\r\n    worth[135].\r\n\r\nThe Customs of the Abbey of Evesham in Worcestershire give the same\r\ndirections in a slightly different form.\r\n\r\n    It is part of the precentor's duty to entrust to the\r\n    younger monks the care of the presses, and to keep them\r\n    in repair: whenever the convent is sitting in cloister,\r\n    he is to go round the cloister as soon as the bell has\r\n    sounded, and replace the books, in case any brother\r\n    through carelessness should have forgotten to do so.\r\n\r\n    He is to take charge of all the books in the monastery,\r\n    and have them in his keeping, provided his carefulness\r\n    and knowledge be such that they may be entrusted to him.\r\n    No one is to take a book out unless it be entered on his\r\n    roll: nor is any book to be lent to any one without a\r\n    proper and sufficient voucher, and this too is to be set\r\n    down on his roll[136].\r\n\r\nThe Carthusians--the second offshoot of the Benedictine tree (1084)--also\r\npreserved the primitive tradition of study. They not only read themselves,\r\nbut were actively employed in writing books for others. In the chapter of\r\ntheir statutes which deals with the furniture allowed to each \"tenant of a\r\ncell (_incola celle_)\"--(for in this community each brother lived apart,\r\nwith his sitting-room, bed-room, and plot of garden-ground)--all the\r\narticles needful for writing are enumerated, \"for nearly all those whom we\r\nadopt we teach, if possible, to write,\" and then the writer passes on to\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\n    Moreover he--[the tenant of the cell]--receives two\r\n    books out of the press for reading. He is admonished to\r\n    take the utmost care and pains that they be not soiled\r\n    by smoke or dust or dirt of any kind; for it is our wish\r\n    that books, as being the perpetual food of our souls,\r\n    should be most jealously guarded, and most carefully\r\n    produced, that we, who cannot preach the word of God\r\n    with our lips, may preach it with our hands[137].\r\n\r\nThey did, however, on occasion lend books, for it is provided that when\r\nbooks are lent no one shall retain them contrary to the will of the\r\nlenders[138]. It would be interesting to know how this rule was enforced.\r\n\r\nThe Cistercian Order--founded 1128--adopted the Benedictine Rule, and with\r\nit the obligation of study and writing. Moreover, in their anxiety to take\r\ndue care of their books, they went further than their predecessors; for\r\nthey entrusted them to a special officer, instead of to the precentor, and\r\nthey admitted a special room to contain them into the ground-plan of their\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nAt a later point I shall return to the interesting subject of the\r\nCistercian book-room. For the present I must content myself with\r\ntranslating from their Customs the passage relating to books. It occurs in\r\nChapter CXV., _Of the precentor and his assistant_. After describing his\r\nvarious duties, the writer proceeds:\r\n\r\n    With regard to the production and safe-keeping of\r\n    charters and books, the abbat is to consider to whom he\r\n    shall entrust this duty.\r\n\r\n    The officer so appointed may go as far as the doors of\r\n    the writing-rooms when he wants to hand in or to take\r\n    out a book, but he may not go inside. In the same way\r\n    for books in common use, as for instance antiphoners,\r\n    hymnals, graduals, lectionaries [etc.], and those which\r\n    are read in the Prater and at Collation, he may go as\r\n    far as the door of the novices, and of the sick, and of\r\n    the writers, and then ask for what he wants by a sign,\r\n    but he may not go further unless he have been commanded\r\n    by the abbat. When Collation is over it is his duty to\r\n    close the press, and during the period of labour, of\r\n    sleep, and of meals, and while vespers are being sung,\r\n    to keep it locked[139].\r\n\r\nThe Customs of the Augustinian Order are exceedingly full on the subject\r\nof books. I will translate part of the 14th chapter of the Customs in use\r\nat Barnwell[140], near Cambridge. It is headed: _Of the safe keeping of\r\nthe books, and of the office of Librarian (armarius)._ As the passage\r\noccurs also in the Customs as observed in France and in Belgium, it may be\r\ntaken, I presume, to represent the general practice of the Order.\r\n\r\n    The Librarian, who is called also Precentor, is to take\r\n    charge of the books of the church; all which he ought to\r\n    keep and to know under their separate titles; and he\r\n    should frequently examine them carefully to prevent any\r\n    damage or injury from insects or decay. He ought also,\r\n    at the beginning of Lent, in each year, to shew them to\r\n    the convent in Chapter, when the souls of those who have\r\n    given them to the church, or of the brethren who have\r\n    written them, and laboured over them, ought to be\r\n    absolved, and a service in convent be held over them. He\r\n    ought also to hand to the brethren the books which they\r\n    see occasion to use, and to enter on his roll the titles\r\n    of the books, and the names of those who receive them.\r\n    These, when required, are bound to give surety for the\r\n    volumes they receive; nor may they lend them to others,\r\n    whether known or unknown, without having first obtained\r\n    permission from the Librarian. Nor ought the Librarian\r\n    himself to lend books unless he receive a pledge of\r\n    equal value; and then he ought to enter on his roll the\r\n    name of the borrower, the title of the book lent, and\r\n    the pledge taken. The larger and more valuable books he\r\n    ought not to lend to anyone, known or unknown, without\r\n    permission of the Prelate....\r\n\r\n    Books which are to be kept at hand for daily use,\r\n    whether for singing or reading, ought to be in some\r\n    common place, to which all the brethren can have easy\r\n    access for inspection, and selection of anything which\r\n    seems to them suitable. The books, therefore, ought not\r\n    to be carried away into chambers, or into corners\r\n    outside the Cloister or the Church. The Librarian ought\r\n    frequently to dust the books carefully, to repair them,\r\n    and to point them, lest brethren should find any error\r\n    or hindrance in the daily service of the church, whether\r\n    in singing or in reading. No other brother ought to\r\n    erase or change anything in the books unless he have\r\n    obtained the consent of the Librarian....\r\n\r\n    The press in which the books are kept ought to be lined\r\n    inside with wood, that the damp of the walls may not\r\n    moisten or stain the books. This press should be divided\r\n    vertically as well as horizontally by sundry shelves on\r\n    which the books may be ranged so as to be separated from\r\n    one another; for fear they be packed so close as to\r\n    injure each other or delay those who want them[141].\r\n\r\n    Further, as the books ought to be mended, pointed, and\r\n    taken care of by the Librarian, so ought they to be\r\n    properly bound by him.\r\n\r\nThe Order of Premontre--better known as the Premonstratensians, or\r\nreformed Augustinians--repeat the essential part of these directions in\r\ntheir statute, _Of the Librarian (armarius)_, with this addition, that it\r\nis to be part of the librarian's duty to provide for the borrowing of\r\nbooks for the use of the House, as well as for lending[142].\r\n\r\nLastly, the Friars, though property was forbidden, and S. Francis would\r\nnot allow his disciples to own so much as a psalter or a breviary[143],\r\nsoon found that books were a necessity, and the severity of early\r\ndiscipline was relaxed in favour of a library. S. Francis died in 1226,\r\nand only thirty-four years afterwards, among the constitutions adopted by\r\na General Chapter of the Order held at Narbonne 10 June, 1260, are several\r\nprovisions relating to books. They are of no great importance, taken by\r\nthemselves, but their appearance at so early a date proves that books had\r\nbecome indispensable. It is enacted that no brother may write books, or\r\nhave them written, for sale; nor may the chief officer of a province\r\nventure to keep books without leave obtained from the chief officer of the\r\nwhole Order; no brother may keep the books assigned to him, unless they\r\nare altogether the property of the Order--and so forth[144]. A century\r\nlater, when Richard de Bury, Bishop of Durham, was writing his\r\n_Philobiblon_ (completed 24 January, 1344-45), he could say of them and\r\nthe other friars--whom, be it remembered, he, as a regular, would regard\r\nwith scant favour--\r\n\r\n    But whenever it happened that we turned aside to the\r\n    cities and places where the Mendicants had their\r\n    convents we did not disdain to visit their libraries and\r\n    any other repositories of books; nay there we found\r\n    heaped up amidst the utmost poverty the utmost riches of\r\n    wisdom. We discovered in their fardels and baskets not\r\n    only crumbs falling from the master's table for the\r\n    dogs, but the shewbread without leaven and the bread of\r\n    angels having in it all that is delicious; and indeed\r\n    the garners of Joseph full of corn, and all the spoil of\r\n    the Egyptians and the very precious gifts which Queen\r\n    Sheba brought to Solomon.\r\n\r\n    These men are as ants ever preparing their meat in the\r\n    summer, and ingenious bees continually fabricating cells\r\n    of honey.... And to pay due regard to truth ... although\r\n    they lately at the eleventh hour have entered the Lord's\r\n    vineyard ..., they have added more in this brief hour to\r\n    the stock of the sacred books than all the other\r\n    vinedressers; following in the footsteps of Paul, the\r\n    last to be called but the first in preaching, who spread\r\n    the gospel of Christ more widely than all others[145].\r\n\r\nAt Assisi, the parent house of the Franciscan Order, there was a library\r\nof considerable extent, many volumes of which still exist, with a\r\ncatalogue drawn up in 1381.\r\n\r\nAt this point I will resume the conclusions which may be deduced from this\r\nexamination of the Benedictine Rule and the Customs founded upon it.\r\n\r\nIn the first place they all assume the existence of a library. S. Benedict\r\ncontents himself with general directions about study. The Cluniacs put the\r\nbooks in charge of the precentor, who is to be called also _armarius_, and\r\nthey prescribe an annual audit of them, with the assignment of a single\r\nvolume to each brother, on the security of a written attestation of the\r\nfact. These regulations were adopted by the Benedictines, with fuller\r\nrules for the librarian, who is still precentor also. He is to keep both\r\npresses and books in repair, and personally to supervise the daily use of\r\nthe manuscripts, restoring to their proper places those that brethren may\r\nhave been reading. Among these rules permission to lend books on receipt\r\nof a pledge first makes its appearance. The Carthusians maintain the\r\nprinciple of lending. Each brother might have two books, and he is to be\r\nspecially careful to keep them clean. The Cistercians appoint a special\r\nofficer to have charge of the books, about the safety of which great care\r\nis to be taken, and at certain times of the day he is to lock the press.\r\nThe Augustinians and the Premonstratensians follow the Cluniacs and\r\nBenedictines: but the Premonstratensians direct their librarian to take\r\nnote of the books that the House borrows as well as of those that it\r\nlends; and they adopt the Cistercian precaution about his opening and\r\nlocking the press.\r\n\r\nSecondly, by the time that Lanfranc was writing his statutes for English\r\nBenedictines, it was evidently contemplated that the number of books would\r\nhave exceeded the number of brethren, for the keeper of the books is\r\ndirected to bring all the books of the House into Chapter, and after that\r\nthe brethren, one by one, are to bring in the books which they have\r\nborrowed[146]. Among the books belonging to the House there were probably\r\nsome service-books; but, from the language used, it appears to me that we\r\nmay fairly conclude that by the end of the eleventh century Benedictine\r\nHouses had two sets of books: (1) those which were distributed among the\r\nbrethren; (2) those which were kept in some safe place, as part of the\r\npossessions of the House: or, to adopt modern phrases, that they had a\r\nlending library and a library of reference.\r\n\r\nThirdly, it is evident that the loan of books to persons in general, on\r\nadequate security, began at a very early date. On this account I have\r\nalready ventured to call monastic libraries the public libraries of the\r\nMiddle Ages. As time went on, the practice was developed, and at last\r\nbecame general. It was even enjoined upon monks as a duty by their\r\necclesiastical superiors. In 1212 a Council which met at Paris made the\r\nfollowing decree, but I am not able to say whether it was accepted out of\r\nFrance:\r\n\r\n    We forbid those who belong to a religious Order, to\r\n    formulate any vow against lending their books to those\r\n    who are in need of them; seeing that to lend is\r\n    enumerated among the principal works of mercy.\r\n\r\n    After careful consideration, let some books be kept in\r\n    the House for the use of brethren; others, according to\r\n    the decision of the abbat, be lent to those who are in\r\n    need of them, the rights of the House being\r\n    safe-guarded.\r\n\r\n    From the present date no book is to be retained under\r\n    pain of incurring a curse [for its alienation], and we\r\n    declare all such curses to be of no effect[147].\r\n\r\nIn the same century many volumes were bequeathed to the Augustinian House\r\nof S. Victor, Paris, on the express condition that they should be so\r\nlent[148]. It is almost needless to add that one abbey was continually\r\nlending to another, either for reading or for copying[149].\r\n\r\nHouses which lent liberally would probably be the first to relax\r\ndiscipline so far as to admit strangers to their libraries; and in the\r\nsixteenth and following centuries the libraries of the Benedictine House\r\nof S. Germain des Pres, Paris, as well as the already mentioned House of\r\nS. Victor, were open to all comers on certain days in the week.\r\n\r\nWhen we try to realise the feelings with which monastic communities\r\nregarded books, it must always be remembered that they had a paternal\r\ninterest in them. In many cases they had been written in the very House in\r\nwhich they were afterwards read from generation to generation: and if not,\r\nthey had probably been procured by the exchange of some work so written.\r\nIn fact, if a book was not a son of the House, it was at least a nephew.\r\n\r\nThe conviction that books were a possession with which no convent could\r\ndispense, appears in many medieval writers. The whole matter is summed up\r\nin the phrase, written about 1170, \"claustrum sine armario, castrum sine\r\narmamentario[150],\" an epigram which I will not spoil by trying to\r\ntranslate it; and even more clearly in the passionate utterances of Thomas\r\na Kempis on the desolate condition of priest and convent without\r\nbooks[151]. The \"round of creation\" is explored for similes to enforce\r\nthis truth. A priest so situated is like a horse without bridle, a ship\r\nwithout oars, a writer without pens, a bird without wings, etc.; while the\r\nHouse is like a kitchen without stewpans, a table without food, a well\r\nwithout water, a river without fish--and many other things which I have no\r\nspace to mention.\r\n\r\nEvidence of the solicitude with which they protected their treasures is\r\nnot wanting. The very mode of holding a manuscript was prescribed, if not\r\nby law, at least by general custom. \"When the religious are engaged in\r\nreading in cloister or in church,\" says an Order of the General\r\nBenedictine Chapter, \"they shall if possible hold the books in their left\r\nhands, wrapped in the sleeve of their tunics, and resting on their knees;\r\ntheir right hands shall be uncovered with which to hold and turn the\r\nleaves of the aforesaid books[152].\" In a manuscript at Monte Cassino[153]\r\nis the practical injunction\r\n\r\n  Quisquis quem tetigerit\r\n  Sit illi lota manus;\r\n\r\nand at the same House the possession of handkerchiefs--which were\r\nevidently regarded as effeminate inventions--is specially excused on the\r\nground that they would be useful--among other things--\"for wrapping round\r\nthe manuscripts which brethren handle[154].\" Of similar import is the\r\ndistich at the end of a fine manuscript formerly in the library of S.\r\nVictor:\r\n\r\n  Qui servare libris preciosis nescit honorem\r\n  Illius a manibus sit procul iste liber[155].\r\n\r\nWith these injunctions may be compared a note in a fourteenth century\r\nmanuscript from the same library:\r\n\r\n    Whoever pursues his studies in this book, should be\r\n    careful to handle the leaves gently and delicately, so\r\n    as to avoid tearing them by reason of their thinness;\r\n    and let him imitate the example of Jesus Christ, who,\r\n    when he had quietly opened the book of Isaiah and read\r\n    therein attentively, rolled it up with reverence, and\r\n    gave it again to the minister[156];\r\n\r\nand the advice of Thomas a Kempis to the youthful students for whose\r\nbenefit he composed the treatise called _Doctrinale Juvenum_ which I have\r\nalready quoted:\r\n\r\n    Take thou a book into thine hands as Simeon the Just\r\n    took the Child Jesus into his arms to carry him and kiss\r\n    him. And when thou hast finished reading, close the book\r\n    and give thanks for every word out of the mouth of God;\r\n    because in the Lord's field thou hast found a hidden\r\n    treasure[157].\r\n\r\nIn a similar strain a writer or copyist entreats readers to be careful of\r\nhis work--work which has cost him an amount of pains that they cannot\r\nrealise. It is impossible to translate the original exactly, but I hope\r\nthat I have given the meaning with tolerable clearness:\r\n\r\n    I beseech you, my friend, when you are reading my book\r\n    to keep your hands behind its back, for fear you should\r\n    do mischief to the text by some sudden movement; for a\r\n    man who knows nothing about writing thinks that it is no\r\n    concern of his. Whereas to a writer the last line is as\r\n    sweet as port is to a sailor. Three fingers hold the\r\n    pen, but the whole body toils. Thanks be to God. I\r\n    Warembert wrote this book in God's name. Thanks be to\r\n    God. Amen[158].\r\n\r\nEntreaties so gentle and so pathetic as these are seldom met with; but\r\ncurses--in the same strain probably as those to which the Council of Paris\r\ntook exception--are extremely common. In fact, in some Houses, a\r\nmanuscript invariably ended with an imprecation--more or less severe,\r\naccording to the writer's taste[159]. I will append a few specimens.\r\n\r\n    This book belongs to S. Maximin at his monastery of\r\n    Micy, which abbat Peter caused to be written, and with\r\n    his own labour corrected and punctuated, and on Holy\r\n    Thursday dedicated to God and S. Maximin on the altar of\r\n    S. Stephen, with this imprecation that he who should\r\n    take it away from thence by what device soever, with\r\n    the intention of not restoring it, should incur\r\n    damnation with the traitor Judas, with Annas, Caiaphas,\r\n    and Pilate. Amen[160].\r\n\r\n    Should anyone by craft or any device whatever abstract\r\n    this book from this place [Jumieges] may his soul\r\n    suffer, in retribution for what he has done, and may his\r\n    name be erased from the book of the living and not be\r\n    recorded among the Blessed[161].\r\n\r\nA simpler form of imprecation occurs very frequently in manuscripts\r\nbelonging to S. Alban's:\r\n\r\n    This book belongs to S. Alban. May whosoever steals it\r\n    from him or destroys its title be anathema. Amen[162].\r\n\r\nA similar form of words occurs at the Cistercian House of Clairvaux, a\r\ngreat school of writing like S. Alban's, but whether it habitually\r\nprotected its manuscripts in this manner I am unable to say:\r\n\r\n    May whoever steals or alienates this manuscript, or\r\n    scratches out its title, be anathema. Amen[163].\r\n\r\nA very curious form of curse occurs in one of the manuscripts of Christ\r\nChurch, Canterbury. The writer repents of his severity in the last\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n    May whoever destroys this title, or by gift or sale or\r\n    loan or exchange or theft or by any other device\r\n    knowingly alienates this book from the aforesaid Christ\r\n    Church, incur in this life the malediction of Jesus\r\n    Christ and of the most glorious Virgin His Mother, and\r\n    of Blessed Thomas, Martyr. Should however it please\r\n    Christ, who is patron of Christ Church, may his soul be\r\n    saved in the Day of Judgment[164].\r\n\r\nLastly, I will quote a specimen in verse, from a breviary now in the\r\nlibrary of Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge:\r\n\r\n  Wher so ever y be come over all\r\n  I belonge to the Chapell of gunvylle hall:\r\n  He shal be cursed by the grate sentens\r\n  That felonsly faryth and berith me thens.\r\n  And whether he bere me in pooke or sekke,\r\n  For me he shall be hanged by the nekke,\r\n  (I am so well beknown of dyverse men)\r\n  But I be restored theder agen[165].\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the gift of books to a monastery was gratefully\r\nrecorded and enumerated among the good deeds of their donors. Among the\r\nAugustinians such gifts, and the labour expended upon books in general,\r\nwas the subject of a special service[166].\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon to find a monastic library regularly endowed with part\r\nof the annual revenue of the House. For instance, at Corbie, the librarian\r\nreceived 10 sous from each of the higher, and 5 sous from each of the\r\ninferior officers, together with a certain number of bushels of corn from\r\nlands specially set apart for the purpose. This was confirmed by a bull of\r\nPope Alexander III. (1166-1179)[167]. A similar arrangement was made at\r\nthe library of S. Martin des Champs, Paris, in 1261[168]. At the\r\nBenedictine Abbey of Fleury, near Orleans, in 1146, it was agreed in\r\nchapter on the proposition of the abbat, that in each year on S.\r\nBenedict's winter festival (21 March), he and the priors subordinate to\r\nhim, together with the officers of the House, should all contribute \"to\r\nthe repair of our books, the preparation of new ones, and the purchase of\r\nparchment.\" The name of each contributor, and the sum that he was to give,\r\nare recorded[169]. At the Benedictine Monastery of Ely Bishop Nigel\r\n(1133-1174) granted the tithe of certain churches in the diocese \"as a\r\nperpetual alms to the _scriptorium_ of the church of Ely for the purpose\r\nof making and repairing the books of the said church[170].\" The books\r\nreferred to were probably, in the first instance, service-books; but the\r\nnumber required of these could hardly have been sufficient to occupy the\r\nwhole time of the scribes, and the library would doubtless derive benefit\r\nfrom their labours. The _scriptorium_ at S. Alban's was also specially\r\nendowed.\r\n\r\nWe must next consider the answer to the following questions: In what part\r\nof their Houses did the Monastic Orders bestow their books? and what\r\npieces of furniture did they use? The answer to the first of these\r\nquestions is a very curious one, when we consider what our climate is, and\r\nindeed what the climate of the whole of Europe is, during the winter\r\nmonths. The centre of the monastic life was the cloister. Brethren were\r\nnot allowed to congregate in any other part of the conventual buildings,\r\nexcept when they went into the frater, or dining-hall, for their meals, or\r\nat certain hours in certain seasons into the warming-house\r\n(_calefactorium_). In the cloister accordingly they kept their books; and\r\nthere they wrote and studied, or conducted the schooling of the novices\r\nand choir-boys, in winter and in summer alike.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that their work must have been at the mercy of the elements\r\nduring many months of the year, and some important proofs that such was\r\nthe case can be quoted. Cuthbert, Abbat of Wearmouth and Jarrow in the\r\nsecond half of the eighth century, excuses himself to a correspondent for\r\nnot having sent him all the works of Bede which he had asked for, on the\r\nground that the intense cold of the previous winter had paralysed the\r\nhands of his scribes[171]; Ordericus Vitalis, who wrote in the first half\r\nof the twelfth century, closes the fourth book of his Ecclesiastical\r\nHistory with a lament that he must lay aside his work for the winter[172];\r\nand a monk of Ramsey Abbey in Huntingdonshire has recorded his\r\ndiscomforts in a Latin couplet which seems to imply that in a place so\r\ninconvenient as a cloister all seasons were equally destructive of serious\r\nwork:\r\n\r\n  In vento minime pluvia nive sole sedere\r\n  Possumus in claustro nec scribere neque studere[173].\r\n\r\n  As we sit here in tempest in rain snow and sun\r\n  Nor writing nor reading in cloister is done.\r\n\r\nBut, when circumstances were more propitious, plenty of good work that was\r\nof permanent value could be done in a cloister. A charming picture has\r\ncome down to us of the literary activity that prevailed in the Abbey of S.\r\nMartin at Tournai at the end of the eleventh century, when Abbat Odo was\r\ngiving an impulse to the writing of MSS. \"When you entered the cloister,\"\r\nsays his chronicler, \"you could generally see a dozen young monks seated\r\non chairs, and silently writing at desks of careful and artistic design.\r\nWith their help, he got accurate copies made of all Jerome's commentaries\r\non the Prophets, of the works of Blessed Gregory, and of all the treatises\r\nhe could find of Augustine, Ambrose, Isidore, and Anselm; so that the like\r\nof his library was not to be found in any of the neighbouring churches;\r\nand those attached to them used generally to ask for our copies for the\r\ncorrection of their own[174].\"\r\n\r\nThe second question cannot be answered so readily. We must begin by\r\nexamining, in some detail, the expressions used to denote furniture in the\r\nvarious documents that deal with conventual libraries.\r\n\r\nS. Pachomius places his books in a cupboard (_fenestra_); S. Benedict uses\r\nonly the general term, library (_bibliotheca_), which may mean either a\r\nroom or a piece of furniture; and the word press (_armarium_), with which\r\nwe become so familiar afterwards, does not make its appearance till near\r\nthe end of the eleventh century. Lanfranc does not use it, but as I have\r\nshewn that he based his statutes, at least to some extent, on the Cluniac\r\nCustoms, and as they identify the library (_bibliotheca_) with the press\r\n(_armarium_), and call the librarian, termed by Lanfranc the keeper of the\r\nbooks, the keeper of the press (_armarius_), we may safely assume that the\r\nbooks to which Lanfranc refers were housed in a similar piece of\r\nfurniture. Moreover, in Benedictine houses of later date, as for instance\r\nat Abingdon and Evesham, the word is constantly employed.\r\n\r\nI pointed out in the first chapter that the word press (_armarium_) was\r\nused by the Romans to signify both a detached piece of furniture and a\r\nrecess in a wall into which such a contrivance might be inserted[175]. The\r\nsame use obtained in medieval times[176], and the passage quoted above\r\nfrom the Augustinian customs[177] shews that the book-press there\r\ncontemplated was a recess lined with wood and subdivided so as to keep the\r\nbooks separate.\r\n\r\nThe books to be accommodated in a monastery, even of large size, could not\r\nat its origin have been numerous[178], and would easily have been\r\ncontained in a single receptacle. This, I conceive, was that recess in the\r\nwall which is so frequently found between the Chapter-House and the door\r\ninto the church at the end of the east pane of the cloister. In many\r\nmonastic ruins this recess is still open, and, by a slight effort of\r\nimagination, can be restored to its pristine use. Elsewhere it is filled\r\nin, having been abandoned by the monks themselves in favour of a fresh\r\ncontrivance. The recess I am speaking of was called the common press\r\n(_armarium commune_), or common cloister-press (_commune armarium\r\nclaustri_); and it contained the books appointed for the general use of\r\nthe community (_communes libri_).\r\n\r\nA press of this description (fig. 19) is still to be seen in excellent\r\npreservation at the Cistercian monastery of Fossa Nuova in Central Italy,\r\nnear Terracina, which I visited in the spring of 1900. This house may be\r\ndated 1187-1208[179]. The press is in the west wall of the south transept\r\n(fig. 21), close to the door leading to the church. It measures 4 ft. 3\r\nin. wide, by 3 ft. 6 in. high; and is raised 2 ft. 3 in. above the floor\r\nof the cloister. It is lined with slabs of stone; but the hinges are not\r\nstrong enough to have carried doors of any material heavier than wood; and\r\nI conjecture that the shelf also was of the same material. Stone is\r\nplentiful in that part of Italy, but wood, especially in large pieces,\r\nwould have to be brought from a distance. Hence its removal, as soon as\r\nthe cupboard was not required for the purpose for which it was\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19. Press in the cloister at the Cistercian Abbey of\r\nFossa Nuova.]\r\n\r\nTwo recesses, evidently intended for the same purpose, are to be seen in\r\nthe east walk of the cloister of Worcester Cathedral, formerly a\r\nBenedictine monastery. They are between the Chapter-House and the passage\r\nleading to the treasury and other rooms. Each recess is square-headed, 6\r\nft. 9 in. high, 2 ft. 6 in. deep, and 11 ft. broad (fig. 20). In front of\r\nthe recesses is a bench-table, 13 in. broad and 16 in. high. This\r\nbook-press was in use so late as 1518, when a book bought by the Prior was\r\n\"delyvered to y^e cloyster awmery[180].\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20. Groundplan and elevation of the book-recesses in\r\nthe cloister of Worcester Cathedral.]\r\n\r\nAs books multiplied ampler accommodation for them became necessary; and,\r\nas they were to be read in cloister, it was obvious that the new presses\r\nor cases must either be placed in the cloister or be easily accessible\r\nfrom it. The time had not yet come when the collection could be divided,\r\nand be placed partly in the cloister, partly in a separate and sometimes\r\ndistant room. This want of book-room was supplied in two ways. In\r\nBenedictine and possibly in Cluniac houses the books were stored in\r\ndetached wooden presses, which I shall describe presently; but the\r\nCistercians adopted a different method. At the beginning of the twelfth\r\ncentury, when that Order was founded, the need of additional book-space\r\nhad been fully realised; and, consequently, in their houses we meet with a\r\nspecial room set apart for books. But the conservative spirit which\r\ngoverned monastic usage, and discouraged any deviation from the lines of\r\nthe primitive plan, made them keep the press in the wall close to the door\r\nof the church; and, in addition to this, they cut off a piece from the\r\nwest end of the sacristy, which usually intervened between the south\r\ntransept and the Chapter-House, and fitted it up for books. This was done\r\nat Fossa Nuova. The groundplan (fig. 21) shews the press which I have\r\nalready figured, and the book-room between the transept and the\r\nChapter-House, adjoining the sacristy. It is 14 ft. long by 10 ft. broad,\r\nwith a recess in its north wall which perhaps once contained another\r\npress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21. Groundplan of part of the Abbey of Fossa Nuova.\r\n\r\nTo shew the book-room and book-press, and their relations to adjoining\r\nstructures: partly from M. Enlart's work, partly from my own\r\nmeasurements.]\r\n\r\nThere is a similar book-room at Kirkstall Abbey near Leeds, built about\r\n1150. The plan (fig. 22, A) shews its relation to the adjoining\r\nstructures. The _armarium commune_ (_ibid._ B) is a little to the north\r\nof the room, as at Fossa Nuova. A room in a similar position, and destined\r\nno doubt to the same use, is to be seen at Beaulieu, Hayles, Jervaulx,\r\nNetley, Tintern, Croxden, and Roche.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22, Groundplan of part of Kirkstall Abbey, Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nA, book-room: B, _armarium commune_.]\r\n\r\nThe catalogue of the books at the Abbey of Meaux in Holderness[181],\r\nfounded about the middle of the 12th century, has fortunately been\r\npreserved; and it tells us not only what books were kept in one of these\r\nrooms, but how they were arranged. After the contents of the presses in\r\nthe church, which contained chiefly service-books, we come to the \"common\r\npress in the cloister (_commune almarium claustri_).\" On the shelf over\r\nthe door (_in suprema theca[182] supra ostium_) were four psalters. The\r\nframer of the catalogue then passes to the opposite end of the room, and,\r\nbeginning with the top shelf (_suprema theca opposita_), enumerates 37\r\nvolumes. Next, he deals with the rest of the books, which, he tells us,\r\nwere in other shelves, marked with the letters of the alphabet (_in aliis\r\nthecis distinctis per alphabetum_). If I understand the catalogue\r\ncorrectly, there were eleven of these divisions, each containing an\r\naverage of about 25 volumes. The total number of volumes in the collection\r\nwas 316.\r\n\r\nAgain, the catalogue of the House of White Canons at Titchfield in\r\nHampshire, dated 1400, shews that the books were kept in a small room, on\r\nsets of shelves called _columpnae_, set against the walls. The catalogue\r\nbegins as follows:\r\n\r\n    There are in the Library at Tychefeld four cases to set\r\n    books on; two of which, namely the first and the second,\r\n    are on the eastern side. The third is on the south side;\r\n    and the fourth is on the north side. Each of these has\r\n    eight shelves [etc.][183].\r\n\r\nNor was this book-closet confined to Cistercian Houses. In the Cluniac\r\nPriory at Much Wenlock in Shropshire there is a long narrow room on the\r\nwest side of the south transept, opening to the cloister by three arches,\r\nwhich could hardly have been put to any other purpose. It is obvious that\r\nno study could have gone forward in such places; they must have been\r\nintended for security only.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, and further room for books became necessary, it was\r\nprovided, at least in some Cistercian Houses, by cutting off two\r\nrectangular spaces from the west end of the Chapter-House. There is a good\r\nexample of this treatment to be seen at Furness Abbey, built 1150--1200.\r\nThe following description is borrowed from Mr W. H. St John Hope's\r\narchitectural history of the buildings.\r\n\r\n    From the transept southwards the whole of the existing\r\n    work is of later date, and distinctly advanced\r\n    character. The ground storey is pierced with five large\r\n    and elaborate round-headed doorways with good moldings\r\n    and labels, with a delicate dog-tooth ornament. Three of\r\n    these next the transept form a group....\r\n\r\n    The central arch opened, through a vestibule, into the\r\n    Chapter House. The others open into large square\r\n    recesses or chambers, with ashlar walls, and rubble\r\n    barrel-vaults springing from chamfered imposts on each\r\n    side. In the northern chamber the vault is kept low and\r\n    segmental, on account of the passage above it of the\r\n    dorter stair to the church.... The southern chamber has\r\n    a high pointed vault. Neither chamber has had doors, but\r\n    the northern has holes in the inner jamb, suggestive of\r\n    a grate of some kind, of uncertain date.\r\n\r\n    The chambers just described probably contained the\r\n    library, in wooden presses arranged round the\r\n    walls[184].\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this description a portion of Mr Hope's plan of Furness\r\nAbbey (fig. 23) is appended. Each room was about 13 ft. square.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23. Groundplan of part of Furness Abbey.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24. Arches in south wall of Church at Beaulieu Abbey,\r\nHampshire, once possibly used as book-presses.]\r\n\r\nRooms in a similar position are to be seen at Calder Abbey[185] in\r\nCumberland, a daughter-house to Furness; and at Fountains Abbey there are\r\nclear indications that the western angles of the Chapter-House were\r\npartitioned off at some period subsequent to its construction, probably\r\nfor a similar purpose. As the Chapter-House was entered from the cloister\r\nthrough three large round-headed arches, each of the rooms thus formed\r\ncould be entered directly from the cloister, the central arch being\r\nreserved for the Chapter-House itself. The arrangement therefore became\r\nexactly similar to that at Furness. Mr Hope thinks that the series of\r\narches in the church wall at Beaulieu in Hampshire, two of which are here\r\nshewn (fig. 24), may have been used for a like purpose[186]. There is a\r\nsimilar series of arches at Hayles, a daughter-house to Beaulieu; and in\r\nthe south cloister of Chester Cathedral there are six recesses of early\r\nNorman design, which, if not sepulchral, may once have contained books.\r\n\r\nThe use of the Chapter-House and its neighbourhood as the place in which\r\nbooks should be kept is one of the most curious features of the Cistercian\r\nlife. The east walk of the cloister, into which the Chapter-House usually\r\nopened, must have been one of the most frequented parts of the House, and\r\nyet it seems to have been deliberately chosen not merely for keeping\r\nbooks, but for reading them. At Clairvaux, so late as 1709, the authors of\r\nthe _Voyage Litteraire_ record the following arrangement:\r\n\r\n    Le grand cloitre ... est voute et vitre. Les religieux y\r\n    doivent garder un perpetuel silence. Dans le cote du\r\n    chapitre il y a des livres enchainez sur des pupitres de\r\n    bois, dans lesquels les religieux peuvent venir faire\r\n    des lectures lorsqu'ils veulent[187].\r\n\r\nA similar arrangement obtained at Citeaux[188].\r\n\r\nHaving traced the development of the Cistercian book-closet, from a simple\r\nrecess in the wall to a pair of more or less spacious rooms at the west\r\nend of the Chapter-House, I return to my starting-point, and proceed to\r\ndiscuss the arrangement adopted by the Benedictines. They must have\r\nexperienced the inconvenience arising from want of space more acutely than\r\nthe Cistercians, being more addicted to study and the production of books.\r\nThey made no attempt, however, to provide space by structural changes or\r\nadditions to their Houses, but were content with wooden presses in the\r\ncloister for their books, and small wooden studies, called carrells, for\r\nthe readers and writers.\r\n\r\nThe uniformity which governed monastic usage was so strict that the\r\npractice of almost any large monastery may be taken as a type of what was\r\ndone elsewhere. Hence, when we find a full record of the way in which\r\nbooks were used in the great Benedictine House at Durham, we may rest\r\nassured that, _mutatis mutandis_, we have got a good general idea of the\r\nwhole subject. I will therefore begin by quoting a passage from that\r\nvaluable work _The Rites of Durham_, a description of the House drawn up\r\nafter the Reformation by some one who had known it well in other days,\r\npremising only that it represents the final arrangements adopted by the\r\nOrder, and takes no account of the steps that led to them.\r\n\r\n    In the north syde of the Cloister, from the corner over\r\n    against the Church dour to the corner over againste the\r\n    Dorter dour, was all fynely glased from the hight to the\r\n    sole within a litle of the grownd into the Cloister\r\n    garth. And in every wyndowe iij Pewes or Carrells, where\r\n    every one of the old Monks had his carrell, severall by\r\n    himselfe, that, when they had dyned, they dyd resorte to\r\n    that place of Cloister, and there studyed upon there\r\n    books, every one in his carrell, all the after nonne,\r\n    unto evensong tyme. This was there exercise every daie.\r\n\r\n    All there pewes or carrells was all fynely wainscotted\r\n    and verie close, all but the forepart, which had carved\r\n    wourke that gave light in at ther carrell doures of\r\n    wainscott. And in every carrell was a deske to lye there\r\n    bookes on. And the carrells was no greater then from one\r\n    stanchell of the wyndowe to another.\r\n\r\n    And over against the carrells against the church wall\r\n    did stande certaine great almeries [or cupbords] of\r\n    waynscott all full of bookes, wherein did lye as well\r\n    the old auncyent written Doctors of the Church as other\r\n    prophane authors with dyverse other holie mens wourks,\r\n    so that every one dyd studye what Doctor pleased them\r\n    best, havinge the Librarie at all tymes to goe studie in\r\n    besydes there carrells.[189]\r\n\r\nAt Durham the monastic buildings stood to the south of the church, and the\r\nlibrary-walk of the cloister was that walk, or alley, or pane, or syde\r\n(for all these words are used), which had the church to the north of it.\r\nThe library was placed there partly for the sake of warmth, partly to\r\nsecure greater privacy. At Canterbury and at Gloucester, where the church\r\nwas to the south of the conventual buildings, the library-walk of the\r\ncloister was still the walk next to the church, the other walks, as Mr\r\nHope has pointed out to me, being apparently kept clear for the Sunday\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25. The cloister, Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr Micklethwaite's plan of the buildings.]\r\n\r\nI propose to explain the system indicated in the above quotation by\r\nreference to a plan of the cloister at Westminster Abbey, drawn by my\r\nfriend Mr J. T. Micklethwaite (fig. 25)[190], and by quotations from his\r\nnotes upon it. At Durham every vestige of ancient arrangement has been so\r\ncompletely destroyed that it is better to go to another House, where less\r\nmischief has been done, and it happens fortunately that, so far as the\r\nposition of the cloister with reference to the church is concerned,\r\nWestminster is the exact counterpart of Durham. I will consider first the\r\nlast paragraph of my quotation from the _Rites of Durham_, that namely\r\nwhich deals with the presses for books, there called \"almeries or\r\ncupbords.\"\r\n\r\nMr Micklethwaite shews that the two bays at the north end of the west walk\r\nof the cloister, and the second bay from the west in the north walk (fig.\r\n25, nos. 1, 2, 4), were appropriated to the novices, by the existence of\r\nseveral sets of nine holes, evidently cut by boys in their idle moods for\r\nthe playing of some game. Similar holes have been found at Canterbury,\r\nGloucester, and elsewhere. Next he points out that \"the nosing of the\r\nwall-bench for six feet of the third bay from the west in the north walk,\r\nand in the whole of the fourth and fifth bays, and nearly all the sixth,\r\nhas been cut away flush with the riser, as if some large pieces of\r\nfurniture had been placed there (_ibid._ nos. 5, 5, 5, 5). These were\r\nevidently bookcases.\" Eastward of these indications of bookcases \"the\r\nbases of the vaulting-shafts are cut in a way which seems to shew that\r\nthere was a double screen there (_ibid._ nos. 6, 6), or perhaps there were\r\nbookcases arranged so as to form a screen, which is, I think, very likely.\r\nBeyond this screen to the right are appearances in the wall [next the\r\ncloister-garth] which seem to indicate a blocked-up locker, but they are\r\nrather doubtful. And on the left is a large double locker blocked (_ibid._\r\n7), and the blocking appears to be ancient. This locker is of the date of\r\nthe wall (Edw. I.), and may have been an additional book-closet provided,\r\nbecause that on the other side of the church-door [to be described\r\npresently] had become too small, and [was] blocked up when the larger\r\nbookcases were made opposite the carrells[191].\"\r\n\r\nLastly, at the risk of some repetition, I will quote a passage from a\r\nletter which Mr Micklethwaite was so good as to write to me on this\r\nsubject, as it brings out some additional points, and states the whole\r\nquestion with great clearness. After describing the position of the\r\nbookcases, he proceeds:\r\n\r\n    There was thus a space, the width of the bench, between\r\n    the back of the case and the cloister-wall, which would\r\n    help to keep things dry. Whether the floor was boarded\r\n    we cannot now tell, but there is evidence that this part\r\n    of the cloister was cut off from the rest by screens of\r\n    some sort at both ends, which would make it a long\r\n    gallery lighted on one side, and with bookcases ranged\r\n    along the other, not unlike Wren's at Lincoln. The\r\n    windows must have been glazed; indeed remains of the\r\n    glazing existed to the end of the 17th century; and\r\n    there were within my memory marks of fittings along the\r\n    windows-side which I did not then understand, but which,\r\n    if they still existed, would I have no doubt tell us\r\n    something of the _carrells_. A \"thorough restoration\"\r\n    has taken away every trace of them.\r\n\r\nThe \"bookcase on the other side of the church door\" mentioned above was in\r\nthe northernmost bay of the east cloister. Mr Micklethwaite says of it:\r\n\r\n\"Entering the cloister from the church by the east cloister door (_ibid._\r\nno. 8), we find on our left hand a very broad bench against the wall,\r\nextending as far as the entrance to the Chapter-House (_ibid._ 10). In the\r\nmost northern bay the wall-arcade, instead of being brought down by shafts\r\nas in the others, is stopped off at the springing by original brackets, as\r\nif to allow of some large piece of furniture being placed against the\r\nwall. Here, I believe, stood in the thirteenth century the _armarium\r\ncommune_, or common bookcase (_ibid._ 9). At Durham there is a Norman\r\narched recess in the same place, not mentioned by the writer of the\r\n_Rites_, because before his time its use had ceased, books having become\r\nmore numerous, and being provided for elsewhere[192].\"\r\n\r\nThese notes enable us to imagine what this library was like. It was about\r\n80 feet long by 15 feet broad, extending along four bays of the cloister.\r\nIt was cut off by a screen at one end, and possibly at the other also; the\r\nbook-presses stood against the wall, opposite to the windows, which were\r\nprobably glazed, as we know those at Durham were; and there might have\r\nbeen a wooden floor. Further, the older monks sat in \"carrells,\" as we\r\nlearn from the custumary of Abbat Ware, who was in office 1258-83. The\r\nwriter is speaking of the novices, and says that after they have attained\r\na certain degree of proficiency they may sit in cloister, and \"be allowed\r\nto glance at books taken out of the presses (_armaria_) belonging to the\r\nolder monks. But they must not be permitted as yet to write or to have\r\ncarrells[193].\"\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the discomfort of this library according to our\r\nideas, there is good reason for believing that it was in use till 1591,\r\nwhen Dean Williams fitted up part of the Dorter as a library for the use\r\nof the Dean and Canons[194].\r\n\r\nThe practice of placing the book-press in the cloister obtained with equal\r\nforce in France, for the Benedictines who wrote the _Voyage Litteraire_,\r\nand who would of course be well acquainted with what was usual in their\r\nown Order, remark with surprise when they visit the ancient abbey of Cruas\r\non the Rhone, that the press is in the church.\r\n\r\n    On voit encore dans l'eglise l'armoire ou on enfermoit\r\n    les livres, contre la coutume des autres monasteres de\r\n    l'ordre, qui avoient cette armoire dans le cloitre. On y\r\n    lit ces vers d'un caractere qui peut avoir cinq cent\r\n    ans:\r\n\r\n  Pastor jejunat qui libros non coadunat\r\n  Nec panem praebet subjectis quem dare debet[195].\r\n\r\n  A shepherd starves whose store of books is low:\r\n  Nor can he on his flock their due bestow.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo example of an English book-press has survived, so far as I know, but it\r\nwould be rash to say that none exists; nor have I been so fortunate as to\r\nfind one in France, though I have taken a great deal of pains to obtain\r\ninformation on the subject. In default of a press made specially to hold\r\nbooks, I must content myself with representations of two well-known pieces\r\nof furniture--both preserved in French churches.\r\n\r\nThe first (fig. 26) stands in the upper sacristy of the Cathedral of\r\nBayeux, over the south transept. The name usually given to it, _le\r\nChartrier de Bayeux_, implies that it was made to hold documents. M.\r\nViollet-le-Duc does not accept this view, but considers that it contained\r\nreliquaries, with which he probably would not object to associate other\r\narticles of church-plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26. Part of the ancient press in Bayeux Cathedral,\r\ncalled _Le Chartrier de Bayeux_.\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27. Press in the church at Obazine, Central France.\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph.]\r\n\r\nIt is of oak, very coarse, rough, and massive. It is 9 ft. 3 inches high,\r\nfrom floor to top, 17 ft. 2 inches long--(it was originally 3 ft.\r\nlonger)--and 3 ft. deep. There are two rows of cupboards each 3 ft. 8\r\ninches high, with massive doors that still preserve their original\r\nironwork. The whole piece of furniture has once been painted, indications\r\nof which still exist, but the subjects can no longer be made out. M.\r\nViollet-le-Duc[196], who possibly saw the paintings when they were in a\r\nbetter state of preservation than when I examined them in 1896, decides\r\nthat they once represented the translation of relics.\r\n\r\nMy second example (fig. 27) is in the church of Obazine in Central France\r\n(Departement de la Correze). It is far simpler and ruder than the press in\r\nBayeux Cathedral; and the style of ornamentation employed indicates a\r\nsomewhat earlier date; though M, Viollet-le-Duc places the construction of\r\nboth in the first years of the 13th century. It is 6 ft. 7 in. high, by 7\r\nft. broad, and 2 ft. 7 in. deep. The material is oak, which still bears a\r\nfew traces of having once been painted[197].\r\n\r\nThese pieces of furniture were certainly not made specially for books;\r\nbut, as they belong to a period when the monastic system was in full,\r\nvigorous, life, it is at least probable that they resemble those used by\r\nmonks to contain their books. I have shewn in the previous chapter that in\r\nancient Rome the press used for books was essentially the same as that\r\nused for very different purposes; and I submit that it is unnecessary to\r\nsuppose that monastic carpenters would invent a special piece of furniture\r\nto hold books. They would take the _armarium_ that was in daily use, and\r\nadapt it to their own purposes.\r\n\r\nBefore I leave this part of my subject I must mention that there is a\r\nthird press in the Church of Saint Germain l'Auxerrois, Paris. It stands\r\nin a small room over the south end of the west porch, which may once have\r\nbeen a muniment room. It was probably made about a century later than\r\nthose which I have figured. In arrangement it bears a general resemblance\r\nto the example from Bayeux. It consists of six cupboards arranged in two\r\ntiers, the lower of which is raised to the level of a bench which extends\r\nalong the whole length of the piece of furniture, with its ends mortised\r\ninto those of the cupboards. The seat of this bench lifts up, so as to\r\nform an additional receptacle for books or papers[198].\r\n\r\nThe curious wooden contrivances called carrells, which are mentioned in\r\nthe above quotation from the _Rites of Durham_, have of course entirely\r\ndisappeared. Nothing is said about their height; but in breadth each of\r\nthem was equal to the distance from the middle of one mullion of a window\r\nto the middle of the next; it was made of wainscot, and had a door of open\r\ncarved work by which it was entered from the cloister. This arrangement\r\nwas doubtless part of the systematic supervision of brother by brother\r\nthat was customary in a monastery. Even the aged, though engaged in study,\r\nwere not to be left to their own devices. I have carefully measured the\r\nwindows at Durham (fig. 28); and, though they have been a good deal\r\naltered, I suppose the mullions are in their original places. If this be\r\nso the carrells could not have been more than 2 ft. 9 in. wide, and the\r\noccupant would have found but little room to spare. There are eleven\r\nwindows, so that thirty-three monks could have been accommodated, on the\r\nsupposition that all were fitted with carrells.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28. Groundplan of one of the windows in the cloister\r\nof Durham Cathedral.]\r\n\r\nIn the south cloister at Gloucester there is a splendid series of twenty\r\nstone carrells (fig. 29), built between 1370 and 1412. Each carrell is 4\r\nft. wide, 19 in. deep, and 6 ft. 9 in. high, lighted by a small window of\r\ntwo lights; but as figures do not give a very vivid idea of size, and as I\r\ncould not find any one else to do what I wanted, I borrowed a chair from\r\nthe church and a folio from the library, and sat down to read, as one of\r\nthe monks might have done six centuries ago (fig. 30). There is no trace\r\nof any woodwork appertaining to these carrells; or of any book-press\r\nhaving ever stood near them. The easternmost carrell, however, differs a\r\ngood deal from the others, and it may have been used as a book-closet.\r\nThere is a bench-table along the wall of the church opposite to the\r\ncarrells; but it does not appear to have been cut away to make room for\r\nbook-presses, as at Westminster. The south alley appears to have been shut\r\noff at the east end, and also at the west end, by a screen[199].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29. Range of carrells in the south cloister at\r\nGloucester Cathedral.\r\n\r\n(From Mr Murray's _Handbook to the Western Cathedrals_.)]\r\n\r\nThis drawing will help us to understand the arrangement of the wooden\r\ncarrells used at Durham and elsewhere. Each carrell must have closely\r\nresembled a modern sentry-box, with this difference, that one side was\r\nformed by a light of the window looking into the cloister-garth, opposite\r\nto which was the door of entrance. This, I imagine, would be of no great\r\nheight; and moreover was made of open work, partly that the work of the\r\noccupant might be supervised, partly to let as much light as possible pass\r\nthrough into the cloister-library. The seat would be on one side of the\r\ncarrell and the desk on the other, the latter being so arranged that the\r\nlight would enter on the reader's left hand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30. A single carrell, Gloucester Cathedral.]\r\n\r\nCarrells seem to have been usual in monasteries from very early times, not\r\nto have been introduced at a comparatively late date in order to ensure\r\ngreater comfort. The earliest passage referring to them is that which I\r\nhave already quoted[200], shewing that they were in use at Westminster\r\nbetween 1258 and 1283; at Bury S. Edmunds the destruction of the carrells\r\nis mentioned among other outrages in a riot in 1327[201]; they occur at\r\nEvesham between 1367 and 1379[202]; at Abingdon in 1383-84[203]; and at\r\nChrist Church, Canterbury, it is recorded among the good deeds of Prior\r\nSellyng (1472-94), that in the south alley of the cloister \"novos Textus\r\nquos Carolos ex novo vocamus perdecentes fecit\"; words which Professor\r\nWillis renders \"constructed there very convenient framed contrivances\r\nwhich are now-a-days called carols[204].\" Their use--at any rate in some\r\nHouses--is evident from an injunction among the Customs of S. Augustine's,\r\nCanterbury, to the effect that the cellarer and others who rarely sit in\r\ncloister might not have carrells, nor in fact any brother unless he be\r\nable to help the community by copying or illuminating, or at least by\r\nadding musical notation[205]. They were in fact devices to provide a\r\ncertain amount of privacy for literary work in Houses where there was no\r\n_Scriptorium_ or writing-room. At Durham, according to the author of\r\n_Rites_, they were used exclusively for reading.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned Customs of S. Augustine's, written between 1310 and\r\n1344, give a valuable contemporary picture of the organization of one of\r\nthe more important cloister-libraries. The care of the presses is to be\r\nentrusted to the Precentor and his subordinate, called the Succentor. The\r\nformer is to have a seat in front of the press--which doubtless stood\r\nagainst the wall--and his carrell is to stand at no great distance, on the\r\nstone between the piers of the arches next the cloister-garth. The\r\nSuccentor is to have his seat and his carrell on the bench near the\r\npress--by which the bench which commonly ran along the cloister-wall is\r\nobviously meant. These arrangements are made \"in order that these two\r\nofficers, or at least one of them, may always be at hand to satisfy\r\nbrethren who make any demand upon their time[206].\" In other words, they\r\nwere the librarian and sub-librarian, who were to be always ready to\r\nanswer questions. It is clear that brethren were not allowed to handle the\r\nbooks as they pleased.\r\n\r\nThe cloister at Durham, or at least that part of it which was used as a\r\nlibrary, was glazed; but whether with white glass or stained glass we are\r\nnot informed. So obvious a device for increasing both the comfort and the\r\nbeauty of a much-frequented part of the monastic buildings was doubtless\r\nadopted in many other Houses. At Bury S. Edmunds part at least of the\r\ncloister had \"painted windows representing the sun, moon and stars and the\r\noccupations of the months\"; at Christ Church, Canterbury, Prior Sellyng\r\n(1472-94) \"had the south walk of the cloister glazed for the use of the\r\nstudious brethren\"; at Peterborough the windows of the cloister\r\n\r\n    were all compleat and fair, adorned with glass of\r\n    excellent painting: In the South Cloyster was the\r\n    History of the Old Testament: In the East Cloyster of\r\n    the New: In the North Cloyster the Figures of the\r\n    successive Kings from King _Peada_: In the West Cloyster\r\n    was the History from the first foundation of the\r\n    Monastery of King _Peada_, to the restoring of it by\r\n    King _Edgar_. Every window had at the bottom the\r\n    explanation of the History thus in Verse[207].\r\n\r\nAt Westminster, as recorded above, traces of the insertion of glass have\r\nbeen observed.\r\n\r\nIn later times, when regular libraries had been built for the monasteries,\r\na special series of portraits occasionally appeared in glass, on a system\r\nsimilar to that worked out in other materials in Roman and post-Roman\r\nlibraries; and sometimes, in other libraries, subjects are to be met with\r\ninstead of portraits, to indicate the nature of the works standing near\r\nthem. But I cannot say whether cloister-glass was ever treated in this\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[115] _Epist._ XLIX. Sec. 3. Ad Pammachium.

It is difficult to\r\nunderstand the reason for this formal assignment of a book to each brother\r\nwho chose to ask for one. As brethren in those early times had no separate\r\ncubicles or cells, it could hardly imply more than a precaution against\r\nthe difficulty of two brethren requiring the use of the same volume.\r\nPossibly the whole intention was disciplinary, to ensure study as\r\nprescribed by the Rule.\r\n\r\n[147] Delisle, _Bibl. de l'Ecole des Chartes_, Ser. 3, Vol. I. p. 225.\r\nInterdicimus inter alia viris religiosis, ne emittant juramentum de non\r\ncommodando libros suos indigentibus, cum commodare inter praecipua\r\nmisericordiae opera computetur.

RIQUIER, BOBBIO, DURHAM, CANTERBURY.\r\nBOOKS KEPT IN OTHER PLACES THAN THE CLOISTER. EXPEDIENTS FOR HOUSING THEM\r\nAT DURHAM, CITEAUX, AND ELSEWHERE. SEPARATE LIBRARIES BUILT IN FIFTEENTH\r\nCENTURY AT DURHAM, S. ALBANS, CITEAUX, CLAIRVAUX, ETC. GRADUAL EXTENSION\r\nOF LIBRARY AT S. GERMAIN DES PRES. LIBRARIES ATTACHED TO CATHEDRALS.\r\nLINCOLN, SALISBURY, WELLS, NOYON, ROUEN, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter I attempted to describe the way in which the Monastic\r\nOrders provided for the safe keeping of their books, so long as their\r\ncollections were not larger than could be accommodated in a press or\r\npresses in the cloister, or in the small rooms used by the Cistercians for\r\nthe same purpose. I have now to carry the investigation a step farther,\r\nand to shew how books were treated when a separate library was built.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that an extensive collection of books was regarded\r\nas indispensable in all monastic establishments. In many Houses, partly\r\nfrom lack of funds, partly from an indisposition to study, the books were\r\nprobably limited to those required for the services and for the daily life\r\nof the brethren. In other places, on the contrary, where the fashion of\r\nbook-collecting had been set from very early days, by some abbat or prior\r\nmore learned or more active than his fellows; and where brethren in\r\nconsequence had learnt to take a pride in their books, whether they read\r\nthem or not, a large collection was got together at a date when even a\r\nroyal library could be contained in a single chest of very modest\r\ndimensions. For instance, when an inventory of the possessions of the\r\nBenedictine House of S. Riquier near Abbeville was made at the request of\r\nLouis le Debonnaire in 831 A.D., it was found that the library contained\r\n250 volumes; and a note at the end of the catalogue informs us that if the\r\ndifferent treatises had been entered separately, the number of entries\r\nwould have exceeded five hundred, as many books were frequently bound in a\r\nsingle volume. The works in this library are roughly sorted under the\r\nheadings Divinity, Grammar, History and Geography, Sermons,\r\nService-books[208]. A similar collection existed at S. Gall at the same\r\nperiod[209]. In the next century we find nearly seven hundred manuscripts\r\nin a Benedictine monastery at Bobbio in north Italy[210]; and nearly six\r\nhundred in a House belonging to the same order at Lorsch in Germany[211].\r\nAt Durham, also a Benedictine House, a catalogue made early in the twelfth\r\ncentury contains three hundred and sixty-six titles[212]; but, as at S.\r\nRiquier, the number of works probably exceeded six or seven hundred.\r\n\r\nThese instances, which I have purposely selected from different parts of\r\nEurope, and which could easily have been increased, are sufficient to\r\nindicate the rapidity with which books could be, and in fact were\r\naccumulated, when the taste for such collections had once been set. Year\r\nby year, slowly yet surely, by purchase, by gift, by bequest, by the zeal\r\nof the staff of writers whom the precentor drilled and kept at work, the\r\nnumber grew, till in certain Houses it reached dimensions which must have\r\nembarrassed those responsible for its bestowal. At Christ Church,\r\nCanterbury, for instance, the catalogue made by Henry de Estria, Prior\r\n1285-1331, enumerates about 1850 manuscripts[213].\r\n\r\nIt must gradually have become impossible to accommodate such collections\r\nas these according to the old method, even supposing it was desirable to\r\ndo so. There were doubtless many duplicates, and manuscripts of value\r\nrequiring special care. Consequently we find that places other than the\r\ncloister were used to keep books in. At Durham, for instance, the\r\ncatalogues made at the end of the fourteenth century enumerate (1) \"the\r\nbooks in the common press at Durham in sundry places in the cloister\" (386\r\nvolumes)[214]; (2) \"the books in the common press at Durham in the\r\nSpendment\" (408 volumes)[215]; (3) \"the inner library at Durham called\r\nSpendment\" (87 volumes)[216]; (4) \"the books for reading in the frater\r\nwhich lie in the press near the entrance to the farmery\" (17\r\nvolumes)[217]; (5) \"the books in the common press of the novices at Durham\r\nin the cloister\" (23 volumes)[218]. Of the above catalogues the first\r\nobviously deals with the contents of the great \"almeries of wainscot\"\r\nwhich stood in the cloister; the second and third with the books for which\r\nno room could be found there, and which in consequence had been\r\ntransferred to a room on the west side of the cloister, where wages were\r\npaid and accounts settled. In the _Rites of Durham_ it is termed the\r\ntreasure-house or chancery. It was divided into two by a grate of iron,\r\nbehind which sat the officer who made the payments. The books seem to have\r\nbeen kept partly in the outer half of the room, partly within this grate.\r\n\r\nAt Citeaux, the parent-house of the Cistercian order, a large and wealthy\r\nmonastery in Burgundy, the books were still more scattered, as appears\r\nfrom the catalogue[219] drawn up by John de Cirey, abbat at the end of the\r\nfifteenth century, now preserved, with 312 of the manuscripts enumerated\r\nin it, in the public library of Dijon.\r\n\r\nThis catalogue, written on vellum, in double columns, with initial letters\r\nin red and blue alternately, records the titles of 1200 MSS and printed\r\nbooks; but the number of the latter is not great. It is headed:\r\n\r\n    Inventory of the books at Citeaux, in the diocese of\r\n    Chalons, made by us, brother John, abbat of the said\r\n    House, in the year of our Lord 1480, after we had caused\r\n    the said books to be set to rights, bound, and covered,\r\n    at a vast expense, by the labour of two and often three\r\n    binders, employed continuously during two years[220].\r\n\r\nThis heading is succeeded by the following statement:\r\n\r\n    And first of the books now standing (_existencium_) in\r\n    the library of the dorter, which we have arranged as it\r\n    is, because the room had been for a long time useless,\r\n    and formerly served as a tailory and vestry, ... but for\r\n    two years or nearly so nothing or very little had been\r\n    put there[221].\r\n\r\nA bird's-eye view of Citeaux, dated 1674, preserved in the Bibliotheque\r\nNationale, Paris, shews a small building between the Frater and the\r\nDorter, which M. Viollet-le-Duc, who has reproduced[222] part of it,\r\nletters \"staircase to the dorter.\" The room in question was probably at\r\nthe top of this staircase, and the arrangements which I am about to\r\ndiscuss shew beyond all question that the Dorter was at one end of it and\r\nthe Frater at the other.\r\n\r\nThere were six bookcases, called benches (_banche_), evidently\r\ncorresponding to the _sedilia_ or \"seats\" mentioned in many English\r\nmedieval catalogues. The writer takes the bookcases in order, beginning as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  De prima banca inferius versus refectorium (13 vols.).\r\n      In 2^a linea prime banche superius (17 vols.).\r\n  In 2^a banca inferius de latere dormitorii (18 vols.).\r\n     \"   \"  superius   \"   \"  (14 vols.).\r\n  In 2^a banca inferius de latere refectorii (15 vols.).\r\n     \"   \"  superius   \"   \"  (18 vols.).\r\n\r\nThe third and fifth _banche_, containing respectively 75 volumes and 68\r\nvolumes, are described in identical language; but the descriptions of the\r\n4th and 6th differ sufficiently to make quotation necessary:\r\n\r\n  In quarta banca de latere dormitorii (24 vols.).\r\n       \"      \"        \"    refectorii (16 vols.).\r\n  In sexta banca de latere dormitorii (25 vols.).\r\n  Libri sequentes sunt in dicta sexta banca de latere dormitorii inferius\r\n          sub analogio (38 vols.).\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the first _banca_ was set against the Dorter wall, so\r\nthat it faced the Frater; and that it consisted of two shelves only, the\r\nsecond of which is spoken of as a line (_linea_)[223]. The second, third,\r\nand fifth _banche_ were detached pieces of furniture, with two shelves on\r\neach side. I cannot explain why the fourth is described in such different\r\nlanguage. It is just possible that only one shelf on each side may have\r\nbeen occupied by books when the catalogue was compiled. I conjecture that\r\nthe sixth stood against the Frater wall, thus facing the Dorter, and that\r\nit consisted of a shelf, with a desk below it, and a second shelf of books\r\nbelow that again.\r\n\r\nBesides these cases there were other receptacles for books called\r\ncupboards (_armaria_) and also some chests. These are noted in the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\n  Secuntur libri existentes in armariis librarie.\r\n  In primo armario de latere versus refectorium (36 vols.).\r\n  In secundo armario (53 vols.).\r\n  In tertio armario (24 vols.).\r\n  Sequuntur libri existentes in cofro seu archa juxta gradus ascensus ad\r\n          vestiarium in libraria (46 vols.).\r\n  In quadam cista juxta analogium de latere refectorii (9 vols.).\r\n\r\nThe total of the MSS. stored in this room amounts to 509. In addition to\r\nthese the catalogue next enumerates \"Books of the choir, church, and\r\ncloister (53 vols.); Books taken out of the library for the daily use of\r\nthe convent (29 vols.); Books chained on desks (_super analogiis_) before\r\nthe Chapter-House (5 vols.); on the second desk (5 vols.); on the third\r\ndesk (4 vols.); on the fifth desk (4 vols.); Books taken out of the\r\nlibrary partly to be placed in the cloister, partly to be divided among\r\nthe brethren (27 vols.); Books on the small desks in the cloister (5\r\nvols.); Books to be read publicly in convent or to be divided among the\r\nbrethren for private reading (99 vols.).\" These different collections of\r\nMSS., added together, make a total of 740 volumes, which seem to have been\r\nscattered over the House, wherever a spare corner could be found for them.\r\n\r\nThe inconvenience of such an arrangement, or want of arrangement, is\r\nobvious; and it must have caused much friction in the House. We can\r\nimagine the officer in charge of the finances resenting the intrusion of\r\nhis brother of the library with an asperity not wholly in accordance with\r\nfraternal charity. And yet, so strong is the tendency of human nature to\r\nput up with whatever exists, rather than be at the trouble of changing it,\r\nno effectual steps in the way of remedy were taken until the fifteenth\r\ncentury. In that century, however, we find that in most of the large\r\nmonasteries a special room was constructed to hold books. Reading went\r\nforward, as heretofore, in the cloister, and I conceive that the books\r\nstored in the new library were mainly intended for loan or for reference.\r\nAs at Durham, the monks could go there when they chose.\r\n\r\nThese conventual libraries were usually built over some existing building,\r\nor over the cloister. Sometimes, especially in France, the library appears\r\nas an additional storey added to any building with walls strong enough to\r\nbear it; sometimes again as a detached building. I will cite a few\r\nexamples of libraries in these different positions.\r\n\r\nAt Christ Church, Canterbury, a library, about 60 ft. long by 22 ft.\r\nbroad, was built by Archbishop Chichele between 1414 and 1443, over the\r\nPrior's Chapel[224], and William Sellyng (Prior 1472-1494) \"adorned [it]\r\nwith beautiful wainscot, and also furnished it with certain volumes\r\nchiefly for the use of those addicted to study, whom he zealously and\r\ngenerously encouraged and patronised[225].\"\r\n\r\nAt Durham Prior Wessyngton, about 1446, either built or thoroughly\r\nrepaired and refitted a room over the old sacristy, between the\r\nChapter-House and the south Transept, or, as the _Rites_ say, \"betwixt the\r\nChapter House and the Te Deum wyndowe, being well replenished with ould\r\nwritten Docters and other histories and ecclesiasticall writers[226].\"\r\nWessyngton's work must have been extensive and thorough, for it cost,\r\nincluding the repairs of the books, L90. 16_s._ 0_d._[227]--at least L1100\r\nor L1200 at the present value of money. The position of this library will\r\nbe understood from the illustration (fig. 31). The room is 44 ft. 10 in.\r\nlong, by 18 ft. wide, with a window at each end, 13 ft. wide, of five\r\nlights, and a very rough roof of oak, resting on plain stone corbels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31. Library at Durham, built by Prior Wessyngton about\r\n1446.]\r\n\r\nAt Gloucester the library is in a similar position, but the date of its\r\nconstruction is uncertain. It has been described as follows by Mr Hope:\r\n\r\n    The library is an interesting room of fourteenth century\r\n    date, retaining much of its original open roof. The\r\n    north side has eleven windows, each of two square-headed\r\n    lights and perfectly plain.... [There are no windows on\r\n    the south side.] The large end windows are late\r\n    perpendicular, each of seven lights with a transom.\r\n    There are other alterations, such as the beautiful\r\n    wooden corbels from which the roof springs, which are\r\n    probably contemporary with the work of the cloister when\r\n    the western stair to the library was built, and the room\r\n    altered.\r\n\r\nAt Winchester a precisely similar position was selected between the\r\nChapter-House and the south transept, above a passage leading from the\r\ncloister to the ground at the south-east end of the church.\r\n\r\nAt the Benedictine House of S. Albans the library was begun in 1452 by\r\nJohn Whethamstede, Prior, and completed in the following year at the cost\r\nof L150[228]--a sum which represents about L2000 at the present day--but\r\nthe position has not been recorded.\r\n\r\nAt Worcester, also Benedictine, it seems probable that the library\r\noccupied from very early times the long, narrow room over the south aisle\r\nof the nave to which it was restored in 1866. This room, which extends\r\nfrom the transept to the west end of the church, is 130 ft. 7 in. long, 19\r\nft. 6 in. wide, and 8 ft. 6 in. high on the south side. It is lighted by\r\ntwelve windows, eleven of which are of two lights each, and that nearest\r\nto the transept of three lights. The room is approached by a circular\r\nstone staircase at the south-west angle of the cathedral, access to which\r\nis from the outside only[229].\r\n\r\nAt Bury S. Edmund's abbat William Curteys (1429-45) built a library, on an\r\nunknown site: but his work is worth commemorating, as another instance of\r\nthe great fifteenth century movement in monasteries for providing special\r\nrooms to contain books.\r\n\r\nAt S. Victor, Paris, an Augustinian House, the library was built between\r\n1501 and 1508, I believe over the sacristy; at Groenendaal, near Brussels,\r\nalso Augustinian, it was built over the whole length of the north cloister\r\n(a distance of 175 feet), so that its windows faced the south.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32. Library of the Grey Friars House, London, commonly\r\ncalled Christ's Hospital.\r\n\r\nFrom Trollope's History.]\r\n\r\nThe Franciscan House in London, commonly called Christ's Hospital, had a\r\nnoble library, founded 21 October, 1421, by Sir Richard Whittington,\r\nmercer and Lord Mayor of London. By Christmas Day in the following year\r\nthe building was roofed in; and before three years were over it was\r\nfloored, plastered, glazed, furnished with desks and wainscot, and stocked\r\nwith books. The cost was L556. 16_s._ 8_d._; of which L400 was paid by\r\nWhittington, and the rest by Thomas Wynchelsey, one of the brethren, and\r\nhis friends[230]. It extended over the whole of one alley of the cloister\r\n(fig. 32). Stow tells us that it was 129 ft. long, by 31 ft. broad[231];\r\nand, according to the letters patent of Henry VIII., dated 13 January,\r\n1547, by which the site was conveyed to the City of London, it contained\r\n\"28 Desks and 28 Double Settles of Wainscot[232].\"\r\n\r\nI have recounted the expedients to which the monks of Citeaux were reduced\r\nwhen their books had become too numerous for the cloister. I will now\r\ndescribe their permanent library. This is shewn in the bird's-eye view\r\ndated 1674 to which I have already referred, and also in a second similar\r\nview, dated 1718, preserved in the archives of the town of Dijon[233],\r\nwhere I had the good fortune to discover it in 1894. It is accompanied by\r\na plan of the whole monastery, and also by a special plan[234] of the\r\nlibrary (fig. 35). The buildings had by this time been a good deal\r\naltered, and partly rebuilt in the classical style of the late\r\nrenaissance; but in these changes the library had been respected. I\r\nreproduce (fig. 33) the portion of the view containing it and the\r\nadjoining structures, together with the corresponding ground-plan (fig.\r\n34).\r\n\r\nThe authors of the _Voyage Litteraire_, Fathers Martene and Durand, who\r\nvisited Citeaux in 1710, thus describe this library:\r\n\r\n    Citeaux sent sa grande maison et son chef d'ordre. Tout\r\n    y est grand, beau et magnifique, mais d'une magnificence\r\n    qui ne blesse point la simplicite religieuse....\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33. Bird's-eye view of part of the Monastery of\r\nCiteaux. From a drawing dated 1718. A, library; B, farmery.]\r\n\r\n    Les trois cloitres sont proportionnez au reste des\r\n    batimens. Dans l'un de ces cloitres on voit de petites\r\n    cellules comme a Clervaux, qu'on appelle les ecritoires,\r\n    parce que les anciens moines y ecrivoient des livres. La\r\n    bibliotheque est au dessus; le vaisseau est grand,\r\n    voute, et bien perce. Il y a bon fonds de livres\r\n    imprimez sur toutes sortes de matieres, et sept ou huit\r\n    cent manuscrits, dont la plupart sont des ouvrages des\r\n    peres de l'eglise[235].\r\n\r\nThe ground-plan (fig. 34) shews the writing-rooms or _scriptoria_,\r\napparently six in number, eastward of the church; and the bird's-eye view\r\n(fig. 33) the library built over them. Unfortunately we know nothing of\r\nthe date of its construction. It occupied the greater part of the north\r\nside of a cloister called \"petit cloitre\" or Farmery Cloister, from the\r\nlarge building on the east side originally built as a Farmery (fig. 33,\r\nB). It was approached by a newel-stair at its south-west corner (fig. 35).\r\nThis stair gave access to a vestibule, in which, on the west, was a door\r\nleading into a room called small library (_petite bibliotheque_),\r\napparently built over one of the chapels at the east end of the church\r\n(fig. 34). The destination of this room is not known. The library proper\r\nwas about 83 feet long by 25 feet broad[236], vaulted, and lighted by six\r\nwindows in the north and south walls. There was probably an east window\r\nalso, but as explained above, it was intended, when this plan was drawn,\r\nto build a new gallery for books at this end of the older structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34, Ground-plan of part of the Monastery of Citeaux.\r\nFrom a plan dated 1718.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35, Ground-plan of the Library at Citeaux.]\r\n\r\nI proceed next to the library at Clairvaux, a House which may be called\r\nthe eldest daughter of Citeaux, having been founded by S. Bernard in 1115.\r\nThis library was built in a position precisely similar to that at Citeaux,\r\nnamely, eastward of the church, on the north side of the second cloister,\r\nover the _Scriptoria_. Begun in 1495, it was completed in 1503; and was\r\nevidently regarded as a work of singular beauty, over which the House\r\nought to rejoice, for the building of it is commemorated in the following\r\nstanzas written on the first leaf of a catalogue made between 1496 and\r\n1509, and now preserved in the library at Troyes[237]:\r\n\r\n  La construction de cette librairie.\r\n\r\n  Jadis se fist cette construction\r\n  Par bons ouvriers subtilz et plains de sens\r\n  L'an qu'on disoit de l'incarnation\r\n  Nonante cinq avec mil quatre cens.\r\n\r\n  Et tant y fut besongnie de courage\r\n  En pierre, en bois, et autre fourniture\r\n  Qu'apres peu d'ans acheve fut louvrage\r\n  Murs et piliers et voulte et couverture.\r\n\r\n  Puis en apres l'an mil v^c et trois\r\n  Y furent mis les livres des docteurs:\r\n  Le doux Jesus qui pendit en la croix\r\n  Doint paradis aux devotz fondateurs.\r\n\r\n                                 Amen.\r\n\r\nWe fortunately possess a minute description of Clairvaux, written, soon\r\nafter the completion of the new library, by the secretary to the Queen of\r\nSicily, who came there 13 July, 1517, and was taken, apparently, through\r\nevery part of the monastery[238]. The account of the library is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Et de ce meme coste [dudit cloistre] sont xiiii estudes\r\n    ou les religieulx escripvent et estudient, lesquelles\r\n    sont tres belles, et au dessus d'icelles estudes est la\r\n    neufve librairerie, a laquelle l'on va par une vis large\r\n    et haulte estant audict cloistre, laquelle librairie\r\n    contient de longeur lxiii passees, et de largeur xvii\r\n    passees.\r\n\r\n    En icelle y a quarante huic banctz, et en chacun banc\r\n    quatre poulpitres fournys de livres de touttes sciences,\r\n    et principallement en theologie, dont la pluspart\r\n    desdicts livres sont en parchemin et escript a la main,\r\n    richement historiez et enluminez.\r\n\r\n    L'ediffice de ladicte librairie est magnificque et\r\n    massonnee, et bien esclaire de deux costez de belles\r\n    grandes fenestres, bien vitres, ayant regard sur ledict\r\n    cloistre et cimitiere des Abbez. La couverture est de\r\n    plomb et semblablement de ladite eglise et cloistre, et\r\n    tous les pilliers bouttans d'iceulx ediffices couverts\r\n    de plomb.\r\n\r\n    Le devant d'icelle librairie est moult richement orne et\r\n    entaille par le bas de collunnes d'estranges facons, et\r\n    par le hault de riches feuillaiges, pinacles et\r\n    tabernacles, garnis de grandes ymaiges, qui decorent et\r\n    embelissent ledict edifice. La vis, par laquelle on y\r\n    monte, est a six pans, larges pour y monter trois hommes\r\n    de front, et couronne a l'entour de cleres voyes de\r\n    massonerie. Ladicte librairerie est toute pavee de\r\n    petits carreaulx a diverses figures.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to place by the side of this description a second,\r\nwritten nearly two hundred years later, by the authors of the _Voyage\r\nLitteraire_, who visited Clairvaux in the spring of 1709:\r\n\r\n    Le grand cloitre ... est voute et vitre. Les religieux y\r\n    doivent garder un perpetuel silence. Dans le cote du\r\n    chapitre il y a des livres enchainez sur des pupitres de\r\n    bois, dans lesquels les religieux peuvent venir faire\r\n    des lectures lorsqu'ils veulent....\r\n\r\n    Du grand cloitre on entre dans le cloitre du colloque,\r\n    ainsi appelle, parce qu'il est permis aux religieux d'y\r\n    parler. Il y a dans ce cloitre douze ou quinze petites\r\n    cellules tout d'un rang, ou les religieux ecrivoient\r\n    autrefois des livres: c'est pourquoy on les appelle\r\n    encore aujourd'hui les ecritoires. Au-dessus de ces\r\n    cellules est la bibliotheque, dont le vaisseau est\r\n    grand, voute, bien perce, et rempli d'un grand nombre de\r\n    manuscrits, attachez avec des chaines sur des pupitres,\r\n    mais il y a peu de livres imprimez[239].\r\n\r\nThe plan of the substruction of this new library, as shewn on the\r\nground-plan of Clairvaux given by Viollet Le Duc[240], is exactly the same\r\nas that of Citeaux (fig. 33) but on a larger scale. The library itself, as\r\nthere, was approached by a newel stair at its south-west corner. This\r\nstair was hexagonal, and of a diameter sufficient to allow three men to\r\nascend at the same time. The library was of great extent--being about 206\r\nfeet long by 56 feet broad--if the dimensions given in the above account\r\nbe correct, and if I am right in supposing a pace (_passee_) to be\r\nequivalent to a modern _metre_; vaulted, and well lighted. The Queen's\r\nsecretary seems to have been specially struck by the beauty, the size, and\r\nthe decoration of the windows. The floor was paved with encaustic tiles.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to note how, in some Houses, the library slowly\r\nexpanded itself, occupying, one after another, every coign of\r\nvantage-ground. An excellent example of this growth is to be found in the\r\nabbey of Saint Germain des Pres, Paris; and fortunately there are several\r\nviews, taken at different periods before the Revolution, on which the\r\ngradual extension of the library can be readily traced. I append a portion\r\nof two of these. The first (fig. 36), dated 1687, shews the library over\r\nthe south walk of the cloister, where it was placed in 1555. It must not,\r\nhowever, be supposed that no library existed before this. On the contrary,\r\nthe House seems to have had one from the first foundation, and so early as\r\nthe thirteenth century it could be consulted by strangers, and books\r\nborrowed from it. The second view (fig. 37), dated 1724, shews a still\r\nfurther extension of the library. It has now invaded the west side of the\r\ncloister, which has received an upper storey; and even the external\r\nappearance of the venerable Frater, which was respected when nearly all\r\nthe rest of the buildings were rebuilt in a classical style, has been\r\nsacrificed to a similar gallery. The united lengths of these three rooms\r\nmust have been little short of 384 feet. This library was at the disposal\r\nof all scholars who desired to use it. When the Revolution came it\r\ncontained more than 49,000 printed books, and 7000 manuscripts[241].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36. Part of the Abbey of S.

I regret that it has now become impossible to\r\ndiscover the site or the extent of such a library as that of York, which\r\nwas well stocked with books so early as the middle of the eighth century;\r\nor of that of Notre Dame de Paris, which was a centre of instruction as\r\nwell as of learning; but some good examples of capitular libraries can be\r\nfound in other places; and, like those of the monasteries, they were for\r\nthe most part built in the fifteenth century. I will begin with the\r\nlibrary of Lincoln Cathedral, part of which is still in existence[242].\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral of Lincoln was founded at the close of the eleventh century,\r\nand in the middle of the twelfth we find the books belonging to it kept in\r\na press (_armarium_). We learn this from the heading of a list[243] of\r\nthem when placed in the charge of Hamo, Chancellor 1150-1182, written on\r\nthe first page of a copy of the Vulgate, the first volume in the\r\ncollection:\r\n\r\n    Quando Hamoni cancellario cancellaria data fuit et\r\n    librorum cura commissa, hos in armario invenit libros et\r\n    sub custodia sua recepit, scilicet:\r\n\r\n        Bibliothecam in duobus voluminibus [etc.].\r\n\r\nThe list which follows enumerates 42 volumes, together with a map of the\r\nworld. To this small collection there were added in Hamo's time, either by\r\nhis own gift or by that of other benefactors, 31 volumes more; so that\r\nbefore his death the press contained 73 volumes, probably a large\r\ncollection for that period. Besides these, there were service-books in the\r\ncharge of the bursar (_thesaurarius_), and song-books in that of the\r\nprecentor. The three collections were probably kept in the church.\r\n\r\nThe first indication of a separate room to contain books is afforded by\r\nthe gift of a volume by Philip Repyndon, Bishop 1405-1419, in which year\r\nhe resigned. It is given after his resignation, \"to the new library to be\r\nbuilt within the Church of Lincoln.\" Again, Thomas Duffield, formerly\r\nChancellor, who died in 1426, bequeathed another book \"to the new library\r\nof the aforesaid church.\" The erection of the new library may therefore be\r\nplaced between 1419 and 1426.\r\n\r\nA catalogue, now in the muniment room at Lincoln, which, on internal\r\nevidence, may be dated about 1450, enumerates 107 works, of which 77\r\n(more or less) have been identified as still in the library. The heading,\r\nwhich I will translate, refers to a chaining of the books which had\r\nrecently taken place, possibly after the construction of the cases which I\r\nshall describe in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\n    It is to be noted that in this indenture are enumerated\r\n    all the books in the library of the church of blessed\r\n    Mary of Lincoln which have lately been secured with\r\n    locks and chains; of which indenture one part is\r\n    stitched into the end of the black book of the aforesaid\r\n    church, and the other part remains in ...[244].\r\n\r\nThe library--a timber structure--was placed over the northern half of the\r\neast walk of the cloister. At present only three bays at the north end\r\nremain; but there were originally two bays more, at the south end, between\r\nthe existing structure and the Chapter-House. These were destroyed in\r\n1789, when the following Chapter Order was made (7 May):\r\n\r\n    That the old Library adjoining to the Chapter House\r\n    shall be taken down, and the part of the Cloysters under\r\n    it new leaded and the walls compleated, and the Stair\r\n    case therto removed, and a new Stair Case made, agreable\r\n    to a plan and estimate of the Expence thereof.\r\n\r\nI will now briefly describe the room, with the assistance of the plan\r\n(fig. 38)[245], and the view of the interior (fig. 39).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39. Interior of the Old Library, Lincoln Cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe open door leads into Dean Honywood's Library, as described in Chapter\r\nVIII.]\r\n\r\nThe walls are 9 ft. 8 in. high, from the floor to the top of the\r\nwall-plate. They are divided into bays, each 7 ft. 9 in. wide, by vertical\r\nshafts, from which, at a height of 5 ft. 9 in. from the ground, spring the\r\nbraces which support the tiebeams of the roof. These are massive beams of\r\noak, slightly arched, and molded on their under-surface. Their position is\r\nindicated by dotted lines on the plan (fig. 38). The whole roof is a\r\nsplendid specimen of fifteenth century work, enriched with carving in the\r\nfinest style of execution. There is a bold ornament in the centre of each\r\ntiebeam; and at the foot of the central joist in each bay, which is wider\r\nthan the rest, and molded, while the others are plain, there is an angel,\r\nprojecting horizontally from the wall. The purlin, again, is molded, and\r\nwhere it intersects the central joist a subject is carved: an angel\r\nplaying on a musical instrument--a bird--a rose--a grotesque figure--and\r\nthe like. Below the wall-plate is a cornice, 12 in. deep, ornamented with\r\na row of quatrefoils above a row of battlements. Beneath these there is a\r\ngroove, which seems to indicate that the walls were once panelled or\r\nplastered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38. Plan of the Old Library, Lincoln Cathedral.]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that there was originally a row of equidistant windows in\r\nthe east and west walls, one to each bay on each side; but of these, if\r\nthey ever existed, no trace remains. There must also have been a window at\r\nthe north end, and probably one at the south end also. The present windows\r\nare plainly modern. The room is known to have suffered from a fire, which\r\ntradition assigns to 1609; and probably the original windows were changed\r\nduring the repairs rendered necessary at that time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40. Plan of the Cloister, etc., Lincoln Cathedral.]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to decide how this library was approached. It has been\r\nsuggested that the stone newel stair at the north-west corner of the\r\nChapter-House was used for this purpose; but, if that be the case, how are\r\nwe to explain the words in the above order \"the Stair Case thereto\r\nremoved\"; and an item which occurs in the Cathedral Accounts for 1789,\r\n\"taking down the old stairs, strings, and banisters, 14_s._\"? It appeared\r\nto me, when examining the building, that there had been originally a door\r\non the east side, now replaced by a window, as shewn on the plan (fig.\r\n38). Possibly the staircase destroyed in 1789 led to this door, which was\r\nconveniently situated in the centre of a bay. The staircase built in 1789\r\nis the one still existing at the north-east corner of the old library\r\n(fig. 40, A).\r\n\r\nAt Salisbury Bishop Osmund (1078-99) is stated to have \"got together a\r\nquantity of books, for he himself did not disdain either to write books or\r\nto bind them after they had been written\"[246]; but the library, as\r\nelsewhere, was a work of the fifteenth century. The foundation is very\r\nclearly recorded in an act of the Chapter, dated 15 January, 1444-45. The\r\nmembers present decide that as it is desirable, \"for divers reasons, to\r\nhave certain schools suitable for lectures, together with a library for\r\nthe safe keeping of books and the convenience of those who wish to study\r\ntherein--which library up to the present time they have been without--such\r\nschools and library shall be built as soon as possible over one side of\r\nthe cloister of the church, at the cost of William [Ayscough] now Bishop\r\nof Salisbury, the Dean, and the Canons of the aforesaid church[247].\"\r\nAccordingly, a building was erected, extending over the whole length of\r\nthe east cloister, conveniently approached by the staircase at the\r\nsouth-west corner of the south transept, which originally led only to the\r\nroof. This library was curtailed to its present dimensions, and otherwise\r\naltered, in consequence of a Chapter Order dated 25 November, 1758, part\r\nof which I proceed to quote:\r\n\r\n    That the southern part of the library be taken down as\r\n    far as the partitions within which the manuscripts are\r\n    placed, the whole being found much too heavy to be\r\n    properly supported by the Cloysters, which were never\r\n    designed originally to bear so great a weight.\r\n\r\n    That the roof of the northern part of the library (where\r\n    the Theological lecture antiently used to be given by\r\n    the Chancellor of the Church) be taken down; the walls\r\n    lowered, and a new and lighter roof be placed in its\r\n    room; and that the same be fitted up in a neat and\r\n    convenient manner for the reception of the present books\r\n    and any others which shall hereafter be added to them.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the library, as the execution of the above order left\r\nit, will be understood from the view (fig. 41), taken from the roof of an\r\nadjoining alley of the cloister. Internally the room is 66 feet long, 20\r\nfeet wide, and 12 ft. 9 in. high. It has a flat plaster ceiling, part of\r\nthe \"new and lighter roof\" imposed on the lowered walls in 1758. The\r\nfittings are wholly modern.\r\n\r\nThe library attached to S. Paul's Cathedral, London, by which I mean the\r\nmedieval cathedral commonly called Old S. Paul's, was in a similar\r\nposition. Its history is succinctly recorded by Dugdale. After describing\r\nthe cemetery called Pardon Church Hawgh, with the cloister that surrounded\r\nit, he proceeds:\r\n\r\n    _The Library._\r\n\r\n    Over the East quadrant of the before mentioned Cloyster,\r\n    was a fair _Library_ built, at the costs of _Walter\r\n    Shiryngton_, Chancelour of the Duchy of Lancaster in\r\n    King Henry the 6th's time: But in the year MDXLIX. 10.\r\n    _Apr._ both Chapell, Cloyster, and Monuments, excepting\r\n    onely that side where the _Library_ was, were pulled\r\n    down to the ground, by the appointment of _Edward_ Duke\r\n    of Somerset, then Lord Protector to King _Edward_ 6. and\r\n    the materialls carried into the Strand, towards the\r\n    building of that stately fabrick called Somerset-House,\r\n    which he then erected; the ground where they stood being\r\n    afterwards converted into a Garden, for the Pettie\r\n    Canons[248].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42. Plan of the Library in Wells Cathedral.\r\n\r\nScale 1/10 inch=1 foot.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41. Exterior of the Library at Salisbury Cathedral,\r\nlooking north-east.]\r\n\r\nNothing is known of the dimensions or arrangement of the above room; but,\r\nas it was over a cloister, it must have been long and narrow, like that\r\nwhich still exists in a similar position at Wells Cathedral, which I will\r\nbriefly mention next.\r\n\r\nThe Chapter Library at Wells Cathedral occupies the south end of a long,\r\nnarrow room over the east pane of the cloister, approached by a spiral\r\nstaircase from the south transept. This room is about 162 feet long by 12\r\nfeet wide; the portion assigned to the library is about 106 feet long\r\n(fig. 42). The roof was originally divided into 13 spaces by oak\r\nprincipals, very slightly arched, resting on stone corbels. There were two\r\nwindows on each side to each space. In the part fitted up as a library the\r\nprincipals have been plastered over to imitate stone, and the joists\r\nbetween them concealed by a ceiling. There is a tradition that this room\r\nwas fitted up as a library in 1472. The present fittings, which I shall\r\nhave occasion to mention in a subsequent chapter, were put up when the\r\nlibrary was refitted and stocked with books after the Restoration[249].\r\n\r\nThese four examples--at Lincoln, Salisbury, S. Paul's, and Wells--are\r\ntypical of Cathedral libraries built over a cloister. I will next notice\r\nsome that were detached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43. Plan of the Library at Lichfield Cathedral.\r\n\r\nFrom _History and Antiquities of Staffordshire_, by Stebbing Shaw, fol.\r\nLond. 1798, Vol. 11. p. 244.]\r\n\r\nThe library of Lichfield Cathedral[250] stood on the north side of the\r\ncathedral, west of the north door, at some little distance from the church\r\n(fig. 43). It was begun in 1489, when Thomas Heywood, dean, \"gave L40\r\ntowards building a library of brick,\" and completed in 1493. It was about\r\n60 feet long by 15 feet wide, approached by a flight of stairs. As the\r\nChapter Order (9 December, 1757) which authorised its destruction speaks\r\nof the \"Library, Chapter Clerk's House, and Cloisters,\" I suspect that it\r\nstood on a colonnade, after the manner of the beautiful structure at\r\nNoyon, a cathedral town in eastern France, at no great distance from\r\nAmiens.\r\n\r\nThis library--which I have carefully examined on two occasions--was built\r\nin pursuance of the following Order of the Chapter, 16 November, 1506.\r\n\r\n    Le 16. iour de Nouembre audit an, l'affaire de la\r\n    Librairie se remet sus. Le sieur Doyen offre cent francs\r\n    pour cet oeuure. Et le 20. iour de Nouembre, ouy le\r\n    Maistre de Fabrique et Commissaires a ce deputez, fut\r\n    arrestee le long de l'allee qui meine de l'Eglise a la\r\n    porte Corbaut; et a cet effect sera tire le bois a ce\r\n    necessaire de nos forests, et se fera ladite Librairie\r\n    suiuant le pourtrait ou patron exhibe au Chapitre le\r\n    sixiesme iour de Mars 1506. Le Bailly de Chapitre donne\r\n    cent sols pour ce bastiment, a condition qu'il en aura\r\n    une clef[251].\r\n\r\nThis library (fig. 44) is, so far as I know, an unique specimen of a\r\nlibrary built wholly of wood, supported on wooden pillars with stone\r\nbases, so that it is raised about 10 feet above the stone floor on which\r\nthey rest, probably for the sake of dryness. There is a legend that a\r\nmarket used to be held there; but at present the spaces between the\r\npillars have been filled in on the south side. The one here represented\r\n(fig. 45) stands on the north side, in a small yard between the library\r\nand the cathedral.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44. Chapter-Library at Noyon, France.]\r\n\r\nThe site selected for the building is on the south side of the choir of\r\nthe cathedral, with its longest axis north and south. It measures 72 feet\r\nin length by 17 feet in width between walls, but was originally longer, a\r\npiece having been cut off at the south end, where the entrance now is, and\r\nwhere the library is now terminated by a stone wall of classical\r\ncharacter. Tradition places the entrance at the opposite end, by means of\r\nan external staircase; an arrangement which would have been more\r\nconvenient for the members of the Chapter, as they could have approached\r\nit through their vestry, which is on the south side of the choir. There\r\nare now nine windows on the east side--originally there were at least ten;\r\nbut none on the west side, and it is doubtful if there ever were any, as\r\nthey would be rendered useless by the proximity of other structures. The\r\nfittings are modern and without interest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 45. A single pillar of the cloister beneath the\r\nChapter Library at Noyon.]\r\n\r\nAt Bayeux also the Chapter-library is a detached building--of stone, in\r\ntwo floors, about 40 feet long by 26 feet wide, but I have not been able\r\nto discover the date at which it was built; and at York a detached library\r\nwas built 1421-22 at the south-west corner of the south transept. This\r\nbuilding, in two floors, the upper of which appears to have held the\r\nbooks, is still in existence.\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral library at Troyes, built by Bishop Louis Raguier between\r\n1477 and 1479, to replace an older structure, was in an unusual position,\r\nand arranged in an unusual manner. It abutted against the south-east angle\r\nof the south transept, from which it could be entered. It was nearly\r\nsquare, being 30 feet long by 24 feet broad; and the vault was supported\r\non a central pillar, from which radiated the six desks which contained the\r\nbooks (fig. 46). It was called _La Theologale_, because lectures on\r\ntheology were given in it, as in the library at Salisbury. The desks were\r\ntaken down in 1706, and the whole structure swept away in 1841-42, by the\r\nDepartmental Architect, in the course of \"a thorough restoration[252].\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 46. Plan of the Library at the south-east angle of the\r\nsouth transept of the Cathedral at Troyes.\r\n\r\nA, B, C, D, Library; E, Entrance from vestibule in front of south transept\r\ndoor. The room on the east side of this passage was used to keep records\r\nin.]\r\n\r\nAt this point I cannot refrain from mentioning a somewhat anomalous\r\nlibrary-foundation at Worcester, due to the zeal of Bishop Carpenter\r\n(1444-76), though both structure and foundation have been long since swept\r\naway[253]. In 1464 he built and endowed a library in connexion with the\r\ncharnel-house or chapel of S. Thomas, martyr, a detached building on the\r\nnorth side of the cathedral. The deed in which this foundation is recorded\r\ncontains so many interesting particulars that I will state briefly the\r\nmost important points insisted upon[254].\r\n\r\nThe Bishop begins by stating that by ancient arrangement the sacrist of\r\nthe cathedral, assisted by a chaplain, is bound to celebrate mass daily in\r\nthe charnel-house or chapel aforesaid, to keep it in repair, and to supply\r\nit with ornaments and vestments. For this purpose an annual endowment of\r\n15 marks has been provided. He then describes his own foundation.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the intention of his predecessors, and actuated by a\r\ndesire to increase the knowledge of our holy faith, he has built a library\r\nin the aforesaid charnel-house, and caused certain books to be chained\r\ntherein. Further, lest these volumes should be left uncared for, and so be\r\ndamaged or abstracted, he has caused a dwelling-house for a master or\r\nkeeper of the said books to be erected at the end of the said library; and\r\nhe has conferred on the said keeper a new stipend, in addition to the old\r\nstipend of 15 marks.\r\n\r\nThis keeper must be a graduate in theology, and a good preacher. He is to\r\nlive in the said chantry, and say mass daily in the chapel thereof. He is\r\nto take care of all the books in the library, which he is to open on every\r\nweek-day for two hours before None, and for two hours after None, to all\r\nwho wish to enter for the purpose of study. He is to explain hard and\r\ndoubtful passages of scripture when asked to do so, and once in every week\r\nto deliver a public lecture in the library. Moreover on Holy Thursday he\r\nis to preach in the cathedral, or at the cross in the burial-ground.\r\n\r\nFurther, in order to prevent any book being alienated, or carried away, or\r\nstolen from the library, a tripartite list of all the books is to be made,\r\nwherein the true value of each is to be set down. One of these lists is\r\nto be retained by the Bishop, another by the sacrist, and a third by the\r\nkeeper. Whenever a book is bequeathed or given to the library it is to be\r\nat once set down in this list together with its true value.\r\n\r\nOn the Friday after the feast of Relics (27 January) in each year, the\r\nsacrist and the keeper are carefully to compare the books with the list;\r\nand should any book have disappeared from the library through the\r\ncarelessness of the keeper, he is to replace it or the value of it within\r\none month, under a penalty of forty shillings, whereof twenty shillings is\r\nto be paid to the Bishop, and twenty shillings to the sacrist. When the\r\naforesaid month has fully expired, the sacrist is to set apart out of his\r\nown salary a sum sufficient to pay the above fine, and to purchase and\r\nchain in the library as soon as possible another book of the same value\r\nand material.\r\n\r\nThe keeper is to receive from the sacrist an annual salary of ten pounds,\r\nand four yards of woollen cloth to make him a gown and hood.\r\n\r\nThe sacrist is to keep the chapel, library, books, and chains, together\r\nwith the house built for the use of the keeper, in good repair; and he is,\r\nmoreover, to find and maintain the vestments and lights required for the\r\nchapel. All these duties he is to swear on the Holy Gospels that he will\r\nfaithfully perform.\r\n\r\nMy enumeration of Cathedral libraries would be sadly incomplete if I did\r\nnot say a few words about the splendid structure which is attached to the\r\nCathedral of Rouen[255]. The Chapter possessed a respectable collection of\r\nbooks at so early a date as 1120; this grew, and, 29 July, 1424, it was\r\ndecided to build \"a study or library (_quoddam studium seu vnam\r\nlibrariam_),\" which was completed in 1428. Fifty years afterwards--in\r\n1477--it was decided that the library should be extended. The first\r\nthought of the Chapter was that it should be built of wood, and the\r\npurchase of good stout timber (_bona et grossa ligna_) is ordered. This\r\nplan, however, was evidently abandoned almost as soon as it was formed,\r\nfor two years afterwards (20 April 1479) \"the library lately erected\" is\r\nmentioned. These words can only refer to the existing structure which is\r\nbuilt wholly of stone. A week later (28 April) William Pontis,\r\nmaster-mason, was asked to prepare a design for a staircase up to the\r\nlibrary. This he supplied on the following day. In June of the same year\r\nthe Chapter had a serious difference of opinion with him on the ground\r\nthat he had altered the design and exceeded the estimate. They came,\r\nhowever, to the wise conclusion that he should go on with the work and be\r\nrequested to finish it with all dispatch.\r\n\r\nIn the following spring (20 March 1480) it was decided to prolong the\r\nlibrary as far as the street; and in 1481 (18 September) to build the\r\nbeautiful stone gate surmounted by a screen in open-work through which the\r\ncourt is now entered. This was completed by the end of 1482. The whole\r\nstructure had therefore occupied about five years in building.\r\n\r\nThe library, together with a building of older date next to the Cathedral\r\nwhich serves as a sort of vestibule to it, occupies the west side of what\r\nis still called, from the booksellers' shops which used to stand there,\r\n_La Cour des Libraires_. The whole building measures 105 ft. in length, by\r\n25 ft. in breadth. The library proper is lighted by six windows in the\r\neast wall, and by two windows in the north wall. The masonry of the wall\r\nunder these windows and the two lancets by which it is pierced indicate\r\nthat advantage had been taken of an earlier building to form the\r\nsubstructure of the library. The west wall must always have been blank.\r\nAccess to the library was obtained directly from the transept by means of\r\nthe beautiful stone staircase in two flights which Pontis built in 1479.\r\nThis staircase leads up to a door marked BIBLIOTHECA which opens into the\r\nvestibule above mentioned. In 1788 a room was built over the library to\r\ncontain the archives of the church, and the staircase was then ingeniously\r\nprolonged so as to reach the new second-floor.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the minutes of the Chapter tell us nothing about the\r\noriginal fittings of this room[256]. In 1718 the books were kept in\r\ncupboards protected by wire-work, over which were the portraits of\r\nbenefactors to the library[257].\r\n\r\nAt present the archives have disappeared; the few books that remain have\r\nreplaced them in the upper storey, and the library is used as a second\r\nvestry. The illustration (fig. 47) shews the interior of the _Cour des\r\nLibraires_, with the beautiful gate of entrance from the street. The\r\nlibrary occupies the first floor. Beneath are the arches under which the\r\nshops used to be arranged; and above is the library of 1788.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 47.

ANALYSIS OF SOME LIBRARY-STATUTES. MONASTIC INFLUENCE AT THE\r\nUNIVERSITIES. NUMBER OF BOOKS OWNED BY COLLEGES. THE COLLEGIATE LIBRARY.\r\nBISHOP COBHAM'S LIBRARY AT OXFORD. LIBRARY AT QUEENS' COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE.\r\nAT ZUTPHEN. THE LECTERN SYSTEM. CHAINING OF BOOKS. FURTHER EXAMPLES AND\r\nILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow were the libraries mentioned in the preceding chapter fitted up? For\r\ninstance, what manner of bookcases did Archbishop Chichele put into his\r\nlibrary at Canterbury in 1414, or the \"bons ouvriers subtilz et plains de\r\nsens\" supply to the Abbat of Clairvaux in 1496? The primitive book-presses\r\nhave long ago been broken up; and the medieval devices that succeeded them\r\nhave had no better fate. This dearth of material need not, however,\r\ndiscourage us. We have, I think, the means of discovering with tolerable\r\ncertainty what monastic fittings must have been, by comparing the\r\nbookcases which still exist in a more or less perfect form in the\r\nlibraries of Oxford and Cambridge with such monastic catalogues as give\r\nparticulars of arrangement and not merely lists of books.\r\n\r\nThe collegiate system was in no sense monastic, indeed it was to a certain\r\nextent established to counteract monastic influence; but it is absurd to\r\nsuppose that the younger communities would borrow nothing from the\r\nelder--especially when we reflect that the monastic system, as inaugurated\r\nby S. Benedict, had completed at least seven centuries of successful\r\nexistence before Walter de Merton was moved to found a college, and that\r\nmany of the subsequent founders of colleges were more or less closely\r\nconnected with monasteries. Further, as we have seen that study was\r\nspecially enjoined upon monks by S. Benedict, it is precisely in the\r\ndirection of study that we might expect to find features common to the two\r\nsets of communities. And, in fact, an examination of the statutes\r\naffecting the library in the codes imposed upon some of the earlier\r\ncolleges at Oxford and Cambridge, leads us irresistibly to the conclusion\r\nthat they were derived from monastic Customs, using the word in its\r\ntechnical sense, and monastic practice. The resemblances are too striking\r\nto be accidental.\r\n\r\nI shall therefore, in the next place, review, as briefly as I can, the\r\nstatutes of some of the above colleges, taking them in chronological\r\norder[258]; and I shall translate some passages from them.\r\n\r\nBut first let me mention that the principle of lending books to students\r\nunder a pledge was accepted by the University of Oxford many years before\r\ncolleges were founded. It is recorded that Roger L'Isle, Dean of York, in\r\nthe early part of the thirteenth century, \"bestowed several exemplars of\r\nthe holy Bible to be used by the Scholars of Oxford under a pledge\"; that\r\nthe said books, with others, were \"locked up in chests, or chained upon\r\ndesks in S. Mary's Chancel and Church to be used by the Masters upon leave\r\nfirst obtained\"; that certain officers were appointed to keep the keys of\r\nthese chests, and to receive the pledges from those that borrowed the\r\nbooks; and that the books were so kept \"till the library over the\r\nCongregation House was built, and then being taken out, were set up in\r\npews or studies digested according to Faculties, chained, and had a keeper\r\nappointed over them[259].\"\r\n\r\nIn the statutes of Merton College, Oxford, 1274, the teacher of grammar\r\n(_grammaticus_) is to be supplied with a sufficient number of books out of\r\nthe funds of the House, but no other mention of books occurs therein[260].\r\nThe explanatory ordinances, however, given in 1276 by Robert Kilwardby\r\n(Archbishop of Canterbury 1273-79), direct that the books of the community\r\nare to be kept under three locks, and to be assigned by the warden and\r\nsub-warden to the use of the Fellows under sufficient pledge[261]. In the\r\nsecond statutes of University College (1292), it is provided, \"that no\r\nFellow shall alienate, sell, pawn, hire, lett, or grant, any House, Rent,\r\nMoney, Book, or other Thing, without the Consent of all the Fellows\"; and\r\nfurther, with special reference to the Library:\r\n\r\n    Every Book of the House, now given, or hereafter to be\r\n    given, shall have a high value set upon it when it is\r\n    borrowed, in order that he that has it may be more\r\n    fearful lest he lose it; and let it be lent by an\r\n    Indenture, whereof one part is to be kept in the common\r\n    Chest, and the other with him that has the Book: And let\r\n    no Book, belonging to the House, be lent out of the\r\n    College, without a Pawn better (than the Book), and this\r\n    with the Consent of all the Fellows.\r\n\r\n    Let there be put one Book of every Sort that the House\r\n    has, in some common and secure Place; that the Fellows,\r\n    and others with the Consent of a Fellow, may for the\r\n    Future have the Benefit of it.\r\n\r\n    Every Opponent in Theology, or Reader of the Sentences,\r\n    or a Regent that commonly reads (_regens et legens\r\n    communiter_), when he wants it, shall have any necessary\r\n    Book, that the House has, lent to him Gratis; and when\r\n    he has done with it, let him restore it to that Fellow,\r\n    who had formerly made choice of it[262].\r\n\r\nThe statutes of Oriel College, dated 1329, lay down the following rules\r\nfor the management of books:\r\n\r\n    The common books (_communes libri_) of the House are to\r\n    be brought out and inspected once a year, on the feast\r\n    of the Commemoration of Souls [2 November], in presence\r\n    of the Provost or his deputy, and of the Scholars\r\n    [Fellows].\r\n\r\n    Every one of them in turn, in order of seniority, may\r\n    select a single book which either treats of the science\r\n    to which he is devoting himself, or which he requires\r\n    for his use. This he may keep, if he please, until the\r\n    same festival in the succeeding year, when a similar\r\n    selection of books is to take place, and so on, from\r\n    year to year.\r\n\r\n    If there should happen to be more books than persons,\r\n    those that remain are to be selected in the same\r\n    manner[263].\r\n\r\nThe last clause plainly shews how small the number of the books must have\r\nbeen when the statute was written. Their safety was subsequently secured\r\nby an ordinance of the Provost and Scholars, which, by decree of the\r\nVisitor, dated 13 May, 1441, received the authority of a statute. The high\r\nvalue set upon the books is shewn by the extreme stringency of the\r\npenalties imposed for wilful loss or failure of restitution. After\r\ndescribing the annual assemblage of the Provost and Fellows, as directed\r\nin the former statute, the new enactment proceeds as follows:\r\n\r\n    Any person who absents himself on that day, so that the\r\n    books selected by him are neither produced nor restored;\r\n    or who, being present, refuses to produce or to restore\r\n    them; or who refuses to pay the full value, if, without\r\n    any fraud or deception on his part, it should happen\r\n    that any one of them be missing; is to be deprived of\r\n    all right of selecting books for that year; and any\r\n    person who wittingly defers the aforesaid production or\r\n    restitution till Christmas next ensuing, shall, _ipso\r\n    facto_, cease to be a Fellow.\r\n\r\n    Further, any scholar who has pawned or alienated,\r\n    contrary to the common consent of the college, any book\r\n    or object of value (_jocale_) belonging to the college;\r\n    or who has even suggested, helped, or favoured, such\r\n    pawning or alienation, shall, _ipso facto_, cease to be\r\n    a member of the Society[264].\r\n\r\nThe statutes of Peterhouse, Cambridge, dated 1344, class the books of the\r\nSociety with the charters and the muniments, and prescribe the following\r\nrules for their safe custody:\r\n\r\n    In order that the books which are the common property of\r\n    the House (_communes libri_), the charters, and the\r\n    muniments, may be kept in safe custody, we appoint and\r\n    ordain that an indenture be drawn up of the whole of\r\n    them in the presence of at least the major part of the\r\n    scholars, expressing what the books are, and to what\r\n    faculty they belong; of which indenture one part is to\r\n    be deposited with the Master, the other with the Deans,\r\n    as a record of the transaction.\r\n\r\n    The aforesaid books, charters, and muniments are to be\r\n    placed in one or more common chests, each having two\r\n    locks, one key of which shall for greater security be\r\n    deposited with the Master, the other with the Senior\r\n    Dean, who shall cause the books to be distributed to\r\n    those scholars who have need of them, in the manner\r\n    which has been more fully set forth in the section which\r\n    treats of the office of the Deans[265].\r\n\r\nThe section referred to prescribes that the Deans\r\n\r\n    are to distribute them [the books] to the scholars in\r\n    such manner as shall appear to them expedient; and\r\n    further, they shall, if they think proper, make each\r\n    scholar take an oath that he will not alienate any book\r\n    so borrowed, but will take all possible care of it, and\r\n    restore it to the Master and Dean, at the expiration of\r\n    the appointed time[266].\r\n\r\nIn 1473 Dr John Warkworth became Master. He was evidently a lover of\r\nbooks, for he gave to the Library fifty-five volumes, which he protected,\r\nafter the fashion of an earlier age, by invoking a curse upon him who\r\nshould alienate them. Moreover, during his Mastership, in 1480, the\r\nCollege enacted or adopted a special statute headed, _De libris Collegii_,\r\nwhich may be thus translated:\r\n\r\n    In the name of God, Amen. As books are the most precious\r\n    treasure of scholars, concerning which there ought to be\r\n    the most diligent care and forethought, lest, as\r\n    heretofore, they fall to decay or be lost, it is hereby\r\n    appointed, settled, and ordained, by the Master and\r\n    Fellows of the House or College of S. Peter in\r\n    Cambridge, that no book which has been chained in the\r\n    library there shall be taken away from, or removed out\r\n    of, the library, except by special assent and consent of\r\n    the Master and all the resident Fellows of the aforesaid\r\n    College--it being understood that by resident Fellows a\r\n    majority of the whole Society is meant.\r\n\r\n    Provided always that no book which has been given to the\r\n    library on condition of being kept perpetually chained\r\n    therein shall, by virtue of this statute, be on any\r\n    pretence removed from it, except only when it needs\r\n    repair.\r\n\r\n    Provided also that every book in the library which is to\r\n    be selected and distributed shall have a certain value\r\n    set upon it by the Master and the two Deans, and that\r\n    indentures shall be drawn up recording the same.\r\n\r\n    Once in every two years, in the Michaelmas Term, a fresh\r\n    selection and distribution shall be held of every book\r\n    which is not chained in the Library--the precise day to\r\n    be fixed by the Master and the Senior Dean.\r\n\r\n    No book so selected and distributed shall pass the night\r\n    out of College, except by permission of the Master and\r\n    the President and the other Dean who is not President;\r\n    provided always that the said book be not kept out of\r\n    the College for six months in succession.\r\n\r\n    If it should happen that a given book be not brought in\r\n    and produced on the aforesaid day of fresh selection and\r\n    distribution, then the person who is responsible for it\r\n    shall pay to the Master, or in his absence to the Senior\r\n    Dean, the full value of the said absent book, under pain\r\n    of being put out of commons until it be restored.\r\n\r\n    Every Fellow who is not present on the aforesaid day\r\n    shall appoint a deputy, who shall be prepared to bring\r\n    in any books which may have been lent to him, on the day\r\n    when a fresh distribution is to take place, under pain\r\n    of being put out of commons[267].\r\n\r\nThe statutes given in 1350 to Trinity Hall, Cambridge, by the Founder\r\nWilliam Bateman (Bishop of Norwich 1344-56), contain rules which are more\r\nstringent than those already quoted, and were evidently written in\r\ncontemplation of a more considerable collection of volumes. A list of the\r\nbooks which he himself presented to Trinity Hall is appended to his\r\nstatutes, and a special chapter (_De libris collegii_) is allotted to the\r\nLibrary. This may be translated as follows:\r\n\r\n    On the days appointed for the general audit of accounts\r\n    [in the Michaelmas and Easter Terms] all the books which\r\n    have been received, or shall be received in future,\r\n    either from our own liberality, or from the pious\r\n    largess of others, are to be laid out separately before\r\n    the Master and all the resident Fellows in such manner\r\n    that each volume may be clearly seen; by which\r\n    arrangement it will become evident twice in each year\r\n    whether any book has been lost or taken away.\r\n\r\n    No book belonging to the aforesaid College may ever at\r\n    any time be sold, given away, exchanged, or alienated,\r\n    under any excuse or pretext; nor may it be lent to\r\n    anybody except a member of the College; nor may it be\r\n    entrusted in quires, for the purpose of making a copy,\r\n    to any member of the College, or to any stranger, either\r\n    within the precincts of the Hall or beyond them; nor may\r\n    it be carried by the Master, or any one else, out of the\r\n    Town of Cambridge, or out of the aforesaid Hall or\r\n    Hostel, either whole or in quires, except to the\r\n    Schools; provided always that no book pass the night out\r\n    of College, unless it be necessary to bind it or to\r\n    repair it; and when this happens, it is to be brought\r\n    back to College as soon as possible after the completion\r\n    of the binding or the repair.\r\n\r\n    Moreover, all the books of the College are to be kept in\r\n    some safe room, to be assigned for the College Library,\r\n    so that all the Scholars of the College may have common\r\n    access to them. We give leave, however, that the poor\r\n    scholars of the college may have the loan of books\r\n    containing the texts of Canon and Civil Law for their\r\n    private use for a certain time, to be fixed at the\r\n    discretion of the Master and the three Senior Fellows,\r\n    provided they be not taken out of College; but the books\r\n    of the Doctors of Civil and Canon Law are to remain\r\n    continuously in the said Library Chamber, fastened with\r\n    iron chains for the common use of the Fellows[268].\r\n\r\nIt is evident that this statute was regarded as a full and satisfactory\r\nexpression of what was required, for it is repeated, with additions or\r\nomissions to suit the taste of the respective founders, in the statutes of\r\nNew College (1400), All Souls' (1443), Magdalen (1479), Corpus Christi\r\n(1517), Brasenose (1521), Cardinal College (1527) and S. John's College\r\n(1555), at Oxford; and in those of King's College, Cambridge.\r\n\r\nAmong these changes a few are sufficiently important to require special\r\nnotice. At New College William of Wykeham allows students in civil law and\r\ncanon law to keep two text-books \"for their own special use during the\r\nwhole time they devote themselves to those faculties in our College,\r\nprovided they do not possess such books of their own\"; the \"remaining\r\ntext-books, should any be left over, and also the glosses or commentaries\r\nof the Doctors of civil and canon law, may be lent to the persons\r\nbelonging to those faculties by the method of annual selection, as in the\r\nother faculties\"; the \"books which remain unassigned after the Fellows\r\nhave made their selection are to be fastened with iron chains, and remain\r\nin the Common Library for the use of the Fellows[269]\"; the wishes of\r\ndonors, whether expressed by will or during their lifetime, are to be\r\nrespected; and, lastly, the safety of the Library is to be secured by\r\nthree locks, two large, and one small, of the kind called \"a clickett.\"\r\nThe keys of the two former are to be kept by the Senior Dean and the\r\nBursar respectively; of the clickett each Fellow is to have a separate\r\nkey. At night the door is to be carefully locked with all three keys[270].\r\n\r\nAt All Souls' College, the founder, Henry Chichele (Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury 1414-43), makes the books to be chained the subjects of\r\ndefinite choice. The principle of an annual selection is maintained,\r\nexcept for \"those books which, in obedience to the will of the donors, or\r\nthe injunction of the Warden, the Vice-Warden, and the Deans, are to be\r\nchained for the common use of the Fellows and Scholars.\" Further, the\r\npreparation of a catalogue is specially enjoined. Every book is to be\r\nentered in a register by the first word of the second leaf, and every book\r\ngiven to the Library is to bear the name of the donor on the second leaf,\r\nor in some other convenient position. The books are to be inspected once\r\nin every year, after which the distribution, as provided for by Bateman\r\nand Wykeham, is to take place. Each Fellow who borrows a book is to have a\r\nsmall indenture drawn up containing the title according to the first word\r\nof the second leaf, and an acknowledgment that he has received it. These\r\nsmall indentures are to be left in charge of the Warden, or, in his\r\nabsence, of the Vice-Warden[271].\r\n\r\nIn the statutes of Magdalen College, the founder, William Waynflete\r\n(Bishop of Winchester 1447-87), maintains the provisions of Wykeham and\r\nChichele, but introduces an injunction of his own, to the effect that\r\nevery Fellow or Scholar who uses the Library is to shut the book he has\r\nconsulted before he leaves and also the windows; and the last to use the\r\nLibrary at night is to go through the whole room and see that all the\r\nwindows are shut and not to leave the door open--under a severe\r\npenalty[272].\r\n\r\nAt Corpus Christi College, the founder, Richard Fox (Bishop of Winchester\r\n1501-28), insists upon safeguards against the indiscriminate chaining, of\r\nbooks:\r\n\r\n    No book is to be brought into the Library or chained\r\n    there, unless it be of suitable value and utility, or\r\n    unless the will of the donor have so directed; and none\r\n    is to be taken out of it, unless it so happen that there\r\n    be there already a considerable number on the same\r\n    subject, or that another copy in better condition and of\r\n    greater value, to take its place, have been presented by\r\n    some benefactor.\r\n\r\n    By this means those books which are of greater value, or\r\n    which contain material of greater utility to students in\r\n    each Faculty, will be stored up in the Library; while\r\n    those which are not fit for the Library, or of which a\r\n    sufficient number of copies already exist in it, may be\r\n    distributed to the Fellows of the College, according to\r\n    the system of indentures between the borrower and the\r\n    President, or in his absence the Vice-President, or one\r\n    of the Deans[273].\r\n\r\nThe Bishop was evidently afraid that the Library should be overcrowded,\r\nfor he even allows books to be sold, in the event of their becoming so\r\nnumerous as to be no longer of use to the Fellows for the purpose of being\r\nborrowed.\r\n\r\nLastly I will translate the following College Order or Statute which was\r\nin force at Pembroke College, Cambridge. Unfortunately it is without date,\r\nbut from internal evidence may take rank with some of the earliest\r\nenactments already quoted.\r\n\r\n    Let there be in the aforesaid House a Keeper of the\r\n    Books, who shall take under his charge all the books\r\n    belonging to the community, and once in each year,\r\n    namely on the feast of the Translation of S. Thomas the\r\n    Martyr [7 July], or at the latest within the eight days\r\n    immediately following, let him render to the community\r\n    an account of the same, by exhibiting each book in order\r\n    to the Master and Fellows.\r\n\r\n    The inspection having been made, after the Fellows have\r\n    deliberated, let him distribute them to each Fellow in\r\n    proportion to his requirements. And let the said Keeper\r\n    have ready large pieces of board (_tabulas magnas_),\r\n    covered with wax and parchment, that the titles of the\r\n    books may be written on the parchment, and the names of\r\n    the Fellows who hold them on the wax beside it. When\r\n    they have brought their books back, their names shall be\r\n    erased, and their responsibility for the books shall\r\n    come to an end, the keeper remaining liable. So shall he\r\n    never be in ignorance about any book or its borrower.\r\n\r\n    No book is to be taken away or lent out of the House on\r\n    any pretext whatever, except upon some occasion which\r\n    may appear justifiable to the major part of the\r\n    community; and then, if any book be lent, let a proper\r\n    pledge be taken for it which shall be honourably\r\n    exhibited to the Keeper[274].\r\n\r\nLet us consider, in the next place, what points of library-management have\r\nbeen brought into the most prominent relief by the above analysis of\r\nCollege statutes. We find that the \"Common Books\" of the House--by which\r\nphrase the books intended for the common use of the inmates are meant--are\r\nplaced on the same footing as the charters, muniments, and valuables\r\n(_jocalia_). They are to be kept in a chest or chests secured by two or\r\nthree locks requiring the presence of the same number of officials to open\r\nthem. These volumes may not be borrowed indiscriminately, but each Scholar\r\n(Fellow) may choose the book he wants, and write a formal acknowledgment\r\nthat he has received it, and that he is bound to restore it or pay the\r\nvalue of it, under a severe penalty. Once a year the whole collection is\r\nto be audited in the presence of the Master of the College and all the\r\nFellows, when a fresh distribution is to be made. The books not so\r\nborrowed are to be put in \"some common and secure place\"; an arrangement\r\nwhich was subsequently developed into a selection of books required for\r\nreference, and the chaining of them in \"the Library Chamber for the common\r\nuse of the Fellows.\"\r\n\r\nThe Register of Merton College, Oxford, contains many interesting entries\r\nwhich shew that these directions respecting the choice and loan of books\r\nwere faithfully observed. I will translate a few of them[275]:\r\n\r\n    On the twenty-fourth day of October [1483] choice was\r\n    made of the books on philosophy by the Fellows studying\r\n    philosophy.\r\n\r\n    On the eleventh day of November [1483], in the Warden's\r\n    lodging, choice was made of the books on theology by the\r\n    Fellows studying theology[276].\r\n\r\n    On the eighteenth day of March [1497] choice of books on\r\n    logic was held in the Common Hall[277].\r\n\r\nThe next entry is particularly valuable, as it proves that all the books\r\non a given subject, no matter how numerous, were occasionally distributed:\r\n\r\n    On the twenty-sixth day of the same month [August, 1500]\r\n    choice was made of the books on philosophy. It was found\r\n    that there were in all 349 books, which were then\r\n    distributed among the Fellows studying philosophy[278].\r\n\r\nIn 1498 (14 December) the Warden wished to borrow a book from the\r\nlibrary, whereupon a record of the following formalities was drawn\r\nup[279]:\r\n\r\n    On the same day a book of College Orders (on the second\r\n    leaf _ter posita_) was taken out of the library with the\r\n    consent of all the Fellows. And leave was given to the\r\n    Warden, in the presence of the four senior Fellows, to\r\n    make use of it for a season. As a caution for this book\r\n    the aforesaid Warden deposited a certain other book,\r\n    viz. S. Jerome's commentary on Matthew and the Epistles\r\n    of Paul (on the second leaf _sunt_). This book lay in\r\n    our possession as caution for the other book of College\r\n    Orders[280]; but, because this book was an insufficient\r\n    caution, there was deposited with it as a supplementary\r\n    caution another book, namely: Jerome on Isaiah,\r\n    Jeremiah, and Ezekiel.\r\n\r\nThe Warden kept the book for a year, at the expiration of which we find\r\nthe following entry[281]:\r\n\r\n    On the last day but one of the same month [1499] the\r\n    Warden returned to the Vice-Warden the book of College\r\n    Orders (on the second leaf _ter posita_) which he had\r\n    had out of the library for his own use for a season on\r\n    depositing a sufficient caution.\r\n\r\n    Whereupon the Vice-Warden returned to him his cautions,\r\n    namely, the commentary of S. Jerome on Matthew (second\r\n    leaf _sunt_), and another, namely, S. Jerome's\r\n    exposition of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel (second\r\n    leaf, _Audi cela_).\r\n\r\nLastly, I will quote a record of the solemn reception of a gift to the\r\nlibrary:\r\n\r\n    On the same day [2 August, 1493] a handsome book was\r\n    given to the College through John Godehew, Bachelor, by\r\n    two venerable men, Robert Aubrey and Robert Feyld, to be\r\n    chained in the common library of the House for the\r\n    perpetual use of those studying in it. It is Hugh of\r\n    Vienne on the Apocalypse, on the second leaf _quod\r\n    possessio eius_. Let us therefore pray for them[282].\r\n\r\nThese provisions savour of the cloister. The \"common books\" represent the\r\n\"common press (_armarium commune_)\" with which we are so familiar there;\r\nthe double or triple locks with which the book-chests are secured recall\r\nthe rules for safeguarding the said press; the annual audit and\r\ndistribution of books is directed in Lanfranc's statutes for English\r\nBenedictines; the borrowing under a pledge, or at least after an entry\r\nmade by the Librarian on his roll of the name of the book and the name of\r\nthe brother who borrowed it, was universal in monasteries; and the setting\r\napart of certain books in a separate room to which access was readily\r\npermitted became a necessity in the larger and more literary Houses.\r\nLastly, the commemoration of donors of books is specially enjoined by the\r\nAugustinians[283].\r\n\r\nThis close similarity between monastic and secular rules need not surprise\r\nus. I have shewn in the preceding chapter how faithfully the Benedictine\r\nrules for study were obeyed by all the Monastic Orders; and I know not\r\nfrom what other source directions for library-management could have been\r\nobtained. Besides, in some cases the authors of the rules which I have\r\nbeen considering must themselves have had experience of monastic\r\nlibraries. Walter de Merton is said to have been educated in an\r\nAugustinian Priory at Merton; Hugh de Balsham, founder of Peterhouse, was\r\nBishop of Ely; William Bateman, whose library-statute was so widely\r\napplied, had been educated in the Benedictine Priory at Norwich, and his\r\nbrother was an abbat; Henry Chichele was Archbishop of Canterbury, where,\r\nas I have shewn, a very extensive collection of books had been got\r\ntogether, to contain which worthily he himself built a library.\r\n\r\nSecondly, monastic influence was brought directly to bear on both\r\nUniversities through student-monks; and at Oxford, which was specially\r\nselected as the University for monastic colleges, the Benedictines founded\r\nGloucester House, now Worcester College, so early as 1283. This college\r\nhad a library, on the south side of the chapel, which was built and\r\nstocked with books at the sole charge of John Whethamstede, Abbat of S.\r\nAlbans[284]--whose work in connexion with the library of that House has\r\nbeen already recorded[285]. Durham College, maintained by the Benedictines\r\nof Durham, was supplied with books from the mother-house, lists of which\r\nhave been preserved[286]; and subsequently a library was built there to\r\ncontain the collection bequeathed in 1345 by Richard de Bury (Bishop of\r\nDurham 1333-45)[287]. Lastly, Leland tells us that at Canterbury College\r\nin the same University the whole furniture of the library (_tota\r\nbibliothecae supellex_) was transferred from the House of Christ Church,\r\nCanterbury[288]. It is, I submit, quite inconceivable that the fittings\r\nsupplied to these libraries could have been different from those commonly\r\nused in the monasteries of S. Albans, Durham, and Canterbury.\r\n\r\nFurther, it should be noted that the erection of a library proper was an\r\nafterthought in many of the older colleges, as it had been in the\r\nmonasteries. For instance, at Merton College, Oxford, founded 1264, the\r\nlibrary was not begun till 1377; at University College, founded 1280, in\r\n1440; at Balliol College, founded 1282, in 1431; at Oriel College, founded\r\n1324, in 1444; at Pembroke College, Cambridge, founded 1347, in 1452.\r\nWilliam of Wykeham, who founded New College, Oxford, in 1380, was the\r\nfirst to include a library in his quadrangle; and, after the example had\r\nbeen set by him, the plan of every subsequent college includes a library\r\nof sufficient dimensions to last till the Reformation, if not till the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nThe above dates, covering as they do at least two-thirds of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, shew that the collegiate libraries were being built at the same\r\ntime as the monastic. This coincidence of date, taken in conjunction with\r\nthe coincidences in enactment which I have already pointed out, seems to\r\nme to supply an additional argument in support of my theory that the\r\ninternal fittings of collegiate and monastic libraries would be identical.\r\nBesides, no forms are so persistent as those of pieces of furniture. A\r\nworkman, once instructed to make a thing in a particular way, carries out\r\nhis instructions to the letter, and transmits them to his descendants.\r\n\r\nBefore we consider what these fittings were, I will briefly deal with some\r\nother questions affecting collegiate libraries, as, for instance, their\r\nsize, position, and general arrangement. And first, as regards the number\r\nof books to be accommodated.\r\n\r\nIt happens, unfortunately, that very few catalogues have been preserved\r\nof the libraries referred to in the above statutes; but, if we may\r\nestimate the extent of the remainder from those of which we have some\r\naccount, we shall see that the number of volumes contained in a collegiate\r\nlibrary must have been extremely small. For instance, the catalogue[289]\r\nappended to Bishop Bateman's statutes, dated 1350, enumerates eighty-four\r\nvolumes, classed under the following subjects, in two divisions[290], viz.\r\nthose presented to the College for the immediate use of the Fellows (_A_);\r\nand those reserved for the Bishop's own use during his life (_B_):\r\n\r\n                            _A_  _B_\r\n  Books on Civil Law         7    3\r\n  Books on Canon Law        19   13\r\n  Books on Theology          3   25\r\n  Books for the Chapel       7    7\r\n                            --   --\r\n                            36   48\r\n\r\nAt King's Hall, in 1394, eighty-seven volumes only are enumerated[291];\r\nand even in the University Library not more than 122 volumes were recorded\r\nin 1424[292]. They were distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n  [Books on General Theology][293]                        54\r\n  Books on Scholastic Theology (_Theologia disputata_)    15\r\n  Books on Moral Philosophy                                5\r\n  Books on Natural Philosophy                             12\r\n  Books on Medicine (_medicinalis philosophia_)            5\r\n  Books on Logic                                           1\r\n  Books on Poetry                                          0\r\n  _Libri sophisticales_                                    1\r\n  Books on Grammar                                         6\r\n  Books on History (_Libri cronicales_)                    0\r\n  Books on Canon Law                                      23\r\n                                                         ----\r\n              Total                                      122\r\n\r\nThe catalogue of the Library of Queens' College, dated 1472, enumerates\r\none hundred and ninety-nine volumes[294]; the second catalogue of the\r\nUniversity Library, dated 1473, three hundred and thirty volumes[295]; an\r\nearly catalogue of the library of S. Catharine's Hall, one hundred and\r\nfour volumes, of which eighty-five were given by the Founder[296]; and a\r\ncatalogue of the old library of King's College, dated 1453, one hundred\r\nand seventy-four volumes. In these catalogues the books are not directly\r\nclassed under heads, but arranged roughly, according to subject, in their\r\nrespective cases[297].\r\n\r\nAt Peterhouse in 1418 we find a somewhat larger collection, namely, three\r\nhundred and eighty volumes, divided among seventeen subjects. The general\r\nheading of the catalogue[298] states that it contains \"all the books\r\nbelonging to the house of S. Peter in Cambridge, both those which are\r\nchained in the library, those which are divided among the Fellows, and\r\nthose of which some are intended to be sold, while certain others are laid\r\nup in chests within the aforesaid house.\" This language shews that by the\r\ntime the catalogue was made the collection had been divided into books for\r\nthe use of the Fellows (_libri distribuendi_) and books chained in the\r\nlibrary (_libri cathenati in libraria_); in other words, into a lending\r\nlibrary and a library of reference. We are not told how this division had\r\nbeen made, or at what time; but it is evident that by 1418 it had become\r\npermanent, and no longer depended on the tastes or studies of the Fellows.\r\nThere was one set of books for them to select from, and another for them\r\nto refer to; but the two were quite distinct[299].\r\n\r\nIn the next place I will analyse the catalogue in order to shew what\r\nsubjects were represented, and how many volumes there were in each.

I have also assumed that any book or\r\nbooks representing a given class, if not represented in the lending\r\nlibrary, as Astronomy, Arithmetic, Music, etc., would be chained for\r\nreference. The number of this class, 220, if added to the 160 of the other\r\nclass, gives the required total, 380.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these tables it will be interesting to construct a third,\r\ncontaining the subject and number of the books represented in both\r\ncollections:\r\n\r\n                           Chained      Lent\r\n\r\n  Theology                    61         63\r\n  Natural Philosophy          26 }\r\n  Metaphysics                  3 }       19\r\n  Moral Philosophy             5 }\r\n  Logic                        5         15\r\n  Grammar                      6 }\r\n                                 }       13\r\n  Poetry                       4 }\r\n  Medicine                    15          3\r\n  Civil Law                    9         20\r\n  Canon Law                   18         19\r\n                            ----------------\r\n                             152        152\r\n\r\nThe subjects of the books included in this latter table represent, in a\r\nvery clear and interesting way, the studies pursued at Peterhouse in the\r\n14th and 15th centuries. It is prescribed by the statutes, dated 1344,\r\nthat the scholars are to study Arts, Aristotelian Philosophy, or Theology;\r\nbut that they are to apply themselves to the course in Arts until, in the\r\njudgment of the Master and Fellows, or at least of the larger and wiser\r\nportion of that body, they are sufficiently instructed to proceed to the\r\nstudy of Theology[300]. Two may study Civil Law or Canon Law, but no more\r\nat the same time; and one may study Medicine[301]. For both these lines of\r\nstudy special leave is required.\r\n\r\nThe course of Arts comprised Grammar, Logic, Aristotle, Arithmetic, Music,\r\nGeometry, and Astronomy. In the first of these, including Poetry, the\r\nlending library contained more volumes than the reference library; in\r\nLogic it had three times as many; in Philosophy (Aristotle and his\r\ncommentators) it was well supplied; but, on the other hand, Music,\r\nGeometry and Astronomy were wholly wanting. Theology is represented by 63\r\nvolumes as against 61 in the reference library; Civil Law by 20 volumes\r\nagainst 9 in the reference library; and Canon Law by 19 against 18. In\r\nMedicine, however, there were only 3 against 15. By a curious coincidence\r\nthe number of volumes in the two collections dealing with the subjects\r\nrepresented in both is the same. The subject most in request, as might\r\nhave been expected, was Theology. Next to this come Civil Law and Canon\r\nLaw. Medicine was evidently unpopular. I have no explanation to offer for\r\nthe curious fact that Arithmetic, Music, Geometry, and Rhetoric are\r\nrepresented by only a single volume apiece in the library of\r\nreference[302].\r\n\r\nThese examples, which there is no reason to regard as exceptional, are\r\nsufficient to shew that an ordinary chamber would be large enough to\r\ncontain all the volumes possessed by a college, even after some of the\r\nmore generally useful books of reference had been chained to desks for the\r\nresort of students.\r\n\r\nIt has been already shewn that what Professor Willis calls \"a real\r\nlibrary--that is to say, a room expressly contrived for the purpose of\r\ncontaining books[303]\"--was not introduced into the plan of colleges for\r\nmore than a century after their first foundation. He points out that such\r\nrooms can be at once recognised by their equidistant windows, which do\r\nnot, as a rule, differ from those of the ordinary chambers, except that\r\nthey are separated by much smaller intervals. Examples of this arrangement\r\nare still to be seen at S. John's College, Jesus College, and Queens'\r\nCollege, Cambridge; but perhaps the most characteristic specimen of all is\r\nthat which was built over the Hall at Pembroke College in the same\r\nUniversity, by Laurence Booth (Master 1450-1480), the aspect of which has\r\nbeen preserved in Loggan's print, here reproduced (fig. 48)[304].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 48. Pembroke College, Cambridge, reduced from Loggan's\r\nprint, taken about 1688.\r\n\r\nA, Chapel; B, Library; C, Hall; D, Master's Lodge; E, Kitchen; F, Master's\r\nGarden; G, Fellows' Garden.]\r\n\r\nThe upper chamber (_solarium_) which Thomas Cobham (Bishop of Worcester\r\n1317-27) began to build over the old Congregation House on the north\r\nside of S. Mary's Church, Oxford, about 1320, for the reception of the\r\nbooks which he intended to present to the University, is the earliest of\r\nthese libraries in existence. It still retains on the south side part of a\r\nrange of equidistant single-light windows of the simplest character,\r\nwhich, as just stated, mark the destination of the apartment. This room\r\nis about forty-five feet long by eighteen feet broad, and, in its original\r\nstate, had probably seven single-light windows on each side, and a window\r\nof two lights at the east end[305] (fig. 49). A long controversy between\r\nthe University and Oriel College rendered the benefaction useless for more\r\nthan forty years; and it was not until 1367 that the University passed a\r\nstatute directing that Bishop Cobham's books are to be chained, in proper\r\norder; and that the Scholars who wish to use them are to have free access\r\nto them at convenient hours (_temporibus opportunis_). Lastly, certain\r\nvolumes, of greater value, are to be sold, to the value of forty pounds,\r\nor more, if a larger sum can be obtained for them, for the purpose of\r\npurchasing an annual rent-charge of sixty shillings, to be paid to a\r\nchaplain, who is to pray for the soul of the aforesaid Thomas Cobham, and\r\nother benefactors; and who is to take charge of the books given by him and\r\nthem, and of all other books heretofore given, or hereafter to be given,\r\nto the University[306]. The passing of this statute may probably be\r\nregarded as the first institution of the office of University Librarian.\r\nNotwithstanding this statute, however, the University did not obtain\r\npeaceful possession of their library until 1410, when the controversy was\r\nfinally extinguished by the good offices of their Chancellor, Richard\r\nCourtenay[307].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49. Long Section of Old Congregation House and\r\nLibrary, Oxford, looking south.\r\n\r\nFrom _The Church of S. Mary the Virgin, Oxford_, by T. G. Jackson,\r\nArchitect.]\r\n\r\nAs a type of a collegiate library I will select the old library of Queens'\r\nCollege, Cambridge. This room, on the first floor of the north side of the\r\nquadrangle, forms part of the buildings erected in 1448. It is 44 ft. long\r\nby 20 ft. wide (fig. 50), and is lighted by eleven windows, each of two\r\nlights, six of which are in the south wall and five in the north wall. The\r\nwindows in the south wall have lost their cusps, but they are retained in\r\nthose in the north wall--and the library has in all points suffered less\r\nfrom modern interference than almost any other with which I am acquainted.\r\nThe bookcases have been altered and patched more than once, in order to\r\nprovide additional shelf-room; but at the bottom of the more modern\r\nsuperstructure part at least of the original medieval desk may be\r\ndetected. If this fragment be carefully examined it will be found that\r\nthere is on the inside of each end of the bookcase a groove which\r\nevidently once supported a desk 6 ft. 6 in. long, and of a height\r\nconvenient for a seated reader to use[308] (fig. 51). The books lay on\r\ntheir sides on this desk, to which they were chained in a way that I shall\r\nexplain directly, and a bench for the reader was placed between each pair\r\nof desks. In the plan (fig. 50) I have added the half-desk which once\r\nstood against the west wall; and I have lettered all the desks according\r\nto the catalogue made in 1472 by Andrew Docket, the first President.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50. Ground-plan of the Library at Queens' College,\r\nCambridge.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 51. Elevation of book-desk in Library of Queens'\r\nCollege, Cambridge.][309]\r\n\r\nIt should be carefully noted, when studying this plan, that the distance\r\nbetween each pair of windows is not more than 2 feet, and that the end of\r\nthe desk covers the whole of this space. If this fact be borne in mind\r\nwhen examining libraries that are now fitted up in a different way, it\r\nbecomes possible to detect what the original method was.\r\n\r\nI propose to name this system of fittings the lectern-system; and I shall\r\nshew, as we proceed, that it was adopted, with various modifications, in\r\nEngland, France, Holland, Germany and Italy.\r\n\r\nFortunately, one example of such fittings still exists, at Zutphen in\r\nHolland, which I visited in April, 1894. Shortly afterwards I wrote the\r\nfollowing description of what is probably a unique survival of an ancient\r\nfashion[310].\r\n\r\nThe library in which these fittings occur is attached to the church of SS.\r\nPeter and Walburga, the principal church of the town. A library of some\r\nkind is said to have existed there from very early times[311]; but the\r\nplace where the books were kept is not known. In 1555 a suggestion was\r\nmade that it would be well to get together a really good collection of\r\nbooks for the use of the public. The first stone of the present building\r\nwas laid in 1561, and it was completed in 1563. The author of the\r\n_Theatrum Urbium Belgicae_, John Blaeu, whose work was completed in 1649,\r\ndescribes it as \"the public library poorly furnished with books, but being\r\ndaily increased by the liberality of the Senate and Deputies[312].\"\r\n\r\nThe room is built against the south choir-aisle of the church, out of\r\nwhich a door opens into it. In consequence of this position the shape is\r\nirregular, for the church is apsidal, and the choir-aisle is continued\r\nround part of the apse. It is about 60 feet long, by 26 feet broad at the\r\nwest end. In the centre are four octagonal columns on square bases,\r\nsupporting a plain quadripartite vault. The room is thus divided\r\nlongitudinally into two aisles, with a small irregular space at the east\r\nend.\r\n\r\nThe diagrammatic ground-plan, here subjoined (fig. 52), will help to make\r\nthis description clear. It makes no pretensions to accuracy, having been\r\ndrawn from notes only[313].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52. Ground-plan of the Library at Zutphen.]\r\n\r\nThere are two windows, each of three lights, at the west end of the room,\r\nand four similar windows on the south side, one to each bay. There is a\r\nfifth window, now blocked, at the south-east corner. Some of these windows\r\ncontain fragments of richly coloured stained glass--among which the figure\r\nof a large green parrot is conspicuous; but whether these fragments were\r\nbrought from the church, or are part of the glass originally supplied to\r\nthe library, there is no evidence to shew. Most of these windows are\r\npartially blocked, having been damaged, it is said, in one of the numerous\r\nsieges from which Zutphen has suffered. The position of the church, close\r\nto the fortifications, as Blaeu's bird's-eye view shews, makes this story\r\nprobable. The floor is paved with red tiles. The general appearance of the\r\nroom will be understood from the view of the north aisle reduced from a\r\nphotograph (fig. 53)[314].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53. General view of the north side of the Library\r\nattached to the church of S. Walburga at Zutphen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 54. Desk and reader on the south side of the Library\r\nat Zutphen.\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 55. Elevation of (A) one of the bookcases in the\r\nLibrary at Zutphen: (B) one of those in the Library at Queens' College,\r\nCambridge[315].]\r\n\r\nThere are eighteen bookcases, or desks; namely, ten on the south side of\r\nthe room, and eight on the north side (fig. 52). The material is oak; the\r\nworkmanship very rude and rough. I will describe those on the south side\r\nfirst. Each is 9 feet long by 5 feet 5 1/4 inches high, measured from the\r\nfloor to the top of the finial on the end; and the lower edge of the desk\r\non which the books lie is 2 feet 6 1/4 inches above the floor; but the\r\ngeneral plan, and the relative dimensions of the different parts, will be\r\nbest understood from the photograph of a single desk at which a reader is\r\nseated (fig. 54), and from the elevation of one of the ends (fig. 55, A),\r\nbeside which I have placed the elevation of one of the desks at Queens'\r\nCollege (B). The photograph shews that in fixing the height of the desk\r\nabove the ground the convenience of readers has been carefully considered.\r\nThe iron bar that carries the chains is locked into the ornamental\r\nupright, passes through a staple in the middle of the desk, and into the\r\nupright at the opposite end, which is left plain. This bar is half an inch\r\nin diameter, and one inch above the level of the top of the desk. It is\r\nprevented from bending by passing through a staple fixed in the centre of\r\nthe desk. A piece of ornamental iron-work is fixed to the upright. It is\r\nmade to represent a lock, but is in reality a mere plate of metal, and the\r\ntongue, which looks as though it were intended to move, is only an\r\nornament, and is pierced by the keyhole. The lock is sunk in the thickness\r\nof the wood, behind this plate, and the bar, which terminates in a knob,\r\nis provided with two nicks, into which the bolts of the lock are shot\r\nwhen the key is turned (fig. 56). Between each pair of desks there is a\r\nseat for the reader.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 56. End of iron bar, Zutphen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 57. End of one of the desks on the north side of the\r\nLibrary, Zutphen.]\r\n\r\nThe desks on the north side of the room differ slightly from those on the\r\nsouth side. They are rather larger, the ends are of a different shape and\r\ndevoid of ornament (fig. 57), and there is a wider interval between the\r\nbar and the top of the desk. It seems to me probable that the more highly\r\nornamented desks are those which were put in when the room was first\r\nfitted up, and that the others were added from time to time as new books\r\nhad to be accommodated.\r\n\r\nThe books are attached to the desk by the following process. A chain was\r\ntaken about 12 inches long, more or less, consisting of long narrow links\r\nof hammered iron. These links exactly resemble, both in shape and size,\r\nthose of a chain which may still be seen in the library of the Grammar\r\nSchool at Guildford, Surrey[316]. This chain, of which a piece is here\r\nfigured (fig. 58), was probably made in 1586, or only 23 years after the\r\nbuilding of the library at Zutphen. It terminates, like those at Zutphen\r\n(fig. 59), in a swivel (to prevent entanglement), attached to the ring\r\nwhich is strung upon the bar. The attachment of the chain to the book was\r\neffected by means of a piece of metal bent round so as to form a loop\r\nthrough which the last link of the chain was passed. The ends of the loop,\r\nflattened out, were attached by nail or rivet to the edge of the stout\r\nwooden board which formed the side of the book. This mode of attachment\r\nwill be best seen in the volume which I figure next (fig. 60)--a\r\ncollection of sermons printed at Nuremberg in 1487. It is believed to have\r\nonce belonged to a Dominican House at Bamberg, in the library of which it\r\nwas chained[317].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 58. Piece of chain, shewing the ring attached to the\r\nbar, the swivel, and one of the links, actual size. Guildford.]\r\n\r\nThe iron loop in this specimen (fig. 60) is fastened to what I call the\r\nright-hand board of the book; by which I mean the board which is to the\r\nright hand of a reader when the book lies open before him; but the\r\nselection of the right-hand or the left-hand board depended on individual\r\ntaste. Further the mode of attachment is never the same in two examples.\r\nThe iron and rivets are often clumsy, and do considerable damage to the\r\nleaves, by forcing them out of shape and staining them with rust.\r\n\r\nIn this method of chaining no provision is made for removing any book\r\nfrom the desk when not wanted, and placing it on a shelf beneath the desk,\r\nas was done in some Italian modifications of the system. Each volume must\r\nlie on the desk, attached by its chain, like a Bible on a church-lectern.\r\nThe smallest number of volumes on any desk at Zutphen is six; the largest,\r\neleven; the total, 316. Most of those on the south side of the room were\r\nprinted during the first half of the sixteenth century; those on the north\r\nside are much later, some as late as 1630. I did not see any manuscripts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 59. Piece of the iron bar, with chain, Zutphen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 60. Chained book, from a Dominican House at Bamberg,\r\nSouth Germany.]\r\n\r\nIf we now reconsider the indications preserved at Queens' College, it\r\nwill, I feel sure, be recognised that the desks at Zutphen explain them,\r\nand enable us to realise the aspect of what I conceive to have been the\r\nmost ancient method of fitting up a collegiate or a monastic library. When\r\nsuch a room first became necessary in a monastery, and furniture suitable\r\nfor it was debated, a lectern would surely suggest itself, as being used\r\nin the numerous daily services, and proving itself singularly convenient\r\nfor the support of books while they were being read.\r\n\r\nAnother example of such fittings was once to be seen at Pembroke College,\r\nCambridge, in the library above the hall (fig. 48). In Dr Matthew Wren's\r\naccount of that library already quoted there is a passage which may be\r\ntranslated as follows:\r\n\r\n    I would have you know that in the year 1617 the Library\r\n    was completely altered and made to assume an entirely\r\n    new appearance. This alteration was rendered necessary\r\n    by the serious damage which, to our great sorrow, we\r\n    found the books had suffered--a damage which was\r\n    increasing daily--partly from the sloping form of the\r\n    desks, partly from the inconvenient weight of the chains\r\n    (_tum ex declivi pluteorum fabrica, tum ex inepta mole\r\n    catenarum_)[318].\r\n\r\nThese desks were copied at S. John's College in the same University. A\r\ncontract dated 20 June, 1516, provides that the contractor\r\n\r\n    shall make all the Desks in the Library wythin the said\r\n    college of good and substanciall and abyll Tymber of Oke\r\n    mete and convenient for the same Library, aftir and\r\n    accordyng to the Library within ... Pembroke Hall[319].\r\n\r\nThe Library here referred to was on the first floor to the south of the\r\nGreat Gate of the college. It is now divided into chambers, but its\r\noriginal extent can be readily made out by its range of equidistant\r\nwindows. The wall-spaces dividing these are 28 1/2 inches wide,\r\npractically the same as those at Queens' College.\r\n\r\nAt Peterhouse also a similar arrangement seems to have subsisted when the\r\ncatalogue of 1418 was made. The very first book, a Bible, is said to stand\r\n\"in the sixth lectern on the west side (_lectrino 6^o ex parte\r\noccidentali_).\" The word _lectrinum_ is unusual, but it emphasizes the\r\nform of the desk more clearly than any other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 61 Single desk in the old Library, Lincoln Cathedral.]\r\n\r\nA splendid example of this type of case is to be seen at Lincoln (fig.\r\n61), where three \"stalls\" or desks, belonging to the old library already\r\ndescribed[320], are still preserved. Each is about 7 ft. long, 3 ft.\r\nbroad, and 4 ft. 4 in. high to the top of the sloping portion. At each\r\nend, and in the centre, is a massive molded standard, 7 ft. 2 in. high,\r\nterminating in a boldly carved finial; and these three standards are\r\nconnected together by a band of open-work, of a design similar to that of\r\nthe cornice of the library. Half way between this band and the top of the\r\ndesk is the bar to carry the chains, now of wood, but formerly of course\r\nof iron; and below this again is a shelf 18 in. wide, projecting slightly\r\nbeyond the sloping portion of the desk. The edge of the desk is protected\r\nby a ledge, as usual, and under it is a second shelf extending the whole\r\nwidth of the piece of furniture. What was the use of these shelves? As the\r\nbar is above the desk, not below it, the books must have reposed, as a\r\ngeneral rule, upon the desk, instead of being laid on their sides on the\r\nshelf below it when not wanted by a reader. The chains would not have been\r\nlong enough to allow of any other arrangement. I think, therefore, that\r\nthe lower shelf must have been a constructional contrivance, to assist in\r\nkeeping the standards in their places. The narrow upper shelf, on the\r\nother hand, was probably intended for the convenience of the reader. He\r\nmight place on it, temporarily, any book that he was not using, and which\r\ngot in his way while he was reading one of those beside it; or, if he was\r\nmaking extracts, he might set his inkstand upon it.\r\n\r\nThese desks evidently stood in the old library against the shafts of the\r\nroof, for one of the ends has been hollowed out in each to receive the\r\nshaft; and the finial, which is left plain on that side, is bent over\r\nslightly, to admit it under the brace (fig. 39).\r\n\r\nAs I have now described three varieties of the lectern-system, I will\r\nplace before my readers, side by side, elevations of each of the three\r\n(fig. 62) drawn to the same scale. It will be seen that they resemble each\r\nother exactly in essentials. The differences observable are accidental,\r\nand may be referred to individual taste.\r\n\r\nThat this form of desk was recognised on the continent as typical of\r\nlibrary-fittings is proved by its appearance in a French translation of\r\nthe first book of the _Consolation of Philosophy_ of Boethius, which I had\r\nthe good fortune to find in the British Museum[321] (fig. 63). This\r\nmanuscript was written in Flanders towards the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. In such a work the library shewn requires what I may term\r\ngeneralised fittings. An eccentric peculiarity would have been quite\r\ninadmissible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 62. Elevation of (A) one of the bookcases in the\r\nLibrary at Zutphen; (B) one of those in the Library at Queens' College,\r\nCambridge; (C) one of those in the Library of Lincoln Cathedral.]\r\n\r\nIn the Stadtbibliothek of Nuremberg some of the oldest works on\r\njurisprudence still preserve their chains. Each has a short chain about\r\n12 in. long fixed on the upper edge of the left-hand board. The title is\r\nwritten on the middle of the upper edge of the right-hand board. It is\r\nobvious that these volumes must have lain on a desk with their titles\r\nuppermost[322].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 63. Interior of a Library.\r\n\r\nFrom a MS. of a French translation of the first book of the _Consolation\r\nof Philosophy_ by Boethius: written in Flanders towards the end of the\r\nfifteenth century.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 64. Library of the College de Navarre, Paris, now\r\ndestroyed.]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that similar fittings were used in the library of the\r\nSorbonne, Paris, which was first established in 1289, with books chained\r\nfor the common convenience of the Fellows (_in communem sociorum\r\nutilitatem_)[323]. This library was divided into two separate collections,\r\nwhich formed, so to speak, two distinct libraries. The first, called the\r\ngreat library, or the common library, contained the books most frequently\r\nstudied. They were chained, and could only be taken out under the most\r\nexceptional circumstances. A statute, dated 1321, the provisions of which\r\nrecall the collegiate statutes summarised above, directed that the best\r\nbook the society possessed on each subject should be thus chained. The\r\nsecond division of the library, called the small library, contained\r\nduplicates, books rarely consulted, and generally all those of which the\r\nloan was authorised under certain conditions[324]. The following\r\ndescription of this library has been given by Claude Hemere (Librarian\r\n1638-43) in his MS. history. This I proceed to translate:\r\n\r\n    The old library was contained under one roof. It was\r\n    firmly and solidly built, and was 120 feet long by 36\r\n    feet broad.... Each side was pierced with 19 windows of\r\n    equal size, that plenty of daylight both from the east\r\n    and the west (for this was the direction of the room)\r\n    might fall upon the desks, and fill the whole length and\r\n    breadth of the library. There were 28 desks, marked with\r\n    the letters of the alphabet, five feet high, and so\r\n    arranged that they were separated by a moderate\r\n    interval. They were loaded with books, all of which were\r\n    chained, that no sacrilegious hand might [carry them\r\n    off. These chains were attached to the right-hand board\r\n    of every book] so that they might be readily thrown\r\n    aside, and reading not be interfered with. Moreover the\r\n    volumes could be opened and shut without difficulty. A\r\n    reader who sat down in the space between two desks, as\r\n    they rose to a height of five feet as I said above,\r\n    neither saw nor disturbed any one else who might be\r\n    reading or writing in another place by talking or by any\r\n    other interruption, unless the other student wished it,\r\n    or paid attention to any question that might be put to\r\n    him. It was required, by the ancient rules of the\r\n    library, that reading, writing, and handling of books\r\n    should go forward in complete silence[325].\r\n\r\nThis description indicates desks similar to those of Zutphen. Even the\r\nheight is the same.\r\n\r\nA library which vividly recalls the above account, with 19 windows on one\r\nside and probably the same number on the other, was built in 1506 for the\r\nCollege de Navarre, Paris, now the Ecole Polytechnique[326]. My\r\nillustration (fig. 64) is from a photograph taken shortly before its\r\ndestruction in 1867. I have calculated that it was about 108 ft. long by\r\n30 ft. wide.\r\n\r\nThe library of the College d'Autun, Paris, was similarly arranged. An\r\ninventory taken 29 July, 1462, records: \"dix bancs doubles, a se seoir\r\nd'une part et d'autre, et ung poupitre; esquelz bancs et poupitre out este\r\ntrouvez enchaisnez les livres qui s'ensuyvent, qui sont intitulez sur la\r\ncouverture d'iceulx[327].\" The catalogue enumerates 174 volumes, or rather\r\nmore than 17 for each \"banc\" or lectern. The expression _bancs doubles_ is\r\ninteresting, as it seems to imply that there were at that time libraries\r\nin which _bancs simples_ were used; that is to say, lecterns with only one\r\nsloping surface instead of two.\r\n\r\nA study of the catalogue drawn up in 1513 for the Augustinian House of S.\r\nVictor, Paris, by Claude de Grandrue, one of the monks, shews that the\r\nsame system must have been in use there. Further, his catalogue is an\r\nexcellent specimen of the pains taken in a large monastery to describe the\r\nbooks accurately, and to provide ready access to them. A brief prefatory\r\nnote informs us that the desks are arranged in three rows, and marked with\r\na triple series of letters. The first row is marked A, B, C, etc.; the\r\nsecond AA, BB, etc.; the third AAA, BBB, etc. To each of these letters are\r\nappended the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on, to shew the position of the\r\nrequired volume. For instance--to take one at random--_Abaelardi confessio_\r\nis marked P. 13: that is, it is the thirteenth book on the desk in the\r\nfirst row marked P. When the catalogue proper--in which each manuscript is\r\ncarefully described--was finished, the author increased its usefulness by\r\nthe composition of an alphabetical index[328].\r\n\r\nHow, I shall be asked, can the form of the bookcase or desk (_pulpitum_)\r\nbe inferred from this catalogue? I reply: In the first place, because\r\nthere are no shelf-marks. The librarian notes the letter of the desk, and\r\nthe place of each book on it, but nothing more. Secondly, because the\r\nnumber of manuscripts accommodated on each desk is so small. There are 50\r\ndesks, and 988 manuscripts--or, an average of little more than 19 to\r\neach. At Zutphen the average is exactly 18. This piece of evidence,\r\nhowever, is so important that I will give it in detail. The following\r\ntable, compiled by myself from the catalogue, gives the letters used to\r\nmark the desks, and the number of manuscripts on each.\r\n\r\n  A   13 | AA   13 | AAA   15\r\n  B   21 | BB   16 | BBB   16\r\n  C   13 | CC   19 | CCC   17\r\n  D   18 | DD   18 | DDD   19\r\n  E   17 | EE   21 | EEE   17\r\n  F   20 | FF   17 | FFF   29\r\n  G   18 | GG   18 | GGG   24\r\n  H   16 | HH   17 | HHH   29\r\n  I   16 | II   23 | III   25\r\n  K   17 | KK   21 | KKK   29\r\n  L   22 | LL   21 | LLL   23\r\n  M   21 | MM   20 | MMM   26\r\n  N   18 | NN   20 |      ----\r\n  O   14 | OO   13 |      269\r\n  P   19 | PP   23 |\r\n  Q   22 | QQ   27 |\r\n  R   14 | RR   26 |\r\n  S   14 | SS   28 |\r\n  T   21 | TT   24 |\r\n     ----|     ----|\r\n     334 |     385 |\r\n\r\nThese totals give a general total of 988 manuscripts, which, divided by\r\n50, makes the average number for each desk, as stated above, 19.76.\r\n\r\nFurther, my theory is supported by the positive evidence of a description\r\nof this library (unfortunately without date) quoted by M. Delisle: \"Les\r\nlivres estoient couchez et enchaisnez, sur de longs pupitres, et une allee\r\nentre deux[329].\" It is obvious that the English system of placing each\r\nlectern between a pair of windows could not have been maintained here.\r\n\r\nAt Queens' College, Cambridge, the catalogue, dated 1472, enumerates 192\r\nvolumes, divided over 10 desks and 4 half-desks, each called a step\r\n(_gradus_). There were (avoiding fractions) 8 books on each half-desk, and\r\n15 on each complete desk; so that by comparing the plan (fig. 50) and\r\nelevation of a desk (fig. 51) with the views of the library at Zutphen, a\r\ngood idea of a college library in the fifteenth century can be obtained.\r\n\r\nBefore I leave the lectern-system, I will describe two eccentric specimens\r\nof it. The first is still to be seen at Trinity Hall, Cambridge; the\r\nsecond once existed at the University of Leyden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 66. Elevation of a book-desk and seat in the Library\r\nof Trinity Hall, Cambridge.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 65. General view of the Library at Trinity Hall,\r\nCambridge.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 68. A French Library of 1480.\r\n\r\nFrom MS. 164 in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.]\r\n\r\nThe library of Trinity Hall is thoroughly medieval in plan, being a long\r\nnarrow room on the first floor of the north side of the second court, 65\r\nfeet long by 20 feet wide, with eight equidistant windows in each\r\nside-wall, and a window of four lights in the western gable. It was built\r\nabout 1600, but the fittings are even later, having been added between\r\n1626 and 1645 during the mastership of Thomas Eden, LL.D. They are\r\ntherefore a deliberate return to ancient forms at a time when a different\r\ntype had been adopted elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThere are five desks and six seats on each side of the room, placed, as\r\nusual, at right angles to the side-walls, in the inter spaces of the\r\nwindows, and in front of the windows, respectively. Their arrangement, and\r\nthe details of their construction, will be understood from the general\r\nview (fig. 65), and from the elevation (fig. 66).\r\n\r\nThese lecterns are of oak, 6 feet 7 inches long, and 7 feet high, measured\r\nto the top of the ornamental finial. There is a sloping desk at the top,\r\nbeneath which is a single shelf (fig. 66, A). The bar for the chains\r\npasses under the desk, through the two vertical ends of the case. At the\r\nend farthest from the wall, the hasp of the lock is hinged to the bar and\r\nsecured by two keys (fig. 67). Beneath the shelf there is at either end a\r\nslip of wood (fig. 66, B), which indicates that there was once a moveable\r\ndesk which could be pulled out when required. The reader could therefore\r\nconsult his convenience, and work either sitting or standing (fig. 65).\r\nFor both these positions the heights are very suitable, and at the bottom\r\nof the case was a plinth (fig. 66, C), on which he could set his feet. The\r\nseats between each pair of desks were of course put up at the same time as\r\nthe desks themselves. They shew an advance in comfort, being divided into\r\ntwo, so as to allow support to the reader's back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 67. Lock at end of book-desk. Trinity Hall.]\r\n\r\nSimilar desks occur in a beautiful miniature (fig. 68) from a manuscript\r\n(now in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge[330]) written in France about\r\n1480. They appear to be solid--possibly fitted with cupboards for books\r\nunder the sloping portion. No seats are shewn, and, as a reader is\r\nstanding between them consulting a book, it may be concluded that they\r\ncould only be used by students in that position.\r\n\r\nLastly, I reproduce (fig. 69) a print by Jan Cornelis Woudanus, shewing\r\nthe library of the University of Leyden in 1610[331]. The bookcases were\r\nevidently contrived with the view of getting the largest number possible\r\ninto the room. Each contained a single row of books, chained to a bar in\r\nfront of the shelf; and, also for the purpose of saving the space usually\r\noccupied by a seat, readers were obliged to consult them standing. There\r\nare eleven bookcases on each side of the room, each containing from 40 to\r\n48 volumes. At the end of the room are two cupboards, probably for\r\nmanuscripts; and to the right of the spectator is a third press, marked\r\n_Legatum Josephi Scaligeri_. He died in January, 1609. Further, as an\r\nillustration of the usual appliances for study found in libraries at this\r\nperiod, and often mentioned in catalogues and account-books, I would draw\r\nattention to the globes and maps.\r\n\r\nI present these bookcases at this point of my researches with some\r\ndiffidence, for they can hardly be said to represent the lectern-system.\r\nOn the other hand, they do not exactly represent any other; and I\r\ntherefore submit that they may be looked at here, as transitional\r\nspecimens, bridging over the interval between the desks we have lately\r\nbeen considering, and those which we shall have to consider in the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 69. The interior of the Library of the University of\r\nLeyden.\r\n\r\nFrom a print by Jan Cornelis Woudanus, dated 1610.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[258] The Statutes of the Colleges of Oxford and Cambridge bearing on the\r\ncare of books have been thoroughly analysed by Professor Willis in his\r\nessay on \"The Library,\" _Arch.

LIBRARY OF CORPUS CHRISTI\r\nCOLLEGE, OXFORD, TAKEN AS A TYPE. SYSTEM OF CHAINING IN HEREFORD\r\nCATHEDRAL. LIBRARIES OF MERTON COLLEGE, OXFORD, AND CLARE COLLEGE,\r\nCAMBRIDGE. THE STALL-SYSTEM COPIED AT WESTMINSTER ABBEY, WELLS, AND DURHAM\r\nCATHEDRALS. THIS SYSTEM POSSIBLY MONASTIC. LIBRARIES AT CANTERBURY, DOVER\r\nPRIORY, CLAIRVAUX.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the evidence brought forward in the last chapter be accepted, the\r\nLibrary which a Monastery or College built in the fifteenth century was a\r\nlong narrow room lighted by rows of equidistant windows. Occasionally, if\r\nneighbouring buildings allowed, there was a window at the end of the room\r\nalso. The fittings were lecterns of wood. On these the books were laid,\r\neach volume being fastened by a chain to a bar usually placed over the\r\ndesk, but occasionally, in all probability, in front of it or beneath it.\r\nThe readers sat on benches immoveably fixed opposite to each window. It is\r\nobvious that reading was convenient enough so long as the students were\r\nfew, but if they were numerous and the books chained too closely together\r\nmuch annoyance must have been caused. When the University of Oxford\r\npetitioned Humphrey Duke of Gloucester in 1444 to help them to build a new\r\nlibrary, they specially dwelt upon the obstacles to study arising from the\r\novercrowded condition of the old room. \"Should any student,\" they said,\r\n\"be poring over a single volume, as often happens, he keeps three or four\r\nothers away on account of the books being chained so closely\r\ntogether[332].\"\r\n\r\nFurther, the lectern-system was so wasteful in the matter of space, that,\r\nas books accumulated, some other piece of furniture had to be devised to\r\ncontain them. The desk could not be dispensed with so long as books were\r\nchained; and it therefore occurred to an ingenious carpenter that the\r\nrequired conditions would be fulfilled if the two halves of the desk were\r\nseparated, not by a few inches, but by a considerable interval, or broad\r\nshelf, with one or more shelves fixed above it. Thus a case was arrived at\r\ncontaining four shelves at least, two to each side of the case, which\r\ncould be made as long as the width of the library permitted. I propose to\r\ncall this system \"the stall-system,\" from the word _staulum_ (sometimes\r\nwritten _stalla_, _stallus_, or _stallum_), which is frequently applied to\r\na case for books in a medieval library.\r\n\r\nThere are at least five fine examples of this system at Oxford--none, I am\r\nsorry to say, at Cambridge. There was a set at Clare College, supplied to\r\nthe old Library about 1627, but they have since been altered by the\r\nremoval of the desks. Those at Oxford are at Corpus Christi College\r\n(1517), S. John's College (1596), Sir Thomas Bodley's library (1598),\r\nMerton College (1623), Jesus College (1677-79), Magdalen College (of\r\nuncertain date).\r\n\r\nAs a type of this system I shall take the library of Corpus Christi\r\nCollege, founded in 1516 by Richard Fox, Bishop of Winchester. The library\r\nwas ready for the fittings by the end of March in the following year, as\r\nwe learn from a building account preserved by Hearne:\r\n\r\n    8 Henry VIII. This boke made from the xvth day off March\r\n    unto the xxxti day off the same Moneth [30 March, 1517].\r\n\r\n    Md. couenauntyd and agreid wyth Comell Clerke, for the\r\n    makyng off the dextis in the liberary, to the summe off\r\n    xvi, after the maner and forme as they be in Magdaleyn\r\n    college, except the popie heedes off the seites, thes to\r\n    be workmanly wrowght and clenly, and he to have all\r\n    maner off stooff foond hym, and to have for the makyng\r\n    off on dexte xs the sum off the hole viii. li.[333]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 70. Bookcases and seat in the Library at Corpus\r\nChristi College, Oxford.\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph taken in 1894.]\r\n\r\nThe arrangement and appearance of these most interesting cases will be\r\nunderstood from the general view (fig. 70) and from the elevation (fig.\r\n71), but I shall proceed to describe them with some minuteness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 71. Elevation of one bookcase in the Library of Corpus\r\nChristi College, Oxford.]\r\n\r\nThe library occupies the first floor of the south side of the quadrangle\r\nopposite to the entrance. It is 79 feet 6 inches long, by 21 feet broad,\r\nwith ten equidistant windows, about 3 feet 6 inches apart, on each side.\r\nAt the west end there is an inner library, occupying the angle between the\r\nsouth and west sides of the quadrangle. On each side there are nine\r\nbookcases, each 8 ft. 6 in. high, 2 ft. wide, and 7 ft. 6 in. long,\r\ndivided by partitions into three compartments.\r\n\r\nI have carefully studied these cases on several occasions, and it seems to\r\nme that the only alterations introduced since the original construction\r\nare: (1) the addition of about two feet to the upper portion of the case\r\nin order to provide additional shelf-room; (2) a slight change in the\r\narrangements of the desk for the reader; and (3) the addition of the\r\ncatalogue frame, which by its style is evidently Jacobean, to the end next\r\nthe central alley. Originally each case had two shelves only, one on the\r\nlevel of the desk (Fig. 71, G, H), and the second about half-way between\r\nit and the original top of the case (_ibid._ E, F). Before chaining fell\r\ninto disuse the cases were heightened so as to provide an additional shelf\r\n(_ibid._ C, D). At present the number has been further increased by the\r\naddition of a fourth shelf above the desk (_ibid._ A, B), and two below it\r\n(_ibid._ I, K, L, M). The desks have been altered by a change in the\r\nposition of the bracket, and by the suppression of the slit through which\r\nthe chains usually passed, as I shall explain below.\r\n\r\nThe system of chaining used for the lectern-system required modification\r\nand extension to suit this new arrangement of shelves. At Corpus Christi\r\nCollege most of the iron-work remains (fig. 70); but it is necessary to go\r\nelsewhere to find chained books actually in use. Of such chaining I know\r\nno better example than the Chapter Library in Hereford Cathedral, from a\r\nstudy of which I will describe the system, and shew that it is the same as\r\nthat employed at Corpus Christi College and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe Chapter Library at Hereford was originally over the west cloister, and\r\nthere is evidence that it was being fitted up in 1394, when Walter de\r\nRammesbury, B.D., gave L10 for the desks[334]. The original building has\r\nlong since been destroyed, and the books were transferred from one place\r\nto another until the present beautiful structure was built on the old site\r\nin 1897.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 73. Part of a bookcase in the Chapter Library,\r\nHereford.]\r\n\r\nThroughout these changes some very ancient bookcases have been preserved.\r\nThey have been taken to pieces and altered several times, but are\r\nprobably, in the main, those put up in 1394. Above all, one of them\r\npossesses, in thorough working order, the system of chaining, parts of\r\nwhich are to be met with on the cases at Oxford which we have been\r\nconsidering. Of the accompanying illustrations the first (fig. 72) gives a\r\ngeneral view of the most complete case, that which now contains the\r\nmanuscripts, and the second (fig. 73) shews one compartment of the same\r\ncase with the books, chains, desk etc. This case is 9 ft. 8 in. long, 2\r\nft. 2 in. wide and 8 ft. high, exclusive of the cornice. The material is\r\nunplaned oak, very rough; the ends are 2-3 in. thick, made of three planks\r\nfastened together with strong wooden pegs. The desk has been a good deal\r\naltered, and is now inconveniently low, but, as the books were chained, it\r\nis evident that there must always have been desks on each case, and\r\nmoreover the hook which held them up is still to be seen in several\r\nplaces. The frames to contain the catalogue, which closely resemble those\r\nat Oxford, are known to have been added in the 17th century by Thomas\r\nThornton, D.D., Canon Residentiary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 72. Bookcase in the Chapter Library, Hereford\r\nCathedral.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 74. Part of a single volume, shewing the clasp, the\r\nring for the chain, and the mode of attaching it: Hereford.]\r\n\r\nFrom a sketch taken in 1876.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 75. A single volume, standing on the shelf, with the\r\nchain attached to the iron bar: Hereford.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 76. Iron bar and socket, closed to prevent removal of\r\nthe bar: Hereford.]\r\n\r\nAs the books were to stand upright on a shelf, not to lie on their sides\r\non a desk, it was necessary to attach the chain in a different manner. A\r\nnarrow strip of flat brass was passed round the left-hand board (fig. 74)\r\nand riveted to it, in such a manner as to leave a loop in front of the\r\nedge of the board, wide enough to admit an iron ring, an inch and a\r\nquarter in diameter, to which one end of the chain was fastened. The book\r\nis placed on the shelf with the fore-edge turned outwards, and the other\r\nend of the chain is fastened to a second ring, rather larger than the\r\nformer, which plays along an iron bar (fig. 75). For the two upper shelves\r\nthese bars, which are 1/2 in. in diameter, are supported in front of the\r\nshelf, at such a distance from it as to allow of easy play for the rings\r\n(fig. 73). Each bar extends only from partition to partition, so that\r\nthree bars are needed for each shelf. For the lowest shelf there are also\r\nthree bars, set two inches behind the edge of the shelf, so as to keep the\r\nrings and chains out of the way of the desk. The bars for the upper\r\nshelves rest in iron sockets screwed to the woodwork at the juncture of\r\nthe horizontal shelves with the vertical divisions and ends respectively.\r\nThe socket fixed to the end of the bookcase which was intended to stand\r\nagainst the wall is closed by an iron plate (fig. 76), so that the bar\r\ncannot pass beyond it. At the opposite end, that which would usually face\r\nthe alley between the two rows of bookcases, the bars are secured by lock\r\nand key in the following manner. A piece of flat iron is nailed to the end\r\nof the bookcase, just above the level of the uppermost shelf (fig. 77).\r\nAttached to this by a hinge is a hasp, or band of iron, two inches wide,\r\nand rather longer than the interval between the two shelves. Opposite to\r\neach shelf this iron band expands into a semicircular plate, to which a\r\ncap is riveted for the reception of the head of the socket in which the\r\nbar rests (fig. 77); and just below the middle shelf it drops into a lock\r\nand is secured by a key (fig. 73). A second hasp, similarly constructed,\r\nsecures the lowest of the three bars; but, as that bar is behind, and not\r\nin front of, the shelf to which it belongs, the arrangements described\r\nabove are reversed. One lock and key serves for the ironwork belonging to\r\nthe three shelves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 77. Iron bar, with part of the iron plate or hasp\r\nwhich is secured by the lock and keeps the bar in place: Hereford.]\r\n\r\nThe chains are made of links of hammered iron as shewn in the sketch (fig.\r\n78) which represents a piece of one of the actual size. There is usually a\r\nswivel in the centre, probably to prevent twisting. They vary somewhat in\r\nlength, and in the length of the links, according to the shelf on which\r\nthe books to which they belong are ranged, it being obviously necessary to\r\nprovide for the convenient placing of a book on the desk when a reader\r\nwished to consult it. The most usual dimensions are 3 ft. 4 in., 3 ft. 6\r\nin., 4 ft. 3 in.\r\n\r\nThe removal of any of the volumes, or the addition of a new one, must have\r\nbeen a tedious and inconvenient operation. The bar would have to be\r\nwithdrawn, and all the rings set free. Moreover, if this change had to be\r\neffected in one of the compartments remote from the end of the case which\r\ncarried the lock, the bar belonging to each of the other compartments\r\nwould have to be withdrawn before the required volume could be reached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 78. Piece of chain, shewing the swivel: Hereford.\r\n\r\nActual size.]\r\n\r\nIf the views (figs. 70, 71) of the book-cases at Corpus Christi College,\r\nOxford, be attentively examined, it will be seen that the ironwork exactly\r\nresembles that at Hereford. We find similar sockets to contain the bars at\r\nthe junction of the horizontal shelves and vertical uprights, and a\r\nsimilar system of iron hasps to prevent the bars from being withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe desk for the reader would of course vary according to individual\r\ntaste. As a general rule it was attached to the ends of the case by strong\r\nhinges, so that it could be turned up and got out of the way when any\r\nalteration in the ironwork had to be carried out. Iron hooks to hold it up\r\nwere not unfrequently provided. One of these, from the Bodleian Library,\r\nis here figured (fig. 79). It was also usual to provide a slit in this\r\ndesk, about 2 in. wide, as close as possible to the shelf, for the chain\r\nattached to the book in use to pass through. This is well shewn in the\r\nview of a single book-case in Merton College, Oxford (fig. 83).\r\n\r\nI will next describe the library of Merton College, Oxford. There is still\r\nconsiderable doubt respecting the date of some of the bookcases, but the\r\nappearance of the library is so venerable, so unlike any similar room with\r\nwhich I am acquainted, that it must always command admiration, and deserve\r\nstudy[335].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 80. Exterior of the Library at Merton College, Oxford,\r\nas seen from 'Mob Quadrangle.'\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph by H. W. Taunt, 1899.]\r\n\r\nThe library occupies the whole of the first floor of the south side of\r\n\"Mob Quadrangle\" and the greater part of the same floor of the west side\r\n(fig. 80). It is entered through a doorway in the south-western angle of\r\nthe court, whence a staircase leads up to the vestibule (fig. 81). This\r\nroom is separated from the two divisions of the library by lofty oak\r\nscreens, elaborately carved and ornamented in the style of the early\r\nrenaissance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 79. Hook to hold up the desk. Bodleian Library,\r\nOxford.]\r\n\r\nThe two rooms into which the library is divided have a uniform width of 20\r\nft. 6 in. The west room, called by tradition Old Library, is 38 ft. 6 in.\r\nlong (A, B, fig. 81); the south room, or New Library, is 56 ft. 6 in. long\r\n(C, D, fig. 81).\r\n\r\nThe west room is lighted by seven equidistant lancet windows in each of\r\nthe west and east walls, and by two dormer windows of peculiar design on\r\nthe side of the roof next to the court. The south room is similarly\r\nlighted by ten lancets in each of the north and south walls, and on the\r\nside next to the court by two dormer windows like those in the west room.\r\nThis room moreover has an open space at the east end, about 10 ft. long,\r\nlighted by a window of two lights in each of the north and south walls\r\nrespectively, and by an oriel of five lights in the east wall. In both\r\nrooms there is a waggon-roof of five cants boarded, and divided into\r\npanels by molded ribs with little bosses at the intersections (fig. 82).\r\n\r\nThe blank wall at the north end of the west room is panelled with oak of\r\nan elaborate and beautiful design for a height of about 12 ft. (fig. 82).\r\nThe space above this is decorated with panels of plaster-work. The large\r\nsquare central panel contains the arms of the college; the circular panel\r\nto the west those of John Whitgift (Archbishop of Canterbury 1583-1604);\r\nand the similar panel to the east those of Sir Henry Savile (Warden\r\n1585-1621).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 81. Ground-plan of the Library at Merton College,\r\nOxford.]\r\n\r\nThe east end of the south room is similarly treated, but the oak panelling\r\nis less elaborate. In the plaster-work above it the arms of the college\r\nare flanked on the north by those of George Abbot (Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury 1611-1633) and on the south by those of Sir Nathaniel Brent\r\n(Warden 1621-1651).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 82. Interior of the west Library at Merton College,\r\nOxford.\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph by H. W. Taunt, 1899.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 83. Bookcase in the west Library of Merton College,\r\nOxford.\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph by H. W. Taunt, 1899.]\r\n\r\nBoth rooms are floored with rough oak planking. On this are laid four\r\nsleepers, each about 5 in. square, parallel with the side-walls. The two\r\ncentral sleepers have their outside edge roughly chamfered. Into these the\r\nbookcases and the seats are morticed. The central alley, 5 ft. wide, is in\r\nboth rooms paved with encaustic tiles.\r\n\r\nIn the west room there are twelve complete cases and four half-cases; in\r\nthe south room there are twenty complete cases and two half-cases (fig.\r\n81); in both rooms arranged in the usual manner with respect to the walls\r\nand windows.\r\n\r\nIn order to present as vivid an idea as possible of these beautiful cases,\r\nI reproduce here a photograph of a single compartment from the west\r\nlibrary, with a seated reader at work (fig. 83). The case is made to look\r\nrather higher than it really is, but this distortion can be easily\r\ncorrected by comparing the height of the standard with that of the seated\r\nfigure.\r\n\r\nIn the west room each case (figs. 82, 83) is 7 ft. 5 in. long, 1 ft. 5 in.\r\nwide and 6 ft. high from the top of the sleeper to the top of the cornice.\r\nThe material is oak. The ends are nearly 2 in. thick, and next the wall\r\nare shaped roughly with an adze. Each case is separated into two divisions\r\nby a central partition; and originally there was a desk 1 ft. 3 in. wide\r\non each side of the case. These desks were immoveable, and nailed to rough\r\nbrackets. There were two shelves only to each case: one just above the\r\nlevel of the desk, and a second about half-way between it and the cornice\r\n(fig. 84).\r\n\r\nThe system of ironwork by which the books were secured can be easily\r\nrecovered by studying the scars on the ends of the cases next the central\r\nalley. At the lower end of the standard, two feet from the ground, was an\r\niron bar which carried the chains of all the books which stood on the\r\nshelf just above the level of the desk, without reference to the side from\r\nwhich they were to be consulted. This bar was secured by a separate hasp\r\nand lock. The bars for the upper shelf, one on each side of the case, were\r\nobviously secured by a system similar to that described above at Hereford\r\nand Corpus Christi College. The whole system has been indicated on the\r\nelevation (fig. 84), which should be compared with the reproduction of one\r\nof the cases in the west room (fig. 83). Originally no books stood below\r\nthe desk. The comfort of readers was considered by the insertion of a bar\r\nof wood to rest the feet on, between the seat and the bookcase (fig. 84).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 84. Elevation of a bookcase and seat in the West\r\nLibrary at Merton College, Oxford.\r\n\r\nMeasured and drawn by T. D. Atkinson, Architect.]\r\n\r\nIn the south room the cases are on the same general plan as in the west\r\nroom; but the system of chaining appears to have been slightly different,\r\nand to have approximated more closely to what I may call the Hereford\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nIn both rooms each case has a picturesque enrichment at the end of the\r\nstandard above the cornice, and a small oblong frame just below it to\r\ncontain the general title of the books within the case. The west room is\r\ndevoted to LIBRI ARTIUM, with the exception of the three cases and the\r\nhalf-case at the north end of the east side, which are marked CODICES MSS.\r\nThese are protected by latticed doors of wood. In the south room the\r\ncases on the south side are all lettered L. THEOLOGIAE; on the north side\r\nthe first three are lettered L. MEDICINAE; the next L. MEDIC. IURISPP. and\r\nthe last five L. IURIS PRVDENTIAE. In this room the last cases at the east\r\nend on each side have latticed doors like those on the corresponding cases\r\nin the west room.\r\n\r\nThe building of this library is recorded in four separate account-rolls\r\nextending from the beginning of the first year of Richard II. to the third\r\nyear of the same king, that is from 1377 to 1379. From these documents it\r\nappears that the building cost L462. 1_s._ 11 1/2_d._\r\n\r\nFrom this first construction to the beginning of the sixteenth century--a\r\nspace of 125 years--the accounts furnish us with no information; but, from\r\nwhat we learn afterwards, it would appear that the internal walls were\r\nunplastered, that the roof-timbers were unprotected, and that the only\r\nlight was admitted through the narrow lancet windows.\r\n\r\nIn 1502-3 the panel-work (_celatura_) on the roof of the west library was\r\nput up at a cost of L27. 6_s._ 0_d._ The account contains also a charge\r\nfor painting the bosses (_nodi_) at the intersection of the moldings that\r\nseparate the panels. Mr Henderson points out that these ornaments prove\r\nthe existing ceiling to be that put up in 1503; for among them are the\r\nTudor Rose, the dolphin of Fitzjames (Warden 1483-1507). and the Royal\r\nArms used from Henry IV. to Elizabeth, but altered by James I.\r\n\r\nAfter this another long interval occurs during which no work done to the\r\nlibrary is recorded; but in 1623 the south room was taken in hand, and the\r\nchanges introduced into it were so extensive that it is referred to in the\r\naccounts as New Library (_Nova Bibliotheca_) a name which it still\r\nretains.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the room at the east end (fig. 81) was thrown into it,\r\nand the oriel window constructed, together with the two large dormers on\r\nthe side next the court (fig. 80). These works, by which light was so\r\nlargely increased, prove how gloomy the library must have been before they\r\nwere undertaken. Next, after important repairs to the walls and floor, and\r\nthe construction of the decorative plaster-work at the east end, the old\r\nbookcases were sold, and Benet the joiner supplied twenty new cases and\r\none half-case. The only old case remaining is, by tradition, the half-case\r\nagainst the screen on the north side as one enters from the vestibule.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore certain that the cases and seats in the south room date\r\nfrom 1623. It is unfortunately equally certain that we know nothing about\r\nthe date of those in the west room; and we are therefore unable to say\r\nwhether the cases in the south room were copied from them in 1623, or\r\nwhether the reverse process took place at some unknown date. If we adopt\r\nthe pleasing theory that in the west room we have very early cases,\r\nconstructed possibly when the library was built, we must still admit that\r\nthese relics of a remote past have been altered at some subsequent period,\r\nso as to be brought into conformity with the cases in the south room; for\r\nthe cornices and the frames for the titles are precisely similar in the\r\ntwo rooms.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two sets of cases in the method of chaining, to\r\nwhich attention has been already drawn, may bear on the question of date.\r\nAs time went on chaining would be modified in the direction of simplicity;\r\nand to replace a single central bar by two lateral ones is a step towards\r\nthis, for under such conditions the addition or removal of a book would\r\nentail less displacement. Further, it must be recognised that these cases,\r\nwhether extremely ancient or comparatively modern, differ in many\r\nparticulars from those to be met with elsewhere. They are lighter,\r\nnarrower and more elegant. Again, when the ground-plan of the library is\r\nconsidered (fig. 81) it will be seen that their ends occupy nearly the\r\nwhole space between a pair of windows. In other examples of the\r\nstall-system this is not the case.\r\n\r\nThe only explanation I have to offer for the whole difficulty is the\r\nfollowing. The library was constructed for the lectern-system, with\r\nwall-spaces not more than 2 ft. wide, and was so fitted up. When books had\r\nbecome numerous the western library was taken in hand, and the lecterns\r\naltered into stalls, the single central bar being retained. At the same\r\ntime, in all probability, the dormers were inserted. It is remarkable that\r\nthese changes should not be recorded in the accounts, but possibly they\r\nwere carried out as the result of a special benefaction[336]. In 1623 the\r\nstalls which had been placed in the west room, having been found\r\nconvenient, were copied for the south room.\r\n\r\nI will in the next place briefly notice the distinctive points of the\r\nother examples of the stall-system in Oxford.\r\n\r\nAt S. John Baptist's College the library was built in 1596, and we may\r\npresume was fitted up soon afterwards, as Wood records numerous donations\r\nof books in the years immediately succeeding, and the appointment of a\r\nkeeper to take charge of them in 1603[337]. This library, on the first\r\nfloor of the south side of the second quadrangle, is 112 feet long by 26\r\nfeet wide, with eight windows of two lights in each wall. The bookcases,\r\nof which there are eight on each side between the windows, with a\r\nhalf-case against the west wall, are rather larger than those at Corpus\r\nChristi College, being 10 feet high, and 2 feet 6 inches wide. They have a\r\nclassical cornice and terminal pediment. The titles of the subjects are\r\npainted at the tops of the stalls as at Merton College. A few traces of\r\nchaining are still to be detected. The desks have not been altered. Each\r\nis in two divisions, as at Corpus, separated by a central bracket, and it\r\nhas the slit to admit the chains. The long iron hinges are evidently\r\noriginal. The seats resemble those at Corpus.\r\n\r\nThe bookcases at Trinity College, set up in 1618, and those at Jesus\r\nCollege, made probably in 1679, call for no special remark.\r\n\r\nBetween 1598 and 1600 Sir Thomas Bodley refitted the library over the\r\nDivinity School. This noble room is 86 feet long by 32 feet wide. These\r\ndimensions contrast forcibly with those of the long narrow rooms to which\r\nwe have been accustomed; and it is probably on account of the great width\r\nthat the 10 windows on each side have two lights apiece. At right angles\r\nto these walls, which face north and south, there are nine bookcases on a\r\nside with a half-case at each end. Here again we find so close a\r\nresemblance to the cases at Corpus Christi College, that a particular\r\ndescription is unnecessary. It should be noted, however, that, as at S.\r\nJohn's College, they had been made of a greater height (8 feet 4 inches)\r\nin the first instance, so as to accommodate two shelves above that on the\r\nlevel of the desk. These shelves are proved to be original by the\r\nexistence, at the juncture of the shelves with the upright divisions, of\r\nthe plates of iron which originally carried the sockets for the bar. The\r\nrest of the ironwork has been removed, and it is difficult to detect\r\ntraces of its former existence, because modern shelves have been set\r\nagainst the ends of the cases. The hole for the lowest bar, however,\r\nremains in the same relative position as at Corpus Christi College; and,\r\nas the ironwork for supporting the bars is identical with what still\r\nremains there, it seems safe to conclude that no new principle was\r\nintroduced. The desks are modern, but the large and ornamental brackets\r\nwhich support them are original, and the iron hooks (fig. 79) still remain\r\nby which they were prevented from falling when turned up. The position of\r\nthese hooks shews that each desk was 19 inches broad. There were\r\noriginally seats between each pair of cases, as may be seen in Loggan's\r\nview of the interior of the library, where their ends are distinctly\r\nshewn.\r\n\r\nA special feature of this room is the beautiful open roof, practically\r\nthat which Sir Thomas Bodley put up in 1599. The principals and tie-beams\r\nare ornamented with arabesques, while the flat surface between them is\r\ndivided into square compartments on which are painted the arms of the\r\nUniversity. On the bosses that intervene between these compartments are\r\nthe arms of Bodley himself.\r\n\r\nI mentioned at the beginning of this chapter that the stall-system had\r\nbeen represented in the library at Clare College, Cambridge. The old\r\nlibrary was a long narrow room over the old chapel, and we know on the\r\nauthority of William Cole[338] that it was \"fitted up with wainscote\r\nClasses on both sides.\" These \"classes\" had been put up shortly before\r\n1627, when the Duke of Buckingham, then Chancellor of the University, was\r\ntaken to see them. When this library was pulled down in 1763 they were\r\nremoved to the new library which had been fitted up 20 years previously,\r\nand ranged round the room in front of the modern shelves. They are\r\nsplendid specimens of carpentry-work, and bear so close a resemblance to\r\nthe cases in the library of S. John's College, that it may be assumed that\r\nthey were copied from them[339]. When the removal took place they were a\r\ngood deal altered, and a few years ago some fragments which had not been\r\nutilised were found in a lumber-closet. One of the standards (fig. 85),\r\nwith its brackets, shews that the cases were once fitted with desks, the\r\nremoval of which was ingeniously concealed by the insertion of slips of\r\nwood in the style of the older work[340]. I have not been able to discover\r\nany traces of chaining, but as there are a number of seats in the library,\r\nvery like those in Corpus Christi College, Oxford, it is more than\r\nprobable that chains were once employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 85. Stall-end in the Library of Clare College,\r\nCambridge.]\r\n\r\nThe stall-system was not only popular in Oxford itself, but was adopted as\r\na standard for bookcases, and reproduced elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe first example I will cite is at Westminster Abbey[341], where part of\r\nthe dorter was fitted up as a library during the years 1623 and 1624 by\r\nJohn Williams, Bishop of Lincoln and afterwards Archbishop of York, who\r\nwas dean of Westminster from 1620 to his death in 1650. In the flowery\r\nrhetoric of his biographer Bishop Hacket:\r\n\r\n    With the same Generosity and strong propension of mind\r\n    to enlarge the Boundaries of Learning, he converted a\r\n    wast Room, scituate in the East side of the Cloysters,\r\n    into _Plato's_ Portico, into a goodly Library; model'd\r\n    it into decent shape, furnished it with Desks and\r\n    Chains, accoutred it with all Utensils, and stored it\r\n    with a vast Number of Learned Volumes[342].\r\n\r\nThis library--which has not been materially altered since 1625--occupies\r\nthe north end of what was once the dorter. It is 60 feet long, by 33 feet\r\n4 inches broad. There are twelve bookcases--evidently the \"desks\" recorded\r\nby Williams' biographer. Each is 10 feet 10 inches long, 2 feet broad, and\r\n8 feet 3 inches high, divided by plain uprights into three compartments.\r\nThere are three shelves, below which is a desk for the reader, resting on\r\nbrackets, and provided with the usual slit for the chains to pass through.\r\nThese desks are hinged. The cases are quite plain, with the exception of a\r\nmolded cornice; above which, on the end of each, is some scroll-work.\r\nThere is also a small frame to contain the catalogue. It is probable that\r\nthere were originally seats for readers between each pair of cases. I\r\ncannot discover any certain evidence of chaining, and yet \"chains\" are\r\ndistinctly enumerated among the dean's benefactions. There are faint scars\r\nat the intersection of some of the shelves and uprights which may be\r\nscrewholes--but I cannot feel certain on the point.\r\n\r\nI have already given the plan of the cathedral library at Wells (fig. 42).\r\nAfter the Restoration this building was re-fitted during the episcopate of\r\nRobert Creighton (Bishop 1670-1672), with the help of donations from the\r\ncelebrated Dr Richard Busby, and Dr Ralph Bathurst, who was dean from 1670\r\nto 1704. It is important to remember that Bathurst was also master of\r\nTrinity College, Oxford, an office which he retained until his death. As\r\nhe is described in the MS. List of Benefactors preserved in the library as\r\nhaving taken a foremost part in fitting it up (in _Bibliotheca hac\r\ninstauranda_ [Greek: ergodioktes]), the selection of the bookcases may\r\nwith much probability be ascribed to him. His own college has still\r\nbookcases which once must have been excellent specimens of the\r\nstall-system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 87. Bookcases in the Library of Durham Cathedral.\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph.]\r\n\r\nThere are eight bookcases at Wells, of plain unpainted deal, projecting\r\nfrom the west wall between the windows (fig. 42). They are 8 ft. 6 in.\r\nlong, 8 ft. 1 in. high and 3 ft. broad. Seven of them have desks on both\r\nsides, but the last--that placed against the partition at the south end,\r\nwhich screens off a small room for a study--has a desk on one side only.\r\nThere is no shelf below the desk, but two above it. They are fitted with\r\nthe usual apparatus for chaining. Between each pair of bookcases, in front\r\nof the window, is a seat for the reader. These cases resemble so closely\r\nthose at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, that the source from which they\r\nwere derived cannot be doubtful.\r\n\r\nWas this library ever chained? A Walton's Polyglot, 1657, had evidently\r\nbeen prepared for chaining, and in a novel fashion, the plate to carry the\r\nchain being attached to the left-hand board close to the back of the\r\nvolume (fig. 86)--so that it was evidently set on the shelf in the\r\nordinary way, and not with the fore-edge turned to the spectator, as is\r\nusual in chained libraries. But with this exception I could not discover\r\nindications of the attachment of a plate on any of the volumes. If I am\r\nright in concluding that the books in this library were never chained, the\r\ncases are a curious instance of the maintenance of fashion. Dean Bathurst\r\nordered a bookcase, and it was supplied to him with all its fittings\r\ncomplete, whether they were to be used or not.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 86. Ring for attachment of chain, Wells.]\r\n\r\nMy last example is from Durham Cathedral, where John Sudbury, dean from\r\n1661 to 1684, fitted up the ancient Frater as a library. The room is about\r\n115 feet long by 30 feet wide, with nine windows in each side-wall. Their\r\nsills are ten feet from the ground.\r\n\r\nThe cases (fig. 87) are evidently the work of a carpenter who was\r\nthoroughly conversant with the stall-system. They had originally two\r\nshelves only above the desk, the entablature, now visible on the ends\r\nonly, being carried along the sides. The shelf below the desk is also\r\nmodern. These cases are ten feet apart, and between each pair, instead of\r\na reader's seat, is a dwarf bookcase terminating in a desk. Attached to it\r\non each side is a seat conveniently placed for a reader to use the desk on\r\nthe side of the principal case.\r\n\r\nI have shewn that the stall-system made its appearance at Oxford early in\r\nthe sixteenth century, but I have not been able to discover who introduced\r\nit. My own impression is that it was monastic in its origin; and I can\r\nprove that it fits at least two monastic libraries exactly. This theory\r\nwill also explain the prevalence of such cases at Oxford, and their almost\r\ntotal absence from Cambridge, where monastic influence was never exercised\r\nto the same extent.\r\n\r\nI will begin with Canterbury, where, as I mentioned above[343], the\r\nlibrary was over the Prior's Chapel. The construction of this chapel is\r\ndescribed as follows by Professor Willis:\r\n\r\n    Roger de S. Elphege, Prior from 1258 to 1263, completed\r\n    a chapel between the Dormitory and Infirmary.... The\r\n    style of its substructure shews that it was begun by his\r\n    predecessor.... [It] is placed on the south side of the\r\n    Infirmary cloister, between the Lavatory tower and\r\n    Infirmary. Its floor was on the level of the upper\r\n    gallery, and was sustained by an open vaulted ambulatory\r\n    below. This replaced the portion of the original south\r\n    alley [of the cloister] which occupied ... that\r\n    position.... But, as this new substructure was more than\r\n    twice as broad as the old one, the chapel was obtruded\r\n    into the small cloister-garth, so as to cover part of\r\n    the facade of the Infirmary Hall, diminish the already\r\n    limited area, and destroy the symmetry of its form[344].\r\n\r\nAbove this chapel Archbishop Chichele built the library which Prior\r\nSellyng fitted up. It stood east and west, and of course must have been of\r\nthe same size as the chapel beneath it, namely, according to Professor\r\nWillis, 62 feet long on the north side, 59 feet long on the south side,\r\nand 22 feet broad. The door was probably at the south-west corner, at the\r\nhead of a staircase which originally led only to the chapel beneath it.\r\n\r\nFrom these measurements I have constructed a plan of the room (fig. 88),\r\nand of the bookcases which I am about to describe. The windows are of\r\ncourse imaginary, but, I submit, justified by the uniform practice of\r\nmedieval libraries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 88. Conjectural plan of the Library over the Prior's\r\nChapel at Christ Church, Canterbury.]\r\n\r\nI am able to reconstruct this library because I have had the good fortune\r\nto come across a very curious document[345] which gives sufficient data\r\nfor the purpose. It is contained in a MS. volume, now the property of the\r\nDean and Chapter of Canterbury, composed of several quires of paper\r\nstitched into a parchment cover. They once belonged to, and were probably\r\nwritten by, Brother William Ingram, who was _custos martirii_ in 1503; and\r\nin June 1511 was promoted to the office of Pitancer. The accounts and\r\nmemoranda in the book are of a very miscellaneous character. The part\r\nwhich concerns the library consists of a note of the books which were\r\nrepaired in 1508. This is headed:\r\n\r\n    Repairs done to the books contained in the library over\r\n    the chapel of our lord the Prior, namely, in new byndyng\r\n    and bordyng with covers and claspyng and chenyng,\r\n    together with sundry books of the gift of the aforesaid\r\n    Prior, namely, in the year of our Lord 1508, and the\r\n    year of the reign of King Henry VII., 23[346].\r\n\r\nThe writer goes round the room, beginning at the west end. He proceeds\r\nalong the north side, and returns along the south side, to the point\r\nwhence he started, enumerating on his way the bookcases and their shelves,\r\nthe volumes removed, and, occasionally, a note of the repairs required.\r\nFor my present purpose I will content myself with his account of a single\r\nbookcase, the first on the list. The writer begins thus: \"From the upper\r\nshelf on the east side in the first seat (_de superiori textu[347] ex\r\norienti parte in prima_ (sic) _sedile_).\" Three volumes are enumerated.\r\n\"From the lower shelf (_de inferiori textu_),\" two volumes. \"From the\r\nupper shelf on the other side of the same seat (_de superiori textu ex\r\naltera parte eiusdem sedilis_),\" seven volumes. \"From the lower shelf (_de\r\ninferiori textu_),\" five volumes. In this way eight seats, i.e. bookcases,\r\nare gone through on this side of the room. The writer next turns his\r\nattention to the south side, and goes through eight more seats, beginning\r\nwith: \"From the east side of the upper shelf on the south side (_de textu\r\nsuperiori ex parte australi incipiendo. In parte orientali_).\" The\r\nexamination was evidently thorough, and, as the same number of seats is\r\nenumerated for each side of the room, we may, I think, safely conclude\r\nthat all were examined, and that the whole number in the library was\r\nsixteen.\r\n\r\nThe passages I have quoted shew that each of these bookcases had an upper\r\nand lower shelf on each side, on which the books stood, so as to be\r\nconveniently consulted by readers on each side; the books were chained;\r\nand, in consequence, there must have been a desk, presumably below the\r\nshelves on each side; and a seat for the reader. I have embodied these\r\nrequirements in the accompanying sketch or diagram (fig. 89), which\r\nindicates a bookcase of the same type as those at Corpus Christi College,\r\nOxford. If we may suppose that each of these cases was two feet wide and\r\neight feet long like those at Merton College, we can accommodate eight\r\ncases on each side of the room (fig. 88), with the same interval between\r\neach pair as at that college.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 89. Sketch of the probable appearance of a bookcase,\r\nand a reader's seat, in the Library at Christ Church, Canterbury.]\r\n\r\nLet us now consider whether the library as thus arranged would have had\r\nsufficient shelf-room. Each bookcase being 8 feet long would contain 32\r\nfeet of shelving, and the 16 cases a total of 512 feet. The catalogue made\r\nin the time of Prior Henry of Eastry (1285-1331) enumerates 1850\r\nvolumes[348]. If we allow two feet and a half for every ten of these we\r\nshall require 462 1/2 feet; or in other words we can arrange the whole\r\ncollection in 14 stalls, leaving 2 over for the additions which must have\r\nbeen made in the interval between the middle of the 14th century and the\r\ndate of Brother Ingram's researches.\r\n\r\nIf the sketch here given of the probable aspect of the library at Christ\r\nChurch, Canterbury, be compared with the view of the library at Merton\r\nCollege, Oxford (fig. 82), a fairly correct idea of a great conventual\r\nlibrary will be obtained. A very slight effort of imagination is needed to\r\nmake the necessary changes in the shelves, and to replace academic\r\nstudents by Benedictine monks. Then, if we conceive the shelves to be\r\nloaded with manuscripts, many of which were written in the early days of\r\nthe English Church, we shall be able to realise the feelings of Leland on\r\nentering the library at Glastonbury:\r\n\r\n    I had hardly crossed the threshold when the mere sight\r\n    of books remarkable for their vast antiquity filled me\r\n    with awe, or I might almost say with bewilderment: so\r\n    that for a moment I could not move a step forward[349].\r\n\r\nI propose in the next place to print a translation of the Introduction to\r\nthe catalogue[350] of the Benedictine Priory of S. Martin at Dover, which\r\nwas a cell to Canterbury made in 1389 by John Whytfeld. This catalogue\r\ndoes not indicate the stall-system; in fact I am at a loss to define the\r\nprecise system which it does indicate. I print it in this place on account\r\nof its internal interest, and the evidence which it affords of the care\r\ntaken in the last quarter of the fourteenth century to make books easily\r\naccessible to scholars.\r\n\r\n    The present Register of the Library of the Priory of\r\n    Dover, compiled in the year of the Lord's Incarnation\r\n    1389 under the presidency of John Neunam prior and monk\r\n    of the said church, is separated into three main\r\n    divisions. The object is that the first part may supply\r\n    information to the precentor of the house concerning the\r\n    number of the books and the complete knowledge of them:\r\n    that the second part may stir up studious brethren to\r\n    eager and frequent reading: and that the third part may\r\n    point out the way to the speedy finding of individual\r\n    treatises by the scholars. Now although a brief special\r\n    preface is prefixed to each part to facilitate the\r\n    understanding of it, to this first part certain general\r\n    notes are prefixed, to begin with, for the more plain\r\n    understanding of the whole Register.\r\n\r\n    Be it noted, then, first, that this whole Library is\r\n    divided into nine several classes (Distinctions), marked\r\n    according to the nine first letters of the alphabet,\r\n    which are affixed to the classes themselves, in such a\r\n    way that A marks out to him who enters the first Class,\r\n    B the second, C the third, and so on in order. Each of\r\n    the said nine classes, moreover, will be seen to be\r\n    divided into seven shelves (grades), which are also\r\n    marked off by the addition of Roman numeral figures,\r\n    following the letters which denote the classes. We begin\r\n    the numbering of the shelves from the bottom, and\r\n    proceed upwards so that the bottom shelf, which is the\r\n    first, is marked thus, I; the second thus, II; the third\r\n    thus, III; and so the numbering goes, on up to\r\n    seven[351].\r\n\r\n    In addition to this, the books of the Library are all of\r\n    them marked on each leaf with Arabic numerals, to\r\n    facilitate the ascertaining of the contents of the\r\n    volumes.\r\n\r\n    Now since many of the volumes contain a number of\r\n    treatises, the names of these treatises, although they\r\n    have not always been correctly christened, are written\r\n    down under each volume, and an Arabic numeral is added\r\n    to each name shewing on what leaf each tract begins. To\r\n    this number the letter A or B is subjoined, the letter A\r\n    here denoting the first page of the leaf, and the letter\r\n    B the second. The books themselves, furthermore, have\r\n    their class-letters and also their shelf-marks inserted\r\n    not only outside on their bindings, but also inside,\r\n    accompanying the tables of contents at the beginning. To\r\n    such class-letters a small Arabic figure is added which\r\n    shews clearly what position the book occupies in the\r\n    order of placing on the shelf concerned.\r\n\r\n    On the second, third, or fourth leaf of the book, or\r\n    thereabouts, on the lower margin the name of the book is\r\n    written. Before it are entered the above-mentioned\r\n    class-letters and shelf-numbers, and after it (a small\r\n    space intervening) are immediately set down the words\r\n    with which that leaf begins, which I shall call the\r\n    proof of investigation (_probatorium cognitionis_). The\r\n    Arabic figures next following will state how many leaves\r\n    are contained in the whole volume; and finally another\r\n    numeral immediately following the last clearly sets\r\n    forth the number of the tracts contained in the said\r\n    volume.\r\n\r\n    If then the above facts be securely entrusted to a\r\n    retentive memory it will be clearly seen in what class,\r\n    shelf, place and order each book of the whole Library\r\n    ought to be put, and on what leaf and which side of the\r\n    leaf the beginnings of the several treatises may be\r\n    found. For it has been the object of the compiler of\r\n    this present register [and] of the Library, by setting\r\n    forth a variety of such marks and notations of classes,\r\n    shelves, order, pagination, treatises and volumes, to\r\n    insure for his monastery security from loss in time to\r\n    come, to shut the door against the spite of such as\r\n    might wish to despoil or bargain away such a treasure,\r\n    and to set up a sure bulwark of defence and resistance.\r\n    And in truth the compiler will not be offended but will\r\n    honestly love anyone who shall bring this\r\n    register--which is still faulty in many respects--into\r\n    better order, even if he should see fit to place his own\r\n    name at the head of the whole work.\r\n\r\n    In the first part of the register, therefore, we have\r\n    throughout at the top, between black lines ruled\r\n    horizontally, first the class-letter, in red, and,\r\n    following it, the shelf-mark, in black characters\r\n    (_tetris signaculis_). Then again between other lines\r\n    ruled in red, vertically: first, on the left a numeral\r\n    shewing the place of the book in order on its shelf:\r\n    then the name of the volume: thirdly, the number of the\r\n    \"probatory\" leaf; fourthly, the \"probatory\" words (in\r\n    the case of which, by the way, reference is made to the\r\n    text and not to the gloss); fifthly, the number of\r\n    leaves in the whole volume; and, lastly, the number of\r\n    the treatises contained in it--all written within the\r\n    aforesaid lines. In addition there will be left in each\r\n    shelf of this part, at the end, some vacant space, in\r\n    which the names of books that may be subsequently\r\n    acquired can be placed[352].\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the word \"distinction\" is the principal difficulty in the\r\nway of understanding the above description. I thought at first that it\r\ndenoted merely difference of subject, and that _gradus_, as in the\r\ncatalogue of Queens' College, Cambridge, was a side of a lectern. But the\r\nstatement that the grades are numbered \"from the bottom and proceed\r\nupwards\" can hardly be reconciled with any arrangement of lecterns.\r\n_Distinctio_ probably denotes a bookcase or press, divided into 7 grades,\r\nand probably placed against the wall, the word _gradus_ here meaning a\r\nflat shelf, instead of one set at an angle as in former instances. If this\r\nexplanation be correct we have here a very early instance of shelves in\r\nsuch a position.\r\n\r\nMy second example of a monastic library fitted up according to the\r\nstall-system is the library at Clairvaux. As I have already printed a full\r\ndescription of it[353], I need not do more in this place than translate\r\nthe passage referring to the fittings:\r\n\r\n    This library is 189 feet long, by 51 feet wide[354]. In\r\n    it are 48 seats (_bancs_), and in each seat 4 shelves\r\n    (_poulpitres_) furnished with books on all subjects, but\r\n    chiefly theology.... The building that contains the said\r\n    library is magnificent, built of stone, and excellently\r\n    well lighted on both sides with five large windows, well\r\n    glazed.\r\n\r\nAs there were so many as 48 bookcases, that is, 24 on each side, the\r\nbookcases were evidently spaced without reference to the lateral windows,\r\nwhich were probably raised high above the floor.\r\n\r\nThe catalogue, from which I have already quoted the verses commemorating\r\nthe building of the library, contains much useful information respecting\r\nthe arrangement of the books. The verses are succeeded by the following\r\nintroductory note:\r\n\r\n    Repertorium omnium librorum in hac Clarevallis\r\n    biblioteca existentium a fratre Mathurino de cangeyo\r\n    eiusdem loci monacho non sine magno labore editum.\r\n\r\n                            Lege\r\n\r\n    Pro intelligentia presentis tabule seu Repertorii,\r\n    sciendum est quod a parte aquilonari collocantur libri\r\n    quorum litere capitales nigre sunt, quorum vero rubre a\r\n    parte australi. Et omnes in ea ordine alphabetico\r\n    scribuntur.\r\n\r\n    Utriusque autem partis primum analogium per litteram A\r\n    signatur, secundum per litteram B, tercium per litteram\r\n    C, quartum per litteram D, quintum per litteram E. Et\r\n    consequenter cetera analogia per sequentes litteras\r\n    alphabeticas.\r\n\r\n    Quodlibet autem analogium quatuor habet partes, quarum\r\n    prima signatur per litteram A, secunda per B, tercia per\r\n    C, quarta per D.\r\n\r\n    Prime partis primi analogii primus liber signatur per A.\r\n    a. 1, secundus per A. a. 2, tercius per A. a. 3, et\r\n    consequenter.\r\n\r\n    Secunde partis primus liber signatur per A. b. 1,\r\n    secundus per A. b. 2; et de consequentibus similis est\r\n    ordinatio.\r\n\r\n    Tercie partis primus liber signatur per A. c. 1,\r\n    secundus per A. c. 2; et consequenter.\r\n\r\n    Quarte partis primus liber signatur per A. d. 1,\r\n    secundus per A. d. 2; et consequenter.\r\n\r\n    [In this way five \"analogia\" are enumerated.]\r\n\r\n    Et eadem est disciplina et ordinacio de ceteris\r\n    analogiis prout habetur in novissimo quaternione eiusdem\r\n    tabule, immo et in fronte cuiuslibet analogii in tabella\r\n    eidem appendente.\r\n\r\n    Hanc tabulam seu repertorium scripsit quondam frater\r\n    Petrus mauray de Arecis oriundus. Vivus vel defunctus\r\n    requiescat in bona semper pace. Amen.\r\n\r\nThe most important passage in the above note may be thus translated:\r\n\r\n                            Read\r\n\r\n    For the right understanding of the present table or\r\n    method of finding books (_tabule seu repertorii_), you\r\n    must know that on the north side are ranged those books\r\n    whereof the capital letters are black; on the south side\r\n    those whereof the capital letters are red. All are set\r\n    down in alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n    On each side the first desk (_analogium_) is marked by\r\n    the letter A; the second by the letter B; [and so\r\n    forth].\r\n\r\n    Each desk has four divisions, the first of which is\r\n    marked by the letter _a_, the second by the letter _b_,\r\n    the third by the letter _c_, the fourth by the letter\r\n    _d_. The first book on the first shelf of the first desk\r\n    is marked A. a. i; the second A. a. ii; [and so forth].\r\n\r\nThe catalogue as well as the description makes it perfectly clear that\r\neach desk, that is to say, each bookcase, had four shelves; and further,\r\nas the authors of the _Voyage Litteraire_ (1708) mention chains[355], it\r\nmay be concluded that there were desks, and seats for readers, between\r\neach pair of bookcases. If we place two shelves on each side of the case\r\nwe get a piece of furniture precisely similar to that in use at\r\nCanterbury.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[332] Macray, _Annals of the Bodleian Library_, p. 7.

LIBRARIES AT CESENA, AT THE CONVENT OF S.\r\nMARK, FLORENCE, AND AT MONTE OLIVETO. VATICAN LIBRARY OF SIXTUS IV. DUCAL\r\nLIBRARY AT URBINO. MEDICEAN LIBRARY, FLORENCE. SYSTEM OF CHAINING THERE\r\nUSED. CHARACTERISTICS OF MEDIEVAL LIBRARIES. NAMES OF MEDIEVAL BOOKCASES\r\nAND BOOKSHELVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the \"stall-system\" was being generally adopted in England and in\r\nFrance, a different plan was being developed in Italy. It consisted in a\r\nreturn to the \"lectern-system,\" with the addition of a shelf below the\r\nlectern, on which the books lay on their sides when not wanted; and an\r\ningenious combination of a seat for the reader with the desk and shelf.\r\n\r\nThe earliest library fitted up in this manner that I have been able to\r\ndiscover is at Cesena, a city of north Italy between Forli and Ravenna. It\r\nis practically in its original condition.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century Cesena was governed by the powerful family of\r\nMalatesta, one of whom, Domenico Malatesta Novello, built the library in\r\n1452, and placed it under the charge of the convent of S. Francesco. Two\r\nburghers were associated with the Friars in this duty. The library was\r\nalways public. It was designed by Matteo Nuzio of Fano, a celebrated\r\narchitect of the day, as we learn from an inscription originally inserted\r\ninto the wall on the right of the door of entrance, but now placed inside\r\nthe library:\r\n\r\n                    MATHEVS. NVTIVS.\r\n               FANENSI EX VRBE. CREATVS.\r\n                 DEDALVS ALTER. OPVS.\r\n              TANTVM. DEDVXIT. AD VNGVEM.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figs. 90, 91. Ground-plan and section of Library at\r\nCesena.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 92. General view of the Library at Cesena.\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph.]\r\n\r\nThe general plan and arrangement will be readily understood from the\r\nground-plan (fig. 90), and the longitudinal section (fig. 91), copied on a\r\nreduced scale from those given by the learned Giuseppe Maria Muccioli, who\r\npublished a catalogue of the MSS. in the library in 1780[356], and also\r\nfrom the general view of the interior (fig. 92). It is a long narrow\r\nbuilding, 133 ft. 4 in. long, by 34 ft. broad[357], standing east and\r\nwest, so that its windows face north and south. It is on the first floor,\r\nbeing built over some rooms which once belonged to the convent, and is\r\nentered at the west end through a lofty marble doorway. Internally it is\r\ndivided into three aisles, of which the central is the narrowest, by two\r\nrows of ten fluted marble columns. Against the side-walls and partly\r\nengaged in them, are two rows of similar columns. The aisles are divided\r\nby plain quadripartite vaults, resting partly on the central columns,\r\npartly on those engaged in the side-walls, into eleven bays, each lighted\r\nby two windows (fig. 91). These aisles are about 12 ft. wide. The central\r\naisle, 8 ft. 3 in. wide between the columns, has a plain barrel vault,\r\nextending from end to end of the building.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the Renaissance may readily be detected in the\r\nornamentation of the columns, but traces of medieval forms still linger in\r\nthe room. If the central alley were wider it might be taken for the nave\r\nof a basilica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 93. Bookcases at west end of south side of Library,\r\nCesena.]\r\n\r\nThere are 29 bookcases in each aisle. Between each pair of cases there is\r\na wooden floor, raised 3 1/2 in. above the general level of the room; and\r\nthere is an interval of 2 ft. 3 in. between the cases and the wall, so\r\nthat access may be readily obtained to them from either end. The room is\r\npaved with unglazed tiles.\r\n\r\nThe westernmost bay is empty (fig. 90), being used as a vestibule, and\r\nthe first bookcase, if I may be allowed the expression, on each side, is\r\nreally not a bookcase but a seat (fig. 93)[358].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 94. Part of a bookcase at Cesena to shew the system of\r\nchaining.]\r\n\r\nThe construction of these cases is most ingenious, both as regards\r\nconvenience and economy of space. If they were designed by the architect\r\nwho built the room, he must have been a man of no ordinary originality.\r\nEach piece of furniture consists of a desk to lay the books on when wanted\r\nfor use, a shelf for those not immediately required, and a seat for the\r\nreader, whose comfort is considered by a gentle slope in the back (fig.\r\n93). At the end next the central alley is a panel containing the heraldic\r\ndevices of the Malatesta family.\r\n\r\nThe principal dimensions of each case are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Length                       10 ft. 2 1/2 in.\r\n  Height                        4 ft. 2 1/4 in.\r\n  Width of seat                 3 ft. 1 in.\r\n  Width of foot-rest           11 in.\r\n  Height                        3 1/2 in.\r\n  Height of seat from ground    1 ft. 10 1/2 in.\r\n  Width                         1 ft. 4 in.\r\n  Distance from desk to desk    4 ft. 1 in.\r\n  Angle of slope of desk       45 deg.\r\n\r\nThe books are still attached to the desks by chains. The bar which carries\r\nthem is in full view just under the ledge of the desk (fig. 94), inserted\r\ninto massive iron stanchions nailed to the underside of the desk. There\r\nare four of these: one at each end of the desk, and one on each side of\r\nthe central standard. The bar is locked by means of a hasp attached to the\r\nstandard in which the lock is sunk.\r\n\r\nThe chains are of a novel form (fig. 95). Each link, about 2 1/4 in. long,\r\nconsists of a solid central portion, which looks as though it were cast\r\nround a bent wire, the ends of which project beyond the solid part. The\r\nchain is attached to the book by an iron hook screwed into the lower edge\r\nof the right-hand board near the back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 95. Piece of a chain, Cesena.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 96. Chained book at Ghent.]\r\n\r\nThe volume which I figure next (fig. 96), entitled _Lumen animae seu liber\r\nmoralitatum_, was printed at Eichstaedt in Bavaria, in 1479. M. Ferd.\r\nVander Haeghen, librarian of Ghent, bought it in Hungary a few years\r\nsince, and gave it to the library which he so ably directs. The chain is\r\njust 24 in. long. The links, of which there are ten, are slightly\r\ndifferent from any which I have figured, each link being compressed in the\r\nmiddle so that the two sides touch each other. There is no ring, but a\r\nlink, rather larger than the rest, is passed round the bar. It will be\r\nobserved that the chain is fastened to the left-hand board, and not to the\r\nright-hand board as in Italy. The presence of a title written on\r\nparchment kept in place by strips of leather, and five bosses of copper,\r\nshew that the left-hand board was uppermost on the desk. The position of\r\nthe chain shews that when it was attached the book was intended to lie on\r\na desk, where the bar must have been in front of, or below, the desk; but\r\nthere is also a scar on the upper edge of the right-hand board, which\r\nshews that at some previous period it lay on a desk of what I may call the\r\nZutphen type, where the bar was above the sloping surface.\r\n\r\nWith the library at Cesena may be compared that attached to the Dominican\r\nConvent of S. Mark at Florence, built in 1441 for Cosmo dei Medici--the\r\nfirst public library in Italy. It is on the first floor, and is approached\r\nby a staircase from the cloister. It is 148 ft. long by 34 ft. 6 in.\r\nwide[359], divided into three aisles by two rows of eleven columns. The\r\ncentral aisle, 9 ft. wide between the columns, has a plain barrel vault;\r\nthe side aisles, 11 ft. wide, have quadripartite vaults. In each of the\r\nside-walls there are twelve windows. In all these details the library\r\nresembles that at Cesena so closely that I cannot help suspecting that\r\nMalatesta or his architect may have copied it.\r\n\r\nThe original fittings have been removed, but we learn from the\r\ncatalogue[360] that the books were originally contained in 64 _banchi_,\r\nhalf of which were on the east side and half on the west side of the room.\r\nThere was an average of about sixteen books to each _banchus_. The\r\ncatalogue also mentions a Greek library, which had seven _banchi_ on each\r\nside. This was probably a separate room.\r\n\r\nThere is a similar library at the Benedictine Convent of Monte Oliveto,\r\nnear Siena, but it is on a much smaller scale. Like the others, it is\r\ndivided into three aisles by two rows of six columns. The central aisle\r\nhas a barrel vault, and the side aisles quadripartite vaults. It is 85 ft.\r\nlong by 32 ft. broad. There are seven windows on one side only. At the end\r\nof the library, approached by a flight of thirteen stairs, is a room of\r\nthe same width and 21 ft. long, which may have been used as an inner\r\nlibrary. An inscription over the door of entrance records that this\r\nlibrary was built in 1516[361].\r\n\r\nWhile discussing the arrangements of Italian libraries, I must not omit\r\nthat at the Convent of S. Francis at Assisi[362]. The catalogue, dated 1\r\nJanuary, 1381, shews that the library, even at that comparatively early\r\ndate, was in two divisions: (1) for the use of the brethren; (2) for loans\r\nto extraneous persons. This catalogue, after a brief preface stating that\r\nit includes \"all the books belonging to the library of the Holy Convent of\r\nS. Francis at Assisi, whether they be chained, or whether they be not\r\nchained,\" begins as follows:\r\n\r\n    In the first place we make a list of the books which are\r\n    chained to benches (_banchi_) in the Public Library as\r\n    follows, and observe that all the leaves of all the\r\n    books which are in this catalogue, whether they are in\r\n    quires of 12, 10, 8, or any other number of leaves\r\n    larger or smaller,--every one of these books contains\r\n    the denomination of the quires, as appears in the first\r\n    quire of each book on the lower margin: all the quires\r\n    being marked at beginning and end in black and red with\r\n    the figure here shewn, and the number of the quire\r\n    within it.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    Moreover, the letters of the alphabet that are placed on\r\n    the top of the covers ought all to be fairly large and\r\n    entirely black, as marked below [in this catalogue] at\r\n    the end of each book[363].\r\n\r\nThis introduction is succeeded by the list of books. They are chained to\r\nnine benches on the west side of a room, and to the same number on the\r\neast side. The total is 170.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the catalogue has the following heading:\r\n\r\n    In the name of the Lord, Amen. Here begins the list of\r\n    all the books which are in the Reserved Library\r\n    (_libraria secreta_) of the Holy Convent of S. Francis\r\n    at Assisi, appointed to be lent to prelates, masters,\r\n    readers, bachelors, and all other brethren in orders,\r\n    according as the amount of knowledge or line of study of\r\n    each demands them.\r\n\r\nThis part of the collection is contained in eleven presses (for which the\r\nunusual word _solarium_[364] is used) arranged along the east and west\r\nwalls of a room, but whether the same as the last we are not informed. The\r\nnumber of manuscripts is 530.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of the manuscripts here registered still exists.\r\nThey are well taken care of in the Town Hall, and a list of them has been\r\nprivately printed. Several are in their original condition, bound in\r\nboards about a quarter of an inch thick, covered with white leather. The\r\ntitle, written on a strip of parchment, is pasted on the top of the\r\nright-hand board. It usually begins with a capital letter in red or black,\r\ndenoting the desk or press in which a given MS. would be found, thus:\r\n\r\n  F   Postilla Magistri\r\n      Nicolai de lyra super psalmos\r\n      reponatur uersus orientem in banco vj^o.\r\n\r\nIn the next place I will tell at length the story of the establishment of\r\nthe Vatican Library by Pope Sixtus IV., as it is both interesting in\r\nitself and useful for my present purpose[365].\r\n\r\nThe real founder of the Vatican Library, as we understand the term, was\r\nNicholas V. (1447-1455), but he was unable to do more than collect books,\r\nfor which no adequate room was provided till the accession of Sixtus IV.\r\nin 1471. In December of that year, only four months after his election,\r\nhis chamberlain commissioned five architects to quarry and convey to the\r\npalace a supply of building-stone \"for use in a certain building there to\r\nbe constructed for library-purposes[366]\"; but the scheme for an\r\nindependent building, as indicated by the terms here employed, was soon\r\nabandoned, and nothing was done for rather more than three years. In the\r\nbeginning of 1475, however, a new impulse was given to the work by the\r\nappointment of Bartolommeo Platina as Librarian (28 February)[367]; and\r\nfrom that date until Platina's death in 1481 it went forward without let\r\nor hindrance. This distinguished man of letters seems to have enjoyed the\r\nfull confidence of the Pope, to have been liberally supplied with funds,\r\nand to have had a free hand in the employment of craftsmen and artists to\r\nfurnish and decorate his Library. It is pleasant to be able to record that\r\nhe lived to see his work completed, and all the books under his charge\r\ncatalogued. The enumeration of the volumes contained in the different\r\nstalls, closets, and coffers, with which the catalogue of 1481 concludes,\r\nis headed by a rubric, which records, with pathetic simplicity, the fact\r\nthat it was drawn up \"by Platina, librarian, and Demetrius of Lucca his\r\npupil, keeper, on the 14th day of September, 1481, only eight days before\r\nhis death[368].\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 98. Ground-plan of the rooms in the Vatican Palace\r\nfitted up for library-purposes by Sixtus IV.\r\n\r\nE. Wilson, Cambridge]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the Library had suffered considerably from the\r\nnegligence of those in whose charge it had been. Many volumes were\r\nmissing, and those that remained were in bad condition. Platina and his\r\nmaster set to work energetically to remedy these defects. The former\r\nengaged a binder, and bought materials for his use[369]; the latter issued\r\na Bull (30 June) of exceptional severity[370]. After stating that \"certain\r\necclesiastical and secular persons, having no fear of God before their\r\neyes, have taken sundry volumes in theology and other faculties from the\r\nlibrary, which volumes they still presume rashly and maliciously to hide\r\nand secretly to detain\"; such persons are warned to return the books in\r\nquestion within forty days. If they disobey they are _ipso facto_\r\nexcommunicated. If they are clerics they shall be incapable of holding\r\nlivings, and if laymen, of holding any office. Those who have knowledge of\r\nsuch persons are to inform against them. The effect produced by this\r\ndocument has not been recorded; nor are we told what the extent of the\r\nloss was. It could hardly have been very extensive, for a catalogue which\r\nPlatina prepared, or perhaps only signed, on the day of his election,\r\nenumerates 2527 volumes, of which 770 were Greek and 1757 Latin[371]. The\r\nnumber of the latter had more than doubled in the twenty years that had\r\nelapsed since the death of Nicholas V., an augmentation due, in all\r\nprobability, to the activity of Sixtus himself.\r\n\r\nThe place selected to contain this extensive collection was the\r\nground-floor of a building which had been erected by Nicholas V. and\r\nsubsequently used as a provision store. The position of it, and its\r\nrelations to neighbouring structures, will be understood from the\r\naccompanying plan (fig. 97), which I borrow from M. Fabre's paper. In\r\norder to shew how the building was arranged when it was first built,\r\nbefore other structures abutted against it, I have prepared a second plan\r\n(fig. 98) drawn from measurements taken by myself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 97. Ground-plan of part of the Vatican Palace, shewing\r\nthe building of Nicholas V., as arranged for library purposes by Sixtus\r\nIV., and its relation to the surrounding structures.\r\n\r\nFrom Letarouilly, _Le Vatican_, fol. Paris, 1882; as reproduced by M.\r\nFabre.]\r\n\r\nThe floor is divided into four rooms by party-walls which are probably\r\nolder than 1475, but which are proved, by the catalogue of 1481, to have\r\nbeen in existence at that period. The first of these rooms, entered\r\ndirectly from the court, contained the Latin Library; the second, the\r\nGreek Library. These two, taken together, formed the Common, or Public,\r\nLibrary (_Bibliotheca communis_, _B. publica_, or merely _Bibliotheca_).\r\nNext to this room, or these rooms, was the _Bibliotheca secreta_ or\r\nReserved Library, in which the more precious MSS. were kept apart from the\r\nothers. The fourth room, which was not fitted up till 1480 or 1481, was\r\ncalled _Bibliotheca pontificia_. In addition to MSS. it contained the\r\npapal archives and registers (_Regesta_). In the catalogue dated 1512 it\r\nis called _Intima et ultima secretior bibliotheca_, and seems to have\r\ncontained the most valued treasures. This quadripartite division is\r\ncommemorated by Aurelio Brandolini (Epigram XII.)[372]. After alluding to\r\nthe founders of some of the famous libraries of antiquity, he says in\r\nconclusion:\r\n\r\n  Bibliotheca fuit, fateor, sua cuique, sed vna.\r\n    Sixte pater vincis: quatuor vnus habes.\r\n\r\nThanks to the care with which Platina set down his expenditure, we are\r\nable to follow step by step the gradual transformation of the rooms. His\r\naccount-books[373], begun 30 June 1475, record, with a minuteness as rare\r\nas it is valuable, his transactions with the different artists and workmen\r\nwhom he thought proper to employ. It was evidently intended that the\r\nlibrary should be beautiful as well as useful, and some of the most\r\ncelebrated artists of the day were set to work upon it.\r\n\r\nThe librarian prudently began in August, 1475, by increasing the light,\r\nand a new window was made \"on the side next the court.\" It seems to have\r\nbeen impossible to get either workmen or materials in Rome; both were\r\nsupplied from a distance. For the windows, glass, lead and solder were\r\nbrought from Venice, and a German, called simply Hormannus, i.e. Hermann,\r\nwas hired to glaze them. For the internal decoration two well-known\r\nFlorentine artists--the brothers Ghirlandajo--were engaged, with Melozzo\r\nda Forli, who was painting there in 1477[374]. In 1476 the principal\r\nentrance was decorated with special care. Marble was bought for the\r\ndoorcase, and the door itself was studded with 95 bronze nails, which were\r\ngilt, as were also the ring and knocker, and the frame of trellised\r\nironwork (_cancellus_), which hung within the outer door.\r\n\r\nThe building is entered from the _Cortile del Papagallo_[375] through a\r\nmarble doorway (fig. 98, A) in the classical style surmounted by the arms\r\nof Sixtus IV. On the frieze are the words SIXTUS PAPA IIII. The doorcase\r\nis doubtless that made in 1476; but the door, with its gilt nails and\r\nother adornments, has disappeared. Within the doorway there has been a\r\ndescent of three steps at least to the floor of the Library[376]. The four\r\nrooms of which it was once composed are now used as the _Floreria_ or\r\n_Garde-meuble_ of the Vatican Palace; a use to which they have probably\r\nbeen put ever since the new Library was built at the end of the sixteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe Latin Library, into which the door from the court opens directly, is a\r\nnoble room, 58 ft. 9 in. long, 34 ft. 8 in. wide, and about 16 ft. high to\r\nthe spring of the vault. In the centre is a square pier, which carries the\r\nfour plain quadripartite vaults, probably of brick, covered with plaster.\r\nThe room is at present lighted by two windows (B, C) in the north wall,\r\nand by another, of smaller size, above the door of entrance (A). That this\r\nlatter window was inserted by Sixtus IV., is proved by the presence of his\r\narms above it on a stone shield. This is probably the window \"next the\r\ncourt\" made in 1475. The windows in the north wall are about 8 ft. high by\r\n5 ft. broad, and their sills are 7 ft. above the floor of the room.\r\nFurther, there were two windows in the west wall (_b_, _c_) a little\r\nsmaller than those in the north wall, and placed at a much lower level,\r\nonly a few feet above the floor. These were blocked when the Torre Borgia\r\nwas built by Alexander VI. (1492-1503), but their position can still be\r\neasily made out. This room must have been admirably lighted in former\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe room next to this, the Greek Library, is 28 ft. broad by 34 ft. 6 in.\r\nlong. It is lighted by a window (fig. 98, D) in the north wall, of the\r\nsame size as those of the Latin Library, and by another (_ibid._, E) a\r\ngood deal smaller, opposite to it. This room was originally entered from\r\nthe Latin Library by a door close to the north wall (_d_). But, in\r\n1480[377], two large openings (_e_, _f_) were made in the partition-wall,\r\neither because the light was found to be deficient, or because it was\r\nthought best to throw the two rooms into one as far as possible. At some\r\nsubsequent date the door (_d_) was blocked up, and the opening next to it\r\n(_e_) was carried down to the ground, so as to do duty as a door. The\r\nother opening (_f_), about 7 ft. 6 in. square, remains as constructed.\r\n\r\nThe decorative work of the brothers Ghirlandajo can still be made out, at\r\nleast in part, though time has made sad havoc with it. The edges of the\r\nvaulting were made prominent by classical moldings coarsely drawn in a\r\ndark colour; and at the key of each vault is a large architectural\r\nornament, or coat of arms, surrounded by a wreath of oak-leaves and\r\nacorns, to commemorate the Della Rovere family. They are tied together on\r\neach side with long flaunting ribbons, which, with their shadows, extend\r\nfor a considerable distance over the vaults. The semi-circular lunettes in\r\nthe upper part of the wall under the vaults are all treated alike, except\r\nthat those on the sides of the room, being larger than those at the ends\r\n(fig. 98), contain two subjects instead of one. The lower part, for about\r\n3 feet in height, is painted to represent a solid marble balcony, behind\r\nwhich a Doctor or Prophet is supposed to be standing. He is visible from\r\nrather below the waist upwards, and holds in his hand a scroll bearing an\r\nappropriate text. On each side of the figure in the smaller lunettes,\r\nresting on the balcony, is a large vase of flowers; and behind it a clear\r\nsky. Round the upper edge of the lunette is a broad band of oak-leaves,\r\nand fruits of various kinds. The figures, of which there were evidently\r\ntwelve originally, are the following, beginning with the one at the\r\nnorth-east corner over the door leading into the Greek Library, and\r\nproceeding to the right:\r\n\r\n   1. HIERONYMUS. _Scientiam scripturarum ama, et vitia carnis non amabis._\r\n\r\n   2. GREGORIUS. _Dei sapientiam sardonyco et zaphyro non confer._\r\n\r\n   3. THOMAS. _Legend illegible._\r\n\r\n   4. BONAVENTURA. _Fructus scripturae est plenitudo aeternae felicitatis._\r\n\r\n   5. ARISTOTELES. }\r\n                   }\r\n   6. DIOGENES.   }\r\n                   }\r\n   7. CLEOBULUS.   }\r\n                   }  _Legends illegible._\r\n   8. ANTISTHENES. }\r\n                   }\r\n   9. SOCRATES.    }\r\n                   }\r\n  10. PLATO.       }\r\n\r\n  11. AUGUSTINUS. _Nihil beatius est quam semper aliquid legere aut\r\n                  scribere._\r\n\r\n  12. AMBROSIUS. _Diligentiam circa scripturas sanctorum posui._\r\n\r\nJerome and Gregory occupy the east wall; Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventura\r\nthe first lunette on the south wall, over the door of entrance; Aristotle\r\nand Diogenes the next, succeeded by Cleobulus and Antisthenes on the west\r\nwall; on the first lunette on the north wall are Socrates and Plato; in\r\nthe second Augustine and Ambrose, facing Aquinas and Bonaventura. Thus the\r\neastern half of the library was presided over by doctors of the Christian\r\nChurch, the western by pagan philosophers.\r\n\r\nThe space on the north wall (_gh_), nearly opposite to the door of\r\nentrance, was occupied by the fresco on which Melozzo da Forli was working\r\nin 1477. It was intended to commemorate the establishment of the Library\r\nin a permanent home by Sixtus the Fourth. The Pope is seated on the right\r\nof the spectator. On his right stands his nephew, Cardinal Pietro Riario,\r\nand before him, his head turned towards the Pope, to whom he seems to be\r\nspeaking, another nephew, Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, afterwards Pope\r\nJulius the Second. At the feet of the Pope kneels Bartolommeo Platina, the\r\nnewly appointed Librarian, who is pointing with the forefinger of his\r\nright hand to the inscription below the fresco. Behind Platina are two\r\nyoung men with chains of office round their necks. The inscription, said\r\nto have been written by Platina himself, is as follows:\r\n\r\n  TEMPLA, DOMUM EXPOSITIS[378], VICOS, FORA, MOENIA, PONTES,\r\n      VIRGINEAM TRIVII QUOD REPARARIS AQUAM,\r\n  PRISCA LICET NAUTIS STATUAS DARE MUNERA PORTUS,\r\n      ET VATICANUM CINGERE, SIXTE, JUGUM,\r\n  PLUS TAMEN URBS DEBET; NAM QUAE SQUALORE LATEBAT\r\n      CERNITUR IN CELEBRI BIBLIOTHECA LOCO.\r\n\r\nThe fresco is now in the Vatican picture-gallery. It was transferred to\r\ncanvas soon after 1815, when the present gallery was formed, and has\r\nsuffered a good deal from what is called restoration[379].\r\n\r\nThe decoration of the Greek Library is not alluded to in the\r\nAccounts[380]; but it is easy to see that the lunettes have been\r\nornamented on the same system as those of the Latin Library, but without\r\nfigures; for their decoration still exists, though much damaged by time\r\nand damp. Below the lunettes the walls are covered with whitewash, under\r\nwhich some decoration is evidently concealed. The whitewash has peeled off\r\nin some places, and colour is beginning to make its appearance.\r\n\r\nThe _Bibliotheca secreta_ is 20 ft. wide by 38 ft. 6 in. long. It is\r\nlighted by a single window in the north wall (fig. 98, F), of the same\r\nsize and shape as the rest. The light is sufficient, even under present\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and last room--spoken of in 1480 as \"that addition which our\r\nMaster lately made\"--is 29 ft. wide by 40 ft. 6 in. long. It is at present\r\nlighted by only a single window in the north wall (fig. 98, G), and is\r\nvery gloomy. But in former days, before Julius II. (1503-1513) built the\r\n_Cortile di San Damaso_, it had another window in the middle of the east\r\nwall (_ibid._, H), where there is now a door. Nothing certain can be made\r\nout about its decoration.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be regretted that so little is said about the glazing of the\r\nwindows throughout the Library. Great care was evidently bestowed upon\r\nthem, and the engagement of foreign artists, with the purchase of glass at\r\nVenice, are proofs that something specially beautiful was intended.\r\nColoured glass is mentioned, which may have been used either for coats of\r\narms--and we know that the Papal Arms were to be set up in the\r\n_Bibliotheca secreta_--or for subjects. But, in forming conjectures as to\r\nthe treatment of these windows, it should be remembered that the\r\ntransmission of light must always have been the first consideration, and\r\nthat white glass must have preponderated.\r\n\r\nThe rooms for the Librarian and his assistants were in a small building\r\nwhich abutted on the Library at its S.W. corner, and stood between the two\r\ncourts, obtaining light from each. Over the door of entrance was the\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n              SIXTUS . IIII . PONT . MAX.\r\n  BIBLIOTECARIO . ET . CVSTODIBVS . LOCVM . ADDIXIT[381].\r\n\r\nThe accommodation provided was not magnificent, two rooms only being\r\nmentioned. A door (fig. 98, _a_), now blocked, gave access to the Library\r\nfrom this building. It is interesting to note, as a proof of the richness\r\nof all the work, that it was of inlaid wood (_pino intarsiata_).\r\n\r\nThe work of fitting up this Library occupied about six years. It began in\r\nSeptember 1475, and proceeded continuously to January 1477, when Melozzo's\r\nfresco was in progress. In December of that year the windows of the\r\n_Bibliotheca secreta_ were begun; but during 1478 and 1479 nothing was\r\ndone. In 1480 work was resumed, and the last payment to painters was made\r\nin 1481.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider how these rooms were fitted up for the reception of\r\nbooks. I will first collect the notices in the Accounts respecting desks,\r\nor _banchi_, as they are called, and then compare them with the rooms\r\nthemselves, and with the descriptions in the catalogues, which are\r\nfortunately extremely full; and I think that it will be possible to give a\r\nclear and consistent picture of the arrangements.\r\n\r\nPlatina ordered the desks for the Latin Library first, in 1475. This is\r\nset down in the following terms:\r\n\r\n    I have counted out, in the presence of Clement, steward\r\n    of the household of His Holiness our Master, Salvatus\r\n    the library-keeper (_librarius_), and Demetrius the\r\n    reader (_lector_), 45 ducats to Francis the carpenter of\r\n    Milan, now dwelling in the fishmarket of the city of\r\n    Rome, towards making the desks in the library; and\r\n    especially ten desks which stand on the left hand, the\r\n    length of which is 38 palms or thereabouts; and so\r\n    having received a part of the money, the total of which\r\n    is 130 ducats, he promises and binds himself to do that\r\n    which it is his duty to do, this 15th day of July,\r\n    1475[382].\r\n\r\nThe full name of this carpenter is known, from his receipts, to have been\r\nFrancesco de Gyovane di Boxi da Milano. He received in all 300 ducats\r\ninstead of the 130 mentioned in the first agreement, and when the last\r\npayment was made to him, 7 June, 1476, the following explanatory note is\r\ngiven:\r\n\r\n    Moreover I have paid to the same [Francis the carpenter]\r\n    30 ducats for what remains due on 25 desks for the\r\n    Library: for the longer ones, which are 10 in number,\r\n    there were paid, as entered above, 130 ducats; for the\r\n    rest there were paid 170 ducats, making a total of 300\r\n    ducats, and so he has been paid in full for all the\r\n    desks, this 7th day of June, 1476[383].\r\n\r\nIn 1477 the furniture for the next room, the _Bibliotheca secreta_ or\r\nInner Library, was begun. The work was entrusted to a Florentine, called\r\nin the Accounts merely _Magister Joanninus faber lignarius de Florentia_,\r\nbut identified by M. Fabre with Giovannino dei Dolci, one of the builders\r\nof the Sistine chapel. The most important entry referring to him is the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n    Master Giovannino, carpenter of Florence, had from me\r\n    Platyna, librarian of His Holiness our Master, for\r\n    making the desks in the inner library, for the great\r\n    press, and the settle, in the said room--all of which\r\n    were estimated by Master Francis of Milan at one hundred\r\n    and eighty ducats--he had, as aforesaid, sixty-five\r\n    ducats and sixty groats on the 7th May, 1477[384].\r\n\r\nThe last payment on this account was made 18 March, 1478, on which day he\r\nalso received eight ducats for three frames \"to contain the names of the\r\nbooks,\" and for some repairs to old desks[385]. These frames were painted\r\nby one of Melozzo da Forli's workmen[386]. In February, 1481, 12\r\nbook-chests were supplied[387].\r\n\r\nThe desks for the fourth room or _Bibliotheca pontificia_ were ordered in\r\n1480-81. The workmen employed were Giovannino and his brother Marco.\r\n\r\n    Master Giovannino of Florence and Master Marco his\r\n    brother, a carpenter, received XXV ducats in part\r\n    payment for the desks which are being made in the\r\n    library now added by His Holiness our Master, 18 July,\r\n    1480[388].\r\n\r\nThese workmen received 100 ducats up to 7 April, 1481, but the account was\r\nnot then settled. Up to this period the bookcases had cost the large sum\r\nof 580 ducats or, if the value of the ducat be taken at six shillings and\r\nsixpence, L188 10_s._ of our money.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of chains began in January 1476[389]. It is worth notice that\r\nso simple an article as a chain for a book could not be bought in Rome,\r\nbut had to be sent for from Milan; where, by the way, the dues exacted by\r\nthe government made the purchase irksome and costly. The total number of\r\nchains bought was 1728, and the total cost 102 ducats, or rather more than\r\nL33. The rings were found to be too small, and were altered in Rome.\r\nNothing is said about the place from which the rods came (_ferramenta\r\nquibus catenae innituntur_).\r\n\r\nIn 1477 (14 April) \"John the chain-maker (_Joannes fabricator catenarum_)\"\r\nsupplies \"48 iron rods on which the books are strung on the seats[390]\"\r\nand also 48 locks, evidently connected with the same number of rods\r\nsupplied before. In the same year a key-maker (_magister clavium_)\r\nsupplies 22 locks for the seats and cupboards in the _Bibliotheca\r\nsecreta_[391]; and in 1480, when the _Bibliotheca pontficia_ was being\r\nfitted up, keys, locks, chains, and other ironwork were supplied by\r\nBernardino, nephew of John of Milan[392].\r\n\r\nFor further information we must turn to the catalogues. For my present\r\npurpose the first of these[393] is that by Platina, of which I have\r\nalready spoken, dated 14 September, 1481. It is a small folio volume,\r\nwritten on vellum, with gilt edges, and in plain binding that may be\r\noriginal. The first page has a lovely border of an enlaced pattern with\r\nthe arms of Sixtus IV. in a circle at the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe compiler of the catalogue goes through the library case by case,\r\nnoting (at least in the Latin Library) the position of the case, the\r\nsubjects of the books contained in it, and their titles. This is succeeded\r\nby an enumeration of the number of volumes, so as to shew, in a couple of\r\npages, how many the whole Library contained. MM. Muentz and Fabre print\r\nthis enumeration, but, so far as I know, the catalogue itself has not as\r\nyet been printed by any one. For my present purpose I shall combine the\r\nheadings of the catalogue, the subjects, and the number of the volumes, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Inventarium Bibliothecae Palatinae Divi Sexti Quarti Pont.

In the Greek Library, each seat\r\ncontained 50 volumes; in the Inner Library, 31 volumes; in the\r\n_Bibliotheca pontificia_, 21 volumes.\r\n\r\nIn the next place I will give the results of the examination of a\r\ncatalogue[394] of the Library, which M. Fabre, with much probability,\r\nassigns to the year 1512[395]. It begins as follows with the Latin\r\nLibrary:\r\n\r\n  Ad sinistra' Pontificis bibliothecam introeuntibus\r\n    In primo scanno supra                            [27]\r\n         \"     \"    infra                            [27]\r\n    Finis primi scanni sub et supra                      [54]\r\n\r\nThe nine seats (_banchi_) of the left side of the Latin Library are gone\r\nthrough in the same way as the first, with the result that each is shewn\r\nto have two shelves. The total number of books is 457, or 27 more than in\r\n1481.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite, or right-hand side of the Library, the first two seats\r\nhave three shelves, and are described as follows:\r\n\r\n  In primo scanno supra                            [22]\r\n       \"       \"  infra                            [27]\r\n   \" eodem scanno inferius siue sub infra          [26]\r\n  Finis primi scanni sub et subter                     [75]\r\n\r\nOn this side of the Latin Library the number of books has risen to 360 as\r\nagainst 313 of the previous catalogue.\r\n\r\nIn the Greek Library there are similarly two shelves to each seat, and the\r\ntotal number of volumes is 407 as against 400.\r\n\r\nThe account of the Inner Library begins as follows:\r\n\r\n  In secretiori bibliotheca\r\n  In iij^o. scanno supra.                          [16]\r\n  \"           \"    infra                           [17]\r\n  \"           \"    inferius siue sub infra         [21]\r\n\r\nThree of the seats have three shelves; the rest two; and the total number\r\nof volumes has become 222 as against 190: or, an average of 37 to each\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nThe _Bibliotheca pontificia_ is introduced with the following heading:\r\n\r\n    In intima et ultima secretiori bibliotheca ubi libri\r\n    sunt pretiosiores.\r\n\r\nEach seat has two shelves, and the total number of volumes is 277 as\r\nagainst 259 in 1481. Among the MSS. occurs \"Virgilius antiquus litteris\r\nmaiusculis\"--no doubt the Vatican Virgil (_Codex romanus_), a volume which\r\nfully justifies its place among those termed _libri pretiosiores_.\r\n\r\nThis catalogue closes with the following sentence:\r\n\r\n    Finis totius Bibliothece Pontificie: viz. omnium\r\n    scamnorum tam Latinorum quam Grecorum in prima, secunda,\r\n    tertia, et quarta eius distinctione et omnium omnino\r\n    librorum: exceptis armariis et capsis: et iis libris,\r\n    qui Graeci ex maxima parte, in scabellis parieti\r\n    adherentibus in intima ac penitissima Bibliothece parte\r\n    sunt positi. Deo Laudes et Gratias.\r\n\r\nThe increase between 1481 and 1512 in the number of volumes in the parts\r\nof the Library defined in the above catalogue will be best understood from\r\nthe following table, which shews that 131 volumes had been added in 31\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n                         1481   1512\r\n\r\n  Latin Library           743    817\r\n  Greek    \"              400    407\r\n  Bibliotheca secreta     190    222\r\n      \"       pontificia  259    277\r\n                         ----   ----\r\n                 Total   1592   1723\r\n\r\nAnother catalogue, unfortunately without date[396], but which has every\r\nappearance of belonging to the same period, notes the rooms as the\r\n_Bibliotheca magna publica_, i.e. the Latin and Greek Libraries taken\r\ntogether, the _Bibliotheca parva secreta_, and the _Bibliotheca magna\r\nsecreta_.\r\n\r\nThe catalogue drawn up by Zenobio Acciaioli, 12 October, 1518[397], offers\r\nno peculiarity except that in the Inner Library each seat is noted as\r\nhaving three rows of books, thus:\r\n\r\n  In primo bancho bibliothece parve secrete\r\n                        Infra in secundo ordine\r\n                            \"    tertio     \"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 99. Interior of the Library of Sixtus IV., as shewn in\r\na fresco in the Ospedale di Santo Spirito, Rome.\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph taken by Danesi.]\r\n\r\nWe may now proceed to arrange the Library in accordance with the\r\ninformation derived from the Accounts and the catalogues, compared with\r\nthe ground-plan (fig. 98).\r\n\r\nThese authorities shew that in each of the rooms the books were arranged\r\non what are called _banchi_, or as they would have been termed in England,\r\ndesks, or seats, to which the books were attached by chains. It is\r\nobvious, therefore, that there must have been also seats for readers. A\r\npiece of furniture fulfilling these conditions and constructed twenty-five\r\nyears earlier, is still to be seen at Cesena, as I have just explained.\r\nFurther, I have examined a good many manuscripts now in the Vatican\r\nLibrary which formed part of the older collection; and wherever the mark\r\nof the chain has not been obliterated by rebinding, it is in the precise\r\nposition required for the above system.\r\n\r\nIf I am right in supposing that the cases at Cesena are a survival of what\r\nwas once in general use, we should expect to find another example of them\r\nin the Vatican; and that such was the case, is proved by the evidence of a\r\nfresco in the Ospedale di Santo Spirito at Rome, representing the interior\r\nof the library. This hospital was rebuilt by Sixtus IV. on an enlarged\r\nscale[398], and after its completion in 1482, one of the halls on the\r\nground floor was decorated with a series of frescoes representing the\r\nimprovements which he had carried out in the city of Rome. Recent\r\nresearches[399] make it probable that the earlier pictures in the series\r\nof which the library is one, were selected by Platina, and executed before\r\nhis death in 1481. I am able to present to my readers a reduced copy of\r\nthis invaluable record (fig. 99) executed for me by Signor Danesi, under\r\nthe kind superintendence of Father Ehrle.\r\n\r\nThe artistic merit of such a work as this is not great, but I feel sure\r\nthat the artist faithfully reproduced what he saw with the limitations\r\nprescribed by his own want of skill. The desks bear a general resemblance\r\nto those at Cesena; they are plainer than the Accounts would warrant, but\r\nthis may be due to want of skill on the part of the artist. The chains\r\nhave also been omitted either for the same reason or from a wish to avoid\r\ndetail. It will be noticed that each desk is fully furnished with volumes\r\nlaid out upon it, and that these vary in number and size, and have\r\ndifferent bindings. It may be argued that the artist wished to compliment\r\nhis patrons by making the most of their property; but I should be inclined\r\nto maintain that this was the normal condition of the Library, and that\r\nthe books, handsomely bound and protected by numerous bosses of metal,\r\nusually lay upon the desks ready for use.\r\n\r\nIf this fresco be compared with the earlier work of Melozzo da Forli, it\r\nis not difficult to identify four of the persons present in the Library\r\n(other than the readers). The central figure is obviously Sixtus IV., and\r\nthe Cardinal to whom he is speaking is, I think, meant for Giuliano della\r\nRovere, afterwards Julius II. The figure immediately behind the Pope may\r\nbe intended for Pietro Riario, and the figure behind him is certainly\r\nPlatina. The others, I take it, are simply attendants.\r\n\r\nNor must it be forgotten that, important as this fresco is in connexion\r\nwith the Library of the Vatican, it is of even greater interest as a\r\ncontemporary representation of a large fifteenth century library.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of each room is not quite so simple as might appear at\r\nfirst sight; and, besides the desks, there are other pieces of furniture\r\nto be accounted for. We will therefore go through the rooms in order with\r\nthe ground-plan (fig. 98). On this plan the cases are coloured gray, the\r\nreaders' seats are indicated by transverse lines, and the intervals are\r\nleft white.\r\n\r\n_Latin Library._ The Accounts tell us that there were 10 seats on the left\r\nhand of the Latin Library, and that these were longer than the rest,\r\nmeasuring 38 palms each, or about 27 ft. 9 in. English[400].\r\n\r\nAs the distance from the central pier to the west wall is just 27 ft. 6\r\nin., it is obvious that the cases must have stood north and south--an\r\narrangement which is also convenient for readers, as the light would fall\r\non them from the left hand. For this reason I have placed the first desk\r\nagainst the pier, the reader's seat being westward of it. A difficulty\r\nnow arises. It is stated in the Accounts that _ten banchi_ are paid for,\r\nbut all the catalogues mention only _nine_. I suggest that the explanation\r\nis to be found in the fact that ten pieces of furniture do occur between\r\nthe pier and the wall, the first of which is a shelf and desk, and the\r\nlast a seat only. This arrangement is to be seen at Cesena and in the\r\nMedicean Library at Florence. The room being 34 ft. 8 in. wide, space is\r\nleft for a passage along the south wall to the door (_a_) of the\r\nLibrarian's room, and also for another along the opposite ends of the\r\ndesks.\r\n\r\nFor the arrangement of the rest of the Library, the Accounts give a most\r\nimportant piece of information. They tell us that the whole of the seats\r\nfor the Common Library, i.e. the Latin and Greek Libraries taken together,\r\n25 in number, cost 300 ducats, of which sum the 10 long seats above\r\nmentioned absorbed 130 ducats, leaving 170 to pay for the remaining 15.\r\nFrom these data it is not difficult to calculate the cost of each palm,\r\nand from that the number of palms that 170 ducats would buy. I make this\r\nto be 510 palms, or about 373 feet[401].\r\n\r\nIt is, I think, obvious that there must have been some sort of vestibule\r\njust inside the door of entrance, where students could be received, and\r\nwhere they could consult the catalogue or the Librarian. Further, the\r\ncatalogues shew that the seven desks arranged in this part of the Library\r\nwere in all probability shorter than those of the opposite side, for they\r\ncontained fewer volumes. If we allow each of them 21 ft. 4 in. in length,\r\nwe shall dispose of 149 ft., which leaves 224 ft. for the 8 desks of the\r\nGreek Library, or 28 ft. for each, with one foot over.\r\n\r\n_Greek Library._ In this room there were eight seats, and, as explained\r\nabove, each was about 28 ft. long. The room being 28 ft. wide, this\r\nnumber, with a width of 3 ft. for each, is very convenient, and leaves a\r\npassage 4 ft. wide along the west wall. The length, moreover, does not\r\ninterfere with the passage from door to door, and leaves a short interval\r\nbetween the ends of the desks and the opposite wall.\r\n\r\n_Inner Library._ In this room space has to be provided for (1) six seats,\r\neach holding on an average about 30 volumes; (2) a press (_armarium_) with\r\nfive divisions, and holding 938 volumes; (3) a settle (_spalera_); (4) 12\r\nchests or coffers (_capsae_).\r\n\r\nI have placed the _armarium_ at the end of the room, opposite the window.\r\nIn this position it can be allowed to be 20 ft. in width with 5 divisions,\r\neach, we will suppose, about 4 ft. wide. Let us suppose further that it\r\nwas 7 ft. high, and had 6 shelves. If we allow 8 volumes to each foot,\r\neach shelf would hold 32 volumes, and each division six times that number,\r\nor 192. This estimate for each division will give a total of 960 volumes\r\nfor the five divisions, a number slightly in excess of that mentioned in\r\nPlatina's catalogue.\r\n\r\nAfter allowing a space 5 ft. wide in front of the press, there is plenty\r\nof room left for 6 desks, each 21 ft. long. I have placed the _spalliera_,\r\nwith its four coffers (_capsae_) under the seat, below the window. This\r\npiece of furniture, in modern Italian _spalliera_, French _epauliere_, is\r\ncommon in large houses at the present day. It usually stands in an\r\nante-room or on a landing of one of the long staircases. A portion at\r\nleast of the _spalliere_ used in this Library are still in existence. They\r\nstood in the vestibule of the present Vatican Library until a short time\r\nago, when the present Pope had them removed to the Appartamento Borgia,\r\nwhere they stand against the wall round one of the rooms. There are two\r\ndistinct designs of different heights and ornamentation. The photograph\r\nhere reproduced (fig. 100) was taken specially for my use. The _spalliere_\r\nhave evidently been a good deal altered in the process of fitting up, and\r\nmoreover, as it is impossible to discover whether we have the whole or\r\nonly a part of what once existed, it is useless to make any suggestion,\r\nfrom the length of the portions that remain, as to which room they may\r\nonce have fitted. They are excellent specimens of inlaid work. That on the\r\nright, with the row of crosses along the cornice, is 6 ft. 2 in. high, and\r\n66 ft. long. That on the left is 5 ft. 10 in. high, and 24 ft. 7 in. long.\r\nThe capsae project from the wall 1 ft. 4 in., and are 2 ft. high. Their\r\nlids vary a little in length, from 3 ft. 11 in. to 4 ft. 10 in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 100. The library-settles (_spalliere_) once used in\r\nthe Vatican Library of Sixtus IV., and now in the Appartamento Borgia.\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph.]\r\n\r\nBut the presence of a _spalliera_ is not the only peculiarity in the\r\nfurniture of this room. Platina's catalogue shews that, connected in some\r\nmanner with each seat, were two coffers (_capsae_): and we have seen that\r\n12 such chests were brought into the Library in 1481. I have placed these\r\nin pairs at the ends of the desks opposite the settle (_spalliera_).\r\n\r\n_Innermost Library_, or _Bibliotheca pontificia_. This Library contained\r\n12 desks. These, from their number, must have stood east and west. There\r\nwas also a _spalliera_, which held the Papal Registers. I have placed it\r\nin the recess on the north side of the room, which looks as though made\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that there was a map of the world in the Library, for\r\nwhich a frame was bought in 1478[402]; and a couple of globes--the one\r\ncelestial, the other terrestrial. Covers made of sheepskin were bought for\r\nthem in 1477[403]. Globes with and without such covers are shewn in the\r\nview of the Library of the University of Leyden taken in 1610 (fig. 69);\r\nand M. Fabre reminds us that globes still form part of the furniture of\r\nthe Library of the Palazzo Barberini in Rome, fitted up by Cardinal\r\nFrancesco Barberini, 1630-40[404].\r\n\r\nComfort was considered by the provision of a brazier on wheels \"that it\r\nmay be moved from place to place in the Library[405].\"\r\n\r\nThe following curious rule, copied, as it would appear, in the Library\r\nitself, by Claude Bellievre of Lyons, who visited Rome about 1513, shews\r\nthat order was strictly enforced:\r\n\r\n    Nonnulla quae collegi in bibliotheca Vaticani. Edictum S.\r\n    D. N. Ne quis in bibliotheca cum altero contentiose\r\n    loquatur et obstrepat, neve de loco ad locum iturus\r\n    scamna transcendat et pedibus conterat, atque libros\r\n    claudat et in locum percommode reponat. Ubique volet\r\n    perlegerit. Secus qui faxit foras cum ignominia mittetur\r\n    atque hujusce loci aditu deinceps arcebitur[406].\r\n\r\nBefore concluding, I must quote an interesting description of this Library\r\nby Montaigne:\r\n\r\n    Le 6 de Mars [1581] je fus voir la librerie du Vatican\r\n    qui est en cinq ou six salles tout de suite. Il y a un\r\n    grand nombre de livres ataches sur plusieurs rangs de\r\n    pupitres; il y en a aussi dans des coffres, qui me\r\n    furent tous ouverts; force livres ecris a mein et\r\n    notamment un Seneque et les Opuscules de Plutarche. J'y\r\n    vis de remercable la statue du bon Aristide[407] a tout\r\n    une bele teste chauve, la barbe espesse, grand front, le\r\n    regard plein de douceur et de mageste: son nom est\r\n    escrit en sa base tres antique....[408]\r\n\r\n    Je la vis [la Bibliotheque] sans nulle difficulte;\r\n    chacun la voit einsin et en extrait ce qu'il vent; et\r\n    est ouverte quasi tous les matins, et si fus conduit\r\n    partout, et convie par un jantilhomme d'en user quand je\r\n    voudrois[409].\r\n\r\nSixtus IV. intended the library attached to the Holy See to be of the\r\nwidest possible use. In the document appointing Demetrius of Lucca\r\nlibrarian, after Platina's death, he says distinctly that the library has\r\nbeen got together \"for the use of all men of letters, both of our own age,\r\nor of subsequent time[410]\"; and that these are not rhetorical\r\nexpressions, to round a phrase in a formal letter of appointment, is\r\nproved by the way in which manuscripts were lent out of the library,\r\nduring the whole time that Platina was in office. The Register of Loans,\r\nbeginning with his own appointment and ending in 1485, has been printed by\r\nMuentz and Fabre, from the original in the Vatican Library[411], and a most\r\ninteresting record it is. It is headed by a few words of warning, of which\r\nI give the general sense rather than a literal translation.\r\n\r\n    Whoever writes his name here in acknowledgment of books\r\n    received on loan out of the Pope's library, will incur\r\n    his anger and his curse unless he return them uninjured\r\n    within a very brief period.\r\n\r\n    This statement is made by Platina, librarian to his\r\n    Holiness, who entered upon his duties on the last day of\r\n    February, 1475[412].\r\n\r\nEach entry records the title of the book lent, with the name of the\r\nborrower. This entry is sometimes made by the librarian, but more\r\nfrequently by the borrower himself. When the book is returned, Platina or\r\nhis assistant notes the fact, with the date. The following entry, taken\r\nalmost at random, will serve as a specimen:\r\n\r\n    Ego Gaspar de Ozino sapientissimi domini nostri\r\n    cubicularius anno salutis MCCCCLXXV die vero XXI Aprilis\r\n    confiteor habuisse nomine mutui a domino Platina\r\n    Lecturam sive commentum in pergameno super libris X\r\n    Etticorum Aristotelis, et in fidem omnium mea propria\r\n    manu scripsi et supscripsi. Liber autem pavonatio\r\n    copertus est in magno volumine.----Idem Gaspar manu\r\n    propria.----Restituit fideliter librum ipsum et\r\n    repositus est inter philosophos die XXVIII April 1475.\r\n\r\nIt is occasionally noted that a book is lent with its chain, as for\r\ninstance:\r\n\r\n    Christoforus prior S. Balbine habuit Agathium Historicum\r\n    ex banco viii^o cum cathena.... Restituit die XX\r\n    Octobris post mortem Platyne.\r\n\r\nWhen no chain is mentioned are we to understand that the book was not so\r\nprotected, and that there were in the library a number of books without\r\nchains, perhaps for the purpose of being more conveniently borrowed?\r\n\r\nA few words should be added on the staff of the library. At first--that is\r\nduring the year 1475--Platina had under his orders three subordinates,\r\nDemetrius, Salvatus, and John. These are called writers (_scriptores_) or\r\nkeepers (_custodes_); and Salvatus is once called librarian (_librarius_),\r\nbut it will be shewn below that this word means a writer rather than a\r\nlibrarian, as we understand the word. The position of these persons was\r\nextremely humble; and Salvatus was so indigent that his shoes were mended\r\nat the Pope's expense, and a decent suit of clothes provided for him at\r\nthe cost of eight ducats[413]. Besides these there was a bookbinder, also\r\ncalled John. In the following year two keepers only are mentioned,\r\nDemetrius and Josias. The latter died of the plague in 1478. The salary of\r\nthe librarian was at the rate of ten ducats a month, and that of each of\r\nhis subordinates at the rate of one ducat for the same period. This\r\narrangement appears to have been confirmed by a Bull of Sixtus IV. before\r\nthe end of 1477[414].\r\n\r\nThese officers and Platina appear to have lived together in the rooms\r\nadjoining the Latin Library, as shewn by the accounts for the purchase of\r\nbeds, furniture, and the like[415]; and when Josias falls ill of the\r\nplague, Platina sends away Demetrius and John the bookbinder, \"for fear\r\nthey should die or infect others[416].\"\r\n\r\nAll articles required for the due maintenance of the library were provided\r\nby Platina. The charges for binding and lettering are the most numerous.\r\nSkins were bought in the gross--on one occasion as many as 600--and then\r\nprepared for use. All other materials, as gold, colours, varnish, nails,\r\nhorn, clasps, etc., were bought in detail, when required; and probably\r\nused in some room adjoining the library. Platina also saw to the\r\nillumination (_miniatio_) of such MSS. as required it.\r\n\r\nComfort and cleanliness were not forgotten. There are numerous charges for\r\ncoals, with an amusing apology for their use in winter \"because the place\r\nwas so cold\"; and for juniper to fumigate (_ad suffumigandum_). Brooms are\r\nbought to clean the library, and fox-tails to dust the books (_ad\r\ntergendos libros_[417]).\r\n\r\nIt should further be mentioned that Sixtus assigned an annual income to\r\nthe library by a brief dated 15th July, 1477. It is therein stipulated\r\nthat the fees, paid according to custom by all officials appointed to any\r\noffice vacated by resignation, should thenceforward be transferred to the\r\naccount of the library[418].\r\n\r\nWhile Sixtus IV. was thus engaged in Rome, a rival collector, Federigo da\r\nMontefeltro, Duke of Urbino (1444--1482), was devoting such leisure as he\r\ncould snatch from warfare to similar pursuits. The room in which he stored\r\nhis treasures is practically unaltered. It differs materially in\r\narrangement from the other libraries of the same period. This difference\r\nis perhaps due to its position in a residence which was half palace, half\r\ncastle. It is on the ground floor of a building which separates the inner\r\nfrom the outer court. It measures 45 ft. in length, by 20 ft. 9 in. in\r\nwidth. The walls are about 14 ft. high to the spring of the barrel-vault\r\nwhich covers the whole space. There are two large windows at the north end\r\nof the room, and one at the south end. These are about 7 ft. from the\r\nground. The original entrance was through a door into the inner court, now\r\nblocked. In the centre of the vault is a large eagle in relief with F.D.\r\non each side of its head; round it is a wreath of cherubs' heads: and\r\noutside of all a broad band of flames and rays. The vault is further\r\ndecorated with isolated flames, gilt, on a white ground[419].\r\n\r\nThe books are said to have occupied eight presses, or sets of shelves, set\r\nagainst the east and west walls, but our information on the subject of the\r\nfittings is provokingly meagre. It is chiefly contained in the following\r\npassage of a description written by Bernardino Baldi, and dated 10 June,\r\n1587. Baldi, as a native of Urbino, and in later life attached to the\r\nservice of the Duke, must have been well acquainted with the room and its\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\n    La stanza destinata a questi libri e alia mano sinistra\r\n    di chi entra nel Palazzo contigua al vestibolo, o andito\r\n    ... le fenestre ha volte a Tramontana, le quali per\r\n    esser alte dal pavimento, ed in testa della stanza, e\r\n    volte a parte di cielo che non ha sole, fanno un certo\r\n    lume rimesso, il quale pare col non distraer la vista\r\n    con la soverchia abbondanza della luce, che inviti ed\r\n    inciti coloro rhe v'entrano a studiare. La state e\r\n    freschissima, l' inverno temperatamente calda. Le\r\n    scanzie de' libri sono accostate alle mura, e disposte\r\n    con molto bell' ordine.\r\n\r\n    In questa fra gli altri libri sono due Bibbie, una\r\n    latina scritta a penna e miniata per mano di\r\n    eccellentissimi artefici, e l' altra Ebrea antichissima\r\n    scritta pure a mano ... Questa si posa sopra un gran\r\n    leggivo d' ottone, e s' appoggia all' ale d' una grande\r\n    aquila pur d' ottone che aprendole la sostiene. Intorno\r\n    alle cornici che circondano la libreria si leggono\r\n    scritti nel fregio questi versi[420].\r\n\r\nIn the preface to the catalogue of the library published at Rome in 1895,\r\nthe author, after quoting the above passage, adds \"There were eight\r\npresses each containing seven shelves\"[421]. The architectural decorations\r\nhave all disappeared, with the exception of a fragment of a pediment at\r\nthe south end of the room, on which F. E. DVX is still visible. The\r\nlectern is in the choir of the cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe Biblioteca Laurenziana, or Medicean Library, at Florence, is the last\r\nItalian library which I intend to describe.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Pope Leo X. in 1521, his executor Cardinal Giulio dei\r\nMedici, afterwards Pope Clement VII., restored to Florence the books which\r\ntheir ancestors had got together, and commissioned Michelangelo to build a\r\nroom for their reception. The work was frequently interrupted, and it was\r\nnot until 1571 (11 June) that the library was formally opened.\r\n\r\nThe great architect, supported by the generosity of the Pope, constructed\r\nan apartment which for convenience and for appropriate decoration stands\r\nalone among libraries. It is raised high above the ground in order to\r\nsecure an ample supply of light and air, and is approached by a double\r\nstaircase of marble. It is 151 ft. 9 in. long, by 34 ft. 4 in. broad, and\r\nwas originally lighted by 15 windows in each of the side-walls at a height\r\nof about 7 ft. 6 in. from the floor. There is a flat roof of wood, carved;\r\nand a pavement of terra-cotta consisting of yellow designs on a red\r\nground.\r\n\r\nWhen the room was first fitted up there were 44 desks on each side, but\r\nwhen the reading-room was built at the beginning of the last century,\r\nfour were destroyed. This reading-room also blocks four windows. The glass\r\nwas supplied by Giovanni da Udine in 1567 and 1568. The subjects are\r\nheraldic. In each window the arms of the Medici occupy a central position,\r\nand are surrounded by wreaths, arabesques, and other devices of infinite\r\ngrace and variety, in the style which the genius of Raphael had introduced\r\ninto the Vatican.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 101. Bookcases in the Medicean Library, Florence.]\r\n\r\nThe bookcases (fig. 101) are of walnut-wood, a material which is said to\r\nhave been prescribed by the Pope himself. They were executed, if we may\r\nbelieve Vasari[422], by Battista del Cinque and Ciapino, but they are now\r\nknown to have been designed by Michelangelo. A rough outline in one of his\r\nsketch-books, preserved in the Casa Buonarotti at Florence with other\r\nrelics illustrating his life, and here reproduced (fig. 102),\r\nunquestionably represents one of these desks. The indication of a human\r\nfigure on the seat proves the care which he took to ensure a height\r\nconvenient for readers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 102. Copy, slightly reduced, of a sketch by\r\nMichelangelo for one of the bookcases in the Medicean Library, Florence.]\r\n\r\nThese desks are on the same general plan as those at Cesena, but they are\r\nrather higher and more richly ornamented. Each is 11 ft. 3 in. long, and 4\r\nft. 4 in. high. It must be admitted that the straight back to the reader's\r\nseat is not so comfortable as the gentle slope provided in the older\r\nexample. A frame for the catalogue hangs on the end of each desk next the\r\ncentral alley. In order to make clear the differences in the construction\r\nof the desks at Cesena and at Florence I append an elevation of each\r\n(figs. 103, 104).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 103. Elevation of desks at Cesena.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 104. Elevation of desks at Florence.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the view of one of the desks (fig. 101) that the\r\nbooks either lie on the sloping desk or are packed away on the shelf under\r\nit. There is an average of 25 books on each desk. The chains, as at\r\nCesena, are attached to the lower edge of the right board, at distances\r\nvarying from 2 in. to 4 in. from the back of the book (fig. 105). The\r\nstaple is sunk into the wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 105. A book in the Medicean Library, to shew\r\nattachment of chain.]\r\n\r\nThe chains are made of fine iron bars about one-eighth of an inch wide,\r\nbut not quite so thick, flattened at the end of each link, and rounded in\r\nthe centre, where a piece of the same iron is lapped round, but not\r\nsoldered. Each chain (fig. 106) is 2 ft. 3 in. long. So far as I could\r\njudge all the chains in the library are of the same length. There is a\r\nring at the end of the chain next to the bar, but no swivel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 106. Piece of chain in the Medicean Library, of the\r\nactual size.]\r\n\r\nThe ironwork by which these chains are attached to the desk is somewhat\r\ncomplicated. By the kindness of the librarian, Signor Guido Biagi, I have\r\nbeen allowed to study it at my leisure, and to draw a diagrammatic sketch\r\n(fig. 107) which I hope will make it clear to my readers. The lock is sunk\r\nin the central support of the desk. The bar passes through a ring on each\r\nside of this support, and also through a ring near each end of the desk.\r\nThese rings are fixed to the lower edge of the desk just under the\r\nmolding. A flat piece of iron is forged on to the bar near the centre.\r\nThis iron is pierced near the key-hole with an oblong slit through which\r\npasses a moveable piece of iron, here shewn in outline of its actual size\r\n(fig. 108). The bolt of the lock passes through a hole in this piece, and\r\nholds the bar firmly in its place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 107. Diagram to explain the ironwork at the Medicean\r\nLibrary.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 108. Outline of bolt forming part of ironwork.]\r\n\r\nThe bar is not quite so long as the desk; consequently, when it has been\r\nunlocked, and the iron bolt sketched above withdrawn, it can be turned\r\nround by taking hold of the central iron, and pushed to the right or to\r\nthe left, past the terminal rings. The chains can then be readily\r\nunstrung, or another strung upon the bar.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter I shall describe the changes in Library arrangements\r\nadopted during the period which succeeded the Middle Ages; but, before\r\nending this present chapter, there are a few points affecting the older\r\nlibraries and their organization to which I should like to draw attention.\r\n\r\nIn the first place all medieval libraries were practically public. I do\r\nnot mean that strangers were let in, but even in those of the monasteries,\r\nbooks were let out on the deposit of a sufficient caution; and in Houses\r\nsuch as S. Victor and S. Germain des Pres, Paris, and at the Cathedral of\r\nRouen, the collections were open to readers on certain days in the week.\r\nThe Papal library and those at Urbino and Florence were also public; and\r\neven at Oxford and Cambridge there was practically no objection to lending\r\nbooks on good security. Secular corporations followed the example set by\r\nthe Church, and lent their manuscripts, but only on security. A very\r\nremarkable example of this practice is afforded by the transaction between\r\nthe Ecole de Medecine, Paris, and Louis XI. The king wanted their copy of\r\na certain work on medicine; they declined to lend it unless he deposited\r\n12 marks worth of plate and 100 gold crowns. This he agreed to do; the\r\nbook was borrowed; duly copied, and 24 January, 1472, restored to the\r\nMedical Faculty, who in their turn sent back the deposit to the king[423].\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, these libraries were divided into the lending library\r\nand the library of reference. These two parts of the collection have\r\ndifferent names given to them. In the Vatican Library of Sixtus IV. we\r\nfind the common library (_Bibliotheca communis_) or public library (_B.\r\npublica_), and the reserved library (_B. secreta_). The same terms were\r\nused at Assisi. At Santa Maria Novella, Florence, there was the library,\r\nand the lesser library (_B. minor_). In the University Library, Cambridge,\r\nthere was \"the public library\" which contained the more ordinary books and\r\nwas open to everybody, and \"the private library\" where the more valuable\r\nbooks were kept and to which only a few privileged persons were\r\nadmitted[424]. At Queens' College, in the same university, the books which\r\nmight be lent (_libri distribuendi_) were kept in a separate room from\r\nthose which were chained to the shelves (_libri concatenati_), and at\r\nKing's College there was a public library (_B. magna_) and a lesser\r\nlibrary (_B. minor_). In short, in every large collection some such\r\ndivision was made, either structural, or by means of a separate\r\ncatalogue[425].\r\n\r\nI have shewn that two systems of bookcases, which I have called\r\nlectern-system and stall-system, were used in these libraries; but, as\r\nboth these have been copiously illustrated, I need say no more on that\r\npart of the subject. Elaborate catalogues, of which I have given a few\r\nspecimens, enabled readers to find what they wanted in the shortest\r\npossible time, and globes, maps, and astronomical instruments provided\r\nthem with further assistance in their studies. Moreover in some places the\r\nlibrary served the purpose of a museum, and curiosities of various kinds\r\nwere stored up in it.\r\n\r\nNo picture of a medieval library can be complete unless it be remembered\r\nthat in many cases beauty was no less an object than utility. The\r\nbookcases were fine specimens of carpentry-work, carved and decorated; the\r\npavement was of encaustic tiles worked in patterns; the walls were\r\ndecorated with plaster-work in relief; the windows were filled with\r\nstained glass; and the roof-timbers were ornamented with the coat-armour\r\nof benefactors.\r\n\r\nOf these embellishments the most distinctive was the glass. At St Albans\r\nthe twelve windows contained figures illustrating the subjects of the\r\nbooks placed near them. For instance, the second window represented\r\nRhetoric and Poetry; and the figures selected were those of Cicero,\r\nSallust, Musaeus, Orpheus. Appropriate verses were inscribed beneath each.\r\nThe whole scheme recalls the library of Isidore, Bishop of Seville, which\r\nI have already described[426]. In the library of Jesus College,\r\nCambridge, each light contains a cock standing on a globe, the emblem of\r\nBishop Alcock the founder, with a label in his beak bearing a suitable\r\ntext, and under his feet an inscription containing half the designation\r\nrequired. For instance, the first two bookcases contained works on Physic,\r\nand in the window is the word PHI-SICA divided between the two\r\nlights[427]. In Election Hall at Eton College--a room originally intended\r\nfor a library--we find the Classes of Civil Law, Criminal and Canon Law,\r\nMedicine, etc., illustrated by medallions shewing a church council, an\r\nexecution, a physician and his patient, and the like[428]. At the\r\nSorbonne, Paris, the 38 windows of the library were filled with the\r\nportraits of those who had conferred special benefits on the college[429];\r\nat Froidmont[430] near Beauvais the authors of the _Voyage Litteraire_\r\nremark the beautiful stained glass in the library: and in Bishop Cobham's\r\nlibrary at Oxford, according to Hearne, there \"was brave painted glass\r\ncontaining the arms of the benefactors, which painted glass continued till\r\nthe times of the late rebellion[431].\"\r\n\r\nLastly, I will collect the different terms used to designate medieval\r\nbookcases. They are--arranged alphabetically--_analogium_, _bancus_ or\r\n_banca_, _descus_, _gradus_, _stallum_, _stalla_, _stallus_ or _staulum_,\r\nand _sedile_. I have sometimes thought that it would be possible to\r\ndetermine the form of the bookcase from the word used to describe it; but\r\nincreased study has convinced me that this is impossible, and that the\r\nwords were used quite loosely. For instance, _bancus_ designates the cases\r\nin the Vatican Library which represent a variety of the lectern-system;\r\nand its French equivalent _banc_ the cases at Clairvaux which were stalls\r\nwith four shelves apiece. Again \"desk\" (_descus_) is used interchangeably\r\nwith \"stall\" (_stallum_) in a catalogue of the University Library,\r\nCambridge, dated 1473, to designate what I strongly suspect were lecterns;\r\nin 1693 by Bishop Hacket when describing the stalls which Dean Williams\r\ngave to the library at Westminster Abbey[432]: and in 1695 by Sir C. Wren\r\nto describe bookcases which were partly set against the walls, partly at\r\nright-angles to them.\r\n\r\nIt has been already shewn that _gradus_ means a shelf, or a lectern, or a\r\nside of a lectern[433]; and _sedile_ is obviously only the Latin\r\nequivalent for \"seat,\" which was sometimes used, as at S. John's College,\r\nCambridge, in 1623[434], to designate a bookcase. It was also used at\r\nChrist Church, Canterbury, for what I have shewn to be a stall with four\r\nshelves[435]. The word _analogium_ was used in France to signify a\r\nlectern[436]. The word \"class\" (_classis_) is used at the University\r\nLibrary, Cambridge, in 1584, instead of the ancient \"stall,\" and\r\nafterwards superseded it entirely. For instance, when a Syndicate was\r\nappointed in 1713 to provide accommodation for Bishop Moore's Library, the\r\nbookcases are described as _Thecae sive quas vocant classes_. Gradually the\r\nterm was extended until it reached its modern signification, namely, the\r\nshelves under a given window together with those on the sides of the\r\nbookcases to the right and left of the spectator facing it[437].\r\n\r\nWe sometimes meet with the word _distinctio_. For instance, an Apocalypse\r\nin the library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, which once belonged\r\nto St Augustine's College, Canterbury, is noted as having stood\r\n\"_distinctione prima gradu tertio_\"; and the same word is used in the\r\nintroduction to the catalogue of Dover Priory to signify what I am\r\ncompelled to decide was a bookcase. The word _demonstratio_, on the other\r\nhand, which occurs at the head of the catalogue of the library of Christ\r\nChurch, Canterbury, made between 1285 and 1331, probably denotes a\r\ndivision of subject, and not a piece of furniture.\r\n\r\nUntil the lectern-system had gone out of fashion, a word to denote a shelf\r\nwas not needed. When shelves had to be referred to, _textus_[438] was used\r\nat Canterbury, and _linea_[439] at Citeaux. On the other hand, at Saint\r\nOuen at Rouen, this word indicates a row of bookcases, probably lecterns.\r\nIn a record of loans[440] from that library in 1372 and following years,\r\nthe books borrowed are set down as follows (to quote a few typical\r\ninstances):\r\n\r\n  Item, digestum novum, linea I, E, II.\r\n  Item, liber de regulis fidei, cum aliis, linea III, L, VIII.\r\n  Item, Tulius de officiis, linea II a parte sinistra, D, II.\r\n\r\nThese extracts will be sufficient to shew that the cases were arranged in\r\nthree double rows, each double row being called a _linea_. Each lectern\r\nwas marked with a letter of the alphabet, and each book with the number of\r\nthe row, the letter of the lectern to which it belonged, and its number on\r\nthe lectern. Thus, to take the first of the above entries, the Digest was\r\nto be found in the first row, on lectern E, and was the second volume on\r\nthe said lectern. It is evident that there was a row of lecterns on each\r\nside of a central alley or passage, and that a book was to be found on the\r\nright hand, unless the left hand was specially designated.\r\n\r\nA catalogue has been preserved of the books in the castle of Peniscola on\r\nthe east coast of Spain, when the anti-pope Benedict XIII. retired there\r\nin 1415. They were kept in presses (_armaria_), each of which was\r\nsubdivided into a certain number of compartments (_domuncule_), each of\r\nwhich again contained two shelves (_ordines_)[441]. I suggest that this\r\npiece of furniture resembled, on a large scale, Le Chartrier de Bayeux,\r\nwhich I have already figured (fig. 26).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I will quote a passage in which the word library designates\r\na bookcase. It occurs in an inventory of the goods in the church of S.\r\nChristopher le Stocks, London, made in 1488:\r\n\r\n    On the south side of the vestrarie standeth a grete\r\n    library with ij longe lecturnalles theron to ley on the\r\n    bokes[442].\r\n\r\nI need hardly remind my readers that the French word _bibliotheque_ has\r\nthe same double meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[356] Catalogus Codicum Manuscriptorum Malastestianae Caesenatis bibliothecae\r\nfratrum minorum fidei custodiaeque concreditae....

The\r\nspots round this figure are alternately black and red.\r\n\r\n[364] Ducange s. v. _solarium_ shews that occasionally it =_armarium_.\r\n\r\n[365] I have to thank Father C. J. Ehrle, _S. J._, Prefect of the Vatican\r\nLibrary, for the very great kindness with which he has assisted me in\r\nthese researches during three visits to Rome in 1898, 1899, 1900; and also\r\nthe officials who allowed me to examine parts of the palace not usually\r\naccessible to strangers.\r\n\r\nFurther, I wish it to be clearly and distinctly understood that my\r\nresearches are based upon an essay by M. Paul Fabre, _La Vaticane de Sixte\r\nIV._, which had appeared in the _Milanges d'Archeologie et d'Histoire of\r\nthe Ecole Francaise de Rome_ for December 1895, but of the existence of\r\nwhich I had never heard until Father Ehrle shewed it to me. On reading it,\r\nI found that M. Fabre had completely anticipated me; he had done exactly\r\nwhat I had come to Rome to do, and in such a masterly fashion that I could\r\nnot hope to improve upon his work. After some consideration I determined\r\nto verify his conclusions by carefully examining the locality, and to make\r\na fresh ground-plan of it for my own use. I have also studied the\r\nauthorities quoted by M. Eugene Muentz (_Les Arts a la Cour des Papes_)\r\nfrom my own point of view.\r\n\r\nThere are two works to which I shall frequently refer: _Les Arts a la Cour\r\ndes Papes pendant le xv^e et le xvi^e siecle_, par Eugene Muentz: Part III.\r\n1882 (Bibl. des Ecoles Francaises d'Athenes et de Rome, Fasc. 28): and _La\r\nBibliotheque du Vatican_ _au xv^e Siecle_, par Eugene Muentz et Paul Fabre;\r\nParis, 1887 (Ibid. Fasc. 48). The former will be cited as \"Muentz\"; the\r\nlatter as \"Muentz et Fabre.\" My paper, of which an abstract only is here\r\ngiven, has been published in the _Camb. Ant. Soc. Proc. and Comm._ 6 March\r\n1899, Vol. X. pp. 11-61.\r\n\r\n[366] This document, dated 17 December, 1471, has been printed by Muentz,\r\np. 120. I am afraid that this order can have but one meaning: viz. the\r\nexcavation and destruction of ancient buildings.\r\n\r\n[367] This is the date assigned by Platina himself.

The catalogue is printed pp. 159-250.\r\n\r\n[372] MS. Vat. 5008.\r\n\r\n[373] These accounts, now preserved in the State Archives at Rome, have\r\nbeen printed with great accuracy (so far as I was able to judge from a\r\nsomewhat hasty collation) by Muentz, _Les Arts a la Cour da Papes_, Vol.\r\nIII. 1882, p. 121 sq.; and by Muentz and Fabre, _La Bibliotheque du Vatican\r\nau xv^e Siecle_, 1887, p. 148 sq.\r\n\r\n[374] The entries referring to these purchases are given in full, with\r\ntranslations, in my paper above referred to.\r\n\r\n[375] The name is derived from the frescoes with which its external walls\r\nwere decorated during the reign of Pius IV. (1559-1565). They represented\r\npalm trees, on which parrots (_papagalli_) and other birds were perching.\r\nFragments of these frescoes are still to be seen. The court beyond this\r\n\"del Portoncin di Ferro\" was so called from an iron gate by which the\r\npassage into it from the Cortile del Papagallo could be closed.\r\n\r\n[376] The difference of level between the floor of the court and the floor\r\nof the library is eighteen inches. An inclined plane of wood now replaces\r\nthe steps.\r\n\r\n[377] Item pro purganda bibliotheca veteri et asportandis calcinaciis\r\nduarum fenestrarum factarum inter graecam et latinam b.

Each of 10 seats was 38 palms\r\nlong: total length, 380 palms. As these 10 seats cost 130 ducats, each\r\npalm cost 130/380 ducats = 1/3 a ducat nearly.\r\n\r\nAs the total paid was 300 ducats, this first payment, viz. 130 ducats,\r\nleft 170 ducats still due for the 15 remaining seats. As each palm cost a\r\nthird of a ducat, 170 ducats would buy 510 palms = 113.73 metres = 4477\r\ninches (nearly) = 373 feet.\r\n\r\n[402] Per lo tellaro del mappamondo b. 52. Muentz, p. 129.

SUPPRESSION OF THE\r\nMONASTERIES. COMMISSIONERS OF EDWARD VI. SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN LIBRARY\r\nFITTINGS. S. JOHN'S COLLEGE, AND UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, CAMBRIDGE. QUEEN'S\r\nCOLLEGE, OXFORD. LIBRARIES ATTACHED TO CHURCHES AND SCHOOLS. CHAINING IN\r\nRECENT TIMES. CHAINS TAKEN OFF.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have now traced the evolution of the bookcase from a clumsy contrivance\r\nconsisting of two boards set at an angle to each other, to the stately\r\npieces of furniture which, with but little alteration, are still in use;\r\nand I hope that I have succeeded in shewing that the fifteenth century was\r\nemphatically the library-era throughout Europe. Monasteries, cathedrals,\r\nuniversities, and secular institutions in general vied with each other in\r\nerecting libraries, in stocking them with books, and in framing liberal\r\nregulations for making them useful to the public.\r\n\r\nTo this development of study in all directions the sixteenth century\r\noffers a sad and startling contrast. In France the Huguenot movement took\r\nthe form of a bitter hostility to the clergy--which, after the fashion of\r\nthat day, exhibited itself in a very general destruction of churches,\r\nmonasteries, and their contents; while England witnessed the suppression\r\nof the Monastic Orders, and the annihilation, so far as was practicable,\r\nof all that belonged to them. I have shewn that monastic libraries were\r\nthe public libraries of the Middle Ages; more than this, the larger\r\nhouses were centres of culture and education, maintaining schools for\r\nchildren, and sending older students to the Universities. In three years,\r\nbetween 1536 and 1539. the whole system was swept away, as thoroughly as\r\nthough it had never existed. The buildings were pulled down, and the\r\nmaterials sold; the plate was melted; and the books were either burnt, or\r\nput to the vilest uses to which waste literature can be subjected. I will\r\nstate the case in another way which will bring out more clearly the result\r\nof this catastrophe. Upwards of eight hundred monasteries were suppressed,\r\nand, as a consequence, eight hundred libraries were done away with,\r\nvarying in size and importance from Christ Church, Canterbury, with its\r\n2000 volumes, to small houses with little more than the necessary\r\nservice-books. By the year 1540 the only libraries left in England were\r\nthose at the two Universities, and in the Cathedrals of the old\r\nfoundation. Further, the royal commissioners made no attempt to save any\r\nof the books with which the monasteries were filled. In France in 1789 the\r\nrevolutionary leaders sent the libraries of the convents they pillaged to\r\nthe nearest town: for instance, that of Citeaux to Dijon; of Clairvaux to\r\nTroyes; of Corbie to Amiens. But in England at the suppression no such\r\nprecautions were taken; manuscripts seem to have been at a discount just\r\nthen, for which the invention of printing may be to some extent\r\nresponsible; their mercantile value was small; private collectors were\r\nfew. So the monastic libraries perished, save a few hundred manuscripts\r\nwhich have survived to give us an imperfect notion of what the rest were\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nHow great the loss was, has probably been recorded by more than one\r\nwriter; but for the moment I can think of nothing more graphic than the\r\nwords of that bitter protestant John Bale, a contemporary who had seen the\r\nold libraries, and knew their value. After lamenting that \"in turnynge\r\nouer of y^e superstycyouse monasteryes so lytle respect was had to theyr\r\nlybraryes for the sauegarde of those noble and precyouse monumentes\" (the\r\nworks of ancient writers), he states what ought to have been done, and\r\nwhat really happened.\r\n\r\n    Neuer had we bene offended for the losse of our\r\n    lybraryes beynge so many in nombre and in so desolate\r\n    places for the most parte, yf the chiefe monumentes and\r\n    moste notable workes of our excellent wryters had bene\r\n    reserued.\r\n\r\n    If there had bene in every shyre but one solempne\r\n    lybrary, to the preseruacyon of those noble workes, it\r\n    had bene yet sumwhat. But to destroy all without\r\n    consydyracyon is and wyll be vnto Englande for euer a\r\n    moste horryble infamy amonge the graue senyours of other\r\n    nacyons. A greate nombre of them whych purchased those\r\n    superstycyouse mansyons, reserued of those bokes some to\r\n    ... scoure theyr candelstyckes, and some to rubbe theyr\r\n    bootes. Some they sold to the grossers and sopesellers,\r\n    and some they sent ouer see to the boke bynders, not in\r\n    small nombre, but at times whole shyppes full, to the\r\n    wonderynge of the foren nacyons. I know a merchaunt man\r\n    which shall at this tyme be namelesse, that boughte the\r\n    contentes of two noble lybraryes for. xl. shyllynges\r\n    pryce, a shame it is to be spoken. This stuffe hath he\r\n    occupyed in the stede of graye paper by the space of\r\n    more than these .x. yeares, and yet he hath store ynough\r\n    for many yeares to come[443].\r\n\r\nThe Universities, though untouched by the suppression, were not allowed to\r\nremain long at peace. In 1549, commissioners were sent by Edward the Sixth\r\nto Oxford and Cambridge. They considered that it fell within their\r\nprovince to reform the libraries as well as those who used them; and they\r\ndid their work with a thoroughness that under other circumstances would\r\nhave been worthy of commendation. Anthony Wood[444] has told us in\r\neloquent periods, where sorrow struggles with indignation, how the college\r\nlibraries were treated; how manuscripts which had nothing superstitious\r\nabout them except a few rubricated initials, were carried through the city\r\non biers to the market-place and there consumed. Of the treatment meted\r\nout to the public library of the University he gives an almost identical\r\naccount[445]. This library--now the central portion of the Bodleian--had\r\nbeen completed about 1480. It was well stocked with manuscripts of value,\r\nthe most important of which, in number about 600[446], had been given by\r\nHumphrey Duke of Gloucester, between 1439 and 1446. His collection was\r\nthat of a cultivated layman, and was comparatively poor in theological\r\nliterature. Yet in this home of all that was noble in literature and\r\nsplendid in art (for the Duke's copies are said to have been the finest\r\nthat could be bought) did this crew of ignorant fanatics cry havoc, with\r\nsuch fatal success that only three MSS. now survive; and on January 25,\r\n1555-56, certain members of the Senate were appointed \"to sell, in the\r\nname of the University, the book-desks in the public library. The books\r\nhad all disappeared; what need then to retain the shelves and stalls, when\r\nno one thought of replacing their contents, and when the University could\r\nturn an honest penny by their sale[447]?\"\r\n\r\nI suppose that in those collegiate and cathedral libraries of which some\r\nfragments had been suffered to remain, the gaps caused by the destruction\r\nof manuscripts were slowly filled up by printed literature. No new\r\nbookcases would be required for many years; and in fact, nearly a century\r\npassed away before any novelty in the way of library-fittings makes its\r\nappearance. Further, when new libraries came to be built, the provision of\r\nsuitable furniture was not easy. The old stall, with two shelves loaded\r\nwith books attached to them by chains, and a desk and seat for the use of\r\nthe reader, was manifestly no longer adequate, when books could be\r\nproduced by the rapidity of a printing-press, instead of by the slowness\r\nof a writer's hand. And yet, as we shall see, ancient fashions lingered.\r\n\r\nSo far as I know, the first library built and furnished under these new\r\nconditions in England was that of S. John's College, Cambridge. This\r\n\"curious example of Jacobean Gothic[448]\" was built between 1623 and 1628,\r\nat the sole charge of Bishop Williams, whose work at Westminster during\r\nthe same period has been already recorded. The site selected was the\r\nground between the second court of the college and the river, the\r\nlibrary-building being constructed as a continuation of the north side of\r\nthat court, with the library on the first floor, and the chambers intended\r\nfor the Bishop's Fellows and Scholars on the ground floor.\r\n\r\nThe room, after the fashion of the older libraries, is long and narrow,\r\n110 ft. in length by 30 ft. in breadth. Each side-wall is pierced with ten\r\nlofty pointed windows of two lights with tracery in the head. The sills of\r\nthese windows are raised 4 ft. above the floor, and the interval between\r\neach pair of windows is 3 ft. 8 in. There is also a western oriel, the\r\nfoundations of which are laid in the river which washes its walls (fig.\r\n109). The name of the founder is commemorated on the central gable by the\r\nletters I. L. C. S., the initials of _Johannes Lincolniensis Custos\r\nSigilli_, the Bishop being at that time keeper of the Great Seal, or, as\r\nwe should say, Lord Chancellor. The date 1624 marks the completion of the\r\nshell of the building[449].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 109. West oriel of the Library at S. John's College,\r\nCambridge.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 110. Bookcases in the Library of S. John's College,\r\nCambridge.]\r\n\r\nThe beautiful fittings (fig. 110), which are still in use, were completed\r\nbefore 1628. Medieval arrangement was not wholly discarded, but various\r\nmodern features were introduced. The side-walls and window-jambs are\r\npanelled to a height of 8 ft.; and the cornice of this panel-work is\r\ncontinuous with that of the taller cases--which, as in the older examples,\r\nstand at right angles to the walls between each pair of windows. Before\r\nthese fittings were constructed, chaining had been practically abandoned,\r\nso that it was not necessary to provide either desk or seat. In the place,\r\ntherefore, of the reader's seat, a low bookcase was set in front of each\r\nwindow. These cases were originally 5 ft. 6 in. high, with a sloping desk\r\non the top on which books could be laid for study. Stools also were\r\nprovided for the convenience of readers. The larger cases or, as the\r\nbuilding-account of the library calls them, \"the greater seats,\" have been\r\na good deal altered in order to accommodate more books. Originally the\r\nplinth ran round the sides of the case; as did also the broad member which\r\nis seen on the end above the arches. By this arrangement there were in all\r\nonly four shelves, namely, one below the broad member and three above it.\r\nFurther, there was a pilaster in the middle, below the central bracket. It\r\nshould be noted that the medieval habit of placing a list of the books\r\ncontained in each case at the end of the case is here maintained.\r\n\r\nIt might have been expected that these splendid cases would have invited\r\nimitation, and in those at Clare College the general style was undoubtedly\r\ncopied. But, as I have already explained[450], those cases were originally\r\ngenuine specimens of the stall-system, with desks. In other libraries,\r\nwhile a new style of bookcase was put up, we shall find no innovation\r\ncomparable to that seen at S. John's. This was due, in great measure, to\r\nthe medieval character of the rooms to be fitted up.\r\n\r\nThe library at Peterhouse was lengthened in 1633. It is 75 ft. long by 25\r\nft. broad, and each of its side-walls is pierced by a range of three-light\r\nwindows. The cases (fig. 111) were put up between 1641 and 1648. Like\r\nthose at S. John's, they stand at right angles to the walls between the\r\nwindows, but they are detached, and not continuous with the panelwork.\r\nOriginally they were just eight feet high, but have since been heightened\r\nto accommodate more books. Each case is still divided by a central\r\npilaster. So far they do not present any striking peculiarity, but I wish\r\nto draw attention to a curious contrivance, which we shall find\r\nsubsequently reproduced in various forms, though not exactly as it is seen\r\nhere; for these cases were evidently admired, and imitated in several\r\nother colleges. The chains had been taken off the books at Peterhouse in\r\n1593-94, when they were first moved into the new library; so that desks\r\nattached to the cases were not required. Nor were lower cases, with desks\r\nat the top of them, provided. But the convenience of the reader was\r\nconsidered, up to a certain point, by the provision of a seat, 12 in.\r\nwide and 23 in. high, extending along the side of each case, and returned\r\nalong the wall between it and the case next to it. This arrangement may\r\nstill be seen in the two compartments at the west end of the room, one on\r\neach side of the door of entrance. The ends of the seat or 'podium,' are\r\nconcealed by boldly carved wings[451].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 111. Bookcases in the Library of Peterhouse,\r\nCambridge.]\r\n\r\nThe convenience of this type of case was evidently recognised at once, for\r\nwe find it copied, more or less exactly, in the south room of the\r\nUniversity Library (1649); at Jesus College (1663); at Gonville and Caius\r\nCollege (1675); at Emmanuel College (1677); and at Pembroke College\r\n(1690).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 112. Bookcases in the south room of the University\r\nLibrary, Cambridge.]\r\n\r\nThe south room of the University Library, on the first floor, is 25 ft.\r\nwide and was originally 67 ft. long. It was lighted by eight windows in\r\nthe north wall, and by nine windows in the south wall, each of two lights.\r\nThere was also a window of four lights in the east gable, as we learn from\r\nLoggan's print, and probably a window in the west gable also[452]. It was\r\nentered by a door, in the north-east corner, approached by a \"vice,\" or\r\nturret-stair. This door was fortunately left intact when the east building\r\nwas erected in 1755. The room has been but little altered, and still\r\npreserves the beautiful roof, the contract for which is dated 25 June,\r\n1466[453].\r\n\r\nWe do not know anything about the primitive fittings, but, having regard\r\nto the fact that the spaces between the windows are barely two feet wide,\r\nit is probable that they were lecterns. Moreover, a catalogue, dated 1473,\r\nenumerates eight stalls on the north side each containing on an average 21\r\nbooks, and nine on the south side, each containing 18 books[454]. These\r\nnumbers, compared with those mentioned above at Zutphen, indicate\r\nlecterns.\r\n\r\nIn the next century this room was assigned to teaching purposes, and the\r\nlecterns were either removed or destroyed. In 1645 the University\r\npetitioned Parliament to put them in possession of Archbishop Bancroft's\r\nlibrary, which he, by will dated 28 October, 1610, had bequeathed to the\r\nPublic Library of the University of Cambridge, should certain other\r\nprovisions not be fulfilled. The request was granted, 15 February, 1647,\r\nand the books arrived in 1649. The room in question, then used as the\r\nGreek School, was ordered, 3 September, 1649, to be \"fitted for the\r\ndisposeall of the said books\" without delay. The existing cases were\r\nsupplied at once, for Fuller, writing in the following year, speaks of\r\nthem with commendation[455]. Their exact date is therefore known.\r\n\r\nThese cases (fig. 112) are 8 ft. high from the floor to the top of the\r\nhorizontal part of the cornice, and 22 in. broad. They have the central\r\npilaster; but the seat has been cut down to a step, which is interrupted\r\nin the middle, so as to allow the central pilaster to rise directly from\r\nthe ground. The wing, however, was too picturesque a feature to be\r\ndiscarded, so it was placed at the end of the step, and carried up, by\r\nmeans of a long slender prolongation, as far as the molding which\r\nseparates the two panels on the end of the stall.\r\n\r\nThese cases were exactly copied at Gonville and Caius College; and again\r\nat Emmanuel College; but in both those examples the step is continuous. At\r\nJesus College the same type is maintained, with the central pilaster and\r\ncontinuous step; but the work is extremely plain, and there is neither\r\nwing nor pediment. At Pembroke College there is a further modification of\r\nthe type. The step disappears, and, instead of it, a plinth extends along\r\nthe whole length of the case. The wing, however, remains, as a survival of\r\nthe lost step, and helps to give dignity to the base of the standard,\r\nwhich is surmounted by a semicircular pediment, beneath which is a band of\r\nfruit and flowers in high relief[456].\r\n\r\nI will now describe a very interesting bookcase at King's College,\r\nCambridge (fig. 113), which was put up in 1659, with a bequest from\r\nNicholas Hobart, formerly Fellow[457]. It remains in its original position\r\nin one of the chapels on the south side of the choir, which were used for\r\nlibrary-purposes till the present library was built by Wilkins in 1825. It\r\nhas several details in common with those at S. John's College, as\r\noriginally constructed, and will help us to understand their aspect before\r\nthey were altered. There is a lofty plinth, a broad member interposed\r\nbetween the first and second shelf, a central vertical pilaster; and, as\r\nat Peterhouse, and elsewhere, a step or 'podium' with a wing. But, with\r\nthese resemblances to cases in which books are arranged as at present, it\r\nis curious to find the usual indications of chaining, which we know from\r\nother sources was not given up in this library until 1777. There are locks\r\non the end of the case just below each of the two shelves, and scars on\r\nthe vertical pilasters caused by the attachment of the iron-work that\r\ncarried the bar. Further, just below the broad band, a piece of wood of a\r\ndifferent quality has been inserted into the pilasters, evidently to fill\r\nup a vacancy caused by the removal of some part of the original structure,\r\nprobably a desk or shelf.\r\n\r\nThe antiquary William Cole, writing in 1744, describes these chapels when\r\nused as libraries. Each chapel held five bookcases, \"two at the\r\nextremities, which are but half-cases, and three in the body, of which the\r\nmiddlemost is much loftier than the rest.\" In the chapel fitted up by\r\nHobart, Cole tells us that \"at the end of the biggest middle class is\r\nwrote in gold letters LEGAVIT NICOLAUS HOBART 1659[458].\" As the chapel is\r\nonly 20 ft. long, the intervals between the cases could hardly have\r\nexceeded 2 ft., and as the books were chained they must have been\r\nconsulted standing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 113. Bookcase in the old Library of King's College,\r\nCambridge, made with the bequest of Nicholas Hobart, 1659.]\r\n\r\nA similar return to ancient forms is to be found in the library of Queen's\r\nCollege, Oxford, begun in 1692. The architect is said to have been\r\nNicholas Hawkesmoore, to whom the fittings, put up in the first fourteen\r\nyears of the eighteenth century[459], are also ascribed. This library is\r\n123 ft. long by 30 ft. wide. There are ten bookcases on each side at right\r\nangles to the walls between the windows. Each case is about 11 ft. high,\r\nand 2 ft. 6 in. wide; but, though their ornamentation is in the style of\r\nthe period, of which they are splendid examples, their general design\r\nexactly reproduces the old type. In their original state they were\r\nprovided with desks, though there is no evidence that the books were\r\nchained; they had only two shelves above that which was on the level of\r\nthe top of the desk; and there was a double seat between each pair of\r\ncases. The space above the second shelf, between it and the cornice, was\r\noccupied by a cupboard, handsomely ornamented with carved panels, for\r\nsmall books or manuscripts[460]. In fact, the only innovation which the\r\ndesigner of these remarkable cases permitted himself to employ was to make\r\nthe moldings of their cornices continuous with that of the panelwork which\r\nhe carried along the sides of the room, and into the jambs of the windows.\r\nThe space below the desk was utilised for books, but, as these were found\r\nto be inconvenient of access, the desks and seats were taken away in 1871,\r\nand dwarf bookcases provided in front of the windows.\r\n\r\nWhen the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury built their library, now called\r\nthe Howley-Harrison Library, in 1669-70, they constructed a room on\r\nstrictly medieval lines. It is 65 ft. long by 21 ft. broad, with seven\r\nequidistant windows in the north wall and six in the south wall. The\r\nbookcases, which are plain medieval stalls, project from the walls at\r\nright angles between the windows.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of libraries which must be briefly mentioned in\r\nthis chapter, namely, those connected with parish churches and\r\ngrammar-schools. I suppose that after the destruction of monastic\r\nlibraries all over the country, the dearth of books would be acutely felt,\r\nand that gradually those who had the cause of education at heart\r\nestablished libraries in central situations, to which persons in quest of\r\nknowledge might resort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 114. Ground plan of Library, Grantham, Lincolnshire.\r\n\r\nScale one quarter of an inch to one foot.]\r\n\r\nThe library (fig. 114) at Grantham in Lincolnshire occupies a small room,\r\n16 feet from north to south by 14 feet from east to west, over the south\r\nporch of the parish church, approached by a newel stair from the south\r\naisle. It was founded in 1598 by the Reverend Francis Trigg, rector of\r\nWellbourn; and in 1642, Edward Skipworth \"out of his love and well-wishing\r\nto learning, and to encourage the vicars of Grantham to pursue their\r\nstudies in the winter-time, gave fifty shillings, the yearly interest\r\nthereof to provide firewood for the library fire.\" From this language I\r\nconclude that the original gift of books was made for the benefit of the\r\nvicar for the time being.\r\n\r\nThere are three bookcases set against the walls, each about 6 ft. high and\r\n6 ft. long. A considerable number of the books still bear their chains,\r\nwhich are composed of long flat links closely resembling those at\r\nGuildford, with a ring and swivel next to the bar. The library--room,\r\nbookcases, and books--was carefully restored and repaired in 1894[461].\r\n\r\nAt Langley Marye or Marish in Buckinghamshire near Slough, a library was\r\nfounded in 1623 by Sir John Kederminster \"as well for the perpetual\r\nbenefit of the vicar and curate of the parish of Langley, as for all other\r\nministers and preachers of God's Word that would resort thither to make\r\nuse of the books therein.\" He placed it under the charge of the four\r\ntenants of his almshouses, who were to keep safe the books, and the key of\r\nthe room, under stringent penalties[462].\r\n\r\nThe library is a small room on the south side of the church, entered\r\nthrough the squire's pew, to which there is a separate door in the south\r\nwall. The fittings are of an unusual character, and have been preserved\r\nunaltered. The whole room is panelled at a distance of 15 in. from the\r\nwall, so as to make a series of cupboards, in which the books are\r\ncontained. The doors of these cupboards are divided into panels,\r\nalternately square and oblong. Each of the former contains a small figure\r\npainted in colours on a black ground; each of the latter a shield, or some\r\nheraldic device. The inner surface of these doors is similarly divided\r\ninto panels, on each of which is painted an open book. Above the\r\ncupboards, just under the flat ceiling, is a series of more or less\r\nimaginary landscapes, doing duty as a frieze. Over the fireplace is a very\r\nbeautiful piece of decoration consisting of a large oval shield with\r\nvarious coats of arms painted on it. It is set in an oblong panel, in the\r\nspandrels of which are painted seated figures of Prudence, Justice,\r\nTemperance, Fortitude, with their emblems and suitable mottoes[463].\r\n\r\nIn 1629, the following entry occurs in what is called \"the Church Book\" of\r\nCartmel, in Lancashire:\r\n\r\n    14 July, 1629. It is ordered and agreed upon that the\r\n    churchwardens seate in the body of the churche shall be\r\n    enlarged both in the wideness and in the deske that the\r\n    bookes given unto the church may bee more convenientlie\r\n    laid and chained to remain there according to the\r\n    directions of the donors[464].\r\n\r\nThe will of Humphry Chetham, a wealthy merchant of Manchester, dated 16\r\nDecember, 1651, directs L200 to be spent on certain specified books,\r\n\r\n    to be, by the discretion of my Executors, chained upon\r\n    Desks, or to be fixed to the Pillars, or in other\r\n    convenient Places, in the Parish Churches of\r\n    _Manchester_ and _Boulton in the Moors_, and in the\r\n    Chapels of _Turton_, _Walmesley_, and _Gorton_, in the\r\n    said County of _Lancaster_[465].\r\n\r\nThe bookcase at Gorton[466] is a cupboard of oak, 7 ft. long by 3 ft. high\r\nand 19 in. deep, raised upon four stout legs, 22 in. high. On opening the\r\ndoors, the interior is seen to be divided into two equal parts by a\r\nvertical partition, and again by a horizontal shelf. The shelf and the\r\npartition are both 9 in. deep, so as to leave a considerable interval in\r\nfront of them. The bars--of which there is one for each division--rest in\r\na socket pierced in a small bracket screwed to each end of the case, in\r\nsuch a position that the bar passes just in front of the shelf. A flat\r\npiece of iron, nailed to the central division, carries a short hasp, which\r\npasses over the junction of the bars, and is there secured by a lock. By\r\nthis arrangement no person could withdraw either bar without the key. The\r\nchains, of iron, tinned, are of the same type as those at Hereford, but\r\nthe links are rather longer and narrower. They are attached to the volume\r\nin the same manner, either near the bottom of the right board, or near the\r\ntop of the left board. There are scars on the lower edge of the case, and\r\non the legs, which seem to indicate that there might once have been a\r\ndesk. Otherwise, the books, when read, must have rested on the reader's\r\nknees. The whole piece of furniture closely resembles one dated 1694 at\r\nBolton in Lancashire to be described below (fig. 116).\r\n\r\nThe bookcase at Turton[467] resembles that at Gorton so closely that it\r\nneeds no particular description. The doors are richly carved, and on the\r\ncornice above them is the following inscription, carved in low relief:\r\n\r\nTHE GIFT OF HUMPHRY CHETHAM ESQVIRE. 1655.\r\n\r\nBesides these parochial libraries Mr Chetham directed the foundation\r\n(among other things) of \"a Library within the Town of _Manchester_, for\r\nthe Use of Scholars, and others well affected, to resort unto ... the same\r\nBooks there to remain as a public Library for ever; and my Mind and Will\r\nis, that Care be taken, that none of the said Books be taken out of the\r\nsaid Library at any Time ... the same Books [to] be fixed or chained, as\r\nwell as may be, within the said Library, for the better Preservation\r\nthereof.\" In order to carry out these provisions the executors bought an\r\nancient building called the _College_, which is known to have been\r\ncompleted before 1426 by Thomas Lord de la Warre, as a college in\r\nconnexion with the adjoining collegiate church, now the Cathedral[468].\r\nThe library was placed in two long narrow rooms on the first floor, the\r\noriginal destination of which is uncertain. They are at right angles to\r\neach other, and have a united length of 137 ft. 6 in., with a breadth of\r\n17 ft. The south and west walls are pierced with fourteen three-light\r\nwindows, probably inserted by Chetham's executors; the east and west walls\r\nare blank.\r\n\r\nThe existing fittings, though they have been extensively altered[469] from\r\ntime to time, are in the main those which were originally put up. The\r\nbookcases, of oak, are placed in medieval fashion at right angles to the\r\nwindows. They are 10 ft. long, 2 ft. wide, and were originally 7 ft. high,\r\nbut have been pieced apparently twice, so that they now reach as high as\r\nthe wall-plate. Each pair of cases is 6 ft. apart, so as to make a small\r\ncompartment, closed by wooden gates, which now open in the middle; but a\r\nlock attached to one side of the end of each case indicates that\r\noriginally the gates were in one piece. The cases are quite plain, with\r\nthe exception of a few panels at the end. On the uppermost of these, which\r\nis oblong, and extends from side to side of the case, the subjects of the\r\nworks are written: as PHILOSOPHIA; and beneath, in smaller characters,\r\n_Mathematica_, _Physica_, _Metaphysica_. All indications of chaining have\r\nbeen obliterated, but a reference to the earliest account-book which has\r\nbeen preserved, that beginning 20 April, 1685, shews that the founder's\r\ndirections were obeyed:\r\n\r\n  20 Apr. 1685.

Ring and link of chain: Wimborne Minster.]\r\n\r\nAt Wimborne Minster the books are placed in a small room, about fifteen\r\nfeet square, over the vestry, a building in the Decorated style, situated\r\nbetween the south transept and the south aisle of the choir. Access to\r\nthis room is obtained by a turret-stair at the south-west corner. It was\r\nfitted up as a library in 1686, when the greater part of the books were\r\ngiven by the Rev. William Stone. There are two plain wooden shelves,\r\ncarried round three sides of the room. The chains are attached to the\r\nright-hand board of each book, instead of to the left-hand board, and they\r\nare made of iron wire, twisted as shewn in the sketch (fig. 115). The\r\nswivel, instead of being central, plays in a twist of the wire which\r\nforms the ring attached to the book. The iron bars are supported on eyes,\r\nand are secured by a tongue of iron passed over a staple fixed into the\r\nbracket which supports the shelf. The tongue was originally kept in its\r\nplace by a padlock, now replaced by a wooden peg. No desk was attached to\r\nthe shelves, but in lieu of it a portable desk and stool were\r\nprovided[470].\r\n\r\nA library was built over the porch of the parish church at\r\nDenchworth[471], Berks, in 1693, and \"stocked with 100 books well secured\r\nwith chains,\" presumably for the use of the vicar and his successors; and\r\nin 1715, William Brewster, M.D., bequeathed 285 volumes to the\r\nchurchwardens of All Saints' Church, Hereford, for the same purpose[472].\r\nThe books were placed in the vestry, where they still are. They are all\r\nchained on a system copied from that in use at the Chapter Library.\r\n\r\nIn addition to collections of books, which varied in extent according to\r\nthe taste, or the means, of the donor, single volumes are often found\r\nchained in churches. These do not come within the scope of this Essay, and\r\nI will therefore pass on to notice some libraries connected with Grammar\r\nSchools.\r\n\r\nAt Abingdon in Berkshire, the school, founded 1563, had a library, some\r\nvolumes of which, bearing their chains, are still preserved. There was a\r\nsimilar collection at Bicester in Oxfordshire, where a school is said to\r\nhave been in existence before 1570. In 1571 James Pilkington, Bishop of\r\nDurham (1561-1577), by will dated 4 February in that year, bequeathed his\r\nbooks to the school at Rivington in Lancashire. The following extracts\r\nfrom the statutes, said to have been made shortly after the arrival of the\r\nbooks, remind us of monastic provisions[473].\r\n\r\n    The Governors shall the first day of every quarter when\r\n    they come to the School take an account of all such\r\n    books as have been given to the School, and if any be\r\n    picked away torn or written in they shall cause him that\r\n    so misused it to buy another book as good and lay it in\r\n    the place of it and there to be used continually as\r\n    others be.\r\n\r\n    The Schoolmaster and Usher whensoever the Scholars go\r\n    from the School shall cause all such books as have been\r\n    or shall be given to the School and occupied abroad that\r\n    day to be brought into the place appointed for them, and\r\n    there to be locked up; and every morning shall cause the\r\n    dictionaries, or such other books as are meet to be\r\n    occupied abroad by the Scholars, that have none of their\r\n    own, to be laid abroad, and see that none use to write\r\n    in them, pull out leaves, nor carry them from the\r\n    School; and if any misuse any book, or pick it away, the\r\n    Governours shall cause him to buy another as good, to be\r\n    laid in the stead of it, and occupied as the other was.\r\n\r\n    And for the books of divinity, the Schoolmaster and\r\n    Usher and such as give themselves to study divinity,\r\n    shall occupy them, that they may be the more able to\r\n    declare any article of the catechism or religion to the\r\n    scholars; and in the church to make some notes of the\r\n    Chapters that be read that the people may better\r\n    understand them and remember what is read. And yet these\r\n    books they shall not carry out of the School, without\r\n    license of the Governours, and on pain to bring it\r\n    again, or else to buy one as good, in its stead, and to\r\n    be allowed out of the Master's or Usher's wages.\r\n\r\n    If any preacher come and desire to have the use of some\r\n    of those books, they shall let him have the use of them\r\n    for a time so that they see them brought in again; none\r\n    other shall carry them from the School except they have\r\n    license of half the Governours and be bound to bring it\r\n    safe again.\r\n\r\nIn 1573 John Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich (1560-1575), bequeathed \"the\r\nmost part\" of his Latin books to his native town Guildford, to be placed\r\nin \"the Lybrarie of the same Towne ioyning to the Schole.\" These books,\r\nafter some legal difficulties had been overcome, were brought to\r\nGuildford, and placed in a gallery which connected the two wings of the\r\nschool, and had been begun in 1571. The books were fastened to the shelves\r\nwith chains, one of which has been already figured (fig. 58). There is\r\nevidence that the library was well cared for, and augmented by various\r\ndonations, which were regularly chained as they came in, down to the end\r\nof the 17th century[474].\r\n\r\nHenry Bury, founder of the free school at Bury in Lancashire in 1625,\r\ndirected in his will that a convenient place should be found for the\r\nlibrary, because, as he proceeds to say:\r\n\r\n    I have already geven ... in trust for the use of Bury\r\n    Parish and the countrie therabouts, of ministers also at\r\n    ther metinge and of schole maisters and others that seek\r\n    for learninge and knowledge, above six hundreth bookes,\r\n    and some other such things as I thought might helpe for\r\n    their delight, and refresh students, as globes mappes\r\n    pictures and some other things not every wheare to bee\r\n    seene.\r\n\r\nThis language shews that this provident benefactor intended his library to\r\nbe public. It is pleasant to be able to record that some of the books\r\nwhich he gave are still in existence[475].\r\n\r\nLastly I will figure (fig. 116) the press given in 1694 by \"James Leaver\r\ncitison of London,\" to the Grammar School at Bolton in Lancashire. It\r\nclosely resembles those given by Humphry Chetham to Turton and Gorton. The\r\nsystem of ironwork by which the bars are kept in place is exactly the\r\nsame; and it retains the desk, traces of which exist at Gorton.\r\n\r\nIn my enumeration of the libraries attached to schools and churches, I\r\nhave drawn special attention to the fact that in nearly all of them the\r\nbooks were chained. In explanation of this it might be argued that these\r\nlibraries were in remote places, to which new ideas would not easily\r\npenetrate, but I am about to shew that this method of protection, which\r\nbegan in a remote past, was maintained with strange persistency down to\r\nmodern times. I shall collect some further instances of the chaining of\r\nbooks in places where it might have been expected that such things would\r\nbe no longer thought of; and in conclusion I shall record some dates at\r\nwhich the final removal of chains took place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 116. Bookpress in the school at Bolton, Lancashire.\r\n\r\nFrom _Bibliographical Miscellanies_ by William Blades.]\r\n\r\nIn the library of the Faculty of Medicine, Paris, the books were ordered\r\nto be chained in 1509, in consequence of some thefts; and these chains\r\nwere still attached to certain books in 1770[476]. At Corpus Christi\r\nCollege, Cambridge, in 1554, it was ordered that the books bequeathed by\r\nPeter Nobys, D.D. (Master 1516-23), should be taken better care of for the\r\nfuture, and, if the chains were broken, that they should be repaired at\r\nthe expense of the college[477]. In 1555, Robert Chaloner, Esq.,\r\nbequeathed his law books to Gray's Inn, with forty shillings in money, to\r\nbe paid to his cousin, \"to th' entent that he maie by cheines therwith and\r\nfasten so manye of them in the Librarye at Grauisin [Gray's Inn] as he\r\nshall think convenyente[478].\"\r\n\r\nAt S. John's College, Cambridge, in 1563-4, three shillings were paid to\r\n\"Phillip Stacyoner for cornering, bossing, and chayninge _Anatomiam\r\nVessalii etc._[479]\" In 1573, Dr Caius directs by will twelve copies of\r\nhis own works to be given to his college, \"there to be kepte as the other\r\nbokes are, and to be successivelye tyed with chaynes in the Librarye of\r\nthe same College[480].\" Dr Perne, Master of Peterhouse, by will dated 25\r\nFebruary, 1588, directs that all his books therein bequeathed \"be layed\r\nand chayned in the old Librarie of the Colledge[481].\" At Trinity College,\r\nCambridge, in 1601, Mr Peter Shaw gave L5 towards the \"cheyning and\r\ndesking of his bookes given to the newe liberarie[482].\" In 1638-9, when a\r\nnew library was completed for the Barber Surgeons of London, L6. 18_s._\r\nwere spent on binding and chaining, as for instance:\r\n\r\n    Paid for 36 yards of chaine at 4_d._ the yard and 36\r\n    yards at 3_d._ the yard cometh to xxij_s._ vj_d._\r\n\r\n    Paid to the coppersmith for castinge 80 brasses to\r\n    fasten the chaines to the bookes--xiij_s._ iiij_d._[483]\r\n\r\nSir Matthew Hale, who died in 1676, directed in his will that certain\r\nmanuscripts should be given to the Honourable Society of Lincoln's Inn:\r\n\"My desire,\" he said, \"is that they be kept safe and also in remembrance\r\nof me. They were fit to be bound in leather and chained and kept in\r\narchives[484].\" In the will of Matthew Scrivener, Rector of Haslingfield\r\nin Cambridgeshire, dated 4 March, 1687, the following passage occurs: \"I\r\ngive fifty pounds in trust for the use of the public Library [at\r\nCambridge], either by buying chains for the securing the books at present\r\ntherein contained, or for the increase of the number of them[485].\" At\r\nthe church of S. Gatien at Tours it is recorded in 1718 that the library\r\nwhich occupied one alley of the cloister was well stocked with\r\nmanuscripts, chained on desks, which stood both against the wall and in\r\nthe middle of the room[486]. Lastly, in 1815, John Fells, mariner, gave\r\nL30 to found a theological library in the church of S. Peter, Liverpool.\r\n\"The books were originally fastened to open shelves in the vestry with\r\nrods and chains[487].\"\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the eighteenth century the practice was finally\r\nabandoned. At Eton College in 1719 it was \"Order'd to take y^e Chains off\r\ny^e Books in y^e Library, except y^e Founder's Manuscripts[488]\"; at the\r\nBodleian Library, Oxford, the removal of them began in 1757[489]; at\r\nKing's College, Cambridge, the books were unchained in 1777[490]; at\r\nBrasenose College, Oxford, in 1780[491]; and at Merton College in\r\n1792[492].\r\n\r\nIn France the custom was evidently abandoned at a much earlier date, for\r\nthe authors of the _Voyage Litteraire_, who visited more than eight\r\nhundred monasteries at the beginning of the eighteenth century, with the\r\nspecial intention of examining their records and their libraries, rarely\r\nallude to chaining, and when they do mention it, they use language which\r\nimplies that it was a curious old fashion, the maintenance of which\r\nsurprised them[493].\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[443] _The laboryouse Journey and Serche of Johan Leylande for Englandes\r\nAntiquitees...._ by Johan Bale.

LIBRARY OF CARDINAL MAZARIN. BODLEIAN LIBRARY\r\nAT OXFORD. WORKS AND INFLUENCE OF WREN. FRENCH CONVENTUAL LIBRARIES OF THE\r\nSEVENTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile in England we were struggling with the difficulties of adapting\r\nmedieval forms of libraries and bookcases to the ever-increasing number of\r\nvolumes, a new system was initiated on the continent, which I propose to\r\ncall the wall-system.\r\n\r\nIt seems so natural to us to set our bookshelves against a wall instead of\r\nat right angles to it, that it is difficult to realize that there was a\r\ntime when such an arrangement was an innovation. Such however was the\r\ncase. I believe that this principle was first introduced into a library at\r\nthe Escorial, which Philip the Second of Spain began in 1563, and\r\ncompleted 13 September, 1584. I do not mean by this sentence that nobody\r\never set bookshelves against a wall before the third quarter of the\r\nsixteenth century. I have shewn above, when discussing the catalogue of\r\nDover Priory[494], that the books stood on pieces of furniture which were\r\nprobably so treated; and it is not uncommon in illuminated manuscripts to\r\nsee a writer's books standing on one or more shelves set against the wall\r\nnear his desk. Further, in the accounts of the library arranged in the\r\nVatican by Sixtus IV., shelves set against the wall of one of the four\r\nrooms are specially mentioned[495]; and in the description of the library\r\nof the Dukes of Urbino, it is expressly stated that \"the shelves for the\r\nbooks are set against the walls (_le scanzie de' libri sono accostate alle\r\nmura_)[496].\" What I wish to enforce is that before the Escorial was\r\nbuilt, no important library was fitted up in that manner from the\r\nbeginning by the architect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 118. Bookcases in the Library of the Escorial on an\r\nenlarged scale.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 117. General view of the Library of the Escorial,\r\nlooking north.]\r\n\r\nThe library of the Escorial[497] occupies a commanding position over the\r\nportico through which the building is entered. It is 212 ft. long, by 35\r\nft. broad and about 36 ft. high. The roof is a barrel-vault, gorgeously\r\npainted in fresco, as are the wall-spaces above the bookcases, and the\r\nsemicircular lunettes at the ends of the room. In that at the north end is\r\nPhilosophy, in that at the south end is Theology, while between them are\r\npersonifications of Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, Music, etc. On the walls,\r\nforming a gigantic frieze, are various historical scenes, and figures of\r\ncelebrated persons real and imaginary, as for instance, the first Nicene\r\nCouncil, the School of Athens, Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, Cicero,\r\nDavid, Orpheus, etc. The general appearance of this splendid room will be\r\nunderstood from the view (fig. 117). It is lighted by five windows on the\r\neast side and seven on the west side, to which is added on the east side a\r\nrange of five smaller windows just under the vault. The principal windows\r\nare quite different from those of any other library I have been\r\nconsidering, for they are nearly 13 ft. high, and extend down to the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nThe wall-spaces between each pair of windows have bookcases fitted to\r\nthem, of a very original and striking design. They are divided into\r\ncompartments by fluted Doric columns supporting an entablature with\r\nprojecting cornice, above which again is a sort of second entablature. The\r\nbases of the columns rest upon an extremely lofty plinth, intersected, at\r\nabout three-quarters of its height from the ground, by a shelf, behind\r\nwhich is a sloping desk. The material used for these cases is mahogany,\r\ninlaid with ebony, cedar, and other woods. They were designed by Juan de\r\nHerrera, the architect of the building, in 1584, and I am assured that\r\nthey have escaped alteration, or serious damage from the numerous fires\r\nwhich have occurred in the palace.\r\n\r\nIn order to exhibit the distinctive peculiarities of these remarkable\r\ncases as clearly as possible, I give (fig. 118) an enlargement of part of\r\nthe former view; and further, an elevation of one of them drawn accurately\r\nto scale (fig. 119), for which I have to thank a Spanish architect, Don\r\nRicardo Velasquez.\r\n\r\nThese bookcases have a total height of rather more than 12 ft, measured\r\nfrom the floor to the top of the cornice. The desks are 2 ft. 7 in. from\r\nthe floor, a height which corresponds with that of an ordinary table, and\r\nsuggests that they must have been intended for the use of seated readers,\r\nthough seats are not provided in the library at present. The section of\r\nthe shelf and desk placed beside the elevation shews that there is a\r\nconvenient slope to lay the books against. The uppermost of the four\r\nshelves is at a height of 9 ft. from the ground, so that a ladder is\r\nrequired to reach the books. The two photographs which I have reproduced\r\n(figs. 117, 118) shew that they have the fore-edge turned outwards,\r\naccording to what is, I am informed, the usual custom in Spain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 119. Elevation of a bookcase, and section of a desk in\r\nthe Library of the Escorial.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 121. Interior of the Ambrosian Library at Milan.\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph taken in 1899.]\r\n\r\nI believe that the work done in the Escorial had a very definite effect on\r\nlibrary-fittings elsewhere; but, like other important inventions, the\r\nscheme of setting shelves against a wall instead of at right angles to it\r\noccurred to more than one person at about the same period; and therefore I\r\ncannot construct a genealogical tree, as I once thought I could, with the\r\nEscorial at the root, and a numerous progeny on the branches.\r\n\r\nBetween 1603 and 1609--only 25 years afterwards--Cardinal Federigo\r\nBorromeo built, endowed, and furnished the Biblioteca Ambrosiana at Milan.\r\nA plain Ionic portico, on the cornice of which are the words BIBLIOTHECA\r\nAMBROSIANA, gives access to a single hall, on the ground floor, 74 ft.\r\nlong by 29 ft. broad (fig. 120). The walls are lined with bookcases about\r\n13 ft. high, separated, not by columns, but by flat pilasters, and\r\nprotected by wire-work of an unusually large mesh, said to be original. At\r\neach corner of the hall is a staircase, leading to a gallery, 2 ft. 6 in.\r\nwide. The cases in this gallery are about 8 ft. 6 in. high. Above them\r\nagain is a frieze consisting of a series of portraits of saints in oblong\r\nframes. The roof is a barrel-vault, ornamented with plaster-work. Light is\r\nadmitted through two enormous semi-circular windows at each end of the\r\nroom. No alteration, I was informed when I visited the library in 1898,\r\nhas been permitted. Even the floor of plain tiles, with four tables (one\r\nat each corner), and a central brazier, is left as the Cardinal arranged\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 120. Ground-plan of the Ambrosian Library at Milan.\r\n\r\nReduced from that given by P. P. Boscha.]\r\n\r\nA good idea of the appearance of this noble room will be obtained from the\r\ngeneral view (fig. 121)[498]. The way in which the books were arranged\r\nwas evidently thought remarkable at the time, for a contemporary writer\r\nsays of it \"the room is not blocked with desks to which the books are tied\r\nwith iron chains after the fashion of the libraries which are common in\r\nmonasteries, but it is surrounded with lofty shelves on which the books\r\nare sorted according to size[499].\"\r\n\r\nThis library was part of a larger scheme which included a college of\r\ndoctors, a school of art, a museum, and a botanic garden; all of which\r\nwere amply endowed. The library was to be open not merely to members of\r\nthe college, but to the citizens of Milan and all strangers who came to\r\nstudy there; but the severest penalties awaited those who stole a volume,\r\nor even touched it with soiled hands; and only the Pope himself could\r\nabsolve them from such crimes[500].\r\n\r\nBefore many years were over these novelties in library arrangement and\r\nlibrary administration found a ready welcome in France, where Cardinal\r\nMazarin was engaged in the formation of a vast collection of books\r\nintended to surpass that of his predecessor Richelieu[501]. Even then his\r\nlibrary was public; all who chose to come might work in it on Thursdays\r\nfrom 8 to 11 in the morning, and from 2 to 5 in the afternoon. At a later\r\nperiod of his life, when he had removed to a palace now included in the\r\nBibliotheque Nationale, he was able to build a library in accordance with\r\nhis magnificent ideas. An accident of construction placed this room over\r\nthe stables, a conjunction which afforded endless amusement to the\r\npamphleteers of the time. It was finished at the end of 1647; and in the\r\nfollowing year the Cardinal threw it open, the first public library given\r\nto Paris. _Publice patere voluit, censu perpetuo dotavit, posteritati\r\ncommendavit_, said the inscription which he placed over the door of\r\nentrance. I need not attempt to recover from the somewhat conflicting\r\naccounts of admiring contemporaries the exact dimensions and arrangements\r\nof this gallery, for the bookcases still exist almost unaltered in the\r\nBibliotheque Mazarine. One detail deserves notice because it may have been\r\nborrowed from the Ambrosian Library. There is said to have been a\r\nstaircase in each of the four corners of the room by which access to a\r\ngallery was obtained[502].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 122. Bookcases in the Bibliotheque Mazarine, Paris.\r\n\r\nFrom a photograph by Dujardin, 1898.]\r\n\r\nMazarin died in 1661, and, in accordance with his will, a college, to be\r\ncalled _Le College des Quatre Nations_, was founded and endowed, and the\r\nlibrary was removed into it. The college was suppressed at the Revolution,\r\nand the buildings are now occupied by the _Institut de France_, but the\r\nlibrary remains practically intact. It occupies two rooms at right angles\r\nto each other with a united length of about 158 ft., and a width of 27 ft.\r\nThey are admirably lighted by 17 large windows.\r\n\r\nThe bookcases (fig. 122), from the original library in the Palais Mazarin,\r\nwere placed round the new room. At first they terminated with the cornice,\r\nsurmounted by the balustrade which protected the gallery mentioned above,\r\nand the roof was arched. In 1739, when additional shelf-room was required,\r\nand the roof was in need of repair, it was agreed to construct the present\r\nflat ceiling, and to gain thereby wall-space of sufficient height to\r\naccommodate 20,000 additional books. The gallery thus formed is approached\r\nby two staircases constructed at the same time[503].\r\n\r\nIf the elevation of these cases (fig. 123) be compared with that of the\r\ncases in the Escorial (fig. 119), I feel sure that my readers will agree\r\nwith me in admitting that the French example was copied from the Spanish.\r\nThe general arrangement is the same, and especially the really distinctive\r\nfeatures, namely, the division by columns, and the presence of a desk. It\r\nwill be observed that the French example is the larger of the two, being\r\n18 ft. high from the floor to the top of the cornice. The desk, moreover,\r\nis 4 ft. from the floor, so that it was evidently intended to be used\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\nI am aware that Naude, the librarian employed by Mazarin to collect books\r\nfor him, did not visit Spain, nor was Mazarin himself ever in that\r\ncountry. There is therefore no evidence to connect his library with that\r\nof Philip II., but in justification of my theory I submit that the\r\nresemblance is too close to be accidental, and that in all probability the\r\nlibrary at the Escorial had been much talked of in the world of letters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 123. Elevation of a bookcase and section of a desk in\r\nthe Bibliotheque Mazarine, Paris.]\r\n\r\nThe convenience of placing book-shelves against a wall was soon accepted\r\nin England, but at first in a somewhat half-hearted fashion. The earliest\r\ninstance of this, so far as I know, is to be met with in the Bodleian\r\nLibrary, Oxford, where the first stone of the eastern wing was laid in\r\n1610, and completed, with the fittings, in 1612[504].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 124. A portion of the bookcases set up in the eastern\r\nwing of the Bodleian Library, Oxford, built 1610-1612.\r\n\r\nFrom Loggan's _Oxonia Illustrata_, 1675.]\r\n\r\nAdvantage was taken of the whole of the wall-space provided by this\r\nextension, and it was lined with a bookcase extending from floor to\r\nceiling. In order to provide easy access to the upper shelves, a light\r\ngallery was provided, the pillars of which were utilised to support a seat\r\nfor the readers, because, the books being still chained, desks and seats\r\nwere indispensable. These cases still exist almost unaltered, but their\r\nappearance as first constructed has been preserved to us in Loggan's\r\nprint, taken about 1675, part of which is here reproduced (fig. 124).\r\n\r\nIn 1634 (13 May) the first stone was laid of the enlargement of the\r\nlibrary towards the west, corresponding exactly to the wing at the\r\nopposite end erected twenty-four years before[505]. The fittings were on\r\nthe same plan, but of a more elaborate and highly finished design, the\r\nplain supports of the former work being replaced by Ionic columns\r\nsupporting arches with frieze and cornice, and a heavy balustrade for the\r\ngallery above.\r\n\r\nI now come to the influence exercised upon the architecture and fittings\r\nof libraries by Sir Christopher Wren, and I shall be able to shew that\r\nthough he did not actually introduce the wall-system into England, he\r\ndeveloped it, adapted it to our requirements, and by the force of his\r\ngenius shewed what structural changes were necessary in order to meet the\r\nincreased number of books to be accommodated. Wren never visited Italy,\r\nbut in 1665 he spent about six months in Paris, where he made the\r\nacquaintance of the best painters, sculptors, and architects, among whom\r\nwas the Italian Bernini. From him he might easily obtain information of\r\nwhat was passing in Italy, though he describes him as \"the old reserved\r\nItalian\" who would hardly allow him a glimpse of a design for which, says\r\nWren, \"I would have given my skin.\" French work he studied\r\nenthusiastically, and after giving a list of places he had visited says,\r\n\"that I might not lose the impressions of them I shall bring you almost\r\nall France in paper.\" Among other things he specially records his\r\nadmiration for what he terms \"the masculine furniture of the Palais\r\nMazarin,\" though he does not specially mention the library; but, as\r\nMazarin had died four years before, his palace would have been practically\r\ndismantled, and the only furniture likely to attract Wren's attention\r\nwould have been his bookcases[506].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 125. Entrance to Wren's Library at Lincoln Cathedral,\r\nwith part of the bookcase which lines the north wall.]\r\n\r\nThe first piece of library work executed by Wren in England was at Lincoln\r\nCathedral, 1674, where after the Restoration a new library was required.\r\nDr Michael Honywood, who had been appointed Dean in 1660, offered to build\r\none at his own cost, and to present to it the books which he had collected\r\nin Holland. The site selected was that formerly occupied by the north\r\nalley of the cloister, which, through faulty construction, had fallen\r\ndown, and lain in ruins for a long period.\r\n\r\nThe building consists of an arcade of nine semicircular arches supported\r\non eight Doric columns. The upper storey, containing the library, has\r\neleven windows in a similar classical style, and above there is a bold\r\nentablature ornamented with acanthus leaves. The library is 104 ft. long\r\nby 17 ft. 6 in. wide and 14 ft. high; the ceiling is flat and perfectly\r\nplain. In addition to the windows above mentioned there is another at the\r\nwest end. The entrance is at the east end through a richly ornamented door\r\n(fig. 125). The shield in the centre of the pediment bears the arms of\r\nDean Honywood.\r\n\r\nWren placed a continuous bookcase along the north wall of this room,\r\nextending from floor to ceiling. At the base there is a plinth (fig. 125),\r\nwhich may have originally contained cupboards, but is now fitted with\r\nshelves; and at the top, close to the ceiling, there is a heavy\r\nentablature decorated with acanthus leaves and classical moldings above a\r\nplain cornice, which bears at intervals oblong tablets inscribed with the\r\nsubjects of the books beneath. The shelves are disposed in compartments,\r\nalternately wide and narrow, the former being set slightly in advance of\r\nthe latter, so as to break the monotony of a bookcase of uniform width\r\nextending the whole length of a long room.\r\n\r\nWhile this work was proceeding Wren planned the New Library for Trinity\r\nCollege, Cambridge[507], begun 23 February, 1675-6. His design is\r\naccompanied by an explanation, contained in a rough draught of a letter to\r\nsome gentleman of Trinity College, probably the Master. It is not signed,\r\nbut internal evidence shews that it must have been written or dictated by\r\nWren.\r\n\r\nThis library was placed on a cloister, open both to the east and to the\r\nwest, at the end of Nevile's Court. The level of the library floor was\r\nmade to correspond with that of the first floor of the chambers on the\r\nnorth and south sides of the court. This is shewn in Wren's design, part\r\nof which is here reproduced (fig. 126), and explained in the following\r\npassage of his memoir.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 126. Part of Wren's elevation of the east side of the\r\nLibrary of Trinity College, Cambridge, with a section of the north range\r\nof Nevile's Court, shewing the door to the Library from the first floor.]\r\n\r\n    [The design] shewes the face of the building next the\r\n    court with the pavillions for the stairecases and the\r\n    Sections of the old buildings where they joyne to the\r\n    new....\r\n\r\n    I haue given the appearance of arches as the Order\r\n    required fair and lofty: but I haue layd the floor of\r\n    the Library upon the impostes, which answar (_sic_) to\r\n    the pillars in the cloister and the levells of the old\r\n    floores, and haue filled the Arches with relieues of\r\n    stone, of which I haue seen the effect abroad in good\r\n    building, and I assure you where porches are lowe with\r\n    flat ceelings is infinitely more gracefull then lowe\r\n    arches would be and is much more open and pleasant, nor\r\n    need the mason freare (_sic_) the performance because\r\n    the Arch discharges the weight, and I shall direct him\r\n    in a firme manner of executing the designe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 127. Elevation of one bay on the east side of the\r\nLibrary of Trinity College, Cambridge, drawn to scale from the existing\r\nbuilding.]\r\n\r\n    By this contrivance the windowes of the Library rise\r\n    high and giue place for the deskes against the walls,\r\n    and being high may be afforded to be large, and being\r\n    wide may haue stone mullions and the glasse pointed,\r\n    which after all inventions is the only durable way in\r\n    our Climate for a publique building, where care must be\r\n    had that snowe driue not in....\r\n\r\nThe general design seems to have been borrowed from that of the Library of\r\nS. Mark at Venice, begun by Sansovino in 1536. The Italian architect, like\r\nSir Christopher Wren, raised his library on a cloister, which is in the\r\nDoric style, while the superstructure is Ionic. The Venetian example is\r\nmore ornate, and there are statues upon every pier of the balustrade. The\r\narcades are left open, because there was not the same necessity for\r\naccommodating the level of the floor to that of older buildings, and also\r\nbecause the wall opposite to the windows had to be left blank on account\r\nof the proximity of other structures. No consideration for fittings such\r\nas influenced Wren could have influenced the Italian architect.\r\n\r\nThe style of Wren's work will be understood from the elevation of a bay on\r\nthe east side (fig. 127), drawn to scale from the existing building. If\r\nthis be compared with the original design (fig. 126), it will be seen that\r\nthe style there indicated has been closely followed.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider the fittings. A long stretch of blank wall having\r\nbeen provided both along the sides and at the ends of the room, Wren\r\nproceeded to design a masterly combination of the old and new methods of\r\narranging bookcases. As he says in another passage of the same memoir,\r\nwhen describing this part of his design:\r\n\r\n    The disposition of the shelues both along the walls and\r\n    breaking out from the walls ... must needes proue very\r\n    convenient and gracefull, and the best way for the\r\n    students will be to haue a litle square table in each\r\n    Celle with 2 chaires. The necessity of bringing windowes\r\n    and dores to answer to the old building leaues two\r\n    squarer places at the endes and 4 lesser Celles not to\r\n    study in, but to be shut up with some neat Lattice dores\r\n    for archives.\r\n\r\nThe bookcases, designed by himself, were executed under his direction by\r\nCornelius Austin, a Cambridge workman. My illustration (fig. 128) shews\r\none of the \"4 lesser Celles\" with one of its doors open, and next to it a\r\n\"Celle\" for students with table, revolving desk, and two stools. These\r\npieces of furniture were also designed by Wren.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 128. Interior of the north-east corner of the Library\r\nof Trinity College, Cambridge, shewing the bookcases, table, desk and\r\nchairs, as designed by Sir C. Wren.]\r\n\r\nThe cases are 11 ft. 10 in. high, and the wooden floor upon which they\r\nstand is raised higher than that of the library. The great depth of the\r\nplinth, which Wren utilised for cupboards, recalls the plan of some of the\r\nolder cases, and there is the little cupboard to contain the catalogue at\r\nthe end of each standard; but, with these exceptions, there is nothing\r\nmedieval about them except their position. On the top of each case is a\r\nsquare pedestal of wood on which Wren intended to place a statue, but this\r\npart of his scheme was not carried out. The celebrated Grinling Gibbons\r\nsupplied the busts which take the place of Wren's statues, and also the\r\ncoats of arms and wreaths of flowers and fruit with which the ends of the\r\ncases are decorated.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to decide the source from which an architect so great as\r\nWren derived any feature of his buildings, but it seems to me reasonable\r\nto ascribe to foreign influence his use of the side-walls at Trinity\r\nCollege library; and his scheme for combining a lofty internal wall with\r\nbeauty of external design, and a complete system of lighting, must always\r\ncommand admiration. In the next example of his library work foreign\r\ninfluence may be more directly traced, for I feel that the library of S.\r\nPaul's Cathedral suggests reminiscences of the Ambrosian library at Milan.\r\n\r\nWren placed the library of his new cathedral in the western transept, with\r\nan ingenuity of contrivance and a dignity of conception peculiarly his\r\nown. On the level of what in a Gothic church would have been the\r\ntriforium, he constructed, both on the north and south side, a large and\r\nlofty room. It was his intention that each of these rooms should be used\r\nas a library, and that they should be connected by means of the gallery\r\nwhich crosses the west end of the nave. Access to them was to be obtained\r\nfrom the exterior, without entering the church, by a circular staircase in\r\nthe south-west corner of the facade. This plan has not been fully carried\r\nout, and the southern library only has been fitted up. It is now usually\r\nreached by means of the staircase leading to the dome.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements will be understood from the ground-plan (fig.\r\n129)[508]. This plan shews very clearly the library itself, the two\r\ncircular staircases at the west end, leading up to the gallery, the wide\r\ngeometrical staircase leading down to the portico, the corridor into which\r\nthis staircase opens, and from which a visitor could either ascend by a\r\nflight of stairs to the gallery crossing the nave, or, turning to his\r\nright, either enter the library, or pass eastwards towards the dome.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 129, Ground plan of Library and adjacent parts of S.\r\nPaul's Cathedral, London.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 130. Sir Christopher Wren's Library at S. Paul's\r\nCathedral, London, looking north-east.]\r\n\r\nThe library (fig. 130) is a well-lighted room, with an area measuring 53\r\nft. by 32 ft, and of sufficient height to admit of the introduction of a\r\ngallery under the vault. A massive stone pier projects into the room at\r\neach corner, so as to break the formal regularity of the design in a very\r\npleasing manner. The gallery, together with the bookcases, which stand\r\nagainst the walls, both in the gallery and below it, were either\r\ndesigned by Wren himself, or placed there with his approval. The Building\r\nAccounts[509] contain many valuable pieces of information respecting the\r\nhistory of the room and its fittings. The floor \"in the south library\" was\r\nlaid down in July, 1708, as was also that in the gallery; the windows \"in\r\nthe north and south library,\" words which shew very clearly that the\r\ncorresponding room on the north side was also intended for a library, were\r\npainted in December, 1708; and the ornamental woodwork was supplied in\r\nMarch, 1708-9. From the entries referring to these works I will quote the\r\nfollowing, as it particularises the most striking feature in the room,\r\nnamely, the large ornamental brackets which appear to support the gallery:\r\n\r\n    To Jonathan Maine Carver in the South Library, viz. For\r\n    carving 32 Trusses or Cantalivers under the Gallary, 3\r\n    ft. 8 in. long, and 3 ft. 8 in. deep and 7 in. thick\r\n    with Leather worke cut through and a Leaf in the front\r\n    and a drop hanging down with fruit and flowers etc. at\r\n    6^l. 10^s. each.\r\n\r\n                                                208^l.----\r\n\r\nThe words \"leather work,\" used in the above entry, are singularly\r\nsuitable, for the whole composition looks more like something molded out\r\nof leather or plaster than cut out of a solid piece of wood. The vertical\r\nportion, applied to the pilasters, consists of a bunch of flowers, hops,\r\nand corn, somewhat in the manner of Grinling Gibbons, who has been often\r\nnamed as the artist. The above-mentioned pilasters divide the wall-space\r\ninto 33 compartments, each of which is from 3 ft. 6 in. to 4 ft. wide, and\r\n9 ft. high, exclusive of the plinth and cornice, and fitted with six\r\nshelves, which are apparently at the original levels.\r\n\r\nThe gallery is approached by a staircase contrived in the thickness of the\r\nsouth-west pier. It is 5 ft. wide, and fitted with bookcases ranged\r\nagainst the wall in the same manner as those below, but they are loftier,\r\nand of plainer design. The balustrade, a molded cornice of wood, supported\r\non pilasters of the same material, which recall those separating the\r\ncompartments below, and the great stone piers, enriched with a broad band\r\nof fruit, flowers, and other ornaments set in a sunk panel, are striking\r\nfeatures of this gallery.\r\n\r\nThe material used throughout for the fittings is oak, which fortunately\r\nhas never been painted, and has assumed a mellow tone through age which\r\nproduces a singularly beautiful effect.\r\n\r\nIf we now return to Cambridge, we shall find that the influence of Wren\r\ncan easily be traced in all the library fittings put up in the course of\r\nthe 18th century. The first work of this kind undertaken was the provision\r\nof additional fittings to the library of Emmanuel College[510] between\r\n1702 and 1707. The tall cases, set up at right angles to the walls in\r\n1679, were moved forward, and shelves in continuation of them were placed\r\nagainst the side-walls. The same influence is more distinctly seen in the\r\nlibrary of S. Catharine's Hall[511], which was fitted up, according to\r\ntradition, at the expense of Thomas Sherlock, D.D., probably while Master,\r\nan office which he held from 1714 to 1719. The room is 63 ft. 6 in. long\r\nby 22 ft. 10 in. wide; and it is divided by partitions into a central\r\nportion, about 39 ft. long, and a narrow room at each end, 12 ft. long.\r\nEach of these latter is lighted by windows in the north and south walls;\r\nthe former has windows in the south wall only. The central portion is\r\ndivided into three compartments by bookcases which line the walls, and\r\nproject from them at right angles; in the two smaller rooms the cases only\r\nline the walls, the space being too narrow for any other treatment.\r\n\r\nWhen the building of the new Senate House had set free the room called the\r\nRegent House, in which the University had been in the habit of meeting\r\nfrom very early times, it was fitted up, between 1731 and 1734, as part of\r\nthe University Library[512]. Wren's example was followed as far as the\r\nnature of the room would permit. Wherever a blank wall could be found, it\r\nwas lined with shelves, and the cases placed at right angles to the\r\nside-walls were continued over the narrow spaces left between their ends\r\nand the windows. One of these cases, from the south side of the room, is\r\nhere shewn (fig. 131). The shelves under the windows were added\r\nsubsequently. A similar arrangement was adopted for the east room in\r\n1787-90.\r\n\r\nAt Clare College, at about the same date, the new library over the kitchen\r\nwas fitted up with shelves placed against the walls. These fittings are\r\nexcellent specimens, ornamented with fluted Ionic pilasters, an elaborate\r\ncornice, and pediments above the doors. It is worth noting, as evidence of\r\nthe slowness with which new fashions are accepted, that the antiquary\r\nWilliam Cole, writing in 1742, calls this library \"a very large\r\nwell-proportion'd Room a la moderne, w^th ye Books rang'd all round it &\r\nnot in Classes as in most of y^e rest of y^e Libraries in other\r\nColleges[513].\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 131. Bookcase in the north room of the University\r\nLibrary, Cambridge, designed by James Essex, 1731-1734.]\r\n\r\nThe fashion of which I have been tracing the progress in England had been\r\naccepted during the same period in France, where some beautiful specimens\r\nof it may still be seen. I presume that the example was set by the wealthy\r\nconvents, most of which had been rebuilt, at least in part, in the then\r\nfashionable classical style, during the seventeenth century[514]. At\r\nRheims a library fitted up by the Benedictines of Saint Remi in 1784 now\r\ndoes duty as the chapel of the Hotel-Dieu. Fluted Corinthian columns\r\nsupporting an elaborate cornice divide the walls into compartments, in\r\nwhich the books are ranged on open shelves. The room is 120 ft. long, by\r\n31 ft. broad, with four windows on each side. With this may be compared\r\nthe public library at Alencon, the fittings of which are said to have been\r\nbrought from the abbey of the Val Dieu near Mortain at the Revolution. The\r\nroom is 70 ft. long by 25 ft. wide. Against the walls are 26 compartments\r\nor presses, alternately open and closed. Each of these terminates in an\r\nogee arch enriched with scrolls and a central shield. The whole series is\r\nsurmounted by a cornice divided by console brackets, between which are\r\nshields, probably intended originally to carry the names of the subjects\r\nof the books.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 132. Interior of the Library of the Jesuits at Rheims,\r\nnow the _Lingerie de l'Hopital General_.]\r\n\r\nLastly, I must mention the libraries of Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette at\r\nVersailles. The walls are lined with a double row of presses, each closed\r\nby glass doors. The lower row is about four feet high, the upper row about\r\nten feet high. The wood-work is painted white, and enriched with wreaths\r\nof leaves in ormolu. As a general rule the books are hidden from view by\r\ncurtains of pleated silk.\r\n\r\nI mentioned in a previous chapter[515] that additional space was provided\r\nfor the library in a French monastery by raising the roof of an existing\r\nbuilding, putting in dormer windows, and converting the triangular space\r\nso gained into a library by placing in it bookcases of a convenient\r\nheight, and connecting them together by a ceiling. I have fortunately\r\ndiscovered one such library still in existence at Rheims. It belonged\r\noriginally to the Jesuits, who had constructed it about 1678, and when the\r\nOrder was expelled from France in 1764, and their House became the\r\nworkhouse (_hopital general_) of the town, it was fortunately made use of\r\nas the _lingerie_, or linen-room, without any material change. Even the\r\ntable has been preserved. The view here presented of the interior (fig.\r\n132) may serve to give a general idea, not merely of this library, but of\r\nothers of the same class. The decoration of the ceiling is coarse but\r\neffective. On the coved portion of it, within the shields, are written the\r\nsubjects of the books on the shelves beneath. I made a list of these and\r\nhave printed them on the margin of my ground-plan (fig. 133). This plan\r\nalso shews the arrangement of the bookcases. They are placed at a distance\r\nof five feet from the walls, and are returned to meet each window, thus\r\nforming convenient bays for private study. The space between the bookcases\r\nand the wall was used as a store-room[516].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 133. Ground-plan of the Library of the Jesuits at\r\nRheims.\r\n\r\nThe Bibliotheque Sainte-Genevieve, at Paris, offered originally a splendid\r\nexample of a library arranged in this manner. It consisted of two\r\ngalleries, at right angles to each other, fitted up in the same style as\r\nthe library at Rheims. The longest of these galleries was 147 ft. long by\r\n24 ft. wide. The guidebooks prepared for the use of visitors to Paris in\r\nthe middle of the 18th century dwell with enthusiasm on the convenience\r\nand beauty of this room. The books were protected by wire-work; between\r\neach pair of cases was a bust of a Roman emperor or an ancient\r\nphilosopher; at the crossing of the two galleries was a dome which seemed\r\nto be supported on a palm-tree in plaster-work at each corner, out of the\r\nfoliage of which peered the heads of cherubs; while the convenience of\r\nreaders was consulted by the liberality with which the library was thrown\r\nopen on three days in every week, and furnished with tables, chairs, a\r\nladder to reach the upper shelves, and a pair of globes[517]. This library\r\nwas begun in 1675, and placed, like that at Rheims, directly under the\r\nroof. The second gallery, which is shorter than the first, was added in\r\n1726. It was not disturbed at the Revolution, nor under the Empire, though\r\nthe rest of the abbey-buildings became the Lycee Napoleon. After the\r\nRestoration, when this school became the College Henri IV., the presence\r\nof the library was found to be inconvenient, and in 1850 it was removed to\r\na new building close to the Pantheon. The galleries are now used as a\r\ndormitory for the school-boys, but the dome, with some of its decorations,\r\nstill survives.\r\n\r\nAnother example of this arrangement, which seems to have been peculiarly\r\nFrench, is afforded by the library of Saint Germain-des-Pres, the gradual\r\nextension of which I have already described[518]. The books were contained\r\nin oak presses set against the walls. Above them was a series of portraits\r\nrepresenting the most important personages in the Order of S. Benedict.\r\nThis library was open to the public daily from 9 to 11 a.m. and from 3 to\r\n5 p.m.[519]\r\n\r\nI will conclude this chapter with a few words on the library of the most\r\nfamous of all European monasteries, namely Monte Cassino, the foundation\r\nof which was undoubtedly laid by S. Benedict himself. I confess that I had\r\nhoped to find there a library which might either by its position or its\r\nfittings recall the early days of monasticism; but unfortunately the piety\r\nof the Benedictine Order has induced them to rebuild their parent house in\r\na classical style, and to obliterate nearly every trace of the primitive\r\nbuilding. The library, to which I was obligingly conducted by the Prior,\r\nis 60 ft. long by 30 ft. broad, with two large windows at the end opposite\r\nto the door. The side-walls are lined with bookcases divided by columns\r\ninto four compartments on each side, after the fashion of Cardinal\r\nMazarin's library. These columns support a heavy cornice with handsome\r\nornaments. A band of woodwork divides the cases into an upper and lower\r\nrange, but there is no trace of a desk. I could not learn the date at\r\nwhich these fittings had been constructed, but from their style I should\r\nassign them to the middle of the seventeenth century[520].\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[494] See above, p. 196.\r\n\r\n[495] See above, p. 224.\r\n\r\n[496] See above, p. 233.\r\n\r\n[497] For the history of the Escorial, see Ford, _Handbook for Spain_, Ed.\r\n1855, pp. 749-763, and _Descripcion ... del Escorial_, Fra de los Santos,\r\nfol.

ABBAT SIMON AND HIS BOOK-CHEST. LIBRARY OF CHARLES V.\r\nOF FRANCE. ILLUSTRATIONS OF THIS LIBRARY FROM ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS.\r\nBOOK-LECTERN USED IN PRIVATE HOUSES. BOOK-DESKS REVOLVING ROUND A CENTRAL\r\nSCREW. DESKS ATTACHED TO CHAIRS. WALL-CUPBOARDS. A SCHOLAR'S ROOM IN THE\r\nFIFTEENTH CENTURY. STUDY OF THE DUKE OF URBINO. LIBRARY OF MONTAIGNE.\r\nLIBRARY OF MARGARET OF AUSTRIA. CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the previous chapters I have sketched the history of library-fittings\r\nfrom the earliest times to the end of the eighteenth century. The\r\nlibraries to which these fittings belonged were, for the most part,\r\npublic, or as good as public. But, as in history we have recognised the\r\nimportant fact that a record of battles and sieges and enactments in\r\nParliament gives an imperfect conception of the life of a people, so I\r\nshould feel that this archeological subject had been insufficiently\r\ntreated if I made no attempt to shew how private scholars disposed their\r\nbooks, or with what appliances they used them. For instance, in what sort\r\nof chair was the author of the _Philobiblon_ sitting when he wrote the\r\nlast words of his treatise, 24 January, 1345, and how was his study in his\r\npalace at Auckland furnished? Further, how were private students bestowed\r\nin the fifteenth century, when a love of letters had become general?\r\nLastly, how were libraries fitted up for private use in the succeeding\r\ncentury, when the great people of the earth, like the wealthy Romans of\r\nimperial times, added the pursuit of literature to their other fashions,\r\nand considered a library to be indispensable in their luxurious palaces?\r\n\r\nIn the hope of obtaining reliable information on these interesting\r\nquestions, I have for some years past let no opportunity slip of examining\r\nilluminated manuscripts. I have gone through a large number in the British\r\nMuseum, where research is aided by an excellent list of the subjects\r\nillustrated; in the _Bibliotheque Nationale_, Paris; and in the\r\n_Bibliotheque Royale_, Brussels, where the manuscripts are for the most\r\npart those which once belonged to the Dukes of Burgundy. I have been\r\nsomewhat disappointed in this search, for, with the single exception of\r\nthe illustration from Boethius (fig. 63), I have not found any library,\r\nproperly so called. This is no doubt strange, having regard to the great\r\nvariety of scenes depicted. It must be remembered, however, that these are\r\nused for the most part to illustrate some action that is going forward,\r\nfor which a library would be a singularly inappropriate background. Single\r\nfigures, on the other hand, are frequently shewn with their books about\r\nthem, either reading or writing. Such illustrations most frequently occur\r\nin _Books of Hours_, in representations of the Evangelists; or in\r\nportraits of S. Jerome, who is painted as a scholar at his desk surrounded\r\nby piles of books and papers; and I think we may safely take these as\r\nrepresentations of ordinary scholars, because, by the beginning of the\r\nfifteenth century, when most of the pictures to which I refer were drawn,\r\nit had become the custom to surround even the most sacred personages with\r\nthe attributes of common life.\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth century, when books were few, they were kept in chests, and\r\nthe owners seem to have used the edge as a desk to lean their book on. My\r\nillustration (fig. 134) shews Simon, Abbat of S. Albans 1167-1183, seated\r\nin front of his book-chest[521]. The chest is set on a frame, so as to\r\nraise it to a convenient height; and the Abbat is seated on one of those\r\nfolding wooden chairs which are not uncommon at the present day. Simon was\r\na great collector of books: \"their number,\" writes his chronicler, \"it\r\nwould take too long to name; but those who desire to see them can find\r\nthem in the painted aumbry in the church, placed as he specially directed\r\nagainst the tomb of Roger the hermit[522].\"\r\n\r\nChests, as we have seen above at the Vatican library, were used for the\r\npermanent storage of books in the fifteenth century; and a book-chest\r\nfrequently formed part of the travelling luggage of a king. For example,\r\nwhen Charles V. of France died, 16 September, 1380, at the Chateau de\r\nBeaute-sur-Marne, thirty-one volumes were found in his chamber \"in a chest\r\nresting on two supports, which chest is by the window, near the fireplace,\r\nand it has a double cover, and in one of the divisions of the said chest\r\nwere the volumes that follow.\" His son, Charles VI., kept the thirteen\r\nvolumes which he carried about with him in a carved chest, within which\r\nwas an inlaid box (_escrin marquete_) to contain the more precious\r\nbooks[523].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 134. Simon, Abbat of S. Albans (1167-1183), seated at\r\nhis book-chest.\r\n\r\nFrom MSS. Cotton.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest information about the furniture of a medieval private library\r\nthat I have as yet discovered is contained in a fragment of an\r\naccount-book recording the cost of fitting up a tower in the Louvre in\r\n1367 and 1368, to contain the books belonging to Charles V. of France.\r\nCertain pieces of woodwork in the older library in the palace on the Isle\r\nde la Cite are to be taken down and altered, and set up in the new room.\r\nTwo carpenters are paid (14 March, 1367) for \"having taken to pieces all\r\nthe cases (_bancs_) and two wheels (_roes_), which were in the king's\r\nlibrary in the palace, and transported them to the Louvre with the desks\r\n(_lettrins_), and the aforesaid wheels, each made smaller by a foot all\r\nround; and for having put all together again, and hung up the desks\r\n(_lettrins_) in the two upper stages of the tower that looks toward the\r\nFalconry, to put the king's books in; and for having panelled the first of\r\nthose two stories all round on the inside with wood from 'Illande,' at a\r\ntotal cost of fifty francs of gold. Next, because the seats were too old,\r\nthey were remade of new timber which the aforesaid carpenters brought.\r\nAlso [they were paid] for two strong doors for the said two stories 7 ft.\r\nhigh, 3 ft. broad, and 3 fingers thick.\" In the following year (4 May,\r\n1368), a wire-worker (_cagetier_) is paid \"for having made trellises of\r\nwire in front of two casements and two windows ... to keep out birds and\r\nother beasts (_oyscaux et autres bestes_), by reason of, and protection\r\nfor, the books that shall be placed there.\" The ceiling is said to have\r\nbeen panelled in cypress wood ornamented with carvings[524].\r\n\r\nThe \"tower that looks toward the Falconry\" mentioned in the above\r\ndescription has been identified with the north-west tower of the old\r\nLouvre. The rooms fitted up as a library were circular, and about 14 feet\r\nin diameter[525].\r\n\r\nThe above description of a library will be best explained by an\r\nillumination (fig. 135) contained in Boccacio's _Livre des cas des\r\nmalheureux nobles hommes et femmes_, written and illuminated in Flanders\r\nfor King Henry the Seventh, and now in the British Museum[526]. Two\r\ngentlemen are studying at a revolving desk, which can be raised or lowered\r\nby a central screw. This is evidently the \"wheel\" of the French King's\r\nlibrary. Behind are their books, either resting on a desk hung against the\r\nwall, which is panelled, or lying on a shelf beneath the desk. This piece\r\nof furniture would be properly described either as a _banc_ or a\r\n_lettrin_. It should be noted that care has been taken to keep the wheel\r\nsteady by supporting it on a solid base, beneath which are two strong\r\ncross-pieces of timber, which also serve as a foot-rest for the readers.\r\nThe books on the desk set against the wall are richly bound, with bosses\r\nof metal. Chaining was evidently not thought of, indeed I doubt if it was\r\never used in a private library. The window is glazed throughout. In other\r\nexamples which I shall figure below we shall find a wire trellis used\r\ninstead of glass for part at least of the window.\r\n\r\nMy next illustration (fig. 136), also Flemish, is of the same date, from a\r\ncopy of the _Miroir historial_[527]. It represents a Carmelite monk,\r\nprobably the author of the book, writing in his study. Behind him are\r\nthree desks, one above the other, hung against the wall along two sides of\r\nthe room, with books bound and ornamented as in the former picture,\r\nresting upon them, and beneath the lowest is a flat shelf or bench on\r\nwhich a book rests upon its side. The desk he is using is not uncommon in\r\nthese illustrations. It is fixed on a solid base, which is further\r\nstrengthened, as in the example of the wheel-desk, by massive planks, to\r\nguard against the slightest vibration; and it can be turned aside by means\r\nof a limb--apparently of iron--which is first vertical, then horizontal,\r\nthen vertical again. The Carmelite holds in his left hand an instrument\r\nfor keeping the page perfectly flat. This instrument has usually a sharp\r\npoint with which any roughness on the page can be readily removed. The\r\nvolume he is using is kept open by two strings, to each of which a weight\r\nis attached. Behind the desk, covered with a cloth, is a chest secured by\r\ntwo locks. On this stands an object which appears to be a large magnifying\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nSometimes the desk was carried round three sides of the room, with no\r\ncurtain to keep off dust, and with no shelf beneath it. The illustration\r\n(fig. 137) is from a French translation of Valerius Maximus (1430-75) in\r\nthe Harleian Collection[528].\r\n\r\nI now pass to a series of pictures which illustrate the daily life of a\r\nscholar or a writer who had few books, but who could live in a certain\r\nease--allowing himself a chair and a desk. Of these desks there is an\r\ninfinite variety, dictated, I imagine, by the fashion prevalent in\r\nparticular places at particular times. I have tried to arrange them in\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 136. A Carmelite in his study.\r\n\r\nFrom a MS. of _Le Miroir Historial_ in the British Museum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 137. Three musicians in a library.\r\n\r\nFrom a MS. of a French translation of _Valerius Maximus_, in the British\r\nMuseum.]\r\n\r\nIn the first place the chair is usually a rather elaborate piece of\r\nfurniture, with arms, a straight back, and, very frequently, a canopy. A\r\ncushion to sit upon is sometimes permitted, but, as a general rule, these\r\nchairs are destitute of stuffing, tapestry, or other device to conceal the\r\nmaterial of which they are made. Occasionally the canopy is richly carved\r\nor painted in a pattern.\r\n\r\nThe commonest form of desk is a modification of the lectern-system. It\r\nconsists of a double lectern, beneath which is a row of cupboards, or\r\nrather a shelf protected by several doors, one of which is always at the\r\nend of the piece of furniture. The triangular space under the lectern is\r\nalso used for books. This device is specially commended by Richard de Bury\r\nin the _Philobiblon_[529]. \"Moses,\" says he, \"the gentlest of men, teaches\r\nus to make bookcases most neatly, wherein they may be protected from any\r\ninjury: _Take_, he says, _this book of the law, and put it in the side of\r\nthe ark of the covenant of the Lord your God_.\" My illustration (fig. 138)\r\nis taken from an edition of the _Ship of Fools_, printed at Basle by\r\nNicolas Lamparter in 1507. In this example the desk with its cupboards\r\nstands on a plinth, and this again on a broad step. Both are probably\r\nintroduced to ensure steadiness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 138. A bibliomaniac at his desk.\r\n\r\nFrom the _Ship of Fools_.]\r\n\r\nThe seated figure represents a bibliomaniac who treats his books as mere\r\ncuriosities from which he derives no mental improvement. He has put on his\r\nspectacles and wielded his feather-brush, in order to dust the leaves of a\r\nfolio with greater care. Under the cut are the following explanatory\r\nlines:\r\n\r\n  Qui libros tyriis vestit honoribus\r\n  Et blattas abijt puluerulentulas\r\n  Nec discens animum litterulis colit:\r\n  Mercatur nimia stultieiam stipe.\r\n\r\nI append a rough translation:\r\n\r\n  Who clothes his books in Tyrian dyes,\r\n  Then brushes off the dust and flies,\r\n  Nor reads one line to make him wise,\r\n  Spends lavish gold and--FOLLY buys.\r\n\r\nSuch a desk as this was used in the succeeding century in at least two\r\nlibraries belonging to ladies of high rank. The first belonged to Margaret\r\nof Austria, daughter of Maximilian, Emperor of Germany. She had been the\r\nwife of Philibert II., Duke of Savoy, and after his death, 10 September,\r\n1504, her father made her regent of the Netherlands. She died at Malines\r\n30 November, 1530, at the age of fifty. She seems to have been a liberal\r\npatroness of literature and the arts, and the beautiful church that she\r\nbuilt at Brou in memory of her husband bears witness to her architectural\r\ntaste and skill.\r\n\r\nThe inventory, out of which I hope to reconstruct her library, is dated 20\r\nApril, 1524[530]. It is headed: \"Library,\" and begins with the following\r\nentry: \"The first desk (_pourpitre_) begins over the door, and goes all\r\nround up to the fireplace.\" On this desk or shelf are enumerated fifty-two\r\nvolumes, all bound in velvet with gilt bosses. This entry is succeeded by:\r\n\"here follow the Books of Hours, being on a desk high up in continuation\r\nof the preceding one between the windows and the fireplace.\" This desk\r\ncontains twenty-six volumes bound in velvet, red satin, or cloth of gold,\r\nwith gilt bosses.\r\n\r\nWe come next to \"the first desk below (_d'ambas_) beginning near the door\r\nat the first seat.\" This desk carries nine books, presumably on the\r\nsloping portion, because we presently come to a paragraph headed \"here\r\nfollow the books covered with leather &c., which are underneath the desks\r\nbeginning near the door.\" The author of the inventory then returns to the\r\nfirst desk, and enumerates eleven volumes. He next goes round to \"the\r\nother side of the said desk,\" and enumerates thirteen volumes. In this\r\nway six desks are gone through. All have books bound in black, blue,\r\ncrimson, or violet, velvet laid out upon them, while those in plainer\r\ndress are consigned to the shelves beneath. It should be added that the\r\nfourth desk is described as being near the fireplace (_empres la\r\nchemynee_).\r\n\r\nThe desks having been gone through, we come to \"the books which are within\r\nthe iron trellis beginning near the door.\" This piece of furniture\r\ncontained twenty-seven volumes.\r\n\r\nThe number of books accommodated in the whole room was as follows:\r\n\r\n  First shelf                              52\r\n  Second shelf                             26   78\r\n  First desk (sloping portion)         9\r\n  Under desk: one side           11\r\n  \"     \"     other side         13   24   33\r\n                                 --------\r\n  Second desk                         21\r\n                                 11\r\n                                 10   21   42\r\n                                 --------\r\n  Third   \"    \"                      26\r\n                                 13\r\n                                 10   23   49\r\n                                 --------\r\n  Fourth  \"    \"                      15\r\n                                 18\r\n                                 14   32   47\r\n                                 --------\r\n  Fifth   \"    \"                      19\r\n                                 11\r\n                                 10   21   40\r\n                                 --------\r\n  Sixth   \"    \"                      20\r\n                                  9\r\n                                 10   19   39   250\r\n                                 --------\r\n  Within the trellis-work                        27\r\n                                                355\r\n\r\nWe will next try to form some idea of the way in which this library was\r\narranged; and first of the two shelves which begin \"over the door.\" A\r\nshelf in this position is shewn in Carpaccio's well-known picture of S.\r\nJerome in his study. It is set deskwise against the wall supported on iron\r\nbrackets. As a large proportion of the fifty-two volumes on our shelf are\r\ndescribed as of large size (_grant_), we shall be justified in assuming\r\nthat each was 10 in. broad. The total therefore would occupy 520 in. or\r\nsay 43 ft. at least, not allowing for intervals between them. This shelf\r\nextended from the door round the room to the fireplace, by which I suppose\r\nwe are to understand that it began on the wall which contained the door,\r\nand was carried round the corner of the room up to the fireplace.\r\n\r\nThe second shelf, at the same height as the preceding, contained only\r\ntwenty-six volumes, fifteen of which are described as small (_petit_). A\r\nspace of thirteen feet or even less will therefore be amply sufficient to\r\ncontain them.\r\n\r\nThe six desks which stood on the floor were, I imagine, constructed in\r\nsome such way as that which I have figured above from the _Ship of Fools_.\r\nIt is evident that books in velvet bindings and adorned with gilt bosses\r\nwould be set out where they could be seen, and for such a purpose what\r\ncould be better than a lectern? The table I have given above shews that\r\nthere were 110 volumes thus disposed, or an average of say 18 to each\r\ndesk. A careful analysis of the inventory, where the size of each book is\r\nalways set down, shews me that there were very few small books in this\r\npart of the library, but that they were divided between large (_grant_)\r\nand medium size (_moien_). If we allow 8 in. for each book, we get an\r\naverage of 144 in. = 12 ft. for each desk, that is, as the desk was\r\ndouble, the piece of furniture was 6 ft. long. Under the sloping portion\r\nit had a shelf on each side. Four such desks stood between the door and\r\nthe fireplace, and two between the fireplace and the window, which seems\r\nto have been opposite the door.\r\n\r\nWe are not told where the \"trellis of iron\" was. I suppose these words\r\nmean some shelves set against the wall with ironwork in front of them. As\r\nthe enumeration of the books begins \"near the door\" the piece of furniture\r\nmay be placed on the side of the door opposite to the former desks.\r\n\r\nThe inventory further shews that this library did duty as a museum. It was\r\nin fact filled with rare and beautiful objects, and must have presented a\r\nsingularly rich appearance. In the middle of the hood over the fireplace\r\nwas a stag's head and horns bearing a crucifix. There was a bust of the\r\nDuke of Savoy, in white marble, forming a pendant to one of the Duchess\r\nMargaret herself, and in the same material a statuette of a boy extracting\r\na thorn from his foot, probably a copy of the antique in the Ducal Gallery\r\nat Florence. There were also twenty oil paintings in the room, some of\r\nwhich were hung round the hood of the fireplace. Besides these works of\r\nart there were several pieces of furniture, as, for instance, a large\r\npress containing a complete set of armour, a sideboard \"a la mode\r\nd'Italie,\" given as a present by the viceroy of Naples; a square table of\r\ninlaid work; a smaller table bearing the arms of Burgundy and Spain; three\r\nmirrors; a number of objects in rock-crystal; and lastly some feather\r\ndresses from India (S. America?), presented by the Emperor.\r\n\r\nIt is provoking that the inventory, minute as it is, should desert us at\r\nthe most important point, and give insufficient data for estimating the\r\nsize of the room. I conjecture that it was about 46 ft. long from the\r\nfollowing considerations. In the first place, I allow 2 ft. for the width\r\nof each desk. Of these there were four between the door and the fireplace\r\n= 8 ft. Secondly, I allow 3 ft. each for the five intervals = 15 ft., or a\r\ntotal of 23 ft. from the door to the fireplace. For the fireplace itself I\r\nallow 10 ft. Between the fireplace and the wall containing the window or\r\nwindows, there were two desks and three intervals = 13 ft. I pointed out\r\nabove that 43 ft. at least might be allowed for the shelf extending from\r\nthe door to the fireplace. Of this I have absorbed 23 ft., leaving 20 ft.\r\nfor the distance from the door to the corner of the room. As we are not\r\ntold anything about the position of the door my estimate of the size of\r\nthe room cannot be carried further.\r\n\r\nA similar arrangement obtained in the library of Anne de France, daughter\r\nof Louis XI., or as she is usually called Anne de Beaujeu[531]. Her\r\ncatalogue made 19 September, 1523, records 314 titles, which I need hardly\r\nsay represent a far larger number of books. They were arranged like those\r\nof the Duchess Margaret, on eleven desks (_poulpitres_). These were set\r\nround a room, with the exception of two which were placed in the middle of\r\nit. It is interesting to note respecting one of these, that it had a\r\ncupboard at the end, for the contents are entered as follows: _au bout\r\ndudit poulpitre sont enclos les livres qui s'ensuivent_, and sixteen\r\nvolumes are enumerated. There was also a shelf set against the wall,\r\ndescribed as _le plus hault poulpitre le long de la dite muraille_, which\r\ncontained fifty-five volumes. This desk was probably high up, like the\r\none in the library of the Duchess Margaret. The books upon it are noted as\r\nbeing all covered with red velvet, and ornamented with clasps, bosses, and\r\ncorner-pieces of metal. There were also in this library an astrolabe, and\r\na sphere with the signs of the Zodiac.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 139. S. John writing his Gospel.\r\n\r\nFrom a MS. _Hours_ in the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge.]\r\n\r\nA desk, similar in general character to that figured in the _Ship of\r\nFools_, but of a curiously modern type, occurs in an Hours in the\r\nFitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, executed about 1445 for Isabel, Duchess of\r\nBrittany. The picture (fig. 139) represents S. John writing his Gospel.\r\n\r\nA modification of this form of desk was common in Italy. It is often used\r\nby painters of the fifteenth century in pictures of the Annunciation,\r\nwhere it does duty as a prie-dieu. The example I have selected (fig. 140)\r\nis from a painting by Benedetto Bonfigli, in the church of S. Peter at\r\nPerugia. It represents S. Jerome writing. A small circular revolving desk,\r\nat the left-hand corner of the larger desk, holds the work he is copying\r\nor referring to. On the desk near the inkstand lies the pointed _stylus_\r\nmentioned above. Below the cupboard containing books is a drawer.\r\nProjecting from the top of the revolving desk, there is a vertical rod of\r\niron with a long horizontal arm. This is no doubt intended to carry a\r\nlantern. I shall shortly give an example of one in such a position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 141. Circular book-desk.\r\n\r\nFrom a MS. of _Fais et Gestes du Roi Alexandre_, in the British Museum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 140. S. Jerome writing.\r\n\r\nFrom an oil painting by Benedetto Bonfigli, in the Church of S. Peter at\r\nPerugia.]\r\n\r\nI now return to the wheel-desk, of which I have already figured one\r\nspecimen (fig. 135). A piece of furniture consisting of one or more tables\r\nwhich could be raised or depressed by means of a central screw, was very\r\ngenerally used by scholars in the Middle Ages. I shall present a few of\r\nthe most common forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 142. S. Luke writing his Gospel.\r\n\r\nFrom the Dunois _Horae_, a MS. in the possession of H. Y. Thompson, Esq.]\r\n\r\nMy first specimen is from a manuscript in the British Museum, written and\r\nilluminated in England in the middle of the fifteenth century. It is\r\ncalled _Fais et Gestes du Roi Alexandre_[532]. The picture (fig. 141)\r\nrepresents Alexander as a little child, standing in front of his tutor,\r\nwho is seated in one of the chairs I described above. On the learned man's\r\nright is his book-desk. A circular table with a rim round it to prevent\r\nthe books falling off, is supported on a central pedestal, which contains\r\nthe screw. The top of the said screw is concealed by the little Gothic\r\nturret in the centre of the table. This turret also supports the book\r\nwhich the reader has in use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 143. A lady seated in her chair reading.\r\n\r\nFrom a MS. written in France, early in the fifteenth century.]\r\n\r\nMy next example is from a miniature in a volume of Hours known as the\r\nDunois _Horae_, also written in the middle of the fifteenth century. It has\r\nbeen slightly enlarged in order to bring out the details more clearly. The\r\nsubject is S. Luke writing his Gospel, but the background represents a\r\nscholar's room. There is a bookcase of a very modern type, a table with\r\ntwo folio volumes lying upon it, and in the centre a hexagonal book-desk,\r\nwith a little Gothic turret as in the last example. Round the screw under\r\nthe table are four cylindrical supports, the use of which I fail to\r\nunderstand, but they occur frequently on desks of this type. The whole\r\npiece of furniture rests on a heavy cylindrical base, and that again on a\r\nsquare platform.\r\n\r\nI now pass to a variety of the screw-desk, which has a small book-rest\r\nabove the table. The whole structure rests upon a prolongation of the\r\nsolid platform on which the reader's chair is placed, so that it is really\r\nexactly in front of the reader. My illustration (fig. 143) is from \"The\r\nbooke of the noble ladyes in frensh,\" a work by Boccacio; it was written\r\nin France early in the fifteenth century[533].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 144. Screw-desk.\r\n\r\nFrom a fifteenth century MS. in the Bibliotheque de l'Arsenal, Paris.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 145. Hexagonal desk, with central spike, probably for\r\na candle.\r\n\r\nFrom a French MS. of _Le Miroir Historial_.]\r\n\r\nThese double desks are exceedingly common, and I might fill a large number\r\nof pages with figures and descriptions of the variety which the ingenuity\r\nof the cabinet-makers of the fifteenth century managed to impart to\r\ncombinations of a screw and two or more tables. I will content myself\r\nwith one more example (fig. 144) which shews the screw exceedingly well,\r\nand the two tables above it. The uppermost of these serves as a ledge to\r\nrest the books on, as does also the hexagonal block above it which\r\nconceals the top of the screw[534].\r\n\r\nWe meet occasionally with a solid desk, by which I mean one the level of\r\nwhich cannot be altered. In the example here given (fig. 145) from a\r\nFrench MS. of _Le Miroir Historial_, there is a central spike which I\r\nsuspect to have been intended to carry a candle[535].\r\n\r\nIn some examples of these book-desks the pedestal is utilized as a\r\nbook-cupboard (fig. 146). The picture which I have selected as shewing a\r\ndesk of this peculiarity is singularly beautiful, and finished in the\r\nhighest style of art available at the end of the fifteenth century in\r\nFrance. It forms half of the frontispiece to a fine manuscript of\r\nBoccacio's _Livre des cas des malheureux nobles hommes et femmes_[536].\r\nThe central figure is apparently lecturing on that moving theme, for in\r\nfront of him, in the other half of the picture, is a crowd of men\r\nexhibiting their interest by the violence of their gestures. On his left\r\nis the desk I mentioned; it stands on an unusually firm base, and one side\r\nof the vertical portion is pierced by an arch, so as to make the central\r\ncavity available for putting books in. From the centre of the table rises\r\na tall spike, apparently of iron, to which is attached a horizontal arm,\r\nbearing a lighted lantern. On the table, in addition to three books, is an\r\ninkstand and pen-case. In front of the lecturer is a carved chest,\r\nprobably one of those book-coffers which I have already mentioned. The\r\nchair and canopy are richly carved, and the back of the seat is partially\r\ncovered by a piece of tapestry. Further, the lecturer is allowed the\r\nunusual luxury of a cushion.\r\n\r\nI will next deal with the appliances for reading and writing directly\r\nconnected with the chairs in which scholars sat, and I will begin with the\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 146. A lecturer addressing an audience.\r\n\r\nFrom a MS. of _Livre des cas des malheureux nobles hommes et femmes_,\r\nwritten in France at end of fifteenth century.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 148. The author of _The Chronicles of Hainault_ in his\r\nstudy (1446).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 150. A writer with his desk and table.\r\n\r\nFrom a MS. of _Le Livre des Proprietes des Choses_ in the British\r\nMuseum.]\r\n\r\nThe simplest form of desk is a plain board, set at a suitable angle by\r\nmeans of a chain or cord extending from one of its corners to the back of\r\nthe chair, while the opposite corner rests against a peg driven into the\r\narm of the chair. This arrangement, variously modified, occurs very\r\nfrequently; sometimes there are two pegs and two chains, but what I may\r\nterm the normal form is shewn in my illustration (fig. 147)[537]. It is\r\ndifficult to understand how the desk was kept steady.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 147. S. Mark writing his Gospel.\r\n\r\nFrom a MS. _Hours_ written in France in the fifteenth century.]\r\n\r\nThe author whose study I shall figure next (fig. 148) is engaged in\r\nwriting the Chronicles of Hainault[538]. His desk rests securely on two\r\nirons fastened to the arms of his chair. On his right is a plain lectern\r\nwith an open volume on each side of it, and behind are two or more shelves\r\nset against the wall with books lying on their sides. On his left is a\r\nchest, presumably a book-chest, with books lying on its closed lid. One of\r\nthese is open. He has prudently placed his chair near the window in such a\r\nposition that the light falls upon his work from the left. It should be\r\nnoted that the upper part of the window only is glazed, the lower part\r\nbeing closed by shutters. When these are thrown back, the lights are seen\r\nto be filled to half their height with a trellis, such as was ordered for\r\nthe French king's library.\r\n\r\nMy third example of a chair fitted with a desk (fig. 149) is taken from\r\n_Les Miracles de Notre Dame_[539], a manuscript which belonged to Philip\r\nthe Good, Duke of Burgundy, and was written for him at the Hague in 1456.\r\nThe illustration represents S. Jerome seated in his study. From arm to arm\r\nof the chair extends a desk of a very firm and solid construction. The\r\nends of this desk apparently drop into the heads of the small columns with\r\nwhich the arms of the chair terminate. The saint has in his left hand a\r\npointed _stylus_, and in his right a pen, which he is holding up to the\r\nlight. On the desk beside the manuscript lies an ink-horn. To the right of\r\nthe saint's chair is a hexagonal table with a high ledge round it. There\r\nis no evidence that this table has a screw; but the small subsidiary desk\r\nabove it seems to be provided with one. It will be observed that the\r\nsupport of this desk is not directly over that of the table beneath it.\r\nThe desk is provided with two slits--an ingenious contrivance for dealing\r\nwith a roll. On the table, besides an open book, are a pair of spectacles,\r\nfour pens, a small box which may contain French chalk for pouncing, and\r\nwhat looks like a piece of sponge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 149. S. Jerome in his study.\r\n\r\nFrom _Les Miracle de Nostre Dame_, written at the Hague in 1456.]\r\n\r\nI now figure two different sets of library appliances. The first (fig.\r\n150) is from a manuscript of the _Livre des Proprietes des Choses_, in the\r\nBritish Museum, written in the fifteenth century[540]. The writer is\r\nseated in one of those low chairs which occur very frequently in\r\nminiatures, and look as if they were cut out of a single block of wood.\r\nHis desk, which is quite independent of the chair, is of the simplest\r\ndesign, consisting of a piece of wood supported at an angle on two carved\r\nuprights. On his left stands a very elegant piece of furniture, a table\r\nwith a desk at a considerable height above it--so high, in fact, that it\r\ncould only be used standing. This upper desk is fitted with a little door\r\nas though it served as a receptacle for small objects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 151. S. Luke writing his Gospel.\r\n\r\nMSS. Douce, Bodl. Lib. Oxf., No. 381.]\r\n\r\nThe second example (fig. 151) shews S. Luke sitting on a bench writing at\r\na table[541]. The top, which is very massive, rests on four legs, morticed\r\ninto a frame. In front of this table is a desk of peculiar form; the lower\r\npart resembles a reversed cone, and the upper part a second cone of\r\nsmaller diameter, so as to leave space enough between the two bases for a\r\nledge to rest books on. Round the base of the desk three quaint lions do\r\nduty as feet. These lions occur again beneath the frame of the picture,\r\nand may be connected with a former possessor of the manuscript. The\r\npedestal of the desk is a twisted column, which, like the base, and indeed\r\nthe whole structure, looks as though it were made of brass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 152. S. Augustine at his desk.\r\n\r\nFrom a painting by Fra Filippo Lippi at Florence.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 153. S. Jerome reading.\r\n\r\nFrom an oil painting by Catena, in the National Gallery, London.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 154. A writer at work.\r\n\r\nFrom a French translation of Valerius Maximus, written and illuminated in\r\nFlanders in 1479, for King Edward IV.]\r\n\r\nI now pass to a totally different way of fitting up a study, which seems\r\nto have been common in Italy, to judge by the number of paintings in which\r\nit occurs. It consists of a massive desk of wood, one part of which is set\r\nat right angles to the other, and is connected in various ways with\r\nshelves, drawers, pigeon-holes, and other contrivances for holding books\r\nand papers. In the example I here figure (fig. 152), from a painting by\r\nFra Filippo Lippi (1412-1469) representing S. Augustine's vision of the\r\nTrinity, there are two small recesses above the desk on the saint's right,\r\nboth containing books, and behind the shorter portion of the desk, three\r\nshelves also with books on them. Attached to the end of the desk is a\r\nsmall tray, probably to contain pens.\r\n\r\nA similar desk occurs in the beautiful picture by Catena in the National\r\nGallery[542], representing S. Jerome reading, of which I give a\r\nreproduction on a reduced scale (fig. 153). This picture also contains an\r\nexcellent example of a cupboard in the thickness of the wall, a\r\ncontrivance for taking care of books as common in the Middle Ages as it\r\nhad been in Roman times[543].\r\n\r\nCupboards in the thickness of the wall are also to be seen in the\r\nfrontispiece (fig. 154) to a copy of a French translation of Valerius\r\nMaximus[544], written in Flanders in 1479 for King Edward IV. The\r\nwriter--probably intended for the author or the translator of the book--is\r\nseated at a desk, consisting of a plank set at an angle and capable of\r\nbeing turned aside by means of a central bracket, like that used by the\r\nCarmelite (fig. 136). Observe the two weights hanging over the edge of the\r\ndesk and the ends of the two horns, intended to hold ink, projecting\r\nthrough it. The window, as in the picture representing the author of the\r\nChronicles of Hainault at work, is glazed in the upper part only, while in\r\nthe lower are two framed trellises of wire-work. Behind the writer are two\r\ncupboards in the thickness of the wall. One of these is open, and shews\r\nbooks lying on their sides, upon which are some pomegranates. I cannot\r\nsuggest any reason for the introduction of these fruits, except that from\r\ntheir colour they make a pleasing variety; but I ought to mention that\r\nthey occur very frequently in miniatures representing a writer at work. On\r\nthe other side of the window is a small hanging cupboard. Here again a\r\nfruit is introduced on the lowest shelf. Round the room is a settle,\r\nraised above the floor on blocks at intervals. The seat is probably a\r\nchest, as in the settles described above in the Vatican Library.\r\n\r\nThe last picture (fig. 155) in this series of illustrations represents\r\nwhat I like to call a scholar's room, at the beginning of the fifteenth\r\ncentury[545]. The owner of the apartment is busily writing at a desk\r\nsupported on a trestle-table. He holds a _stylus_ in his left hand, and a\r\npen in his right. The ink-horn he is using is inserted into the desk.\r\nAbove it are holes for two others, in case he should require ink of\r\ndifferent colours. Above the inkstand is a pen stuck in a hole, with\r\nvacant holes beside it. The page on the desk is kept flat by a weight.\r\nAbove this desk is a second desk, of nearly equal size, on which lies an\r\nopen book, kept open by a large weight, extending over two-thirds of the\r\nopen pages. Behind the writer's chair is his book-chest. The background\r\nrepresents a well-appointed chamber. The floor is paved with encaustic\r\ntiles; a bright fire is burning on the hearth; the window, on the same\r\nplan as that described in the last picture, is open; a comfortable--not to\r\nsay luxurious--bed invites repose. The walls are unplastered, but there is\r\na hanging under the window and over the head of the bed.\r\n\r\nWith this simple room, containing a scholar's necessaries and no more, I\r\nwill contrast the study of the Duke of Urbino.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful room, which still exists as the Duke left it, is on an\r\nupper floor of the castle, commanding from its balcony, which faces the\r\nsouth, an extensive view of the approach to the Castle, the city, and the\r\ncountry beyond, backed by the Apennines. It is of small size, measuring\r\nonly 11 ft. 6 in. by 13 ft. 4 in., and is somewhat irregular in shape. It\r\nis entered by a door from the Duke's private apartment. The floor is paved\r\nwith rough tiles set in patterns. The walls are panelled to a height of\r\nabout eight feet. The bare space between the top of the panel-work and the\r\nceiling was probably hung with tapestry. The ceiling is a beautiful\r\nspecimen of the most elaborate plaster-work, disposed in octagonal panels.\r\nThe decoration of the panel-work begins with a representation of a bench,\r\non which various objects are lying executed in intarsia work. Above this\r\nbench is a row of small panels, above which again is a row of large\r\npanels, each containing a subject in the finest intarsia, as for example a\r\nportrait of Duke Frederick, figures of Faith, Hope, and other virtues, a\r\npile of books, musical instruments, armour, a parrot in a cage, etc. In\r\nthe cornice above these is the word FEDERICO, and the date 1476.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 155. A scholar's room in the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nFrom a MS. in the Royal Library at Brussels.]\r\n\r\nOpposite the window there is a small cupboard, and on the opposite side of\r\nthe projection containing it there are a few shelves. These are the only\r\nreceptacles for books in the room. From its small size it could have\r\ncontained but little furniture, and was probably intended for the purpose\r\ntraditionally ascribed to it, namely as a place of retirement for the Duke\r\nwhen he wished to be alone.\r\n\r\nAnother specimen of a library so arranged as to provide a peaceful retreat\r\nis afforded a century later by that of Montaigne, of which he has\r\nfortunately left a minute description.\r\n\r\n    [My library is] in the third story of a Tower, of which\r\n    the Ground-room is my Chappel, the second story an\r\n    Apartment with a withdrawing Room and Closet, where I\r\n    often lie to be more retired. Above it is a great\r\n    Wardrobe, which formerly was the most useless part of\r\n    the House. I there pass away both the most of the Days\r\n    of my Life, and most of the Hours of those Days. In the\r\n    Night I am never there. There is within it a Cabinet\r\n    handsome and neat enough, with a Fire-place very\r\n    commodiously contriv'd, and Light very finely fitted.\r\n    And was I not more afraid of the Trouble than the\r\n    Expence, the Trouble that frights me from all Business,\r\n    I could very easily adjoyn on either side, and on the\r\n    same Floor, a Gallery of an hundred paces long, and\r\n    twelve broad, having found Walls already rais'd for some\r\n    other Design, to the requisite height. Every place of\r\n    retirement requires a Walk. My Thoughts sleep if I sit\r\n    still; my Fancy does not go by itself, as when my Legs\r\n    move it: and all those who study without a Book are in\r\n    the same Condition.\r\n\r\n    The figure of my Study is round, and has no more flat\r\n    Wall than what is taken up by my Table, and my Chairs;\r\n    so that the remaining parts of the Circle present me a\r\n    view of all my books at once, set up upon five degrees\r\n    of Shelves round about me. It has three noble and free\r\n    Prospects, and is sixteen paces[546] Diameter. I am not\r\n    so continually there in Winter; for my House is built\r\n    upon an Eminence, as its Name imports, and no part of it\r\n    is so much expos'd to the Wind and Weather as that,\r\n    which pleases me the better, for being of a painful\r\n    access, and a little remote, as well upon the account of\r\n    Exercise, as being also there more retir'd from the\r\n    Crowd. 'Tis there that I am in my Kingdom, as we say,\r\n    and there I endeavour to make myself an absolute\r\n    Monarch, and so sequester this one Corner from all\r\n    Society both Conjugal, Filial, and Civil[547].\r\n\r\nThe notices of libraries which I have collected have brought me to the end\r\nof the sixteenth century, by which time most of the appliances in use in\r\nthe Middle Ages had been given up. I hope that I have not exhausted the\r\npatience of my readers by presenting too long a series of illustrations\r\nextracted from manuscripts. I love, as I look at them, to picture to\r\nmyself the medieval man of letters, laboriously penning voluminous\r\ntreatises in the writing room of a monastery, or in his own study, with\r\nhis scanty collection of books within his reach, on shelves, or in a\r\nchest, or lying on a table. We sometimes call the ages dark in which he\r\nlived, but the mechanical ingenuity displayed in the devices by which his\r\nstudies were assisted might put to shame the cabinet-makers of our own\r\nday.\r\n\r\nAs the fashion of collecting books, and of having them bound at a lavish\r\nexpense, increased, it was obvious that they must be laid out so as to be\r\nseen and consulted without the danger of spoiling their costly covers.\r\nHence the development of the lectern-system in private houses, and the\r\narrangement of a room such as the Duchess Margaret possessed at Malines.\r\nGradually, however, as books multiplied, and came into the possession of\r\npersons who could not afford costly bindings, lecterns were abandoned, and\r\nbooks were ranged on shelves against the wall, as in the public libraries\r\nwhich I described in the last chapter.\r\n\r\nThere is still in existence, on an upper floor in the Palazzo Barberini at\r\nRome, a library of this description, which has probably not been altered\r\nin any way since it was fitted up by Cardinal Francesco Barberini about\r\n1630. The room is 105 ft. long by 28 ft. broad, and is admirably lighted\r\nby two windows in the south wall, and seven in the gallery. The shelves\r\nare set round three sides of the room at a short distance from the wall,\r\nso as to leave space for a gallery and the stairs to it. The cases are\r\ndivided into compartments by fluted Ionic columns 5 ft. high. These rest\r\nupon a flat shelf 14 in. wide, beneath which are drawers for papers and a\r\nrow of folios. This part of the structure is 3 ft. high from the floor to\r\nthe base of the columns. Above the columns is a cornice, part of which is\r\nutilized for books; and above this again is the gallery, where the\r\narrangement of the shelves is a repetition of what I have described in the\r\nlower part of the room. Dwarf cases in a plainer style and of later date\r\nare set along the sides and ends of the room. Upon these are desks for the\r\ncatalogue, a pair of globes, some astronomical instruments, and some\r\nsepulchral urns found at Praeneste. The older woodwork in this library has\r\nnever been painted or varnished, and the whole aspect of the room is\r\nsingularly old-world and delightful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 156 Dean Boys in his Library, 1622.]\r\n\r\nAnother instance is afforded by the sketch of the library of John Boys,\r\nDean of Canterbury, who died in 1625. It occurs on the title-page of his\r\nworks dated 1622, and I may add on his tomb in Canterbury Cathedral also.\r\nHe clung to ancient fashions so far as to set his books with their\r\nfore-edge outwards, but in other respects his book-shelves are of a modern\r\ntype.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have now reached the limit which I imposed upon myself when I began this\r\nessay. But before I conclude let me say a few last words. I wish to point\r\nout that collectors and builders in the Middle Ages did not guard their\r\nmanuscripts with jealous care merely because they had paid a high price to\r\nhave them written; they recognised what I may call the personal element in\r\nthem; they invested them with the senses and the feelings of human\r\nbeings; and bestowed them like guests whom they delighted to honour. No\r\none who reads the _Philobiblon_ can fail to see that every page of it is\r\npervaded by this sentiment; and this I think explains the elaborate\r\nprecautions against theft; the equally elaborate care taken to arrange a\r\nlibrary in so orderly a fashion that each book might be accessible with\r\nthe least difficulty and the least delay; and the exuberant gratitude with\r\nwhich the arrival of a new book was welcomed.\r\n\r\nIn my present work I have looked at libraries from the technical side\r\nexclusively. It would have been useless to try to combine fire and water,\r\nsentiment and fact. But let me remind my readers that we are not so far\r\nremoved from the medieval standpoint as some of us perhaps would wish.\r\nWhen we enter the library of Queens' College, or the older part of the\r\nUniversity Library, at Cambridge, where there has been continuity from the\r\nfifteenth century to the present day, are we not moved by feelings such as\r\nI have tried to indicate, such in fact as moved John Leland when he saw\r\nthe library at Glastonbury for the first time?\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is another sentiment closely allied to this by which\r\nmembers of a College or a University are more deeply moved than others--I\r\nmean the sentiment of association. The most prosaic among them cannot fail\r\nto remember that the very floors were trodden by the feet of the great\r\nscholars of the past; that Erasmus may have sat at that window on that\r\nbench, and read the very book which we are ourselves about to borrow.\r\n\r\nBut in these collections the present is not forgotten; the authors of\r\nto-day are taking their places beside the authors of the past, and are\r\nbeing treated with the same care. On all sides we see progress: the\r\nlecterns and the stalls are still in use and keep green the memory of old\r\nfashions; while near them the plain shelving of the twentieth century\r\nbears witness to the ever-present need for more space to hold the invading\r\nhordes of books that represent the literature of to-day. On the one hand,\r\nwe see the past; on the other, the present; and both are animated by full,\r\nvigorous life.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[521] MSS. Mus. Brit., MSS.
