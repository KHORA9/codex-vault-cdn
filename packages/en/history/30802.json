His original plan took it's rise in the year 1753: and,\r\nnotwithstanding the novelty of such an attempt in this age and\r\ncountry, and the prejudices usually conceived against any innovations\r\nin the established mode of education, he had the satisfaction to find\r\n(and he acknowleges it with a mixture of pride and gratitude) that his\r\nendeavours were encouraged and patronized by those, both in the\r\nuniversity and out of it, whose good opinion and esteem he was\r\nprincipally desirous to obtain._\r\n\r\n_THE death of Mr VINER in 1756, and his ample benefaction to the\r\nuniversity for promoting the study of the law, produced about two\r\nyears afterwards a regular and public establishment of what the author\r\nhad privately undertaken. The knowlege of our laws and constitution\r\nwas adopted as a liberal science by general academical authority;\r\ncompetent endowments were decreed for the support of a lecturer, and\r\nthe perpetual encouragement of students; and the compiler of the\r\nensuing commentaries had the honour to be elected the first Vinerian\r\nprofessor._\r\n\r\n_IN this situation he was led, both by duty and inclination, to\r\ninvestigate the elements of the law, and the grounds of our civil\r\npolity, with greater assiduity and attention than many have thought it\r\nnecessary to do. And yet all, who of late years have attended the\r\npublic administration of justice, must be sensible that a masterly\r\nacquaintance with the general spirit of laws and the principles of\r\nuniversal jurisprudence, combined with an accurate knowlege of our own\r\nmunicipal constitutions, their original, reason, and history, hath\r\ngiven a beauty and energy to many modern judicial decisions, with\r\nwhich our ancestors were wholly unacquainted. If, in the pursuit of\r\nthese inquiries, the author hath been able to rectify any errors which\r\neither himself or others may have heretofore imbibed, his pains will\r\nbe sufficiently answered: and, if in some points he is still mistaken,\r\nthe candid and judicious reader will make due allowances for the\r\ndifficulties of a search so new, so extensive, and so laborious._\r\n\r\n_THE labour indeed of these researches, and of a regular attention to\r\nhis duty, for a series of so many years, he hath found inconsistent\r\nwith his health, as well as his other avocations: and hath therefore\r\ndesired the university's permission to retire from his office, after\r\nthe conclusion of the annual course in which he is at present engaged.\r\nBut the hints, which he had collected for the use of his pupils,\r\nhaving been thought by some of his more experienced friends not wholly\r\nunworthy of the public eye, it is therefore with the less reluctance\r\nthat he now commits them to the press: though probably the little\r\ndegree of reputation, which their author may have acquired by the\r\ncandor of an audience (a test widely different from that of a\r\ndeliberate perusal) would have been better consulted by a total\r\nsuppression of his lectures;----had that been a matter intirely within\r\nhis power._\r\n\r\n_FOR the truth is, that the present publication is as much the effect\r\nof necessity, as it is of choice. The notes which were taken by his\r\nhearers, have by some of them (too partial in his favour) been thought\r\nworth revising and transcribing; and these transcripts have been\r\nfrequently lent to others. Hence copies have been multiplied, in their\r\nnature imperfect, if not erroneous; some of which have fallen into\r\nmercenary hands, and become the object of clandestine sale. Having\r\ntherefore so much reason to apprehend a surreptitious impression, he\r\nchose rather to submit his own errors to the world, than to seem\r\nanswerable for those of other men. And, with this apology, he commits\r\nhimself to the indulgence of the public._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERRATA.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Page 138, line 15_: _for_ no _read_ an\r\n\r\n_Page 147, (notes) col. 2._ _after_ 1 Sid. 1. _add_ See Stat. 13 Car.\r\nII. c. 7.\r\n\r\n_Page 224, line 14_: _after_ sit _add_ at\r\n\r\n_Page 376, line 6_: _for_ predial _read_ rectorial\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nSECT.

He must be\r\nsensible how much will depend upon his conduct in the infancy of a\r\nstudy, which is now first adopted by public academical authority;\r\nwhich has generally been reputed (however unjustly) of a dry and\r\nunfruitful nature; and of which the theoretical, elementary parts have\r\nhitherto received a very moderate share of cultivation. He cannot but\r\nreflect that, if either his plan of instruction be crude and\r\ninjudicious, or the execution of it lame and superficial, it will cast\r\na damp upon the farther progress of this most useful and most rational\r\nbranch of learning; and may defeat for a time the public-spirited\r\ndesign of our wise and munificent benefactor. And this he must more\r\nespecially dread, when he feels by experience how unequal his\r\nabilities are (unassisted by preceding examples) to complete, in the\r\nmanner he could wish, so extensive and arduous a task; since he freely\r\nconfesses, that his former more private attempts have fallen very\r\nshort of his own ideas of perfection. And yet the candour he has\r\nalready experienced, and this last transcendent mark of regard, his\r\npresent nomination by the free and unanimous suffrage of a great and\r\nlearned university, (an honour to be ever remembered with the deepest\r\nand most affectionate gratitude) these testimonies of your public\r\njudgment must entirely supersede his own, and forbid him to believe\r\nhimself totally insufficient for the labour at least of this\r\nemployment. One thing he will venture to hope for, and it certainly\r\nshall be his constant aim, by diligence and attention to atone for his\r\nother defects; esteeming, that the best return, which he can possibly\r\nmake for your favourable opinion of his capacity, will be his\r\nunwearied endeavours in some little degree to deserve it.\r\n\r\nTHE science thus committed to his charge, to be cultivated,\r\nmethodized, and explained in a course of academical lectures, is that\r\nof the laws and constitution of our own country: a species of\r\nknowlege, in which the gentlemen of England have been more remarkably\r\ndeficient than those of all Europe besides. In most of the nations on\r\nthe continent, where the civil or imperial law under different\r\nmodifications is closely interwoven with the municipal laws of the\r\nland, no gentleman, or at least no scholar, thinks his education is\r\ncompleted, till he has attended a course or two of lectures, both upon\r\nthe institutes of Justinian and the local constitutions of his native\r\nsoil, under the very eminent professors that abound in their several\r\nuniversities. And in the northern parts of our own island, where also\r\nthe municipal laws are frequently connected with the civil, it is\r\ndifficult to meet with a person of liberal education, who is destitute\r\nof a competent knowlege in that science, which is to be the guardian\r\nof his natural rights and the rule of his civil conduct.\r\n\r\nNOR have the imperial laws been totally neglected even in the English\r\nnation. A general acquaintance with their decisions has ever been\r\ndeservedly considered as no small accomplishment of a gentleman; and a\r\nfashion has prevailed, especially of late, to transport the growing\r\nhopes of this island to foreign universities, in Switzerland, Germany,\r\nand Holland; which, though infinitely inferior to our own in every\r\nother consideration, have been looked upon as better nurseries of the\r\ncivil, or (which is nearly the same) of their own municipal law. In\r\nthe mean time it has been the peculiar lot of our admirable system of\r\nlaws, to be neglected, and even unknown, by all but one practical\r\nprofession; though built upon the soundest foundations, and approved\r\nby the experience of ages.\r\n\r\nFAR be it from me to derogate from the study of the civil law,\r\nconsidered (apart from any binding authority) as a collection of\r\nwritten reason. No man is more thoroughly persuaded of the general\r\nexcellence of it's rules, and the usual equity of it's decisions; nor\r\nis better convinced of it's use as well as ornament to the scholar,\r\nthe divine, the statesman, and even the common lawyer. But we must not\r\ncarry our veneration so far as to sacrifice our Alfred and Edward to\r\nthe manes of Theodosius and Justinian: we must not prefer the edict of\r\nthe praetor, or the rescript of the Roman emperor, to our own\r\nimmemorial customs, or the sanctions of an English parliament; unless\r\nwe can also prefer the despotic monarchy of Rome and Byzantium, for\r\nwhose meridians the former were calculated, to the free constitution\r\nof Britain, which the latter are adapted to perpetuate.\r\n\r\nWITHOUT detracting therefore from the real merit which abounds in the\r\nimperial law, I hope I may have leave to assert, that if an Englishman\r\nmust be ignorant of either the one or the other, he had better be a\r\nstranger to the Roman than the English institutions. For I think it an\r\nundeniable position, that a competent knowlege of the laws of that\r\nsociety, in which we live, is the proper accomplishment of every\r\ngentleman and scholar; an highly useful, I had almost said essential,\r\npart of liberal and polite education. And in this I am warranted by\r\nthe example of antient Rome; where, as Cicero informs us[a], the very\r\nboys were obliged to learn the twelve tables by heart, as a _carmen\r\nnecessarium_ or indispensable lesson, to imprint on their tender minds\r\nan early knowlege of the laws and constitutions of their country.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: _De Legg._ 2. 23.]\r\n\r\nBUT as the long and universal neglect of this study, with us in\r\nEngland, seems in some degree to call in question the truth of this\r\nevident position, it shall therefore be the business of this\r\nintroductory discourse, in the first place to demonstrate the utility\r\nof some general acquaintance with the municipal law of the land, by\r\npointing out its particular uses in all considerable situations of\r\nlife. Some conjectures will then be offered with regard to the causes\r\nof neglecting this useful study: to which will be subjoined a few\r\nreflexions on the peculiar propriety of reviving it in our own\r\nuniversities.\r\n\r\nAND, first, to demonstrate the utility of some acquaintance with the\r\nlaws of the land, let us only reflect a moment on the singular frame\r\nand polity of that land, which is governed by this system of laws. A\r\nland, perhaps the only one in the universe, in which political or\r\ncivil liberty is the very end and scope of the constitution[b]. This\r\nliberty, rightly understood, consists in the power of doing whatever\r\nthe laws permit[c]; which is only to be effected by a general\r\nconformity of all orders and degrees to those equitable rules of\r\naction, by which the meanest individual is protected from the insults\r\nand oppression of the greatest. As therefore every subject is\r\ninterested in the preservation of the laws, it is incumbent upon every\r\nman to be acquainted with those at least, with which he is immediately\r\nconcerned; lest he incur the censure, as well as inconvenience, of\r\nliving in society without knowing the obligations which it lays him\r\nunder. And thus much may suffice for persons of inferior condition,\r\nwho have neither time nor capacity to enlarge their views beyond that\r\ncontracted sphere in which they are appointed to move. But those, on\r\nwhom nature and fortune have bestowed more abilities and greater\r\nleisure, cannot be so easily excused. These advantages are given them,\r\nnot for the benefit of themselves only, but also of the public: and\r\nyet they cannot, in any scene of life, discharge properly their duty\r\neither to the public or themselves, without some degree of knowlege in\r\nthe laws. To evince this the more clearly, it may not be amiss to\r\ndescend to a few particulars.\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Montesq. _Esp. L._ _l._ 11. _c._ 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: _Facultas ejus, quod cuique facere libet, nisi quid vi,\r\naut jure prohibetur._ _Inst._ 1. 3. 1.]\r\n\r\nLET us therefore begin with our gentlemen of independent estates and\r\nfortune, the most useful as well as considerable body of men in the\r\nnation; whom even to suppose ignorant in this branch of learning is\r\ntreated by Mr Locke[d] as a strange absurdity. It is their landed\r\nproperty, with it's long and voluminous train of descents and\r\nconveyances, settlements, entails, and incumbrances, that forms the\r\nmost intricate and most extensive object of legal knowlege. The\r\nthorough comprehension of these, in all their minute distinctions, is\r\nperhaps too laborious a task for any but a lawyer by profession: yet\r\nstill the understanding of a few leading principles, relating to\r\nestates and conveyancing, may form some check and guard upon a\r\ngentleman's inferior agents, and preserve him at least from very gross\r\nand notorious imposition.\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: Education. §. 187.]\r\n\r\nAGAIN, the policy of all laws has made some forms necessary in the\r\nwording of last wills and testaments, and more with regard to their\r\nattestation. An ignorance in these must always be of dangerous\r\nconsequence, to such as by choice or necessity compile their own\r\ntestaments without any technical assistance. Those who have attended\r\nthe courts of justice are the best witnesses of the confusion and\r\ndistresses that are hereby occasioned in families; and of the\r\ndifficulties that arise in discerning the true meaning of the\r\ntestator, or sometimes in discovering any meaning at all: so that in\r\nthe end his estate may often be vested quite contrary to these his\r\nenigmatical intentions, because perhaps he has omitted one or two\r\nformal words, which are necessary to ascertain the sense with\r\nindisputable legal precision, or has executed his will in the presence\r\nof fewer witnesses than the law requires.\r\n\r\nBUT to proceed from private concerns to those of a more public\r\nconsideration. All gentlemen of fortune are, in consequence of their\r\nproperty, liable to be called upon to establish the rights, to\r\nestimate the injuries, to weigh the accusations, and sometimes to\r\ndispose of the lives of their fellow-subjects, by serving upon juries.\r\nIn this situation they are frequently to decide, and that upon their\r\noaths, questions of nice importance, in the solution of which some\r\nlegal skill is requisite; especially where the law and the fact, as it\r\noften happens, are intimately blended together. And the general\r\nincapacity, even of our best juries, to do this with any tolerable\r\npropriety has greatly debased their authority; and has unavoidably\r\nthrown more power into the hands of the judges, to direct, control,\r\nand even reverse their verdicts, than perhaps the constitution\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nBUT it is not as a juror only that the English gentleman is called\r\nupon to determine questions of right, and distribute justice to his\r\nfellow-subjects: it is principally with this order of men that the\r\ncommission of the peace is filled. And here a very ample field is\r\nopened for a gentleman to exert his talents, by maintaining good order\r\nin his neighbourhood; by punishing the dissolute and idle; by\r\nprotecting the peaceable and industrious; and, above all, by healing\r\npetty differences and preventing vexatious prosecutions. But, in order\r\nto attain these desirable ends, it is necessary that the magistrate\r\nshould understand his business; and have not only the will, but the\r\npower also, (under which must be included the knowlege) of\r\nadministring legal and effectual justice. Else, when he has mistaken\r\nhis authority, through passion, through ignorance, or absurdity, he\r\nwill be the object of contempt from his inferiors, and of censure\r\nfrom those to whom he is accountable for his conduct.\r\n\r\nYET farther; most gentlemen of considerable property, at some period\r\nor other in their lives, are ambitious of representing their country\r\nin parliament: and those, who are ambitious of receiving so high a\r\ntrust, would also do well to remember it's nature and importance. They\r\nare not thus honourably distinguished from the rest of their\r\nfellow-subjects, merely that they may privilege their persons, their\r\nestates, or their domestics; that they may list under party banners;\r\nmay grant or with-hold supplies; may vote with or vote against a\r\npopular or unpopular administration; but upon considerations far more\r\ninteresting and important. They are the guardians of the English\r\nconstitution; the makers, repealers, and interpreters of the English\r\nlaws; delegated to watch, to check, and to avert every dangerous\r\ninnovation, to propose, to adopt, and to cherish any solid and\r\nwell-weighed improvement; bound by every tie of nature, of honour, and\r\nof religion, to transmit that constitution and those laws to their\r\nposterity, amended if possible, at least without any derogation. And\r\nhow unbecoming must it appear in a member of the legislature to vote\r\nfor a new law, who is utterly ignorant of the old! what kind of\r\ninterpretation can he be enabled to give, who is a stranger to the\r\ntext upon which he comments!\r\n\r\nINDEED it is really amazing, that there should be no other state of\r\nlife, no other occupation, art, or science, in which some method of\r\ninstruction is not looked upon as requisite, except only the science\r\nof legislation, the noblest and most difficult of any. Apprenticeships\r\nare held necessary to almost every art, commercial or mechanical: a\r\nlong course of reading and study must form the divine, the physician,\r\nand the practical professor of the laws: but every man of superior\r\nfortune thinks himself _born_ a legislator. Yet Tully was of a\r\ndifferent opinion: \"It is necessary, says he[e], for a senator to be\r\nthoroughly acquainted with the constitution; and this, he declares, is\r\na knowlege of the most extensive nature; a matter of science, of\r\ndiligence, of reflexion; without which no senator can possibly be fit\r\nfor his office.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: _De Legg._ 3. 18. _Est senatori necessarium nosse\r\nrempublicam; idque late patet:--genus hoc omne scientiae, diligentiae,\r\nmemoriae est; sine quo paratus esse senator nullo pacto potest._]\r\n\r\nTHE mischiefs that have arisen to the public from inconsiderate\r\nalterations in our laws, are too obvious to be called in question; and\r\nhow far they have been owing to the defective education of our\r\nsenators, is a point well worthy the public attention. The common law\r\nof England has fared like other venerable edifices of antiquity, which\r\nrash and unexperienced workmen have ventured to new-dress and refine,\r\nwith all the rage of modern improvement. Hence frequently it's\r\nsymmetry has been destroyed, it's proportions distorted, and it's\r\nmajestic simplicity exchanged for specious embellishments and\r\nfantastic novelties. For, to say the truth, almost all the perplexed\r\nquestions, almost all the niceties, intricacies, and delays (which\r\nhave sometimes disgraced the English, as well as other, courts of\r\njustice) owe their original not to the common law itself, but to\r\ninnovations that have been made in it by acts of parliament;\r\n\"overladen (as sir Edward Coke expresses it[f]) with provisoes and\r\nadditions, and many times on a sudden penned or corrected by men of\r\nnone or very little judgment in law.\" This great and well-experienced\r\njudge declares, that in all his time he never knew two questions made\r\nupon rights merely depending upon the common law; and warmly laments\r\nthe confusion introduced by ill-judging and unlearned legislators.\r\n\"But if, he subjoins, acts of parliament were after the old fashion\r\npenned, by such only as perfectly knew what the common law was before\r\nthe making of any act of parliament concerning that matter, as also\r\nhow far forth former statutes had provided remedy for former\r\nmischiefs, and defects discovered by experience; then should very few\r\nquestions in law arise, and the learned should not so often and so\r\nmuch perplex their heads to make atonement and peace, by construction\r\nof law, between insensible and disagreeing words, sentences, and\r\nprovisoes, as they now do.\" And if this inconvenience was so heavily\r\nfelt in the reign of queen Elizabeth, you may judge how the evil is\r\nincreased in later times, when the statute book is swelled to ten\r\ntimes a larger bulk; unless it should be found, that the penners of\r\nour modern statutes have proportionably better informed themselves in\r\nthe knowlege of the common law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: 2 Rep. Pref.]\r\n\r\nWHAT is said of our gentlemen in general, and the propriety of their\r\napplication to the study of the laws of their country, will hold\r\nequally strong or still stronger with regard to the nobility of this\r\nrealm, except only in the article of serving upon juries. But, instead\r\nof this, they have several peculiar provinces of far greater\r\nconsequence and concern; being not only by birth hereditary\r\ncounsellors of the crown, and judges upon their honour of the lives of\r\ntheir brother-peers, but also arbiters of the property of all their\r\nfellow-subjects, and that in the last resort. In this their judicial\r\ncapacity they are bound to decide the nicest and most critical points\r\nof the law; to examine and correct such errors as have escaped the\r\nmost experienced sages of the profession, the lord keeper and the\r\njudges of the courts at Westminster. Their sentence is final,\r\ndecisive, irrevocable: no appeal, no correction, not even a review can\r\nbe had: and to their determination, whatever it be, the inferior\r\ncourts of justice must conform; otherwise the rule of property would\r\nno longer be uniform and steady.\r\n\r\nSHOULD a judge in the most subordinate jurisdiction be deficient in\r\nthe knowlege of the law, it would reflect infinite contempt upon\r\nhimself and disgrace upon those who employ him. And yet the\r\nconsequence of his ignorance is comparatively very trifling and small:\r\nhis judgment may be examined, and his errors rectified, by other\r\ncourts. But how much more serious and affecting is the case of a\r\nsuperior judge, if without any skill in the laws he will boldly\r\nventure to decide a question, upon which the welfare and subsistence\r\nof whole families may depend! where the chance of his judging right,\r\nor wrong, is barely equal; and where, if he chances to judge wrong, he\r\ndoes an injury of the most alarming nature, an injury without\r\npossibility of redress!\r\n\r\nYET, vast as this trust is, it can no where be so properly reposed as\r\nin the noble hands where our excellent constitution has placed it: and\r\ntherefore placed it, because, from the independence of their fortune\r\nand the dignity of their station, they are presumed to employ that\r\nleisure which is the consequence of both, in attaining a more\r\nextensive knowlege of the laws than persons of inferior rank: and\r\nbecause the founders of our polity relied upon that delicacy of\r\nsentiment, so peculiar to noble birth; which, as on the one hand it\r\nwill prevent either interest or affection from interfering in\r\nquestions of right, so on the other it will bind a peer in honour, an\r\nobligation which the law esteems equal to another's oath, to be master\r\nof those points upon which it is his birthright to decide.\r\n\r\nTHE Roman pandects will furnish us with a piece of history not\r\nunapplicable to our present purpose. Servius Sulpicius, a gentleman of\r\nthe patrician order, and a celebrated orator, had occasion to take the\r\nopinion of Quintus Mutius Scaevola, the oracle of the Roman law; but\r\nfor want of some knowlege in that science, could not so much as\r\nunderstand even the technical terms, which his friend was obliged to\r\nmake use of. Upon which Mutius Scaevola could not forbear to upbraid\r\nhim with this memorable reproof[g], \"that it was a shame for a\r\npatrician, a nobleman, and an orator of causes, to be ignorant of that\r\nlaw in which he was so peculiarly concerned.\" This reproach made so\r\ndeep an impression on Sulpicius, that he immediately applied himself\r\nto the study of the law; wherein he arrived to that proficiency, that\r\nhe left behind him about a hundred and fourscore volumes of his own\r\ncompiling upon the subject; and became, in the opinion of Cicero[h], a\r\nmuch more complete lawyer than even Mutius Scaevola himself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: _Ff._ 1. 2. 2. §. 43. _Turpe esse patricio, & nobili, &\r\ncausas oranti, jus in quo versaretur ignorare._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: _Brut._ 41.]\r\n\r\nI WOULD not be thought to recommend to our English nobility and gentry\r\nto become as great lawyers as Sulpicius; though he, together with this\r\ncharacter, sustained likewise that of an excellent orator, a firm\r\npatriot, and a wise indefatigable senator; but the inference which\r\narises from the story is this, that ignorance of the laws of the land\r\nhath ever been esteemed dishonourable, in those who are entrusted by\r\ntheir country to maintain, to administer, and to amend them.\r\n\r\nBUT surely there is little occasion to enforce this argument any\r\nfarther to persons of rank and distinction, if we of this place may be\r\nallowed to form a general judgment from those who are under our\r\ninspection: happy, that while we lay down the rule, we can also\r\nproduce the example. You will therefore permit your professor to\r\nindulge both a public and private satisfaction, by bearing this open\r\ntestimony; that in the infancy of these studies among us, they were\r\nfavoured with the most diligent attendance, and pursued with the most\r\nunwearied application, by those of the noblest birth and most ample\r\npatrimony: some of whom are still the ornaments of this seat of\r\nlearning; and others at a greater distance continue doing honour to\r\nit's institutions, by comparing our polity and laws with those of\r\nother kingdoms abroad, or exerting their senatorial abilities in the\r\ncouncils of the nation at home.\r\n\r\nNOR will some degree of legal knowlege be found in the least\r\nsuperfluous to persons of inferior rank; especially those of the\r\nlearned professions. The clergy in particular, besides the common\r\nobligations they are under in proportion to their rank and fortune,\r\nhave also abundant reason, considered merely as clergymen, to be\r\nacquainted with many branches of the law, which are almost peculiar\r\nand appropriated to themselves alone. Such are the laws relating to\r\nadvowsons, institutions, and inductions; to simony, and simoniacal\r\ncontracts; to uniformity, residence, and pluralities; to tithes and\r\nother ecclesiastical dues; to marriages (more especially of late) and\r\nto a variety of other subjects, which are consigned to the care of\r\ntheir order by the provisions of particular statutes. To understand\r\nthese aright, to discern what is warranted or enjoined, and what is\r\nforbidden by law, demands a sort of legal apprehension; which is no\r\notherwise to be acquired than by use and a familiar acquaintance with\r\nlegal writers.\r\n\r\nFOR the gentlemen of the faculty of physic, I must frankly own that I\r\nsee no special reason, why they in particular should apply themselves\r\nto the study of the law; unless in common with other gentlemen, and to\r\ncomplete the character of general and extensive knowlege; a character\r\nwhich their profession, beyond others, has remarkably deserved. They\r\nwill give me leave however to suggest, and that not ludicrously, that\r\nit might frequently be of use to families upon sudden emergencies, if\r\nthe physician were acquainted with the doctrine of last wills and\r\ntestaments, at least so far as relates to the formal part of their\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\nBUT those gentlemen who intend to profess the civil and ecclesiastical\r\nlaws in the spiritual and maritime courts of this kingdom, are of all\r\nmen (next to common lawyers) the most indispensably obliged to apply\r\nthemselves seriously to the study of our municipal laws. For the civil\r\nand canon laws, considered with respect to any intrinsic obligation,\r\nhave no force or authority in this kingdom; they are no more binding\r\nin England than our laws are binding at Rome. But as far as these\r\nforeign laws, on account of some peculiar propriety, have in some\r\nparticular cases, and in some particular courts, been introduced and\r\nallowed by our laws, so far they oblige, and no farther; their\r\nauthority being wholly founded upon that permission and adoption. In\r\nwhich we are not singular in our notions; for even in Holland, where\r\nthe imperial law is much cultivated and it's decisions pretty\r\ngenerally followed, we are informed by Van Leeuwen[i], that, \"it\r\nreceives it's force from custom and the consent of the people, either\r\ntacitly or expressly given: for otherwise, he adds, we should no more\r\nbe bound by this law, than by that of the Almains, the Franks, the\r\nSaxons, the Goths, the Vandals, and other of the antient nations.\"\r\nWherefore, in all points in which the different systems depart from\r\neach other, the law of the land takes place of the law of Rome,\r\nwhether antient or modern, imperial or pontificial. And in those of\r\nour English courts wherein a reception has been allowed to the civil\r\nand canon laws, if either they exceed the bounds of that reception, by\r\nextending themselves to other matters, than are permitted to them; or\r\nif such courts proceed according to the decisions of those laws, in\r\ncases wherein it is controlled by the law of the land, the common law\r\nin either instance both may, and frequently does, prohibit and annul\r\ntheir proceedings[k]: and it will not be a sufficient excuse for them\r\nto tell the king's courts at Westminster, that their practice is\r\nwarranted by the laws of Justinian or Gregory, or is conformable to\r\nthe decrees of the Rota or imperial chamber. For which reason it\r\nbecomes highly necessary for every civilian and canonist that would\r\nact with safety as a judge, or with prudence and reputation as an\r\nadvocate, to know in what cases and how far the English laws have\r\ngiven sanction to the Roman; in what points the latter are rejected;\r\nand where they are both so intermixed and blended together, as to form\r\ncertain supplemental parts of the common law of England, distinguished\r\nby the titles of the king's maritime, the king's military, and the\r\nking's ecclesiastical law. The propriety of which enquiry the\r\nuniversity of Oxford has for more than a century so thoroughly seen,\r\nthat in her statutes[l] she appoints, that one of the three questions\r\nto be annually discussed at the act by the jurist-inceptors shall\r\nrelate to the common law; subjoining this reason, \"_quia juris civilis\r\nstudiosos decet haud imperitos esse juris municipalis, & differentias\r\nexteri patriique juris notas habere_.\" And the statutes[m] of the\r\nuniversity of Cambridge speak expressly to the same effect.\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: _Dedicatio corporis juris civilis._ _Edit._ 1663.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Hale. Hist. C.L. c. 2. Selden _in Fletam_. 5 Rep.\r\nCaudrey's Case. 2 Inst. 599.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: _Tit. VII.

Cowel. _Institut. in proëmio._]\r\n\r\nFROM the general use and necessity of some acquaintance with the\r\ncommon law, the inference were extremely easy, with regard to the\r\npropriety of the present institution, in a place to which gentlemen of\r\nall ranks and degrees resort, as the fountain of all useful knowlege.\r\nBut how it has come to pass that a design of this sort has never\r\nbefore taken place in the university, and the reason why the study of\r\nour laws has in general fallen into disuse, I shall previously proceed\r\nto enquire.\r\n\r\nSIR John Fortescue, in his panegyric on the laws of England, (which\r\nwas written in the reign of Henry the sixth) puts[n] a very obvious\r\nquestion in the mouth of the young prince, whom he is exhorting to\r\napply himself to that branch of learning; \"why the laws of England,\r\nbeing so good, so fruitful, and so commodious, are not taught in the\r\nuniversities, as the civil and canon laws are?\" In answer to which he\r\ngives[o] what seems, with due deference be it spoken, a very jejune\r\nand unsatisfactory reason; being in short, that \"as the proceedings at\r\ncommon law were in his time carried on in three different tongues, the\r\nEnglish, the Latin, and the French, that science must be necessarily\r\ntaught in those three several languages; but that in the universities\r\nall sciences were taught in the Latin tongue only; and therefore he\r\nconcludes, that they could not be conveniently taught or studied in\r\nour universities.\" But without attempting to examine seriously the\r\nvalidity of this reason, (the very shadow of which by the wisdom of\r\nyour late constitutions is entirely taken away) we perhaps may find\r\nout a better, or at least a more plausible account, why the study of\r\nthe municipal laws has been banished from these seats of science, than\r\nwhat the learned chancellor thought it prudent to give to his royal\r\npupil.\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: _c._ 47.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: _c._ 48.]\r\n\r\nTHAT antient collection of unwritten maxims and customs, which is\r\ncalled the common law, however compounded or from whatever fountains\r\nderived, had subsisted immemorially in this kingdom; and, though\r\nsomewhat altered and impaired by the violence of the times, had in\r\ngreat measure weathered the rude shock of the Norman conquest. This\r\nhad endeared it to the people in general, as well because it's\r\ndecisions were universally known, as because it was found to be\r\nexcellently adapted to the genius of the English nation. In the\r\nknowlege of this law consisted great part of the learning of those\r\ndark ages; it was then taught, says Mr Selden[p], in the monasteries,\r\n_in the universities_, and in the families of the principal nobility.\r\nThe clergy in particular, as they then engrossed almost every other\r\nbranch of learning, so (like their predecessors the British druids[q])\r\nthey were peculiarly remarkable for their proficiency in the study of\r\nthe law. _Nullus clericus nisi causidicus_, is the character given of\r\nthem soon after the conquest by William of Malmsbury[r]. The judges\r\ntherefore were usually created out of the sacred order[s], as was\r\nlikewise the case among the Normans[t]; and all the inferior offices\r\nwere supplied by the lower clergy, which has occasioned their\r\nsuccessors to be denominated _clerks_ to this day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: _in Fletam._ 7. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: Caesar _de bello Gal._ 6. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: _de gest. reg._ _l._ 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: Dugdale _Orig. jurid._ _c._ 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: _Les juges sont sages personnes & autentiques,--sicome\r\nles archevesques, evesques, les chanoines les eglises cathedraulx, &\r\nles autres personnes qui ont dignitez in saincte eglise; les abbez,\r\nles prieurs conventaulx, & les gouverneurs des eglises, &c._ _Grand\r\nCoustumier_, _ch._ 9.]\r\n\r\nBUT the common law of England, being not committed to writing, but\r\nonly handed down by tradition, use, and experience, was not so\r\nheartily relished by the foreign clergy; who came over hither in\r\nshoals during the reign of the conqueror and his two sons, and were\r\nutter strangers to our constitution as well as our language. And an\r\naccident, which soon after happened, had nearly completed it's ruin. A\r\ncopy of Justinian's pandects, being newly[u] discovered at Amalfi,\r\nsoon brought the civil law into vogue all over the west of Europe,\r\nwhere before it was quite laid aside[w] and in a manner forgotten;\r\nthough some traces of it's authority remained in Italy[x] and the\r\neastern provinces of the empire[y]. This now became in a particular\r\nmanner the favourite of the popish clergy, who borrowed the method and\r\nmany of the maxims of their canon law from this original. The study of\r\nit was introduced into several universities abroad, particularly that\r\nof Bologna; where exercises were performed, lectures read, and degrees\r\nconferred in this faculty, as in other branches of science: and many\r\nnations on the continent, just then beginning to recover from the\r\nconvulsions consequent upon the overthrow of the Roman empire, and\r\nsettling by degrees into peaceable forms of government, adopted the\r\ncivil law, (being the best written system then extant) as the basis of\r\ntheir several constitutions; blending and interweaving it among their\r\nown feodal customs, in some places with a more extensive, in others a\r\nmore confined authority[z].\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: _circ. A.D._ 1130.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: _LL. Wisigoth._ 2. 1. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: _Capitular. Hludov. Pii._ 4. 102.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Selden _in Fletam._ 5. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: Domat's treatise of laws. c. 13. §. 9. _Epistol.\r\nInnocent. IV. in M. Paris. ad A.D._ 1254.]\r\n\r\nNOR was it long before the prevailing mode of the times reached\r\nEngland. For Theobald, a Norman abbot, being elected to the see of\r\nCanterbury[a], and extremely addicted to this new study, brought over\r\nwith him in his retinue many learned proficients therein; and among\r\nthe rest Roger sirnamed Vacarius, whom he placed in the university of\r\nOxford[b], to teach it to the people of this country. But it did not\r\nmeet with the same easy reception in England, where a mild and\r\nrational system of laws had been long established, as it did upon the\r\ncontinent; and, though the monkish clergy (devoted to the will of a\r\nforeign primate) received it with eagerness and zeal, yet the laity\r\nwho were more interested to preserve the old constitution, and had\r\nalready severely felt the effect of many Norman innovations, continued\r\nwedded to the use of the common law. King Stephen immediately\r\npublished a proclamation[c], forbidding the study of the laws, then\r\nnewly imported from Italy; which was treated by the monks[d] as a\r\npiece of impiety, and, though it might prevent the introduction of the\r\ncivil law process into our courts of justice, yet did not hinder the\r\nclergy from reading and teaching it in their own schools and\r\nmonasteries.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: _A.D._ 1138.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Gervas. Dorobern. _Act. Pontif. Cantuar. col._ 1665.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Rog. Bacon. _citat. per_ Selden. _in Fletam._ 7. 6. _in\r\nFortesc._ _c._ 33. & 8 Rep. Pref.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: Joan. Sarisburiens. _Polycrat._ 8. 22.]\r\n\r\nFROM this time the nation seems to have been divided into two parties;\r\nthe bishops and clergy, many of them foreigners, who applied\r\nthemselves wholly to the study of the civil and canon laws, which now\r\ncame to be inseparably interwoven with each other; and the nobility\r\nand laity, who adhered with equal pertinacity to the old common law;\r\nboth of them reciprocally jealous of what they were unacquainted with,\r\nand neither of them perhaps allowing the opposite system that real\r\nmerit which is abundantly to be found in each. This appears on the one\r\nhand from the spleen with which the monastic writers[e] speak of our\r\nmunicipal laws upon all occasions; and, on the other, from the firm\r\ntemper which the nobility shewed at the famous parliament of Merton;\r\nwhen the prelates endeavoured to procure an act, to declare all\r\nbastards legitimate in case the parents intermarried at any time\r\nafterwards; alleging this only reason, because holy church (that is,\r\nthe canon law) declared such children legitimate: but \"all the earls\r\nand barons (says the parliament roll[f]) with one voice answered, that\r\nthey would not change the laws of England, which had hitherto been\r\nused and approved.\" And we find the same jealousy prevailing above a\r\ncentury afterwards[g], when the nobility declared with a kind of\r\nprophetic spirit, \"that the realm of England hath never been unto this\r\nhour, neither by the consent of our lord the king and the lords of\r\nparliament shall it ever be, ruled or governed by the civil law[h].\"\r\nAnd of this temper between the clergy and laity many more instances\r\nmight be given.\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: _Idem, ibid._ 5. 16. Polydor. Vergil. _Hist._ _l._ 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: _Stat. Merton._ 20 _Hen. III._ _c._ 9. _Et omnes comites\r\n& barones una voce responderunt, quod nolunt leges Angliae mutare,\r\nquae hucusque usitatae sunt & approbatae._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: 11 Ric. II.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Selden. _Jan. Anglor._ _l._ 2. §. 43. _in Fortesc._ _c._\r\n33.]\r\n\r\nWHILE things were in this situation, the clergy, finding it impossible\r\nto root out the municipal law, began to withdraw themselves by degrees\r\nfrom the temporal courts; and to that end, very early in the reign of\r\nking Henry the third, episcopal constitutions were published[i],\r\nforbidding all ecclesiastics to appear as advocates _in foro\r\nsaeculari_; nor did they long continue to act as judges there, nor\r\ncaring to take the oath of office which was then found necessary to be\r\nadministred, that they should in all things determine according to the\r\nlaw and custom of this realm[k]; though they still kept possession of\r\nthe high office of chancellor, an office then of little juridical\r\npower; and afterwards, as it's business increased by degrees, they\r\nmodelled the process of the court at their own discretion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: Spelman. _Concil. A.D._ 1217. Wilkins, _vol._ 1. _p._\r\n574, 599.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Selden. _in Fletam._ 9. 3.]\r\n\r\nBUT wherever they retired, and wherever their authority extended, they\r\ncarried with them the same zeal to introduce the rules of the civil,\r\nin exclusion of the municipal law. This appears in a particular manner\r\nfrom the spiritual courts of all denominations, from the chancellor's\r\ncourts in both our universities, and from the high court of chancery\r\nbefore-mentioned; in all of which the proceedings are to this day in a\r\ncourse much conformed to the civil law: for which no tolerable reason\r\ncan be assigned, unless that these courts were all under the immediate\r\ndirection of the popish ecclesiastics, among whom it was a point of\r\nreligion to exclude the municipal law; pope Innocent the fourth\r\nhaving[l] forbidden the very reading of it by the clergy, because it's\r\ndecisions were not founded on the imperial constitutions, but merely\r\non the customs of the laity. And if it be considered, that our\r\nuniversities began about that period to receive their present form of\r\nscholastic discipline; that they were then, and continued to be till\r\nthe time of the reformation, entirely under the influence of the\r\npopish clergy; (sir John Mason the first protestant, being also the\r\nfirst lay, chancellor of Oxford) this will lead us to perceive the\r\nreason, why the study of the Roman laws was in those days of\r\nbigotry[m] pursued with such alacrity in these seats of learning; and\r\nwhy the common law was entirely despised, and esteemed little better\r\nthan heretical.\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: M. Paris _ad A.D._ 1254.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: There cannot be a stronger instance of the absurd and\r\nsuperstitious veneration that was paid to these laws, than that the\r\nmost learned writers of the times thought they could not form a\r\nperfect character, even of the blessed virgin, without making her a\r\ncivilian and a canonist. Which Albertus Magnus, the renowned dominican\r\ndoctor of the thirteenth century, thus proves in his _Summa de\r\nlaudibus christiferae virginis (divinum magis quam humanum opus)_\r\n_qu._ 23. §. 5. \"_Item quod jura civilia, & leges, & decreta scivit in\r\nsummo, probatur hoc modo: sapientia advocati manifestatur in tribus;\r\nunum, quod obtineat omnia contra judicem justum & sapientem; secundo,\r\nquod contra adversarium astutum & sagacem; tertio, quod in causa\r\ndesperata: sed beatissima virgo, contra judicem sapientissimum,\r\nDominum; contra adversarium callidissimum, dyabolum; in causa nostra\r\ndesperata; sententiam optatam obtinuit._\" To which an eminent\r\nfranciscan, two centuries afterwards, Bernardinus de Busti (_Mariale_,\r\n_part._ 4. _serm._ 9.) very gravely subjoins this note. \"_Nec videtur\r\nincongruum mulieres habere peritiam juris. Legitur enim de uxore\r\nJoannis Andreae glossatoris, quod tantam peritiam in utroque jure\r\nhabuit, ut publice in scholis legere ausa sit._\"]\r\n\r\nAND, since the reformation, many causes have conspired to prevent it's\r\nbecoming a part of academical education. As, first, long usage and\r\nestablished custom; which, as in every thing else, so especially in\r\nthe forms of scholastic exercise, have justly great weight and\r\nauthority. Secondly, the real intrinsic merit of the civil law,\r\nconsidered upon the footing of reason and not of obligation, which was\r\nwell known to the instructors of our youth; and their total ignorance\r\nof the merit of the common law, though it's equal at least, and\r\nperhaps an improvement on the other. But the principal reason of all,\r\nthat has hindered the introduction of this branch of learning, is,\r\nthat the study of the common law, being banished from hence in the\r\ntimes of popery, has fallen into a quite different chanel, and has\r\nhitherto been wholly cultivated in another place. But as this long\r\nusage and established custom, of ignorance in the laws of the land,\r\nbegin now to be thought unreasonable; and as by this means the merit\r\nof those laws will probably be more generally known; we may hope that\r\nthe method of studying them will soon revert to it's antient course,\r\nand the foundations at least of that science will be laid in the two\r\nuniversities; without being exclusively confined to the chanel which\r\nit fell into at the times I have been just describing.\r\n\r\nFOR, being then entirely abandoned by the clergy, a few stragglers\r\nexcepted, the study and practice of it devolved of course into the\r\nhands of laymen; who entertained upon their parts a most hearty\r\naversion to the civil law[n], and made no scruple to profess their\r\ncontempt, nay even their ignorance[o] of it, in the most public\r\nmanner. But still, as the ballance of learning was greatly on the side\r\nof the clergy, and as the common law was no longer _taught_, as\r\nformerly, in any part of the kingdom, it must have been subjected to\r\nmany inconveniences, and perhaps would have been gradually lost and\r\noverrun by the civil, (a suspicion well justified from the frequent\r\ntranscripts of Justinian to be met with in Bracton and Fleta) had it\r\nnot been for a peculiar incident, which happened at a very critical\r\ntime, and contributed greatly to it's support.\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: Fortesc. _de laud. LL._ _c._ 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: This remarkably appeared in the case of the abbot of\r\nTorun, _M._ 22 _E._ 3. 24. who had caused a certain prior to be\r\nsummoned to answer at Avignon for erecting an oratory _contra\r\ninhibitionem novi operis_; by which words Mr Selden, (_in Flet._ 8.\r\n5.) very justly understands to be meant the title _de novi operis\r\nnuntiatione_ both in the civil and canon laws, (_Ff._ 39. 1. _C._ 8.\r\n11. and _Decretal._ not _Extrav._ 5. 32.) whereby the erection of any\r\nnew buildings in prejudice of more antient ones was prohibited. But\r\nSkipwith the king's serjeant, and afterwards chief baron of the\r\nexchequer, declares them to be flat nonsense; \"_in ceux parolx_,\r\ncontra inhibitionem novi operis, _ny ad pas entendment_:\" and justice\r\nSchardelow mends the matter but little by informing him, that they\r\nsignify a restitution _in their law_; for which reason he very sagely\r\nresolves to pay no sort of regard to them. \"_Ceo n'est que un\r\nrestitution en lour ley, pur que a ceo n'avomus regard, &c._\"]\r\n\r\nTHE incident I mean was the fixing the court of common pleas, the\r\ngrand tribunal for disputes of property, to be held in one certain\r\nspot; that the seat of ordinary justice might be permanent and\r\nnotorious to all the nation. Formerly that, in conjunction with all\r\nthe other superior courts, was held before the king's capital\r\njusticiary of England, in the _aula regis_, or such of his palaces\r\nwherein his royal person resided; and removed with his houshold from\r\none end of the kingdom to the other. This was found to occasion great\r\ninconvenience to the suitors; to remedy which it was made an article\r\nof the great charter of liberties, both that of king John and king\r\nHenry the third[p], that \"common pleas should no longer follow the\r\nking's court, but be held in some certain place:\" in consequence of\r\nwhich they have ever since been held (a few necessary removals in\r\ntimes of the plague excepted) in the palace of Westminster only. This\r\nbrought together the professors of the municipal law, who before were\r\ndispersed about the kingdom, and formed them into an aggregate body;\r\nwhereby a society was established of persons, who (as Spelman[q]\r\nobserves) addicting themselves wholly to the study of the laws of the\r\nland, and no longer considering it as a mere subordinate science for\r\nthe amusement of leisure hours, soon raised those laws to that pitch\r\nof perfection, which they suddenly attained under the auspices of our\r\nEnglish Justinian, king Edward the first.\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: _c._ 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: _Glossar._ 334.]\r\n\r\nIN consequence of this lucky assemblage, they naturally fell into a\r\nkind of collegiate order, and, being excluded from Oxford and\r\nCambridge, found it necessary to establish a new university of their\r\nown. This they did by purchasing at various times certain houses (now\r\ncalled the inns of court and of chancery) between the city of\r\nWestminster, the place of holding the king's courts, and the city of\r\nLondon; for advantage of ready access to the one, and plenty of\r\nprovisions in the other[r]. Here exercises were performed, lectures\r\nread, and degrees were at length conferred in the common law, as at\r\nother universities in the canon and civil. The degrees were those of\r\nbarristers (first stiled apprentices[s] from _apprendre_, to learn)\r\nwho answered to our bachelors; as the state and degree of a\r\nserjeant[t], _servientis ad legem_, did to that of doctor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Fortesc. _c._ 48.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: Apprentices or Barristers seem to have been first\r\nappointed by an ordinance of king Edward the first in parliament, in\r\nthe 20th year of his reign. (Spelm. _Gloss._ 37. Dugdale. _Orig.\r\njurid._ 55.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: The first mention I have met with in our lawbooks of\r\nserjeants or countors, is in the statute of Westm. 1. 3 Edw. I. c. 29.\r\nand in Horn's Mirror, _c._ 1. §. 10. _c._ 2. §. 5. _c._ 3. §. 1. in\r\nthe same reign. But M. Paris in his life of John II, abbot of St.\r\nAlban's, which he wrote in 1255, 39 Hen. III. speaks of advocates at\r\nthe common law, or countors (_quos banci narratores vulgariter\r\nappellamus_) as of an order of men well known. And we have an example\r\nof the antiquity of the coif in the same author's history of England,\r\n_A.D._ 1259. in the case of one William de Bussy; who, being called to\r\naccount for his great knavery and malpractices, claimed the benefit of\r\nhis orders or clergy, which till then remained an entire secret; and\r\nto that end _voluit ligamenta coifae suae solvere, ut palam monstraret\r\nse tonsuram habere clericalem; sed non est permissus.----Satelles vero\r\neum arripiens, non per coifae ligamina sed per guttur eum\r\napprehendens, traxit ad carcerem_. And hence sir H. Spelman\r\nconjectures, (_Glossar._ 335.) that coifs were introduced to hide the\r\ntonsure of such renegade clerks, as were still tempted to remain in\r\nthe secular courts in the quality of advocates or judges,\r\nnotwithstanding their prohibition by canon.]\r\n\r\nTHE crown seems to have soon taken under it's protection this infant\r\nseminary of common law; and, the more effectually to foster and\r\ncherish it, king Henry the third in the nineteenth year of his reign\r\nissued out an order directed to the mayor and sheriffs of London,\r\ncommanding that no regent of any law schools _within_ that city should\r\nfor the future teach law therein[u]. The word, law, or _leges_, being\r\na general term, may create some doubt at this distance of time whether\r\nthe teaching of the civil law, or the common, or both, is hereby\r\nrestrained. But in either case it tends to the same end. If the civil\r\nlaw only is prohibited, (which is Mr Selden's[w] opinion) it is then a\r\nretaliation upon the clergy, who had excluded the common law from\r\n_their_ seats of learning. If the municipal law be also included in\r\nthe restriction, (as sir Edward Coke[x] understands it, and which the\r\nwords seem to import) then the intention is evidently this; by\r\npreventing private teachers within the walls of the city, to collect\r\nall the common lawyers into the one public university, which was newly\r\ninstituted in the suburbs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: _Ne aliquis scholas regens de legibus in eadem civitate\r\nde caetero ibidem leges doceat._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: _in Flet._ 8. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: 2 Inst. proëm.]\r\n\r\nIN this juridical university (for such it is insisted to have been by\r\nFortescue[y] and sir Edward Coke[z]) there are two sorts of collegiate\r\nhouses; one called inns of chancery, in which the younger students of\r\nthe law were usually placed, \"learning and studying, says\r\nFortescue[a], the originals and as it were the elements of the law;\r\nwho, profiting therein, as they grow to ripeness so are they admitted\r\ninto the greater inns of the same study, called the inns of court.\"\r\nAnd in these inns of both kinds, he goes on to tell us, the knights\r\nand barons, with other grandees and noblemen of the realm, did use to\r\nplace their children, though they did not desire to have them\r\nthoroughly learned in the law, or to get their living by it's\r\npractice: and that in his time there were about two thousand students\r\nat these several inns, all of whom he informs us were _filii\r\nnobilium_, or gentlemen born.\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: _c._ 49.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: 3 Rep. pref.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: _ibid._]\r\n\r\nHENCE it is evident, that (though under the influence of the monks our\r\nuniversities neglected this study, yet) in the time of Henry the sixth\r\nit was thought highly necessary and was the universal practice, for\r\nthe young nobility and gentry to be instructed in the originals and\r\nelements of the laws. But by degres [Transcriber's Note: degrees] this\r\ncustom has fallen into disuse; so that in the reign of queen Elizabeth\r\nsir Edward Coke[b] does not reckon above a thousand students, and the\r\nnumber at present is very considerably less. Which seems principally\r\nowing to these reasons: first, because the inns of chancery being now\r\nalmost totally filled by the inferior branch of the profession, they\r\nare neither commodious nor proper for the resort of gentlemen of any\r\nrank or figure; so that there are now very rarely any young students\r\nentered at the inns of chancery: secondly, because in the inns of\r\ncourt all sorts of regimen and academical superintendance, either with\r\nregard to morals or studies, are found impracticable and therefore\r\nentirely neglected: lastly, because persons of birth and fortune,\r\nafter having finished their usual courses at the universities, have\r\nseldom leisure or resolution sufficient to enter upon a new scheme of\r\nstudy at a new place of instruction. Wherefore few gentlemen now\r\nresort to the inns of court, but such for whom the knowlege of\r\npractice is absolutely necessary; such, I mean, as are intended for\r\nthe profession: the rest of our gentry, (not to say our nobility also)\r\nhaving usually retired to their estates, or visited foreign kingdoms,\r\nor entered upon public life, without any instruction in the laws of\r\nthe land; and indeed with hardly any opportunity of gaining\r\ninstruction, unless it can be afforded them in these seats of\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: _ibid._]\r\n\r\nAND that these are the proper places, for affording assistances of\r\nthis kind to gentlemen of all stations and degrees, cannot (I think)\r\nwith any colour of reason be denied. For not one of the objections,\r\nwhich are made to the inns of court and chancery, and which I have\r\njust enumerated, will hold with regard to the universities. Gentlemen\r\nmay here associate with gentlemen of their own rank and degree. Nor\r\nare their conduct and studies left entirely to their own discretion;\r\nbut regulated by a discipline so wise and exact, yet so liberal, so\r\nsensible and manly, that their conformity to it's rules (which does at\r\npresent so much honour to our youth) is not more the effect of\r\nconstraint, than of their own inclinations and choice. Neither need\r\nthey apprehend too long an avocation hereby from their private\r\nconcerns and amusements, or (what is a more noble object) the service\r\nof their friends and their country. This study will go hand in hand\r\nwith their other pursuits: it will obstruct none of them; it will\r\nornament and assist them all.\r\n\r\nBUT if, upon the whole, there are any still wedded to monastic\r\nprejudice, that can entertain a doubt how far this study is properly\r\nand regularly _academical_, such persons I am afraid either have not\r\nconsidered the constitution and design of an university, or else think\r\nvery meanly of it. It must be a deplorable narrowness of mind, that\r\nwould confine these seats of instruction to the limited views of one\r\nor two learned professions. To the praise of this age be it spoken, a\r\nmore open and generous way of thinking begins now universally to\r\nprevail. The attainment of liberal and genteel accomplishments, though\r\nnot of the intellectual sort, has been thought by our wisest and most\r\naffectionate patrons[c], and very lately by the whole university[d],\r\nno small improvement of our antient plan of education; and therefore I\r\nmay safely affirm that nothing (how _unusual_ soever) is, under due\r\nregulations, improper to be _taught_ in this place, which is proper\r\nfor a gentleman to _learn_. But that a science, which distinguishes\r\nthe criterions of right and wrong; which teaches to establish the one,\r\nand prevent, punish, or redress the other; which employs in it's\r\ntheory the noblest faculties of the soul, and exerts in it's practice\r\nthe cardinal virtues of the heart; a science, which is universal in\r\nit's use and extent, accommodated to each individual, yet\r\ncomprehending the whole community; that a science like this should\r\nhave ever been deemed unnecessary to be studied in an university, is\r\nmatter of astonishment and concern. Surely, if it were not before an\r\nobject of academical knowlege, it was high time to make it one; and to\r\nthose who can doubt the propriety of it's reception among us (if any\r\nsuch there be) we may return an answer in their own way; that ethics\r\nare confessedly a branch of academical learning, and Aristotle\r\n_himself has said_, speaking of the laws of his own country, that\r\njurisprudence or the knowlege of those laws is the principal and\r\nmost[e] perfect branch of ethics.\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Lord chancellor Clarendon, in his dialogue of education,\r\namong his tracts, p. 325. appears to have been very solicitous, that\r\nit might be made \"a part of the ornament of our learned academies to\r\nteach the qualities of riding, dancing, and fencing, at those hours\r\nwhen more serious exercises should be intermitted.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: By accepting in full convocation the remainder of lord\r\nClarendon's history from his noble descendants, on condition to apply\r\nthe profits arising from it's publication to the establishment of a\r\n_manage_ in the university.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: [Greek: Teleia malista aretê, hoti tês teleias aretês\r\nchrêsis esti.] _Ethic. ad Nicomach._ _l._ 5. _c._ 3.]\r\n\r\nFROM a thorough conviction of this truth, our munificent benefactor Mr\r\nVINER, having employed above half a century in amassing materials for\r\nnew modelling and rendering more commodious the rude study of the laws\r\nof the land, consigned both the plan and execution of these his\r\npublic-spirited designs to the wisdom of his parent university.\r\nResolving to dedicate his learned labours \"to the benefit of posterity\r\nand the perpetual service of his country[f],\" he was sensible he could\r\nnot perform his resolutions in a better and more effectual manner,\r\nthan by extending to the youth of this place those assistances, of\r\nwhich he so well remembered and so heartily regretted the want. And\r\nthe sense, which the university has entertained of this ample and most\r\nuseful benefaction, must appear beyond a doubt from their gratitude in\r\nreceiving it with all possible marks of esteem[g]; from their alacrity\r\nand unexampled dispatch in carrying it into execution[h]; and, above\r\nall, from the laws and constitutions by which they have effectually\r\nguarded it from the neglect and abuse to which such institutions are\r\nliable[i]. We have seen an universal emulation, who best should\r\nunderstand, or most faithfully pursue, the designs of our generous\r\npatron: and with pleasure we recollect, that those who are most\r\ndistinguished by their quality, their fortune, their station, their\r\nlearning, or their experience, have appeared the most zealous to\r\npromote the success of Mr Viner's establishment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: See the preface to the eighteenth volume of his\r\nabridgment.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Mr Viner is enrolled among the public benefactors of the\r\nuniversity by decree of convocation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Mr Viner died June 5, 1756. His effects were collected\r\nand settled, near a volume of his work printed, almost the whole\r\ndisposed of, and the accounts made up, in a year and a half from his\r\ndecease, by the very diligent and worthy administrators with the will\r\nannexed, (Dr West and Dr Good of Magdalene, Dr Whalley of Oriel, Mr\r\nBuckler of All Souls, and Mr Betts of University college) to whom that\r\ncare was consigned by the university. Another half year was employed\r\nin considering and settling a plan of the proposed institution, and in\r\nframing the statutes thereupon, which were finally confirmed by\r\nconvocation on the 3d of July, 1758. The professor was elected on\r\nthe 20th of October following, and two scholars on the succeeding\r\nday. And, lastly, it was agreed at the annual audit in 1761, to\r\nestablish a fellowship; and a fellow was accordingly elected in\r\nJanuary following.--The residue of this fund, arising from the sale of\r\nMr Viner's abridgment, will probably be sufficient hereafter to found\r\nanother fellowship and scholarship, or three more scholarships, as\r\nshall be thought most expedient.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: The statutes are in substance as follows:\r\n\r\n1. THAT the accounts of this benefaction be separately kept, and\r\nannually audited by the delegates of accounts and professor, and\r\nafterwards reported to convocation.\r\n\r\n2. THAT a professorship of the laws of England be established, with a\r\nsalary of two hundred pounds _per annum_; the professor to be elected\r\nby convocation, and to be at the time of his election at least a\r\nmaster of arts or bachelor of civil law in the university of Oxford,\r\nof ten years standing from his matriculation; and also a barrister at\r\nlaw of four years standing at the bar.\r\n\r\n3. THAT such professor (by himself, or by deputy to be previously\r\napproved by convocation) do read one solemn public lecture on the laws\r\nof England, and in the English language, in every academical term, at\r\ncertain stated times previous to the commencement of the common law\r\nterm; or forfeit twenty pounds for every omission to Mr Viner's\r\ngeneral fund: and also (by himself, or by deputy to be approved, if\r\noccasional, by the vice-chancellor and proctors; or, if permanent,\r\nboth the cause and the deputy to be annually approved by convocation)\r\ndo yearly read one complete course of lectures on the laws of England,\r\nand in the English language, consisting of sixty lectures at the\r\nleast, to be read during the university term time, with such proper\r\nintervals that not more than four lectures may fall within any single\r\nweek: that the professor do give a month's notice of the time when the\r\ncourse is to begin, and do read _gratis_ to the scholars of Mr Viner's\r\nfoundation; but may demand of other auditors such gratuity as shall be\r\nsettled from time to time by decree of convocation: and that, for\r\nevery of the said sixty lectures omitted, the professor, on complaint\r\nmade to the vice-chancellor within the year, do forfeit forty\r\nshillings to Mr Viner's general fund; the proof of having performed\r\nhis duty to lie upon the said professor.\r\n\r\n4. THAT every professor do continue in his office during life, unless\r\nin case of such misbehaviour as shall amount to bannition by the\r\nuniversity statutes; or unless he deserts the profession of the law by\r\nbetaking himself to another profession; or unless, after one\r\nadmonition by the vice-chancellor and proctors for notorious neglect,\r\nhe is guilty of another flagrant omission: in any of which cases he be\r\ndeprived by the vice-chancellor, with consent of the house of\r\nconvocation.\r\n\r\n5. THAT such a number of fellowships with a stipend of fifty pounds\r\n_per annum_, and scholarships with a stipend of thirty pounds be\r\nestablished, as the convocation shall from time to time ordain,\r\naccording to the state of Mr Viner's revenues.\r\n\r\n6. THAT every fellow be elected by convocation, and at the time of\r\nelection be unmarried, and at least a master of arts or bachelor of\r\ncivil law, and a member of some college or hall in the university of\r\nOxford; the scholars of this foundation or such as have been scholars\r\n(if qualified and approved of by convocation) to have the preference:\r\nthat, if not a barrister when chosen, he be called to the bar within\r\none year after his election; but do reside in the university two\r\nmonths in every year, or in case of non-residence do forfeit the\r\nstipend of that year to Mr Viner's general fund.\r\n\r\n7. THAT every scholar be elected by convocation, and at the time of\r\nelection be unmarried, and a member of some college or hall in the\r\nuniversity of Oxford, who shall have been matriculated twenty four\r\ncalendar months at the least: that he do take the degree of bachelor\r\nof civil law with all convenient speed; (either proceeding in arts or\r\notherwise) and previous to his taking the same, between the second and\r\neighth year from his matriculation, be bound to attend two courses of\r\nthe professor's lectures, to be certified under the professor's hand;\r\nand within one year after taking the same be called to the bar: that\r\nhe do annually reside six months till he is of four years standing,\r\nand four months from that time till he is master of arts or bachelor\r\nof civil law; after which he be bound to reside two months in every\r\nyear; or, in case of non-residence, do forfeit the stipend of that\r\nyear to Mr Viner's general fund.\r\n\r\n8. THAT the scholarships do become void in case of non-attendance on\r\nthe professor, or not taking the degree of bachelor of civil law,\r\nbeing duly admonished so to do by the vice-chancellor and proctors:\r\nand that both fellowships and scholarships do expire at the end of ten\r\nyears after each respective election; and become void in case of gross\r\nmisbehaviour, non-residence for two years together, marriage, not\r\nbeing called to the bar within the time before limited, (being duly\r\nadmonished so to be by the vice-chancellor and proctors) or deserting\r\nthe profession of the law by following any other profession: and that\r\nin any of these cases the vice-chancellor, with consent of\r\nconvocation, do declare the place actually void.\r\n\r\n9. THAT in case of any vacancy of the professorship, fellowships, or\r\nscholarships, the profits of the current year be ratably divided\r\nbetween the predecessor or his representatives, and the successor; and\r\nthat a new election be had within one month afterwards, unless by that\r\nmeans the time of election shall fall within any vacation, in which\r\ncase it be deferred to the first week in the next full term. And that\r\nbefore any convocation shall be held for such election, or for any\r\nother matter relating to Mr Viner's benefaction, ten days public\r\nnotice be given to each college and hall of the convocation, and the\r\ncause of convoking it.]\r\n\r\nTHE advantages that might result to the science of the law itself,\r\nwhen a little more attended to in these seats of knowlege, perhaps\r\nwould be very considerable. The leisure and abilities of the learned\r\nin these retirements might either suggest expedients, or execute those\r\ndictated by wiser heads[k], for improving it's method, retrenching\r\nit's superfluities, and reconciling the little contrarieties, which\r\nthe practice of many centuries will necessarily create in any human\r\nsystem: a task, which those who are deeply employed in business, and\r\nthe more active scenes of the profession, can hardly condescend to\r\nengage in. And as to the interest, or (which is the same) the\r\nreputation of the universities themselves, I may venture to pronounce,\r\nthat if ever this study should arrive to any tolerable perfection\r\neither here or at Cambridge, the nobility and gentry of this kingdom\r\nwould not shorten their residence upon this account, nor perhaps\r\nentertain a worse opinion of the benefits of academical education.\r\nNeither should it be considered as a matter of light importance, that\r\nwhile we thus extend the _pomoeria_ of university learning, and adopt\r\na new tribe of citizens within these philosophical walls, we interest\r\na very numerous and very powerful profession in the preservation of\r\nour rights and revenues.\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: See lord Bacon's proposals and offer of a digest.]\r\n\r\nFOR I think it is past dispute that those gentlemen, who resort to the\r\ninns of court with a view to pursue the profession, will find it\r\nexpedient (whenever it is practicable) to lay the previous foundations\r\nof this, as well as every other science, in one of our learned\r\nuniversities. We may appeal to the experience of every sensible\r\nlawyer, whether any thing can be more hazardous or discouraging than\r\nthe usual entrance on the study of the law. A raw and unexperienced\r\nyouth, in the most dangerous season of life, is transpanted\r\n[Transcriber's Note: transplanted] on a sudden into the midst of\r\nallurements to pleasure, without any restraint or check but what his\r\nown prudence can suggest; with no public direction in what course to\r\npursue his enquiries; no private assistance to remove the distresses\r\nand difficulties, which will always embarass a beginner. In this\r\nsituation he is expected to sequester himself from the world, and by a\r\ntedious lonely process to extract the theory of law from a mass of\r\nundigested learning; or else by an assiduous attendance on the courts\r\nto pick up theory and practice together, sufficient to qualify him for\r\nthe ordinary run of business. How little therefore is it to be\r\nwondered at, that we hear of so frequent miscarriages; that so many\r\ngentlemen of bright imaginations grow weary of so unpromising a\r\nsearch[l], and addict themselves wholly to amusements, or other less\r\ninnocent pursuits; and that so many persons of moderate capacity\r\nconfuse themselves at first setting out, and continue ever dark and\r\npuzzled during the remainder of their lives!\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: Sir Henry Spelman, in the preface to his glossary, gives\r\nus a very lively picture of his own distress upon this occasion.\r\n\"_Emisit me mater Londinum, juris nostri capessendi gratia; cujus cum\r\nvestibulum salutassem, reperissemque linguam peregrinam, dialectum\r\nbarbaram, methodum inconcinnam, molem non ingentem solum sed perpetuis\r\nhumeris sustinendam, excidit mihi (fateor) animus, &c._\"]\r\n\r\nTHE evident want of some assistance in the rudiments of legal\r\nknowlege, has given birth to a practice, which, if ever it had grown\r\nto be general, must have proved of extremely pernicious consequence:\r\nI mean the custom, by some so very warmly recommended, to drop all\r\nliberal education, as of no use to lawyers; and to place them, in it's\r\nstead, as [Transcriber's Note: at] the desk of some skilful attorney;\r\nin order to initiate them early in all the depths of practice, and\r\nrender them more dextrous in the mechanical part of business. A few\r\ninstances of particular persons, (men of excellent learning, and\r\nunblemished integrity) who, in spight of this method of education,\r\nhave shone in the foremost ranks of the bar, have afforded some kind\r\nof sanction to this illiberal path to the profession, and biassed many\r\nparents, of shortsighted judgment, in it's favour: not considering,\r\nthat there are some geniuses, formed to overcome all disadvantages,\r\nand that from such particular instances no general rules can be\r\nformed; nor observing, that those very persons have frequently\r\nrecommended by the most forcible of all examples, the disposal of\r\ntheir own offspring, a very different foundation of legal studies, a\r\nregular academical education. Perhaps too, in return, I could now\r\ndirect their eyes to our principal seats of justice, and suggest a few\r\nhints, in favour of university learning[m]:--but in these all who hear\r\nme, I know, have already prevented me.\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: The four highest offices in the law were at that time\r\nfilled by gentlemen, two of whom had been fellows of All Souls\r\ncollege; another, student of Christ-Church; and the fourth a fellow of\r\nTrinity college, Cambridge.]\r\n\r\nMAKING therefore due allowance for one or two shining exceptions,\r\nexperience may teach us to foretell that a lawyer thus educated to the\r\nbar, in subservience to attorneys and solicitors[n], will find he has\r\nbegun at the wrong end. If practice be the whole he is taught,\r\npractice must also be the whole he will ever know: if he be\r\nuninstructed in the elements and first principles upon which the rule\r\nof practice is founded, the least variation from established\r\nprecedents will totally distract and bewilder him: _ita lex scripta\r\nest_[o] is the utmost his knowlege will arrive at; he must never\r\naspire to form, and seldom expect to comprehend, any arguments drawn\r\n_a priori_, from the spirit of the laws and the natural foundations of\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: See Kennet's life of Somner. p. 67.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: _Ff._ 40. 9. 12.]\r\n\r\nNOR is this all; for (as few persons of birth, or fortune, or even of\r\nscholastic education, will submit to the drudgery of servitude and the\r\nmanual labour of copying the trash of an office) should this\r\ninfatuation prevail to any considerable degree, we must rarely expect\r\nto see a gentleman of distinction or learning at the bar. And what the\r\nconsequence may be, to have the interpretation and enforcement of the\r\nlaws (which include the entire disposal of our properties, liberties,\r\nand lives) fall wholly into the hands of obscure or illiterate men, is\r\nmatter of very public concern.\r\n\r\nTHE inconveniences here pointed out can never be effectually\r\nprevented, but by making academical education a previous step to the\r\nprofession of the common law, and at the same time making the\r\nrudiments of the law a part of academical education. For sciences are\r\nof a sociable disposition, and flourish best in the neighbourhood of\r\neach other: nor is there any branch of learning, but may be helped and\r\nimproved by assistances drawn from other arts. If therefore the\r\nstudent in our laws hath formed both his sentiments and style, by\r\nperusal and imitation of the purest classical writers, among whom the\r\nhistorians and orators will best deserve his regard; if he can reason\r\nwith precision, and separate argument from fallacy, by the clear\r\nsimple rules of pure unsophisticated logic; if he can fix his\r\nattention, and steadily pursue truth through any the most intricate\r\ndeduction, by the use of mathematical demonstrations; if he has\r\nenlarged his conceptions of nature and art, by a view of the several\r\nbranches of genuine, experimental, philosophy; if he has impressed on\r\nhis mind the sound maxims of the law of nature, the best and most\r\nauthentic foundation of human laws; if, lastly, he has contemplated\r\nthose maxims reduced to a practical system in the laws of imperial\r\nRome; if he has done this or any part of it, (though all may be easily\r\ndone under as able instructors as ever graced any seats of learning) a\r\nstudent thus qualified may enter upon the study of the law with\r\nincredible advantage and reputation. And if, at the conclusion, or\r\nduring the acquisition of these accomplishments, he will afford\r\nhimself here a year or two's farther leisure, to lay the foundation of\r\nhis future labours in a solid scientifical method, without thirsting\r\ntoo early to attend that practice which it is impossible he should\r\nrightly comprehend, he will afterwards proceed with the greatest ease,\r\nand will unfold the most intricate points with an intuitive rapidity\r\nand clearness.\r\n\r\nI SHALL not insist upon such motives as might be drawn from principles\r\nof oeconomy, and are applicable to particulars only: I reason upon\r\nmore general topics. And therefore to the qualities of the head, which\r\nI have just enumerated, I cannot but add those of the heart;\r\naffectionate loyalty to the king, a zeal for liberty and the\r\nconstitution, a sense of real honour, and well grounded principles of\r\nreligion; as necessary to form a truly valuable English lawyer, a\r\nHyde, a Hale, or a Talbot. And, whatever the ignorance of some, or\r\nunkindness of others, may have heretofore untruly suggested,\r\nexperience will warrant us to affirm, that these endowments of loyalty\r\nand public spirit, of honour and religion, are no where to be found in\r\nmore high perfection than in the two universities of this kingdom.\r\n\r\nBEFORE I conclude, it may perhaps be expected, that I lay before you a\r\nshort and general account of the method I propose to follow, in\r\nendeavouring to execute the trust you have been pleased to repose in\r\nmy hands. And in these solemn lectures, which are ordained to be read\r\nat the entrance of every term, (more perhaps to do public honour to\r\nthis laudable institution, than for the private instruction of\r\nindividuals[p]) I presume it will best answer the intent of our\r\nbenefactor and the expectation of this learned body, if I attempt to\r\nillustrate at times such detached titles of the law, as are the most\r\neasy to be understood, and most capable of historical or critical\r\nornament. But in reading the complete course, which is annually\r\nconsigned to my care, a more regular method will be necessary; and,\r\ntill a better is proposed, I shall take the liberty to follow the\r\nsame that I have already submitted to the public[q]. To fill up and\r\nfinish that outline with propriety and correctness, and to render the\r\nwhole intelligible to the uninformed minds of beginners, (whom we are\r\ntoo apt to suppose acquainted with terms and ideas, which they never\r\nhad opportunity to learn) this must be my ardent endeavour, though by\r\nno means my promise to accomplish. You will permit me however very\r\nbriefly to describe, rather what I conceive an academical expounder of\r\nthe laws should do, than what I have ever known to be done.\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: See Lowth's _Oratio Crewiana_, p. 365.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: The Analysis of the laws of England, first published,\r\n_A.D._ 1756, and exhibiting the order and principal divisions of the\r\nensuing COMMENTARIES; which were originally submitted to the\r\nuniversity in a private course of lectures, _A.D._ 1753.]\r\n\r\nHE should consider his course as a general map of the law, marking out\r\nthe shape of the country, it's connexions and boundaries, it's greater\r\ndivisions and principal cities: it is not his business to describe\r\nminutely the subordinate limits, or to fix the longitude and latitude\r\nof every inconsiderable hamlet. His attention should be engaged, like\r\nthat of the readers in Fortescue's inns of chancery, \"in tracing out\r\nthe originals and as it were the elements of the law.\" For if, as\r\nJustinian[r] has observed, the tender understanding of the student be\r\nloaded at the first with a multitude and variety of matter, it will\r\neither occasion him to desert his studies, or will carry him heavily\r\nthrough them, with much labour, delay, and despondence. These\r\noriginals should be traced to their fountains, as well as our distance\r\nwill permit; to the customs of the Britons and Germans, as recorded by\r\nCaesar and Tacitus; to the codes of the northern nations on the\r\ncontinent, and more especially to those of our own Saxon princes; to\r\nthe rules of the Roman law, either left here in the days of Papinian,\r\nor imported by Vacarius and his followers; but, above all, to that\r\ninexhaustible reservoir of legal antiquities and learning, the feodal\r\nlaw, or, as Spelman[s] has entitled it, the law of nations in our\r\nwestern orb. These primary rules and fundamental principles should be\r\nweighed and compared with the precepts of the law of nature, and the\r\npractice of other countries; should be explained by reasons,\r\nillustrated by examples, and confirmed by undoubted authorities; their\r\nhistory should be deduced, their changes and revolutions observed, and\r\nit should be shewn how far they are connected with, or have at any\r\ntime been affected by, the civil transactions of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: _Incipientibus nobis exponere jura populi Romani, ita\r\nvidentur tradi posse commodissime, si primo levi ac simplici via\r\nsingula tradantur: Alioqui, si statim ab initio rudem adhuc & infirmum\r\nanimum studiosi multitudine ac varietate rerum oneravimus, duorum\r\nalterum, aut desertorem studiorum efficiemus, aut cum magno labore,\r\nsaepe etiam cum diffidentia (quae plerumque juvenes avertit) serius ad\r\nid perducemus, ad quod leviore via ductus, sine magno labore & sine\r\nulla diffidentia maturius perduci potuisset._ _Inst._ 1. 1. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: Of Parliaments. 57.]\r\n\r\nA PLAN of this nature, if executed with care and ability, cannot fail\r\nof administring a most useful and rational entertainment to students\r\nof all ranks and professions; and yet it must be confessed that the\r\nstudy of the laws is not merely a matter of amusement: for as a very\r\njudicious writer[t] has observed upon a similar occasion, the learner\r\n\"will be considerably disappointed if he looks for entertainment\r\nwithout the expence of attention.\" An attention, however, not greater\r\nthan is usually bestowed in mastering the rudiments of other sciences,\r\nor sometimes in pursuing a favorite recreation or exercise. And this\r\nattention is not equally necessary to be exerted by every student upon\r\nevery occasion. Some branches of the law, as the formal process of\r\ncivil suits, and the subtile distinctions incident to landed property,\r\nwhich are the most difficult to be thoroughly understood, are the\r\nleast worth the pains of understanding, except to such gentlemen as\r\nintend to pursue the profession. To others I may venture to apply,\r\nwith a slight alteration, the words of sir John Fortescue[u], when\r\nfirst his royal pupil determines to engage in this study. \"It will not\r\nbe necessary for a gentleman, as such, to examine with a close\r\napplication the critical niceties of the law. It will fully be\r\nsufficient, and he may well enough be denominated a lawyer, if under\r\nthe instruction of a master he traces up the principles and grounds of\r\nthe law, even to their original elements. Therefore in a very short\r\nperiod, and with very little labour, he may be sufficiently informed\r\nin the laws of his country, if he will but apply his mind in good\r\nearnest to receive and apprehend them. For, though such knowlege as is\r\nnecessary for a judge is hardly to be acquired by the lucubrations of\r\ntwenty years, yet with a genius of tolerable perspicacity, that\r\nknowlege which is fit for a person of birth or condition may be\r\nlearned in a single year, without neglecting his other improvements.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: Dr Taylor's preface to Elem. of civil law.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: _Tibi, princeps, necesse non erit mysteria legis Angliae\r\nlongo disciplinatu rimare. Sufficiet tibi,--_et fatis _denominari\r\nlegista mereberis, si legum principia & causas, usque ad elementa,\r\ndiscipuli more indagaveris.--Quare tu, princeps serenissime, parvo\r\ntempore, parva industria, sufficienter eris in legibus regni Angliae\r\neruditus, dummodo ad ejus apprehensionem tu conferas animum\r\ntuum.--Nosco namque ingenii tui perspicacitatem, quo audacter\r\npronuntio quod in legibus illis (licet earum peritia, qualis judicibus\r\nnecessaria est, vix viginti annorum lucubrationibus acquiratur) tu\r\ndoctrinam principi congruam in anno uno sufficienter nancisceris; nec\r\ninterim militarem disciplinam, ad quam tam ardenter anhelas, negliges;\r\nsed ea, recreationis loco, etiam anno illo tu ad libitum perfrueris._\r\n_c._ 8.]\r\n\r\nTO the few therefore (the very few, I am persuaded,) that entertain\r\nsuch unworthy notions of an university, as to suppose it intended for\r\nmere dissipation of thought; to such as mean only to while away the\r\naukward interval from childhood to twenty one, between the restraints\r\nof the school and the licentiousness of politer life, in a calm middle\r\nstate of mental and of moral inactivity; to these Mr Viner gives no\r\ninvitation to an entertainment which they never can relish. But to the\r\nlong and illustrious train of noble and ingenuous youth, who are not\r\nmore distinguished among us by their birth and possessions, than by\r\nthe regularity of their conduct and their thirst after useful\r\nknowlege, to these our benefactor has consecrated the fruits of a long\r\nand laborious life, worn out in the duties of his calling; and will\r\njoyfully reflect (if such reflexions can be now the employment of his\r\nthoughts) that he could not more effectually have benefited posterity,\r\nor contributed to the service of the public, than by founding an\r\ninstitution which may instruct the rising generation in the wisdom of\r\nour civil polity, and inform them with a desire to be still better\r\nacquainted with the laws and constitution of their country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION THE SECOND.\r\n\r\nOF THE NATURE OF LAWS IN GENERAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW, in it's most general and comprehensive sense, signifies a rule of\r\naction; and is applied indiscriminately to all kinds of action,\r\nwhether animate, or inanimate, rational or irrational. Thus we say,\r\nthe laws of motion, of gravitation, of optics, or mechanics, as well\r\nas the laws of nature and of nations. And it is that rule of action,\r\nwhich is prescribed by some superior, and which the inferior is bound\r\nto obey.\r\n\r\nTHUS when the supreme being formed the universe, and created matter\r\nout of nothing, he impressed certain principles upon that matter, from\r\nwhich it can never depart, and without which it would cease to be.\r\nWhen he put that matter into motion, he established certain laws of\r\nmotion, to which all moveable bodies must conform. And, to descend\r\nfrom the greatest operations to the smallest, when a workman forms a\r\nclock, or other piece of mechanism, he establishes at his own pleasure\r\ncertain arbitrary laws for it's direction; as that the hand shall\r\ndescribe a given space in a given time; to which law as long as the\r\nwork conforms, so long it continues in perfection, and answers the end\r\nof it's formation.\r\n\r\nIF we farther advance, from mere inactive matter to vegetable and\r\nanimal life, we shall find them still governed by laws; more numerous\r\nindeed, but equally fixed and invariable. The whole progres of plants,\r\nfrom the seed to the root, and from thence to the seed again;--the\r\nmethod of animal nutrition, digestion, secretion, and all other\r\nbranches of vital oeconomy;--are not left to chance, or the will of\r\nthe creature itself, but are performed in a wondrous involuntary\r\nmanner, and guided by unerring rules laid down by the great creator.\r\n\r\nTHIS then is the general signification of law, a rule of action\r\ndictated by some superior being; and in those creatures that have\r\nneither the power to think, nor to will, such laws must be invariably\r\nobeyed, so long as the creature itself subsists, for it's existence\r\ndepends on that obedience. But laws, in their more confined sense, and\r\nin which it is our present business to consider them, denote the\r\nrules, not of action in general, but of _human_ action or conduct:\r\nthat is, the precepts by which man, the noblest of all sublunary\r\nbeings, a creature endowed with both reason and freewill, is commanded\r\nto make use of those faculties in the general regulation of his\r\nbehaviour.\r\n\r\nMAN, considered as a creature, must necessarily be subject to the laws\r\nof his creator, for he is entirely a dependent being. A being,\r\nindependent of any other, has no rule to pursue, but such as he\r\nprescribes to himself; but a state of dependance will inevitably\r\noblige the inferior to take the will of him, on whom he depends, as\r\nthe rule of his conduct: not indeed in every particular, but in all\r\nthose points wherein his dependance consists. This principle therefore\r\nhas more or less extent and effect, in proportion as the superiority\r\nof the one and the dependance of the other is greater or less,\r\nabsolute or limited. And consequently as man depends absolutely upon\r\nhis maker for every thing, it is necessary that he should in all\r\npoints conform to his maker's will.\r\n\r\nTHIS will of his maker is called the law of nature. For as God, when\r\nhe created matter, and endued it with a principle of mobility,\r\nestablished certain rules for the perpetual direction of that motion;\r\nso, when he created man, and endued him with freewill to conduct\r\nhimself in all parts of life, he laid down certain immutable laws of\r\nhuman nature, whereby that freewill is in some degree regulated and\r\nrestrained, and gave him also the faculty of reason to discover the\r\npurport of those laws.\r\n\r\nCONSIDERING the creator only as a being of infinite _power_, he was\r\nable unquestionably to have prescribed whatever laws he pleased to his\r\ncreature, man, however unjust or severe. But as he is also a being of\r\ninfinite _wisdom_, he has laid down only such laws as were founded in\r\nthose relations of justice, that existed in the nature of things\r\nantecedent to any positive precept. These are the eternal, immutable\r\nlaws of good and evil, to which the creator himself in all his\r\ndispensations conforms; and which he has enabled human reason to\r\ndiscover, so far as they are necessary for the conduct of human\r\nactions. Such among others are these principles: that we should live\r\nhonestly, should hurt nobody, and should render to every one it's due;\r\nto which three general precepts Justinian[a] has reduced the whole\r\ndoctrine of law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: _Juris praecepta sunt haec, honeste vivere, alterum non\r\nlaedere, suum cuique tribuere._ _Inst._ 1. 1. 3.]\r\n\r\nBUT if the discovery of these first principles of the law of nature\r\ndepended only upon the due exertion of right reason, and could not\r\notherwise be attained than by a chain of metaphysical disquisitions,\r\nmankind would have wanted some inducement to have quickened their\r\ninquiries, and the greater part of the world would have rested content\r\nin mental indolence, and ignorance it's inseparable companion. As\r\ntherefore the creator is a being, not only of infinite _power_, and\r\n_wisdom_, but also of infinite _goodness_, he has been pleased so to\r\ncontrive the constitution and frame of humanity, that we should want\r\nno other prompter to enquire after and pursue the rule of right, but\r\nonly our own self-love, that universal principle of action. For he has\r\nso intimately connected, so inseparably interwoven the laws of eternal\r\njustice with the happiness of each individual, that the latter cannot\r\nbe attained but by observing the former; and, if the former be\r\npunctually obeyed, it cannot but induce the latter. In consequence of\r\nwhich mutual connection of justice and human felicity, he has not\r\nperplexed the law of nature with a multitude of abstracted rules and\r\nprecepts, referring merely to the fitness or unfitness of things, as\r\nsome have vainly surmised; but has graciously reduced the rule of\r\nobedience to this one paternal precept, \"that man should pursue his\r\nown happiness.\" This is the foundation of what we call ethics, or\r\nnatural law. For the several articles into which it is branched in our\r\nsystems, amount to no more than demonstrating, that this or that\r\naction tends to man's real happiness, and therefore very justly\r\nconcluding that the performance of it is a part of the law of nature;\r\nor, on the other hand, that this or that action is destructive of\r\nman's real happiness, and therefore that the law of nature forbids it.\r\n\r\nTHIS law of nature, being co-eval with mankind and dictated by God\r\nhimself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is\r\nbinding over all the globe, in all countries, and at all times: no\r\nhuman laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such of them\r\nas are valid derive all their force, and all their authority,\r\nmediately or immediately, from this original.\r\n\r\nBUT in order to apply this to the particular exigencies of each\r\nindividual, it is still necessary to have recourse to reason; whose\r\noffice it is to discover, as was before observed, what the law of\r\nnature directs in every circumstance of life; by considering, what\r\nmethod will tend the most effectually to our own substantial\r\nhappiness. And if our reason were always, as in our first ancestor\r\nbefore his transgression, clear and perfect, unruffled by passions,\r\nunclouded by prejudice, unimpaired by disease or intemperance, the\r\ntask would be pleasant and easy; we should need no other guide but\r\nthis. But every man now finds the contrary in his own experience; that\r\nhis reason is corrupt, and his understanding full of ignorance and\r\nerror.\r\n\r\nTHIS has given manifold occasion for the benign interposition of\r\ndivine providence; which, in companion to the frailty, the\r\nimperfection, and the blindness of human reason, hath been pleased,\r\nat sundry times and in divers manners, to discover and enforce it's\r\nlaws by an immediate and direct revelation. The doctrines thus\r\ndelivered we call the revealed or divine law, and they are to be found\r\nonly in the holy scriptures. These precepts, when revealed, are found\r\nupon comparison to be really a part of the original law of nature, as\r\nthey tend in all their consequences to man's felicity. But we are not\r\nfrom thence to conclude that the knowlege of these truths was\r\nattainable by reason, in it's present corrupted state; since we find\r\nthat, until they were revealed, they were hid from the wisdom of ages.\r\nAs then the moral precepts of this law are indeed of the same original\r\nwith those of the law of nature, so their intrinsic obligation is of\r\nequal strength and perpetuity. Yet undoubtedly the revealed law is\r\n(humanly speaking) of infinitely more authority than what we generally\r\ncall the natural law. Because one is the law of nature, expressly\r\ndeclared so to be by God himself; the other is only what, by the\r\nassistance of human reason, we imagine to be that law. If we could be\r\nas certain of the latter as we are of the former, both would have an\r\nequal authority; but, till then, they can never be put in any\r\ncompetition together.\r\n\r\nUPON these two foundations, the law of nature and the law of\r\nrevelation, depend all human laws; that is to say, no human laws\r\nshould be suffered to contradict these. There is, it is true, a great\r\nnumber of indifferent points, in which both the divine law and the\r\nnatural leave a man at his own liberty; but which are found necessary\r\nfor the benefit of society to be restrained within certain limits. And\r\nherein it is that human laws have their greatest force and efficacy;\r\nfor, with regard to such points as are not indifferent, human laws are\r\nonly declaratory of, and act in subordination to, the former. To\r\ninstance in the case of murder: this is expressly forbidden by the\r\ndivine, and demonstrably by the natural law; and from these\r\nprohibitions arises the true unlawfulness of this crime. Those human\r\nlaws, that annex a punishment to it, do not at all increase it's moral\r\nguilt, or superadd any fresh obligation _in foro conscientiae_ to\r\nabstain from it's perpetration. Nay, if any human law should allow or\r\ninjoin us to commit it, we are bound to transgress that human law, or\r\nelse we must offend both the natural and the divine. But with regard\r\nto matters that are in themselves indifferent, and are not commanded\r\nor forbidden by those superior laws; such, for instance, as exporting\r\nof wool into foreign countries; here the inferior legislature has\r\nscope and opportunity to interpose, and to make that action unlawful\r\nwhich before was not so.\r\n\r\nIF man were to live in a state of nature, unconnected with other\r\nindividuals, there would be no occasion for any other laws, than the\r\nlaw of nature, and the law of God. Neither could any other law\r\npossibly exist; for a law always supposes some superior who is to make\r\nit; and in a state of nature we are all equal, without any other\r\nsuperior but him who is the author of our being. But man was formed\r\nfor society; and, as is demonstrated by the writers on this\r\nsubject[b], is neither capable of living alone, nor indeed has the\r\ncourage to do it. However, as it is impossible for the whole race of\r\nmankind to be united in one great society, they must necessarily\r\ndivide into many; and form separate states, commonwealths, and\r\nnations; entirely independent of each other, and yet liable to a\r\nmutual intercourse. Hence arises a third kind of law to regulate this\r\nmutual intercourse, called \"the law of nations;\" which, as none of\r\nthese states will acknowlege a superiority in the other, cannot be\r\ndictated by either; but depends entirely upon the rules of natural\r\nlaw, or upon mutual compacts, treaties, leagues, and agreements\r\nbetween these several communities: in the construction also of which\r\ncompacts we have no other rule to resort to, but the law of nature;\r\nbeing the only one to which both communities are equally subject: and\r\ntherefore the civil law[c] very justly observes, that _quod naturalis\r\nratio inter omnes homines constituit, vocatur jus gentium_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Puffendorf, _l._ 7. _c._ 1. compared with Barbeyrac's\r\ncommentary.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: _Ff._ 1. 1. 9.]\r\n\r\nTHUS much I thought it necessary to premise concerning the law of\r\nnature, the revealed law, and the law of nations, before I proceeded\r\nto treat more fully of the principal subject of this section,\r\nmunicipal or civil law; that is, the rule by which particular\r\ndistricts, communities, or nations are governed; being thus defined by\r\nJustinian[d], \"_jus civile est quod quisque sibi populus constituit_.\"\r\nI call it _municipal_ law, in compliance with common speech; for, tho'\r\nstrictly that expression denotes the particular customs of one single\r\n_municipium_ or free town, yet it may with sufficient propriety be\r\napplied to any one state or nation, which is governed by the same laws\r\nand customs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: _Inst._ 1. 2. 1.]\r\n\r\nMUNICIPAL law, thus understood, is properly defined to be \"a rule of\r\ncivil conduct prescribed by the supreme power in a state, commanding\r\nwhat is right and prohibiting what is wrong.\" Let us endeavour to\r\nexplain it's several properties, as they arise out of this definition.\r\n\r\nAND, first, it is a _rule_; not a transient sudden order from a\r\nsuperior to or concerning a particular person; but something\r\npermanent, uniform, and universal. Therefore a particular act of the\r\nlegislature to confiscate the goods of Titius, or to attaint him of\r\nhigh treason, does not enter into the idea of a municipal law: for the\r\noperation of this act is spent upon Titius only, and has no relation\r\nto the community in general; it is rather a sentence than a law. But\r\nan act to declare that the crime of which Titius is accused shall be\r\ndeemed high treason; this has permanency, uniformity, and\r\nuniversality, and therefore is properly a _rule_. It is also called a\r\n_rule_, to distinguish it from _advice_ or _counsel_, which we are at\r\nliberty to follow or not, as we see proper; and to judge upon the\r\nreasonableness or unreasonableness of the thing advised. Whereas our\r\nobedience to the _law_ depends not upon _our approbation_, but upon\r\nthe _maker's will_. Counsel is only matter of persuasion, law is\r\nmatter of injunction; counsel acts only upon the willing, law upon the\r\nunwilling also.\r\n\r\nIT is also called a _rule_, to distinguish it from a _compact_ or\r\n_agreement_; for a compact is a promise proceeding _from_ us, law is a\r\ncommand directed _to_ us. The language of a compact is, \"I will, or\r\nwill not, do this;\" that of a law is, \"thou shalt, or shalt not, do\r\nit.\" It is true there is an obligation which a compact carries with\r\nit, equal in point of conscience to that of a law; but then the\r\noriginal of the obligation is different. In compacts, we ourselves\r\ndetermine and promise what shall be done, before we are obliged to do\r\nit; in laws, we are obliged to act, without ourselves determining or\r\npromising any thing at all. Upon these accounts law is defined to be\r\n\"_a rule_.\"\r\n\r\nMUNICIPAL law is also \"a rule _of civil conduct_.\" This distinguishes\r\nmunicipal law from the natural, or revealed; the former of which is\r\nthe rule of _moral_ conduct, and the latter not only the rule of moral\r\nconduct, but also the rule of faith. These regard man as a creature,\r\nand point out his duty to God, to himself, and to his neighbour,\r\nconsidered in the light of an individual. But municipal or civil law\r\nregards him also as a citizen, and bound to other duties towards his\r\nneighbour, than those of mere nature and religion: duties, which he\r\nhas engaged in by enjoying the benefits of the common union; and which\r\namount to no more, than that he do contribute, on his part, to the\r\nsubsistence and peace of the society.\r\n\r\nIT is likewise \"a rule _prescribed_.\" Because a bare resolution,\r\nconfined in the breast of the legislator, without manifesting itself\r\nby some external sign, can never be properly a law. It is requisite\r\nthat this resolution be notified to the people who are to obey it. But\r\nthe manner in which this notification is to be made, is matter of very\r\ngreat indifference. It may be notified by universal tradition and long\r\npractice, which supposes a previous publication, and is the case of\r\nthe common law of England. It may be notified, _viva voce_, by\r\nofficers appointed for that purpose, as is done with regard to\r\nproclamations, and such acts of parliament as are appointed to be\r\npublicly read in churches and other assemblies. It may lastly be\r\nnotified by writing, printing, or the like; which is the general\r\ncourse taken with all our acts of parliament. Yet, whatever way is\r\nmade use of, it is incumbent on the promulgators to do it in the most\r\npublic and perspicuous manner; not like Caligula, who (according to\r\nDio Cassius) wrote his laws in a very small character, and hung them\r\nup upon high pillars, the more effectually to ensnare the people.\r\nThere is still a more unreasonable method than this, which is called\r\nmaking of laws _ex post facto_; when _after_ an action is committed,\r\nthe legislator then for the first time declares it to have been a\r\ncrime, and inflicts a punishment upon the person who has committed it;\r\nhere it is impossible that the party could foresee that an action,\r\ninnocent when it was done, should be afterwards converted to guilt by\r\na subsequent law; he had therefore no cause to abstain from it; and\r\nall punishment for not abstaining must of consequence be cruel and\r\nunjust[e]. All laws should be therefore made to commence _in futuro_,\r\nand be notified before their commencement; which is implied in the\r\nterm \"_prescribed_.\" But when this rule is in the usual manner\r\nnotified, or prescribed, it is then the subject's business to be\r\nthoroughly acquainted therewith; for if ignorance, of what he _might_\r\nknow, were admitted as a legitimate excuse, the laws would be of no\r\neffect, but might always be eluded with impunity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Such laws among the Romans were denominated _privilegia_,\r\nor private laws, of which Cicero _de leg._ 3. 19. and in his oration\r\n_pro domo_, 17. thus speaks; \"_Vetant leges sacratae, vetant duodecim\r\ntabulae, leges privatis hominibus irrogari; id enim est privilegium.\r\nNemo unquam tulit, nihil est crudelius, nihil perniciosius, nihil quod\r\nminus haec civitas ferre possit_.\"]\r\n\r\nBUT farther: municipal law is \"a rule of civil conduct prescribed _by\r\nthe supreme power in a state_.\" For legislature, as was before\r\nobserved, is the greatest act of superiority that can be exercised by\r\none being over another. Wherefore it is requisite to the very essence\r\nof a law, that it be made by the supreme power. Sovereignty and\r\nlegislature are indeed convertible terms; one cannot subsist without\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nTHIS will naturally lead us into a short enquiry concerning the nature\r\nof society and civil government; and the natural, inherent right that\r\nbelongs to the sovereignty of a state, wherever that sovereignty be\r\nlodged, of making and enforcing laws.\r\n\r\nTHE only true and natural foundations of society are the wants and the\r\nfears of individuals. Not that we can believe, with some theoretical\r\nwriters, that there ever was a time when there was no such thing as\r\nsociety; and that, from the impulse of reason, and through a sense of\r\ntheir wants and weaknesses, individuals met together in a large plain,\r\nentered into an original contract, and chose the tallest man present\r\nto be their governor. This notion, of an actually existing unconnected\r\nstate of nature, is too wild to be seriously admitted; and besides it\r\nis plainly contradictory to the revealed accounts of the primitive\r\norigin of mankind, and their preservation two thousand years\r\nafterwards; both which were effected by the means of single families.\r\nThese formed the first society, among themselves; which every day\r\nextended it's limits, and when it grew too large to subsist with\r\nconvenience in that pastoral state, wherein the patriarchs appear to\r\nhave lived, it necessarily subdivided itself by various migrations\r\ninto more. Afterwards, as agriculture increased, which employs and can\r\nmaintain a much greater number of hands, migrations became less\r\nfrequent; and various tribes, which had formerly separated, re-united\r\nagain; sometimes by compulsion and conquest, sometimes by accident,\r\nand sometimes perhaps by compact. But though society had not it's\r\nformal beginning from any convention of individuals, actuated by their\r\nwants and their fears; yet it is the _sense_ of their weakness and\r\nimperfection that _keeps_ mankind together; that demonstrates the\r\nnecessity of this union; and that therefore is the solid and natural\r\nfoundation, as well as the cement, of society. And this is what we\r\nmean by the original contract of society; which, though perhaps in no\r\ninstance it has ever been formally expressed at the first institution\r\nof a state, yet in nature and reason must always be understood and\r\nimplied, in the very act of associating together: namely, that the\r\nwhole should protect all it's parts, and that every part should pay\r\nobedience to the will of the whole; or, in other words, that the\r\ncommunity should guard the rights of each individual member, and that\r\n(in return for this protection) each individual should submit to the\r\nlaws of the community; without which submission of all it was\r\nimpossible that protection could be certainly extended to any.\r\n\r\nFOR when society is once formed, government results of course, as\r\nnecessary to preserve and to keep that society in order. Unless some\r\nsuperior were constituted, whose commands and decisions all the\r\nmembers are bound to obey, they would still remain as in a state of\r\nnature, without any judge upon earth to define their several rights,\r\nand redress their several wrongs. But, as all the members of society\r\nare naturally equal, it may be asked, in whose hands are the reins of\r\ngovernment to be entrusted? To this the general answer is easy; but\r\nthe application of it to particular cases has occasioned one half of\r\nthose mischiefs which are apt to proceed from misguided political\r\nzeal. In general, all mankind will agree that government should be\r\nreposed in such persons, in whom those qualities are most likely to be\r\nfound, the perfection of which are among the attributes of him who is\r\nemphatically stiled the supreme being; the three grand requisites, I\r\nmean, of wisdom, of goodness, and of power: wisdom, to discern the\r\nreal interest of the community; goodness, to endeavour always to\r\npursue that real interest; and strength, or power, to carry this\r\nknowlege and intention into action. These are the natural foundations\r\nof sovereignty, and these are the requisites that ought to be found in\r\nevery well constituted frame of government.\r\n\r\nHOW the several forms of government we now see in the world at first\r\nactually began, is matter of great uncertainty, and has occasioned\r\ninfinite disputes. It is not my business or intention to enter into\r\nany of them. However they began, or by what right soever they\r\nsubsist, there is and must be in all of them a supreme, irresistible,\r\nabsolute, uncontrolled authority, in which the _jura summi imperii_,\r\nor the rights of sovereignty, reside. And this authority is placed in\r\nthose hands, wherein (according to the opinion of the founders of such\r\nrespective states, either expressly given, or collected from their\r\ntacit approbation) the qualities requisite for supremacy, wisdom,\r\ngoodness, and power, are the most likely to be found.\r\n\r\nTHE political writers of antiquity will not allow more than three\r\nregular forms of government; the first, when the sovereign power is\r\nlodged in an aggregate assembly consisting of all the members of a\r\ncommunity, which is called a democracy; the second, when it is lodged\r\nin a council, composed of select members, and then it is stiled an\r\naristocracy; the last, when it is entrusted in the hands of a single\r\nperson, and then it takes the name of a monarchy. All other species of\r\ngovernment, they say, are either corruptions of, or reducible to,\r\nthese three.\r\n\r\nBY the sovereign power, as was before observed, is meant the making of\r\nlaws; for wherever that power resides, all others must conform to, and\r\nbe directed by it, whatever appearance the outward form and\r\nadministration of the government may put on. For it is at any time in\r\nthe option of the legislature to alter that form and administration by\r\na new edict or rule, and to put the execution of the laws into\r\nwhatever hands it pleases: and all the other powers of the state must\r\nobey the legislative power in the execution of their several\r\nfunctions, or else the constitution is at an end.\r\n\r\nIN a democracy, where the right of making laws resides in the people\r\nat large, public virtue, or goodness of intention, is more likely to\r\nbe found, than either of the other qualities of government. Popular\r\nassemblies are frequently foolish in their contrivance, and weak in\r\ntheir execution; but generally mean to do the thing that is right and\r\njust, and have always a degree of patriotism or public spirit. In\r\naristocracies there is more wisdom to be found, than in the other\r\nframes of government; being composed, or intended to be composed, of\r\nthe most experienced citizens; but there is less honesty than in a\r\nrepublic, and less strength than in a monarchy. A monarchy is indeed\r\nthe most powerful of any, all the sinews of government being knit\r\ntogether, and united in the hand of the prince; but then there is\r\nimminent danger of his employing that strength to improvident or\r\noppressive purposes.\r\n\r\nTHUS these three species of government have, all of them, their\r\nseveral perfections and imperfections. Democracies are usually the\r\nbest calculated to direct the end of a law; aristocracies to invent\r\nthe means by which that end shall be obtained; and monarchies to carry\r\nthose means into execution. And the antients, as was observed, had in\r\ngeneral no idea of any other permanent form of government but these\r\nthree; for though Cicero[f] declares himself of opinion, \"_esse optime\r\nconstitutam rempublicam, quae ex tribus generibus illis, regali,\r\noptimo, et populari, sit modice confusa_;\" yet Tacitus treats this\r\nnotion of a mixed government, formed out of them all, and partaking of\r\nthe advantages of each, as a visionary whim; and one that, if\r\neffected, could never be lasting or secure[g].\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: In his fragments _de rep._ _l._ 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: \"_Cunctas nationes et urbes populus, aut primores, aut\r\nsinguli regunt: delecta ex his, et constituta reipublicae forma\r\nlaudari facilius quam evenire, vel, si evenit, haud diuturna esse\r\npotest._\" _Ann._ _l._ 4.]\r\n\r\nBUT happily for us of this island, the British constitution has long\r\nremained, and I trust will long continue, a standing exception to the\r\ntruth of this observation. For, as with us the executive power of the\r\nlaws is lodged in a single person, they have all the advantages of\r\nstrength and dispatch, that are to be found in the most absolute\r\nmonarchy; and, as the legislature of the kingdom is entrusted to three\r\ndistinct powers, entirely independent of each other; first, the king;\r\nsecondly, the lords spiritual and temporal, which is an aristocratical\r\nassembly of persons selected for their piety, their birth, their\r\nwisdom, their valour, or their property; and, thirdly, the house of\r\ncommons, freely chosen by the people from among themselves, which\r\nmakes it a kind of democracy; as this aggregate body, actuated by\r\ndifferent springs, and attentive to different interests, composes the\r\nBritish parliament, and has the supreme disposal of every thing; there\r\ncan no inconvenience be attempted by either of the three branches, but\r\nwill be withstood by one of the other two; each branch being armed\r\nwith a negative power, sufficient to repel any innovation which it\r\nshall think inexpedient or dangerous.\r\n\r\nHERE then is lodged the sovereignty of the British constitution; and\r\nlodged as beneficially as is possible for society. For in no other\r\nshape could we be so certain of finding the three great qualities of\r\ngovernment so well and so happily united. If the supreme power were\r\nlodged in any one of the three branches separately, we must be exposed\r\nto the inconveniences of either absolute monarchy, aristocracy, or\r\ndemocracy; and so want two of the three principal ingredients of good\r\npolity, either virtue, wisdom, or power. If it were lodged in any two\r\nof the branches; for instance, in the king and house of lords, our\r\nlaws might be providently made, and well executed, but they might not\r\nalways have the good of the people in view: if lodged in the king and\r\ncommons, we should want that circumspection and mediatory caution,\r\nwhich the wisdom of the peers is to afford: if the supreme rights of\r\nlegislature were lodged in the two houses only, and the king had no\r\nnegative upon their proceedings, they might be tempted to encroach\r\nupon the royal prerogative, or perhaps to abolish the kingly office,\r\nand thereby weaken (if not totally destroy) the strength of the\r\nexecutive power. But the constitutional government of this island is\r\nso admirably tempered and compounded, that nothing can endanger or\r\nhurt it, but destroying the equilibrium of power between one branch of\r\nthe legislature and the rest. For if ever it should happen that the\r\nindependence of any one of the three should be lost, or that it should\r\nbecome subservient to the views of either of the other two, there\r\nwould soon be an end of our constitution. The legislature would be\r\nchanged from that, which was originally set up by the general consent\r\nand fundamental act of the society; and such a change, however\r\neffected, is according to Mr Locke[h] (who perhaps carries his theory\r\ntoo far) at once an entire dissolution of the bands of government; and\r\nthe people would be reduced to a state of anarchy, with liberty to\r\nconstitute to themselves a new legislative power.\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: On government, part 2. §. 212.]\r\n\r\nHAVING thus cursorily considered the three usual species of\r\ngovernment, and our own singular constitution, selected and compounded\r\nfrom them all, I proceed to observe, that, as the power of making laws\r\nconstitutes the supreme authority, so wherever the supreme authority\r\nin any state resides, it is the right of that authority to make laws;\r\nthat is, in the words of our definition, _to prescribe the rule of\r\ncivil action_. And this may be discovered from the very end and\r\ninstitution of civil states. For a state is a collective body,\r\ncomposed of a multitude of individuals, united for their safety and\r\nconvenience, and intending to act together as one man. If it therefore\r\nis to act as one man, it ought to act by one uniform will. But,\r\ninasmuch as political communities are made up of many natural persons,\r\neach of whom has his particular will and inclination, these several\r\nwills cannot by any _natural_ union be joined together, or tempered\r\nand disposed into a lasting harmony, so as to constitute and produce\r\nthat one uniform will of the whole. It can therefore be no otherwise\r\nproduced than by a _political_ union; by the consent of all persons to\r\nsubmit their own private wills to the will of one man, or of one or\r\nmore assemblies of men, to whom the supreme authority is entrusted:\r\nand this will of that one man, or assemblage of men, is in different\r\nstates, according to their different constitutions, understood to be\r\n_law_.\r\n\r\nTHUS far as to the _right_ of the supreme power to make laws; but\r\nfarther, it is it's _duty_ likewise. For since the respective members\r\nare bound to conform themselves to the will of the state, it is\r\nexpedient that they receive directions from the state declaratory of\r\nthat it's will. But since it is impossible, in so great a multitude,\r\nto give injunctions to every particular man, relative to each\r\nparticular action, therefore the state establishes general rules, for\r\nthe perpetual information and direction of all persons in all points,\r\nwhether of positive or negative duty. And this, in order that every\r\nman may know what to look upon as his own, what as another's; what\r\nabsolute and what relative duties are required at his hands; what is\r\nto be esteemed honest, dishonest, or indifferent; what degree every\r\nman retains of his natural liberty; what he has given up as the price\r\nof the benefits of society; and after what manner each person is to\r\nmoderate the use and exercise of those rights which the state assigns\r\nhim, in order to promote and secure the public tranquillity.\r\n\r\nFROM what has been advanced, the truth of the former branch of our\r\ndefinition, is (I trust) sufficiently evident; that \"_municipal law is\r\na rule of civil conduct prescribed by the supreme power in a state_.\"\r\nI proceed now to the latter branch of it; that it is a rule so\r\nprescribed, \"_commanding what is right, and prohibiting what is\r\nwrong_.\"\r\n\r\nNOW in order to do this completely, it is first of all necessary that\r\nthe boundaries of right and wrong be established and ascertained by\r\nlaw. And when this is once done, it will follow of course that it is\r\nlikewise the business of the law, considered as a rule of civil\r\nconduct, to enforce these rights and to restrain or redress these\r\nwrongs. It remains therefore only to consider in what manner the law\r\nis said to ascertain the boundaries of right and wrong; and the\r\nmethods which it takes to command the one and prohibit the other.\r\n\r\nFOR this purpose every law may be said to consist of several parts:\r\none, _declaratory_; whereby the rights to be observed, and the wrongs\r\nto be eschewed, are clearly defined and laid down: another,\r\n_directory_, whereby the subject is instructed and enjoined to observe\r\nthose rights, and to abstain from the commission of those wrongs: a\r\nthird, _remedial_; whereby a method is pointed out to recover a man's\r\nprivate rights, or redress his private wrongs: to which may be added a\r\nfourth, usually termed the _sanction_, or _vindicatory_ branch of the\r\nlaw; whereby it is signified what evil or penalty shall be incurred by\r\nsuch as commit any public wrongs, and transgress or neglect their\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nWITH regard to the first of these, the _declaratory_ part of the\r\nmunicipal law, this depends not so much upon the law of revelation or\r\nof nature, as upon the wisdom and will of the legislator. This\r\ndoctrine, which before was slightly touched, deserves a more\r\nparticular explication. Those rights then which God and nature have\r\nestablished, and are therefore called natural rights, such as are life\r\nand liberty, need not the aid of human laws to be more effectually\r\ninvested in every man than they are; neither do they receive any\r\nadditional strength when declared by the municipal laws to be\r\ninviolable. On the contrary, no human legislature has power to abridge\r\nor destroy them, unless the owner shall himself commit some act that\r\namounts to a forfeiture. Neither do divine or natural _duties_ (such\r\nas, for instance, the worship of God, the maintenance of children, and\r\nthe like) receive any stronger sanction from being also declared to be\r\nduties by the law of the land. The case is the same as to crimes and\r\nmisdemesnors, that are forbidden by the superior laws, and therefore\r\nstiled _mala in se_, such as murder, theft, and perjury; which\r\ncontract no additional turpitude from being declared unlawful by the\r\ninferior legislature. For that legislature in all these cases acts\r\nonly, as was before observed, in subordination to the great lawgiver,\r\ntranscribing and publishing his precepts. So that, upon the whole, the\r\ndeclaratory part of the municipal law has no force or operation at\r\nall, with regard to actions that are naturally and intrinsically right\r\nor wrong.\r\n\r\nBUT with regard to things in themselves indifferent, the case is\r\nentirely altered. These become either right or wrong, just or unjust,\r\nduties or misdemesnors, according as the municipal legislator sees\r\nproper, for promoting the welfare of the society, and more effectually\r\ncarrying on the purposes of civil life. Thus our own common law has\r\ndeclared, that the goods of the wife do instantly upon marriage become\r\nthe property and right of the husband; and our statute law has\r\ndeclared all monopolies a public offence: yet that right, and this\r\noffence, have no foundation in nature; but are merely created by the\r\nlaw, for the purposes of civil society. And sometimes, where the thing\r\nitself has it's rise from the law of nature, the particular\r\ncircumstances and mode of doing it become right or wrong, as the laws\r\nof the land shall direct. Thus, for instance, in civil duties;\r\nobedience to superiors is the doctrine of revealed as well as natural\r\nreligion: but who those superiors shall be, and in what circumstances,\r\nor to what degrees they shall be obeyed, is the province of human laws\r\nto determine. And so, as to injuries or crimes, it must be left to our\r\nown legislature to decide, in what cases the seising another's cattle\r\nshall amount to the crime of robbery; and where it shall be a\r\njustifiable action, as when a landlord takes them by way of distress\r\nfor rent.\r\n\r\nTHUS much for the _declaratory_ part of the municipal law: and the\r\n_directory_ stands much upon the same footing; for this virtually\r\nincludes the former, the declaration being usually collected from the\r\ndirection. The law that says, \"thou shalt not steal,\" implies a\r\ndeclaration that stealing is a crime. And we have seen that, in things\r\nnaturally indifferent, the very essence of right and wrong depends\r\nupon the direction of the laws to do or to omit it.\r\n\r\nTHE _remedial_ part of a law is so necessary a consequence of the\r\nformer two, that laws must be very vague and imperfect without it. For\r\nin vain would rights be declared, in vain directed to be observed, if\r\nthere were no method of recovering and asserting those rights, when\r\nwrongfully withheld or invaded. This is what we mean properly, when we\r\nspeak of the protection of the law. When, for instance, the\r\n_declaratory_ part of the law has said \"that the field or inheritance,\r\nwhich belonged to Titius's father, is vested by his death in Titius;\"\r\nand the _directory_ part has \"forbidden any one to enter on another's\r\nproperty without the leave of the owner;\" if Gaius after this will\r\npresume to take possession of the land, the _remedial_ part of the law\r\nwill then interpose it's office; will make Gaius restore the\r\npossession to Titius, and also pay him damages for the invasion.\r\n\r\nWITH regard to the _sanction_ of laws, or the evil that may attend the\r\nbreach of public duties; it is observed, that human legislators have\r\nfor the most part chosen to make the sanction of their laws rather\r\n_vindicatory_ than _remuneratory_, or to consist rather in\r\npunishments, than in actual particular rewards. Because, in the first\r\nplace, the quiet enjoyment and protection of all our civil rights and\r\nliberties, which are the sure and general consequence of obedience to\r\nthe municipal law, are in themselves the best and most valuable of all\r\nrewards. Because also, were the exercise of every virtue to be\r\nenforced by the proposal of particular rewards, it were impossible for\r\nany state to furnish stock enough for so profuse a bounty. And\r\nfarther, because the dread of evil is a much more forcible principle\r\nof human actions than the prospect of good[i]. For which reasons,\r\nthough a prudent bestowing of rewards is sometimes of exquisite use,\r\nyet we find that those civil laws, which enforce and enjoin our duty,\r\ndo seldom, if ever, propose any privilege or gift to such as obey the\r\nlaw; but do constantly come armed with a penalty denounced against\r\ntransgressors, either expressly defining the nature and quantity of\r\nthe punishment, or else leaving it to the discretion of the judges,\r\nand those who are entrusted with the care of putting the laws in\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: Locke, Hum. Und. b. 2. c. 21.]\r\n\r\nOF all the parts of a law the most effectual is the _vindicatory_. For\r\nit is but lost labour to say, \"do this, or avoid that,\" unless we also\r\ndeclare, \"this shall be the consequence of your noncompliance.\" We\r\nmust therefore observe, that the main strength and force of a law\r\nconsists in the penalty annexed to it. Herein is to be found the\r\nprincipal obligation of human laws.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATORS and their laws are said to _compel_ and _oblige_; not that\r\nby any natural violence they so constrain a man, as to render it\r\nimpossible for him to act otherwise than as they direct, which is the\r\nstrict sense of obligation: but because, by declaring and exhibiting a\r\npenalty against offenders, they bring it to pass that no man can\r\neasily choose to transgress the law; since, by reason of the impending\r\ncorrection, compliance is in a high degree preferable to disobedience.\r\nAnd, even where rewards are proposed as well as punishments\r\nthreatened, the obligation of the law seems chiefly to consist in the\r\npenalty: for rewards, in their nature, can only _persuade_ and\r\n_allure_; nothing is _compulsory_ but punishment.\r\n\r\nIT is held, it is true, and very justly, by the principal of our\r\nethical writers, that human laws are binding upon mens consciences.\r\nBut if that were the only, or most forcible obligation, the good only\r\nwould regard the laws, and the bad would set them at defiance. And,\r\ntrue as this principle is, it must still be understood with some\r\nrestriction. It holds, I apprehend, as to _rights_; and that, when the\r\nlaw has determined the field to belong to Titius, it is matter of\r\nconscience no longer to withhold or to invade it. So also in regard to\r\n_natural duties_, and such offences as are _mala in se_: here we are\r\nbound in conscience, because we are bound by superior laws, before\r\nthose human laws were in being, to perform the one and abstain from\r\nthe other. But in relation to those laws which enjoin only _positive\r\nduties_, and forbid only such things as are not _mala in se_ but _mala\r\nprohibita_ merely, annexing a penalty to noncompliance, here I\r\napprehend conscience is no farther concerned, than by directing a\r\nsubmission to the penalty, in case of our breach of those laws: for\r\notherwise the multitude of penal laws in a state would not only be\r\nlooked upon as an impolitic, but would also be a very wicked thing; if\r\nevery such law were a snare for the conscience of the subject. But in\r\nthese cases the alternative is offered to every man; \"either abstain\r\nfrom this, or submit to such a penalty;\" and his conscience will be\r\nclear, whichever side of the alternative he thinks proper to embrace.\r\nThus, by the statutes for preserving the game, a penalty is denounced\r\nagainst every unqualified person that kills a hare. Now this\r\nprohibitory law does not make the transgression a moral offence: the\r\nonly obligation in conscience is to submit to the penalty if levied.\r\n\r\nI HAVE now gone through the definition laid down of a municipal law;\r\nand have shewn that it is \"a rule--of civil conduct--prescribed--by\r\nthe supreme power in a state--commanding what is right, and\r\nprohibiting what is wrong:\" in the explication of which I have\r\nendeavoured to interweave a few useful principles, concerning the\r\nnature of civil government, and the obligation of human laws. Before I\r\nconclude this section, it may not be amiss to add a few observations\r\nconcerning the _interpretation_ of laws.\r\n\r\nWHEN any doubt arose upon the construction of the Roman laws, the\r\nusage was to state the case to the emperor in writing, and take his\r\nopinion upon it. This was certainly a bad method of interpretation. To\r\ninterrogate the legislature to decide particular disputes, is not only\r\nendless, but affords great room for partiality and oppression. The\r\nanswers of the emperor were called his rescripts, and these had in\r\nsucceeding cases the force of perpetual laws; though they ought to be\r\ncarefully distinguished, by every rational civilian, from those\r\ngeneral constitutions, which had only the nature of things for their\r\nguide. The emperor Macrinus, as his historian Capitolinus informs us,\r\nhad once resolved to abolish these rescripts, and retain only the\r\ngeneral edicts; he could not bear that the hasty and crude answers of\r\nsuch princes as Commodus and Caracalla should be reverenced as laws.\r\nBut Justinian thought otherwise[k], and he has preserved them all. In\r\nlike manner the canon laws, or decretal epistles of the popes, are all\r\nof them rescripts in the strictest sense. Contrary to all true forms\r\nof reasoning, they argue from particulars to generals.\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: _Inst._ 1. 2. 6.]\r\n\r\nTHE fairest and most rational method to interpret the will of the\r\nlegislator, is by exploring his intentions at the time when the law\r\nwas made, by _signs_ the most natural and probable. And these signs\r\nare either the words, the context, the subject matter, the effects and\r\nconsequence, or the spirit and reason of the law. Let us take a short\r\nview of them all.\r\n\r\n1. WORDS are generally to be understood in their usual and most known\r\nsignification; not so much regarding the propriety of grammar, as\r\ntheir general and popular use. Thus the law mentioned by\r\nPuffendorf[l], which forbad a layman to _lay hands_ on a priest, was\r\nadjudged to extend to him, who had hurt a priest with a weapon. Again;\r\nterms of art, or technical terms, must be taken according to the\r\nacceptation of the learned in each art, trade, and science. So in the\r\nact of settlement, where the crown of England is limited \"to the\r\nprincess Sophia, and the heirs of her body, being protestants,\" it\r\nbecomes necessary to call in the assistance of lawyers, to ascertain\r\nthe precise idea of the words \"_heirs of her body_;\" which in a legal\r\nsense comprize only certain of her lineal descendants. Lastly, where\r\nwords are clearly _repugnant_ in two laws, the later law takes place\r\nof the elder: _leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant_ is a\r\nmaxim of universal law, as well as of our own constitutions. And\r\naccordingly it was laid down by a law of the twelve tables at Rome,\r\n_quod populus postremum jussit, id jus ratum esto_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: L. of N. and N. 5. 12. 3.]\r\n\r\n2. IF words happen to be still dubious, we may establish their meaning\r\nfrom the context; with which it may be of singular use to compare a\r\nword, or a sentence, whenever they are ambiguous, equivocal, or\r\nintricate. Thus the proeme, or preamble, is often called in to help\r\nthe construction of an act of parliament. Of the same nature and use\r\nis the comparison of a law with other laws, that are made by the same\r\nlegislator, that have some affinity with the subject, or that\r\nexpressly relate to the same point. Thus, when the law of England\r\ndeclares murder to be felony without benefit of clergy, we must resort\r\nto the same law of England to learn what the benefit of clergy is:\r\nand, when the common law censures simoniacal contracts, it affords\r\ngreat light to the subject to consider what the canon law has adjudged\r\nto be simony.\r\n\r\n3. AS to the subject matter, words are always to be understood as\r\nhaving a regard thereto; for that is always supposed to be in the eye\r\nof the legislator, and all his expressions directed to that end. Thus,\r\nwhen a law of our Edward III. forbids all ecclesiastical persons to\r\npurchase _provisions_ at Rome, it might seem to prohibit the buying of\r\ngrain and other victual; but when we consider that the statute was\r\nmade to repress the usurpations of the papal see, and that the\r\nnominations to vacant benefices by the pope were called _provisions_,\r\nwe shall see that the restraint is intended to be laid upon such\r\nprovisions only.\r\n\r\n4. AS to the effects and consequence, the rule is, where words bear\r\neither none, or a very absurd signification, if literally understood,\r\nwe must a little deviate from the received sense of them. Therefore\r\nthe Bolognian law, mentioned by Puffendorf[m], which enacted \"that\r\nwhoever drew blood in the streets should be punished with the utmost\r\nseverity,\" was held after long debate not to extend to the surgeon,\r\nwho opened the vein of a person that fell down in the street with a\r\nfit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: _l._ 5. _c._ 12. §. 8.]\r\n\r\n5. BUT, lastly, the most universal and effectual way of discovering\r\nthe true meaning of a law, when the words are dubious, is by\r\nconsidering the reason and spirit of it; or the cause which moved the\r\nlegislator to enact it. For when this reason ceases, the law itself\r\nought likewise to cease with it. An instance of this is given in a\r\ncase put by Cicero, or whoever was the author of the rhetorical\r\ntreatise inscribed to Herennius[n]. There was a law, that those who in\r\na storm forsook the ship should forfeit all property therein; and the\r\nship and lading should belong entirely to those who staid in it. In a\r\ndangerous tempest all the mariners forsook the ship, except only one\r\nsick passenger, who by reason of his disease was unable to get out and\r\nescape. By chance the ship came safe to port. The sick man kept\r\npossession and claimed the benefit of the law. Now here all the\r\nlearned agree, that the sick man is not within the reason of the law;\r\nfor the reason of making it was, to give encouragement to such as\r\nshould venture their lives to save the vessel: but this is a merit,\r\nwhich he could never pretend to, who neither staid in the ship upon\r\nthat account, nor contributed any thing to it's preservation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: _l._ 1. _c._ 11.]\r\n\r\nFROM this method of interpreting laws, by the reason of them, arises\r\nwhat we call _equity_; which is thus defined by Grotius[o], \"the\r\ncorrection of that, wherein the law (by reason of its universality) is\r\ndeficient.\" For since in laws all cases cannot be foreseen or\r\nexpressed, it is necessary, that when the general decrees of the law\r\ncome to be applied to particular cases, there should be somewhere a\r\npower vested of excepting those circumstances, which (had they been\r\nforeseen) the legislator himself would have excepted. And these are\r\nthe cases, which, as Grotius expresses it, \"_lex non exacte definit,\r\nsed arbitrio boni viri permittit_.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: _de aequitate._]\r\n\r\nEQUITY thus depending, essentially, upon the particular circumstances\r\nof each individual case, there can be no established rules and fixed\r\nprecepts of equity laid down, without destroying it's very essence,\r\nand reducing it to a positive law. And, on the other hand, the liberty\r\nof considering all cases in an equitable light must not be indulged\r\ntoo far, lest thereby we destroy all law, and leave the decision of\r\nevery question entirely in the breast of the judge. And law, without\r\nequity, tho' hard and disagreeable, is much more desirable for the\r\npublic good, than equity without law; which would make every judge a\r\nlegislator, and introduce most infinite confusion; as there would then\r\nbe almost as many different rules of action laid down in our courts,\r\nas there are differences of capacity and sentiment in the human mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION THE THIRD.\r\n\r\nOF THE LAWS OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE municipal law of England, or the rule of civil conduct prescribed\r\nto the inhabitants of this kingdom, may with sufficient propriety be\r\ndivided into two kinds; the _lex non scripta_, the unwritten, or\r\ncommon law; and the _lex scripta_, the written, or statute law.\r\n\r\nTHE _lex non scripta_, or unwritten law, includes not only _general\r\ncustoms_, or the common law properly so called; but also the\r\n_particular customs_ of certain parts of the kingdom; and likewise\r\nthose _particular laws_, that are by custom observed only in certain\r\ncourts and jurisdictions.\r\n\r\nWHEN I call these parts of our law _leges non scriptae_, I would not\r\nbe understood as if all those laws were at present merely _oral_, or\r\ncommunicated from the former ages to the present solely by word of\r\nmouth. It is true indeed that, in the profound ignorance of letters\r\nwhich formerly overspread the whole western world, all laws were\r\nintirely traditional, for this plain reason, that the nations among\r\nwhich they prevailed had but little idea of writing. Thus the British\r\nas well as the Gallic druids committed all their laws as well as\r\nlearning to memory[a]; and it is said of the primitive Saxons here, as\r\nwell as their brethren on the continent, that _leges sola memoria et\r\nusu retinebant_[b]. But with us at present the monuments and evidences\r\nof our legal customs are contained in the records of the several\r\ncourts of justice, in books of reports and judicial decisions, and in\r\nthe treatises of learned sages of the profession, preserved and handed\r\ndown to us from the times of highest antiquity. However I therefore\r\nstile these parts of our law _leges non scriptae_, because their\r\noriginal institution and authority are not set down in writing, as\r\nacts of parliament are, but they receive their binding power, and the\r\nforce of laws, by long and immemorial usage, and by their universal\r\nreception throughout the kingdom. In like manner as Aulus Gellius\r\ndefines the _jus non scriptum_ to be that, which is \"_tacito et\r\nilliterato hominum consensu et moribus expressum_.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: _Caes. de b. G._ _lib._ 6. _c._ 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Spelm. Gl. 362.]\r\n\r\nOUR antient lawyers, and particularly Fortescue[c], insist with\r\nabundance of warmth, that these customs are as old as the primitive\r\nBritons, and continued down, through the several mutations of\r\ngovernment and inhabitants, to the present time, unchanged and\r\nunadulterated. This may be the case as to some; but in general, as Mr\r\nSelden in his notes observes, this assertion must be understood with\r\nmany grains of allowance; and ought only to signify, as the truth\r\nseems to be, that there never was any formal exchange of one system of\r\nlaws for another: though doubtless by the intermixture of adventitious\r\nnations, the Romans, the Picts, the Saxons, the Danes, and the\r\nNormans, they must have insensibly introduced and incorporated many of\r\ntheir own customs with those that were before established: thereby in\r\nall probability improving the texture and wisdom of the whole, by the\r\naccumulated wisdom of divers particular countries. Our laws, saith\r\nlord Bacon[d], are mixed as our language: and as our language is so\r\nmuch the richer, the laws are the more complete.\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: _c._ 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: See his proposals for a digest.]\r\n\r\nAND indeed our antiquarians and first historians do all positively\r\nassure us, that our body of laws is of this compounded nature. For\r\nthey tell us, that in the time of Alfred the local customs of the\r\nseveral provinces of the kingdom were grown so various, that he found\r\nit expedient to compile his _dome-book_ or _liber judicialis_, for the\r\ngeneral use of the whole kingdom. This book is said to have been\r\nextant so late as the reign of king Edward the fourth, but is now\r\nunfortunately lost. It contained, we may probably suppose, the\r\nprincipal maxims of the common law, the penalties for misdemesnors,\r\nand the forms of judicial proceedings. Thus much may at least be\r\ncollected from that injunction to observe it, which we find in the\r\nlaws of king Edward the elder, the son of Alfred[e]. \"_Omnibus qui\r\nreipublicae praesunt, etiam atque etiam mando, ut omnibus aequos se\r\npraebeant judices, perinde ac in judiciali libro_ (_Saxonice_,\r\n[Anglo-Saxon: dom-bec]) _scriptum habetur; nec quicquam formident quin\r\njus commune_ (_Saxonice_, [Anglo-Saxon: folcrihte]) _audacter\r\nlibereque dicant._\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: _c._ 1.]\r\n\r\nBUT the irruption and establishment of the Danes in England which\r\nfollowed soon after, introduced new customs and caused this code of\r\nAlfred in many provinces to fall into disuse; or at least to be mixed\r\nand debased with other laws of a coarser alloy. So that about the\r\nbeginning of the eleventh century there were three principal systems\r\nof laws prevailing in different districts. 1. The _Mercen-Lage_, or\r\nMercian laws, which were observed in many of the midland counties, and\r\nthose bordering on the principality of Wales; the retreat of the\r\nantient Britons; and therefore very probably intermixed with the\r\nBritish or Druidical customs. 2. The _West-Saxon-Lage_, or laws of the\r\nwest Saxons, which obtained in the counties to the south and west of\r\nthe island, from Kent to Devonshire. These were probably much the same\r\nwith the laws of Alfred abovementioned, being the municipal law of the\r\nfar most considerable part of his dominions, and particularly\r\nincluding Berkshire, the seat of his peculiar residence. 3. The\r\n_Dane-Lage_, or Danish law, the very name of which speaks it's\r\noriginal and composition. This was principally maintained in the rest\r\nof the midland counties, and also on the eastern coast, the seat of\r\nthat piratical people. As for the very northern provinces, they were\r\nat that time under a distinct government[f].\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Hal. Hist. 55.]\r\n\r\nOUT of these three laws, Roger Hoveden[g] and Ranulphus Cestrensis[h]\r\ninform us, king Edward the confessor extracted one uniform law or\r\ndigest of laws, to be observed throughout the whole kingdom; though\r\nHoveden and the author of an old manuscript chronicle[i] assure us\r\nlikewise, that this work was projected and begun by his grandfather\r\nking Edgar. And indeed a general digest of the same nature has been\r\nconstantly found expedient, and therefore put in practice by other\r\ngreat nations, formed from an assemblage of little provinces, governed\r\nby peculiar customs. As in Portugal, under king Edward, about the\r\nbeginning of the fifteenth century[k]. In Spain under Alonzo X, who\r\nabout the year 1250 executed the plan of his father St. Ferdinand, and\r\ncollected all the provincial customs into one uniform law, in the\r\ncelebrated code entitled _las partidas_[l]. And in Sweden about the\r\nsame aera, a universal body of common law was compiled out of the\r\nparticular customs established by the laghman of every province, and\r\nintitled the _land's lagh_, being analogous to the _common law_ of\r\nEngland[m].\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: _in Hen. II._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: _in Edw. Confessor._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: _in Seld. ad Eadmer._ 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Mod. Un. Hist. xxii. 135.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: Ibid. xx. 211.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: Ibid. xxxiii. 21, 58.]\r\n\r\nBOTH these undertakings, of king Edgar and Edward the confessor, seem\r\nto have been no more than a new edition, or fresh promulgation, of\r\nAlfred's code or dome-book, with such additions and improvements as\r\nthe experience of a century and an half had suggested. For Alfred is\r\ngenerally stiled by the same historians the _legum Anglicanarum\r\nconditor_, as Edward the confessor is the _restitutor_. These however\r\nare the laws which our histories so often mention under the name of\r\nthe laws of Edward the confessor; which our ancestors struggled so\r\nhardly to maintain, under the first princes of the Norman line; and\r\nwhich subsequent princes so frequently promised to keep and to\r\nrestore, as the most popular act they could do, when pressed by\r\nforeign emergencies or domestic discontents. These are the laws, that\r\nso vigorously withstood the repeated attacks of the civil law; which\r\nestablished in the twelfth century a new Roman empire over most of the\r\nstates on the continent: states that have lost, and perhaps upon that\r\naccount, their political liberties; while the free constitution of\r\nEngland, perhaps upon the same account, has been rather improved than\r\ndebased. These, in short, are the laws which gave rise and original to\r\nthat collection of maxims and customs, which is now known by the name\r\nof the common law. A name either given to it, in contradistinction to\r\nother laws, as the statute law, the civil law, the law merchant, and\r\nthe like; or, more probably, as a law _common_ to all the realm, the\r\n_jus commune_ or _folcright_ mentioned by king Edward the elder, after\r\nthe abolition of the several provincial customs and particular laws\r\nbeforementioned.\r\n\r\nBUT though this is the most likely foundation of this collection of\r\nmaxims and customs, yet the maxims and customs, so collected, are of\r\nhigher antiquity than memory or history can reach: nothing being more\r\ndifficult than to ascertain the precise beginning and first spring of\r\nan antient and long established custom. Whence it is that in our law\r\nthe goodness of a custom depends upon it's having been used time out\r\nof mind; or, in the solemnity of our legal phrase, time whereof the\r\nmemory of man runneth not to the contrary. This it is that gives it\r\nit's weight and authority; and of this nature are the maxims and\r\ncustoms which compose the common law, or _lex non scripta_, of this\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nTHIS unwritten, or common, law is properly distinguishable into three\r\nkinds: 1. General customs; which are the universal rule of the whole\r\nkingdom, and form the common law, in it's stricter and more usual\r\nsignification. 2. Particular customs; which for the most part affect\r\nonly the inhabitants of particular districts. 3. Certain particular\r\nlaws; which by custom are adopted and used by some particular courts,\r\nof pretty general and extensive jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nI. AS to general customs, or the common law, properly so called; this\r\nis that law, by which proceedings and determinations in the king's\r\nordinary courts of justice are guided and directed. This, for the most\r\npart, settles the course in which lands descend by inheritance; the\r\nmanner and form of acquiring and transferring property; the\r\nsolemnities and obligation of contracts; the rules of expounding\r\nwills, deeds, and acts of parliament; the respective remedies of civil\r\ninjuries; the several species of temporal offences, with the manner\r\nand degree of punishment; and an infinite number of minuter\r\nparticulars, which diffuse themselves as extensively as the ordinary\r\ndistribution of common justice requires. Thus, for example, that there\r\nshall be four superior courts of record, the chancery, the king's\r\nbench, the common pleas, and the exchequer;--that the eldest son alone\r\nis heir to his ancestor;--that property may be acquired and\r\ntransferred by writing;--that a deed is of no validity unless\r\nsealed;--that wills shall be construed more favorably, and deeds more\r\nstrictly;--that money lent upon bond is recoverable by action of\r\ndebt;--that breaking the public peace is an offence, and punishable by\r\nfine and imprisonment;--all these are doctrines that are not set down\r\nin any written statute or ordinance, but depend merely upon immemorial\r\nusage, that is, upon common law, for their support.\r\n\r\nSOME have divided the common law into two principal grounds or\r\nfoundations: 1. established customs; such as that where there are\r\nthree brothers, the eldest brother shall be heir to the second, in\r\nexclusion of the youngest: and 2. established rules and maxims; as,\r\n\"that the king can do no wrong, that no man shall be bound to accuse\r\nhimself,\" and the like. But I take these to be one and the same thing.\r\nFor the authority of these maxims rests entirely upon general\r\nreception and usage; and the only method of proving, that this or that\r\nmaxim is a rule of the common law, is by shewing that it hath been\r\nalways the custom to observe it.\r\n\r\nBUT here a very natural, and very material, question arises: how are\r\nthese customs or maxims to be known, and by whom is their validity to\r\nbe determined? The answer is, by the judges in the several courts of\r\njustice. They are the depositary of the laws; the living oracles, who\r\nmust decide in all cases of doubt, and who are bound by an oath to\r\ndecide according to the law of the land. Their knowlege of that law is\r\nderived from experience and study; from the \"_viginti annorum\r\nlucubrationes_,\" which Fortescue[n] mentions; and from being long\r\npersonally accustomed to the judicial decisions of their predecessors.\r\nAnd indeed these judicial decisions are the principal and most\r\nauthoritative evidence, that can be given, of the existence of such a\r\ncustom as shall form a part of the common law. The judgment itself,\r\nand all the proceedings previous thereto, are carefully registered and\r\npreserved, under the name of _records_, in publick repositories set\r\napart for that particular purpose; and to them frequent recourse is\r\nhad, when any critical question arises, in the determination of which\r\nformer precedents may give light or assistance. And therefore, even so\r\nearly as the conquest, we find the \"_praeteritorum memoria eventorum_\"\r\nreckoned up as one of the chief qualifications of those who were held\r\nto be \"_legibus patriae optime instituti_[o].\" For it is an\r\nestablished rule to abide by former precedents, where the same points\r\ncome again in litigation; as well to keep the scale of justice even\r\nand steady, and not liable to waver with every new judge's opinion; as\r\nalso because the law in that case being solemnly declared and\r\ndetermined, what before was uncertain, and perhaps indifferent, is now\r\nbecome a permanent rule, which it is not in the breast of any\r\nsubsequent judge to alter or vary from, according to his private\r\nsentiments: he being sworn to determine, not according to his own\r\nprivate judgment, but according to the known laws and customs of the\r\nland; not delegated to pronounce a new law, but to maintain and\r\nexpound the old one. Yet this rule admits of exception, where the\r\nformer determination is most evidently contrary to reason; much more\r\nif it be contrary to the divine law. But even in such cases the\r\nsubsequent judges do not pretend to make a new law, but to vindicate\r\nthe old one from misrepresentation. For if it be found that the former\r\ndecision is manifestly absurd or unjust, it is declared, not that such\r\na sentence was _bad law_, but that it was _not law_; that is, that it\r\nis not the established custom of the realm, as has been erroneously\r\ndetermined. And hence it is that our lawyers are with justice so\r\ncopious in their encomiums on the reason of the common law; that they\r\ntell us, that the law is the perfection of reason, that it always\r\nintends to conform thereto, and that what is not reason is not law.\r\nNot that the particular reason of every rule in the law can at this\r\ndistance of time be always precisely assigned; but it is sufficient\r\nthat there be nothing in the rule flatly contradictory to reason, and\r\nthen the law will presume it to be well founded[p]. And it hath been\r\nan antient observation in the laws of England, that whenever a\r\nstanding rule of law, of which the reason perhaps could not be\r\nremembered or discerned, hath been wantonly broke in upon by statutes\r\nor new resolutions, the wisdom of the rule hath in the end appeared\r\nfrom the inconveniences that have followed the innovation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: _cap._ 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: Seld. review of Tith. c. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: Herein agreeing with the civil law, _Ff._ 1. 3. 20, 21.\r\n\"_Non omnium, quae a majoribus nostris constituta sunt, ratio reddi\r\npotest. Et ideo rationes eorum quae constituuntur, inquiri non\r\noportet: alioquin multa ex his, quae certa sunt, subvertuntur._\"]\r\n\r\nTHE doctrine of the law then is this: that precedents and rules must\r\nbe followed, unless flatly absurd or unjust: for though their reason\r\nbe not obvious at first view, yet we owe such a deference to former\r\ntimes as not to suppose they acted wholly without consideration. To\r\nillustrate this doctrine by examples. It has been determined, time out\r\nof mind, that a brother of the half blood (i.e. where they have only\r\none parent the same, and the other different) shall never succeed as\r\nheir to the estate of his half brother, but it shall rather escheat to\r\nthe king, or other superior lord. Now this is a positive law, fixed\r\nand established by custom, which custom is evidenced by judicial\r\ndecisions; and therefore can never be departed from by any modern\r\njudge without a breach of his oath and the law. For herein there is\r\nnothing repugnant to natural justice; though the reason of it, drawn\r\nfrom the feodal law, may not be quite obvious to every body. And\r\ntherefore, on account of a supposed hardship upon the half brother, a\r\nmodern judge might wish it had been otherwise settled; yet it is not\r\nin his power to alter it. But if any court were now to determine, that\r\nan elder brother of the half blood might enter upon and seise any\r\nlands that were purchased by his younger brother, no subsequent judges\r\nwould scruple to declare that such prior determination was unjust, was\r\nunreasonable, and therefore was _not law_. So that _the law_, and the\r\n_opinion of the judge_ are not always convertible terms, or one and\r\nthe same thing; since it sometimes may happen that the judge may\r\n_mistake_ the law. Upon the whole however, we may take it as a general\r\nrule, \"that the decisions of courts of justice are the evidence of\r\nwhat is common law:\" in the same manner as, in the civil law, what the\r\nemperor had once determined was to serve for a guide for the\r\nfuture[q].\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: \"_Si imperialis majestas causam cognitionaliter\r\nexaminaverit, et partibus cominus constitutis sententiam dixerit,\r\nomnes omnino judices, qui sub nostro imperio sunt, sciant hanc esse\r\nlegem, non solum illi causae pro qua producta est, sed et in omnibus\r\nsimilibus._\" _C._ 1. 14. 12.]\r\n\r\nTHE decisions therefore of courts are held in the highest regard, and\r\nare not only preserved as authentic records in the treasuries of the\r\nseveral courts, but are handed out to public view in the numerous\r\nvolumes of _reports_ which furnish the lawyer's library. These reports\r\nare histories of the several cases, with a short summary of the\r\nproceedings, which are preserved at large in the record; the arguments\r\non both sides; and the reasons the court gave for their judgment;\r\ntaken down in short notes by persons present at the determination. And\r\nthese serve as indexes to, and also to explain, the records; which\r\nalways, in matters of consequence and nicety, the judges direct to be\r\nsearched. The reports are extant in a regular series from the reign of\r\nking Edward the second inclusive; and from his time to that of Henry\r\nthe eighth were taken by the prothonotaries, or chief scribes of the\r\ncourt, at the expence of the crown, and published _annually_, whence\r\nthey are known under the denomination of the _year books_. And it is\r\nmuch to be wished that this beneficial custom had, under proper\r\nregulations, been continued to this day: for, though king James the\r\nfirst at the instance of lord Bacon appointed two reporters with a\r\nhandsome stipend for this purpose, yet that wise institution was soon\r\nneglected, and from the reign of Henry the eighth to the present time\r\nthis task has been executed by many private and cotemporary hands; who\r\nsometimes through haste and inaccuracy, sometimes through mistake and\r\nwant of skill, have published very crude and imperfect (perhaps\r\ncontradictory) accounts of one and the same determination. Some of the\r\nmost valuable of the antient reports are those published by lord chief\r\njustice Coke; a man of infinite learning in his profession, though not\r\na little infected with the pedantry and quaintness of the times he\r\nlived in, which appear strongly in all his works. However his writings\r\nare so highly esteemed, that they are generally cited without the\r\nauthor's name[r].\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: His reports, for instance, are stiled, [Greek: kat'\r\nexochên], _the reports_; and in quoting them we usually say, 1 or 2\r\nRep. not 1 or 2 Coke's Rep. as in citing other authors. The reports of\r\njudge Croke are also cited in a peculiar manner, by the name of those\r\nprinces, in whose reigns the cases reported in his three volumes were\r\ndetermined; viz. Qu. Elizabeth, K. James, and K. Charles the first; as\r\nwell as by the number of each volume. For sometimes we call them, 1,\r\n2, and 3 Cro. but more commonly Cro. Eliz. Cro. Jac. and Cro. Car.]\r\n\r\nBESIDES these reporters, there are also other authors, to whom great\r\nveneration and respect is paid by the students of the common law. Such\r\nare Glanvil and Bracton, Britton and Fleta, Littleton and Fitzherbert,\r\nwith some others of antient date, whose treatises are cited as\r\nauthority; and are evidence that cases have formerly happened in which\r\nsuch and such points were determined, which are now become settled and\r\nfirst principles. One of the last of these methodical writers in point\r\nof time, whose works are of any intrinsic authority in the courts of\r\njustice, and do not entirely depend on the strength of their\r\nquotations from older authors, is the same learned judge we have just\r\nmentioned, sir Edward Coke; who hath written four volumes of\r\ninstitutes, as he is pleased to call them, though they have little of\r\nthe institutional method to warrant such a title. The first volume is\r\na very extensive comment upon a little excellent treatise of tenures,\r\ncompiled by judge Littleton in the reign of Edward the fourth. This\r\ncomment is a rich mine of valuable common law learning, collected and\r\nheaped together from the antient reports and year books, but greatly\r\ndefective in method[s]. The second volume is a comment upon many old\r\nacts of parliament, without any systematical order; the third a more\r\nmethodical treatise of the pleas of the crown; and the fourth an\r\naccount of the several species of courts[t].\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: It is usually cited either by the name of Co. Litt. or as\r\n1 Inst.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: These are cited as 2, 3, or 4 Inst. without any author's\r\nname. An honorary distinction, which, we observed, was paid to the\r\nworks of no other writer; the generality of reports and other tracts\r\nbeing quoted in the name of the compiler, as 2 Ventris, 4 Leonard, 1\r\nSiderfin, and the like.]\r\n\r\nAND thus much for the first ground and chief corner stone of the laws\r\nof England, which is, general immemorial custom, or common law, from\r\ntime to time declared in the decisions of the courts of justice; which\r\ndecisions are preserved among our public records, explained in our\r\nreports, and digested for general use in the authoritative writings of\r\nthe venerable sages of the law.\r\n\r\nTHE Roman law, as practised in the times of it's liberty, paid also a\r\ngreat regard to custom; but not so much as our law: it only then\r\nadopting it, when the written law is deficient. Though the reasons\r\nalleged in the digest[u] will fully justify our practice, in making it\r\nof equal authority with, when it is not contradicted by, the written\r\nlaw. \"For since, says Julianus, the written law binds us for no other\r\nreason but because it is approved by the judgment of the people,\r\ntherefore those laws which the people hath approved without writing\r\nought also to bind every body. For where is the difference, whether\r\nthe people declare their assent to a law by suffrage, or by a uniform\r\ncourse of acting accordingly?\" Thus did they reason while Rome had\r\nsome remains of her freedom; but when the imperial tyranny came to be\r\nfully established, the civil laws speak a very different language.\r\n\"_Quod principi placuit legis habet vigorem, cum populus ei et in eum\r\nomne suum imperium et potestatem conferat_,\" says Ulpian[w].\r\n\"_Imperator solus et conditor et interpres legis existimatur_,\" says\r\nthe code[x]. And again, \"_sacrilegii instar est rescripto principis\r\nobviare_[y].\" And indeed it is one of the characteristic marks of\r\nEnglish liberty, that our common law depends upon custom; which\r\ncarries this internal evidence of freedom along with it, that it\r\nprobably was introduced by the voluntary consent of the people.\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: _Ff._ 1. 3. 32.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: _Ff._ 1. 4. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: _C._ 1. 14. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: _C._ 1. 23. 5.]\r\n\r\nII. THE second branch of the unwritten laws of England are particular\r\ncustoms, or laws which affect only the inhabitants of particular\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nTHESE particular customs, or some of them, are without doubt the\r\nremains of that multitude of local customs before mentioned, out of\r\nwhich the common law, as it now stands, was collected at first by king\r\nAlfred, and afterwards by king Edgar and Edward the confessor: each\r\ndistrict mutually sacrificing some of it's own special usages, in\r\norder that the whole kingdom might enjoy the benefit of one uniform\r\nand universal system of laws. But, for reasons that have been now long\r\nforgotten, particular counties, cities, towns, manors, and lordships,\r\nwere very early indulged with the privilege of abiding by their own\r\ncustoms, in contradistinction to the rest of the nation at large:\r\nwhich privilege is confirmed to them by several acts of parliament[z].\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: Mag. Cart. c. 9.--1 Edw. III. st. 2. c. 9.--14 Edw. III.\r\nst. 1. c. 1.--and 2 Hen. IV. c. 1.]\r\n\r\nSUCH is the custom of gavelkind in Kent and some other parts of the\r\nkingdom (though perhaps it was also general till the Norman conquest)\r\nwhich ordains, among other things, that not the eldest son only of the\r\nfather shall succeed to his inheritance, but all the sons alike: and\r\nthat, though the ancestor be attainted and hanged, yet the heir shall\r\nsucceed to his estate, without any escheat to the lord.--Such is the\r\ncustom that prevails in divers antient boroughs, and therefore called\r\nborough-english, that the youngest son shall inherit the estate, in\r\npreference to all his elder brothers.--Such is the custom in other\r\nboroughs that a widow shall be intitled, for her dower, to all her\r\nhusband's lands; whereas at the common law she shall be endowed of one\r\nthird part only.--Such also are the special and particular customs of\r\nmanors, of which every one has more or less, and which bind all the\r\ncopyhold-tenants that hold of the said manors.--Such likewise is the\r\ncustom of holding divers inferior courts, with power of trying causes,\r\nin cities and trading towns; the right of holding which, when no royal\r\ngrant can be shewn, depends entirely upon immemorial and established\r\nusage.--Such, lastly, are many particular customs within the city of\r\nLondon, with regard to trade, apprentices, widows, orphans, and a\r\nvariety of other matters; which are all contrary to the general law of\r\nthe land, and are good only by special custom, though those of London\r\nare also confirmed by act of parliament[a].\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: 8 Rep. 126. Cro. Car. 347.]\r\n\r\nTO this head may most properly be referred a particular system of\r\ncustoms used only among one set of the king's subjects, called the\r\ncustom of merchants or _lex mercatoria_; which, however different from\r\nthe common law, is allowed for the benefit of trade, to be of the\r\nutmost validity in all commercial transactions; the maxim of law\r\nbeing, that \"_cuilibet in sua arte credendum est_.\"\r\n\r\nTHE rules relating to particular customs regard either the proof of\r\ntheir existence; their legality when proved; or their usual method of\r\nallowance. And first we will consider the rules of proof.\r\n\r\nAS to gavelkind, and borough-english, the law takes particular notice\r\nof them[b], and there is no occasion to prove that such customs\r\nactually exist, but only that the lands in question are subject\r\nthereto. All other private customs must be particularly pleaded[c],\r\nand as well the existence of such customs must be shewn, as that the\r\nthing in dispute is within the custom alleged. The trial in both cases\r\n(both to shew the existence of the custom, as, \"that in the manor of\r\nDale lands shall descend only to the heirs male, and never to the\r\nheirs female;\" and also to shew that the lands in question are within\r\nthat manor) is by a jury of twelve men, and not by the judges, except\r\nthe same particular custom has been before tried, determined, and\r\nrecorded in the same court[d].\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Co. Litt. 175 _b._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Litt. §. 265.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: Dr and St. 1. 10.]\r\n\r\nTHE customs of London differ from all others in point of trial: for,\r\nif the existence of the custom be brought in question, it shall not be\r\ntried by a jury, but by certificate from the lord mayor and aldermen\r\nby the mouth of their recorder[e]; unless it be such a custom as the\r\ncorporation is itself interested in, as a right of taking toll, &c,\r\nfor then the law permits them not to certify on their own behalf[f].\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Cro. Car. 516.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Hob. 85.]\r\n\r\nWHEN a custom is actually proved to exist, the next enquiry is into\r\nthe legality of it; for if it is not a good custom it ought to be no\r\nlonger used. \"_Malus usus abolendus est_\" is an established maxim of\r\nthe law[g]. To make a particular custom good, the following are\r\nnecessary requisites.\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Litt. §. 212. 4 Inst. 274.]\r\n\r\n1. THAT it have been used so long, that the memory of man runneth not\r\nto the contrary. So that if any one can shew the beginning of it, it\r\nis no good custom. For which reason no custom can prevail against an\r\nexpress act of parliament; since the statute itself is a proof of a\r\ntime when such a custom did not exist[h].\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Co. Litt. 113 _b._]\r\n\r\n2. IT must have been _continued_. Any interruption would cause a\r\ntemporary ceasing: the revival gives it a new beginning, which will be\r\nwithin time of memory, and thereupon the custom will be void. But this\r\nmust be understood with regard to an interruption of the _right_; for\r\nan interruption of the _possession_ only, for ten or twenty years,\r\nwill not destroy the custom[i]. As if I have a right of way by custom\r\nover another's field, the custom is not destroyed, though I do not\r\npass over it for ten years; it only becomes more difficult to prove:\r\nbut if the _right_ be any how discontinued for a day, the custom is\r\nquite at an end.\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: Co. Litt. 114 _b._]\r\n\r\n3. IT must have been _peaceable_, and acquiesced in; not subject to\r\ncontention and dispute[k]. For as customs owe their original to common\r\nconsent, their being immemorially disputed either at law or otherwise\r\nis a proof that such consent was wanting.\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Co. Litt. 114.]\r\n\r\n4. CUSTOMS must be _reasonable_[l]; or rather, taken negatively, they\r\nmust not be unreasonable. Which is not always, as sir Edward Coke\r\nsays[m], to be understood of every unlearned man's reason, but of\r\nartificial and legal reason, warranted by authority of law. Upon which\r\naccount a custom may be good, though the particular reason of it\r\ncannot be assigned; for it sufficeth, if no good legal reason can be\r\nassigned against it. Thus a custom in a parish, that no man shall put\r\nhis beasts into the common till the third of october, would be good;\r\nand yet it would be hard to shew the reason why that day in particular\r\nis fixed upon, rather than the day before or after. But a custom that\r\nno cattle shall be put in till the lord of the manor has first put in\r\nhis, is unreasonable, and therefore bad: for peradventure the lord\r\nwill never put in his; and then the tenants will lose all their\r\nprofits[n].\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: Litt. §. 212.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: 1 Inst. 62.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: Co. Copyh. §. 33.]\r\n\r\n5. CUSTOMS ought to be _certain_. A custom, that lands shall descend\r\nto the most worthy of the owner's blood, is void; for how shall this\r\nworth be determined? But a custom to descend to the next male of the\r\nblood, exclusive of females, is certain, and therefore good[o]. A\r\ncustom, to pay two pence an acre in lieu of tythes, is good; but to\r\npay sometimes two pence and sometimes three pence, as the occupier of\r\nthe land pleases, is bad for it's uncertainty. Yet a custom, to pay a\r\nyear's improved value for a fine on a copyhold estate, is good: though\r\nthe value is a thing uncertain. For the value may at any time be\r\nascertained; and the maxim of law is, _id certum est, quod certum\r\nreddi potest_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: 1 Roll. Abr. 565.]\r\n\r\n6. CUSTOMS, though established by consent, must be (when established)\r\n_compulsory_; and not left to the option of every man, whether he will\r\nuse them or no. Therefore a custom, that all the inhabitants shall be\r\nrated toward the maintenance of a bridge, will be good; but a custom,\r\nthat every man is to contribute thereto at his own pleasure, is idle\r\nand absurd, and, indeed, no custom at all.\r\n\r\n7. LASTLY, customs must be _consistent_ with each other: one custom\r\ncannot be set up in opposition to another. For if both are really\r\ncustoms, then both are of equal antiquity, and both established by\r\nmutual consent: which to say of contradictory customs is absurd.\r\nTherefore, if one man prescribes that by custom he has a right to have\r\nwindows looking into another's garden; the other cannot claim a right\r\nby custom to stop up or obstruct those windows: for these two\r\ncontradictory customs cannot both be good, nor both stand together. He\r\nought rather to deny the existence of the former custom[p].\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: 9 Rep. 58.]\r\n\r\nNEXT, as to the allowance of special customs. Customs, in derogation\r\nof the common law, must be construed strictly. Thus, by the custom of\r\ngavelkind, an infant of fifteen years may by one species of\r\nconveyance (called a deed of feoffment) convey away his lands in fee\r\nsimple, or for ever. Yet this custom does not impower him to use any\r\nother conveyance, or even to lease them for seven years: for the\r\ncustom must be strictly pursued[q]. And, moreover, all special customs\r\nmust submit to the king's prerogative. Therefore, if the king\r\npurchases lands of the nature of gavelkind, where all the sons inherit\r\nequally; yet, upon the king's demise, his eldest son shall succeed to\r\nthose lands alone[r]. And thus much for the second part of the _leges\r\nnon scriptae_, or those particular customs which affect particular\r\npersons or districts only.\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: Co. Cop. §. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Co. Litt. 15 _b._]\r\n\r\nIII. THE third branch of them are those peculiar laws, which by custom\r\nare adopted and used only in certain peculiar courts and\r\njurisdictions. And by these I understand the civil and canon laws.\r\n\r\nIT may seem a little improper at first view to rank these laws under\r\nthe head of _leges non scriptae_, or unwritten laws, seeing they are\r\nset forth by authority in their pandects, their codes, and their\r\ninstitutions; their councils, decrees, and decretals; and enforced by\r\nan immense number of expositions, decisions, and treatises of the\r\nlearned in both branches of the law. But I do this, after the example\r\nof sir Matthew Hale[s], because it is most plain, that it is not on\r\naccount of their being _written_ laws, that either the canon law, or\r\nthe civil law, have any obligation within this kingdom; neither do\r\ntheir force and efficacy depend upon their own intrinsic authority;\r\nwhich is the case of our written laws, or acts of parliament. They\r\nbind not the subjects of England, because their materials were\r\ncollected from popes or emperors; were digested by Justinian, or\r\ndeclared to be authentic by Gregory. These considerations give them no\r\nauthority here: for the legislature of England doth not, nor ever did,\r\nrecognize any foreign power, as superior or equal to it in this\r\nkingdom; or as having the right to give law to any, the meanest, of\r\nit's subjects. But all the strength that either the papal or imperial\r\nlaws have obtained in this realm, or indeed in any other kingdom in\r\nEurope, is only because they have been admitted and received by\r\nimmemorial usage and custom in some particular cases, and some\r\nparticular courts; and then they form a branch of the _leges non\r\nscriptae_, or customary law: or else, because they are in some other\r\ncases introduced by consent of parliament, and then they owe their\r\nvalidity to the _leges scriptae_, or statute law. This is expressly\r\ndeclared in those remarkable words of the statute 25 Hen. VIII. c. 21.\r\naddressed to the king's royal majesty.--\"This your grace's realm,\r\nrecognizing no superior under God but only your grace, hath been and\r\nis free from subjection to any man's laws, but only to such as have\r\nbeen devised, made, and ordained _within_ this realm for the wealth of\r\nthe same; or to such other, as by sufferance of your grace and your\r\nprogenitors, the people of this your realm, have taken at their free\r\nliberty, by their own consent, to be used among them; and have bound\r\nthemselves by long use and custom to the observance of the same: not\r\nas to the observance of the laws of any foreign prince, potentate, or\r\nprelate; but as to the _customed_ and antient laws of this realm,\r\noriginally established as laws of the same, by the said sufferance,\r\nconsents, and custom; and none otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: Hist. C.L. c. 2.]\r\n\r\nBY the civil law, absolutely taken, is generally understood the civil\r\nor municipal law of the Roman empire, as comprized in the institutes,\r\nthe code, and the digest of the emperor Justinian, and the novel\r\nconstitutions of himself and some of his successors. Of which, as\r\nthere will frequently be occasion to cite them, by way of illustrating\r\nour own laws, it may not be amiss to give a short and general account.\r\n\r\nTHE Roman law (founded first upon the regal constitutions of their\r\nantient kings, next upon the twelve tables of the _decemviri_, then\r\nupon the laws or statutes enacted by the senate or people, the edicts\r\nof the praetor, and the _responsa prudentum_ or opinions of learned\r\nlawyers, and lastly upon the imperial decrees, or constitutions of\r\nsuccessive emperors) had grown to so great a bulk, or as Livy\r\nexpresses it[t], \"_tam immensus aliarum super alias acervatarum legum\r\ncumulus_,\" that they were computed to be many camels' load by an\r\nauthor who preceded Justinian[u]. This was in part remedied by the\r\ncollections of three private lawyers, Gregorius, Hermogenes, and\r\nPapirius; and then by the emperor Theodosius the younger, by whose\r\norders a code was compiled, _A.D._ 438, being a methodical collection\r\nof all the imperial constitutions then in force: which Theodosian code\r\nwas the only book of civil law received as authentic in the western\r\npart of Europe till many centuries after; and to this it is probable\r\nthat the Franks and Goths might frequently pay some regard, in framing\r\nlegal constitutions for their newly erected kingdoms. For Justinian\r\ncommanded only in the eastern remains of the empire; and it was under\r\nhis auspices, that the present body of civil law was compiled and\r\nfinished by Tribonian and other lawyers, about the year 533.\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: _l._ 3. _c._ 34.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: Taylor's elements of civil law. 17.]\r\n\r\nTHIS consists of, 1. The institutes, which contain the elements or\r\nfirst principles of the Roman law, in four books. 2. The digests, or\r\npandects, in fifty books, containing the opinions and writings of\r\neminent lawyers, digested in a systematical method. 3. A new code, or\r\ncollection of imperial constitutions, the lapse of a whole century\r\nhaving rendered the former code, of Theodosius, imperfect. 4. The\r\nnovels, or new constitutions, posterior in time to the other books,\r\nand amounting to a supplement to the code; containing new decrees of\r\nsuccessive emperors, as new questions happened to arise. These form\r\nthe body of Roman law, or _corpus juris civilis_, as published about\r\nthe time of Justinian: which however fell soon into neglect and\r\noblivion, till about the year 1130, when a copy of the digests was\r\nfound at Amalfi in Italy; which accident, concurring with the policy\r\nof the Romish ecclesiastics[w], suddenly gave new vogue and authority\r\nto the civil law, introduced it into several nations, and occasioned\r\nthat mighty inundation of voluminous comments, with which this system\r\nof law, more than any other, is now loaded.\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: See §. 1. pag. 18.]\r\n\r\nTHE canon law is a body of Roman ecclesiastical law, relative to such\r\nmatters as that church either has, or pretends to have, the proper\r\njurisdiction over. This is compiled from the opinions of the antient\r\nLatin fathers, the decrees of general councils, the decretal epistles\r\nand bulles of the holy see. All which lay in the same disorder and\r\nconfusion as the Roman civil law, till about the year 1151, one\r\nGratian an Italian monk, animated by the discovery of Justinian's\r\npandects at Amalfi, reduced them into some method in three books,\r\nwhich he entitled _concordia discordantium canonum_, but which are\r\ngenerally known by the name of _decretum Gratiani_. These reached as\r\nlow as the time of pope Alexander III. The subsequent papal decrees,\r\nto the pontificate of Gregory IX, were published in much the same\r\nmethod under the auspices of that pope, about the year 1230, in five\r\nbooks entitled _decretalia Gregorii noni_. A sixth book was added by\r\nBoniface VIII, about the year 1298, which is called _sextus\r\ndecretalium_. The Clementine constitutions, or decrees of Clement V,\r\nwere in like manner authenticated in 1317 by his successor John XXII;\r\nwho also published twenty constitutions of his own, called the\r\n_extravagantes Joannis_: all which in some measure answer to the\r\nnovels of the civil law. To these have been since added some decrees\r\nof later popes in five books, called _extravagantes communes_. And all\r\nthese together, Gratian's decree, Gregory's decretals, the sixth\r\ndecretal, the Clementine constitutions, and the extravagants of John\r\nand his successors, form the _corpus juris canonici_, or body of the\r\nRoman canon law.\r\n\r\nBESIDES these pontificial collections, which during the times of\r\npopery were received as authentic in this island, as well as in other\r\nparts of christendom, there is also a kind of national canon law,\r\ncomposed of _legatine_ and _provincial_ constitutions, and adapted\r\nonly to the exigencies of this church and kingdom. The _legatine_\r\nconstitutions were ecclesiastical laws, enacted in national synods,\r\nheld under the cardinals Otho and Othobon, legates from pope Gregory\r\nIX and pope Adrian IV, in the reign of king Henry III about the years\r\n1220 and 1268. The _provincial_ constitutions are principally the\r\ndecrees of provincial synods, held under divers arch-bishops of\r\nCanterbury, from Stephen Langton in the reign of Henry III to Henry\r\nChichele in the reign of Henry V; and adopted also by the province of\r\nYork[x] in the reign of Henry VI. At the dawn of the reformation, in\r\nthe reign of king Henry VIII, it was enacted in parliament[y] that a\r\nreview should be had of the canon law; and, till such review should be\r\nmade, all canons, constitutions, ordinances, and synodals provincial,\r\nbeing then already made, and not repugnant to the law of the land or\r\nthe king's prerogative, should still be used and executed. And, as no\r\nsuch review has yet been perfected, upon this statute now depends the\r\nauthority of the canon law in England.\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: Burn's eccl. law, pref. viii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Statute 25 Hen. VIII. c. 19; revived and confirmed by 1\r\nEliz. c. 1.]\r\n\r\nAS for the canons enacted by the clergy under James I, in the year\r\n1603, and never confirmed in parliament, it has been solemnly adjudged\r\nupon the principles of law and the constitution, that where they are\r\nnot merely declaratory of the antient canon law, but are introductory\r\nof new regulations, they do not bind the laity[z]; whatever regard the\r\nclergy may think proper to pay them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: Stra. 1057.]\r\n\r\nTHERE are four species of courts in which the civil and canon laws are\r\npermitted under different restrictions to be used. 1. The courts of\r\nthe arch-bishops and bishops and their derivative officers, usually\r\ncalled in our law courts christian, _curiae christianitatis_, or the\r\necclesiastical courts. 2. The military courts. 3. The courts of\r\nadmiralty. 4. The courts of the two universities. In all, their\r\nreception in general, and the different degrees of that reception, are\r\ngrounded intirely upon custom; corroborated in the latter instance by\r\nact of parliament, ratifying those charters which confirm the\r\ncustomary law of the universities. The more minute consideration of\r\nthese will fall properly under that part of these commentaries which\r\ntreats of the jurisdiction of courts. It will suffice at present to\r\nremark a few particulars relative to them all, which may serve to\r\ninculcate more strongly the doctrine laid down concerning them[a].\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: Hale Hist. c. 2.]\r\n\r\n1. AND, first, the courts of common law have the superintendency over\r\nthese courts; to keep them within their jurisdictions, to determine\r\nwherein they exceed them, to restrain and prohibit such excess, and\r\n(in case of contumacy) to punish the officer who executes, and in some\r\ncases the judge who enforces, the sentence so declared to be illegal.\r\n\r\n2. THE common law has reserved to itself the exposition of all such\r\nacts of parliament, as concern either the extent of these courts or\r\nthe matters depending before them. And therefore if these courts\r\neither refuse to allow these acts of parliament, or will expound them\r\nin any other sense than what the common law puts upon them, the king's\r\ncourts at Westminster will grant prohibitions to restrain and control\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n3. AN appeal lies from all these courts to the king, in the last\r\nresort; which proves that the jurisdiction exercised in them is\r\nderived from the crown of England, and not from any foreign potentate,\r\nor intrinsic authority of their own.--And, from these three strong\r\nmarks and ensigns of superiority, it appears beyond a doubt that the\r\ncivil and canon laws, though admitted in some cases by custom in some\r\ncourts, are only subordinate and _leges sub graviori lege_; and that,\r\nthus admitted, restrained, altered, new-modelled, and amended, they\r\nare by no means with us a distinct independent species of laws, but\r\nare inferior branches of the customary or unwritten laws of England,\r\nproperly called, the king's ecclesiastical, the king's military, the\r\nking's maritime, or the king's academical, laws.\r\n\r\nLET us next proceed to the _leges scriptae_, the written laws of the\r\nkingdom, which are statutes, acts, or edicts, made by the king's\r\nmajesty by and with the advice and content of the lords spiritual and\r\ntemporal and commons in parliament assembled[b]. The oldest of these\r\nnow extant, and printed in our statute books, is the famous _magna\r\ncarta_, as confirmed in parliament 9 Hen. III: though doubtless there\r\nwere many acts before that time, the records of which are now lost,\r\nand the determinations of them perhaps at present currently received\r\nfor the maxims of the old common law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: 8 Rep. 20.]\r\n\r\nTHE manner of making these statutes will be better considered\r\nhereafter, when we examine the constitution of parliaments. At present\r\nwe will only take notice of the different kinds of statutes; and of\r\nsome general rules with regard to their construction[c].\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: The method of citing these acts of parliament is various.\r\nMany of our antient statutes are called after the name of the place,\r\nwhere the parliament was held that made them: as the statutes of\r\nMerton and Marlbridge, of Westminster, Glocester, and Winchester.\r\nOthers are denominated entirely from their subject; as the statutes of\r\nWales and Ireland, the _articuli cleri_, and the _praerogativa regis_.\r\nSome are distinguished by their initial words, a method of citing very\r\nantient; being used by the Jews in denominating the books of the\r\npentateuch; by the christian church in distinguishing their hymns and\r\ndivine offices; by the Romanists in describing their papal bulles; and\r\nin short by the whole body of antient civilians and canonists, among\r\nwhom this method of citation generally prevailed, not only with regard\r\nto chapters, but inferior sections also: in imitation of all which we\r\nstill call some of our old statutes by their initial words, as the\r\nstatute of _quia emptores_, and that of _circumspecte agatis_. But the\r\nmost usual method of citing them, especially since the time of Edward\r\nthe second, is by naming the year of the king's reign in which the\r\nstatute was made, together with the chapter, or particular act,\r\naccording to it's numeral order; as, 9 Geo. II. c. 4. For all the acts\r\nof one session of parliament taken together make properly but one\r\nstatute; and therefore when two sessions have been held in one year,\r\nwe usually mention stat. 1. or 2. Thus the bill of rights is cited, as\r\n1 W. & M. st. 2. c. 2. signifying that it is the second chapter or\r\nact, of the second statute or the laws made in the second sessions of\r\nparliament, held in the first year of king William and queen Mary.]\r\n\r\nFIRST, as to their several kinds. Statutes are either _general_ or\r\n_special_, _public_ or _private_. A general or public act is an\r\nuniversal rule, that regards the whole community; and of these the\r\ncourts of law are bound to take notice judicially and _ex officio_;\r\nwithout the statute being particularly pleaded, or formally set forth\r\nby the party who claims an advantage under it. Special or private acts\r\nare rather exceptions than rules, being those which only operate upon\r\nparticular persons, and private concerns; such as the Romans intitled\r\n_senatus-decreta_, in contradistinction to the _senatus-consulta_,\r\nwhich regarded the whole community[d]: and of these the judges are not\r\nbound to take notice, unless they be formally shewn and pleaded. Thus,\r\nto shew the distinction, the statute 13 Eliz. c. 10. to prevent\r\nspiritual persons from making leases for longer terms than twenty one\r\nyears, or three lives, is a public act; it being a rule prescribed to\r\nthe whole body of spiritual persons in the nation: but an act to\r\nenable the bishop of Chester to make a lease to A.B. for sixty years,\r\nis an exception to this rule; it concerns only the parties and the\r\nbishop's successors; and is therefore a private act.\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: Gravin. _Orig._ 1. §. 24.]\r\n\r\nSTATUTES also are either _declaratory_ of the common law, or\r\n_remedial_ of some defects therein. Declaratory, where the old custom\r\nof the kingdom is almost fallen into disuse, or become disputable; in\r\nwhich case the parliament has thought proper, _in perpetuum rei\r\ntestimonium_, and for avoiding all doubts and difficulties, to declare\r\nwhat the common law is and ever hath been. Thus the statute of\r\ntreasons, 25 Edw. III. cap. 2. doth not make any new species of\r\ntreasons; but only, for the benefit of the subject, declares and\r\nenumerates those several kinds of offence, which before were treason\r\nat the common law. Remedial statutes are those which are made to\r\nsupply such defects, and abridge such superfluities, in the common\r\nlaw, as arise either from the general imperfection of all human laws,\r\nfrom change of time and circumstances, from the mistakes and unadvised\r\ndeterminations of unlearned judges, or from any other cause\r\nwhatsoever. And, this being done either by enlarging the common law\r\nwhere it was too narrow and circumscribed, or by restraining it where\r\nit was too lax and luxuriant, this has occasioned another subordinate\r\ndivision of remedial acts of parliament into _enlarging_ and\r\n_restraining_ statutes. To instance again in the case of treason.\r\nClipping the current coin of the kingdom was an offence not\r\nsufficiently guarded against by the common law: therefore it was\r\nthought expedient by statute 5 Eliz. c. 11. to make it high treason,\r\nwhich it was not at the common law: so that this was an _enlarging_\r\nstatute. At common law also spiritual corporations might lease out\r\ntheir estates for any term of years, till prevented by the statute 13\r\nEliz. beforementioned: this was therefore a _restraining_ statute.\r\n\r\nSECONDLY, the rules to be observed with regard to the construction of\r\nstatutes are principally these which follow.\r\n\r\n1. THERE are three points to be considered in the construction of all\r\nremedial statutes; the old law, the mischief, and the remedy: that is,\r\nhow the common law stood at the making of the act; what the mischief\r\nwas, for which the common law did not provide; and what remedy the\r\nparliament hath provided to cure this mischief. And it is the business\r\nof the judges so to construe the act, as to suppress the mischief and\r\nadvance the remedy[e]. Let us instance again in the same restraining\r\nstatute of the 13 Eliz. By the common law ecclesiastical corporations\r\nmight let as long leases as they thought proper: the mischief was,\r\nthat they let long and unreasonable leases, to the impoverishment of\r\ntheir successors: the remedy applied by the statute was by making void\r\nall leases by ecclesiastical bodies for longer terms than three lives\r\nor twenty one years. Now in the construction of this statute it is\r\nheld, that leases, though for a longer term, if made by a bishop, are\r\nnot void during the bishop's life; or, if made by a dean with\r\nconcurrence of his chapter, they are not void during the life of the\r\ndean: for the act was made for the benefit and protection of the\r\nsuccessor[f]. The mischief is therefore sufficiently suppressed by\r\nvacating them after the death of the grantor; but the leases, during\r\ntheir lives, being not within the mischief, are not within the remedy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: 3 Rep. 7 _b._ Co. Litt. 11 _b._ 42.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Co. Litt. 45. 3 Rep. 60.]\r\n\r\n2. A STATUTE, which treats of things or persons of an inferior rank,\r\ncannot by any _general words_ be extended to those of a superior. So a\r\nstatute, treating of \"deans, prebendaries, parsons, vicars, _and\r\nothers having spiritual promotion_,\" is held not to extend to bishops,\r\nthough they have spiritual promotion; deans being the highest persons\r\nnamed, and bishops being of a still higher order[g].\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: 2 Rep. 46.]\r\n\r\n3. PENAL statutes must be construed strictly. Thus a statute 1 Edw.\r\nVI. having enacted that those who are convicted of stealing _horses_\r\nshould not have the benefit of clergy, the judges conceived that this\r\ndid not extend to him that should steal but _one horse_, and therefore\r\nprocured a new act for that purpose in the following year[h]. And, to\r\ncome nearer our own times, by the statute 14 Geo. II. c. 6. stealing\r\nsheep, _or other cattle_, was made felony without benefit of clergy.\r\nBut these general words, \"or other cattle,\" being looked upon as much\r\ntoo loose to create a capital offence, the act was held to extend to\r\nnothing but mere sheep. And therefore, in the next sessions, it was\r\nfound necessary to make another statute, 15 Geo. II. c. 34. extending\r\nthe former to bulls, cows, oxen, steers, bullocks, heifers, calves,\r\nand lambs, by name.\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Bac. Elem. c. 12.]\r\n\r\n4. STATUTES against frauds are to be liberally and beneficially\r\nexpounded. This may seem a contradiction to the last rule; most\r\nstatutes against frauds being in their consequences penal. But this\r\ndifference is here to be taken: where the statute acts upon the\r\noffender, and inflicts a penalty, as the pillory or a fine, it is then\r\nto be taken strictly: but when the statute acts upon the offence, by\r\nsetting aside the fraudulent transaction, here it is to be construed\r\nliberally. Upon this footing the statute of 13 Eliz. c. 5. which\r\navoids all gifts of goods, &c, made to defraud creditors _and\r\nothers_, was held to extend by the general words to a gift made to\r\ndefraud the queen of a forfeiture[i].\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: 3 Rep. 82.]\r\n\r\n5. ONE part of a statute must be so construed by another, that the\r\nwhole may if possible stand: _ut res magis valeat, quam pereat_. As if\r\nland be vested in the king and his heirs by act of parliament, saving\r\nthe right of A; and A has at that time a lease of it for three years:\r\nhere A shall hold it for his term of three years, and afterwards it\r\nshall go to the king. For this interpretation furnishes matter for\r\nevery clause of the statute to work and operate upon. But\r\n\r\n6. A SAVING, totally repugnant to the body of the act, is void. If\r\ntherefore an act of parliament vests land in the king and his heirs,\r\nsaving the right of all persons whatsoever; or vests the land of A in\r\nthe king, saving the right of A: in either of these cases the saving\r\nis totally repugnant to the body of the statute, and (if good) would\r\nrender the statute of no effect or operation; and therefore the saving\r\nis void, and the land vests absolutely in the king[k].\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: 1 Rep. 47.]\r\n\r\n7. WHERE the common law and a statute differ, the common law gives\r\nplace to the statute; and an old statute gives place to a new one. And\r\nthis upon the general principle laid down in the last section, that\r\n\"_leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant_.\" But this is to be\r\nunderstood, only when the latter statute is couched in negative terms,\r\nor by it's matter necessarily implies a negative. As if a former act\r\nsays, that a juror upon such a trial shall have twenty pounds a year;\r\nand a new statute comes and says, he shall have twenty marks: here the\r\nlatter statute, though it does not express, yet necessarily implies a\r\nnegative, and virtually repeals the former. For if twenty marks be\r\nmade qualification sufficient, the former statute which requires\r\ntwenty pounds is at an end[l]. But if both acts be merely affirmative,\r\nand the substance such that both may stand together, here the latter\r\ndoes not repeal the former, but they shall both have a concurrent\r\nefficacy. If by a former law an offence be indictable at the quarter\r\nsessions, and a latter law makes the same offence indictable at the\r\nassises; here the jurisdiction of the sessions is not taken away, but\r\nboth have a concurrent jurisdiction, and the offender may be\r\nprosecuted at either; unless the new statute subjoins express negative\r\nwords, as, that the offence shall be indictable at the assises, _and\r\nnot elsewhere_[m].\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: Jenk. Cent. 2. 73.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: 11 Rep. 63.]\r\n\r\n8. IF a statute, that repeals another, is itself repealed afterwards,\r\nthe first statute is hereby revived, without any formal words for that\r\npurpose. So when the statutes of 26 and 35 Hen. VIII, declaring the\r\nking to be the supreme head of the church, were repealed by a statute\r\n1 & 2 Ph. and Mary, and this latter statute was afterwards repealed by\r\nan act of 1 Eliz. there needed not any express words of revival in\r\nqueen Elizabeth's statute, but these acts of king Henry were impliedly\r\nand virtually revived[n].\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: 4 Inst. 325.]\r\n\r\n9. ACTS of parliament derogatory from the power of subsequent\r\nparliaments bind not. So the statute 11 Hen. VII. c. 1. which directs,\r\nthat no person for assisting a king _de facto_ shall be attainted of\r\ntreason by act of parliament or otherwise, is held to be good only as\r\nto common prosecutions for high treason; but will not restrain or clog\r\nany parliamentary attainder[o]. Because the legislature, being in\r\ntruth the sovereign power, is always of equal, always of absolute\r\nauthority: it acknowleges no superior upon earth, which the prior\r\nlegislature must have been, if it's ordinances could bind the present\r\nparliament. And upon the same principle Cicero, in his letters to\r\nAtticus, treats with a proper contempt these restraining clauses which\r\nendeavour to tie up the hands of succeeding legislatures. \"When you\r\nrepeal the law itself, says he, you at the same time repeal the\r\nprohibitory clause, which guards against such repeal[p].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: 4 Inst. 43.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: _Cum lex abrogatur, illud ipsum abrogatur, quo non eam\r\nabrogari oporteat._ _l._ 3. _ep._ 23.]\r\n\r\n10. LASTLY, acts of parliament that are impossible to be performed are\r\nof no validity; and if there arise out of them collaterally any absurd\r\nconsequences, manifestly contradictory to common reason, they are,\r\nwith regard to those collateral consequences, void. I lay down the\r\nrule with these restrictions; though I know it is generally laid down\r\nmore largely, that acts of parliament contrary to reason are void. But\r\nif the parliament will positively enact a thing to be done which is\r\nunreasonable, I know of no power that can control it: and the examples\r\nusually alleged in support of this sense of the rule do none of them\r\nprove, that where the main object of a statute is unreasonable the\r\njudges are at liberty to reject it; for that were to set the judicial\r\npower above that of the legislature, which would be subversive of all\r\ngovernment. But where some collateral matter arises out of the general\r\nwords, and happens to be unreasonable; there the judges are in decency\r\nto conclude that this consequence was not foreseen by the parliament,\r\nand therefore they are at liberty to expound the statute by equity,\r\nand only _quoad hoc_ disregard it. Thus if an act of parliament gives\r\na man power to try all causes, that arise within his manor of Dale;\r\nyet, if a cause should arise in which he himself is party, the act is\r\nconstrued not to extend to that; because it is unreasonable that any\r\nman should determine his own quarrel[q]. But, if we could conceive it\r\npossible for the parliament to enact, that he should try as well his\r\nown causes as those of other persons, there is no court that has power\r\nto defeat the intent of the legislature, when couched in such evident\r\nand express words, as leave no doubt whether it was the intent of the\r\nlegislature or no.\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: 8 Rep. 118.]\r\n\r\nTHESE are the several grounds of the laws of England: over and above\r\nwhich, equity is also frequently called in to assist, to moderate,\r\nand to explain it. What equity is, and how impossible in it's very\r\nessence to be reduced to stated rules, hath been shewn in the\r\npreceding section. I shall therefore only add, that there are courts\r\nof this kind established for the benefit of the subject, to correct\r\nand soften the rigor of the law, when through it's generality it bears\r\ntoo hard in particular cases; to detect and punish latent frauds,\r\nwhich the law is not minute enough to reach; to enforce the execution\r\nof such matters of trust and confidence, as are binding in conscience,\r\nthough perhaps not strictly legal; to deliver from such dangers as are\r\nowing to misfortune or oversight; and, in short, to relieve in all\r\nsuch cases as are, _bona fide_, objects of relief. This is the\r\nbusiness of our courts of equity, which however are only conversant in\r\nmatters of property. For the freedom of our constitution will not\r\npermit, that in criminal cases a power should be lodged in any judge,\r\nto construe the law otherwise than according to the letter. This\r\ncaution, while it admirably protects the public liberty, can never\r\nbear hard upon individuals. A man cannot suffer _more_ punishment than\r\nthe law assigns, but he may suffer _less_. The laws cannot be strained\r\nby partiality to inflict a penalty beyond what the letter will\r\nwarrant; but in cases where the letter induces any apparent hardship,\r\nthe crown has the power to pardon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION THE FOURTH.\r\n\r\nOF THE COUNTRIES SUBJECT TO THE LAWS OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE kingdom of England, over which our municipal laws have\r\njurisdiction, includes not, by the common law, either Wales, Scotland,\r\nor Ireland, or any other part of the king's dominions, except the\r\nterritory of England only. And yet the civil laws and local customs of\r\nthis territory do now obtain, in part or in all, with more or less\r\nrestrictions, in these and many other adjacent countries; of which it\r\nwill be proper first to take a review, before we consider the kingdom\r\nof England itself, the original and proper subject of these laws.\r\n\r\nWALES had continued independent of England, unconquered and\r\nuncultivated, in the primitive pastoral state which Caesar and Tacitus\r\nascribe to Britain in general, for many centuries; even from the time\r\nof the hostile invasions of the Saxons, when the ancient and christian\r\ninhabitants of the island retired to those natural intrenchments, for\r\nprotection from their pagan visitants. But when these invaders\r\nthemselves were converted to christianity, and settled into regular\r\nand potent governments, this retreat of the antient Britons grew every\r\nday narrower; they were overrun by little and little, gradually driven\r\nfrom one fastness to another, and by repeated losses abridged of their\r\nwild independence. Very early in our history we find their princes\r\ndoing homage to the crown of England; till at length in the reign of\r\nEdward the first, who may justly be stiled the conqueror of Wales, the\r\nline of their antient princes was abolished, and the king of\r\nEngland's eldest son became, as a matter of course, their titular\r\nprince: the territory of Wales being then entirely annexed to the\r\ndominion of the crown of England[a], or, as the statute of Rutland[b]\r\nexpresses it, \"_terra Walliae cum incolis suis, prius regi jure\r\nfeodali subjecta_, (of which homage was the sign) _jam in proprietatis\r\ndominium totaliter et cum integritate conversa est, et coronae regni\r\nAngliae tanquam pars corporis ejusdem annexa et unita_.\" By the\r\nstatute also of Wales[c] very material alterations were made in divers\r\nparts of their laws, so as to reduce them nearer to the English\r\nstandard, especially in the forms of their judicial proceedings: but\r\nthey still retained very much of their original polity, particularly\r\ntheir rule of inheritance, viz. that their lands were divided equally\r\namong all the issue male, and did not descend to the eldest son alone.\r\nBy other subsequent statutes their provincial immunities were still\r\nfarther abridged: but the finishing stroke to their independency, was\r\ngiven by the statute 27 Hen. VIII. c. 26. which at the same time gave\r\nthe utmost advancement to their civil prosperity, by admitting them to\r\na thorough communication of laws with the subjects of England. Thus\r\nwere this brave people gradually conquered into the enjoyment of true\r\nliberty; being insensibly put upon the same footing, and made\r\nfellow-citizens with their conquerors. A generous method of triumph,\r\nwhich the republic of Rome practised with great success; till she\r\nreduced all Italy to her obedience, by admitting the vanquished states\r\nto partake of the Roman privileges.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: Vaugh. 400.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: 10 Edw. I.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: 12 Edw. I.]\r\n\r\nIT is enacted by this statute 27 Hen. VIII, 1. That the dominion of\r\nWales shall be for ever united to the kingdom of England. 2. That all\r\nWelchmen born shall have the same liberties as other the king's\r\nsubjects. 3. That lands in Wales shall be inheritable according to the\r\nEnglish tenures and rules of descent. 4. That the laws of England, and\r\nno other, shall be used in Wales: besides many other regulations of\r\nthe police of this principality. And the statute 34 & 35 Hen. VIII.\r\nc. 26. confirms the same, adds farther regulations, divides it into\r\ntwelve shires, and, in short, reduces it into the same order in which\r\nit stands at this day; differing from the kingdom of England in only a\r\nfew particulars, and those too of the nature of privileges, (such as\r\nhaving courts within itself, independent of the process of Westminster\r\nhall) and some other immaterial peculiarities, hardly more than are to\r\nbe found in many counties of England itself.\r\n\r\nTHE kingdom of Scotland, notwithstanding the union of the crowns on\r\nthe accession of their king James VI to that of England, continued an\r\nentirely separate and distinct kingdom for above a century, though an\r\nunion had been long projected; which was judged to be the more easy to\r\nbe done, as both kingdoms were antiently under the same government,\r\nand still retained a very great resemblance, though far from an\r\nidentity, in their laws. By an act of parliament 1 Jac. I. c. 1. it is\r\ndeclared, that these two, mighty, famous, and antient kingdoms were\r\nformerly one. And sir Edward Coke observes[d], how marvellous a\r\nconformity there was, not only in the religion and language of the two\r\nnations, but also in their antient laws, the descent of the crown,\r\ntheir parliaments, their titles of nobility, their officers of state\r\nand of justice, their writs, their customs, and even the language of\r\ntheir laws. Upon which account he supposes the common law of each to\r\nhave been originally the same, especially as their most antient and\r\nauthentic book, called _regiam majestatem_ and containing the rules of\r\n_their_ antient common law, is extremely similar that of Glanvil,\r\nwhich contains the principles of _ours_, as it stood in the reign of\r\nHenry II. And the many diversities, subsisting between the two laws at\r\npresent, may be well enough accounted for, from a diversity of\r\npractice in two large and uncommunicating jurisdictions, and from the\r\nacts of two distinct and independent parliaments, which have in many\r\npoints altered and abrogated the old common law of both kingdoms.\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: 4 Inst. 345.]\r\n\r\nHOWEVER sir Edward Coke, and the politicians of that time, conceived\r\ngreat difficulties in carrying on the projected union: but these were\r\nat length overcome, and the great work was happily effected in 1707, 5\r\nAnne; when twenty five articles of union were agreed to by the\r\nparliaments of both nations: the purport of the most considerable\r\nbeing as follows:\r\n\r\n1. THAT on the first of May 1707, and for ever after, the kingdoms of\r\nEngland and Scotland, shall be united into one kingdom, by the name of\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\n2. THE succession to the monarchy of Great Britain shall be the same\r\nas was before settled with regard to that of England.\r\n\r\n3. THE united kingdom shall be represented by one parliament.\r\n\r\n4. THERE shall be a communication of all rights and privileges between\r\nthe subjects of both kingdoms, except where it is otherwise agreed.\r\n\r\n9. WHEN England raises 2,000,000_l._ by a land tax, Scotland shall\r\nraise 48,000_l._\r\n\r\n16, 17. THE standards of the coin, of weights, and of measures, shall\r\nbe reduced to those of England, throughout the united kingdoms.\r\n\r\n18. THE laws relating to trade, customs, and the excise, shall be the\r\nsame in Scotland as in England. But all the other laws of Scotland\r\nshall remain in force; but alterable by the parliament of Great\r\nBritain. Yet with this caution; that laws relating to public policy\r\nare alterable at the discretion of the parliament; laws relating to\r\nprivate rights are not to be altered but for the evident utility of\r\nthe people of Scotland.\r\n\r\n22. SIXTEEN peers are to be chosen to represent the peerage of\r\nScotland in parliament, and forty five members to sit in the house of\r\ncommons.\r\n\r\n23. THE sixteen peers of Scotland shall have all privileges of\r\nparliament: and all peers of Scotland shall be peers of Great Britain,\r\nand rank next after those of the same degree at the time of the union,\r\nand shall have all privileges of peers, except sitting in the house of\r\nlords and voting on the trial of a peer.\r\n\r\nTHESE are the principal of the twenty five articles of union, which\r\nare ratified and confirmed by statute 5 Ann. c. 8. in which statute\r\nthere are also two acts of parliament recited; the one of Scotland,\r\nwhereby the church of Scotland, and also the four universities of that\r\nkingdom, are established for ever, and all succeeding sovereigns are\r\nto take an oath inviolably to maintain the same; the other of England,\r\n5 Ann. c. 6. whereby the acts of uniformity of 13 Eliz. and 13 Car.\r\nII. (except as the same had been altered by parliament at that time)\r\nand all other acts then in force for the preservation of the church of\r\nEngland, are declared perpetual; and it is stipulated, that every\r\nsubsequent king and queen shall take an oath inviolably to maintain\r\nthe same within England, Ireland, Wales, and the town of Berwick upon\r\nTweed. And it is enacted, that these two acts \"shall for ever be\r\nobserved as fundamental and essential conditions of the union.\"\r\n\r\nUPON these articles, and act of union, it is to be observed, 1. That\r\nthe two kingdoms are now so inseparably united, that nothing can ever\r\ndisunite them again, but an infringement of those points which, when\r\nthey were separate and independent nations, it was mutually stipulated\r\nshould be \"fundamental and essential conditions of the union.\" 2. That\r\nwhatever else may be deemed \"fundamental and essential conditions,\"\r\nthe preservation of the two churches, of England and Scotland, in the\r\nsame state that they were in at the time of the union, and the\r\nmaintenance of the acts of uniformity which establish our common\r\nprayer, are expressly declared so to be. 3. That therefore any\r\nalteration in the constitutions of either of those churches, or in the\r\nliturgy of the church of England, would be an infringement of these\r\n\"fundamental and essential conditions,\" and greatly endanger the\r\nunion. 4. That the municipal laws of Scotland are ordained to be still\r\nobserved in that part of the island, unless altered by parliament;\r\nand, as the parliament has not yet thought proper, except in a few\r\ninstances, to alter them, they still (with regard to the particulars\r\nunaltered) continue in full force. Wherefore the municipal or common\r\nlaws of England are, generally speaking, of no force or validity in\r\nScotland; and, of consequence, in the ensuing commentaries, we shall\r\nhave very little occasion to mention, any farther than sometimes by\r\nway of illustration, the municipal laws of that part of the united\r\nkingdoms.\r\n\r\nTHE town of Berwick upon Tweed, though subject to the crown of England\r\never since the conquest of it in the reign of Edward IV, is not part\r\nof the kingdom of England, nor subject to the common law; though it is\r\nsubject to all acts of parliament, being represented by burgesses\r\ntherein. And therefore it was declared by statute 20 Geo. II. c. 42.\r\nthat where England only is mentioned in any act of parliament, the\r\nsame notwithstanding shall be deemed to comprehend the dominion of\r\nWales, and town of Berwick upon Tweed. But the general law there used\r\nis the Scots law, and the ordinary process of the courts of\r\nWestminster-hall is there of no authority[e].\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: 1 Sid. 382. 2 Show. 365.]\r\n\r\nAS to Ireland, that is still a distinct kingdom; though a dependent,\r\nsubordinate kingdom. It was only entitled the dominion or lordship of\r\nIreland[f], and the king's stile was no other than _dominus\r\nHiberniae_, lord of Ireland, till the thirty third year of king Henry\r\nthe eighth; when he assumed the title of king, which is recognized by\r\nact of parliament 35 Hen. VIII. c. 3. But, as Scotland and England are\r\nnow one and the same kingdom, and yet differ in their municipal laws;\r\nso England and Ireland are, on the other hand, distinct kingdoms, and\r\nyet in general agree in their laws. The inhabitants of Ireland are,\r\nfor the most part, descended from the English, who planted it as a\r\nkind of colony, after the conquest of it by king Henry the second, at\r\nwhich time they carried over the English laws along with them. And as\r\nIreland, thus conquered, planted, and governed, still continues in a\r\nstate of dependence, it must necessarily conform to, and be obliged by\r\nsuch laws as the superior state thinks proper to prescribe.\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: _Stat. Hiberniae._ 14 Hen. III.]\r\n\r\nAT the time of this conquest the Irish were governed by what they\r\ncalled the Brehon law, so stiled from the Irish name of judges, who\r\nwere denominated Brehons[g]. But king John in the twelfth year of his\r\nreign went into Ireland, and carried over with him many able sages of\r\nthe law; and there by his letters patent, in right of the dominion of\r\nconquest, is said to have ordained and established that Ireland should\r\nbe governed by the laws of England[h]: which letters patent sir Edward\r\nCoke[i] apprehends to have been there confirmed in parliament. But to\r\nthis ordinance many of the Irish were averse to conform, and still\r\nstuck to their Brehon law: so that both Henry the third[k] and Edward\r\nthe first[l] were obliged to renew the injunction; and at length in a\r\nparliament holden at Kilkenny, 40 Edw. III, under Lionel duke of\r\nClarence, the then lieutenant of Ireland, the Brehon law was formally\r\nabolished, it being unanimously declared to be indeed no law, but a\r\nlewd custom crept in of later times. And yet, even in the reign of\r\nqueen Elizabeth, the wild natives still kept and preserved their\r\nBrehon law; which is described[m] to have been \"a rule of right\r\nunwritten, but delivered by tradition from one to another, in which\r\noftentimes there appeared great shew of equity in determining the\r\nright between party and party, but in many things repugnant quite\r\nboth to God's law and man's.\" The latter part of which character is\r\nalone allowed it under Edward the first and his grandson.\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: 4 Inst. 358.

Rec. 1218.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: Edm. Spenser. _ibid._]\r\n\r\nBUT as Ireland was a distinct dominion, and had parliaments of it's\r\nown, it is to be observed, that though the immemorial customs, or\r\ncommon law, of England were made the rule of justice in Ireland also,\r\nyet no acts of the English parliament, since the twelfth of king John,\r\nextended into that kingdom; unless it were specially named, or\r\nincluded under general words, such as, \"within any of the king's\r\ndominions.\" And this is particularly expressed, and the reason given\r\nin the year book[n]: \"Ireland hath a parliament of it's own, and\r\nmaketh and altereth laws; and our statutes do not bind them, because\r\nthey do not send representatives to our parliament: but their persons\r\nare the king's subjects, like as the inhabitants of Calais, Gascoigny,\r\nand Guienne, while they continued under the king's subjection.\" The\r\nmethod made use of in Ireland, as stated by sir Edward Coke[o], of\r\nmaking statutes in their parliaments, according to Poynings' law, of\r\nwhich hereafter, is this: 1. The lord lieutenant and council of\r\nIreland must certify to the king under the great seal of Ireland the\r\nacts proposed to be passed. 2. The king and council of England are to\r\nconsider, approve, alter, or reject the said acts; and certify them\r\nback again under the great seal of England. And then, 3. They are to\r\nbe proposed, received, or rejected in the parliament of Ireland. By\r\nthis means nothing was left to the parliament in Ireland, but a bare\r\nnegative or power of rejecting, not of proposing, any law. But the\r\nusage now is, that bills are often framed in either house of\r\nparliament under the denomination of heads for a bill or bills; and in\r\nthat shape they are offered to the consideration of the lord\r\nlieutenant and privy council, who then reject them at pleasure,\r\nwithout transmitting them to England.\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: 2 Ric. III. pl. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: 4 Inst. 353.]\r\n\r\nBUT the Irish nation, being excluded from the benefit of the English\r\nstatutes, were deprived of many good and profitable laws, made for\r\nthe improvement of the common law: and, the measure of justice in both\r\nkingdoms becoming thereby no longer uniform, therefore in the 10 Hen.\r\nVII. a set of statutes passed in Ireland, (sir Edward Poynings being\r\nthen lord deputy, whence it is called Poynings' law) by which it was,\r\namong other things, enacted, that all acts of parliament before made\r\nin England, should be of force within the realm of Ireland[p]. But, by\r\nthe same rule that no laws made in England, between king John's time\r\nand Poynings' law, were then binding in Ireland, it follows that no\r\nacts of the English parliament made since the 10 Hen. VII. do now bind\r\nthe people of Ireland, unless specially named or included under\r\ngeneral words[q]. And on the other hand it is equally clear, that\r\nwhere Ireland is particularly named, or is included under general\r\nwords, they are bound by such acts of parliament. For this follows\r\nfrom the very nature and constitution of a dependent state: dependence\r\nbeing very little else, but an obligation to conform to the will or\r\nlaw of that superior person or state, upon which the inferior depends.\r\nThe original and true ground of this superiority is the right of\r\nconquest: a right allowed by the law of nations, if not by that of\r\nnature; and founded upon a compact either expressly or tacitly made\r\nbetween the conqueror and the conquered, that if they will acknowlege\r\nthe victor for their master, he will treat them for the future as\r\nsubjects, and not as enemies[r].\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: 4 Inst. 351.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: 12 Rep. 112.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Puff. L. of N. 8. 6. 24.]\r\n\r\nBUT this state of dependence being almost forgotten, and ready to be\r\ndisputed by the Irish nation, it became necessary some years ago to\r\ndeclare how that matter really stood: and therefore by statute 6 Geo.\r\nI. c. 5. it is declared, that the kingdom of Ireland ought to be\r\nsubordinate to, and dependent upon, the imperial crown of Great\r\nBritain, as being inseparably united thereto; and that the king's\r\nmajesty, with the consent of the lords and commons of Great Britain in\r\nparliament, hath power to make laws to bind the people of Ireland.\r\n\r\nTHUS we see how extensively the laws of Ireland communicate with those\r\nof England: and indeed such communication is highly necessary, as the\r\nultimate resort from the courts of justice in Ireland is, as in Wales,\r\nto those in England; a writ of error (in the nature of an appeal)\r\nlying from the king's bench in Ireland to the king's bench in\r\nEngland[s], as the appeal from all other courts in Ireland lies\r\nimmediately to the house of lords here: it being expressly declared,\r\nby the same statute 6 Geo. I. c. 5. that the peers of Ireland have no\r\njurisdiction to affirm or reverse any judgments or decrees whatsoever.\r\nThe propriety, and even necessity, in all inferior dominions, of this\r\nconstitution, \"that, though justice be in general administred by\r\ncourts of their own, yet that the appeal in the last resort ought to\r\nbe to the courts of the superior state,\" is founded upon these two\r\nreasons. 1. Because otherwise the law, appointed or permitted to such\r\ninferior dominion, might be insensibly changed within itself, without\r\nthe assent of the superior. 2. Because otherwise judgments might be\r\ngiven to the disadvantage or diminution of the superiority; or to make\r\nthe dependence to be only of the person of the king, and not of the\r\ncrown of England[t].\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: This was law in the time of Hen. VIII. as appears by the\r\nantient book, entituled, _diversity of courts, c. bank le roy_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: Vaugh. 402.]\r\n\r\nWITH regard to the other adjacent islands which are subject to the\r\ncrown of Great Britain, some of them (as the isle of Wight, of\r\nPortland, of Thanet, &c.) are comprized within some neighbouring\r\ncounty, and are therefore to be looked upon as annexed to the mother\r\nisland, and part of the kingdom of England. But there are others,\r\nwhich require a more particular consideration.\r\n\r\nAND, first, the isle of Man is a distinct territory from England and\r\nis not governed by our laws; neither doth any act of parliament extend\r\nto it, unless it be particularly named therein; and then an act of\r\nparliament is binding there[u]. It was formerly a subordinate\r\nfeudatory kingdom, subject to the kings of Norway; then to king John\r\nand Henry III of England; afterwards to the kings of Scotland; and\r\nthen again to the crown of England: and at length we find king Henry\r\nIV claiming the island by right of conquest, and disposing of it to\r\nthe earl of Northumberland; upon whose attainder it was granted (by\r\nthe name of the lordship of Man) to sir John de Stanley by letters\r\npatent 7 Hen. IV[w]. In his lineal descendants it continued for eight\r\ngenerations, till the death of Ferdinando earl of Derby, _A.D._ 1594;\r\nwhen a controversy arose concerning the inheritance thereof, between\r\nhis daughters and William his surviving brother: upon which, and a\r\ndoubt that was started concerning the validity of the original\r\npatent[x], the island was seised into the queen's hands, and\r\nafterwards various grants were made of it by king James the first; all\r\nwhich being expired or surrendered, it was granted afresh in 7 Jac. I.\r\nto William earl of Derby, and the heirs male of his body, with\r\nremainder to his heirs general; which grant was the next year\r\nconfirmed by act of parliament, with a restraint of the power of\r\nalienation by the said earl and his issue male. On the death of James\r\nearl of Derby, _A.D._ 1735, the male line of earl William failing, the\r\nduke of Atholl succeeded to the island as heir general by a female\r\nbranch. In the mean time, though the title of king had long been\r\ndisused, the earls of Derby, as lords of Man, had maintained a sort of\r\nroyal authority therein; by assenting or dissenting to laws, and\r\nexercising an appellate jurisdiction. Yet, though no English writ, or\r\nprocess from the courts of Westminster, was of any authority in Man,\r\nan appeal lay from a decree of the lord of the island to the king of\r\nGreat Britain in council[y]. But, the distinct jurisdiction of this\r\nlittle subordinate royalty being found inconvenient for the purposes\r\nof public justice, and for the revenue, (it affording a convenient\r\nasylum for debtors, outlaws, and smugglers) authority was given to the\r\ntreasury by statute 12 Geo. I. c. 28. to purchase the interest of the\r\nthen proprietors for the use of the crown: which purchase hath at\r\nlength been completed in this present year 1765, and confirmed by\r\nstatutes 5 Geo. III. c. 26, & 39. whereby the whole island and all\r\nit's dependencies, so granted as aforesaid, (except the landed\r\nproperty of the Atholl family, their manerial rights and emoluments,\r\nand the patronage of the bishoprick[z] and other ecclesiastical\r\nbenefices) are unalienably vested in the crown, and subjected to the\r\nregulations of the British excise and customs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: 4 Inst. 284. 2 And. 116.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: Selden. tit. hon. 1. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: Camden. Eliz. _A.D._ 1594.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: 1 P.W. 329.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: The bishoprick of Man, or Sodor, or Sodor and Man, was\r\nformerly within the province of Canterbury, but annexed to that of\r\nYork by statute 33 Hen. VIII. c. 31.]\r\n\r\nTHE islands of Jersey, Guernsey, Sark, Alderney, and their appendages,\r\nwere parcel of the duchy of Normandy, and were united to the crown of\r\nEngland by the first princes of the Norman line. They are governed by\r\ntheir own laws, which are for the most part the ducal customs of\r\nNormandy, being collected in an antient book of very great authority,\r\nentituled, _le grand coustumier_. The king's writ, or process from the\r\ncourts of Westminster, is there of no force; but his commission is.\r\nThey are not bound by common acts of our parliaments, unless\r\nparticularly named[a]. All causes are originally determined by their\r\nown officers, the bailiffs and jurats of the islands; but an appeal\r\nlies from them to the king in council, in the last resort.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: 4 Inst. 286.]\r\n\r\nBESIDES these adjacent islands, our more distant plantations in\r\nAmerica, and elsewhere, are also in some respects subject to the\r\nEnglish laws. Plantations, or colonies in distant countries, are\r\neither such where the lands are claimed by right of occupancy only, by\r\nfinding them desart and uncultivated, and peopling them from the\r\nmother country; or where, when already cultivated, they have been\r\neither gained by conquest, or ceded to us by treaties. And both these\r\nrights are founded upon the law of nature, or at least upon that of\r\nnations. But there is a difference between these two species of\r\ncolonies, with respect to the laws by which they are bound. For it is\r\nheld[b], that if an uninhabited country be discovered and planted by\r\nEnglish subjects, all the English laws are immediately there in\r\nforce. For as the law is the birthright of every subject, so wherever\r\nthey go they carry their laws with them[c]. But in conquered or ceded\r\ncountries, that have already laws of their own, the king may indeed\r\nalter and change those laws; but, till he does actually change them,\r\nthe antient laws of the country remain, unless such as are against the\r\nlaw of God, as in the case of an infidel country[d].\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Salk. 411. 666.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: 2 P. Wms. 75.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: 7 Rep. 17 _b._ Calvin's case. Show. Parl. C. 31.]\r\n\r\nOUR American plantations are principally of this latter sort, being\r\nobtained in the last century either by right of conquest and driving\r\nout the natives (with what natural justice I shall not at present\r\nenquire) or by treaties. And therefore the common law of England, as\r\nsuch, has no allowance or authority there; they being no part of the\r\nmother country, but distinct (though dependent) dominions. They are\r\nsubject however to the control of the parliament; though (like\r\nIreland, Man, and the rest) not bound by any acts of parliament,\r\nunless particularly named. The form of government in most of them is\r\nborrowed from that of England. They have a governor named by the king,\r\n(or in some proprietary colonies by the proprietor) who is his\r\nrepresentative or deputy. They have courts of justice of their own,\r\nfrom whose decisions an appeal lies to the king in council here in\r\nEngland. Their general assemblies which are their house of commons,\r\ntogether with their council of state being their upper house, with the\r\nconcurrence of the king or his representative the governor, make laws\r\nsuited to their own emergencies. But it is particularly declared by\r\nstatute 7 & 8 W. III. c. 22. That all laws, by-laws, usages, and\r\ncustoms, which shall be in practice in any of the plantations,\r\nrepugnant to any law, made or to be made in this kingdom relative to\r\nthe said plantations, shall be utterly void and of none effect.\r\n\r\nTHESE are the several parts of the dominions of the crown of Great\r\nBritain, in which the municipal laws of England are not of force or\r\nauthority, merely _as_ the municipal laws of England. Most of them\r\nhave probably copied the spirit of their own law from this original;\r\nbut then it receives it's obligation, and authoritative force, from\r\nbeing the law of the country.\r\n\r\nAS to any foreign dominions which may belong to the person of the king\r\nby hereditary descent, by purchase, or other acquisition, as the\r\nterritory of Hanover, and his majesty's other property in Germany; as\r\nthese do not in any wise appertain to the crown of these kingdoms,\r\nthey are entirely unconnected with the laws of England, and do not\r\ncommunicate with this nation in any respect whatsoever. The English\r\nlegislature had wisely remarked the inconveniences that had formerly\r\nresulted from dominions on the continent of Europe; from the Norman\r\nterritory which William the conqueror brought with him, and held in\r\nconjunction with the English throne; and from Anjou, and it's\r\nappendages, which fell to Henry the second by hereditary descent. They\r\nhad seen the nation engaged for near four hundred years together in\r\nruinous wars for defence of these foreign dominions; till, happily for\r\nthis country, they were lost under the reign of Henry the sixth. They\r\nobserved that from that time the maritime interests of England were\r\nbetter understood and more closely pursued: that, in consequence of\r\nthis attention, the nation, as soon as she had rested from her civil\r\nwars, began at this period to flourish all at once; and became much\r\nmore considerable in Europe than when her princes were possessed of a\r\nlarger territory, and her counsels distracted by foreign interests.\r\nThis experience and these considerations gave birth to a conditional\r\nclause in the act[e] of settlement, which vested the crown in his\r\npresent majesty's illustrious house, \"That in case the crown and\r\nimperial dignity of this realm shall hereafter come to any person not\r\nbeing a native of this kingdom of England, this nation shall not be\r\nobliged to engage in any war for the defence of any dominions or\r\nterritories which do not belong to the crown of England, without\r\nconsent of parliament.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Stat. 12 & 13 W. III. c. 3.]\r\n\r\nWE come now to consider the kingdom of England in particular, the\r\ndirect and immediate subject of those laws, concerning which we are to\r\ntreat in the ensuing commentaries. And this comprehends not only\r\nWales, of which enough has been already said, but also part of the\r\nsea. The main or high seas are part of the realm of England, for\r\nthereon our courts of admiralty have jurisdiction, as will be shewn\r\nhereafter; but they are not subject to the common law[f]. This main\r\nsea begins at the low-water-mark. But between the high-water-mark, and\r\nthe low-water-mark, where the sea ebbs and flows, the common law and\r\nthe admiralty have _divisum imperium_, an alternate jurisdiction; one\r\nupon the water, when it is full sea; the other upon the land, when it\r\nis an ebb[g].\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Co. Litt. 260.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Finch. L. 78.]\r\n\r\nTHE territory of England is liable to two divisions; the one\r\necclesiastical, the other civil.\r\n\r\n1. THE ecclesiastical division is, primarily, into two provinces,\r\nthose of Canterbury and York. A province is the circuit of an\r\narch-bishop's jurisdiction. Each province contains divers dioceses, or\r\nsees of suffragan bishops; whereof Canterbury includes twenty one, and\r\nYork three; besides the bishoprick of the isle of Man, which was\r\nannexed to the province of York by king Henry VIII. Every diocese is\r\ndivided into archdeaconries, whereof there are sixty in all; each\r\narchdeaconry into rural deanries, which are the circuit of the\r\narchdeacon's and rural dean's jurisdiction, of whom hereafter; and\r\nevery deanry is divided into parishes[h].\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Co. Litt. 94.]\r\n\r\nA PARISH is that circuit of ground in which the souls under the care\r\nof one parson or vicar do inhabit. These are computed to be near ten\r\nthousand in number. How antient the division of parishes is, may at\r\npresent be difficult to ascertain; for it seems to be agreed on all\r\nhands, that in the early ages of christianity in this island, parishes\r\nwere unknown, or at least signified the same that a diocese does now.\r\nThere was then no appropriation of ecclesiastical dues to any\r\nparticular church; but every man was at liberty to contribute his\r\ntithes to whatever priest or church he pleased, provided only that he\r\ndid it to some: or, if he made no special appointment or appropriation\r\nthereof, they were paid into the hands of the bishop, whose duty it\r\nwas to distribute them among the clergy and for other pious purposes\r\naccording to his own discretion[i].\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: Seld. of tith. 9. 4. 2 Inst. 646. Hob. 296.]\r\n\r\nMR Camden[k] says England was divided into parishes by arch-bishop\r\nHonorius about the year 630. Sir Henry Hobart[l] lays it down that\r\nparishes were first erected by the council of Lateran, which was held\r\n_A.D._ 1179. Each widely differing from the other, and both of them\r\nperhaps from the truth; which will probably be found in the medium\r\nbetween the two extremes. For Mr Selden has clearly shewn[m], that the\r\nclergy lived in common without any division of parishes, long after\r\nthe time mentioned by Camden. And it appears from the Saxon laws, that\r\nparishes were in being long before the date of that council of\r\nLateran, to which they are ascribed by Hobart.\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: in his Britannia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: Hob. 296.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: of tithes. c. 9.]\r\n\r\nWE find the distinction of parishes, nay even of mother-churches, so\r\nearly as in the laws of king Edgar, about the year 970. Before that\r\ntime the consecration of tithes was in general _arbitrary_; that is,\r\nevery man paid his own (as was before observed) to what church or\r\nparish he pleased. But this being liable to be attended with either\r\nfraud, or at least caprice, in the persons paying; and with either\r\njealousies or mean compliances in such as were competitors for\r\nreceiving them; it was now ordered by the law of king Edgar[n], that\r\n\"_dentur omnes decimae primariae ecclesiae ad quam parochia\r\npertinet_.\" However, if any thane, or great lord, had a church within\r\nhis own demesnes, distinct from the mother-church, in the nature of a\r\nprivate chapel; then, provided such church had a coemitery or\r\nconsecrated place of burial belonging to it, he might allot one third\r\nof his tithes for the maintenance of the officiating minister: but, if\r\nit had no coemitery, the thane must himself have maintained his\r\nchaplain by some other means; for in such case _all_ his tithes were\r\nordained to be paid to the _primariae ecclesiae_ or mother-church[o].\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: _c._ 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: _Ibid._ _c._ 2. See also the laws of king Canute, c. 11.\r\nabout the year 1030.]\r\n\r\nTHIS proves that the kingdom was then universally divided into\r\nparishes; which division happened probably not all at once, but by\r\ndegrees. For it seems pretty clear and certain that the boundaries of\r\nparishes were originally ascertained by those of a manor or manors:\r\nsince it very seldom happens that a manor extends itself over more\r\nparishes than one, though there are often many manors in one parish.\r\nThe lords, as christianity spread itself, began to build churches upon\r\ntheir own demesnes or wastes, to accommodate their tenants in one or\r\ntwo adjoining lordships; and, in order to have divine service\r\nregularly performed therein, obliged all their tenants to appropriate\r\ntheir tithes to the maintenance of the one officiating minister,\r\ninstead of leaving them at liberty to distribute them among the clergy\r\nof the diocese in general: and this tract of land, the tithes whereof\r\nwere so appropriated, formed a distinct parish. Which will well enough\r\naccount for the frequent intermixture of parishes one with another.\r\nFor if a lord had a parcel of land detached from the main of his\r\nestate, but not sufficient to form a parish of itself, it was natural\r\nfor him to endow his newly erected church with the tithes of those\r\ndisjointed lands; especially if no church was then built in any\r\nlordship adjoining to those out-lying parcels.\r\n\r\nTHUS parishes were gradually formed, and parish churches endowed with\r\nthe tithes that arose within the circuit assigned. But some lands,\r\neither because they were in the hands of irreligious and careless\r\nowners, or were situate in forests and desart places, or for other\r\nnow unsearchable reasons, were never united to any parish, and\r\ntherefore continue to this day extraparochial; and their tithes are\r\nnow by immemorial custom payable to the king instead of the bishop, in\r\ntrust and confidence that he will distribute them, for the general\r\ngood of the church[p]. And thus much for the ecclesiastical division\r\nof this kingdom.\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: 2 Inst. 647. 2 Rep. 44. Cro. Eliz. 512.]\r\n\r\n2. THE civil division of the territory of England is into counties, of\r\nthose counties into hundreds, of those hundreds into tithings or\r\ntowns. Which division, as it now stands, seems to owe it's original to\r\nking Alfred; who, to prevent the rapines and disorders which formerly\r\nprevailed in the realm, instituted tithings; so called, from the\r\nSaxon, because _ten_ freeholders with their families composed one.\r\nThese all dwelt together, and were sureties or free pledges to the\r\nking for the good behaviour of each other; and, if any offence were\r\ncommitted in their district, they were bound to have the offender\r\nforthcoming[q]. And therefore antiently no man was suffered to abide\r\nin England above forty days, unless he were enrolled in some tithing\r\nor decennary[r]. One of the principal inhabitants of the tithing is\r\nannually appointed to preside over the rest, being called the\r\ntithing-man, the headborough, (words which speak their own etymology)\r\nand in some countries the borsholder, or borough's-ealder, being\r\nsupposed the discreetest man in the borough, town, or tithing[s].\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: _Flet._ 1. 47. This the laws of king Edward the\r\nconfessor, c. 20. very justly intitle \"_summa et maxima securitas, per\r\nquam omnes statu firmissimo sustinentur;--quae hoc modo fiebat, quod\r\nsub decennali fidejussione debebant esse universi, &c._\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Mirr. c. 1. §. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: Finch. L. 8.]\r\n\r\nTITHINGS, towns, or vills, are of the same signification in law; and\r\nhad, each of them, originally a church and celebration of divine\r\nservice, sacraments, and burials; which to have, or have had, separate\r\nto itself, is the essential distinction of a town, according to sir\r\nEdward Coke[t]. The word _town_ or _vill_ is indeed, by the alteration\r\nof times and language, now become a generical term, comprehending\r\nunder it the several species of cities, boroughs, and common towns. A\r\ncity is a town incorporated, which is or hath been the see of a\r\nbishop; and though the bishoprick be dissolved, as at Westminster, yet\r\nstill it remaineth a city[u]. A borough is now understood to be a\r\ntown, either corporate or not, that sendeth burgesses to\r\nparliament[w]. Other towns there are, to the number sir Edward Coke\r\nsays[x] of 8803, which are neither cities nor boroughs; some of which\r\nhave the privileges of markets, and others not; but both are equally\r\ntowns in law. To several of these towns there are small appendages\r\nbelonging, called hamlets; which are taken notice of in the statute of\r\nExeter[y], which makes frequent mention of entire vills, demi-vills,\r\nand hamlets. Entire vills sir Henry Spelman[z] conjectures to have\r\nconsisted of ten freemen, or frank-pledges, demi-vills of five, and\r\nhamlets of less than five. These little collections of houses are\r\nsometimes under the same administration as the town itself, sometimes\r\ngoverned by separate officers; in which last case it is, to some\r\npurposes in law, looked upon as a distinct township. These towns, as\r\nwas before hinted, contained each originally but one parish, and one\r\ntithing; though many of them now, by the encrease of inhabitants, are\r\ndivided into several parishes and tithings: and sometimes, where there\r\nis but one parish there are two or more vills or tithings.\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: 1 Inst. 115 _b._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: Co. Litt. 109 _b._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: Litt. §. 164.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: 1 Inst. 116.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: 14 Edw. I.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: Gloss. 274.]\r\n\r\nAS ten families of freeholders made up a town or tithing, so ten\r\ntithings composed a superior division, called a hundred, as consisting\r\nof ten times ten families. The hundred is governed by an high\r\nconstable or bailiff, and formerly there was regularly held in it the\r\nhundred court for the trial of causes, though now fallen into disuse.\r\nIn some of the more northern counties these hundreds are called\r\nwapentakes[a].\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: Seld. _in Fortesc._ _c._ 24.]\r\n\r\nTHE subdivision of hundreds into tithings seems to be most peculiarly\r\nthe invention of Alfred: the institution of hundreds themselves he\r\nrather introduced than invented. For they seem to have obtained in\r\nDenmark[b]: and we find that in France a regulation of this sort was\r\nmade above two hundred years before; set on foot by Clotharius and\r\nChildebert, with a view of obliging each district to answer for the\r\nrobberies committed in it's own division. These divisions were, in\r\nthat country, as well military as civil; and each contained a hundred\r\nfreemen; who were subject to an officer called the _centenarius_; a\r\nnumber of which _centenarii_ were themselves subject to a superior\r\nofficer called the count or _comes_[c]. And indeed this institution of\r\nhundreds may be traced back as far as the antient Germans, from whom\r\nwere derived both the Franks who became masters of Gaul, and the\r\nSaxons who settled in England. For we read in Tacitus[d], that both\r\nthe thing and the name were well known to that warlike people.\r\n\"_Centeni ex singulis pagis sunt, idque ipsum inter suos vocantur; et\r\nquod primo numerus fuit, jam nomen et honor est._\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Seld. tit. of hon. 2. 5. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Montesq. Sp. L. 30. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: _de morib. German._ 6.]\r\n\r\nAN indefinite number of these hundreds make up a county or shire.\r\nShire is a Saxon word signifying a division; but a county,\r\n_comitatus_, is plainly derived from _comes_, the count of the Franks;\r\nthat is, the earl, or alderman (as the Saxons called him) of the\r\nshire, to whom the government of it was intrusted. This he usually\r\nexercised by his deputy, still called in Latin _vice-comes_, and in\r\nEnglish the sheriff, shrieve, or shire-reeve, signifying the officer\r\nof the shire; upon whom by process of time the civil administration of\r\nit is now totally devolved. In some counties there is an intermediate\r\ndivision, between the shire and the hundreds, as lathes in Kent, and\r\nrapes in Sussex, each of them containing about three or four hundreds\r\napiece. These had formerly their lathe-reeves and rape-reeves, acting\r\nin subordination to the shire-reeve. Where a county is divided into\r\n_three_ of these intermediate jurisdictions, they are called\r\ntrithings[e], which were antiently governed by a trithing-reeve. These\r\ntrithings still subsist in the large county of York, where by an easy\r\ncorruption they are denominated ridings; the north, the east, and the\r\nwest-riding. The number of counties in England and Wales have been\r\ndifferent at different times: at present there are forty in England,\r\nand twelve in Wales.\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: _LL. Edw._ _c._ 34.]\r\n\r\nTHREE of these counties, Chester, Durham, and Lancaster, are called\r\ncounties palatine. The two former are such by prescription, or\r\nimmemorial custom; or, at least as old as the Norman conquest[f]: the\r\nlatter was created by king Edward III, in favour of Henry Plantagenet,\r\nfirst earl and then duke of Lancaster, whose heiress John of Gant the\r\nking's son had married; and afterwards confirmed in parliament, to\r\nhonour John of Gant himself; whom, on the death of his father-in-law,\r\nhe had also created duke of Lancaster[g]. Counties palatine are so\r\ncalled _a palatio_; because the owners thereof, the earl of Chester,\r\nthe bishop of Durham, and the duke of Lancaster, had in those counties\r\n_jura regalia_, as fully as the king hath in his palace; _regalem\r\npotestatem in omnibus_, as Bracton expresses it[h]. They might pardon\r\ntreasons, murders, and felonies; they appointed all judges and\r\njustices of the peace; all writs and indictments ran in their names,\r\nas in other counties in the king's; and all offences were said to be\r\ndone against their peace, and not, as in other places, _contra pacem\r\ndomini regis_[i]. And indeed by the antient law, in all peculiar\r\njurisdictions, offences were said to be done against his peace in\r\nwhose court they were tried; in a court leet, _contra pacem domini_;\r\nin the court of a corporation, _contra pacem ballivorum_; in the\r\nsheriff's court or tourn, _contra pacem vice-comitis_[k]. These\r\npalatine privileges were in all probability originally granted to the\r\ncounties of Chester and Durham, because they bordered upon enemies\r\ncountries, Wales and Scotland; in order that the owners, being\r\nencouraged by so large an authority, might be the more watchful in\r\nit's defence; and that the inhabitants, having justice administered at\r\nhome, might not be obliged to go out of the county, and leave it open\r\nto the enemies incursions. And upon this account also there were\r\nformerly two other counties palatine, Pembrokeshire and Hexamshire,\r\nthe latter now united with Northumberland: but these were abolished by\r\nparliament, the former in 27 Hen. VIII, the latter in 14 Eliz. And in\r\n27 Hen. VIII likewise, the powers beforementioned of owners of\r\ncounties palatine were abridged; the reason for their continuance in a\r\nmanner ceasing: though still all writs are witnessed in their names,\r\nand all forfeitures for treason by the common law accrue to them[l].\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Seld. tit. hon. 2. 5. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Plowd. 215.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: _l._ 3. _c._ 8. §. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: 4. Inst. 204.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Seld. _in Hengham magn._ _c._ 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: 4 Inst. 205.]\r\n\r\nOF these three, the county of Durham is now the only one remaining in\r\nthe hands of a subject. For the earldom of Chester, as Camden\r\ntestifies, was united to the crown by Henry III, and has ever since\r\ngiven title to the king's eldest son. And the county palatine, or\r\nduchy, of Lancaster was the property of Henry of Bolinbroke, the son\r\nof John of Gant, at the time when he wrested the crown from king\r\nRichard II, and assumed the title of Henry IV. But he was too prudent\r\nto suffer this to be united to the crown, lest, if he lost one, he\r\nshould lose the other also. For, as Plowden[m] and sir Edward Coke[n]\r\nobserve, \"he knew he had the duchy of Lancaster by sure and\r\nindefeasible title, but that his title to the crown was not so\r\nassured: for that after the decease of Richard II the right of the\r\ncrown was in the heir of Lionel duke of Clarence, _second_ son of\r\nEdward III; John of Gant, father to this Henry IV, being but the\r\n_fourth_ son.\" And therefore he procured an act of parliament, in the\r\nfirst year of his reign, to keep it distinct and separate from the\r\ncrown, and so it descended to his son, and grandson, Henry V, and\r\nHenry VI. Henry VI being attainted in 1 Edw. IV, this duchy was\r\ndeclared in parliament to have become forfeited to the crown[o], and\r\nat the same time an act was made to keep it still distinct and\r\nseparate from other inheritances of the crown. And in 1 Hen. VII\r\nanother act was made to vest the inheritance thereof in Henry VII and\r\nhis heirs; and in this state, say sir Edward Coke[p] and Lambard[q],\r\nviz. in the natural heirs or posterity of Henry VII, did the right of\r\nthe duchy remain to their days; a separate and distinct inheritance\r\nfrom that of the crown of England[r].\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: 215.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: 4 Inst. 205.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: 1 Ventr. 155.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: 4 Inst. 206.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: Archeion. 233.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: If this notion of Lambard and Coke be well founded, it\r\nmight have become a very curious question at the time of the\r\nrevolution in 1688, in whom the right of the duchy remained after king\r\nJames's abdication. The attainder indeed of the pretended prince of\r\nWales (by statute 13 W. III. c. 3.) has now put the matter out of\r\ndoubt. And yet, to give that attainder it's full force in this\r\nrespect, the object of it must have been supposed legitimate, else he\r\nhad no interest to forfeit.]\r\n\r\nTHE isle of Ely is not a county palatine, though sometimes erroneously\r\ncalled so; but only a royal franchise; the bishop having, by grant of\r\nking Henry the first, _jura regalia_ within the isle of Ely, and\r\nthereby he exercises a jurisdiction over all causes, as well criminal,\r\nas civil[s].\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: 4 Inst. 220.]\r\n\r\nTHERE are also counties _corporate_; which are certain cities and\r\ntowns, some with more, some with less territory annexed to them; to\r\nwhich out of special grace and favour the kings of England have\r\ngranted to be counties of themselves, and not to be comprized in any\r\nother county; but to be governed by their own sheriffs and other\r\nmagistrates, so that no officers of the county at large have any power\r\nto intermeddle therein. Such are London, York, Bristol, Norwich,\r\nCoventry, and many others. And thus much of the countries subject to\r\nthe laws of England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMENTARIES\r\n\r\nON THE\r\n\r\nLAWS OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK THE FIRST.\r\n\r\nOF THE RIGHTS OF PERSONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIRST.\r\n\r\nOF THE ABSOLUTE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE objects of the laws of England are so very numerous and extensive,\r\nthat, in order to consider them with any tolerable ease and\r\nperspicuity, it will be necessary to distribute them methodically,\r\nunder proper and distinct heads; avoiding as much as possible\r\ndivisions too large and comprehensive on the one hand, and too\r\ntrifling and minute on the other; both of which are equally productive\r\nof confusion.\r\n\r\nNOW, as municipal law is a rule of civil conduct, commanding what is\r\nright, and prohibiting what is wrong; or, as Cicero[a], and after him\r\nour Bracton[b], has expressed it, _sanctio justa, jubens honesta et\r\nprohibens contraria_; it follows, that the primary and principal\r\nobjects of the law are RIGHTS, and WRONGS. In the prosecution\r\ntherefore of these commentaries, I shall follow this very simple and\r\nobvious division; and shall in the first place consider the _rights_\r\nthat are commanded, and secondly the _wrongs_ that are forbidden by\r\nthe laws of England.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: 11 _Philipp._ 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: _l._ 1. _c._ 3.]\r\n\r\nRIGHTS are however liable to another subdivision; being either, first,\r\nthose which concern, and are annexed to the persons of men, and are\r\nthen called _jura personarum_ or the _rights of persons_; or they are,\r\nsecondly, such as a man may acquire over external objects, or things\r\nunconnected with his person, which are stiled _jura rerum_ or the\r\n_rights of things_. Wrongs also are divisible into, first, _private\r\nwrongs_, which, being an infringement merely of particular rights,\r\nconcern individuals only, and are called civil injuries; and secondly,\r\n_public wrongs_, which, being a breach of general and public rights,\r\naffect the whole community, and are called crimes and misdemesnors.\r\n\r\nTHE objects of the laws of England falling into this fourfold\r\ndivision, the present commentaries will therefore consist of the four\r\nfollowing parts: 1. _The rights of persons_; with the means whereby\r\nsuch rights may be either acquired or lost. 2. _The rights of things_;\r\nwith the means also of acquiring and losing them. 3. _Private wrongs_,\r\nor civil injuries; with the means of redressing them by law. 4.\r\n_Public wrongs_, or crimes and misdemesnors; with the means of\r\nprevention and punishment.\r\n\r\nWE are now, first, to consider _the rights of persons_; with the means\r\nof acquiring and losing them.\r\n\r\nNOW the rights of persons that are commanded to be observed by the\r\nmunicipal law are of two sorts; first, such as are due _from_ every\r\ncitizen, which are usually called civil _duties_; and, secondly, such\r\nas belong _to_ him, which is the more popular acceptation of _rights_\r\nor _jura_. Both may indeed be comprized in this latter division; for,\r\nas all social duties are of a relative nature, at the same time that\r\nthey are due _from_ one man, or set of men, they must also be due _to_\r\nanother. But I apprehend it will be more clear and easy, to consider\r\nmany of them as duties required from, rather than as rights belonging\r\nto, particular persons. Thus, for instance, allegiance is usually, and\r\ntherefore most easily, considered as the duty of the people, and\r\nprotection as the duty of the magistrate; and yet they are,\r\nreciprocally, the rights as well as duties of each other. Allegiance\r\nis the right of the magistrate, and protection the right of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nPERSONS also are divided by the law into either natural persons, or\r\nartificial. Natural persons are such as the God of nature formed us:\r\nartificial are such as created and devised by human laws for the\r\npurposes of society and government; which are called corporations or\r\nbodies politic.\r\n\r\nTHE rights of persons considered in their natural capacities are also\r\nof two sorts, absolute, and relative. Absolute, which are such as\r\nappertain and belong to particular men, merely as individuals or\r\nsingle persons: relative, which are incident to them as members of\r\nsociety, and standing in various relations to each other. The first,\r\nthat is, absolute rights, will be the subject of the present chapter.\r\n\r\nBY the absolute _rights_ of individuals we mean those which are so in\r\ntheir primary and strictest sense; such as would belong to their\r\npersons merely in a state of nature, and which every man is intitled\r\nto enjoy whether out of society or in it. But with regard to the\r\nabsolute _duties_, which man is bound to perform considered as a mere\r\nindividual, it is not to be expected that any human municipal laws\r\nshould at all explain or enforce them. For the end and intent of such\r\nlaws being only to regulate the behaviour of mankind, as they are\r\nmembers of society, and stand in various relations to each other, they\r\nhave consequently no business or concern with any but social or\r\nrelative duties. Let a man therefore be ever so abandoned in his\r\nprinciples, or vitious in his practice, provided he keeps his\r\nwickedness to himself, and does not offend against the rules of public\r\ndecency, he is out of the reach of human laws. But if he makes his\r\nvices public, though they be such as seem principally to affect\r\nhimself, (as drunkenness, or the like) they then become, by the bad\r\nexample they set, of pernicious effects to society; and therefore it\r\nis then the business of human laws to correct them. Here the\r\ncircumstance of publication is what alters the nature of the case.\r\n_Public_ sobriety is a relative duty, and therefore enjoined by our\r\nlaws: _private_ sobriety is an absolute duty, which, whether it be\r\nperformed or not, human tribunals can never know; and therefore they\r\ncan never enforce it by any civil sanction. But, with respect to\r\n_rights_, the case is different. Human laws define and enforce as well\r\nthose rights which belong to a man considered as an individual, as\r\nthose which belong to him considered as related to others.\r\n\r\nFOR the principal aim of society is to protect individuals in the\r\nenjoyment of those absolute rights, which were vested in them by the\r\nimmutable laws of nature; but which could not be preserved in peace\r\nwithout that mutual assistance and intercourse, which is gained by the\r\ninstitution of friendly and social communities. Hence it follows, that\r\nthe first and primary end of human laws is to maintain and regulate\r\nthese _absolute_ rights of individuals. Such rights as are social and\r\n_relative_ result from, and are posterior to, the formation of states\r\nand societies: so that to maintain and regulate these, is clearly a\r\nsubsequent consideration. And therefore the principal view of human\r\nlaws is, or ought always to be, to explain, protect, and enforce such\r\nrights as are absolute, which in themselves are few and simple; and,\r\nthen, such rights as are relative, which arising from a variety of\r\nconnexions, will be far more numerous and more complicated. These will\r\ntake up a greater space in any code of laws, and hence may appear to\r\nbe more attended to, though in reality they are not, than the rights\r\nof the former kind. Let us therefore proceed to examine how far all\r\nlaws ought, and how far the laws of England actually do, take notice\r\nof these absolute rights, and provide for their lasting security.\r\n\r\nTHE absolute rights of man, considered as a free agent, endowed with\r\ndiscernment to know good from evil, and with power of choosing those\r\nmeasures which appear to him to be most desirable, are usually summed\r\nup in one general appellation, and denominated the natural liberty of\r\nmankind. This natural liberty consists properly in a power of acting\r\nas one thinks fit, without any restraint or control, unless by the law\r\nof nature: being a right inherent in us by birth, and one of the gifts\r\nof God to man at his creation, when he endued him with the faculty of\r\nfreewill. But every man, when he enters into society, gives up a part\r\nof his natural liberty, as the price of so valuable a purchase; and,\r\nin consideration of receiving the advantages of mutual commerce,\r\nobliges himself to conform to those laws, which the community has\r\nthought proper to establish. And this species of legal obedience and\r\nconformity is infinitely more desirable, than that wild and savage\r\nliberty which is sacrificed to obtain it. For no man, that considers a\r\nmoment, would wish to retain the absolute and uncontroled power of\r\ndoing whatever he pleases; the consequence of which is, that every\r\nother man would also have the same power; and then there would be no\r\nsecurity to individuals in any of the enjoyments of life. Political\r\ntherefore, or civil, liberty, which is that of a member of society, is\r\nno other than natural liberty so far restrained by human laws (and no\r\nfarther) as is necessary and expedient for the general advantage of\r\nthe publick[c]. Hence we may collect that the law, which restrains a\r\nman from doing mischief to his fellow citizens, though it diminishes\r\nthe natural, increases the civil liberty of mankind: but every wanton\r\nand causeless restraint of the will of the subject, whether practiced\r\nby a monarch, a nobility, or a popular assembly, is a degree of\r\ntyranny. Nay, that even laws themselves, whether made with or without\r\nour consent, if they regulate and constrain our conduct in matters of\r\nmere indifference, without any good end in view, are laws destructive\r\nof liberty: whereas if any public advantage can arise from observing\r\nsuch precepts, the control of our private inclinations, in one or two\r\nparticular points, will conduce to preserve our general freedom in\r\nothers of more importance; by supporting that state, of society, which\r\nalone can secure our independence. Thus the statute of king Edward\r\nIV[d], which forbad the fine gentlemen of those times (under the\r\ndegree of a lord) to wear pikes upon their shoes or boots of more than\r\ntwo inches in length, was a law that savoured of oppression; because,\r\nhowever ridiculous the fashion then in use might appear, the\r\nrestraining it by pecuniary penalties could serve no purpose of common\r\nutility. But the statute of king Charles II[e], which prescribes a\r\nthing seemingly as indifferent; viz. a dress for the dead, who are all\r\nordered to be buried in woollen; is a law consistent with public\r\nliberty, for it encourages the staple trade, on which in great measure\r\ndepends the universal good of the nation. So that laws, when prudently\r\nframed, are by no means subversive but rather introductive of liberty;\r\nfor (as Mr Locke has well observed[f]) where there is no law, there is\r\nno freedom. But then, on the other hand, that constitution or frame of\r\ngovernment, that system of laws, is alone calculated to maintain civil\r\nliberty, which leaves the subject entire master of his own conduct,\r\nexcept in those points wherein the public good requires some direction\r\nor restraint.\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: _Facultas ejus, quod cuique facere libet, nisi quid jure\r\nprohibetur._ _Inst._ 1. 3. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: 3 Edw. IV. c. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: 30 Car. II. st. 1. c. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: on Gov. p. 2. §. 57.]\r\n\r\nTHE idea and practice of this political or civil liberty flourish in\r\ntheir highest vigour in these kingdoms, where it falls little short\r\nof perfection, and can only be lost or destroyed by the folly or\r\ndemerits of it's owner: the legislature, and of course the laws of\r\nEngland, being peculiarly adapted to the preservation of this\r\ninestimable blessing even in the meanest subject. Very different from\r\nthe modern constitutions of other states, on the continent of Europe,\r\nand from the genius of the imperial law; which in general are\r\ncalculated to vest an arbitrary and despotic power of controlling the\r\nactions of the subject in the prince, or in a few grandees. And this\r\nspirit of liberty is so deeply implanted in our constitution, and\r\nrooted even in our very soil, that a slave or a negro, the moment he\r\nlands in England, falls under the protection of the laws, and with\r\nregard to all natural rights becomes _eo instanti_ a freeman[g].\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Salk. 666.]\r\n\r\nTHE absolute rights of every Englishman (which, taken in a political\r\nand extensive sense, are usually called their liberties) as they are\r\nfounded on nature and reason, so they are coeval with our form of\r\ngovernment; though subject at times to fluctuate and change: their\r\nestablishment (excellent as it is) being still human. At some times we\r\nhave seen them depressed by overbearing and tyrannical princes; at\r\nothers so luxuriant as even to tend to anarchy, a worse state than\r\ntyranny itself, as any government is better than none at all. But the\r\nvigour of our free constitution has always delivered the nation from\r\nthese embarrassments, and, as soon as the convulsions consequent on\r\nthe struggle have been over, the ballance of our rights and liberties\r\nhas settled to it's proper level; and their fundamental articles have\r\nbeen from time to time asserted in parliament, as often as they were\r\nthought to be in danger.\r\n\r\nFIRST, by the great charter of liberties, which was obtained, sword in\r\nhand, from king John; and afterwards, with some alterations, confirmed\r\nin parliament by king Henry the third, his son. Which charter\r\ncontained very few new grants; but, as sir Edward Coke[h] observes,\r\nwas for the most part declaratory of the principal grounds of the\r\nfundamental laws of England. Afterwards by the statute called\r\n_confirmatio cartarum_[i], whereby the great charter is directed to be\r\nallowed as the common law; all judgments contrary to it are declared\r\nvoid; copies of it are ordered to be sent to all cathedral churches,\r\nand read twice a year to the people; and sentence of excommunication\r\nis directed to be as constantly denounced against all those that by\r\nword, deed, or counsel act contrary thereto, or in any degree infringe\r\nit. Next by a multitude of subsequent corroborating statutes, (sir\r\nEdward Coke, I think, reckons thirty two[k],) from the first Edward to\r\nHenry the fourth. Then, after a long interval, by _the petition of\r\nright_; which was a parliamentary declaration of the liberties of the\r\npeople, assented to by king Charles the first in the beginning of his\r\nreign. Which was closely followed by the still more ample concessions\r\nmade by that unhappy prince to his parliament, before the fatal\r\nrupture between them; and by the many salutary laws, particularly the\r\n_habeas corpus_ act, passed under Charles the second. To these\r\nsucceeded _the bill of rights_, or declaration delivered by the lords\r\nand commons to the prince and princess of Orange 13 February 1688; and\r\nafterwards enacted in parliament, when they became king and queen:\r\nwhich declaration concludes in these remarkable words; \"and they do\r\nclaim, demand, and insist upon all and singular the premises, as their\r\nundoubted rights and liberties.\" And the act of parliament itself[l]\r\nrecognizes \"all and singular the rights and liberties asserted and\r\nclaimed in the said declaration to be the true, antient, and\r\nindubitable rights of the people of this kingdom.\" Lastly, these\r\nliberties were again asserted at the commencement of the present\r\ncentury, in the _act of settlement_[m], whereby the crown is limited\r\nto his present majesty's illustrious house, and some new provisions\r\nwere added at the same fortunate aera for better securing our\r\nreligion, laws, and liberties; which the statute declares to be \"the\r\nbirthright of the people of England;\" according to the antient\r\ndoctrine of the common law[n].\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: 2 Inst. proem.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: 25 Edw. I.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: 2 Inst. proem.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: 1 W. and M. st. 2. c. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: 12 & 13 W. III. c. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: Plowd. 55.]\r\n\r\nTHUS much for the _declaration_ of our rights and liberties. The\r\nrights themselves thus defined by these several statutes, consist in a\r\nnumber of private immunities; which will appear, from what has been\r\npremised, to be indeed no other, than either that _residuum_ of\r\nnatural liberty, which is not required by the laws of society to be\r\nsacrificed to public convenience; or else those civil privileges,\r\nwhich society hath engaged to provide, in lieu of the natural\r\nliberties so given up by individuals. These therefore were formerly,\r\neither by inheritance or purchase, the rights of all mankind; but, in\r\nmost other countries of the world being now more or less debased and\r\ndestroyed, they at present may be said to remain, in a peculiar and\r\nemphatical manner, the rights of the people of England. And these may\r\nbe reduced to three principal or primary articles; the right of\r\npersonal security, the right of personal liberty; and the right of\r\nprivate property: because as there is no other known method of\r\ncompulsion, or of abridging man's natural free will, but by an\r\ninfringement or diminution of one or other of these important rights,\r\nthe preservation of these, inviolate, may justly be said to include\r\nthe preservation of our civil immunities in their largest and most\r\nextensive sense.\r\n\r\nI. THE right of personal security consists in a person's legal and\r\nuninterrupted enjoyment of his life, his limbs, his body, his health,\r\nand his reputation.\r\n\r\n1. LIFE is the immediate gift of God, a right inherent by nature in\r\nevery individual; and it begins in contemplation of law as soon as an\r\ninfant is able to stir in the mother's womb. For if a woman is quick\r\nwith child, and by a potion, or otherwise, killeth it in her womb; or\r\nif any one beat her, whereby the child dieth in her body, and she is\r\ndelivered of a dead child; this, though not murder, was by the antient\r\nlaw homicide or manslaughter[o]. But at present it is not looked upon\r\nin quite so atrocious a light, though it remains a very heinous\r\nmisdemesnor[p].\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: _Si aliquis mulierem praegnantem percusserit, vel ei\r\nvenenum dederit, per quod fecerit abortivam; si puerperium jam\r\nformatum fuerit, et maxime si fuerit animatum, facit homicidium._\r\nBracton. _l._ 3. _c._ 21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: 3 Inst. 90.]\r\n\r\nAN infant _in ventre sa mere_, or in the mother's womb, is supposed in\r\nlaw to be born for many purposes. It is capable of having a legacy, or\r\na surrender of a copyhold estate made to it. It may have a guardian\r\nassigned to it[q]; and it is enabled to have an estate limited to it's\r\nuse, and to take afterwards by such limitation, as if it were then\r\nactually born[r]. And in this point the civil law agrees with ours[s].\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: Stat. 12 Car. II. c. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Stat. 10 & 11 W. III. c. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: _Qui in utero sunt, in jure civili intelliguntur in rerum\r\nnatura esse, cum de eorum commodo agatur._ _Ff._ 1. 5. 26.]\r\n\r\n2. A MAN'S limbs, (by which for the present we only understand those\r\nmembers which may be useful to him in fight, and the loss of which\r\nonly amounts to mayhem by the common law) are also the gift of the\r\nwise creator; to enable man to protect himself from external injuries\r\nin a state of nature. To these therefore he has a natural inherent\r\nright; and they cannot be wantonly destroyed or disabled without a\r\nmanifest breach of civil liberty.\r\n\r\nBOTH the life and limbs of a man are of such high value, in the\r\nestimation of the law of England, that it pardons even homicide if\r\ncommitted _se defendendo_, or in order to preserve them. For whatever\r\nis done by a man, to save either life or member, is looked upon as\r\ndone upon the highest necessity and compulsion. Therefore if a man\r\nthrough fear of death or mayhem is prevailed upon to execute a deed,\r\nor do any other legal act; these, though accompanied with all other\r\nthe requisite solemnities, are totally void in law, if forced upon him\r\nby a well-grounded apprehension of losing his life, or even his limbs,\r\nin case of his non-compliance[t]. And the same is also a sufficient\r\nexcuse for the commission of many misdemesnors, as will appear in the\r\nfourth book. The constraint a man is under in these circumstances is\r\ncalled in law _duress_, from the Latin _durities_, of which there are\r\ntwo sorts; duress of imprisonment, where a man actually loses his\r\nliberty, of which we shall presently speak; and duress _per minas_,\r\nwhere the hardship is only threatened and impending, which is that we\r\nare now discoursing of. Duress _per minas_ is either for fear of loss\r\nof life, or else for fear of mayhem, or loss of limb. And this fear\r\nmust be upon sufficient reason; \"_non_,\" as Bracton expresses it,\r\n\"_suspicio cujuslibet vani et meticulosi hominis, sed talis qui possit\r\ncadere in virum constantem; talis enim debet esse metus, qui in se\r\ncontineat vitae periculum, aut corporis cruciatum_[u].\" A fear of\r\nbattery, or being beaten, though never so well grounded, is no duress;\r\nneither is the fear of having one's house burnt, or one's goods taken\r\naway and destroyed; because in these cases, should the threat be\r\nperformed, a man may have satisfaction by recovering equivalent\r\ndamages[w]: but no suitable atonement can be made for the loss of\r\nlife, or limb. And the indulgence shewn to a man under this, the\r\nprincipal, sort of duress, the fear of losing his life or limbs,\r\nagrees also with that maxim of the civil law; _ignoscitur ei qui\r\nsanguinem suum qualiter qualiter redemptum voluit_[x].\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: 2 Inst. 483.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: _l._ 2. _c._ 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: 2 Inst. 483.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: _Ff._ 48. 21. 1.]\r\n\r\nTHE law not only regards life and member, and protects every man in\r\nthe enjoyment of them, but also furnishes him with every thing\r\nnecessary for their support. For there is no man so indigent or\r\nwretched, but he may demand a supply sufficient for all the\r\nnecessities of life, from the more opulent part of the community, by\r\nmeans of the several statutes enacted for the relief of the poor, of\r\nwhich in their proper places. A humane provision; yet, though dictated\r\nby the principles of society, discountenanced by the Roman laws. For\r\nthe edicts of the emperor Constantine, commanding the public to\r\nmaintain the children of those who were unable to provide for them, in\r\norder to prevent the murder and exposure of infants, an institution\r\nfounded on the same principle as our foundling hospitals, though\r\ncomprized in the Theodosian code[y], were rejected in Justinian's\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: _l._ 11. _t._ 27.]\r\n\r\nTHESE rights, of life and member, can only be determined by the death\r\nof the person; which is either a civil or natural death. The civil\r\ndeath commences if any man be banished the realm[z] by the process of\r\nthe common law, or enters into religion; that is, goes into a\r\nmonastery, and becomes there a monk professed: in which cases he is\r\nabsolutely dead in law, and his next heir shall have his estate. For,\r\nsuch banished man is entirely cut off from society; and such a monk,\r\nupon his profession, renounces solemnly all secular concerns: and\r\nbesides, as the popish clergy claimed an exemption from the duties of\r\ncivil life, and the commands of the temporal magistrate, the genius of\r\nthe English law would not suffer those persons to enjoy the benefits\r\nof society, who secluded themselves from it, and refused to submit to\r\nit's regulations[a]. A monk is therefore accounted _civiliter\r\nmortuus_, and when he enters into religion may, like other dying men,\r\nmake his testament and executors; or, if he makes none, the ordinary\r\nmay grant administration to his next of kin, as if he were actually\r\ndead intestate. And such executors and administrators shall have the\r\nsame power, and may bring the same actions for debts due _to_ the\r\nreligious, and are liable to the same actions for those due _from_\r\nhim, as if he were naturally deceased[b]. Nay, so far has this\r\nprinciple been carried, that when one was bound in a bond to an abbot\r\nand his successors, and afterwards made his executors and professed\r\nhimself a monk of the same abbey, and in process of time was himself\r\nmade abbot thereof; here the law gave him, in the capacity of abbot,\r\nan action of debt against his own executors to recover the money\r\ndue[c]. In short, a monk or religious is so effectually dead in law,\r\nthat a lease made even to a third person, during the life (generally)\r\nof one who afterwards becomes a monk, determines by such his entry\r\ninto religion: for which reason leases, and other conveyances, for\r\nlife, are usually made to have and to hold for the term of one's\r\n_natural_ life[d].\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: Co. Litt. 133.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: This was also a rule in the feodal law, _l._ 2. _t._ 21.\r\n_desiit esse miles seculi, qui factus est miles Christi; nec\r\nbeneficium pertinet ad eum qui non debet gerere officium_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Litt. §. 200.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Co. Litt. 133 _b._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: 2 Rep. 48. Co. Litt. 132.]\r\n\r\nTHIS natural life being, as was before observed, the immediate\r\ndonation of the great creator, cannot legally be disposed of or\r\ndestroyed by any individual, neither by the person himself nor by any\r\nother of his fellow creatures, merely upon their own authority. Yet\r\nnevertheless it may, by the divine permission, be frequently forfeited\r\nfor the breach of those laws of society, which are enforced by the\r\nsanction of capital punishments; of the nature, restrictions,\r\nexpedience, and legality of which, we may hereafter more conveniently\r\nenquire in the concluding book of these commentaries. At present, I\r\nshall only observe, that whenever the _constitution_ of a state vests\r\nin any man, or body of men, a power of destroying at pleasure, without\r\nthe direction of laws, the lives or members of the subject, such\r\nconstitution is in the highest degree tyrannical: and that whenever\r\nany _laws_ direct such destruction for light and trivial causes, such\r\nlaws are likewise tyrannical, though in an inferior degree; because\r\nhere the subject is aware of the danger he is exposed to, and may by\r\nprudent caution provide against it. The statute law of England does\r\ntherefore very seldom, and the common law does never, inflict any\r\npunishment extending to life or limb, unless upon the highest\r\nnecessity: and the constitution is an utter stranger to any arbitrary\r\npower of killing or maiming the subject without the express warrant of\r\nlaw. \"_Nullus liber homo_, says the great charter[e], _aliquo modo\r\ndestruatur, nisi per legale judicium parium suorum aut per legem\r\nterrae._\" Which words, \"_aliquo modo destruatur_,\" according to sir\r\nEdward Coke[f], include a prohibition not only of _killing_, and\r\n_maiming_, but also of _torturing_ (to which our laws are strangers)\r\nand of every oppression by colour of an illegal authority. And it is\r\nenacted by the statute 5 Edw. III. c. 9. that no man shall be\r\nforejudged of life or limb, contrary to the great charter and the law\r\nof the land: and again, by statute 28 Ed. III. c. 3. that no man\r\nshall be put to death, without being brought to answer by due process\r\nof law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: c. 29.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: 2 Inst. 48.]\r\n\r\n3. BESIDES those limbs and members that may be necessary to man, in\r\norder to defend himself or annoy his enemy, the rest of his person or\r\nbody is also entitled by the same natural right to security from the\r\ncorporal insults of menaces, assaults, beating, and wounding; though\r\nsuch insults amount not to destruction of life or member.\r\n\r\n4. THE preservation of a man's health from such practices as may\r\nprejudice or annoy it, and\r\n\r\n5. THE security of his reputation or good name from the arts of\r\ndetraction and slander, are rights to which every man is intitled, by\r\nreason and natural justice; since without these it is impossible to\r\nhave the perfect enjoyment of any other advantage or right. But these\r\nthree last articles (being of much less importance than those which\r\nhave gone before, and those which are yet to come) it will suffice to\r\nhave barely mentioned among the rights of persons; referring the more\r\nminute discussion of their several branches, to those parts of our\r\ncommentaries which treat of the infringement of these rights, under\r\nthe head of personal wrongs.\r\n\r\nII. NEXT to personal security, the law of England regards, asserts,\r\nand preserves the personal liberty of individuals. This personal\r\nliberty consists in the power of loco-motion, of changing situation,\r\nor removing one's person to whatsoever place one's own inclination may\r\ndirect; without imprisonment or restraint, unless by due course of\r\nlaw. Concerning which we may make the same observations as upon the\r\npreceding article; that it is a right strictly natural; that the laws\r\nof England have never abridged it without sufficient cause; and, that\r\nin this kingdom it cannot ever be abridged at the mere discretion of\r\nthe magistrate, without the explicit permission of the laws. Here\r\nagain the language of the great charter[g] is, that no freeman shall\r\nbe taken or imprisoned, but by the lawful judgment of his equals, or\r\nby the law of the land. And many subsequent old statutes[h] expressly\r\ndirect, that no man shall be taken or imprisoned by suggestion or\r\npetition to the king, or his council, unless it be by legal\r\nindictment, or the process of the common law. By the petition of\r\nright, 3 Car. I, it is enacted, that no freeman shall be imprisoned or\r\ndetained without cause shewn, to which he may make answer according to\r\nlaw. By 16 Car. I. c. 10. if any person be restrained of his liberty\r\nby order or decree of any illegal court, or by command of the king's\r\nmajesty in person, or by warrant of the council board, or of any of\r\nthe privy council; he shall, upon demand of his counsel, have a writ\r\nof _habeas corpus_, to bring his body before the court of king's bench\r\nor common pleas; who shall determine whether the cause of his\r\ncommitment be just, and thereupon do as to justice shall appertain.\r\nAnd by 31 Car. II. c. 2. commonly called _the habeas corpus act_, the\r\nmethods of obtaining this writ are so plainly pointed out and\r\nenforced, that, so long as this statute remains unimpeached, no\r\nsubject of England can be long detained in prison, except in those\r\ncases in which the law requires and justifies such detainer. And, lest\r\nthis act should be evaded by demanding unreasonable bail, or sureties\r\nfor the prisoner's appearance, it is declared by 1 W. & M. st. 2. c.\r\n2. that excessive bail ought not to be required.\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: c. 29.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: 5 Edw. III. c. 9. 25 Edw. III. st. 5. c. 4. and 28 Edw.\r\nIII. c. 3.]\r\n\r\nOF great importance to the public is the preservation of this personal\r\nliberty: for if once it were left in the power of any, the highest,\r\nmagistrate to imprison arbitrarily whomever he or his officers thought\r\nproper, (as in France it is daily practiced by the crown) there would\r\nsoon be an end of all other rights and immunities. Some have thought,\r\nthat unjust attacks, even upon life, or property, at the arbitrary\r\nwill of the magistrate, are less dangerous to the commonwealth, than\r\nsuch as are made upon the personal liberty of the subject. To bereave\r\na man of life, or by violence to confiscate his estate, without\r\naccusation or trial, would be so gross and notorious an act of\r\ndespotism, as must at once convey the alarm of tyranny throughout the\r\nwhole kingdom. But confinement of the person, by secretly hurrying him\r\nto gaol, where his sufferings are unknown or forgotten; is a less\r\npublic, a less striking, and therefore a more dangerous engine of\r\narbitrary government. And yet sometimes, when the state is in real\r\ndanger, even this may be a necessary measure. But the happiness of our\r\nconstitution is, that it is not left to the executive power to\r\ndetermine when the danger of the state is so great, as to render this\r\nmeasure expedient. For the parliament only, or legislative power,\r\nwhenever it sees proper, can authorize the crown, by suspending the\r\n_habeas corpus_ act for a short and limited time, to imprison\r\nsuspected persons without giving any reason for so doing. As the\r\nsenate of Rome was wont to have recourse to a dictator, a magistrate\r\nof absolute authority, when they judged the republic in any imminent\r\ndanger. The decree of the senate, which usually preceded the\r\nnomination of this magistrate, \"_dent operam consules, nequid\r\nrespublica detrimenti capiat_,\" was called the _senatus consultum\r\nultimae necessitatis_. In like manner this experiment ought only to be\r\ntried in cases of extreme emergency; and in these the nation parts\r\nwith it's liberty for a while, in order to preserve it for ever.\r\n\r\nTHE confinement of the person, in any wise, is an imprisonment. So\r\nthat the keeping a man against his will in a private house, putting\r\nhim in the stocks, arresting or forcibly detaining him in the street,\r\nis an imprisonment[i]. And the law so much discourages unlawful\r\nconfinement, that if a man is under _duress of imprisonment_, which we\r\nbefore explained to mean a compulsion by an illegal restraint of\r\nliberty, until he seals a bond or the like; he may alledge this\r\nduress, and avoid the extorted bond. But if a man be lawfully\r\nimprisoned, and either to procure his discharge, or on any other fair\r\naccount, seals a bond or a deed, this is not by duress of\r\nimprisonment, and he is not at liberty to avoid it[k]. To make\r\nimprisonment lawful, it must either be, by process from the courts of\r\njudicature, or by warrant from some legal officer, having authority\r\nto commit to prison; which warrant must be in writing, under the hand\r\nand seal of the magistrate, and express the causes of the commitment,\r\nin order to be examined into (if necessary) upon a _habeas corpus_. If\r\nthere be no cause expressed, the goaler is not bound to detain the\r\nprisoner[l]. For the law judges in this respect, saith sir Edward\r\nCoke, like Festus the Roman governor; that it is unreasonable to send\r\na prisoner, and not to signify withal the crimes alleged against him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: 2 Inst. 589.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: 2 Inst. 482.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: 2 Inst. 52, 53.]\r\n\r\nA NATURAL and regular consequence of this personal liberty, is, that\r\nevery Englishman may claim a right to abide in his own country so long\r\nas he pleases; and not to be driven from it unless by the sentence of\r\nthe law. The king indeed, by his royal prerogative, may issue out his\r\nwrit _ne exeat regnum_, and prohibit any of his subjects from going\r\ninto foreign parts without licence[m]. This may be necessary for the\r\npublic service, and safeguard of the commonwealth. But no power on\r\nearth, except the authority of parliament, can send any subject of\r\nEngland _out of_ the land against his will; no not even a criminal.\r\nFor exile, or transportation, is a punishment unknown to the common\r\nlaw; and, wherever it is now inflicted, it is either by the choice of\r\nthe criminal himself, to escape a capital punishment, or else by the\r\nexpress direction of some modern act of parliament. To this purpose\r\nthe great charter[n] declares that no freeman shall be banished,\r\nunless by the judgment of his peers, or by the law of the land. And by\r\nthe _habeas corpus_ act, 31 Car. II. c. 2. (that second _magna carta_,\r\nand stable bulwark of our liberties) it is enacted, that no subject of\r\nthis realm, who is an inhabitant of England, Wales, or Berwick, shall\r\nbe sent prisoner into Scotland, Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey, or places\r\nbeyond the seas; (where they cannot have the benefit and protection of\r\nthe common law) but that all such imprisonments shall be illegal; that\r\nthe person, who shall dare to commit another contrary to this law,\r\nshall be disabled from bearing any office, shall incur the penalty of\r\na praemunire, and be incapable of receiving the king's pardon: and\r\nthe party suffering shall also have his private action against the\r\nperson committing, and all his aiders, advisers and abettors, and\r\nshall recover treble costs; besides his damages, which no jury shall\r\nassess at less than five hundred pounds.\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: F.N.B. 85.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: cap. 29.]\r\n\r\nTHE law is in this respect so benignly and liberally construed for the\r\nbenefit of the subject, that, though _within_ the realm the king may\r\ncommand the attendance and service of all his liege-men, yet he cannot\r\nsend any man _out of_ the realm, even upon the public service: he\r\ncannot even constitute a man lord deputy or lieutenant of Ireland\r\nagainst his will, nor make him a foreign embassador[o]. For this might\r\nin reality be no more than an honorable exile.\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: 2 Inst. 47.]\r\n\r\nIII. THE third absolute right, inherent in every Englishman, is that\r\nof property; which consists in the free use, enjoyment, and disposal\r\nof all his acquisitions, without any control or diminution, save only\r\nby the laws of the land. The original of private property is probably\r\nfounded in nature, as will be more fully explained in the second book\r\nof the ensuing commentaries: but certainly the modifications under\r\nwhich we at present find it, the method of conserving it in the\r\npresent owner, and of translating it from man to man, are entirely\r\nderived from society; and are some of those civil advantages, in\r\nexchange for which every individual has resigned a part of his natural\r\nliberty. The laws of England are therefore, in point of honor and\r\njustice, extremely watchful in ascertaining and protecting this right.\r\nUpon this principle the great charter[p] has declared that no freeman\r\nshall be disseised, or divested, of his freehold, or of his liberties,\r\nor free customs, but by the judgment of his peers, or by the law of\r\nthe land. And by a variety of antient statutes[q] it is enacted, that\r\nno man's lands or goods shall be seised into the king's hands, against\r\nthe great charter, and the law of the land; and that no man shall be\r\ndisinherited, nor put out of his franchises or freehold, unless he be\r\nduly brought to answer, and be forejudged by course of law; and if any\r\nthing be done to the contrary, it shall be redressed, and holden for\r\nnone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: c. 29.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: 5 Edw. III. c. 9. 25 Edw. III. st. 5. c. 4. 28 Edw. III.\r\nc. 3.]\r\n\r\nSO great moreover is the regard of the law for private property, that\r\nit will not authorize the least violation of it; no, not even for the\r\ngeneral good of the whole community. If a new road, for instance, were\r\nto be made through the grounds of a private person, it might perhaps\r\nbe extensively beneficial to the public; but the law permits no man,\r\nor set of men, to do this without consent of the owner of the land. In\r\nvain may it be urged, that the good of the individual ought to yield\r\nto that of the community; for it would be dangerous to allow any\r\nprivate man, or even any public tribunal, to be the judge of this\r\ncommon good, and to decide whether it be expedient or no. Besides, the\r\npublic good is in nothing more essentially interested, than in the\r\nprotection of every individual's private rights, as modelled by the\r\nmunicipal law. In this, and similar cases the legislature alone can,\r\nand indeed frequently does, interpose, and compel the individual to\r\nacquiesce. But how does it interpose and compel? Not by absolutely\r\nstripping the subject of his property in an arbitrary manner; but by\r\ngiving him a full indemnification and equivalent for the injury\r\nthereby sustained. The public is now considered as an individual,\r\ntreating with an individual for an exchange. All that the legislature\r\ndoes is to oblige the owner to alienate his possessions for a\r\nreasonable price; and even this is an exertion of power, which the\r\nlegislature indulges with caution, and which nothing but the\r\nlegislature can perform.\r\n\r\nNOR is this the only instance in which the law of the land has\r\npostponed even public necessity to the sacred and inviolable rights of\r\nprivate property. For no subject of England can be constrained to pay\r\nany aids or taxes, even for the defence of the realm or the support of\r\ngovernment, but such as are imposed by his own consent, or that of his\r\nrepresentatives in parliament. By the statute 25 Edw. I. c. 5 and 6.\r\nit is provided, that the king shall not take any aids or tasks, but\r\nby the common assent of the realm. And what that common assent is, is\r\nmore fully explained by 34 Edw. I. st. 4. cap. 1. which enacts, that\r\nno talliage or aid shall be taken without assent of the arch-bishops,\r\nbishops, earls, barons, knights, burgesses, and other freemen of the\r\nland[r]: and again by 14 Edw. III. st. 2. c. 1. the prelates, earls,\r\nbarons, and commons, citizens, burgesses, and merchants shall not be\r\ncharged to make any aid, if it be not by the common assent of the\r\ngreat men and commons in parliament. And as this fundamental law had\r\nbeen shamefully evaded under many succeeding princes, by compulsive\r\nloans, and benevolences extorted without a real and voluntary consent,\r\nit was made an article in the petition of right 3 Car. I, that no man\r\nshall be compelled to yield any gift, loan, or benevolence, tax, or\r\nsuch like charge, without common consent by act of parliament. And,\r\nlastly, by the statute 1 W. & M. st. 2. c. 2. it is declared, that\r\nlevying money for or to the use of the crown, by pretence of\r\nprerogative, without grant of parliament; or for longer time, or in\r\nother manner, than the same is or shall be granted, is illegal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: See the historical introduction to the great charter, &c,\r\n_sub anno_ 1297; wherein it is shewn that this statute _de talliagio\r\nnon concedendo_, supposed to have been made in 34 Edw. I, is in\r\nreality nothing more than a sort of translation into Latin of the\r\n_confirmatio cartarum_, 25 Edw. I, which was originally published in\r\nthe Norman language.]\r\n\r\nIN the three preceding articles we have taken a short view of the\r\nprincipal absolute rights which appertain to every Englishman. But in\r\nvain would these rights be declared, ascertained, and protected by the\r\ndead letter of the laws, if the constitution had provided no other\r\nmethod to secure their actual enjoyment. It has therefore established\r\ncertain other auxiliary subordinate rights of the subject, which serve\r\nprincipally as barriers to protect and maintain inviolate the three\r\ngreat and primary rights, of personal security, personal liberty, and\r\nprivate property. These are,\r\n\r\n1. THE constitution, powers, and privileges of parliament, of which I\r\nshall treat at large in the ensuing chapter.\r\n\r\n2. THE limitation of the king's prerogative, by bounds so certain and\r\nnotorious, that it is impossible he should exceed them without the\r\nconsent of the people. Of this also I shall treat in it's proper\r\nplace. The former of these keeps the legislative power in due health\r\nand vigour, so as to make it improbable that laws should be enacted\r\ndestructive of general liberty: the latter is a guard upon the\r\nexecutive power, by restraining it from acting either beyond or in\r\ncontradiction to the laws, that are framed and established by the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n3. A THIRD subordinate right of every Englishman is that of applying\r\nto the courts of justice for redress of injuries. Since the law is in\r\nEngland the supreme arbiter of every man's life, liberty, and\r\nproperty, courts of justice must at all times be open to the subject,\r\nand the law be duly administred therein. The emphatical words of\r\n_magna carta_[s], spoken in the person of the king, who in judgment of\r\nlaw (says sir Edward Coke[t]) is ever present and repeating them in\r\nall his courts, are these; \"_nulli vendemus, nulli negabimus, aut\r\ndifferemus rectum vel justitiam_: and therefore every subject,\"\r\ncontinues the same learned author, \"for injury done to him _in bonis,\r\nin terris, vel persona_, by any other subject, be he ecclesiastical or\r\ntemporal without any exception, may take his remedy by the course of\r\nthe law, and have justice and right for the injury done to him, freely\r\nwithout sale, fully without any denial, and speedily without delay.\"\r\nIt were endless to enumerate all the _affirmative_ acts of parliament\r\nwherein justice is directed to be done according to the law of the\r\nland: and what that law is, every subject knows; or may know if he\r\npleases: for it depends not upon the arbitrary will of any judge; but\r\nis permanent, fixed, and unchangeable, unless by authority of\r\nparliament. I shall however just mention a few _negative_ statutes,\r\nwhereby abuses, perversions, or delays of justice, especially by the\r\nprerogative, are restrained. It is ordained by _magna carta_[u], that\r\nno freeman shall be outlawed, that is, put out of the protection and\r\nbenefit of the laws, but according to the law of the land. By 2 Edw.\r\nIII. c. 8. and 11 Ric. II. c. 10. it is enacted, that no commands or\r\nletters shall be sent under the great seal, or the little seal, the\r\nsignet, or privy seal, in disturbance of the law; or to disturb or\r\ndelay common right: and, though such commandments should come, the\r\njudges shall not cease to do right. And by 1 W. & M. st. 2. c. 2. it\r\nis declared, that the pretended power of suspending, or dispensing\r\nwith laws, or the execution of laws, by regal authority without\r\nconsent of parliament, is illegal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: c. 29.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: 2 Inst. 55.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: c. 29.]\r\n\r\nNOT only the substantial part, or judicial decisions, of the law, but\r\nalso the formal part, or method of proceeding, cannot be altered but\r\nby parliament: for if once those outworks were demolished, there would\r\nbe no inlet to all manner of innovation in the body of the law itself.\r\nThe king, it is true, may erect new courts of justice; but then they\r\nmust proceed according to the old established forms of the common law.\r\nFor which reason it is declared in the statute 16 Car. I. c. 10. upon\r\nthe dissolution of the court of starchamber, that neither his majesty,\r\nnor his privy council, have any jurisdiction, power, or authority by\r\nEnglish bill, petition, articles, libel (which were the course of\r\nproceeding in the starchamber, borrowed from the civil law) or by any\r\nother arbitrary way whatsoever, to examine, or draw into question,\r\ndetermine or dispose of the lands or goods of any subjects of this\r\nkingdom; but that the same ought to be tried and determined in the\r\nordinary courts of justice, and by _course of law_.\r\n\r\n4. IF there should happen any uncommon injury, or infringement of the\r\nrights beforementioned, which the ordinary course of law is too\r\ndefective to reach, there still remains a fourth subordinate right\r\nappertaining to every individual, namely, the right of petitioning the\r\nking, or either house of parliament, for the redress of grievances.\r\nIn Russia we are told[w] that the czar Peter established a law, that\r\nno subject might petition the throne, till he had first petitioned two\r\ndifferent ministers of state. In case he obtained justice from\r\nneither, he might then present a third petition to the prince; but\r\nupon pain of death, if found to be in the wrong. The consequence of\r\nwhich was, that no one dared to offer such third petition; and\r\ngrievances seldom falling under the notice of the sovereign, he had\r\nlittle opportunity to redress them. The restrictions, for some there\r\nare, which are laid upon petitioning in England, are of a nature\r\nextremely different; and while they promote the spirit of peace, they\r\nare no check upon that of liberty. Care only must be taken, lest,\r\nunder the pretence of petitioning, the subject be guilty of any riot\r\nor tumult; as happened in the opening of the memorable parliament in\r\n1640: and, to prevent this, it is provided by the statute 13 Car. II.\r\nst. 1. c. 5. that no petition to the king, or either house of\r\nparliament, for any alterations in church or state, shall be signed by\r\nabove twenty persons, unless the matter thereof be approved by three\r\njustices of the peace or the major part of the grand jury, in the\r\ncountry; and in London by the lord mayor, aldermen, and common\r\ncouncil; nor shall any petition be presented by more than two persons\r\nat a time. But under these regulations, it is declared by the statute\r\n1 W. & M. st. 2. c. 2. that the subject hath a right to petition; and\r\nthat all commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning are\r\nillegal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: Montesq. Sp. L. 12. 26.]\r\n\r\n5. THE fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject, that I shall at\r\npresent mention, is that of having arms for their defence, suitable to\r\ntheir condition and degree, and such as are allowed by law. Which is\r\nalso declared by the same statute 1 W. & M. st. 2. c. 2. and is indeed\r\na public allowance, under due restrictions, of the natural right of\r\nresistance and self-preservation, when the sanctions of society and\r\nlaws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression.\r\n\r\nIN these several articles consist the rights, or, as they are\r\nfrequently termed, the liberties of Englishmen: liberties more\r\ngenerally talked of, than thoroughly understood; and yet highly\r\nnecessary to be perfectly known and considered by every man of rank or\r\nproperty, lest his ignorance of the points whereon it is founded\r\nshould hurry him into faction and licentiousness on the one hand, or a\r\npusillanimous indifference and criminal submission on the other. And\r\nwe have seen that these rights consist, primarily, in the free\r\nenjoyment of personal security, of personal liberty, and of private\r\nproperty. So long as these remain inviolate, the subject is perfectly\r\nfree; for every species of compulsive tyranny and oppression must act\r\nin opposition to one or other of these rights, having no other object\r\nupon which it can possibly be employed. To preserve these from\r\nviolation, it is necessary that the constitution of parliaments be\r\nsupported in it's full vigor; and limits certainly known, be set to\r\nthe royal prerogative. And, lastly, to vindicate these rights, when\r\nactually violated or attacked, the subjects of England are entitled,\r\nin the first place, to the regular administration and free course of\r\njustice in the courts of law; next to the right of petitioning the\r\nking and parliament for redress of grievances; and lastly to the right\r\nof having and using arms for self-preservation and defence. And all\r\nthese rights and liberties it is our birthright to enjoy entire;\r\nunless where the laws of our country have laid them under necessary\r\nrestraints. Restraints in themselves so gentle and moderate, as will\r\nappear upon farther enquiry, that no man of sense or probity would\r\nwish to see them slackened. For all of us have it in our choice to do\r\nevery thing that a good man would desire to do; and are restrained\r\nfrom nothing, but what would be pernicious either to ourselves or our\r\nfellow citizens. So that this review of our situation may fully\r\njustify the observation of a learned French author, who indeed\r\ngenerally both thought and wrote in the spirit of genuine freedom[x];\r\nand who hath not scrupled to profess, even in the very bosom of his\r\nnative country, that the English is the only nation in the world,\r\nwhere political or civil liberty is the direct end of it's\r\nconstitution. Recommending therefore to the student in our laws a\r\nfarther and more accurate search into this extensive and important\r\ntitle, I shall close my remarks upon it with the expiring wish of the\r\nfamous father Paul to his country, \"ESTO PERPETUA!\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: Montesq. Sp. L. 11. 5.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SECOND.\r\n\r\nOF THE PARLIAMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE are next to treat of the rights and duties of persons, as they are\r\nmembers of society, and stand in various relations to each other.\r\nThese relations are either public or private: and we will first\r\nconsider those that are public.\r\n\r\nTHE most universal public relation, by which men are connected\r\ntogether, is that of government; namely, as governors and governed,\r\nor, in other words, as magistrates and people. Of magistrates also\r\nsome are _supreme_, in whom the sovereign power of the state resides;\r\nothers are _subordinate_, deriving all their authority from the\r\nsupreme magistrate, accountable to him for their conduct, and acting\r\nin an inferior secondary sphere.\r\n\r\nIN all tyrannical governments the supreme magistracy, or the right\r\nboth of _making_ and of _enforcing_ the laws, is vested in one and the\r\nsame man, or one and the same body of men; and wherever these two\r\npowers are united together, there can be no public liberty. The\r\nmagistrate may enact tyrannical laws, and execute them in a tyrannical\r\nmanner, since he is possessed, in quality of dispenser of justice,\r\nwith all the power which he as legislator thinks proper to give\r\nhimself. But, where the legislative and executive authority are in\r\ndistinct hands, the former will take care not to entrust the latter\r\nwith so large a power, as may tend to the subversion of it's own\r\nindependence, and therewith of the liberty of the subject. With us\r\ntherefore in England this supreme power is divided into two branches;\r\nthe one legislative, to wit, the parliament, consisting of king,\r\nlords, and commons; the other executive, consisting of the king alone.\r\nIt will be the business of this chapter to consider the British\r\nparliament; in which the legislative power, and (of course) the\r\nsupreme and absolute authority of the state, is vested by our\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nTHE original or first institution of parliaments is one of those\r\nmatters that lie so far hidden in the dark ages of antiquity, that the\r\ntracing of it out is a thing equally difficult and uncertain. The\r\nword, _parliament_, itself (or _colloquium_, as some of our historians\r\ntranslate it) is comparatively of modern date, derived from the\r\nFrench, and signifying the place where they met and conferred\r\ntogether. It was first applied to general assemblies of the states\r\nunder Louis VII in France, about the middle of the twelfth century[a].\r\nBut it is certain that, long before the introduction of the Norman\r\nlanguage into England, all matters of importance were debated and\r\nsettled in the great councils of the realm. A practice, which seems to\r\nhave been universal among the northern nations, particularly the\r\nGermans[b]; and carried by them into all the countries of Europe,\r\nwhich they overran at the dissolution of the Roman empire. Relics of\r\nwhich constitution, under various modifications and changes, are still\r\nto be met with in the diets of Poland, Germany, and Sweden, and the\r\nassembly of the estates in France; for what is there now called the\r\nparliament is only the supreme court of justice, composed of judges\r\nand advocates; which neither is in practice, nor is supposed to be in\r\ntheory, a general council of the realm.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: Mod. Un. Hist. xxiii. 307.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: _De minoribus rebus principes consultant, de majoribus\r\nomnes._ Tac. _de mor. Germ._ _c._ 11.]\r\n\r\nWITH us in England this general council hath been held immemorially,\r\nunder the several names of _michel-synoth_, or great council,\r\n_michel-gemote_ or great meeting, and more frequently _wittena-gemote_\r\nor the meeting of wise men. It was also stiled in Latin, _commune\r\nconcilium regni_, _magnum concilium regis_, _curia magna_, _conventus\r\nmagnatum vel procerum_, _assisa generalis_, and sometimes _communitas\r\nregni Angliae_[c]. We have instances of it's meeting to order the\r\naffairs of the kingdom, to make new laws, and to amend the old, or, as\r\nFleta[d] expresses it, \"_novis injuriis emersis nova constituere\r\nremedia_,\" so early as the reign of Ina king of the west Saxons, Offa\r\nking of the Mercians, and Ethelbert king of Kent, in the several\r\nrealms of the heptarchy. And, after their union, the mirrour[e]\r\ninforms us, that king Alfred ordained for a perpetual usage, that\r\nthese councils should meet twice in the year, or oftener, if need be,\r\nto treat of the government of God's people; how they should keep\r\nthemselves from sin, should live in quiet, and should receive right.\r\nOur succeeding Saxon and Danish monarchs held frequent councils of\r\nthis sort, as appears from their respective codes of laws; the titles\r\nwhereof usually speak them to be enacted, either by the king with the\r\nadvice of his wittena-gemote, or wise men, as, \"_haec sunt instituta,\r\nquae Edgarus rex consilio sapientum suorum instituit_;\" or to be\r\nenacted by those sages with the advice of the king, as, \"_haec sunt\r\njudicia, quae sapientes consilio regis Ethelstani instituerunt_;\" or\r\nlastly, to be enacted by them both together, as; \"_hae sunt\r\ninstitutiones, quas rex Edmundus et episcopi sui cum sapientibus suis\r\ninstituerunt_.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Glanvil. _l._ 13 _c._ 32. _l._ 9. _c._ 10.--Pref. 9\r\nRep.--2 Inst. 526.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: _l._ 2. _c._ 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: c. 1. §. 3.]\r\n\r\nTHERE is also no doubt but these great councils were held regularly\r\nunder the first princes of the Norman line. Glanvil, who wrote in the\r\nreign of Henry the second, speaking of the particular amount of an\r\namercement in the sheriff's court, says, it had never yet been\r\nascertained by the general assise, or assembly, but was left to the\r\ncustom of particular counties[f]. Here the general assise is spoken of\r\nas a meeting well known, and it's statutes or decisions are put in a\r\nmanifest contradistinction to customs, or the common law. And in\r\nEdward the third's time an act of parliament, made in the reign of\r\nWilliam the conqueror, was pleaded in the case of the abbey of St\r\nEdmund's-bury, and judicially allowed by the court[g].\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: _Quanta esse debeat per nullam assisam generalem\r\ndeterminatum est, sed pro consuetudine singulorum comitatuum debetur._\r\n_l._ 9. _c._ 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Year book, 21 Edw. III. 60.]\r\n\r\nHENCE it indisputably appears, that parliaments, or general councils,\r\nare coeval with the kingdom itself. How those parliaments were\r\nconstituted and composed, is another question, which has been matter\r\nof great dispute among our learned antiquarians; and, particularly,\r\nwhether the commons were summoned at all; or, if summoned, at what\r\nperiod they began to form a distinct assembly. But it is not my\r\nintention here to enter into controversies of this sort. I hold it\r\nsufficient that it is generally agreed, that in the main the\r\nconstitution of parliament, as it now stands, was marked out so long\r\nago as the seventeenth year of king John, _A.D._ 1215, in the great\r\ncharter granted by that prince; wherein he promises to summon all\r\narch-bishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and greater barons, personally;\r\nand all other tenants in chief under the crown, by the sheriff and\r\nbailiffs; to meet at a certain place, with forty days notice, to\r\nassess aids and scutages when necessary. And this constitution has\r\nsubsisted in fact at least from the year 1266, 49 Hen. III: there\r\nbeing still extant writs of that date, to summon knights, citizens,\r\nand burgesses to parliament. I proceed therefore to enquire wherein\r\nconsists this constitution of parliament, as it now stands, and has\r\nstood for the space of five hundred years. And in the prosecution of\r\nthis enquiry, I shall consider, first, the manner and time of it's\r\nassembling: secondly, it's constituent parts: thirdly, the laws and\r\ncustoms relating to parliament, considered as one aggregate body:\r\nfourthly and fifthly, the laws and customs relating to each house,\r\nseparately and distinctly taken: sixthly, the methods of proceeding,\r\nand of making statutes, in both houses: and lastly, the manner of the\r\nparliament's adjournment, prorogation, and dissolution.\r\n\r\nI. AS to the manner and time of assembling. The parliament is\r\nregularly to be summoned by the king's writ or letter, issued out of\r\nchancery by advice of the privy council, at least forty days before it\r\nbegins to sit. It is a branch of the royal prerogative, that no\r\nparliament can be convened by it's own authority, or by the authority\r\nof any, except the king alone. And this prerogative is founded upon\r\nvery good reason. For, supposing it had a right to meet spontaneously,\r\nwithout being called together, it is impossible to conceive that all\r\nthe members, and each of the houses, would agree unanimously upon the\r\nproper time and place of meeting: and if half of the members met, and\r\nhalf absented themselves, who shall determine which is really the\r\nlegislative body, the part assembled, or that which stays away? It is\r\ntherefore necessary that the parliament should be called together at a\r\ndeterminate time and place; and highly becoming it's dignity and\r\nindependence, that it should be called together by none but one of\r\nit's own constituent parts; and, of the three constituent parts, this\r\noffice can only appertain to the king; as he is a single person, whose\r\nwill may be uniform and steady; the first person in the nation, being\r\nsuperior to both houses in dignity; and the only branch of the\r\nlegislature that has a separate existence, and is capable of\r\nperforming any act at a time when no parliament is in being[h]. Nor is\r\nit an exception to this rule that, by some modern statutes, on the\r\ndemise of a king or queen, if there be then no parliament in being,\r\nthe last parliament revives, and is to sit again for six months,\r\nunless dissolved by the successor: for this revived parliament must\r\nhave been originally summoned by the crown.\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: By motives somewhat similar to these the republic of\r\nVenice was actuated, when towards the end of the seventh century it\r\nabolished the tribunes of the people, who were annually chosen by the\r\nseveral districts of the Venetian territory, and constituted a doge in\r\ntheir stead; in whom the executive power of the state at present\r\nresides. For which their historians have assigned these, as the\r\nprincipal reasons. 1. The propriety of having the executive power a\r\npart of the legislative, or senate; to which the former annual\r\nmagistrates were not admitted. 2. The necessity of having a single\r\nperson to convoke the great council when separated. Mod. Un. Hist.\r\nxxvii. 15.]\r\n\r\nIT is true, that by a statute, 16 Car. I. c. 1. it was enacted, that\r\nif the king neglected to call a parliament for three years, the peers\r\nmight assemble and issue out writs for the choosing one; and, in case\r\nof neglect of the peers, the constituents might meet and elect one\r\nthemselves. But this, if ever put in practice, would have been liable\r\nto all the inconveniences I have just now stated; and the act itself\r\nwas esteemed so highly detrimental and injurious to the royal\r\nprerogative, that it was repealed by statute 16 Car. II. c. 1. From\r\nthence therefore no precedent can be drawn.\r\n\r\nIT is also true, that the convention-parliament, which restored king\r\nCharles the second, met above a month before his return; the lords by\r\ntheir own authority, and the commons in pursuance of writs issued in\r\nthe name of the keepers of the liberty of England by authority of\r\nparliament: and that the said parliament sat till the twenty ninth of\r\nDecember, full seven months after the restoration; and enacted many\r\nlaws, several of which are still in force. But this was for the\r\nnecessity of the thing, which supersedes all law; for if they had not\r\nso met, it was morally impossible that the kingdom should have been\r\nsettled in peace. And the first thing done after the king's return,\r\nwas to pass an act declaring this to be a good parliament,\r\nnotwithstanding the defect of the king's writs[i]. So that, as the\r\nroyal prerogative was chiefly wounded by their so meeting, and as the\r\nking himself, who alone had a right to object, consented to wave the\r\nobjection, this cannot be drawn into an example in prejudice of the\r\nrights of the crown. Besides we should also remember, that it was at\r\nthat time a great doubt among the lawyers[k], whether even this\r\nhealing act made it a good parliament; and held by very many in the\r\nnegative: though it seems to have been too nice a scruple.\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: Stat. 12 Car. II. c. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: 1 Sid. 1.]\r\n\r\nIT is likewise true, that at the time of the revolution, _A.D._ 1688,\r\nthe lords and commons by their own authority, and upon the summons of\r\nthe prince of Orange, (afterwards king William) met in a convention\r\nand therein disposed of the crown and kingdom. But it must be\r\nremembered, that this assembling was upon a like principle of\r\nnecessity as at the restoration; that is, upon an apprehension that\r\nking James the second had abdicated the government, and that the\r\nthrone was thereby vacant: which apprehension of theirs was confirmed\r\nby their concurrent resolution, when they actually came together. And\r\nin such a case as the palpable vacancy of a throne, it follows _ex\r\nnecessitate rei_, that the form of the royal writs must be laid aside,\r\notherwise no parliament can ever meet again. For, let us put another\r\npossible case, and suppose, for the sake of argument, that the whole\r\nroyal line should at any time fail, and become extinct, which would\r\nindisputably vacate the throne: in this situation it seems reasonable\r\nto presume, that the body of the nation, consisting of lords and\r\ncommons, would have a right to meet and settle the government;\r\notherwise there must be no government at all. And upon this and no\r\nother principle did the convention in 1688 assemble. The vacancy of\r\nthe throne was precedent to their meeting without any royal summons,\r\nnot a consequence of it. They did not assemble without writ, and then\r\nmake the throne vacant; but the throne being previously vacant by the\r\nking's abdication, they assembled without writ, as they must do if\r\nthey assembled at all. Had the throne been full, their meeting would\r\nnot have been regular; but, as it was really empty, such meeting\r\nbecame absolutely necessary. And accordingly it is declared by statute\r\n1 W. & M. st. 1. c. 1. that this convention was really the two houses\r\nof parliament, notwithstanding the want of writs or other defects of\r\nform. So that, notwithstanding these two capital exceptions, which\r\nwere justifiable only on a principle of necessity, (and each of which,\r\nby the way, induced a revolution in the government) the rule laid down\r\nis in general certain, that the king, only, can convoke a parliament.\r\n\r\nAND this by the antient statutes of the realm[l], he is bound to do\r\nevery year, or oftener, if need be. Not that he is, or ever was,\r\nobliged by these statutes to call a _new_ parliament every year; but\r\nonly to permit a parliament to sit annually for the redress of\r\ngrievances, and dispatch of business, _if need be_. These last words\r\nare so loose and vague, that such of our monarchs as were enclined to\r\ngovern without parliaments, neglected the convoking them, sometimes\r\nfor a very considerable period, under pretence that there was no need\r\nof them. But, to remedy this, by the statute 16 Car. II. c. 1. it is\r\nenacted, that the sitting and holding of parliaments shall not be\r\nintermitted above three years at the most. And by the statute 1 W. &\r\nM. st. 2. c. 2. it is declared to be one of the rights of the people,\r\nthat for redress of all grievances, and for the amending,\r\nstrengthening, and preserving the laws, parliaments ought to be held\r\n_frequently_. And this indefinite _frequency_ is again reduced to a\r\ncertainty by statute 6 W. & M. c. 2. which enacts, as the statute of\r\nCharles the second had done before, that a new parliament shall be\r\ncalled within three years[m] after the determination of the former.\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: 4 Edw. III. c. 14. and 36 Edw. III. c. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: This is the same period, that is allowed in Sweden for\r\nintermitting their general diets, or parliamentary assemblies. Mod.\r\nUn. Hist. xxxiii. 15.]\r\n\r\nII. THE constituent parts of a parliament are the next objects of our\r\nenquiry. And these are, the king's majesty, sitting there in his royal\r\npolitical capacity, and the three estates of the realm; the lords\r\nspiritual, the lords temporal, (who sit, together with, the king, in\r\none house) and the commons, who sit by themselves in another[n]. And\r\nthe king and these three estates, together, form the great corporation\r\nor body politic of the kingdom, of which the king is said to be\r\n_caput, principium, et finis_. For upon their coming together the king\r\nmeets them, either in person or by representation; without which there\r\ncan be no beginning of a parliament[o]; and he also has alone the\r\npower of dissolving them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: 4 Inst. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: 4 Inst. 6.]\r\n\r\nIT is highly necessary for preserving the ballance of the\r\nconstitution, that the executive power should be a branch, though not\r\nthe whole, of the legislature. The total union of them, we have seen,\r\nwould be productive of tyranny; the total disjunction of them for the\r\npresent, would in the end produce the same effects, by causing that\r\nunion, against which it seems to provide. The legislature would soon\r\nbecome tyrannical, by making continual encroachments, and gradually\r\nassuming to itself the rights of the executive power. Thus the long\r\nparliament of Charles the first, while it acted in a constitutional\r\nmanner, with the royal concurrence, redressed many heavy grievances\r\nand established many salutary laws. But when the two houses assumed\r\nthe power of legislation, in exclusion of the royal authority, they\r\nsoon after assumed likewise the reins of administration; and, in\r\nconsequence of these united powers, overturned both church and state,\r\nand established a worse oppression than any they pretended to remedy.\r\nTo hinder therefore any such encroachments, the king is himself a part\r\nof the parliament: and, as this is the reason of his being so, very\r\nproperly therefore the share of legislation, which the constitution\r\nhas placed in the crown, consists in the power of _rejecting_, rathar\r\n[Transcriber's Note: rather] than _resolving_; this being sufficient\r\nto answer the end proposed. For we may apply to the royal negative, in\r\nthis instance, what Cicero observes of the negative of the Roman\r\ntribunes, that the crown has not any power of _doing_ wrong, but\r\nmerely of _preventing_ wrong from being done[p]. The crown cannot\r\nbegin of itself any alterations in the present established law; but it\r\nmay approve or disapprove of the alterations suggested and consented\r\nto by the two houses. The legislative therefore cannot abridge the\r\nexecutive power of any rights which it now has by law, without it's\r\nown consent; since the law must perpetually stand as it now does,\r\nunless all the powers will agree to alter it. And herein indeed\r\nconsists the true excellence of the English government, that all the\r\nparts of it form a mutual check upon each other. In the legislature,\r\nthe people are a check upon the nobility, and the nobility a check\r\nupon the people; by the mutual privilege of rejecting what the other\r\nhas resolved: while the king is a check upon both, which preserves the\r\nexecutive power from encroachments. And this very executive power is\r\nagain checked, and kept within due bounds by the two houses, through\r\nthe privilege they have of enquiring into, impeaching, and punishing\r\nthe conduct (not indeed of the king, which would destroy his\r\nconstitutional independence; but, which is more beneficial to the\r\npublic) of his evil and pernicious counsellors. Thus every branch of\r\nour civil polity supports and is supported, regulates and is\r\nregulated, by the rest; for the two houses naturally drawing in two\r\ndirections of opposite interest, and the prerogative in another still\r\ndifferent from them both, they mutually keep each other from exceeding\r\ntheir proper limits; while the whole is prevented from separation, and\r\nartificially connected together by the mixed nature of the crown,\r\nwhich is a part of the legislative, and the sole executive magistrate.\r\nLike three distinct powers in mechanics, they jointly impel the\r\nmachine of government in a direction different from what either,\r\nacting by themselves, would have done; but at the same time in a\r\ndirection partaking of each, and formed out of all; a direction which\r\nconstitutes the true line of the liberty and happiness of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: _Sulla--tribunis plebis sua lege injuriae faciendae\r\npotestatem ademit, auxilii ferendi reliquit._ _de LL._ 3. 9.]\r\n\r\nLET us now consider these constituent parts of the sovereign power, or\r\nparliament, each in a separate view. The king's majesty will be the\r\nsubject of the next, and many subsequent chapters, to which we must at\r\npresent refer.\r\n\r\nTHE next in order are the spiritual lords. These consist of two\r\narch-bishops, and twenty four bishops; and, at the dissolution of\r\nmonasteries by Henry VIII, consisted likewise of twenty six mitred\r\nabbots, and two priors[q]: a very considerable body, and in those\r\ntimes equal in number to the temporal nobility[r]. All these hold, or\r\nare supposed to hold, certain antient baronies under the king: for\r\nWilliam the conqueror thought proper to change the spiritual tenure,\r\nof frankalmoign or free alms, under which the bishops held their lands\r\nduring the Saxon government, into the feodal or Norman tenure by\r\nbarony; which subjected their estates to all civil charges and\r\nassessments, from which they were before exempt[s]: and, in right of\r\nsuccession to those baronies, the bishops obtained their seat in the\r\nhouse of lords[t]. But though these lords spiritual are in the eye of\r\nthe law a distinct estate from the lords temporal, and are so\r\ndistinguished in all our acts of parliament, yet in practice they are\r\nusually blended together under the one name of _the lords_; they\r\nintermix in their votes; and the majority of such intermixture binds\r\nboth estates. For if a bill should pass their house, there is no doubt\r\nof it's being effectual, though every lord spiritual should vote\r\nagainst it; of which Selden[u], and sir Edward Coke[w], give many\r\ninstances: as, on the other hand, I presume it would be equally good,\r\nif the lords temporal present were inferior to the bishops in number,\r\nand every one of those temporal lords gave his vote to reject the\r\nbill; though this sir Edward Coke seems to doubt of[x].\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: Seld. tit. hon. 2. 5. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Co. Litt. 97.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: Gilb. Hist. Exch. 55. Spelm. W.I. 291.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: Glanv. 7. 1. Co. Litt. 97. Seld. tit. hon. 2. 5. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: Baronage. p. 1. c. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: 2 Inst. 585, 6, 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: 4 Inst. 25.]\r\n\r\nTHE lords temporal consist of all the peers of the realm (the bishops\r\nnot being in strictness held to be such, but merely lords of\r\nparliament[y]) by whatever title of nobility distinguished; dukes,\r\nmarquisses, earls, viscounts, or barons; of which dignities we shall\r\nspeak more hereafter. Some of these sit by descent, as do all antient\r\npeers; some by creation, as do all new-made ones; others, since the\r\nunion with Scotland, by election, which is the case of the sixteen\r\npeers, who represent the body of the Scots nobility. Their number is\r\nindefinite, and may be encreased at will by the power of the crown:\r\nand once, in the reign of queen Anne, there was an instance of\r\ncreating no less than twelve together; in contemplation of which, in\r\nthe reign of king George the first, a bill passed the house of lords,\r\nand was countenanced by the then ministry, for limiting the number of\r\nthe peerage. This was thought by some to promise a great acquisition\r\nto the constitution, by restraining the prerogative from gaining the\r\nascendant in that august assembly, by pouring in at pleasure an\r\nunlimited number of new created lords. But the bill was ill-relished\r\nand miscarried in the house of commons, whose leading members were\r\nthen desirous to keep the avenues to the other house as open and easy\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Staunford. P.C. 153.]\r\n\r\nTHE distinction of rank and honours is necessary in every\r\nwell-governed state; in order to reward such as are eminent for their\r\nservices to the public, in a manner the most desirable to individuals,\r\nand yet without burthen to the community; exciting thereby an\r\nambitious yet laudable ardor, and generous emulation in others. And\r\nemulation, or virtuous ambition, is a spring of action which, however\r\ndangerous or invidious in a mere republic or under a despotic sway,\r\nwill certainly be attended with good effects under a free monarchy;\r\nwhere, without destroying it's existence, it's excesses may be\r\ncontinually restrained by that superior power, from which all honour\r\nis derived. Such a spirit, when nationally diffused, gives life and\r\nvigour to the community; it sets all the wheels of government in\r\nmotion, which under a wise regulator, may be directed to any\r\nbeneficial purpose; and thereby every individual may be made\r\nsubservient to the public good, while he principally means to promote\r\nhis own particular views. A body of nobility is also more peculiarly\r\nnecessary in our mixed and compounded constitution, in order to\r\nsupport the rights of both the crown and the people, by forming a\r\nbarrier to withstand the encroachments of both. It creates and\r\npreserves that gradual scale of dignity, which proceeds from the\r\npeasant to the prince; rising like a pyramid from a broad foundation,\r\nand diminishing to a point as it rises. It is this ascending and\r\ncontracting proportion that adds stability to any government; for when\r\nthe departure is sudden from one extreme to another, we may pronounce\r\nthat state to be precarious. The nobility therefore are the pillars,\r\nwhich are reared from among the people, more immediately to support\r\nthe throne; and if that falls, they must also be buried under it's\r\nruins. Accordingly, when in the last century the commons had\r\ndetermined to extirpate monarchy, they also voted the house of lords\r\nto be useless and dangerous. And since titles of nobility are thus\r\nexpedient in the state, it is also expedient that their owners should\r\nform an independent and separate branch of the legislature. If they\r\nwere confounded with the mass of the people, and like them had only a\r\nvote in electing representatives, their privileges would soon be borne\r\ndown and overwhelmed by the popular torrent, which would effectually\r\nlevel all distinctions. It is therefore highly necessary that the body\r\nof nobles should have a distinct assembly, distinct deliberations, and\r\ndistinct powers from the commons.\r\n\r\nTHE commons consist of all such men of any property in the kingdom as\r\nhave not seats in the house of lords; every one of which has a voice\r\nin parliament, either personally, or by his representatives. In a free\r\nstate, every man, who is supposed a free agent, ought to be, in some\r\nmeasure, his own governor; and therefore a branch at least of the\r\nlegislative power should reside in the whole body of the people. And\r\nthis power, when the territories of the state are small and it's\r\ncitizens easily known, should be exercised by the people in their\r\naggregate or collective capacity, as was wisely ordained in the petty\r\nrepublics of Greece, and the first rudiments of the Roman state. But\r\nthis will be highly inconvenient, when the public territory is\r\nextended to any considerable degree, and the number of citizens is\r\nencreased. Thus when, after the social war, all the burghers of Italy\r\nwere admitted free citizens of Rome, and each had a vote in the public\r\nassemblies, it became impossible to distinguish the spurious from the\r\nreal voter, and from that time all elections and popular deliberations\r\ngrew tumultuous and disorderly; which paved the way for Marius and\r\nSylla, Pompey and Caesar, to trample on the liberties of their\r\ncountry, and at last to dissolve the commonwealth. In so large a state\r\nas ours it is therefore very wisely contrived, that the people should\r\ndo that by their representatives, which it is impracticable to perform\r\nin person: representatives, chosen by a number of minute and separate\r\ndistricts, wherein all the voters are, or easily may be,\r\ndistinguished. The counties are therefore represented by knights,\r\nelected by the proprietors of lands; the cities and boroughs are\r\nrepresented by citizens and burgesses, chosen by the mercantile part\r\nor supposed trading interest of the nation; much in the same manner as\r\nthe burghers in the diet of Sweden are chosen by the corporate towns,\r\nStockholm sending four, as London does with us, other cities two, and\r\nsome only one[z]. The number of English representatives is 513, and of\r\nScots 45; in all 558. And every member, though chosen by one\r\nparticular district, when elected and returned serves for the whole\r\nrealm. For the end of his coming thither is not particular, but\r\ngeneral; not barely to advantage his constituents, but the _common_\r\nwealth; to advise his majesty (as appears from the writ of summons[a])\r\n\"_de communi consilio super negotiis quibusdam arduis et urgentibus,\r\nregem, statum et defensionem regni Angliae et ecclesiae Anglicanae\r\nconcernentibus_.\" And therefore he is not bound, like a deputy in the\r\nunited provinces, to consult with, or take the advice, of his\r\nconstituents upon any particular point, unless he himself thinks it\r\nproper or prudent so to do.\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: Mod. Un. Hist. xxxiii. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: 4 Inst. 14.]\r\n\r\nTHESE are the constituent parts of a parliament, the king, the lords\r\nspiritual and temporal, and the commons. Parts, of which each is so\r\nnecessary, that the consent of all three is required to make any new\r\nlaw that shall bind the subject. Whatever is enacted for law by one,\r\nor by two only, of the three is no statute; and to it no regard is\r\ndue, unless in matters relating to their own privileges. For though,\r\nin the times of madness and anarchy, the commons once passed a\r\nvote[b], \"that whatever is enacted or declared for law by the commons\r\nin parliament assembled hath the force of law; and all the people of\r\nthis nation are concluded thereby, although the consent and\r\nconcurrence of the king or house of peers be not had thereto;\" yet,\r\nwhen the constitution was restored in all it's forms, it was\r\nparticularly enacted by statute 13 Car. II. c. 1. that if any person\r\nshall maliciously or advisedly affirm, that both or either of the\r\nhouses of parliament have any legislative authority without the king,\r\nsuch person shall incur all the penalties of a praemunire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: 4 Jan. 1648.]\r\n\r\nIII. WE are next to examine the laws and customs relating to\r\nparliament, thus united together and considered as one aggregate body.\r\n\r\nTHE power and jurisdiction of parliament, says sir Edward Coke[c], is\r\nso transcendent and absolute, that it cannot be confined, either for\r\ncauses or persons, within any bounds. And of this high court he adds,\r\nit may be truly said \"_si antiquitatem spectes, est vetustissima; si\r\ndignitatem, est honoratissima; si juridictionem, est capacissima_.\" It\r\nhath sovereign and uncontrolable authority in making, confirming,\r\nenlarging, restraining, abrogating, repealing, reviving, and\r\nexpounding of laws, concerning matters of all possible denominations,\r\necclesiastical, or temporal, civil, military, maritime, or criminal:\r\nthis being the place where that absolute despotic power, which must in\r\nall governments reside somewhere, is entrusted by the constitution of\r\nthese kingdoms. All mischiefs and grievances, operations and remedies,\r\nthat transcend the ordinary course of the laws, are within the reach\r\nof this extraordinary tribunal. It can regulate or new model the\r\nsuccession to the crown; as was done in the reign of Henry VIII and\r\nWilliam III. It can alter the established religion of the land; as was\r\ndone in a variety of instances, in the reigns of king Henry VIII and\r\nhis three children. It can change and create afresh even the\r\nconstitution of the kingdom and of parliaments themselves; as was done\r\nby the act of union, and the several statutes for triennial and\r\nseptennial elections. It can, in short, do every thing that is not\r\nnaturally impossible; and therefore some have not scrupled to call\r\nit's power, by a figure rather too bold, the omnipotence of\r\nparliament. True it is, that what they do, no authority upon earth can\r\nundo. So that it is a matter most essential to the liberties of this\r\nkingdom, that such members be delegated to this important trust, as\r\nare most eminent for their probity, their fortitude, and their\r\nknowlege; for it was a known apothegm of the great lord treasurer\r\nBurleigh, \"that England could never be ruined but by a parliament:\"\r\nand, as sir Matthew Hale observes[d], this being the highest and\r\ngreatest court, over which none other can have jurisdiction in the\r\nkingdom, if by any means a misgovernment should any way fall upon it,\r\nthe subjects of this kingdom are left without all manner of remedy. To\r\nthe same purpose the president Montesquieu, though I trust too\r\nhastily, presages[e]; that as Rome, Sparta, and Carthage have lost\r\ntheir liberty and perished, so the constitution of England will in\r\ntime lose it's liberty, will perish: it will perish, whenever the\r\nlegislative power shall become more corrupt than the executive.\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: 4 Inst. 36.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: of parliaments, 49.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Sp. L. 11. 6.]\r\n\r\nIT must be owned that Mr Locke[f], and other theoretical writers, have\r\nheld, that \"there remains still inherent in the people a supreme power\r\nto remove or alter the legislative, when they find the legislative act\r\ncontrary to the trust reposed in them: for when such trust is abused,\r\nit is thereby forfeited, and devolves to those who gave it.\" But\r\nhowever just this conclusion may be in theory, we cannot adopt it, nor\r\nargue from it, under any dispensation of government at present\r\nactually existing. For this devolution of power, to the people at\r\nlarge, includes in it a dissolution of the whole form of government\r\nestablished by that people, reduces all the members to their original\r\nstate of equality, and by annihilating the sovereign power repeals all\r\npositive laws whatsoever before enacted. No human laws will therefore\r\nsuppose a case, which at once must destroy all law, and compel men to\r\nbuild afresh upon a new foundation; nor will they make provision for\r\nso desperate an event, as must render all legal provisions\r\nineffectual. So long therefore as the English constitution lasts, we\r\nmay venture to affirm, that the power of parliament is absolute and\r\nwithout control.\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: on Gov. p. 2. §. 149, 227.]\r\n\r\nIN order to prevent the mischiefs that might arise, by placing this\r\nextensive authority in hands that are either incapable, or else\r\nimproper, to manage it, it is provided that no one shall sit or vote\r\nin either house of parliament, unless he be twenty one years of age.\r\nThis is expressly declared by statute 7 & 8 W. III. c. 25. with regard\r\nto the house of commons; though a minor was incapacitated before from\r\nsitting in either house, by the law and custom of parliament[g]. To\r\nprevent crude innovations in religion and government, it is enacted by\r\nstatute 30 Car. II. st. 2. and 1 Geo. I. c. 13. that no member shall\r\nvote or sit in either house, till he hath in the presence of the house\r\ntaken the oaths of allegiance, supremacy, and abjuration, and\r\nsubscribed and repeated the declaration against transubstantiation,\r\nand invocation of saints, and the sacrifice of the mass. To prevent\r\ndangers that may arise to the kingdom from foreign attachments,\r\nconnexions, or dependencies, it is enacted by the 12 & 13 W. III. c.\r\n2. that no alien, born out of the dominions of the crown of Great\r\nBritain, even though he be naturalized, shall be capable of being a\r\nmember of either house of parliament.\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: 4 Inst. 47.]\r\n\r\nFARTHER: as every court of justice hath laws and customs for it's\r\ndirection, some the civil and canon, some the common law, others their\r\nown peculiar laws and customs, so the high court of parliament hath\r\nalso it's own peculiar law, called the _lex et consuetudo\r\nparliamenti_; a law which sir Edward Coke[h] observes, is \"_ab omnibus\r\nquaerenda, a multis ignorata, a paucis cognita_.\" It will not\r\ntherefore be expected that we should enter into the examination of\r\nthis law, with any degree of minuteness; since, as the same learned\r\nauthor assures us[i], it is much better to be learned out of the rolls\r\nof parliament, and other records, and by precedents, and continual\r\nexperience, than can be expressed by any one man. It will be\r\nsufficient to observe, that the whole of the law and custom of\r\nparliament has it's original from this one maxim; \"that whatever\r\nmatter arises concerning either house of parliament, ought to be\r\nexamined, discussed, and adjudged in that house to which it relates,\r\nand not elsewhere.\" Hence, for instance, the lords will not suffer\r\nthe commons to interfere in settling a claim of peerage; the commons\r\nwill not allow the lords to judge of the election of a burgess; nor\r\nwill either house permit the courts of law to examine the merits of\r\neither case. But the maxims upon which they proceed, together with\r\ntheir method of proceeding, rest entirely in the breast of the\r\nparliament itself; and are not defined and ascertained by any\r\nparticular stated laws.\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: 1 Inst. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: 4 Inst. 50.]\r\n\r\nTHE _privileges_ of parliament are likewise very large and indefinite;\r\nwhich has occasioned an observation, that the principal privilege of\r\nparliament consisted in this, that it's privileges were not certainly\r\nknown to any but the parliament itself. And therefore when in 31 Hen.\r\nVI the house of lords propounded a question to the judges touching the\r\nprivilege of parliament, the chief justice, in the name of his\r\nbrethren, declared, \"that they ought not to make answer to that\r\nquestion; for it hath not been used aforetime that the justices should\r\nin any wise determine the privileges of the high court of parliament;\r\nfor it is so high and mighty in his nature, that it may make law; and\r\nthat which is law, it may make no law; and the determination and\r\nknowlege of that privilege belongs to the lords of parliament, and not\r\nto the justices[k].\" [Transcriber's Note: missing end quotation mark\r\nadded] Privilege of parliament was principally established, in order\r\nto protect it's members not only from being molested by their\r\nfellow-subjects, but also more especially from being oppressed by the\r\npower of the crown. If therefore all the privileges of parliament were\r\nonce to be set down and ascertained, and no privilege to be allowed\r\nbut what was so defined and determined, it were easy for the executive\r\npower to devise some new case, not within the line of privilege, and\r\nunder pretence thereof to harass any refractory member and violate the\r\nfreedom of parliament. The dignity and independence of the two houses\r\nare therefore in great measure preserved by keeping their privileges\r\nindefinite. Some however of the more notorious privileges of the\r\nmembers of either house are, privilege of speech, of person, of their\r\ndomestics, and of their lands and goods. As to the first, privilege of\r\nspeech, it is declared by the statute 1 W. & M. st. 2. c. 2. as one of\r\nthe liberties of the people, \"that the freedom of speech, and debates,\r\nand proceedings in parliament, ought not to be impeached or questioned\r\nin any court or place out of parliament.\" And this freedom of speech\r\nis particularly demanded of the king in person, by the speaker of the\r\nhouse of commons, at the opening of every new parliament. So likewise\r\nare the other privileges, of person, servants, lands and goods; which\r\nare immunities as antient as Edward the confessor, in whose laws[l] we\r\nfind this precept. \"_Ad synodos venientibus, sive summoniti sint, sive\r\nper se quid agendum habuerint, sit summa pax_:\" and so too, in the old\r\nGothic constitutions, \"_extenditur haec pax et securitas ad\r\nquatuordecim dies, convocato regni senatu_[m].\" This includes not only\r\nprivilege from illegal violence, but also from legal arrests, and\r\nseisures by process from the courts of law. To assault by violence a\r\nmember of either house, or his menial servants, is a high contempt of\r\nparliament, and there punished with the utmost severity. It has\r\nlikewise peculiar penalties annexed to it in the courts of law, by the\r\nstatutes 5 Hen. IV. c. 6. and 11 Hen. VI. c. 11. Neither can any\r\nmember of either house be arrested and taken into custody, nor served\r\nwith any process of the courts of law; nor can his menial servants be\r\narrested; nor can any entry be made on his lands; nor can his goods be\r\ndistrained or seised; without a breach of the privilege of parliament.\r\nThese privileges however, which derogate from the common law, being\r\nonly indulged to prevent the member's being diverted from the public\r\nbusiness, endure no longer than the session of parliament, save only\r\nas to the freedom of his person: which in a peer is for ever sacred\r\nand inviolable; and in a commoner for forty days after every\r\nprorogation, and forty days before the next appointed meeting[n];\r\nwhich is now in effect as long as the parliament subsists, it seldom\r\nbeing prorogued for more than fourscore days at a time. But this\r\nprivilege of person does not hold in crimes of such public malignity\r\nas treason, felony, or breach of the peace[o]; or rather perhaps in\r\nsuch crimes for which surety of the peace may be required. As to all\r\nother privileges which obstruct the ordinary course of justice, they\r\ncease by the statutes 12 W. III. c. 3. and 11 Geo. II. c. 24.\r\nimmediately after the dissolution or prorogation of the parliament, or\r\nadjournment of the houses for above a fortnight; and during these\r\nrecesses a peer, or member of the house of commons, may be sued like\r\nan ordinary subject, and in consequence of such suits may be\r\ndispossessed of his lands and goods. In these cases the king has also\r\nhis prerogative: he may sue for his debts, though not arrest the\r\nperson of a member, during the sitting of parliament; and by statute 2\r\n& 3 Ann. c. 18. a member may be sued during the sitting of parliament\r\nfor any misdemesnor or breach of trust in a public office. Likewise,\r\nfor the benefit of commerce, it is provided by statute 4 Geo. III. c.\r\n33, that any trader, having privilege of parliament, may be served\r\nwith legal process for any just debt, (to the amount of 100_l._) and\r\nunless he makes satisfaction within two months, it shall be deemed an\r\nact of bankruptcy; and that commissions of bankrupt may be issued\r\nagainst such privileged traders, in like manner as against any other.\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Seld. Baronage. part. 1. c. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: _cap._ 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: Stiernh. _de jure Goth._ _l._ 3. _c._ 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: 2 Lev. 72.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: 4 Inst. 25.]\r\n\r\nTHESE are the general heads of the laws and customs relating to\r\nparliament, considered as one aggregate body. We will next proceed to\r\n\r\nIV. THE laws and customs relating to the house of lords in particular.\r\nThese, if we exclude their judicial capacity, which will be more\r\nproperly treated of in the third and fourth books of these\r\ncommentaries, will take up but little of our time.\r\n\r\nONE very antient privilege is that declared by the charter of the\r\nforest[p], confirmed in parliament 9 Hen. III; viz. that every lord\r\nspiritual or temporal summoned to parliament, and passing through the\r\nking's forests, may, both in going and returning, kill one or two of\r\nthe king's deer without warrant; in view of the forester, if he be\r\npresent; or on blowing a horn if he be absent, that he may not seem to\r\ntake the king's venison by stealth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: cap. 11.]\r\n\r\nIN the next place they have a right to be attended, and constantly\r\nare, by the judges of the court of king's bench and commonpleas, and\r\nsuch of the barons of the exchequer as are of the degree of the coif,\r\nor have been made serjeants at law; as likewise by the masters of the\r\ncourt of chancery; for their advice in point of law, and for the\r\ngreater dignity of their proceedings. The secretaries of state, the\r\nattorney and solicitor general, and the rest of the king's learned\r\ncounsel being serjeants, were also used to attend the house of peers,\r\nand have to this day their regular writs of summons issued out at the\r\nbeginning of every parliament[q]: but, as many of them have of late\r\nyears been members of the house of commons, their attendance is fallen\r\ninto disuse.\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: Stat. 31 Hen. VIII. c. 10. Smith's commonw. b. 2. c. 3.\r\nMoor. 551. 4 Inst. 4. Hale of parl. 140.]\r\n\r\nANOTHER privilege is, that every peer, by licence obtained from the\r\nking, may make another lord of parliament his proxy, to vote for him\r\nin his absence[r]. A privilege which a member of the other house can\r\nby no means have, as he is himself but a proxy for a multitude of\r\nother people[s].\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Seld. baronage. p. 1. c. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: 4 Inst. 12.]\r\n\r\nEACH peer has also a right, by leave of the house, when a vote passes\r\ncontrary to his sentiments, to enter his dissent on the journals of\r\nthe house, with the reasons for such dissent; which is usually stiled\r\nhis protest.\r\n\r\nALL bills likewise, that may in their consequences any way affect the\r\nrights of the peerage, are by the custom of parliament to have their\r\nfirst rise and beginning in the house of peers, and to suffer no\r\nchanges or amendments in the house of commons.\r\n\r\nTHERE is also one statute peculiarly relative to the house of lords; 6\r\nAnn. c. 23. which regulates the election of the sixteen representative\r\npeers of North Britain, in consequence of the twenty second and twenty\r\nthird articles of the union: and for that purpose prescribes the\r\noaths, &c, to be taken by the electors; directs the mode of balloting;\r\nprohibits the peers electing from being attended in an unusual manner;\r\nand expressly provides, that no other matter shall be treated of in\r\nthat assembly, save only the election, on pain of incurring a\r\npraemunire.\r\n\r\nV. THE peculiar laws and customs of the house of commons relate\r\nprincipally to the raising of taxes, and the elections of members to\r\nserve in parliament.\r\n\r\nFIRST, with regard to taxes: it is the antient indisputable privilege\r\nand right of the house of commons, that all grants of subsidies or\r\nparliamentary aids do begin in their house, and are first bestowed by\r\nthem[t]; although their grants are not effectual to all intents and\r\npurposes, until they have the assent of the other two branches of the\r\nlegislature. The general reason, given for this exclusive privilege of\r\nthe house of commons, is, that the supplies are raised upon the body\r\nof the people, and therefore it is proper that they alone should have\r\nthe right of taxing themselves. This reason would be unanswerable, if\r\nthe commons taxed none but themselves: but it is notorious, that a\r\nvery large share of property is in the possession of the house of\r\nlords; that this property is equally taxable, and taxed, as the\r\nproperty of the commons; and therefore the commons not being the\r\n_sole_ persons taxed, this cannot be the reason of their having the\r\n_sole_ right of raising and modelling the supply. The true reason,\r\narising from the spirit of our constitution, seems to be this. The\r\nlords being a permanent hereditary body, created at pleasure by the\r\nking, are supposed more liable to be influenced by the crown, and when\r\nonce influenced to continue so, than the commons, who are a temporary\r\nelective body, freely nominated by the people. It would therefore be\r\nextremely dangerous, to give them any power of framing new taxes for\r\nthe subject: it is sufficient, that they have a power of rejecting, if\r\nthey think the commons too lavish or improvident in their grants. But\r\nso reasonably jealous are the commons of this valuable privilege, that\r\nherein they will not suffer the other house to exert any power but\r\nthat of rejecting; they will not permit the least alteration or\r\namendment to be made by the lords to the mode of taxing the people by\r\na money bill; under which appellation are included all bills, by which\r\nmoney is directed to be raised upon the subject, for any purpose or in\r\nany shape whatsoever; either for the exigencies of government, and\r\ncollected from the kingdom in general, as the land tax; or for private\r\nbenefit, and collected in any particular district; as by turnpikes,\r\nparish rates, and the like. Yet sir Matthew Hale[u] mentions one case,\r\nfounded on the practice of parliament in the reign of Henry VI[w],\r\nwherein he thinks the lords may alter a money bill; and that is, if\r\nthe commons grant a tax, as that of tonnage and poundage, for _four_\r\nyears; and the lords alter it to a less time, as for _two_ years;\r\nhere, he says, the bill need not be sent back to the commons for their\r\nconcurrence, but may receive the royal assent without farther\r\nceremony; for the alteration of the lords is consistent with the grant\r\nof the commons. But such an experiment will hardly be repeated by the\r\nlords, under the present improved idea of the privilege of the house\r\nof commons: and, in any case where a money bill is remanded to the\r\ncommons, all amendments in the mode of taxation are sure to be\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: 4 Inst. 29.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: on parliaments, 65, 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: Year book, 33 Hen. VI. 17.]\r\n\r\nNEXT, with regard to the elections of knights, citizens, and\r\nburgesses; we may observe that herein consists the exercise of the\r\ndemocratical part of our constitution: for in a democracy there can be\r\nno exercise of sovereignty but by suffrage, which is the declaration\r\nof the people's will. In all democracies therefore it is of the utmost\r\nimportance to regulate by whom, and in what manner, the suffrages are\r\nto be given. And the Athenians were so justly jealous of this\r\nprerogative, that a stranger, who interfered in the assemblies of the\r\npeople, was punished by their laws with death: because such a man was\r\nesteemed guilty of high treason, by usurping those rights of\r\nsovereignty, to which he had no title. In England, where the people do\r\nnot debate in a collective body but by representation, the exercise of\r\nthis sovereignty consists in the choice of representatives. The laws\r\nhave therefore very strictly guarded against usurpation or abuse of\r\nthis power, by many salutary provisions; which may be reduced to these\r\nthree points, 1. The qualifications of the electors. 2. The\r\nqualifications of the elected. 3. The proceedings at elections.\r\n\r\n1. AS to the qualifications of the electors. The true reason of\r\nrequiring any qualification, with regard to property, in voters, is to\r\nexclude such persons as are in so mean a situation that they are\r\nesteemed to have no will of their own. If these persons had votes,\r\nthey would be tempted to dispose of them under some undue influence or\r\nother. This would give a great, an artful, or a wealthy man, a larger\r\nshare in elections than is consistent with general liberty. If it were\r\nprobable that every man would give his vote freely, and without\r\ninfluence of any kind, then, upon the true theory and genuine\r\nprinciples of liberty, every member of the community, however poor,\r\nshould have a vote in electing those delegates, to whose charge is\r\ncommitted the disposal of his property, his liberty, and his life.\r\nBut, since that can hardly be expected in persons of indigent\r\nfortunes, or such as are under the immediate dominion of others, all\r\npopular states have been obliged to establish certain qualifications;\r\nwhereby some, who are suspected to have no will of their own, are\r\nexcluded from voting, in order to set other individuals, whose wills\r\nmay be supposed independent, more thoroughly upon a level with each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nAND this constitution of suffrages is framed upon a wiser principle\r\nthan either of the methods of voting, by centuries, or by tribes,\r\namong the Romans. In the method by centuries, instituted by Servius\r\nTullius, it was principally property, and not numbers that turned the\r\nscale: in the method by tribes, gradually introduced by the tribunes\r\nof the people, numbers only were regarded and property entirely\r\noverlooked. Hence the laws passed by the former method had usually too\r\ngreat a tendency to aggrandize the patricians or rich nobles; and\r\nthose by the latter had too much of a levelling principle. Our\r\nconstitution steers between the two extremes. Only such as are\r\nentirely excluded, as can have no will of their own: there is hardly a\r\nfree agent to be found, but what is entitled to a vote in some place\r\nor other in the kingdom. Nor is comparative wealth, or property,\r\nentirely disregarded in elections; for though the richest man has only\r\none vote at one place, yet if his property be at all diffused, he has\r\nprobably a right to vote at more places than one, and therefore has\r\nmany representatives. This is the spirit of our constitution: not that\r\nI assert it is in fact quite so perfect as I have here endeavoured to\r\ndescribe it; for, if any alteration might be wished or suggested in\r\nthe present frame of parliaments, it should be in favour of a more\r\ncomplete representation of the people.\r\n\r\nBUT to return to our qualifications; and first those of electors for\r\nknights of the shire. 1. By statute 8 Hen. VI. c. 7. and 10 Hen. VI.\r\nc. 2. The knights of the shires shall be chosen of people dwelling in\r\nthe same counties; whereof every man shall have freehold to the value\r\nof forty shillings by the year within the county; which by subsequent\r\nstatutes is to be clear of all charges and deductions, except\r\nparliamentary and parochial taxes. The knights of shires are the\r\nrepresentatives of the landholders, or landed interest, of the\r\nkingdom: their electors must therefore have estates in lands or\r\ntenements, within the county represented: these estates must be\r\nfreehold, that is, for term of life at least; because beneficial\r\nleases for long terms of years were not in use at the making of these\r\nstatutes, and copyholders were then little better than villeins,\r\nabsolutely dependent upon their lord: this freehold must be of forty\r\nshillings annual value; because that sum would then, with proper\r\nindustry, furnish all the necessaries of life, and render the\r\nfreeholder, if he pleased, an independent man. For bishop Fleetwood,\r\nin his _chronicon pretiosum_ written about sixty years since, has\r\nfully proved forty shillings in the reign of Henry VI to have been\r\nequal to twelve pounds _per annum_ in the reign of queen Anne; and, as\r\nthe value of money is very considerably lowered since the bishop\r\nwrote, I think we may fairly conclude, from this and other\r\ncircumstances, that what was equivalent to twelve pounds in his days\r\nis equivalent to twenty at present. The other less important\r\nqualifications of the electors for counties in England and Wales may\r\nbe collected from the statutes cited in the margin[x]; which direct,\r\n2. That no person under twenty one years of age shall be capable of\r\nvoting for any member. This extends to all sorts of members, as well\r\nfor boroughs as counties; as does also the next, viz. 3. That no\r\nperson convicted of perjury, or subornation of perjury, shall be\r\ncapable of voting in any election. 4. That no person shall vote in\r\nright of any freehold, granted to him fraudulently to qualify him to\r\nvote. Fraudulent grants are such as contain an agreement to reconvey,\r\nor to defeat the estate granted; which agreements are made void, and\r\nthe estate is absolutely vested in the person to whom it is so\r\ngranted. And, to guard the better against such frauds, it is farther\r\nprovided, 5. That every voter shall have been in the actual\r\npossession, or receipt of the profits, of his freehold to his own use\r\nfor twelve calendar months before; except it came to him by descent,\r\nmarriage, marriage settlement, will, or promotion to a benefice or\r\noffice. 6. That no person shall vote in respect of an annuity or\r\nrentcharge, unless registered with the clerk of the peace twelve\r\ncalendar months before. 7. That in mortgaged or trust-estates, the\r\nperson in possession, under the abovementioned restrictions, shall\r\nhave the vote. 8. That only one person shall be admitted to vote for\r\nany one house or tenement, to prevent the splitting of freeholds. 9.\r\nThat no estate shall qualify a voter, unless the estate has been\r\nassessed to some land tax aid, at least twelve months before the\r\nelection. 10. That no tenant by copy of court roll shall be permitted\r\nto vote as a freeholder. Thus much for the electors in counties.\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: 7 & 8 W. III. c. 25. 10 Ann. c. 23. 2 Geo. II. c. 21. 18\r\nGeo. II. c. 18. 31 Geo. II. c. 14. 3 Geo. III. c. 24.]\r\n\r\nAS for the electors of citizens and burgesses, these are supposed to\r\nbe the mercantile part or trading interest of this kingdom. But as\r\ntrade is of a fluctuating nature, and seldom long fixed in a place, it\r\nwas formerly left to the crown to summon, _pro re nata_, the most\r\nflourishing towns to send representatives to parliament. So that as\r\ntowns encreased in trade, and grew populous, they were admitted to a\r\nshare in the legislature. But the misfortune is, that the deserted\r\nboroughs continued to be summoned, as well as those to whom their\r\ntrade and inhabitants were transferred; except a few which petitioned\r\nto be eased of the expence, then usual, of maintaining their members:\r\nfour shillings a day being allowed for a knight of the shire, and two\r\nshillings for a citizen or burgess; which was the rate of wages\r\nestablished in the reign of Edward III[y]. Hence the members for\r\nboroughs now bear above a quadruple proportion to those for counties,\r\nand the number of parliament men is increased since Fortescue's time,\r\nin the reign of Henry the sixth, from 300 to upwards of 500, exclusive\r\nof those for Scotland. The universities were in general not empowered\r\nto send burgesses to parliament; though once, in 28 Edw. I. when a\r\nparliament was summoned to consider of the king's right to Scotland,\r\nthere were issued writs, which required the university of Oxford to\r\nsend up four or five, and that of Cambridge two or three, of their\r\nmost discreet and learned lawyers for that purpose[z]. But it was king\r\nJames the first, who indulged them with the permanent privilege to\r\nsend constantly two of their own body; to serve for those students\r\nwho, though useful members of the community, were neither concerned in\r\nthe landed nor the trading interest; and to protect in the legislature\r\nthe rights of the republic of letters. The right of election in\r\nboroughs is various, depending intirely on the several charters,\r\ncustoms, and constitutions of the respective places, which has\r\noccasioned infinite disputes; though now by statute 2 Geo. II. c. 24.\r\nthe right of voting for the future shall be allowed according to the\r\nlast determination of the house of commons concerning it. And by\r\nstatute 3 Geo. III. c. 15. no freeman of any city or borough (other\r\nthan such as claim by birth, marriage, or servitude) shall be intitled\r\nto vote therein unless he hath been admitted to his freedom twelve\r\ncalendar months before.\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: 4 Inst. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: Prynne parl. writs. I. 345.]\r\n\r\n2. OUR second point is the qualification of persons to be elected\r\nmembers of the house of commons. This depends upon the law and custom\r\nof parliaments[a], and the statutes referred to in the margin[b]. And\r\nfrom these it appears, 1. That they must not be aliens born, or\r\nminors. 2. That they must not be any of the twelve judges, because\r\nthey sit in the lords' house; nor of the clergy, for they sit in the\r\nconvocation; nor persons attainted of treason or felony, for they are\r\nunfit to sit any where[c]. 3. That sheriffs of counties, and mayors\r\nand bailiffs of boroughs, are not eligible in their respective\r\njurisdictions, as being returning officers[d]; but that sheriffs of\r\none county are eligible to be knights of another[e]. 4. That, in\r\nstrictness, all members ought to be inhabitants of the places for\r\nwhich they are chosen: but this is intirely disregarded. 5. That no\r\npersons concerned in the management of any duties or taxes created\r\nsince 1692, except the commissioners of the treasury, nor any of the\r\nofficers following, (viz. commissioners of prizes, transports, sick\r\nand wounded, wine licences, navy, and victualling; secretaries or\r\nreceivers of prizes; comptrollers of the army accounts; agents for\r\nregiments; governors of plantations and their deputies; officers of\r\nMinorca or Gibraltar; officers of the excise and customs; clerks or\r\ndeputies in the several offices of the treasury, exchequer, navy,\r\nvictualling, admiralty, pay of the army or navy, secretaries of state,\r\nsalt, stamps, appeals, wine licences, hackney coaches, hawkers and\r\npedlars) nor any persons that hold any new office under the crown\r\ncreated since 1705, are capable of being elected members. 6. That no\r\nperson having a pension under the crown during pleasure, or for any\r\nterm of years, is capable of being elected. 7. That if any member\r\naccepts an office under the crown, except an officer in the army or\r\nnavy accepting a new commission, his seat is void; but such member is\r\ncapable of being re-elected. 8. That all knights of the shire shall be\r\nactual knights, or such notable esquires and gentlemen, as have\r\nestates sufficient to be knights, and by no means of the degree of\r\nyeomen. This is reduced to a still greater certainty, by ordaining, 9.\r\nThat every knight of a shire shall have a clear estate of freehold or\r\ncopyhold to the value of six hundred pounds _per annum_, and every\r\ncitizen and burgess to the value of three hundred pounds; except the\r\neldest sons of peers, and of persons qualified to be knights of\r\nshires, and except the members for the two universities: which\r\nsomewhat ballances the ascendant which the boroughs have gained over\r\nthe counties, by obliging the trading interest to make choice of\r\nlanded men: and of this qualification the member must make oath, and\r\ngive in the particulars in writing, at the time of his taking his\r\nseat. But, subject to these restrictions and disqualifications, every\r\nsubject of the realm is eligible of common right. It was therefore an\r\nunconstitutional prohibition, which was inserted in the king's writs,\r\nfor the parliament holden at Coventry, 6 Hen. IV, that no apprentice\r\nor other man of the law should be elected a knight of the shire\r\ntherein[f]: in return for which, our law books and historians[g] have\r\nbranded this parliament with the name of _parliamentum indoctum_, or\r\nthe lack-learning parliament; and sir Edward Coke observes with some\r\nspleen[h], that there was never a good law made thereat.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: 4 Inst. 47.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: 1 Hen. V. c. 1. 23 Hen. VI. c. 15. 1 W. & M. st. 2. c. 2.\r\n5 & 6 W. & M. c. 7. 11 & 12 W. III. c. 2. 12 & 13 W. III. c. 10. 6\r\nAnn. c. 7. 9 Ann. c. 5. 1 Geo. I. c. 56. 15 Geo.

THE third point regarding elections, is the method of proceeding\r\ntherein. This is also regulated by the law of parliament, and the\r\nseveral statutes referred to in the margin[i]; all which I shall\r\nendeavour to blend together, and extract out of them a summary account\r\nof the method of proceeding to elections.\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: 7 Hen. IV. c. 15. 8 Hen. VI. c. 7. 23 Hen. VI. c. 15. 1\r\nW. & M. st. 1. c. 2. 2 W. & M. st. 1. c. 7. 5 & 6 W. & M. c. 20. 7 W.\r\nIII. c. 4. 7 & 8 W. III. c. 7. and c. 25. 10 & 11 W.

II. c.\r\n28.]\r\n\r\nAS soon as the parliament is summoned, the lord chancellor, (or if a\r\nvacancy happens during parliament, the speaker, by order of the house)\r\nsends his warrant to the clerk of the crown in chancery; who thereupon\r\nissues out writs to the sheriff of every county, for the election of\r\nall the members to serve for that county, and every city and borough\r\ntherein. Within three days after the receipt of this writ, the sheriff\r\nis to send his precept, under his seal, to the proper returning\r\nofficers of the cities and boroughs, commanding them to elect their\r\nmembers; and the said returning officers are to proceed to election\r\nwithin eight days from the receipt of the precept, giving four days\r\nnotice of the same; and to return the persons chosen, together with\r\nthe precept, to the sheriff.\r\n\r\nBUT elections of knights of the shire must be proceeded to by the\r\nsheriffs themselves in person, at the next county court that shall\r\nhappen after the delivery of the writ. The county court is a court\r\nheld every month or oftener by the sheriff, intended to try little\r\ncauses not exceeding the value of forty shillings, in what part of the\r\ncounty he pleases to appoint for that purpose: but for the election of\r\nknights of the shire, it must be held at the most usual place. If the\r\ncounty court falls upon the day of delivering the writ, or within six\r\ndays after, the sheriff may adjourn the court and election to some\r\nother convenient time, not longer than sixteen days, nor shorter than\r\nten; but he cannot alter the place, without the consent of all the\r\ncandidates; and in all such cases ten days public notice must be given\r\nof the time and place of the election.\r\n\r\nAND, as it is essential to the very being of parliament that elections\r\nshould be absolutely free, therefore all undue influences upon the\r\nelectors are illegal, and strongly prohibited. For Mr Locke[k] ranks\r\nit among those breaches of trust in the executive magistrate, which\r\naccording to his notions amount to a dissolution of the government,\r\n\"if he employs the force, treasure, and offices of the society to\r\ncorrupt the representatives, or openly to preingage the electors, and\r\nprescribe what manner of persons shall be chosen. For thus to regulate\r\ncandidates and electors, and new model the ways of election, what is\r\nit, says he, but to cut up the government by the roots, and poison the\r\nvery fountain of public security?\" As soon therefore as the time and\r\nplace of election, either in counties or boroughs, are fixed, all\r\nsoldiers quartered in the place are to remove, at least one day before\r\nthe election, to the distance of two miles or more; and not return\r\ntill one day after the poll is ended. Riots likewise have been\r\nfrequently determined to make an election void. By vote also of the\r\nhouse of commons, to whom alone belongs the power of determining\r\ncontested elections, no lord of parliament, or lord lieutenant of a\r\ncounty, hath any right to interfere in the election of commoners; and,\r\nby statute, the lord warden of the cinque ports shall not recommend\r\nany members there. If any officer of the excise, customs, stamps, or\r\ncertain other branches of the revenue, presumes to intermeddle in\r\nelections, by persuading any voter or dissuading him, he forfeits\r\n100_l_, and is disabled to hold any office.\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: on Gov. part. 2. §. 222.]\r\n\r\nTHUS are the electors of one branch of the legislature secured from\r\nany undue influence from either of the other two, and from all\r\nexternal violence and compulsion. But the greatest danger is that in\r\nwhich themselves co-operate, by the infamous practice of bribery and\r\ncorruption. To prevent which it is enacted that no candidate shall,\r\nafter the date (usually called the _teste_) of the writs, or after the\r\nvacancy, give any money or entertainment to his electors, or promise\r\nto give any, either to particular persons, or to the place in general,\r\nin order to his being elected; on pain of being incapable to serve for\r\nthat place in parliament. And if any money, gift, office, employment,\r\nor reward be given or promised to be given to any voter, at any time,\r\nin order to influence him to give or withhold his vote, both he that\r\ntakes and he that offers such bribe forfeits 500_l_, and is for ever\r\ndisabled from voting and holding any office in any corporation;\r\nunless, before conviction, he will discover some other offender of the\r\nsame kind, and then he is indemnified for his own offence[l]. The\r\nfirst instance that occurs of election bribery, was so early as 13\r\nEliz. when one Thomas Longe (being a simple man and of small capacity\r\nto serve in parliament) acknowleged that he had given the returning\r\nofficer and others of the borough of Westbury four pounds to be\r\nreturned member, and was for that premium elected. But for this\r\noffence the borough was amerced, the member was removed, and the\r\nofficer fined and imprisoned[m]. But, as this practice hath since\r\ntaken much deeper and more universal root, it hath occasioned the\r\nmaking of these wholesome statutes; to complete the efficacy of which,\r\nthere is nothing wanting but resolution and integrity to put them in\r\nstrict execution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: In like manner the Julian law _de ambitu_ inflicts fines\r\nand infamy upon all who were guilty of corruption at elections; but,\r\nif the person guilty convicted another offender, he was restored to\r\nhis credit again. _Ff._ 48. 14. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: 4 Inst. 23. Hale of parl. 112. Com. Journ. 10 & 11 May\r\n1571.]\r\n\r\nUNDUE influence being thus (I wish the depravity of mankind would\r\npermit me to say, effectually) guarded against, the election is to be\r\nproceeded to on the day appointed; the sheriff or other returning\r\nofficer first taking an oath against bribery, and for the due\r\nexecution of his office. The candidates likewise, if required, must\r\nswear to their qualification; and the electors in counties to theirs;\r\nand the electors both in counties and boroughs are also compellable to\r\ntake the oath of abjuration and that against bribery and corruption.\r\nAnd it might not be amiss, if the members elected were bound to take\r\nthe latter oath, as well as the former; which in all probability\r\nwould be much more effectual, than administring it only to the\r\nelectors.\r\n\r\nTHE election being closed, the returning officer in boroughs returns\r\nhis precept to the sheriff, with the persons elected by the majority:\r\nand the sheriff returns the whole, together with the writ for the\r\ncounty and the knights elected thereupon, to the clerk of the crown in\r\nchancery; before the day of meeting, if it be a new parliament, or\r\nwithin fourteen days after the election, if it be an occasional\r\nvacancy; and this under penalty of 500_l_. If the sheriff does not\r\nreturn such knights only as are duly elected, he forfeits, by the old\r\nstatutes of Henry VI, 100_l_; and the returning officer in boroughs\r\nfor a like false return 40_l_; and they are besides liable to an\r\naction, in which double damages shall be recovered, by the later\r\nstatutes of king William: and any person bribing the returning officer\r\nshall alio forfeit 300_l_. But the members returned by him are the\r\nsitting members, until the house of commons, upon petition, shall\r\nadjudge the return to be false and illegal. And this abstract of the\r\nproceedings at elections of knights, citizens, and burgesses,\r\nconcludes our enquiries into the laws and customs more peculiarly\r\nrelative to the house of commons.\r\n\r\nVI. I PROCEED now, sixthly, to the method of making laws; which is\r\nmuch the same in both houses: and I shall touch it very briefly,\r\nbeginning in the house of commons. But first I must premise, that for\r\ndispatch of business each house of parliament has it's speaker. The\r\nspeaker of the house of lords is the lord chancellor, or keeper of the\r\nking's great seal; whose office it is to preside there, and manage the\r\nformality of business. The speaker of the house of commons is chosen\r\nby the house; but must be approved by the king. And herein the usage\r\nof the two houses differs, that the speaker of the house of commons\r\ncannot give his opinion or argue any question in the house; but the\r\nspeaker of the house of lords may. In each house the act of the\r\nmajority binds the whole; and this majority is declared by votes\r\nopenly and publickly given: not as at Venice, and many other\r\nsenatorial assemblies, privately or by ballot. This latter method may\r\nbe serviceable, to prevent intrigues and unconstitutional\r\ncombinations: but is impossible to be practiced with us; at least in\r\nthe house of commons, where every member's conduct is subject to the\r\nfuture censure of his constituents, and therefore should be openly\r\nsubmitted to their inspection.\r\n\r\nTO bring a bill into the house, if the relief sought by it is of a\r\nprivate nature, it is first necessary to prefer a petition; which must\r\nbe presented by a member, and usually sets forth the grievance desired\r\nto be remedied. This petition (when founded on facts that may be in\r\ntheir nature disputed) is referred to a committee of members, who\r\nexamine the matter alleged, and accordingly report it to the house;\r\nand then (or, otherwise, upon the mere petition) leave is given to\r\nbring in the bill. In public matters the bill is brought in upon\r\nmotion made to the house, without any petition at all. Formerly, all\r\nbills were drawn in the form of petitions, which were entered upon the\r\n_parliament rolls_, with the king's answer thereunto subjoined; not in\r\nany settled form of words, but as the circumstances of the case\r\nrequired[n]: and at the end of each parliament the judges drew them\r\ninto the form of a statute, which was entered on the _statute-rolls_.\r\nIn the reign of Henry V, to prevent mistakes and abuses, the statutes\r\nwere drawn up by the judges before the end of the parliament; and, in\r\nthe reign of Henry VI, bills in the form of acts, according to the\r\nmodern custom, were first introduced.\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: See, among numberless other instances, the _articuli\r\ncleri_, 9 Edw. II.]\r\n\r\nTHE persons, directed to bring in the bill, present it in a competent\r\ntime to the house, drawn out on paper, with a multitude of blanks, or\r\nvoid spaces, where any thing occurs that is dubious, or necessary to\r\nbe settled by the parliament itself; (such, especially, as the precise\r\ndate of times, the nature and quantity of penalties, or of any sums of\r\nmoney to be raised) being indeed only the sceleton of the bill. In the\r\nhouse of lords, if the bill begins there, it is (when of a private\r\nnature) perused by two of the judges, who settle all points of legal\r\npropriety. This is read a first time, and at a convenient distance a\r\nsecond time; and after each reading the speaker opens to the house the\r\nsubstance of the bill, and puts the question, whether it shall proceed\r\nany farther. The introduction of the bill may be originally opposed,\r\nas the bill itself may at either of the readings; and, if the\r\nopposition succeeds, the bill must be dropt for that sessions; as it\r\nmust also, if opposed with success in any of the subsequent stages.\r\n\r\nAFTER the second reading it is committed, that is, referred to a\r\ncommittee; which is either selected by the house in matters of small\r\nimportance, or else, upon a bill of consequence, the house resolves\r\nitself into a committee of the whole house. A committee of the whole\r\nhouse is composed of every member; and, to form it, the speaker quits\r\nthe chair, (another member being appointed chairman) and may sit and\r\ndebate as a private member. In these committees the bill is debated\r\nclause by clause, amendments made, the blanks filled up, and sometimes\r\nthe bill entirely new modelled. After it has gone through the\r\ncommittee, the chairman reports it to the house with such amendments\r\nas the committee have made; and then the house reconsider the whole\r\nbill again, and the question is repeatedly put upon every clause and\r\namendment. When the house have agreed or disagreed to the amendments\r\nof the committee, and sometimes added new amendments of their own, the\r\nbill is then ordered to be engrossed, or written in a strong gross\r\nhand, on one or more long rolls of parchment sewed together. When this\r\nis finished, it is read a third time, and amendments are sometimes\r\nthen made to it; and, if a new clause be added, it is done by tacking\r\na separate piece of parchment on the bill, which is called a ryder.\r\nThe speaker then again opens the contents; and, holding it up in his\r\nhands, puts the question, whether the bill shall pass. If this is\r\nagreed to, one of the members is directed to carry it to the lords,\r\nand desire their concurrence; who, attended by several more, carries\r\nit to the bar of the house of peers, and there delivers it to their\r\nspeaker, who comes down from his woolsack to receive it.\r\n\r\nIT there passes through the same forms as in the other house, (except\r\nengrossing, which is already done) and, if rejected, no more notice is\r\ntaken, but it passes _sub silentio_, to prevent unbecoming\r\naltercations. But if it is agreed to, the lords send a message by two\r\nmasters in chancery (or sometimes two of the judges) that they have\r\nagreed to the same: and the bill remains with the lords, if they have\r\nmade no amendment to it. But if any amendments are made, such\r\namendments are sent down with the bill to receive the concurrence of\r\nthe commons. If the commons disagree to the amendments, a conference\r\nusually follows between members deputed from each house; who for the\r\nmost part settle and adjust the difference: but, if both houses remain\r\ninflexible, the bill is dropped. If the commons agree to the\r\namendments, the bill is sent back to the lords by one of the members,\r\nwith a message to acquaint them therewith. The same forms are\r\nobserved, _mutatis mutandis_, when the bill begins in the house of\r\nlords. And when both houses have done with the bill, it always is\r\ndeposited in the house of peers, to wait the royal assent.\r\n\r\nTHIS may be given two ways: 1. In person; when the king comes to the\r\nhouse of peers, in his crown and royal robes, and sending for the\r\ncommons to the bar, the titles of all the bills that have passed both\r\nhouses are read; and the king's answer is declared by the clerk of the\r\nparliament in Norman-French: a badge, it must be owned, (now the only\r\none remaining) of conquest; and which one could wish to see fall into\r\ntotal oblivion; unless it be reserved as a solemn memento to remind us\r\nthat our liberties are mortal, having once been destroyed by a foreign\r\nforce. If the king consents to a public bill, the clerk usually\r\ndeclares, \"_le roy le veut_, the king wills it so to be;\" if to a\r\nprivate bill, \"_soit fait come il est desirè_, be it as it is\r\ndesired.\" If the king refuses his assent, it is in the gentle language\r\nof \"_le roy s'avisera_, the king will advise upon it.\" 2. By statute\r\n33 Hen. VIII. c. 21. the king may give his assent by letters patent\r\nunder his great seal, signed with his hand, and notified, in his\r\nabsence, to both houses assembled together in the high house. And,\r\nwhen the bill has received the royal assent in either of these ways,\r\nit is then, and not before, a statute or act of parliament.\r\n\r\nTHIS statute or act is placed among the records of the kingdom; there\r\nneeding no formal promulgation to give it the force of a law, as was\r\nnecessary by the civil law with regard to the emperors edicts: because\r\nevery man in England is, in judgment of law, party to the making of an\r\nact of parliament, being present thereat by his representatives.\r\nHowever, a copy thereof is usually printed at the king's press, for\r\nthe information of the whole land. And formerly, before the invention\r\nof printing, it was used to be published by the sheriff of every\r\ncounty; the king's writ being sent to him at the end of every session,\r\ntogether with a transcript of all the acts made at that session,\r\ncommanding him \"_ut statuta illa, et omnes articulos in eisdem\r\ncontentos, in singulis locis ubi expedire viderit, publice proclamari,\r\net firmiter teneri et observari faciat_.\" And the usage was to\r\nproclaim them at his county court, and there to keep them, that\r\nwhoever would might read or take copies thereof; which custom\r\ncontinued till the reign of Henry the seventh[o].\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: 3 Inst. 41. 4 Inst. 26.]\r\n\r\nAN act of parliament, thus made, is the exercise of the highest\r\nauthority that this kingdom acknowleges upon earth. It hath power to\r\nbind every subject in the land, and the dominions thereunto belonging;\r\nnay, even the king himself, if particularly named therein. And it\r\ncannot be altered, amended, dispensed with, suspended, or repealed,\r\nbut in the same forms and by the same authority of parliament: for it\r\nis a maxim in law, that it requires the same strength to dissolve, as\r\nto create an obligation. It is true it was formerly held, that the\r\nking might in many cases dispense with penal statutes[p]: but now by\r\nstatute 1 W. & M. st. 2. c. 2. it is declared, that the suspending or\r\ndispensing with laws by regal authority, without consent of\r\nparliament, is illegal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: Finch. L. 81. 234.]\r\n\r\nVII. THERE remains only, in the seventh and last place, to add a word\r\nor two concerning the manner in which parliaments may be adjourned,\r\nprorogued, or dissolved.\r\n\r\nAN adjournment is no more than a continuance of the session from one\r\nday to another, as the word itself signifies: and this is done by the\r\nauthority of each house separately every day; and sometimes for a\r\nfortnight or a month together, as at Christmas or Easter, or upon\r\nother particular occasions. But the adjournment of one house is no\r\nadjournment of the other[q]. It hath also been usual, when his majesty\r\nhath signified his pleasure that both or either of the houses should\r\nadjourn themselves to a certain day, to obey the king's pleasure so\r\nsignified, and to adjourn accordingly[r]. Otherwise, besides the\r\nindecorum of a refusal, a prorogation would assuredly follow; which\r\nwould often be very inconvenient to both public and private business.\r\nFor prorogation puts an end to the session; and then such bills, as\r\nare only begun and not perfected, must be resumed _de novo_ (if at\r\nall) in a subsequent session: whereas, after an adjournment, all\r\nthings continue in the same state as at the time of the adjournment\r\nmade, and may be proceeded on without any fresh commencement.\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: 4 Inst. 28.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Com. Journ. _passim_: _e.g._ 11 Jun. 1572. 5 Apr. 1604. 4\r\nJun. 14 Nov. 18 Dec. 1621. 11 Jul. 1625. 13 Sept. 1660. 25 Jul. 1667.\r\n4 Aug. 1685. 24 Febr. 1691. 21 Jun. 1712. 16 Apr. 1717. 3 Feb. 1741.\r\n10 Dec. 1745.]\r\n\r\nA PROROGATION is the continuance of the parliament from one session to\r\nanother, as an adjournment is a continuation of the session from day\r\nto day. This is done by the royal authority, expressed either by the\r\nlord chancellor in his majesty's presence, or by commission from the\r\ncrown, or frequently by proclamation. Both houses are necessarily\r\nprorogued at the same time; it not being a prorogation of the house of\r\nlords, or commons, but of the parliament. The session is never\r\nunderstood to be at an end, until a prorogation: though, unless some\r\nact be passed or some judgment given in parliament, it is in truth no\r\nsession at all[s]. And formerly the usage was, for the king to give\r\nthe royal assent to all such bills as he approved, at the end of every\r\nsession, and then to prorogue the parliament; though sometimes only\r\nfor a day or two[t]: after which all business then depending in the\r\nhouses was to be begun again. Which custom obtained so strongly, that\r\nit once became a question[u], whether giving the royal assent to a\r\nsingle bill did not of course put an end to the session. And, though\r\nit was then resolved in the negative, yet the notion was so deeply\r\nrooted, that the statute 1 Car. I. c. 7. was passed to declare, that\r\nthe king's assent to that and some other acts should not put an end to\r\nthe session; and, even so late as the restoration of Charles II, we\r\nfind a proviso tacked to the first bill then enacted[w] that his\r\nmajesty's assent thereto should not determine the session of\r\nparliament. But it now seems to be allowed, that a prorogation must be\r\nexpressly made, in order to determine the session. And, if at the time\r\nof an actual rebellion, or imminent danger of invasion, the parliament\r\nshall be separated by adjournment or prorogation, the king is\r\nempowered[x] to call them together by proclamation, with fourteen days\r\nnotice of the time appointed for their reassembling.\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: 4 Inst. 28. Hale of parl. 38.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: Com. Journ. 21 Oct. 1553.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: _Ibid._ 21 Nov. 1554.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: Stat. 12 Car. II. c. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: Stat. 30 Geo. II. c. 25.]\r\n\r\nA DISSOLUTION is the civil death of the parliament; and this may be\r\neffected three ways: 1. By the king's will, expressed either in person\r\nor by representation. For, as the king has the sole right of convening\r\nthe parliament, so also it is a branch of the royal prerogative, that\r\nhe may (whenever he pleases) prorogue the parliament for a time, or\r\nput a final period to it's existence. If nothing had a right to\r\nprorogue or dissolve a parliament but itself, it might happen to\r\nbecome perpetual. And this would be extremely dangerous, if at any\r\ntime it should attempt to encroach upon the executive power: as was\r\nfatally experienced by the unfortunate king Charles the first; who,\r\nhaving unadvisedly passed an act to continue the parliament then in\r\nbeing till such time as it should please to dissolve itself, at last\r\nfell a sacrifice to that inordinate power, which he himself had\r\nconsented to give them. It is therefore extremely necessary that the\r\ncrown should be empowered to regulate the duration of these\r\nassemblies, under the limitations which the English constitution has\r\nprescribed: so that, on the one hand, they may frequently and\r\nregularly come together, for the dispatch of business and redress of\r\ngrievances; and may not, on the other, even with the consent of the\r\ncrown, be continued to an inconvenient or unconstitutional length.\r\n\r\n2. A PARLIAMENT may be dissolved by the demise of the crown. This\r\ndissolution formerly happened immediately upon the death of the\r\nreigning sovereign, for he being considered in law as the head of the\r\nparliament, (_caput, principium, et finis_) that failing, the whole\r\nbody was held to be extinct. But, the calling a new parliament\r\nimmediately on the inauguration of the successor being found\r\ninconvenient, and dangers being apprehended from having no parliament\r\nin being in case of a disputed succession, it was enacted by the\r\nstatutes 7 & 8 W. III. c. 15. and 6 Ann. c. 7. that the parliament in\r\nbeing shall continue for six months after the death of any king or\r\nqueen, unless sooner prorogued or dissolved by the successor: that, if\r\nthe parliament be, at the time of the king's death, separated by\r\nadjournment or prorogation, it shall notwithstanding assemble\r\nimmediately: and that, if no parliament is then in being, the members\r\nof the last parliament shall assemble, and be again a parliament.\r\n\r\n3. LASTLY, a parliament may be dissolved or expire by length of time.\r\nFor if either the legislative body were perpetual; or might last for\r\nthe life of the prince who convened them, as formerly; and were so to\r\nbe supplied, by occasionally filling the vacancies with new\r\nrepresentatives; in these cases, if it were once corrupted, the evil\r\nwould be past all remedy: but when different bodies succeed each\r\nother, if the people see cause to disapprove of the present, they may\r\nrectify it's faults in the next. A legislative assembly also, which is\r\nsure to be separated again, (whereby it's members will themselves\r\nbecome private men, and subject to the full extent of the laws which\r\nthey have enacted for others) will think themselves bound, in interest\r\nas well as duty, to make only such laws as are good. The utmost extent\r\nof time that the same parliament was allowed to sit, by the statute 6\r\nW. & M. c. 2. was _three_ years; after the expiration of which,\r\nreckoning from the return of the first summons, the parliament was to\r\nhave no longer continuance. But by the statute 1 Geo. I. st. 2. c. 38.\r\n(in order, professedly, to prevent the great and continued expenses of\r\nfrequent elections, and the violent heats and animosities consequent\r\nthereupon, and for the peace and security of the government then just\r\nrecovering from the late rebellion) this term was prolonged to _seven_\r\nyears; and, what alone is an instance of the vast authority of\r\nparliament, the very same house, that was chosen for three years,\r\nenacted it's own continuance for seven. So that, as our constitution\r\nnow stands, the parliament must expire, or die a natural death, at the\r\nend of every seventh year; if not sooner dissolved by the royal\r\nprerogative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRD.\r\n\r\nOF THE KING, AND HIS TITLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE supreme executive power of these kingdoms is vested by our laws in\r\na single person, the king or queen: for it matters not to which sex\r\nthe crown descends; but the person entitled to it, whether male or\r\nfemale, is immediately invested with all the ensigns, rights, and\r\nprerogatives of sovereign power; as is declared by statute 1 Mar. st.\r\n3. c. 1.\r\n\r\nIN discoursing of the royal rights and authority, I shall consider the\r\nking under six distinct views: 1. With regard to his title. 2. His\r\nroyal family. 3. His councils. 4. His duties. 5. His prerogative. 6.\r\nHis revenue. And, first, with regard to his title.\r\n\r\nTHE executive power of the English nation being vested in a single\r\nperson, by the general consent of the people, the evidence of which\r\ngeneral consent is long and immemorial usage, it became necessary to\r\nthe freedom and peace of the state, that a rule should be laid down,\r\nuniform, universal, and permanent; in order to mark out with\r\nprecision, _who_ is that single person, to whom are committed (in\r\nsubservience to the law of the land) the care and protection of the\r\ncommunity; and to whom, in return, the duty and allegiance of every\r\nindividual are due. It is of the highest importance to the public\r\ntranquillity, and to the consciences of private men, that this rule\r\nshould be clear and indisputable: and our constitution has not left us\r\nin the dark upon this material occasion. It will therefore be the\r\nendeavour of this chapter to trace out the constitutional doctrine of\r\nthe royal succession, with that freedom and regard to truth, yet mixed\r\nwith that reverence and respect, which the principles of liberty and\r\nthe dignity of the subject require.\r\n\r\nTHE grand fundamental maxim upon which the _jus coronae_, or right of\r\nsuccession to the throne of these kingdoms, depends, I take to be\r\nthis: \"that the crown is, by common law and constitutional custom,\r\nhereditary; and this in a manner peculiar to itself: but that the\r\nright of inheritance may from time to time be changed or limited by\r\nact of parliament; under which limitations the crown still continues\r\nhereditary.\" And this proposition it will be the business of this\r\nchapter to prove, in all it's branches: first, that the crown is\r\nhereditary; secondly, that it is hereditary in a manner peculiar to\r\nitself; thirdly, that this inheritance is subject to limitation by\r\nparliament; lastly, that when it is so limited, it is hereditary in\r\nthe new proprietor.\r\n\r\n1. FIRST, it is in general _hereditary_, or descendible to the next\r\nheir, on the death or demise of the last proprietor. All regal\r\ngovernments must be either hereditary or elective: and, as I believe\r\nthere is no instance wherein the crown of England has ever been\r\nasserted to be elective, except by the regicides at the infamous and\r\nunparalleled trial of king Charles I, it must of consequence be\r\nhereditary. Yet while I assert an hereditary, I by no means intend a\r\n_jure divino_, title to the throne. Such a title may be allowed to\r\nhave subsisted under the theocratic establishments of the children of\r\nIsrael in Palestine: but it never yet subsisted in any other country;\r\nsave only so far as kingdoms, like other human fabrics, are subject to\r\nthe general and ordinary dispensations of providence. Nor indeed have\r\na _jure divino_ and an _hereditary_ right any necessary connexion with\r\neach other; as some have very weakly imagined. The titles of David and\r\nJehu were equally _jure divino_, as those of either Solomon or Ahab;\r\nand yet David slew the sons of his predecessor, and Jehu his\r\npredecessor himself. And when our kings have the same warrant as they\r\nhad, whether it be to sit upon the throne of their fathers, or to\r\ndestroy the house of the preceding sovereign, they will then, and not\r\nbefore, possess the crown of England by a right like theirs,\r\n_immediately_ derived from heaven. The hereditary right, which the\r\nlaws of England acknowlege, owes it's origin to the founders of our\r\nconstitution, and to them only. It has no relation to, nor depends\r\nupon, the civil laws of the Jews, the Greeks, the Romans, or any other\r\nnation upon earth: the municipal laws of one society having no\r\nconnexion with, or influence upon, the fundamental polity of another.\r\nThe founders of our English monarchy might perhaps, if they had\r\nthought proper, have made it an elective monarchy: but they rather\r\nchose, and upon good reason, to establish originally a succession by\r\ninheritance. This has been acquiesced in by general consent; and\r\nripened by degrees into common law: the very same title that every\r\nprivate man has to his own estate. Lands are not naturally descendible\r\nany more than thrones: but the law has thought proper, for the benefit\r\nand peace of the public, to establish hereditary succession in one as\r\nwell as the other.\r\n\r\nIT must be owned, an elective monarchy seems to be the most obvious,\r\nand best suited of any to the rational principles of government, and\r\nthe freedom of human nature: and accordingly we find from history\r\nthat, in the infancy and first rudiments of almost every state, the\r\nleader, chief magistrate, or prince, hath usually been elective. And,\r\nif the individuals who compose that state could always continue true\r\nto first principles, uninfluenced by passion or prejudice, unassailed\r\nby corruption, and unawed by violence, elective succession were as\r\nmuch to be desired in a kingdom, as in other inferior communities. The\r\nbest, the wisest, and the bravest man would then be sure of receiving\r\nthat crown, which his endowments have merited; and the sense of an\r\nunbiassed majority would be dutifully acquiesced in by the few who\r\nwere of different opinions. But history and observation will inform\r\nus, that elections of every kind (in the present state of human\r\nnature) are too frequently brought about by influence, partiality, and\r\nartifice: and, even where the case is otherwise, these practices will\r\nbe often suspected, and as constantly charged upon the successful, by\r\na splenetic disappointed minority. This is an evil, to which all\r\nsocieties are liable; as well those of a private and domestic kind, as\r\nthe great community of the public, which regulates and includes the\r\nrest. But in the former there is this advantage; that such suspicions,\r\nif false, proceed no farther than jealousies and murmurs, which time\r\nwill effectually suppress; and, if true, the injustice may be remedied\r\nby legal means, by an appeal to those tribunals to which every member\r\nof society has (by becoming such) virtually engaged to submit.\r\nWhereas, in the great and independent society, which every nation\r\ncomposes, there is no superior to resort to but the law of nature; no\r\nmethod to redress the infringements of that law, but the actual\r\nexertion of private force. As therefore between two nations,\r\ncomplaining of mutual injuries, the quarrel can only be decided by the\r\nlaw of arms; so in one and the same nation, when the fundamental\r\nprinciples of their common union are supposed to be invaded, and more\r\nespecially when the appointment of their chief magistrate is alleged\r\nto be unduly made, the only tribunal to which the complainants can\r\nappeal is that of the God of battels, the only process by which the\r\nappeal can be carried on is that of a civil and intestine war. An\r\nhereditary succession to the crown is therefore now established, in\r\nthis and most other countries, in order to prevent that periodical\r\nbloodshed and misery, which the history of antient imperial Rome, and\r\nthe more modern experience of Poland and Germany, may shew us are the\r\nconsequences of elective kingdoms.\r\n\r\n2. BUT, secondly, as to the particular mode of inheritance, it in\r\ngeneral corresponds with the feodal path of descents, chalked out by\r\nthe common law in the succession to landed estates; yet with one or\r\ntwo material exceptions. Like them, the crown will descend lineally\r\nto the issue of the reigning monarch; as it did from king John to\r\nRichard II, through a regular pedigree of six lineal descents. As in\r\nthem, the preference of males to females, and the right of\r\nprimogeniture among the males, are strictly adhered to. Thus Edward V\r\nsucceeded to the crown, in preference to Richard his younger brother\r\nand Elizabeth his elder sister. Like them, on failure of the male\r\nline, it descends to the issue female; according to the antient\r\nBritish custom remarked by Tacitus[a], \"_solent foeminarum ductu\r\nbellare, et sexum in imperiis non discernere_.\" Thus Mary I succeeded\r\nto Edward VI; and the line of Margaret queen of Scots, the daughter of\r\nHenry VII, succeeded on failure of the line of Henry VIII, his son.\r\nBut, among the females, the crown descends by right of primogeniture\r\nto the eldest daughter only and her issue; and not, as in common\r\ninheritances, to all the daughters at once; the evident necessity of a\r\nsole succession to the throne having occasioned the royal law of\r\ndescents to depart from the common law in this respect: and therefore\r\nqueen Mary on the death of her brother succeeded to the crown alone,\r\nand not in partnership with her sister Elizabeth. Again: the doctrine\r\nof representation prevails in the descent of the crown, as it does in\r\nother inheritances; whereby the lineal descendants of any person\r\ndeceased stand in the same place as their ancestor, if living, would\r\nhave done. Thus Richard II succeeded his grandfather Edward III, in\r\nright of his father the black prince; to the exclusion of all his\r\nuncles, his grandfather's younger children. Lastly, on failure of\r\nlineal descendants, the crown goes to the next collateral relations of\r\nthe late king; provided they are lineally descended from the blood\r\nroyal, that is, from that royal stock which originally acquired the\r\ncrown. Thus Henry I succeeded to William II, John to Richard I, and\r\nJames I to Elizabeth; being all derived from the conqueror, who was\r\nthen the only regal stock. But herein there is no objection (as in the\r\ncase of common descents) to the succession of a brother, an uncle, or\r\nother collateral relation, of the _half_ blood; that is, where the\r\nrelationship proceeds not from the same _couple_ of ancestors (which\r\nconstitutes a kinsman of the _whole_ blood) but from a _single_\r\nancestor only; as when two persons are derived from the same father,\r\nand not from the same mother, or _vice versa_: provided only, that the\r\none ancestor, from whom both are descended, be he from whose veins the\r\nblood royal is communicated to each. Thus Mary I inherited to Edward\r\nVI, and Elizabeth inherited to Mary; all born of the same father, king\r\nHenry VIII, but all by different mothers. The reason of which\r\ndiversity, between royal and common descents, will be better\r\nunderstood hereafter, when we examine the nature of inheritances in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: _in vit. Agricolae._]\r\n\r\n3. THE doctrine of _hereditary_ right does by no means imply an\r\n_indefeasible_ right to the throne. No man will, I think, assert this,\r\nthat has considered our laws, constitution, and history, without\r\nprejudice, and with any degree of attention. It is unquestionably in\r\nthe breast of the supreme legislative authority of this kingdom, the\r\nking and both houses of parliament, to defeat this hereditary right;\r\nand, by particular entails, limitations, and provisions, to exclude\r\nthe immediate heir, and vest the inheritance in any one else. This is\r\nstrictly consonant to our laws and constitution; as may be gathered\r\nfrom the expression so frequently used in our statute book, of \"the\r\nking's majesty, his heirs, and successors.\" In which we may observe,\r\nthat as the word, \"heirs,\" necessarily implies an inheritance or\r\nhereditary right, generally subsisting in the royal person; so the\r\nword, \"successors,\" distinctly taken, must imply that this inheritance\r\nmay sometimes be broke through; or, that there may be a successor,\r\nwithout being the heir, of the king. And this is so extremely\r\nreasonable, that without such a power, lodged somewhere, our polity\r\nwould be very defective. For, let us barely suppose so melancholy a\r\ncase, as that the heir apparent should be a lunatic, an ideot, or\r\notherwise incapable of reigning: how miserable would the condition of\r\nthe nation be, if he were also incapable of being set aside!--It is\r\ntherefore necessary that this power should be lodged somewhere: and\r\nyet the inheritance, and regal dignity, would be very precarious\r\nindeed, if this power were _expressly_ and _avowedly_ lodged in the\r\nhands of the subject only, to be exerted whenever prejudice, caprice,\r\nor discontent should happen to take the lead. Consequently it can no\r\nwhere be so properly lodged as in the two houses of parliament, by and\r\nwith the consent of the reigning king; who, it is not to be supposed,\r\nwill agree to any thing improperly prejudicial to the rights of his\r\nown descendants. And therefore in the king, lords, and commons, in\r\nparliament assembled, our laws have expressly lodged it.\r\n\r\n4. BUT, fourthly; however the crown maybe limited or transferred, it\r\nstill retains it's descendible quality, and becomes hereditary in the\r\nwearer of it: and hence in our law the king is said never to die, in\r\nhis political capacity; though, in common with other men, he is\r\nsubject to mortality in his natural: because immediately upon the\r\nnatural death of Henry, William, or Edward, the king survives in his\r\nsuccessor; and the right of the crown vests, _eo instanti_, upon his\r\nheir; either the _haeres natus_, if the course of descent remains\r\nunimpeached, or the _haeres factus_, if the inheritance be under any\r\nparticular settlement. So that there can be no _interregnum_; but as\r\nsir Matthew Hale[b] observes, the right of sovereignty is fully\r\ninvested in the successor by the very descent of the crown. And\r\ntherefore, however acquired, it becomes in him absolutely hereditary,\r\nunless by the rules of the limitation it is otherwise ordered and\r\ndetermined. In the same manner as landed estates, to continue our\r\nformer comparison, are by the law hereditary, or descendible to the\r\nheirs of the owner; but still there exists a power, by which the\r\nproperty of those lands may be transferred to another person. If this\r\ntransfer be made simply and absolutely, the lands will be hereditary\r\nin the new owner, and descend to his heirs at law: but if the transfer\r\nbe clogged with any limitations, conditions, or entails, the lands\r\nmust descend in that chanel, so limited and prescribed, and no other.\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: 1 Hist. P.C. 61.]\r\n\r\nIN these four points consists, as I take it, the constitutional notion\r\nof hereditary right to the throne: which will be still farther\r\nelucidated, and made clear beyond all dispute, from a short historical\r\nview of the successions to the crown of England, the doctrines of our\r\nantient lawyers, and the several acts of parliament that have from\r\ntime to time been made, to create, to declare, to confirm, to limit,\r\nor to bar, the hereditary title to the throne. And in the pursuit of\r\nthis enquiry we shall find, that from the days of Egbert, the first\r\nsole monarch of this kingdom, even to the present, the four cardinal\r\nmaxims above mentioned have ever been held the constitutional canons\r\nof succession. It is true, this succession, through fraud, or force,\r\nor sometimes through necessity, when in hostile times the crown\r\ndescended on a minor or the like, has been very frequently suspended;\r\nbut has always at last returned back into the old hereditary chanel,\r\nthough sometimes a very considerable period has intervened. And, even\r\nin those instances where the succession has been violated, the crown\r\nhas ever been looked upon as hereditary in the wearer of it. Of which\r\nthe usurpers themselves were so sensible, that they for the most part\r\nendeavoured to vamp up some feeble shew of a title by descent, in\r\norder to amuse the people, while they gained the possession of the\r\nkingdom. And, when possession was once gained, they considered it as\r\nthe purchase or acquisition of a new estate of inheritance, and\r\ntransmitted or endeavoured to transmit it to their own posterity, by a\r\nkind of hereditary right of usurpation.\r\n\r\nKING Egbert about the year 800, found himself in possession of the\r\nthrone of the west Saxons, by a long and undisturbed descent from his\r\nancestors of above three hundred years. How his ancestors acquired\r\ntheir title, whether by force, by fraud, by contract, or by election,\r\nit matters not much to enquire; and is indeed a point of such high\r\nantiquity, as must render all enquiries at best but plausible guesses.\r\nHis right must be supposed indisputably good, because we know no\r\nbetter. The other kingdoms of the heptarchy he acquired, some by\r\nconsent, but most by a voluntary submission. And it is an established\r\nmaxim in civil polity, and the law of nations, that when one country\r\nis united to another in such a manner, as that one keeps it's\r\ngovernment and states, and the other loses them; the latter entirely\r\nassimilates or is melted down in the former, and must adopt it's laws\r\nand customs[c]. And in pursuance of this maxim there hath ever been,\r\nsince the union of the heptarchy in king Egbert, a general\r\nacquiescence under the hereditary monarchy of the west Saxons, through\r\nall the united kingdoms.\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Puff. L. of N. and N. b. 8. c. 12. §. 6.]\r\n\r\nFROM Egbert to the death of Edmund Ironside, a period of above two\r\nhundred years, the crown descended regularly, through a succession of\r\nfifteen princes, without any deviation or interruption; save only that\r\nking Edred, the uncle of Edwy, mounted the throne for about nine\r\nyears, in the right of his nephew a minor, the times being very\r\ntroublesome and dangerous. But this was with a view to preserve, and\r\nnot to destroy, the succession; and accordingly Edwy succeeded him.\r\n\r\nKING Edmund Ironside was obliged, by the hostile irruption of the\r\nDanes, at first to divide his kingdom with Canute, king of Denmark;\r\nand Canute, after his death, seised the whole of it, Edmund's sons\r\nbeing driven into foreign countries. Here the succession was suspended\r\nby actual force, and a new family introduced upon the throne: in whom\r\nhowever this new acquired throne continued hereditary for three\r\nreigns; when, upon the death of Hardiknute, the antient Saxon line was\r\nrestored in the person of Edward the confessor.\r\n\r\nHE was not indeed the true heir to the crown, being the younger\r\nbrother of king Edmund Ironside, who had a son Edward, sirnamed (from\r\nhis exile) the outlaw, still living. But this son was then in Hungary;\r\nand, the English having just shaken off the Danish yoke, it was\r\nnecessary that somebody on the spot should mount the throne; and the\r\nconfessor was the next of the royal line then in England. On his\r\ndecease without issue, Harold II usurped the throne, and almost at the\r\nsame instant came on the Norman invasion: the right to the crown\r\nbeing all the time in Edgar, sirnamed Atheling, (which signifies in\r\nthe Saxon language the first of the blood royal) who was the son of\r\nEdward the outlaw, and grandson of Edmund Ironside; or, as Matthew\r\nParis[d] well expresses the sense of our old constitution, \"_Edmundus\r\nautem latusferreum, rex naturalis de stirpe regum, genuit Edwardum; et\r\nEdwardus genuit Edgarum, cui de jure debebatur regnum Anglorum_.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: _A.D._ 1066.]\r\n\r\nWILLIAM the Norman claimed the crown by virtue of a pretended grant\r\nfrom king Edward the confessor; a grant which, if real, was in itself\r\nutterly invalid: because it was made, as Harold well observed in his\r\nreply to William's demand[e], \"_absque generali senatus et populi\r\nconventu et edicto_;\" which also very plainly implies, that it then\r\nwas generally understood that the king, with consent of the general\r\ncouncil, might dispose of the crown and change the line of succession.\r\nWilliam's title however was altogether as good as Harold's, he being a\r\nmere private subject, and an utter stranger to the royal blood. Edgar\r\nAtheling's undoubted right was overwhelmed by the violence of the\r\ntimes; though frequently asserted by the English nobility after the\r\nconquest, till such time as he died without issue: but all their\r\nattempts proved unsuccessful, and only served the more firmly to\r\nestablish the crown in the family which had newly acquired it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: William of Malmsb. _l._ 3.]\r\n\r\nTHIS conquest then by William of Normandy was, like that of Canute\r\nbefore, a forcible transfer of the crown of England into a new family:\r\nbut, the crown being so transferred, all the inherent properties of\r\nthe crown were with it transferred also. For, the victory obtained at\r\nHastings not being[f] a victory over the nation collectively, but only\r\nover the person of Harold, the only right that the conqueror could\r\npretend to acquire thereby, was the right to possess the crown of\r\nEngland, not to alter the nature of the government. And therefore, as\r\nthe English laws still remained in force, he must necessarily take\r\nthe crown subject to those laws, and with all it's inherent\r\nproperties; the first and principal of which was it's descendibility.\r\nHere then we must drop our race of Saxon kings, at least for a while,\r\nand derive our descents from William the conqueror as from a new\r\nstock, who acquired by right of war (such as it is, yet still the\r\n_dernier resort_ of kings) a strong and undisputed title to the\r\ninheritable crown of England.\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Hale, Hist. C.L. c. 5. Seld. review of tithes, c. 8.]\r\n\r\nACCORDINGLY it descended from him to his sons William II and Henry I.\r\nRobert, it must be owned, his eldest son, was kept out of possession\r\nby the arts and violence of his brethren; who proceeded upon a notion,\r\nwhich prevailed for some time in the law of descents, that when the\r\neldest son was already provided for (as Robert was constituted duke of\r\nNormandy by his father's will) in such a case the next brother was\r\nentitled to enjoy the rest of their father's inheritance. But, as he\r\ndied without issue, Henry at last had a good title to the throne,\r\nwhatever he might have at first.\r\n\r\nSTEPHEN of Blois, who succeeded him, was indeed the grandson of the\r\nconqueror, by Adelicia his daughter, and claimed the throne by a\r\nfeeble kind of hereditary right; not as being the nearest of the male\r\nline, but as the nearest male of the blood royal. The real right was\r\nin the empress Matilda or Maud, the daughter of Henry I; the rule of\r\nsuccession being (where women are admitted at all) that the daughter\r\nof a son shall be preferred to the son of a daughter. So that Stephen\r\nwas little better than a mere usurper; and the empress Maud did not\r\nfail to assert her right by the sword: which dispute was attended with\r\nvarious success, and ended at last in a compromise, that Stephen\r\nshould keep the crown, but that Henry the son of Maud should succeed\r\nhim; as he afterwards accordingly did.\r\n\r\nHENRY, the second of that name, was the undoubted heir of William the\r\nconqueror; but he had also another connexion in blood, which endeared\r\nhim still farther to the English. He was lineally descended from\r\nEdmund Ironside, the last of the Saxon race of hereditary kings. For\r\nEdward the outlaw, the son of Edmund Ironside, had (besides Edgar\r\nAtheling, who died without issue) a daughter Margaret, who was married\r\nto Malcolm king of Scotland; and in her the Saxon hereditary right\r\nresided. By Malcolm she had several children, and among the rest\r\nMatilda the wife of Henry I, who by him had the empress Maud, the\r\nmother of Henry II. Upon which account the Saxon line is in our\r\nhistories frequently said to have been restored in his person: though\r\nin reality that right subsisted in the _sons_ of Malcolm by queen\r\nMargaret; king Henry's best title being as heir to the conqueror.\r\n\r\nFROM Henry II the crown descended to his eldest son Richard I, who\r\ndying childless, the right vested in his nephew Arthur, the son of\r\nGeoffrey his next brother; but John, the youngest son of king Henry,\r\nseised the throne; claiming, as appears from his charters, the crown\r\nby hereditary right[g]: that is to say, he was next of kin to the\r\ndeceased king, being his surviving brother; whereas Arthur was removed\r\none degree farther, being his brother's son, though by right of\r\nrepresentation he stood in the place of his father Geoffrey. And\r\nhowever flimzey this title, and those of William Rufus and Stephen of\r\nBlois, may appear at this distance to us, after the law of descents\r\nhath now been settled for so many centuries, they were sufficient to\r\npuzzle the understandings of our brave, but unlettered, ancestors. Nor\r\nindeed can we wonder at the number of partizans, who espoused the\r\npretensions of king John in particular; since even in the reign of his\r\nfather, king Henry II, it was a point undetermined[h], whether, even\r\nin common inheritances, the child of an elder brother should succeed\r\nto the land in right of representation, or the younger surviving\r\nbrother in right of proximity of blood. Nor is it to this day decided\r\nin the collateral succession to the fiefs of the empire, whether the\r\norder of the stocks, or the proximity of degree shall take place[i].\r\nHowever, on the death of Arthur and his sister Eleanor without issue,\r\na clear and indisputable title vested in Henry III the son of John:\r\nand from him to Richard the second, a succession of six generations,\r\nthe crown descended in the true hereditary line. Under one of which\r\nrace of princes[k], we find it declared in parliament, \"that the law\r\nof the crown of England is, and always hath been, that the children of\r\nthe king of England, whether born in England, or elsewhere, ought to\r\nbear the inheritance after the death of their ancestors. Which law,\r\nour sovereign lord the king, the prelates, earls, and barons, and\r\nother great men, together with all the commons, in parliament\r\nassembled, do approve and affirm for ever.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: \"_Regni Angliae; quod nobis jure competit haereditario._\"\r\nSpelm. _Hist. R. Joh. apud_ Wilkins. 354.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Glanv. _l._ 7. _c._ 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: Mod. Un. Hist. xxx. 512.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Stat. 25 Edw. III. st. 2.]\r\n\r\nUPON Richard the second's resignation of the crown, he having no\r\nchildren, the right resulted to the issue of his grandfather Edward\r\nIII. That king had many children, besides his eldest, Edward the black\r\nprince of Wales, the father of Richard II: but to avoid confusion I\r\nshall only mention three; William his second son, who died without\r\nissue; Lionel duke of Clarence, his third son; and John of Gant duke\r\nof Lancaster, his fourth. By the rules of succession therefore the\r\nposterity of Lionel duke of Clarence were entitled to the throne, upon\r\nthe resignation of king Richard; and had accordingly been declared by\r\nthe king, many years before, the presumptive heirs of the crown; which\r\ndeclaration was also confirmed in parliament[l]. But Henry duke of\r\nLancaster, the son of John of Gant, having then a large army in the\r\nkingdom, the pretence of raising which was to recover his patrimony\r\nfrom the king, and to redress the grievances of the subject, it was\r\nimpossible for any other title to be asserted with any safety; and he\r\nbecame king under the title of Henry IV. But, as sir Matthew Hale\r\nremarks[m], though the people unjustly assisted Henry IV in his\r\nusurpation of the crown, yet he was not admitted thereto, until he had\r\ndeclared that he claimed, not as a conqueror, (which he very much\r\ninclined to do[n]) but as a successor, descended by right line of the\r\nblood royal; as appears from the rolls of parliament in those times.\r\nAnd in order to this he set up a shew of two titles: the one upon the\r\npretence of being the first of the blood royal in the intire male\r\nline, whereas the duke of Clarence left only one daughter Philippa;\r\nfrom which female branch, by a marriage with Edmond Mortimer earl of\r\nMarch, the house of York descended: the other, by reviving an exploded\r\nrumour, first propagated by John of Gant, that Edmond earl of\r\nLancaster (to whom Henry's mother was heiress) was in reality the\r\nelder brother of king Edward I; though his parents, on account of his\r\npersonal deformity, had imposed him on the world for the younger: and\r\ntherefore Henry would be intitled to the crown, either as successor to\r\nRichard II, in case the intire male line was allowed a preference to\r\nthe female; or, even prior to that unfortunate prince, if the crown\r\ncould descend through a female, while an intire male line was\r\nexisting.\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: Sandford's geneal. hist. 246.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: Hist. C.L. c. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: Seld. tit. hon. 1. 3.]\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, as in Edward the third's time we find the parliament\r\napproving and affirming the right of the crown, as before stated, so\r\nin the reign of Henry IV they actually exerted their right of\r\nnew-settling the succession to the crown. And this was done by the\r\nstatute 7 Hen. IV. c. 2. whereby it is enacted, \"that the inheritance\r\nof the crown and realms of England and France, and all other the\r\nking's dominions, shall be _set and remain_[o] in the person of our\r\nsovereign lord the king, and in the heirs of his body issuing;\" and\r\nprince Henry is declared heir apparent to the crown, to hold to him\r\nand the heirs of his body issuing, with remainder to lord Thomas, lord\r\nJohn, and lord Humphry, the king's sons, and the heirs of their bodies\r\nrespectively. Which is indeed nothing more than the law would have\r\ndone before, provided Henry the fourth had been a rightful king. It\r\nhowever serves to shew that it was then generally understood, that the\r\nking and parliament had a right to new-model and regulate the\r\nsuccession to the crown. And we may observe, with what caution and\r\ndelicacy the parliament then avoided declaring any sentiment of\r\nHenry's original title. However sir Edward Coke more than once\r\nexpressly declares[p], that at the time of passing this act the right\r\nof the crown was in the descent from Philippa, daughter and heir of\r\nLionel duke of Clarence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: _soit mys et demoerge._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: 4 Inst. 37, 205.]\r\n\r\nNEVERTHELESS the crown descended regularly from Henry IV to his son\r\nand grandson Henry V and VI; in the latter of whose reigns the house\r\nof York asserted their dormant title; and, after imbruing the kingdom\r\nin blood and confusion for seven years together, at last established\r\nit in the person of Edward IV. At his accession to the throne, after a\r\nbreach of the succession that continued for three descents, and above\r\nthreescore years, the distinction of a king _de jure_, and a king _de\r\nfacto_ began to be first taken; in order to indemnify such as had\r\nsubmitted to the late establishment, and to provide for the peace of\r\nthe kingdom by confirming all honors conferred, and all acts done, by\r\nthose who were now called the usurpers, not tending to the disherison\r\nof the rightful heir. In statute 1 Edw. IV. c. 1. the three Henrys are\r\nstiled, \"late kings of England successively in dede, and not of\r\nryght.\" And, in all the charters which I have met with of king Edward,\r\nwherever he has occasion to speak of any of the line of Lancaster, he\r\ncalls them \"_nuper de facto, et non de jure, reges Angliae_.\"\r\n\r\nEDWARD IV left two sons and a daughter; the eldest of which sons, king\r\nEdward V, enjoyed the regal dignity for a very short time, and was\r\nthen deposed by Richard his unnatural uncle; who immediately usurped\r\nthe royal dignity, having previously insinuated to the populace a\r\nsuspicion of bastardy in the children of Edward IV, to make a shew of\r\nsome hereditary title: after which he is generally believed to have\r\nmurdered his two nephews; upon whose death the right of the crown\r\ndevolved to their sister Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nTHE tyrannical reign of king Richard III gave occasion to Henry earl\r\nof Richmond to assert his title to the crown. A title the most remote\r\nand unaccountable that was ever set up, and which nothing could have\r\ngiven success to, but the universal detestation of the then usurper\r\nRichard. For, besides that he claimed under a descent from John of\r\nGant, whose title was now exploded, the claim (such as it was) was\r\nthrough John earl of Somerset, a bastard son, begotten by John of Gant\r\nupon Catherine Swinford. It is true, that, by an act of parliament 20\r\nRic. II, this son was, with others, legitimated and made inheritable\r\nto all lands, offices, and dignities, as if he had been born in\r\nwedlock: but still, with an express reservation of the crown,\r\n\"_excepta dignitate regali_[q].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: 4 Inst. 36.]\r\n\r\nNOTWITHSTANDING all this, immediately after the battle of Bosworth\r\nfield, he assumed the regal dignity; the right of the crown then\r\nbeing, as sir Edward Coke expressly declares[r], in Elizabeth, eldest\r\ndaughter of Edward IV: and his possession was established by\r\nparliament, held the first year of his reign. In the act for which\r\npurpose, the parliament seems to have copied the caution of their\r\npredecessors in the reign of Henry IV; and therefore (as lord Bacon\r\nthe historian of this reign observes) carefully avoided any\r\nrecognition of Henry VII's right, which indeed was none at all; and\r\nthe king would not have it by way of new law or ordinance, whereby a\r\nright might seem to be created and conferred upon him; and therefore a\r\nmiddle way was rather chosen, by way (as the noble historian expresses\r\nit) of _establishment_, and that under covert and indifferent words,\r\n\"that the inheritance of the crown should _rest_, _remain_, and\r\n_abide_ in king Henry VII and the heirs of his body:\" thereby\r\nproviding for the future, and at the same time acknowleging his\r\npresent possession; but not determining either way, whether that\r\npossession was _de jure_ or _de facto_ merely. However he soon after\r\nmarried Elizabeth of York, the undoubted heiress of the conqueror, and\r\nthereby gained (as sir Edward Coke[s] declares) by much his best title\r\nto the crown. Whereupon the act made in his favour was so much\r\ndisregarded, that it never was printed in our statute books.\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: 4 Inst. 37.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nHENRY the eighth, the issue of this marriage, succeeded to the crown\r\nby clear indisputable hereditary right, and transmitted it to his\r\nthree children in successive order. But in his reign we at several\r\ntimes find the parliament busy in regulating the succession to the\r\nkingdom. And, first, by statute 25 Hen. VIII. c. 12. which recites the\r\nmischiefs, which have and may ensue by disputed titles, because no\r\nperfect and substantial provision hath been made by law concerning the\r\nsuccession; and then enacts, that the crown shall be entailed to his\r\nmajesty, and the sons or heirs males of his body; and in default of\r\nsuch sons to the lady Elizabeth (who is declared to be the king's\r\neldest issue female, in exclusion of the lady Mary, on account of her\r\nsupposed illegitimacy by the divorce of her mother queen Catherine)\r\nand to the lady Elizabeth's heirs of her body; and so on from issue\r\nfemale to issue female, and the heirs of their bodies, by course of\r\ninheritance according to their ages, _as the crown of England hath\r\nbeen accustomed and ought to go_, in case where there be heirs female\r\nof the same: and in default of issue female, then to the king's right\r\nheirs for ever. This single statute is an ample proof of all the four\r\npositions we at first set out with.\r\n\r\nBUT, upon the king's divorce from Ann Boleyn, this statute was, with\r\nregard to the settlement of the crown, repealed by statute 28 Hen.\r\nVIII. c. 7. wherein the lady Elizabeth is also, as well as the lady\r\nMary, bastardized, and the crown settled on the king's children by\r\nqueen Jane Seymour, and his future wives; and, in defect of such\r\nchildren, then with this remarkable remainder, to such persons as the\r\nking by letters patent, or last will and testament, should limit and\r\nappoint the same. A vast power; but, notwithstanding, as it was\r\nregularly vested in him by the supreme legislative authority, it was\r\ntherefore indisputably valid. But this power was never carried into\r\nexecution; for by statute 35 Hen. VIII. c. 1. the king's two daughters\r\nare legitimated again, and the crown is limited to prince Edward by\r\nname, after that to the lady Mary, and then to the lady Elizabeth, and\r\nthe heirs of their respective bodies; which succession took effect\r\naccordingly, being indeed no other than the usual course of the law,\r\nwith regard to the descent of the crown.\r\n\r\nBUT lest there should remain any doubt in the minds of the people,\r\nthrough this jumble of acts for limiting the succession, by statute 1\r\nMar. p. 2. c. 1. queen Mary's hereditary right to the throne is\r\nacknowleged and recognized in these words: \"the crown of these realms\r\nis most lawfully, justly, and rightly _descended_ and come to the\r\nqueen's highness that now is, being the very, true, and undoubted heir\r\nand inheritrix thereof.\" And again, upon the queen's marriage with\r\nPhilip of Spain, in the statute which settles the preliminaries of\r\nthat match[t], the hereditary right to the crown is thus asserted and\r\ndeclared: \"as touching the right of the queen's inheritance in the\r\nrealm and dominions of England, the children, whether male or female,\r\nshall succeed in them, according to the known laws, statutes, and\r\ncustoms of the same.\" Which determination of the parliament, that the\r\nsuccession _shall_ continue in the usual course, seems tacitly to\r\nimply a power of new-modelling and altering it, in case the\r\nlegislature had thought proper.\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: 1 Mar. p. 2. c. 2.]\r\n\r\nON queen Elizabeth's accession, her right is recognized in still\r\nstronger terms than her sister's; the parliament acknowleging[u],\r\n\"that the queen's highness is, and in very deed and of most mere right\r\nought to be, by the laws of God, and the laws and statutes of this\r\nrealm, our most lawful and rightful sovereign liege lady and queen;\r\nand that her highness is rightly, lineally, and lawfully descended and\r\ncome of the blood royal of this realm of England; in and to whose\r\nprincely person, and to the heirs of her body lawfully to be begotten,\r\nafter her, the imperial crown and dignity of this realm doth belong.\"\r\nAnd in the same reign, by statute 13 Eliz. c. 1. we find the right of\r\nparliament to direct the succession of the crown asserted in the most\r\nexplicit words. \"If any person shall hold, affirm, or maintain that\r\nthe common laws of this realm, not altered by parliament, ought not to\r\ndirect the right of the crown of England; or that the queen's majesty,\r\nwith and by the authority of parliament, is not able to make laws and\r\nstatutes of sufficient force and validity, to limit and bind the crown\r\nof this realm, and the descent, limitation, inheritance, and\r\ngovernment thereof;--such person, so holding, affirming, or\r\nmaintaining, shall during the life of the queen be guilty of high\r\ntreason; and after her decease shall be guilty of a misdemesnor, and\r\nforfeit his goods and chattels.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: Stat. 1 Eliz. c. 3.]\r\n\r\nON the death of queen Elizabeth, without issue, the line of Henry VIII\r\nbecame extinct. It therefore became necessary to recur to the other\r\nissue of Henry VII, by Elizabeth of York his queen: whose eldest\r\ndaughter Margaret having married James IV king of Scotland, king James\r\nthe sixth of Scotland, and of England the first, was the lineal\r\ndescendant from that alliance. So that in his person, as clearly as in\r\nHenry VIII, centered all the claims of different competitors from the\r\nconquest downwards, he being indisputably the lineal heir of the\r\nconqueror. And, what is still more remarkable, in his person also\r\ncentered the right of the Saxon monarchs, which had been suspended\r\nfrom the conquest till his accession. For, as was formerly observed,\r\nMargaret the sister of Edgar Atheling, the daughter of Edward the\r\noutlaw, and granddaughter of king Edmund Ironside, was the person in\r\nwhom the hereditary right of the Saxon kings, supposing it not\r\nabolished by the conquest, resided. She married Malcolm king of\r\nScotland; and Henry II, by a descent from Matilda their daughter, is\r\ngenerally called the restorer of the Saxon line. But it must be\r\nremembered, that Malcolm by his Saxon queen had sons as well as\r\ndaughters; and that the royal family of Scotland from that time\r\ndownwards were the offspring of Malcolm and Margaret. Of this royal\r\nfamily king James the first was the direct lineal heir, and therefore\r\nunited in his person every possible claim by hereditary right to the\r\nEnglish, as well as Scottish throne, being the heir both of Egbert and\r\nWilliam the conqueror.\r\n\r\nAND it is no wonder that a prince of more learning than wisdom, who\r\ncould deduce an hereditary title for more than eight hundred years,\r\nshould easily be taught by the flatterers of the times to believe\r\nthere was something divine in this right, and that the finger of\r\nprovidence was visible in it's preservation. Whereas, though a wise\r\ninstitution, it was clearly a human institution; and the right\r\ninherent in him no natural, but a positive right. And in this and no\r\nother light was it taken by the English parliament; who by statute 1\r\nJac. I. c. 1. did \"recognize and acknowlege, that immediately upon the\r\ndissolution and decease of Elizabeth late queen of England, the\r\nimperial crown thereof did by inherent birthright, and lawful and\r\nundoubted succession, descend and come to his most excellent majesty,\r\nas being lineally, justly, and lawfully, next and sole heir of the\r\nblood royal of this realm.\" Not a word here of any right immediately\r\nderived from heaven: which, if it existed any where, must be sought\r\nfor among the _aborigines_ of the island, the antient Britons; among\r\nwhose princes indeed some have gone to search it for him[w].\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: Elizabeth of York, the mother of queen Margaret of\r\nScotland, was heiress of the house of Mortimer. And Mr Carte observes,\r\nthat the house of Mortimer, in virtue of it's descent from Gladys only\r\nsister to Lewellin ap Jorweth the great, had the true right to the\r\nprincipality of Wales. iii. 705.]\r\n\r\nBUT, wild and absurd as the doctrine of divine right most undoubtedly\r\nis, it is still more astonishing, that when so many human hereditary\r\nrights had centered in this king, his son and heir king Charles the\r\nfirst should be told by those infamous judges, who pronounced his\r\nunparalleled sentence, that he was an elective prince; elected by his\r\npeople, and therefore accountable to them, in his own proper person,\r\nfor his conduct. The confusion, instability, and madness, which\r\nfollowed the fatal catastrophe of that pious and unfortunate prince,\r\nwill be a standing argument in favour of hereditary monarchy to all\r\nfuture ages; as they proved at last to the then deluded people: who,\r\nin order to recover that peace and happiness which for twenty years\r\ntogether they had lost, in a solemn parliamentary convention of the\r\nstates restored the right heir of the crown. And in the proclamation\r\nfor that purpose, which was drawn up and attended by both houses[x],\r\nthey declared, \"that, according to their duty and allegiance, they did\r\nheartily, joyfully, and unanimously acknowlege and proclaim, that\r\nimmediately upon the decease of our late sovereign lord king Charles,\r\nthe imperial crown of these realms did by inherent birthright and\r\nlawful and undoubted succession descend and come to his most excellent\r\nmajesty Charles the second, as being lineally, justly, and lawfully,\r\nnext heir of the blood royal of this realm: and thereunto they most\r\nhumbly and faithfully did submit and oblige themselves, their heirs\r\nand posterity for ever.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: Com. Journ. 8 May, 1660.]\r\n\r\nTHUS I think it clearly appears, from the highest authority this\r\nnation is acquainted with, that the crown of England hath been ever an\r\nhereditary crown; though subject to limitations by parliament. The\r\nremainder of this chapter will consist principally of those instances,\r\nwherein the parliament has asserted or exercised this right of\r\naltering and limiting the succession; a right which, we have seen, was\r\nbefore exercised and asserted in the reigns of Henry IV, Henry VII,\r\nHenry VIII, queen Mary, and queen Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nTHE first instance, in point of time, is the famous bill of exclusion,\r\nwhich raised such a ferment in the latter end of the reign of king\r\nCharles the second. It is well known, that the purport of this bill\r\nwas to have set aside the king's brother and presumptive heir, the\r\nduke of York, from the succession, on the score of his being a papist;\r\nthat it passed the house of commons, but was rejected by the lords;\r\nthe king having also declared beforehand, that he never would be\r\nbrought to consent to it. And from this transaction we may collect two\r\nthings: 1. That the crown was universally acknowleged to be\r\nhereditary; and the inheritance indefeasible unless by parliament:\r\nelse it had been needless to prefer such a bill. 2. That the\r\nparliament had a power to have defeated the inheritance: else such a\r\nbill had been ineffectual. The commons acknowleged the hereditary\r\nright then subsisting; and the lords did not dispute the power, but\r\nmerely the propriety, of an exclusion. However, as the bill took no\r\neffect, king James the second succeeded to the throne of his\r\nancestors; and might have enjoyed it during the remainder of his life,\r\nbut for his own infatuated conduct, which (with other concurring\r\ncircumstances) brought on the revolution in 1688.\r\n\r\nTHE true ground and principle, upon which that memorable event\r\nproceeded, was an entirely new case in politics, which had never\r\nbefore happened in our history; the abdication of the reigning\r\nmonarch, and the vacancy of the throne thereupon. It was not a\r\ndefeazance of the right of succession, and a new limitation of the\r\ncrown, by the king and both houses of parliament: it was the act of\r\nthe nation alone, upon an apprehension that there was no king in\r\nbeing. For in a full assembly of the lords and commons, met in\r\nconvention upon this apprehended vacancy, both houses[y] came to this\r\nresolution; \"that king James the second, having endeavoured to subvert\r\nthe constitution of the kingdom, by breaking the original contract\r\nbetween king and people; and, by the advice of jesuits and other\r\nwicked persons, having violated the fundamental laws; and having\r\nwithdrawn himself out of this kingdom; has abdicated the government,\r\nand that the throne is thereby vacant.\" Thus ended at once, by this\r\nsudden and unexpected vacancy of the throne, the old line of\r\nsuccession; which from the conquest had lasted above six hundred\r\nyears, and from the union of the heptarchy in king Egbert almost nine\r\nhundred. The facts themselves thus appealed to, the king's endeavours\r\nto subvert the constitution by breaking the original contract, his\r\nviolation of the fundamental laws, and his withdrawing himself out of\r\nthe kingdom, were evident and notorious: and the consequences drawn\r\nfrom these facts (namely, that they amounted to an abdication of the\r\ngovernment; which abdication did not affect only the person of the\r\nking himself, but also all his heirs, and rendered the throne\r\nabsolutely and completely vacant) it belonged to our ancestors to\r\ndetermine. For, whenever a question arises between the society at\r\nlarge and any magistrate vested with powers originally delegated by\r\nthat society, it must be decided by the voice of the society itself:\r\nthere is not upon earth any other tribunal to resort to. And that\r\nthese consequences were fairly deduced from these facts, our ancestors\r\nhave solemnly determined, in a full parliamentary convention\r\nrepresenting the whole society. The reasons upon which they decided\r\nmay be found at large in the parliamentary proceedings of the times;\r\nand may be matter of instructive amusement for us to contemplate, as a\r\nspeculative point of history. But care must be taken not to carry this\r\nenquiry farther, than merely for instruction or amusement. The idea,\r\nthat the consciences of posterity were concerned in the rectitude of\r\ntheir ancestors' decisions, gave birth to those dangerous political\r\nheresies, which so long distracted the state, but at length are all\r\nhappily extinguished. I therefore rather chuse to consider this great\r\npolitical measure, upon the solid footing of authority, than to reason\r\nin it's favour from it's justice, moderation, and expedience: because\r\nthat might imply a right of dissenting or revolting from it, in case\r\nwe should think it unjust, oppressive, or inexpedient. Whereas, our\r\nancestors having most indisputably a competent jurisdiction to decide\r\nthis great and important question, and having in fact decided it, it\r\nis now become our duty at this distance of time to acquiesce in their\r\ndetermination; being born under that establishment which was built\r\nupon this foundation, and obliged by every tie, religious as well as\r\ncivil, to maintain it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Com. Journ. 7 Feb. 1688.]\r\n\r\nBUT, while we rest this fundamental transaction, in point of\r\nauthority, upon grounds the least liable to cavil, we are bound both\r\nin justice and gratitude to add, that it was conducted with a temper\r\nand moderation which naturally arose from it's equity; that, however\r\nit might in some respects go beyond the letter of our antient laws,\r\n(the reason of which will more fully appear hereafter[z]) it was\r\nagreeable to the spirit of our constitution, and the rights of human\r\nnature; and that though in other points (owing to the peculiar\r\ncircumstances of things and persons) it was not altogether so perfect\r\nas might have been wished, yet from thence a new aera commenced, in\r\nwhich the bounds of prerogative and liberty have been better defined,\r\nthe principles of government more thoroughly examined and understood,\r\nand the rights of the subject more explicitly guarded by legal\r\nprovisions, than in any other period of the English history. In\r\nparticular, it is worthy observation that the convention, in this\r\ntheir judgment, avoided with great wisdom the wild extremes into which\r\nthe visionary theories of some zealous republicans would have led\r\nthem. They held that this misconduct of king James amounted to an\r\n_endeavour_ to subvert the constitution, and not to an actual\r\nsubversion, or total dissolution of the government, according to the\r\nprinciples of Mr Locke[a]: which would have reduced the society almost\r\nto a state of nature; would have levelled all distinctions of honour,\r\nrank, offices, and property; would have annihilated the sovereign\r\npower, and in consequence have repealed all positive laws; and would\r\nhave left the people at liberty to have erected a new system of state\r\nupon a new foundation of polity. They therefore very prudently voted\r\nit to amount to no more than an abdication of the government, and a\r\nconsequent vacancy of the throne; whereby the government was allowed\r\nto subsist, though the executive magistrate was gone, and the kingly\r\noffice to remain, though king James was no longer king. And thus the\r\nconstitution was kept intire; which upon every sound principle of\r\ngovernment must otherwise have fallen to pieces, had so principal and\r\nconstituent a part as the royal authority been abolished, or even\r\nsuspended.\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: See chapter 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: on Gov. p. 2. c. 19.]\r\n\r\nTHIS single postulatum, the vacancy of the throne, being once\r\nestablished, the rest that was then done followed almost of course.\r\nFor, if the throne be at any time vacant (which may happen by other\r\nmeans besides that of abdication; as if all the bloodroyal should\r\nfail, without any successor appointed by parliament;) if, I say, a\r\nvacancy by any means whatsoever should happen, the right of disposing\r\nof this vacancy seems naturally to result to the lords and commons,\r\nthe trustees and representatives of the nation. For there are no other\r\nhands in which it can so properly be intrusted; and there is a\r\nnecessity of it's being intrusted somewhere, else the whole frame of\r\ngovernment must be dissolved and perish. The lords and commons having\r\ntherefore determined this main fundamental article, that there was a\r\nvacancy of the throne, they proceeded to fill up that vacancy in such\r\nmanner as they judged the most proper. And this was done by their\r\ndeclaration of 12 February 1688[b], in the following manner: \"that\r\nWilliam and Mary, prince and princess of Orange, be, and be declared\r\nking and queen, to hold the crown and royal dignity during their\r\nlives, and the life of the survivor of them; and that the sole and\r\nfull exercise of the regal power be only in, and executed by, the said\r\nprince of Orange, in the names of the said prince and princess, during\r\ntheir joint lives; and after their deceases the said crown and royal\r\ndignity to be to the heirs of the body of the said princess; and for\r\ndefault of such issue to the princess Anne of Denmark and the heirs of\r\nher body; and for default of such issue to the heirs of the body of\r\nthe said prince of Orange.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Com. Journ. 12 Feb. 1688.]\r\n\r\nPERHAPS, upon the principles before established, the convention might\r\n(if they pleased) have vested the regal dignity in a family intirely\r\nnew, and strangers to the royal blood: but they were too well\r\nacquainted with the benefits of hereditary succession, and the\r\ninfluence which it has by custom over the minds of the people, to\r\ndepart any farther from the antient line than temporary necessity and\r\nself-preservation required. They therefore settled the crown, first on\r\nking William and queen Mary, king James's eldest daughter, for their\r\n_joint_ lives; then on the survivor of them; and then on the issue of\r\nqueen Mary: upon failure of such issue, it was limited to the princess\r\nAnne, king James's second daughter, and her issue; and lastly, on\r\nfailure of that, to the issue of king William, who was the grandson of\r\nCharles the first, and nephew as well as son in law of king James the\r\nsecond, being the son of Mary his only sister. This settlement\r\nincluded all the protestant posterity of king Charles I, except such\r\nother issue as king James might at any time have, which was totally\r\nomitted through fear of a popish succession. And this order of\r\nsuccession took effect accordingly.\r\n\r\nTHESE three princes therefore, king William, queen Mary, and queen\r\nAnne, did not take the crown by hereditary right or _descent_, but by\r\nway of donation or _purchase_, as the lawyers call it; by which they\r\nmean any method of acquiring an estate otherwise than by descent. The\r\nnew settlement did not merely consist in excluding king James, and the\r\nperson pretended to be prince of Wales, and then suffering the crown\r\nto descend in the old hereditary chanel: for the usual course of\r\ndescent was in some instances broken through; and yet the convention\r\nstill kept it in their eye, and paid a great, though not total, regard\r\nto it. Let us see how the succession would have stood, if no\r\nabdication had happened, and king James had left no other issue than\r\nhis two daughters queen Mary and queen Anne. It would have stood thus:\r\nqueen Mary and her issue; queen Anne and her issue; king William and\r\nhis issue. But we may remember, that queen Mary was only nominally\r\nqueen, jointly with her husband king William, who alone had the regal\r\npower; and king William was absolutely preferred to queen Anne, though\r\nhis issue was postponed to hers. Clearly therefore these princes were\r\nsuccessively in possession of the crown by a title different from the\r\nusual course of descent.\r\n\r\nIT was towards the end of king William's reign, when all hopes of any\r\nsurviving issue from any of these princes died with the duke of\r\nGlocester, that the king and parliament thought it necessary again to\r\nexert their power of limiting and appointing the succession, in order\r\nto prevent another vacancy of the throne; which must have ensued upon\r\ntheir deaths, as no farther provision was made at the revolution, than\r\nfor the issue of king William, queen Mary, and queen Anne. The\r\nparliament had previously by the statute of 1 W. & M. st. 2. c. 2.\r\nenacted, that every person who should be reconciled to, or hold\r\ncommunion with, the see of Rome, should profess the popish religion,\r\nor should marry a papist, should be excluded and for ever incapable to\r\ninherit, possess, or enjoy, the crown; and that in such case the\r\npeople should be absolved from their allegiance, and the crown should\r\ndescend to such persons, being protestants, as would have inherited\r\nthe same, in case the person so reconciled, holding communion,\r\nprofessing, or marrying, were naturally dead. To act therefore\r\nconsistently with themselves, and at the same time pay as much regard\r\nto the old hereditary line as their former resolutions would admit,\r\nthey turned their eyes on the princess Sophia, electress and duchess\r\ndowager of Hanover, the most accomplished princess of her age[c]. For,\r\nupon the impending extinction of the protestant posterity of Charles\r\nthe first, the old law of regal descent directed them to recur to the\r\ndescendants of James the first; and the princess Sophia, being the\r\ndaughter of Elizabeth queen of Bohemia, who was the youngest daughter\r\nof James the first, was the nearest of the antient blood royal, who\r\nwas not incapacitated by professing the popish religion. On her\r\ntherefore, and the heirs of her body, being protestants, the remainder\r\nof the crown, expectant on the death of king William and queen Anne\r\nwithout issue, was settled by statute 12 & 13 W. III. c. 2. And at the\r\nsame time it was enacted, that whosoever should hereafter come to the\r\npossession of the crown, should join in the communion of the church of\r\nEngland as by law established.\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Sandford, in his genealogical history, published _A.D._\r\n1677, speaking (page 535) of the princesses Elizabeth, Louisa, and\r\nSophia, daughters of the queen of Bohemia, says, the first was reputed\r\nthe most learned, the second the greatest artist, and the last one of\r\nthe most accomplished ladies in Europe.]\r\n\r\nTHIS is the last limitation of the crown that has been made by\r\nparliament: and these several actual limitations, from the time of\r\nHenry IV to the present, do clearly prove the power of the king and\r\nparliament to new-model or alter the succession. And indeed it is now\r\nagain made highly penal to dispute it: for by the statute 6 Ann. c. 7.\r\nit is enacted, that if any person maliciously, advisedly, and\r\ndirectly, shall maintain by writing or printing, that the kings of\r\nthis realm with the authority of parliament are not able to make laws\r\nto bind the crown and the descent thereof, he shall be guilty of high\r\ntreason; or if he maintains the same by only preaching, teaching, or\r\nadvised speaking, he shall incur the penalties of a praemunire.\r\n\r\nTHE princess Sophia dying before queen Anne, the inheritance thus\r\nlimited descended on her son and heir king George the first; and,\r\nhaving on the death of the queen taken effect in his person, from him\r\nit descended to his late majesty king George the second; and from him\r\nto his grandson and heir, our present gracious sovereign, king George\r\nthe third.\r\n\r\nHENCE it is easy to collect, that the title to the crown is at present\r\nhereditary, though not quite so absolutely hereditary as formerly; and\r\nthe common stock or ancestor, from whom the descent must be derived,\r\nis also different. Formerly the common stock was king Egbert; then\r\nWilliam the conqueror; afterwards in James the first's time the two\r\ncommon stocks united, and so continued till the vacancy of the throne\r\nin 1688: now it is the princess Sophia, in whom the inheritance was\r\nvested by the new king and parliament. Formerly the descent was\r\nabsolute, and the crown went to the next heir without any restriction:\r\nbut now, upon the new settlement, the inheritance is conditional,\r\nbeing limited to such heirs only, of the body of the princess Sophia,\r\nas are protestant members of the church of England, and are married to\r\nnone but protestants.\r\n\r\nAND in this due medium consists, I apprehend, the true constitutional\r\nnotion of the right of succession to the imperial crown of these\r\nkingdoms. The extremes, between which it steers, are each of them\r\nequally destructive of those ends for which societies were formed and\r\nare kept on foot. Where the magistrate, upon every succession, is\r\nelected by the people, and may by the express provision of the laws be\r\ndeposed (if not punished) by his subjects, this may sound like the\r\nperfection of liberty, and look well enough when delineated on paper;\r\nbut in practice will be ever productive of tumult, contention, and\r\nanarchy. And, on the other hand, divine indefeasible hereditary right,\r\nwhen coupled with the doctrine of unlimited passive obedience, is\r\nsurely of all constitutions the most thoroughly slavish and dreadful.\r\nBut when such an hereditary right, as our laws have created and vested\r\nin the royal stock, is closely interwoven with those liberties, which,\r\nwe have seen in a former chapter, are equally the inheritance of the\r\nsubject; this union will form a constitution, in theory the most\r\nbeautiful of any, in practice the most approved, and, I trust, in\r\nduration the most permanent. It was the duty of an expounder of our\r\nlaws to lay this constitution before the student in it's true and\r\ngenuine light: it is the duty of every good Englishman to understand,\r\nto revere, to defend it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FOURTH.\r\n\r\nOF THE KING'S ROYAL FAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE first and most considerable branch of the king's royal family,\r\nregarded by the laws of England, is the queen.\r\n\r\nTHE queen of England is either queen _regent_, queen _consort_, or\r\nqueen _dowager_. The queen _regent_, _regnant_, or _sovereign_, is she\r\nwho holds the crown in her own right; as the first (and perhaps the\r\nsecond) queen Mary, queen Elizabeth, and queen Anne; and such a one\r\nhas the same powers, prerogatives, rights, dignities, and duties, as\r\nif she had been a king. This was observed in the entrance of the last\r\nchapter, and is expressly declared by statute 1 Mar. I. st. 3. c. 1.\r\nBut the queen _consort_ is the wife of the reigning king; and she by\r\nvirtue of her marriage is participant of divers prerogatives above\r\nother women[a].\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: Finch. L. 86.]\r\n\r\nAND, first, she is a public person, exempt and distinct from the king;\r\nand not, like other married women, so closely connected as to have\r\nlost all legal or separate existence so long as the marriage\r\ncontinues. For the queen is of ability to purchase lands, and to\r\nconvey them, to make leases, to grant copyholds, and do other acts of\r\nownership, without the concurrence of her lord; which no other married\r\nwoman can do[b]: a privilege as old as the Saxon aera[c]. She is also\r\ncapable of taking a grant from the king, which no other wife is from\r\nher husband; and in this particular she agrees with the _augusta_, or\r\n_piissima regina conjux divi imperatoris_ of the Roman laws; who,\r\naccording to Justinian[d], was equally capable of making a grant to,\r\nand receiving one from, the emperor. The queen of England hath\r\nseparate courts and officers distinct from the king's, not only in\r\nmatters of ceremony, but even of law; and her attorney and solicitor\r\ngeneral are intitled to a place within the bar of his majesty's\r\ncourts, together with the king's counsel[e]. She may also sue and be\r\nsued alone, without joining her husband. She may also have a separate\r\nproperty in goods as well as lands, and has a right to dispose of them\r\nby will. In short, she is in all legal proceedings looked upon as a\r\nfeme sole, and not as a feme covert; as a single, not as a married\r\nwoman[f]. For which the reason given by Sir Edward Coke is this:\r\nbecause the wisdom of the common law would not have the king (whose\r\ncontinual care and study is for the public, and _circa ardua regni_)\r\nto be troubled and disquieted on account of his wife's domestic\r\naffairs; and therefore it vests in the queen a power of transacting\r\nher own concerns, without the intervention of the king, as if she was\r\nan unmarried woman.\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: 4 Rep. 23.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Seld. _Jan. Angl._ 1. 42.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: _Cod._ 5. 16. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Selden tit. hon. 1. 6. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Finch. L. 86. Co. Litt. 133.]\r\n\r\nTHE queen hath also many exemptions, and minute prerogatives. For\r\ninstance: she pays no toll[g]; nor is she liable to any amercement in\r\nany court[h]. But in general, unless where the law has expressly\r\ndeclared her exempted, she is upon the same footing with other\r\nsubjects; being to all intents and purposes the king's subject, and\r\nnot his equal: in like manner as, in the imperial law, \"_augusta\r\nlegibus soluta non est_[i].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Co. Litt. 133.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Finch. L. 185.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: _Ff._ 1. 3. 31.]\r\n\r\nTHE queen hath also some pecuniary advantages, which form her a\r\ndistinct revenue: as, in the first place, she is intitled to an\r\nantient perquisite called queen-gold or _aurum reginae_; which is a\r\nroyal revenue, belonging to every queen consort during her marriage\r\nwith the king, and due from every person who hath made a voluntary\r\noffering or fine to the king, amounting to ten marks or upwards, for\r\nand in consideration of any privileges, grants, licences, pardons, or\r\nother matter of royal favour conferred upon him by the king: and it is\r\ndue in the proportion of one tenth part more, over and above the\r\nintire offering or fine made to the king; and becomes an actual debt\r\nof record to the queen's majesty by the mere recording the fine[k].\r\nAs, if an hundred marks of silver be given to the king for liberty to\r\ntake in mortmain, or to have a fair, market, park, chase, or free\r\nwarren; there the queen is intitled to ten marks in silver, or (what\r\nwas formerly an equivalent denomination) to one mark in gold, by the\r\nname of queen-gold, or _aurum reginae_[l]. But no such payment is due\r\nfor any aids or subsidies granted to the king in parliament or\r\nconvocation; nor for fines imposed by courts on offenders, against\r\ntheir will; nor for voluntary presents to the king, without any\r\nconsideration moving from him to the subject; nor for any sale or\r\ncontract whereby the present revenues or possessions of the crown are\r\ngranted away or diminished[m].\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Pryn. _Aur. Reg._ 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: 12 Rep. 21. 4 Inst. 358.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: _Ibid._ Pryn. 6. Madox. hist. exch. 242.]\r\n\r\nTHE revenue of our antient queens, before and soon after the conquest,\r\nseems to have consisted in certain reservations or rents out of the\r\ndemesne lands of the crown, which were expressly appropriated to her\r\nmajesty, distinct from the king. It is frequent in domesday-book,\r\nafter specifying the rent due to the crown, to add likewise the\r\nquantity of gold or other renders reserved to the queen[n]. These were\r\nfrequently appropriated to particular purposes; to buy wool for her\r\nmajesty's use[o], to purchase oyl for her lamps[p], or to furnish her\r\nattire from head to foot[q], which was frequently very costly, as one\r\nsingle robe in the fifth year of Henry II stood the city of London in\r\nupwards of fourscore pounds[r]. A practice somewhat similar to that of\r\nthe eastern countries, where whole cities and provinces were\r\nspecifically assigned to purchase particular parts of the queen's\r\napparel[s]. And, for a farther addition to her income, this duty of\r\nqueen-gold is supposed to have been originally granted; those matters\r\nof grace and favour, out of which it arose, being frequently obtained\r\nfrom the crown by the powerful intercession of the queen. There are\r\ntraces of it's payment, though obscure ones, in the book of domesday\r\nand in the great pipe-roll of Henry the first[t]. In the reign of\r\nHenry the second the manner of collecting it appears to have been well\r\nunderstood, and it forms a distinct head in the antient dialogue of\r\nthe exchequer[u] written in the time of that prince, and usually\r\nattributed to Gervase of Tilbury. From that time downwards it was\r\nregularly claimed and enjoyed by all the queen consorts of England\r\ntill the death of Henry VIII; though after the accession of the Tudor\r\nfamily the collecting of it seems to have been much neglected: and,\r\nthere being no queen consort afterwards till the accession of James I,\r\na period of near sixty years, it's very nature and quantity became\r\nthen a matter of doubt: and, being referred by the king to his then\r\nchief justices and chief baron, their report of it was so very\r\nunfavorable[w], that queen Anne (though she claimed it) yet never\r\nthought proper to exact it. In 1635, 11 Car. I, a time fertile of\r\nexpedients for raising money upon dormant precedents in our old\r\nrecords (of which ship-money was a fatal instance) the king, at the\r\npetition of his queen Henrietta Maria, issued out his writ for levying\r\nit; but afterwards purchased it of his consort at the price of ten\r\nthousand pounds; finding it, perhaps, too trifling and troublesome to\r\nlevy. And when afterwards, at the restoration, by the abolition of the\r\nmilitary tenures, and the fines that were consequent upon them, the\r\nlittle that legally remained of this revenue was reduced to almost\r\nnothing at all, in vain did Mr Prynne, by a treatise which does honour\r\nto his abilities as a painful and judicious antiquarian, endeavour to\r\nexcite queen Catherine to revive this antiquated claim.\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: _Bedefordscire.

Reg._ 125.]\r\n\r\nANOTHER antient perquisite belonging to the queen consort, mentioned\r\nby all our old writers[x], and, therefore only, worthy notice, is\r\nthis: that on the taking of a whale on the coasts, which is a royal\r\nfish, it shall be divided between the king and queen; the head only\r\nbeing the king's property, and the tail of it the queen's. \"_De\r\nsturgione observetur, quod rex illum habebit integrum: de balena vero\r\nsufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam._\" The reason of this\r\nwhimsical division, as assigned by our antient records[y], was, to\r\nfurnish the queen's wardrobe with whalebone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: Bracton, _l._ 3. _c._ 3. Britton, _c._ 17. Fleta, _l._ 1.\r\n_c._ 45 & 46.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Pryn. _Aur. Reg._ 127.]\r\n\r\nBUT farther: though the queen is in all respects a subject, yet, in\r\npoint of the security of her life and person, she is put on the same\r\nfooting with the king. It is equally treason (by the statute 25 Edw.\r\nIII.) to compass or imagine the death of our lady the king's\r\ncompanion, as of the king himself: and to violate, or defile, the\r\nqueen consort, amounts to the same high crime; as well in the person\r\ncommitting the fact, as in the queen herself, if consenting. A law of\r\nHenry the eighth[z] made it treason also for any woman, who was not a\r\nvirgin, to marry the king without informing him thereof. But this law\r\nwas soon after repealed; it trespassing too strongly, as well on\r\nnatural justice, as female modesty. If however the queen be accused\r\nof any species of treason, she shall (whether consort or dowager) be\r\ntried by the house of peers, as queen Ann Boleyn was in 28 Hen. VIII.\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: Stat. 33 Hen. VIII. c. 21.]\r\n\r\nTHE husband of a queen regnant, as prince George of Denmark was to\r\nqueen Anne, is her subject; and may be guilty of high treason against\r\nher: but, in the instance of conjugal fidelity, he is not subjected to\r\nthe same penal restrictions. For which the reason seems to be, that,\r\nif a queen consort is unfaithful to the royal bed, this may debase or\r\nbastardize the heirs to the crown; but no such danger can be\r\nconsequent on the infidelity of the husband to a queen regnant.\r\n\r\nA QUEEN _dowager_ is the widow of the king, and as such enjoys most of\r\nthe privileges belonging to her as queen consort. But it is not high\r\ntreason to conspire her death; or to violate her chastity, for the\r\nsame reason as was before alleged, because the succession to the crown\r\nis not thereby endangered. Yet still, _pro dignitate regali_, no man\r\ncan marry a queen dowager without special licence from the king, on\r\npain of forfeiting his lands and goods. This sir Edward Coke[a] tells\r\nus was enacted in parliament in 6 Hen. IV, though the statute be not\r\nin print. But she, though an alien born, shall still be intitled to\r\ndower after the king's demise, which no other alien is[b]. A queen\r\ndowager, when married again to a subject, doth not lose her regal\r\ndignity, as peeresses dowager do their peerage when they marry\r\ncommoners. For Katherine, queen dowager of Henry V, though she married\r\na private gentleman, Owen ap Meredith ap Theodore, commonly called\r\nOwen Tudor; yet, by the name of Katherine queen of England, maintained\r\nan action against the bishop of Carlisle. And so the queen of Navarre\r\nmarrying with Edmond, brother to king Edward the first, maintained an\r\naction of dower by the name of queen of Navarre[c].\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: 2 Inst. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Co. Litt. 31 _b._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: 2 Inst. 50.]\r\n\r\nTHE prince of Wales, or heir apparent to the crown, and also his royal\r\nconsort, and the princess royal, or eldest daughter of the king, are\r\nlikewise peculiarly regarded by the laws. For, by statute 25 Edw. III,\r\nto compass or conspire the death of the former, or to violate the\r\nchastity of either of the latter, are as much high treason, as to\r\nconspire the death of the king, or violate the chastity of the queen.\r\nAnd this upon the same reason, as was before given; because the prince\r\nof Wales is next in succession to the crown, and to violate his wife\r\nmight taint the blood royal with bastardy: and the eldest daughter of\r\nthe king is also alone inheritable to the crown, in failure of issue\r\nmale, and therefore more respected by the laws than any of her younger\r\nsisters; insomuch that upon this, united with other (feodal)\r\nprinciples, while our military tenures were in force, the king might\r\nlevy an aid for marrying his eldest daughter, and her only. The heir\r\napparent to the crown is usually made prince of Wales and earl of\r\nChester, by special creation, and investiture; but, being the king's\r\neldest son, he is by inheritance duke of Cornwall, without any new\r\ncreation[d].\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: 8 Rep. 1. Seld. titl. of hon. 2. 5.]\r\n\r\nTHE younger sons and daughters of the king, who are not in the\r\nimmediate line of succession, are little farther regarded by the laws,\r\nthan to give them precedence before all peers and public officers as\r\nwell ecclesiastical as temporal. This is done by the statute 31 Hen.\r\nVIII. c. 10. which enacts that no person, except the king's children,\r\nshall presume to sit or have place at the side of the cloth of estate\r\nin the parliament chamber; and that certain great officers therein\r\nnamed shall have precedence above all dukes, except only such as shall\r\nhappen to be the king's son, brother, uncle, nephew (which sir Edward\r\nCoke[e] explains to signify grandson or _nepos_) or brother's or\r\nsister's son. And in 1718, upon a question referred to all the judges\r\nby king George I, it was resolved by the opinion of ten against the\r\nother two, that the education and care of all the king's\r\ngrandchildren while minors, and the care and approbation of their\r\nmarriages, when grown up, did belong of right to his majesty as king\r\nof this realm, during their father's life[f]. And this may suffice for\r\nthe notice, taken by law, of his majesty's royal family.\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: 4 Inst. 362.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Fortesc. Al. 401-440.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIFTH.\r\n\r\nOF THE COUNCILS BELONGING TO THE KING.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE third point of view, in which we are to consider the king, is with\r\nregard to his councils. For, in order to assist him in the discharge\r\nof his duties, the maintenance of his dignity, and the exertion of his\r\nprerogative, the law hath assigned him a diversity of councils to\r\nadvise with.\r\n\r\n1. THE first of these is the high court of parliament, whereof we have\r\nalready treated at large.\r\n\r\n2. SECONDLY, the peers of the realm are by their birth hereditary\r\ncounsellors of the crown, and may be called together by the king to\r\nimpart their advice in all matters of importance to the realm, either\r\nin time of parliament, or, which hath been their principal use, when\r\nthere is no parliament in being[a]. Accordingly Bracton[b], speaking\r\nof the nobility of his time, says they might properly be called\r\n\"_consules, a consulendo; reges enim tales sibi associant ad\r\nconsulendum_.\" And in our law books[c] it is laid down, that peers are\r\ncreated for two reasons; 1. _Ad consulendum_, 2. _Ad defendendum\r\nregem_: for which reasons the law gives them certain great and high\r\nprivileges; such as freedom from arrests, &c, even when no parliament\r\nis sitting: because the law intends, that they are always assisting\r\nthe king with their counsel for the commonwealth; or keeping the realm\r\nin safety by their prowess and valour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: Co. Litt. 110.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: _l._ 1. _c._ 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: 7 Rep. 34. 9 Rep. 49. 12 Rep. 96.]\r\n\r\nINSTANCES of conventions of the peers, to advise the king, have been\r\nin former times very frequent; though now fallen into disuse, by\r\nreason of the more regular meetings of parliament. Sir Edward Coke[d]\r\ngives us an extract of a record, 5 Hen. IV, concerning an exchange of\r\nlands between the king and the earl of Northumberland, wherein the\r\nvalue of each was agreed to be settled by advice of parliament (if any\r\nshould be called before the feast of St Lucia) or otherwise by advice\r\nof the grand council (of peers) which the king promises to assemble\r\nbefore the said feast, in case no parliament shall be called. Many\r\nother instances of this kind of meeting are to be found under our\r\nantient kings: though the formal method of convoking them had been so\r\nlong left off, that when king Charles I in 1640 issued out writs under\r\nthe great seal to call a great council of all the peers of England to\r\nmeet and attend his majesty at York, previous to the meeting of the\r\nlong parliament, the earl of Clarendon[e] mentions it as a new\r\ninvention, not before heard of; that is, as he explains himself, so\r\nold, that it had not been practiced in some hundreds of years. But,\r\nthough there had not so long before been an instance, nor has there\r\nbeen any since, of assembling them in so solemn a manner, yet, in\r\ncases of emergency, our princes have at several times thought proper\r\nto call for and consult as many of the nobility as could easily be got\r\ntogether: as was particularly the case with king James the second,\r\nafter the landing of the prince of Orange; and with the prince of\r\nOrange himself, before he called that convention parliament, which\r\nafterwards called him to the throne.\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: 1 Inst. 110.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Hist. b. 2.]\r\n\r\nBESIDES this general meeting, it is usually looked upon to be the\r\nright of each particular peer of the realm, to demand an audience of\r\nthe king, and to lay before him, with decency and respect, such\r\nmatters as he shall judge of importance to the public weal. And\r\ntherefore, in the reign of Edward II, it was made an article of\r\nimpeachment in parliament against the two Hugh Spencers, father and\r\nson, for which they were banished the kingdom, \"that they by their\r\nevil covin would not suffer the great men of the realm, the king's\r\ngood counsellors, to speak with the king, or to come near him; but\r\nonly in the presence and hearing of the said Hugh the father and Hugh\r\nthe son, or one of them, and at their will, and according to such\r\nthings as pleased them[f].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: 4 Inst. 53.]\r\n\r\n3. A THIRD council belonging the king, are, according to sir Edward\r\nCoke[g], his judges of the courts of law, for law matters. And this\r\nappears frequently in our statutes, particularly 14 Ed. III. c. 5. and\r\nin other books of law. So that when the king's council is mentioned\r\ngenerally, it must be defined, particularized, and understood,\r\n_secundum subjectam materiam_; and, if the subject be of a legal\r\nnature, then by the king's council is understood his council for\r\nmatters of law; namely, his judges. Therefore when by statute 16 Ric.\r\nII. c. 5. it was made a high offence to import into this kingdom any\r\npapal bulles, or other processes from Rome; and it was enacted, that\r\nthe offenders should be attached by their bodies, and brought before\r\nthe king and his _council_ to answer for such offence; here, by the\r\nexpression of king's _council_, were understood the king's judges of\r\nhis courts of justice, the subject matter being legal: this being the\r\ngeneral way of interpreting the word, _council_[h].\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: 1 Inst. 110.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: 3 Inst. 125.]\r\n\r\n4. BUT the principal council belonging to the king is his privy\r\ncouncil, which is generally called, by way of eminence, _the council_.\r\nAnd this, according to sir Edward Coke's description of it[i], is a\r\nnoble, honorable, and reverend assembly, of the king and such as he\r\nwills to be of his privy council, in the king's court or palace. The\r\nking's will is the sole constituent of a privy counsellor; and this\r\nalso regulates their number, which of antient time was twelve or\r\nthereabouts. Afterwards it increased to so large a number, that it was\r\nfound inconvenient for secresy and dispatch; and therefore king\r\nCharles the second in 1679 limited it to thirty: whereof fifteen were\r\nto be the principal officers of state, and those to be counsellors,\r\n_virtute officii_; and the other fifteen were composed of ten lords\r\nand five commoners of the king's choosing[k]. But since that time the\r\nnumber has been much augmented, and now continues indefinite. At the\r\nsame time also, the antient office of lord president of the council\r\nwas revived in the person of Anthony earl of Shaftsbury; an officer,\r\nthat by the statute of 31 Hen. VIII. c. 10. has precedence next after\r\nthe lord chancellor and lord treasurer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: 4 Inst. 53.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Temple's Mem. part 3.]\r\n\r\nPRIVY counsellors are _made_ by the king's nomination, without either\r\npatent or grant; and, on taking the necessary oaths, they become\r\nimmediately privy counsellors during the life of the king that chooses\r\nthem, but subject to removal at his discretion.\r\n\r\nTHE _duty_ of a privy counsellor appears from the oath of office[l],\r\nwhich consists of seven articles: 1. To advise the king according to\r\nthe best of his cunning and discretion. 2. To advise for the king's\r\nhonour and good of the public, without partiality through affection,\r\nlove, meed, doubt, or dread. 3. To keep the king's counsel secret. 4.\r\nTo avoid corruption. 5. To help and strengthen the execution of what\r\nshall be there resolved. 6. To withstand all persons who would attempt\r\nthe contrary. And, lastly, in general, 7. To observe, keep, and do all\r\nthat a good and true counsellor ought to do to his sovereign lord.\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: 4 Inst. 54.]\r\n\r\nTHE _power_ of the privy council is to enquire into all offences\r\nagainst the government, and to commit the offenders into custody, in\r\norder to take their trial in some of the courts of law. But their\r\njurisdiction is only to enquire, and not to punish: and the persons\r\ncommitted by them are entitled to their _habeas corpus_ by statute 16\r\nCar. I. c. 10. as much as if committed by an ordinary justice of the\r\npeace. And, by the same statute, the court of starchamber, and the\r\ncourt of requests, both of which consisted of privy counsellors, were\r\ndissolved; and it was declared illegal for them to take cognizance of\r\nany matter of property, belonging to the subjects of this kingdom.\r\nBut, in plantation or admiralty causes, which arise out of the\r\njurisdiction of this kingdom, and in matters of lunacy and ideocy\r\n(being a special flower of the prerogative) with regard to these,\r\nalthough they may eventually involve questions of extensive property,\r\nthe privy council continues to have cognizance, being the court of\r\nappeal in such causes: or, rather, the appeal lies to the king's\r\nmajesty himself, assisted by his privy council.\r\n\r\nAS to the _qualifications_ of members to sit this board: any natural\r\nborn subject of England is capable of being a member of the privy\r\ncouncil; taking the proper oaths for security of the government, and\r\nthe test for security of the church. But, in order to prevent any\r\npersons under foreign attachments from insinuating themselves into\r\nthis important trust, as happened in the reign of king William in many\r\ninstances, it is enacted by the act of settlement[m], that no person\r\nborn out of the dominions of the crown of England, unless born of\r\nEnglish parents, even though naturalized by parliament, shall be\r\ncapable of being of the privy council.\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: Stat. 12. & 13 W. III. c. 2.]\r\n\r\nTHE _privileges_ of privy counsellors, as such, consist principally in\r\nthe security which the law has given them against attempts and\r\nconspiracies to destroy their lives. For, by statute 3 Hen. VII. c.\r\n14. if any of the king's servants of his houshold, conspire or imagine\r\nto take away the life of a privy counsellor, it is felony, though\r\nnothing be done upon it. And the reason of making this statute, sir\r\nEdward Coke[n] tells us, was because such servants have greater and\r\nreadier means, either by night or by day, to destroy such as be of\r\ngreat authority, and near about the king: and such a conspiracy was,\r\njust before this parliament, made by some of king Henry the seventh's\r\nhoushold servants, and great mischief was like to have ensued\r\nthereupon. This extends only to the king's menial servants. But the\r\nstatute 9 Ann. c. 16. goes farther, and enacts, that _any persons_\r\nthat shall unlawfully attempt to kill, or shall unlawfully assault,\r\nand strike, or wound, any privy counsellor in the execution of his\r\noffice, shall be felons, and suffer death as such. This statute was\r\nmade upon the daring attempt of the sieur Guiscard, who stabbed Mr\r\nHarley, afterwards earl of Oxford, with a penknife, when under\r\nexamination for high crimes in a committee of the privy council.\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: 3 Inst. 38.]\r\n\r\nTHE _dissolution_ of the privy council depends upon the king's\r\npleasure; and he may, whenever he thinks proper, discharge any\r\nparticular member, or the whole of it, and appoint another. By the\r\ncommon law also it was dissolved _ipso facto_ by the king's demise; as\r\nderiving all it's authority from him. But now, to prevent the\r\ninconveniences of having no council in being at the accession of a new\r\nprince, it is enacted by statute 6 Ann. c. 7. that the privy council\r\nshall continue for six months after the demise of the crown, unless\r\nsooner determined by the successor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SIXTH.\r\n\r\nOF THE KING'S DUTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI PROCEED next to the duties, incumbent on the king by our\r\nconstitution; in consideration of which duties his dignity and\r\nprerogative are established by the laws of the land: it being a maxim\r\nin the law, that protection and subjection are reciprocal[a]. And\r\nthese reciprocal duties are what, I apprehend, were meant by the\r\nconvention in 1688, when they declared that king James had broken the\r\n_original contract_ between king and people. But however, as the terms\r\nof that original contract were in some measure disputed, being alleged\r\nto exist principally in theory, and to be only deducible by reason and\r\nthe rules of natural law; in which deduction different understandings\r\nmight very considerably differ; it was, after the revolution, judged\r\nproper to declare these duties expressly; and to reduce that contract\r\nto a plain certainty. So that, whatever doubts might be formerly\r\nraised by weak and scrupulous minds about the existence of such an\r\noriginal contract, they must now entirely cease; especially with\r\nregard to every prince, who has reigned since the year 1688.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: 7 Rep. 5.]\r\n\r\nTHE principal duty of the king is, to govern his people according to\r\nlaw. _Nec regibus infinita aut libera potestas_, was the constitution\r\nof our German ancestors on the continent[b]. And this is not only\r\nconsonant to the principles of nature, of liberty, of reason, and of\r\nsociety, but has always been esteemed an express part of the common\r\nlaw of England, even when prerogative was at the highest. \"The king,\"\r\nsaith Bracton[c], who wrote under Henry III, \"ought not to be subject\r\nto man, but to God, and to the law; for the law maketh the king. Let\r\nthe king therefore render to the law, what the law has invested in him\r\nwith regard to others; dominion, and power: for he is not truly king,\r\nwhere will and pleasure rules, and not the law.\" And again[d]; \"the\r\nking also hath a superior, namely God, and also the law, by which he\r\nwas made a king.\" Thus Bracton: and Fortescue also[e], having first\r\nwell distinguished between a monarchy absolutely and despotically\r\nregal, which is introduced by conquest and violence, and a political\r\nor civil monarchy, which arises from mutual consent; (of which last\r\nspecies he asserts the government of England to be) immediately lays\r\nit down as a principle, that \"the king of England must rule his people\r\naccording to the decrees of the laws thereof: insomuch that he is\r\nbound by an oath at his coronation to the observance and keeping of\r\nhis own laws.\" But, to obviate all doubts and difficulties concerning\r\nthis matter, it is expressly declared by statute 12 & 13 W. III. c. 2.\r\nthat \"the laws of England are the birthright of the people thereof;\r\nand all the kings and queens who shall ascend the throne of this realm\r\nought to administer the government of the same according to the said\r\nlaws; and all their officers and ministers ought to serve them\r\nrespectively according to the same: and therefore all the laws and\r\nstatutes of this realm, for securing the established religion, and the\r\nrights and liberties of the people thereof, and all other laws and\r\nstatutes of the same now in force, are by his majesty, by and with the\r\nadvice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal and commons,\r\nand by authority of the same, ratified and confirmed accordingly.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: _Tac. de M.G._ _c._ 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: _l._ 1. _c._ 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: _l._ 2. _c._ 16. §. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: _c._ 9. & 34.]\r\n\r\nAND, as to the terms of the original contract between king and people,\r\nthese I apprehend to be now couched in the coronation oath, which by\r\nthe statute 1 W. & M. st. 1. c. 6. is to be administred to every king\r\nand queen, who shall succeed to the imperial crown of these realms, by\r\none of the archbishops or bishops of the realm, in the presence of all\r\nthe people; who on their parts do reciprocally take the oath of\r\nallegiance to the crown. This coronation oath is conceived in the\r\nfollowing terms:\r\n\r\n\"_The archbishop or bishop shall say_, Will you solemnly promise and\r\nswear to govern the people of this kingdom of England, and the\r\ndominions thereto belonging, according to the statutes in parliament\r\nagreed on, and the laws and customs of the same?--_The king or queen\r\nshall say_, I solemnly promise so to do.\r\n\r\n\"_Archbishop or bishop._ Will you to your power cause law and justice,\r\nin mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?--_King or queen._ I\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n\"_Archbishop or bishop._ Will you to the utmost of your power maintain\r\nthe laws of God, the true profession of the gospel, and the protestant\r\nreformed religion established by the law? And will you preserve unto\r\nthe bishops and clergy of this realm, and to the churches committed to\r\ntheir charge, all such rights and privileges as by law do or shall\r\nappertain unto them, or any of them?--_King or queen._ All this I\r\npromise to do.\r\n\r\n\"_After this the king or queen, laying his or her hand upon the holy\r\ngospels, shall say_, The things which I have here before promised I\r\nwill perform and keep: so help me God. _And then shall kiss the\r\nbook._\"\r\n\r\nTHIS is the form of the coronation oath, as it is now prescribed by\r\nour laws: the principal articles of which appear to be at least as\r\nantient as the mirror of justices[f], and even as the time of\r\nBracton[g]: but the wording of it was changed at the revolution,\r\nbecause (as the statute alleges) the oath itself had been framed in\r\ndoubtful words and expressions, with relation to antient laws and\r\nconstitutions at this time unknown[h]. However, in what form soever it\r\nbe conceived, this is most indisputably a fundamental and original\r\nexpress contract; though doubtless the duty of protection is impliedly\r\nas much incumbent on the sovereign before coronation as after: in the\r\nsame manner as allegiance to the king becomes the duty of the subject\r\nimmediately on the descent of the crown, before he has taken the oath\r\nof allegiance, or whether he ever takes it at all. This reciprocal\r\nduty of the subject will be considered in it's proper place. At\r\npresent we are only to observe, that in the king's part of this\r\noriginal contract are expressed all the duties that a monarch can owe\r\nto his people; viz. to govern according to law: to execute judgment in\r\nmercy: and to maintain the established religion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: _cap._ 1. §. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: _l._ 3. _tr._ 1. _c._ 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: In the old folio abridgment of the statutes, printed by\r\nLettou and Machlinia in the reign of Edward IV, (_penes me_) there is\r\npreserved a copy of the old coronation oath; which, as the book is\r\nextremely scarce, I will here transcribe. _Ceo est le serement que le\r\nroy jurre a soun coronement: que il gardera et meintenera lez droitez\r\net lez franchisez de seynt esglise grauntez auncienment dez droitez\r\nroys christiens dEngletere, et quil gardera toutez sez terrez honoures\r\net dignitees droiturelx et franks del coron du roialme dEngletere en\r\ntout maner dentierte sanz null maner damenusement, et lez droitez\r\ndispergez dilapidez ou perduz de la corone a soun poiair reappeller en\r\nlauncien estate, et quil gardera le peas de seynt esglise et al\r\nclergie et al people de bon accorde, et quil face faire en toutez sez\r\njugementez owel et droit justice oue discrecion et misericorde, et\r\nquil grauntera a tenure lez leyes et custumez du roialme, et a soun\r\npoiair lez face garder et affermer que lez gentez du people avont\r\nfaitez et esliez, et les malveys leyz et custumes de tout oustera, et\r\nferme peas et establie al people de soun roialme en ceo garde\r\nesgardera a soun poiair: come Dieu luy aide._ _Tit. sacramentum regis.\r\nfol. m. ij._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SEVENTH.\r\n\r\nOF THE KING'S PREROGATIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was observed in a former chapter[a], that one of the principal\r\nbulwarks of civil liberty, or (in other words) of the British\r\nconstitution, was the limitation of the king's prerogative by bounds\r\nso certain and notorious, that it is impossible he should ever exceed\r\nthem, without the consent of the people, on the one hand; or without,\r\non the other, a violation of that original contract, which in all\r\nstates impliedly, and in ours most expressly, subsists between the\r\nprince and the subject. It will now be our business to consider this\r\nprerogative minutely; to demonstrate it's necessity in general; and to\r\nmark out in the most important instances it's particular extent and\r\nrestrictions: from which considerations this conclusion will evidently\r\nfollow, that the powers which are vested in the crown by the laws of\r\nEngland, are necessary for the support of society; and do not intrench\r\nany farther on our _natural_ liberties, than is expedient for the\r\nmaintenance of our _civil_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: chap. 1. page 137.]\r\n\r\nTHERE cannot be a stronger proof of that genuine freedom, which is the\r\nboast of this age and country, than the power of discussing and\r\nexamining, with decency and respect, the limits of the king's\r\nprerogative. A topic, that in some former ages was thought too\r\ndelicate and sacred to be profaned by the pen of a subject. It was\r\nranked among the _arcana imperii_; and, like the mysteries of the\r\n_bona dea_, was not suffered to be pried into by any but such as were\r\ninitiated in it's service: because perhaps the exertion of the one,\r\nlike the solemnities of the other, would not bear the inspexion of a\r\nrational and sober enquiry. The glorious queen Elizabeth herself made\r\nno scruple to direct her parliaments to abstain from discoursing of\r\nmatters of state[b]; and it was the constant language of this favorite\r\nprincess and her ministers, that even that august assembly \"ought not\r\nto deal, to judge, or to meddle, with her majesty's prerogative\r\nroyal[c].\" And her successor, king James the first, who had imbibed\r\nhigh notions of the divinity of regal sway, more than once laid it\r\ndown in his speeches, that \"as it is atheism and blasphemy in a\r\ncreature to dispute what the deity may do, so it is presumption and\r\nsedition in a subject to dispute what a king may do in the height of\r\nhis power: good christians, he adds, will be content with God's will,\r\nrevealed in his word; and good subjects will rest in the king's will,\r\nrevealed in _his_ law[d].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Dewes. 479.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: _Ibid._ 645.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: King James's works. 557, 531.]\r\n\r\nBUT, whatever might be the sentiments of some of our princes, this was\r\nnever the language of our antient constitution and laws. The\r\nlimitation of the regal authority was a first and essential principle\r\nin all the Gothic systems of government established in Europe; though\r\ngradually driven out and overborne, by violence and chicane, in most\r\nof the kingdoms on the continent. We have seen, in the preceding\r\nchapter, the sentiments of Bracton and Fortescue, at the distance of\r\ntwo centuries from each other. And sir Henry Finch, under Charles the\r\nfirst, after the lapse of two centuries more, though he lays down the\r\nlaw of prerogative in very strong and emphatical terms, yet qualifies\r\nit with a general restriction, in regard to the liberties of the\r\npeople. \"The king hath a prerogative in all things, that are not\r\ninjurious to the subject; for in them all it must be remembered, that\r\nthe king's prerogative stretcheth not to the doing of any wrong[e].\"\r\n_Nihil enim aliud potest rex, nisi id solum quod de jure potest_[f].\r\nAnd here it may be some satisfaction to remark, how widely the civil\r\nlaw differs from our own, with regard to the authority of the laws\r\nover the prince, or (as a civilian would rather have expressed it) the\r\nauthority of the prince over the laws. It is a maxim of the English\r\nlaw, as we have seen from Bracton, that \"_rex debet esse sub lege,\r\nquia lex facit regem_:\" the imperial law will tell us, that \"_in\r\nomnibus, imperatoris excipitur fortuna; cui ipsas leges Deus\r\nsubjecit_[g].\" We shall not long hesitate to which of them to give the\r\npreference, as most conducive to those ends for which societies were\r\nframed, and are kept together; especially as the Roman lawyers\r\nthemselves seem to be sensible of the unreasonableness of their own\r\nconstitution. \"_Decet tamen principem_,\" says Paulus, \"_servare leges,\r\nquibus ipse solutus est_[h].\" This is at once laying down the\r\nprinciple of despotic power, and at the same time acknowleging it's\r\nabsurdity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Finch. L. 84, 85.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Bract. _l._ 3. _tr._ 1. _c._ 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: _Nov._ 105. §. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: _Ff._ 32. 1. 23.]\r\n\r\nBY the word prerogative we usually understand that special\r\npre-eminence, which the king hath, over and above all other persons,\r\nand out of the ordinary course of the common law, in right of his\r\nregal dignity. It signifies, in it's etymology, (from _prae_ and\r\n_rogo_) something that is required or demanded before, or in\r\npreference to, all others. And hence it follows, that it must be in\r\nit's nature singular and eccentrical; that it can only be applied to\r\nthose rights and capacities which the king enjoys alone, in\r\ncontradistinction to others, and not to those which he enjoys in\r\ncommon with any of his subjects: for if once any one prerogative of\r\nthe crown could be held in common with the subject, it would cease to\r\nbe prerogative any longer. And therefore Finch[i] lays it down as a\r\nmaxim, that the prerogative is that law in case of the king, which is\r\nlaw in no case of the subject.\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: Finch. L. 85.]\r\n\r\nPREROGATIVES are either _direct_ or _incidental_. The _direct_ are\r\nsuch positive substantial parts of the royal character and authority,\r\nas are rooted in and spring from the king's political person,\r\nconsidered merely by itself, without reference to any other extrinsic\r\ncircumstance; as, the right of sending embassadors, of creating peers,\r\nand of making war or peace. But such prerogatives as are _incidental_\r\nbear always a relation to something else, distinct from the king's\r\nperson; and are indeed only exceptions, in favour of the crown, to\r\nthose general rules that are established for the rest of the\r\ncommunity: such as, that no costs shall be recovered against the king;\r\nthat the king can never be a joint-tenant; and that his debt shall be\r\npreferred before a debt to any of his subjects. These, and an infinite\r\nnumber of other instances, will better be understood, when we come\r\nregularly to consider the rules themselves, to which these incidental\r\nprerogatives are exceptions. And therefore we will at present only\r\ndwell upon the king's substantive or direct prerogatives.\r\n\r\nTHESE substantive or direct prerogatives may again be divided into\r\nthree kinds: being such as regard, first, the king's royal\r\n_character_; secondly, his royal _authority_; and, lastly, his royal\r\n_income_. These are necessary, to secure reverence to his person,\r\nobedience to his commands, and an affluent supply for the ordinary\r\nexpenses of government; without all of which it is impossible to\r\nmaintain the executive power in due independence and vigour. Yet, in\r\nevery branch of this large and extensive dominion, our free\r\nconstitution has interposed such seasonable checks and restrictions,\r\nas may curb it from trampling on those liberties, which it was meant\r\nto secure and establish. The enormous weight of prerogative (if left\r\nto itself, as in arbitrary government it is) spreads havoc and\r\ndestruction among all the inferior movements: but, when balanced and\r\nbridled (as with us) by it's proper counterpoise, timely and\r\njudiciously applied, it's operations are then equable and regular, it\r\ninvigorates the whole machine, and enables every part to answer the\r\nend of it's construction.\r\n\r\nIN the present chapter we shall only consider the two first of these\r\ndivisions, which relate to the king's political _character_ and\r\n_authority_; or, in other words, his _dignity_ and regal _power_; to\r\nwhich last the name of prerogative is frequently narrowed and\r\nconfined. The other division, which forms the royal _revenue_, will\r\nrequire a distinct examination; according to the known distribution of\r\nthe feodal writers, who distinguish the royal prerogatives into the\r\n_majora_ and _minora regalia_, in the latter of which classes the\r\nrights of the revenue are ranked. For, to use their own words,\r\n\"_majora regalia imperii praeeminentiam spectant; minora vero ad\r\ncommodum pecuniarium immediate attinent; et haec proprie fiscalia\r\nsunt, et ad jus fisci pertinent_[k].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: _Peregrin. de jure fisc._ _l._ 1. _c._ i. _num._ 9.]\r\n\r\nFIRST, then, of the royal dignity. Under every monarchical\r\nestablishment, it is necessary to distinguish the prince from his\r\nsubjects, not only by the outward pomp and decorations of majesty, but\r\nalso by ascribing to him certain qualities, as inherent in his royal\r\ncapacity, distinct from and superior to those of any other individual\r\nin the nation. For, though a philosophical mind will consider the\r\nroyal person merely as one man appointed by mutual consent to preside\r\nover many others, and will pay him that reverence and duty which the\r\nprinciples of society demand, yet the mass of mankind will be apt to\r\ngrow insolent and refractory, if taught to consider their prince as a\r\nman of no greater perfection than themselves. The law therefore\r\nascribes to the king, in his high political character, not only large\r\npowers and emoluments which form his prerogative and revenue, but\r\nlikewise certain attributes of a great and transcendent nature; by\r\nwhich the people are led to consider him in the light of a superior\r\nbeing, and to pay him that awful respect, which may enable him with\r\ngreater ease to carry on the business of government. This is what I\r\nunderstand by the royal dignity, the several branches of which we will\r\nnow proceed to examine.\r\n\r\nI. AND, first, the law ascribes to the king the attribute of\r\n_sovereignty_, or pre-eminence. \"_Rex est vicarius_,\" says Bracton[l],\r\n\"_et minister Dei in terra: omnis quidem sub eo est, et ipse sub\r\nnullo, nisi tantum sub Deo._\" He is said to have _imperial_ dignity,\r\nand in charters before the conquest is frequently stiled _basileus_\r\nand _imperator_, the titles respectively assumed by the emperors of\r\nthe east and west[m]. His realm is declared to be an _empire_, and his\r\ncrown imperial, by many acts of parliament, particularly the statutes\r\n24 Hen. VIII. c. 12. and 25 Hen. VIII. c. 28; which at the same time\r\ndeclare the king to be the supreme head of the realm in matters both\r\ncivil and ecclesiastical, and of consequence inferior to no man upon\r\nearth, dependent on no man, accountable to no man. Formerly there\r\nprevailed a ridiculous notion, propagated by the German and Italian\r\ncivilians, that an emperor could do many things which a king could\r\nnot, (as the creation of notaries and the like) and that all kings\r\nwere in some degree subordinate and subject to the emperor of Germany\r\nor Rome. The meaning therefore of the legislature, when it uses these\r\nterms of _empire_ and _imperial_, and applies them to the realm of\r\nEngland, is only to assert that our king is equally sovereign and\r\nindependent within these his dominions, as any emperor is in his\r\nempire; and owes no kind of subjection to any other potentate upon\r\nearth. Hence it is, that no suit or action can be brought against the\r\nking, even in civil matters, because no court can have jurisdiction\r\nover him. For all jurisdiction implies superiority of power: authority\r\nto try would be vain and idle, without an authority to redress; and\r\nthe sentence of a court would be contemptible, unless that court had\r\npower to command the execution of it: but who, says Finch[n], shall\r\ncommand the king? Hence it is likewise, that by law the person of the\r\nking is sacred, even though the measures pursued in his reign be\r\ncompletely tyrannical and arbitrary: for no jurisdiction upon earth\r\nhas power to try him in a criminal way; much less to condemn him to\r\npunishment. If any foreign jurisdiction had this power, as was\r\nformerly claimed by the pope, the independence of the kingdom would be\r\nno more: and, if such a power were vested in any domestic tribunal,\r\nthere would soon be an end of the constitution, by destroying the free\r\nagency of one of the constituent parts of the sovereign legislative\r\npower.\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: _l._ 1. _c._ 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: Seld. tit. of hon. 1. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: Finch. L. 83.]\r\n\r\nARE then, it may be asked, the subjects of England totally destitute\r\nof remedy, in case the crown should invade their rights, either by\r\nprivate injuries, or public oppressions? To this we may answer, that\r\nthe law has provided a remedy in both cases.\r\n\r\nAND, first, as to private injuries; if any person has, in point of\r\nproperty, a just demand upon the king, he must petition him in his\r\ncourt of chancery, where his chancellor will administer right as a\r\nmatter of grace, though not upon compulsion[o]. And this is entirely\r\nconsonant to what is laid down by the writers on natural law. \"A\r\nsubject, says Puffendorf[p], so long as he continues a subject, hath\r\nno way to _oblige_ his prince to give him his due, when he refuses it;\r\nthough no wise prince will ever refuse to stand to a lawful contract.\r\nAnd, if the prince gives the subject leave to enter an action against\r\nhim, upon such contract, in his own courts, the action itself proceeds\r\nrather upon natural equity, than upon the municipal laws.\" For the end\r\nof such action is not to _compel_ the prince to observe the contract,\r\nbut to _persuade_ him. And, as to personal wrongs; it is well observed\r\nby Mr Locke[q], \"the harm which the sovereign can do in his own person\r\nnot being likely to happen often, nor to extend itself far; nor being\r\nable by his single strength to subvert the laws, nor oppress the body\r\nof the people, (should any prince have so much weakness and ill nature\r\nas to endeavour to do it)--the inconveniency therefore of some\r\nparticular mischiefs, that may happen sometimes, when a heady prince\r\ncomes to the throne, are well recompensed by the peace of the public\r\nand security of the government, in the person of the chief magistrate\r\nbeing thus set out of the reach of danger.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: Finch. L. 255.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: Law of N. and N. l. 8. c. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: on Gov. p. 2. §. 205.]\r\n\r\nNEXT, as to cases of ordinary public oppression, where the vitals of\r\nthe constitution are not attacked, the law hath also assigned a\r\nremedy. For, as a king cannot misuse his power, without the advice of\r\nevil counsellors, and the assistance of wicked ministers, these men\r\nmay be examined and punished. The constitution has therefore provided,\r\nby means of indictments, and parliamentary impeachments, that no man\r\nshall dare to assist the crown in contradiction to the laws of the\r\nland. But it is at the same time a maxim in those laws, that the king\r\nhimself can do no wrong; since it would be a great weakness and\r\nabsurdity in any system of positive law, to define any possible wrong,\r\nwithout any possible redress.\r\n\r\nFOR, as to such public oppressions as tend to dissolve the\r\nconstitution, and subvert the fundamentals of government, they are\r\ncases which the law will not, out of decency, suppose; being incapable\r\nof distrusting those, whom it has invested with any part of the\r\nsupreme power; since such distrust would render the exercise of that\r\npower precarious and impracticable. For, whereever [Transcriber's\r\nNote: wherever] the law expresses it's distrust of abuse of power, it\r\nalways vests a superior coercive authority in some other hand to\r\ncorrect it; the very notion of which destroys the idea of sovereignty.\r\nIf therefore (for example) the two houses of parliament, or either of\r\nthem, had avowedly a right to animadvert on the king, or each other,\r\nor if the king had a right to animadvert on either of the houses, that\r\nbranch of the legislature, so subject to animadversion, would\r\ninstantly cease to be part of the supreme power; the ballance of the\r\nconstitution would be overturned; and that branch or branches, in\r\nwhich this jurisdiction resided, would be completely sovereign. The\r\nsupposition of _law_ therefore is, that neither the king nor either\r\nhouse of parliament (collectively taken) is capable of doing any\r\nwrong; since in such cases the law feels itself incapable of\r\nfurnishing any adequate remedy. For which reason all oppressions,\r\nwhich may happen to spring from any branch of the sovereign power,\r\nmust necessarily be out of the reach of any _stated rule_, or\r\n_express legal_ provision: but, if ever they unfortunately happen, the\r\nprudence of the times must provide new remedies upon new emergencies.\r\n\r\nINDEED, it is found by experience, that whenever the unconstitutional\r\noppressions, even of the sovereign power, advance with gigantic\r\nstrides and threaten desolation to a state, mankind will not be\r\nreasoned out of the feelings of humanity; nor will sacrifice their\r\nliberty by a scrupulous adherence to those political maxims, which\r\nwere originally established to preserve it. And therefore, though the\r\npositive laws are silent, experience will furnish us with a very\r\nremarkable case, wherein nature and reason prevailed. When king James\r\nthe second invaded the fundamental constitution of the realm, the\r\nconvention declared an abdication, whereby the throne was rendered\r\nvacant, which induced a new settlement of the crown. And so far as\r\nthis precedent leads, and no farther, we may now be allowed to lay\r\ndown the _law_ of redress against public oppression. If therefore any\r\nfuture prince should endeavour to subvert the constitution by breaking\r\nthe original contract between king and people, should violate the\r\nfundamental laws, and should withdraw himself out of the kingdom; we\r\nare now authorized to declare that this conjunction of circumstances\r\nwould amount to an abdication, and the throne would be thereby vacant.\r\nBut it is not for us to say, that any one, or two, of these\r\ningredients would amount to such a situation; for there our precedent\r\nwould fail us. In these therefore, or other circumstances, which a\r\nfertile imagination may furnish, since both law and history are\r\nsilent, it becomes us to be silent too; leaving to future generations,\r\nwhenever necessity and the safety of the whole shall require it, the\r\nexertion of those inherent (though latent) powers of society, which no\r\nclimate, no time, no constitution, no contract, can ever destroy or\r\ndiminish.\r\n\r\nII. BESIDES the attribute of sovereignty, the law also ascribes to the\r\nking, in his political capacity, absolute _perfection_. The king can\r\ndo no wrong. Which antient and fundamental maxim is not to be\r\nunderstood, as if every thing transacted by the government was of\r\ncourse just and lawful, but means only two things. First, that\r\nwhatever is exceptionable in the conduct of public affairs is not to\r\nbe imputed to the king, nor is he answerable for it personally to his\r\npeople: for this doctrine would totally destroy that constitutional\r\nindependence of the crown, which is necessary for the balance of\r\npower, in our free and active, and therefore compounded, constitution.\r\nAnd, secondly, it means that the prerogative of the crown extends not\r\nto do any injury: it is created for the benefit of the people, and\r\ntherefore cannot be exerted to their prejudice[r].\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Plowd. 487.]\r\n\r\nTHE king, moreover, is not only incapable of _doing_ wrong, but even\r\nof _thinking_ wrong: he can never mean to do an improper thing: in him\r\nis no folly or weakness. And therefore, if the crown should be induced\r\nto grant any franchise or privilege to a subject contrary to reason,\r\nor in any wise prejudicial to the commonwealth, or a private person,\r\nthe law will not suppose the king to have meant either an unwise or an\r\ninjurious action, but declares that the king was deceived in his\r\ngrant; and thereupon such grant is rendered void, merely upon the\r\nfoundation of fraud and deception, either by or upon those agents,\r\nwhom the crown has thought proper to employ. For the law will not cast\r\nan imputation on that magistrate whom it entrusts with the executive\r\npower, as if he was capable of intentionally disregarding his trust:\r\nbut attributes to mere imposition (to which the most perfect of\r\nsublunary beings must still continue liable) those little\r\ninadvertencies, which, if charged on the will of the prince, might\r\nlessen him in the eyes of his subjects.\r\n\r\nYET still, notwithstanding this personal perfection, which the law\r\nattributes to the sovereign, the constitution has allowed a latitude\r\nof supposing the contrary, in respect to both houses of parliament;\r\neach of which, in it's turn, hath exerted the right of remonstrating\r\nand complaining to the king even of those acts of royalty, which are\r\nmost properly and personally his own; such as messages signed by\r\nhimself, and speeches delivered from the throne. And yet, such is the\r\nreverence which is paid to the royal person, that though the two\r\nhouses have an undoubted right to consider these acts of state in any\r\nlight whatever, and accordingly treat them in their addresses as\r\npersonally proceeding from the prince, yet, among themselves, (to\r\npreserve the more perfect decency, and for the greater freedom of\r\ndebate) they usually suppose them to flow from the advice of the\r\nadministration. But the privilege of canvassing thus freely the\r\npersonal acts of the sovereign (either directly, or even through the\r\nmedium of his reputed advisers) belongs to no individual, but is\r\nconfined to those august assemblies: and there too the objections must\r\nbe proposed with the utmost respect and deference. One member was sent\r\nto the tower[s], for suggesting that his majesty's answer to the\r\naddress of the commons contained \"high words, to fright the members\r\nout of their duty;\" and another[t], for saying that a part of the\r\nking's speech \"seemed rather to be calculated for the meridian of\r\nGermany than Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: Com. Journ. 18 Nov. 1685.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: Com. Journ. 4 Dec. 1717.]\r\n\r\nIN farther pursuance of this principle, the law also determines that\r\nin the king can be no negligence, or _laches_, and therefore no delay\r\nwill bar his right. _Nullum tempus occurrit regi_ is the standing\r\nmaxim upon all occasions: for the law intends that the king is always\r\nbusied for the public good, and therefore has not leisure to assert\r\nhis right within the times limited to subjects[u]. In the king also\r\ncan be no stain or corruption of blood: for if the heir to the crown\r\nwere attainted of treason or felony, and afterwards the crown should\r\ndescend to him, this would purge the attainder _ipso facto_[w]. And\r\ntherefore when Henry VII, who as earl of Richmond stood attainted,\r\ncame to the crown, it was not thought necessary to pass an act of\r\nparliament to reverse this attainder; because, as lord Bacon in his\r\nhistory of that prince informs us, it was agreed that the assumption\r\nof the crown had at once purged all attainders. Neither can the king\r\nin judgment of law, as king, ever be a minor or under age; and\r\ntherefore his royal grants and assents to acts of parliament are good,\r\nthough he has not in his natural capacity attained the legal age of\r\ntwenty one[x]. By a statute indeed, 28 Hen. VIII. c. 17. power was\r\ngiven to future kings to rescind and revoke all acts of parliament\r\nthat should be made while they were under the age of twenty four: but\r\nthis was repealed by the statute 1 Edw. VI. c. 11. so far as related\r\nto that prince; and both statutes are declared to be determined by 24\r\nGeo. II. c. 24. It hath also been usually thought prudent, when the\r\nheir apparent has been very young, to appoint a protector, guardian,\r\nor regent, for a limited time: but the very necessity of such\r\nextraordinary provision is sufficient to demonstrate the truth of that\r\nmaxim of the common law, that in the king is no minority; and\r\ntherefore he hath no legal guardian[y].\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: Finch. L. 82. Co. Litt. 90 _b._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: Finch. L. 82.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: Co. Litt. 43.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: The methods of appointing this guardian or regent have\r\nbeen so various, and the duration of his power so uncertain, that from\r\nthence alone it may be collected that his office is unknown to the\r\ncommon law; and therefore (as sir Edward Coke says, 4 Inst. 58.) the\r\nsurest way is to have him made by authority of the great council in\r\nparliament. The earl of Pembroke by his own authority assumed, in very\r\ntroublesome times, the regency of Henry III, who was then only nine\r\nyears old; but was declared of full age by the pope at seventeen,\r\nconfirmed the great charter at eighteen, and took upon him the\r\nadministration of the government at twenty. A guardian and council of\r\nregency were named for Edward III, by the parliament which deposed his\r\nfather; the young king being then fifteen, and not assuming the\r\ngovernment till three years after. When Richard II succeeded at the\r\nage of eleven, the duke of Lancaster took upon him the management of\r\nthe kingdom, till the parliament met, which appointed a nominal\r\ncouncil to assist him. Henry V on his death-bed named a regent and a\r\nguardian for his infant son Henry VI, then nine months old: but the\r\nparliament altered his disposition, and appointed a protector and\r\ncouncil, with a special limited authority. Both these princes remained\r\nin a state of pupillage till the age of twenty three. Edward V, at the\r\nage of thirteen, was recommended by his father to the care of the duke\r\nof Glocester; who was declared protector by the privy council. The\r\nstatutes 25 Hen. VIII. c. 12. and 28 Hen. VIII. c. 7. provided, that\r\nthe successor, if a male and under eighteen, or if a female and under\r\nsixteen, should be till such age in the governance of his or her\r\nnatural mother, (if approved by the king) and such other counsellors\r\nas his majesty should by will or otherwise appoint: and he accordingly\r\nappointed his sixteen executors to have the government of his son,\r\nEdward VI, and the kingdom; which executors elected the earl of\r\nHertford protector. The statute 24 Geo. II. c. 24. in case the crown\r\nshould descend to any of the children of Frederick late prince of\r\nWales under the age of eighteen, appoints the princess dowager;--and\r\nthat of 5 Geo. III. c. 27. in case of a like descent to any of his\r\npresent majesty's children, empowers the king to name either the\r\nqueen, the princess dowager, or any descendant of king George II\r\nresiding in this kingdom;--to be guardian and regent, till the\r\nsuccessor attains such age, assisted by a council of regency: the\r\npowers of them all being expressly defined and set down in the several\r\nacts.]\r\n\r\nIII. A THIRD attribute of the king's majesty is his _perpetuity_. The\r\nlaw ascribes to him, in his political capacity, an absolute\r\nimmortality. The king never dies. Henry, Edward, or George may die;\r\nbut the king survives them all. For immediately upon the decease of\r\nthe reigning prince in his natural capacity, his kingship or imperial\r\ndignity, by act of law, without any _interregnum_ or interval, is\r\nvested at once in his heir; who is, _eo instanti_, king to all intents\r\nand purposes. And so tender is the law of supposing even a possibility\r\nof his death, that his natural dissolution is generally called his\r\n_demise_; _dimissio regis, vel coronae_: an expression which signifies\r\nmerely a transfer of property; for, as is observed in Plowden[z], when\r\nwe say the demise of the crown, we mean only that in consequence of\r\nthe disunion of the king's body natural from his body politic, the\r\nkingdom is transferred or demised to his successor; and so the royal\r\ndignity remains perpetual. Thus too, when Edward the fourth, in the\r\ntenth year of his reign, was driven from his throne for a few months\r\nby the house of Lancaster, this temporary transfer of his dignity was\r\ndenominated his _demise_; and all process was held to be discontinued,\r\nas upon a natural death of the king[a].\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: Plowd. 177. 234.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: M. 49 Hen. VI. pl. 1-8.]\r\n\r\nWE are next to consider those branches of the royal prerogative, which\r\ninvest this our sovereign lord, thus all-perfect and immortal in his\r\nkingly capacity, with a number of authorities and powers; in the\r\nexertion whereof consists the executive part of government. This is\r\nwisely placed in a single hand by the British constitution, for the\r\nsake of unanimity, strength and dispatch. Were it placed in many\r\nhands, it would be subject to many wills: many wills, if disunited and\r\ndrawing different ways, create weakness in a government: and to unite\r\nthose several wills, and reduce them to one, is a work of more time\r\nand delay than the exigencies of state will afford. The king of\r\nEngland is therefore not only the chief, but properly the sole,\r\nmagistrate of the nation; all others acting by commission from, and in\r\ndue subordination to him: in like manner as, upon the great revolution\r\nin the Roman state, all the powers of the antient magistracy of the\r\ncommonwealth were concentred in the new emperor; so that, as\r\nGravina[b] expresses it, \"_in ejus unius persona veteris reipublicae\r\nvis atque majestas per cumulatas magistratuum potestates\r\nexprimebatur_.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: _Orig._ 1. §. 105.]\r\n\r\nAFTER what has been premised in this chapter, I shall not (I trust) be\r\nconsidered as an advocate for arbitrary power, when I lay it down as a\r\nprinciple, that in the exertion of lawful prerogative, the king is and\r\nought to be absolute; that is, so far absolute, that there is no legal\r\nauthority that can either delay or resist him. He may reject what\r\nbills, may make what treaties, may coin what money, may create what\r\npeers, may pardon what offences he pleases: unless where the\r\nconstitution hath expressly, or by evident consequence, laid down some\r\nexception or boundary; declaring, that thus far the prerogative shall\r\ngo and no farther. For otherwise the power of the crown would indeed\r\nbe but a name and a shadow, insufficient for the ends of government,\r\nif, where it's jurisdiction is clearly established and allowed, any\r\nman or body of men were permitted to disobey it, in the ordinary\r\ncourse of law: I say, in the _ordinary_ course of law; for I do not\r\nnow speak of those _extraordinary_ recourses to first principles,\r\nwhich are necessary when the contracts of society are in danger of\r\ndissolution, and the law proves too weak a defence against the\r\nviolence of fraud or oppression. And yet the want of attending to this\r\nobvious distinction has occasioned these doctrines, of absolute power\r\nin the prince and of national resistance by the people, to be much\r\nmisunderstood and perverted by the advocates for slavery on the one\r\nhand, and the demagogues of faction on the other. The former,\r\nobserving the absolute sovereignty and transcendent dominion of the\r\ncrown laid down (as it certainly is) most strongly and emphatically\r\nin our lawbooks, as well as our homilies, have denied that any case\r\ncan be excepted from so general and positive a rule; forgetting how\r\nimpossible it is, in any practical system of laws, to point out\r\nbeforehand those eccentrical remedies, which the sudden emergence of\r\nnational distress may dictate, and which that alone can justify. On\r\nthe other hand, over-zealous republicans, feeling the absurdity of\r\nunlimited passive obedience, have fancifully (or sometimes factiously)\r\ngone over to the other extreme: and, because resistance is justifiable\r\nto the person of the prince when the being of the state is endangered,\r\nand the public voice proclaims such resistance necessary, they have\r\ntherefore allowed to every individual the right of determining this\r\nexpedience, and of employing private force to resist even private\r\noppression. A doctrine productive of anarchy, and (in consequence)\r\nequally fatal to civil liberty as tyranny itself. For civil liberty,\r\nrightly understood, consists in protecting the rights of individuals\r\nby the united force of society: society cannot be maintained, and of\r\ncourse can exert no protection, without obedience to some sovereign\r\npower: and obedience is an empty name, if every individual has a right\r\nto decide how far he himself shall obey.\r\n\r\nIN the exertion therefore of those prerogatives, which the law has\r\ngiven him, the king is irresistible and absolute, according to the\r\nforms of the constitution. And yet, if the consequence of that\r\nexertion be manifestly to the grievance or dishonour of the kingdom,\r\nthe parliament will call his advisers to a just and severe account.\r\nFor prerogative consisting (as Mr Locke[c] has well defined it) in the\r\ndiscretionary power of acting for the public good, where the positive\r\nlaws are silent, if that discretionary power be abused to the public\r\ndetriment, such prerogative is exerted in an unconstitutional manner.\r\nThus the king may make a treaty with a foreign state, which shall\r\nirrevocably bind the nation; and yet, when such treaties have been\r\njudged pernicious, impeachments have pursued those ministers, by whose\r\nagency or advice they were concluded.\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: on Gov. 2. §. 166.]\r\n\r\nTHE prerogatives of the crown (in the sense under which we are now\r\nconsidering them) respect either this nation's intercourse with\r\nforeign nations, or it's own domestic government and civil polity.\r\n\r\nWITH regard to foreign concerns, the king is the delegate or\r\nrepresentative of his people. It is impossible that the individuals of\r\na state, in their collective capacity, can transact the affairs of\r\nthat state with another community equally numerous as themselves.\r\nUnanimity must be wanting to their measures, and strength to the\r\nexecution of their counsels. In the king therefore, as in a center,\r\nall the rays of his people are united, and form by that union a\r\nconsistency, splendor, and power, that make him feared and respected\r\nby foreign potentates; who would scruple to enter into any\r\nengagements, that must afterwards be revised and ratified by a popular\r\nassembly. What is done by the royal authority, with regard to foreign\r\npowers, is the act of the whole nation: what is done without the\r\nking's concurrence is the act only of private men. And so far is this\r\npoint carried by our law, that it hath been held[d], that should all\r\nthe subjects of England make war with a king in league with the king\r\nof England, without the royal assent, such war is no breach of the\r\nleague. And, by the statute 2 Hen. V. c. 6. any subject committing\r\nacts of hostility upon any nation in league with the king, was\r\ndeclared to be guilty of high treason: and, though that act was\r\nrepealed by the statute 20 Hen. VI. c. 11. so far as relates to the\r\nmaking this offence high treason, yet still it remains a very great\r\noffence against the law of nations, and punishable by our laws, either\r\ncapitally or otherwise, according to the circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: 4 Inst. 152.]\r\n\r\nI. THE king therefore, considered as the representative of his people,\r\nhas the sole power of sending embassadors to foreign states, and\r\nreceiving embassadors at home. This may lead us into a short enquiry,\r\nhow far the municipal laws of England intermeddle with or protect the\r\nrights of these messengers from one potentate to another, whom we call\r\nembassadors.\r\n\r\nTHE rights, the powers, the duties, and the privileges of embassadors\r\nare determined by the law of nature and nations, and not by any\r\nmunicipal constitutions. For, as they represent the persons of their\r\nrespective masters, who owe no subjection to any laws but those of\r\ntheir own country, their actions are not subject to the control of the\r\nprivate law of that state, wherein they are appointed to reside. He\r\nthat is subject to the coercion of laws is necessarily dependent on\r\nthat power by whom those laws were made: but an embassador ought to be\r\nindependent of every power, except that by which he is sent; and of\r\nconsequence ought not to be subject to the mere municipal laws of that\r\nnation, wherein he is to exercise his functions. If he grossly\r\noffends, or makes an ill use of his character, he may be sent home and\r\naccused before his master[e]; who is bound either to do justice upon\r\nhim, or avow himself the accomplice of his crimes[f]. But there is\r\ngreat dispute among the writers on the laws of nations, whether this\r\nexemption of embassadors extends to all crimes, as well natural as\r\npositive; or whether it only extends to such as are _mala prohibita_,\r\nas coining, and not to those that are _mala in se_, as murder[g]. Our\r\nlaw seems to have formerly taken in the restriction, as well as the\r\ngeneral exemption. For it has been held, both by our common lawyers\r\nand civilians[h], that an embassador is privileged by the law of\r\nnature and nations; and yet, if he commits any offence against the law\r\nof reason and nature, he shall lose his privilege[i]: and that\r\ntherefore, if an embassador conspires the death of the king in whose\r\nland he is, he may be condemned and executed for treason; but if he\r\ncommits any other species of treason, it is otherwise, and he must be\r\nsent to his own kingdom[k]. And these positions seem to be built upon\r\ngood appearance of reason. For since, as we have formerly shewn, all\r\nmunicipal laws act in subordination to the primary law of nature, and,\r\nwhere they annex a punishment to natural crimes, are only declaratory\r\nof and auxiliary to that law; therefore to this natural, universal\r\nrule of justice embassadors, as well as other men, are subject in all\r\ncountries; and of consequence it is reasonable that wherever they\r\ntransgress it, there they shall be liable to make atonement[l]. But,\r\nhowever these principles might formerly obtain, the general practice\r\nof Europe seems now to have adopted the sentiments of the learned\r\nGrotius, that the security of embassadors is of more importance than\r\nthe punishment of a particular crime[m]. And therefore few, if any,\r\nexamples have happened within a century past, where an embassador has\r\nbeen punished for any offence, however atrocious in it's nature.\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: As was done with count Gyllenberg the Swedish minister to\r\nGreat Britain, _A.D._ 1716.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Sp. L. 26. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Van Leeuwen _in Ff._ 50. 7. 17. Barbeyrac's Puff. l. 8.\r\nc. 9. §. 9. & 17. Van Bynkershoek _de foro legator._ c. 17, 18, 19.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: 1 Roll. Rep. 175. 3 Bulstr. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: 4 Inst. 153.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: 1 Roll. Rep. 185.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: Foster's reports. 188.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: _Securitas legatorum utilitati quae ex poena est\r\npraeponderat._ _de jur. b. & p._ 2. 18. 4. 4.]\r\n\r\nIN respect to civil suits, all the foreign jurists agree, that neither\r\nan embassador, nor any of his train or _comites_, can be prosecuted\r\nfor any debt or contract in the courts of that kingdom wherein he is\r\nsent to reside. Yet sir Edward Coke maintains, that, if an embassador\r\nmake a contract which is good _jure gentium_, he shall answer for it\r\nhere[n]. And the truth is, we find no traces in our lawbooks of\r\nallowing any privilege to embassadors or their domestics, even in\r\ncivil suits, previous to the reign of queen Anne; when an embassador\r\nfrom Peter the great, czar of Muscovy, was actually arrested and taken\r\nout of his coach in London, in 1708, for debts which he had there\r\ncontracted. This the czar resented very highly, and demanded (we are\r\ntold) that the officers who made the arrest should be punished with\r\ndeath. But the queen (to the amazement of that despotic court)\r\ndirected her minister to inform him, \"that the law of England had not\r\nyet protected embassadors from the payment of their lawful debts; that\r\ntherefore the arrest was no offence by the laws; and that she could\r\ninflict no punishment upon any, the meanest, of her subjects, unless\r\nwarranted by the law of the land[o].\" To satisfy however the clamours\r\nof the foreign ministers (who made it a common cause) as well as to\r\nappease the wrath of Peter[p], a new statute was enacted by\r\nparliament[q], reciting the arrest which had been made, \"in contempt\r\nof the protection granted by her majesty, contrary to the law of\r\nnations, and in prejudice of the rights and privileges, which\r\nembassadors and other public ministers have at all times been thereby\r\npossessed of, and ought to be kept sacred and inviolable:\" wherefore\r\nit enacts, that for the future all process whereby the person of any\r\nembassador, or of his domestic or domestic servant, may be arrested,\r\nor his goods distreined or seised, shall be utterly null and void; and\r\nthe persons prosecuting, soliciting, or executing such process shall\r\nbe deemed violaters of the law of nations, and disturbers of the\r\npublic repose; and shall suffer such penalties and corporal punishment\r\nas the lord chancellor and the two chief justices, or any two of them,\r\nshall think fit. But it is expressly provided, that no trader, within\r\nthe description of the bankrupt laws, who shall be in the service of\r\nany embassador, shall be privileged or protected by this act; nor\r\nshall any one be punished for arresting an embassador's servant,\r\nunless his name be registred with the secretary of state, and by him\r\ntransmitted to the sheriffs of London and Middlesex. Exceptions, that\r\nare strictly conformable to the rights of embassadors[r], as observed\r\nin the most civilized countries. And, in consequence of this statute,\r\nthus enforcing the law of nations, these privileges are now usually\r\nallowed in the courts of common law[s].\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: 4 Inst. 153.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: Mod. Un. Hist. xxxv. 454.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: A copy of the act made upon this occasion, very elegantly\r\nengrossed and illuminated, was sent him to Moscow as a present.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: 7 Ann. c. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: _Saepe quaesitum est an comitum numero et jure habendi\r\nsunt, qui legatum comitantur, non ut instructior fiat legatio, sed\r\nunice ut lucro suo consulant, institores forte et mercatores. Et,\r\nquamvis hos saepe defenderint et comitum loco habere voluerint legati,\r\napparet tamen satis eo non pertinere, qui in legati legationisve\r\nofficio non sunt. Quum autem ea res nonnunquam turbas dederit, optimo\r\nexemplo in quibusdam aulis olim receptum fuit, ut legatus teneretur\r\nexhibere nomenclaturam comitum suorum._ Van Bynkersh. _c._ 15. _prope\r\nfinem_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: Fitzg. 200. Stra. 797.]\r\n\r\nII. IT is also the king's prerogative to make treaties, leagues, and\r\nalliances with foreign states and princes. For it is by the law of\r\nnations essential to the goodness of a league, that it be made by the\r\nsovereign power[t]; and then it is binding upon the whole community:\r\nand in England the sovereign power, _quoad hoc_, is vested in the\r\nperson of the king. Whatever contracts therefore he engages in, no\r\nother power in the kingdom can legally delay, resist, or annul. And\r\nyet, lest this plenitude of authority should be abused to the\r\ndetriment of the public, the constitution (as was hinted before) hath\r\nhere interposed a check, by the means of parliamentary impeachment,\r\nfor the punishment of such ministers as advise or conclude any treaty,\r\nwhich shall afterwards be judged to derogate from the honour and\r\ninterest of the nation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: Puff. L. of N. b. 8. c. 9. §. 6.]\r\n\r\nIII. UPON the same principle the king has also the sole prerogative of\r\nmaking war and peace. For it is held by all the writers on the law of\r\nnature and nations, that the right of making war, which by nature\r\nsubsisted in every individual, is given up by all private persons that\r\nenter into society, and is vested in the sovereign power[u]: and this\r\nright is given up not only by individuals, but even by the intire body\r\nof people, that are under the dominion of a sovereign. It would indeed\r\nbe extremely improper, that any number of subjects should have the\r\npower of binding the supreme magistrate, and putting him against his\r\nwill in a state of war. Whatever hostilities therefore may be\r\ncommitted by private citizens, the state ought not to be affected\r\nthereby; unless that should justify their proceedings, and thereby\r\nbecome partner in the guilt. Such unauthorized voluntiers in violence\r\nare not ranked among open enemies, but are treated like pirates and\r\nrobbers: according to that rule of the civil law[w]; _hostes hi sunt\r\nqui nobis, aut quibus nos, publice bellum decrevimus: caeteri latrones\r\naut praedones sunt_. And the reason which is given by Grotius[x], why\r\naccording to the law of nations a denunciation of war ought always to\r\nprecede the actual commencement of hostilities, is not so much that\r\nthe enemy may be put upon his guard, (which is matter rather of\r\nmagnanimity than right) but that it may be certainly clear that the\r\nwar is not undertaken by private persons, but by the will of the whole\r\ncommunity; whose right of willing is in this case transferred to the\r\nsupreme magistrate by the fundamental laws of society. So that, in\r\norder to make a war completely effectual, it is necessary with us in\r\nEngland that it be publicly declared and duly proclaimed by the king's\r\nauthority; and, then, all parts of both the contending nations, from\r\nthe highest to the lowest, are bound by it. And, wherever the right\r\nresides of beginning a national war, there also must reside the right\r\nof ending it, or the power of making peace. And the same check of\r\nparliamentary impeachment, for improper or inglorious conduct, in\r\nbeginning, conducting, or concluding a national war, is in general\r\nsufficient to restrain the ministers of the crown from a wanton or\r\ninjurious exertion of this great prerogative.\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: Puff. l. 8. c. 6. §. 8. and Barbeyr. _in loc._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: _Ff._ 50. 16. 118.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: _de jur. b. & p._ _l._ 3. _c._ 3. §. 11.]\r\n\r\nIV. BUT, as the delay of making war may sometimes be detrimental to\r\nindividuals who have suffered by depredations from foreign potentates,\r\nour laws have in some respect armed the subject with powers to impel\r\nthe prerogative; by directing the ministers of the crown to issue\r\nletters of marque and reprisal upon due demand: the prerogative of\r\ngranting which is nearly related to, and plainly derived from, that\r\nother of making war; this being indeed only an incomplete state of\r\nhostilities, and generally ending in a formal denunciation of war.\r\nThese letters are grantable by the law of nations[y], whenever the\r\nsubjects of one state are oppressed and injured by those of another;\r\nand justice is denied by that state to which the oppressor belongs. In\r\nthis case letters of marque and reprisal (words in themselves\r\nsynonimous and signifying a taking in return) may be obtained, in\r\norder to seise the bodies or goods of the subjects of the offending\r\nstate, until satisfaction be made, wherever they happen to be found.\r\nIndeed this custom of reprisals seems dictated by nature herself; and\r\naccordingly we find in the most antient times very notable instances\r\nof it[z]. But here the necessity is obvious of calling in the\r\nsovereign power, to determine when reprisals may be made; else every\r\nprivate sufferer would be a judge in his own cause. And, in pursuance\r\nof this principle, it is with us declared by the statute 4 Hen. V. c.\r\n7. that, if any subjects of the realm are oppressed in time of truce\r\nby any foreigners, the king will grant marque in due form, to all that\r\nfeel themselves grieved. Which form is thus directed to be observed:\r\nthe sufferer must first apply to the lord privy-seal, and he shall\r\nmake out letters of request under the privy seal; and, if, after such\r\nrequest of satisfaction made, the party required do not within\r\nconvenient time make due satisfaction or restitution to the party\r\ngrieved, the lord chancellor shall make him out letters of marque\r\nunder the great seal; and by virtue of these he may attack and seise\r\nthe property of the aggressor nation, without hazard of being\r\ncondemned as a robber or pirate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Grot. _de jur. b. & p._ _l._ 3. _c._ 2. §. 4 & 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: See the account given by Nestor, in the eleventh book of\r\nthe Iliad, of the reprisals made by himself on the Epeian nation; from\r\nwhom he took a multitude of cattle, as a satisfaction for a prize won\r\nat the Elian games by his father Neleus, and for debts due to many\r\nprivate subjects of the Pylian kingdom: out of which booty the king\r\ntook three hundred head of cattle for his own demand, and the rest\r\nwere equitably divided among the other creditors.]\r\n\r\nV. UPON exactly the same reason stands the prerogative of granting\r\nsafe-conducts, without which by the law of nations no member of one\r\nsociety has a right to intrude into another. And therefore Puffendorf\r\nvery justly resolves[a], that it is left in the power of all states,\r\nto take such measures about the admission of strangers, as they think\r\nconvenient; those being ever excepted who are driven on the coasts by\r\nnecessity, or by any cause that deserves pity or compassion. Great\r\ntenderness is shewn by our laws, not only to foreigners in distress\r\n(as will appear when we come to speak of shipwrecks) but with regard\r\nalso to the admission of strangers who come spontaneously. For so long\r\nas their nation continues at peace with ours, and they themselves\r\nbehave peaceably, they are under the king's protection; though liable\r\nto be sent home whenever the king sees occasion. But no subject of a\r\nnation at war with us can, by the law of nations, come into the realm,\r\nnor can travel himself upon the high seas, or send his goods and\r\nmerchandize from one place to another, without danger of being seized\r\nby our subjects, unless he has letters of safe-conduct; which by\r\ndivers antient statutes[b] must be granted under the king's great seal\r\nand inrolled in chancery, or else are of no effect: the king being\r\nsupposed the best judge of such emergencies, as may deserve exception\r\nfrom the general law of arms.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: Law of N. and N. b. 3. c. 3. §. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: 15 Hen. VI. c. 3. 18 Hen. VI. c. 8. 20 Hen. VI. c. 1.]\r\n\r\nINDEED the law of England, as a commercial country, pays a very\r\nparticular regard to foreign merchants in innumerable instances. One I\r\ncannot omit to mention: that by _magna carta_[c] it is provided, that\r\nall merchants (unless publickly prohibited beforehand) shall have safe\r\nconduct to depart from, to come into, to tarry in, and to go through\r\nEngland, for the exercise of merchandize, without any unreasonable\r\nimposts, except in time of war: and, if a war breaks out between us\r\nand their country, they shall be attached (if in England) without harm\r\nof body or goods, till the king or his chief justiciary be informed\r\nhow our merchants are treated in the land with which we are at war;\r\nand, if ours be secure in that land, they shall be secure in ours.\r\nThis seems to have been a common rule of equity among all the northern\r\nnations; for we learn from Stiernhook[d], that it was a maxim among\r\nthe Goths and Swedes, \"_quam legem exteri nobis posuere, eandem illis\r\nponemus_.\" But it is somewhat extraordinary, that it should have found\r\na place in _magna carta_, a mere interior treaty between the king and\r\nhis natural-born subjects; which occasions the learned Montesquieu to\r\nremark with a degree of admiration, \"that the English have made the\r\nprotection of _foreign_ merchants one of the articles of their\r\n_national_ liberty[e].\" But indeed it well justifies another\r\nobservation which he has made[f], \"that the English know better than\r\nany other people upon earth, how to value at the same time these three\r\ngreat advantages, religion, liberty, and commerce.\" Very different\r\nfrom the genius of the Roman people; who in their manners, their\r\nconstitution, and even in their laws, treated commerce as a\r\ndishonorable employment, and prohibited the exercise thereof to\r\npersons of birth, or rank, or fortune[g]: and equally different from\r\nthe bigotry of the canonists, who looked on trade as inconsistent with\r\nchristianity[h], and determined at the council of Melfi, under pope\r\nUrban II, _A.D._ 1090, that it was impossible with a safe conscience\r\nto exercise any traffic, or follow the profession of the law[i].\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: _c._ 30.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: _de jure Sueon._ _l._ 3. _c._ 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Sp.

But in\r\ndomestic affairs he is considered in a great variety of characters,\r\nand from thence there arises an abundant number of other prerogatives.\r\n\r\nI. FIRST, he is a constituent part of the supreme legislative power;\r\nand, as such, has the prerogative of rejecting such provisions in\r\nparliament, as he judges improper to be passed. The expediency of\r\nwhich constitution has before been evinced at large[k]. I shall only\r\nfarther remark, that the king is not bound by any act of parliament,\r\nunless he be named therein by special and particular words. The most\r\ngeneral words that can be devised (\"any person or persons, bodies\r\npolitic, or corporate, _&c._\") affect not him in the least, if they\r\nmay tend to restrain or diminish any of his rights or interests[l].\r\nFor it would be of most mischievous consequence to the public, if the\r\nstrength of the executive power were liable to be curtailed without\r\nit's own express consent, by constructions and implications of the\r\nsubject. Yet where an act of parliament is expressly made for the\r\npreservation of public rights and the suppression of public wrongs,\r\nand does not interfere with the established rights of the crown, it is\r\nsaid to be binding as well upon the king as upon the subject[m]: and,\r\nlikewise, the king may take the benefit of any particular act, though\r\nhe be not especially named[n].\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: ch. 2. pag. 149.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: 11 Rep. 74 _b._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: 11 Rep. 71.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: 7 Rep. 32.]\r\n\r\nII. THE king is considered, in the next place, as the generalissimo,\r\nor the first in military command, within the kingdom. The great end of\r\nsociety is to protect the weakness of individuals by the united\r\nstrength of the community: and the principal use of government is to\r\ndirect that united strength in the best and most effectual manner, to\r\nanswer the end proposed. Monarchical government is allowed to be the\r\nfittest of any for this purpose: it follows therefore, from the very\r\nend of it's institution, that in a monarchy the military power must be\r\ntrusted in the hands of the prince.\r\n\r\nIN this capacity therefore, of general of the kingdom, the king has\r\nthe sole power of raising and regulating fleets and armies. Of the\r\nmanner in which they are raised and regulated I shall speak more, when\r\nI come to consider the military state. We are now only to consider the\r\nprerogative of enlisting and of governing them: which indeed was\r\ndisputed and claimed, contrary to all reason and precedent, by the\r\nlong parliament of king Charles I; but, upon the restoration of his\r\nson, was solemnly declared by the statute 13 Car. II. c. 6. to be in\r\nthe king alone: for that the sole supreme government and command of\r\nthe militia within all his majesty's realms and dominions, and of all\r\nforces by sea and land, and of all forts and places of strength, ever\r\nwas and is the undoubted right of his majesty, and his royal\r\npredecessors, kings and queens of England; and that both or either\r\nhouse of parliament cannot, nor ought to, pretend to the same.\r\n\r\nTHIS statute, it is obvious to observe, extends not only to fleets and\r\narmies, but also to forts, and other places of strength, within the\r\nrealm; the sole prerogative as well of erecting, as manning and\r\ngoverning of which, belongs to the king in his capacity of general of\r\nthe kingdom[o]: and all lands were formerly subject to a tax, for\r\nbuilding of castles wherever the king thought proper. This was one of\r\nthe three things, from contributing to the performance of which no\r\nlands were exempted; and therefore called by our Saxon ancestors the\r\n_trinoda necessitas: sc. pontis reparatio, arcis constructio, et\r\nexpeditio contra hostem_[p]. And this they were called upon to do so\r\noften, that, as sir Edward Coke from M. Paris assures us[q], there\r\nwere in the time of Henry II 1115 castles subsisting in England. The\r\ninconvenience of which, when granted out to private subjects, the\r\nlordly barons of those times, was severely felt by the whole kingdom;\r\nfor, as William of Newbury remarks in the reign of king Stephen,\r\n\"_erant in Anglia quodammodo tot reges vel potius tyranni, quot domini\r\ncastellorum_:\" but it was felt by none more sensibly than by two\r\nsucceeding princes, king John and king Henry III. And therefore, the\r\ngreatest part of them being demolished in the barons' wars, the kings\r\nof after times have been very cautious of suffering them to be rebuilt\r\nin a fortified manner: and sir Edward Coke lays it down[r], that no\r\nsubject can build a castle, or house of strength imbatteled, or other\r\nfortress defensible, without the licence of the king; for the danger\r\nwhich might ensue, if every man at his pleasure might do it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: 2 Inst. 30.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: Cowel's interpr. _tit. castellorum operatio_. Seld. _Jan.\r\nAngl._ 1. 42.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: 2 Inst. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: 1 Inst. 5.]\r\n\r\nTO this branch of the prerogative may be referred the power vested in\r\nhis majesty, by statutes 12 Car. II. c. 4. and 29 Geo. II. c. 16. of\r\nprohibiting the exportation of arms or ammunition out of this kingdom,\r\nunder severe penalties: and likewise the right which the king has,\r\nwhenever he sees proper, of confining his subjects to stay within the\r\nrealm, or of recalling them when beyond the seas. By the common\r\nlaw[s], every man may go out of the realm for whatever cause he\r\npleaseth, without obtaining the king's leave; provided he is under no\r\ninjunction of staying at home: (which liberty was expressly declared\r\nin king John's great charter, though left out in that of Henry III)\r\nbut, because that every man ought of right to defend the king and his\r\nrealm, therefore the king at his pleasure may command him by his writ\r\nthat he go not beyond the seas, or out of the realm without licence;\r\nand if he do the contrary, he shall be punished for disobeying the\r\nking's command. Some persons there antiently were, that, by reason of\r\ntheir stations, were under a perpetual prohibition of going abroad\r\nwithout licence obtained; among which were reckoned all peers, on\r\naccount of their being counsellors of the crown; all knights, who were\r\nbound to defend the kingdom from invasions; all ecclesiastics, who\r\nwere expressly confined by cap. 4. of the constitutions of Clarendon,\r\non account of their attachment in the times of popery to the see of\r\nRome; all archers and other artificers, lest they should instruct\r\nforeigners to rival us in their several trades and manufactures. This\r\nwas law in the times of Britton[t], who wrote in the reign of Edward\r\nI: and sir Edward Coke[u] gives us many instances to this effect in\r\nthe time of Edward III. In the succeeding reign the affair of\r\ntravelling wore a very different aspect: an act of parliament being\r\nmade[w], forbidding all persons whatever to go abroad without licence;\r\n_except_ only the lords and other great men of the realm; and true and\r\nnotable merchants; and the king's soldiers. But this act was repealed\r\nby the statute 4 Jac. I. c. 1. And at present every body has, or at\r\nleast assumes, the liberty of going abroad when he pleases. Yet\r\nundoubtedly if the king, by writ of _ne exeat regnum_, under his great\r\nseal or privy seal, thinks proper to prohibit him from so doing; or if\r\nthe king sends a writ to any man, when abroad, commanding his return;\r\nand in either case the subject disobeys; it is a high contempt of the\r\nking's prerogative, for which the offender's lands shall be seised\r\ntill he return; and then he is liable to fine and imprisonment[x].\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: F.N.B. 85.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: c. 123.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: 3 Inst. 175.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: 5 Ric. II. c. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: 1 Hawk. P.C. 22.]\r\n\r\nIII. ANOTHER capacity, in which the king is considered in domestic\r\naffairs, is as the fountain of justice and general conservator of the\r\npeace of the kingdom. By the fountain of justice the law does not mean\r\nthe _author_ or _original_, but only the _distributor_. Justice is not\r\nderived from the king, as from his _free gift_; but he is the steward\r\nof the public, to dispense it to whom it is _due_[y]. He is not the\r\nspring, but the reservoir; from whence right and equity are conducted,\r\nby a thousand chanels, to every individual. The original power of\r\njudicature, by the fundamental principles of society, is lodged in the\r\nsociety at large: but as it would be impracticable to render complete\r\njustice to every individual, by the people in their collective\r\ncapacity, therefore every nation has committed that power to certain\r\nselect magistrates, who with more ease and expedition can hear and\r\ndetermine complaints; and in England this authority has immemorially\r\nbeen exercised by the king or his substitutes. He therefore has alone\r\nthe right of erecting courts of judicature: for, though the\r\nconstitution of the kingdom hath entrusted him with the whole\r\nexecutive power of the laws, it is impossible, as well as improper,\r\nthat he should personally carry into execution this great and\r\nextensive trust: it is consequently necessary, that courts should be\r\nerected, to assist him in executing this power; and equally necessary,\r\nthat, if erected, they should be erected by his authority. And hence\r\nit is, that all jurisdictions of courts are either mediately or\r\nimmediately derived from the crown, their proceedings run generally in\r\nthe king's name, they pass under his seal, and are executed by his\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: _Ad hoc autem creatus est et electus, ut justitiam faciat\r\nuniversis._ Bract. _l._ 3. _tr._ 1. _c._ 9.]\r\n\r\nIT is probable, and almost certain, that in very early times, before\r\nour constitution arrived at it's full perfection, our kings in person\r\noften heard and determined causes between party and party. But at\r\npresent, by the long and uniform usage of many ages, our kings have\r\ndelegated their whole judicial power to the judges of their several\r\ncourts; which are the grand depositary of the fundamental laws of the\r\nkingdom, and have gained a known and stated jurisdiction, regulated by\r\ncertain and established rules, which the crown itself cannot now alter\r\nbut by act of parliament[z]. And, in order to maintain both the\r\ndignity and independence of the judges in the superior courts, it is\r\nenacted by the statute 13 W. III. c. 2. that their commissions shall\r\nbe made (not, as formerly, _durante bene placito_, but) _quamdiu bene\r\nse gesserint_, and their salaries ascertained and established; but\r\nthat it may be lawful to remove them on the address of both houses of\r\nparliament. And now, by the noble improvements of that law in the\r\nstatute of 1 Geo. III. c. 23. enacted at the earnest recommendation of\r\nthe king himself from the throne, the judges are continued in their\r\noffices during their good behaviour, notwithstanding any demise of the\r\ncrown (which was formerly held[a] immediately to vacate their seats)\r\nand their full salaries are absolutely secured to them during the\r\ncontinuance of their commissions: his majesty having been pleased to\r\ndeclare, that \"he looked upon the independence and uprightness of the\r\njudges, as essential to the impartial administration of justice; as\r\none of the best securities of the rights and liberties of his\r\nsubjects; and as most conducive to the honour of the crown[b].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: 2 Hawk. P.C. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: Ld Raym. 747.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Com. Journ. 3 Mar. 1761.]\r\n\r\nIN criminal proceedings, or prosecutions for offences, it would still\r\nbe a higher absurdity, if the king personally sate in judgment;\r\nbecause in regard to these he appears in another capacity, that of\r\n_prosecutor_. All offences are either against the king's peace, or his\r\ncrown and dignity; and are so laid in every indictment. For, though in\r\ntheir consequences they generally seem (except in the case of treason\r\nand a very few others) to be rather offences against the kingdom than\r\nthe king; yet, as the public, which is an invisible body, has\r\ndelegated all it's power and rights, with regard to the execution of\r\nthe laws, to one visible magistrate, all affronts to that power, and\r\nbreaches of those rights, are immediately offences against him, to\r\nwhom they are so delegated by the public. He is therefore the proper\r\nperson to prosecute for all public offences and breaches of the peace,\r\nbeing the person injured in the eye of the law. And this notion was\r\ncarried so far in the old Gothic constitution, (wherein the king was\r\nbound by his coronation oath to conserve the peace) that in case of\r\nany forcible injury offered to the person of a fellow subject, the\r\noffender was accused of a kind of perjury, in having violated the\r\nking's coronation oath; _dicebatur fregisse juramentum regis\r\njuratum_[c]. And hence also arises another branch of the prerogative,\r\nthat of _pardoning_ offences; for it is reasonable that he only who is\r\ninjured should have the power of forgiving. And therefore, in\r\nparliamentary impeachments, the king has no prerogative of pardoning:\r\nbecause there the commons of Great Britain are in their own names the\r\nprosecutors, and not the crown; the offence being for the most part\r\navowedly taken to be done against the public. Of prosecutions and\r\npardons I shall treat more at large hereafter; and only mention them\r\nhere, in this cursory manner, to shew the constitutional grounds of\r\nthis power of the crown, and how regularly connected all the links are\r\nin this vast chain of prerogative.\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Stiernh. _de jure Goth._ _l._ 3. _c._ 3. A notion\r\nsomewhat similar to this may be found in the mirrour. c. 1. §. 5.]\r\n\r\nIN this distinct and separate existence of the judicial power, in a\r\npeculiar body of men, nominated indeed, but not removeable at\r\npleasure, by the crown, consists one main preservative of the public\r\nliberty; which cannot subsist long in any state, unless the\r\nadministration of common justice be in some degree separated both from\r\nthe legislative and also from the executive power. Were it joined with\r\nthe legislative, the life, liberty, and property, of the subject would\r\nbe in the hands of arbitrary judges, whose decisions would be then\r\nregulated only by their own opinions, and not by any fundamental\r\nprinciples of law; which, though legislators may depart from, yet\r\njudges are bound to observe. Were it joined with the executive, this\r\nunion might soon be an over-ballance for the legislative. For which\r\nreason, by the statute of 16 Car. I. c. 10. which abolished the court\r\nof star chamber, effectual care is taken to remove all judicial power\r\nout of the hands of the king's privy council; who, as then was evident\r\nfrom recent instances, might soon be inclined to pronounce that for\r\nlaw, which was most agreeable to the prince or his officers. Nothing\r\ntherefore is more to be avoided, in a free constitution, than uniting\r\nthe provinces of a judge and a minister of state. And indeed, that the\r\nabsolute power, claimed and exercised in a neighbouring nation, is\r\nmore tolerable than that of the eastern empires, is in great measure\r\nowing to their having vested the judicial power in their parliaments,\r\na body separate and distinct from both the legislative and executive:\r\nand, if ever that nation recovers it's former liberty, it will owe it\r\nto the efforts of those assemblies. In Turkey, where every thing is\r\ncentered in the sultan or his ministers, despotic power is in it's\r\nmeridian, and wears a more dreadful aspect.\r\n\r\nA CONSEQUENCE of this prerogative is the legal _ubiquity_ of the king.\r\nHis majesty, in the eye of the law, is always present in all his\r\ncourts, though he cannot personally distribute justice[d]. His judges\r\nare the mirror by which the king's image is reflected. It is the regal\r\noffice, and not the royal person, that is always present in court,\r\nalways ready to undertake prosecutions, or pronounce judgment, for the\r\nbenefit and protection of the subject. And from this ubiquity it\r\nfollows, that the king can never be nonsuit[e]; for a nonsuit is the\r\ndesertion of the suit or action by the non-appearance of the plaintiff\r\nin court. For the same reason also, in the forms of legal proceedings,\r\nthe king is not said to appear _by his attorney_, as other men do; for\r\nhe always appears in contemplation of law in his own proper person[f].\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: Fortesc. c. 8. 2 Inst. 186.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Co. Litt. 139.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Finch. L. 81.]\r\n\r\nFROM the same original, of the king's being the fountain of justice,\r\nwe may also deduce the prerogative of issuing proclamations, which is\r\nvested in the king alone. These proclamations have then a binding\r\nforce, when (as Sir Edward Coke observes[g]) they are grounded upon\r\nand enforce the laws of the realm. For, though the making of laws is\r\nentirely the work of a distinct part, the legislative branch, of the\r\nsovereign power, yet the manner, time, and circumstances of putting\r\nthose laws in execution must frequently be left to the discretion of\r\nthe executive magistrate. And therefore his constitutions or edicts,\r\nconcerning these points, which we call proclamations, are binding upon\r\nthe subject, where they do not either contradict the old laws, or tend\r\nto establish new ones; but only enforce the execution of such laws as\r\nare already in being, in such manner as the king shall judge\r\nnecessary. Thus the established law is, that the king may prohibit any\r\nof his subjects from leaving the realm: a proclamation therefore\r\nforbidding this in general for three weeks, by laying an embargo upon\r\nall shipping in time of war[h], will be equally binding as an act of\r\nparliament, because founded upon a prior law. A proclamation for\r\ndisarming papists is also binding, being only in execution of what the\r\nlegislature has first ordained: but a proclamation for allowing arms\r\nto papists, or for disarming any protestant subjects, will not bind;\r\nbecause the first would be to assume a dispensing power, the latter a\r\nlegislative one; to the vesting of either of which in any single\r\nperson the laws of England are absolutely strangers. Indeed by the\r\nstatute 31 Hen. VIII. c. 8. it was enacted, that the king's\r\nproclamations should have the force of acts of parliament: a statute,\r\nwhich was calculated to introduce the most despotic tyranny; and which\r\nmust have proved fatal to the liberties of this kingdom, had it not\r\nbeen luckily repealed in the minority of his successor, about five\r\nyears after[i].\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: 3 Inst. 162.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: 4 Mod. 177, 179.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: Stat. 1 Edw. VI. c. 12.]\r\n\r\nIV. THE king is likewise the fountain of honour, of office, and of\r\nprivilege: and this in a different sense from that wherein he is\r\nstiled the fountain of justice; for here he is really the parent of\r\nthem. It is impossible that government can be maintained without a\r\ndue subordination of rank; that the people may know and distinguish\r\nsuch as are set over them, in order to yield them their due respect\r\nand obedience; and also that the officers themselves, being encouraged\r\nby emulation and the hopes of superiority, may the better discharge\r\ntheir functions: and the law supposes, that no one can be so good a\r\njudge of their several merits and services, as the king himself who\r\nemploys them. It has therefore intrusted with him the sole power of\r\nconferring dignities and honours, in confidence that he will bestow\r\nthem upon none, but such as deserve them. And therefore all degrees of\r\nnobility, of knighthood, and other titles, are received by immediate\r\ngrant from the crown: either expressed in writing, by writs or letters\r\npatent, as in the creations of peers and baronets; or by corporeal\r\ninvestiture, as in the creation of a simple knight.\r\n\r\nFROM the same principle also arises the prerogative of erecting and\r\ndisposing of offices: for honours and offices are in their nature\r\nconvertible and synonymous. All offices under the crown carry in the\r\neye of the law an honour along with them; because they imply a\r\nsuperiority of parts and abilities, being supposed to be always filled\r\nwith those that are most able to execute them. And, on the other hand,\r\nall honours in their original had duties or offices annexed to them:\r\nan earl, _comes_, was the conservator or governor of a county; and a\r\nknight, _miles_, was bound to attend the king in his wars. For the\r\nsame reason therefore that honours are in the disposal of the king,\r\noffices ought to be so likewise; and as the king may create new\r\ntitles, so may he create new offices: but with this restriction, that\r\nhe cannot create new offices with new fees annexed to them, nor annex\r\nnew fees to old offices; for this would be a tax upon the subject,\r\nwhich cannot be imposed but by act of parliament[k]. Wherefore, in 13\r\nHen. IV, a new office being created by the king's letters patent for\r\nmeasuring cloths, with a new fee for the same, the letters patent\r\nwere, on account of the new fee, revoked and declared void in\r\nparliament.\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: 2 Inst. 533.]\r\n\r\nUPON the same, or a like reason, the king has also the prerogative of\r\nconferring privileges upon private persons. Such as granting place or\r\nprecedence to any of his subjects, as shall seem good to his royal\r\nwisdom[l]: or such as converting aliens, or persons born out of the\r\nking's dominions, into denizens; whereby some very considerable\r\nprivileges of natural-born subjects are conferred upon them. Such also\r\nis the prerogative of erecting corporations; whereby a number of\r\nprivate persons are united and knit together, and enjoy many\r\nliberties, powers, and immunities in their politic capacity, which\r\nthey were utterly incapable of in their natural. Of aliens, denizens,\r\nnatural-born, and naturalized subjects, I shall speak more largely in\r\na subsequent chapter; as also of corporations at the close of this\r\nbook of our commentaries. I now only mention them incidentally, in\r\norder to remark the king's prerogative of making them; which is\r\ngrounded upon this foundation, that the king, having the sole\r\nadministration of the government in his hands, is the best and the\r\nonly judge, in what capacities, with what privileges, and under what\r\ndistinctions, his people are the best qualified to serve, and to act\r\nunder him. A principle, which was carried so far by the imperial law,\r\nthat it was determined to be the crime of sacrilege, even to doubt\r\nwhether the prince had appointed proper officers in the state[m].\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: 4 Inst. 361.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: _Disputare de principali judicio non oportet: sacrilegii\r\nenim instar est, dubitare an is dignus sit; quem elegerit imperator._\r\n_C._ 9. 29. 3.]\r\n\r\nV. ANOTHER light in which the laws of England consider the king with\r\nregard to domestic concerns, is as the arbiter of commerce. By\r\ncommerce, I at present mean domestic commerce only. It would lead me\r\ninto too large a field, if I were to attempt, to enter upon the nature\r\nof foreign trade, it's privileges, regulations, and restrictions; and\r\nwould be also quite beside the purpose of these commentaries, which\r\nare confined to the laws of England. Whereas no municipal laws can be\r\nsufficient to order and determine the very extensive and complicated\r\naffairs of traffic and merchandize; neither can they have a proper\r\nauthority for this purpose. For as these are transactions carried on\r\nbetween the subjects of independent states, the municipal laws of one\r\nwill not be regarded by the other. For which reason the affairs of\r\ncommerce are regulated by a law of their own, called the law merchant\r\nor _lex mercatoria_, which all nations agree in and take notice of.\r\nAnd in particular the law of England does in many cases refer itself\r\nto it, and leaves the causes of merchants to be tried by their own\r\npeculiar customs; and that often even in matters relating to inland\r\ntrade, as for instance with regard to the drawing, the acceptance, and\r\nthe transfer, of bills of exchange[n].\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: Co. Litt. 172. Ld Raym. 181. 1542.]\r\n\r\nWITH us in England, the king's prerogative, so far as it relates to\r\nmere domestic commerce, will fall principally under the following\r\narticles:\r\n\r\nFIRST, the establishment of public marts, or places of buying and\r\nselling, such as markets and fairs, with the tolls thereunto\r\nbelonging. These can only be set up by virtue of the king's grant, or\r\nby long and immemorial usage and prescription, which presupposes such\r\na grant[o]. The limitation of these public resorts, to such time and\r\nsuch place as may be most convenient for the neighbourhood, forms a\r\npart of oeconomics, or domestic polity; which, considering the kingdom\r\nas a large family, and the king as the master of it, he clearly has a\r\nright to dispose and order as he pleases.\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: 2 Inst. 220.]\r\n\r\nSECONDLY, the regulation of weights and measures. These, for the\r\nadvantage of the public, ought to be universally the same throughout\r\nthe kingdom; being the general criterions which reduce all things to\r\nthe same or an equivalent value. But, as weight and measure are things\r\nin their nature arbitrary and uncertain, it is therefore expedient\r\nthat they be reduced to some fixed rule or standard: which standard it\r\nis impossible to fix by any written law or oral proclamation; for no\r\nman can, by words only, give another an adequate idea of a foot-rule,\r\nor a pound-weight. It is therefore necessary to have recourse to some\r\nvisible, palpable, material standard; by forming a comparison with\r\nwhich, all weights and measures may be reduced to one uniform size:\r\nand the prerogative of fixing this standard, our antient law vested in\r\nthe crown; as in Normandy it belonged to the duke[p]. This standard\r\nwas originally kept at Winchester: and we find in the laws of king\r\nEdgar[q], near a century before the conquest, an injunction that the\r\none measure, which was kept at Winchester, should be observed\r\nthroughout the realm. Most nations have regulated the standard of\r\nmeasures of length by comparison with the parts of the human body; as\r\nthe palm, the hand, the span, the foot, the cubit, the ell, (_ulna_,\r\nor arm) the pace, and the fathom. But, as these are of different\r\ndimensions in men of different proportions, our antient historians[r]\r\ninform us, that a new standard of longitudinal measure was ascertained\r\nby king Henry the first; who commanded that the _ulna_ or antient ell,\r\nwhich answers to the modern yard, should be made of the exact length\r\nof his own arm. And, one standard of measures of length being gained,\r\nall others are easily derived from thence; those of greater length by\r\nmultiplying, those of less by subdividing, that original standard.\r\nThus, by the statute called _compositio ulnarum et perticarum_, five\r\nyards and an half make a perch; and the yard is subdivided into three\r\nfeet, and each foot into twelve inches; which inches will be each of\r\nthe length of three grains of barley. Superficial measures are derived\r\nby squaring those of length; and measures of capacity by cubing them.\r\nThe standard of weights was originally taken from corns of wheat,\r\nwhence the lowest denomination of weights we have is still called a\r\ngrain; thirty two of which are directed, by the statute called\r\n_compositio mensurarum_, to compose a penny weight, whereof twenty\r\nmake an ounce, twelve ounces a pound, and so upwards. And upon these\r\nprinciples the first standards were made; which, being originally so\r\nfixed by the crown, their subsequent regulations have been generally\r\nmade by the king in parliament. Thus, under king Richard I, in his\r\nparliament holden at Westminster, _A.D._ 1197, it was ordained that\r\nthere shall be only one weight and one measure throughout the kingdom,\r\nand that the custody of the assise or standard of weights and measures\r\nshall be committed to certain persons in every city and borough[s];\r\nfrom whence the antient office of the king's aulnager seems to have\r\nbeen derived, whose duty it was, for a certain fee, to measure all\r\ncloths made for sale, till the office was abolished by the statute 11\r\n& 12 W. III. c. 20. In king John's time this ordinance of king Richard\r\nwas frequently dispensed with for money[t]; which occasioned a\r\nprovision to be made for inforcing it, in the great charters of king\r\nJohn and his son[u]. These original standards were called _pondus\r\nregis_[w], and _mensura domini regis_[x]; and are directed by a\r\nvariety of subsequent statutes to be kept in the exchequer, and all\r\nweights and measures to be made conformable thereto[y]. But, as sir\r\nEdward Coke observes[z], though this hath so often by authority of\r\nparliament been enacted, yet it could never be effected; so forcible\r\nis custom with the multitude, when it hath gotten an head.\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: _Gr. Coustum._ _c._ 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: _cap._ 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: William of Malmsb. _in vita Hen. I._ Spelm. _Hen. I. ap._\r\nWilkins. 299.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: Hoved. Matth.

II. c. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: 2 Inst. 41.]\r\n\r\nTHIRDLY, as money is the medium of commerce, it is the king's\r\nprerogative, as the arbiter of domestic commerce, to give it authority\r\nor make it current. Money is an universal medium, or common standard,\r\nby comparison with which the value of all merchandize may be\r\nascertained: or it is a sign, which represents the respective values\r\nof all commodities. Metals are well calculated for this sign, because\r\nthey are durable and are capable of many subdivisions: and a precious\r\nmetal is still better calculated for this purpose, because it is the\r\nmost portable. A metal is also the most proper for a common measure,\r\nbecause it can easily be reduced to the same standard in all nations:\r\nand every particular nation fixes on it it's own impression, that the\r\nweight and standard (wherein consists the intrinsic value) may both\r\nbe known by inspection only.\r\n\r\nAS the quantity of precious metals increases, that is, the more of\r\nthem there is extracted from the mine, this universal medium or common\r\nsign will sink in value, and grow less precious. Above a thousand\r\nmillions of bullion are calculated to have been imported into Europe\r\nfrom America within less than three centuries; and the quantity is\r\ndaily increasing. The consequence is, that more money must be given\r\nnow for the same commodity than was given an hundred years ago. And,\r\nif any accident was to diminish the quantity of gold and silver, their\r\nvalue would proportionably rise. A horse, that was formerly worth ten\r\npounds, is now perhaps worth twenty; and, by any failure of current\r\nspecie, the price may be reduced to what it was. Yet is the horse in\r\nreality neither dearer nor cheaper at one time than another: for, if\r\nthe metal which constitutes the coin was formerly twice as scarce as\r\nat present, the commodity was then as dear at half the price, as now\r\nit is at the whole.\r\n\r\nTHE coining of money is in all states the act of the sovereign power;\r\nfor the reason just mentioned, that it's value may be known on\r\ninspection. And with respect to coinage in general, there are three\r\nthings to be considered therein; the materials, the impression, and\r\nthe denomination.\r\n\r\nWITH regard to the materials, sir Edward Coke lays it down[a], that\r\nthe money of England must either be of gold or silver; and none other\r\nwas ever issued by the royal authority till 1672, when copper\r\nfarthings and half-pence were coined by king Charles the second, and\r\nordered by proclamation to be current in all payments, under the value\r\nof six-pence, and not otherwise. But this copper coin is not upon the\r\nsame footing with the other in many respects, particularly with regard\r\nto the offence of counterfeiting it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: 2 Inst. 577.]\r\n\r\nAS to the impression, the stamping thereof is the unquestionable\r\nprerogative of the crown: for, though divers bishops and monasteries\r\nhad formerly the privilege of coining money, yet, as sir Matthew Hale\r\nobserves[b], this was usually done by special grant from the king, or\r\nby prescription which supposes one; and therefore was derived from,\r\nand not in derogation of, the royal prerogative. Besides that they had\r\nonly the profit of the coinage, and not the power of instituting\r\neither the impression or denomination; but had usually the stamp sent\r\nthem from the exchequer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: 1 Hist. P.C. 191.]\r\n\r\nTHE denomination, or the value for which the coin is to pass current,\r\nis likewise in the breast of the king; and, if any unusual pieces are\r\ncoined, that value must be ascertained by proclamation. In order to\r\nfix the value, the weight, and the fineness of the metal are to be\r\ntaken into consideration together. When a given weight of gold or\r\nsilver is of a given fineness, it is then of the true standard, and\r\ncalled sterling metal; a name for which there are various reasons\r\ngiven[c], but none of them entirely satisfactory. And of this sterling\r\nmetal all the coin of the kingdom must be made by the statute 25 Edw.\r\nIII. c. 13. So that the king's prerogative seemeth not to extend to\r\nthe debasing or inhancing the value of the coin, below or above the\r\nsterling value[d]: though sir Matthew Hale[e] appears to be of another\r\nopinion. The king may also, by his proclamation, legitimate foreign\r\ncoin, and make it current here; declaring at what value it shall be\r\ntaken in payments[f]. But this, I apprehend, ought to be by comparison\r\nwith the standard of our own coin; otherwise the consent of parliament\r\nwill be necessary. There is at present no such legitimated money;\r\nPortugal coin being only current by private consent, so that any one\r\nwho pleases may refuse to take it in payment. The king may also at any\r\ntime decry, or cry down, any coin of the kingdom, and make it no\r\nlonger current[g].\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Spelm. Gloss. 203.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: 2 Inst. 577.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: 1 H.P.C. 194.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: _Ibid._ 197.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nVI. THE king is, lastly, considered by the laws of England as the head\r\nand supreme governor of the national church.\r\n\r\nTO enter into the reasons upon which this prerogative is founded is\r\nmatter rather of divinity than of law. I shall therefore only observe\r\nthat by statute 26 Hen. VIII. c. 1. (reciting that the king's majesty\r\njustly and rightfully is and ought to be the supreme head of the\r\nchurch of England; and so had been recognized by the clergy of this\r\nkingdom in their convocation) it is enacted, that the king shall be\r\nreputed the only supreme head in earth of the church of England, and\r\nshall have, annexed to the imperial crown of this realm, as well the\r\ntitles and stile thereof, as all jurisdictions, authorities, and\r\ncommodities, to the said dignity of supreme head of the church\r\nappertaining. And another statute to the same purport was made, 1\r\nEliz. c. 1.\r\n\r\nIN virtue of this authority the king convenes, prorogues, restrains,\r\nregulates, and dissolves all ecclesiastical synods or convocations.\r\nThis was an inherent prerogative of the crown, long before the time of\r\nHenry VIII, as appears by the statute 8 Hen. VI. c. 1. and the many\r\nauthors, both lawyers and historians, vouched by sir Edward Coke[h].\r\nSo that the statute 25 Hen. VIII. c. 19. which restrains the\r\nconvocation from making or putting in execution any canons repugnant\r\nto the king's prerogative, or the laws, customs, and statutes of the\r\nrealm, was merely declaratory of the old common law: that part of it\r\nonly being new, which makes the king's royal assent actually necessary\r\nto the validity of every canon. The convocation or ecclesiastical\r\nsynod, in England, differs considerably in it's constitution from the\r\nsynods of other christian kingdoms: those consisting wholly of\r\nbishops; whereas with us the convocation is the miniature of a\r\nparliament, wherein the archbishop presides with regal state; the\r\nupper house of bishops represents the house of lords; and the lower\r\nhouse, composed of representatives of the several dioceses at large,\r\nand of each particular chapter therein, resembles the house of\r\ncommons with it's knights of the shire and burgesses[i]. This\r\nconstitution is said to be owing to the policy of Edward I; who\r\nthereby at one and the same time let in the inferior clergy to the\r\nprivilege of forming ecclesiastical canons, (which before they had\r\nnot) and also introduced a method of taxing ecclesiastical benefices,\r\nby consent of convocation[k].\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: 4 Inst. 322, 323.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: In the diet of Sweden, where the ecclesiastics form one\r\nof the branches of the legislature, the chamber of the clergy\r\nresembles the convocation of England. It is composed of the bishops\r\nand superintendants; and also of deputies, one of which is chosen by\r\nevery ten parishes or rural deanry. Mod. Un. Hist. xxxiii. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Gilb. hist. of exch. c. 4.]\r\n\r\nFROM this prerogative also of being the head of the church arises the\r\nking's right of nomination to vacant bishopricks, and certain other\r\necclesiastical preferments; which will better be considered when we\r\ncome to treat of the clergy. I shall only here observe, that this is\r\nnow done in consequence of the statute 25 Hen. VIII. c. 20.\r\n\r\nAS head of the church, the king is likewise the _dernier resort_ in\r\nall ecclesiastical causes; an appeal lying ultimately to him in\r\nchancery from the sentence of every ecclesiastical judge: which right\r\nwas restored to the crown by statute 25 Hen. VIII. c. 19. as will more\r\nfully be shewn hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE EIGHTH.\r\n\r\nOF THE KING'S REVENUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVING, in the preceding chapter, considered at large those branches\r\nof the king's prerogative, which contribute to his royal dignity, and\r\nconstitute the executive power of the government, we proceed now to\r\nexamine the king's _fiscal_ prerogatives, or such as regard his\r\n_revenue_; which the British constitution hath vested in the royal\r\nperson, in order to support his dignity and maintain his power: being\r\na portion which each subject contributes of his property, in order to\r\nsecure the remainder.\r\n\r\nTHIS revenue is either ordinary, or extraordinary. The king's ordinary\r\nrevenue is such, as has either subsisted time out of mind in the\r\ncrown; or else has been granted by parliament, by way of purchase or\r\nexchange for such of the king's inherent hereditary revenues, as were\r\nfound inconvenient to the subject.\r\n\r\nWHEN I say that it has subsisted time out of mind in the crown, I do\r\nnot mean that the king is at present in the actual possession of the\r\nwhole of this revenue. Much (nay, the greatest part) of it is at this\r\nday in the hands of subjects; to whom it has been granted out from\r\ntime to time by the kings of England: which has rendered the crown in\r\nsome measure dependent on the people for it's ordinary support and\r\nsubsistence. So that I must be obliged to recount, as part of the\r\nroyal revenue, what lords of manors and other subjects frequently\r\nlook upon to be their own absolute rights, because they are and have\r\nbeen vested in them and their ancestors for ages, though in reality\r\noriginally derived from the grants of our antient princes.\r\n\r\nI. THE first of the king's ordinary revenues, which I shall take\r\nnotice of, is of an ecclesiastical kind; (as are also the three\r\nsucceeding ones) viz. the custody of the temporalties of bishops; by\r\nwhich are meant all the lay revenues, lands, and tenements (in which\r\nis included his barony) which belong to an archbishop's or bishop's\r\nsee. And these upon the vacancy of the bishoprick are immediately the\r\nright of the king, as a consequence of his prerogative in church\r\nmatters; whereby he is considered as the founder of all\r\narchbishopricks and bishopricks, to whom during the vacancy they\r\nrevert. And for the same reason, before the dissolution of abbeys, the\r\nking had the custody of the temporalties of all such abbeys and\r\npriories as were of royal foundation (but not of those founded by\r\nsubjects) on the death of the abbot or prior[a]. Another reason may\r\nalso be given, why the policy of the law hath vested this custody in\r\nthe king; because, as the successor is not known, the lands and\r\npossessions of the see would be liable to spoil and devastation, if no\r\none had a property therein. Therefore the law has given the king, not\r\nthe temporalties themselves, but the _custody_ of the temporalties,\r\ntill such time as a successor is appointed; with power of taking to\r\nhimself all the intermediate profits, without any account to the\r\nsuccessor; and with the right of presenting (which the crown very\r\nfrequently exercises) to such benefices and other preferments as fall\r\nwithin the time of vacation[b]. This revenue is of so high a nature,\r\nthat it could not be granted out to a subject, before, or even after,\r\nit accrued: but now by the statute 14 Edw. III. st. 4. c. 4 & 5. the\r\nking may, after the vacancy, lease the temporalties to the dean and\r\nchapter; saving to himself all advowsons, escheats, and the like. Our\r\nantient kings, and particularly William Rufus, were not only\r\nremarkable for keeping the bishopricks a long time vacant, for the\r\nsake of enjoying the temporalties, but also committed horrible waste\r\non the woods and other parts of the estate; and, to crown all, would\r\nnever, when the see was filled up, restore to the bishop his\r\ntemporalties again, unless he purchased them at an exorbitant price.\r\nTo remedy which, king Henry the first[c] granted a charter at the\r\nbeginning of his reign, promising neither to sell, nor let to farm,\r\nnor take any thing from, the domains of the church, till the successor\r\nwas installed. And it was made one of the articles of the great\r\ncharter[d], that no waste should be committed in the temporalties of\r\nbishopricks, neither should the custody of them be sold. The same is\r\nordained by the statute of Westminster the first[e]; and the statute\r\n14 Edw. III. st. 4. c. 4. (which permits, as we have seen, a lease to\r\nthe dean and chapter) is still more explicit in prohibiting the other\r\nexactions. It was also a frequent abuse, that the king would for\r\ntrifling, or no causes, seise the temporalties of bishops, even during\r\ntheir lives, into his own hands: but this is guarded against by\r\nstatute 1 Edw. III. st. 2. c. 2.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: 2 Inst. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Stat. 17 Edw. II. c. 14. F.N.B. 32.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Matth. Paris.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: 9 Hen. III. c. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: 3 Edw. I. c. 21.]\r\n\r\nTHIS revenue of the king, which was formerly very considerable, is now\r\nby a customary indulgence almost reduced to nothing: for, at present,\r\nas soon as the new bishop is consecrated and confirmed, he usually\r\nreceives the restitution of his temporalties quite entire, and\r\nuntouched, from the king; and then, and not sooner, he has a fee\r\nsimple in his bishoprick, and may maintain an action for the same[f].\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Co. Litt. 67. 341.]\r\n\r\nII. THE king is entitled to a corody, as the law calls it, out of\r\nevery bishoprick: that is, to send one of his chaplains to be\r\nmaintained by the bishop, or to have a pension allowed him till the\r\nbishop promotes him to a benefice[g]. This is also in the nature of an\r\nacknowlegement to the king, as founder of the see; since he had\r\nformerly the same corody or pension from every abbey or priory of\r\nroyal foundation. It is, I apprehend, now fallen into total disuse;\r\nthough sir Matthew Hale says[h], that it is due of common right, and\r\nthat no prescription will discharge it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: F.N.B. 230.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Notes on F.N.B. above cited.]\r\n\r\nIII. THE king also (as was formerly observed[i]) is entitled to all\r\nthe tithes arising in extraparochial places[k]: though perhaps it may\r\nbe doubted how far this article, as well as the last, can be properly\r\nreckoned a part of the king's own royal revenue; since a corody\r\nsupports only his chaplains, and these extraparochial tithes are held\r\nunder an implied trust, that the king will distribute them for the\r\ngood of the clergy in general.\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: page 110.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: 2 Inst. 647.]\r\n\r\nIV. THE next branch consists in the first-fruits, and tenths, of all\r\nspiritual preferments in the kingdom; both of which I shall consider\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nTHESE were originally a part of the papal usurpations over the clergy\r\nof this kingdom; first introduced by Pandulph the pope's legate,\r\nduring the reigns of king John and Henry the third, in the see of\r\nNorwich; and afterwards attempted to be made universal by the popes\r\nClement V and John XXII, about the beginning of the fourteenth\r\ncentury. The first-fruits, _primitiae_, or _annates_, were the first\r\nyear's whole profits of the spiritual preferment, according to a rate\r\nor _valor_ made under the direction of pope Innocent IV by Walter\r\nbishop of Norwich in 38 Hen. III, and afterwards advanced in value by\r\ncommission from pope Nicholas the third, _A.D._ 1292, 20 Edw. I[l];\r\nwhich valuation of pope Nicholas is still preserved in the\r\nexchequer[m]. The tenths, or _decimae_, were the tenth part of the\r\nannual profit of each living by the same valuation; which was also\r\nclaimed by the holy see, under no better pretence than a strange\r\nmisapplication of that precept of the Levitical law, which directs[n],\r\n\"that the Levites should offer the tenth part of their tithe as a\r\nheave-offering to the Lord, and give it to Aaron the _high_ priest.\"\r\nBut this claim of the pope met with vigorous resistance from the\r\nEnglish parliament; and a variety of acts were passed to prevent and\r\nrestrain it, particularly the statute 6 Hen. IV. c. 1. which calls it\r\na horrible mischief and damnable custom. But the popish clergy,\r\nblindly devoted to the will of a foreign master, still kept it on\r\nfoot; sometimes more secretly, sometimes more openly and avowedly: so\r\nthat, in the reign of Henry VIII, it was computed, that in the compass\r\nof fifty years 800000 ducats had been sent to Rome for first-fruits\r\nonly. And, as the clergy expressed this willingness to contribute so\r\nmuch of their income to the head of the church, it was thought proper\r\n(when in the same reign the papal power was abolished, and the king\r\nwas declared the head of the church of England) to annex this revenue\r\nto the crown; which was done by statute 26 Hen. VIII. c. 3. (confirmed\r\nby statute 1 Eliz. c. 4.) and a new _valor beneficiorum_ was then\r\nmade, by which the clergy are at present rated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: F.N.B. 176.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: 3 Inst. 154.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: Numb. 18. 26.]\r\n\r\nBY these lastmentioned statutes all vicarages under ten pounds a year,\r\nand all rectories under ten marks, are discharged from the payment of\r\nfirst-fruits: and if, in such livings as continue chargeable with this\r\npayment, the incumbent lives but half a year, he shall pay only one\r\nquarter of his first-fruits; if but one whole year, then half of them;\r\nif a year and half, three quarters; and if two years, then the whole;\r\nand not otherwise. Likewise by the statute 27 Hen. VIII. c. 8. no\r\ntenths are to be paid for the first year, for then the first-fruits\r\nare due: and by other statutes of queen Anne, in the fifth and sixth\r\nyears of her reign, if a benefice be under fifty pounds _per annum_\r\nclear yearly value, it shall be discharged of the payment of\r\nfirst-fruits and tenths.\r\n\r\nTHUS the richer clergy, being, by the criminal bigotry of their popish\r\npredecessors, subjected at first to a foreign exaction, were\r\nafterwards, when that yoke was shaken off, liable to a like\r\nmisapplication of their revenues, through the rapacious disposition of\r\nthe then reigning monarch: till at length the piety of queen Anne\r\nrestored to the church what had been thus indirectly taken from it.\r\nThis she did, not by remitting the tenths and first-fruits entirely;\r\nbut, in a spirit of the truest equity, by applying these superfluities\r\nof the larger benefices to make up the deficiences of the smaller. And\r\nto this end she granted her royal charter, which was confirmed by the\r\nstatute 2 Ann. c. 11. whereby all the revenue of first-fruits and\r\ntenths is vested in trustees for ever, to form a perpetual fund for\r\nthe augmentation of poor livings. This is usually called queen Anne's\r\nbounty; which has been still farther regulated by subsequent statutes,\r\ntoo numerous here to recite.\r\n\r\nV. THE next branch of the king's ordinary revenue (which, as well as\r\nthe subsequent branches, is of a lay or temporal nature) consists in\r\nthe rents and profits of the demesne lands of the crown. These demesne\r\nlands, _terrae dominicales regis_, being either the share reserved to\r\nthe crown at the original distribution of landed property, or such as\r\ncame to it afterwards by forfeitures or other means, were antiently\r\nvery large and extensive; comprizing divers manors, honors, and\r\nlordships; the tenants of which had very peculiar privileges, as will\r\nbe shewn in the second book of these commentaries, when we speak of\r\nthe tenure in antient demesne. At present they are contracted within a\r\nvery narrow compass, having been almost entirely granted away to\r\nprivate subjects. This has occasioned the parliament frequently to\r\ninterpose; and, particularly, after king William III had greatly\r\nimpoverished the crown, an act passed[o], whereby all future grants or\r\nleases from the crown for any longer term than thirty one years or\r\nthree lives are declared to be void; except with regard to houses,\r\nwhich may be granted for fifty years. And no reversionary lease can be\r\nmade, so as to exceed, together with the estate in being, the same\r\nterm of three lives or thirty one years: that is, where there is a\r\nsubsisting lease, of which there are twenty years still to come, the\r\nking cannot grant a future interest, to commence after the expiration\r\nof the former, for any longer term than eleven years. The tenant must\r\nalso be made liable to be punished for committing waste; and the\r\nusual rent must be reserved, or, where there has usually been no rent,\r\none third of the clear yearly value[p]. The misfortune is, that this\r\nact was made too late, after almost every valuable possession of the\r\ncrown had been granted away for ever, or else upon very long leases;\r\nbut may be of benefit to posterity, when those leases come to expire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: 1 Ann. st. 1. c. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: In like manner, by the civil law, the inheritances or\r\n_fundi patrimoniales_ of the imperial crown could not be alienated,\r\nbut only let to farm. _Cod._ _l._ 11. _t._ 61.]\r\n\r\nVI. HITHER might have been referred the advantages which were used to\r\narise to the king from the profits of his military tenures, to which\r\nmost lands in the kingdom were subject, till the statute 12 Car. II.\r\nc. 24. which in great measure abolished them all: the explication of\r\nthe nature of which tenures, must be referred to the second book of\r\nthese commentaries. Hither also might have been referred the\r\nprofitable prerogative of purveyance and pre-emption: which was a\r\nright enjoyed by the crown of buying up provisions and other\r\nnecessaries, by the intervention of the king's purveyors, for the use\r\nof his royal houshold, at an appraised valuation, in preference to all\r\nothers, and even without consent of the owner; and also of forcibly\r\nimpressing the carriages and horses of the subject, to do the king's\r\nbusiness on the publick roads, in the conveyance of timber, baggage,\r\nand the like, however inconvenient to the proprietor, upon paying him\r\na settled price. A prerogative, which prevailed pretty generally\r\nthroughout Europe, during the scarcity of gold and silver, and the\r\nhigh valuation of money consequential thereupon. In those early times\r\nthe king's houshold (as well as those of inferior lords) were\r\nsupported by specific renders of corn, and other victuals, from the\r\ntenants of the respective demesnes; and there was also a continual\r\nmarket kept at the palace gate to furnish viands for the royal use[q].\r\nAnd this answered all purposes, in those ages of simplicity, so long\r\nas the king's court continued in any certain place. But when it\r\nremoved from one part of the kingdom to another (as was formerly very\r\nfrequently done) it was found necessary to send purveyors beforehand,\r\nto get together a sufficient quantity of provisions and other\r\nnecessaries for the houshold: and, lest the unusual demand should\r\nraise them to an exorbitant price, the powers beforementioned were\r\nvested in these purveyors; who in process of time very greatly abused\r\ntheir authority, and became a great oppression to the subject though\r\nof little advantage to the crown; ready money in open market (when the\r\nroyal residence was more permanent, and specie began to be plenty)\r\nbeing found upon experience to be the best proveditor of any.\r\nWherefore by degrees the powers of purveyance have declined, in\r\nforeign countries as well as our own; and particularly were abolished\r\nin Sweden by Gustavus Adolphus, toward the beginning of the last\r\ncentury[r]. And, with us in England, having fallen into disuse during\r\nthe suspension of monarchy, king Charles at his restoration consented,\r\nby the same statute, to resign intirely these branches of his revenue\r\nand power, for the ease and convenience of his subjects: and the\r\nparliament, in part of recompense, settled on him, his heirs, and\r\nsuccessors, for ever, the hereditary excise of fifteen pence _per_\r\nbarrel on all beer and ale sold in the kingdom, and a proportionable\r\nsum for certain other liquors. So that this hereditary excise, the\r\nnature of which shall be farther explained in the subsequent part of\r\nthis chapter, now forms the sixth branch of his majesty's ordinary\r\nrevenue.\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: 4 Inst. 273.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Mod. Un. Hist. xxxiii. 220.]\r\n\r\nVII. A SEVENTH branch might also be computed to have arisen from wine\r\nlicences; or the rents payable to the crown by such persons as are\r\nlicensed to sell wine by retale throughout England, except in a few\r\nprivileged places. These were first settled on the crown by the\r\nstatute 12 Car. II. c. 25. and, together with the hereditary excise,\r\nmade up the equivalent in value for the loss sustained by the\r\nprerogative in the abolition of the military tenures, and the right of\r\npre-emption and purveyance: but this revenue was abolished by the\r\nstatute 30 Geo. II. c. 19. and an annual sum of upwards of £7000 _per\r\nannum_, issuing out of the new stamp duties imposed on wine licences,\r\nwas settled on the crown in it's stead.\r\n\r\nVIII. AN eighth branch of the king's ordinary revenue is usually\r\nreckoned to consist in the profits arising from his forests. Forests\r\nare waste grounds belonging to the king, replenished with all manner\r\nof beasts of chase or venary; which are under the king's protection,\r\nfor the sake of his royal recreation and delight: and, to that end,\r\nand for preservation of the king's game, there are particular laws,\r\nprivileges, courts and officers belonging to the king's forests; all\r\nwhich will be, in their turns, explained in the subsequent books of\r\nthese commentaries. What we are now to consider are only the profits\r\narising to the king from hence; which consist principally in\r\namercements or fines levied for offences against the forest-laws. But\r\nas few, if any courts of this kind for levying amercements have been\r\nheld since 1632, 8 Car. I. and as, from the accounts given of the\r\nproceedings in that court by our histories and law books[s], nobody\r\nwould now wish to see them again revived, it is needless (at least in\r\nthis place) to pursue this enquiry any farther.\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: 1 Jones. 267-298.]\r\n\r\nIX. THE profits arising from the king's ordinary courts of justice\r\nmake a ninth branch of his revenue. And these consist not only in\r\nfines imposed upon offenders, forfeitures of recognizances, and\r\namercements levied upon defaulters; but also in certain fees due to\r\nthe crown in a variety of legal matters, as, for setting the great\r\nseal to charters, original writs, and other legal proceedings, and for\r\npermitting fines to be levied of lands in order to bar entails, or\r\notherwise to insure their title. As none of these can be done without\r\nthe immediate intervention of the king, by himself or his officers,\r\nthe law allows him certain perquisites and profits, as a recompense\r\nfor the trouble he undertakes for the public. These, in process of\r\ntime, have been almost all granted out to private persons, or else\r\nappropriated to certain particular uses: so that, though our\r\nlaw-proceedings are still loaded with their payment, very little of\r\nthem is now returned into the king's exchequer; for a part of whose\r\nroyal maintenance they were originally intended. All future grants of\r\nthem however, by the statute 1 Ann. st. 2. c. 7. are to endure for no\r\nlonger time than the prince's life who grants them.\r\n\r\nX. A TENTH branch of the king's ordinary revenue, said to be grounded\r\non the consideration of his guarding and protecting the seas from\r\npirates and robbers, is the right to _royal fish_, which are whale and\r\nsturgeon: and these, when either thrown ashore, or caught near the\r\ncoasts, are the property of the king, on account[t] of their superior\r\nexcellence. Indeed our ancestors seem to have entertained a very high\r\nnotion of the importance of this right; it being the prerogative of\r\nthe kings of Denmark and the dukes of Normandy[u]; and from one of\r\nthese it was probably derived to our princes. It is expressly claimed\r\nand allowed in the statute _de praerogativa regis_[w]: and the most\r\nantient treatises of law now extant make mention of it[x]; though they\r\nseem to have made a distinction between whale and sturgeon, as was\r\nincidentally observed in a former chapter[y].\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: Plowd. 315.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: Stiernh. _de jure Sueonum._ _l._ 2. _c._ 8. _Gr.\r\nCoustum._ _cap._ 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: 17 Edw. II. c. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: Bracton. _l._ 3. _c._ 3. Britton. _c._ 17. Fleta. _l._ 1.\r\n_c._ 45 & 46.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: ch. 4. pag. 216.]\r\n\r\nXI. ANOTHER maritime revenue, and founded partly upon the same reason,\r\nis that of shipwrecks; which are also declared to be the king's\r\nproperty by the same prerogative statute 17 Edw. II. c. 11. and were\r\nso, long before, at the common law. It is worthy observation, how\r\ngreatly the law of wrecks has been altered, and the rigour of it\r\ngradually softened, in favour of the distressed proprietors. Wreck, by\r\nthe antient common law, was where any ship was lost at sea, and the\r\ngoods or cargo were thrown upon the land; in which case these goods,\r\nso wrecked, were adjudged to belong to the king: for it was held,\r\nthat, by the loss of the ship, all property was gone out of the\r\noriginal owner[z]. But this was undoubtedly adding sorrow to sorrow,\r\nand was consonant neither to reason nor humanity. Wherefore it was\r\nfirst ordained by king Henry I, that if any person escaped alive out\r\nof the ship it should be no wreck[a]; and afterwards king Henry II, by\r\nhis charter[b], declared, that if on the coasts of either England,\r\nPoictou, Oleron, or Gascony, any ship should be distressed, and either\r\nman or beast should escape or be found therein alive, the goods should\r\nremain to the owners, if they claimed them within three months; but\r\notherwise should be esteemed a wreck, and should belong to the king,\r\nor other lord of the franchise. This was again confirmed with\r\nimprovements by king Richard the first, who, in the second year of his\r\nreign[c], not only established these concessions, by ordaining that\r\nthe owner, if he was shipwrecked and escaped, \"_omnes res suas liberas\r\net quietas haberet_,\" but also, that, if he perished, his children, or\r\nin default of them his brethren and sisters, should retain the\r\nproperty; and, in default of brother or sister, then the goods should\r\nremain to the king[d]. And the law, so long after as the reign of\r\nHenry III, seems still to have been guided by the same equitable\r\nprovisions. For then if a dog (for instance) escaped, by which the\r\nowner might be discovered, or if any certain mark were set on the\r\ngoods, by which they might be known again, it was held to be no\r\nwreck[e]. And this is certainly most agreeable to reason; the rational\r\nclaim of the king being only founded upon this, that the true owner\r\ncannot be ascertained. But afterwards, in the statute of Westminster\r\nthe first[f], the law is laid down more agreeable to the charter of\r\nking Henry the second: and upon that statute hath stood the legal\r\ndoctrine of wrecks to the present time. It enacts, that if any live\r\nthing escape (a man, a cat, or a dog; which, as in Bracton, are only\r\nput for examples[g],) in this case, and, as it seems, in this case\r\nonly, it is clearly not a legal wreck: but the sheriff of the county\r\nis bound to keep the goods a year and a day (as in France for one\r\nyear, agreeably to the maritime laws of Oleron[h], and in Holland for\r\na year and an half) that if any man can prove a property in them,\r\neither in his own right or by right of representation[i], they shall\r\nbe restored to him without delay; but, if no such property be proved\r\nwithin that time, they then shall be the king's. If the goods are of a\r\nperishable nature, the sheriff may sell them, and the money shall be\r\nliable in their stead[k]. This revenue of wrecks is frequently granted\r\nout to lords of manors, as a royal franchise; and if any one be thus\r\nentitled to wrecks in his own land, and the king's goods are wrecked\r\nthereon, the king may claim them at any time, even after the year and\r\nday[l].\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: Dr & St. d. 2. c. 51.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: Spelm. _Cod. apud_ Wilkins. 305.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: 26 May, _A.D._ 1174. 1 Rym. _Foed._ 36.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Rog. Hoved. _in Ric. I_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: In like manner Constantine the great, finding that by the\r\nimperial law the revenue of wrecks was given to the prince's treasury\r\nor _fiscus_, restrained it by an edict (_Cod._ 11. 5. 1.) and ordered\r\nthem to remain to the owners; adding this humane expostulation, \"_Quod\r\nenim jus habet fiscus in aliena calamitate, ut de re tam luctuosa\r\ncompendium sectetur?_\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Bract. _l._ 3. _c._ 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: 3 Edw. I. c. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Flet. 1. _c._ 44. 2 Inst. 167.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: §. 28.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: 2 Inst. 168.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Plowd. 166.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: 2 Inst. 168. Bro. Abr. _tit. Wreck_.]\r\n\r\nIT is to be observed, that in order to constitute a legal _wreck_, the\r\ngoods must come to land. If they continue at sea, the law\r\ndistinguishes them by the barbarous and uncouth appellations of\r\n_jetsam_, _flotsam_, and _ligan_. Jetsam is where goods are cast into\r\nthe sea, and there sink and remain under water: flotsam is where they\r\ncontinue swimming on the surface of the waves: ligan is where they are\r\nsunk in the sea, but tied to a cork or buoy, in order to be found\r\nagain[m]. These are also the king's, if no owner appears to claim\r\nthem; but, if any owner appears, he is entitled to recover the\r\npossession. For even if they be cast overboard, without any mark or\r\nbuoy, in order to lighten the ship, the owner is not by this act of\r\nnecessity construed to have renounced his property[n]: much less can\r\nthings ligan be supposed to be abandoned, since the owner has done all\r\nin his power, to assert and retain his property. These three are\r\ntherefore accounted so far a distinct thing from the former, that by\r\nthe king's grant to a man of wrecks, things jetsam, flotsam, and ligan\r\nwill not pass[o].\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: 5 Rep. 106.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: _Quae enim res in tempestate, levandae navis causa,\r\nejiciuntur, hac dominorum permanent. Quia palam est, eas non eo animo\r\nejici, quod quis habere nolit._ _Inst._ 2. 1. §. 48.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: 5 Rep. 108.]\r\n\r\nWRECKS, in their legal acceptation, are at present not very frequent:\r\nit rarely happening that every living creature on board perishes; and\r\nif any should survive, it is a very great chance, since the\r\nimprovement of commerce, navigation, and correspondence, but the owner\r\nwill be able to assert his property within the year and day limited by\r\nlaw. And in order to preserve this property entire for him, and if\r\npossible to prevent wrecks at all, our laws have made many very humane\r\nregulations; in a spirit quite opposite to those savage laws, which\r\nformerly prevailed in all the northern regions of Europe, and a few\r\nyears ago were still laid to subsist on the coasts of the Baltic sea,\r\npermitting the inhabitants to seize on whatever they could get as\r\nlawful prize; or, as an author of their own expresses it, \"_in\r\nnaufragorum miseria et calamitate tanquam vultures ad praedam\r\ncurrere_[p].\" For by the statute 2 Edw. III. c. 13. if any ship be\r\nlost on the shore, and the goods come to land (so as it be not legal\r\nwreck) they shall be presently delivered to the merchants, they paying\r\nonly a reasonable reward to those that saved and preserved them, which\r\nis intitled _salvage_. Also by the common law, if any persons (other\r\nthan the sheriff) take any goods so cast on shore, which are not legal\r\nwreck, the owners might have a commission to enquire and find them\r\nout, and compel them to make restitution[q]. And by statute 12 Ann.\r\nst. 2. c. 18. confirmed by 4 Geo. I. c. 12. in order to assist the\r\ndistressed, and prevent the scandalous illegal practices on some of\r\nour sea coasts, (too similar to those on the Baltic) it is enacted,\r\nthat all head-officers and others of towns near the sea shall, upon\r\napplication made to them, summon as many hands as are necessary, and\r\nsend them to the relief of any ship in distress, on forfeiture of\r\n100_l._ and, in case of assistance given, salvage shall be paid by the\r\nowners, to be assessed by three neighbouring justices. All persons\r\nthat secrete any goods shall forfeit their treble value: and if they\r\nwilfully do any act whereby the ship is lost or destroyed, by making\r\nholes in her, stealing her pumps, or otherwise, they are guilty of\r\nfelony, without benefit of clergy. Lastly, by the statute 26 Geo. II.\r\nc. 19. plundering any vessel either in distress, or wrecked, and\r\nwhether any living creature be on board or not, (for, whether wreck or\r\notherwise, it is clearly not the property of the populace) such\r\nplundering, I say, or preventing the escape of any person that\r\nendeavors to save his life, or wounding him with intent to destroy\r\nhim, or putting out false lights in order to bring any vessel into\r\ndanger, are all declared to be capital felonies; in like manner as the\r\ndestroying trees, steeples, or other stated seamarks, is punished by\r\nthe statute 8 Eliz. c. 13. with a forfeiture of 200_l._ Moreover, by\r\nthe statute of George II, pilfering any goods cast ashore is declared\r\nto be petty larceny; and many other salutary regulations are made, for\r\nthe more effectually preserving ships of any nation in distress[r].\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: Stiernh. _de jure Sueon._ _l._ 3. _c._ 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: F.N.B. 112.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: By the civil law, to destroy persons shipwrecked, or\r\nprevent their saving the ship, is capital. And to steal even a plank\r\nfrom a vessel in distress, or wrecked, makes the party liable to\r\nanswer for the whole ship and cargo. (_Ff._ 47. 9. 3.) The laws also\r\nof the Wisigoths, and the most early Neapolitan constitutions,\r\npunished with the utmost severity all those who neglected to assist\r\nany ship in distress, or plundered any goods cast on shore.\r\n(Lindenbrog. _Cod. LL. antiq._ 146. 715.)]\r\n\r\nXII. A TWELFTH branch of the royal revenue, the right to mines, has\r\nit's original from the king's prerogative of coinage, in order to\r\nsupply him with materials: and therefore those mines, which are\r\nproperly royal, and to which the king is entitled when found, are only\r\nthose of silver and gold[s]. By the old common law, if gold or silver\r\nbe found in mines of base metal, according to the opinion of some the\r\nwhole was a royal mine, and belonged to the king; though others held\r\nthat it only did so, if the quantity of gold or silver was of greater\r\nvalue than the quantity of base metal[t]. But now by the statutes 1 W.\r\n& M. st. 1. c. 30. and 5 W. & M. c. 6. this difference is made\r\nimmaterial; it being enacted, that no mines of copper, tin, iron, or\r\nlead, shall be looked upon as royal mines, notwithstanding gold or\r\nsilver may be extracted from them in any quantities: but that the\r\nking, or persons claiming royal mines under his authority, may have\r\nthe ore, (other than tin-ore in the counties of Devon and Cornwall)\r\npaying for the same a price stated in the act. This was an extremely\r\nreasonable law: for now private owners are not discouraged from\r\nworking mines, through a fear that they may be claimed as royal ones;\r\nneither does the king depart from the just rights of his revenue,\r\nsince he may have all the precious metal contained in the ore, paying\r\nno more for it than the value of the base metal which it is supposed\r\nto be; to which base metal the land-owner is by reason and law\r\nentitled.\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: 2 Inst. 577.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: Plowd. 566.]\r\n\r\nXIII. TO the same original may in part be referred the revenue of\r\ntreasure-trove (derived from the French word, _trover_, to find)\r\ncalled in Latin _thesaurus inventus_, which is where any money or\r\ncoin, gold, silver, plate, or bullion, is found hidden _in_ the earth,\r\nor other private place, the owner thereof being unknown; in which case\r\nthe treasure belongs to the king: but if he that hid it be known, or\r\nafterwards found out, the owner and not the king is entitled to it[u].\r\nAlso if it be found in the sea, or _upon_ the earth, it doth not\r\nbelong to the king, but the finder, if no owner appears[w]. So that it\r\nseems it is the _hiding_, not the _abandoning_ of it, that gives the\r\nking a property: Bracton[x] defining it, in the words of the\r\ncivilians, to be \"_vetus depositio pecuniae_.\" This difference clearly\r\narises from the different intentions, which the law implies in the\r\nowner. A man, that hides his treasure in a secret place, evidently\r\ndoes not mean to relinquish his property; but reserves a right of\r\nclaiming it again, when he sees occasion; and, if he dies and the\r\nsecret also dies with him, the law gives it the king, in part of his\r\nroyal revenue. But a man that scatters his treasure into the sea, or\r\nupon the public surface of the earth, is construed to have absolutely\r\nabandoned his property, and returned it into the common stock, without\r\nany intention of reclaiming it; and therefore it belongs, as in a\r\nstate of nature, to the first occupant, or finder; unless the owner\r\nappear and assert his right, which then proves that the loss was by\r\naccident, and not with an intent to renounce his property.\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: 3 Inst. 132. Dalt. Sheriffs. c. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: Britt. c. 17. Finch. L. 177.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: _l._ 3. _c._ 3. §. 4.]\r\n\r\nFORMERLY all treasure-trove belonged to the finder[y]; as was also the\r\nrule of the civil law[z]. Afterwards it was judged expedient for the\r\npurposes of the state, and particularly for the coinage, to allow part\r\nof what was so found to the king; which part was assigned to be all\r\n_hidden_ treasure; such as is _casually lost_ and unclaimed, and also\r\nsuch as is _designedly abandoned_, still remaining the right of the\r\nfortunate finder. And that the prince shall be entitled to this hidden\r\ntreasure is now grown to be, according to Grotius[a], \"_jus commune,\r\net quasi gentium_:\" for it is not only observed, he adds, in England,\r\nbut in Germany, France, Spain, and Denmark. The finding of deposited\r\ntreasure was much more frequent, and the treasures themselves more\r\nconsiderable, in the infancy of our constitution than at present. When\r\nthe Romans, and other inhabitants of the respective countries which\r\ncomposed their empire, were driven out by the northern nations, they\r\nconcealed their money under-ground; with a view of resorting to it\r\nagain when the heat of the irruption should be over, and the invaders\r\ndriven back to their desarts. But as this never happened, the\r\ntreasures were never claimed; and on the death of the owners the\r\nsecret also died along with them. The conquering generals, being aware\r\nof the value of these hidden mines, made it highly penal to secrete\r\nthem from the public service. In England therefore, as among the\r\nfeudists[b], the punishment of such as concealed from the king the\r\nfinding of hidden treasure was formerly no less than death; but now it\r\nis only fine and imprisonment[c].\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Bracton. _l._ 3. _c._ 3. 3 Inst. 133.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: _Ff._ 41. 1. 31.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: _de jur. b. & p._ _l._ 2. _c._ 8. §. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Glanv. _l._ 1. _c._ 2. Crag. 1. 16. 40.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: 3 Inst. 133.]\r\n\r\nXIV. WAIFS, _bona waviata_, are goods stolen, and waived or thrown\r\naway by the thief in his flight, for fear of being apprehended. These\r\nare given to the king by the law, as a punishment upon the owner, for\r\nnot himself pursuing the felon, and taking away his goods from him[d].\r\nAnd therefore if the party robbed do his diligence immediately to\r\nfollow and apprehend the thief (which is called making fresh _suit_)\r\nor do convict him afterwards, or procure evidence to convict him, he\r\nshall have his goods again[e]. Waived goods do also not belong to the\r\nking, till seised by somebody for his use; for if the party robbed can\r\nseise them first, though at the distance of twenty years, the king\r\nshall never have them[f]. If the goods are hid by the thief, or left\r\nany where by him, so that he had them not about him when he fled, and\r\ntherefore did not throw them away in his flight; these also are not\r\n_bona waviata_, but the owner may have them again when he pleases[g].\r\nThe goods of a foreign merchant, though stolen and thrown away in\r\nflight, shall never be waifs[h]: the reason whereof may be, not only\r\nfor the encouragement of trade, but also because there is no wilful\r\ndefault in the foreign merchant's not pursuing the thief, he being\r\ngenerally a stranger to our laws, our usages, and our language.\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: Cro. Eliz. 694.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Finch. L. 212.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: 5 Rep. 109.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Fitzh. _Abr. tit. Estray._ 1. 3 Bulstr. 19.]\r\n\r\nXV. ESTRAYS are such valuable animals as are found wandering in any\r\nmanor or lordship, and no man knoweth the owner of them; in which case\r\nthe law gives them to the king as the general owner and lord paramount\r\nof the soil, in recompence for the damage which they may have done\r\ntherein; and they now most commonly belong to the lord of the manor,\r\nby special grant from the crown. But in order to vest an absolute\r\nproperty in the king or his grantees, they must be proclaimed in the\r\nchurch and two market towns next adjoining to the place where they are\r\nfound; and then, if no man claims them, after proclamation and a year\r\nand a day passed, they belong to the king or his substitute without\r\nredemption[i]; even though the owner were a minor, or under any other\r\nlegal incapacity[k]. A provision similar to which obtained in the old\r\nGothic constitution, with regard to all things that were found, which\r\nwere to be thrice proclaimed, _primum coram comitibus et viatoribus\r\nobviis, deinde in proxima villa vel pago, postremo coram ecclesia vel\r\njudicio_: and the space of a year was allowed for the owner to reclaim\r\nhis property[l]. If the owner claims them within the year and day, he\r\nmust pay the charges of finding, keeping, and proclaiming them[m]. The\r\nking or lord has no property till the year and day passed: for if a\r\nlord keepeth an estray three quarters of a year, and within the year\r\nit strayeth again, and another lord getteth it, the first lord cannot\r\ntake it again[n]. Any beast may be an estray, that is by nature tame\r\nor reclaimable, and in which there is a valuable property, as sheep,\r\noxen, swine, and horses, which we in general call cattle; and so\r\nFleta[o] defines it, _pecus vagans, quod nullus petit, sequitur, vel\r\nadvocat_. For animals upon which the law sets no value, as a dog or\r\ncat, and animals _ferae naturae_, as a bear or wolf, cannot be\r\nconsidered as estrays. So swans may be estrays, but not any other\r\nfowl[p]; whence they are said to be royal fowl. The reason of which\r\ndistinction seems to be, that, cattle and swans being of a reclaimed\r\nnature, the owner's property in them is not lost merely by their\r\ntemporary escape; and they also, from their intrinsic value, are a\r\nsufficient pledge for the expense of the lord of the franchise in\r\nkeeping them the year and day. For he that takes an estray is bound,\r\nso long as he keeps it, to find it in provisions and keep it from\r\ndamage[q]; and may not use it by way of labour, but is liable to an\r\naction for so doing[r]. Yet he may milk a cow, or the like, for that\r\ntends to the preservation, and is for the benefit, of the animal[s].\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: Mirr. c. 3. §. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: 5 Rep. 108.

Noy. 119.]\r\n\r\nBESIDES the particular reasons before given why the king should have\r\nthe several revenues of royal fish, shipwrecks, treasure-trove, waifs,\r\nand estrays, there is also one general reason which holds for them\r\nall; and that is, because they are _bona vacantia_, or goods in which\r\nno one else can claim a property. And therefore by the law of nature\r\nthey belonged to the first occupant or finder; and so continued under\r\nthe imperial law. But, in settling the modern constitutions of most of\r\nthe governments in Europe, it was thought proper (to prevent that\r\nstrife and contention, which the mere title of occupancy is apt to\r\ncreate and continue, and to provide for the support of public\r\nauthority in a manner the least burthensome to individuals) that these\r\nrights should be annexed to the supreme power by the positive laws of\r\nthe state. And so it came to pass that, as Bracton expresses it[t],\r\n_haec, quae nullius in bonis sunt, et olim fuerunt inventoris de jure\r\nnaturali, jam efficiuntur principis de jure gentium_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: _l._ 1. _c._ 12.]\r\n\r\nXVI. THE next branch of the king's ordinary revenue consists in\r\nforfeitures of lands and goods for offences; _bona confiscata_, as\r\nthey are called by the civilians, because they belonged to the\r\n_fiscus_ or imperial treasury; or, as our lawyers term them,\r\n_forisfacta_, that is, such whereof the property is gone away or\r\ndeparted from the owner. The true reason and only substantial ground\r\nof any forfeiture for crimes consist in this; that all property is\r\nderived from society, being one of those civil rights which are\r\nconferred upon individuals, in exchange for that degree of natural\r\nfreedom, which every man must sacrifice when he enters into social\r\ncommunities. If therefore a member of any national community violates\r\nthe fundamental contract of his association, by transgressing the\r\nmunicipal law, he forfeits his right to such privileges as he claims\r\nby that contract; and the state may very justly resume that portion of\r\nproperty, or any part of it, which the laws have before assigned him.\r\nHence, in every offence of an atrocious kind, the laws of England have\r\nexacted a total confiscation of the moveables or personal estate; and\r\nin many cases a perpetual, in others only a temporary, loss of the\r\noffender's immoveables or landed property; and have vested them both\r\nin the king, who is the person supposed to be offended, being the one\r\nvisible magistrate in whom the majesty of the public resides. The\r\nparticulars of these forfeitures will be more properly recited when we\r\ntreat of crimes and misdemesnors. I therefore only mention them here,\r\nfor the sake of regularity, as a part of the _census regalis_; and\r\nshall postpone for the present the farther consideration of all\r\nforfeitures, excepting one species only, which arises from the\r\nmisfortune rather than the crime of the owner, and is called a\r\n_deodand_.\r\n\r\nBY this is meant whatever personal chattel is the immediate occasion\r\nof the death of any reasonable creature; which is forfeited to the\r\nking, to be applied to pious uses, and distributed in alms by his high\r\nalmoner[u]; though formerly destined to a more superstitious purpose.\r\nIt seems to have been originally designed, in the blind days of\r\npopery, as an expiation for the souls of such as were snatched away by\r\nsudden death; and for that purpose ought properly to have been given\r\nto holy church[w]; in the same manner, as the apparel of a stranger\r\nwho was found dead was applied to purchase masses for the good of his\r\nsoul. And this may account for that rule of law, that no deodand is\r\ndue where an infant under the years of discretion is killed by a fall\r\n_from_ a cart, or horse, or the like, not being in motion[x]; whereas,\r\nif an adult person falls from thence and is killed, the thing is\r\ncertainly forfeited. For the reason given by sir Matthew Hale seems to\r\nbe very inadequate, _viz._ because an infant is not able to take care\r\nof himself: for why should the owner save his forfeiture, on account\r\nof the imbecillity of the child, which ought rather to have made him\r\nmore cautious to prevent any accident of mischief? The true ground of\r\nthis rule seems rather to be, that the child, by reason of it's want\r\nof discretion, is presumed incapable of actual sin, and therefore\r\nneeded no deodand to purchase propitiatory masses: but every adult,\r\nwho dies in actual sin, stood in need of such atonement, according to\r\nthe humane superstition of the founders of the English law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: 1 Hal. P.C. 419. Fleta. _l._ 1. _c._ 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: Fitzh. _Abr. tit. Enditement._ _pl._ 27. Staunf. P.C. 20,\r\n21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: 3 Inst. 57. 1 Hal. P.C. 422.]\r\n\r\nTHUS stands the law, if a person be killed by a fall from a thing\r\nstanding still. But if a horse, or ox, or other animal, of his own\r\nmotion, kill as well an infant as an adult, or if a cart run over him,\r\nthey shall in either case be forfeited as deodands[y]; which is\r\ngrounded upon this additional reason, that such misfortunes are in\r\npart owing to the negligence of the owner, and therefore he is\r\nproperly punished by such forfeiture. A like punishment is in like\r\ncases inflicted by the mosaical law[z]: \"if an ox gore a man that he\r\ndie, the ox shall be stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten.\" And\r\namong the Athenians[a], whatever was the cause of a man's death, by\r\nfalling upon him, was exterminated or cast out of the dominions of the\r\nrepublic. Where a thing, not in motion, is the occasion of a man's\r\ndeath, that part only which is the immediate cause is forfeited; as if\r\na man be climbing up a wheel, and is killed by falling from it, the\r\nwheel alone is a deodand[b]: but, wherever the thing is in motion, not\r\nonly that part which immediately gives the wound, (as the wheel, which\r\nruns over his body) but all things which move with it and help to make\r\nthe wound more dangerous (as the cart and loading, which increase the\r\npressure of the wheel) are forfeited[c]. It matters not whether the\r\nowner were concerned in the killing or not; for if a man kills another\r\nwith my sword, the sword is forfeited[d] as an accursed thing[e]. And\r\ntherefore, in all indictments for homicide, the instrument of death\r\nand the value are presented and found by the grand jury (as, that the\r\nstroke was given with a certain penknife, value sixpence) that the\r\nking or his grantee may claim the deodand: for it is no deodand,\r\nunless it be presented as such by a jury of twelve men[f]. No deodands\r\nare due for accidents happening upon the high sea, that being out of\r\nthe jurisdiction of the common law: but if a man falls from a boat or\r\nship in fresh water, and is drowned, the vessel and cargo are in\r\nstrictness a deodand[g].\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: _Omnia, quae movent ad mortem, sunt Deo danda._ Bracton.\r\n_l._ 3. _c._ 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: Exod. 21. 28.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: Aeschin. _contr.

ANOTHER branch of the king's ordinary revenue arises from\r\nescheats of lands, which happen upon the defect of heirs to succeed to\r\nthe inheritance; whereupon they in general revert to and vest in the\r\nking, who is esteemed, in the eye of the law, the original proprietor\r\nof all the lands in the kingdom. But the discussion of this topic more\r\nproperly belongs to the second book of these commentaries, wherein we\r\nshall particularly consider the manner in which lands may be acquired\r\nor lost by escheat.\r\n\r\nXVIII. I PROCEED therefore to the eighteenth and last branch of the\r\nking's ordinary revenue; which consists in the custody of idiots, from\r\nwhence we shall be naturally led to consider also the custody of\r\nlunatics.\r\n\r\nAN idiot, or natural fool, is one that hath had no understanding from\r\nhis nativity; and therefore is by law presumed never likely to attain\r\nany. For which reason the custody of him and of his lands was formerly\r\nvested in the lord of the fee[h]; (and therefore still, by special\r\ncustom, in some manors the lord shall have the ordering of idiot and\r\nlunatic copyholders[i]) but, by reason of the manifold abuses of this\r\npower by subjects, it was at last provided by common consent, that it\r\nshould be given to the king, as the general conservator of his people,\r\nin order to prevent the idiot from wasting his estate, and reducing\r\nhimself and his heirs to poverty and distress[k]: This fiscal\r\nprerogative of the king is declared in parliament by statute 17 Edw.\r\nII. c. 9. which directs (in affirmance of the common law[l],) that the\r\nking shall have ward of the lands of natural fools, taking the profits\r\nwithout waste or destruction, and shall find them necessaries; and\r\nafter the death of such idiots he shall render the estate to the\r\nheirs; in order to prevent such idiots from aliening their lands, and\r\ntheir heirs from being disherited.\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Flet. _l._ 1. _c._ 11. §. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: Dyer. 302. Hutt. 17. Noy 27.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: F.N.B. 232.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: 4 Rep. 126.]\r\n\r\nBY the old common law there is a writ _de idiota inquirendo_, to\r\nenquire whether a man be an idiot or not[m]: which must be tried by a\r\njury of twelve men; and if they find him _purus idiota_, the profits\r\nof his lands, and the custody of his person may be granted by the king\r\nto some subject, who has interest enough to obtain them[n]. This\r\nbranch of the revenue hath been long considered as a hardship upon\r\nprivate families; and so long ago as in the 8 Jac. I. it was under the\r\nconsideration of parliament, to vest this custody in the relations of\r\nthe party, and to settle an equivalent on the crown in lieu of it; it\r\nbeing then proposed to share the same fate with the slavery of the\r\nfeodal tenures, which has been since abolished[o]. Yet few instances\r\ncan be given of the oppressive exertion of it, since it seldom happens\r\nthat a jury finds a man an idiot _a nativitate_, but only _non compos\r\nmentis_ from some particular time; which has an operation very\r\ndifferent in point of law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: F.N.B. 232.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: This power, though of late very rarely exerted, is still\r\nalluded to in common speech, by that usual expression of _begging_ a\r\nman for a fool.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: 4. Inst. 203. Com. Journ. 1610.]\r\n\r\nA MAN is not an idiot[p], if he hath any glimmering of reason, so that\r\nhe can tell his parents, his age, or the like common matters. But a\r\nman who is born deaf, dumb, and blind, is looked upon by the law as in\r\nthe same state with an idiot[q]; he being supposed incapable of\r\nunderstanding, as wanting those senses which furnish the human mind\r\nwith ideas.\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: F.N.B. 233.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: Co. Litt. 42. Fleta. _l._ 6. _c._ 40.]\r\n\r\nA LUNATIC, or _non compos mentis_, is one who hath had understanding,\r\nbut by disease, grief, or other accident hath lost the use of his\r\nreason. A lunatic is indeed properly one that hath lucid intervals;\r\nsometimes enjoying his senses, and sometimes not, and that frequently\r\ndepending upon the change of the moon. But under the general name of\r\n_non compos mentis_ (which sir Edward Coke says is the most legal\r\nname[r]) are comprized not only lunatics, but persons under frenzies;\r\nor who lose their intellects by disease; those that _grow_ deaf, dumb,\r\nand blind, not being _born_ so; or such, in short, as are by any means\r\nrendered incapable of conducting their own affairs. To these also, as\r\nwell as idiots, the king is guardian, but to a very different purpose.\r\nFor the law always imagines, that these accidental misfortunes may be\r\nremoved; and therefore only constitutes the crown a trustee for the\r\nunfortunate persons, to protect their property, and to account to them\r\nfor all profits received, if they recover, or after their decease to\r\ntheir representatives. And therefore it is declared by the statute 17\r\nEdw. II. c. 10. that the king shall provide for the custody and\r\nsustentation of lunatics, and preserve their lands and the profits of\r\nthem, for their use, when they come to their right mind: and the king\r\nshall take nothing to his own use; and if the parties die in such\r\nestate, the residue shall be distributed for their souls by the advice\r\nof the ordinary, and of course (by the subsequent amendments of the\r\nlaw of administrations) shall now go to their executors or\r\nadministrators.\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: 1 Inst. 246.]\r\n\r\nTHE method of proving a person _non compos_ is very similar to that of\r\nproving him an idiot. The lord chancellor, to whom, by special\r\nauthority from the king, the custody of idiots and lunatics is\r\nintrusted[s], upon petition or information, grants a commission in\r\nnature of the writ _de idiota inquirendo_, to enquire into the party's\r\nstate of mind; and if he be found _non compos_, he usually commits the\r\ncare of his person, with a suitable allowance for his maintenance, to\r\nsome friend, who is then called his committee. However, to prevent\r\nsinister practices, the next heir is never permitted to be this\r\ncommittee of the person; because it is his interest that the party\r\nshould die. But, it hath been said, there lies not the same objection\r\nagainst his next of kin, provided he be not his heir; for it is his\r\ninterest to preserve the lunatic's life, in order to increase the\r\npersonal estate by savings, which he or his family may hereafter be\r\nentitled to enjoy[t]. The heir is generally made the manager or\r\ncommittee of the estate, it being clearly his interest by good\r\nmanagement to keep it in condition; accountable however to the court\r\nof chancery, and to the _non compos_ himself, if he recovers; or\r\notherwise, to his administrators.\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: 3 P. Wms. 108.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: 2 P. Wms. 638.]\r\n\r\nIN this care of idiots and lunatics the civil law agrees with ours; by\r\nassigning them tutors to protect their persons, and curators to manage\r\ntheir estates. But in another instance the Roman law goes much beyond\r\nthe English. For, if a man by notorious prodigality was in danger of\r\nwasting his estate, he was looked upon as _non compos_ and committed\r\nto the care of curators or tutors by the praetor[u]. And by the laws\r\nof Solon such prodigals were branded with perpetual infamy[w]. But\r\nwith us, when a man on an inquest of idiocy hath been returned an\r\n_unthrift_ and not an _idiot_[x], no farther proceedings have been\r\nhad. And the propriety of the practice itself seems to be very\r\nquestionable. It was doubtless an excellent method of benefiting the\r\nindividual and of preserving estates in families; but it hardly seems\r\ncalculated for the genius of a free nation, who claim and exercise the\r\nliberty of using their own property as they please. \"_Sic utere tuo,\r\nut alienum non laedas_,\" is the only restriction our laws have given\r\nwith regard to oeconomical prudence. And the frequent circulation and\r\ntransfer of lands and other property, which cannot be effected\r\nwithout extravagance somewhere, are perhaps not a little conducive\r\ntowards keeping our mixed constitution in it's due health and vigour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: _Solent praetores, si talem hominem invenerint, qui neque\r\ntempus neque finem expensarum habet, sed bona sua dilacerando et\r\ndissipando profundit, curatorem ei dare, exemplo furiosi: et tamdiu\r\nerunt ambo in curatione, quamdiu vel furiosus sanitatem, vel ille\r\nbonos mores, receperit._ _Ff._ 27. 10. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: Potter. Antiqu. b. 1. c. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: Bro. _Abr. tit. Ideot._ 4.]\r\n\r\nTHIS may suffice for a short view of the king's _ordinary_ revenue, or\r\nthe proper patrimony of the crown; which was very large formerly, and\r\ncapable of being increased to a magnitude truly formidable: for there\r\nare very few estates in the kingdom, that have not, at some period or\r\nother since the Norman conquest, been vested in the hands of the king\r\nby forfeiture, escheat, or otherwise. But, fortunately for the liberty\r\nof the subject, this hereditary landed revenue, by a series of\r\nimprovident management, is sunk almost to nothing; and the casual\r\nprofits, arising from the other branches of the _census regalis_, are\r\nlikewise almost all of them alienated from the crown. In order to\r\nsupply the deficiences of which, we are now obliged to have recourse\r\nto new methods of raising money, unknown to our early ancestors; which\r\nmethods constitute the king's _extraordinary_ revenue. For, the\r\npublick patrimony being got into the hands of private subjects, it is\r\nbut reasonable that private contributions should supply the public\r\nservice. Which, though it may perhaps fall harder upon some\r\nindividuals, whose ancestors have had no share in the general plunder,\r\nthan upon others, yet, taking the nation throughout, it amounts to\r\nnearly the same; provided the gain by the extraordinary, should appear\r\nto be no greater than the loss by the ordinary, revenue. And perhaps,\r\nif every gentleman in the kingdom was to be stripped of such of his\r\nlands as were formerly the property of the crown; was to be again\r\nsubject to the inconveniences of purveyance and pre-emption, the\r\noppression of forest laws, and the slavery of feodal tenures; and was\r\nto resign into the king's hands all his royal franchises of waifs,\r\nwrecks, estrays, treasure-trove, mines, deodands, forfeitures, and the\r\nlike; he would find himself a greater loser, than by paying his\r\n_quota_ to such taxes, as are necessary to the support of government.\r\nThe thing therefore to be wished and aimed at in a land of liberty, is\r\nby no means the total abolition of taxes, which would draw after it\r\nvery pernicious consequences, and the very supposition of which is the\r\nheight of political absurdity. For as the true idea of government and\r\nmagistracy will be found to consist in this, that some few men are\r\ndeputed by many others to preside over public affairs, so that\r\nindividuals may the better be enabled to attend to their private\r\nconcerns; it is necessary that those individuals should be bound to\r\ncontribute a portion of their private gains, in order to support that\r\ngovernment, and reward that magistracy, which protects them in the\r\nenjoyment of their respective properties. But the things to be aimed\r\nat are wisdom and moderation, not only in granting, but also in the\r\nmethod of raising, the necessary supplies; by contriving to do both in\r\nsuch a manner as may be most conducive to the national welfare and at\r\nthe same time most consistent with oeconomy and the liberty of the\r\nsubject; who, when properly taxed, contributes only, as was before\r\nobserved[y], some part of his property, in order to enjoy the rest.\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: pag. 271.]\r\n\r\nTHESE extraordinary grants are usually called by the synonymous names\r\nof aids, subsidies, and supplies; and are granted, we have formerly\r\nseen[z], by the commons of Great Britain, in parliament assembled:\r\nwho, when they have voted a supply to his majesty, and settled the\r\n_quantum_ of that supply, usually resolve themselves into what is\r\ncalled a committee of ways and means, to consider of the ways and\r\nmeans of raising the supply so voted. And in this committee every\r\nmember (though it is looked upon as the peculiar province of the\r\nchancellor of the exchequer) may propose such scheme of taxation as he\r\nthinks will be least detrimental to the public. The resolutions of\r\nthis committee (when approved by a vote of the house) are in general\r\nesteemed to be (as it were) final and conclusive. For, through\r\n[Transcriber's Note: though] the supply cannot be actually raised upon\r\nthe subject till directed by an act of the whole parliament, yet no\r\nmonied man will scruple to advance to the government any quantity of\r\nready cash, on the credit of a bare vote of the house of commons,\r\nthough no law be yet passed to establish it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: pag. 163.]\r\n\r\nTHE taxes, which are raised upon the subject, are either annual or\r\nperpetual. The usual annual taxes are those upon land and malt.\r\n\r\nI. THE land tax, in it's modern shape, has superseded all the former\r\nmethods of rating either property, or persons in respect of their\r\nproperty, whether by tenths or fifteenths, subsidies on land, hydages,\r\nscutages, or talliages; a short explication of which will greatly\r\nassist us in understanding our antient laws and history.\r\n\r\nTENTHS, and fifteenths[a], were temporary aids issuing out of personal\r\nproperty, and granted to the king by parliament. They were formerly\r\nthe real tenth or fifteenth part of all the moveables belonging to the\r\nsubject; when such moveables, or personal estates, were a very\r\ndifferent and a much less considerable thing than what they usually\r\nare at this day. Tenths are said to have been first granted under\r\nHenry the second, who took advantage of the fashionable zeal for\r\ncroisades to introduce this new taxation, in order to defray the\r\nexpense of a pious expedition to Palestine, which he really or\r\nseemingly had projected against Saladine emperor of the Saracens;\r\nwhence it was originally denominated the Saladine tenth[b]. But\r\nafterwards fifteenths were more usually granted than tenths.\r\nOriginally the amount of these taxes was uncertain, being levied by\r\nassessments new made at every fresh grant of the commons, a commission\r\nfor which is preserved by Matthew Paris[c]: but it was at length\r\nreduced to a certainty in the eighth of Edw. III. when, by virtue of\r\nthe king's commission, new taxations were made of every township,\r\nborough, and city in the kingdom, and recorded in the exchequer; which\r\nrate was, at the time, the fifteenth part of the value of every\r\ntownship, the whole amounting to about 29000_l._ and therefore it\r\nstill kept up the name of a fifteenth, when, by the alteration of the\r\nvalue of money and the encrease of personal property, things came to\r\nbe in a very different situation. So that when, of later years, the\r\ncommons granted the king a fifteenth, every parish in England\r\nimmediately knew their proportion of it; that is, the same identical\r\nsum that was assessed by the same aid in the eighth of Edw. III; and\r\nthen raised it by a rate among themselves, and returned it into the\r\nroyal exchequer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: 2 Inst. 77. 4 Inst. 34.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Hoved. _A.D._ 1188. Carte. 1. 719. Hume. 1. 329.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: _A.D._ 1232.]\r\n\r\nTHE other antient levies were in the nature of a modern land tax; for\r\nwe may trace up the original of that charge as high as to the\r\nintroduction of our military tenures[d]; when every tenant of a\r\nknight's fee was bound, if called upon, to attend the king in his army\r\nfor forty days in every year. But this personal attendance growing\r\ntroublesome in many respects, the tenants found means of compounding\r\nfor it, by first sending others in their stead, and in process of time\r\nby making a pecuniary satisfaction to the crown in lieu of it. This\r\npecuniary satisfaction at last came to be levied by assessments, at so\r\nmuch for every knight's fee, under the name of scutages; which appear\r\nto have been levied for the first time in the fifth year of Henry the\r\nsecond, on account of his expedition to Toulouse, and were then (I\r\napprehend) mere arbitrary compositions, as the king and the subject\r\ncould agree. But this precedent being afterwards abused into a means\r\nof oppression, (by levying scutages on the landholders by the royal\r\nauthority only, whenever our kings went to war, in order to hire\r\nmercenary troops and pay their contingent expences) it became\r\nthereupon a matter of national complaint; and king John was obliged to\r\npromise in his _magna carta_[e], that no scutage should be imposed\r\nwithout the consent of the common council of the realm. This clause\r\nwas indeed omitted in the charters of Henry III, where[f] we only find\r\nit stipulated, that scutages should be taken as they were used to be\r\nin the time of king Henry the second. Yet afterwards, by a variety of\r\nstatutes under Edward I and his grandson[g], it was provided, that\r\nthe king shall not take any aids or tasks, any talliage or tax, but by\r\nthe common assent of the great men and commons in parliament.\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: See the second book of these commentaries.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: _cap._ 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: 9 Hen. III. c. 37.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: 25 Edw. I. c. 5 & 6. 34 Edw. I. st. 4. c. 1. 14 Edw. III.\r\nst. 2. c. 1.]\r\n\r\nOF the same nature with scutages upon knights-fees were the\r\nassessments of hydage upon all other lands, and of talliage upon\r\ncities and burghs[h]. But they all gradually fell into disuse, upon\r\nthe introduction of subsidies, about the time of king Richard II and\r\nking Henry IV. These were a tax, not immediately imposed upon\r\nproperty, but upon persons in respect of their reputed estates, after\r\nthe nominal rate of 4_s._ in the pound for lands, and 2_s._ 6_d._ for\r\ngoods; and for those of aliens in a double proportion. But this\r\nassessment was also made according to an antient valuation; wherein\r\nthe computation was so very moderate, and the rental of the kingdom\r\nwas supposed to be so exceeding low, that one subsidy of this sort did\r\nnot, according to sir Edward Coke[i], amount to more than 70000_l._\r\nwhereas a modern land tax at the same rate produces two millions. It\r\nwas antiently the rule never to grant more than one subsidy, and two\r\nfifteenths at a time; but this rule was broke through for the first\r\ntime on a very pressing occasion, the Spanish invasion in 1588; when\r\nthe parliament gave queen Elizabeth two subsidies and four fifteenths.\r\nAfterwards, as money sunk in value, more subsidies were given; and we\r\nhave an instance in the first parliament of 1640, of the king's\r\ndesiring twelve subsidies of the commons, to be levied in three years;\r\nwhich was looked upon as a startling proposal: though lord Clarendon\r\ntells us[k], that the speaker, serjeant Glanvile, made it manifest to\r\nthe house, how very inconsiderable a sum twelve subsidies amounted to,\r\nby telling them he had computed what he was to pay for them; and, when\r\nhe named the sum, he being known to be possessed of a great estate, it\r\nseemed not worth any farther deliberation. And indeed, upon\r\ncalculation, we shall find, that the total amount of these twelve\r\nsubsidies, to be raised in three years, is less than what is now\r\nraised in one year, by a land tax of two shillings in the pound.\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Madox. hist. exch. 480.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: 4 Inst. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Hist. b. 2.]\r\n\r\nTHE grant of scutages, talliages, or subsidies by the commons did not\r\nextend to spiritual preferments; those being usually taxed at the same\r\ntime by the clergy themselves in convocation; which grants of the\r\nclergy were confirmed in parliament, otherwise they were illegal, and\r\nnot binding; as the same noble writer observes of the subsidies\r\ngranted by the convocation, who continued sitting after the\r\ndissolution of the first parliament in 1640. A subsidy granted by the\r\nclergy was after the rate of 4_s._ in the pound according to the\r\nvaluation of their livings in the king's books; and amounted, sir\r\nEdward Coke tells us[l], to about 20000_l._ While this custom\r\ncontinued, convocations were wont to sit as frequently as parliaments:\r\nbut the last subsidies, thus given by the clergy, were those confirmed\r\nby statute 15 Car. II. cap. 10. since which another method of taxation\r\nhas generally prevailed, which takes in the clergy as well as the\r\nlaity; in recompense for which the beneficed clergy have from that\r\nperiod been allowed to vote at the elections of knights of the\r\nshire[m]; and thenceforward also the practice of giving ecclesiastical\r\nsubsidies hath fallen into total disuse.\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: 4 Inst 33.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: Dalt. of sheriffs, 418. Gilb. hist. of exch. c. 4.]\r\n\r\nTHE lay subsidy was usually raised by commissioners appointed by the\r\ncrown, or the great officers of state: and therefore in the beginning\r\nof the civil wars between Charles I and his parliament, the latter,\r\nhaving no other sufficient revenue to support themselves and their\r\nmeasures, introduced the practice of laying weekly and monthly\r\nassessments[n] of a specific sum upon the several counties of the\r\nkingdom; to be levied by a pound rate on lands and personal estates:\r\nwhich were occasionally continued during the whole usurpation,\r\nsometimes at the rate of 120000_l._ a month; sometimes at inferior\r\nrates[o]. After the restoration the antient method of granting\r\nsubsidies, instead of such monthly assessments, was twice, and twice\r\nonly, renewed; viz. in 1663, when four subsidies were granted by the\r\ntemporalty, and four by the clergy; and in 1670, when 800000_l._ was\r\nraised by way of subsidy, which was the last time of raising supplies\r\nin that manner. For, the monthly assessments being now established by\r\ncustom, being raised by commissioners named by parliament, and\r\nproducing a more certain revenue; from that time forwards we hear no\r\nmore of subsidies; but occasional assessments were granted as the\r\nnational emergencies required. These periodical assessments, the\r\nsubsidies which preceded them, and the more antient scutage, hydage,\r\nand talliage, were to all intents and purposes a land tax; and the\r\nassessments were sometimes expressly called so[p]. Yet a popular\r\nopinion has prevailed, that the land tax was first introduced in the\r\nreign of king William III; because in the year 1692 a new assessment\r\nor valuation of estates was made throughout the kingdom; which, though\r\nby no means a perfect one, had this effect, that a supply of\r\n500000_l._ was equal to 1_s._ in the pound of the value of the estates\r\ngiven in. And, according to this enhanced valuation, from the year\r\n1693 to the present, a period of above seventy years, the land tax has\r\ncontinued an annual charge upon the subject; above half the time at\r\n4_s._ in the pound, sometimes at 3_s_, sometimes at 2_s_, twice[q] at\r\n1_s_, but without any total intermission. The medium has been 3_s._\r\n3_d._ in the pound, being equivalent to twenty three antient\r\nsubsidies, and amounting annually to more than a million and an half\r\nof money. The method of raising it is by charging a particular sum\r\nupon each county, according to the valuation given in, _A.D._ 1692:\r\nand this sum is assessed and raised upon individuals (their personal\r\nestates, as well as real, being liable thereto) by commissioners\r\nappointed in the act, being the principal landholders of the county,\r\nand their officers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: 29 Nov. 4 Mar. 1642.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: One of these bills of assessment, in 1656, is preserved\r\nin Scobell's collection, 400.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: Com. Journ. 26 Jun. 9 Dec. 1678.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: in the years 1732 and 1733.]\r\n\r\nII. THE other annual tax is the malt tax; which is a sum of 750000_l_,\r\nraised every year by parliament, ever since 1697, by a duty of 6_d._\r\nin the bushel on malt, and a proportionable sum on certain liquors,\r\nsuch as cyder and perry, which might otherwise prevent the consumption\r\nof malt. This is under the management of the commissioners of the\r\nexcise; and is indeed itself no other than an annual excise, the\r\nnature of which species of taxation I shall presently explain: only\r\npremising at present, that in the year 1760 an additional perpetual\r\nexcise of 3_d._ _per_ bushel was laid upon malt; and in 1763 a\r\nproportionable excise was laid upon cyder and perry.\r\n\r\nTHE perpetual taxes are,\r\n\r\nI. THE customs; or the duties, toll, tribute, or tariff, payable upon\r\nmerchandize exported and imported. The considerations upon which this\r\nrevenue (or the more antient part of it, which arose only from\r\nexports) was invested in the king, were said to be two[r]; 1. Because\r\nhe gave the subject leave to depart the kingdom, and to carry his\r\ngoods along with him. 2. Because the king was bound of common right to\r\nmaintain and keep up the ports and havens, and to protect the merchant\r\nfrom pirates. Some have imagined they are called with us customs,\r\nbecause they were the inheritance of the king by immemorial usage and\r\nthe common law, and not granted him by any statute[s]: but sir Edward\r\nCoke hath clearly shewn[t], that the king's first claim to them was by\r\ngrant of parliament 3 Edw. I. though the record thereof is not now\r\nextant. And indeed this is in express words confessed by statute 25\r\nEdw. I. c. 7. wherein the king promises to take no customs from\r\nmerchants, without the common assent of the realm, \"saving to us and\r\nour heirs, the customs on wools, skins, and leather, formerly granted\r\nto us by the commonalty aforesaid.\" These were formerly called the\r\nhereditary customs of the crown; and were due on the exportation only\r\nof the said three commodities, and of none other: which were stiled\r\nthe _staple_ commodities of the kingdom, because they were obliged to\r\nbe brought to those ports where the king's staple was established, in\r\norder to be there first rated, and then exported[u]. They were\r\ndenominated in the barbarous Latin of our antient records,\r\n_custuma_[w]; not _consuetudines_, which is the language of our law\r\nwhenever it means merely usages. The duties on wool, sheep-skins, or\r\nwoolfells, and leather, exported, were called _custuma antiqua sive\r\nmagna_; and were payable by every merchant, as well native as\r\nstranger; with this difference, that merchant-strangers paid an\r\nadditional toll, _viz._ half as much again as was paid by natives. The\r\n_custuma parva et nova_ were an impost of 3_d._ in the pound, due from\r\nmerchant-strangers only, for all commodities as well imported as\r\nexported; which was usually called the alien's duty, and was first\r\ngranted in 31 Edw. I[x]. But these antient hereditary customs,\r\nespecially those on wool and woolfells, came to be of little account\r\nwhen the nation became sensible of the advantages of a home\r\nmanufacture, and prohibited the exportation of wool by statute 11 Edw.\r\nIII. c. 1.\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Dyer. 165.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: Dyer. 43. _pl._ 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: 2 Inst. 58, 59.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: Dav. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: This appellation seems to be derived from the French word\r\n_coustum_, or _coûtum_, which signifies toll or tribute, and owes it's\r\nown etymology to the word _coust_, which signifies price, charge, or,\r\nas we have adopted it in English, _cost_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: 4 Inst. 29.]\r\n\r\nTHERE is also another antient hereditary duty belonging to the crown,\r\ncalled the _prisage_ or _butlerage_ of wines. Prisage was a right of\r\n_taking_ two tons of wine from every ship importing into England\r\ntwenty tons or more; which by Edward I was exchanged into a duty of\r\n2_s._ for every ton imported by merchant-strangers; which is called\r\nbutlerage, because paid to the king's butler[y].\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Dav. 8. _b._ 2 Bulstr. 254.]\r\n\r\nOTHER customs payable upon exports and imports are distinguished into\r\nsubsidies, tonnage, poundage, and other imposts. Subsidies are such as\r\nwere imposed by parliament upon any of the staple commodities before\r\nmentioned, over and above the _custuma antiqua et magna_: tonnage was\r\na duty upon all wines imported, over and above the prisage and\r\nbutlerage aforesaid: poundage was a duty imposed _ad valorem_, at the\r\nrate of 12_d._ in the pound, on all other merchandize whatsoever: and\r\nthe other imports were such as were occasionally laid on by\r\nparliament, as circumstances and times required[z]. These distinctions\r\nare now in a manner forgotten, except by the officers immediately\r\nconcerned in this department; their produce being in effect all\r\nblended together, under the one denomination of the customs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: Dav. 11, 12.]\r\n\r\nBY these we understand, at present, a duty or subsidy paid by the\r\nmerchant, at the quay, upon all imported as well as exported\r\ncommodities, by authority of parliament; unless where, for particular\r\nnational reasons, certain rewards, bounties, or drawbacks, are allowed\r\nfor particular exports or imports. Those of tonnage and poundage, in\r\nparticular, were at first granted, as the old statutes, and\r\nparticularly 1 Eliz. c. 19. express it, for the defence of the realm,\r\nand the keeping and safeguard of the seas, and for the intercourse of\r\nmerchandize safely to come into and pass out of the same. They were at\r\nfirst usually granted only for a stated term of years, as, for two\r\nyears in 5 Ric. II[a]; but in Henry the fifth's time, they were\r\ngranted him for life by a statute in the third year of his reign; and\r\nagain to Edward IV for the term of his life also: since which time\r\nthey were regularly granted to all his successors, for life, sometimes\r\nat their first, sometimes at other subsequent parliaments, till the\r\nreign of Charles the first; when, as had before happened in the reign\r\nof Henry VIII[b] and other princes, they were neglected to be asked.\r\nAnd yet they were imprudently and unconstitutionally levied and taken\r\nwithout consent of parliament, (though more than one had been\r\nassembled) for fifteen years together; which was one of the causes of\r\nthose unhappy discontents, justifiable at first in too many instances,\r\nbut which degenerated at last into causeless rebellion and murder.\r\nFor, as in every other, so in this particular case, the king (previous\r\nto the commencement of hostilities) gave the nation ample satisfaction\r\nfor the errors of his former conduct, by passing an act[c], whereby he\r\nrenounced all power in the crown of levying the duty of tonnage and\r\npoundage, without the express consent of parliament; and also all\r\npower of imposition upon any merchandizes whatever. Upon the\r\nrestoration this duty was granted to king Charles the second for life,\r\nand so it was to his two immediate successors; but now by three\r\nseveral statutes, 9 Ann. c. 6. 1 Geo. I. c. 12. and 3 Geo. I. c. 7. it\r\nis made perpetual and mortgaged for the debt of the publick. The\r\ncustoms, thus imposed by parliament, are chiefly contained in two\r\nbooks of rates, set forth by parliamentary authority[d]; one signed by\r\nsir Harbottle Grimston, speaker of the house of commons in Charles the\r\nsecond's time; and the other an additional one signed by sir Spenser\r\nCompton, speaker in the reign of George the first; to which also\r\nsubsequent additions have been made. Aliens pay a larger proportion\r\nthan natural subjects, which is what is now generally understood by\r\nthe aliens' duty; to be exempted from which is one principal cause of\r\nthe frequent applications to parliament for acts of naturalization.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: Dav. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Stat. 6 Hen. VIII. c. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: 16 Car. I. c. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: Stat. 12 Car. II. c. 4. 11 Geo. I. c. 7.]\r\n\r\nTHESE customs are then, we see, a tax immediately paid by the\r\nmerchant, although ultimately by the consumer. And yet these are the\r\nduties felt least by the people; and, if prudently managed, the people\r\nhardly consider that they pay them at all. For the merchant is easy,\r\nbeing sensible he does not pay them for himself; and the consumer, who\r\nreally pays them, confounds them with the price of the commodity: in\r\nthe same manner as Tacitus observes, that the emperor Nero gained the\r\nreputation of abolishing the tax on the sale of slaves, though he only\r\ntransferred it from the buyer to the seller; so that it was, as he\r\nexpresses it, \"_remissum magis specie, quam vi: quia cum venditor\r\npendere juberetur, in partem pretii emptoribus accrescebat_[e].\" But\r\nthis inconvenience attends it on the other hand, that these imposts,\r\nif too heavy, are a check and cramp upon trade; and especially when\r\nthe value of the commodity bears little or no proportion to the\r\nquantity of the duty imposed. This in consequence gives rise also to\r\nsmuggling, which then becomes a very lucrative employment: and it's\r\nnatural and most reasonable punishment, _viz._ confiscation of the\r\ncommodity, is in such cases quite ineffectual; the intrinsic value of\r\nthe goods, which is all that the smuggler has paid, and therefore all\r\nthat he can lose, being very inconsiderable when compared with his\r\nprospect of advantage in evading the duty. Recourse must therefore be\r\nhad to extraordinary punishments to prevent it; perhaps even to\r\ncapital ones: which destroys all proportion of punishment[f], and puts\r\nmurderers upon an equal footing with such as are really guilty of no\r\nnatural, but merely a positive offence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Hist. l. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Montesqu. Sp. L. b. 13. c. 8.]\r\n\r\nTHERE is also another ill consequence attending high imports on\r\nmerchandize, not frequently considered, but indisputably certain; that\r\nthe earlier any tax is laid on a commodity, the heavier it falls upon\r\nthe consumer in the end: for every trader, through whose hands it\r\npasses, must have a profit, not only upon the raw material and his own\r\nlabour and time in preparing it, but also upon the very tax itself,\r\nwhich he advances to the government; otherwise he loses the use and\r\ninterest of the money which he so advances. To instance in the article\r\nof foreign paper. The merchant pays a duty upon importation, which he\r\ndoes not receive again till he sells the commodity, perhaps at the end\r\nof three months. He is therefore equally entitled to a profit upon\r\nthat duty which he pays at the customhouse, as to a profit upon the\r\noriginal price which he pays to the manufacturer abroad; and considers\r\nit accordingly in the price he demands of the stationer. When the\r\nstationer sells it again, he requires a profit of the printer or\r\nbookseller upon the whole sum advanced by him to the merchant: and the\r\nbookseller does not forget to charge the full proportion to the\r\nstudent or ultimate consumer; who therefore does not only pay the\r\noriginal duty, but the profits of these three intermediate traders,\r\nwho have successively advanced it for him. This might be carried much\r\nfarther in any mechanical, or more complicated, branch of trade.\r\n\r\nII. DIRECTLY opposite in it's nature to this is the excise duty; which\r\nis an inland imposition, paid sometimes upon the consumption of the\r\ncommodity, or frequently upon the retail sale, which is the last stage\r\nbefore the consumption. This is doubtless, impartially speaking, the\r\nmost oeconomical way of taxing the subject: the charges of levying,\r\ncollecting, and managing the excise duties being considerably less in\r\nproportion, than in any other branch of the revenue. It also renders\r\nthe commodity cheaper to the consumer, than charging it with customs\r\nto the same amount would do; for the reason just now given, because\r\ngenerally paid in a much later stage of it. But, at the same time, the\r\nrigour and arbitrary proceedings of excise-laws seem hardly compatible\r\nwith the temper of a free nation. For the frauds that might be\r\ncommitted in this branch of the revenue, unless a strict watch is\r\nkept, make it necessary, wherever it is established, to give the\r\nofficers a power of entring and searching the houses of such as deal\r\nin excisable commodities, at any hour of the day, and, in many cases,\r\nof the night likewise. And the proceedings in case of transgressions\r\nare so summary and sudden, that a man may be convicted in two days\r\ntime in the penalty of many thousand pounds by two commissioners or\r\njustices of the peace; to the total exclusion of the trial by jury,\r\nand disregard of the common law. For which reason, though lord\r\nClarendon tells us[g], that to his knowlege the earl of Bedford (who\r\nwas made lord treasurer by king Charles the first, to oblige his\r\nparliament) intended to have set up the excise in England, yet it\r\nnever made a part of that unfortunate prince's revenue; being first\r\nintroduced, on the model of the Dutch prototype, by the parliament\r\nitself after it's rupture with the crown. Yet such was the opinion of\r\nit's general unpopularity, that when in 1642 \"aspersions were cast by\r\nmalignant persons upon the house of commons, that they intended to\r\nintroduce excises, the house for it's vindication therein did declare,\r\nthat these rumours were false and scandalous; and that their authors\r\nshould be apprehended and brought to condign punishment[h].\" It's\r\noriginal establishment was in 1643, and it's progress was gradual[i];\r\nbeing at first laid upon those persons and commodities, where it was\r\nsupposed the hardship would be least perceivable, _viz._ the makers\r\nand venders of beer, ale, cyder, and perry[k]; and the royalists at\r\nOxford soon followed the example of their brethren at Westminster by\r\nimposing a similar duty; both sides protesting that it should be\r\ncontinued no longer than to the end of the war, and then be utterly\r\nabolished[l]. But the parliament at Westminster soon after imposed it\r\non flesh, wine, tobacco, sugar, and such a multitude of other\r\ncommodities that it might fairly be denominated general; in pursuance\r\nof the plan laid down by Mr Pymme (who seems to have been the father\r\nof the excise) in his letter to sir John Hotham[m], signifying, \"that\r\nthey had proceeded in the excise to many particulars, and intended to\r\ngo on farther; but that it would be necessary to use the people to it\r\nby little and little.\" And afterwards, when the people had been\r\naccustomed to it for a series of years, the succeeding champions of\r\nliberty boldly and openly declared, \"the impost of excise to be the\r\nmost easy and indifferent levy that could be laid upon the people[n]:\"\r\nand accordingly continued it during the whole usurpation. Upon king\r\nCharles's return, it having then been long established and it's\r\nproduce well known, some part of it was given to the crown, in the 12\r\nCar. II, by way of purchase (as was before observed) for the feodal\r\ntenures and other oppressive parts of the hereditary revenue. But,\r\nfrom it's first original to the present time, it's very name has been\r\nodious to the people of England. It has nevertheless been imposed on\r\nabundance of other commodities in the reigns of king William III, and\r\nevery succeeding prince, to support the enormous expenses occasioned\r\nby our wars on the continent. Thus brandies and other spirits are now\r\nexcised at the distillery; printed silks and linens, at the printers;\r\nstarch and hair powder, at the maker's; gold and silver wire, at the\r\nwiredrawer's; all plate whatsoever, first in the hands of the vendor,\r\nwho pays yearly for a licence to sell it, and afterwards in the hands\r\nof the occupier, who also pays an annual duty for having it in his\r\ncustody; and coaches and other wheel carriages, for which the occupier\r\nis excised; though not with the same circumstances of arbitrary\r\nstrictness with regard to plate and coaches, as in the other\r\ninstances. To these we may add coffee and tea, chocolate, and cocoa\r\npaste, for which the duty is paid by the retailer; all artificial\r\nwines, commonly called sweets; paper and pasteboard, first when made,\r\nand again if stained or printed; malt as before-mentioned; vinegars;\r\nand the manufacture of glass; for all which the duty is paid by the\r\nmanufacturer; hops, for which the person that gathers them is\r\nanswerable; candles and soap, which are paid for at the maker's; malt\r\nliquors brewed for sale, which are excised at the brewery; cyder and\r\nperry, at the mill; and leather and skins, at the tanner's. A list,\r\nwhich no friend to his country would wish to see farther encreased.\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Hist. b. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Com. Journ. 8 Oct. 1642.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: The translator and continuator of Petavius's\r\nchronological history (Lond. 1659.) informs us, that it was first\r\nmoved for, 28 Mar. 1643, by Mr Prynne. And it appears from the\r\njournals of the commons that on that day the house resolved itself\r\ninto a committee to consider of raising money, in consequence of which\r\nthe excise was afterwards voted. But Mr Prynne was not a member of\r\nparliament till 7 Nov. 1648; and published in 1654 \"A protestation\r\nagainst the illegal, detestable, and oft-condemned tax and extortion\r\nof excise in general.\" It is probably therefore a mistake of the\r\nprinter for Mr Pymme, who was intended for chancellor of the exchequer\r\nunder the earl of Bedford. (Lord Clar. b. 7.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Com. Journ. 17 May 1643.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: Lord Clar. b. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: 30 May 1643. Dugdale of the troubles, 120.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: Ord. 14 Aug. 1649. c. 50. Scobell. 72. Stat. 1656. c. 19.\r\nScobell. 453.]\r\n\r\nIII. I PROCEED therefore to a third duty, namely that upon salt; which\r\nis another distinct branch of his majesty's extraordinary revenue, and\r\nconsists in an excise of 3_s._ 4_d._ _per_ bushel imposed upon all\r\nsalt, by several statutes of king William and other subsequent reigns.\r\nThis is not generally called an excise, because under the management\r\nof different commissioners: but the commissioners of the salt duties\r\nhave by statute 1 Ann. c. 21. the same powers, and must observe the\r\nsame regulations, as those of other excises. This tax had usually been\r\nonly temporary; but by statute 26 Geo. II. c. 3. was made perpetual.\r\n\r\nIV. ANOTHER very considerable branch of the revenue is levied with\r\ngreater chearfulness, as, instead of being a burden, it is a manifest\r\nadvantage to the public. I mean the post-office, or duty for the\r\ncarriage of letters. As we have traced the original of the excise to\r\nthe parliament of 1643, so it is but justice to observe that this\r\nuseful invention owes it's birth to the same assembly. It is true,\r\nthere existed postmasters in much earlier times: but I apprehend their\r\nbusiness was confined to the furnishing of posthorses to persons who\r\nwere desirous to travel expeditiously, and to the dispatching\r\nextraordinary pacquets upon special occasions. The outline of the\r\npresent plan seems to have been originally conceived by Mr Edmond\r\nPrideaux, who was appointed attorney general to the commonwealth after\r\nthe murder of king Charles. He was a chairman of a committee in 1642\r\nfor considering what rates should be set upon inland letters[o]; and\r\nafterwards appointed postmaster by an ordinance of both the houses[p],\r\nin the execution of which office he first established a weekly\r\nconveyance of letters into all parts of the nation[q]: thereby saving\r\nto the public the charge of maintaining postmasters, to the amount of\r\n7000_l._ _per annum_. And, his own emoluments being probably\r\nconsiderable, the common council of London endeavoured to erect\r\nanother post-office in opposition to his, till checked by a resolution\r\nof the commons[r], declaring, that the office of postmaster is and\r\nought to be in the sole power and disposal of the parliament. This\r\noffice was afterwards farmed by one Manley in 1654[s]. But, in 1657, a\r\nregular post-office was erected by the authority of the protector and\r\nhis parliament, upon nearly the same model as has been ever since\r\nadopted, with the same rates of postage as were continued till the\r\nreign of queen Anne[t]. After the restoration a similar office, with\r\nsome improvements, was established by statute 12 Car. II. c. 35. but\r\nthe rates of letters were altered, and some farther regulations added,\r\nby the statutes 9 Ann. c. 10. 6 Geo. I. c. 21. 26 Geo. II. c. 12. and\r\n5 Geo. III. c. 25. and penalties were enacted, in order to confine the\r\ncarriage of letters to the public office only, except in some few\r\ncases: a provision, which is absolutely necessary; for nothing but an\r\nexclusive right can support an office of this sort: many rival\r\nindependent offices would only serve to ruin one another. The\r\nprivilege of letters coming free of postage, to and from members of\r\nparliament, was claimed by the house of commons in 1660, when the\r\nfirst legal settlement of the present post-office was made[u]; but\r\nafterwards dropped[w] upon a private assurance from the crown, that\r\nthis privilege should be allowed the members[x]. And accordingly a\r\nwarrant was constantly issued to the postmaster-general[y], directing\r\nthe allowance thereof, to to [Transcriber's Note: duplicate word] the\r\nextent of two ounces in weight: till at length it was expressly\r\nconfirmed by statute 4 Geo. III. c. 24; which adds many new\r\nregulations, rendered necessary by the great abuses crept into the\r\npractice of franking; whereby the annual amount of franked letters had\r\ngradually increased, from 23600_l._ in the year 1715, to 170700_l._ in\r\nthe year 1763[z]. There cannot be devised a more eligible method, than\r\nthis, of raising money upon the subject: for therein both the\r\ngovernment and the people find a mutual benefit. The government\r\nacquires a large revenue; and the people do their business with\r\ngreater ease, expedition, and cheapness, than they would be able to do\r\nif no such tax (and of course no such office) existed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: Com.

A FIFTH branch of the perpetual revenue consists in the stamp\r\nduties, which are a tax imposed upon all parchment and paper whereon\r\nany legal proceedings, or private instruments of almost any nature\r\nwhatsoever, are written; and also upon licences for retailing wines,\r\nof all denominations; upon all almanacks, newspapers, advertisements,\r\ncards, dice, and pamphlets containing less than six sheets of paper.\r\nThese imposts are very various, according to the nature of the thing\r\nstamped, rising gradually from a penny to ten pounds. This is also a\r\ntax, which though in some instances it may be heavily felt, by greatly\r\nincreasing the expence of all mercantile as well as legal proceedings,\r\nyet (if moderately imposed) is of service to the public in general, by\r\nauthenticating instruments, and rendering it much more difficult than\r\nformerly to forge deeds of any standing; since, as the officers of\r\nthis branch of the revenue vary their stamps frequently, by marks\r\nperceptible to none but themselves, a man that would forge a deed of\r\nking William's time, must know and be able to counterfeit the stamp of\r\nthat date also. In France and some other countries the duty is laid on\r\nthe contract itself, not on the instrument in which it is contained:\r\nbut this draws the subject into a thousand nice disquisitions and\r\ndisputes concerning the nature of his contract, and whether taxable or\r\nnot; in which the farmers of the revenue are sure to have the\r\nadvantage. Our method answers the purposes of the state as well, and\r\nconsults the ease of the subject much better. The first institution of\r\nthe stamp duties was by statute 5 & 6 W. & M. c. 21. and they have\r\nsince in many instances been encreased to five times their original\r\namount.\r\n\r\nVI. A SIXTH branch is the duty upon houses and windows. As early as\r\nthe conquest mention is made in domesday book of fumage or fuage,\r\nvulgarly called smoke farthings; which were paid by custom to the king\r\nfor every chimney in the house. And we read that Edward the black\r\nprince (soon after his successes in France) in imitation of the\r\nEnglish custom, imposed a tax of a florin upon every hearth in his\r\nFrench dominions[a]. But the first parliamentary establishment of it\r\nin England was by statute 13 & 14 Car. II. c. 10. whereby an\r\nhereditary revenue of 2_s._ for every hearth, in all houses paying to\r\nchurch and poor, was granted to the king for ever. And, by subsequent\r\nstatutes, for the more regular assessment of this tax, the constable\r\nand two other substantial inhabitants of the parish, to be appointed\r\nyearly, were, once in every year, empowered to view the inside of\r\nevery house in the parish. But, upon the revolution, by statute 1 W.\r\n& M. st. 1. c. 10. hearth-money was declared to be \"not only a great\r\noppression to the poorer sort, but a badge of slavery upon the whole\r\npeople, exposing every man's house to be entered into, and searched at\r\npleasure, by persons unknown to him; and therefore, to erect a lasting\r\nmonument of their majesties' goodness in every house in the kingdom,\r\nthe duty of hearth-money was taken away and abolished.\" This monument\r\nof goodness remains among us to this day: but the prospect of it was\r\nsomewhat darkened when, in six years afterwards, by statute 7 W. III.\r\nc. 18. a tax was laid upon all houses (except cottages) of 2_s._ now\r\nadvanced to 3_s._ _per_ house, and a tax also upon all windows, if\r\nthey exceed nine, in such house. Which rates have been from time to\r\ntime varied, (particularly by statutes 20 Geo. II. c. 3. and 31 Geo.\r\nII. c. 22.) and power is given to surveyors, appointed by the crown,\r\nto inspect the outside of houses, and also to pass through any house\r\ntwo days in the year, into any court or yard to inspect the windows\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: Mod. Un. Hist. xxiii. 463. Spelm. Gloss. _tit. Fuage_.]\r\n\r\nVII. THE seventh branch of the extraordinary perpetual revenue is the\r\nduty arising from licences to hackney coaches and chairs in London,\r\nand the parts adjacent. In 1654 two hundred hackney coaches were\r\nallowed within London, Westminster, and six miles round, under the\r\ndirection of the court of aldermen[b]. By statute 13 & 14 Car. II. c.\r\n2. four hundred were licensed; and the money arising thereby was\r\napplied to repairing the streets[c]. This number was increased to\r\nseven hundred by statute 5 W. & M. c. 22. and the duties vested in the\r\ncrown: and by the statute 9 Ann. c. 23. and other subsequent\r\nstatutes[d], there are now eight hundred licensed coaches and four\r\nhundred chairs. This revenue is governed by commissioners of it's own,\r\nand is, in truth, a benefit to the subject; as the expense of it is\r\nfelt by no individual, and it's necessary regulations have established\r\na competent jurisdiction, whereby a very refractory race of men may\r\nbe kept in some tolerable order.\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Scobell. 313.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Com. Journ. 14 Feb. 1661.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: 10 Ann. c. 19. §. 158. 12 Geo. I. c. 15. 33 Geo. II. c.\r\n25.]\r\n\r\nVIII. THE eighth and last branch of the king's extraordinary perpetual\r\nrevenue is the duty upon offices and pensions; consisting in a payment\r\nof 1_s._ in the pound (over and above all other duties) out of all\r\nsalaries, fees, and perquisites, of offices and pensions payable by\r\nthe crown. This highly popular taxation was imposed by statute 31 Geo.\r\nII. c. 22. and is under the direction of the commissioners of the land\r\ntax.\r\n\r\nTHE clear neat produce of these several branches of the revenue, after\r\nall charges of collecting and management paid, amounts annually to\r\nabout seven millions and three quarters sterling; besides two millions\r\nand a quarter raised annually, at an average, by the land and malt\r\ntax. How these immense sums are appropriated, is next to be\r\nconsidered. And this is, first and principally, to the payment of the\r\ninterest of the national debt.\r\n\r\nIN order to take a clear and comprehensive view of the nature of this\r\nnational debt, it must first be premised, that after the revolution,\r\nwhen our new connections with Europe introduced a new system of\r\nforeign politics, the expenses of the nation, not only in settling the\r\nnew establishment, but in maintaining long wars, as principals, on the\r\ncontinent, for the security of the Dutch barrier, reducing the French\r\nmonarchy, settling the Spanish succession, supporting the house of\r\nAustria, maintaining the liberties of the Germanic body, and other\r\npurposes, increased to an unusual degree: insomuch that it was not\r\nthought advisable to raise all the expenses of any one year by taxes\r\nto be levied within that year, lest the unaccustomed weight of them\r\nshould create murmurs among the people. It was therefore the policy of\r\nthe times, to anticipate the revenues of their posterity, by borrowing\r\nimmense sums for the current service of the state, and to lay no more\r\ntaxes upon the subject than would suffice to pay the annual interest\r\nof the sums so borrowed: by this means converting the principal debt\r\ninto a new species of property, transferrable from one man to another\r\nat any time and in any quantity. A system which seems to have had it's\r\noriginal in the state of Florence, _A.D._ 1344: which government then\r\nowed about 60000_l._ sterling; and, being unable to pay it, formed the\r\nprincipal into an aggregate sum, called metaphorically a _mount_ or\r\n_bank_, the shares whereof were transferrable like our stocks, with\r\ninterest at 5 _per cent._ the prices varying according to the\r\nexigencies of the state[e]. This laid the foundation of what is called\r\nthe national debt: for a few long annuities created in the reign of\r\nCharles II will hardly deserve that name. And the example then set has\r\nbeen so closely followed during the long wars in the reign of queen\r\nAnne, and since, that the capital of the national debt, (funded and\r\nunfunded) amounted in January 1765 to upwards of 145,000,000_l._ to\r\npay the interest of which, and the charges for management, amounting\r\nannually to about four millions and three quarters, the revenues just\r\nenumerated are in the first place mortgaged, and made perpetual by\r\nparliament. Perpetual, I say; but still redeemable by the same\r\nauthority that imposed them: which, if it at any time can pay off the\r\ncapital, will abolish those taxes which are raised to discharge the\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: _Pro tempore, pro spe, pro commodo, minuitur eorum\r\npretium atque augescit._ Aretin. See Mod. Un. Hist. xxxvi. 116.]\r\n\r\nBY this means the quantity of property in the kingdom is greatly\r\nencreased in idea, compared with former times; yet, if we coolly\r\nconsider it, not at all encreased in reality. We may boast of large\r\nfortunes, and quantities of money in the funds. But where does this\r\nmoney exist? It exists only in name, in paper, in public faith, in\r\nparliamentary security: and that is undoubtedly sufficient for the\r\ncreditors of the public to rely on. But then what is the pledge which\r\nthe public faith has pawned for the security of these debts? The land,\r\nthe trade, and the personal industry of the subject; from which the\r\nmoney must arise that supplies the several taxes. In these therefore,\r\nand these only, the property of the public creditors does really and\r\nintrinsically exist: and of course the land, the trade, and the\r\npersonal industry of individuals, are diminished in their true value\r\njust so much as they are pledged to answer. If A's income amounts to\r\n100_l._ _per annum_; and he is so far indebted to B, that he pays him\r\n50_l._ _per annum_ for his interest; one half of the value of A's\r\nproperty is transferred to B the creditor. The creditor's property\r\nexists in the demand which he has upon the debtor, and no where else;\r\nand the debtor is only a trustee to his creditor for one half of the\r\nvalue of his income. In short, the property of a creditor of the\r\npublick, consists in a certain portion of the national taxes: by how\r\nmuch therefore he is the richer, by so much the nation, which pays\r\nthese taxes, is the poorer.\r\n\r\nTHE only advantage, that can result to a nation from public debts, is\r\nthe encrease of circulation by multiplying the cash of the kingdom,\r\nand creating a new species of money, always ready to be employed in\r\nany beneficial undertaking, by means of it's transferrable quality;\r\nand yet productive of some profit, even when it lies idle and\r\nunemployed. A certain proportion of debt seems therefore to be highly\r\nuseful to a trading people; but what that proportion is, it is not for\r\nme to determine. Thus much is indisputably certain, that the present\r\nmagnitude of our national incumbrances very far exceeds all\r\ncalculations of commercial benefit, and is productive of the greatest\r\ninconveniences. For, first, the enormous taxes, that are raised upon\r\nthe necessaries of life for the payment of the interest of this debt,\r\nare a hurt both to trade and manufactures, by raising the price as\r\nwell of the artificer's subsistence, as of the raw material, and of\r\ncourse, in a much greater proportion, the price of the commodity\r\nitself. Secondly, if part of this debt be owing to foreigners, either\r\nthey draw out of the kingdom annually a considerable quantity of\r\nspecie for the interest; or else it is made an argument to grant them\r\nunreasonable privileges in order to induce them to reside here.\r\nThirdly, if the whole be owing to subjects only, it is then charging\r\nthe active and industrious subject, who pays his share of the taxes,\r\nto maintain the indolent and idle creditor who receives them. Lastly,\r\nand principally, it weakens the internal strength of a state, by\r\nanticipating those resources which should be reserved to defend it in\r\ncase of necessity. The interest we now pay for our debts would be\r\nnearly sufficient to maintain any war, that any national motives could\r\nrequire. And if our ancestors in king William's time had annually\r\npaid, so long as their exigences lasted, even a less sum than we now\r\nannually raise upon their accounts, they would in the time of war have\r\nborne no greater burdens, than they have bequeathed to and settled\r\nupon their posterity in time of peace; and might have been eased the\r\ninstant the exigence was over.\r\n\r\nTHE produce of the several taxes beforementioned were originally\r\nseparate and distinct funds; being securities for the sums advanced on\r\neach several tax, and for them only. But at last it became necessary,\r\nin order to avoid confusion, as they multiplied yearly, to reduce the\r\nnumber of these separate funds, by uniting and blending them together;\r\nsuperadding the faith of parliament for the general security of the\r\nwhole. So that there are now only three capital funds of any account,\r\nthe _aggregate_ fund, and the _general_ fund, so called from such\r\nunion and addition; and the _south sea_ fund, being the produce of the\r\ntaxes appropriated to pay the interest of such part of the national\r\ndebt as was advanced by that company and it's annuitants. Whereby the\r\nseparate funds, which were thus united, are become mutual securities\r\nfor each other; and the whole produce of them, thus aggregated, is\r\nliable to pay such interest or annuities as were formerly charged upon\r\neach distinct fund; the faith of the legislature being moreover\r\nengaged to supply any casual deficiences.\r\n\r\nTHE customs, excises, and other taxes, which are to support these\r\nfunds, depending on contingencies, upon exports, imports, and\r\nconsumptions, must necessarily be of a very uncertain amount; but they\r\nhave always been considerably more than was sufficient to answer the\r\ncharge upon them. The surplusses therefore of the three great national\r\nfunds, the aggregate, general, and south sea funds, over and above\r\nthe interest and annuities charged upon them, are directed by statute\r\n3 Geo. I. c. 7. to be carried together, and to attend the disposition\r\nof parliament; and are usually denominated the _sinking_ fund, because\r\noriginally destined to sink and lower the national debt. To this have\r\nbeen since added many other intire duties, granted in subsequent\r\nyears; and the annual interest of the sums borrowed on their\r\nrespective credits is charged on and payable out of the produce of the\r\nsinking fund. However the neat surplusses and savings, after all\r\ndeductions paid, amount annually to a very considerable sum;\r\nparticularly in the year ending at Christmas 1764, to about two\r\nmillions and a quarter. For, as the interest on the national debt has\r\nbeen at several times reduced, (by the consent of the proprietors, who\r\nhad their option either to lower their interest or be paid their\r\nprincipal) the savings from the appropriated revenues must needs be\r\nextremely large. This sinking fund is the last resort of the nation;\r\non which alone depend all the hopes we can entertain of ever\r\ndischarging or moderating our incumbrances. And therefore the prudent\r\napplication of the large sums, now arising from this fund, is a point\r\nof the utmost importance, and well worthy the serious attention of\r\nparliament; which has thereby been enabled, in this present year 1765,\r\nto reduce above two millions sterling of the public debt.\r\n\r\nBUT, before any part of the aggregate fund (the surplusses whereof are\r\none of the chief ingredients that form the sinking fund) can be\r\napplied to diminish the principal of the public debt, it stands\r\nmortgaged by parliament to raise an annual sum for the maintenance of\r\nthe king's houshold and the civil list. For this purpose, in the late\r\nreigns, the produce of certain branches of the excise and customs, the\r\npost-office, the duty on wine licences, the revenues of the remaining\r\ncrown lands, the profits arising from courts of justice, (which\r\narticles include all the hereditary revenues of the crown) and also a\r\nclear annuity of 120000_l._ in money, were settled on the king for\r\nlife, for the support of his majesty's houshold, and the honour and\r\ndignity of the crown. And, as the amount of these several branches\r\nwas uncertain, (though in the last reign they were generally computed\r\nto raise almost a million) if they did not arise annually to\r\n800,000_l._ the parliament engaged to make up the deficiency. But his\r\npresent majesty having, soon after his accession, spontaneously\r\nsignified his consent, that his own hereditary revenues might be so\r\ndisposed of as might best conduce to the utility and satisfaction of\r\nthe public, and having graciously accepted the limited sum of\r\n800000_l._ _per annum_ for the support of his civil list (and that\r\nalso charged with three life annuities, to the princess of Wales, the\r\nduke of Cumberland, and the princess Amalie, to the amount of\r\n77000_l._) the said hereditary and other revenues are now carried into\r\nand made a part of the aggregate fund, and the aggregate fund is\r\ncharged with the payment of the whole annuity to the crown of\r\n800000_l._ _per annum_[f]. Hereby the revenues themselves, being put\r\nunder the same care and management as the other branches of the public\r\npatrimony, will produce more and be better collected than heretofore;\r\nand the public is a gainer of upwards of 100000_l._ _per annum_ by\r\nthis disinterested bounty of his majesty. The civil list, thus\r\nliquidated, together with the four millions and three quarters,\r\ninterest of the national debt, and the two millions and a quarter\r\nproduced from the sinking fund, make up the seven millions and three\r\nquarters _per annum_, neat money, which were before stated to be the\r\nannual produce of our _perpetual_ taxes; besides the immense, though\r\nuncertain, sums arising from the _annual_ taxes on land and malt, but\r\nwhich, at an average, may be calculated at more than two millions and\r\na quarter; and, added to the preceding sum, make the clear produce of\r\nthe taxes, exclusive of the charge of collecting, which are raised\r\nyearly on the people of this country, and returned into the king's\r\nexchequer, amount to upwards of ten millions sterling.\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Stat. 1 Geo. III. c. 1.]\r\n\r\nTHE expences defrayed by the civil list are those that in any shape\r\nrelate to civil government; as, the expenses of the houshold; all\r\nsalaries to officers of state, to the judges, and every of the king's\r\nservants; the appointments to foreign embassadors; the maintenance of\r\nthe royal family; the king's private expenses, or privy purse; and\r\nother very numerous outgoings, as secret service money, pensions, and\r\nother bounties: which sometimes have so far exceeded the revenues\r\nappointed for that purpose, that application has been made to\r\nparliament to discharge the debts contracted on the civil list; as\r\nparticularly in 1724, when one million was granted for that purpose by\r\nthe statute 11 Geo. I. c. 17.\r\n\r\nTHE civil list is indeed properly the whole of the king's revenue in\r\nhis own distinct capacity; the rest being rather the revenue of the\r\npublic, or it's creditors, though collected, and distributed again, in\r\nthe name and by the officers of the crown: it now standing in the same\r\nplace, as the hereditary income did formerly; and, as that has\r\ngradually diminished, the parliamentary appointments have encreased.\r\nThe whole revenue of queen Elizabeth did not amount to more than\r\n600000_l._ a year[g]: that of king Charles I was[h] 800000_l._ and the\r\nrevenue voted for king Charles II was[i] 1200000_l._ though it never\r\nin fact amounted to quite so much[k]. But it must be observed, that\r\nunder these sums were included all manner of public expenses, among\r\nwhich lord Clarendon in his speech to the parliament computed that the\r\ncharge of the navy and land forces amounted annually to 800000_l._\r\nwhich was ten times more than before the former troubles[l]. The same\r\nrevenue, subject to the same charges, was settled on on [Transcriber's\r\nNote: duplicate word] king James II[m]: but by the encrease of trade,\r\nand more frugal management, it amounted on an average to a million and\r\nhalf _per annum_, (besides other additional customs, granted by\r\nparliament[n], which produced an annual revenue of 400000_l._) out of\r\nwhich his fleet and army were maintained at the yearly expense of[o]\r\n1100000_l._ After the revolution, when the parliament took into it's\r\nown hands the annual support of the forces, both maritime and\r\nmilitary, a civil list revenue was settled on the new king and queen,\r\namounting, with the hereditary duties, to 700000_l._ _per annum_[p];\r\nand the same was continued to queen Anne and king George I[q]. That of\r\nking George II, we have seen, was nominally augmented to[r] 800000_l._\r\nand in fact was considerably more. But that of his present majesty is\r\nexpressly limited to that sum; and, by reason of the charges upon it,\r\namounts at present to little more than 700000_l._ And upon the whole\r\nit is doubtless much better for the crown, and also for the people, to\r\nhave the revenue settled upon the modern footing rather than the\r\nantient. For the crown; because it is more certain, and collected with\r\ngreater ease: for the people; because they are now delivered from the\r\nfeodal hardships, and other odious branches of the prerogative. And\r\nthough complaints have sometimes been made of the encrease of the\r\ncivil list, yet if we consider the sums that have been formerly\r\ngranted, the limited extent under which it is now established, the\r\nrevenues and prerogatives given up in lieu of it by the crown, and\r\n(above all) the diminution of the value of money compared with what it\r\nwas worth in the last century, we must acknowlege these complaints to\r\nbe void of any rational foundation; and that it is impossible to\r\nsupport that dignity, which a king of Great Britain should maintain,\r\nwith an income in any degree less than what is now established by\r\nparliament.\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Lord Clar. continuation. 163.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Com. Journ. 4 Sept. 1660.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: _Ibid._ 4 Jun. 1663. Lord Clar. _ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: _Ibid._ 165.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: Stat. 1 Jac.

II. c. 1.]\r\n\r\nTHIS finishes our enquiries into the fiscal prerogatives of the king;\r\nor his revenue, both ordinary and extraordinary. We have therefore now\r\nchalked out all the principal outlines of this vast title of the law,\r\nthe supreme executive magistrate, or the king's majesty, considered in\r\nhis several capacities and points of view. But, before we intirely\r\ndismiss this subject, it may not be improper to take a short\r\ncomparative review of the power of the executive magistrate, or\r\nprerogative of the crown, as it stood in former days, and as it stands\r\nat present. And we cannot but observe, that most of the laws for\r\nascertaining, limiting, and restraining this prerogative have been\r\nmade within the compass of little more than a century past; from the\r\npetition of right in 3 Car. I. to the present time. So that the powers\r\nof the crown are now to all appearance greatly curtailed and\r\ndiminished since the reign of king James the first: particularly, by\r\nthe abolition of the star chamber and high commission courts in the\r\nreign of Charles the first, and by the disclaiming of martial law, and\r\nthe power of levying taxes on the subject, by the same prince: by the\r\ndisuse of forest laws for a century past: and by the many excellent\r\nprovisions enacted under Charles the second; especially, the abolition\r\nof military tenures, purveyance, and preemption; the _habeas corpus_\r\nact; and the act to prevent the discontinuance of parliaments for\r\nabove three years: and, since the revolution, by the strong and\r\nemphatical words in which our liberties are asserted in the bill of\r\nrights, and act of settlement; by the act for triennial, since turned\r\ninto septennial, elections; by the exclusion of certain officers from\r\nthe house of commons; by rendering the seats of the judges permanent,\r\nand their salaries independent; and by restraining the king's pardon\r\nfrom operating on parliamentary impeachments. Besides all this, if we\r\nconsider how the crown is impoverished and stripped of all it's\r\nantient revenues, so that it greatly depends on the liberality of\r\nparliament for it's necessary support and maintenance, we may perhaps\r\nbe led to think, that the ballance is enclined pretty strongly to the\r\npopular scale, and that the executive magistrate has neither\r\nindependence nor power enough left, to form that check upon the lords\r\nand commons, which the founders of our constitution intended.\r\n\r\nBUT, on the other hand, it is to be considered, that every prince, in\r\nthe first parliament after his accession, has by long usage a truly\r\nroyal addition to his hereditary revenue settled upon him for his\r\nlife; and has never any occasion to apply to parliament for supplies,\r\nbut upon some public necessity of the whole realm. This restores to\r\nhim that constitutional independence, which at his first accession\r\nseems, it must be owned, to be wanting. And then, with regard to\r\npower, we may find perhaps that the hands of government are at least\r\nsufficiently strengthened; and that an English monarch is now in no\r\ndanger of being overborne by either the nobility or the people. The\r\ninstruments of power are not perhaps so open and avowed as they\r\nformerly were, and therefore are the less liable to jealous and\r\ninvidious reflections; but they are not the weaker upon that account.\r\nIn short, our national debt and taxes (besides the inconveniences\r\nbefore-mentioned) have also in their natural consequences thrown such\r\na weight of power into the executive scale of government, as we cannot\r\nthink was intended by our patriot ancestors; who gloriously struggled\r\nfor the abolition of the then formidable parts of the prerogative; and\r\nby an unaccountable want of foresight established this system in their\r\nstead. The entire collection and management of so vast a revenue,\r\nbeing placed in the hands of the crown, have given rise to such a\r\nmultitude of new officers, created by and removeable at the royal\r\npleasure, that they have extended the influence of government to every\r\ncorner of the nation. Witness the commissioners, and the multitude of\r\ndependents on the customs, in every port of the kingdom; the\r\ncommissioners of excise, and their numerous subalterns, in every\r\ninland district; the postmasters, and their servants, planted in every\r\ntown, and upon every public road; the commissioners of the stamps, and\r\ntheir distributors, which are full as scattered and full as numerous;\r\nthe officers of the salt duty, which, though a species of excise and\r\nconducted in the same manner, are yet made a distinct corps from the\r\nordinary managers of that revenue; the surveyors of houses and\r\nwindows; the receivers of the land tax; the managers of lotteries; and\r\nthe commissioners of hackney coaches; all which are either mediately\r\nor immediately appointed by the crown, and removeable at pleasure\r\nwithout any reason assigned: these, it requires but little penetration\r\nto see, must give that power, on which they depend for subsistence, an\r\ninfluence most amazingly extensive. To this may be added the frequent\r\nopportunities of conferring particular obligations, by preference in\r\nloans, subscriptions, tickets, remittances, and other money-transactions,\r\nwhich will greatly encrease this influence; and that over those\r\npersons whose attachment, on account of their wealth, is frequently\r\nthe most desirable. All this is the natural, though perhaps the\r\nunforeseen, consequence of erecting our funds of credit, and to\r\nsupport them establishing our present perpetual taxes: the whole of\r\nwhich is entirely new since the restoration in 1660; and by far the\r\ngreatest part since the revolution in 1688. And the same may be said\r\nwith regard to the officers in our numerous army, and the places which\r\nthe army has created. All which put together gives the executive power\r\nso persuasive an energy with respect to the persons themselves, and so\r\nprevailing an interest with their friends and families, as will amply\r\nmake amends for the loss of external prerogative.\r\n\r\nBUT, though this profusion of offices should have no effect on\r\nindividuals, there is still another newly acquired branch of power;\r\nand that is, not the influence only, but the force of a disciplined\r\narmy: paid indeed ultimately by the people, but immediately by the\r\ncrown; raised by the crown, officered by the crown, commanded by the\r\ncrown. They are kept on foot it is true only from year to year, and\r\nthat by the power of parliament: but during that year they must, by\r\nthe nature of our constitution, if raised at all, be at the absolute\r\ndisposal of the crown. And there need but few words to demonstrate how\r\ngreat a trust is thereby reposed in the prince by his people. A trust,\r\nthat is more than equivalent to a thousand little troublesome\r\nprerogatives.\r\n\r\nADD to all this, that, besides the civil list, the immense revenue of\r\nseven millions sterling, which is annually paid to the creditors of\r\nthe publick, or carried to the sinking fund, is first deposited in the\r\nroyal exchequer, and thence issued out to the respective offices of\r\npayment. This revenue the people can never refuse to raise, because it\r\nis made perpetual by act of parliament: which also, when well\r\nconsidered, will appear to be a trust of great delicacy and high\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nUPON the whole therefore I think it is clear, that, whatever may have\r\nbecome of the _nominal_, the _real_ power of the crown has not been\r\ntoo far weakened by any transactions in the last century. Much is\r\nindeed given up; but much is also acquired. The stern commands of\r\nprerogative have yielded to the milder voice of influence; the slavish\r\nand exploded doctrine of non-resistance has given way to a military\r\nestablishment by law; and to the disuse of parliaments has succeeded a\r\nparliamentary trust of an immense perpetual revenue. When, indeed, by\r\nthe free operation of the sinking fund, our national debts shall be\r\nlessened; when the posture of foreign affairs, and the universal\r\nintroduction of a well planned and national militia, will suffer our\r\nformidable army to be thinned and regulated; and when (in consequence\r\nof all) our taxes shall be gradually reduced; this adventitious power\r\nof the crown will slowly and imperceptibly diminish, as it slowly and\r\nimperceptibly rose. But, till that shall happen, it will be our\r\nespecial duty, as good subjects and good Englishmen, to reverence the\r\ncrown, and yet guard against corrupt and servile influence from those\r\nwho are intrusted with it's authority; to be loyal, yet free;\r\nobedient, and yet independent: and, above every thing, to hope that we\r\nmay long, very long, continue to be governed by a sovereign, who, in\r\nall those public acts that have personally proceeded from himself,\r\nhath manifested the highest veneration for the free constitution of\r\nBritain; hath already in more than one instance remarkably\r\nstrengthened it's outworks; and will therefore never harbour a\r\nthought, or adopt a persuasion, in any the remotest degree detrimental\r\nto public liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE NINTH.\r\n\r\nOF SUBORDINATE MAGISTRATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN a former chapter of these commentaries[a] we distinguished\r\nmagistrates into two kinds; supreme, or those in whom the sovereign\r\npower of the state resides; and subordinate, or those who act in an\r\ninferior secondary sphere. We have hitherto considered the former kind\r\nonly, namely, the supreme legislative power or parliament, and the\r\nsupreme executive power, which is the king: and are now to proceed to\r\nenquire into the rights and duties of the principal subordinate\r\nmagistrates.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: ch. 2. pag. 142.]\r\n\r\nAND herein we are not to investigate the powers and duties of his\r\nmajesty's great officers of state, the lord treasurer, lord\r\nchamberlain, the principal secretaries, or the like; because I do not\r\nknow that they are in that capacity in any considerable degree the\r\nobjects of our laws, or have any very important share of magistracy\r\nconferred upon them: except that the secretaries of state are allowed\r\nthe power of commitment, in order to bring offenders to trial[b].\r\nNeither shall I here treat of the office and authority of the lord\r\nchancellor, or the other judges of the superior courts of justice;\r\nbecause they will find a more proper place in the third part of these\r\ncommentaries. Nor shall I enter into any minute disquisitions, with\r\nregard to the rights and dignities of mayors and aldermen, or other\r\nmagistrates of particular corporations; because these are mere private\r\nand strictly municipal rights, depending entirely upon the domestic\r\nconstitution of their respective franchises. But the magistrates and\r\nofficers, whose rights and duties it will be proper in this chapter to\r\nconsider, are such as are generally in use and have a jurisdiction and\r\nauthority dispersedly throughout the kingdom: which are, principally,\r\nsheriffs; coroners; justices of the peace; constables; surveyors of\r\nhighways; and overseers of the poor. In treating of all which I shall\r\nenquire into, first, their antiquity and original; next, the manner in\r\nwhich they are appointed and may be removed; and, lastly, their rights\r\nand duties. And first of sheriffs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: 1 Leon. 70. 2 Leon. 175. Comb. 343. 5 Mod. 84. Salk.\r\n347.]\r\n\r\nI. THE sheriff is an officer of very great antiquity in this kingdom,\r\nhis name being derived from two Saxon words, shire reeve, the bailiff\r\nor officer of the shire. He is called in Latin _vice-comes_, as being\r\nthe deputy of the earl or _comes_; to whom the custody of the shire is\r\nsaid to have been committed at the first division of this kingdom into\r\ncounties. But the earls in process of time, by reason of their high\r\nemployments and attendance on the king's person, not being able to\r\ntransact the business of the county, were delivered of that burden[c];\r\nreserving to themselves the honour, but the labour was laid on the\r\nsheriff. So that now the sheriff does all the king's business in the\r\ncounty; and though he be still called _vice-comes_, yet he is entirely\r\nindependent of, and not subject to the earl; the king by his letters\r\npatent committing _custodiam comitatus_ to the sheriff, and him alone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Dalton of sheriffs, c. 1.]\r\n\r\nSHERIFFS were formerly chosen by the inhabitants of the several\r\ncounties. In confirmation of which it was ordained by statute 28 Edw.\r\nI. c. 8. that the people should have election of sheriffs in every\r\nshire, where the shrievalty is not of inheritance. For antiently in\r\nsome counties, particularly on the borders, the sheriffs were\r\nhereditary; as I apprehend they are in Scotland, and in the county of\r\nWestmorland, to this day: and the city of London has also the\r\ninheritance of the shrievalty of Middlesex vested in their body by\r\ncharter[d]. The reason of these popular elections is assigned in the\r\nsame statute, c. 13. \"that the commons might chuse such as would not\r\nbe a burthen to them.\" And herein appears plainly a strong trace of\r\nthe democratical part of our constitution; in which form of government\r\nit is an indispensable requisite, that the people should chuse their\r\nown magistrates[e]. This election was in all probability not\r\nabsolutely vested in the commons, but required the royal approbation.\r\nFor in the Gothic constitution, the judges of their county courts\r\n(which office is executed by our sheriff) were elected by the people,\r\nbut confirmed by the king: and the form of their election was thus\r\nmanaged; the people, or _incolae territorii_, chose _twelve_ electors,\r\nand they nominated _three_ persons, _ex quibus rex unum\r\nconfirmabat_[f]. But, with us in England, these popular elections,\r\ngrowing tumultuous, were put an end to by the statute 9 Edw. II. st.\r\n2. which enacted, that the sheriffs should from thenceforth be\r\nassigned by the lord chancellor, treasurer, and the judges; as being\r\npersons in whom the same trust might with confidence be reposed. By\r\nstatutes 14 Edw. III. c. 7. and 23 Hen. VI. c. 8. the chancellor,\r\ntreasurer, _chief_ justices, and _chief_ baron, are to make this\r\nelection; and that on the morrow of All Souls in the exchequer. But\r\nthe custom now is (and has been at least ever since the time of\r\nFortescue[g], who was chief justice and chancellor to Henry the sixth)\r\nthat _all_ the judges, and certain other great officers, meet in the\r\nexchequer chamber on the morrow of All Souls yearly, (which day is now\r\naltered to the morrow of St. Martin by the act for abbreviating\r\nMichaelmas term) and then and there nominate three persons to the\r\nking, who afterwards appoints one of them to be sheriff. This custom,\r\nof the _twelve_ judges nominating _three_ persons, seems borrowed from\r\nthe Gothic constitution beforementioned; with this difference, that\r\namong the Goths the twelve nominors were first elected by the people\r\nthemselves. And this usage of ours at it's first introduction, I am\r\napt to believe, was founded upon some statute, though not now to be\r\nfound among our printed laws: first, because it is materially\r\ndifferent from the directions of all the statutes beforementioned;\r\nwhich it is hard to conceive that the judges would have countenanced\r\nby their concurrence, or that Fortescue would have inserted in his\r\nbook, unless by the authority of some statute: and also, because a\r\nstatute is expressly referred to in the record, which sir Edward Coke\r\ntells us[h] he transcribed from the council book of 3 Mar. 34 Hen. VI.\r\nand which is in substance as follows. The king had of his own\r\nauthority appointed a man sheriff of Lincolnshire, which office he\r\nrefused to take upon him: whereupon the opinions of the judges were\r\ntaken, what should be done in this behalf. And the two chief justices,\r\nsir John Fortescue and sir John Prisot, delivered the unanimous\r\nopinion of them all; \"that the king did an error when he made a person\r\nsheriff, that was not chosen and presented to him according to the\r\n_statute_; that the person refusing was liable to no fine for\r\ndisobedience, as if he had been one of the _three_ persons chosen\r\naccording to the tenor of the _statute_; that they would advise the\r\nking to have recourse to the _three_ persons that were chosen\r\naccording to the _statute_, or that some other thrifty man be\r\nintreated to occupy the office for this year; and that, the next year,\r\nto eschew such inconveniences, the order of the _statute_ in this\r\nbehalf made be observed.\" But, notwithstanding this unanimous\r\nresolution of all the judges of England, thus entered in the council\r\nbook, some of our writers[i] have affirmed, that the king, by his\r\nprerogative, may name whom he pleases to be sheriff, whether chosen by\r\nthe judges or no. This is grounded on a very particular case in the\r\nfifth year of queen Elizabeth, when, by reason of the plague, there\r\nwas no Michaelmas term kept at Westminster; so that the judges could\r\nnot meet there _in crastino Animarum_ to nominate the sheriffs:\r\nwhereupon the queen named them herself, without such previous\r\nassembly, appointing for the most part one of the two remaining in the\r\nlast year's list[k]. And this case, thus circumstanced, is the only\r\nprecedent in our books for the making these extraordinary sheriffs. It\r\nis true, the reporter adds, that it was held that the queen by her\r\nprerogative might make a sheriff without the election of the judges,\r\n_non obstante aliquo statuto in contrarium_: but the doctrine of _non\r\nobstante_'s, which sets the prerogative above the laws, was\r\neffectually demolished by the bill of rights at the revolution, and\r\nabdicated Westminster-hall when king James abdicated the kingdom. So\r\nthat sheriffs cannot now be legally appointed, otherwise than\r\naccording to the known and established law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: 3 Rep. 72.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Montesq. Sp. L. b. 2. c. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Stiernhook _de jure Goth._ _l._ 1. _c._ 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: _de L.L._ _c._ 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: 2 Inst. 559.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: Jenkins. 229.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Dyer 225.]\r\n\r\nSHERIFFS, by virtue of several old statutes, are to continue in their\r\noffice no longer than one year; and yet it hath been said[l] that a\r\nsheriff may be appointed _durante bene placito_, or during the king's\r\npleasure; and so is the form of the royal writ[m]. Therefore, till a\r\nnew sheriff be named, his office cannot be determined, unless by his\r\nown death, or the demise of the king; in which last case it was usual\r\nfor the successor to send a new writ to the old sheriff[n]: but now by\r\nstatute 1 Ann. st. 1. c. 8. all officers appointed by the preceding\r\nking may hold their offices for six months after the king's demise,\r\nunless sooner displaced by the successor. We may farther observe, that\r\nby statute 1 Ric. II. c. 11. no man, that has served the office of\r\nsheriff for one year, can be compelled to serve the same again within\r\nthree years after.\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: 4 Rep. 32.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: Dalt. of sheriffs. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: Dalt. 7.]\r\n\r\nWE shall find it is of the utmost importance to have the sheriff\r\nappointed according to law, when we consider his power and duty. These\r\nare either as a judge, as the keeper of the king's peace, as a\r\nministerial officer of the superior courts of justice, or as the\r\nking's bailiff.\r\n\r\nIN his judicial capacity he is to hear and determine all causes of\r\nforty shillings value and under, in his county court, of which more in\r\nit's proper place: and he has also judicial power in divers other\r\ncivil cases[o]. He is likewise to decide the elections of knights of\r\nthe shire, (subject to the control of the house of commons) of\r\ncoroners, and of verderors; to judge of the qualification of voters,\r\nand to return such as he shall determine to be duly elected.\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: Dalt. c. 4.]\r\n\r\nAS the keeper of the king's peace, both by common law and special\r\ncommission, he is the first man in the county, and superior in rank to\r\nany nobleman therein, during his office[p]. He may apprehend, and\r\ncommit to prison, all persons who break the peace, or attempt to break\r\nit: and may bind any one in a recognizance to keep the king's peace.\r\nHe may, and is bound _ex officio_ to, pursue and take all traitors,\r\nmurderers, felons, and other misdoers, and commit them to gaol for\r\nsafe custody. He is also to defend his county against any of the\r\nking's enemies when they come into the land: and for this purpose, as\r\nwell as for keeping the peace and pursuing felons, he may command all\r\nthe people of his county to attend him; which is called the _posse\r\ncomitatus_, or power of the county[q]: which summons every person\r\nabove fifteen years old, and under the degree of a peer, is bound to\r\nattend upon warning[r], under pain of fine and imprisonment[s]. But\r\nthough the sheriff is thus the principal conservator of the peace in\r\nhis county, yet, by the express directions of the great charter[t],\r\nhe, together with the constable, coroner, and certain other officers\r\nof the king, are forbidden to hold any pleas of the crown, or, in\r\nother words, to try any criminal offence. For it would be highly\r\nunbecoming, that the executioners of justice should be also the\r\njudges; should impose, as well as levy, fines and amercements; should\r\none day condemn a man to death, and personally execute him the next.\r\nNeither may he act as an ordinary justice of the peace during the time\r\nof his office[u]: for this would be equally inconsistent; he being in\r\nmany respects the servant of the justices.\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: 1 Roll. Rep. 237.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: Dalt. c. 95.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Lamb. Eiren. 315.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: Stat. 2 Hen. V. c. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: _cap._ 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: Stat. 1 Mar. st. 2. c. 8.]\r\n\r\nIN his ministerial capacity the sheriff is bound to execute all\r\nprocess issuing from the king's courts of justice. In the commencement\r\nof civil causes, he is to serve the writ, to arrest, and to take bail;\r\nwhen the cause comes to trial, he must summon and return the jury;\r\nwhen it is determined, he must see the judgment of the court carried\r\ninto execution. In criminal matters, he also arrests and imprisons, he\r\nreturns the jury, he has the custody of the delinquent, and he\r\nexecutes the sentence of the court, though it extend to death itself.\r\n\r\nAS the king's bailiff, it is his business to preserve the rights of\r\nthe king within his bailiwick; for so his county is frequently called\r\nin the writs: a word introduced by the princes of the Norman line; in\r\nimitation of the French, whose territory is divided into bailiwicks,\r\nas that of England into counties[w]. He must seise to the king's use\r\nall lands devolved to the crown by attainder or escheat; must levy all\r\nfines and forfeitures; must seise and keep all waifs, wrecks, estrays,\r\nand the like, unless they be granted to some subject; and must also\r\ncollect the king's rents within his bailiwick, if commanded by process\r\nfrom the exchequer[x].\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: Fortesc. _de L.L._ c. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: Dalt. c. 9.]\r\n\r\nTO execute these various offices, the sheriff has under him many\r\ninferior officers; an under-sheriff, bailiffs, and gaolers; who must\r\nneither buy, sell, nor farm their offices, on forfeiture of 500_l._[y]\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Stat. 3 Geo. I. c. 15.]\r\n\r\nTHE under-sheriff usually performs all the duties of the office; a\r\nvery few only excepted, where the personal presence of the\r\nhigh-sheriff is necessary. But no under-sheriff shall abide in his\r\noffice above one year[z]; and if he does, by statute 23 Hen. VI. c. 8.\r\nhe forfeits 200_l._ a very large penalty in those early days. And no\r\nunder-sheriff or sheriff's officer shall practice as an attorney,\r\nduring the time he continues in such office[a]: for this would be a\r\ngreat inlet to partiality and oppression. But these salutary\r\nregulations are shamefully evaded, by practising in the names of other\r\nattorneys, and putting in sham deputies by way of nominal\r\nunder-sheriffs: by reason of which, says Dalton[b], the under-sheriffs\r\nand bailiffs do grow so cunning in their several places, that they are\r\nable to deceive, and it may be well feared that many of them do\r\ndeceive, both the king, the high-sheriff, and the county.\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: Stat. 42 Edw. III. c. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: Stat. 1 Hen. V. c. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: of sheriffs, c. 115.]\r\n\r\nBAILIFFS, or sheriff's officers, are either bailiffs of hundreds, or\r\nspecial bailiffs. Bailiffs of hundreds are officers appointed over\r\nthose respective districts by the sheriffs, to collect fines therein;\r\nto summon juries; to attend the judges and justices at the assises,\r\nand quarter sessions; and also to execute writs and process in the\r\nseveral hundreds. But, as these are generally plain men, and not\r\nthoroughly skilful in this latter part of their office, that of\r\nserving writs, and making arrests and executions, it is now usual to\r\njoin special bailiffs with them; who are generally mean persons\r\nemployed by the sheriffs on account only of their adroitness and\r\ndexterity in hunting and seising their prey. The sheriff being\r\nanswerable for the misdemesnors of these bailiffs, they are therefore\r\nusually bound in a bond for the due execution of their office, and\r\nthence are called bound-bailiffs; which the common people have\r\ncorrupted into a much more homely appellation.\r\n\r\nGAOLERS are also the servants of the sheriff, and he must be\r\nresponsible for their conduct. Their business is to keep safely all\r\nsuch persons as are committed to them by lawful warrant: and, if they\r\nsuffer any such to escape, the sheriff shall answer it to the king, if\r\nit be a criminal matter; or, in a civil case, to the party injured[c].\r\nAnd to this end the sheriff must[d] have lands sufficient within the\r\ncounty to answer the king and his people. The abuses of goalers and\r\nsheriff's officers toward the unfortunate persons in their custody are\r\nwell restrained and guarded against by statute 32 Geo. II. c. 28.\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Dalt. c. 118. 4 Rep. 34.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: Stat. 13 & 14 Car. II. c. 21.]\r\n\r\nTHE vast expense, which custom had introduced in serving the office of\r\nhigh-sheriff, was grown such a burthen to the subject, that it was\r\nenacted, by statute 13 & 14 Car. II. c. 21. that no sheriff should\r\nkeep any table at the assises, except for his own family, or give any\r\npresents to the judges or their servants, or have more than forty men\r\nin livery; yet, for the sake of safety and decency, he may not have\r\nless than twenty men in England and twelve in Wales; upon forfeiture,\r\nin any of these cases, of 200_l._\r\n\r\nII. THE coroner's is also a very antient office at the common law. He\r\nis called coroner, _coronator_, because he hath principally to do with\r\npleas of the crown, or such wherein the king is more immediately\r\nconcerned[e]. And in this light the lord chief justice of the king's\r\nbench is the principal coroner in the kingdom, and may (if he pleases)\r\nexercise the jurisdiction of a coroner in any part of the realm[f].\r\nBut there are also particular coroners for every county of England;\r\nusually four, but sometimes six, and sometimes fewer[g]. This\r\nofficer[h] is of equal antiquity with the sheriff; and was ordained\r\ntogether with him to keep the peace, when the earls gave up the\r\nwardship of the county.\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: 2 Inst. 31. 4 Inst. 271.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: 4 Rep. 57.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: F.N.B. 163.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Mirror, c. 1. §. 3.]\r\n\r\nHE is still chosen by all the freeholders in the county court, as by\r\nthe policy of our antient laws the sheriffs, and conservators of the\r\npeace, and all other officers were, who were concerned in matters that\r\naffected the liberty of the people[i]; and as verderors of the forests\r\nstill are, whose business it is to stand between the prerogative and\r\nthe subject in the execution of the forest laws. For this purpose\r\nthere is a writ at common law _de coronatore eligendo_[k]: in which\r\nit is expressly commanded the sheriff, \"_quod talem eligi faciat, qui\r\nmelius et sciat, et velit, et possit, officio illi intendere_.\" And,\r\nin order to effect this the more surely, it was enacted by the statute\r\nof Westm. I[l], that none but lawful and discreet knights should be\r\nchosen. But it seems it is now sufficient if a man have lands enough\r\nto be made a knight, whether he be really knighted or not[m]: and\r\nthere was an instance in the 5 Edw. III. of a man being removed from\r\nthis office, because he was only a merchant[n]. The coroner ought also\r\nto have estate sufficient to maintain the dignity of his office, and\r\nanswer any fines that may be set upon him for his misbehaviour[o]: and\r\nif he have not enough to answer, his fine shall be levyed on the\r\ncounty, as a punishment for electing an insufficient officer[p]. Now\r\nindeed, through the culpable neglect of gentlemen of property, this\r\noffice has been suffered to fall into disrepute, and get into low and\r\nindigent hands: so that, although formerly no coroner would condescend\r\nto be paid for serving his country, and they were by the aforesaid\r\nstatute of Westm. I. expressly forbidden to take a reward, under pain\r\nof great forfeiture to the king; yet for many years past they have\r\nonly desired to be chosen for the sake of their perquisites; being\r\nallowed fees for their attendance by the statute 3 Hen. VII. c. 1.\r\nwhich sir Edward Coke complains of heavily[q]; though they have since\r\nhis time been much enlarged[r].\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: 2 Inst. 558.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: F.N.B. 163.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: 3 Edw. I. c. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: F.N.B. 163, 164.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: 2 Inst. 32.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: F.N.B. 163, 164.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: Mirr. c. 1. §. 3. 2 Inst. 175.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: 2 Inst. 210.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Stat. 25 Geo. II. c. 29.]\r\n\r\nTHE coroner is chosen for life: but may be removed, either by being\r\nmade sheriff, or chosen verderor, which are offices incompatible with\r\nthe other; or by the king's writ _de coronatore exonerando_, for a\r\ncause to be therein assigned, as that he is engaged in other business,\r\nis incapacitated by years or sickness, hath not a sufficient estate in\r\nthe county, or lives in an inconvenient part of it[s]. And by the\r\nstatute 25 Geo. II. c. 29. extortion, neglect, or misbehaviour, are\r\nalso made causes of removal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: F.N.B. 163, 164.]\r\n\r\nTHE office and power of a coroner are also, like those of a sheriff,\r\neither judicial or ministerial; but principally judicial. This is in\r\ngreat measure ascertained by statute 4 Edw. I. _de officio\r\ncoronatoris_; and consists, first, in enquiring (when any person is\r\nslain or dies suddenly) concerning the manner of his death. And this\r\nmust be \"_super visum corporis_[t];\" for, if the body be not found,\r\nthe coroner cannot sit[u]. He must also sit at the very place where\r\nthe death happened; and his enquiry is made by a jury from four, five,\r\nor six of the neighbouring towns, over whom he is to preside. If any\r\nbe found guilty by this inquest of murder, he is to commit to prison\r\nfor further trial, and is also to enquire concerning their lands,\r\ngoods and chattels, which are forfeited thereby: but, whether it be\r\nmurder or not, he must enquire whether any deodand has accrued to the\r\nking, or the lord of the franchise, by this death: and must certify\r\nthe whole of this inquisition to the court of king's bench, or the\r\nnext assises. Another branch of his office is to enquire concerning\r\nshipwrecks; and certify whether wreck or not, and who is in possession\r\nof the goods. Concerning treasure trove, he is also to enquire who\r\nwere the finders, and where it is, and whether any one be suspected of\r\nhaving found and concealed a treasure; \"and that may be well perceived\r\n(saith the old statute of Edw. I.) where one liveth riotously,\r\nhaunting taverns, and hath done so of long time:\" whereupon he might\r\nbe attached, and held to bail, upon this suspicion only.\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: 4 Inst. 271.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: Thus, in the Gothic constitution, before any fine was\r\npayable by the neighbourhood, for the slaughter of a man therein, \"_de\r\ncorpore delicti constare oportebat; i.e. non tam fuisse aliquem in\r\nterritorio isto mortuum inventum, quam vulneratum et caesum. Potest\r\nenim homo etiam ex alia causa subito mori_.\" Stiernhook _de jure\r\nGothor._ _l._ 3. _c._ 4.]\r\n\r\nTHE ministerial office of the coroner is only as the sheriff's\r\nsubstitute. For when just exception can be taken to the sheriff, for\r\nsuspicion of partiality, (as that he is interested in the suit, or of\r\nkindred to either plaintiff or defendant) the process must then be\r\nawarded to the coroner, instead of the sheriff, for execution of the\r\nking's writs[w].\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: 4 Inst. 271.]\r\n\r\nIII. THE next species of subordinate magistrates, whom I am to\r\nconsider, are justices of the peace; the principal of whom is the\r\n_custos rotulorum_, or keeper of the records of the county. The common\r\nlaw hath ever had a special care and regard for the conservation of\r\nthe peace; for peace is the very end and foundation of civil society.\r\nAnd therefore, before the present constitution of justices was\r\ninvented, there were peculiar officers appointed by the common law for\r\nthe maintenance of the public peace. Of these some had, and still\r\nhave, this power annexed to other offices which they hold; others had\r\nit merely by itself, and were thence named _custodes_ or\r\n_conservatores pacis_. Those that were so _virtute officii_ still\r\ncontinue; but the latter sort are superseded by the modern justices.\r\n\r\nTHE kings majesty[x] is, by his office and dignity royal, the\r\nprincipal conservator of the peace within all his dominions; and may\r\ngive authority to any other to see the peace kept, and to punish such\r\nas break it: hence it is usually called the king's peace. The lord\r\nchancellor or keeper, the lord treasurer, the lord high steward of\r\nEngland, the lord mareschal, and lord high constable of England (when\r\nany such officers are in being) and all the justices of the court of\r\nking's bench (by virtue of their offices) and the master of the rolls\r\n(by prescription) are general conservators of the peace throughout the\r\nwhole kingdom, and may commit all breakers of it, or bind them in\r\nrecognizances to keep it[y]: the other judges are only so in their own\r\ncourts. The coroner is also a conservator of the peace within his own\r\ncounty[z]; as is also the sheriff[a]; and both of them may take a\r\nrecognizance or security for the peace. Constables, tythingmen, and\r\nthe like, are also conservators of the peace within their own\r\njurisdictions; and may apprehend all breakers of the peace, and commit\r\nthem till they find sureties for their keeping it[b].\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: Lambard. Eirenarch. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Lamb. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: Britton. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: F.N.B. 81.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Lamb. 14.]\r\n\r\nTHOSE that were, without any office, simply and merely conservators of\r\nthe peace, were chosen by the freeholders in full county court before\r\nthe sheriff; the writ for their election directing them to be chosen\r\n\"_de probioribus et melioribus in comitatu suo in custodes pacis_[c].\"\r\nBut when queen Isabel, the wife of Edward II, had contrived to depose\r\nher husband by a forced resignation of the crown, and had set up his\r\nson Edward III in his place; this, being a thing then without example\r\nin England, it was feared would much alarm the people; especially as\r\nthe old king was living, though hurried about from castle to castle;\r\ntill at last he met with an untimely death. To prevent therefore any\r\nrisings, or other disturbance of the peace, the new king sent writs to\r\nall the sheriffs in England, the form of which is preserved by Thomas\r\nWalsingham[d], giving a plausible account of the manner of his\r\nobtaining the crown; to wit, that it was done _ipsius patris\r\nbeneplacito_: and withal commanding each sheriff that the peace be\r\nkept throughout his bailiwick, on pain and peril of disinheritance and\r\nloss of life and limb. And in a few weeks after the date of these\r\nwrits, it was ordained in parliament[e], that, for the better\r\nmaintaining and keeping of the peace in every county, good men and\r\nlawful, which were no maintainers of evil, or barretors in the\r\ncountry, should be _assigned_ to keep the peace. And in this manner,\r\nand upon this occasion, was the election of the conservators of the\r\npeace taken from the people, and given to the king[f]; this assignment\r\nbeing construed to be by the king's commission[g]. But still they were\r\ncalled only conservators, wardens, or keepers of the peace, till the\r\nstatute 34 Edw. III. c. 1. gave them the power of trying felonies; and\r\nthen they acquired the more honorable appellation of justices[h].\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Lamb. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: Hist. _A.D._ 1327.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Stat. 1 Edw. III. c. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Lamb. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Stat. 4 Edw. III. c. 2. and 18 Edw. III. st. 2. c. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Lamb. 23.]\r\n\r\nTHESE justices are appointed by the king's special commission under\r\nthe great seal, the form of which was settled by all the judges,\r\n_A.D._ 1590[i]. This appoints them all[k], jointly and severally, to\r\nkeep the peace, and any two or more of them to enquire of and\r\ndetermine felonies, and other misdemesnors: in which number some\r\nparticular justices, or one of them, are directed to be always\r\nincluded, and no business to be done without their presence; the words\r\nof the commission running thus, \"_quorum aliquem vestrum, A. B. C. D.\r\n&c. unum esse volumus_;\" whence the persons so named are usually\r\ncalled justices of the _quorum_. And formerly it was customary to\r\nappoint only a select number of justices, eminent for their skill and\r\ndiscretion, to be of the _quorum_; but now the practice is to advance\r\nalmost all of them to that dignity, naming them all over again in the\r\n_quorum_ clause, except perhaps only some one inconsiderable person\r\nfor the sake of propriety: and no exception is now allowable, for not\r\nexpressing in the form of warrants, &c, that the justice who issued\r\nthem is of the _quorum_[l].\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: Lamb. 43.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: See the form itself, Lamb. 35. Burn. tit. justices, §.\r\n1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: Stat. 26 Geo. II. c. 27.]\r\n\r\nTOUCHING the number and qualifications of these justices; it was\r\nordained by statute 18 Edw. III. c. 2. that _two_, or _three_, of the\r\nbest reputation in each county shall be assigned to be keepers of the\r\npeace. But these being found rather too few for that purpose, it was\r\nprovided by statute 34 Edw. III. c. 1. that one lord, and three, or\r\nfour, of the most worthy men in the county, with some learned in the\r\nlaw, shall be made justices in every county. But afterwards the number\r\nof justices, through the ambition of private persons, became so large,\r\nthat it was thought necessary by statute 12 Ric. II. c. 10. and 14 Ric\r\nII. c. 11. to restrain them at first to six, and afterwards to eight\r\nonly. But this rule is now disregarded, and the cause seems to be (as\r\nLambard observed long ago[m]) that the growing number of statute\r\nlaws, committed from time to time to the charge of justices of the\r\npeace, have occasioned also (and very reasonably) their encrease to a\r\nlarger number. And, as to their qualifications, the statutes just\r\ncited direct them to be of the best reputation, and most worthy men in\r\nthe county: and the statute 13 Ric. II. c. 10. orders them to be of\r\nthe most sufficient knights, esquires, and gentlemen of the law. Also\r\nby statute 2 Hen. V. st. 1. c. 4. and st. 2. c. 1. they must be\r\nresident in their several counties. And because, contrary to these\r\nstatutes, men of small substance had crept into the commission, whose\r\npoverty made them both covetous and contemptible, it was enacted by\r\nstatute 18 Hen. VI. c. 11. that no justice should be put in\r\ncommission, if he had not lands to the value of 20_l._ _per annum_.\r\nAnd, the rate of money being greatly altered since that time, it is\r\nnow enacted by statute 5 Geo. II. c. 11. that every justice, except as\r\nis therein excepted, shall have 100_l._ _per annum_ clear of all\r\ndeductions; and, if he acts without such qualification, he shall\r\nforfeit 100_l._ which[n] is almost an equivalent to the 20_l._ _per\r\nannum_ required in Henry the sixth's time: and of this qualification[o]\r\nthe justice must now make oath. Also it is provided by the act 5 Geo.\r\nII. that no practising attorney, solicitor, or proctor, shall be\r\ncapable of acting as a justice of the peace.\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: Lamb. 34.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: See bishop Fleetwood's calculations in his _chronicon\r\npretiosum_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: Stat. 18 Geo. II. c. 20.]\r\n\r\nAS the office of these justices is conferred by the king, so it\r\nsubsists only during his pleasure; and is determinable, 1. By the\r\ndemise of the crown; that is, in six months after[p]. 2. By express\r\nwrit under the great seal[q], discharging any particular person, from\r\nbeing any longer justice. 3. By superseding the commission by writ of\r\n_supersedeas_, which suspends the power of all the justices, but does\r\nnot totally destroy it; seeing it may be revived again by another\r\nwrit, called a _procedendo_. 4. By a new commission, which virtually,\r\nthough silently, discharges all the former justices that are not\r\nincluded therein; for two commissions cannot subsist at once. 5. By\r\naccession of the office of sheriff or coroner[r]. Formerly it was\r\nthought, that if a man was named in any commission of the peace, and\r\nhad afterwards a new dignity conferred upon him, that this determined\r\nhis office; he no longer answering the description of the commission:\r\nbut now[s] it is provided, that notwithstanding a new title of\r\ndignity, the justice on whom it is conferred shall still continue a\r\njustice.\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: Stat. 1 Ann. c. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: Lamb. 67.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Stat. 1 Mar. st. 1. c. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: Stat. 1 Edw. VI. c. 7.]\r\n\r\nTHE power, office, and duty of a justice of the peace depend on his\r\ncommission, and on the several statutes, which have created objects of\r\nhis jurisdiction. His commission, first, empowers him singly to\r\nconserve the peace; and thereby gives him all the power of the antient\r\nconservators at the common law, in suppressing riots and affrays, in\r\ntaking securities for the peace, and in apprehending and committing\r\nfelons and other inferior criminals. It also empowers any two or more\r\nof them to hear and determine all felonies and other offences; which\r\nis the ground of their jurisdiction at sessions, of which more will be\r\nsaid in it's proper place. And as to the powers given to one, two, or\r\nmore justices by the several statutes, that from time to time have\r\nheaped upon them such an infinite variety of business, that few care\r\nto undertake, and fewer understand, the office; they are such and of\r\nso great importance to the public, that the country is greatly obliged\r\nto any worthy magistrate, that without sinister views of his own will\r\nengage in this troublesome service. And therefore, if a well meaning\r\njustice makes any undesigned slip in his practice, great lenity and\r\nindulgence is shewn to him in the courts of law; and there are many\r\nstatutes made to protect him in the upright discharge of his\r\noffice[t]: which, among other privileges, prohibit such justices from\r\nbeing sued for any oversights without notice beforehand; and stop all\r\nsuits begun, on tender made of sufficient amends. But, on the other\r\nhand, any malicious or tyrannical abuse of their office is sure to be\r\nseverely punished; and all persons who recover a verdict against a\r\njustice, for any wilful or malicious injury, are entitled to double\r\ncosts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: Stat. 7 Jac. I. c. 5. 21 Jac. I. c. 12. 24 Geo. II. c.\r\n44.]\r\n\r\nIT is impossible upon our present plan to enter minutely into the\r\nparticulars of the accumulated authority, thus committed to the charge\r\nof these magistrates. I must therefore refer myself at present to such\r\nsubsequent parts of these commentaries, as will in their turns\r\ncomprize almost every object of the justices' jurisdiction: and in the\r\nmean time recommend to the student the perusal of Mr Lambard's\r\n_eirenarcha_, and Dr Burn's _justice of the peace_; wherein he will\r\nfind every thing relative to this subject, both in antient and modern\r\npractice, collected with great care and accuracy, and disposed in a\r\nmost clear and judicious method.\r\n\r\nI SHALL next consider some officers of lower rank than those which\r\nhave gone before, and of more confined jurisdiction; but still such as\r\nare universally in use through every part of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nIV. FOURTHLY, then, of the constable. The word constable is frequently\r\nsaid to be derived from the Saxon, koning-staple, and to signify the\r\nsupport of the king. But, as we borrowed the name as well as the\r\noffice of constable from the French, I am rather inclined to deduce\r\nit, with sir H. Spelman and Dr Cowel, from that language, wherein it\r\nis plainly derived from the Latin _comes stabuli_, an officer well\r\nknown in the empire; so called because, like the great constable of\r\nFrance, as well as the lord high constable of England, he was to\r\nregulate all matters of chivalry, tilts, turnaments, and feats of\r\narms, which were performed on horseback. This great office of lord\r\nhigh constable hath been disused in England, except only upon great\r\nand solemn occasions, as the king's coronation and the like, ever\r\nsince the attainder of Stafford duke of Buckingham under king Henry\r\nVIII; as in France it was suppressed about a century after by an edict\r\nof Louis XIII[u]: but from his office, says Lambard[w], this lower\r\nconstableship was at first drawn and fetched, and is as it were a very\r\nfinger of that hand. For the statute of Winchester[x], which first\r\nappoints them, directs that, for the better keeping of the peace, two\r\nconstables in every hundred and franchise shall inspect all matters\r\nrelating to _arms_ and _armour_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: Philips's life of Pole. ii. 111.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: of constables, 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: 13 Edw. I. c. 6.]\r\n\r\nCONSTABLES are of two sorts, high constables, and petty constables.\r\nThe former were first ordained by the statute of Winchester, as\r\nbefore-mentioned; and are appointed at the court leets of the\r\nfranchise or hundred over which they preside, or, in default of that,\r\nby the justices at their quarter sessions; and are removeable by the\r\nsame authority that appoints them[y]. The petty constables are\r\ninferior officers in every town and parish, subordinate to the high\r\nconstable of the hundred, first instituted about the reign of Edward\r\nIII[z]. These petty constables have two offices united in them; the\r\none antient, the other modern. Their antient office is that of\r\nheadborough, tithing-man, or borsholder; of whom we formerly spoke[a],\r\nand who are as antient as the time of king Alfred: their more modern\r\noffice is that of constable merely; which was appointed (as was\r\nobserved) so lately as the reign of Edward III, in order to assist the\r\nhigh constable[b]. And in general the antient headboroughs,\r\ntithing-men, and borsholders, were made use of to serve as petty\r\nconstables; though not so generally, but that in many places they\r\nstill continue distinct officers from the constable. They are all\r\nchosen by the jury at the court leet; or, if no court leet be held,\r\nare appointed by two justices of the peace[c].\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Salk. 150.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: Spelm. Gloss. 148.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: pag. 110.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Lamb. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Stat. 14 & 15 Car. II. c. 12.]\r\n\r\nTHE general duty of all constables, both high and petty, as well as of\r\nthe other officers, is to keep the king's peace in their several\r\ndistricts; and to that purpose they are armed with very large powers,\r\nof arresting, and imprisoning, of breaking open houses, and the like:\r\nof the extent of which powers, considering what manner of men are for\r\nthe most part put upon these offices, it is perhaps very well that\r\nthey are generally kept in ignorance. One of their principal duties,\r\narising from the statute of Winchester, which appoints them, is to\r\nkeep watch and ward in their respective jurisdictions. Ward, guard, or\r\n_custodia_, is chiefly intended of the day time, in order to apprehend\r\nrioters, and robbers on the highways; the manner of doing which is\r\nleft to the discretion of the justices of the peace and the\r\nconstable[d], the hundred being however answerable for all robberies\r\ncommitted therein, by day light, for having kept negligent guard.\r\nWatch is properly applicable to the night only, (being called among\r\nour Teutonic ancestors _wacht_ or _wacta_[e]) and it begins at the\r\ntime when ward ends, and ends when that begins; for, by the statute of\r\nWinchester, in walled towns the gates shall be closed from sunsetting\r\nto sunrising, and watch shall be kept in every borough and town,\r\nespecially in the summer season, to apprehend all rogues, vagabonds,\r\nand night-walkers, and make them give an account of themselves. The\r\nconstable may appoint watchmen at his discretion, regulated by the\r\ncustom of the place; and these, being his deputies, have for the time\r\nbeing the authority of their principal. But, with regard to the\r\ninfinite number of other minute duties, that are laid upon constables\r\nby a diversity of statutes, I must again refer to Mr Lambard and Dr\r\nBurn; in whose compilations may be also seen, what duties belong to\r\nthe constable or tything-man indifferently, and what to the constable\r\nonly: for the constable may do whatever the tything-man may; but it\r\ndoes not hold _e converso_; for the tithing-man has not an equal power\r\nwith the constable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: Dalt. just. c. 104.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: _Excubias et explorationes quas wactas vocant._\r\n_Capitular. Hludovic. Pii._ _cap._ 1. _A.D._ 815.]\r\n\r\nV. WE are next to consider the surveyors of the highways. Every parish\r\nis bound of common right to keep the high roads, that go through it,\r\nin good and sufficient repair; unless by reason of the tenure of\r\nlands, or otherwise, this care is consigned to some particular private\r\nperson. From this burthen no man was exempt by our antient laws,\r\nwhatever other immunities he might enjoy: this being part of the\r\n_trinoda necessitas_, to which every man's estate was subject; viz.\r\n_expeditio contra hostem, arcium constructio, et pontium reparatio_:\r\nfor, though the reparation of bridges only is expressed, yet that of\r\nroads also must be understood; as in the Roman law, _ad instructiones\r\nreparationesque itinerum et pontium, nullum genus hominum, nulliusque\r\ndignitatis ac venerationis meritis, cessare oportet_[f]. And indeed\r\nnow, for the most part, the care of the roads only seems to be left to\r\nparishes; that of bridges being in great measure devolved upon the\r\ncounty at large, by statute 22 Hen. VIII. c. 5. If the parish\r\nneglected these repairs, they might formerly, as they may still, be\r\nindicted for such their neglect: but it was not then incumbent on any\r\nparticular officer to call the parish together, and set them upon this\r\nwork; for which reason by the statute 2 & 3 Ph. & M. c. 8. surveyors\r\nof the highways were ordered to be chosen in every parish[g].\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: _C._ 11. 74. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: This office, Mr Dalton (just. cap. 50.) says, exactly\r\nanswers that of the _curatores viarum_ of the Romans: but, I should\r\nguess that theirs was an office of rather more dignity and authority\r\nthan ours, not only from comparing the method of making and mending\r\nthe Roman ways with those of our country parishes; but also because\r\none Thermus, who was the curator of the Flaminian way, was candidate\r\nfor the consulship with Julius Caesar. (_Cic. ad Attic._ _l._ 1. _ep._\r\n1.)]\r\n\r\nTHESE surveyors were originally, according to the statute of Philip\r\nand Mary, to be appointed by the constable and churchwardens of the\r\nparish; but now[h] they are constituted by two neighbouring justices,\r\nout of such substantial inhabitants as have either 10_l._ _per annum_\r\nof their own, or rent 30_l._ a year, or are worth in personal estate\r\n100_l._\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Stat. 3 W. & M. c. 12.]\r\n\r\nTHEIR office and duty consists in putting in execution a variety of\r\nstatutes for the repairs of the highways; that is, of ways leading\r\nfrom one town to another: by which it is enacted, 1. That they may\r\nremove all annoyances in the highways, or give notice to the owner to\r\nremove them; who is liable to penalties on noncompliance. 2. They are\r\nto call together all the inhabitants of the parish, six days in every\r\nyear, to labour in repairing the highways; all persons keeping\r\ndraughts, or occupying lands, being obliged to send a team for every\r\ndraught, and for every 50_l._ a year, which they keep or occupy; and\r\nall other persons to work or find a labourer. The work must be\r\ncompleted before harvest; as well for providing a good road for\r\ncarrying in the corn, as also because all hands are then supposed to\r\nbe employed in harvest work. And every cartway must be made eight feet\r\nwide at the least[i]; and may be increased by the quarter sessions to\r\nthe breadth of four and twenty feet. 3. The surveyors may lay out\r\ntheir own money in purchasing materials for repairs, where there is\r\nnot sufficient within the parish, and shall be reimbursed by a rate,\r\nto be allowed at a special sessions. 4. In case the personal labour of\r\nthe parish be not sufficient, the surveyors, with the consent of the\r\nquarter sessions, may levy a rate (not exceeding 6_d._ in the pound)\r\non the parish, in aid of the personal duty; for the due application of\r\nwhich they are to account upon oath. As for turnpikes, which are now\r\nuniversally introduced in aid of such rates, and the law relating to\r\nthem, these depend entirely on the particular powers granted in the\r\nseveral road acts, and therefore have nothing to do with this\r\ncompendium of general law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: This, by the laws of the twelve tables at Rome, was the\r\nstandard for roads that were straight; but, in winding ways, the\r\nbreadth was directed to be sixteen feet. _Ff._ 8. 3. 8.]\r\n\r\nVI. I PROCEED therefore, lastly, to consider the overseers of the\r\npoor; their original, appointment, and duty.\r\n\r\nTHE poor of England, till the time of Henry VIII, subsisted entirely\r\nupon private benevolence, and the charity of welldisposed christians.\r\nFor, though it appears by the mirrour[k], that by the common law the\r\npoor were to be \"sustained by parsons, rectors of the church, and the\r\nparishioners; so that none of them dye for default of sustenance;\" and\r\nthough by the statutes 12 Ric. II. c. 7. and 19 Hen. VII. c. 12. the\r\npoor are directed to be sustained in the cities or towns wherein they\r\nwere born, or such wherein they had dwelt for three years (which seem\r\nto be the first rudiments of parish settlements) yet till the statute\r\n27 Hen. VIII. c. 26. I find no compulsory method chalked out for this\r\npurpose: but the poor seem to have been left to such relief as the\r\nhumanity of their neighbours would afford them. The monasteries were,\r\nin particular, their principal resource; and, among other bad effects\r\nwhich attended the monastic institutions, it was not perhaps one of\r\nthe least (though frequently esteemed quite otherwise) that they\r\nsupported and fed a very numerous and very idle poor, whose sustenance\r\ndepended upon what was daily distributed in alms at the gates of the\r\nreligious houses. But, upon the total dissolution of these, the\r\ninconvenience of thus encouraging the poor in habits of indolence and\r\nbeggary was quickly felt throughout the kingdom: and abundance of\r\nstatutes were made in the reign of king Henry the eighth, for\r\nproviding for the poor and impotent; which, the preambles to some of\r\nthem recite, had of late years _strangely_ increased. These poor were\r\nprincipally of two sorts: sick and impotent, and therefore unable to\r\nwork; idle and sturdy, and therefore able, but not willing, to\r\nexercise any honest employment. To provide in some measure for both of\r\nthese, in and about the metropolis, his son Edward the sixth founded\r\nthree royal hospitals; Christ's, and St. Thomas's, for the relief of\r\nthe impotent through infancy or sickness; and Bridewell for the\r\npunishment and employment of the vigorous and idle. But these were far\r\nfrom being sufficient for the care of the poor throughout the kingdom\r\nat large; and therefore, after many other fruitless experiments, by\r\nstatute 43 Eliz. c. 2. overseers of the poor were appointed in every\r\nparish.\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: c. 1. §. 3.]\r\n\r\nBY virtue of the statute last mentioned, these overseers are to be\r\nnominated yearly in Easter-week, or within one month after, by two\r\njustices dwelling near the parish. They must be substantial\r\nhouseholders, and so expressed to be in the appointment of the\r\njustices[l].\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: 2 Lord Raym. 1394.]\r\n\r\nTHEIR office and duty, according to the same statute, are principally\r\nthese: first, to raise competent sums for the necessary relief of the\r\npoor, impotent, old, blind, and such other, being poor and not able to\r\nwork: and, secondly, to provide work for such as are able, and cannot\r\notherwise get employment: but this latter part of their duty, which,\r\naccording to the wise regulations of that salutary statute, should go\r\nhand in hand with the other, is now most shamefully neglected.\r\nHowever, for these joint purposes, they are empowered to make and levy\r\nrates upon the several inhabitants of the parish, by the same act of\r\nparliament; which has been farther explained and enforced by several\r\nsubsequent statutes.\r\n\r\nTHE two great objects of this statute seem to have been, 1. To relieve\r\nthe impotent poor, and them only. 2. To find employment for such as\r\nare able to work: and this principally by providing stocks to be\r\nworked up at home, which perhaps might be more beneficial than\r\naccumulating all the poor in one common work-house; a practice which\r\ntends to destroy all domestic connexions (the only felicity of the\r\nhonest and industrious labourer) and to put the sober and diligent\r\nupon a level, in point of their earnings, with those who are dissolute\r\nand idle. Whereas, if none were to be relieved but those who are\r\nincapable to get their livings, and that in proportion to their\r\nincapacity; if no children were to be removed from their parents, but\r\nsuch as are brought up in rags and idleness; and if every poor man and\r\nhis family were employed whenever they requested it, and were allowed\r\nthe whole profits of their labour;--a spirit of chearful industry\r\nwould soon diffuse itself through every cottage; work would become\r\neasy and habitual, when absolutely necessary to their daily\r\nsubsistence; and the most indigent peasant would go through his task\r\nwithout a murmur, if assured that he and his children (when incapable\r\nof work through infancy, age, or infirmity) would then, and then only,\r\nbe intitled to support from his opulent neighbours.\r\n\r\nTHIS appears to have been the plan of the statute of queen Elizabeth;\r\nin which the only defect was confining the management of the poor to\r\nsmall, parochial, districts; which are frequently incapable of\r\nfurnishing proper work, or providing an able director. However, the\r\nlaborious poor were then at liberty to seek employment wherever it was\r\nto be had; none being obliged to reside in the places of their\r\nsettlement, but such as were unable or unwilling to work; and those\r\nplaces of settlement being only such where they were born, or had made\r\ntheir abode, originally for three years[m], and afterwards (in the\r\ncase of vagabonds) for one year only[n].\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: Stat. 19 Hen. VII. c. 12. 1 Edw. VI. c. 3. 3 Edw. VI. c.\r\n16. 14 Eliz. c. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: Stat. 39 Eliz. c. 4.]\r\n\r\nAFTER the restoration, a very different plan was adopted, which has\r\nrendered the employment of the poor more difficult, by authorizing the\r\nsubdivision of parishes; has greatly increased their number, by\r\nconfining them all to their respective districts; has given birth to\r\nthe intricacy of our poor-laws, by multiplying and rendering more easy\r\nthe methods of gaining settlements; and, in consequence, has created\r\nan infinity of expensive lawsuits between contending neighbourhoods,\r\nconcerning those settlements and removals. By the statute 13 & 14 Car.\r\nII. c. 12. a legal settlement was declared to be gained by birth,\r\ninhabitancy, apprenticeship, or service for forty days; within which\r\nperiod all intruders were made removeable from any parish by two\r\njustices of the peace, unless they settled in a tenement of the annual\r\nvalue of 10_l._ The frauds, naturally consequent upon this provision,\r\nwhich gave a settlement by so short a residence, produced the statute\r\n1 Jac. II. c. 17. which directed notice in writing to be delivered to\r\nthe parish officers, before a settlement could be gained by such\r\nresidence. Subsequent provisions allowed other circumstances of\r\nnotoriety to be equivalent to such notice given; and those\r\ncircumstances have from time to time been altered, enlarged, or\r\nrestrained, whenever the experience of new inconveniences, arising\r\ndaily from new regulations, suggested the necessity of a remedy. And\r\nthe doctrine of certificates was invented, by way of counterpoise, to\r\nrestrain a man and his family from acquiring a new settlement by any\r\nlength of residence whatever, unless in two particular excepted cases;\r\nwhich makes parishes very cautious of giving such certificates, and\r\nof course confines the poor at home, where frequently no adequate\r\nemployment can be had.\r\n\r\nTHE law of settlements may be therefore now reduced to the following\r\ngeneral heads; or, a settlement in a parish may be acquired, 1. By\r\nbirth; which is always _prima facie_ the place of settlement, until\r\nsome other can be shewn[o]. This is also always the place of\r\nsettlement of a bastard child; for a bastard, having in the eye of the\r\nlaw no father, cannot be referred to _his_ settlement, as other\r\nchildren may[p]. But, in legitimate children, though the place of\r\nbirth be _prima facie_ the settlement, yet it is not conclusively so;\r\nfor there are, 2. Settlements by parentage, being the settlement of\r\none's father or mother: all children being really settled in the\r\nparish where their parents are settled, until they get a new\r\nsettlement for themselves[q]. A new settlement may be acquired several\r\nways; as, 3. By marriage. For a woman, marrying a man that is settled\r\nin another parish, changes her own: the law not permitting the\r\nseparation of husband and wife[r]. But if the man be a foreigner, and\r\nhas no settlement, her's is suspended during his life, if he be able\r\nto maintain her; but after his death she may return again to her old\r\nsettlement[s]. The other methods of acquiring settlements in any\r\nparish are all reducible to this one, of forty days residence therein:\r\nbut this forty days residence (which is construed to be lodging or\r\nlying there) must not be by fraud, or stealth, or in any clandestine\r\nmanner; but accompanied with one or other of the following concomitant\r\ncircumstances. The next method therefore of gaining a settlement, is,\r\n4. By forty days residence, and notice. For if a stranger comes into a\r\nparish, and delivers notice in writing of his place of abode, and\r\nnumber of his family, to one of the overseers (which must be read in\r\nthe church and registered) and resides there unmolested for forty days\r\nafter such notice, he is legally settled thereby[t]. For the law\r\npresumes that such a one at the time of notice is not likely to\r\nbecome chargeable, else he would not venture to give it; or that, in\r\nsuch case, the parish would take care to remove him. But there are\r\nalso other circumstances equivalent to such notice: therefore, 5.\r\nRenting for a year a tenement of the yearly value of ten pounds, and\r\nresiding forty days in the parish, gains a settlement without\r\nnotice[u]; upon the principle of having substance enough to gain\r\ncredit for such a house. 6. Being charged to and paying the public\r\ntaxes and levies of the parish; and, 7. Executing any public parochial\r\noffice for a whole year in the parish, as churchwarden, &c; are both\r\nof them equivalent to notice, and gain a settlement[w], when coupled\r\nwith a residence of forty days. 8. Being hired for a year, when\r\nunmarried, and serving a year in the same service; and 9. Being bound\r\nan apprentice for seven years; give the servant and apprentice a\r\nsettlement, without notice[x], in that place wherein they serve the\r\nlast forty days. This is meant to encourage application to trades, and\r\ngoing out to reputable services. 10. Lastly, the having an estate of\r\none's own, and residing thereon forty days, however small the value\r\nmay be, in case it be acquired by act of law or of a third person, as\r\nby descent, gift, devise, &c, is a sufficient settlement[y]: but if a\r\nman acquire it by his own act, as by purchase, (in it's popular sense,\r\nin consideration of money paid) then[z] unless the consideration\r\nadvanced, _bona fide_, be 30_l._ it is no settlement for any longer\r\ntime, than the person shall inhabit thereon. He is in no case\r\nremoveable from his own property; but he shall not, by any trifling or\r\nfraudulent purchase of his own, acquire a permanent and lasting\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: 1 Lord Raym. 567.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: Salk. 427.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: Salk. 528. 2 Lord Raym. 1473.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Stra. 544.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: Foley. 249.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: Stat. 13 & 14 Car.

II. c. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Salk. 524.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: Stat. 9 Geo. I. c. 7.]\r\n\r\nALL persons, not so settled, may be removed to their own parishes, on\r\ncomplaint of the overseers, by two justices of the peace, if they\r\nshall adjudge them likely to become chargeable to the parish, into\r\nwhich they have intruded: unless they are in a way of getting a legal\r\nsettlement, as by having hired a house of 10_l._ _per annum_, or\r\nliving in an annual service; for then they are not removeable[a]. And\r\nin all other cases, if the parish to which they belong, will grant\r\nthem a certificate, acknowleging them to be _their_ parishioners, they\r\ncannot be removed merely because _likely_ to become chargeable, but\r\nonly when they become _actually_ chargeable[b]. But such certificated\r\npersons can gain no settlement by any of the means above-mentioned;\r\nunless by renting a tenement of 10_l._ _per annum_, or by serving an\r\nannual office in the parish, being legally placed therein: neither can\r\nan apprentice or servant to such certificated person gain a settlement\r\nby such their service[c].\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: Salk. 472.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Stat. 8 & 9 W. III. c. 30.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Stat. 12 Ann. c. 18.]\r\n\r\nTHESE are the general heads of the laws relating to the poor, which,\r\nby the resolutions of the courts of justice thereon within a century\r\npast, are branched into a great variety. And yet, notwithstanding the\r\npains that has been taken about them, they still remain very\r\nimperfect, and inadequate to the purposes they are designed for: a\r\nfate, that has generally attended most of our statute laws, where they\r\nhave not the foundation of the common law to build on. When the\r\nshires, the hundreds, and the tithings, were kept in the same\r\nadmirable order that they were disposed in by the great Alfred, there\r\nwere no persons idle, consequently none but the impotent that needed\r\nrelief: and the statute of 43 Eliz. seems entirely founded on the same\r\nprinciple. But when this excellent scheme was neglected and departed\r\nfrom, we cannot but observe with concern, what miserable shifts and\r\nlame expedients have from time to time been adopted, in order to patch\r\nup the flaws occasioned by this neglect. There is not a more necessary\r\nor more certain maxim in the frame and constitution of society, than\r\nthat every individual must contribute his share, in order to the\r\nwell-being of the community: and surely they must be very deficient in\r\nsound policy, who suffer one half of a parish to continue idle,\r\ndissolute, and unemployed; and then form visionary schemes, and at\r\nlength are amazed to find, that the industry of the other half is not\r\nable to maintain the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE TENTH.\r\n\r\nOF THE PEOPLE, WHETHER ALIENS, DENIZENS, OR NATIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVING, in the eight preceding chapters, treated of persons as they\r\nstand in the public relations of _magistrates_, I now proceed to\r\nconsider such persons as fall under the denomination of the _people_.\r\nAnd herein all the inferior and subordinate magistrates, treated of in\r\nthe last chapter, are included.\r\n\r\nTHE first and most obvious division of the people is into aliens and\r\nnatural-born subjects. Natural-born subjects are such as are born\r\nwithin the dominions of the crown of England, that is, within the\r\nligeance, or as it is generally called, the allegiance of the king;\r\nand aliens, such as are born out of it. Allegiance is the tie, or\r\n_ligamen_, which binds the subject to the king, in return for that\r\nprotection which the king affords the subject. The thing itself, or\r\nsubstantial part of it, is founded in reason and the nature of\r\ngovernment; the name and the form are derived to us from our Gothic\r\nancestors. Under the feodal system, every owner of lands held them in\r\nsubjection to some superior or lord, from whom or whose ancestors the\r\ntenant or vasal had received them: and there was a mutual trust or\r\nconfidence subsisting between the lord and vasal, that the lord should\r\nprotect the vasal in the enjoyment of the territory he had granted\r\nhim, and, on the other hand, that the vasal should be faithful to the\r\nlord and defend him against all his enemies. This obligation on the\r\npart of the vasal was called his _fidelitas_ or fealty; and an oath of\r\nfealty was required, by the feodal law, to be taken by all tenants to\r\ntheir landlord, which is couched in almost the same terms as our\r\nantient oath of allegiance[a]: except that in the usual oath of fealty\r\nthere was frequently a saving or exception of the faith due to a\r\nsuperior lord by name, under whom the landlord himself was perhaps\r\nonly a tenant or vasal. But when the acknowlegement was made to the\r\nabsolute superior himself, who was vasal to no man, it was no longer\r\ncalled the oath of fealty, but the oath of allegiance; and therein the\r\ntenant swore to bear faith to his sovereign lord, in opposition to all\r\nmen, without any saving or exception: \"_contra omnes homines\r\nfidelitatem fecit_[b].\" Land held by this exalted species of fealty\r\nwas called _feudum ligium_, a liege fee; the vasals _homines ligii_,\r\nor liege men; and the sovereign their _dominus ligius_, or liege lord.\r\nAnd when sovereign princes did homage to each other, for lands held\r\nunder their respective sovereignties, a distinction was always made\r\nbetween _simple_ homage, which was only an acknowlegement of\r\ntenure[c]; and _liege_ homage, which included the fealty\r\nbefore-mentioned, and the services consequent upon it. Thus when\r\nEdward III, in 1329, did homage to Philip VI of France, for his ducal\r\ndominions on that continent, it was warmly disputed of what species\r\nthe homage was to be, whether _liege_ or _simple_ homage[d]. With us\r\nin England, it becoming a settled principle of tenure, that _all_\r\nlands in the kingdom are holden of the king as their sovereign and\r\nlord paramount, no oath but that of fealty could ever be taken to\r\ninferior lords, and the oath of allegiance was necessarily confined to\r\nthe person of the king alone. By an easy analogy the term of\r\nallegiance was soon brought to signify all other engagements, which\r\nare due from subjects to their prince, as well as those duties which\r\nwere simply and merely territorial. And the oath of allegiance, as\r\nadministred for upwards of six hundred years[e], contained a promise\r\n\"to be true and faithful to the king and his heirs, and truth and\r\nfaith to bear of life and limb and terrene honour, and not to know or\r\nhear of any ill or damage intended him, without defending him\r\ntherefrom.\" Upon which sir Matthew Hale[f] makes this remark; that it\r\nwas short and plain, not entangled with long or intricate clauses or\r\ndeclarations, and yet is comprehensive of the whole duty from the\r\nsubject to his sovereign. But, at the revolution, the terms of this\r\noath being thought perhaps to favour too much the notion of\r\nnon-resistance, the present form was introduced by the convention\r\nparliament, which is more general and indeterminate than the former;\r\nthe subject only promising \"that he will be faithful and bear _true_\r\nallegiance to the king,\" without mentioning \"his heirs,\" or specifying\r\nin the least wherein that allegiance consists. The oath of supremacy\r\nis principally calculated as a renuntiation of the pope's pretended\r\nauthority: and the oath of abjuration, introduced in the reign of king\r\nWilliam[g], very amply supplies the loose and general texture of the\r\noath of allegiance; it recognizing the right of his majesty, derived\r\nunder the act of settlement; engaging to support him to the utmost of\r\nthe juror's power; promising to disclose all traiterous conspiracies\r\nagainst him; and expressly renouncing any claim of the pretender, by\r\nname, in as clear and explicit terms as the English language can\r\nfurnish. This oath must be taken by all persons in any office, trust,\r\nor employment; and may be tendered by two justices of the peace to any\r\nperson, whom they shall suspect of disaffection[h]. But the oath of\r\nallegiance may be tendered[i] to all persons above the age of twelve\r\nyears, whether natives, denizens, or aliens, either in the court-leet\r\nof the manor, or in the sheriff's tourn, which is the court-leet of\r\nthe county.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: 2 _Feud._ 5, 6, 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: 2 _Feud._ 99.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: 7 Rep. Calvin's case. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: 2 Carte. 401. Mod. Un. Hist. xxiii. 420.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Mirror. _c._ 3. §. 35. Fleta. 3. 16. Britton. _c._ 29. 7\r\nRep. Calvin's case. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: 1 Hal. P.C. 63.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Stat. 13 W. III. c. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Stat. 1 Geo. I. c. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: 2 Inst. 121. 1 Hal. P.C. 64.]\r\n\r\nBUT, besides these express engagements, the law also holds that there\r\nis an implied, original, and virtual allegiance, owing from every\r\nsubject to his sovereign, antecedently to any express promise; and\r\nalthough the subject never swore any faith or allegiance in form. For\r\nas the king, by the very descent of the crown, is fully invested with\r\nall the rights and bound to all the duties of sovereignty, before his\r\ncoronation; so the subject is bound to his prince by an intrinsic\r\nallegiance, before the superinduction of those outward bonds of oath,\r\nhomage, and fealty; which were only instituted to remind the subject\r\nof this his previous duty, and for the better securing it's\r\nperformance[k]. The formal profession therefore, or oath of\r\nsubjection, is nothing more than a declaration in words of what was\r\nbefore implied in law. Which occasions sir Edward Coke very justly to\r\nobserve[l], that \"all subjects are equally bounden to their\r\nallegiance, as if they had taken the oath; because it is written by\r\nthe finger of the law in their hearts, and the taking of the corporal\r\noath is but an outward declaration of the same.\" The sanction of an\r\noath, it is true, in case of violation of duty, makes the guilt still\r\nmore accumulated, by superadding perjury to treason; but it does not\r\nencrease the civil obligation to loyalty; it only strengthens the\r\n_social_ tie by uniting it with that of _religion_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: 1 Hal. P.C. 61.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: 2 Inst. 121.]\r\n\r\nALLEGIANCE, both express and implied, is however distinguished by the\r\nlaw into two sorts or species, the one natural, the other local; the\r\nformer being also perpetual, the latter temporary. Natural allegiance\r\nis such as is due from all men born within the king's dominions\r\nimmediately upon their birth[m]. For, immediately upon their birth,\r\nthey are under the king's protection; at a time too, when (during\r\ntheir infancy) they are incapable of protecting themselves. Natural\r\nallegiance is therefore a debt of gratitude; which cannot be\r\nforfeited, cancelled, or altered, by any change of time, place, or\r\ncircumstance, nor by any thing but the united concurrence of the\r\nlegislature[n]. An Englishman who removes to France, or to China, owes\r\nthe same allegiance to the king of England there as at home, and\r\ntwenty years hence as well as now. For it is a principle of universal\r\nlaw[o], that the natural-born subject of one prince cannot by any act\r\nof his own, no, not by swearing allegiance to another, put off or\r\ndischarge his natural allegiance to the former: for this natural\r\nallegiance was intrinsic, and primitive, and antecedent to the other;\r\nand cannot be devested without the concurrent act of that prince to\r\nwhom it was first due. Indeed the natural-born subject of one prince,\r\nto whom he owes allegiance, may be entangled by subjecting himself\r\nabsolutely to another; but it is his own act that brings him into\r\nthese straits and difficulties, of owing service to two masters; and\r\nit is unreasonable that, by such voluntary act of his own, he should\r\nbe able at pleasure to unloose those bands, by which he is connected\r\nto his natural prince.\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: 7 Rep. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: 2 P. Wms. 124.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: 1 Hal. P.C. 68.]\r\n\r\nLOCAL allegiance is such as is due from an alien, or stranger born,\r\nfor so long time as he continues within the king's dominion and\r\nprotection[p]: and it ceases, the instant such stranger transfers\r\nhimself from this kingdom to another. Natural allegiance is therefore\r\nperpetual, and local temporary only: and that for this reason,\r\nevidently founded upon the nature of government; that allegiance is a\r\ndebt due from the subject, upon an implied contract with the prince,\r\nthat so long as the one affords protection, so long the other will\r\ndemean himself faithfully. As therefore the prince is always under a\r\nconstant tie to protect his natural-born subjects, at all times and in\r\nall countries, for this reason their allegiance due to him is equally\r\nuniversal and permanent. But, on the other hand, as the prince affords\r\nhis protection to an alien, only during his residence in this realm,\r\nthe allegiance of an alien is confined (in point of time) to the\r\nduration of such his residence, and (in point of locality) to the\r\ndominions of the British empire. From which considerations sir Matthew\r\nHale[q] deduces this consequence, that, though there be an usurper of\r\nthe crown, yet it is treason for any subject, while the usurper is in\r\nfull possession of the sovereignty, to practice any thing against his\r\ncrown and dignity: wherefore, although the true prince regain the\r\nsovereignty, yet such attempts against the usurper (unless in defence\r\nor aid of the rightful king) have been afterwards punished with death;\r\nbecause of the breach of that temporary allegiance, which was due to\r\nhim as king _de facto_. And upon this footing, after Edward IV\r\nrecovered the crown, which had been long detained from his house by\r\nthe line of Lancaster, treasons committed against Henry VI were\r\ncapitally punished, though Henry had been declared an usurper by\r\nparliament.\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: 7 Rep. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: 1 Hal. P.C. 60.]\r\n\r\nTHIS oath of allegiance, or rather the allegiance itself, is held to\r\nbe applicable not only to the political capacity of the king, or regal\r\noffice, but to his natural person, and blood-royal: and for the\r\nmisapplication of their allegiance, viz. to the regal capacity or\r\ncrown, exclusive of the person of the king, were the Spencers banished\r\nin the reign of Edward II[r]. And from hence arose that principle of\r\npersonal attachment, and affectionate loyalty, which induced our\r\nforefathers (and, if occasion required, would doubtless induce their\r\nsons) to hazard all that was dear to them, life, fortune, and family,\r\nin defence and support of their liege lord and sovereign.\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: 1 Hal. P.C. 67.]\r\n\r\nTHIS allegiance then, both express and implied, is the duty of all the\r\nking's subjects, under the distinctions here laid down, of local and\r\ntemporary, or universal and perpetual. Their rights are also\r\ndistinguishable by the same criterions of time and locality;\r\nnatural-born subjects having a great variety of rights, which they\r\nacquire by being born within the king's ligeance, and can never\r\nforfeit by any distance of place or time, but only by their own\r\nmisbehaviour: the explanation of which rights is the principal subject\r\nof the two first books of these commentaries. The same is also in some\r\ndegree the case of aliens; though their rights are much more\r\ncircumscribed, being acquired only by residence here, and lost\r\nwhenever they remove. I shall however here endeavour to chalk out some\r\nof the principal lines, whereby they are distinguished from natives,\r\ndescending to farther particulars when they come in course.\r\n\r\nAN alien born may purchase lands, or other estates: but not for his\r\nown use; for the king is thereupon entitled to them[s]. If an alien\r\ncould acquire a permanent property in lands, he must owe an\r\nallegiance, equally permanent with that property, to the king of\r\nEngland; which would probably be inconsistent with that, which he owes\r\nto his own natural liege lord: besides that thereby the nation might\r\nin time be subject to foreign influence, and feel many other\r\ninconveniences. Wherefore by the civil law such contracts were also\r\nmade void[t]: but the prince had no such advantage of escheat thereby,\r\nas with us in England. Among other reasons, which might be given for\r\nour constitution, it seems to be intended by way of punishment for the\r\nalien's presumption, in attempting to acquire any landed property: for\r\nthe vendor is not affected by it, he having resigned his right, and\r\nreceived an equivalent in exchange. Yet an alien may acquire a\r\nproperty in goods, money, and other personal estate, or may hire a\r\nhouse for his habitation[u]: for personal estate is of a transitory\r\nand moveable nature; and, besides, this indulgence to strangers is\r\nnecessary for the advancement of trade. Aliens also may trade as\r\nfreely as other people; only they are subject to certain higher duties\r\nat the custom-house: and there are also some obsolete statutes of\r\nHenry VIII, prohibiting alien artificers to work for themselves in\r\nthis kingdom; but it is generally held they were virtually repealed by\r\nstatute 5 Eliz. c. 7. Also an alien may bring an action concerning\r\npersonal property, and may make a will, and dispose of his personal\r\nestate[w]: not as it is in France, where the king at the death of an\r\nalien is entitled to all he is worth, by the _droit d'aubaine_ or _jus\r\nalbinatus_[x], unless he has a peculiar exemption. When I mention\r\nthese rights of an alien, I must be understood of alien-friends only,\r\nor such whose countries are in peace with ours; for alien-enemies\r\nhave no rights, no privileges, unless by the king's special favour,\r\nduring the time of war.\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: Co. Litt. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: _Cod._ _l._ 11. _tit._ 55.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: 7 Rep. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: Lutw. 34.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: The word is derived from _alibi natus_; Spelm. Gl. 24.]\r\n\r\nWHEN I say, that an alien is one who is born out of the king's\r\ndominions, or allegiance, this also must be understood with some\r\nrestrictions. The common law indeed stood absolutely so; with only a\r\nvery few exceptions: so that a particular act of parliament became\r\nnecessary after the restoration[y], for the naturalization of children\r\nof his majesty's English subjects, born in foreign countries during\r\nthe late troubles. And this maxim of the law proceeded upon a general\r\nprinciple, that every man owes natural allegiance where he is born,\r\nand cannot owe two such allegiances, or serve two masters, at once.\r\nYet the children of the king's embassadors born abroad were always\r\nheld to be natural subjects[z]: for as the father, though in a foreign\r\ncountry, owes not even a local allegiance to the prince to whom he is\r\nsent; so, with regard to the son also, he was held (by a kind of\r\n_postliminium_) to be born under the king of England's allegiance,\r\nrepresented by his father, the embassador. To encourage also foreign\r\ncommerce, it was enacted by statute 25 Edw. III. st. 2. that all\r\nchildren born abroad, provided _both_ their parents were at the time\r\nof the birth in allegiance to the king, and the mother had passed the\r\nseas by her husband's consent, might inherit as if born in England:\r\nand accordingly it hath been so adjudged in behalf of merchants[a].\r\nBut by several more modern statutes[b] these restrictions are still\r\nfarther taken off: so that all children, born out of the king's\r\nligeance, whose _fathers_ were natural-born subjects, are now\r\nnatural-born subjects themselves, to all intents and purposes, without\r\nany exception; unless their said fathers were attainted, or banished\r\nbeyond sea, for high treason; or were then in the service of a prince\r\nat enmity with Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Stat. 29 Car. II. c. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: 7 Rep. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: Cro. Car. 601. Mar. 91. Jenk. Cent. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: 7 Ann. c. 5. and 4 Geo. II. c. 21.]\r\n\r\nTHE children of aliens, born here in England, are, generally speaking,\r\nnatural-born subjects, and entitled to all the privileges of such. In\r\nwhich the constitution of France differs from ours; for there, by\r\ntheir _jus albinatus_, if a child be born of foreign parents, it is an\r\nalien[c].\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Jenk. Cent. 3. cites _treasure françois_, 312.]\r\n\r\nA DENIZEN is an alien born, but who has obtained _ex donatione regis_\r\nletters patent to make him an English subject: a high and\r\nincommunicable branch of the royal prerogative[d]. A denizen is in a\r\nkind of middle state between an alien, and natural-born subject, and\r\npartakes of both of them. He may take lands by purchase or devise,\r\nwhich an alien may not; but cannot take by inheritance[e]: for his\r\nparent, through whom he must claim, being an alien had no inheritable\r\nblood, and therefore could convey none to the son. And, upon a like\r\ndefect of hereditary blood, the issue of a denizen, born _before_\r\ndenization, cannot inherit to him; but his issue born _after_, may[f].\r\nA denizen is not excused[g] from paying the alien's duty, and some\r\nother mercantile burthens. And no denizen can be of the privy council,\r\nor either house of parliament, or have any office of trust, civil or\r\nmilitary, or be capable of any grant from the crown[h].\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: 7 Rep. Calvin's case. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: 11 Rep. 67.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Co. Litt. 8. Vaugh. 285.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Stat. 22 Hen. VIII. c. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Stat. 12 W. III. c. 2.]\r\n\r\nNATURALIZATION cannot be performed but by act of parliament: for by\r\nthis an alien is put in exactly the same state as if he had been born\r\nin the king's ligeance; except only that he is incapable, as well as a\r\ndenizen, of being a member of the privy council, or parliament, &c[i].\r\nNo bill for naturalization can be received in either house of\r\nparliament, without such disabling clause in it[k]. Neither can any\r\nperson be naturalized or restored in blood, unless he hath received\r\nthe sacrament of the Lord's supper within one month before the\r\nbringing in of the bill; and unless he also takes the oaths of\r\nallegiance and supremacy in the presence of the parliament[l].\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Stat. 1 Geo. I. c. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: Stat. 7 Jac. I. c. 2.]\r\n\r\nTHESE are the principal distinctions between aliens, denizens, and\r\nnatives: distinctions, which endeavors have been frequently used since\r\nthe commencement of this century to lay almost totally aside, by one\r\ngeneral naturalization-act for all foreign protestants. An attempt\r\nwhich was once carried into execution by the statute 7 Ann. c. 5. but\r\nthis, after three years experience of it, was repealed by the statute\r\n10 Ann. c. 5. except one clause, which was just now mentioned, for\r\nnaturalizing the children of English parents born abroad. However,\r\nevery foreign seaman who in time of war serves two years on board an\r\nEnglish ship is _ipso facto_ naturalized[m]; and all foreign\r\nprotestants, and Jews, upon their residing seven years in any of the\r\nAmerican colonies, without being absent above two months at a time,\r\nare upon taking the oaths naturalized to all intents and purposes, as\r\nif they had been born in this kingdom[n]; and therefore are admissible\r\nto all such privileges, and no other, as protestants or Jews born in\r\nthis kingdom are entitled to. What those privileges are[o], was the\r\nsubject of very high debates about the time of the famous Jew-bill[p];\r\nwhich enabled all Jews to prefer bills of naturalization in\r\nparliament, without receiving the sacrament, as ordained by statute 7\r\nJac. I. It is not my intention to revive this controversy again; for\r\nthe act lived only a few months, and was then repealed[q]: therefore\r\npeace be now to it's _manes_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: Stat. 13 Geo.

For, the laws having\r\nexempted them from almost every personal duty, they attempted a total\r\nexemption from every secular tie. But it is observed by sir Edward\r\nCoke[a], that, as the overflowing of waters doth many times make the\r\nriver to lose it's proper chanel, so in times past ecclesiastical\r\npersons, seeking to extend their liberties beyond their true bounds,\r\neither lost or enjoyed not those which of right belonged to them. The\r\npersonal exemptions do indeed for the most part continue. A clergyman\r\ncannot be compelled to serve on a jury, nor to appear at a court-leet\r\nor view of frank pledge; which almost every other person is obliged to\r\ndo[b]: but, if a layman is summoned on a jury, and before the trial\r\ntakes orders, he shall notwithstanding appear and be sworn[c]. Neither\r\ncan he be chosen to any temporal office; as bailiff, reeve, constable,\r\nor the like: in regard of his own continual attendance on the sacred\r\nfunction[d]. During his attendance on divine service he is privileged\r\nfrom arrests in civil suits[e]. In cases also of felony, a clerk in\r\norders shall have the benefit of his clergy, without being branded in\r\nthe hand; and may likewise have it more than once: in both which\r\nparticulars he is distinguished from a layman[f]. But as they have\r\ntheir privileges, so also they have their disabilities, on account of\r\ntheir spiritual avocations. Clergymen, we have seen[g], are incapable\r\nof sitting in the house of commons; and by statute 21 Hen. VIII. c.\r\n13. are not allowed to take any lands or tenements to farm, upon pain\r\nof 10_l._ _per_ month, and total avoidance of the lease; nor shall\r\nengage in any manner of trade, nor sell any merchandize, under\r\nforfeiture of the treble value. Which prohibition is consonant to the\r\ncanon law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: 2 Inst. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: F.N.B. 160. 2 Inst. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: 4 Leon. 190.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: Finch. L. 88.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Stat. 50 Edw. III. c. 5. 1 Ric. II. c. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: 2 Inst. 637. Stat. 4 Hen. VII. c. 13. & 1 Edw. VI. c.\r\n12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: page 169.]\r\n\r\nIN the frame and constitution of ecclesiastical polity there are\r\ndivers ranks and degrees: which I shall consider in their respective\r\norder, merely as they are taken notice of by the secular laws of\r\nEngland; without intermeddling with the canons and constitutions, by\r\nwhich they have bound themselves. And under each division I shall\r\nconsider, 1. The method of their appointment; 2. Their rights and\r\nduties; and 3. The manner wherein their character or office may cease.\r\n\r\nI. AN arch-bishop or bishop is elected by the chapter of his cathedral\r\nchurch, by virtue of a licence from the crown. Election was, in very\r\nearly times, the usual mode of elevation to the episcopal chair\r\nthroughout all christendom; and this was promiscuously performed by\r\nthe laity as well as the clergy[h]: till at length, it becoming\r\ntumultuous, the emperors and other sovereigns of the respective\r\nkingdoms of Europe took the election in some degree into their own\r\nhands; by reserving to themselves the right of confirming these\r\nelections, and of granting investiture of the temporalties, which now\r\nbegan almost universally to be annexed to this spiritual dignity;\r\nwithout which confirmation and investiture, the elected bishop could\r\nneither be consecrated, nor receive any secular profits. This right\r\nwas acknowleged in the emperor Charlemagne, _A.D._ 773, by pope\r\nHadrian I, and the council of Lateran[i], and universally exercised by\r\nother christian princes: but the policy of the court of Rome at the\r\nsame time began by degrees to exclude the laity from any share in\r\nthese elections, and to confine them wholly to the clergy, which at\r\nlength was completely effected; the mere form of election appearing to\r\nthe people to be a thing of little consequence, while the crown was in\r\npossession of an absolute negative, which was almost equivalent to a\r\ndirect right of nomination. Hence the right of appointing to\r\nbishopricks is said to have been in the crown of England[k] (as well\r\nas other kingdoms in Europe) even in the Saxon times, because the\r\nrights of confirmation and investiture were in effect (though not in\r\nform) a right of complete donation[l]. But when, by length of time,\r\nthe custom of making elections by the clergy only was fully\r\nestablished, the popes began to except to the usual method of granting\r\nthese investitures, which was _per annulum et baculum_, by the\r\nprince's delivering to the prelate a ring, and a pastoral staff or\r\ncrosier; pretending, that this was an encroachment on the church's\r\nauthority, and an attempt by these symbols to confer a spiritual\r\njurisdiction: and pope Gregory VII, towards the close of the eleventh\r\ncentury, published a bulle of excommunication against all princes who\r\nshould dare to confer investitures, and all prelates who should\r\nventure to receive them[m]. This was a bold step towards effecting the\r\nplan then adopted by the Roman see, of rendering the clergy intirely\r\nindependent of the civil authority: and long and eager were the\r\ncontests occasioned by this dispute. But at length when the emperor\r\nHenry V agreed to remove all suspicion of encroachment on the\r\nspiritual character, by conferring investitures for the future _per\r\nsceptrum_ and not _per annulum et baculum_; and when the kings of\r\nEngland and France consented also to alter the form in their kingdoms,\r\nand receive only homage from the bishops for their temporalties,\r\ninstead of investing them by the ring and crosier; the court of Rome\r\nfound it prudent to suspend for a while it's other pretensions[n].\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: _per clerum et populum._ Palm. 25. 2 Roll. Rep. 102. M.\r\nParis. _A.D._ 1095.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: _Decret._ 1. _dist._ 63. _c._ 22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Palm. 28.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: \"_Nulla electio praelatorum (sunt verba Ingulphi) erat\r\nmere libera et canonica; sed omnes dignitates tam episcoporum, quam\r\nabbatum, per annulum et baculum regis curia pro sua complacentia\r\nconferebat._\" _Penes clericos et monachos fuit electio, sed electum a\r\nrege postulabant._ Selden. _Jan.

Hist. xxv. 363. xxix. 115.]\r\n\r\nTHIS concession was obtained from king Henry the first in England, by\r\nmeans of that obstinate and arrogant prelate, arch-bishop Anselm[o]:\r\nbut king John (about a century afterwards) in order to obtain the\r\nprotection of the pope against his discontented barons, was prevailed\r\nupon to give up by a charter, to all the monasteries and cathedrals in\r\nthe kingdom, the free right of electing their prelates, whether abbots\r\nor bishops: reserving only to the crown the custody of the\r\ntemporalties during the vacancy; the form of granting a licence to\r\nelect, (which is the original of our _conge d'eslire_) on refusal\r\nwhereof the electors might proceed without it; and the right of\r\napprobation afterwards, which was not to be denied without a\r\nreasonable and lawful cause[p]. This grant was expressly recognized\r\nand confirmed in king John's _magna carta_[q], and was again\r\nestablished by statute 25 Edw. III. st. 6. §. 3.\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: M. Paris. _A.D._ 1107.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: M. Paris. _A.D._ 1214. 1 Rym. _Foed._ 198.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: _cap._ 1. _edit. Oxon._ 1759.]\r\n\r\nBUT by statute 25 Hen. VIII. c. 20. the antient right of nomination\r\nwas, in effect, restored to the crown: it being enacted that, at every\r\nfuture avoidance of a bishoprick, the king may send the dean and\r\nchapter his usual licence to proceed to election; which is always to\r\nbe accompanied with a letter missive from the king, containing the\r\nname of the person whom he would have them elect: and, if the dean and\r\nchapter delay their election above twelve days, the nomination shall\r\ndevolve to the king, who may by letters patent appoint such person as\r\nhe pleases. This election or nomination, if it be of a bishop, must be\r\nsignified by the king's letters patent to the arch-bishop of the\r\nprovince; if it be of an arch-bishop, to the other arch-bishop and two\r\nbishops, or to four bishops; requiring them to confirm, invest, and\r\nconsecrate the person so elected: which they are bound to perform\r\nimmediately, without any application to the see of Rome. After which\r\nthe bishop elect shall sue to the king for his temporalties, shall\r\nmake oath to the king and none other, and shall take restitution of\r\nhis secular possessions out of the king's hands only. And if such dean\r\nand chapter do not elect in the manner by this act appointed, or if\r\nsuch arch-bishop or bishop do refuse to confirm, invest, and\r\nconsecrate such bishop elect, they shall incur all the penalties of a\r\n_praemunire_.\r\n\r\nAN arch-bishop is the chief of the clergy in a whole province; and has\r\nthe inspection of the bishops of that province, as well as of the\r\ninferior clergy, and may deprive them on notorious cause[r]. The\r\narch-bishop has also his own diocese, wherein he exercises episcopal\r\njurisdiction; as in his province he exercises archiepiscopal. As\r\narch-bishop, he, upon receipt of the king's writ, calls the bishops\r\nand clergy of his province to meet in convocation: but without the\r\nking's writ he cannot assemble them[s]. To him all appeals are made\r\nfrom inferior jurisdictions within his province; and, as an appeal\r\nlies from the bishops in person to him in person, so it also lies from\r\nthe consistory courts of each diocese to his archiepiscopal court.\r\nDuring the vacancy of any see in his province, he is guardian of the\r\nspiritualties thereof, as the king is of the temporalties; and he\r\nexecutes all ecclesiastical jurisdiction therein. If an archiepiscopal\r\nsee be vacant, the dean and chapter are the spiritual guardians, ever\r\nsince the office of prior of Canterbury was abolished at the\r\nreformation[t]. The arch-bishop is entitled to present by lapse to all\r\nthe ecclesiastical livings in the disposal of his diocesan bishops,\r\nif not filled within six months. And the arch-bishop has a customary\r\nprerogative, when a bishop is consecrated by him, to name a clerk or\r\nchaplain of his own to be provided for by such suffragan bishop; in\r\nlieu of which it is now usual for the bishop to make over by deed to\r\nthe arch-bishop, his executors and assigns, the next presentation of\r\nsuch dignity or benefice in the bishop's disposal within that see, as\r\nthe arch-bishop himself shall choose; which is therefore called his\r\noption[u]: which options are only binding on the bishop himself who\r\ngrants them, and not his successors. The prerogative itself seems to\r\nbe derived from the legatine power formerly annexed by the popes to\r\nthe metropolitan of Canterbury[w]. And we may add, that the papal\r\nclaim itself (like most others of that encroaching see) was probably\r\nset up in imitation of the imperial prerogative called _primae_ or\r\n_primariae preces_; whereby the emperor exercises, and hath\r\nimmemorially exercised[x], a right of naming to the first prebend that\r\nbecomes vacant after his accession in every church of the empire[y]. A\r\nright, that was also exercised by the crown of England in the reign of\r\nEdward I[z]; and which probably gave rise to the royal corodies, which\r\nwere mentioned in a former chapter[a]. It is also the privilege, by\r\ncustom, of the arch-bishop of Canterbury, to crown the kings and\r\nqueens of this kingdom. And he hath also by the statute 25 Hen. VIII.\r\nc. 21. the power of granting dispensations in any case, not contrary\r\nto the holy scriptures and the law of God, where the pope used\r\nformerly to grant them: which is the foundation of his granting\r\nspecial licences, to marry at any place or time, to hold two livings,\r\nand the like: and on this also is founded the right he exercises of\r\nconferring degrees, in prejudice of the two universities[b].\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Lord Raym. 541.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: 4 Inst. 322, 323.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: 2 Roll. Abr. 223.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: Cowel's interpr. tit. option.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: Sherlock of options. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: Goldast. _constit. imper._ _tom._ 3. _pag._ 406.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Dufresne.

Oxon. 1721.]\r\n\r\nTHE power and authority of a bishop, besides the administration of\r\ncertain holy ordinances peculiar to that sacred order, consists\r\nprincipally in inspecting the manners of the people and clergy, and\r\npunishing them, in order to reformation, by ecclesiastical censures.\r\nTo this purpose he has several courts under him, and may visit at\r\npleasure every part of his diocese. His chancellor is appointed to\r\nhold his courts for him, and to assist him in matters of\r\necclesiastical law; who, as well as all other ecclesiastical officers,\r\nif lay or married, must be a doctor of the civil law, so created in\r\nsome university[c]. It is also the business of a bishop to institute\r\nand to direct induction to all ecclesiastical livings in his diocese.\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Stat. 37 Hen. VIII. c. 17.]\r\n\r\nARCHBISHOPRICKS and bishopricks may become void by death, deprivation\r\nfor any very gross and notorious crime, and also by resignation. All\r\nresignations must be made to some superior[d]. Therefore a bishop must\r\nresign to his metropolitan; but the arch-bishop can resign to none but\r\nthe king himself.\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: Gibs. cod. 822.]\r\n\r\nII. A DEAN and chapter are the council of the bishop, to assist him\r\nwith their advice in affairs of religion, and also in the temporal\r\nconcerns of his see[e]. When the rest of the clergy were settled in\r\nthe several parishes of each diocese (as hath formerly[f] been\r\nmentioned) these were reserved for the celebration of divine service\r\nin the bishop's own cathedral; and the chief of them, who presided\r\nover the rest, obtained the name of _decanus_ or dean, being probably\r\nat first appointed to superintend _ten_ canons or prebendaries.\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: 3 Rep. 75. Co. Litt. 103, 300.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: pag. 108, 109.]\r\n\r\nALL antient deans are elected by the chapter, by _conge d'eslire_ from\r\nthe king, and letters missive of recommendation; in the same manner as\r\nbishops: but in those chapters, that were founded by Henry VIII out of\r\nthe spoils of the dissolved monasteries, the deanery is donative, and\r\nthe installation merely by the king's letters patent[g]. The chapter,\r\nconsisting of canons or prebendaries, are sometimes appointed by the\r\nking, sometimes by the bishop, and sometimes elected by each other.\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Gibs. cod. 173.]\r\n\r\nTHE dean and chapter are, as was before observed, the nominal electors\r\nof a bishop. The bishop is their ordinary and immediate superior; and\r\nhas, generally speaking, the power of visiting them, and correcting\r\ntheir excesses and enormities. They had also a check on the bishop at\r\ncommon law: for till the statute 32 Hen. VIII. c. 28. his grant or\r\nlease would not have bound his successors, unless confirmed by the\r\ndean and chapter[h].\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Co. Litt. 103.]\r\n\r\nDEANERIES and prebends may become void, like a bishoprick, by death,\r\nby deprivation, or by resignation to either the king or the bishop[j].\r\nAlso I may here mention, once for all, that if a dean, prebendary, or\r\nother spiritual person be made a bishop, all the preferments he was\r\nbefore possessed of are void; and the king may present to them in\r\nright of his prerogative royal. But they are not void by the election,\r\nbut only by the consecration[i].\r\n\r\n[Footnote j: Plowd. 498.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: 2 Roll. Abr. 352. Salk. 137. [Transcriber's Note:\r\nFootnotes j and i are in this order in the original.]]\r\n\r\nIII. AN arch-deacon hath an ecclesiastical jurisdiction, immediately\r\nsubordinate to the bishop, throughout the whole of his diocese, or in\r\nsome particular part of it. He is usually appointed by the bishop\r\nhimself; and hath a kind of episcopal authority, originally derived\r\nfrom the bishop, but now independent and distinct from his[k]. He\r\ntherefore visits the clergy; and has his separate court for punishment\r\nof offenders by spiritual censures, and for hearing all other causes\r\nof ecclesiastical cognizance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: 1 Burn. eccl. law. 68, 69.]\r\n\r\nIV. THE rural deans are very antient officers of the church[l], but\r\nalmost grown out of use; though their deaneries still subsist as an\r\necclesiastical division of the diocese, or archdeaconry. They seem to\r\nhave been deputies of the bishop, planted all round his diocese, the\r\nbetter to inspect the conduct of the parochial clergy, and therefore\r\narmed with an inferior degree of judicial and coercive authority[m].\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: Kennet. par. antiq. 633.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: Gibs. cod. 972.]\r\n\r\nV. THE next, and indeed the most numerous order of men in the system\r\nof ecclesiastical polity, are the parsons and vicars of parishes: in\r\ntreating of whom I shall first mark out the distinction between them;\r\nshall next observe the method by which one may become a parson or\r\nvicar; shall then briefly touch upon their rights and duties; and\r\nshall, lastly, shew how one may cease to be either.\r\n\r\nA PARSON, _persona ecclesiae_, is one that hath full possession of all\r\nthe rights of a parochial church. He is called parson, _persona_,\r\nbecause by his person the church, which is an invisible body, is\r\nrepresented; and he is in himself a body corporate, in order to\r\nprotect and defend the rights of the church (which he personates) by a\r\nperpetual succession[n]. He is sometimes called the rector, or\r\ngovernor, of the church: but the appellation of _parson_, (however it\r\nmay be depreciated by familiar, clownish, and indiscriminate use) is\r\nthe most legal, most beneficial, and most honourable title that a\r\nparish priest can enjoy; because such a one, (sir Edward Coke\r\nobserves) and he only, is said _vicem seu personam ecclesiae gerere_.\r\nA parson has, during his life, the freehold in himself of the\r\nparsonage house, the glebe, the tithes, and other dues. But these are\r\nsometimes _appropriated_; that is to say, the benefice is perpetually\r\nannexed to some spiritual corporation, either sole or aggregate, being\r\nthe patron of the living; whom the law esteems equally capable of\r\nproviding for the service of the church, as any single private\r\nclergyman. This contrivance seems to have sprung from the policy of\r\nthe monastic orders, who have never been deficient in subtle\r\ninventions for the increase of their own power and emoluments. At the\r\nfirst establishment of parochial clergy, the tithes of the parish were\r\ndistributed in a fourfold division; one for the use of the bishop,\r\nanother for maintaining the fabrick of the church, a third for the\r\npoor, and the fourth to provide for the incumbent. When the sees of\r\nthe bishops became otherwise amply endowed, they were prohibited from\r\ndemanding their usual share of these tithes, and the division was into\r\nthree parts only. And hence it was inferred by the monasteries, that a\r\nsmall part was sufficient for the officiating priest, and that the\r\nremainder might well be applied to the use of their own fraternities,\r\n(the endowment of which was construed to be a work of the most exalted\r\npiety) subject to the burthen of repairing the church and providing\r\nfor it's constant supply. And therefore they begged and bought, for\r\nmasses and obits, and sometimes even for money, all the advowsons\r\nwithin their reach, and then appropriated the benefices to the use of\r\ntheir own corporation. But, in order to complete such appropriation\r\neffectually, the king's licence, and consent of the bishop, must first\r\nbe obtained; because both the king and the bishop may sometime or\r\nother have an interest, by lapse, in the presentation to the benefice;\r\nwhich can never happen if it be appropriated to the use of a\r\ncorporation, which never dies: and also because the law reposes a\r\nconfidence in them, that they will not consent to any thing that shall\r\nbe to the prejudice of the church. The consent of the patron also is\r\nnecessarily implied, because (as was before observed) the\r\nappropriation can be originally made to none, but to such spiritual\r\ncorporation, as is also the patron of the church; the whole being\r\nindeed nothing else, but an allowance for the patrons to retain the\r\ntithes and glebe in their own hands, without presenting any clerk,\r\nthey themselves undertaking to provide for the service of the\r\nchurch[o]. When the appropriation is thus made, the appropriators and\r\ntheir successors are perpetual parsons of the church; and must sue and\r\nbe sued, in all matters concerning the rights of the church, by the\r\nname of parsons[p].\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: Co. Litt. 300.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: Plowd. 496-500.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: Hob. 307.]\r\n\r\nTHIS appropriation may be severed, and the church become\r\ndisappropriate, two ways: as, first, if the patron or appropriator\r\npresents a clerk, who is instituted and inducted to the parsonage:\r\nfor the incumbent so instituted and inducted is to all intents and\r\npurposes complete parson; and the appropriation, being once severed,\r\ncan never be re-united again, unless by a repetition of the same\r\nsolemnities[q]. And when the clerk so presented is distinct from the\r\nvicar, the rectory thus vested in him becomes what is called a\r\n_sine-cure_; because he hath no cure of souls, having a vicar under\r\nhim to whom that cure is committed[r]. Also, if the corporation which\r\nhas the appropriation is dissolved, the parsonage becomes\r\ndisappropriate at common law; because the perpetuity of person is\r\ngone, which is necessary to support the appropriation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: Co. Litt. 46.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Sine-cures might also be created by other means. 2 Burn.\r\neccl. law. 347.]\r\n\r\nIN this manner, and subject to these conditions, may appropriations be\r\nmade at this day: and thus were most, if not all, of the\r\nappropriations at present existing originally made; being annexed to\r\nbishopricks, prebends, religious houses, nay, even to nunneries, and\r\ncertain military orders, all of which were spiritual corporations. At\r\nthe dissolution of monasteries by statutes 27 Hen. VIII. c. 28. and 31\r\nHen. VIII. c. 13. the appropriations of the several parsonages, which\r\nbelonged to those respective religious houses, (amounting to more than\r\none third of all the parishes in England[s]) would have been by the\r\nrules of the common law disappropriated; had not a clause in those\r\nstatutes intervened, to give them to the king in as ample a manner as\r\nthe abbots, &c, formerly held the same, at the time of their\r\ndissolution. This, though perhaps scarcely defensible, was not without\r\nexample; for the same was done in former reigns, when the alien\r\npriories, (that is, such as were filled by foreigners only) were\r\ndissolved and given to the crown[t]. And from these two roots have\r\nsprung all the lay appropriations or secular parsonages, which we now\r\nsee in the kingdom; they having been afterwards granted out from time\r\nto time by the crown[u].\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: Seld. review of tith. c. 9. Spelm. Apology. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: 2 Inst. 584.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: Sir H. Spelman (of tythes, c. 29.) says these are now\r\ncalled impropriations, as being _improperly_ in the hands of laymen.]\r\n\r\nTHESE appropriating corporations, or religious houses, were wont to\r\ndepute one of their own body to perform divine service, and administer\r\nthe sacraments, in those parishes of which the society was thus the\r\nparson. This officiating minister was in reality no more than a\r\ncurate, deputy, or vicegerent of the appropriator, and therefore\r\ncalled _vicarius_, or _vicar_. His stipend was at the discretion of\r\nthe appropriator, who was however bound of common right to find\r\nsomebody, _qui illi de temporalibus, episcopo de spiritualibus, debeat\r\nrespondere_[w]. But this was done in so scandalous a manner, and the\r\nparishes suffered so much by the neglect of the appropriators, that\r\nthe legislature was forced to interpose: and accordingly it is enacted\r\nby statute 15 Ric. II. c. 6. that in all appropriations of churches,\r\nthe diocesan bishop shall ordain (in proportion to the value of the\r\nchurch) a competent sum to be distributed among the poor parishioners\r\nannually; and that the vicarage shall be _sufficiently_ endowed. It\r\nseems the parish were frequently sufferers, not only by the want of\r\ndivine service, but also by withholding those alms, for which, among\r\nother purposes, the payment of tithes was originally imposed: and\r\ntherefore in this act a pension is directed to be distributed among\r\nthe poor parochians, as well as a sufficient stipend to the vicar. But\r\nhe, being liable to be removed at the pleasure of the appropriator,\r\nwas not likely to insist too rigidly on the legal sufficiency of the\r\nstipend: and therefore by statute 4 Hen. IV. c. 12. it is ordained,\r\nthat the vicar shall be a secular person, not a member of any\r\nreligious house; that he shall be vicar perpetual, not removeable at\r\nthe caprice of the monastery; and that he shall be canonically\r\ninstituted and inducted, and be sufficiently endowed, at the\r\ndiscretion of the ordinary, for these three express purposes, to do\r\ndivine service, to inform the people, and to keep hospitality. The\r\nendowments in consequence of these statutes have usually been by a\r\nportion of the glebe, or land, belonging to the parsonage, and a\r\nparticular share of the tithes, which the appropriators found it most\r\ntroublesome to collect, and which are therefore generally called\r\nprivy, small, or vicarial, tithes; the greater, or predial, tithes\r\nbeing still referred to their own use. But one and the same rule was\r\nnot observed in the endowment of all vicarages. Hence some are more\r\nliberally, and some more scantily, endowed; and hence many things, as\r\nwood in particular, is in some countries a predial, and in some a\r\nvicarial tithe.\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: Seld. tith. c. 11. 1.]\r\n\r\nTHE distinction therefore of a parson and vicar is this; that the\r\nparson has for the most part the whole right to all the ecclesiastical\r\ndues in his parish; but a vicar has generally an appropriator over\r\nhim, entitled to the best part of the profits, to whom he is in effect\r\nperpetual curate, with a standing salary. Though in some places the\r\nvicarage has been considerably augmented by a large share of the great\r\ntithes; which augmentations were greatly assisted by the statute 29\r\nCar. II. c. 8. enacted in favour of poor vicars and curates, which\r\nrendered such temporary augmentations (when made by the appropriators)\r\nperpetual.\r\n\r\nTHE method of becoming a parson or vicar is much the same. To both\r\nthere are four requisites necessary: holy orders; presentation;\r\ninstitution; and induction. The method of conferring the holy orders\r\nof deacon and priest, according to the liturgy and canons[x], is\r\nforeign to the purpose of these commentaries; any farther than as they\r\nare necessary requisites to make a complete parson or vicar. By common\r\nlaw a deacon, of any age, might be instituted and inducted to a\r\nparsonage or vicarage: but it was ordained by statute 13 Eliz. c. 12.\r\nthat no person under twenty three years of age, and in deacon's\r\norders, should be presented to any benefice with cure; and if he were\r\nnot ordained priest within one year after his induction, he should be\r\n_ipso facto_ deprived: and now, by statute 13 & 14 Car. II. c. 4. no\r\nperson is capable to be admitted to any benefice, unless he hath been\r\nfirst ordained a priest; and then he is, in the language of the law, a\r\nclerk in orders. But if he obtains orders, or a licence to preach, by\r\nmoney or corrupt practices (which seems to be the true, though not the\r\ncommon notion of simony) the person giving such orders forfeits[y]\r\n40_l._ and the person receiving 10_l._ and is incapable of any\r\necclesiastical preferment for seven years afterwards.\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: See 2 Burn. eccl. law. 103.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Stat. 31 Eliz. c. 6.]\r\n\r\nANY clerk may be presented[z] to a parsonage or vicarage; that is, the\r\npatron, to whom the advowson of the church belongs, may offer his\r\nclerk to the bishop of the diocese to be instituted. Of advowsons, or\r\nthe right of presentation, being a species of private property, we\r\nshall find a more convenient place to treat in the second part of\r\nthese commentaries. But when a clerk is presented, the bishop may\r\nrefuse him upon many accounts. As, 1. If the patron is excommunicated,\r\nand remains in contempt forty days[a]. Or, 2. If the clerk be\r\nunfit[b]: which unfitness is of several kinds. First, with regard to\r\nhis person; as if he be a bastard, an outlaw, an excommunicate, an\r\nalien, under age, or the like[c]. Next, with regard to his faith or\r\nmorals; as for any particular heresy, or vice that is _malum in se_:\r\nbut if the bishop alleges only in generals, as that he is\r\n_schismaticus inveteratus_, or objects a fault that is _malum\r\nprohibitum_ merely, as haunting taverns, playing at unlawful games, or\r\nthe like; it is not good cause of refusal[d]. Or, lastly, the clerk\r\nmay be unfit to discharge the pastoral office for want of learning. In\r\nany of which cases the bishop may refuse the clerk. In case the\r\nrefusal is for heresy, schism, inability of learning, or other matter\r\nof ecclesiastical cognizance, there the bishop must give notice to the\r\npatron of such his cause of refusal, who, being usually a layman, is\r\nnot supposed to have knowlege of it; else he cannot present by lapse:\r\nbut if the cause be temporal, there he is not bound to give notice[e].\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: A layman may also be presented; but he must take priests\r\norders before his admission. 1 Burn. 103.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: 2 Roll. Abr. 355.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Glanv. _l._ 13. _c._ 20.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: 2 Roll. Abr. 356. 2 Inst. 632. Stat. 3 Ric. II. c. 3. 7\r\nRic. II. c. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: 5 Rep. 58.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: 2 Inst. 632.]\r\n\r\nIF an action at law be brought by the patron against the bishop, for\r\nrefusing his clerk, the bishop must assign the cause. If the cause be\r\nof a temporal nature and the fact admitted, (as, for instance,\r\noutlawry) the judges of the king's courts must determine it's\r\nvalidity, or, whether it be sufficient cause of refusal: but if the\r\nfact be denied, it must be determined by a jury. If the cause be of a\r\nspiritual nature, (as, heresy, particularly alleged) the fact if\r\ndenied shall also be determined by a jury; and if the fact be admitted\r\nor found, the court upon consultation and advice of learned divines\r\nshall decide it's sufficiency[f]. If the cause be want of learning,\r\nthe bishop need not specify in what points the clerk is deficient, but\r\nonly allege that he _is_ deficient[g]: for the statute 9 Edw. II. st.\r\n1. c. 13. is express, that the examination of the fitness of a person\r\npresented to a benefice belongs to the ecclesiastical judge. But\r\nbecause it would be nugatory in this case to demand the reason of\r\nrefusal from the ordinary, if the patron were bound to abide by his\r\ndetermination, who has already pronounced his clerk unfit; therefore\r\nif the bishop returns the clerk to be _minus sufficiens in\r\nliteratura_, the court shall write to the metropolitan, to reexamine\r\nhim, and certify his qualifications; which certificate of the\r\narch-bishop is final[h].\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: 2 Inst. 632.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: 5 Rep. 58. 3 Lev. 313.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: 2 Inst. 632.]\r\n\r\nIF the bishop hath no objections, but admits the patron's\r\npresentation, the clerk so admitted is next to be instituted by him;\r\nwhich is a kind of investiture of the spiritual part of the benefice:\r\nfor by institution the care of the souls of the parish is committed to\r\nthe charge of the clerk. When a vicar is instituted, he (besides the\r\nusual forms) takes, if required by the bishop, an oath of perpetual\r\nresidence; for the maxim of law is, that _vicarius non habet\r\nvicarium_: and as the non-residence of the appropriators was the cause\r\nof the perpetual establishment of vicarages, the law judges it very\r\nimproper for them to defeat the end of their constitution, and by\r\nabsence to create the very mischiefs which they were appointed to\r\nremedy: especially as, if any profits are to arise from putting in a\r\ncurate and living at a distance from the parish, the appropriator, who\r\nis the real parson, has undoubtedly the elder title to them. When the\r\nordinary is also the patron, and _confers_ the living, the\r\npresentation and institution are one and the same act, and are called\r\na collation to a benefice. By institution or collation the church is\r\nfull, so that there can be no fresh presentation till another vacancy,\r\nat least in the case of a common patron; but the church is not full\r\nagainst the king, till induction: nay, even if a clerk is instituted\r\nupon the king's presentation, the crown may revoke it before\r\ninduction, and present another clerk[i]. Upon institution also the\r\nclerk may enter on the parsonage house and glebe, and take the tithes;\r\nbut he cannot grant or let them, or bring any action for them, till\r\ninduction.\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: Co. Litt. 344.]\r\n\r\nINDUCTION is performed by a mandate from the bishop to the\r\narch-deacon, who usually issues out a precept to other clergymen to\r\nperform it for him. It is done by giving the clerk corporal possession\r\nof the church, as by holding the ring of the door, tolling a bell, or\r\nthe like; and is a form required by law, with intent to give all the\r\nparishioners due notice, and sufficient certainty of their new\r\nminister, to whom their tithes are to be paid. This therefore is the\r\ninvestiture of the temporal part of the benefice, as institution is of\r\nthe spiritual. And when a clerk is thus presented, instituted, and\r\ninducted into a rectory, he is then, and not before, in full and\r\ncomplete possession, and is called in law _persona impersonata_, or\r\nparson imparsonee[k].\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Co. Litt. 300.]\r\n\r\nTHE rights of a parson or vicar, in his tithes and ecclesiastical\r\ndues, fall more properly under the second book of these commentaries:\r\nand as to his duties, they are principally of ecclesiastical\r\ncognizance; those only excepted which are laid upon him by statute.\r\nAnd those are indeed so numerous that it is impracticable to recite\r\nthem here with any tolerable conciseness or accuracy. Some of them we\r\nmay remark, as they arise in the progress of our enquiries, but for\r\nthe rest I must refer myself to such authors as have compiled\r\ntreatises expressly upon this subject[l]. I shall only just mention\r\nthe article of residence, upon the supposition of which the law doth\r\nstile every parochial minister an incumbent. By statute 21 Hen. VIII.\r\nc. 13. persons wilfully absenting themselves from their benefices, for\r\none month together, or two months in the year, incur a penalty of\r\n5_l._ to the king, and 5_l._ to any person that will sue for the same:\r\nexcept chaplains to the king, or others therein mentioned[m], during\r\ntheir attendance in the houshold of such as retain them: and also\r\nexcept[n] all heads of houses, magistrates, and professors in the\r\nuniversities, and all students under forty years of age residing\r\nthere, _bona fide_, for study. Legal residence is not only in the\r\nparish, but also in the parsonage house: for it hath been resolved[o],\r\nthat the statute intended residence, not only for serving the cure,\r\nand for hospitality; but also for maintaining the house, that the\r\nsuccessor also may keep hospitality there.\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: These are very numerous: but there are only two, which\r\ncan be relied on with any degree of certainty; bishop Gibson's\r\n_codex_, and Dr Burn's ecclesiastical law.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: Stat. 25 Hen. VIII. c. 16. 33 Hen. VIII. c. 28.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: Stat. 28 Hen. VIII. c. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: 6 Rep. 21.]\r\n\r\nWE have seen that there is but one way, whereby one may become a\r\nparson or vicar: there are many ways, by which one may cease to be so.\r\n1. By death. 2. By cession, in taking another benefice. For by statute\r\n21 Hen. VIII. c. 13. if any one having a benefice of 8_l._ _per\r\nannum_, or upwards, in the king's books, (according to the present\r\nvaluation[p],) accepts any other, the first shall be adjudged void;\r\nunless he obtains a dispensation; which no one is entitled to have,\r\nbut the chaplains of the king and others therein mentioned, the\r\nbrethren and sons of lords and knights, and doctors and bachelors of\r\ndivinity and law, _admitted by the universities_ of this realm. And a\r\nvacancy thus made, for want of a dispensation, is called cession. 3.\r\nBy consecration; for, as was mentioned before, when a clerk is\r\npromoted to a bishoprick, all his other preferments are void the\r\ninstant that he is consecrated. But there is a method, by the favour\r\nof the crown, of holding such livings _in commendam_. _Commenda_, or\r\n_ecclesia commendata_, is a living commended by the crown to the care\r\nof a clerk, to hold till a proper pastor is provided for it. This may\r\nbe temporary, for one, two, or three years, or perpetual; being a kind\r\nof dispensation to avoid the vacancy of the living, and is called a\r\n_commenda retinere_. There is also a _commenda recipere_, which is to\r\ntake a benefice _de novo_, in the bishop's own gift, or the gift of\r\nsome other patron consenting to the same; and this is the same to him\r\nas institution and induction are to another clerk[q]. 4. By\r\nresignation. But this is of no avail, till accepted by the ordinary;\r\ninto whose hands the resignation must be made[r]. 5. By deprivation,\r\neither by canonical censures, of which I am not to speak; or in\r\npursuance of divers penal statutes, which declare the benefice void,\r\nfor some nonfeasance or neglect, or else some malefeasance or crime.\r\nAs, for simony[s]; for maintaining any doctrine in derogation of the\r\nking's supremacy, or of the thirty nine articles, or of the book of\r\ncommon-prayer[t]; for neglecting after institution to read the\r\narticles in the church, or make the declarations against popery, or\r\ntake the abjuration oath[u]; for using any other form of prayer than\r\nthe liturgy of the church of England[w]; or for absenting himself\r\nsixty days in one year from a benefice belonging to a popish patron,\r\nto which the clerk was presented by either of the universities[x]; in\r\nall which and similar cases[y] the benefice is _ipso facto_ void,\r\nwithout any formal sentence of deprivation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: Cro. Car. 456.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: Hob. 144.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Cro. Jac. 198.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: Stat. 31 Eliz. c. 6. and 12 Ann. c. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: Stat. 1 Eliz. c. 1 & 2. and 13 Eliz. c. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: Stat. 13 Eliz. c. 12. 14 Car. II. c. 4. and 1 Geo. I. c.\r\n6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: Stat. 1 Eliz. c. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: Stat. 1 W. & M. c. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: 6 Rep. 29, 30.]\r\n\r\nVI. A CURATE is the lowest degree in the church; being in the same\r\nstate that a vicar was formerly, an officiating temporary minister,\r\ninstead of the real incumbent. Though there are what are called\r\n_perpetual_ curacies, where all the tithes are appropriated, and no\r\nvicarage endowed, (being for some particular reasons[z] exempted from\r\nthe statute of Hen. IV) but, instead thereof, such perpetual curate is\r\nappointed by the appropriator. With regard to the other species of\r\ncurates, they are the objects of some particular statutes, which\r\nordain, that such as serve a church during it's vacancy shall be paid\r\nsuch stipend as the ordinary thinks reasonable, out of the profits of\r\nthe vacancy; or, if that be not sufficient, by the successor within\r\nfourteen days after he takes possession[a]: and that, if any rector or\r\nvicar nominates a curate to the ordinary to be licenced, the ordinary\r\nshall settle his stipend under his hand and seal, not exceeding 50_l._\r\n_per annum_, nor less than 20_l._ and on failure of payment may\r\nsequester the profits of the benefice[b].\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: 1 Burn. eccl. law. 427.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: Stat. 28 Hen. VIII. c. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Stat. 12 Ann. st. 2. c. 12.]\r\n\r\nTHUS much of the clergy, properly so called. There are also certain\r\ninferior ecclesiastical officers of whom the common law takes notice;\r\nand that, principally, to assist the ecclesiastical jurisdiction,\r\nwhere it is deficient in powers. On which officers I shall make a few\r\ncursory remarks.\r\n\r\nVII. CHURCHWARDENS are the guardians or keepers of the church, and\r\nrepresentatives of the body of the parish[c]. They are sometimes\r\nappointed by the minister, sometimes by the parish, sometimes by both\r\ntogether, as custom directs. They are taken, in favour of the church,\r\nto be for some purposes a kind of corporation at the common law; that\r\nis, they are enabled by that name to have a property in goods and\r\nchattels, and to bring actions for them, for the use and profit of the\r\nparish. Yet they may not waste the church goods, but may be removed by\r\nthe parish, and then called to account by action at the common law:\r\nbut there is no method of calling them to account, but by first\r\nremoving them; for none can legally do it, but those who are put in\r\ntheir place. As to lands, or other real property, as the church,\r\nchurch-yard, &c, they have no sort of interest therein; but if any\r\ndamage is done thereto, the parson only or vicar shall have the\r\naction. Their office also is to repair the church, and make rates and\r\nlevies for that purpose: but these are recoverable only in the\r\necclesiastical court. They are also joined with the overseers in the\r\ncare and maintenance of the poor. They are to levy[d] a shilling\r\nforfeiture on all such as do not repair to church on sundays and\r\nholidays, and are empowered to keep all persons orderly while there;\r\nto which end it has been held that a churchwarden may justify the\r\npulling off a man's hat, without being guilty of either an assault or\r\ntrespass[e]. There are also a multitude of other petty parochial\r\npowers committed to their charge by divers acts of parliament[f].\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: In Sweden they have similar officers, whom they call\r\n_kiorckiowariandes_. Stiernhook. l. 3. c. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: Stat. 1 Eliz. c. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: 1 Lev. 196.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: See Lambard of churchwardens, at the end of his\r\n_eirenarcha_; and Dr Burn, tit. _church, churchwardens, visitation_.]\r\n\r\nVIII. PARISH clerks and sextons are also regarded by the common law,\r\nas persons who have freeholds in their offices; and therefore though\r\nthey may be punished, yet they cannot be deprived, by ecclesiastical\r\ncensures[g]. The parish clerk was formerly always in holy orders; and\r\nsome are so to this day. He is generally appointed by the incumbent,\r\nbut by custom may be chosen by the inhabitants; and if such custom\r\nappears, the court of king's bench will grant a _mandamus_ to the\r\narch-deacon to swear him in, for the establishment of the custom turns\r\nit into a temporal or civil right[h].\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: 2 Roll. Abr. 234.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Cro. Car. 589.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE TWELFTH.\r\n\r\nOF THE CIVIL STATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE lay part of his majesty's subjects, or such of the people as are\r\nnot comprehended under the denomination of clergy, may be divided into\r\nthree distinct states, the civil, the military, and the maritime.\r\n\r\nTHAT part of the nation which falls under our first and most\r\ncomprehensive division, the civil state, includes all orders of men,\r\nfrom the highest nobleman to the meanest peasant; that are not\r\nincluded under either our former division, of clergy, or under one of\r\nthe two latter, the military and maritime states: and it may sometimes\r\ninclude individuals of the other three orders; since a nobleman, a\r\nknight, a gentleman, or a peasant, may become either a divine, a\r\nsoldier, or a seaman.\r\n\r\nTHE civil state consists of the nobility and the commonalty. Of the\r\nnobility, the peerage of Great Britain, or lords temporal, as forming\r\n(together with the bishops) one of the supreme branches of the\r\nlegislature, I have before sufficiently spoken: we are here to\r\nconsider them according to their several degrees, or titles of\r\nhonour.\r\n\r\nALL degrees of nobility and honour are derived from the king as their\r\nfountain[a]: and he may institute what new titles he pleases. Hence it\r\nis that all degrees of honour are not of equal antiquity. Those now in\r\nuse are dukes, marquesses, earls, viscounts, and barons[b].\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: 4 Inst. 363.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: For the original of these titles on the continent of\r\nEurope, and their subsequent introduction into this island, see Mr\r\nSelden's _titles of honour_.]\r\n\r\n1. A _duke_, though it be with us, as a mere title of nobility,\r\ninferior in point of antiquity to many others, yet it is superior to\r\nall of them in rank; being the first title of dignity after the royal\r\nfamily[c]. Among the Saxons the Latin name of dukes, _duces_, is very\r\nfrequent, and signified, as among the Romans, the commanders or\r\nleaders of their armies, whom in their own language they called\r\n[Anglo-Saxon: heretoga][d]; and in the laws of Henry I (as translated\r\nby Lambard) we find them called _heretochii_. But after the Norman\r\nconquest, which changed the military polity of the nation, the kings\r\nthemselves continuing for many generations _dukes_ of Normandy, they\r\nwould not honour any subjects with that title, till the time of Edward\r\nIII; who, claiming to be king of France, and thereby losing the ducal\r\nin the royal dignity, in the eleventh year of his reign created his\r\nson, Edward the black prince, duke of Cornwall: and many, of the royal\r\nfamily especially, were afterwards raised to the same honour. However,\r\nin the reign of queen Elizabeth, _A.D._ 1572[e], the whole order\r\nbecame utterly extinct: but it was revived about fifty years\r\nafterwards by her successor, who was remarkably prodigal of honours,\r\nin the person of George Villiers duke of Buckingham.\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Camden. Britan. _tit. ordines_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: This is apparently derived from the same root as the\r\nGerman [Fraktur: hertzogen], the antient appellation of dukes in that\r\ncountry. Seld. tit. hon. 2. 1. 22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Camden. Britan. _tit. ordines_. Spelman. _Gloss._ 191.]\r\n\r\n2. A _marquess_, _marchio_, is the next degree of nobility. His office\r\nformerly was (for dignity and duty were never separated by our\r\nancestors) to guard the frontiers and limits of the kingdom; which\r\nwere called the marches, from the teutonic word, _marche_, a limit:\r\nas, in particular, were the marches of Wales and Scotland, while they\r\ncontinued to be enemies countries. The persons who had command there,\r\nwere called lords marchers, or marquesses; whose authority was\r\nabolished by statute 27 Hen. VIII. c. 27: though the title had long\r\nbefore been made a mere ensign of honour; Robert Vere, earl of Oxford,\r\nbeing created marquess of Dublin, by Richard II in the eighth year of\r\nhis reign[f].\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: 2 Inst. 5.]\r\n\r\n3. AN _earl_ is a title of nobility so antient, that it's original\r\ncannot clearly be traced out. Thus much seems tolerably certain: that\r\namong the Saxons they were called _ealdormen_, _quasi_ elder men,\r\nsignifying the same as _senior_ or _senator_ among the Romans; and\r\nalso _schiremen_, because they had each of them the civil government\r\nof a several division or shire. On the irruption of the Danes, they\r\nchanged the name to _eorles_, which, according to Camden[g], signified\r\nthe same in their language. In Latin they are called _comites_ (a\r\ntitle first used in the empire) from being the king's attendants; \"_a\r\nsocietate nomen sumpserunt, reges enim tales sibi associant_[h].\"\r\nAfter the Norman conquest they were for some time called _counts_, or\r\n_countees_, from the French; but they did not long retain that name\r\nthemselves, though their shires are from thence called counties to\r\nthis day. It is now become a mere title, they having nothing to do\r\nwith the government of the county; which, as has been more than once\r\nobserved, is now entirely devolved on the sheriff, the earl's deputy,\r\nor _vice-comes_. In all writs, and commissions, and other formal\r\ninstruments, the king, when he mentions any peer of the degree of an\r\nearl, always stiles him \"trusty and well beloved _cousin_:\" an\r\nappellation as antient as the reign of Henry IV; who being either by\r\nhis wife, his mother, or his sisters, actually related or allied to\r\nevery earl in the kingdom, artfully and constantly acknowleged that\r\nconnexion in all his letters and other public acts; from whence the\r\nusage has descended to his successors, though the reason has long ago\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Bracton. _l._ 1. _c._ 8. Fleta. _l._ i. _c._ 5.]\r\n\r\n4. THE name of _vice-comes_ or _viscount_ was afterwards made use of\r\nas an arbitrary title of honour, without any shadow of office\r\npertaining to it, by Henry the sixth; when in the eighteenth year of\r\nhis reign, he created John Beaumont a peer, by the name of viscount\r\nBeaumont, which was the first instance of the kind[i].\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: 2 Inst. 5.]\r\n\r\n5. A _baron_'s is the most general and universal title of nobility;\r\nfor originally every one of the peers of superior rank had also a\r\nbarony annexed to his other titles[k]. But it hath sometimes happened\r\nthat, when an antient baron hath been raised to a new degree of\r\npeerage, in the course of a few generations the two titles have\r\ndescended differently; one perhaps to the male descendants, the other\r\nto the heirs general; whereby the earldom or other superior title hath\r\nsubsisted without a barony: and there are also modern instances where\r\nearls and viscounts have been created without annexing a barony to\r\ntheir other honours: so that now the rule does not hold universally,\r\nthat all peers are barons. The original and antiquity of baronies has\r\noccasioned great enquiries among our English antiquarians. The most\r\nprobable opinion seems to be, that they were the same with our present\r\nlords of manors; to which the name of court baron, (which is the\r\nlord's court, and incident to every manor) gives some countenance. It\r\nmay be collected from king John's _magna carta_[l], that originally\r\nall lords of manors, or barons, that held of the king _in capite_, had\r\nseats in the great council or parliament, till about the reign of that\r\nprince the conflux of them became so large and troublesome, that the\r\nking was obliged to divide them, and summon only the greater barons in\r\nperson; leaving the small ones to be summoned by the sheriff, and (as\r\nit is said) to sit by representation in another house; which gave rise\r\nto the separation of the two houses of parliament[m]. By degrees the\r\ntitle came to be confined to the greater barons, or lords of\r\nparliament only; and there were no other barons among the peerage but\r\nsuch as were summoned by writ, in respect of the tenure of their lands\r\nor baronies, till Richard the second first made it a mere title of\r\nhonor, by conferring it on divers persons by his letters patent[n].\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: 2 Inst. 5, 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: _cap._ 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: Gilb. hist. exch. c. 3. Seld. tit. of hon. 2. 5. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: 1 Inst. 9. Seld. _Jan. Angl._ 2. §. 66.]\r\n\r\nHAVING made this short enquiry into the original of our several\r\ndegrees of nobility, I shall next consider the manner in which they\r\nmay be created. The right of peerage seems to have been originally\r\nterritorial; that is, annexed to lands, honors, castles, manors, and\r\nthe like, the proprietors and possessors of which were (in right of\r\nthose estates) allowed to be peers of the realm, and were summoned to\r\nparliament to do suit and service to their sovereign: and, when the\r\nland was alienated, the dignity passed with it as appendant. Thus the\r\nbishops still sit in the house of lords in right of succession to\r\ncertain antient baronies annexed, or supposed to be annexed, to their\r\nepiscopal lands[o]: and thus, in 11 Hen. VI, the possession of the\r\ncastle of Arundel was adjudged to confer an earldom on it's\r\npossessor[p]. But afterwards, when alienations grew to be frequent,\r\nthe dignity of peerage was confined to the lineage of the party\r\nennobled, and instead of territorial became personal. Actual proof of\r\na tenure by barony became no longer necessary to constitute a lord of\r\nparliament; but the record of the writ of summons to them or their\r\nancestors was admitted as a sufficient evidence of the tenure.\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: Glanv. _l._ 7. _c._ 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: Seld. tit. of hon. b. 2. c. 9. §. 5.]\r\n\r\nPEERS are now created either by writ, or by patent: for those who\r\nclaim by prescription must suppose either a writ or patent made to\r\ntheir ancestors; though by length of time it is lost. The creation by\r\nwrit, or the king's letter, is a summons to attend the house of peers,\r\nby the stile and title of that barony, which the king is pleased to\r\nconfer: that by patent is a royal grant to a subject of any dignity\r\nand degree of peerage. The creation by writ is the more antient way;\r\nbut a man is not ennobled thereby, unless he actually takes his seat\r\nin the house of lords: and therefore the most usual, because the\r\nsurest, way is to grant the dignity by patent, which enures to a man\r\nand his heirs according to the limitations thereof, though he never\r\nhimself makes use of it[q]. Yet it is frequent to call up the eldest\r\nson of a peer to the house of lords by writ of summons, in the name of\r\nhis father's barony: because in that case there is no danger of his\r\nchildren's losing the nobility in case he never takes his seat; for\r\nthey will succeed to their grand-father. Creation by writ has also one\r\nadvantage over that by patent: for a person created by writ holds the\r\ndignity to him _and his heirs_, without any words to that purport in\r\nthe writ; but in letters patent there must be words to direct the\r\ninheritance, else the dignity enures only to the grantee for life[r].\r\nFor a man or woman may be created noble for their own lives, and the\r\ndignity not descend to their heirs at all, or descend only to some\r\nparticular heirs: as where a peerage is limited to a man, and the\r\nheirs male of his body by Elizabeth his present lady, and not to such\r\nheirs by any former or future wife.\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: Co. Litt. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Co. Litt. 9. 16.]\r\n\r\nLET us next take a view of a few of the principal incidents attending\r\nthe nobility, exclusive of their capacity as members of parliament,\r\nand as hereditary counsellors of the crown; both of which we have\r\nbefore considered. And first we must observe, that in criminal cases,\r\na nobleman shall be tried by his peers. The great are always obnoxious\r\nto popular envy: were they to be judged by the people, they might be\r\nin danger from the prejudice of their judges; and would moreover be\r\ndeprived of the privilege of the meanest subjects, that of being tried\r\nby their equals, which is secured to all the realm by _magna carta_,\r\nc. 29. It is said, that this does not extend to bishops; who, though\r\nthey are lords of parliament, and sit there by virtue of their\r\nbaronies which they hold _jure ecclesiae_, yet are not ennobled in\r\nblood, and consequently not peers with the nobility[s]. As to\r\npeeresses, no provision was made for their trial when accused of\r\ntreason or felony, till after Eleanor dutchess of Gloucester, wife to\r\nthe lord protector, had been accused of treason and found guilty of\r\nwitchcraft, in an ecclesiastical synod, through the intrigues of\r\ncardinal Beaufort. This very extraordinary trial gave occasion to a\r\nspecial statute, 20 Hen. VI. c. 9. which enacts that peeresses either\r\nin their own right, or by marriage, shall be tried before the same\r\njudicature as peers of the realm. If a woman, noble in her own right,\r\nmarries a commoner, she still remains noble, and shall be tried by her\r\npeers: but if she be only noble by marriage, then by a second\r\nmarriage, with a commoner, she loses her dignity; for as by marriage\r\nit is gained, by marriage it is also lost. Yet if a duchess dowager\r\nmarries a baron, she continues a duchess still; for all the nobility\r\nare _pares_, and therefore it is no degradation[t]. A peer, or peeress\r\n(either in her own right or by marriage) cannot be arrested in civil\r\ncases[u]: and they have also many peculiar privileges annexed to their\r\npeerage in the course of judicial proceedings. A peer, sitting in\r\njudgment, gives not his verdict upon oath, like an ordinary juryman,\r\nbut upon his honour[w]: he answers also to bills in chancery upon his\r\nhonour, and not upon his oath[x]; but, when he is examined as a\r\nwitness either in civil or criminal cases, he must be sworn[y]: for\r\nthe respect, which the law shews to the honour of a peer, does not\r\nextend so far as to overturn a settled maxim, that _in judicio non\r\ncreditur nisi juratis_[z]. The honour of peers is however so highly\r\ntendered by the law, that it is much more penal to spread false\r\nreports of them, and certain other great officers of the realm, than\r\nof other men: scandal against them being called by the peculiar name\r\nof _scandalum magnatum_; and subjected to peculiar punishment by\r\ndivers antient statutes[a].\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: 3 Inst. 30, 31.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: 2 Inst. 50.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: Finch. L. 355. 1 Ventr. 298.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: 2 Inst 49.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: 1 P. Wms. 146.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Salk. 512.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: Cro. Car. 64.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: 3 Edw. I. c. 34. 2 Ric. II. st. 1. c. 5. 12 Ric. II. c.\r\n11.]\r\n\r\nA PEER cannot lose his nobility, but by death or attainder; hough\r\n[Transcriber's Note: though] there was an instance, in the reign of\r\nEdward the fourth, of the degradation of George Nevile duke of\r\nBedford by act of parliament[b], on account of his poverty, which\r\nrendered him unable to support his dignity[c]. But this is a singular\r\ninstance: which serves at the same time, by having happened, to shew\r\nthe power of parliament; and, by having happened but once, to shew how\r\ntender the parliament hath been, in exerting so high a power. It hath\r\nbeen said indeed[d], that if a baron waste his estate, so that he is\r\nnot able to support the degree, the _king_ may degrade him: but it is\r\nexpressly held by later authorities[e], that a peer cannot be degraded\r\nbut by act of _parliament_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: 4 Inst. 355.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: The preamble to the act is remarkable: \"forasmuch as\r\noftentimes it is seen, that when any lord is called to high estate,\r\nand hath not convenient livelyhood to support the same dignity, it\r\ninduceth great poverty and indigence, and causeth oftentimes great\r\nextortion, embracery, and maintenance to be had; to the great trouble\r\nof all such countries where such estate shall happen to be: therefore,\r\n&c.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: By lord chancellor Ellesmere. Moor. 678.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: 12 Rep. 107. 12 Mod. 56.]\r\n\r\nTHE commonalty, like the nobility, are divided into several degrees;\r\nand, as the lords, though different in rank, yet all of them are peers\r\nin respect of their nobility, so the commoners, though some are\r\ngreatly superior to others, yet all are in law peers, in respect of\r\ntheir want of nobility[f].\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: 2 Inst. 29.]\r\n\r\nTHE first name of dignity, next beneath a peer, was anciently that of\r\n_vidames_, _vice domini_, or _valvasors_[g]: who are mentioned by our\r\nantient lawyers[h] as _viri magnae dignitatis_; and sir Edward Coke[i]\r\nspeaks highly of them. Yet they are now quite out of use; and our\r\nlegal antiquarians are not so much as agreed upon their original or\r\nancient office.\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Camden. _ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Bracton. _l._ 1. _c._ 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: 2 Inst. 667.]\r\n\r\nNOW therefore the first dignity after the nobility, is a _knight_ of\r\nthe order of St. George, or _of the garter_; first instituted by\r\nEdward III, _A.D._ 1344[k]. Next follows a _knight banneret_; who\r\nindeed by statutes 5 Ric. II. st. 2. c. 4. and 14 Ric. II. c. 11. is\r\nranked next after barons: and that precedence was confirmed to him by\r\norder of king James I, in the tenth year of his reign[l]. But, in\r\norder to intitle himself to this rank, he must have been created by\r\nthe king in person, in the field, under the royal banners, in time of\r\nopen war[m]. Else he ranks after _baronets_; who are the next order:\r\nwhich title is a dignity of inheritance, created by letters patent,\r\nand usually descendible to the issue male. It was first instituted by\r\nking James the first, _A.D._ 1611. in order to raise a competent sum\r\nfor the reduction of the province of Ulster in Ireland; for which\r\nreason all baronets have the arms of Ulster superadded to their family\r\ncoat. Next follow _knights of the bath_; an order instituted by king\r\nHenry IV, and revived by king George the first. They are so called\r\nfrom the ceremony of bathing, the night before their creation. The\r\nlast of these inferior nobility are _knights bachelors_; the most\r\nantient, though the lowest, order of knighthood amongst us: for we\r\nhave an instance[n] of king Alfred's conferring this order on his son\r\nAthelstan. The custom of the antient Germans was to give their young\r\nmen a shield and a lance in the great council: this was equivalent to\r\nthe _toga virilis_ of the Romans: before this they were not permitted\r\nto bear arms, but were accounted as part of the father's houshold;\r\nafter it, as part of the public[o]. Hence some derive the usage of\r\nknighting, which has prevailed all over the western world, since it's\r\nreduction by colonies from those northern heroes. Knights are called\r\nin Latin _equites aurati_; _aurati_, from the gilt spurs they wore;\r\nand _equites_, because they always served on horseback: for it is\r\nobservable[p], that almost all nations call their knights by some\r\nappellation derived from an horse. They are also called in our law\r\n_milites_, because they formed a part, or indeed the whole of the\r\nroyal army, in virtue of their feodal tenures; one condition of which\r\nwas, that every one who held a knights fee (which in Henry the\r\nsecond's time[q] amounted to 20_l._ _per annum_) was obliged to be\r\nknighted, and attend the king in his wars, or fine for his\r\nnon-compliance. The exertion of this prerogative, as an expedient to\r\nraise money in the reign of Charles the first, gave great offence;\r\nthough warranted by law, and the recent example of queen Elizabeth:\r\nbut it was, at the restoration, together with all other military\r\nbranches of the feodal law, abolished; and this kind of knighthood\r\nhas, since that time, fallen into great disregard.\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Seld. tit. of hon. 2. 5. 41.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: Seld. tit. hon. 2. 11. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: 4 Inst. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: Will. Malmsb. _lib._ 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: Tac. _de morib. Germ._ 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: Camden. _ibid._ Co. Litt. 74.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: Glanvil. _l._ 9. _c._ 4.]\r\n\r\nTHESE, sir Edward Coke says[r], are all the names of _dignity_ in this\r\nkingdom, esquires and gentlemen being only names of _worship_. But\r\nbefore these last the heralds rank all colonels, serjeants at law, and\r\ndoctors in the three learned professions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: 2 Inst. 667.]\r\n\r\nESQUIRES and gentlemen are confounded together by sir Edward Coke, who\r\nobserves[s], that every esquire is a gentleman, and a gentleman is\r\ndefined to be one _qui arma gerit_, who bears coat armour, the grant\r\nof which adds gentility to a man's family: in like manner as civil\r\nnobility, among the Romans, was founded in the _jus imaginum_, or\r\nhaving the image of one ancestor at least, who had borne some curule\r\noffice. It is indeed a matter somewhat unsettled, what constitutes the\r\ndistinction, or who is a real _esquire_: for it is not an estate,\r\nhowever large, that confers this rank upon it's owner. Camden, who was\r\nhimself a herald, distinguishes them the most accurately; and he\r\nreckons up four sorts of them[t]: 1. The eldest sons of knights, and\r\ntheir eldest sons, in perpetual succession[u]. 2. The younger sons of\r\npeers, and their eldest sons, in like perpetual succession: both which\r\nspecies of esquires sir H. Spelman entitles _armigeri natalitii_[w].\r\n3. Esquires created by the king's letters patent, or other\r\ninvestiture; and their eldest sons. 4. Esquires by virtue of their\r\noffices; as justices of the peace, and others who bear any office of\r\ntrust under the crown. To these may be added the esquires of knights\r\nof the bath, each of whom constitutes three at his installation; and\r\nall foreign, nay, Irish peers; and the eldest sons of peers of Great\r\nBritain, who, though generally titular lords, are only esquires in the\r\nlaw, and must so be named in all legal proceedings[x]. As for\r\n_gentlemen_, says sir Thomas Smith[y], they be made good cheap in this\r\nkingdom: for whosoever studieth the laws of the realm, who studieth in\r\nthe universities, who professeth liberal sciences, and (to be short)\r\nwho can live idly, and without manual labour, and will bear the port,\r\ncharge, and countenance of a gentleman, he shall be called master, and\r\nshall be taken for a gentleman. A _yeoman_ is he that hath free land\r\nof forty shillings by the year; who is thereby qualified to serve on\r\njuries, vote for knights of the shire, and do any other act, where the\r\nlaw requires one that is _probus et legalis homo_[z].\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: 2 Inst. 668.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: 2 Inst. 667.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: Gloss. 43.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: 3 Inst. 30. 2 Inst. 667.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Commonw. of Eng. book 1. c. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: 2 Inst. 668.]\r\n\r\nTHE rest of the commonalty are _tradesmen_, _artificers_, and\r\n_labourers_; who (as well as all others) must in pursuance of the\r\nstatute 1 Hen. V. c. 5. be stiled by the name and addition of their\r\nestate, degree, or mystery, in all actions and other legal\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH.\r\n\r\nOF THE MILITARY AND MARITIME STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE military state includes the whole of the soldiery; or, such\r\npersons as are peculiarly appointed among the rest of the people, for\r\nthe safeguard and defence of the realm.\r\n\r\nIN a land of liberty it is extremely dangerous to make a distinct\r\norder of the profession of arms. In absolute monarchies this is\r\nnecessary for the safety of the prince, and arises from the main\r\nprinciple of their constitution, which is that of governing by fear:\r\nbut in free states the profession of a soldier, taken singly and\r\nmerely as a profession, is justly an object of jealousy. In these no\r\nman should take up arms, but with a view to defend his country and\r\nit's laws: he puts not off the citizen when he enters the camp; but it\r\nis because he is a citizen, and would wish to continue so, that he\r\nmakes himself for a while a soldier. The laws therefore and\r\nconstitution of these kingdoms know no such state as that of a\r\nperpetual standing soldier, bred up to no other profession than that\r\nof war: and it was not till the reign of Henry VII, that the kings of\r\nEngland had so much as a guard about their persons.\r\n\r\nIN the time of our Saxon ancestors, as appears from Edward the\r\nconfessor's laws[a], the military force of this kingdom was in the\r\nhands of the dukes or heretochs, who were constituted through every\r\nprovince and county in the kingdom; being taken out of the principal\r\nnobility, and such as were most remarkable for being \"_sapientes,\r\nfideles, et animosi_.\" Their duty was to lead and regulate the English\r\narmies, with a very unlimited power; \"_prout eis visum fuerit, ad\r\nhonorem coronae et utilitatem regni_.\" And because of this great power\r\nthey were elected by the people in their full assembly, or folkmote,\r\nin the same manner as sheriffs were elected: following still that old\r\nfundamental maxim of the Saxon constitution, that where any officer\r\nwas entrusted with such power, as if abused might tend to the\r\noppression of the people, that power was delegated to him by the vote\r\nof the people themselves[b]. So too, among the antient Germans, the\r\nancestors of our Saxon forefathers, they had their dukes, as well as\r\nkings, with an independent power over the military, as the kings had\r\nover the civil state. The dukes were elective, the kings hereditary:\r\nfor so only can be consistently understood that passage of Tacitus[c],\r\n\"_reges ex nobilitate, duces ex virtute sumunt_;\" in constituting\r\ntheir kings, the family, or blood royal, was regarded, in chusing\r\ntheir dukes or leaders, warlike merit: just as Caesar relates of their\r\nancestors in his time, that whenever they went to war, by way either\r\nof attack or defence, they _elected_ leaders to command them[d]. This\r\nlarge share of power, thus conferred by the people, though intended to\r\npreserve the liberty of the subject, was perhaps unreasonably\r\ndetrimental to the prerogative of the crown: and accordingly we find a\r\nvery ill use made of it by Edric duke of Mercia, in the reign of king\r\nEdmond Ironside; who, by his office of duke or heretoch, was entitled\r\nto a large command in the king's army, and by his repeated\r\ntreacheries at last transferred the crown to Canute the Dane.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: _c. de heretochiis._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: \"_Isti vero viri eliguntur per commune consilium, pro\r\ncommuni utilitate regni, per provincias et patrias universas, et per\r\nsingulos comitatus, in pleno folkmote, sicut et vice-comites\r\nprovinciarum et comitatuum eligi debent._\" _LL. Edw. Confess._ _ibid._\r\nSee also Bede, _eccl. hist._ _l._ 5. _c._ 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: _De morib.

Gall._ _l._\r\n6. _c._ 22.]\r\n\r\nIT seems universally agreed by all historians, that king Alfred first\r\nsettled a national militia in this kingdom, and by his prudent\r\ndiscipline made all the subjects of his dominion soldiers: but we are\r\nunfortunately left in the dark as to the particulars of this his so\r\ncelebrated regulation; though, from what was last observed, the dukes\r\nseem to have been left in possession of too large and independent a\r\npower: which enabled duke Harold on the death of Edward the confessor,\r\nthough a stranger to the royal blood, to mount for a short space the\r\nthrone of this kingdom, in prejudice of Edgar Atheling, the rightful\r\nheir.\r\n\r\nUPON the Norman conquest the feodal law was introduced here in all\r\nit's rigor, the whole of which is built on a military plan. I shall\r\nnot now enter into the particulars of that constitution, which belongs\r\nmore properly to the next part of our commentaries: but shall only\r\nobserve, that, in consequence thereof, all the lands in the kingdom\r\nwere divided into what were called knight's fees, in number above\r\nsixty thousand; and for every knight's fee a knight or soldier,\r\n_miles_, was bound to attend the king in his wars, for forty days in a\r\nyear; in which space of time, before war was reduced to a science, the\r\ncampaign was generally finished, and a kingdom either conquered or\r\nvictorious[e]. By this means the king had, without any expense, an\r\narmy of sixty thousand men always ready at his command. And\r\naccordingly we find one, among the laws of William the conqueror[f],\r\nwhich in the king's name commands and firmly enjoins the personal\r\nattendance of all knights and others; \"_quod habeant et teneant se\r\nsemper in armis et equis, ut decet et oportet; et quod semper sint\r\nprompti et parati ad servitium suum integrum nobis explendum et\r\nperagendum, cum opus adfuerit, secundum quod debent de feodis et\r\ntenementis suis de jure nobis facere_.\" This personal service in\r\nprocess of time degenerated into pecuniary commutations or aids, and\r\nat last the military part of the feodal system was abolished at the\r\nrestoration, by statute 12 Car. II. c. 24.\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: The Poles are, even at this day, so tenacious of their\r\nantient constitution, that their pospolite, or militia, cannot be\r\ncompelled to serve above six weeks, or forty days, in a year. Mod.\r\nUniv. Hist. xxxiv. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: c. 58. See Co. Litt. 75, 76.]\r\n\r\nIN the mean time we are not to imagine that the kingdom was left\r\nwholly without defence, in case of domestic insurrections, or the\r\nprospect of foreign invasions. Besides those, who by their military\r\ntenures were bound to perform forty days service in the field, the\r\nstatute of Winchester[g] obliged every man, according to his estate\r\nand degree, to provide a determinate quantity of such arms as were\r\nthen in use, in order to keep the peace: and constables were appointed\r\nin all hundreds to see that such arms were provided. These weapons\r\nwere changed, by the statute 4 & 5 Ph. & M. c. 2. into others of more\r\nmodern service; but both this and the former provision were repealed\r\nin the reign of James I[h]. While these continued in force, it was\r\nusual from time to time for our princes to to [Transcriber's Note:\r\nduplicate word] issue commissions of array, and send into every county\r\nofficers in whom they could confide, to muster and array (or set in\r\nmilitary order) the inhabitants of every district: and the form of the\r\ncommission of array was settled in parliament in the 5 Hen. IV[i]. But\r\nat the same time it was provided[k], that no man should be compelled\r\nto go out of the kingdom at any rate, nor out of his shire but in\r\ncases of urgent necessity; nor should provide soldiers unless by\r\nconsent of parliament. About the reign of king Henry the eighth, and\r\nhis children, lord lieutenants began to be introduced, as standing\r\nrepresentatives of the crown, to keep the counties in military order;\r\nfor we find them mentioned as known officers in the statute 4 & 5 Ph.\r\n& M. c. 3. though they had not been then long in use, for Camden\r\nspeaks of them[l], in the time of queen Elizabeth, as extraordinary\r\nmagistrates constituted only in times of difficulty and danger.\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: 13 Edw. I. c. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Stat. 1 Jac. I. c. 25. 21 Jac. I. c. 28.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: Rushworth. part 3. pag. 667.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Stat. 1 Edw III. st. 2. c. 5 & 7. 25 Edw. III. st. 5. c.\r\n8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: Brit. 103. Edit. 1594.]\r\n\r\nIN this state things continued, till the repeal of the statutes of\r\narmour in the reign of king James the first: after which, when king\r\nCharles the first had, during his northern expeditions, issued\r\ncommissions of lieutenancy and exerted some military powers which,\r\nhaving been long exercised, were thought to belong to the crown, it\r\nbecame a question in the long parliament, how far the power of the\r\nmilitia did inherently reside in the king; being now unsupported by\r\nany statute, and founded only upon immemorial usage. This question,\r\nlong agitated with great heat and resentment on both sides, became at\r\nlength the immediate cause of the fatal rupture between the king and\r\nhis parliament: the two houses not only denying this prerogative of\r\nthe crown, the legality of which right perhaps might be somewhat\r\ndoubtful; but also seizing into their own hands the intire power of\r\nthe militia, the illegality of which step could never be any doubt at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nSOON after the restoration of king Charles the second, when the\r\nmilitary tenures were abolished, it was thought proper to ascertain\r\nthe power of the militia, to recognize the sole right of the crown to\r\ngovern and command them, and to put the whole into a more regular\r\nmethod of military subordination[m]: and the order, in which the\r\nmilitia now stands by law, is principally built upon the statutes\r\nwhich were then enacted. It is true the two last of them are\r\napparently repealed; but many of their provisions are re-enacted, with\r\nthe addition of some new regulations, by the present militia laws: the\r\ngeneral scheme of which is to discipline a certain number of the\r\ninhabitants of every county, chosen by lot for three years, and\r\nofficered by the lord lieutenant, the deputy lieutenants, and other\r\nprincipal landholders, under a commission from the crown. They are not\r\ncompellable to march out of their counties, unless in case of invasion\r\nor actual rebellion, nor in any case compellable to march out of the\r\nkingdom. They are to be exercised at stated times: and their\r\ndiscipline in general is liberal and [Transcriber's Note: 'and'\r\nmissing here but is in printer's mark on previous page] easy; but,\r\nwhen drawn out into actual service, they are subject to the rigours of\r\nmartial law, as necessary to keep them in order. This is the\r\nconstitutional security, which our laws have provided for the public\r\npeace, and for protecting the realm against foreign or domestic\r\nviolence; and which the statutes[n] declare is essentially necessary\r\nto the safety and prosperity of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: 13 Car. II. c. 6. 14 Car. II. c. 3. 15 Car. II. c. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: 30 Geo. II. c. 25, &c.]\r\n\r\nWHEN the nation is engaged in a foreign war, more veteran troops and\r\nmore regular discipline may perhaps be necessary, than can be expected\r\nfrom a mere militia. And therefore at such times particular provisions\r\nhave been usually made for the raising of armies and the due\r\nregulation and discipline of the soldiery: which are to be looked upon\r\nonly as temporary excrescences bred out of the distemper of the state,\r\nand not as any part of the permanent and perpetual laws of the\r\nkingdom. For martial law, which is built upon no settled principles,\r\nbut is entirely arbitrary in it's decisions, is, as sir Matthew Hale\r\nobserves[o], in truth and reality no law, but something indulged,\r\nrather than allowed as a law: the necessity of order and discipline in\r\nan army is the only thing which can give it countenance; and therefore\r\nit ought not to be permitted in time of peace, when the king's courts\r\nare open for all persons to receive justice according to the laws of\r\nthe land. Wherefore Edmond earl of Kent being taken at Pontefract, 15\r\nEdw. II. and condemned by martial law, his attainder was reversed 1\r\nEdw. III. because it was done in time of peace. And it is laid\r\ndown[p], that if a lieutenant, or other, that hath commission of\r\nmartial authority, doth in time of peace hang or otherwise execute any\r\nman by colour of martial law, this is murder; for it is against _magna\r\ncarta_[q]. And the petition of right[r] enacts, that no soldier shall\r\nbe quartered on the subject without his own consent[s]; and that no\r\ncommission shall issue to proceed within this land according to\r\nmartial law. And whereas, after the restoration, king Charles the\r\nsecond kept up about five thousand regular troops, by his own\r\nauthority, for guards and garrisons; which king James the second by\r\ndegrees increased to no less than thirty thousand, all paid from his\r\nown civil list; it was made one of the articles of the bill of\r\nrights[t], that the raising or keeping a standing army within the\r\nkingdom in time of peace, unless it be with consent of parliament, is\r\nagainst law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: Hist. C.L. c. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: 3 Inst. 52.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: _cap._ 29.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: 3 Car. I. See also stat. 31 Car. II. c. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: Thus, in Poland, no soldier can be quartered upon the\r\ngentry, the only freemen in that republic. Mod. Univ. Hist. xxxiv.\r\n23.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: Stat. 1 W. & M. st. 2. c. 2.]\r\n\r\nBUT, as the fashion of keeping standing armies has universally\r\nprevailed over all Europe of late years (though some of it's\r\npotentates, being unable themselves to maintain them, are obliged to\r\nhave recourse to richer powers, and receive subsidiary pensions for\r\nthat purpose) it has also for many years past been annually judged\r\nnecessary by our legislature, for the safety of the kingdom, the\r\ndefence of the possessions of the crown of Great Britain, and the\r\npreservation of the balance of power in Europe, to maintain even in\r\ntime of peace a standing body of troops, under the command of the\r\ncrown; who are however _ipso facto_ disbanded at the expiration of\r\nevery year, unless continued by parliament.\r\n\r\nTO prevent the executive power from being able to oppress, says baron\r\nMontesquieu[u], it is requisite that the armies with which it is\r\nentrusted should consist of the people, and have the same spirit with\r\nthe people; as was the case at Rome, till Marius new-modelled the\r\nlegions by enlisting the rabble of Italy, and laid the foundation of\r\nall the military tyranny that ensued. Nothing then, according to these\r\nprinciples, ought to be more guarded against in a free state, than\r\nmaking the military power, when such a one is necessary to be kept on\r\nfoot, a body too distinct from the people. Like ours therefore, it\r\nshould wholly be composed of natural subjects; it ought only to be\r\nenlisted for a short and limited time; the soldiers also should live\r\nintermixed with the people; no separate camp, no barracks, no inland\r\nfortresses should be allowed. And perhaps it might be still better,\r\nif, by dismissing a stated number and enlisting others at every\r\nrenewal of their term, a circulation could be kept up between the\r\narmy and the people, and the citizen and the soldier be more\r\nintimately connected together.\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: Sp. L. 11. 6.]\r\n\r\nTO keep this body of troops in order, an annual act of parliament\r\nlikewise passes, \"to punish mutiny and desertion, and for the better\r\npayment of the army and their quarters.\" This regulates the manner in\r\nwhich they are to be dispersed among the several inn-keepers and\r\nvictuallers throughout the kingdom; and establishes a law martial for\r\ntheir government. By this, among other things, it is enacted, that if\r\nany officer and soldier shall excite, or join any mutiny, or, knowing\r\nof it, shall not give notice to the commanding officer; or shall\r\ndefect, or list in any other regiment, or sleep upon his post, or\r\nleave it before he is relieved, or hold correspondence with a rebel or\r\nenemy, or strike or use violence to his superior officer, or shall\r\ndisobey his lawful commands; such offender shall suffer such\r\npunishment as a court martial shall inflict, though it extend to death\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER expedient the most strict regulations may be in time of actual\r\nwar, yet, in times of profound peace, a little relaxation of military\r\nrigour would not, one should hope, be productive of much\r\ninconvenience. And, upon this principle, though by our standing\r\nlaws[w] (still remaining in force, though not attended to) desertion\r\nin time of war is made felony, without benefit of clergy, and the\r\noffence is triable by a jury and before the judges of the common law;\r\nyet, by our militia laws beforementioned, a much lighter punishment is\r\ninflicted for desertion in time of peace. So, by the Roman law also,\r\ndesertion in time of war was punished with death, but more mildly in\r\ntime of tranquillity[x]. But our mutiny act makes no such distinction:\r\nfor any of the faults therein mentioned are, equally at all times,\r\npunishable with death itself, if a court martial shall think proper.\r\nThis discretionary power of the court martial is indeed to be guided\r\nby the directions of the crown; which, with regard to military\r\noffences, has almost an absolute legislative power. \"His majesty, says\r\nthe act, may form articles of war, and constitute courts martial, with\r\npower to try any crime by such articles, and inflict such penalties as\r\nthe articles direct.\" A vast and most important trust! an unlimited\r\npower to create crimes, and annex to them any punishments, not\r\nextending to life or limb! These are indeed forbidden to be inflicted,\r\nexcept for crimes declared to be so punishable by this act; which\r\ncrimes we have just enumerated, and, among which, we may observe that\r\nany disobedience to lawful commands is one. Perhaps in some future\r\nrevision of this act, which is in many respects hastily penned, it may\r\nbe thought worthy the wisdom of parliament to ascertain the limits of\r\nmilitary subjection, and to enact express articles of war for the\r\ngovernment of the army, as is done for the government of the navy:\r\nespecially as, by our present constitution, the nobility and gentry of\r\nthe kingdom, who serve their country as militia officers, are annually\r\nsubjected to the same arbitrary rule, during their time of exercise.\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: Stat. 18 Hen. VI. c. 19. 2 & 3 Edw. VI. c. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: _Ff._ 49. 16. 5.]\r\n\r\nONE of the greatest advantages of our English law is, that not only\r\nthe crimes themselves which it punishes, but also the penalties which\r\nit inflicts, are ascertained and notorious: nothing is left to\r\narbitrary discretion: the king by his judges dispenses what the law\r\nhas previously ordained; but is not himself the legislator. How much\r\ntherefore is it to be regretted that a set of men, whose bravery has\r\nso often preserved the liberties of their country, should be reduced\r\nto a state of servitude in the midst of a nation of freemen! for sir\r\nEdward Coke will inform us[y], that it is one of the genuine marks of\r\nservitude, to have the law, which is our rule of action, either\r\nconcealed or precarious: \"_misera est servitus, ubi jus est vagum aut\r\nincognitum_.\" Nor is this state of servitude quite consistent with the\r\nmaxims of sound policy observed by other free nations. For, the\r\ngreater the general liberty is which any state enjoys, the more\r\ncautious has it usually been of introducing slavery in any particular\r\norder or profession. These men, as baron Montesquieu observes[z],\r\nseeing the liberty which others possess, and which they themselves\r\nare excluded from, are apt (like eunuchs in the eastern seraglios) to\r\nlive in a state of perpetual envy and hatred towards the rest of the\r\ncommunity; and indulge a malignant pleasure in contributing to destroy\r\nthose privileges, to which they can never be admitted. Hence have many\r\nfree states, by departing from this rule, been endangered by the\r\nrevolt of their slaves: while, in absolute and despotic governments\r\nwhere there no real liberty exists, and consequently no invidious\r\ncomparisons can be formed, such incidents are extremely rare. Two\r\nprecautions are therefore advised to be observed in all prudent and\r\nfree governments; 1. To prevent the introduction of slavery at all:\r\nor, 2. If it be already introduced, not to intrust those slaves with\r\narms; who will then find themselves an overmatch for the freemen. Much\r\nless ought the soldiery to be an exception to the people in general,\r\nand the only state of servitude in the nation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: 4 Inst. 332.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: Sp. L. 15. 12.]\r\n\r\nBUT as soldiers, by this annual act, are thus put in a worse condition\r\nthan any other subjects, so, by the humanity of our standing laws,\r\nthey are in some cases put in a much better. By statute 43 Eliz. c. 3.\r\na weekly allowance is to be raised in every county for the relief of\r\nsoldiers that are sick, hurt, and maimed: not forgetting the royal\r\nhospital at Chelsea for such as are worn out in their duty. Officers\r\nand soldiers, that have been in the king's service, are by several\r\nstatutes, enacted at the close of several wars, at liberty to use any\r\ntrade or occupation they are fit for, in any town in the kingdom\r\n(except the two universities) notwithstanding any statute, custom, or\r\ncharter to the contrary. And soldiers in actual military service may\r\nmake their wills, and dispose of their goods, wages, and other\r\npersonal chattels, without those forms, solemnities, and expenses,\r\nwhich the law requires in other cases[a]. Our law does not indeed\r\nextend this privilege so far as the civil law; which carried it to an\r\nextreme that borders upon the ridiculous. For if a soldier, in the\r\narticle of death, wrote any thing in bloody letters on his shield, or\r\nin the dust of the field with his sword, it was a very good military\r\ntestament[b]. And thus much for the military state, as acknowleged by\r\nthe laws of England.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: Stat. 29 Car. II. c. 3. 5 W. III. c. 21. §. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: _Si milites quid in clypeo literis sanguine suo\r\nrutilantibus adnotaverint, aut in pulvere inscripserint gladio suo,\r\nipso tempore quo, in praelio, vitae sortem derelinquunt, hujusmodi\r\nvoluntatem stabilem esse oportet._ _Cod._ 6. 21. 15.]\r\n\r\nTHE _maritime_ state is nearly related to the former; though much more\r\nagreeable to the principles of our free constitution. The royal navy\r\nof England hath ever been it's greatest defence and ornament: it is\r\nit's antient and natural strength; the floating bulwark of the island;\r\nan army, from which, however strong and powerful, no danger can ever\r\nbe apprehended to liberty: and accordingly it has been assiduously\r\ncultivated, even from the earliest ages. To so much perfection was our\r\nnaval reputation arrived in the twelfth century, that the code of\r\nmaritime laws, which are called the laws of Oleron, and are received\r\nby all nations in Europe as the ground and substruction of all their\r\nmarine constitutions, was confessedly compiled by our king Richard the\r\nfirst, at the isle of Oleron on the coast of France, then part of the\r\npossessions of the crown of England[c]. And yet, so vastly inferior\r\nwere our ancestors in this point to the present age, that even in the\r\nmaritime reign of queen Elizabeth, sir Edward Coke[d] thinks it matter\r\nof boast, that the royal navy of England then consisted of _three and\r\nthirty_ ships. The present condition of our marine is in great measure\r\nowing to the salutary provisions of the statutes, called the\r\nnavigation-acts; whereby the constant increase of English shipping and\r\nseamen was not only encouraged, but rendered unavoidably necessary. By\r\nthe statute 5 Ric. II. c. 3. in order to augment the navy of England,\r\nthen greatly diminished, it was ordained, that none of the king's\r\nliege people should ship any merchandize out of or into the realm but\r\nonly in ships of the king's ligeance, on pain of forfeiture. In the\r\nnext year, by statute 6 Ric. II. c. 8. this wise provision was\r\nenervated, by only obliging the merchants to give English ships, (if\r\nable and sufficient) the preference. But the most beneficial statute\r\nfor the trade and commerce of these kingdoms is that navigation-act,\r\nthe rudiments of which were first framed in 1650[e], with a narrow\r\npartial view: being intended to mortify the sugar islands, which were\r\ndisaffected to the parliament and still held out for Charles II, by\r\nstopping the gainful trade which they then carried on with the\r\nDutch[f]; and at the same time to clip the wings of those our opulent\r\nand aspiring neighbours. This prohibited all ships of foreign nations\r\nfrom trading with any English plantations without licence from the\r\ncouncil of state. In 1651[g] the prohibition was extended also to the\r\nmother country; and no goods were suffered to be imported into\r\nEngland, or any of it's dependencies, in any other than English\r\nbottoms; or in the ships of that European nation of which the\r\nmerchandize imported was the genuine growth or manufacture. At the\r\nrestoration, the former provisions were continued, by statute 12 Car.\r\nII. c. 18. with this very material improvement, that the master and\r\nthree fourths of the mariners shall also be English subjects.\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: 4 Inst. 144. _Coutumes de la mer._ 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: 4 Inst. 50.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Scobell 132.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Mod. Un. Hist. xli. 289.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Scobell. 176.]\r\n\r\nMANY laws have been made for the supply of the royal navy with seamen;\r\nfor their regulation when on board; and to confer privileges and\r\nrewards on them during and after their service.\r\n\r\n1. FIRST, for their supply. The power of impressing men for the sea\r\nservice by the king's commission, has been a matter of some dispute,\r\nand submitted to with great reluctance; though it hath very clearly\r\nand learnedly been shewn, by sir Michael Foster[h], that the practise\r\nof impressing, and granting powers to the admiralty for that purpose,\r\nis of very antient date, and hath been uniformly continued by a\r\nregular series of precedents to the present time: whence he concludes\r\nit to be part of the common law[i]. The difficulty arises from hence,\r\nthat no statute has expressly declared this power to be in the crown,\r\nthough many of them very strongly imply it. The statute 2 Ric. II. c.\r\n4. speaks of mariners being arrested and retained for the king's\r\nservice, as of a thing well known, and practised without dispute; and\r\nprovides a remedy against their running away. By a later statute[k],\r\nif any waterman, who uses the river Thames, shall hide himself during\r\nthe execution of any commission of pressing for the king's service, he\r\nis liable to heavy penalties. By another[l], no fisherman shall be\r\ntaken by the queen's commission to serve as a mariner; but the\r\ncommission shall be first brought to two justices of the peace,\r\ninhabiting near the sea coast where the mariners are to be taken, to\r\nthe intent that the justices may chuse out and return such a number of\r\nablebodied men, as in the commission are contained, to serve her\r\nmajesty. And, by others[m], especial protections are allowed to seamen\r\nin particular circumstances, to prevent them from being impressed. All\r\nwhich do most evidently imply a power of impressing to reside\r\nsomewhere; and, if any where, it must from the spirit of our\r\nconstitution, as well as from the frequent mention of the king's\r\ncommission, reside in the crown alone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Rep. 154.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: See also Comb. 245.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Stat. 2 & 3 Ph. & M. c. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: Stat. 5 Eliz. c. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: Stat. 7 & 8 W. III. c. 21. 2 Ann. c. 6. 4 & 5 Ann. c. 19.\r\n13 Geo. II. c. 17. &c.]\r\n\r\nBUT, besides this method of impressing, (which is only defensible from\r\npublic necessity, to which all private considerations must give way)\r\nthere are other ways that tend to the increase of seamen, and manning\r\nthe royal navy. Parishes may bind out poor boys apprentices to masters\r\nof merchantmen, who shall be protected from impressing for the first\r\nthree years; and if they are impressed afterwards, the masters shall\r\nbe allowed their wages[n]: great advantages in point of wages are\r\ngiven to volunteer seamen in order to induce them to enter into his\r\nmajesty's service[o]: and every foreign seaman, who during a war shall\r\nserve two years in any man of war, merchantman, or privateer, is\r\nnaturalized _ipso facto_[p]. About the middle of king William's reign,\r\na scheme was set on foot[q] for a register of seamen to the number of\r\nthirty thousand, for a constant and regular supply of the king's\r\nfleet; with great privileges to the registered men, and, on the other\r\nhand, heavy penalties in case of their non-appearance when called for:\r\nbut this registry, being judged to be rather a badge of slavery, was\r\nabolished by statute 9 Ann. c. 21.\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: Stat. 2 Ann. c. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: Stat. 1 Geo. II. st. 2. c. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: Stat. 13 Geo. II. c. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: Stat. 7 & 8 W. III. c. 21.]\r\n\r\n2. THE method of ordering seamen in the royal fleet, and keeping up a\r\nregular discipline there, is directed by certain express rules,\r\narticles and orders, first enacted by the authority of parliament soon\r\nafter the restoration[r]; but since new-modelled and altered, after\r\nthe peace of Aix la Chapelle[s], to remedy some defects which were of\r\nfatal consequence in conducting the preceding war. In these articles\r\nof the navy almost every possible offence is set down, and the\r\npunishment thereof annexed: in which respect the seamen have much the\r\nadvantage over their brethren in the land service; whose articles of\r\nwar are not enacted by parliament, but framed from time to time at the\r\npleasure of the crown. Yet from whence this distinction arose, and why\r\nthe executive power, which is limited so properly with regard to the\r\nnavy, should be so extensive with regard to the army, it is hard to\r\nassign a reason: unless it proceeded from the perpetual establishment\r\nof the navy, which rendered a permanent law for their regulation\r\nexpedient; and the temporary duration of the army, which subsisted\r\nonly from year to year; and might therefore with less danger be\r\nsubjected to discretionary government. But, whatever was apprehended\r\nat the first formation of the mutiny act, the regular renewal of our\r\nstanding force at the entrance of every year has made this distinction\r\nidle. For, if from experience past we may judge of future events, the\r\narmy is now lastingly ingrafted into the British constitution; with\r\nthis singularly fortunate circumstance, that any branch of the\r\nlegislature may annually put an end to it's legal existence, by\r\nrefusing to concur in it's continuance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Stat. 13 Car. II. st. 1. c. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: Stat. 22 Geo. II. c. 23.]\r\n\r\n3. WITH regard to the privileges conferred on sailors, they are pretty\r\nmuch the same with those conferred on soldiers; with regard to relief,\r\nwhen maimed, or wounded, or superannuate, either by county rates, or\r\nthe royal hospital at Greenwich; with regard also to the exercise of\r\ntrades, and the power of making informal testaments: and, farther[t],\r\nno seaman aboard his majesty's ships can be arrested for any debt,\r\nunless the same be sworn to amount to at least twenty pounds; though,\r\nby the annual mutiny acts, a soldier may be arrested for a debt which\r\nextends to half that value, but not to a less amount.\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: Stat. 1 Geo. II. st. 2. c. 14.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH.\r\n\r\nOF MASTER AND SERVANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAVING thus commented on the rights and duties of persons, as standing\r\nin the _public_ relations of magistrates and people; the method I have\r\nmarked out now leads me to consider their rights and duties in\r\n_private_ oeconomical relations.\r\n\r\nTHE three great relations in private life are, 1. That of _master and\r\nservant_; which is founded in convenience, whereby a man is directed\r\nto call in the assistance of others, where his own skill and labour\r\nwill not be sufficient to answer the cares incumbent upon him. 2. That\r\nof _husband and wife_; which is founded in nature, but modified by\r\ncivil society: the one directing man to continue and multiply his\r\nspecies, the other prescribing the manner in which that natural\r\nimpulse must be confined and regulated. 3. That of _parent and child_,\r\nwhich is consequential to that of marriage, being it's principal end\r\nand design: and it is by virtue of this relation that infants are\r\nprotected, maintained, and educated. But, since the parents, on whom\r\nthis care is primarily incumbent, may be snatched away by death or\r\notherwise, before they have completed their duty, the law has\r\ntherefore provided a fourth relation; 4. That of _guardian and ward_,\r\nwhich is a kind of artificial parentage, in order to supply the\r\ndeficiency, whenever it happens, of the natural. Of all these\r\nrelations in their order.\r\n\r\nIN discussing the relation of _master and servant_, I shall, first,\r\nconsider the several sorts of servants, and how this relation is\r\ncreated and destroyed: secondly, the effects of this relation with\r\nregard to the parties themselves: and, lastly, it's effect with regard\r\nto other persons.\r\n\r\nI. AS to the several sorts of servants: I have formerly observed[a]\r\nthat pure and proper slavery does not, nay cannot, subsist in England;\r\nsuch I mean, whereby an absolute and unlimited power is given to the\r\nmaster over the life and fortune of the slave. And indeed it is\r\nrepugnant to reason, and the principles of natural law, that such a\r\nstate should subsist any where. The three origins of the right of\r\nslavery assigned by Justinian[b], are all of them built upon false\r\nfoundations. As, first, slavery is held to arise \"_jure gentium_,\"\r\nfrom a state of captivity in war; whence slaves are called _mancipia,\r\nquasi manu capti_. The conqueror, say the civilians, had a right to\r\nthe life of his captive; and, having spared that, has a right to deal\r\nwith him as he pleases. But it is an untrue position, when taken\r\ngenerally, that, by the law of nature or nations, a man may kill his\r\nenemy: he has only a right to kill him, in particular cases; in cases\r\nof absolute necessity, for self-defence; and it is plain this absolute\r\nnecessity did not subsist, since the victor did not actually kill him,\r\nbut made him prisoner. War is itself justifiable only on principles of\r\nself-preservation; and therefore it gives no other right over\r\nprisoners, but merely to disable them from doing harm to us, by\r\nconfining their persons: much less can it give a right to kill,\r\ntorture, abuse, plunder, or even to enslave, an enemy, when the war is\r\nover. Since therefore the right of _making_ slaves by captivity,\r\ndepends on a supposed right of slaughter, that foundation failing, the\r\nconsequence drawn from it must fail likewise. But, secondly, it is\r\nsaid that slavery may begin \"_jure civili_;\" when one man sells\r\nhimself to another. This, if only meant of contracts to serve or work\r\nfor another, is very just: but when applied to strict slavery, in the\r\nsense of the laws of old Rome or modern Barbary, is also impossible.\r\nEvery sale implies a price, a _quid pro quo_, an equivalent given to\r\nthe seller in lieu of what he transfers to the buyer: but what\r\nequivalent can be given for life, and liberty, both of which (in\r\nabsolute slavery) are held to be in the master's disposal? His\r\nproperty also, the very price he seems to receive, devolves _ipso\r\nfacto_ to his master, the instant he becomes his slave. In this case\r\ntherefore the buyer gives nothing, and the seller receives nothing: of\r\nwhat validity then can a sale be, which destroys the very principles\r\nupon which all sales are founded? Lastly, we are told, that besides\r\nthese two ways by which slaves \"_fiunt_,\" or are acquired, they may\r\nalso be hereditary: \"_servi nascuntur_;\" the children of acquired\r\nslaves are, _jure naturae_, by a negative kind of birthright, slaves\r\nalso. But this being built on the two former rights must fall together\r\nwith them. If neither captivity, nor the sale of oneself, can by the\r\nlaw of nature and reason, reduce the parent to slavery, much less can\r\nit reduce the offspring.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: pag. 123.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: _Servi aut fiunt, aut nascuntur: fiunt jure gentium, aut\r\njure civili: nascuntur ex ancillis nostris._ _Inst._ 1. 3. 4.]\r\n\r\nUPON these principles the law of England abhors, and will not endure\r\nthe existence of, slavery within this nation: so that when an attempt\r\nwas made to introduce it, by statute 1 Edw. VI. c. 3. which ordained,\r\nthat all idle vagabonds should be made slaves, and fed upon bread,\r\nwater, or small drink, and refuse meat; should wear a ring of iron\r\nround their necks, arms, or legs; and should be compelled by beating,\r\nchaining, or otherwise, to perform the work assigned them, were it\r\nnever so vile; the spirit of the nation could not brook this\r\ncondition, even in the most abandoned rogues; and therefore this\r\nstatute was repealed in two years afterwards[c]. And now it is laid\r\ndown[d], that a slave or negro, the instant he lands in England,\r\nbecomes a freeman; that is, the law will protect him in the enjoyment\r\nof his person, his liberty, and his property. Yet, with regard to any\r\nright which the master may have acquired, by contract or the like, to\r\nthe perpetual service of John or Thomas, this will remain exactly in\r\nthe same state as before: for this is no more than the same state of\r\nsubjection for life, which every apprentice submits to for the space\r\nof seven years, or sometimes for a longer term. Hence too it follows,\r\nthat the infamous and unchristian practice of withholding baptism from\r\nnegro servants, lest they should thereby gain their liberty, is\r\ntotally without foundation, as well as without excuse. The law of\r\nEngland acts upon general and extensive principles: it gives liberty,\r\nrightly understood, that is, protection, to a jew, a turk, or a\r\nheathen, as well as to those who profess the true religion of Christ;\r\nand it will not dissolve a civil contract, either express or implied,\r\nbetween master and servant, on account of the alteration of faith in\r\neither of the contracting parties: but the slave is entitled to the\r\nsame liberty in England before, as after, baptism; and, whatever\r\nservice the heathen negro owed to his English master, the same is he\r\nbound to render when a christian.\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Stat. 3 & 4 Edw. VI. c. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: Salk. 666.]\r\n\r\n1. THE first sort of servants therefore, acknowleged by the laws of\r\nEngland, are _menial servants_; so called from being _intra moenia_,\r\nor domestics. The contract between them and their masters arises upon\r\nthe hiring. If the hiring be general without any particular time\r\nlimited, the law construes it to be a hiring for a year[e]; upon a\r\nprinciple of natural equity, that the servant shall serve, and the\r\nmaster maintain him, throughout all the revolutions of the respective\r\nseasons; as well when there is work to be done, as when there is\r\nnot[f]: but the contract may be made for any larger or smaller term.\r\nAll single men between twelve years old and sixty, and married ones\r\nunder thirty years of age, and all single women between twelve and\r\nforty, not having any visible livelihood, are compellable by two\r\njustices to go out to service, for the promotion of honest industry:\r\nand no master can put away his servant, or servant leave his master,\r\neither before or at the end of his term, without a quarter's warning;\r\nunless upon reasonable cause to be allowed by a justice of the\r\npeace[g]: but they may part by consent, or make a special bargain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Co. Litt. 42.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: F.N.B. 168.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Stat. 5 Eliz. c. 4.]\r\n\r\n2. ANOTHER species of servants are called _apprentices_ (from\r\n_apprendre_, to learn) and are usually bound for a term of years, by\r\ndeed indented or indentures, to serve their masters, and be maintained\r\nand instructed by them: for which purpose our statute law[h] has made\r\nminors capable of binding themselves. This is usually done to persons\r\nof trade, in order to learn their art and mystery; and sometimes very\r\nlarge sums are given with them, as a premium for such their\r\ninstruction: but it may be done to husbandmen, nay to gentlemen, and\r\nothers. And[i] children of poor persons may be apprenticed out by the\r\noverseers, with consent of two justices, till twenty four years of\r\nage, to such persons as are thought fitting; who are also compellable\r\nto take them: and it is held, that gentlemen of fortune, and\r\nclergymen, are equally liable with others to such compulsion[k].\r\nApprentices to trades may be discharged on reasonable cause, either at\r\nrequest of themselves or masters, at the quarter sessions, or by one\r\njustice, with appeal to the sessions[l]: who may, by the equity of the\r\nstatute, if they think it reasonable, direct restitution of a ratable\r\nshare of the money given with the apprentice[m]. And parish\r\napprentices may be discharged in the same manner, by two justices[n].\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Stat. 5 Eliz. c. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: Stat. 5 Eliz. c. 4. 43 Eliz. c. 2. 1 Jac. I. c. 25. 7\r\nJac. I. c. 3. 8 & 9 W. & M. c. 30. 2 & 3 Ann. c. 6. 4 Ann. c. 19. 17\r\nGeo. II. c. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Salk. 57. 491.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: Stat. 5 Eliz. c. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: Salk. 67.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: Stat. 20 Geo. II. c. 19.]\r\n\r\n3. A THIRD species of servants are _labourers_, who are only hired by\r\nthe day or the week, and do not live _intra moenia_, as part of the\r\nfamily; concerning whom the statute so often cited[o] has made many\r\nvery good regulations; 1. Directing that all persons who have no\r\nvisible effects may be compelled to work: 2. Defining how long they\r\nmust continue at work in summer and winter: 3. Punishing such as leave\r\nor desert their work: 4. Empowering the justices at sessions, or the\r\nsheriff of the county, to settle their wages: and 5. Inflicting\r\npenalties on such as either give, or exact, more wages than are so\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: Stat. 5 Eliz. c. 4.]\r\n\r\n4. THERE is yet a fourth species of servants, if they may be so\r\ncalled, being rather in a superior, a ministerial, capacity; such as\r\n_stewards_, _factors_, and _bailiffs_: whom however the law considers\r\nas servants _pro tempore_, with regard to such of their acts, as\r\naffect their master's or employer's property. Which leads me to\r\nconsider,\r\n\r\nII. THE manner in which this relation, of service, affects either the\r\nmaster or servant. And, first, by hiring and service for a year, or\r\napprenticeship under indentures, a person gains a settlement in that\r\nparish wherein he last served forty days[p]. In the next place persons\r\nserving as apprentices to any trade have an exclusive right to\r\nexercise that trade in any part of England[q]. This law, with regard\r\nto the exclusive part of it, has by turns been looked upon as a hard\r\nlaw, or as a beneficial one, according to the prevailing humour of the\r\ntimes: which has occasioned a great variety of resolutions in the\r\ncourts of law concerning it; and attempts have been frequently made\r\nfor it's repeal, though hitherto without success. At common law every\r\nman might use what trade he pleased; but this statute restrains that\r\nliberty to such as have served as apprentices: the adversaries to\r\nwhich provision say, that all restrictions (which tend to introduce\r\nmonopolies) are pernicious to trade; the advocates for it alledge,\r\nthat unskilfulness in trades is equally detrimental to the public, as\r\nmonopolies. This reason indeed only extends to such trades, in the\r\nexercise whereof skill is required: but another of their arguments\r\ngoes much farther; viz. that apprenticeships are useful to the\r\ncommonwealth, by employing of youth, and learning them to be early\r\nindustrious; but that no one would be induced to undergo a seven years\r\nservitude, if others, though equally skilful, were allowed the same\r\nadvantages without having undergone the same discipline: and in this\r\nthere seems to be much reason. However, the resolutions of the courts\r\nhave in general rather confined than extended the restriction. No\r\ntrades are held to be within the statute, but such as were in being\r\nat the making of it[r]: for trading in a country village,\r\napprenticeships are not requisite[s]: and following the trade seven\r\nyears is sufficient without any binding; for the statute only says,\r\nthe person must serve _as_ an apprentice, and does not require an\r\nactual apprenticeship to have existed[t].\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: See page 352.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: Stat. 5 Eliz. c. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Lord Raym. 514.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: 1 Ventr. 51. 2 Keb. 583.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: Lord Raym. 1179.]\r\n\r\nA MASTER may by law correct his apprentice or servant for negligence\r\nor other misbehaviour, so it be done with moderation[u]: though, if\r\nthe master's wife beats him, it is good cause of departure[w]. But if\r\nany servant, workman, or labourer assaults his master or dame, he\r\nshall suffer one year's imprisonment, and other open corporal\r\npunishment, not extending to life or limb[x].\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: 1 Hawk. P.C. 130. Lamb. Eiren. 127.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: F.N.B. 168.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: Stat. 5 Eliz. c. 4.]\r\n\r\nBY service all servants and labourers, except apprentices, become\r\nentitled to wages: according to their agreement, if menial servants;\r\nor according to the appointment of the sheriff or sessions, if\r\nlabourers or servants in husbandry: for the statutes for regulation of\r\nwages extend to such servants only[y]; it being impossible for any\r\nmagistrate to be a judge of the employment of menial servants, or of\r\ncourse to assess their wages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: 2 Jones. 47.]\r\n\r\nIII. LET us, lastly, see how strangers may be affected by this\r\nrelation of master and servant: or how a master may behave towards\r\nothers on behalf of his servant; and what a servant may do on behalf\r\nof his master.\r\n\r\nAND, first, the master may _maintain_, that is, abet and assist his\r\nservant in any action at law against a stranger: whereas, in general,\r\nit is an offence against public justice to encourage suits and\r\nanimosities, by helping to bear the expense of them, and is called in\r\nlaw maintenance[z]. A master also may bring an action against any man\r\nfor beating or maiming his servant; but in such case he must assign,\r\nas a special reason for so doing, his own damage by the loss of his\r\nservice; and this loss must be proved upon the trial[a]. A master\r\nlikewise may justify an assault in defence of his servant, and a\r\nservant in defence of his master[b]: the master, because he has an\r\ninterest in his servant, not to be deprived of his service; the\r\nservant, because it is part of his duty, for which he receives his\r\nwages, to stand by and defend his master[c]. Also if any person do\r\nhire or retain my servant, being in my service, for which the servant\r\ndeparteth from me and goeth to serve the other, I may have an action\r\nfor damages against both the new master and the servant, or either of\r\nthem: but if the new master did not know that he is my servant, no\r\naction lies; unless he afterwards refuse to restore him upon\r\ninformation and demand[d]. The reason and foundation upon which all\r\nthis doctrine is built, seem to be the property that every man has in\r\nthe service of his domestics; acquired by the contract of hiring, and\r\npurchased by giving them wages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: 2 Roll. Abr. 115.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: 9 Rep. 113.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: 2 Roll. Abr. 546.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: In like manner, by the laws of king Alfred, c. 38. a\r\nservant was allowed to fight for his master, a parent for his child,\r\nand a husband or father for the chastity of his wife or daughter.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: F.N.B. 167, 168.]\r\n\r\nAS for those things which a servant may do on behalf of his master,\r\nthey seem all to proceed upon this principle, that the master is\r\nanswerable for the act of his servant, if done by his command, either\r\nexpressly given, or implied: _nam qui facit per alium, facit per\r\nse_[e]. Therefore, if the servant commit a trespass by the command or\r\nencouragement of his master, the master shall be guilty of it: not\r\nthat the servant is excused, for he is only to obey his master in\r\nmatters that are honest and lawful. If an innkeeper's servants rob his\r\nguests, the master is bound to restitution[f]: for as there is a\r\nconfidence reposed in him, that he will take care to provide honest\r\nservants, his negligence is a kind of implied consent to the robbery;\r\n_nam, qui non prohibet, cum prohibere possit, jubet_. So likewise if\r\nthe drawer at a tavern sells a man bad wine, whereby his health is\r\ninjured, he may bring an action against the master[g]: for, although\r\nthe master did not expressly order the servant to sell it to that\r\nperson in particular, yet his permitting him to draw and sell it at\r\nall is impliedly a general command.\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: 4 Inst. 109.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Noy's Max. c. 43.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: 1 Roll. Abr. 95.]\r\n\r\nIN the same manner, whatever a servant is permitted to do in the usual\r\ncourse of his business, is equivalent to a general command. If I pay\r\nmoney to a banker's servant, the banker is answerable for it: if I pay\r\nit to a clergyman's or a physician's servant, whose usual business it\r\nis not to receive money for his master, and he imbezzles it, I must\r\npay it over again. If a steward lets a lease of a farm, without the\r\nowner's knowlege, the owner must stand to the bargain; for this is the\r\nsteward's business. A wife, a friend, a relation, that use to transact\r\nbusiness for a man, are _quoad hoc_ his servants; and the principal\r\nmust answer for their conduct: for the law implies, that they act\r\nunder a general command; and, without such a doctrine as this, no\r\nmutual intercourse between man and man could subsist with any\r\ntolerable convenience. If I usually deal with a tradesman by myself,\r\nor constantly pay him ready money, I am not answerable for what my\r\nservant takes up upon trust; for here is no implied order to the\r\ntradesman to trust my servant: but if I usually send him upon trust,\r\nor sometimes on trust, and sometimes with ready money, I am answerable\r\nfor all he takes up; for the tradesman cannot possibly distinguish\r\nwhen he comes by my order, and when upon his own authority[h].\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Dr & Stud. d. 2. c. 42. Noy's max. c. 44.]\r\n\r\nIF a servant, lastly, by his negligence does any damage to a stranger,\r\nthe master shall answer for his neglect: if a smith's servant lames a\r\nhorse while he is shoing him, an action lies against the master, and\r\nnot against the servant. But in these cases the damage must be done,\r\nwhile he is actually employed in the master's service; otherwise the\r\nservant shall answer for his own misbehaviour. Upon this principle,\r\nby the common law[i], if a servant kept his master's fire negligently,\r\nso that his neighbour's house was burned down thereby, an action lay\r\nagainst the master; because this negligence happened in his service:\r\notherwise, if the servant, going along the street with a torch, by\r\nnegligence sets fire to a house; for there he is not in his master's\r\nimmediate service, and must himself answer the damage personally. But\r\nnow the common law is, in the former case, altered by statute 6 Ann.\r\nc. 3. which ordains that no action shall be maintained against any, in\r\nwhose house or chamber any fire shall accidentally begin; for their\r\nown loss is sufficient punishment for their own or their servants'\r\ncarelessness. But if such fire happens through negligence of any\r\nservant (whose loss is commonly very little) such servant shall\r\nforfeit 100_l_, to be distributed among the sufferers; and, in default\r\nof payment, shall be committed to some workhouse and there kept to\r\nhard labour for eighteen months[k]. A master is, lastly, chargeable if\r\nany of his family layeth or casteth any thing out of his house into\r\nthe street or common highway, to the damage of any individual, or the\r\ncommon nusance of his majesty's liege people[l]: for the master hath\r\nthe superintendance and charge of all his houshold. And this also\r\nagrees with the civil law[m]; which holds, that the _pater familias_,\r\nin this and similar cases, \"_ob alterius culpam tenetur, sive servi,\r\nsive liberi_.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: Noy's max. c. 44.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Upon a similar principle, by the law of the twelve tables\r\nat Rome, a person by whose negligence any fire began was bound to pay\r\ndouble to the sufferers; or if he was not able to pay, was to suffer a\r\ncorporal punishment.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: Noy's max. c. 44.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: _Ff._ 9. 3. 1. _Inst._ 4. 5. 1.]\r\n\r\nWE may observe, that in all the cases here put, the master may be\r\nfrequently a loser by the trust reposed in his servant, but never can\r\nbe a gainer: he may frequently be answerable for his servant's\r\nmisbehaviour, but never can shelter himself from punishment by laying\r\nthe blame on his agent. The reason of this is still uniform and the\r\nsame; that the wrong done by the servant is looked upon in law as the\r\nwrong of the master himself; and it is a standing maxim, that no man\r\nshall be allowed to make any advantage of his own wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE FIFTEENTH.\r\n\r\nOF HUSBAND AND WIFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE second private relation of persons is that of marriage, which\r\nincludes the reciprocal duties of husband and wife; or, as most of our\r\nelder law books call them, of _baron_ and _feme_. In the consideration\r\nof which I shall in the first place enquire, how marriages may be\r\ncontracted or made; shall next point out the manner in which they may\r\nbe dissolved; and shall, lastly, take a view of the legal effects and\r\nconsequence of marriage.\r\n\r\nI. OUR law considers marriage in no other light than as a civil\r\ncontract. The _holiness_ of the matrimonial state is left entirely to\r\nthe ecclesiastical law: the temporal courts not having jurisdiction to\r\nconsider unlawful marriages as a sin, but merely as a civil\r\ninconvenience. The punishment therefore, or annulling, of incestuous\r\nor other unscriptural marriages, is the province of the spiritual\r\ncourts; which act _pro salute animae_[a]. And, taking it in this civil\r\nlight, the law treats it as it does all other contracts; allowing it\r\nto be good and valid in all cases, where the parties at the time of\r\nmaking it were, in the first place, _willing_ to contract; secondly,\r\n_able_ to contract; and, lastly, actually _did_ contract, in the\r\nproper forms and solemnities required by law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: Salk. 121.]\r\n\r\nFIRST, they must be _willing_ to contract. \"_Consensus, non\r\nconcubitus, facit nuptias_,\" is the maxim of the civil law in this\r\ncase[b]: and it is adopted by the common lawyers[c], who indeed have\r\nborrowed (especially in antient times) almost all their notions of the\r\nlegitimacy of marriage from the canon and civil laws.\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: _Ff._ 50. 17. 30.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Co. Litt. 33.]\r\n\r\nSECONDLY, they must be _able_ to contract. In general, all persons are\r\nable to contract themselves in marriage, unless they labour under some\r\nparticular disabilities, and incapacities. What those are, it will\r\nhere be our business to enquire.\r\n\r\nNOW these disabilities are of two sorts: first, such as are canonical,\r\nand therefore sufficient by the ecclesiastical laws to avoid the\r\nmarriage in the spiritual court; but these in our law only make the\r\nmarriage voidable, and not _ipso facto_ void, until sentence of\r\nnullity be obtained. Of this nature are pre-contract; consanguinity,\r\nor relation by blood; and affinity, or relation by marriage; and some\r\nparticular corporal infirmities. And these canonical disabilities are\r\neither grounded upon the express words of the divine law, or are\r\nconsequences plainly deducible from thence: it therefore being sinful\r\nin the persons, who labour under them, to attempt to contract\r\nmatrimony together, they are properly the object of the ecclesiastical\r\nmagistrate's coercion; in order to separate the offenders, and inflict\r\npenance for the offence, _pro salute animarum_. But such marriages not\r\nbeing void _ab initio_, but voidable only by sentence of separation,\r\nthey are esteemed valid to all civil purposes, unless such separation\r\nis actually made during the life of the parties. For, after the death\r\nof either of them, the courts of common law will not suffer the\r\nspiritual court to declare such marriages to have been void; because\r\nsuch declaration cannot now tend to the reformation of the parties[d].\r\nAnd therefore when a man had married his first wife's sister, and\r\nafter her death the bishop's court was proceeding to annul the\r\nmarriage and bastardize the issue, the court of king's bench granted\r\na prohibition _quoad hoc_; but permitted them to proceed to punish the\r\nhusband for incest[e]. These canonical disabilities, being entirely\r\nthe province of the ecclesiastical courts, our books are perfectly\r\nsilent concerning them. But there are a few statutes, which serve as\r\ndirectories to those courts, of which it will be proper to take\r\nnotice. By statute 32 Hen. VIII. c. 38. it is declared, that all\r\npersons may lawfully marry, but such as are prohibited by God's law;\r\nand that all marriages contracted by lawful persons in the face of the\r\nchurch, and consummate with bodily knowlege, and fruit of children,\r\nshall be indissoluble. And (because in the times of popery a great\r\nvariety of degrees of kindred were made impediments to marriage, which\r\nimpediments might however be bought off for money) it is declared by\r\nthe same statute, that nothing (God's law except) shall impeach any\r\nmarriage, but within the Levitical degrees; the farthest of which is\r\nthat between uncle and niece[f]. By the same statute all impediments,\r\narising from pre-contracts to other persons, were abolished and\r\ndeclared of none effect, unless they had been consummated with bodily\r\nknowlege: in which case the canon law holds such contract to be a\r\nmarriage _de facto_. But this branch of the statute was repealed by\r\nstatute 2 & 3 Edw. VI. c. 23. How far the act of 26 Geo. II. c. 33.\r\n(which prohibits all suits in ecclesiastical courts to compel a\r\nmarriage, in consequence of any contract) may collaterally extend to\r\nrevive this clause of Henry VIII's statute, and abolish the impediment\r\nof pre-contract, I leave to be considered by the canonists.\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Salk. 548.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Gilb. Rep. 158.]\r\n\r\nTHE other sort of disabilities are those which are created, or at\r\nleast enforced, by the municipal laws. And, though some of them may be\r\ngrounded on natural law, yet they are regarded by the laws of the\r\nland, not so much in the light of any moral offence, as on account of\r\nthe civil inconveniences they draw after them. These civil\r\ndisabilities make the contract void _ab initio_, and not merely\r\nvoidable: not that they dissolve a contract already formed, but they\r\nrender the parties incapable of forming any contract at all: they do\r\nnot put asunder those who are joined together, but they previously\r\nhinder the junction. And, if any persons under these legal\r\nincapacities come together, it is a meretricious, and not a\r\nmatrimonial, union.\r\n\r\n1. THE first of these legal disabilities is a prior marriage, or\r\nhaving another husband or wife living; in which case, besides the\r\npenalties consequent upon it as a felony, the second marriage is to\r\nall intents and purposes void[g]: polygamy being condemned both by the\r\nlaw of the new testament, and the policy of all prudent states,\r\nespecially in these northern climates. And Justinian, even in the\r\nclimate of modern Turkey, is express[h], that \"_duas uxores eodem\r\ntempore habere non licet_.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Bro. Abr. _tit. Bastardy._ pl. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: _Inst._ 1. 10. 6.]\r\n\r\n2. THE next legal disability is want of age. This is sufficient to\r\navoid all other contracts, on account of the imbecillity of judgment\r\nin the parties contracting; _a fortiori_ therefore it ought to avoid\r\nthis, the most important contract of any. Therefore if a boy under\r\nfourteen, or a girl under twelve years of age, marries, this marriage\r\nis only inchoate and imperfect; and, when either of them comes to the\r\nage of consent aforesaid, they may disagree and declare the marriage\r\nvoid, without any divorce or sentence in the spiritual court. This is\r\nfounded on the civil law[i]. But the canon law pays a greater regard\r\nto the constitution, than the age, of the parties[k]: for if they are\r\n_habiles ad matrimonium_, it is a good marriage, whatever their age\r\nmay be. And in our law it is so far a marriage, that, if at the age of\r\nconsent they agree to continue together, they need not be married\r\nagain[l]. If the husband be of years of discretion, and the wife under\r\ntwelve, when she comes to years of discretion he may disagree as well\r\nas she may: for in contracts the obligation must be mutual; both must\r\nbe bound, or neither: and so it is, _vice versa_, when the wife is of\r\nyears of discretion, and the husband under[m].\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: _Leon. Constit._ 109.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: _Decretal._ _l._ 4. _tit._ 2. _qu._ 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: Co. Litt. 79.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n3. ANOTHER incapacity arises from want of consent of parents or\r\nguardians. By the common law, if the parties themselves were of the\r\nage of consent, there wanted no other concurrence to make the marriage\r\nvalid: and this was agreeable to the canon law. But, by several\r\nstatutes[n], penalties of 100_l._ are laid on every clergyman who\r\nmarries a couple either without publication of banns (which may give\r\nnotice to parents or guardians) or without a licence, to obtain which\r\nthe consent of parents or guardians must be sworn to. And by the\r\nstatute 4 & 5 Ph. & M. c. 8. whosoever marries any woman child under\r\nthe age of sixteen years, without consent of parents or guardians,\r\nshall be subject to fine, or five years imprisonment: and her estate\r\nduring the husband's life shall go to and be enjoyed by the next heir.\r\nThe civil law indeed required the consent of the parent or tutor at\r\nall ages; unless the children were emancipated, or out of the parents\r\npower[o]: and, if such consent from the father was wanting, the\r\nmarriage was null, and the children illegitimate[p]; but the consent\r\nof the mother or guardians, if unreasonably withheld, might be\r\nredressed and supplied by the judge, or the president of the\r\nprovince[q]: and if the father was _non compos_, a similar remedy was\r\ngiven[r]. These provisions are adopted and imitated by the French and\r\nHollanders, with this difference: that in France the sons cannot marry\r\nwithout consent of parents till thirty years of age, nor the daughters\r\ntill twenty five[s]; and in Holland, the sons are at their own\r\ndisposal at twenty five, and the daughters at twenty[t]. Thus hath\r\nstood, and thus at present stands, the law in other neighbouring\r\ncountries. And it has been lately thought proper to introduce somewhat\r\nof the same policy into our laws, by statute 26 Geo. II. c. 33.\r\nwhereby it is enacted, that all marriages celebrated by licence (for\r\nbanns suppose notice) where either of the parties is under twenty\r\none, (not being a widow or widower, who are supposed emancipated)\r\nwithout the consent of the father, or, if he be not living, of the\r\nmother or guardians, shall be absolutely void. A like provision is\r\nmade as in the civil law, where the mother or guardian is _non\r\ncompos_, beyond sea, or unreasonably froward, to dispense with such\r\nconsent at the discretion of the lord chancellor: but no provision is\r\nmade, in case the father should labour under any mental or other\r\nincapacity. Much may be, and much has been, said both for and against\r\nthis innovation upon our antient laws and constitution. On the one\r\nhand, it prevents the clandestine marriages of minors, which are often\r\na terrible inconvenience to those private families wherein they\r\nhappen. On the other hand, restraints upon marriage, especially among\r\nthe lower class, are evidently detrimental to the public, by hindering\r\nthe encrease of people; and to religion and morality, by encouraging\r\nlicentiousness and debauchery among the single of both sexes; and\r\nthereby destroying one end of society and government, which is,\r\n_concubitu prohibere vago_. And of this last inconvenience the Roman\r\nlaws were so sensible, that at the same time that they forbad marriage\r\nwithout the consent of parents or guardians, they were less rigorous\r\nupon that very account with regard to other restraints: for, if a\r\nparent did not provide a husband for his daughter, by the time she\r\narrived at the age of twenty five, and she afterwards made a slip in\r\nher conduct, he was not allowed to disinherit her upon that account;\r\n\"_quia non sua culpa, sed parentum, id commisisse cognoscitur_[u].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: 6 & 7 W. III. c. 6. 7 & 8 W. III. c. 35. 10 Ann. c. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: _Ff._ 23. 2. 2, & 18.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: _Ff._ 1. 5. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: _Cod._ 5. 4. 1, & 20.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: _Inst._ 1. 10. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: Domat, of dowries §. 2. Montesq. Sp. L. 23. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: _Vinnius in Inst._ _l._ 1. _t._ 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: _Nov._ 115. §. 11.]\r\n\r\n4. A FOURTH incapacity is want of reason; without a competent share of\r\nwhich, as no other, so neither can the matrimonial contract, be valid.\r\nIdiots and lunatics, by the old common law, might have married[w];\r\nwherein it was manifestly defective. The civil law judged much more\r\nsensibly, when it made such deprivations of reason a previous\r\nimpediment; though not a cause of divorce, if they happened after\r\nmarriage[x]. This defect in our laws is however remedied with regard\r\nto lunatics, and persons under frenzies, by the express words of the\r\nstatute 15 Geo. II. c. 30. and idiots, if not within the letter of the\r\nstatute, are at least within the reason of it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: 1 Roll. Abr. 357.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: _Ff._ 23. _tit._ 1. _l._ 8. & _tit._ 2. _l._ 16.]\r\n\r\nLASTLY, the parties must not only be willing, and able, to contract,\r\nbut actually must contract themselves in due form of law, to make it a\r\ngood civil marriage. Any contract made, _per verba de praesenti_, or\r\nin words of the present tense, and in case of cohabitation _per verba\r\nde futuro_ also, between persons able to contract, was before the late\r\nact deemed a valid marriage to many purposes; and the parties might be\r\ncompelled in the spiritual courts to celebrate it _in facie\r\necclesiae_. But these verbal contracts are now of no force, to compel\r\na future marriage[y]. Neither is any marriage at present valid, that\r\nis not celebrated in some parish church or public chapel, unless by\r\ndispensation from the arch-bishop of Canterbury. It must also be\r\npreceded by publication of banns, or by licence from the spiritual\r\njudge. Many other formalities are likewise prescribed by the act; the\r\nneglect of which, though penal, does not invalidate the marriage. It\r\nis held to be also essential to a marriage, that it be performed by a\r\nperson in orders[z]; though the intervention of a priest to solemnize\r\nthis contract is merely _juris positivi_, and not _juris naturalis aut\r\ndivini_: it being said that pope Innocent the third was the first who\r\nordained the celebration of marriage in the church[a]; before which it\r\nwas totally a civil contract. And, in the times of the grand\r\nrebellion, all marriages were performed by the justices of the peace;\r\nand these marriages were declared valid, without any fresh\r\nsolemnization, by statute 12 Car. II. c. 33. But, as the law now\r\nstands, we may upon the whole collect, that no marriage by the\r\ntemporal law is _ipso facto_ void, that is celebrated by a person in\r\norders,--in a parish church or public chapel (or elsewhere, by special\r\ndispensation)--in pursuance of banns or a licence,--between single\r\npersons,--consenting,--of sound mind,--and of the age of twenty one\r\nyears;--or of the age of fourteen in males and twelve in females, with\r\nconsent of parents or guardians, or without it, in case of widowhood.\r\nAnd no marriage is _voidable_ by the ecclesiastical law, after the\r\ndeath of either of the parties; nor during their lives, unless for the\r\ncanonical impediments of pre-contract, if that indeed still exists; of\r\nconsanguinity; and of affinity, or corporal imbecillity, subsisting\r\nprevious to the marriage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Stat. 26 Geo. II. c. 33.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: Salk. 119.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: Moor 170.]\r\n\r\nII. I AM next to consider the manner in which marriages may be\r\ndissolved; and this is either by death, or divorce. There are two\r\nkinds of divorce, the one total, the other partial; the one _a vinculo\r\nmatrimonii_, the other merely _a mensa et thoro_. The total divorce,\r\n_a vinculo matrimonii_, must be for some of the canonical causes of\r\nimpediment before-mentioned; and those, existing _before_ the\r\nmarriage, as is always the case in consanguinity; not supervenient, or\r\narising _afterwards_, as may be the case in affinity or corporal\r\nimbecillity. For in cases of total divorce, the marriage is declared\r\nnull, as having been absolutely unlawful _ab initio_; and the parties\r\nare therefore separated _pro salute animarum_: for which reason, as\r\nwas before observed, no divorce can be obtained, but during the life\r\nof the parties. The issue of such marriage, as is thus entirely\r\ndissolved, are bastards[b].\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Co. Litt. 235.]\r\n\r\nDIVORCE _a mensa et thoro_ is when the marriage is just and lawful _ab\r\ninitio_, and therefore the law is tender of dissolving it; but, for\r\nsome supervenient cause, it becomes improper or impossible for the\r\nparties to live together: as in the case of intolerable ill temper, or\r\nadultery, in either of the parties. For the canon law, which the\r\ncommon law follows in this case, deems so highly and with such\r\nmysterious reverence of the nuptial tie, that it will not allow it to\r\nbe unloosed for any cause whatsoever, that arises after the union is\r\nmade. And this is said to be built on the divine revealed law; though\r\nthat expressly assigns incontinence as a cause, and indeed the only\r\ncause, why a man may put away his wife and marry another[c]. The civil\r\nlaw, which is partly of pagan original, allows many causes of absolute\r\ndivorce; and some of them pretty severe ones, (as if a wife goes to\r\nthe theatre or the public games, without the knowlege and consent of\r\nthe husband[d]) but among them adultery is the principal, and with\r\nreason named the first[e]. But with us in England adultery is only a\r\ncause of separation from bed and board[f]: for which the best reason\r\nthat can be given, is, that if divorces were allowed to depend upon a\r\nmatter within the power of either the parties, they would probably be\r\nextremely frequent; as was the case when divorces were allowed for\r\ncanonical disabilities, on the mere confession of the parties[g],\r\nwhich is now prohibited by the canons[h]. However, divorces _a vinculo\r\nmatrimonii_, for adultery, have of late years been frequently granted\r\nby act of parliament.\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Matt. xix. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: _Nov._ 117.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: _Cod._ 5. 17. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Moor 683.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: 2 Mod. 314.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Can. 1603 c. 105.]\r\n\r\nIN case of divorce _a mensa et thoro_, the law allows alimony to the\r\nwife; which is that allowance, which is made to a woman for her\r\nsupport out of the husband's estate; being settled at the discretion\r\nof the ecclesiastical judge, on consideration of all the circumstances\r\nof the case. This is sometimes called her _estovers_; for which, if he\r\nrefuses payment, there is (besides the ordinary process of\r\nexcommunication) a writ at common law _de estoveriis habendis_, in\r\norder to recover it[i]. It is generally proportioned to the rank and\r\nquality of the parties. But in case of elopement, and living with an\r\nadulterer, the law allows her no alimony[k].\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: 1 Lev. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Cowel. tit. Alimony.]\r\n\r\nIII. HAVING thus shewn how marriages may be made, or dissolved, I come\r\nnow, lastly, to speak of the legal consequences of such making, or\r\ndissolution.\r\n\r\nBY marriage, the husband and wife are one person in law[l]: that is,\r\nthe very being or legal existence of the woman is suspended during the\r\nmarriage, or at least is incorporated and consolidated into that of\r\nthe husband: under whose wing, protection, and _cover_, she performs\r\nevery thing; and is therefore called in our law-french a\r\n_feme-covert_; is said to be _covert-baron_, or under the protection\r\nand influence of her husband, her _baron_, or lord; and her condition\r\nduring her marriage is called her _coverture_. Upon this principle, of\r\nan union of person in husband and wife, depend almost all the legal\r\nrights, duties, and disabilities, that either of them acquire by the\r\nmarriage. I speak not at present of the rights of property, but of\r\nsuch as are merely _personal_. For this reason, a man cannot grant any\r\nthing to his wife, or enter into covenant with her[m]: for the grant\r\nwould be to suppose her separate existence; and to covenant with her,\r\nwould be only to covenant with himself: and therefore it is also\r\ngenerally true, that all compacts made between husband and wife, when\r\nsingle, are voided by the intermarriage[n]. A woman indeed may be\r\nattorney for her husband[o]; for that implies no separation from, but\r\nis rather a representation of, her lord. And a husband may also\r\nbequeath any thing to his wife by will; for that cannot take effect\r\ntill the coverture is determined by his death[p]. The husband is bound\r\nto provide his wife with necessaries by law, as much as himself; and\r\nif she contracts debts for them, he is obliged to pay them[q]: but for\r\nany thing besides necessaries, he is not chargeable[r]. Also if a wife\r\nelopes, and lives with another man, the husband is not chargeable even\r\nfor necessaries[s]; at least if the person, who furnishes them, is\r\nsufficiently apprized of her elopement[t]. If the wife be indebted\r\nbefore marriage, the husband is bound afterwards to pay the debt; for\r\nhe has adopted her and her circumstances together[u]. If the wife be\r\ninjured in her person or her property, she can bring no action for\r\nredress without her husband's concurrence, and in his name, as well as\r\nher own[w]: neither can she be sued, without making the husband a\r\ndefendant[x]. There is indeed one case where the wife shall sue and be\r\nsued as a feme sole, viz. where the husband has abjured the realm, or\r\nis banished[y]: for then he is dead in law; and, the husband being\r\nthus disabled to sue for or defend the wife, it would be most\r\nunreasonable if she had no remedy, or could make no defence at all. In\r\ncriminal prosecutions, it is true, the wife may be indicted and\r\npunished separately[z]; for the union is only a civil union. But, in\r\ntrials of any sort, they are not allowed to be evidence for, or\r\nagainst, each other[a]: partly because it is impossible their\r\ntestimony should be indifferent; but principally because of the union\r\nof person: and therefore, if they were admitted to be witnesses _for_\r\neach other, they would contradict one maxim of law, \"_nemo in propria\r\ncausa testis esse debet_;\" and if _against_ each other, they would\r\ncontradict another maxim, \"_nemo tenetur seipsum accusare_.\" But where\r\nthe offence is directly against the person of the wife, this rule has\r\nbeen usually dispensed with[b]: and therefore, by statute 3 Hen. VII.\r\nc. 2. in case a woman be forcibly taken away, and married, she may be\r\na witness against such her husband, in order to convict him of felony.\r\nFor in this case she can with no propriety be reckoned his wife;\r\nbecause a main ingredient, her consent, was wanting to the contract:\r\nand also there is another maxim of law, that no man shall take\r\nadvantage of his own wrong; which the ravisher here would do, if by\r\nforcibly marrying a woman, he could prevent her from being a witness,\r\nwho is perhaps the only witness, to that very fact.\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: Co. Litt. 112.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: Cro. Car. 551.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: F.N.B. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: Co. Litt. 112.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: Salk. 118.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: 1 Sid. 120.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: Stra. 647.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: 1 Lev. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: 3 Mod. 186.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: Salk. 119. 1 Roll. Abr. 347.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: 1 Leon. 312. This was also the practice in the courts of\r\nAthens. (Pott. Antiqu. b. 1. c. 21.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Co. Litt. 133.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: 1 Hawk. P.C. 3.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: 2 Haw. P.C. 431.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: State trials, vol. 1. Lord Audley's case. Stra. 633.]\r\n\r\nIN the civil law the husband and wife are considered as two distinct\r\npersons; and may have separate estates, contracts, debts, and\r\ninjuries[c]: and therefore, in our ecclesiastical courts, a woman may\r\nsue and be sued without her husband[d].\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: _Cod._ 4. 12. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: 2 Roll. Abr. 298.]\r\n\r\nBUT, though our law in general considers man and wife as one person,\r\nyet there are some instances in which she is separately considered; as\r\ninferior to him, and acting by his compulsion. And therefore all deeds\r\nexecuted, and acts done, by her, during her coverture, are void, or at\r\nleast voidable; except it be a fine, or the like matter of record, in\r\nwhich case she must be solely and secretly examined, to learn if her\r\nact be voluntary[e]. She cannot by will devise lands to her husband,\r\nunless under special circumstances; for at the time of making it she\r\nis supposed to be under his coercion[f]. And in some felonies, and\r\nother inferior crimes, committed by her, through constraint of her\r\nhusband, the law excuses her[g]: but this extends not to treason or\r\nmurder.\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Litt. §. 669, 670.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Co. Litt. 112.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: 1 Hawk. P.C. 2.]\r\n\r\nTHE husband also (by the old law) might give his wife moderate\r\ncorrection[h]. For, as he is to answer for her misbehaviour, the law\r\nthought it reasonable to intrust him with this power of restraining\r\nher, by domestic chastisement, in the same moderation that a man is\r\nallowed to correct his servants or children; for whom the master or\r\nparent is also liable in some cases to answer. But this power of\r\ncorrection was confined within reasonable bounds[i]; and the husband\r\nwas prohibited to use any violence to his wife, _aliter quam ad virum,\r\nex causa regiminis et castigationis uxoris suae, licite et\r\nrationabiliter pertinet_[k]. The civil law gave the husband the same,\r\nor a larger, authority over his wife; allowing him, for some\r\nmisdemesnors, _flagellis et fustibus acriter verberare uxorem_; for\r\nothers, only _modicam castigationem adhibere_[l]. But, with us, in\r\nthe politer reign of Charles the second, this power of correction\r\nbegan to be doubted[m]: and a wife may now have security of the peace\r\nagainst her husband[n]; or, in return, a husband against his wife[o].\r\nYet the lower rank of people, who were always fond of the old common\r\nlaw, still claim and exert their antient privilege: and the courts of\r\nlaw will still permit a husband to restrain a wife of her liberty, in\r\ncase of any gross misbehaviour[p].\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: _Ibid._ 130.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: Moor. 874.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: F.N.B. 80.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: _Nov._ 117. _c._ 14. & Van Leeuwen _in loc._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: 1 Sid. 113. 3 Keb. 433.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: 2 Lev. 128.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: Stra. 1207.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: Stra. 478. 875.]\r\n\r\nTHESE are the chief legal effects of marriage during the coverture;\r\nupon which we may observe, that even the disabilities, which the wife\r\nlies under, are for the most part intended for her protection and\r\nbenefit. So great a favourite is the female sex of the laws of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE SIXTEENTH.\r\n\r\nOF PARENT AND CHILD.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE next, and the most universal relation in nature, is immediately\r\nderived from the preceding, being that between parent and child.\r\n\r\nCHILDREN are of two sorts; legitimate, and spurious, or bastards: each\r\nof which we shall consider in their order; and first of legitimate\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nI. A LEGITIMATE child is he that is born in lawful wedlock, or within\r\na competent time afterwards. \"_Pater est quem nuptiae demonstrant_,\"\r\nis the rule of the civil law[a]; and this holds with the civilians,\r\nwhether the nuptials happen before, or after, the birth of the child.\r\nWith us in England the rule is narrowed, for the nuptials must be\r\nprecedent to the birth; of which more will be said when we come to\r\nconsider the case of bastardy. At present let us enquire into, 1. The\r\nlegal duties of parents to their legitimate children. 2. Their power\r\nover them. 3. The duties of such children to their parents.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: _Ff._ 2. 4. 5.]\r\n\r\n1. AND, first, the duties of parents to legitimate children: which\r\nprincipally consist in three particulars; their maintenance, their\r\nprotection, and their education.\r\n\r\nTHE duty of parents to provide for the _maintenance_ of their children\r\nis a principle of natural law; an obligation, says Puffendorf[b], laid\r\non them not only by nature herself, but by their own proper act, in\r\nbringing them into the world: for they would be in the highest manner\r\ninjurious to their issue, if they only gave the children life, that\r\nthey might afterwards see them perish. By begetting them therefore\r\nthey have entered into a voluntary obligation, to endeavour, as far as\r\nin them lies, that the life which they have bestowed shall be\r\nsupported and preserved. And thus the children will have a perfect\r\n_right_ of receiving maintenance from their parents. And the president\r\nMontesquieu[c] has a very just observation upon this head: that the\r\nestablishment of marriage in all civilized states is built on this\r\nnatural obligation of the father to provide for his children; for that\r\nascertains and makes known the person who is bound to fulfil this\r\nobligation: whereas, in promiscuous and illicit conjunctions, the\r\nfather is unknown; and the mother finds a thousand obstacles in her\r\nway;--shame, remorse, the constraint of her sex, and the rigor of\r\nlaws;--that stifle her inclinations to perform this duty: and besides,\r\nshe generally wants ability.\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: L. of N. l. 4. c. 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Sp. L. l. 23. c. 2.]\r\n\r\nTHE municipal laws of all well-regulated states have taken care to\r\nenforce this duty: though providence has done it more effectually than\r\nany laws, by implanting in the breast of every parent that natural\r\n[Greek: storgê], or insuperable degree of affection, which not even\r\nthe deformity of person or mind, not even the wickedness, ingratitude,\r\nand rebellion of children, can totally suppress or extinguish.\r\n\r\nTHE civil law[d] obliges the parent to provide maintenance for his\r\nchild; and, if he refuses, \"_judex de ea re cognoscet_.\" Nay, it\r\ncarries this matter so far, that it will not suffer a parent at his\r\ndeath totally to disinherit his child, without expressly giving his\r\nreason for so doing; and there are fourteen such reasons reckoned\r\nup[e], which may justify such disinherison. If the parent alleged no\r\nreason, or a bad, or false one, the child might set the will aside,\r\n_tanquam testamentum inofficiosum_, a testament contrary to the\r\nnatural duty of the parent. And it is remarkable under what colour the\r\nchildren were to move for relief in such a case: by suggesting that\r\nthe parent had lost the use of his reason, when he made the\r\n_inofficious_ testament. And this, as Puffendorf observes[f], was not\r\nto bring into dispute the testator's power of disinheriting his own\r\noffspring; but to examine the motives upon which he did it: and, if\r\nthey were found defective in reason, then to set them aside. But\r\nperhaps this is going rather too far: every man has, or ought to have,\r\nby the laws of society, a power over his own property: and, as Grotius\r\nvery well distinguishes[g], natural right obliges to give a\r\n_necessary_ maintenance to children; but what is more than that, they\r\nhave no other right to, than as it is given them by the favour of\r\ntheir parents, or the positive constitutions of the municipal law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: _Ff._ 25. 3. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: _Nov._ 115.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: _l._ 4. _c._ 11. §. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: _De j.b. & p._ _l._ 2. _c._ 7. _n._ 3.]\r\n\r\nLET us next see what provision our own laws have made for this natural\r\nduty. It is a principle of law[h], that there is an obligation on\r\nevery man to provide for those descended from his loins: and the\r\nmanner, in which this obligation shall be performed, is thus pointed\r\nout[i]. The father, and mother, grandfather, and grandmother of poor\r\nimpotent persons shall maintain them at their own charges, if of\r\nsufficient ability, according as the quarter sessions shall direct:\r\nand[k] if a parent runs away, and leaves his children, the\r\nchurchwardens and overseers of the parish shall seise his rents,\r\ngoods, and chattels, and dispose of them towards their relief. By the\r\ninterpretations which the courts of law have made upon these statutes,\r\nif a mother or grandmother marries again, and was before such second\r\nmarriage of sufficient ability to keep the child, the husband shall be\r\ncharged to maintain it[l]: for this being a debt of hers, when\r\nsingle, shall like others extend to charge the husband. But at her\r\ndeath, the relation being dissolved, the husband is under no farther\r\nobligation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Raym. 500.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: Stat. 43 Eliz. c. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Stat. 5 Geo. I. c. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: Styles. 283. 2 Bulstr. 346.]\r\n\r\nNO person is bound to provide a maintenance for his issue, unless\r\nwhere the children are impotent and unable to work, either through\r\ninfancy, disease, or accident; and then is only obliged to find them\r\nwith necessaries, the penalty on refusal being no more than 20_s._ a\r\nmonth. For the policy of our laws, which are ever watchful to promote\r\nindustry, did not mean to compel a father to maintain his idle and\r\nlazy children in ease and indolence: but thought it unjust to oblige\r\nthe parent, against his will, to provide them with superfluities, and\r\nother indulgences of fortune; imagining they might trust to the\r\nimpulse of nature, if the children were deserving of such favours.\r\nYet, as nothing is so apt to stifle the calls of nature as religious\r\nbigotry, it is enacted[m], that if any popish parent shall refuse to\r\nallow his protestant child a fitting maintenance, with a view to\r\ncompel him to change his religion, the lord chancellor shall by order\r\nof court constrain him to do what is just and reasonable. But this did\r\nnot extend to persons of another religion, of no less bitterness and\r\nbigotry than the popish: and therefore in the very next year we find\r\nan instance of a Jew of immense riches, whose only daughter having\r\nembraced christianity, he turned her out of doors; and on her\r\napplication for relief, it was held she was intitled to none[n]. But\r\nthis gave occasion[o] to another statute[p], which ordains, that if\r\njewish parents refuse to allow their protestant children a fitting\r\nmaintenance, suitable to the fortune of the parent, the lord\r\nchancellor on complaint may make such order therein as he shall see\r\nproper.\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: Stat. 11 & 12 W. III. c. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: Lord Raym. 699.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: Com. Journ. 18 Feb. 12 Mar. 1701.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: 1 Ann. st. 1. c. 30.]\r\n\r\nOUR law has made no provision to prevent the disinheriting of children\r\nby will; leaving every man's property in his own disposal, upon a\r\nprinciple of liberty in this, as well as every other, action: though\r\nperhaps it had not been amiss, if the parent had been bound to leave\r\nthem at the least a necessary subsistence. By the custom of London\r\nindeed, (which was formerly universal throughout the kingdom) the\r\nchildren of freemen are entitled to one third of their father's\r\neffects, to be equally divided among them; of which he cannot deprive\r\nthem. And, among persons of any rank or fortune, a competence is\r\ngenerally provided for younger children, and the bulk of the estate\r\nsettled upon the eldest, by the marriage-articles. Heirs also, and\r\nchildren, are favourites of our courts of justice, and cannot be\r\ndisinherited by any dubious or ambiguous words; there being required\r\nthe utmost certainty of the testator's intentions to take away the\r\nright of an heir[q].\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: 1 Lev. 130.]\r\n\r\nFROM the duty of maintenance we may easily pass to that of\r\n_protection_; which is also a natural duty, but rather permitted than\r\nenjoined by any municipal laws: nature, in this respect, working so\r\nstrongly as to need rather a check than a spur. A parent may, by our\r\nlaws, maintain and uphold his children in their lawsuits, without\r\nbeing guilty of the legal crime of maintaining quarrels[r]. A parent\r\nmay also justify an assault and battery in defence of the persons of\r\nhis children[s]: nay, where a man's son was beaten by another boy, and\r\nthe father went near a mile to find him, and there revenged his son's\r\nquarrel by beating the other boy, of which beating he afterwards died;\r\nit was not held to be murder, but manslaughter merely[t]. Such\r\nindulgence does the law shew to the frailty of human nature, and the\r\nworkings of parental affection.\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: 2 Inst. 564.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: 1 Hawk. P.C. 131.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: Cro. Jac. 296. 1 Hawk. P.C. 83.]\r\n\r\nTHE last duty of parents to their children is that of giving them an\r\n_education_ suitable to their station in life: a duty pointed out by\r\nreason, and of far the greatest importance of any. For, as Puffendorf\r\nvery well observes[u], it is not easy to imagine or allow, that a\r\nparent has conferred any considerable benefit upon his child, by\r\nbringing him into the world; if he afterwards entirely neglects his\r\nculture and education, and suffers him to grow up like a mere beast,\r\nto lead a life useless to others, and shameful to himself. Yet the\r\nmunicipal laws of most countries seem to be defective in this point,\r\nby not constraining the parent to bestow a proper education upon his\r\nchildren. Perhaps they thought it punishment enough to leave the\r\nparent, who neglects the instruction of his family, to labour under\r\nthose griefs and inconveniences, which his family, so uninstructed,\r\nwill be sure to bring upon him. Our laws, though their defects in this\r\nparticular cannot be denied, have in one instance made a wise\r\nprovision for breeding up the rising generation; since the poor and\r\nlaborious part of the community, when past the age of nurture, are\r\ntaken out of the hands of their parents, by the statutes for\r\napprenticing poor children[w]; and are placed out by the public in\r\nsuch a manner, as may render their abilities, in their several\r\nstations, of the greatest advantage to the commonwealth. The rich\r\nindeed are left at their own option, whether they will breed up their\r\nchildren to be ornaments or disgraces to their family. Yet in one\r\ncase, that of religion, they are under peculiar restrictions: for[x]\r\nit is provided, that if any person sends any child under his\r\ngovernment beyond the seas, either to prevent it's good education in\r\nEngland, or in order to enter into or reside in any popish college, or\r\nto be instructed, persuaded, or strengthened in the popish religion;\r\nin such case, besides the disabilities incurred by the child so sent,\r\nthe parent or person sending shall forfeit 100_l._ which[y] shall go\r\nto the sole use and benefit of him that shall discover the offence.\r\nAnd[z] if any parent, or other, shall send or convey any person beyond\r\nsea, to enter into, or be resident in, or trained up in, any priory,\r\nabbey, nunnery, popish university, college, or school, or house of\r\njesuits, or priests, or in any private popish family, in order to be\r\ninstructed, persuaded, or confirmed in the popish religion; or shall\r\ncontribute any thing towards their maintenance when abroad by any\r\npretext whatever, the person both sending and sent shall be disabled\r\nto sue in law or equity, or to be executor or administrator to any\r\nperson, or to enjoy any legacy or deed of gift, or to bear any office\r\nin the realm, and shall forfeit all his goods and chattels, and\r\nlikewise all his real estate for life.\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: L. of N. b. 6. c. 2. §. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: See page 414.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: Stat. 1 Jac. I. c. 4. & 3 Jac. I. c. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Stat. 11 & 12 W. III. c. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: Stat. 3 Car. I. c. 2.]\r\n\r\n2. THE _power_ of parents over their children is derived from the\r\nformer consideration, their duty; this authority being given them,\r\npartly to enable the parent more effectually to perform his duty, and\r\npartly as a recompence for his care and trouble in the faithful\r\ndischarge of it. And upon this score the municipal laws of some\r\nnations have given a much larger authority to the parents, than\r\nothers. The antient Roman laws gave the father a power of life and\r\ndeath over his children; upon this principle, that he who gave had\r\nalso the power of taking away[a]. But the rigor of these laws was\r\nsoftened by subsequent constitutions; so that[b] we find a father\r\nbanished by the emperor Hadrian for killing his son, though he had\r\ncommitted a very heinous crime, upon this maxim, that \"_patria\r\npotestas in pietate debet, non in atrocitate, consistere_.\" But still\r\nthey maintained to the last a very large and absolute authority: for a\r\nson could not acquire any property of his own during the life of his\r\nfather; but all his acquisitions belonged to the father, or at least\r\nthe profits of them for his life[c].\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: _Ff._ 28. 2. 11. _Cod._ 8. 47. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: _Ff._ 48. 9. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: _Inst._ 2. 9. 1.]\r\n\r\nTHE power of a parent by our English laws is much more moderate; but\r\nstill sufficient to keep the child in order and obedience. He may\r\nlawfully correct his child, being under age, in a reasonable\r\nmanner[d]; for this is for the benefit of his education. The consent\r\nor concurrence of the parent to the marriage of his child under age,\r\nwas also _directed_ by our antient law to be obtained: but now it is\r\nabsolutely _necessary_; for without it the contract is void[e]. And\r\nthis also is another means, which the law has put into the parent's\r\nhands, in order the better to discharge his duty; first, of\r\nprotecting his children from the snares of artful and designing\r\npersons; and, next, of settling them properly in life, by preventing\r\nthe ill consequences of too early and precipitate marriages. A father\r\nhas no other power over his sons _estate_, than as his trustee or\r\nguardian; for, though he may receive the profits during the child's\r\nminority, yet he must account for them when he comes of age. He may\r\nindeed have the benefit of his children's labour while they live with\r\nhim, and are maintained by him: but this is no more than he is\r\nentitled to from his apprentices or servants. The legal power of a\r\nfather (for a mother, as such, is entitled to no power, but only to\r\nreverence and respect) the power of a father, I say, over the persons\r\nof his children ceases at the age of twenty one: for they are then\r\nenfranchised by arriving at years of discretion, or that point which\r\nthe law has established (as some must necessarily be established) when\r\nthe empire of the father, or other guardian, gives place to the empire\r\nof reason. Yet, till that age arrives, this empire of the father\r\ncontinues even after his death; for he may by his will appoint a\r\nguardian to his children. He may also delegate part of his parental\r\nauthority, during his life, to the tutor or schoolmaster of his child;\r\nwho is then _in loco parentis_, and has such a portion of the power of\r\nthe parent committed to his charge, viz. that of restraint and\r\ncorrection, as may be necessary to answer the purposes for which he is\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: 1 Hawk. P.C. 130.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Stat. 26 Geo. II. c. 33.]\r\n\r\n3. THE _duties_ of children to their parents arise from a principle of\r\nnatural justice and retribution. For to those, who gave us existence,\r\nwe naturally owe subjection and obedience during our minority, and\r\nhonour and reverence ever after; they, who protected the weakness of\r\nour infancy, are entitled to our protection in the infirmity of their\r\nage; they who by sustenance and education have enabled their offspring\r\nto prosper, ought in return to be supported by that offspring, in case\r\nthey stand in need of assistance. Upon this principle proceed all the\r\nduties of children to their parents, which are enjoined by positive\r\nlaws. And the Athenian laws[f] carried this principle into practice\r\nwith a scrupulous kind of nicety: obliging all children to provide for\r\ntheir father, when fallen into poverty; with an exception to spurious\r\nchildren, to those whose chastity had been prostituted by consent of\r\nthe father, and to those whom he had not put in any way of gaining a\r\nlivelyhood. The legislature, says baron Montesquieu[g], considered,\r\nthat in the first case the father, being uncertain, had rendered the\r\nnatural obligation precarious; that, in the second case, he had\r\nsullied the life he had given, and done his children the greatest of\r\ninjuries, in depriving them of their reputation; and that, in the\r\nthird case, he had rendered their life (so far as in him lay) an\r\ninsupportable burthen, by furnishing them with no means of\r\nsubsistence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Potter's Antiq. b. 4. c. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Sp. L. l. 26. c. 5.]\r\n\r\nOUR laws agree with those of Athens with regard to the first only of\r\nthese particulars, the case of spurious issue. In the other cases the\r\nlaw does not hold the tie of nature to be dissolved by any\r\nmisbehaviour of the parent; and therefore a child is equally\r\njustifiable in defending the person, or maintaining the cause or suit,\r\nof a bad parent, as a good one; and is equally compellable[h], if of\r\nsufficient ability, to maintain and provide for a wicked and unnatural\r\nprogenitor, as for one who has shewn the greatest tenderness and\r\nparental piety.\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: Stat. 43 Eliz. c. 2.]\r\n\r\nII. WE are next to consider the case of illegitimate children, or\r\nbastards; with regard to whom let us inquire, 1. Who are bastards. 2.\r\nThe legal duties of the parents towards a bastard child. 3. The rights\r\nand incapacities attending such bastard children.\r\n\r\n1. WHO are bastards. A bastard, by our English laws, is one that is\r\nnot only begotten, but born, out of lawful matrimony. The civil and\r\ncanon laws do not allow a child to remain a bastard, if the parents\r\nafterwards intermarry[i]: and herein they differ most materially from\r\nour law; which, though not so strict as to require that the child\r\nshall be _begotten_, yet makes it an indispensable condition that it\r\nshall be _born_, after lawful wedlock. And the reason of our English\r\nlaw is surely much superior to that of the Roman, if we consider the\r\nprincipal end and design of establishing the contract of marriage,\r\ntaken in a civil light; abstractedly from any religious view, which\r\nhas nothing to do with the legitimacy or illegitimacy of the children.\r\nThe main end and design of marriage therefore being to ascertain and\r\nfix upon some certain person, to whom the care, the protection, the\r\nmaintenance, and the education of the children should belong; this end\r\nis undoubtedly better answered by legitimating all issue born after\r\nwedlock, than by legitimating all issue of the same parties, even born\r\nbefore wedlock, so as wedlock afterwards ensues: 1. Because of the\r\nvery great uncertainty there will generally be, in the proof that the\r\nissue was really begotten by the same man; whereas, by confining the\r\nproof to the birth, and not to the begetting, our law has rendered it\r\nperfectly certain, what child is legitimate, and who is to take care\r\nof the child. 2. Because by the Roman laws a child may be continued a\r\nbastard, or made legitimate, at the option of the father and mother,\r\nby a marriage _ex post facto_; thereby opening a door to many frauds\r\nand partialities, which by our law are prevented. 3. Because by those\r\nlaws a man may remain a bastard till forty years of age, and then\r\nbecome legitimate, by the subsequent marriage of his parents; whereby\r\nthe main end of marriage, the protection of infants, is totally\r\nfrustrated. 4. Because this rule of the Roman laws admits of no\r\nlimitations as to the time, or number, of bastards so to be\r\nlegitimated; but a dozen of them may, twenty years after their birth,\r\nby the subsequent marriage of their parents, be admitted to all the\r\nprivileges of legitimate children. This is plainly a great\r\ndiscouragement to the matrimonial state; to which one main inducement\r\nis usually not only the desire of having _children_, but also the\r\ndesire of procreating lawful _heirs_. Whereas our constitutions guard\r\nagainst this indecency, and at the same time give sufficient allowance\r\nto the frailties of human nature. For, if a child be begotten while\r\nthe parents are single, and they will endeavour to make an early\r\nreparation for the offence, by marrying within a few months after, our\r\nlaw is so indulgent as not to bastardize the child, if it be born,\r\nthough not begotten, in lawful wedlock: for this is an incident that\r\ncan happen but once; since all future children will be begotten, as\r\nwell as born, within the rules of honour and civil society. Upon\r\nreasons like these we may suppose the peers to have acted at the\r\nparliament of Merton, when they refused to enact that children born\r\nbefore marriage should be esteemed legitimate[k].\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: _Inst._ 1. 10. 13. _Decretal._ _l._ 4. _t._ 17. _c._ 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: _Rogaverunt omnes episcopi magnates, ut consentirent quod\r\nnati ante matrimonium essent legitimi, sicut illi qui nati sunt post\r\nmatrimonium, quia ecclesia tales habet pro legitimis. Et omnes comites\r\net barones una voce responderunt, quod nolunt leges Angliae mutare,\r\nquae hucusque usitatae sunt et approbatae._ Stat. 20 Hen. III. c. 9.\r\nSee the introduction to the great charter, _edit. Oxon._ 1759. _sub\r\nanno_ 1253.]\r\n\r\nFROM what has been said it appears, that all children born before\r\nmatrimony are bastards by our law; and so it is of all children born\r\nso long after the death of the husband, that, by the usual course of\r\ngestation, they could not be begotten by him. But, this being a matter\r\nof some uncertainty, the law is not exact as to a few days[l]. And\r\nthis gives occasion to a proceeding at common law, where a widow is\r\nsuspected to feign herself with child, in order to produce a\r\nsupposititious heir to the estate: an attempt which the rigor of the\r\nGothic constitutions esteemed equivalent to the most atrocious theft,\r\nand therefore punished with death[m]. In this case with us the heir\r\npresumptive may have a writ _de ventre inspiciendo_, to examine\r\nwhether she be with child, or not[n]; which is entirely conformable to\r\nthe practice of the civil law[o]: and, if the widow be upon due\r\nexamination found not pregnant, any issue she may afterwards produce,\r\nthough within nine months, will be bastard. But if a man dies, and his\r\nwidow soon after marries again, and a child is born within such a\r\ntime, as that by the course of nature it might have been the child of\r\neither husband; in this case he is said to be more than ordinarily\r\nlegitimate; for he may, when he arrives to years of discretion,\r\nchoose which of the fathers he pleases[p]. To prevent this, among\r\nother inconveniences, the civil law ordained that no widow should\r\nmarry _infra annum luctus_[q]; a rule which obtained so early as the\r\nreign of Augustus[r], if not of Romulus: and the same constitution was\r\nprobably handed down to our early ancestors from the Romans, during\r\ntheir stay in this island; for we find it established under the Saxon\r\nand Danish governments[s].\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: Cro.

As if the husband be out of the\r\nkingdom of England (or, as the law somewhat loosely phrases it, _extra\r\nquatuor maria_) for above nine months, so that no access to his wife\r\ncan be presumed, her issue during that period shall be bastard[t].\r\nBut, generally, during the coverture access of the husband shall be\r\npresumed, unless the contrary can be shewn[u]; which is such a\r\nnegative as can only be proved by shewing him to be elsewhere: for the\r\ngeneral rule is, _praesumitur pro legitimatione_[w]. In a divorce _a\r\nmensa et thoro_, if the wife breeds children, they are bastards; for\r\nthe law will presume the husband and wife conformable to the sentence\r\nof separation, unless access be proved: but, in a voluntary separation\r\nby agreement, the law will suppose access, unless the negative be\r\nshewn[x]. So also if there is an apparent impossibility of procreation\r\non the part of the husband, as if he be only eight years old, or the\r\nlike, there the issue of the wife shall be bastard[y]. Likewise, in\r\ncase of divorce in the spiritual court _a vinculo matrimonii_, all the\r\nissue born during the coverture are bastards[z]; because such divorce\r\nis always upon some cause, that rendered the marriage unlawful and\r\nnull from the beginning.\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: Co. Litt. 244.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: Salk. 123. 3 P.W. 276. Stra. 925.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: 5 Rep. 98.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: Salk. 123.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Co. Litt. 244.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: _Ibid._ 235.]\r\n\r\n2. LET us next see the duty of parents to their bastard children, by\r\nour law; which is principally that of maintenance. For, though\r\nbastards are not looked upon as children to any civil purposes, yet\r\nthe ties of nature, of which maintenance is one, are not so easily\r\ndissolved: and they hold indeed as to many other intentions; as,\r\nparticularly, that a man shall not marry his bastard sister or\r\ndaughter[a]. The civil law therefore, when it denied maintenance to\r\nbastards begotten under certain atrocious circumstances[b], was\r\nneither consonant to nature, nor reason, however profligate and wicked\r\nthe parents might justly be esteemed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: Lord Raym. 68. Comb. 356.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: _Nov._ 89. _c._ 15.]\r\n\r\nTHE method in which the English law provides maintenance for them is\r\nas follows[c]. When a woman is delivered, or declares herself with\r\nchild, of a bastard, and will by oath before a justice of peace charge\r\nany person having got her with child, the justice shall cause such\r\nperson to be apprehended, and commit him till he gives security,\r\neither to maintain the child, or appear at the next quarter sessions\r\nto dispute and try the fact. But if the woman dies, or is married\r\nbefore delivery, or miscarries, or proves not to have been with child,\r\nthe person shall be discharged: otherwise the sessions, or two\r\njustices out of sessions, upon original application to them, may take\r\norder for the keeping of the bastard, by charging the mother, or the\r\nreputed father with the payment of money or other sustentation for\r\nthat purpose. And if such putative father, or lewd mother, run away\r\nfrom the parish, the overseers by direction of two justices may seize\r\ntheir rents, goods, and chattels, in order to bring up the said\r\nbastard child. Yet such is the humanity of our laws, that no woman can\r\nbe compulsively questioned concerning the father of her child, till\r\none month after her delivery: which indulgence is however very\r\nfrequently a hardship upon parishes, by suffering the parents to\r\nescape.\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Stat. 18 Eliz. c. 3. 7 Jac. I. c. 4. 3 Car. I. c. 4. 13 &\r\n14 Car. II. c. 12. 6 Geo. II. c. 31.]\r\n\r\n3. I PROCEED next to the rights and incapacities which appertain to a\r\nbastard. The rights are very few, being only such as he can _acquire_;\r\nfor he can _inherit_ nothing, being looked upon as the son of nobody,\r\nand sometimes called _filius nullius_, sometimes _filius populi_[d].\r\nYet he may gain a sirname by reputation[e], though he has none by\r\ninheritance. All other children have a settlement in their father's\r\nparish; but a bastard in the parish where born, for he hath no\r\nfather[f]. However, in case of fraud, as if a woman be sent either by\r\norder of justices, or comes to beg as a vagrant, to a parish which she\r\ndoes not belong to, and drops her bastard there; the bastard shall, in\r\nthe first case, be settled in the parish from whence she was illegally\r\nremoved[g]; or, in the latter case, in the mother's own parish, if the\r\nmother be apprehended for her vagrancy[h]. The incapacity of a bastard\r\nconsists principally in this, that he cannot be heir to any one,\r\nneither can he have heirs, but of his own body; for, being _nullius\r\nfilius_, he is therefore of kin to nobody, and has no ancestor from\r\nwhom any inheritable blood can be derived. A bastard was also, in\r\nstrictness, incapable of holy orders; and, though that were dispensed\r\nwith, yet he was utterly disqualified from holding any dignity in the\r\nchurch[i]: but this doctrine seems now obsolete; and in all other\r\nrespects, there is no distinction between a bastard and another man.\r\nAnd really any other distinction, but that of not inheriting, which\r\ncivil policy renders necessary, would, with regard to the innocent\r\noffspring of his parents' crimes, be odious, unjust, and cruel to the\r\nlast degree: and yet the civil law, so boasted of for it's equitable\r\ndecisions, made bastards in some cases incapable even of a gift from\r\ntheir parents[k]. A bastard may, lastly, be made legitimate, and\r\ncapable of inheriting, by the transcendent power of an act of\r\nparliament, and not otherwise[l]: as was done in the case of John of\r\nGant's bastard children, by a statute of Richard the second.\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: _Fort. de LL._ _c._ 40.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Co.

In examining this species of relationship, I shall first\r\nconsider the different kinds of guardians, how they are appointed, and\r\ntheir power and duty: next, the different ages of persons, as defined\r\nby the law: and, lastly, the privileges and disabilities of an infant,\r\nor one under age and subject to guardianship.\r\n\r\n1. THE guardian with us performs the office both of the _tutor_ and\r\n_curator_ of the Roman laws; the former of which had the charge of the\r\nmaintenance and education of the minor, the latter the care of his\r\nfortune; or, according to the language of the court of chancery, the\r\n_tutor_ was the committee of the person, the _curator_ the committee\r\nof the estate. But this office was frequently united in the civil\r\nlaw[a]; as it is always in our law with regard to minors, though as to\r\nlunatics and idiots it is commonly kept distinct.\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: _Ff._ 26. 4. 1.]\r\n\r\nOF the several species of guardians, the first are guardians _by\r\nnature_: viz. the father and (in some cases) the mother of the child.\r\nFor, if an estate be left to an infant, the father is by common law\r\nthe guardian, and must account to his child for the profits[b]. And,\r\nwith regard to daughters, it seems by construction of the statute 4 &\r\n5 Ph. & Mar. c. 8. that the father might by deed or will assign a\r\nguardian to any woman-child under the age of sixteen, and if none be\r\nso assigned, the mother shall in this case be guardian[c]. There are\r\nalso guardians _for nurture_[d], which are, of course, the father or\r\nmother, till the infant attains the age of fourteen years[e]: and, in\r\ndefault of father or mother, the ordinary usually assigns some\r\ndiscreet person to take care of the infant's personal estate, and to\r\nprovide for his maintenance and education[f]. Next are guardians _in\r\nsocage_, (an appellation which will be fully explained in the second\r\nbook of these commentaries) who are also called guardians _by the\r\ncommon law_. These take place only when the minor is entitled to some\r\nestate in lands, and then by the common law the guardianship devolves\r\nupon his next of kin, to whom the inheritance cannot possibly descend;\r\nas, where the estate descended from his father, in this case his uncle\r\nby the mother's side cannot possibly inherit this estate, and\r\ntherefore shall be the guardian[g]. For the law judges it improper to\r\ntrust the person of an infant in his hands, who may by possibility\r\nbecome heir to him; that there may be no temptation, nor even\r\nsuspicion of temptation, for him to abuse his trust[h]. The Roman laws\r\nproceed on a quite contrary principle, committing the care of the\r\nminor to him who is the next to succeed to the inheritance, presuming\r\nthat the next heir would take the best care of an estate, to which he\r\nhas a prospect of succeeding: and this they boast to be \"_summa\r\nprovidentia_[i].\" But in the mean time they forget, how much it is\r\nthe guardian's interest to remove the incumbrance of his pupil's life\r\nfrom that estate, for which he is supposed to have so great a\r\nregard[k]. And this affords Fortescue[l], and sir Edward Coke[m], an\r\nample opportunity for triumph; they affirming, that to commit the\r\ncustody of an infant to him that is next in succession, is \"_quasi\r\nagnum committere lupo, ad devorandum_[n].\" These guardians in socage,\r\nlike those for nurture, continue only till the minor is fourteen years\r\nof age; for then, in both cases, he is presumed to have discretion, so\r\nfar as to choose his own guardian. This he may do, unless one be\r\nappointed by father, by virtue of the statute 12 Car. II. c. 24.\r\nwhich, considering the imbecillity of judgment in children of the age\r\nof fourteen, and the abolition of guardianship _in chivalry_ (which\r\nlasted till the age of twenty one, and of which we shall speak\r\nhereafter) enacts, that any father, under age or of full age, may by\r\ndeed or will dispose of the custody of his child, either born or\r\nunborn, to any person, except a popish recusant, either in possession\r\nor reversion, till such child attains the age of one and twenty years.\r\nThese are called guardians _by statute_, or _testamentary_ guardians.\r\nThere are also special guardians _by custom_ of London, and other\r\nplaces[o]; but they are particular exceptions, and do not fall under\r\nthe general law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Co. Litt. 88.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: 3 Rep. 39.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: Co. Litt. 88.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Moor. 738. 3 Rep. 38.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: 2 Jones 90. 2 Lev. 163.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Litt. §. 123.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: _Nunquam custodia alicujus de jure alicui remanet, de quo\r\nhabeatur suspicio, quod possit vel velit aliquod jus in ipsa\r\nhereditate clamare._ Glanv. _l._ 7. _c._ 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: _Ff._ 26. 4. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: The Roman satyrist was fully aware of this danger, when\r\nhe puts this private prayer into the mouth of a selfish guardian;\r\n\r\n     _Pupillum o utinam, quem proximus haeres\r\n     Impello, expungam._ Perf. 1. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: _c._ 44.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: 1 Inst. 88.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: This policy of our English law is warranted by the wise\r\ninstitutions of Solon, who provided that no one should be another's\r\nguardian, who was to enjoy the estate after his death. (Potter's\r\nAntiqu. l. 1. c. 26.) And Charondas, another of the Grecian\r\nlegislators, directed that the inheritance should go to the father's\r\nrelations, but the education of the child to the mother's; that the\r\nguardianship and right of succession might always be kept distinct.\r\n(Petit. _Leg. Att._ _l._ 6. _t._ 7.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: Co. Litt. 88.]\r\n\r\nTHE power and reciprocal duty of a guardian and ward are the same,\r\n_pro tempore_, as that of a father and child; and therefore I shall\r\nnot repeat them: but shall only add, that the guardian, when the ward\r\ncomes of age, is bound to give him an account of all that he has\r\ntransacted on his behalf, and must answer for all losses by his wilful\r\ndefault or negligence. In order therefore to prevent disagreeable\r\ncontests with young gentlemen, it has become a practice for many\r\nguardians, of large estates especially, to indemnify themselves by\r\napplying to the court of chancery, acting under it's direction, and\r\naccounting annually before the officers of that court. For the lord\r\nchancellor is, by right derived from the crown, the general and\r\nsupreme guardian of all infants, as well as idiots and lunatics; that\r\nis, of all such persons as have not discretion enough to manage their\r\nown concerns. In case therefore any guardian abuses his trust, the\r\ncourt will check and punish him; nay sometimes proceed to the removal\r\nof him, and appoint another in his stead[p].\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: 1 Sid. 424. 1 P. Will. 703.]\r\n\r\n2. LET us next consider the ward, or person within age, for whose\r\nassistance and support these guardians are constituted by law; or who\r\nit is, that is said to be within age. The ages of male and female are\r\ndifferent for different purposes. A male at _twelve_ years old may\r\ntake the oath of allegiance; at _fourteen_ is at years of discretion,\r\nand therefore may consent or disagree to marriage, may choose his\r\nguardian, and, if his discretion be actually proved, may make his\r\ntestament of his personal estate; at _seventeen_ may be an executor;\r\nand at _twenty one_ is at his own disposal, and may aliene his lands,\r\ngoods, and chattels. A female also at _seven_ years of age may be\r\nbetrothed or given in marriage; at _nine_ is entitled to dower; at\r\n_twelve_ is at years of maturity, and therefore may consent or\r\ndisagree to marriage, and, if proved to have sufficient discretion,\r\nmay bequeath her personal estate; at _fourteen_ is at years of legal\r\ndiscretion, and may choose a guardian; at _seventeen_ may be\r\nexecutrix; and at _twenty one_ may dispose of herself and her lands.\r\nSo that full age in male or female, is twenty one years, which age is\r\ncompleted on the day preceding the anniversary of a person's birth[q];\r\nwho till that time is an infant, and so stiled in law. Among the\r\nantient Greeks and Romans _women_ were never of age, but subject to\r\nperpetual guardianship[r], unless when married, \"_nisi convenissent in\r\nmanum viri_:\" and, when that perpetual tutelage wore away in process\r\nof time, we find that, in females as well as males, full age was not\r\ntill twenty five years[s]. Thus, by the constitutions of different\r\nkingdoms, this period, which is merely arbitrary, and _juris\r\npositivi_, is fixed at different times. Scotland agrees with England\r\nin this point; (both probably copying from the old Saxon constitutions\r\non the continent, which extended the age of minority \"_ad annum\r\nvigesimum primum, et eo usque juvenes sub tutelam reponunt_[t]\") but\r\nin Naples they are of full age at _eighteen_; in France, with regard\r\nto marriage, not till _thirty_; and in Holland at _twenty five_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: Salk. 44. 625.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Pott. Antiq. l. 4. c. 11. Cic. _pro Muren._ 12.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: _Inst._ 1. 23. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: Stiernhook _de jure Sueonum._ _l._ 2. _c._ 2. This is\r\nalso the period when the king, as well as the subject, arrives at full\r\nage in modern Sweden. Mod. Un. Hist. xxxiii. 220.]\r\n\r\n3. INFANTS have various privileges, and various disabilities: but\r\ntheir very disabilities are privileges; in order to secure them from\r\nhurting themselves by their own improvident acts. An infant cannot be\r\nsued but under the protection, and joining the name, of his guardian;\r\nfor he is to defend him against all attacks as well by law as\r\notherwise[u]: but he may sue either by his guardian, or _prochein\r\namy_, his next friend who is not his guardian. This _prochein amy_ may\r\nbe any person who will undertake the infant's cause; and it frequently\r\nhappens, that an infant, by his _prochein amy_, institutes a suit in\r\nequity against a fraudulent guardian. In criminal cases, an infant of\r\nthe age of _fourteen_ years may be capitally punished for any capital\r\noffence[w]: but under the age of _seven_ he cannot. The period between\r\n_seven_ and _fourteen_ is subject to much incertainty: for the infant\r\nshall, generally speaking, be judged _prima facie_ innocent; yet if he\r\nwas _doli capax_, and could discern between good and evil at the time\r\nof the offence committed, he may be convicted and undergo judgment and\r\nexecution of death, though he hath not attained to years of puberty\r\nor discretion[x]. And sir Matthew Hale gives us two instances, one of\r\na girl of thirteen, who was burned for killing her mistress; another\r\nof a boy still younger, that had killed his companion, and hid\r\nhimself, who was hanged; for it appeared by his hiding that he knew he\r\nhad done wrong, and could discern between good and evil; and in such\r\ncases the maxim of law is, that _malitia supplet aetatem_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: Co. Litt. 135.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: 1 Hal. P.C. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: 1 Hal. P.C. 26.]\r\n\r\nWITH regard to estates and civil property, an infant hath many\r\nprivileges, which will be better understood when we come to treat more\r\nparticularly of those matters: but this may be said in general, that\r\nan infant shall lose nothing by non-claim, or neglect of demanding his\r\nright; nor shall any other _laches_ or negligence be imputed to an\r\ninfant, except in some very particular cases.\r\n\r\nIT is generally true, that an infant can neither aliene his lands, nor\r\ndo any legal act, nor make a deed, nor indeed any manner of contract,\r\nthat will bind him. But still to all these rules there are some\r\nexceptions; part of which were just now mentioned in reckoning up the\r\ndifferent capacities which they assume at different ages: and there\r\nare others, a few of which it may not be improper to recite, as a\r\ngeneral specimen of the whole. And, first, it is true, that infants\r\ncannot aliene their estates: but[y] infant trustees, or mortgagees,\r\nare enabled to convey, under the direction of the court of chancery or\r\nexchequer, the estates they hold in trust or mortgage, to such person\r\nas the court shall appoint. Also it is generally true, that an infant\r\ncan do no legal act: yet an infant who has an advowson, may present to\r\nthe benefice when it becomes void[z]. For the law in this case\r\ndispenses with one rule, in order to maintain others of far greater\r\nconsequence: it permits an infant to present a clerk (who, if unfit,\r\nmay be rejected by the bishop) rather than either suffer the church to\r\nbe unserved till he comes of age, or permit the infant to be debarred\r\nof his right by lapse to the bishop. An infant may also purchase\r\nlands, but his purchase is incomplete: for, when he comes to age, he\r\nmay either agree or disagree to it, as he thinks prudent or proper,\r\nwithout alleging any reason; and so may his heirs after him, if he\r\ndies without having completed his agreement[a]. It is, farther,\r\ngenerally true, that an infant, under twenty one, can make no deed\r\nthat is of any force or effect: yet[b] he may bind himself apprentice\r\nby deed indented, or indentures, for seven years; and[c] he may by\r\ndeed or will appoint a guardian to his children, if he has any.\r\nLastly, it is generally true, that an infant can make no other\r\ncontract that will bind him: yet he may bind himself to pay for his\r\nnecessary meat, drink, apparel, physic, and such other necessaries;\r\nand likewise for his good teaching and instruction, whereby he may\r\nprofit himself afterwards[d]. And thus much, at present, for the\r\nprivileges and disabilities of infants.\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: Stat. 7 Ann. c. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: Co. Litt. 172.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: Co. Litt. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Stat. 5 Eliz. c. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Stat. 12 Car. II. c. 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: Co. Litt. 172.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THE EIGHTEENTH.\r\n\r\nOF CORPORATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have hitherto considered persons in their natural capacities, and\r\nhave treated of their rights and duties. But, as all personal rights\r\ndie with the person; and, as the necessary forms of investing a series\r\nof individuals, one after another, with the same identical rights,\r\nwould be very inconvenient, if not impracticable; it has been found\r\nnecessary, when it is for the advantage of the public to have any\r\nparticular rights kept on foot and continued, to constitute artificial\r\npersons, who may maintain a perpetual succession, and enjoy a kind of\r\nlegal immortality.\r\n\r\nTHESE artificial persons are called bodies politic, bodies corporate,\r\n(_corpora corporata_) or corporations: of which there is a great\r\nvariety subsisting, for the advancement of religion, of learning, and\r\nof commerce; in order to preserve entire and for ever those rights and\r\nimmunities, which, if they were granted only to those individuals of\r\nwhich the body corporate is composed, would upon their death be\r\nutterly lost and extinct. To shew the advantages of these\r\nincorporations, let us consider the case of a college in either of our\r\nuniversities, founded _ad studendum et orandum_, for the encouragement\r\nand support of religion and learning. If this was a mere voluntary\r\nassembly, the individuals which compose it might indeed read, pray,\r\nstudy, and perform scholastic exercises together, so long as they\r\ncould agree to do so: but they could neither frame, nor receive, any\r\nlaws or rules of their conduct; none at least, which would have any\r\nbinding force, for want of a coercive power to create a sufficient\r\nobligation. Neither could they be capable of retaining any privileges\r\nor immunities: for, if such privileges be attacked, which of all this\r\nunconnected assembly has the right, or ability, to defend them? And,\r\nwhen they are dispersed by death or otherwise, how shall they transfer\r\nthese advantages to another set of students, equally unconnected as\r\nthemselves? So also, with regard to holding estates or other property,\r\nif land be granted for the purposes of religion or learning to twenty\r\nindividuals not incorporated, there is no legal way of continuing the\r\nproperty to any other persons for the same purposes, but by endless\r\nconveyances from one to the other, as often as the hands are changed.\r\nBut, when they are consolidated and united into a corporation, they\r\nand their successors are then considered as one person in law: as one\r\nperson, they have one will, which is collected from the sense of the\r\nmajority of the individuals: this one will may establish rules and\r\norders for the regulation of the whole, which are a sort of municipal\r\nlaws of this little republic; or rules and statutes may be prescribed\r\nto it at it's creation, which are then in the place of natural laws:\r\nthe privileges and immunities, the estates and possessions, of the\r\ncorporation, when once vested in them, will be for ever vested,\r\nwithout any new conveyance to new successions; for all the individual\r\nmembers that have existed from the foundation to the present time, or\r\nthat shall ever hereafter exist, are but one person in law, a person\r\nthat never dies: in like manner as the river Thames is still the same\r\nriver, though the parts which compose it are changing every instant.\r\n\r\nTHE honour of originally inventing these political constitutions\r\nentirely belongs to the Romans. They were introduced, as Plutarch\r\nsays, by Numa; who finding, upon his accession, the city torn to\r\npieces by the two rival factions of Sabines, and Romans, thought it a\r\nprudent and politic measure, to subdivide these two into many smaller\r\nones, by instituting separate societies of every manual trade and\r\nprofession. They were afterwards much considered by the civil law[a],\r\nin which they were called _universitates_, as forming one whole out of\r\nmany individuals; or _collegia_, from being gathered together: they\r\nwere adopted also by the canon law, for the maintenance of\r\necclesiastical discipline; and from them our spiritual corporations\r\nare derived. But our laws have considerably refined and improved upon\r\nthe invention, according to the usual genius of the English nation:\r\nparticularly with regard to sole corporations, consisting of one\r\nperson only, of which the Roman lawyers had no notion; their maxim\r\nbeing that \"_tres faciunt collegium_[b].\" Though they held, that if a\r\ncorporation, originally consisting of three persons, be reduced to\r\none, \"_si universitas ad unum redit_,\" it may still subsist as a\r\ncorporation, \"_et stet nomen universitatis_[c].\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: _Ff._ _l._ 3. _t._ 4. _per tot._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: _Ff._ 50. 16. 85.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: _Ff._ 3. 4. 7.]\r\n\r\nBEFORE we proceed to treat of the several incidents of corporations,\r\nas regarded by the laws of England, let us first take a view of the\r\nseveral sorts of them; and then we shall be better enabled to\r\napprehend their respective qualities.\r\n\r\nTHE first division of corporations is into _aggregate_ and _sole_.\r\nCorporations aggregate consist of many persons united together into\r\none society, and are kept up by a perpetual succession of members, so\r\nas to continue for ever: of which kind are the mayor and commonalty of\r\na city, the head and fellows of a college, the dean and chapter of a\r\ncathedral church. Corporations sole consist of one person only and his\r\nsuccessors, in some particular station, who are incorporated by law,\r\nin order to give them some legal capacities and advantages,\r\nparticularly that of perpetuity, which in their natural persons they\r\ncould not have had. In this sense the king is a sole corporation[d]:\r\nso is a bishop: so are some deans, and prebendaries, distinct from\r\ntheir several chapters: and so is every parson and vicar. And the\r\nnecessity, or at least use, of this institution will be very apparent,\r\nif we consider the case of a parson of a church. At the original\r\nendowment of parish churches, the freehold of the church, the\r\nchurch-yard, the parsonage house, the glebe, and the tithes of the\r\nparish, were vested in the then parson by the bounty of the donor, as\r\na temporal recompence to him for his spiritual care of the\r\ninhabitants, and with intent that the same emoluments should ever\r\nafterwards continue as a recompense for the same care. But how was\r\nthis to be effected? The freehold was vested in the parson; and, if we\r\nsuppose it vested in his natural capacity, on his death it might\r\ndescend to his heir, and would be liable to his debts and\r\nincumbrances: or, at best, the heir might be compellable, at some\r\ntrouble and expense, to convey these rights to the succeeding\r\nincumbent. The law therefore has wisely ordained, that the parson,\r\n_quatenus_ parson, shall never die, any more than the king; by making\r\nhim and his successors a corporation. By which means all the original\r\nrights of the parsonage are preserved entire to the successor: for the\r\npresent incumbent, and his predecessor who lived seven centuries ago,\r\nare in law one and the same person; and what was given to the one was\r\ngiven to the other also.\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: Co. Litt. 43.]\r\n\r\nANOTHER division of corporations, either sole or aggregate, is into\r\n_ecclesiastical_ and _lay_. Ecclesiastical corporations are where the\r\nmembers that compose it are entirely spiritual persons; such as\r\nbishops; certain deans, and prebendaries; all archdeacons, parsons,\r\nand vicars; which are sole corporations: deans and chapters at\r\npresent, and formerly prior and convent, abbot and monks, and the\r\nlike, bodies aggregate. These are erected for the furtherance of\r\nreligion, and the perpetuating the rights of the church. Lay\r\ncorporations are of two sorts, _civil_ and _eleemosynary_. The civil\r\nare such as are erected for a variety of temporal purposes. The king,\r\nfor instance, is made a corporation to prevent in general the\r\npossibility of an _interregnum_ or vacancy of the throne, and to\r\npreserve the possessions of the crown entire; for, immediately upon\r\nthe demise of one king, his successor is, as we have formerly seen, in\r\nfull possession of the regal rights and dignity. Other lay\r\ncorporations are erected for the good government of a town or\r\nparticular district, as a mayor and commonalty, bailiff and burgesses,\r\nor the like: some for the advancement and regulation of manufactures\r\nand commerce; as the trading companies of London, and other towns: and\r\nsome for the better carrying on of divers special purposes; as\r\nchurchwardens, for conservation of the goods of the parish; the\r\ncollege of physicians and company of surgeons in London, for the\r\nimprovement of the medical science; the royal society, for the\r\nadvancement of natural knowlege; and the society of antiquarians, for\r\npromoting the study of antiquities. And among these I am inclined to\r\nthink the general corporate bodies of the universities of Oxford and\r\nCambridge must be ranked: for it is clear they are not spiritual or\r\necclesiastical corporations, being composed of more laymen than\r\nclergy: neither are they eleemosynary foundations, though stipends are\r\nannexed to particular magistrates and professors, any more than other\r\ncorporations where the acting officers have standing salaries; for\r\nthese are rewards _pro opera et labore_, not charitable donations\r\nonly, since every stipend is preceded by service and duty: they seem\r\ntherefore to be merely civil corporations. The eleemosynary sort are\r\nsuch as are constituted for the perpetual distribution of the free\r\nalms, or bounty, of the founder of them to such persons as he has\r\ndirected. Of this kind are all hospitals for the maintenance of the\r\npoor, sick, and impotent; and all colleges, both _in_ our universities\r\nand _out_[e] of them: which colleges are founded for two purposes; 1.\r\nFor the promotion of piety and learning by proper regulations and\r\nordinances. 2. For imparting assistance to the members of those\r\nbodies, in order to enable them to prosecute their devotion and\r\nstudies with greater ease and assiduity. And all these eleemosynary\r\ncorporations are, strictly speaking, lay and not ecclesiastical, even\r\nthough composed of ecclesiastical persons[f], and although they in\r\nsome things partake of the nature, privileges, and restrictions of\r\necclesiastical bodies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Such as at Manchester, Eton, Winchester, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: 1 Lord Raym. 6.]\r\n\r\nHAVING thus marshalled the several species of corporations, let us\r\nnext proceed to consider, 1. How corporations, in general, may be\r\ncreated. 2. What are their powers, capacities, and incapacities. 3.\r\nHow corporations are visited. And 4. How they may be dissolved.\r\n\r\nI. CORPORATIONS, by the civil law, seem to have been created by the\r\nmere act, and voluntary association of their members; provided such\r\nconvention was not contrary to law, for then it was _illicitum\r\ncollegium_[g]. It does not appear that the prince's consent was\r\nnecessary to be actually given to the foundation of them; but merely\r\nthat the original founders of these voluntary and friendly societies\r\n(for they were little more than such) should not establish any\r\nmeetings in opposition to the laws of the state.\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: _Ff._ 47. 22. 1. _Neque societas, neque collegium, neque\r\nhujusmodi corpus passim omnibus habere conceditur; nam et legibus, et\r\nsenatus consultis, et principalibus constitutionibus ea res\r\ncoercetur._ _Ff._ 3. 4. 1.]\r\n\r\nBUT, with us in England, the king's consent is absolutely necessary to\r\nthe erection of any corporation, either impliedly or expressly given.\r\nThe king's implied consent is to be found in corporations which exist\r\nby force of the _common law_, to which our former kings are supposed\r\nto have given their concurrence; common law being nothing else but\r\ncustom, arising from the universal agreement of the whole community.\r\nOf this sort are the king himself, all bishops, parsons, vicars,\r\nchurchwardens, and some others; who by common law have ever been held\r\n(as far as our books can shew us) to have been corporations, _virtute\r\nofficii_: and this incorporation is so inseparably annexed to their\r\noffices, that we cannot frame a complete legal idea of any of these\r\npersons, but we must also have an idea of a corporation, capable to\r\ntransmit his rights to his successors, at the same time. Another\r\nmethod of implication, whereby the king's consent is presumed, is as\r\nto all corporations by _prescription_, such as the city of London, and\r\nmany others[h], which have existed as corporations, time whereof the\r\nmemory of man runneth not to the contrary; and therefore are looked\r\nupon in law to be well created. For though the members thereof can\r\nshew no legal charter of incorporation, yet in cases of such high\r\nantiquity the law presumes there once was one; and that by the variety\r\nof accidents, which a length of time may produce, the charter is lost\r\nor destroyed. The methods, by which the king's consent is expressly\r\ngiven, are either by act of parliament or charter. By act of\r\nparliament, of which the royal assent is a necessary ingredient,\r\ncorporations may undoubtedly be created[i]: but it is observable, that\r\nmost of those statutes, which are usually cited as having created\r\ncorporations, do either confirm such as have been before created by\r\nthe king; as in the case of the college of physicians, erected by\r\ncharter 10 Hen. VIII[k], which charter was afterwards confirmed in\r\nparliament[l]; or, they permit the king to erect a corporation _in\r\nfuturo_ with such and such powers; as is the case of the bank of\r\nEngland[m], and the society of the British fishery[n]. So that the\r\nimmediate creative act is usually performed by the king alone, in\r\nvirtue of his royal prerogative[o].\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: 2 Inst. 330.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: 10 Rep. 29. 1 Roll. Abr. 512. [Transcriber's Note:\r\nfootnote marker missing in original.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: 8 Rep. 114.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: 14 & 15 Hen. VIII. c. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: Stat. 5 & 6 W. & M. c. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: Stat. 23 Geo. II. c. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: See page 263.]\r\n\r\nALL the other methods therefore whereby corporations exist, by common\r\nlaw, by prescription, and by act of parliament, are for the most part\r\nreducible to this of the king's letters patent, or charter of\r\nincorporation. The king's creation may be performed by the words\r\n\"_creamus, erigimus, fundamus, incorporamus_,\" or the like. Nay it is\r\nheld, that if the king grants to a set of men to have _gildam\r\nmercatoriam_, a mercantile meeting or assembly[p], this is alone\r\nsufficient to incorporate and establish them for ever[q].\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: _Gild_ signified among the Saxons a fraternity, derived\r\nfrom the verb [Anglo-Saxon: gildan] to pay, because every man paid his\r\nshare towards the expenses of the community. And hence their place of\r\nmeeting is frequently called the _Gild-hall_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: 10 Rep. 30. 1 Roll. Abr. 513.]\r\n\r\nTHE parliament, we observed, by it's absolute and transcendent\r\nauthority, may perform this, or any other act whatsoever: and actually\r\ndid perform it to a great extent, by statute 39 Eliz. c. 5. which\r\nincorporated all hospitals and houses of correction founded by\r\ncharitable persons, without farther trouble: and the same has been\r\ndone in other cases of charitable foundations. But otherwise it is not\r\nusual thus to intrench upon the prerogative of the crown, and the king\r\nmay prevent it when he pleases. And, in the particular instance\r\nbefore-mentioned, it was done, as sir Edward Coke observes[r], to\r\navoid the charges of incorporation and licences of mortmain in small\r\nbenefactions; which in his days were grown so great, that it\r\ndiscouraged many men to undertake these pious and charitable works.\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: 2 Inst. 722.]\r\n\r\nTHE king may grant to a subject the power of erecting corporations[s],\r\nthough the contrary was formerly held[t]: that is, he may permit the\r\nsubject to name the persons and powers of the corporation at his\r\npleasure; but it is really the king that erects, and the subject is\r\nbut the instrument: for though none but the king can make a\r\ncorporation, yet _qui facit per alium, facit per se_[v]. In this\r\nmanner the chancellor of the university of Oxford has power by charter\r\nto erect corporations; and has actually often exerted it, in the\r\nerection of several matriculated companies, now subsisting, of\r\ntradesmen subservient to the students.\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: Bro. _Abr. tit. Prerog._ 53. Viner. _Prerog._ 88. pl.\r\n16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: Yearbook, 2 Hen. VII. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote v: 10 Rep. 33.]\r\n\r\nWHEN a corporation is erected, a name must be given it; and by that\r\nname alone it must sue, and be sued, and do all legal acts; though a\r\nvery minute variation therein is not material[u]. Such name is the\r\nvery being of it's constitution; and, though it is the will of the\r\nking that erects the corporation, yet the name is the knot of it's\r\ncombination, without which it could not perform it's corporate\r\nfunctions[w]. The name of incorporation, says sir Edward Coke, is as\r\na proper name, or name of baptism; and therefore when a private\r\nfounder gives his college or hospital a name, he does it only as\r\ngodfather; and by that same name the king baptizes the incorporation[x].\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: 10 Rep. 122. [Transcriber's Note: Footnotes v and u are\r\nin this order in the original.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: Gilb. Hist. C.P. 182.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: 10 Rep. 28.]\r\n\r\nII. AFTER a corporation is so formed and named, it acquires many\r\npowers, rights, capacities, and incapacities, which we are next to\r\nconsider. Some of these are necessarily and inseparably incident to\r\nevery corporation; which incidents, as soon as a corporation is duly\r\nerected, are tacitly annexed of course[y]. As, 1. To have perpetual\r\nsuccession. This is the very end of it's incorporation: for there\r\ncannot be a succession for ever without an incorporation[z]; and\r\ntherefore all aggregate corporations have a power necessarily implied\r\nof electing members in the room of such as go off[a]. 2. To sue or be\r\nsued, implead or be impleaded, grant or receive, by it's corporate\r\nname, and do all other acts as natural persons may. 3. To purchase\r\nlands, and hold them, for the benefit of themselves and their\r\nsuccessors: which two are consequential to the former. 4. To have a\r\ncommon seal. For a corporation, being an invisible body, cannot\r\nmanifest it's intentions by any personal act or oral discourse: it\r\ntherefore acts and speaks only by it's common seal. For, though the\r\nparticular members may express their private consents to any act, by\r\nwords, or signing their names, yet this does not bind the corporation:\r\nit is the fixing of the seal, and that only, which unites the several\r\nassents of the individuals, who compose the community, and makes one\r\njoint assent of the whole[b]. 5. To make by-laws or private statutes\r\nfor the better government of the corporation; which are binding upon\r\nthemselves, unless contrary to the laws of the land, and then they are\r\nvoid. This is also included by law in the very act of incorporation[c]:\r\nfor, as natural reason is given to the natural body for the governing\r\nit, so by-laws or statutes are a sort of political reason to govern\r\nthe body politic. And this right of making by-laws for their own\r\ngovernment, not contrary to the law of the land, was allowed by the\r\nlaw of the twelve tables at Rome[d]. But no trading company is, with\r\nus, allowed to make by-laws, which may affect the king's prerogative,\r\nor the common profit of the people, unless they be approved by the\r\nchancellor, treasurer, and chief justices, or the judges of assise in\r\ntheir circuits[e]. These five powers are inseparably incident to every\r\ncorporation, at least to every corporation _aggregate_: for two of\r\nthem, though they may be practised, yet are very unnecessary to a\r\ncorporation _sole_; viz. to have a corporate seal to testify his sole\r\nassent, and to make statutes for the regulation of his own conduct.\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: 10 Rep. 30. Hob. 211.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: 10 Rep. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: 1 Roll. Abr. 514.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: Dav. 44. 48.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Hob. 211.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: _Sodales legem quam volent, dum ne quid ex publica lege\r\ncorrumpant, sibi ferunto._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Stat. 19 Hen. VII. c. 7.]\r\n\r\nTHERE are also certain privileges and disabilities that attend an\r\naggregate corporation, and are not applicable to such as are sole; the\r\nreason of them ceasing, and of course the law. It must always appear\r\nby attorney; for it cannot appear in person, being, as sir Edward Coke\r\nsays[f], invisible, and existing only in intendment and consideration\r\nof law. It can neither maintain, or be made defendant to, an action of\r\nbattery or such like personal injuries; for a corporation can neither\r\nbeat, nor be beaten, in it's body politic[g]. A corporation cannot\r\ncommit treason, or felony, or other crime, in it's corporate\r\ncapacity[h]: though it's members may, in their distinct individual\r\ncapacities. Neither is it capable of suffering a traitor's, or felon's\r\npunishment, for it is not liable to corporal penalties, nor to\r\nattainder, forfeiture, or corruption of blood[i]. It cannot be\r\nexecutor or administrator, or perform any personal duties; for it\r\ncannot take an oath for the due execution of the office. It cannot be\r\na trustee; for such kind of confidence is foreign to the ends of it's\r\ninstitution: neither can it be compelled to perform such trust,\r\nbecause it cannot be committed to prison[k]; for it's existence being\r\nideal, no man can apprehend or arrest it. And therefore also it cannot\r\nbe outlawed; for outlawry always supposes a precedent right of\r\narresting, which has been defeated by the parties absconding, and that\r\nalso a corporation cannot do: for which reasons the proceedings to\r\ncompel a corporation to appear to any suit by attorney are always by\r\ndistress on their lands and goods[l]. Neither can a corporation be\r\nexcommunicated; for it has no soul, as is gravely observed by sir\r\nEdward Coke[m]: and therefore also it is not liable to be summoned\r\ninto the ecclesiastical courts upon any account; for those courts act\r\nonly _pro salute animae_, and their sentences can only be inforced by\r\nspiritual censures: a consideration, which, carried to it's full\r\nextent, would alone demonstrate the impropriety of these courts\r\ninterfering in any temporal rights whatsoever.\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: 10 Rep. 32.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Bro. _Abr. tit. Corporation._ 63.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: 10 Rep. 32.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: The civil law also ordains that, in any misbehaviour of a\r\nbody corporate, the directors only shall be answerable in their\r\npersonal capacity, and not the corporation. _Ff._ 4. 3. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Plowd. 538.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: Bro. _Abr. tit. Corporation._ 11. _Outlawry._ 72.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: 10 Rep. 32.]\r\n\r\nTHERE are also other incidents and powers, which belong to some sort\r\nof corporations, and not to others. An aggregate corporation may take\r\ngoods and chattels for the benefit of themselves and their successors,\r\nbut a sole corporation cannot[n]: for such moveable property is liable\r\nto be lost or imbezzled, and would raise a multitude of disputes\r\nbetween the successor and executor; which the law is careful to avoid.\r\nIn ecclesiastical and eleemosynary foundations, the king or the\r\nfounder may give them rules, laws, statutes, and ordinances, which\r\nthey are bound to observe: but corporations merely lay, constituted\r\nfor civil purposes, are subject to no particular statutes; but to the\r\ncommon law, and to their own by-laws, not contrary to the laws of the\r\nrealm[o]. Aggregate corporations also, that have by their constitution\r\na head, as a dean, warden, master, or the like, cannot do any acts\r\nduring the vacancy of the headship, except only appointing another:\r\nneither are they then capable of receiving a grant; for such\r\ncorporation is incomplete without a head[p]. But there may be a\r\ncorporation aggregate constituted without a head[q]: as the\r\ncollegiate church of Southwell in Nottinghamshire, which consists only\r\nof prebendaries; and the governors of the Charter-house, London, who\r\nhave no president or superior, but are all of equal authority. In\r\naggregate corporations also, the act of the major part is esteemed the\r\nact of the whole[r]. By the civil law this major part must have\r\nconsisted of two thirds of the whole; else no act could be\r\nperformed[s]: which perhaps may be one reason why they required three\r\nat least to make a corporation. But, with us, _any_ majority is\r\nsufficient to determine the act of the whole body. And whereas,\r\nnotwithstanding the law stood thus, some founders of corporations had\r\nmade statutes in derogation of the common law, making very frequently\r\nthe unanimous assent of the society to be necessary to any corporate\r\nact; (which king Henry VIII found to be a great obstruction to his\r\nprojected scheme of obtaining a surrender of the lands of\r\necclesiastical corporations) it was therefore enacted by statute 33\r\nHen. VIII. c. 27. that all private statutes shall be utterly void,\r\nwhereby any grant or election, made by the head, with the concurrence\r\nof the major part of the body, is liable to be obstructed by any one\r\nor more, being the minority: but this statute extends not to any\r\nnegative or necessary voice, given by the founder to the head of any\r\nsuch society.\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: Co. Litt. 46.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: Lord Raym. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote p: Co. Litt. 263, 264.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote q: 10 Rep. 30.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote r: Bro. _Abr. tit. Corporation._ 31, 34.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote s: _Ff._ 3. 4. 3.]\r\n\r\nWE before observed that it was incident to every corporation, to have\r\na capacity to purchase lands for themselves and successors: and this\r\nis regularly true at the common law[t]. But they are excepted out of\r\nthe statute of wills[u]; so that no devise of lands to a corporation\r\nby will is good: except for charitable uses, by statute 43 Eliz. c.\r\n4[w]. And also, by a great variety of statutes[x], their privilege\r\neven of purchasing from any living grantor is greatly abridged; so\r\nthat now a corporation, either ecclesiastical or lay, must have a\r\nlicence from the king to purchase[y], before they can exert that\r\ncapacity which is vested in them by the common law: nor is even this\r\nin all cases sufficient. These statutes are generally called the\r\nstatutes of _mortmain_; all purchases made by corporate bodies being\r\nsaid to be purchases in mortmain, _in mortua manu_: for the reason of\r\nwhich appellation sir Edward Coke[z] offers many conjectures; but\r\nthere is one which seems more probable than any that he has given us:\r\nviz. that these purchases being usually made by ecclesiastical bodies,\r\nthe members of which (being professed) were reckoned dead persons in\r\nlaw, land therefore, holden by them, might with great propriety be\r\nsaid to be held _in mortua manu_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote t: 10 Rep. 30.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote u: 34 Hen. VIII. c. 5.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote w: Hob. 136.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote x: From _magna carta_, 9 Hen. III. c. 36. to 9 Geo. II. c.\r\n36.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote y: By the civil law a corporation was incapable of taking\r\nlands, unless by special privilege from the emperor: _collegium, si\r\nnullo speciali privilegio subnixum fit, haereditatem capere non posse,\r\ndubium non est_. _Cod._ 6. 24. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote z: 1 Inst. 2.]\r\n\r\nI SHALL defer the more particular exposition of these statutes of\r\nmortmain, till the next book of these commentaries, when we shall\r\nconsider the nature and tenures of estates; and also the exposition of\r\nthose disabling statutes of queen Elizabeth, which restrain spiritual\r\nand eleemosynary corporations from aliening such lands as they are\r\npresent in legal possession of: only mentioning them in this place,\r\nfor the sake of regularity, as statutable incapacities incident and\r\nrelative to corporations.\r\n\r\nTHE general _duties_ of all bodies politic, considered in their\r\ncorporate capacity, may, like those of natural persons, be reduced to\r\nthis single one; that of acting up to the end or design, whatever it\r\nbe, for which they were created by their founder.\r\n\r\nIII. I PROCEED therefore next to enquire, how these corporations may\r\nbe _visited_. For corporations being composed of individuals, subject\r\nto human frailties, are liable, as well as private persons, to deviate\r\nfrom the end of their institution. And for that reason the law has\r\nprovided proper persons to visit, enquire into, and correct all\r\nirregularities that arise in such corporations, either sole or\r\naggregate, and whether ecclesiastical, civil, or eleemosynary. With\r\nregard to all ecclesiastical corporations, the ordinary is their\r\nvisitor, so constituted by the canon law, and from thence derived to\r\nus. The pope formerly, and now the king, as supreme ordinary, is the\r\nvisitor of the arch-bishop or metropolitan; the metropolitan has the\r\ncharge and coercion of all his suffragan bishops; and the bishops in\r\ntheir several dioceses are the visitors of all deans and chapters, of\r\nall parsons and vicars, and of all other spiritual corporations. With\r\nrespect to all lay corporations, the founder, his heirs, or assigns,\r\nare the visitors, whether the foundation be civil or eleemosynary; for\r\nin a lay incorporation the ordinary neither can nor ought to visit[a].\r\n\r\n[Footnote a: 10 Rep. 31.]\r\n\r\nI KNOW it is generally said, that civil corporations are subject to no\r\nvisitation, but merely to the common law of the land; and this shall\r\nbe presently explained. But first, as I have laid it down as a rule\r\nthat the founder, his heirs, or assigns, are the visitors of all\r\nlay-corporations, let us enquire what is meant by the _founder_. The\r\nfounder of all corporations in the strictest and original sense is the\r\nking alone, for he only can incorporate a society: and in civil\r\nincorporations, such as mayor and commonalty, &c, where there are no\r\npossessions or endowments given to the body, there is no other founder\r\nbut the king: but in eleemosynary foundations, such as colleges and\r\nhospitals, where there is an endowment of lands, the law\r\ndistinguishes, and makes two species of foundation; the one _fundatio\r\nincipiens_, or the incorporation, in which sense the king is the\r\ngeneral founder of all colleges and hospitals; the other _fundatio\r\nperficiens_, or the dotation of it, in which sense the first gift of\r\nthe revenues is the foundation, and he who gives them is in law the\r\nfounder: and it is in this last sense that we generally call a man the\r\nfounder of a college or hospital[b]. But here the king has his\r\nprerogative: for, if the king and a private man join in endowing an\r\neleemosynary foundation, the king alone shall be the founder of it.\r\nAnd, in general, the king being the sole founder of all civil\r\ncorporations, and the endower the perficient founder of all\r\neleemosynary ones, the right of visitation of the former results,\r\naccording to the rule laid down, to the king; and of the latter, to\r\nthe patron or endower.\r\n\r\n[Footnote b: 10 Rep. 33.]\r\n\r\nTHE king being thus constituted by law the visitor of all civil\r\ncorporations, the law has also appointed the place, wherein he shall\r\nexercise this jurisdiction: which is the court of king's bench; where,\r\nand where only, all misbehaviours of this kind of corporations are\r\nenquired into and redressed, and all their controversies decided. And\r\nthis is what I understand to be the meaning of our lawyers, when they\r\nsay that these civil corporations are liable to no visitation; that\r\nis, that the law having by immemorial usage appointed them to be\r\nvisited and inspected by the king their founder, in his majesty's\r\ncourt of king's bench, according to the rules of the common law, they\r\nought not to be visited elsewhere, or by any other authority. And this\r\nis so strictly true, that though the king by his letters patent had\r\nsubjected the college of physicians to the visitation of four very\r\nrespectable persons, the lord chancellor, the two chief justices, and\r\nthe chief baron; though the college had accepted this charter with all\r\npossible marks of acquiescence, and had acted under it for near a\r\ncentury; yet, in 1753, the authority of this provision coming in\r\ndispute, on an appeal preferred to these supposed visitors, they\r\ndirected the legality of their own appointment to be argued: and, as\r\nthis college was a mere civil, and not an eleemosynary foundation,\r\nthey at length determined, upon several days solemn debate, that they\r\nhad no jurisdiction as visitors; and remitted the appellant (if\r\naggrieved) to his regular remedy in his majesty's court of king's\r\nbench.\r\n\r\nAS to eleemosynary corporations, by the dotation the founder and his\r\nheirs are of common right the legal visitors, to see that that\r\nproperty is rightly employed, which would otherwise have descended to\r\nthe visitor himself: but, if the founder has appointed and assigned\r\nany other person to be visitor, then his assignee so appointed is\r\ninvested with all the founder's power, in exclusion of his heir.\r\nEleemosynary corporations are chiefly hospitals, or colleges in the\r\nuniversity. These were all of them considered by the popish clergy, as\r\nof mere ecclesiastical jurisdiction: however, the law of the land\r\njudged otherwise; and, with regard to hospitals, it has long been\r\nheld[c], that if the hospital be spiritual, the bishop shall visit;\r\nbut if lay, the patron. This right of lay patrons was indeed abridged\r\nby statute 2 Hen. V. c. 1. which ordained, that the ordinary should\r\nvisit _all_ hospitals founded by subjects; though the king's right was\r\nreserved, to visit by his commissioners such as were of royal\r\nfoundation. But the subject's right was in part restored by statute 14\r\nEliz. c. 5. which directs the bishop to visit such hospitals only,\r\nwhere no visitor is appointed by the founders thereof: and all the\r\nhospitals founded by virtue of the statute 39 Eliz. c. 5. are to be\r\nvisited by such persons as shall be nominated by the respective\r\nfounders. But still, if the founder appoints nobody, the bishop of the\r\ndiocese must visit[d].\r\n\r\n[Footnote c: Yearbook, 8 Edw. III. 28. 8 Aff. 29.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote d: 2 Inst. 725.]\r\n\r\nCOLLEGES in the universities (whatever the common law may now, or\r\nmight formerly, judge) were certainly considered by the popish clergy,\r\nunder whose direction they were, as _ecclesiastical_, or at least as\r\n_clerical_, corporations; and therefore the right of visitation was\r\nclaimed by the ordinary of the diocese. This is evident, because in\r\nmany of our most ancient colleges, where the founder had a mind to\r\nsubject them to a visitor of his own nomination, he obtained for that\r\npurpose a papal bulle to exempt them from the jurisdiction of the\r\nordinary; several of which are still preserved in the archives of the\r\nrespective societies. And I have reason to believe, that in one of our\r\ncolleges, (wherein the bishop of that diocese, in which Oxford was\r\nformerly comprized, has immemorially exercised visitatorial authority)\r\nthere is no special visitor appointed by the college statutes: so that\r\nthe bishop's interposition can be ascribed to nothing else, but his\r\nsupposed title as ordinary to visit this, among other ecclesiastical\r\nfoundations. And it is not impossible, that the number of colleges in\r\nCambridge, which are visited by the bishop of Ely, may in part be\r\nderived from the same original.\r\n\r\nBUT, whatever might be formerly the opinion of the clergy, it is now\r\nheld as established common law, that colleges are lay-corporations,\r\nthough sometimes totally composed of ecclesiastical persons; and that\r\nthe right of visitation does not arise from any principles of the\r\ncanon law, but of necessity was created by the common law[e]. And yet\r\nthe power and jurisdiction of visitors in colleges was left so much in\r\nthe dark at common law, that the whole doctrine was very unsettled\r\ntill king William's time; in the sixth year of whose reign, the famous\r\ncase of _Philips and Bury_ happened[f]. In this the main question was,\r\nwhether the sentence of the bishop of Exeter, who (as visitor) had\r\ndeprived doctor Bury the rector of Exeter college, could be examined\r\nand redressed by the court of king's bench. And the three puisne\r\njudges were of opinion, that it might be reviewed, for that the\r\nvisitor's jurisdiction could not exclude the common law; and\r\naccordingly judgment was given in that court. But the lord chief\r\njustice, Holt, was of a contrary opinion; and held, that by the common\r\nlaw the office of visitor is to judge according to the statutes of the\r\ncollege, and to expel and deprive upon just occasions, and to hear all\r\nappeals of course; and that from him, and him only, the party grieved\r\nought to have redress; the founder having reposed in him so entire a\r\nconfidence, that he will administer justice impartially, that his\r\ndeterminations are final, and examinable in no other court whatsoever.\r\nAnd, upon this, a writ of error being brought in the house of lords,\r\nthey reversed the judgment of the court of king's bench, and concurred\r\nin sir John Holt's opinion. And to this leading case all subsequent\r\ndeterminations have been conformable. But, where the visitor is under\r\na temporary disability, there the court of king's bench will\r\ninterpose, to prevent a defect of justice. Thus the bishop of Chester\r\nis visitor of Manchester college: but, happening also to be warden,\r\nthe court held that his power was suspended during the union of those\r\noffices; and therefore issued a peremptory _mandamus_ to him, as\r\nwarden, to admit a person intitled to a chaplainship[g]. Also it is\r\nsaid[h], that if a founder of an eleemosynary foundation appoints a\r\nvisitor, and limits his jurisdiction by rules and statutes, if the\r\nvisitor in his sentence exceeds those rules, an action lies against\r\nhim; but it is otherwise, where he mistakes in a thing within his\r\npower.\r\n\r\n[Footnote e: Lord Raym. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote f: Lord Raym. 5. 4 Mod. 106. Shower. 35. Skinn. 407. Salk.\r\n403. Carthew. 180.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote g: Stra. 797.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote h: 2 Lutw. 1566.]\r\n\r\nIV. WE come now, in the last place, to consider how corporations may\r\nbe dissolved. Any particular member may be disfranchised, or lose his\r\nplace in the corporation, by acting contrary to the laws of the\r\nsociety, or the laws of the land; or he may resign it by his own\r\nvoluntary act[i]. But the body politic may also itself be dissolved in\r\nseveral ways; which dissolution is the civil death of the corporation:\r\nand in this case their lands and tenements shall revert to the person,\r\nor his heirs, who granted them to the corporation; for the law doth\r\nannex a condition to every such grant, that if the corporation be\r\ndissolved, the grantor shall have the lands again, because the cause\r\nof the grant faileth[k]. The grant is indeed only during the life of\r\nthe corporation; which _may_ endure for ever: but, when that life is\r\ndetermined by the dissolution of the body politic, the grantor takes\r\nit back by reversion, as in the case of every other grant for life.\r\nAnd hence it appears how injurious, as well to private as public\r\nrights, those statutes were, which vested in king Henry VIII, instead\r\nof the heirs of the founder, the lands of the dissolved monasteries.\r\nThe debts of a corporation, either to or from it, are totally\r\nextinguished by it's dissolution; so that the members thereof cannot\r\nrecover, or be charged with them, in their natural capacities[l]:\r\nagreeable to that maxim of the civil law[m], \"_si quid universitati\r\ndebetur, singulis non debetur; nec, quod debet universitas, singuli\r\ndebent_.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote i: 11 Rep. 98.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote k: Co. Litt. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote l: 1 Lev. 237.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote m: _Ff._ 3. 4. 7.]\r\n\r\nA CORPORATION may be dissolved, 1. By act of parliament, which is\r\nboundless in it's operations; 2. By the natural death of all it's\r\nmembers, in case of an aggregate corporation; 3. By surrender of it's\r\nfranchises into the hands of the king, which is a kind of suicide; 4.\r\nBy forfeiture of it's charter, through negligence or abuse of it's\r\nfranchises; in which case the law judges that the body politic has\r\nbroken the condition upon which it was incorporated, and thereupon the\r\nincorporation is void. And the regular course is to bring a writ of\r\n_quo warranto_, to enquire by what warrant the members now exercise\r\ntheir corporate power, having forfeited it by such and such\r\nproceedings. The exertion of this act of law, for the purposes of the\r\nstate, in the reigns of king Charles and king James the second,\r\nparticularly by seising the charter of the city of London, gave great\r\nand just offence; though perhaps, in strictness of law, the\r\nproceedings were sufficiently regular: but now[n] it is enacted, that\r\nthe charter of the city of London shall never more be forfeited for\r\nany cause whatsoever. And, because by the common law corporations were\r\ndissolved, in case the mayor or head officer was not duly elected on\r\nthe day appointed in the charter or established by prescription, it is\r\nnow provided[o], that for the future no corporation shall be dissolved\r\nupon that account; and ample directions are given for appointing a new\r\nofficer, in case there be no election, or a void one, made upon the\r\ncharter or prescriptive day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote n: Stat. 2 W. & M. c. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote o: Stat. 11 Geo.
