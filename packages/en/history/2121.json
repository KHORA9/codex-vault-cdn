OF PRUSSIA\r\n\r\nFREDERICK THE GREAT\r\n\r\nBy Thomas Carlyle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK XXI.--AFTERNOON AND EVENING OF FRIEDRICH'S LIFE--1763-1786.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter I.--PREFATORY.\r\n\r\nThe Twelve Hercules-labors of this King have ended here; what was\r\nrequired of him in World-History is accomplished. There remain to\r\nFriedrich Twenty-three Years more of Life, which to Prussian History are\r\nas full of importance as ever; but do not essentially concern European\r\nHistory, Europe having gone the road we now see it in. On the grand\r\nWorld-Theatre the curtain has fallen for a New Act; Friedrich's part,\r\nlike everybody's for the present, is played out. In fact, there is,\r\nduring the rest of his Reign, nothing of World-History to be dwelt on\r\nanywhere. America, it has been decided, shall be English; Prussia be a\r\nNation. The French, as finis of their attempt to cut Germany in Four,\r\nfind themselves sunk into torpor, abeyance and dry-rot; fermenting\r\ntowards they know not what. Towards Spontaneous Combustion in the year\r\n1789, and for long years onwards!\r\n\r\nThere, readers, there is the next milestone for you, in the History of\r\nMankind! That universal Burning-up, as in hell-fire, of Human Shams. The\r\noath of Twenty-five Million men, which has since become that of all men\r\nwhatsoever, \"Rather than live longer under lies, we will die!\"--that\r\nis the New Act in World-History. New Act,--or, we may call it New PART;\r\nDrama of World-History, Part Third. If Part SECOND was 1,800 years ago,\r\nthis I reckon will be Part THIRD. This is the truly celestial-infernal\r\nEvent: the strangest we have seen for a thousand years. Celestial in\r\none part; in the other, infernal. For it is withal the breaking out\r\nof universal mankind into Anarchy, into the faith and practice\r\nof NO-Government,--that is to say (if you will be candid), into\r\nunappeasable Revolt against Sham-Governors and Sham-Teachers,--which\r\nI do charitably define to be a Search, most unconscious, yet in deadly\r\nearnest, for true Governors and Teachers. That is the one fact of\r\nWorld-History worth dwelling on at this day; and Friedrich cannot be\r\nsaid to have had much hand farther in that.\r\n\r\nNor is the progress of a French or European world, all silently ripening\r\nand rotting towards such issue, a thing one wishes to dwell on. Only\r\nwhen the Spontaneous Combustion breaks out; and, many-colored, with loud\r\nnoises, envelops the whole world in anarchic flame for long hundreds of\r\nyears: then has the Event come; there is the thing for all men to\r\nmark, and to study and scrutinize as the strangest thing they ever saw.\r\nCenturies of it yet lying ahead of us; several sad Centuries, sordidly\r\ntumultuous, and good for little! Say Two Centuries yet,--say even Ten of\r\nsuch a process: before the Old is completely burnt out, and the New in\r\nany state of sightliness? Millennium of Anarchies;--abridge it, spend\r\nyour heart's-blood upon abridging it, ye Heroic Wise that are to\r\ncome! For it is the consummation of All the Anarchies that are and\r\nwere;--which I do trust always means the death (temporary death) of\r\nthem! Death of the Anarchies: or a world once more built wholly on Fact\r\nbetter or worse; and the lying jargoning professor of Sham-Fact, whose\r\nname is Legion, who as yet (oftenest little conscious of himself) goes\r\ntumulting and swarming from shore to shore, become a species extinct,\r\nand well known to be gone down to Tophet!--\r\n\r\nThere were bits of Anarchies before, little and greater: but till that\r\nof France in 1789, there was none long memorable; all were pygmies in\r\ncomparison, and not worth mentioning separately. In 1772 the Anarchy of\r\nPoland, which had been a considerable Anarchy for about three\r\nhundred years, got itself extinguished,--what we may call\r\nextinguished;--decisive surgery being then first exercised upon it: an\r\nAnarchy put in the sure way of extinction. In 1775, again, there began,\r\nover seas, another Anarchy much more considerable,--little dreaming that\r\nIT could be called an Anarchy; on the contrary, calling itself Liberty,\r\nRights of Man; and singing boundless Io-Paeans to itself, as is common\r\nin such cases; an Anarchy which has been challenging the Universe\r\nto show the like ever since. And which has, at last, flamed up as an\r\nindependent Phenomenon, unexampled in the hideously SUICIDAL way;--and\r\ndoes need much to get burnt out, that matters may begin anew on truer\r\nconditions. But neither the PARTITION OF POLAND nor the AMERICAN WAR OF\r\nINDEPENDENCE have much general importance, or, except as precursors\r\nof 1789, are worth dwelling on in History. From us here, so far as\r\nFriedrich is concerned with them, they may deserve some transient\r\nmention, more or less: but World-History, eager to be at the general\r\nFuneral-pile and ultimate Burning-up of Shams in this poor World, will\r\nhave less and less to say of small tragedies and premonitory symptoms.\r\n\r\nCurious how the busy and continually watchful and speculating Friedrich,\r\nbusied about his dangers from Austrian encroachments, from Russian-Turk\r\nWars, Bavarian Successions, and other troubles and anarchies close\r\nby, saw nothing to dread in France; nothing to remark there, except\r\ncarelessly, from time to time, its beggarly decaying condition, so\r\nstrangely sunk in arts, in arms, in finance; oftenest an object of pity\r\nto him, for he still has a love for France;--and reads not the least\r\nsign of that immeasurable, all-engulfing FRENCH REVOLUTION which was in\r\nthe wind! Neither Voltaire nor he have the least anticipation of such a\r\nthing. Voltaire and he see, to their contentment, Superstition\r\nvisibly declining: Friedrich rather disapproves the heat of Voltaire's\r\nprocedures on the INFAME. \"Why be in such heat? Other nonsense, quite\r\nequal to it, will be almost sure to follow. Take care of your own skin!\"\r\nVoltaire and he are deeply alive, especially Voltaire is, to the\r\nhorrors and miseries which have issued on mankind from a Fanatic Popish\r\nSuperstition, or Creed of Incredibilities,--which (except from the\r\nthroat outwards, from the bewildered tongue outwards) the orthodox\r\nthemselves cannot believe, but only pretend and struggle to believe.\r\nThis Voltaire calls \"THE INFAMOUS;\" and this--what name can any of us\r\ngive it? The man who believes in falsities is very miserable. The man\r\nwho cannot believe them, but only struggles and pretends to believe;\r\nand yet, being armed with the power of the sword, industriously keeps\r\nmenacing and slashing all round, to compel every neighbor to do like\r\nhim: what is to be done with such a man? Human Nature calls him a Social\r\nNuisance; needing to be handcuffed, gagged and abated. Human Nature, if\r\nit be in a terrified and imperilled state, with the sword of this fellow\r\nswashing round it, calls him \"Infamous,\" and a Monster of Chaos. He\r\nis indeed the select Monster of that region; the Patriarch of all the\r\nMonsters, little as he dreams of being such. An Angel of Heaven the poor\r\ncaitiff dreams himself rather, and in cheery moments is conscious of\r\nbeing:--Bedlam holds in it no madder article. And I often think he will\r\nagain need to be tied up (feeble as he now is in comparison, disinclined\r\nthough men are to manacling and tying); so many helpless infirm souls\r\nare wandering about, not knowing their right hand from their left, who\r\nfall a prey to him. \"L'INFAME\" I also name him,--knowing well enough how\r\nlittle he, in his poor muddled, drugged and stupefied mind, is conscious\r\nof deserving that name. More signal enemy to God, and friend of the\r\nOther Party, walks not the Earth in our day.\r\n\r\nAnarchy in the shape of religious slavery was what Voltaire and\r\nFriedrich saw all round them. Anarchy in the shape of Revolt against\r\nAuthorities was what Friedrich and Voltaire had never dreamed of as\r\npossible, and had not in their minds the least idea of. In one, or\r\nperhaps two places you may find in Voltaire a grim and rather glad\r\nforethought, not given out as prophecy, but felt as interior assurance\r\nin a moment of hope, How these Priestly Sham Hierarchies will be pulled\r\nto pieces, probably on the sudden, once people are awake to them. Yes,\r\nmy much-suffering M. de Voltaire, be pulled to pieces; or go aloft,\r\nlike the awakening of Vesuvius, one day,--Vesuvius awakening after\r\nten centuries of slumber, when his crater is all grown grassy, bushy,\r\ncopiously \"tenanted by wolves\" I am told; which, after premonitory\r\ngrumblings, heeded by no wolf or bush, he will hurl bodily aloft, ten\r\nacres at a time, in a very tremendous manner! [First modern Eruption of\r\nVesuvius, A.D. 1631, after long interval of rest.] A thought like this,\r\nabout the Priestly Sham-Hierarchies, I have found somewhere in Voltaire:\r\nbut of the Social and Civic Sham-Hierarchies (which are likewise\r\naccursed, if they knew it, and indeed are junior co-partners of the\r\nPriestly; and, in a sense, sons and products of them, and cannot escape\r\nbeing partakers of their plagues), there is no hint, in Voltaire, though\r\nVoltaire stood at last only fifteen years from the Fact (1778-1793); nor\r\nin Friedrich, though he lived almost to see the Fact beginning.\r\n\r\nFriedrich's History being henceforth that of a Prussian King, is\r\ninteresting to Prussia chiefly, and to us little otherwise than as the\r\nBiography of a distinguished fellow-man, Friedrich's Biography, his\r\nPhysiognomy as he grows old, quietly on his own harvest-field, among his\r\nown People: this has still an interest, and for any feature of this we\r\nshall be eager enough; but this withal is the most of what we now want.\r\nAnd not very much even of this; Friedrich the unique King not having\r\nas a man any such depth and singularity, tragic, humorous, devotionally\r\npious, or other, as to authorize much painting in that aspect. Extreme\r\nbrevity beseems us in these circumstances: and indeed there are,--as has\r\nalready happened in different parts of this Enterprise (Nature\r\nherself, in her silent way, being always something of an Artist in such\r\nthings),--other circumstances, which leave us no choice as to that of\r\ndetail. Available details, if we wished to give them, of Friedrich's\r\nlater Life, are not forthcoming: masses of incondite marine-stores,\r\ntumbled out on you, dry rubbish shot with uncommon diligence for a\r\nhundred years, till, for Rubbish-Pelion piled on Rubbish-Ossa, you lose\r\nsight of the stars and azimuths; whole mountain continents, seemingly\r\nall of cinders and sweepings (though fragments and remnants do lie\r\nhidden, could you find them again):---these are not details that will be\r\navailable! Anecdotes there are in quantity; but of uncertain quality;\r\nof doubtful authenticity, above all. One recollects hardly any\r\nAnecdote whatever that seems completely credible, or renders to us the\r\nPhysiognomy of Friedrich in a convincing manner. So remiss a creature\r\nhas the Prussian Clio been,--employed on all kinds of loose errands over\r\nthe Earth and the Air; and as good as altogether negligent of this most\r\npressing errand in her own House. Peace be with her, poor slut;\r\nwhy should we say one other hard word on taking leave of her to all\r\neternity!--\r\n\r\nThe Practical fact is, what we have henceforth to produce is more of\r\nthe nature of a loose Appendix of Papers, than of a finished Narrative.\r\nLoose Papers,--which, we will hope, the reader can, by industry, be made\r\nto understand and tolerate: more we cannot do for him. No continuous\r\nNarrative is henceforth possible to us. For the sake of Friedrich's\r\nclosing Epoch, we will visit, for the last time, that dreary imbroglio\r\nunder which the memory of Friedrich, which ought to have been, in all\r\nthe epochs of it, bright and legible, lies buried; and will try to\r\ngather, as heretofore, and put under labels. What dwells with oneself\r\nas human may have some chance to be humanly interesting. In the wildest\r\nchaos of marine-stores and editorial shortcomings (provided only the\r\neditors speak truth, as these poor fellows do) THIS can be done.\r\nPart the living from the dead; pick out what has some meaning, leave\r\ncarefully what has none; you will in some small measure pluck up the\r\nmemory of a hero, like drowned honor by the locks, and rescue it, into\r\nvisibility.\r\n\r\nThat Friedrich, on reaching home, made haste to get out, of the bustle\r\nof joyances and exclamations on the streets; proceeded straight to his\r\nmusic-chapel in Charlottenburg, summoning the Artists, or having them\r\nalready summoned; and had there, all alone, sitting invisible wrapt in\r\nhis cloak, Graun's or somebody's grand TE-DEUM pealed out to him, in\r\nseas of melody,--soothing and salutary to the altered soul, revolving\r\nmany things,--is a popular myth, of pretty and appropriate character;\r\nbut a myth only, with no real foundation, though it has some loose\r\nand apparent. [In PREUSS, ii. 46, all the details of it.] No doubt,\r\nFriedrich had his own thoughts on entering Berlin again, after such\r\na voyage through the deeps; himself, his Country still here, though\r\nsolitary and in a world of wild shipwrecks. He was not without piety;\r\nbut it did not take the devotional form, and his habits had nothing of\r\nthe clerical.\r\n\r\nWhat is perfectly known, and much better worth knowing, is the\r\ninstantaneous practical alacrity with which he set about repairing that\r\nimmense miscellany of ruin; and the surprising success he had in dealing\r\nwith it. His methods, his rapid inventions and procedures, in this\r\nmatter, are still memorable to Prussia; and perhaps might with advantage\r\nbe better known than they are in some other Countries. To us, what is\r\nall we can do with them here, they will indicate that this is still the\r\nold Friedrich, with his old activities and promptitudes; which indeed\r\ncontinue unabated, lively in Peace as in War, to the end of his life and\r\nreign.\r\n\r\nThe speed with which Prussia recovered was extraordinary. Within little\r\nmore than a year (June 1st, 1764), the Coin was all in order again; in\r\n1765, the King had rebuilt, not to mention other things, \"in Silesia\r\n8,000 Houses, in Pommern 6,500.\" [Rodenbeck, ii. 234, 261.] Prussia has\r\nbeen a meritorious Nation; and, however cut and ruined, is and was in a\r\nhealthy state, capable of recovering soon. Prussia has defended itself\r\nagainst overwhelming odds,--brave Prussia; but the real soul of its\r\nmerit was that of having merited such a King to command it. Without this\r\nKing, all its valors, disciplines, resources of war, would have availed\r\nPrussia little. No wonder Prussia has still a loyalty to its great\r\nFriedrich, to its Hohenzollern Sovereigns generally. Without these\r\nHohenzollerns, Prussia had been, what we long ago saw it, the unluckiest\r\nof German Provinces; and could never have had the pretension to exist\r\nas a Nation at all. Without this particular Hohenzollern, it had been\r\ntrampled out again, after apparently succeeding. To have achieved a\r\nFriedrich the Second for King over it, was Prussia's grand merit.\r\n\r\nAn accidental merit, thinks the reader? No, reader, you may believe me,\r\nit is by no means altogether such. Nay, I rather think, could we look\r\ninto the Account-Books of the Recording Angel for a course of centuries,\r\nno part of it is such! There are Nations in which a Friedrich is, or can\r\nbe, possible; and again there are Nations in which he is not and\r\ncannot. To be practically reverent of Human Worth to the due extent,\r\nand abhorrent of Human Want of Worth in the like proportion, do\r\nyou understand that art at all? I fear, not,--or that you are much\r\nforgetting it again! Human Merit, do you really love it enough, think\r\nyou;--human Scoundrelism (brought to the dock for you, and branded as\r\nscoundrel), do you even abhor it enough? Without that reverence and\r\nits corresponding opposite-pole of abhorrence, there is simply no\r\npossibility left. That, my friend, is the outcome and summary of all\r\nvirtues in this world, for a man or for a Nation of men. It is the\r\nsupreme strength and glory of a Nation;--without which, indeed, all\r\nother strengths, and enormities of bullion and arsenals and warehouses,\r\nare no strength. None, I should say;--and are oftenest even the REVERSE.\r\n\r\nNations who have lost this quality, or who never had it, what Friedrich\r\ncan they hope to be possible among them? Age after age they grind\r\ndown their Friedrichs contentedly under the hoofs of cattle on their\r\nhighways; and even find it an excellent practice, and pride themselves\r\non Liberty and Equality. Most certain it is, there will no Friedrich\r\ncome to rule there; by and by, there will none be born there. Such\r\nNations cannot have a King to command them; can only have this or\r\nthe other scandalous swindling Copper Captain, constitutional Gilt\r\nMountebank, or other the like unsalutary entity by way of King; and the\r\nsins of the fathers are visited upon the children in a frightful and\r\ntragical manner, little noticed in the Penny Newspapers and Periodical\r\nLiteratures of this generation. Oh, my friends--! But there is plain\r\nBusiness waiting us at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II.--REPAIRING OF A RUINED PRUSSIA.\r\n\r\nThat of Friedrich's sitting wrapt in a cloud of reflections\r\nOlympian-Abysmal, in the music-chapel at Charlottenburg, while he had\r\nthe Ambrosian Song executed for him there, as the preliminary step, was\r\na loose myth; but the fact lying under it is abundantly certain. Few\r\nSons of Adam had more reason for a piously thankful feeling towards the\r\nPast, a piously valiant towards the Future. What king or man had seen\r\nhimself delivered from such strangling imbroglios of destruction, such\r\ndevouring rages of a hostile world? And the ruin worked by them lay\r\nmonstrous and appalling all round. Friedrich is now Fifty-one gone;\r\nunusually old for his age; feels himself an old man, broken with years\r\nand toils; and here lies his Kingdom in haggard slashed condition, worn\r\nto skin and bone: How is the King, resourceless, to remedy it? That is\r\nnow the seemingly impossible problem. \"Begin it,--thereby alone will it\r\never cease to be impossible!\" Friedrich begins, we may say, on the\r\nfirst morrow morning. Labors at his problem, as he did in the march to\r\nLeuthen; finds it to become more possible, day after day, month after\r\nmonth, the farther he strives with it.\r\n\r\n\"Why not leave it to Nature?\" think many, with the Dismal Science\r\nat their elbow. Well; that was the easiest plan, but it was not\r\nFriedrich's. His remaining moneys, 25 million thalers ready for a\r\nCampaign which has not come, he distributes to the most necessitous:\r\n\"all his artillery-horses\" are parted into plough-teams, and given to\r\nthose who can otherwise get none: think what a fine figure of rye\r\nand barley, instead of mere windlestraws, beggary and desolation, was\r\nrealized by that act alone. Nature is ready to do much; will of herself\r\ncover, with some veil of grass and lichen, the nakedness of ruin: but\r\nher victorious act, when she can accomplish it, is that of getting YOU\r\nto go with her handsomely, and change disaster itself into new wealth.\r\nInto new wisdom and valor, which are wealth in all kinds; California\r\nmere zero to them, zero, or even a frightful MINUS quantity! Friedrich's\r\nprocedures in this matter I believe to be little less didactic than\r\nthose other, which are so celebrated in War: but no Dryasdust, not even\r\na Dryasdust of the Dismal Science, has gone into them, rendered men\r\nfamiliar with them in their details and results. His Silesian Land-Bank\r\n(joint-stock Moneys, lent on security of Land) was of itself, had I room\r\nto explain it, an immense furtherance. [Preuss, iii. 75; _OEuvres de\r\nFrederic,_ vi. 84.] Friedrich, many tell us, was as great in Peace as\r\nin War: and truly, in the economic and material provinces, my own\r\nimpression, gathered painfully in darkness, and contradiction of the\r\nDismal-Science Doctors, is much to that effect. A first-rate Husbandman\r\n(as his Father had been); who not only defended his Nation, but made it\r\nrich beyond what seemed possible; and diligently sowed annuals into it,\r\nand perennials which flourish aloft at this day.\r\n\r\nMirabeau's _Monarchie Prussienne,_ in 8 thick Volumes 8vo,--composed, or\r\nhastily cobbled together, some Twenty years after this period,--contains\r\nthe best tabular view one anywhere gets of Friedrich's economics,\r\nmilitary and other practical methods and resources:--solid exact Tables\r\nthese are, and intelligent intelligible descriptions, done by Mauvillon\r\nFILS, the same punctual Major Mauvillon who used to attend us in Duke\r\nFerdinand's War;--and so far as Mirabeau is concerned, the Work consists\r\nfarther of a certain small Essay done in big type, shoved into the belly\r\nof each Volume, and eloquently recommending, with respectful censures\r\nand regrets over Friedrich, the Gospel of Free Trade, dear to Papa\r\nMirabeau. The Son is himself a convert; far above lying, even to\r\nplease Papa: but one can see, the thought of Papa gives him new fire of\r\nexpression. They are eloquent, ruggedly strong Essays, those of Mirabeau\r\nJunior upon Free Trade:--they contain, in condensed shape, everything\r\nwe were privileged to hear, seventy years later, from all organs,\r\ncoach-horns, jews-harps and scrannel-pipes, PRO and CONTRA, on the same\r\nsublime subject: \"God is great, and Plugson of Undershot is his Prophet.\r\nThus saith the Lord, Buy in the cheapest market, sell in the dearest!\"\r\nTo which the afflicted human mind listens what it can;--and after\r\nseventy years, mournfully asks itself and Mirabeau, \"M. le Comte, would\r\nthere have been in Prussia, for example, any Trade at all, any Nation at\r\nall, had it always been left 'Free'? There would have been mere sand and\r\nquagmire, and a community of wolves and bisons, M. le Comte. Have the\r\ngoodness to terminate that Litany, and take up another!\"\r\n\r\nWe said, Friedrich began his problem on the first morrow morning; and\r\nthat is literally true, that or even MORE. Here is how Friedrich takes\r\nhis stand amid the wreck, speedy enough to begin: this view of our old\r\nfriend Nussler and him is one of the Pieces we can give,--thanks to Herr\r\nBusching and his _Beitrage_ for the last time! Nussler is now something\r\nof a Country Gentleman, so to speak; has a pleasant place out to east of\r\nBerlin; is LANDRATH (County Chairman) there, \"Landrath of Nether-Barnim\r\nCircle;\" where we heard of the Cossacks spoiling him: he, as who not,\r\nhas suffered dreadfully in these tumults. Here is Busching's welcome\r\nAccount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLANDRATH NUSSLER AND THE KING (30th March-3d April, 1763).\r\n\r\n\"MARCH 30th, 1763, Friedrich, on his return to Berlin, came by the route\r\nof Tassdorf,\"--Tassdorf, in Nether-Barnim Circle (40 odd miles from\r\nFrankfurt, and above 15 from Berlin);--\"and changed horses there. During\r\nthis little pause, among a crowd assembled to see him, he was addressed\r\nby Nussler, Landrath of the Circle, who had a very piteous story to\r\ntell. Nussler wished the King joy of his noble victories, and of the\r\nglorious Peace at last achieved: 'May your Majesty reign in health\r\nand happiness over us many years, to the blessing of us all!'--and\r\nrecommended to his gracious care the extremely ruined, and, especially\r\nby the Russians, uncommonly devastated Circle, for which,\" continues\r\nBusching \"this industrious Landrath had not hitherto been able to\r\nextract any effective help.\" Generally for the Provinces wasted by the\r\nRussians there had already some poor 300,000 thalers (45,000 pounds)\r\nbeen allowed by a helpful Majesty, not over-rich himself at the moment;\r\nand of this, Nether-Barnim no doubt gets its share: but what is this to\r\nsuch ruin as there is? A mere preliminary drop, instead of the bucket\r\nand buckets we need!--Busching, a dull, though solid accurate kind\r\nof man, heavy-footed, and yet always in a hurry, always slipshod, has\r\nnothing of dramatic here; far from it; but the facts themselves fall\r\nnaturally into that form,--in Three Scenes:--\r\n\r\n\r\nI. TASSDORF (still two hours from Berlin), KING, NUSSLER AND A CROWD OF\r\nPEOPLE, Nussler ALONE DARING TO SPEAK.\r\n\r\nKING (from his Carriage, ostlers making despatch). \"What is your Circle\r\nmost short of?\"\r\n\r\nLANDRATH NUSSLER. \"Of horses for ploughing the seedfields of rye to sow\r\nthem, and of bread till the crops come.\"\r\n\r\nKING. \"Rye for bread, and to sow with, I will give; with horses I cannot\r\nassist.\"\r\n\r\nNUSSLER. \"On representation of Privy-Councillor van Brenkenhof [the\r\nMinister concerned with such things], your Majesty has been pleased to\r\ngive the Neumark and Pommern an allowance of Artillery and Commissariat\r\nHorses: but poor Nether-Barnim, nobody will speak for it; and unless\r\nyour Majesty's gracious self please to take pity on it, Nether-Barnim is\r\nlost!\" (A great many things more he said, in presence of a large crowd\r\nof men who had gathered round the King's Carriage as the horses were\r\nbeing changed; and spoke with such force and frankness that the King was\r\nsurprised, and asked:)--\r\n\r\nKING. \"Who are you?\" (has forgotten the long-serviceable man!)\r\n\r\nNUSSLER. \"I am the Nussler who was lucky enough to manage the Fixing of\r\nthe Silesian Boundaries for your Majesty!\"\r\n\r\nKING. \"JA, JA, now I know you again! Bring me all the Landraths of the\r\nKurmark [Mark of Brandenburg Proper, ELECTORAL Mark] in a body; I will\r\nspeak with them.\"\r\n\r\nNUSSLER. \"All of them but two are in Berlin already.\"\r\n\r\nKING. \"Send off estafettes for those two to come at once to Berlin; and\r\non Thursday,\" day after to-morrow, \"come yourself, with all the others,\r\nto the Schloss to me: I will then have some closer conversation, and\r\nsay what I can and will do for helping of the country,\" (King's Carriage\r\nrolls away, with low bows and blessings from Nussler and everybody).\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THURSDAY, APRIL 1st, NUSSLER AND ASSEMBLED LANDRATHS AT THE SCHLOSS\r\nOF BERLIN. To them, enter KING....\r\n\r\nNUSSLER (whom they have appointed spokesman).... \"Your Majesty has given\r\nus Peace; you will also give us Well-being in the Land again: we\r\nleave it to Highest-the-Same's gracious judgment [no limit to\r\nHighest-the-Same's POWER, it would seem] what you will vouchsafe to us\r\nas indemnification for the Russian plunderings.\"\r\n\r\nKING. \"Be you quiet; let me speak. Have you got a pencil (HAT ER\r\nCRAYON)? Yes! Well then, write, and these Gentlemen shall dictate to\r\nyou:--\r\n\r\n\"'How much rye for bread; How much for seed; How many Horses, Oxen,\r\nCows, their Circles do in an entirely pressing way require?'\r\n\r\n\"Consider all that to the bottom; and come to me again the day after\r\nto-morrow. But see that you fix everything with the utmost exactitude,\r\nfor I cannot give much.\" (EXIT King.)\r\n\r\nNUSSLER (to the Landraths). \"MEINE HERREN, have the goodness to\r\naccompany me to our Landschaft House [we have a kind of County Hall, it\r\nseems]; there we will consider everything.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Nussler, guiding the deliberations, which are glad to follow him\r\non every point, and writing as PRO-TEMPORE Secretary, has all things\r\nbrought to luminous Protocol in the course of this day and next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. SATURDAY, APRIL 3d, IN THE SCHLOSS AGAIN: NUSSLER AND LANDRATHS. To\r\nthem, the KING.\r\n\r\nNussler. \"We deliver to your Majesty the written Specification you\r\nwere graciously pleased to command of us. It contains only the\r\nindispensablest things that the Circles are in need of. Moreover, it\r\nregards only the STANDE [richer Nobility], who pay contribution; the\r\nGentry [ADEL], and other poor people, who have been utterly plundered\r\nout by the Russians, are not included in it:--the Gentry too have\r\nsuffered very much by the War and the Plundering.\"\r\n\r\nKING. \"What EDELLEUTE that are members of STANDE have you [ER] got in\r\nyour Circle?\"\r\n\r\nNUSSLER (names them; and, as finis of the list, adds):... \"I myself,\r\ntoo, your Majesty, I have suffered more than anybody: I absolutely could\r\nnot furnish those 4,000 bushels of meal ordered of me by the Russians;\r\nupon which they--\"\r\n\r\nKING. \"I cannot give to all: but if you have poor Nobles in your Circle,\r\nwho can in no way help themselves, I will give them something.\"\r\n\r\nNUSSLER (has not any in Nether-Barnim who are altogether in that extreme\r\npredicament; but knows several in Lebus Circle, names them to the\r\nKing;--and turning to the Landrath of Lebus, and to another who is\r\nmute): \"Herr, you can name some more in Lebus; and you, in Teltow\r\nCircle, Herr Landrath, since his Majesty permits.\"... In a word, the\r\nKing having informed himself and declared his intention, Nussler leads\r\nthe Landraths to their old County Hall, and brings to Protocol what had\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\nNext day, the Kammer President (Exchequer President), Van der Groben,\r\nhad Nussler, with other Landraths, to dinner. During dinner, there came\r\nfrom Head Secretary Eichel (Majesty's unwearied Clerk of the PELLS,\r\nSheepskins, or PAPERS) an earnest request to Von der Groben for\r\nhelp,--Eichel not being able to remember, with the requisite precision,\r\neverything his Majesty had bid him put down on this matter. \"You will\r\ngo, Herr von Nussler; be so kind, won't you?\" And Nussler went, and\r\nfully illuminated Eichel....\r\n\r\nTo the poorest of the Nobility, Busching tells us, what is otherwise\r\nwell known, the King gave considerable sums: to one Circle 12,000\r\npounds, to another 9,000 pounds, 6,000 pounds, and so on. By help\r\nof which bounties, and of Nussler laboring incessantly with all his\r\nstrength, Nieder-Barnim Circle got on its feet again, no subject having\r\nbeen entirely ruined, but all proving able to recover. [Busching,\r\n_Beitrage_ (Nussler), i. 401-405.]\r\n\r\nThis Busching Fragment is not in the style of the Elder Dramatists, or\r\nfor the Bankside Theatre; but this represents a Fact which befell in\r\nGod's Creation, and may have an interest of its own to the Practical\r\nSoul, especially in anarchic Countries, far advanced in the \"Gold-nugget\r\nand Nothing to Buy with it\" Career of unexampled Prosperities.\r\n\r\nOn these same errands the King is soon going on an Inspection Journey,\r\nwhere we mean to accompany. But first, one word, and one will suffice,\r\non the debased Coin. The Peace was no sooner signed, than Friedrich\r\nproceeded on the Coin. The third week after his arrival home, there came\r\nout a salutary Edict on it, April 21st; King eager to do it without loss\r\nof time, yet with the deliberation requisite. Not at one big leap, which\r\nmight shake, to danger of oversetting, much commercial arrangement; but\r\nat two leaps, with a halfway station intervening. Halfway station, with\r\na new coinage ready, much purer of alloy (and marked HOW much, for\r\nthe benefit of parties with accounts to settle), is to commence on\r\nTRINITATIS (Whitsunday) instant; from and after Whitsunday the improved\r\nnew coin to be sole legal tender, till farther notice. Farther notice\r\ncomes accordingly, within a year, March 29th, 1764: \"Pure money of\r\nthe standard of 1750 [honest silver coinage: readers may remember\r\nLinsenbarth, the CANDIDATUS THEOLOGIAE, and his sack of Batzen,\r\nconfiscated at the Paekhof] shall be ready on the 1st of June instant;\"\r\n[Rodenbeck, ii. 214, 234.]--from and after which day we hear no more of\r\nthat sad matter. Finished off in about fourteen months. Here, meanwhile,\r\nis the Inspection Journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKRIEGSRATH RODEN AND THE KING (6th-13th June, 1763).\r\n\r\nJUNE 2d, 1763, Friedrich left Potsdam for Westphalia; got as far as\r\nMagdeburg that day. Intends seeing into matters with his own eyes in\r\nthat region, as in others, after so long and sad an absence. There are\r\nwith him Friedrich Wilhelm Prince of Prussia, a tall young fellow of\r\nnineteen; General-Adjutant von Anhalt; and one or two Prussian\r\nmilitary people. From Magdeburg and onwards the great Duke Ferdinand\r\naccompanies,--who is now again Governor of Magdeburg, and a quiet\r\nPrussian Officer as heretofore, though with excellent Pensions from\r\nEngland, and glory from all the world.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Party goes by Halberstadt, which suffered greatly in the War;\r\nthence by MINDEN (June 4th); and the first thing next day, Friedrich\r\ntakes view of the BATTLE-FIELD there,--under Ferdinand's own guidance,\r\ndoubtless; and an interesting thing to both Friedrich and him, though\r\nleft silent to us. This done, they start for Lippstadt, are received\r\nthere under joyous clangorous outburst of all the bells and all\r\nthe honors, that same afternoon; and towards sunset, Hamm being the\r\nNight-quarter ahead, are crossing VELLINGHAUSEN BATTLE-GROUND,--where\r\ndoubtless Ferdinand again, like a dutiful apprentice, will explain\r\nmatters to his old master, so far as needful or permissible. The\r\nconversation, I suppose, may have been lively and miscellaneous:\r\nFerdinand mentions a clever business-person of the name of Roden,\r\nwhom he has known in these parts; \"Roden?\" the King carefully makes\r\nnote;--and, in fact, we shall see Roden presently; and his bit of\r\nDIALOGUE with the King (recorded by his own hand) is our chief errand on\r\nthis Journey. From Hamm, next morning (June 6th), they get to Wesel\r\nby 11 A.M. (only sixty miles); Wesel all in gala, as Lippstadt was,\r\nor still more than Lippstadt; and for four days farther, they continue\r\nthere very busy. As Roden is our chief errand, let us attend to Roden.\r\n\r\nWESEL, MONDAY, JUNE 6th, \"Dinner being done,\" says an authentic\r\nThird-Party, [Rodenbeck, ii. 217.] \"the King had Kammer-Director Meyen\r\nsummoned to him with his Register-Books, Schedules and Reports [what\r\nthey call ETATS]; and was but indifferently contented with Meyen and\r\nthem.\" And in short, \"ordering Meyen to remodel these into a more\r\ndistinct condition,\"--we may now introduce the Herr Kriegsrath Roden,\r\na subaltern, in rank, but who has perhaps a better head than Meyen, to\r\njudge of these ETATS. Roden himself shall now report. This is the Royal\r\nDialogue with Roden; accurately preserved for us by him;--I wish it had\r\nbeen better worth the reader's trouble; but its perfect credibility in\r\nevery point will be some recommendation to it.\r\n\r\n\"MONDAY, 6th JUNE, 1763, about 11 A.M., his Majesty arrived in Wesel,\"\r\nsays Roden (confirming to us the authentic Third-Party); \"I waited on\r\nAdjutant-General Colonel von Anhalt to announce myself; who referred\r\nme to Kriegsrath Coper [\"MEIN SEGRETER KOPER\" is a name we have heard\r\nbefore], who told me to be ready so soon as Dinner should be over.\r\nDinner was no sooner over [2 P.M. or so], than the Herr Kammer-Director\r\nMeyen with his ETATS was called in. His Majesty was not content with\r\nthese, Herr Meyen was told; and they were to be remodelled into a more\r\ndistinct condition. The instant Herr Meyen stept out, I was called in.\r\nHis Majesty was standing with his back to the fire; and said:--\r\n\r\nKING. \"'Come nearer [Roden comes nearer]. Prince Ferdinand [of\r\nBrunswick, whom we generally call DUKE and great, to distinguish him\r\nfrom a little Prussian Prince Ferdinand] has told me much good of you:\r\nwhere do you come from?'\r\n\r\nRODEN. \"'From Soest' [venerable \"stone-old\" little Town, in\r\nVellinghausen region].\r\n\r\nKING. \"'Did you get my Letter?'\r\n\r\nRODEN. \"'Yea, IHRO MAJESTAT.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'I will give you some employment. Have you got a pencil?'\r\n\r\nRODEN. \"'Yea' [and took out his Note-book and tools, which he had\r\n\"bought in a shop a quarter of an hour before\"].\r\n\r\nKING. \"'Listen. By the War many Houses have got ruined: I mean that\r\nthey shall be put in order again; for which end,--to those that cannot\r\nthemselves help, particularly to Soest, Hamm, Lunen and in part Wesel,\r\nas places that have suffered most,--I intend to give the moneys. Now you\r\nmust make me an exact List of what is to be done in those places. Thus\r\n[King, lifting his finger, let us fancy, dictates; Roden, with brand-new\r\npencil and tablets, writes:]\r\n\r\n\"'1. In each of those Towns, how many ruined Houses there are which\r\nthe proprietors themselves can manage to rebuild. 2. How many which\r\nthe proprietors cannot. 3. The vacant grounds or steadings of such\r\nproprietors as are perhaps dead, or gone else-whither, must be given to\r\nothers that are willing to build: but in regard to this, Law also must\r\ndo its part, and the absent and the heirs must be cited to say, Whether\r\nthey will themselves build? and in case they won't, the steadings can\r\nthen be given to others.'\" Roden having written,--\r\n\r\nKING. \"'In the course of six days you must be ready [what an\r\nexpeditious King! Is to be at Cleve the sixth day hence: Meet me there,\r\nthen],--longer I cannot give you.'\r\n\r\nRODEN (considering a moment). \"'If your Majesty will permit me to use\r\nESTAFETTES [express messengers] for the Towns farthest off,--as I\r\ncannot myself, within the time, travel over all the Towns,--I hope to be\r\nready.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'That I permit; and will repay you the ESTAFETTE moneys.--Tell\r\nme, How comes the decrease of population in these parts? Recruits I got\r\nnone.'\r\n\r\nRODEN. \"'Under favor of your Majesty, Regiment Schenkendorf got, every\r\nyear, for recompletion, what recruits were wanted, from its Canton in\r\nthe Grafschaft Mark here.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'There you may be right: but from Cleve Country we had no\r\nrecruits; not we, though the Austrians had, [with a slight sarcasm of\r\ntone].\r\n\r\nRODEN. \"'Out of Cleve, so far as I know, there were no recruits\r\ndelivered to the Austrians.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'You could not know; you were with the Allied Army' [Duke\r\nFerdinand's, commissariating and the like, where Duke Ferdinand\r\nrecognized you to have a head].\r\n\r\nRODEN. \"'There have been many epidemic diseases too; especially in\r\nSoest;--after the Battle of Vellinghausen all the wounded were brought\r\nthither, and the hospitals were established there.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'Epidemic diseases they might have got without a Battle [dislikes\r\nhearing ill of the soldier trade]. I will have Order sent to the Cleve\r\nKammer, Not to lay hindrance in your way, but the contrary. Now God keep\r\nyou (GOTT BEWAHRE IHN).'\"--EXIT Roden;--\"DARAUF RETIRIRTE MICH,\" says\r\nhe;--but will reappear shortly.\r\n\r\nSunday, 12th June, is the sixth day hence; later than the end of Sunday\r\nis not permissible to swift Roden; nor does he need it.\r\n\r\nFriday, 10th, Friedrich left Wesel; crossed the Rhine, intending for\r\nCleve; went by CREFELD,--at Crefeld had view of another BATTLE-FIELD,\r\nunder good ciceroneship; remarks or circumstances otherwise not\r\ngiven:--and, next day, Saturday, 11th, picked up D'Alembert, who, by\r\nappointment, is proceeding towards Potsdam, at a more leisurely rate.\r\nThat same Saturday, after much business done, the King was at Kempen,\r\nthence at Geldern; speeding for Cleve itself, due there that night. At\r\nGeldern, we say, he picked up D'Alembert;--concerning whom, more by and\r\nby. And finally, \"on Saturday night, about half-past 8, the King entered\r\nCleve,\" amid joyances extraordinary, hut did not alight; drove direct\r\nthrough by the Nassau Gate, and took quarter \"in the neighboring\r\nCountry-house of Bellevue, with the Dutch General von Spaen there,\"--an\r\nobliging acquaintance once, while LIEUTENANT Spaen, in our old\r\nCrown-Prince times of trouble! Had his year in Spandau for us there,\r\nwhile poor Katte lost his head! To whom, I have heard, the King talked\r\ncharmingly on this occasion, but was silent as to old Potsdam matters.\r\n[Supra, vii. 165.]--\r\n\r\nBy his set day, Roden is also in Cleve, punctual man, finished or just\r\nfinishing; and ready for summons by his Majesty. And accordingly:--\r\n\r\n\"CLEVE, MONDAY, JUNE 13th, At 9 in the morning,\" records he, \"I had\r\naudience of the King's Majesty. [In Spaen's Villa of Bellevue, shall\r\nwe still suppose? Duke Ferdinand, Prince of Prussia and the rest, have\r\nbestowed themselves in other fit houses; D'Alembert too,--who is to make\r\ndirect for Potsdam henceforth, by his own route; and will meet us on\r\narriving.]--I handed him my Report, with the Tabular Schedule. His\r\nMajesty read it carefully through, in my presence; and examined all\r\nof it with strictness. Was pleased to signify his satisfaction with\r\nmy work. Resolved to allow 250,000 thalers (37,500 pounds) for this\r\nbusiness of Rebuilding; gave out the due Orders to his Kammer, in\r\nconsequence, and commanded me to arrange with the Kammer what was\r\nnecessary. This done, his Majesty said:--\r\n\r\nKING. \"'What you were described to me, I find you to be. You are a\r\ndiligent laborious man; I must have you nearer to me;--in the Berlin\r\nHammer you ought to be. You shall have a good, a right good Salary;\r\nyour Patent I will give you gratis; also a VORSPANN-PASS [Standing\r\nOrder available at all Prussian Post-Stations] for two carriages [rapid\r\nProgram of the thing, though yet distant, rising in the Royal fancy!].\r\nNow serve on as faithfully as you have hitherto done.'\r\n\r\nRODEN. \"'That is the object of all my endeavors.'\" (EXIT:--I did\r\nnot hear specially whitherward just now; but he comes to be supreme\r\nKammer-President in those parts by and by.)\r\n\r\n\"The Herr Kriegsrath Coper was present, and noted all the Orders to\r\nhe expedited.\" [Preuss, ii. 442; Rodenbeck, ii. 217, 218: in regard to\r\nD'Alembert, see _OEuvres de Frederic,_ xxiv. 190.]\r\n\r\nThese snatches of notice at first-hand, and what the reader's fancy\r\nmay make of these, are all we can bestow on this Section of Friedrich's\r\nLabors; which is naturally more interesting to Prussian readers than\r\nto English. He has himself given lucid and eloquent account of it,--Two\r\nample Chapters, \"DES FINANCES;\" \"DU MILITAIRE,\" [_OEuvres de Frederic,_\r\nvii. 73-90, 91-109.]--altogether pleasant reading, should there still\r\nbe curiosity upon it. There is something of flowingly eloquent in\r\nFriedrich's account of this Battle waged against the inanimate Chaos;\r\nsomething of exultant and triumphant, not noticeable of him in regard\r\nto his other Victories. On the Leuthens, Rossbachs, he is always cold\r\nas water, and nobody could gather that he had the least pleasure in\r\nrecording them. Not so here. And indeed here he is as beautiful as\r\nanywhere; and the reader, as a general son of Adam,--proud to see human\r\nintellect and heroism slaying that kind of lions, and doing what\r\nin certain sad epochs is unanimously voted to be impossible and\r\nunattemptable,--exults along with him; and perhaps whispers to his own\r\npoor heart, nearly choked by the immeasurable imbroglio of Blue-books\r\nand Parliamentary Eloquences which for the present encumber Heaven\r\nand Earth, \"MELIORA SPERO.\" To Mirabeau, the following details, from\r\nfirst-hand, but already of twenty-three years distance, were not known,\r\n[Appeared first in Tome v. of _\"OEuvres Posthumes de Frederic II.\"_ (are\r\nin Tome vi. of Preuss's Edition of OEUVRES), \"Berlin, 1788;\"--above a\r\nyear after Mirabeau had left.] while he sat penning those robust Essays\r\non the Duty of LEAVE-ALONE.\r\n\r\n\"To form an idea of the general subversion,\" says the King, in regard\r\nto 1763, \"and how great were the desolation and discouragement, you must\r\nrepresent to yourself Countries entirely ravaged, the very traces of\r\nthe old habitations hardly discoverable; Towns, some ruined from top to\r\nbottom, others half destroyed by fire;--13,000 Houses, of which the\r\nvery vestiges were gone. No field in seed; no grain for the food of the\r\ninhabitants; 60,000 horses needed, if there was to be ploughing carried\r\non: in the Provinces generally Half a Million Population (500,000) less\r\nthan in 1756,--that is to say, upon only Four Millions and a Half, the\r\nninth man was wanting. Noble and Peasant had been pillaged, ransomed,\r\nforaged, eaten out by so many different Armies; nothing now left them\r\nbut life and miserable rags.\r\n\r\n\"There was no credit, by trading people, even for the daily necessaries\r\nof life.\" And furthermore, what we were not prepared for, \"No police in\r\nthe Towns: to habits of equity and order had succeeded a vile greed of\r\ngain and an anarchic disorder. The Colleges of Justice and of Finance\r\nhad, by these frequent invasions of so many enemies, been reduced to\r\ninaction:\" no Judge, in many places not even a Tax-gatherer: the silence\r\nof the Laws had produced in the people a taste for license; boundless\r\nappetite for gain was their main rule of action: the noble, the\r\nmerchant, the farmer, the laborer, raising emulously each the price of\r\nhis commodity, seemed to endeavor only for their mutual ruin. Such, when\r\nthe War ended, was the fatal spectacle over these Provinces, which had\r\nonce been so flourishing: however pathetic the description may be, it\r\nwill never approach the touching and sorrowful impression which the\r\nsight of it produced.\"\r\n\r\nFriedrich found that it would never do to trust to the mere aid of Time\r\nin such circumstances: at the end of the Thirty-Years War, \"Time\"\r\nhad, owing to absolute want of money, been the one recipe of the Great\r\nElector in a similar case; and Time was then found to mean \"about a\r\nhundred Years.\" Friedrich found that he must at once step in with active\r\nremedies, and on all hands strive to make the impossible possible.\r\nLuckily he had in readiness, as usual, the funds for an Eighth Campaign,\r\nhad such been needed. Out of these moneys he proceeded to rebuild the\r\nTowns and Villages; \"from the Corn-Stores (GRANARIES D'ABONDANCE,\"\r\nGovernment establishments gathered from plentiful harvests against\r\nscarce, according to old rule) \"were taken the supplies for food of the\r\npeople and sowing of the ground: the horses intended for the artillery,\r\nbaggage and commissariat,\" 60,000 horses we have heard, \"were\r\ndistributed among those who had none, to be employed in tillage of the\r\nland. Silesia was discharged from all taxes for six months; Pommern and\r\nthe Neumark for two years. A sum of about Three Million sterling [in\r\nTHALERS 20,389,000] was given for relief of the Provinces, and as\r\nacquittance of the impositions the Enemy had wrung from them.\r\n\r\n\"Great as was this expense, it was necessary and indispensable. The\r\ncondition of these Provinces after the Peace of Hubertsburg recalled\r\nwhat we know of them when the Peace of Munster closed the famous\r\nThirty-Years War. On that occasion the State failed of help from want\r\nof means; which put it, out, of the Great Elector's power to assist\r\nhis people: and what happened? That a whole century elapsed before his\r\nSuccessors could restore the Towns and Champaigns to what they were.\r\nThis impressive example was admonitory to the King: that to repair the\r\nPublic Calamities, assistance must be prompt and effective. Repeated\r\ngifts (LARGESSES) restored courage to the poor Husbandmen, who began to\r\ndespair of their lot; by the helps given, hope in all classes sprang\r\nup anew: encouragement of labor produced activity; love of Country rose\r\nagain with fresh life: in a word [within the second year in a markedly\r\nhopeful manner, and within seven years altogether], the fields were\r\ncultivated again, manufacturers had resumed their work; and the Police,\r\nonce more in vigor, corrected by degrees the vices that had taken root\r\nduring the time of anarchy.\" [_OEuvres de Frederic,_ vi. 74, 75.]\r\n\r\nTo Friedrich's difficulties, which were not inconsiderable, mark only\r\nthis last additament: \"During this War, the elder of the Councillors,\r\nand all the Ministers of the Grand Directorium [centre of Prussian\r\nAdministration], had successively died: and in such time of trouble\r\nit had been impossible to replace them. The embarrassment was, To find\r\npersons capable of filling these different employments [some would have\r\nvery soon done it, your Majesty; but their haste would not have tended\r\nto speed!]--We searched the Provinces (ON FOUILLA, sifted), where\r\ngood heads were found as rare as in the Capital: at length five Chief\r\nMinisters were pitched upon,\"--who prove to be tolerable, and even\r\ngood. Three of them were, the VONS Blumenthal, Massow, Hagen, unknown\r\nto readers here: fourth and fifth were, the Von Wedell as War-Minister,\r\nonce Dictator at Zullichan; and a Von der Horst, who had what we might\r\npartially call the Home Department, and who may by accident once or so\r\nbe namable again.\r\n\r\nNor was War all, says the King: \"accidental Fires in different places,\"\r\nwhile we struggled to repair the ravagings of War, \"were of unexampled\r\nfrequency, and did immense farther damage. From 1765 to 1769, here is\r\nthe list of places burnt: In East Preussen, the City of Konigsberg\r\ntwice over; in Silesia, the Towns of Freystadt, Ober-Glogau [do readers\r\nrecollect Manteuffel of Foot and \"WIR WOLLEN IHM WAS\"!], Parchwitz,\r\nNaumburg-on-Queiss, and Goldberg; in the Mark, Nauen; in the Neumark,\r\nCalies and a part of Lansberg; in Pommern, Belgard and Tempelburg. These\r\naccidents required incessantly new expenditures to repair them.\"\r\n\r\nFriedrich was not the least of a Free Trader, except where it\r\nsuited him: and his continual subventions and donations, guidances,\r\nencouragements, commandings and prohibitions, wise supervision and\r\nimpulsion,--are a thing I should like to hear an intelligent Mirabeau\r\n(Junior or Senior) discourse upon, after he had well studied them! For\r\nexample: \"ON RENDIT LES PRETRES UTILES, The Priests, Catholic Priests,\r\nwere turned to use by obliging all the rich Abbeys to establish\r\nmanufactures: here it was weavers making damasks and table-cloths; there\r\noil-mills [oil from linseed]; or workers in copper, wire-drawers; as\r\nsuited the localities and the natural products,--the flaxes and\r\nthe metals, with water-power, markets, and so on.\" What a charming\r\nresuscitation of the rich Abbeys from their dormant condition!\r\n\r\nI should like still better to explain how, in Lower Silesia, \"we (ON)\r\nmanaged to increase the number of Husbandmen by 4,000 families. You will\r\nbe surprised how it was possible to multiply to this extent the people\r\nliving by Agriculture in a Country where already not a field was waste.\r\nThe reason was this. Many Lords of Land, to increase their Domain, had\r\nimperceptibly appropriated to themselves the holdings (TERRES) of their\r\nvassals. Had this abuse been suffered to go on, in time a great\"--But\r\nthe commentary needed would be too lengthy; we will give only the\r\nresult: \"In the long-run, every Village would have had its Lord, but\r\nthere would have been no tax-paying Farmers left.\" The Landlord, ruler\r\nof these Landless, might himself (as Majesty well knows) have been made\r\nto PAY, had that been all; but it was not. \"To possess something; that\r\nis what makes the citizen attached to his Country; those who have no\r\nproperty, and have nothing to lose, what tie have they?\" A weak one, in\r\ncomparison!\"All these things being represented to the Landlord Class,\r\ntheir own advantage made them consent to replace their Peasants on the\r\nold footing.\"...\r\n\r\n\"To make head against so many extraordinary demands,\" adds the King\r\n(looking over to a new Chapter, that of the MILITARY, which Department,\r\nto his eyes, was not less shockingly dilapidated than the CIVIL,\r\nand equally or more needed instant repair), \"new resources had to\r\nbe devised. For, besides what was needed for re-establishment of the\r\nProvinces, new Fortifications were necessary; and all our Cannon,\r\nE'VASES (worn too wide in the bore), needed to be refounded; which\r\noccasioned considerable new expense. This led us to improvement of the\r\nExcises,\"--concerning which there will have to be a Section by itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF FRIEDRICH'S NEW EXCISE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nIn his late Inspection-Journey to Cleve Country, D'Alembert, from Paris,\r\nby appointment waited for the King; [In (_OEuvres de Frederic,_ xxiv.\r\n377-380 (D'Alembert's fine bits of Letters in prospect of Potsdam,\r\n\"Paris, 7th March-29th April, 1763;\" and two small Notes while there,\r\n\"Sans-Souci, 6th July-15th August, 1763\").]--picked up at Geldern (June\r\n11th), as we saw above. D'Alembert got to Potsdam June 22d; stayed till\r\nmiddle of August. He had met the King once before, in 1755; who found\r\nhim \"a BON GARCON,\" as we then saw. D'Alembert was always, since that\r\ntime, an agreeable, estimable little man to Friedrich. Age now about\r\nforty-six; has lately refused the fine Russian post of \"Tutor to the\r\nCzarowitsh\" (Czarowitsh Paul, poor little Boy of eight or nine, whom we,\r\nor Herr Busching for us, saw galloping about, not long since, \"in his\r\ndressing-gown,\" under Panin's Tutorage); refuses now, in a delicate\r\ngradual manner, the fine Prussian post of Perpetual President, or\r\nSuccessor to Maupertuis;--definitely preferring his frugal pensions at\r\nParis, and garret all his own there. Continues, especially after this\r\ntwo months' visit of 1763, one of the King's chief correspondents for\r\nthe next twenty years. [\"29th October, 1783,\" D'Alembert died: \"born\r\n16th November, 1717;\"--a Foundling, as is well known; \"Mother a\r\nSister of Cardinal Tencin's; Father,\" accidental, \"an Officer in the\r\nArtillery.\"] A man of much clear intellect; a thought SHRIEKY in his\r\nways sometimes; but always prudent, rational, polite, and loyally\r\nrecognizing Friedrich as a precious article in this world. Here is a\r\nword of D'Alembert's to Madame du Deffand, at Paris, some ten or twelve\r\ndays after the Cleve meeting, and the third day after his arrival\r\nhere:--\r\n\r\n\"POTSDAM, 25th JUNE, 1763. MADAME,--... I will not go into the praises\r\nof this Prince,\" King Friedrich, my now Host; \"in my mouth it might\r\nbe suspicious: I will merely send you two traits of him, which will\r\nindicate his way of thinking and feeling. When I spoke to him [at\r\nGeldern, probably, on our first meeting] of the glory he had acquired,\r\nhe answered, with the greatest simplicity, That there was a furious\r\ndiscount to be deducted from said glory; that chance came in for almost\r\nthe whole of it; and that he would far rather have done Ratine's ATHALIE\r\nthan all this War:--ATHALIE is the work he likes, and rereads oftenest;\r\nI believe you won't disapprove his taste there. The other trait I have\r\nto give you is, That on the day [15th February last] of concluding this\r\nPeace, which is so glorious to him, some one saying, 'It is the finest\r\nday of your Majesty's life:' 'The finest day of life,' answered he, 'is\r\nthe day on which one quits it.'...--Adieu, Madame.\" [_\"OEuvres Posthumes\r\nde D'Alembert_ (Paris, 1799). i. 197:\" cited in PREUSS, ii. 348.]\r\n\r\nThe meeting in Cleve Country was, no doubt, a very pretty passage, with\r\nTwo pretty Months following;--and if it be true that HELVETIUS was a\r\nconsequence, the 11th of June, 1763, may almost claim to be a kind\r\nof epoch in Friedrich's later history. The opulent and ingenious M.\r\nHelvetius, who wrote DE L'ESPRIT, and has got banished for that feat\r\n(lost in the gloom of London in those months), had been a mighty\r\nTax-gatherer as well; D'Alembert, as brother Philosophe, was familiar\r\nwith Helvetius. It is certain, also, King Friedrich, at this time, found\r\nhe would require annually two million thalers more;--where to get them,\r\nseemed the impossibility. A General Krockow, who had long been in French\r\nService, and is much about the King, was often recommending the French\r\nExcise system;--he is the Krockow of DOMSTADTL, and that SIEGE OF\r\nOLMUTZ, memorable to some of us:--\"A wonderful Excise system,\" Krockow\r\nis often saying, in this time of straits. \"Who completely understands\r\nit?\" the King might ask. \"Helvetius, against the world!\" D'Alembert\r\ncould justly answer. \"Invite Helvetius to leave his London exile, and\r\naccept an asylum here, where he may be of vital use to me!\" concludes\r\nFriedrich.\r\n\r\nHelvetius came in March, 1765; stayed till June, 1766: [Rodenbeck, ii.\r\n254; Preuss, iii. 11.]--within which time a French Excise system, which\r\nhe had been devising and putting together, had just got in gear, and\r\nbeen in action for a month, to Helvetius's satisfaction. Who thereupon\r\nwent his way, and never returned;--taking with him, as man and\r\ntax-gatherer, the King's lasting gratitude; but by no means that of the\r\nPrussian Nation, in his tax-gathering capacity! All Prussia, or all of\r\nit that fell under this Helvetius Excise system, united to condemn it,\r\nin all manner of dialects, louder and louder: here, for instance, is\r\nthe utterance of Herr Hamann, himself a kind of Custom-house Clerk (at\r\nKonigsberg, in East Preussen), and on modest terms a Literary man of\r\nreal merit and originality, who may be supposed to understand this\r\nsubject: \"And so,\" says Hamann, \"the State has declared its own subjects\r\nincapable of managing its Finance system; and in this way has intrusted\r\nits heart, that is the purse of its subjects, to a company of Foreign\r\nScoundrels, ignorant of everything relating to it!\" [\"Hamann to Jacobi\"\r\n(see Preuss, iii. 1-35), \"Konigsberg, 18th January, 1786.\"]\r\n\r\nThis lasted all Friedrich's lifetime; and gave rise to not a little\r\nbuzzing, especially in its primary or incipient stages. It seems to\r\nhave been one of the unsuccessfulest Finance adventures Friedrich ever\r\nengaged in. It cost his subjects infinite small trouble; awakened very\r\ngreat complaining; and, for the first time, real discontent,--skin-deep\r\nbut sincere and universal,--against the misguided Vater Fritz. Much\r\nnoisy absurdity there was upon it, at home, and especially abroad:\r\n\"Griping miser,\" \"greedy tyrant,\" and so forth! Deducting all which,\r\neverybody now admits that Friedrich's aim was excellent and proper; but\r\nnobody denies withal that the means were inconsiderate, of no profit in\r\nproportion to the trouble they gave, and improper to adopt unless the\r\nnecessity compelled.\r\n\r\nFriedrich is forbidden, or forbids himself, as we have often mentioned,\r\nto impose new taxes: and nevertheless now, on calculations deep, minute\r\nand no doubt exact, he judges That for meeting new attacks of War (or\r\nbeing ready to meet, which will oftenest mean averting them),--a thing\r\nwhich, as he has just seen, may concern the very existence of the\r\nState,--it is necessary that there should be on foot such and such\r\nquantities and kinds of Soldiery and War-furniture, visible to all\r\nneighbors; and privately in the Treasury never less than such and such\r\na sum. To which end Arithmetic declares that there is required about Two\r\nMillion thalers more of yearly revenue than we now have. And where, in\r\nthese circumstances, are the means of raising such a sum?\r\n\r\nFriedrich imposes no new taxes; but there may be stricter methods of\r\nlevying the old;--there may, and in fact there must, be means found!\r\nFriedrich has consulted his Finance Ministers; put the question SERIATIM\r\nto these wise heads: they answer with one voice, \"There are no means.\"\r\n[Rodenbeck, ii. 256.] Friedrich, therefore, has recourse to Helvetius;\r\nwho, on due consideration, and after survey of much documentary and\r\ntabulary raw-material, is of opinion, That the Prussian Excises would,\r\nif levied with the punctuality, precision and vigilant exactitude of\r\nFrench methods, actually yield the required overplus. \"Organize me the\r\nmethods, then; get them put in action here; under French hands, if that\r\nbe indispensable.\" Helvetius bethought him of what fittest French hands\r\nthere were to his knowledge,--in France there are a great many hands\r\nflung idle in the present downbreak of finance there:--Helvetius appears\r\nto have selected, arranged and contrived in this matter with his best\r\ndiligence. De Launay, the Head-engineer of the thing, was admitted by\r\nall Prussia, after Twenty-two years unfriendly experience of him, to\r\nhave been a suitable and estimable person; a man of judicious ways,\r\nof no small intelligence, prudence, and of very great skill in\r\nadministering business.\r\n\r\nHead-engineer De Launay, one may guess, would be consulted by Helvetius\r\nin choice of the subaltern Officials, the stokers and steerers in this\r\nnew Steam-Machinery, which had all to be manned from France. There were\r\nFour heads of departments immediately under De Launay, or scarcely under\r\nhim, junior brothers rather:--who chose these I did not hear; but these\r\nlatter, it is evident, were not a superior quality of people. Of these\r\nFour,--all at very high salaries, from De Launay downwards; \"higher than\r\na Prussian Minister of State!\" murmured the public,--two, within the\r\nfirst year, got into quarrel; fought a duel, fatal to one of them; so\r\nthat there were now only Three left. \"Three, with De Launay, will do,\"\r\nopined Friedrich; and divided the vacant salary among the survivors: in\r\nwhich form they had at least no more duelling.\r\n\r\nAs to the subaltern working-parties, the VISITATEURS, CONTROLLEURS,\r\nJAUGEURS (Gaugers), PLOMBEURS (Lead-stampers), or the strangest kind of\r\nall, called \"Cellar-Rats (COMMIS RATS-DE-CAVE), \"they were so detested\r\nand exclaimed against, by a Public impatient of the work itself, there\r\nis no knowing what their degree of scoundrelism was, nor even, within\r\namazingly wide limits, what the arithmetical number of them was. About\r\n500 in the whole of Prussia, says a quiet Prussian, who has made some\r\ninquiry; [\"Beguelin, ACCISE-UND ZOLL-VERFASSUNG, s. 138\" (Preuss, iii,\r\n18).] 1,500 says Mirabeau; 3,000 say other exaggerative persons, or even\r\n5,000; De Launay's account is, Not at any time above 200. But we can\r\nall imagine how vexatious they and their business were. Nobody now is\r\nprivileged with exemption: from one and all of you, Nobles, Clergy,\r\nPeople, strict account is required, about your beers and liquors; your\r\ncoffee, salt; your consumptions and your purchases of all excisable\r\narticles:--nay, I think in coffee and salt, in salt for certain, what\r\nyou will require, according to your station and domestic numbers, is\r\ncomputed for you, to save trouble; such and such quantities you will\r\nplease to buy in our presence, or to pay duty for, whether you buy them\r\nor not. Into all houses, at any hour of the day or of the night, these\r\ncellar-rats had liberty,--(on warrant from some higher rat of their own\r\ntype, I know not how much higher; and no sure appeal for you, except\r\nto the King; tolerably sure there, if you be INNOCENT, but evidently\r\nperilous if you be only NOT-CONVICTED!)--had liberty, I say, to search\r\nfor contraband; all your presses, drawers, repositories, you must open\r\nto these beautiful creatures; watch in nightcap, and candle in hand,\r\nwhile your things get all tumbled hither and thither, in the search for\r\nwhat perhaps is not there; nay, it was said and suspected, but I never\r\nknew it for certain, that these poisonous French are capable of slipping\r\nin something contraband, on purpose to have you fined whether or not.\r\n\r\nReaders can conceive, though apparently Friedrich did not, what a world\r\nof vexation all this occasioned; and how, in the continual annoyance to\r\nall mankind, the irritation, provocation and querulous eloquence spread\r\namong high and low. Of which the King knew something; but far from the\r\nwhole. His object was one of vital importance; and his plan once fixed,\r\nhe went on with it, according to his custom, regardless of little rubs.\r\nThe Anecdote Books are full of details, comic mostly, on this subject:\r\nHow the French rats pounced down upon good harmless people, innocent\r\nfrugal parsonages, farm-houses; and were comically flung prostrate by\r\nnative ready wit, or by direct appeal to the King. Details, never so\r\nauthentic, could not be advisable in this place. Perhaps there are not\r\nmore than Two authentic Passages, known to me, which can now have the\r\nleast interest, even of a momentary sort, to English readers. The first\r\nis, Of King Friedrich caricatured as a Miser grinding Coffee. I give it,\r\nwithout essential alteration of any kind, in Herr Preuss's words, copied\r\nfrom those of one who saw it:--the second, which relates to a Princess\r\nor Ex-Princess of the Royal House, I must reserve for a little while.\r\nHerr Preuss says:--\r\n\r\n\"Once during the time of the 'Regie' [which lasted from 1766 to 1786 and\r\nthe King's death: no other date assignable, though 1768, or so, may be\r\nimaginable for our purpose], as the King came riding along the Jager\r\nStrasse, there was visible near what is called the Furstenhaus,\" kind of\r\nBerlin Somerset House, [Nicolai, i. 155.] \"a great crowd of people. 'See\r\nwhat it is!' the King sent his one attendant, a heiduc or groom, into\r\nit, to learn what it was. 'They have something posted up about your\r\nMajesty,' reported the groom; and Friedrich, who by this time had ridden\r\nforward, took a look at the thing; which was a Caricature figure of\r\nhimself: King in very melancholy guise, seated on a Stool, a Coffee-mill\r\nbetween his knees; diligently grinding with the one hand, and with the\r\nother picking up any bean that might have fallen. 'Hang it lower,' said\r\nthe King, beckoning his groom with a wave of the finger: 'Lower, that\r\nthey may not have to hurt their necks about it!' No sooner were the\r\nwords spoken, which spread instantly, than there rose from the whole\r\ncrowd one universal huzza of joy. They tore the Caricature into a\r\nthousand pieces, and rolled after the King with loud (LEBE HOCH, Our\r\nFriedrich forever!' as he rode slowly away.\" [Preuss, iii. 275 (\"from\r\nBERLIN CONVERSUTIONSBLATT &c. of 1827, No. 253\").) That is their\r\nFriedrich's method with the Caricature Department. Heffner,\r\nKapellmeister in Upsala, reports this bit of memorability; he was then\r\nof the King's Music-Chapel in Berlin, and saw this with his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe King's tendency at all times, and his practice generally, when\r\nwe hear of it, was to take the people's side; so that gradually these\r\nFrench procedures were a great deal mitigated; and DIE REGIE--so they\r\ncalled this hateful new-fangled system of Excise machinery--became much\r\nmore supportable, \"the sorrows of it nothing but a tradition to the\r\nyounger sort,\" reports Dohm, who is extremely ample on this subject.\r\n[Christian Wilhelm von Dohm, _Denkwurdigkeiten meiner Zeit_ (Lemgo und\r\nHanover, 1819), iv. 500 et seq.] De Launay was honorably dismissed, and\r\nthe whole Regie abolished, a month or two after Friedrich's death.\r\n\r\nWith a splenetic satisfaction authentic Dohm, who sufficiently condemns\r\nthe REGIE, adds that it was not even successful; and shows by evidence,\r\nand computation to the uttermost farthing, that instead of two million\r\nthalers annually, it yielded on the average rather less than one. The\r\ndesired overplus of two millions, and a good deal more did indeed come\r\nin, says he: but it was owing to the great prosperity of Prussia at\r\nlarge, after the Seven-Years War; to the manifold industries awakening,\r\nwhich have gone on progressive ever since. Dohm declares farther, that\r\nthe very object was in a sort fanciful, nugatory; arguing that nobody\r\ndid attack Friedrich;--but omitting to prove that nobody would have done\r\nso, had Friedrich NOT stood ready to receive him. We will remark only,\r\nwhat is very indisputable, that Friedrich, owing to the Regie, or to\r\nother causes, did get the humble overplus necessary for him; and did\r\nstand ready for any war which might have come (and which did in a\r\nsort come); that he more and more relaxed the Regie, as it became less\r\nindispensable to him; and was willing, if he found the Caricatures and\r\nOpposition Placards too high posted, to save the poor reading people any\r\ntrouble that was possible.\r\n\r\nA French eye-witness testifies: \"They had no talent, these Regie\r\nfellows, but that of writing and ciphering; extremely conceited too, and\r\nwere capable of the most ridiculous follies. Once, for instance, they\r\ncondemned a common soldier, who had hidden some pounds of tobacco, to a\r\nfine of 200 thalers. The King, on reviewing it for confirmation, wrote\r\non the margin: 'Before confirming this sentence, I should wish to know\r\nwhere the Soldier, who gets 8 groschen [ninepence halfpenny] in the\r\n5 days, will find the 200 crowns for paying this Fine!'\" [Laveaux (2d\r\nedition), iii. 228.] Innumerable instances of a constant disposition\r\nthat way, on the King's part, stand on record. \"A crown a head on the\r\nimport of fat cattle, Tax on butcher's-meat?\" writes he once to De\r\nLaunay: \"No, that would fall on the poorer classes: to that I must\r\nsay No. I am, by office, Procurator of the Poor (L'AVOCAT DU PAUVRE).\"\r\nElsewhere it is \"AVOCAT DEC PAUVRE ET DU SOLDAT (of the working-man and\r\nof the soldier); and have to plead their cause.\" [Preuss, iii. 20.]\r\n\r\nWe will now give our Second Anecdote; which has less of memorability\r\nto us strangers at present, though doubtless it was then, in Berlin\r\nsociety, the more celebrated of the two; relating, as it did, to a high\r\nCourt-Lady, almost the highest, and who was herself only too celebrated\r\nin those years. The heroine is Princess Elizabeth of Brunswick, King's\r\nown Niece and a pretty woman; who for four years (14th July, 1765-18th\r\nApril, 1769) of her long life was Princess Royal of Prussia,--Wife of\r\nthat tall young Gentleman whom we used to see dancing about, whom we\r\nlast saw at Schweidnitz getting flung from his horse, on the day of\r\nPirch's saddle there:--his Wife for four years, but in the fourth year\r\nceased to be so [Rodenbeck, ii. 241, 257.] (for excellent reasons,\r\non both sides), and lived thenceforth in a divorced eclipsed state at\r\nStettin, where is laid the scene of our Anecdote. I understand it to be\r\nperfectly true; but cannot ascertain from any of the witnesses in what\r\nyear the thing happened; or whether it was at Stettin or Berlin,--though\r\nmy author has guessed, \"Stettin, in the Lady's divorced state,\" as\r\nappears.\r\n\r\n\"This Princess had commissioned, direct from Lyon, a very beautiful\r\ndress; which arrived duly, addressed to her at Stettin. As this kind of\r\nstuffs is charged with very heavy dues, the DOUANIER, head Custom-house\r\nPersonage of the Town, had the impertinence to detain the dress till\r\npayment were made. The Princess, in a lofty indignation, sent word to\r\nthis person, To bring the dress instantly, and she would pay the dues on\r\nit. He obeyed: but,\"--mark the result,--\"scarcely had the Princess got\r\neye on him, when she seized her Lyon Dress; and, giving the Douanier a\r\ncouple of good slaps on the face, ordered him out of her apartment and\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\"The Douanier, thinking himself one and somewhat, withdrew in high\r\ncholer; had a long PROCES-VERBAL of the thing drawn out; and sent it to\r\nthe King with eloquent complaint, 'That he had been dishonored in\r\ndoing the function appointed him.' Friedrich replied as follows: TO\r\nTHE DOUANIER AT STETTIN: 'The loss of the Excise-dues shall fall to my\r\nscore; the Dress shall remain with the Princess; the slaps to him who\r\nhas received them. As to the pretended Dishonor, I entirely relieve\r\nthe complainant from that: never can the appliance of a beautiful hand\r\ndishonor the face of an Officer of Customs.--F.'\" [Laveaux (abridged),\r\niii. 229.]\r\n\r\nNorthern Tourists, Wraxall and others, passing that way, speak of this\r\nPrincess, down to recent times, as a phenomenon of the place. Apparently\r\na high and peremptory kind of Lady, disdaining to be bowed too low by\r\nher disgraces. She survived all her generation, and the next and the\r\nnext, and indeed into our own. Died 18th February, 1840: at the age\r\nof ninety-six. Threescore and eleven years of that eclipsed Stettin\r\nExistence; this of the Lyon gown, and caitiff of a Custom-houser slapped\r\non the face, her one adventure put on record for us!--\r\n\r\nShe was signally blamable in that of the Divorce; but not she alone,\r\nnor first of the Two. Her Crown-Prince, Friedrich Wilhelm, called\r\nafterwards, as King, \"DER DICKE (the Fat, or the Big),\" and held in\r\nlittle esteem by Posterity,--a headlong, rather dark and physical\r\nkind of creature, though not ill-meaning or dishonest,--was himself a\r\ndreadful sinner in that department of things; and had BEGUN the bad\r\ngame against his poor Cousin and Spouse! Readers of discursive turn\r\nare perhaps acquainted with a certain \"Grafin von Lichtenau,\" and her\r\nMEMOIRS so called:--not willingly, but driven, I fish up one specimen,\r\nand one only, from that record of human puddles and perversities:--\r\n\r\n\"From the first year of our attachment,\" says this precious Grafin, \"I\r\nwas already the confidant of his,\" the Prince of Prussia's, \"most secret\r\nthoughts. One day [in 1767, second year of his married life, I then\r\nfifteen, slim Daughter of a Player on the French Horn, in his Majesty's\r\npay], the Prince happened to be very serious; and was owning to me with\r\nfrankness that he had some wrongs towards my sex to reproach himself\r\nwith,\"--alas, yes, some few:--\"and he swore that he would never forsake\r\nME; and that if Heaven disposed of my life before his, none but he\r\nshould close my eyes. He was fingering with a penknife at the time; he\r\nstruck the point of it into the palm of his left hand, and wrote with\r\nhis blood [the unclean creature], on a little bit of paper, the Oath\r\nwhich his lips had just pronounced in so solemn a tone. Vainly should I\r\nundertake to paint my emotion on this action of his! The Prince saw what\r\nI felt; and took advantage of it to beg that I would follow his example.\r\nI hastened to satisfy him; and traced, as he had done, with my blood,\r\nthe promise to remain his friend to the tomb, and never to forsake\r\nhim. This Promise must have been found among his Papers after his death\r\n[still in the Archives? we will hope not!]--Both of us stood faithful to\r\nthis Oath. The tie of love, it is true, we broke: but that was by mutual\r\nconsent, and the better to fix ourselves in the bonds of an inviolable\r\nfriendship. Other mistresses reigned over his senses; but I\"--ACH GOTT,\r\nno more of that. [_Memoires de la Comtesse de Lichtenau_ (a Londres,\r\nchez Colburn Libraire, Conduit-street, Bond-street, 2 tomes, small 8vo,\r\n1809), i. 129.]\r\n\r\nThe King's own account of the affair is sufficiently explicit. His words\r\nare: \"Not long ago [about two years before this of the penknife] we\r\nmentioned the Prince of Prussia's marriage with Elizabeth of Brunswick\r\n[his Cousin twice over, her Mother, Princess Charlotte of Prussia, being\r\nhis Father's Sister and mine, and her Father HIS Mother's Brother,--if\r\nyou like to count it]. This engagement, from which everybody had\r\nexpected happy consequences, did not correspond to the wishes of the\r\nRoyal House.\" Only one Princess could be realized (subsequently Wife to\r\nthe late Duke of York),--she came this same year of the penknife,--and\r\nbad outlooks for more. \"The Husband, young and dissolute (SANS MOEURS),\r\ngiven up to a crapulous life, from which his relatives could not correct\r\nhim, was continually committing infidelities to his Wife. The Princess,\r\nwho was in the flower of her beauty, felt outraged by such neglect\r\nof her charms; her vivacity, and the good opinion she had of herself,\r\nbrought her upon the thought of avenging her wrongs by retaliation.\r\nSpeedily she gave in to excesses, scarcely inferior to those of her\r\nHusband. Family quarrels broke out, and were soon publicly known. The\r\nantipathy that ensued took away all hope of succession [had it been\r\ndesirable in these sad circumstances!]. Prince Henri [JUNIOR, this\r\nhopeful Prince of Prussia's Brother], who was gifted with all the\r\nqualities to be wished in a young man [witness my tears for him], had\r\nbeen carried off by small-pox. [\"26th May, 1767,\" age 19 gone; ELOGE\r\nof him by Friedrich (\"MS. still stained with tears\"), in _OEuvres de\r\nFrederic_, vii. 37 et seq.] The King's Brothers, Princes Henri and\r\nFerdinand, avowed frankly that they would never consent to have, by some\r\naccidental bastard, their rights of succession to the crown carried\r\noff. In the end, there was nothing for it but proceeding to a divorce.\"\r\n[_OEuvres de Frederic,_ vi. 23.]\r\n\r\nDivorce was done in a beautiful private manner; case tried with strictly\r\nshut doors; all the five judges under oath to carry into the grave\r\nwhatever they came to know of it: [Preuss, iv. 180-186.] divorce\r\ncompleted 18th April, 1769; and, within three months, a new marriage\r\nwas accomplished, Princess Frederika Luisa of Hessen-Darmstadt the happy\r\nwoman. By means of whom there was duly realized a Friedrich Wilhelm, who\r\nbecame \"King Friedrich Wilhelm III.\" (a much-enduring, excellent, though\r\ninarticulate man), as well as various other Princes and Princesses,\r\nin spite of interruptions from the Lichtenau Sisterhood. High-souled\r\nElizabeth was relegated to Stettin; her amount of Pension is not\r\nmentioned; her Family, after the unhappy proofs communicated to them,\r\nhad given their consent and sanction;--and she stayed there, idle, or\r\nher own mistress of work, for the next seventy-one years.--Enough of HER\r\nLyon Dress, surely, and of the Excise system altogether!--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEUE PALAIS, IN SANS-SOUCI NEIGHBORHOOD, IS FOUNDED AND FINISHED\r\n(1763-1770).\r\n\r\nIf D'Alembert's Visit was the germ of the Excise system, it will be\r\ncurious to note,--and indeed whether or not, it will be chronologically\r\nserviceable to us here, and worth noting,--that there went on a small\r\nsynchronous affair, still visible to everybody: namely, That in the very\r\nhours while Friedrich and D'Alembert were saluting mutually at Geldern\r\n(11th June, 1763), there was laid the foundation of what they call the\r\nNEUE PALAIS; New Palace of Sans-Souci: [Rodenbeck, ii. 219.] a sumptuous\r\nEdifice, in the curious LOUIS-QUINZE or what is called \"Rococo\" style\r\nof the time; Palace never much inhabited by Friedrich or his successors,\r\nwhich still stands in those ornamental Potsdam regions. Why built,\r\nespecially in the then down-pressed financial circumstances, some have\r\nhad their difficulties to imagine. It appears, this New Palace had been\r\ndetermined on before the War broke out; and Friedrich said to\r\nhimself: \"We will build it now, to help the mechanical classes in\r\nBerlin,--perhaps also, in part [think some, and why should not they, a\r\nlittle?] to show mankind that we have still ready money; and are nothing\r\nlike so ruined as they fancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"This NEUE PALAIS,\" says one recent Tourist, \"is a pleasant quaint\r\nobject, nowadays, to the stranger. It has the air DEGAGE POCOCURANTE;\r\npleasantly fine in aspect and in posture;--spacious expanses round\r\nit, not in a waste, but still less in a strict condition; and (in its\r\ndeserted state) has a silence, especially a total absence of needless\r\nflunkies and of gaping fellow-loungers, which is charming. Stands mute\r\nthere, in its solitude, in its stately silence and negligence, like\r\nsome Tadmor of the Wilderness in small. The big square of Stables,\r\nCoach-houses, near by, was locked up,--probably one sleeping groom in\r\nit. The very CUSTOS of the grand Edifice (such the rarity of fees to\r\nhim) I could not awaken without difficulty. In the gray autumn zephyrs,\r\nno sound whatever about this New Palace of King Friedrich's, except the\r\nrustle of the crisp brown leaves, and of any faded or fading memories\r\nyou may have.\r\n\r\n\"I should say,\" continues he, \"it somehow reminds you of the City of\r\nBath. It has the cut of a battered Beau of old date; Beau still extant,\r\nthough in strangely other circumstances; something in him of pathetic\r\ndignity in that kind. It shows excellent sound masonries; which have\r\nan over-tendency to jerk themselves into pinnacles, curvatures and\r\ngraciosities; many statues atop,--three there are, in a kind of grouped\r\nor partnership attitude; 'These,' said diligent scandal, 'note them;\r\nthese mean Maria Theresa, Pompadour and CATIN DU NORD' (mere Muses, I\r\nbelieve, or of the Nymph or Hamadryad kind, nothing of harm in them).\r\nIn short, you may call it the stone Apotheosis of an old French Beau.\r\nConsiderably weather-beaten (the brown of lichens spreading visibly\r\nhere and there, the firm-set ashlar telling you, 'I have stood a hundred\r\nyears');--Beau old and weather-beaten, with his cocked-hat not in the\r\nfresh condition, all his gold-laces tarnished; and generally looking\r\nstrange, and in a sort tragical, to find himself, fleeting\r\ncreature, become a denizen of the Architectural Fixities and earnest\r\nEternities!\"--\r\n\r\nFrom Potsdam Palace to the New Palace of Sans-Souci may be a mile\r\ndistance; flat ground, parallel to the foot of Hills; all through\r\narbors, parterres, water-works, and ornamental gardenings and cottagings\r\nor villa-ings,--Cottage-Villa for Lord Marischal is one of them. This\r\nmile of distance, taking the COTTAGE Royal of Sans-Souci on its\r\nhill-top as vertex, will be the base of an isosceles or nearly isosceles\r\ntriangle, flatter than equilateral. To the Cottage Royal of Sans-Souci\r\nmay be about three-quarters of a mile northeast from this New Palace,\r\nand from Potsdam Palace to it rather less. And the whole square-mile or\r\nso of space is continuously a Garden, not in the English sense, though\r\nit has its own beauties of the more artificial kind; and, at any rate,\r\nhas memories for you, and footsteps of persons still unforgotten by\r\nmankind.--Here is a Notice of Lord Marischal; which readers will not\r\ngrudge; the chronology of the worthy man, in these his later epochs,\r\nbeing in so hazy a state:--\r\n\r\nLord Marischal, we know well and Pitt knows, was in England in\r\n1761,--ostensibly on the Kintore Heritage; and in part, perhaps, really\r\non that errand. But he went and came, at dates now uncertain; was back\r\nin Spain after that, had difficult voyagings about; [King's Letters to\r\nhim, in _OEuvres de Frederic,_ xx. 282-285.]--and did not get to rest\r\nagain, in his Government of Neufchatel, till April, 1762. There is a\r\nLetter of the King's, which at least fixes that point:--\r\n\r\n\"BRESLAU, 10th APRIL, 1762. My nose is the most impertinent nose in\r\nthe universe, MON CHER MYLORD [Queen-Dowager snuff, SPANIOL from\r\nthe fountain-head, of Marischal's providing; quality exquisite, but\r\ndifficult to get transmitted in the Storms of War]; I am ashamed of the\r\ntrouble it costs you! I beg many pardons;--and should be quite abashed,\r\ndid I not know how you compassionate the weak points of your friends,\r\nand that, for a long time past, you have a singular indulgence for my\r\nnose. I am very glad to know you happily returned to your Government,\r\nsafe at Colombier (DOVE-COTE) in Neufchatel again.\" This is 10th April,\r\n1762. There, as I gather, quiet in his Dove-cote, Marischal continued,\r\nthough rather weary of the business, for about a year more; or till the\r\nKing got home,--who delights in companionship, and is willing to let an\r\nold man demit for good.\r\n\r\nIt was in Summer, 1762 (about three months after the above Letter from\r\nthe King), that Rousseau made his celebrated exodus into Neufchatel\r\nCountry, and found the old Governor so good to him,--glad to be allowed\r\nto shelter the poor skinless creature. And, mark as curious, it must\r\nhave been on two of those mornings, towards the end of the Siege of\r\nSchweidnitz, when things were getting so intolerable, and at times\r\nbreaking out into electricity, into \"rebuke all round,\" that Friedrich\r\nreceived that singular pair of Laconic Notes from Rousseau in\r\nNeufchatel: forwarded, successively, by Lord Marischal; NOTE FIRST, of\r\ndate, \"Motier-Travers, Neufchatel, September,\" nobody can guess what\r\nday, \"1762:\" \"I have said much ill of you, and don't repent it. Now\r\neverybody has banished me; and it is on your threshold that I sit down.\r\nKill me, if you have a mind!\" And then (after, not death, but the gift\r\nof 100 crowns), NOTE SECOND, \"October, 1762:\"... \"Take out of my sight\r\nthat sword, which dazzles and pains me; IT has only too well done its\r\nduty, while the sceptre is abandoned:\" Make Peace, can't you! [_OEuvres\r\ncompletes de Rousseau_ (a Geneve, 1782-1789), xxxiii. 64, 65.]--What\r\ncurious reading for a King in such posture, among the miscellaneous\r\narrivals overnight! Above six weeks before either of these NOTES,\r\nFriedrich, hearing of him from Lord Marischal, had answered: \"An asylum?\r\nYes, by all means: the unlucky cynic!\" It is on September 1st, that he\r\nsends, by the same channel, 100 crowns for his use, with advice to \"give\r\nthem in NATURA, lest he refuse otherwise;\" as Friedrich knows to be\r\npossible. In words, the Rousseau Notes got nothing of Answer. \"A GARCON\r\nSINGULIER,\" says Friedrich: odd fellow, yes indeed, your Majesty;--and\r\nhas such a pungency of flattery in him too, presented in the way of\r\nsnarl! His Majesty might take him, I suppose, with a kind of relish,\r\nlike Queen-Dowager snuff.\r\n\r\nThere was still another shift of place, shift which proved temporary,\r\nin old Marischal's life: Home to native Aberdeenshire. The two childless\r\nBrothers, Earls of Kintore, had died successively, the last of them\r\nNovember 22d, 1761: title and heritage, not considerable the latter,\r\nfell duly, by what preparatives we know, to old Marischal; but his Keith\r\nkinsfolk, furthermore, would have him personally among them,--nay, after\r\nthat, would have him to wed and produce new Keiths. At the age of 78;\r\ndecidedly an inconvenient thing! Old Marischal left Potsdam \"August,\r\n1763,\" [Letter of his to the King (\"LONDRES, 14 AOUT, 1763\"), in\r\n_OEuvres de Frederic,_ xx. 293.--In _Letters of Eminent Persons to\r\nDavid Hume_ (Edinburgh, 1849), pp. 57-71, are some Nine from the Old\r\nMarischal; in curiously mixed dialect, cheerful, but indistinct; the two\r\nchief dates of which are: \"Touch\" (guttural TuCH, in Aberdeenshire),\r\n\"28 October, 1763,\" and \"Potsdam, 20 February, 1765.\"]--NEW-PALACE\r\nscaffoldings and big stone blocks conspicuous in those localities;\r\npleasant D'Alembert now just about leaving, in the other\r\ndirection;--much to Friedrich's regret, the old Marischal especially, as\r\nis still finely evident.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH TO LORD MARISCHAL (in Scotland for the last six months).\r\n\r\n\"SANS-SOUCI, 16th February, 1764.\r\n\r\n\"I am not surprised that the Scotch fight to have you among them; and\r\nwish to have progeny of yours, and to preserve your bones. You have in\r\nyour lifetime the lot of Homer after death: Cities arguing which is your\r\nbirthplace;--I myself would dispute it with Edinburgh to possess you.\r\nIf I had ships, I would make a descent on Scotland, to steal off my CHER\r\nMYLORD, and bring him hither. Alas, our Elbe Boats can't do it. But you\r\ngive me hopes;--which I seize with avidity! I was your late Brother's\r\nfriend, and had obligations to him; I am yours with heart and soul.\r\nThese are my titles, these are my rights:--you sha'n't be forced in\r\nthe matter of progeny here (FAIRE L'ETALON ICI), neither priests nor\r\nattorneys shall meddle with you; you shall live here in the bosom of\r\nfriendship, liberty and philosophy.\" Come to me!...--F. [_OEuvres de\r\nFrederic,_ xx. 295.]\r\n\r\nOld Marischal did come; and before long. I know not the precise month:\r\nbut \"his Villa-Cottage was built for him,\" the Books say, \"in 1764.\" He\r\nhad left D'Alembert just going; next year he will find Helvetius coming.\r\nHe lived here, a great treasure to Friedrich, till his death, 25th May,\r\n1778, age 92.\r\n\r\nThe New Palace was not finished till 1770;--in which year, also,\r\nFriedrich reckons that the general Problem of Repairing Prussia was\r\nvictoriously over. New Palace, growing or complete, looks down on all\r\nthese operations and occurrences. In its cradle, it sees D'Alembert go,\r\nLord Marischal go; Helvetius come, Lord Marischal come; in its\r\nboyhood or maturity, the Excise, and French RATS-DE-CAVE, spring up;\r\nCrown-Prince Friedrich Wilhelm prick his hand for a fit kind of ink;\r\nFriedrich Wilhelm's Divorced Wife give her Douanier two slaps in\r\nthe face, by way of payment. Nay, the same Friedrich Wilhelm, become\r\n\"Friedrich Wilhelm II., or DER DICKE,\" died in it,--his Lichtenau AND\r\nhis second Wife, jewel of women, nursing him in his last sickness there.\r\n[\"Died 16th November, 1797.\"]\r\n\r\nThe violent stress of effort for repairing Prussia, Friedrich intimates,\r\nwas mostly over in 1766: till which date specifically, and in a looser\r\nsense till 1770, that may be considered as his main business. But it was\r\nnot at any time his sole business; nor latterly at all equal in interest\r\nto some others that had risen on him, as the next Chapter will now\r\nshow. Here, first, is a little Fraction of NECROLOGY, which may be worth\r\ntaking with us. Readers can spread these fateful specialties over the\r\nPeriod in question; and know that each of them came with a kind of\r\nknell upon Friedrich's heart, whatever he might be employed about.\r\nHour striking after hour on the Horologe of Time; intimating how the\r\nAfternoon wore, and that Night was coming. Various meanings there would\r\nbe to Friedrich in these footfalls of departing guests, the dear, the\r\nless dear, and the indifferent or hostile; but each of them would mean:\r\n\"Gone, then, gone; thus we all go!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"OBITUARY IN FRIEDRICH'S CIRCLE TILL 1771.\"\r\n\r\nOf Polish Majesty's death (5th October, 1763), and then (2d December\r\nfollowing) of his Kurprinz or Successor's, with whom we dined at\r\nMoritzburg so recently, there will be mention by and by. November 28th,\r\n1763, in the interval between these two, the wretched Bruhl had died.\r\nApril 14th, 1764, died the wretched Pompadour;--\"To us not known, JE NE\r\nLA CONNAIS PAS:\"--hapless Butterfly, she had been twenty years in the\r\nwinged condition; age now forty-four: dull Louis, they say, looked out\r\nof window as her hearse departed, \"FROIDEMENT,\" without emotion of any\r\nvisible kind. These little concern Friedrich or us; we will restrict\r\nourselves to Friends.\r\n\r\n\"DIED IN 1764. At Pisa, Algarotti (23d May, 1764, age fifty-two); with\r\nwhom Friedrich has always had some correspondence hitherto (to himself\r\ninteresting, though not to us), and will never henceforth have more.\r\nFriedrich raised a Monument to him; Monument still to be seen in the\r\nCampo-Santo of Pisa: 'HIC JACET OVIDII AEMULUS ET NEUTONI DISCIPULUS;'\r\nfriends have added 'FREDERICUS MAGNUS PONI FECIT;' and on another part\r\nof the Monument, 'ALGAROTTUS NON OMNIS.' [Preuss, iv. 188.]\r\n\r\n\"--IN 1765. At the age of eighty, November 18th, Grafin Camas, 'MA BONNE\r\nMAMAN' (widow since 1741); excellent old Lady,--once brilliantly young,\r\nGerman by birth, her name Brandt;--to whom the King's LETTERS used to\r\nbe so pretty.\" This same year, too, Kaiser Franz died; but him we will\r\nreserve, as not belonging to this Select List.\r\n\r\n\"--IN 1766. At Nanci, 23d February, age eighty-six, King Stanislaus\r\nLeczinsky: 'his clothes caught fire' (accidental spark or sputter on\r\nsome damask dressing-gown or the like); and the much-enduring innocent\r\nold soul ended painfully his Titular career.\r\n\r\n\"DIED IN 1767. October 22d, the Grand-Duchess of Sachsen-Gotha, age\r\nfifty-seven; a sad stroke this also, among one's narrowing List of\r\nFriends.--I doubt if Friedrich ever saw this high Lady after the Visit\r\nwe lately witnessed. His LETTERS to her are still in the Archives of\r\nGotha: not hers to him; all lost, these latter, but an accidental\r\nTwo, which are still beautiful in their kind. [Given in _OEuvres de\r\nFrederic,_ xviii. 165, 256.]\r\n\r\n\"--IN 1770. Bielfeld, the fantastic individual of old days. Had long\r\nbeen out of Friedrich's circle,--in Altenburg Country, I think;--without\r\nimportance to Friedrich or us: the year of him will do, without search\r\nfor day or month.\r\n\r\n\"---IN 1771. Two heavy deaths come this year. January 28th, 1771, at\r\nBerlin, dies our valuable old friend Excellency Mitchell,--still here on\r\nthe part of England, in cordial esteem as a man and companion; though\r\nas Minister, I suppose, with function more and more imaginary. This\r\npainfully ushers in the year. To usher it out, there is still worse:\r\nfaithful D'Argens dies, 26th December, 1771, on a visit in his native\r\nProvence,--leaving, as is still visible, [Friedrich's two Letters to the\r\nWidow (Ib. xix. 427-429).] a big and sad blank behind him at Potsdam.\"\r\nBut we need not continue; at least not at present.\r\n\r\nLong before all these, Friedrich had lost friends; with a sad but quiet\r\nemotion he often alludes to this tragic fact, that all the souls he\r\nloved most are gone. His Winterfelds, his Keiths, many loved faces, the\r\nWar has snatched: at Monbijou, at Baireuth, it was not War; but they too\r\nare gone. Is the world becoming all a Mausoleum, then; nothing of divine\r\nin it but the Tombs of vanished loved ones? Friedrich makes no noise on\r\nsuch subjects: loved and unloved alike must go.\r\n\r\nWe have still to mark Kaiser Franz's sudden death; a thing politically\r\ninteresting, if not otherwise. August, 1765, at Innspruck, during the\r\nMarriage-festivities of his Second Son, Leopold (Duke of Florence, who\r\nafterwards, on Joseph's death, was Kaiser),--Kaiser Franz, sauntering\r\nabout in the evening gala, \"18th August, about 9 P.M.,\" suddenly\r\ntottered, staggered as falling; fell into Son Joseph's arms; and was\r\ndead. Above a year before, this same Joseph, his Eldest Son, had\r\nbeen made King of the Romans: \"elected 26th March; crowned 3d April,\r\n1764;\"--Friedrich furthering it, wishful to be friendly with his late\r\nenemies. [Rodenbeck, ii. 234.]\r\n\r\nOn this Innspruck Tragedy, Joseph naturally became Kaiser,--Part-Kaiser;\r\nhis Dowager-Mother, on whom alone it depends, having decided that way.\r\nThe poor Lady was at first quite overwhelmed with her grief. She had the\r\ndeath-room of her Husband made into a Chapel; she founded furthermore a\r\nMonastery in Innspruck, \"Twelve Canonesses to pray there for the repose\r\nof Franz;\" was herself about to become Abbess there, and quit the\r\nsecular world; but in the end was got persuaded to continue, and take\r\nSon Joseph as Coadjutor. [Hormayr, OESTERREICHISCHER PLUTARCH (º Maria\r\nTheresa), iv. (2tes Bandchen) 6-124; MARIA THERESIENS LEBEN, p. 30.] In\r\nwhich capacity we shall meet the young man again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III.--TROUBLES IN POLAND.\r\n\r\nApril 11th, 1764, one year after his Seven-Years labor of Hercules,\r\nFriedrich made Treaty of Alliance with the new Czarina Catharine.\r\nEngland had deserted him; France was his enemy, especially Pompadour and\r\nChoiseul, and refused reconcilement, though privately solicited: he was\r\nwithout an Ally anywhere. The Russians had done him frightful damage in\r\nthe last War, and were most of all to be dreaded in the case of any new\r\none. The Treaty was a matter of necessity as well as choice. Agreement\r\nfor mutual good neighborhood and friendly offices; guarantee of each\r\nother against intrusive third parties: should either get engaged in war\r\nwith any neighbor, practical aid to the length of 12,000 men, or else\r\nmoney in lieu. Treaty was for eight years from day of date.\r\n\r\nAs Friedrich did not get into war, and Catharine did, with the Turks and\r\ncertain loose Polacks, the burden of fulfilment happened to fall wholly\r\non Friedrich; and he was extremely punctual in performance,--eager now,\r\nand all his life after, to keep well with such a Country under such a\r\nCzarina. Which proved to be the whole rule of his policy on that Russian\r\nside. \"Good that Country cannot bring me by any quarrel with it; evil\r\nit can, to a frightful extent, in case of my quarrelling with others! Be\r\nwary, be punctual, magnanimously polite, with that grandiose Czarina and\r\nher huge territories and notions:\" this was Friedrich's constant rule\r\nin public and in private. Nor is it thought his CORRESPONDENCE WITH\r\nTHE EMPRESS CATHARINE, when future generations see it in print,\r\nwill disclose the least ground of offence to that high-flying Female\r\nPotentate of the North. Nor will it ever be known what the silently\r\nobservant Friedrich thought of her, except indeed what we already know,\r\nor as good as know, That he, if anybody did, saw her clearly enough for\r\nwhat she was; and found good to repress into absolute zero whatever had\r\nno bearing upon business, and might by possibility give offence in that\r\nquarter. For we are an old King, and have learned by bitter experiences!\r\nNo more nicknames, biting verses, or words which a bird of the air could\r\ncarry; though this poor Lady too has her liabilities, were not we old\r\nand prudent;--and is entirely as weak on certain points (deducting the\r\ndevotions and the brandy-and-water) as some others were! The Treaty\r\nwas renewed when necessary; and continued valid and vital in every\r\nparticular, so long as Friedrich ruled.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the first eight years, by strictly following this passive\r\nrule, Friedrich, in counterbalance of his losses, unexpectedly found\r\nhimself invested with a very singular bit of gain,--\"unjust gain!\" cried\r\nall men, making it of the nature of gain and loss to him,--which is\r\nstill practically his, and which has made, and makes to this day, an\r\nimmense noise in the world. Everybody knows we mean West-Preussen;\r\nPartition of Poland; bloodiest picture in the Book of Time, Sarmatia's\r\nfall unwept without a crime;--and that we have come upon a very\r\nintricate part of our poor History.\r\n\r\nNo prudent man--especially if to himself, as is my own poor case\r\nin regard to it, the subject have long been altogether dead and\r\nindifferent--would wish to write of the Polish Question. For almost a\r\nhundred years the Polish Question has been very loud in the world; and\r\never and anon rises again into vocality among Able Editors, as a thing\r\npretending not to be dead and buried, but capable of rising again, and\r\nsetting itself right, by good effort at home and abroad. Not advisable,\r\nbeyond the strict limits of compulsion, to write of it at present! The\r\nrather as the History of it, any History we have, is not an intelligible\r\nseries of events, but a series of vociferous execrations, filling all\r\nNature, with nothing left to the reader but darkness, and such remedies\r\nagainst despair as he himself can summon or contrive.\r\n\r\n\"Rulhiere's on that subject,\" says a Note which I may cite, \"is the\r\nonly articulate-speaking Book to which mankind as yet can apply; [Cl.\r\nRulhiere, _Histoire de l'Anarchie de Pologne_ (Paris, 1807), 4 vols.\r\n12mo.] and they will by no means find that a sufficient one. Rulhiere's\r\nBook has its considerable merits; but it absolutely wants those of a\r\nHistory; and can be recognized by no mind as an intelligible cosmic\r\nPortraiture of that chaotic Mass of Occurrences: chronology, topography,\r\nprecision of detail by time and place; scene, and actors on scene,\r\nremain unintelligible. Rulhiere himself knew Poland, at least had looked\r\non it from Warsaw outwards, year after year, and knew of it what an\r\ninquiring Secretary of Legation could pick up on those terms, which\r\nperhaps, after all, is not very much. His Narrative is drowned in\r\nbeautiful seas of description and reflection; has neither dates nor\r\nreferences; and advances at an intolerable rate of slowness; in fact,\r\nrather turns on its axis than advances; produces on you the effect of a\r\nmelodious Sonata, not of a lucid and comfortably instructive History.\r\n\r\n\"I forget for how long Rulhiere had been in Poland, as Ambassador's\r\nAssistant: but the Country, the King and leading Personages were\r\npersonally known to him, more or less; Events with all details of them\r\nwere known: 'Why not write a History of the Anarchy and Wreck they fell\r\ninto?' said the Official people to him, on his return home: 'For behoof\r\nof the Dauphin [who is to be Louis XVI. shortly]; may not he perhaps\r\ndraw profit from it? At the top of the Universe, experience is sometimes\r\nwanted. Here are the Archives, here is Salary, here are what appliances\r\nyou like to name: Write!' It is well known he was appointed, on a\r\nPension of 250 pounds a year, with access to all archives, documents and\r\nappliances in possession of the French Government, and express charge to\r\ndelineate this subject for benefit of the Dauphin's young mind. Nor can\r\nI wonder, considering everything, that the process on Rulhiere's part,\r\nbeing so full of difficulties, was extremely deliberate; that this Book\r\ndid not grow so steadily or fast as the Dauphin did; and that in\r\nfact the poor Dauphin never got the least benefit from it,--being\r\nguillotined, he, in 1793, and the Book intended for him never coming to\r\nlight for fourteen years afterwards, it too in a posthumous and still\r\nunfinished condition.\r\n\r\n\"Rulhiere has heard the voices of rumor, knows an infinitude of events\r\nthat were talked of; but has not discriminated which were the vital,\r\nwhich were the insignificant; treats the vital and the insignificant\r\nalike; seldom with satisfactory precision; mournfully seldom giving\r\nany date, and by no chance any voucher or authority;--and instead of\r\npractical terrestrial scene of action, with distances, milestones,\r\ndefinite sequence of occurrences, and of causes and effects, paints us\r\na rosy cloudland, which if true at all, as he well intends it to be, is\r\nlittle more than symbolically or allegorically so; and can satisfy no\r\nclear-headed Dauphin or man. Rulhiere strives to be authentic,\r\ntoo; gives you no suspicion of his fairness. There is really fine\r\nhigh-colored painting in Rulhiere! and you hope always he will let you\r\ninto the secret of the matter: but the sad fact is, he never does. He\r\nmerely loses himself in picturesque details, philosophic eloquences,\r\nelegancies; takes you to a Castle of Choczim, a Monastery of\r\nCzenstochow, a Bay of Tschesme, and lets off extensive fire-works that\r\ncontain little or no shot; leads you on trackless marches, inroads or\r\noutroads, through the Lithuanian Peat-bogs, on daring adventures and\r\nhair-breadth escapes of mere Pulawski, Potocki and the like;--had not\r\ngot to understand the matter himself, you perceive: how hopeless to make\r\nyou understand it!\"\r\n\r\nEnglish readers, however, have no other shift; the rest of the Books I\r\nhave seen,--_Histoire des Revolutions de Pologne;_ [1778 (A WARSOVIE, ET\r\nSE TROUVE A PARIS), 2 vols. 8vo.] _Histoire des Trois Demembremens de la\r\nPologne;_ [Anonymous (by one FERRAND, otherwise unknown to me), Paris,\r\n1820, 3 vols. 8vo.] _Letters on Poland;_ [Anonymous (by a \"Reverend\r\nMr. Lindsey,\" it would seem), LETTERS CONCERNING THE PRESENT STATE OF\r\nPOLAND, TOGETHER WITH &c. (London, 1773; 1 vol. 8vo): of these LETTERS,\r\nor at least of Reverend Lindsey, Author of them, \"Tutor to King\r\nStanislaus's Nephew,\" and a man of painfully loud loose tongue, there\r\nmay perhaps be mention afterwards.] and many more,--are not worth\r\nmentioning at all. Comfortable in the mad dance of these is Hermann's\r\nrecent dull volume; [Hermann, _Geschichte des Russischen Staats,_ vol.\r\nv. (already cited in regard to the Peter-Catharine tragedy); seems to be\r\ncompiled mainly from the Saxon Archives, from DESPATCHES written on\r\nthe spot and at the time.]--commonplace, dull, but steady and faithful;\r\nyielding us at least dates, and an immunity from noise. By help of\r\nHermann and the others, distilled to CAPUT MORTUUM, a few dated facts\r\n(cardinal we dare not call them) may be extracted;--dimly out of these,\r\nto the meditating mind, some outline of the phenomenon may begin to\r\nbecome conceivable. King of Poland dies; and there ensue huge Anarchies\r\nin that Country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKING OF POLAND DIES; AND THERE ENSUE HUGE ANARCHIES IN THAT COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nThe poor old King of Poland--whom we saw, on that fall of the curtain\r\nat Pirna seven years ago, rush off for Warsaw with his Bruhl, with\r\nexpressive speed and expressive silence, and who has been waiting there\r\never since, sublimely confident that his powerful terrestrial friends,\r\nAustria, Russia, France, not to speak of Heaven's justice at all, would\r\nexact due penalty, of signal and tremendous nature, on the Prussian\r\nAggressor--has again been disappointed. The poor old Gentleman got no\r\ncompensation for his manifold losses and woes at Pirna or elsewhere; not\r\nthe least mention of such a thing, on the final winding-up of that War\r\nof Seven Years, in which his share had been so tragical; no alleviation\r\nwas provided for him in this world. His sorrows in Poland have been\r\nmanifold; nothing but anarchies, confusions and contradictions had been\r\nhis Royal portion there: in about Forty different Diets he had tried to\r\nget some business done,--no use asking what; for the Diets, one and\r\nall, exploded in NIE POZWALAM; and could do no business, good, bad or\r\nindifferent, for him or anybody. An unwise, most idle Country; following\r\nas chief employment perpetual discrepancy with its idle unwise King and\r\nself; Russia the virtual head of it this long while, so far as it has\r\nany head.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY-AUGUST, 1763, just while the Treaty of Hubertsburg was blessing\r\neverybody with the return of Peace, and for long months after Peace had\r\nreturned to everybody, Polish Majesty was in sore trouble. Trouble in\r\nregard to Courland, to his poor Son Karl, who fancied himself elected,\r\nunder favor and permission of the late Czarina our gracious Protectress\r\nand Ally, to the difficult post of Duke in Courland; and had proceeded,\r\nthree or four years ago, to take possession,--but was now interrupted\r\nby Russian encroachments and violences. Not at all well disposed to him,\r\nthese new Peters, new Catharines. They have recalled their Bieren from\r\nSiberia; declare that old Bieren is again Duke, or at least that young\r\nBieren is, and not Saxon Karl at all; and have proceeded, Czarina\r\nCatharine has, to install him forcibly with Russian soldiers. Karl\r\ndeclares, \"You shall kill ME before you or he get into this Palace of\r\nMietau!\"--and by Domestics merely, and armed private Gentlemen, he does\r\nmaintain himself in said Palatial Mansion; valiantly indignant, for\r\nabout six months; the Russian Battalions girdling him on all sides,\r\nminatory more and more, but loath to begin actual bloodshed. [Rulhiere,\r\nii. (livre v.) 81 et antea; Hermann, v. 348 et seq.] A transaction very\r\nfamed in those parts, and still giving loud voice in the Polish Books,\r\nwhich indeed get ever noisier from this point onward, till they end in\r\ninarticulate shrieks, as we shall too well hear.\r\n\r\nEmpress Catharine, after the lapse of six months, sends an Ambassador\r\nto Warsaw (Kayserling by name), who declares, in tone altogether\r\nimperative, that Czarish Majesty feels herself weary of such contumacy,\r\nweary generally of Polish Majesty's and Polish Republic's multifarious\r\ncontumacies; and, in fine, cruelest of all, that she has troops on the\r\nfrontier; that Courland is not the only place where she has troops.\r\nWhat a stab to the poor old man! \"Contumacies?\" Has not he been Russia's\r\npatient stepping-stone, all along; his anarchic Poland and he accordant\r\nin that, if in nothing else? \"Let us to Saxony,\" decides he passionately,\r\n\"and leave all this.\" In Saxony his poor old Queen is dead long since;\r\nmuch is dead: Saxony and Life generally, what a Golgotha! He immediately\r\nsends word to Karl, \"Give up Courland; I am going home!\"--and did\r\nhastily make his packages, and bid adieu to Warsaw, and, in a few weeks\r\nafter to this anarchic world altogether. Died at Dresden, 5th October,\r\n1763.\r\n\r\nPolish Majesty had been elected 5th October, 1733; died, you observe,\r\n5th October, 1763;--was King of Poland (\"King,\" save the mark!) for 30\r\nyears to a day. Was elected--do readers still remember how? Leaves a\r\nruined Saxony lying round him; a ruined life mutely asking him, \"Couldst\r\nthou have done no better, then?\" Wretched Bruhl followed him in four or\r\nfive weeks. Nay, in about two months, his Son and Successor, \"Friedrich\r\nChristian\" (with whom we dined at Moritzburg), had followed him; [Prince\r\ndied 17th December (Bruhl, 18th November), 1763.] leaving a small\r\nBoy, age 13, as new Kurfurst, \"Friedrich August\" the name of him, with\r\nguardians to manage the Minority; especially with his Mother as chief\r\nguardian,--of whom, for two reasons, we are now to say something. Reason\r\nFIRST is, That she is really a rather brilliant, distinguished creature,\r\ndistinguished more especially in Friedrich's world; whose LETTERS to\r\nher are numerous, and, in their kind, among the notablest he wrote;--of\r\nwhich we would gladly give some specimen, better or worse; and reason\r\nSECOND, That in so doing, we may contrive to look, for a moment or two,\r\ninto the preliminary Polish Anarchies at first-hand; and, transiently\r\nand far off, see something of them as if with our own eyes.\r\n\r\nMarie-Antoine, or Marie-Antoinette, Electress of Saxony, is still a\r\nbright Lady, and among the busiest living; now in her 40th year: \"born\r\n17th July, 1724; second child of Kaiser Karl VII.;\"--a living memento to\r\nus of those old times of trouble. Papa, when she came to him, was in his\r\n27th year; this was his second daughter; three years afterwards he had\r\na son (born 1727; died 1777), who made the \"Peace of Fussen,\" to\r\nFriedrich's disgust, in 1745, if readers recollect;--and who, dying\r\nchildless, will give rise to another War (the \"Potato War\" so called),\r\nfor Friedrich's behoof and ours. This little creature would be in\r\nher teens during that fatal Kaisership (1742-1745, her age then\r\n18-21),--during those triumphs, flights and furnished-lodging\r\nintricacies. Her Mamma, whom we have seen, a little fat bullet given to\r\ndevotion, was four years younger than Papa. Mamma died \"11th December,\r\n1756,\" Germany all blazing out in War again; she had been a Widow eleven\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nMarie-Antoine was wedded to Friedrich Christian, Saxon Kurprinz, \"20th\r\nJune, 1747;\" her age 23, his 25:--Chronology itself is something, if\r\none will attend to it, in the absence of all else! The young pair were\r\nCousins, their Mothers being Sisters; Polish Majesty one's Uncle, age\r\nnow 51,--who was very fond of us, poor indolent soul, and glad of\r\nour company on an afternoon, \"being always in his dressing-gown by 2\r\no'clock.\" Concerning which the tongue of Court scandal was not entirely\r\nidle,--Hanbury chronicling, as we once noticed. All which I believe to\r\nbe mere lying wind. The young Princess was beautiful; extremely clever,\r\ngraceful and lively, we can still see for ourselves: no wonder poor\r\nPolish Majesty, always in his dressing-gown by 2, was charmed to have\r\nher company,--the rather as I hope she permitted him a little smoking\r\nwithal.\r\n\r\nHer husband was crook-backed; and, except those slight, always perfectly\r\npolite little passages, in Schmettau's Siege (1759), in the Hubertsburg\r\nTreaty affair, in the dinner at Moritzburg, I never heard much history\r\nof him. He became Elector 5th October, 1763; but enjoyed the dignity\r\nlittle more than two months. Our Princess had borne him seven\r\nchildren,--three boys, four girls,--the eldest about 13, a Boy, who\r\nsucceeded; the youngest a girl, hardly 3. The Boy is he who sent Gellert\r\nthe caparisoned Horse, and had estafettes on the road while Gellert lay\r\ndying. This Boy lived to be 77, and saw strange things in the world; had\r\nseen Napoleon and the French Revolution; was the first \"King of Saxony\"\r\nso called; saw Jena, retreat of Moscow; saw the \"Battle of the Nations\"\r\n(Leipzig, 15th-18th October, 1813), and his great Napoleon terminate in\r\nbankruptcy. He left no Son. A Brother, age 72, succeeded him as King for\r\na few years; whom again a Brother would have succeeded, had not he (this\r\nthird Brother, age now 66) renounced, in favor of HIS Son, the present\r\nKing of Saxony. Enough, enough!--\r\n\r\nAugust 28th, 1763, while afflicted Polish Majesty is making his packages\r\nat Warsaw, far away,--Marie-Antoinette, in Dresden, had sent Friedrich\r\nan Opera of her composing, just brought out by her on her Court-theatre\r\nthere. Here is Friedrich's Answer,--to what kind of OPERA I know not,\r\nbut to a Letter accompanying it which is extremely pretty.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH TO THE ELECTORAL PRINCESS (at Dresden).\r\n\r\n\"POTSDAM, 5th September, 1763.\r\n\r\n\"MADAM MY SISTER,--The remembrance your Royal Highness sends is the more\r\nflattering to me, as I regret infinitely not to have been spectator and\r\nhearer of the fine things [Opera THALESTRIS, words and music entirely\r\nlost to us] which I have admired for myself in the silent state.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could send you things as pleasant out of these parts: but,\r\nMadam, I am obliged to give you a hint, which may be useful if you can\r\nhave it followed. In Saxony, however, my Letters get opened;--which\r\nobliges me to send this by a special Messenger; and him, that he may\r\ncause no suspicion, I have charged with fruits from my garden. You will\r\nhave the goodness to say [if anybody is eavesdropping] that you asked\r\nthem of me at Moritzburg, when I was happy enough to see you there [six\r\nmonths ago, coming home from the Seven-Years War]. The hint I had to\r\ngive was this:--\r\n\r\n\"In Petersburg people's minds are getting angry at the stubbornness your\r\nfriends show in refusing to recognize Duke Bieren [home from Siberia,\r\nagain Duke of Courland, by Russian appointment, as if Russia had that\r\nright; Polish Majesty and his Prince Karl resisting to the uttermost].\r\nI counsel you to induce the powerful in your circle to have this\r\ncondescension [they have had it, been obliged to have it, though\r\nFriedrich does not yet know]; for it will turn out ill to them, if they\r\npersist in being obstinately stiff. It begins already to be said That\r\nthere are more than a million Russian subjects at this time refugees in\r\nPoland; whom, by I forget what cartel, the Republic was bound to deliver\r\nup. Orders have been given to Detachments of Military to enter certain\r\nplaces, and bring away these Russians by force. In a word, you will\r\nruin your affairs forever, unless you find means to produce a change of\r\nconduct on the part of him they complain of. Take, Madam, what I now say\r\nas a mark of the esteem and profound regard with which--\"--F. [_OEuvres\r\nde Frederic,_ xxiv. 46.]\r\n\r\nThis hint, if the King knew, had been given, in a less kind shape,\r\nby Necessity itself; and had sent Polish Majesty, and his Bruhls and\r\n\"powerful people,\" bodily home, and out of that Polish Russian welter,\r\nin a headlong and tragically passionate condition.

The\r\nKing is dead [died this very day; see if _I_ lose time in sentimental\r\nlamentations!]--with him these grievances of Russia [our stiffness\r\non Courland and the like] must be extinct; the rather as we [the now\r\nreigning] will lend ourselves willingly to everything that can be\r\nrequired of us for perfect reconcilement with that Power.\r\n\r\n\"You can do all, if you will it; you can contribute to this\r\nreconcilement.

But that was not\r\nFriedrich's resource: he answers by return of post, as always in such\r\ncases;--and in the following adroit manner brushes off, without hurt\r\nto it, with kisses to it rather, the beautiful hand that has him by the\r\nbutton:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE ELECTRESS MARIE-ANTOINE (at Dresden).\r\n\r\n\"BERLIN, 8th October, 1763.\r\n\r\n\"MADAM MY SISTER,--I begin by making my condolences and my\r\ncongratulations to your Electoral Highness on the death of the King your\r\nFather-in-law, and on your Accession to the Electorate.\r\n\r\n\"Your Electoral Highness will remember what I wrote, not long since,\r\non the affairs of Poland. I am afraid, Madam, that Russia will be more\r\ncontrary to you than you think. M. de Woronzow [famous Grand-Chancellor\r\nof Russia; saved himself dexterously in the late Peter-Catharine\r\noverturn; has since fallen into disfavor for his notions about our\r\nGregory Orlof, and is now on his way to Italy, \"for health's sake,\" in\r\nconsequence], who is just arrived here, [\"Had his audience 7th October\"\r\n(yesterday): Rodenbeck, ii. 224.] told me, too, of some things which\r\nraise an ill augury of this affair. If you do not disapprove of my\r\nspeaking frankly to you, it seems to me that it would be suitable in\r\nyou to send some discreet Diplomatist to that Court to notify the King's\r\ndeath; and you would learn by him what you have to expect from her\r\nCzarish Majesty [the Empress, he always calls her, knowing she prefers\r\nthat title]. It seems to me, Madam, that it would be precipitate\r\nprocedure should I wish to engage you in an Enterprise, which appears to\r\nmyself absolutely dubious (HASARDEE), unless approved by that Princess.\r\nAs to me, Madam, I have not the ascendant there which you suppose: I\r\nact under rule of all the delicacies and discretions with a Court which\r\nseparated itself from my Enemies when all Europe wished to crush me: but\r\nI am far from being able to regulate the Empress's way of thinking.\r\n\r\n\"It is the same with the quarrels about the Duke of Courland; one cannot\r\nattempt mediation except by consent of both parties. I believe I am\r\nnot mistaken in supposing that the Court of Russia does not mean to\r\nterminate that business by foreign mediation. What I have heard about\r\nit (what, however, is founded only on vague news) is, That the Empress\r\nmight prevail upon herself (POURRAIT SE RESOUDRE) to purchase from Bruhl\r\nthe Principality of Zips [Zips, on the edge of Hungary; let readers take\r\nnote of that Principality, at present in the hand of Bruhl,--who has\r\nmuch disgusted Poland by his voracity for Lands; and is disgorging them\r\nall again, poor soul!], to give it to Prince Karl in compensation: but\r\nthat would lead to a negotiation with the Court of Vienna, which might\r\ninvolve the affair in other contentions.\r\n\r\n\"I conjure you, Madam, I repeat it, Be not precipitate in anything;\r\nlest, as my fear is, you replunge Europe into the troubles it has only\r\njust escaped from! As to me, I have found, since the Peace, so much\r\nto do within my own borders, that I have not, I assure you, had time,\r\nMadam, to think of going abroad. I confine myself to forming a thousand\r\nwishes for the prosperity of your Electoral Highness, assuring you of\r\nthe high esteem with which I am,--F.\" [_OEuvres de Frederic,_ xxiv. 48.]\r\n\r\nAfter some farther Letters, of eloquently pressing solicitation on the\r\npart of the Lady, and earnest advising, as well as polite fencing, on\r\nthe part of Friedrich, the latter writes:--\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH TO ELECTRESS.\r\n\r\n\"MADAM MY SISTER,--At this moment I receive a Letter from the\r\n\r\nEmpress of Russia, the contents of which do not appear to me favorable,\r\nMadam, to your hopes. She requires (EXIGE) that I should instruct my\r\nMinister in Poland to act entirely in concert with the Count Kayserling;\r\nand she adds these very words: 'I expect, from the friendship of your\r\nMajesty, that you will not allow a passage through your territory, nor\r\nthe entry into Poland, to Saxon troops, who are to be regarded there\r\nabsolutely as strangers.'\r\n\r\n\"Unless your Letters, Madam [Madam had said that she had written to the\r\nEmpress, assuring her &c.] change the sentiments of the Empress, I do\r\nnot see in what way the Elector could arrive at the throne of Poland;\r\nand consequently, whether I deferred to the wishes of the Empress in\r\nthis point, or refused to do so, you would not the more become Queen;\r\nand I might commit myself against a Power which I ought to keep well\r\nwith (MENAGER). I am persuaded, Madam, that your Electoral Highness\r\nenters into my embarrassment; and that, unless you find yourself\r\nsuccessful in changing the Empress's own ideas on this matter, you\r\nwill not require of me that I should embroil myself fruitlessly with a\r\nneighbor who deserves the greatest consideration from me.\r\n\r\n\"All this is one consequence of the course which Count Bruhl induced his\r\nlate Polish Majesty to take with regard to the interests of Prince Karl\r\nin Courland; and your Electoral Highness will remember, that I often\r\nrepresented to you the injury which would arise to him from it.\r\n\r\n\"I will wish, Madam, that other opportunities may occur, where it may be\r\nin my power to prove to your Electoral Highness the profound esteem and\r\nconsideration with which I am--\"--F.

I notice most European Powers\r\ndoing the same; too happy if, whilst Kings are being manufactured to\r\nright and left, public tranquillity is not disturbed thereby, and if\r\nevery one may continue to dwell in peace beside his hearth and his\r\nhousehold gods.\" [\"Sans-Souci, 26th June, 1764\" (Ib. p. 69).] Adieu,\r\nbright Madam.\r\n\r\nNo reader who has made acquaintance with Polish History can well doubt\r\nbut Poland was now dead or moribund, and had well deserved to die.\r\nAnarchies are not permitted in this world. Under fine names, they are\r\ngrateful to the Populaces, and to the Editors of Newspapers; but to\r\nthe Maker of this Universe they are eternally abhorrent; and from the\r\nbeginning have been forbidden to be. They go their course, applauded or\r\nnot applauded by self and neighbors,--for what lengths of time none of\r\nus can know; for a long term sometimes, but always for a fixed term; and\r\nat last their day comes. Poland had got to great lengths, two centuries\r\nago, when poor John Casimir abdicated his Crown of Poland, after a\r\ntrial of twenty years, and took leave of the Republic in that remarkable\r\nSPEECH to the Diet of 1667.\r\n\r\nThis John is \"Casimir V.,\" last Scion of the Swedish House of\r\nVasa,--with whom, in the Great Elector's time, we had some slight\r\nacquaintance; and saw at least the three days' beating he got (Warsaw,\r\n28th-30th July, 1656) from Karl Gustav of Sweden and the Great Elector,\r\n[Supra, v. 284-286.] ancestors respectively of Karl XII. and of our\r\npresent Friedrich. He is not \"Casimir the Great\" of Polish Kings; but he\r\nis, in our day, Casimir the alone Remarkable. It seems to me I once had\r\nIN EXTENSO this Valedictory Speech of his; but it has lapsed again into\r\nthe general Mother of Dead Dogs, and I will not spend a week in fishing\r\nfor it. The gist of the Speech, innumerable Books and Dead Dogs tell\r\nyou, [HISTOIRE DES TROIS DEMEMBREMENS does, and many others do;--copied\r\nin _Biographie Universelle,_ vii. 278 (? Casimir).] is \"lamentation over\r\nthe Polish Anarchies\" and \"a Prophecy,\" which is very easily remembered.\r\nThe poor old Gentleman had no doubt eaten his peck of dirt among those\r\nPolacks, and swallowed chagrins till he felt his stomach could no more,\r\nand determined to have done with it. To one's fancy, in abridged form,\r\nthe Valediction must have run essentially as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Magnanimous Polack Gentlemen, you are a glorious Republic, and have NIE\r\nPOZWALAM, and strange methods of business, and of behavior to your Kings\r\nand others. We have often fought together, been beaten together, by our\r\nenemies and by ourselves; and at last I, for my share, have enough of\r\nit. I intend for Paris; religious-literary pursuits, and the society of\r\nNinon de l'Enclos. I wished to say before going, That according to all\r\nrecord, ancient and modern, of the ways of God Almighty in this world,\r\nthere was not heretofore, nor do I expect there can henceforth be, a\r\nHuman Society that would stick together on those terms. Believe me, ye\r\nPolish Chivalries, without superior except in Heaven, if your glorious\r\nRepublic continue to be managed in such manner, not good will come\r\nof it, but evil. The day will arrive [this is the Prophecy, almost\r\nIN IPSISSIMIS VERBIS], the day perhaps is not so far off, when this\r\nglorious Republic will get torn into shreds, hither, thither; be stuffed\r\ninto the pockets of covetous neighbors, Brandenburg; Muscovy, Austria;\r\nand find itself reduced to zero, and abolished from the face of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\"I speak these words in sorrow of soul; words which probably you will\r\nnot believe. Which only Fate can compel you to believe, one day, if\r\nthey are true words:--you think, probably, they are not? Me at least, or\r\ninterest of mine, they do not regard. I speak them from the fulness of\r\nmy heart, and on behest of friendship and conviction alone; having the\r\nhonor at this moment to bid you and your Republic a very long farewell.\r\nGood-morning, for the last time!\" and so EXIT: to Rome (had been\r\nCardinal once); to Paris and the society of Ninon's Circle for the few\r\nyears left him of life. [\"Died 16th December, 1672, age 63.\"]\r\n\r\nThis poor John had had his bitter experiences: think only of one\r\ninstance. In 1662, the incredible Law of LIBERUM VETO had been\r\nintroduced, in spite of John and his endeavors. LIBERUM VETO; the power\r\nof one man to stop the proceedings of Polish Parliament by pronouncing\r\naudibly \"NIE POZWALAM, I don't permit!\"--never before or since\r\namong mortals was so incredible a Law. Law standing indisputable,\r\nnevertheless, on the Polish Statute-Book for above two hundred years:\r\nlike an ever-flowing fountain of Anarchy, joyful to the Polish Nation.\r\nHow they got any business done at all, under such a Law? Truly they did\r\nbut little; and for the last thirty years as good as none. But if Polish\r\nParliament was universally in earnest to do some business, and Veto came\r\nupon it, Honorable Members, I observe, gathered passionately round the\r\nvetoing Brother; conjured, obtested, menaced, wept, prayed; and, if the\r\ncase was too urgent and insoluble otherwise, the NIE POZWALAM Gentleman\r\nstill obstinate, they plunged their swords through him, and in that way\r\nbrought consent. The commoner course was to dissolve and go home again,\r\nin a tempest of shrieks and curses.\r\n\r\nThe Right of Confederation, too, is very curious: do readers know it? A\r\nfree Polack gentleman, aggrieved by anything that has occurred or been\r\nenacted in his Nation, has the right of swearing, whether absolutely by\r\nhimself I know not, but certainly with two or three others of like mind,\r\nthat he will not accept said occurrence or enactment, and is hereby got\r\ninto arms against its abettors and it. The brightest jewel in the cestus\r\nof Polish Liberty is this right of confederating; and it has been, till\r\nof late, and will be now again practised to all lengths: right of every\r\nPolish, gentleman to confederate with every other against, or for,\r\nwhatsoever to them two may seem good; and to assert their particular\r\nview of the case by fighting for it against all comers, King and Diet\r\nincluded. It must be owned, there never was in Nature such a Form\r\nof Government before; such a mode of social existence, rendering\r\n\"government\" impossible for some generations past.\r\n\r\nOn the strength of Saxony and its resources and connections, the two\r\nAugusts had contrived to exist with the name of Kings; with the name,\r\nbut with little or nothing more. Under this last August, as we heard,\r\nthere have been about forty Diets, and in not one of them the least\r\nthing of business done; all the forty, after trying their best, have\r\nstumbled on NIE POZWALAM, and been obliged to vanish in shrieks and\r\ncurses. [Buchholz (_Preussisch-Brandenburgische Geschichte,_ ii. 133,\r\n134, &c. &c.) gives various samples, and this enumeration.] As to August\r\nthe Physically Strong, such treatment had he met with,--poor August, if\r\nreaders remember, had made up his mind to partition Poland; to give away\r\nlarge sections of it in purchase of the consent of neighbors, and plant\r\nhimself hereditarily in the central part;--and would have done so, had\r\nnot Grumkow and he drunk so deep, and death by inflammation of the foot\r\nsuddenly come upon the poor man. Some Partition of Poland has been more\r\nthan once thought of by practical people concerned. Poland, as \"a house\r\nchronically smoking through the slates,\" which usually brings a new\r\nEuropean War every time it changes King, does require to be taken charge\r\nof by its neighbors.\r\n\r\nLatterly, as we observed, there has been little of confederating;\r\nindeed, for the last thirty years, as Rulhiere copiously informs us,\r\nthere has been no Government, consequently no mutiny needed; little or\r\nno National business of any kind,--the Forty Diets having all gone\r\nthe road we saw. Electing of the Judges,--that, says Rulhiere, and\r\nwearisomely teaches by example again and ever again, has always been an\r\ninteresting act, in the various Provinces of Poland; not with the hope\r\nof getting fair or upright Judges, but Judges that will lean in the\r\ndesirable direction. In a country overrun with endless lawsuits, debts,\r\ncredits, feudal intricacies, claims, liabilities, how important to\r\nget Judges with the proper bias! And these once got, or lost till next\r\nterm,--what is there to hope or to fear? Russia does our Politics,\r\nfights her Seven-Years War across us; and we, happy we, have no\r\nfighting;--never till this of Courland was there the least ill-nature\r\nfrom Russia! We are become latterly the peaceable stepping-stone of\r\nRussia into Europe and out of it;--what may be called the door-mat of\r\nRussia, useful to her feet, when she is about paying visits or receiving\r\nthem! That is not a glorious fact, if it be a safe and \"lucky\" one; nor\r\ndo the Polish Notabilities at all phrase it in that manner. But a fact\r\nit is; which has shown itself complete in the late Czarina's and late\r\nAugust's time, and which had been on the growing hand ever since Peter\r\nthe Great gained his Battle of Pultawa, and rose to the ascendency,\r\ninstead of Karl and Sweden.\r\n\r\nThe Poles put fine colors on all this; and are much contented with\r\nthemselves. The Russians they regard as intrinsically an inferior\r\nbarbarous people; and to this day you will hear indignant Polack\r\nGentlemen bursting out in the same strain: \"Still barbarian, sir; no\r\nculture, no literature,\"--inferior because they do not make verses\r\nequal to ours! How it may be with the verses, I will not decide: but\r\nthe Russians are inconceivably superior in respect that they have, to a\r\nsingular degree among Nations, the gift of obeying, of being commanded.\r\nPolack Chivalry sniffs at the mention of such a gift. Polack Chivalry\r\ngot sore stripes for wanting this gift. And in the end, got striped to\r\ndeath, and flung out of the world, for continuing blind to the want of\r\nit, and never acquiring it.\r\n\r\nBeyond all the verses in Nature, it is essential to every Chivalry and\r\nNation and Man. \"Polite Polish Society for the last thirty years\r\nhas felt itself to be in a most halcyon condition,\" says Rulhiere:\r\n[Rulhiere, i. 216 (a noteworthy passage).] \"given up to the agreeable,\r\nand to that only;\" charming evening-parties, and a great deal of\r\nflirting; full of the benevolences, the philanthropies, the new\r\nideas,--given up especially to the pleasing idea of \"LAISSEZ-FAIRE, and\r\neverything will come right of itself.\" \"What a discovery!\" said every\r\nliberal Polish mind: \"for thousands of years, how people did torment\r\nthemselves trying to steer the ship; never knowing that the plan was,\r\nTo let go the helm, and honestly sit down to your mutual amusements and\r\npowers of pleasing!\"\r\n\r\nTo this condition of beautifully phosphorescent rot-heap has Poland\r\nripened, in the helpless reigns of those poor Augusts;--the fulness\r\nof time not now far off, one would say? It would complete the picture,\r\ncould I go into the state of what is called \"Religion\" in Poland.\r\nDissenterism, of various poor types, is extensive; and, over against\r\nit, is such a type of Jesuit Fanaticism as has no fellow in that day. Of\r\nwhich there have been truly savage and sanguinary outbreaks, from\r\ntime to time; especially one at Thorn, forty years ago, which shocked\r\nFriedrich Wilhelm and the whole Protestant world. [See supra, vi. 64\r\n(and many old Pamphlets on it).] Polish Orthodoxy, in that time, and\r\nperhaps still in ours, is a thing worth noting. A late Tourist informs\r\nme, he saw on the streets of Stettin, not long since, a drunk human\r\ncreature staggering about, who seemed to be a Baltic Sailor, just\r\narrived; the dirtiest, or among the dirtiest, of mankind; who, as he\r\nreeled along, kept slapping his hands upon his breast, and shouting, in\r\nexultant soliloquy, \"Polack, Catholik!\" _I_ am a Pole and Orthodox, ye\r\ninferior two-legged entities!.--In regard to the Jesuit Fanaticisms, at\r\nThorn and elsewhere, no blame can attach to the poor Augusts, who always\r\nleant the other way, what they durst or could. Nor is specialty of\r\nblame due to them on any score; it was \"like People, like King,\" all\r\nalong;--and they, such their luck, have lived to bring in the fulness of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe Saxon Electors are again aspirants for this enviable Throne. We have\r\nseen the beautiful Electress zealously soliciting Friedrich for help in\r\nthat project; Friedrich, in a dexterously graceful manner, altogether\r\ndeclining. Hereditary Saxons are not to be the expedient this time, it\r\nwould seem; a grandiose Czarina has decided otherwise. Why should not\r\nshe? She and all the world are well aware, Russia has been virtual\r\nlord of Poland this long time. Credible enough that Russia intends\r\nto continue so; and also that it will be able, without very much\r\nexpenditure of new contrivance for that object.\r\n\r\nSo far as can be guessed and assiduously deduced from RULHIERE, with\r\nyour best attention, Russian Catharine's interference seems first of\r\nall to have been grounded on the grandiose philanthropic principle.\r\nAstonishing to the liberal mind; yet to appearance true. Rulhiere\r\nnowhere says so; but that is gradually one's own perception of\r\nthe matter; no other refuge for you out of flat inconceivability.\r\nPhilanthropic principle, we say, which the Voltaires and Sages of that\r\nEpoch are prescribing as one's duty and one's glory: \"O ye Kings, why\r\nwon't you do good to mankind, then?\" Catharine, a kind of She-Louis\r\nQuatorze, was equal to such a thing. To put one's cast Lover into\r\na throne,--poor soul, console him in that manner;--and reduce the\r\nlong-dissentient Country to blessed composure under him: what a thing!\r\nFoolish Poniatowski, an empty, windy creature, redolent of macassar and\r\nthe finer sensibilities of the heart: him she did make King of Poland;\r\nbut to reduce the long-dissentient Country to composure,--that was\r\nwhat she could not do. Countries in that predicament are sometimes very\r\ndifficult to compose. The Czarina took, for above five years, a great\r\ndeal of trouble, without losing patience. The Czarina, after every new\r\neffort, perceived with astonishment that she was farther from success\r\nthan ever. With astonishment; and gradually with irritation, thickening\r\nand mounting towards indignation.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to believe that the grandiose Woman handled, or\r\ndesigned to handle, a doomed Poland in the merciless feline-diabolic\r\nway set forth with wearisome loud reiteration in those distracted Books;\r\nplaying with the poor Country as cat does with mouse; now lifting her\r\nfell paw, letting the poor mouse go loose in floods of celestial joy and\r\nhope without limit; and always clutching the hapless creature back into\r\nthe blackness of death, before eating and ending it. Reason first is,\r\nthat the Czarina, as we see her elsewhere, never was in the least a Cat\r\nor a Devil, but a mere Woman; already virtual proprietress of Poland,\r\nand needing little contrivance to keep it virtually hers. Reason second\r\nis, that she had not the gift of prophecy, and could not foreknow\r\nthe Polish events of the next ten years, much less shape them out\r\nbeforehand, and preside over them, like a Devil or otherwise, in the way\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nMy own private conjecture, I confess, has rather grown to be, on much\r\nreading of those RULHIERES and distracted Books, that the Czarina,--who\r\nwas a grandiose creature, with considerable magnanimities, natural\r\nand acquired; with many ostentations, some really great qualities and\r\ntalents; in effect, a kind of She-Louis Quatorze (if the reader will\r\nreflect on that Royal Gentleman, and put him into petticoats in Russia,\r\nand change his improper females for improper males),--that the Czarina,\r\nvery clearly resolute to keep Poland hers, had determined with herself\r\nto do something very handsome in regard to Poland; and to gain glory,\r\nboth with the enlightened Philosophe classes and with her own proud\r\nheart, by her treatment of that intricate matter. \"On the one hand,\"\r\nthinks she, or let us fancy she thinks, \"here is Poland; a Country\r\nfallen bedrid amid Anarchies, curable or incurable; much tormented with\r\nreligious intolerance at this time, hateful to the philosophic mind; a\r\nhateful fanaticism growing upon it for forty years past [though it\r\nis quite against Polish Law]; and the cries of oppressed Dissidents\r\n[Dissenters, chiefly of the Protestant and of the Greek persuasion]\r\nbecoming more and more distressing to hear. And, on the other hand, here\r\nis Poniatowski who, who--!\"\r\n\r\nReaders have not forgotten the handsome, otherwise extremely paltry,\r\nyoung Polack, Stanislaus Poniatowski, whom Excellency Williams took\r\nwith him 8 or 9 years ago, ostensibly as \"Secretary of Legation,\"\r\nunostensibly as something very different? Handsome Stanislaus did\r\nduly become Lover of the Grand-Duchess; and has duly, in the course of\r\nNature, some time ago (date uncertain to me), become discarded Lover;\r\nthe question rising, What is to be done with that elegant inane\r\ncreature, and his vaporous sentimentalisms and sublime sorrows and\r\ndisappointments? \"Let us make him King of Poland!\" said the Czarina,\r\nwho was always much the gentleman with her discarded Lovers (more so,\r\nI should say, than Louis Quatorze with his;--and indeed it is computed\r\nthey cost her in direct moneys about twenty millions sterling,--being\r\nnumerous and greedy; but never the least tiff of scolding or ill\r\nlanguage): [Castera (_Vie de Catharine II._) has an elaborate Appendix\r\non this part of his subject.]--\"King of Poland, with furnishings, and\r\nset him handsomely up in the world! We will close the Dissident Business\r\nfor him, cure many a curable Anarchy of Poland, to the satisfaction of\r\nVoltaire and all leading spirits of mankind. He shall have outfit of\r\nRussian troops, poor creature; and be able to put down Anarchies, and\r\nshow himself a useful and grateful Viceroy for us there. Outfit\r\nof 10,000 troops, a wise Russian Manager: and the Question of the\r\nDissidents to be settled as the first glory of his reign!\"\r\n\r\nIngenuous readers are invited to try, in their diffuse vague RULHIERES,\r\nand unintelligible shrieky Polish Histories, whether this notion does\r\nnot rise on them as a possible human explanation, more credible than\r\nthe feline-diabolic one, which needs withal such a foreknowledge,\r\nUNattainable by cat or devil? Poland must not rise to be too strong\r\na Country, and turn its back on Russia. No, truly; nor, except by\r\nmiraculous suspension of the Laws of Nature, is there danger of that.\r\nBut neither need Poland lie utterly lame and prostrate, useless to\r\nRussia; and be tortured on its sick-bed with Dissident Questions and\r\nAnarchies, curable by a strong Sovereign, of whom much is expected by\r\nVoltaire and the leading spirits of mankind.\r\n\r\nWhat we shall have to say with perfect certainty, and what alone\r\nconcerns us in our own affair, is, FIRST, that Catharine did proceed\r\nby this method, of crowning, fitting out and otherwise setting up\r\nStanislaus; did attempt settlement (and at one time thought she had\r\nsettled) the Dissident Question and some curable Anarchies,--but stirred\r\nup such legions of incurable, waxing on her hands, day after day, year\r\nafter year, as were abundantly provoking and astonishing:--and that\r\nwithin the next eight years she had arrived, with Poland and her cargo\r\nof anarchies, at results which struck the whole world dumb. Dumb with\r\nastonishment, for some time; and then into tempests of vociferation\r\nmore or less delirious, which have never yet quite ended, though sinking\r\ngradually to lower and lower stages of human vocality. Fact FIRST is\r\nabundantly manifest. Nor is fact SECOND any longer doubtful, That King\r\nFriedrich, in regard to all this, till a real crisis elsewhere had\r\nrisen, took little or no visible interest whatever; had one unvarying\r\ncourse of conduct, that of punctually following Czarish Majesty in\r\nevery respect; instructing his Minister at Warsaw always to second\r\nand reinforce the Russian one, as his one rule of policy in that\r\nCountry,--whose distracted procedures, imbecilities and anarchies, are,\r\nbeyond this point of keeping well with a grandiose Czarina concerned in\r\nit, of no apparent practical interest to Prussia or its King.\r\n\r\nFriedrich, for a long time, passed with the Public for contriver of the\r\nCatastrophe of Poland,--\"felonious mortal,\" \"monster of maleficence,\"\r\nand what not, in consequence. Rulhiere, whose notion of him is none of\r\nthe friendliest nor correctest, acquits him of this atrocity; declares\r\nhim, till the very end, mainly or altogether passive in it. Which I\r\nthink is a little more than the truth,--and only a little, as perhaps\r\nmay appear by and by. Beyond dispute, these Polish events did at last\r\ngrow interesting enough to Prussia and its King;--and it will be our\r\ntask, sufficient in this place, to extricate and riddle out what few of\r\nthese had any cardinal or notable quality, and put them down (dated, if\r\npossible, and in intelligible form), as pertinent to throwing light\r\non this distressing matter, with careful exclusion of the immense mass\r\nwhich can throw only darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEX-LOVER PONIATOWSKI BECOMES KING OF POLAND (7th Sept. 1764), AND IS\r\nCROWNED WITHOUT LOSS OF HIS HAIR.\r\n\r\nWARSAW, 7th SEPTEMBER 1764, Stanislaus Poniatowski, by what management\r\nof an Imperial Catharine upon an anarchic Nation readers shall imagine\r\nAD LIBITUM, was elected, what they call elected, King of Poland. Of\r\ncourse there had been preliminary Diets of Convocation, much dieting,\r\ndemonstrating and electing of imaginary members of Diet,--only \"ten\r\npersons massacred\" in the business. There was a Saxon Party; but no\r\ncounter-candidate of that or any other nation. King Friedrich, solicited\r\nby a charming Electress-Dowager, decides to remain accurately passive.\r\nPolish emissaries came entreating him. A certain Mockranowski, who had\r\nbeen a soldier under him (never of much mark in that capacity, though\r\nnow a flamingly conspicuous \"General\" and Politician, in the new scene\r\nhe has got into), came passionately entreating (Potsdam, Summer of 1764,\r\nis all the date), \"DONNEZ NOUS LE PRINCE HENRI, Give us Prince Henri for\r\na King!\" the sound of which almost made Friedrich turn pale: \"Have you\r\nspoken or hinted of this to the Prince?\" \"No, your Majesty.\" \"Home,\r\nthen, instantly; and not a whisper of it again to any mortal!\"\r\n[Rulhiere, ii. 268; Hermann, vi. 355-364.] which, they say, greatly\r\nirritated Prince Henri, and left a permanent sore-place in his mind,\r\nwhen he came to hear of it long after.\r\n\r\n\"A question rises here,\" says one of my Notes, which perhaps I had\r\nbetter have burnt: \"At or about what dates did this glorious Poniatowski\r\nbecome Lover of the Grand-Duchess, and then become Ex-Lover? Nobody\r\nwill say; or perhaps can? [Preuss (iv. 12) seems to try, but does not\r\nsucceed.] Would have been a small satisfaction to us, and it is\r\ndenied! 'Ritter Williams' (that is, Hanbury) must have produced him at\r\nPetersburg some time in 1756; '11th January, 1757,' finding it would\r\nsuit, Poniatowski appeared there on his own footing as 'Ambassador from\r\nWarsaw,'\"--(easy to get that kind of credential from a devoted Warsaw,\r\nif you are succeeding at the Court of Petersburg; \"Warsaw watchfully\r\nmakes that the rule of distributing its honors; and, from freezing-point\r\nupwards, is the most delicate thermometer,\" says Hermann somewhere).\r\nAnd this, is our one date, \"Poniatowski in business, SPRING, 1757;\" of\r\n\"Poniatowski fallen bankrupt,\" date is totally wanting.\r\n\r\n\"Poniatowski's age is 32 gone;--how long out of Russia, readers have to\r\nguess. Made his first public appearance on the streets of Warsaw, in the\r\nlate Election time, as a Captain of Patriot Volunteers,--'Independence\r\nof Poland! Shall Poland be dictated to!\" cried Stanislaus and an\r\nindignant Public at one stage of the affair. His Uncles Czartoryski were\r\npiloting him in; and in that mad element, the cries, and shiftings of\r\ntack, had to be many. [In HERMANN, v. 362-380 (still more in RULHIERE,\r\nii. 119-289), wearisome account of every particular.] He is Nephew, by\r\nhis mother, of these Czartoryskis; but is not by the father of very high\r\nfamily. 'Ought he to be King of Poland?' argued some Polish Emissary at\r\nPetersburg: 'His Grandfather was Land-steward to the Sapiehas.' 'And\r\nif he himself had been it!' said the Empress, inflexible, though with\r\na blush.--It seems the family was really good, though fallen poor; and,\r\nsince that Land-steward phasis, had bloomed well out again. His Father\r\nwas conspicuous as a busy, shifting kind of man, in the Charles-Twelfth\r\nand other troubles; had died two years ago, as 'Castellan of Cracow;'\r\nalways a dear friend of Stanislaus Leczinski, who gets his death two\r\nyears hence [in 1766, as we have seen].\r\n\r\n\"King Stanislaus Poniatowski had five Brothers: two of them dead long\r\nbefore this time; a third, still alive, was Bishop of Something, Abbot\r\nof Something; ate his revenues in peace, and demands silence from us.\r\nThe other two, Casimir and Andreas, are better worth naming,--especially\r\nthe Son of one of them is. Casimir, the eldest, is 'Grand\r\nCrown-Chamberlain' in the days now coming, is also 'Starost of Zips\r\n[a Country you may note the name of!]--and has a Son,' who is NOT the\r\nremarkable one. Andreas, the second Brother (died 1773), was in the\r\nAustrian Service, 'Ordnance-Master,' and a man of parts and weight;--who\r\nhas been here at Warsaw, ardently helping, in the late Election time.\r\nHe too had a Son (at this time a child in arms),--who is really the\r\nremarkable 'Nephew of King Stanislaus,' and still deserves a word from\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"This Nephew, bred as an Austrian soldier, like his Father, is the\r\nJOSEPH PONIATOWSKI, who was very famous in the Newspapers fifty years\r\nago. By all appearance, a man of some real patriotism, energy and worth.\r\nHe had tried to believe (though, I think, never rightly able) what his\r\nomnipotent Napoleon had promised him, that extinct Poland should be\r\nresuscitated; and he fought and strove very fiercely, his Poles and\r\nhe, in that faith or half-faith. And perished, fiercely fighting for\r\nNapoleon, fiercely covering Napoleon's retreat when his game was lost:\r\nhorse and man plunged into the Elster River (Leipzig Country, October\r\n19th, 1813, evening of the 'Battle of the Nations' there), and sank\r\nforever;--and the last gleam of Poland along with him. [_Biographie\r\nUniverselle_ (Poniatowski, Joseph), xxxv. 349-359.] Not even a\r\nmomentary gleam of hope for her, in the sane or half-sane kind, since\r\nthat,--though she now and then still tries it in the insane: the more to\r\nmy regret, for her and others!\r\n\r\n\"Besides these three Brothers, King Stanislaus had two Sisters still\r\nliving: one of them Wife of a very high Zamoiski; the other of a\r\nditto Branicki (pronounce BraniTZki)--him whom our German Books call\r\nKRON-GROSSFELDHERR; (Grand Crown-General,' if the Crown have any\r\nsoldiers at all; the sublime, debauched old Branicki, of whom Rulhiere\r\nis continually talking, and never reports anything but futilities in\r\na futile manner. So much is futile, and not worth reporting, in this\r\nPolish element!--King Stanislaus himself was born 17th January, 1732;\r\nplayed King of shreds and patches till 1790,--or even farther (not till\r\n1795 did Catharine pluck the paper tabard quite off him); he died in\r\nPetersburg, February 11th or 12th) 1798.\" After such a life!--\r\n\r\nStanislaus was crowned 25th November, 1764. He needs, as preliminary,\r\nto be anointed, on the bare scalp of him, with holy oil before crowning;\r\nought to have his head close-shaved with that view. Stanislaus, having\r\nan uncommonly fine head of hair, shuddered at the barbarous idea;\r\nabsolutely would not: whereupon delay, consultation; and at length some\r\nartificial scalp, or second skull, of pasteboard or dyed leather, was\r\ncontrived for the poor man, which comfortably took the oiling in a\r\nvicarious way, with the ambrosial locks well packed out of sight\r\nunder it, and capable of flowing out again next day, as if nothing had\r\nhappened. [Rulhiere.] Not a sublime specimen of Ornamental Human Nature,\r\nthis poor Stanislaus! Ornamental wholly: the body of him, and the mind\r\nof him, got up for representation; and terribly plucked to pieces on the\r\nstage of the world. You may try to drop a tear over him, but will find\r\nmostly that you cannot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR SEVERAL YEARS THE DISSIDENT QUESTION CANNOT BE GOT SETTLED;\r\nCONFEDERATION OF RADOM (23d June, 1767-5th March, 1768) PUSHES IT INTO\r\nSETTLEMENT.\r\n\r\nFor several years after this feat of the false scalp, through long\r\nvolumes, wearisome even in RULHIERE, there turns up nothing which can\r\nnow be called memorable. The settling of the Dissident Question proves\r\nextremely tedious to an impatient Czarina; as to curing of the other\r\ncurable Anarchies, there is absolutely nothing but a knitting up by A,\r\nwith a ravelling-out again by B, and no progress discernible\r\nwhatever. Impatient Czarina ardently pushes on some Dissident\r\nsettlement,--seconded by King Friedrich and the chief Protestant\r\nCourts, London included, and by the European leading spirits\r\neverywhere,--through endless difficulties: finds native Orthodoxy an\r\nunexpectedly stiff matter; Bishops generally having a fanaticism which\r\nis wonderful to think of, and which keeps mounting higher and higher.\r\nTill at length there will Images of the Virgin take to weeping,--as\r\nthey generally do in such cases, when in the vicinity of brew-houses and\r\nconveniences; [Nicolai, in his TRAVELS OVER GERMANY, doggedly undertook\r\nto overhaul one of those weeping Virgins (somewhere in Austria, I\r\nthink); and found her, he says, to depend on subterranean percolation\r\nof steam from a Brewery not far off.]--a Carmelite Monk go about the\r\ncountry working miracles; and, in short, an extremely ugly phasis of\r\nreligious human nature disclose itself to the afflicted reader. King\r\nFriedrich thinks, had it not been for this Dissident Question, things\r\nwould have taken their old Saxon complexion, and Poland might have\r\nrotted on as heretofore, perhaps a good while longer.\r\n\r\nAs to the knitting-up and ravelling-out again, which is called curing of\r\nthe other anarchies, no reader can or need say anything: it seems to be\r\na most painful knitting-up, by the Czartoryskis chiefly, then an\r\ninstant ravelling out by malign Opposition parties of various indistinct\r\ncomplexion; the knitting, the ravelling, and the malign Opposition\r\nparties, alike indistinct and without interest to mankind. A certain\r\ndrunken, rather brutal Phantasm of a Prince Radzivil, who hates the\r\nCzartoryskis, and is dreadfully given to drink, to wasteful ambitions\r\nand debaucheries, figures much in these businesses; is got banished and\r\nconfiscated, by some Confederation formed; then, by new Confederations,\r\nis recalled and reinstated,--worse if possible than ever. The thing is\r\nreality; but it reads like a Phantasmagory produced by Lapland Witches,\r\nunder presidency of Diabolus (very certainly the Devil presiding, as you\r\nsee at all turns),--and is not worth understanding, were it even easy.\r\n\r\nMuch semi-intelligible, wholly forgettable stuff about King Stanislaus\r\nand his difficulties, and his duplicities and treacherous imbecilities,\r\n[Hermann, v. 400, &c.; Rulhiere PASSIM.] now of interest to no mortal.\r\nStanislaus is at one time out with the uncles Czartoryski, at another in\r\nwith these worthy gentlemen: a man not likely to cure Anarchies, unless\r\nwishing would do it. On the Dissident Question itself he needs spurring:\r\na King of liberal ideas, yes; but with such flames of fanaticism under\r\nthe nose of him. In regard to the Dissident and all other curative\r\nprocesses he is languid, evasive, for moments recalcitrant to Russian\r\nsuggestions; a lost imbecile,--forget him, with or without a tear. He\r\nhas still a good deal of so-called gallantry on his hands; flies to his\r\nharem when outside things go contradictory. [Hermann, v. 402, &c.] Think\r\nof malign Journalists printing this bit of Letter at one time, to do him\r\nill in a certain quarter: \"Oh, come to me, my Princess! Dearer than all\r\nEmpresses:--imperial charms, what were they to thine for a heart that\r\nhas--\" with more of the like stuff, for a Czarina's behoof.\r\n\r\nWINTER OF 1766, Imperial Majesty, whether after or before that\r\nmiraculous Carmelite Monk, I do not remember, became impatient of these\r\ntedious languors and tortuosities about the Dissident Question, and gave\r\nexpress order, \"Settle it straightway!\" To which end, Confederations\r\nand the other machinery were set agoing: Confederations among the\r\nProtestants and Dissidents themselves, about Thorn and such places (got\r\nup by Russian engineering), and much more extensively in the Lithuanian\r\nparts; Confederations of great extent, imperative, minatory; ostensibly\r\nfor reinstating these poor people in their rights (which, by old Polish\r\nLaw, they quite expressly were, if that were any matter), but in reality\r\nfor bringing back drunken Radzivil, who has covenanted to carry that\r\nmeasure. And so,\r\n\r\nJUNE 23d, 1767, These multiplex Polish-Lithuanian Confederations,\r\ntwenty-four of them in all, with their sublime marshals and officials,\r\nand above 80,000 noblemen in them, meet by deputies at Radom, a\r\nconvenient little Town within wind of Warsaw (lies 60 miles to south of\r\nWarsaw); and there coalesce into one general \"Confederation of\r\nRadom,\" [Hermann, v. 420.] with drunken Radzivil atop, who, glad to be\r\nreinstated in his ample Domains and Wine-cellars, and willing at any\r\nrate to spite the Czartoryskis and others, has pledged himself to carry\r\nthat great measure in Diet, and quash any NIE POZWALAMS and difficulties\r\nthere may be. This is the once world-famous, now dimly discoverable,\r\nCONFEDERATION OF RADOM, which--by preparatory declaring, under its hand\r\nand seal, That the Law of the Land must again become valid, and \"Free\r\nPolacks of Dissident opinions concerning Religion (NOS DISSIDENTES DE\r\nRELIGIONE),\" as the old Law phrases it, \"shall have equal rights of\r\ncitizenship\"--was beautifully instrumental in achieving that bit of\r\nHuman Progress, and pushing it through the Diet, and its difficulties\r\nshortly ensuing.\r\n\r\nNot that the Diet did not need other vigorous treatment as well, the\r\nflame of fanaticism being frightfully ardent; many of the poor Bishops\r\nhaving run nearly frantic at this open spoliation of Mother Church,\r\nand snatching of the sword from Peter. So that Imperial Majesty had to\r\ndecide on picking out a dozen, or baker's dozen, of the hottest Bishops;\r\nand carrying them quietly into Russia under lock and key, till the thing\r\nwere done. Done it was, surely to the infinite relief of mankind;--I\r\ncannot say precisely on what day: October 13th-14th (locking up of the\r\ndozen Bishops), was one vital epoch of it; November 19th, 1767 (report\r\nof Committee on it, under Radzivil's and Russia's coercion), was\r\nanother: first and last it took about five months baking in Diet. Diet\r\nmet Oct. 4th, 1767, Radzivil controlling as Grand-Marshal, and Russia as\r\nminatory Phantom controlling Radzivil; Diet, after adjournments,\r\nafter one long adjournment, disappeared 5th March, 1768; and of\r\nwork mentionable it had done this of the Dissidents only. That of\r\ncontributing to \"the sovereign contempt with which King Stanislaus is\r\nregarded by all ranks of men,\" is hardly to be called peculiar work or\r\npeculiarly mentionable.\r\n\r\nAt this point, to relieve the reader's mind, and, at any rate, as the\r\ndate is fully come, we will introduce a small NEWSPAPER ARTICLE from\r\na very high hand, little guessed till long afterwards as the\r\nwriter,--namely, from King Friedrich's own. It does not touch on the\r\nDissident Question, or the Polish troubles; but does, in a back-handed\r\nway, on Prussian Rumors rising about them; and may obliquely show more\r\nof the King's feeling on that subject than we quite suppose. It seems\r\nthe King had heard that the Berlin people were talking and rumoring\r\nof \"a War being just at hand;\" whereupon--\"MARCH 5th, 1767, IN THE\r\nVOSSISCHE ZEITUNG (Voss's Chronicle), No. 28,\" an inquisitive Berlin\r\npublic read as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"We are advised from Potsdam, that, on the 27th of February, towards\r\nevening, the sky began to get overcast; black clouds, presaging a\r\ntempest of unexampled fury, covered all the horizon: the thunder, with\r\nits lightnings, forked bolts of amazing brilliancy, burst out; and,\r\nunder its redoubled peals, there descended such a torrent of hail as\r\nwithin man's memory had not been seen. Of two bullocks yoked in their\r\nplough, with which a peasant was hastening home, one was struck on the\r\nhead by a piece of it, and killed outright. Many of the common people\r\nwere wounded in the streets; a brewer had his arm broken. Roofs are\r\ndestroyed by the weight of this hail; all the windows that looked\r\nwindward while it fell were broken. In the streets, hailstones were\r\nfound of the size of pumpkins (CITROUILLES), which had not quite melted\r\ntwo hours after the storm ceased. This singular phenomenon has made a\r\nvery great impression. Scientific people say, the air had not buoyancy\r\nenough to support these solid masses when congealed to ice; that\r\nthe small hailstones in these clouds getting so lashed about in the\r\nimpetuosity of the winds, had united the more the farther they fell,\r\nand had not acquired that enormous magnitude till comparatively near the\r\nearth. Whatever way it may have happened, it is certain that occurrences\r\nof that kind are rare, and almost without example.\" [VOSSISCHE ZEITUNG,\r\nubi supra: _OEuvres de Frederic,_ xv. 204.]\r\n\r\nAnother singularity is, \"Professor Johann Daniel Titius of Wittenberg,\"\r\nwho teaches NATURAL PHILOSOPHY in that famous University, one may\r\njudge with what effect, wrote a Monograph on this unusual Phenomenon!\r\n[Rodenbeck (ii. 285) gives the Title of it, \"CONSIDERATIONS ON THE\r\nPOTSDAM HAIL OF LAST YEAR (Wittenberg, 1768).\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFEDERATION OF BAR ENSUES, ON THE PER-CONTRA SIDE (March 28th,\r\n1768); AND, AS FIRST RESULT OF ITS ACHIEVEMENTS (October 6th, 1768), A\r\nTURK-RUSSIAN WAR.\r\n\r\nThe Confederation of Radom, and its victorious Diet, had hardly begun\r\ntheir Song of Triumph, when there ensued on the per-contra side a\r\nflaming CONFEDERATION OF BAR;--which, by successive stages, does at\r\nlast burn out the Anarchies of Poland, and reduce them to ashes.\r\nConfederation of Bar; and then, as progeny of that, for and against,\r\nsuch a brood of Confederations, orthodox, heterodox, big, little,\r\nshort-lived, long-lived, of all complexions and degrees of noisy fury,\r\npotent, at any rate, each of them for murder and arson, within a\r\ncertain radius, as the Earth never saw before. Now was the time of those\r\ninextricable marchings (as inroads and outroads) through the Lithuanian\r\nBogs, of those death-defiant, unparalleled exploits, skirmishings,\r\nscaladings, riding by the edge of precipices, of Pulawski, Potocki and\r\nothers,--in which Rulhiere loses himself and turns on his axis, amid\r\nimpatient readers.\r\n\r\nFor the Russian troops (summoned by a trembling Stanislaus and his\r\nSenate, in terms of Treaty 1764), and in more languid manner, the\r\nStanislaus soldiery, as per law of the case, proceeded to strike\r\nin,--generally, my impression was, with an eye to maintain the King's\r\nPeace and keep down murder and arson:--and sure enough, the small bodies\r\nof drilled Russians blew an infuriated orthodox Polack chivalry to right\r\nand left at a short notice; but as to the Constable's Peace or King's,\r\nmade no improvement upon that, far the reverse. It is certain the\r\nConfederate chivalry were driven about, at a terrible rate,--over\r\nthe Turk frontier for shelter; began to appeal to the Grand Turk, in\r\ndesperate terms: \"Brother of the Sun and Moon, saw you ever such a\r\nchance for finishing Russia? Polack chivalry is Orthodox Catholic, but\r\nalso it is Anti-Russian!\" The Turk beginning to give ear to it, made the\r\nmatter pressing and serious. Here, more specifically, are some features\r\nand successive phases,--unless the reader prefer to skip.\r\n\r\n\"BAR, MARCH, 1768. The Confederation of Radom, as efficient preliminary,\r\nand chief agent in that Diet of emancipation to the Dissident human\r\nmind, might long have been famous over Poland and the world; but there\r\ninstantly followed as corollary to it a CONFEDERATION OF BAR, which\r\nquite dimmed the fame of Radom, and indeed of all Confederations prior\r\nor posterior! As the Confederation of Bar and its Doings, or rather\r\nsufferings and tragical misdoings and undoings, still hang like fitful\r\nspectralities, or historical shadows, of a vague ghastly complexion,\r\nin the human memory, one asks at least: Since they were on this Planet,\r\ntell us where? Bar is in the Waiwodship Podol (what we call Podolia),\r\nsome 400 miles southeast of Warsaw; not far from the Dniester\r\nRiver:--not far very from that mystery of the Dniester, the Zaporavian\r\nCossacks,--from those rapids or cataracts (quasi-cataracts of the\r\nDniester, with Islands in them, where those Cossack robbers live\r\nunassailable):--across the Dniester lies Turkey, and its famed Fortress\r\nof Choczim. This is a commodious station for Polish Gentlemen intending\r\nmutiny by law.\r\n\r\n\"MARCH 8th, 1768, Three short days after the Diet of Radom had done its\r\nfine feat, and retired to privacy, news came to Warsaw, That Podolia and\r\nthe Southern parts are all up, confederating with the highest animation;\r\nin hot rage against such decision of a Diet, contrary to Holy Religion\r\nand to much else; and that the said decision will have to fight for\r\nitself, now that it has done voting. This interesting news is true; and\r\ngoes on intensifying and enlarging itself, one dreadful Confederation\r\nspringing up, and then another and ever another, day after day; till at\r\nlast we hear that on the 27th of the month, MARCH 27th, 1768, at Bar, a\r\nlittle Town on the Southern or Turkish Frontier, all these more or less\r\ndreadful Confederations have met by delegates, and coalesced into one\r\n'Confederatiou of Bar,'--which did surely prove dreadful enough, to\r\nitself especially, in the months now ensuing!\"\r\n\r\nNo history of Bar Confederation shall we dream of; far be such an\r\nattempt from us. It consists of many Confederations, and out of each,\r\nPRO and CONTRA, spring many. Like the Lernean Hydra, or even Hydras in\r\na plural condition. A many-headed dog: and how many whelps it\r\nhad,--I cannot give even the cipher of them, or I would! One whelp\r\nConfederation, that of Cracow, is distinguished by having frequently or\r\ngenerally been \"drunk;\" and of course its procedures had often a vinous\r\ncharacter. [In HERMANN (v. 431-448); and especially in RULHIERE (ii.\r\nlivre 8 et seq.), details in superabundance.] I fancy to have read\r\nsomewhere that the number of them was one hundred and twenty-five. The\r\nrumor and the furious barking of Bar and its whelps goes into all lands:\r\nsuch rabid loud baying at mankind and the moon; and then, under Russia's\r\ntreatment, such shrill yelping and shrieking, was not heard in the world\r\nbefore, though perhaps it has since.\r\n\r\nPoor BAR'S exploits in the fighting way were highly inconsiderable; all\r\non the same scale; and spread over such a surface of country, mostly\r\nunknown, as renders it impossible to give them head-room, were you never\r\nso unfurnished. They can be read in eloquent Rulhiere; but by no mortal\r\nheld in memory. Anarchy is not a thing to be written of; a Lernean\r\nHydra, several Lernean Hydras, in chaotic genesis, getting their heads\r\nlopped off, and at the same time sprouting new ones in such ratio, where\r\nis the Zoologist that will give account of it? There was not anything\r\nconsiderable of fighting; but of bullying, plundering, murdering and\r\nbeing murdered, a frightful amount. There are seizures of castles,\r\nconvents, defensible houses; marches at a rate like that of antelopes,\r\nthrough the Lithuanian parts, boggy, hungry, boundless, opening to the\r\nfancy the Infinitude of Peat, in the solid and the fluid state. This,\r\nperhaps, is the finest species of feats, though they never lead to\r\nanything. There are heroes famed for these marches.\r\n\r\nThe Pulawskis, for example,--four of them, Lawyer people,--showed much\r\nactivity, and a talent for impromptu soldiering, in that kind. The\r\nMagnates of the Confederation, I was surprised to learn, had all quitted\r\nit, the instant it came to strokes: \"You Lawyer people, with your\r\npriests and orthodox peasantries, you do the fighting part; ours is\r\nthe consulting!\" And except Potocki (and he worse than none), there\r\nis presently not a Magnate of them left in Poland,--the rest all gone\r\nacross the Austrian Border, to Teschen, to Bilitz, a handy little town\r\nand domain in that Duchy of Teschen;--and sit there as \"Committee of\r\nGovernment:\" much at their ease in comparison, could they but agree\r\namong themselves, which they cannot. Bilitz is one of the many domains\r\nof Magnate Sulkowski:--do readers recollect the Sulkowski who at one\r\ntime \"declared War\" on King Friedrich; and was picked up, both War and\r\nhe, so compendiously by General Goltz, and locked in Glogau to cool?\r\nThis is the same Sulkowski; much concerned now in these matters; a rich\r\nMagnate, glad to see his friends about him as Governing Committee; but\r\ngets, and gives, a great deal of vexation in it, the element proving\r\nagain too hot!--\r\n\r\nI said there were four famed Pulawskis; [Hermann, v. 465.] a father,\r\nonce Advocate in Warsaw, with three sons and a nephew; who, though\r\nextremely active people, could do no good whatever. The father Pulawski\r\nhad the fine idea of introducing the British Constitution; clothing\r\nPoland wholly in British tailorage, and so making it a new Poland: but\r\nhe never could get it done. This poor gentleman died in Turkish\r\nprison, flung into jail at Constantinople, on calumnious accusation and\r\ncontrivance by a rival countryman; his sons and nephew, poor fellows,\r\nall had their fame, more or less, in the Cause of Freedom so called; but\r\nno other profit in this world, that I could hear of. Casimir, the eldest\r\nson, went to America; died there, still in the Cause of Freedom so\r\ncalled; Fort Pulawski, in the harbor of Charleston (which is at present,\r\non very singular terms, RE-engaged in the same so-called Cause!), was\r\nnamed in memory of this Casimir. He had defended Czenstochow (if anybody\r\nknew what Czenstochow was, or could find it in the Polish map); and it\r\nwas also he that contrived that wonderful plan of suddenly snapping up\r\nKing Stanislaus from the streets of Warsaw one night, [\"3d November,\r\n1771.\"] and of locking him away (by no means killing him), as the source\r\nof all our woes. O my Pulawskis, men not without manhood, what a bedlam\r\nof a Time have you and I fallen into, and what Causes of Freedom it has\r\ngot in hand!\r\n\r\nBar, a poor place, with no defences but a dry ditch and some miserable\r\nearthworks, the Confederates had not the least chance to maintain;\r\nKaminiec, the only fortress of the Province, they never even got into,\r\nfinding some fraction of royal soldiery who stood for King Stanislaus\r\nthere, and who fired on the Confederates when applied to. Bar a small\r\nRussian division, with certain Stanislaus soldieries conjoined, took by\r\ncapitulation; and (date not given) entered in a victorious manner. The\r\nWar-Epic of the Confederates, which Rulhiere sings at such length, is\r\nblank of meaning.\r\n\r\nOf \"Cloister Czenstochow,\" a famed feat of Pulawski's, also without\r\nresult, I could not from my Rulhiere discover (what was altogether an\r\nilluminative fact to me!) that the date of Czenstochow was not till\r\n1771. A feat of \"Cloister BERDICZOW,\" almost an exact facsimile by the\r\nsame Pulawski, also resultless, I did, under Hermann's guidance, at\r\nonce find;--and hope the reader will be satisfied to accept it instead:\r\nCloister Berdiczow, which lies in the Palatinate of Kiow; and which\r\nhas a miraculous Holy Virgin, not less venerated far and wide in those\r\neastern parts, than she of Cloister Czenstochow in the western: THIS\r\nCloister Berdiczow and its salutary Virgin, Pulawski (the Casimir, now\r\nof Charleston Harbor) did defend, with about 1,000 men, in a really\r\nobstinate way, The Monastery itself had in it gifts of the faithful,\r\naccumulated for ages; and all the richest people in those Provinces,\r\nConfederate or not, had lodged their preciosities there, as in an\r\nimpregnable and sure place, in those times of trouble. Intensely\r\ndesirous, accordingly, the Russians were to take it, but had no cannon;\r\ndesperately resolute Pulawski and his 1,000 to defend. Pulawski and his\r\n1,000 fired intensely, till their cannon-balls were quite done; then\r\ntook to firing with iron-work, and hard miscellanies of every sort,\r\nespecially glad when they could get a haul of glass to load with;--and\r\nabsolutely would not yield till famine came; though the terms offered\r\nwere good,--had they been kept.\r\n\r\nSo that Pulawski, it would appear, did Two Cloister Defences? Two, each\r\nwith a miraculous Holy Virgin; an eastern, and then a westerly. This of\r\nBerdiczow, not dated to me farther, is for certain of the year 1768;\r\nand Pulawski, owing to famine, did yield here. In 1771, at miraculous\r\nCloister Czenstochow, in the western parts, Pulawski did an external\r\nfeat, or consented to see it done,--that of trying to snuff out poor\r\nKing Stanislaus on the streets (3d November, 10 P.M., \"miraculously\" in\r\nvain, as most readers know),--which brought its obloquies and troubles\r\non the Defender of Czenstochow. Obloquies and troubles: but as to\r\nsurrendering Czenstochow on call of obloquy, or of famine itself,\r\nPulawski would not, not he for his own part; but solemnly left his men\r\nto do it, and walked away by circuitous uncertain paths, which end in\r\nCharleston Harbor, as we have seen. [At Savannah, in a stricter sense.\r\n\"Perished at the Siege [futile attempt to storm, by the French, which\r\nthey called a Siege] of Savannah, 9th October, 1779.\"] Defence of\r\nCzenstochow in 1771 shall not concern us farther. Truly these two small\r\ndefences of monasteries by Pulawski are almost all, I do not say of\r\nglorious, but even of creditable or human, that reward the poor wanderer\r\nin that Polish Valley of Jehoshaphat, much of it peat-country; wherefore\r\nI have, as before, marked the approximate localities, approximate dates,\r\nfor behoof of ingenuous readers.\r\n\r\nThe Russians, ever since 1764, from the beginnings of those Stanislaus\r\ntimes, are pledged to maintain peace in Poland; and it is they that\r\nhave to deal with this affair,--they especially, or almost wholly, poor\r\nStanislaus having scarcely any power, military or other, and perhaps\r\nbeing loath withal. There was more of investigating and parleying,\r\nbargaining and intriguing, than of fighting, on Stanislaus's part. \"June\r\n11th, 1768,\" says a Saxon Note from Warsaw, \"Mokranowski, Stanislaus's\r\nGeneral [the same that was with Friedrich], has been sent down to Bar to\r\nlook into those Confederates. Mokranowski does not think there are\r\nabove 8,000 of them; about 3,000 have got their death from Russian\r\ncastigation. The 8,000 might be treated with, only Russians are so\r\ndreadfully severe, especially so intent on wringing money from them.\r\nConfederates have been complaining to the Turk; Turk ambiguous; gives\r\nthem no definite ground of hope. 'What then, is your hope?' I inquired.\r\n'Little or none, except in Heaven,' several answered: 'it is for our\r\nreligion and our liberty:' religion cut to pieces by this Dissident\r\nToleration-blasphemy; liberty ditto by the Russian guarantee of peace\r\namong us: 'what can we do but trust in God and our own despair?'\"\r\n[\"Essen's Report, 11th June, 1768\" (in HERMANN, v. 441).] \"Prave worts,\r\nAncient Pistol,\"--but much destitute of sense, and not to be realized in\r\npresent circumstances. Here is something much more critical:--\r\n\r\nJUNE-JULY, 1768. \"The peasants in the Southern regions, Palatinates\r\nPodol, Kiow, Braclaw, called UKRAINE or Border-Country by the Poles,\r\nare mostly of Greek and other schismatic creeds. Their Lords are of\r\nan orthodox religion, and not distinguished by mild treatment of such\r\nPeasantry, upon whom civil war and plunder have been latterly a\r\nsore visitation. To complete the matter, the Confederates in certain\r\nquarters, blown upon by fanatical priests, set about converting these\r\npoor peasants, or forcing them, at the point of the bayonet, to swear\r\nthat they adopt the 'Greek united rite,' which I suppose to be a kind\r\nof half-way house towards perfect orthodoxy. In one Village, which was\r\ngetting converted in this manner, the military party seemed to be small;\r\nthe Village boiled over upon it; trampled orthodoxy and military both\r\nunder foot, in a violent and sanguinary manner; and was extremely\r\nfrightened when it had done. Extremely frightened, not the Village only,\r\nbut the schismatic mind generally in those parts, dreading vengeance for\r\nsuch a paroxysm. But the atrocious Russians whispered them, 'We are here\r\nto protect you in your religions and rights, in your poor consciences\r\nand skins.' Upon which hint of the atrocious Russians, the schismatic\r\nmind and population one and all rose; and, 'with the cannibal's\r\nferocity, gave way to their appetite for plunder!'...\r\n\r\n\"Nay, the Russian Government [certain Russian Officials hard pressed]\r\nhad invited the Zaporavian Cossacks to step over from their Islands in\r\nthe Dniester, and assist in defending their Religion [true Greek, of\r\ncourse]; who at once did so; and not only extinguished the last glimmer\r\nof Confederation there, but overwhelmed the Country, thousands on\r\nthousands of them, attended by revolted peasants,--say a 20,000 of\r\npeasants under command of these Zaporavians,--who went about plundering\r\nand burning. That they plundered the Jew pot-houses of their brandy,\r\nand drank it, was a small matter. Very furious upon Jews, upon Noblemen,\r\nLandlords, upon Catholic Priests. 'On one tree [tree should have been\r\nnoted] was found hanged a specimen of each of those classes, with a Dog\r\nadjoined, as fit company.' In one little Town, Town of HUMAN [so called\r\nin that foreign dialect], getting some provocation or other, they set to\r\nmassacring; and if brandy were plentiful, we can suppose they made short\r\nwork. By the lowest computation the number of slain Jews and Catholics\r\namounted to 10,000 odd [Hermann, v. 444; Rulhiere, iii. 93.]--Rulhiere\r\nsays '50,000, by some accounts 200,000.'\" This I guess to have been at\r\nits height about the end of June; this leads direct to the Catastrophe,\r\nas will presently be seen.\r\n\r\nForeign States don't seem to pay much attention,--indeed, what sane\r\nperson would like to interfere, or hope to do it with profit? France,\r\nAustria, both wish well to Poland, at least ill to Russia; Choiseul has\r\nno finance, can do nothing but intrigue, and stir up trouble everywhere:\r\na devout Kaiserinn goes with Holy Church, and disapproves of these\r\nDissident Tolerations: it is remarked that all through 1768 the\r\nConfederates of Bar are permitted to retire over the Austrian Frontier\r\ninto Austrian Silesia, and find themselves there in safety. Permitted to\r\nbuy arms, to make preparations, issue orders: at Sulkowski's Bilitz, in\r\nthe Duchy of Teschen, supreme Managing Committee sits there; no Kaunitz\r\nor Official person meddling with it. About the beginning of next year\r\n(1769), it is, ostensibly, a little discountenanced; and obliged to go\r\nto Eperjes, on the Hungarian Frontier [See Busching: for Eperjes, ii.\r\n1427; for Bilitz, viii. 885.] (as a more decent or less conspicuous\r\nplace),--such trouble now rising; a Turk War having broken\r\nout, momentous not to the Confederation alone. March, 1769, the\r\never-intriguing Choiseul--fancy with what rapturous effect--had sent\r\nsome kind of Agent or Visitor to Teschen; Vergennes in Turkey, from the\r\nbeginning of these things, has been plying night and day his diplomatic\r\nbellows upon every live-coal (\"I who myself kindled this Turk-War!\"\r\nbrags he afterwards);--not till next year (1770) did Choiseul send\r\nhis Dumouriez to the Bilitz neighborhoods; not till next again, when\r\nChoiseul was himself out, [Thrown out \"2d December, 1770,\"--by Louis's\r\nNEW Pompadour.] did his Viomenil come: [Hermann, v. 469-471; in RULHIERE\r\n(iv. 241-289) account of Dumouries and his fencings and spyings, still\r\nmore of Viomenil, who had \"French Volunteers,\" and did some bits of real\r\nfighting on the small scale.] neither of whom, by their own head alone,\r\nwithout funds, without troops, could do other than with fine effort make\r\nbad worse.\r\n\r\nIt is needless continuing such a subject. Here is one glimpse two years\r\nlater, and it shall be our last: \"NEAR LUBLIN, 25th SEPTEMBER, 1770. It\r\nis frightful, all this that is passing in these parts,--about the Town\r\nof Labun, for example. The dead bodies remain without burial; they are\r\ndevoured by the dogs and the pigs. ... Everywhere reigns Pestilence; nor\r\ndo we fear contagion so much as famine. Offer 100 ducats for a fowl\r\nor for a bit of bread, I swear you won't get it. General von Essen\r\n[Russian, we will hope] has had to escape from Laticzew, then from\" some\r\nother place, \"Pestilence chasing him everywhere.\"\r\n\r\nTo apply to the Turks,--afflicted Polish Patriots prostrating themselves\r\nwith the hope of despair, \"Save us, your sublime Clemency; throw a ray\r\nof pity on us, Brother of the Sun and Moon: oh, chastise our\r\ndiabolic oppressors!\"--this was one of the first resources of the Bar\r\nConfederates. The Turks did give ear; not inattentive, though pretending\r\nto be rather deaf. M. de Vergennes,--of whose \"diplomatic bellows\" we\r\njust heard (in fact, for diligence in this Turk element, in this young\r\ntime, the like of him was seldom seen; we knew him long afterwards as\r\na diligent old gentleman, in French-Revolution days),--M. de Vergennes\r\nzealously supports; zealous to let loose the Turk upon Anti-French\r\nparties. The Turks seem to wag their heads, for some time; and their\r\nresponses are ambiguous. For some time, not for long. Here, fast enough,\r\ncomes, in disguised shape, the Catastrophe itself, ye poor plaintive\r\nPoles!\r\n\r\nJULY-OCTOBER, 1768. Those Zaporavian and other Cossacks, with 20,000\r\npeasants plundering about on both sides of the Dniester, had set fire to\r\nthe little Town of Balta, which is on the south side, and belongs to\r\nthe Turks: a very grave accident, think all political people, think\r\nespecially the Foreign Excellencies at Warsaw, when news of it arrives.\r\nBurning of Balta, not to be quenched by the amplest Russian apologies,\r\nproved a live-coal at Constantinople; and Vergennes says, he set\r\npopulation and Divan on fire by it: a proof that the population and\r\nDivan had already been in a very inflammable state. Not a wise Divan,\r\nthough a zealous. Plenty of fury in these people; but a sad deficiency\r\nof every other faculty. They made haste, in their hot humor, to declare\r\nWar (6th October, 1768); [Hermann, v. 608-611.] not considering much how\r\nthey would carry it on. Declared themselves in late Autumn,--as if to\r\ngive the Russians ample time for preparing; those poor Turks\r\nthemselves being as yet ready with nothing, and even the season for\r\nfield-operations being over.\r\n\r\nKing Friedrich, who has still a Minister at the Porte, endeavored to\r\ndissuade his old Turk friends, in this rash crisis; but to no purpose;\r\nthey would listen to nothing but Vergennes and their own fury. Friedrich\r\nfinds this War a very mad one on the part of his old Turk friends; their\r\npromptitude to go into it (he has known them backward enough when\r\ntheir chances were better!), and their way of carrying it on, are alike\r\nsurprising to him. He says: \"Catharine's Generals were unacquainted with\r\nthe first elements of Castrametation and Tactic; but the Generals of the\r\nSultan had a still more prodigious depth of ignorance; so that to form a\r\ncorrect idea of this War, you must figure a set of purblind people, who,\r\nby constantly beating a set of altogether blind, end by gaining over\r\nthem a complete mastery.\" [_OEuvres de Frederic,_ vi. 23, 24.] This,\r\nas Friedrich knows, is what Austria cannot suffer; this is what\r\nwill involve Austria and Russia, and Friedrich along with them,\r\nin--Friedrich, as the matter gradually unfolds itself, shudders to think\r\nwhat. The beginnings of this War were perhaps almost comical to the\r\nold Soldier-King; but as it gradually developed itself into complete\r\nshattering to pieces of the stupid Blind by the ambitious Purblind, he\r\ngrew abundantly serious upon it.\r\n\r\nIt is but six months since Polish Patriotism, so effulgent to its own\r\neyes in Orthodoxy, in Love of glorious Liberty, confederated at Bar,\r\nand got into that extraordinary whirlpool, or cesspool, of miseries\r\nand deliriums we have been looking at; and now it has issued on a broad\r\nhighway of progress,--broad and precipitous,--and will rapidly arrive\r\nat the goal set before it. All was so rapid, on the Polish and on the\r\nTurkish part. The blind Turks, out of mere fanaticism and heat of humor,\r\nhave rushed into this adventure;--and go rushing forward into a series\r\nof chaotic platitudes on the huge scale, and mere tragical disasters,\r\nyear after year, which would have been comical, had they not been so\r\nhideous and sanguinary: constant and enormous blunders on the Turk\r\npart, issuing in disasters of like magnitude; which in the course of\r\nTwo Campaigns had quite finished off their Polish friends, in a very\r\nunexpected way; and had like to have finished themselves off, had not\r\ndrowned Poland served as a stepping-stone.\r\n\r\nNot till March 26th, 1769, six months after declaring in such haste,\r\ndid the blind Turks \"display their Banner of Mahomet,\" that is, begin\r\nin earnest to assemble and make ready. Nor were the Russians shiningly\r\nstrategic, though sooner in the field,--a Prince Galitzin commanding\r\nthem (an extremely purblind person); till replaced by Romanzow, our old\r\nColberg acquaintance, who saw considerably better. Galitzin, early in\r\nthe season, made a rush on Choczim (ChoTzim), the first Turk Fort beyond\r\nthe Dniester; and altogether failed,--not by Turk prowess, but by his\r\nown purblind mal-arrangements (want of ammunition, want of bread, or I\r\nwill forget what);--which occasioned mighty grumblings in Russia:\r\ntill in a month or two, by favor of Fortune and blindness of the Turk,\r\nmatters had come well round again; and Galitzin, walking up to Choczim\r\nthe second time, found there was not a Turk in the place, and that\r\nChoczim was now his on those uncommonly easy terms!\r\n\r\nInstead of farther details on such a War,--the shadow or reflex of\r\nwhich, as mirrored in the Austrian mind, has an importance to Friedrich\r\nand us; but the self or substance of which has otherwise little or\r\nnone,--we will close here with a bit of Russian satire on it, which is\r\nstill worth reading. The date is evidently Spring, 1769; the scene what\r\nwe are now treating of: Galitzin obliged to fall back from Choczim;\r\ngreat rumor--\"What a Galitzin; what a Turk War his, in contrast to\r\nthe last we had!\" [Turk War of 1736-1739, under Munnich (supra, vii.\r\n81-126).]--no Romanzow yet appointed in his room. And here is a small\r\nManuscript, which was then circulating fresh and new in Russian Society;\r\nand has since gone over all the world (though mostly in an uncertain\r\ncondition, in old Jest-Books and the like), as a genuine bit of CAVIARE\r\nfrom those Northern parts:--\r\n\r\nMANUSCRIPT CIRCULATING IN RUSSIAN SOCIETY. Galitzin, much grieved about\r\nChoczim, could not sleep; and, wandering about in his tent, overheard,\r\none night, a common soldier recounting his dream to the sentry outside\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n\"A curious dream,\" said the soldier: \"I dreamt I was in a battle; that\r\nI got my head cut off; that I died; and, of course, went to Heaven.\r\nI knocked at the door: Peter came with a bunch of Keys; and made such\r\nrattling that he awoke God; who started up in haste, asking, 'What is\r\nthe matter?' 'Why,' says Peter, 'there is a great War on earth between\r\nthe Russians and the Turks.' 'And who commands my Russians?' said the\r\nSupreme Being. 'Count Munnich,' answered Peter. 'Very well; I may go\r\nto sleep again!'--But this was not the end of my dream,\" continued\r\nthe soldier; \"I fell asleep and dreamt again, the very same as before,\r\nexcept that the War was not Count Munnich's, but the one we are now in.\r\nAccordingly, when God asked, 'Who commands my Russians?' Peter answered,\r\n'Prince Galitzin.' 'Galitzin? Then get me my boots!' said the [Russian]\r\nSupreme Being.\" [W. Richardson (then at Petersburg, Tutor to Excellency\r\nCathcart's Children; afterwards Professor at Glasgow, and a man of\r\nSome reputation in his old age), _Anecdotes of the Russian Empire, in a\r\nSeries of Letters written a few years ago from St. Petersburg_ (London,\r\n1784), p. 110: date of this Letter is \"17th October, 1769.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV.--PARTITION OF POLAND.\r\n\r\nThese Polish phenomena were beginning to awaken a good deal of\r\nattention, not all of it pleasant, on the part of Friedrich. From the\r\nfirst he had, as usual, been a most clear-eyed observer of everything;\r\nand found the business, as appears, not of tragical nature, but of\r\nexpensive-farcical, capable to shake the diaphragm rather than touch the\r\nheart of a reflective on-looker. He has a considerable Poem on it,--WAR\r\nOF THE CONFEDERATES by title (in the old style of the PALLADION,\r\nimitating an unattainable JEANNE D'ARC),--considerable Poem, now\r\nforming itself at leisure in his thoughts, [\"LA GUERRE DES CONFEDERES\r\n[_OEuvres,_ xiv. 183 et seq.], finished in November, 1771.\"] which\r\ndecidedly takes that turn; and laughs quite loud at the rabid\r\nfanaticisms, blusterous inanities and imbecilities of these noisy\r\nunfortunate neighbors:--old unpleasant style of the PALLADION and\r\nPUCELLE; but much better worth reading; having a great deal of sharp\r\nsense in its laughing guise, and more of real Historical Discernment\r\nthan you will find in any other Book on that delirious subject.\r\n\r\nMuch a laughing-stock to this King hitherto, such a \"War of the\r\nConfederates,\"--consisting of the noisiest, emptiest bedlam tumults,\r\nseasoned by a proportion of homicide, and a great deal of battery and\r\narson. But now, with a Russian-Turk War springing from it, or already\r\nsprung, there are quite serious aspects rising amid the laughable. By\r\nTreaty, this War is to cost the King either a 12,000 of Auxiliaries to\r\nthe Czarina, or a 72,000 pounds (480,000 thalers) annually; [_OEuvres\r\nde Frederic,_ vi. 13.]--which latter he prefers to pay her, as the\r\nalternative: not an agreeable feature at all; but by no means the worst\r\nfeature. Suppose it lead to Russian conquests on the Turk, to Austrian\r\ncomplicacies, to one knows not what, and kindle the world round one\r\nagain! In short, we can believe Friedrich was very willing to stand well\r\nwith next-door neighbors at present, and be civil to Austria and its\r\nyoung Kaiser's civilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST INTERVIEW BETWEEN FRIEDRICH AND KAISER JOSEPH (Neisse, 25th-28th\r\nAugust, 1769).\r\n\r\nIn 1766, the young Kaiser, who has charge of the Military Department,\r\nand of little else in the Government, and is already a great traveller,\r\nand enthusiastic soldier, made a pilgrimage over the Bohemian and Saxon\r\nBattle-fields of the Seven-Years War. On some of them, whether on all\r\nI do not know, he set up memorial-stones; one of which you still see\r\non the field of Lobositz;--of another on Prag field, and of reverent\r\nsalutation by Artillery to the memory of Schwerin there, we heard long\r\nago. Coming to Torgau on this errand, the Kaiser, through his Berlin\r\nMinister, had signified his \"particular desire to make acquaintance\r\nwith the King in returning;\" to which the King was ready with the\r\nreadiest;--only that Kaunitz and the Kaiserinn, in the interim, judged\r\nit improper, and stopped it. \"The reported Interview is not to take\r\nplace,\" Friedrich warns the Newspapers; \"having been given up, though\r\nonly from courtesy, on some points of ceremonial.\" [\"FRIEDRICH TO ONE OF\r\nHIS FOREIGN AMBASSADORS\" (the common way of announcing in Newspapers):\r\nPreuss, iv. 22 n.]\r\n\r\nThe young Kaiser felt a little huffed; and signified to Friedrich that\r\nhe would find a time to make good this bit of uncivility, which his\r\npedagogues had forced upon him. And now, after three years, August,\r\n1769, on occasion of the Silesian Reviews, the Kaiser is to come across\r\nfrom his Bohemian businesses, and actually visit him: Interview to be\r\nat Neisse, 25th August, 1769, for three days. Of course the King was\r\npunctual, everybody was punctual, glad and cordial after a sort,--no\r\nceremony, the Kaiser, officially incognito, is a mere Graf von\r\nFalkenstein, come to see his Majesty's Reviews. There came with him four\r\nor five Generals, Loudon one of them; Lacy had preceded: Friedrich is in\r\nthe palace of the place, ready and expectant. With Friedrich are: Prince\r\nHenri; Prince of Prussia; Margraf of Anspach: Friedrich's Nephew (Lady\r\nCraven's Margraf, the one remnant now left there); and some Generals and\r\nMilitary functionaries, Seidlitz the notablest figure of these. And so,\r\nFRIDAY, AUGUST 25th, shortly after noon--But the following Two Letters,\r\nby an Eye-witness, will be preferable; and indeed are the only real\r\nNarrative that can be given:--\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 1. ENGINEER LEFEBVRE TO PERPETUAL SECRETARY FORMEY (at Berlin).\r\n\r\n\"NEISSE, 26th [partly 25th] August, 1769.\r\n\r\n\"MY MOST WORTHY FRIEND,-I make haste to inform you of the Kaiser's\r\narrival here at Neisse, this day, 25th August, 1769, at one in the\r\nafternoon. The King had spent the morning in a proof Manoeuvre, making\r\nrehearsal of the Manoeuvre that was to be. When the Kaiser was reported\r\njust coming, the King went to the window of the grand Episcopal Saloon,\r\nand seeing him alight from his carriage, turned round and said, 'JE L'AI\r\nVU (I have seen him).' His Majesty then went to receive him on the\r\ngrand staircase [had hardly descended three or four steps], where they\r\nembraced; and then his Majesty led by the hand his august Guest into\r\nthe Apartments designed for him, which were all standing open and\r\nready,\"--which, however, the august Guest will not occupy except with\r\na grateful imagination, being for the present incognito, mere Graf von\r\nFalkenstein, and judging that THE THREE-KINGS Inn will be suitabler.\r\n\r\n\"Arrived in the Apartments, they embraced anew; and sat talking together\r\nfor an hour and half.--[The talk, unknown to Lefebvre, began in this\r\nstrain. KAISER: \"Now are my wishes fulfilled, since I have the honor to\r\nembrace the greatest of Kings and Soldiers.\" KING: \"I look upon this day\r\nas the fairest of my life; for it will become the epoch of uniting Two\r\nHouses which have been enemies too long, and whose mutual interests\r\nrequire that they should strengthen, not weaken one another.\" KAISER:\r\n\"For Austria there is no Silesia farther.\" [Preuss, v. 23; _OEuvres de\r\nFrederic,_ vi. 25, 26.] Talk, it appears, lasted an hour and half.]\r\n\r\n--\"The Kaiser [continues our Engineer] had brought with him the Prince\r\nof Sachsen-Teschen [his august Brother-in-law, Duke of Teschen, son\r\nof the late Polish Majesty of famous memory]: afterwards there came\r\nFeldmarschall Lacy, Graf von Dietrichstein, General von Loudon,\" and\r\nthree others of no account to us. \"At the King's table were the Kaiser,\r\nthe Prince of Prussia [dissolute young Heir-Apparent, of the polygamous\r\ntendency], Prince Henri, the Margraf of Anspach [King's Nephew,\r\nunfortunate Lady-Craven Margraf, ultimately of Hammersmith vicinity];\r\nthe above Generals of the Austrian suite, and Generals Seidlitz and\r\nTauentzien. The rest of the Court was at two other tables.\" Of the\r\ndinner itself an Outside Individual will say nothing.\r\n\r\n\"The Kaiser, having expressly requested the King to let him lodge in an\r\nInn (THREE KINGS), under the name of Graf von Falkenstein, would not\r\ngo into the carriage which had stood expressly ready to conduct him\r\nthither. He preferred walking on foot [the loftily scornful Incognito]\r\nin spite of the rain; it was like a lieutenant of infantry stepping out\r\nof his quarters. Some moments after, the King went to visit him; and\r\nthey remained together from 5 in the evening till 8. It was thought they\r\nwould be present (ASSISTER) at a Comic Opera which was to be played: but\r\nafter waiting till 7 o'clock, the people received orders to go on with\r\nthe Piece;\"--both Majesties did afterwards look in; but finding it bad,\r\nsoon went their way again. (MAJOR LEFEBVRE STOPS WRITING FOR THE NIGHT.)\r\n\r\n\"This morning, 26th, the Manoeuvre [rehearsed yesterday] has been\r\nperformed before both their Majesties; the troops, by way of finish,\r\nfiling past them in the highest order. The Kaiser accompanied the King\r\nto his abode; after which he returned to his own. This is all the news\r\nI have to-day: the sequel by next Post (apparently a week hence). I am,\r\nand shall ever be,--your true Friend, LEFEBVRE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 2. SAME TO SAME.\r\n\r\n\"NEISSE, 2d September, 1769.\r\n\r\n\"MONSIEUR AND DEAREST FRIEND,--We had, as you heard, our first Manoeuvre\r\non Saturday, 26th, in presence of the Kaiser and the King, and of the\r\nwhole Court of each. That evening there was Opera; which their Majesties\r\nhonored by attending. Sunday was our Second Manoeuvre; OPERETTE in the\r\nevening. Monday, 28th, was our last Manoeuvre; at the end of which the\r\ntwo Majesties, without alighting from horseback, embraced each other;\r\nand parted, protesting mutually the most constant and inviolable\r\nfriendship. One took the road for Breslau; the other that of\r\nKonigsgratz. All the time the Kaiser was here, they have been\r\ncontinually talking together, and exhibiting the tenderest\r\nfriendship,--from which I cannot but think there will benefit result.\r\n\r\n\"I am almost in the mind of coming to pass this Winter at Berlin; that\r\nI may have the pleasure of embracing you,--perhaps as cordially as King\r\nand Kaiser here. I am, and shall always be, with all my heart,--your\r\nvery good Friend, \"LEFEBVRE.\" [Formey, _Souvenirs d'un Citoyen,_ ii.\r\n145-148.]\r\n\r\nThe Lefebvre that writes here is the same who was set to manage the\r\nlast Siege of Schweidnitz, by Globes of Compression and other fine\r\ninventions; and almost went out of his wits because he could not do it.\r\nAn expert ingenious creature; skilful as an engineer; had been brought\r\ninto Friedrich's service by the late Balbi, during Balbi's ascendency\r\n(which ended at Olmutz long ago). At Schweidnitz, and often elsewhere,\r\nFriedrich, who had an esteem for poor Lefebvre, was good to him; and\r\ntreated his excitabilities with a soft hand, not a rough. Once at Neisse\r\n(1771, second year after these Letters), on looking round at the\r\nworks done since last review, in sight of all the Garrison he embraced\r\nLefebvre, while commending his excellent performance; which filled the\r\npoor soul with a now unimaginable joy.\r\n\r\n\"HELAS,\" says Formey, \"the poor Gentleman wrote to me of his endless\r\nsatisfaction; and how he hoped to get through his building, and retire\r\non half-pay this very season, thenceforth to belong to the Academy and\r\nme; he had been Member for twenty years past.\" With this view, thinks\r\nFormey, he most likely hastened on his buildings too fast: certain\r\nit is, a barrack he was building tumbled suddenly, and some workmen\r\nperished in the ruins. \"Enemies at Court suggested,\" or the accident\r\nitself suggested without any enemy, \"Has not he been playing false,\r\nusing cheap bad materials?\"--and Friedrich ordered him arrest in his own\r\nApartments, till the question were investigated. Excitable Lefebvre was\r\nlike to lose his wits, almost to leap out of his skin. \"One evening at\r\nsupper, he managed to smuggle away a knife; and, in the course of the\r\nnight, gave himself sixteen stabs with it; which at length sufficed. The\r\nKing said, 'He has used himself worse than I should have done;' and was\r\nvery sorry.\" Of Lefebvre's scientific structures, globes of compression\r\nand the rest, I know not whether anything is left; the above Two Notes,\r\nthrown off to Formey, were accidentally a hit, and, in the great blank,\r\nmay last a long while.\r\n\r\nThe King found this young Kaiser a very pretty man; and could have\r\nliked him considerably, had their mutual positions permitted. \"He had a\r\nfrankness of manner which seemed natural to him,\" says the King; \"in his\r\namiable character, gayety and great vivacity were prominent features.\"\r\nBy accidental chinks, however, one saw \"an ambition beyond measure\"\r\nburning in the interior of this young man, [_OEuvres de Frederic,_ (in\r\n_Memoires de 1763 jusqu'a_ 1775, a Chapter which yields the briefest,\r\nand the one completely intelligible account we yet have of those\r\naffairs), vi. 25.]--let an old King be wary. A three days, clearly,\r\nto be marked in chalk; radiant outwardly to both; to a certain depth,\r\nsincere; and uncommonly pleasant for the time. King and Kaiser were seen\r\nwalking about arm in arm. At one of the Reviews a Note was brought to\r\nFriedrich: he read it, a Note from her Imperial Majesty; and handing it\r\nto Kaiser Joseph, kissed it first. At parting, he had given Joseph,\r\nby way of keepsake, a copy of Marechal de Saxe's REVERIES (a strange\r\nMilitary Farrago, dictated, I should think, under opium [\"MES REVERIES;\r\nOUVRAGE POSTHUME, par\" &c. (2 vols. 4to: Amsterdam et Leipzig, 1757).]):\r\nthis Book lay continually thereafter on the Kaiser's night-table; and\r\nwas found there at his death, Twenty-one years hence,--not a page of\r\nit read, the leaves all sticking together under their bright gilding.\r\n[Preuss, iv. 24 n.]\r\n\r\nIt was long believed, by persons capable of seeing into millstones,\r\nthat, under cover of this Neisse Interview, there were important\r\nPolitical negotiations and consultings carried on;--that here, and in\r\na Second Interview or Return-Visit, of which presently, lay the real\r\nfoundation of the Polish Catastrophe. What of Political passed at the\r\nSecond Interview readers shall see for themselves, from an excellent\r\nAuthority. As to what passed at the present (\"mutual word-of-honor:\r\nshould England and France quarrel, we will stand neutral\" [_OEuvres\r\nde Frederic,_ ubi supra.]), it is too insignificant for being shown to\r\nreaders. Dialogues there were, delicately holding wide of the mark, and\r\nat length coming close enough; but, at neither the one Interview nor the\r\nother, was Poland at all a party concerned,--though, beyond doubt, the\r\nTurk War was; silently this first time, and with clear vocality on the\r\nsecond occasion.\r\n\r\nIn spite of Galitzin's blunders, the Turk War is going on at a fine rate\r\nin these months; Turks, by the hundred thousand, getting scattered\r\nin panic rout:--but we will say nothing of it just yet. Polish\r\nConfederation--horror-struck, as may be imagined, at its auxiliary\r\nBrother of the Sun and Moon and his performances--is weltering in\r\nviolently impotent spasms into deeper and ever deeper wretchedness,\r\nFriedrich sometimes thinking of a Burlesque Poem on the subject;--though\r\nthe Russian successes, and the Austrian grudgings and gloomings, are\r\nrising on him as a very serious consideration. \"Is there no method,\r\nthen, of allowing Russia to prosecute its Turk War in spite of Austria\r\nand its umbrages?\" thinks Friedrich sometimes, in his anxieties about\r\nPeace in Europe:--\"If the Ukraine, and its meal for the Armies, were\r\nbut Russia's! At present, Austria can strike in there, cut off the\r\nprovisions, and at once put a spoke in Russia's wheel.\" Friedrich tells\r\nus, \"he (ON,\" the King himself, what I do not find in any other Book)\r\n\"sent to Petersburg, under the name of Count Lynar, the seraphic\r\nDanish Gentleman, who, in 1757, had brought about the Convention of\r\nKloster-Zeven, a Project, or Sketch of Plan, for Partitioning certain\r\nProvinces of Poland, in that view;\"--the Lynar opining, so far as I can\r\nsee, somewhat as follows: \"Russia to lay hold of the essential bit of\r\nPolish Territory for provisioning itself against the Turk, and allow to\r\nAustria and Prussia certain other bits; which would content everybody,\r\nand enable Russia and Christendom to extrude and suppress AD LIBITUM\r\nthat abominable mass of Mahometan Sensualism, Darkness and Fanaticism\r\nfrom the fairest part of God's Creation.\" An excellent Project, though\r\nnot successful! \"To which Petersburg, intoxicated with its own outlooks\r\non Turkey, paid not the least attention,\" says the King. [_OEuvres de\r\nFrederic,_ vi. 26.] He gives no date to this curious statement; nor\r\ndoes anybody else mention it at all; but we may fancy it to have been of\r\nWinter, 1769-1770,--and leave it with the curious, or the idly curious,\r\nsince nothing came of it now or afterwards.\r\n\r\nPOTSDAM, 20th-29th OCTOBER, 1769. Only two months after Neisse, what\r\nkindles Potsdam into sudden splendor, Electress Marie-Antoine makes a\r\nVisit of nine days to the King. \"In July last,\" says a certain Note of\r\nours, \"the Electress was invited to Berlin, to a Wedding; 'would have\r\nbeen delighted to come, but letter of invitation arrived too late. Will,\r\nhowever, not give up the plan of seeing the great Friedrich.' Comes to\r\nPotsdam 20th-29th October. Stays nine days; much delighted, both, with\r\nthe visit. 'Magnificent palaces, pleasant gardens, ravishing concerts,\r\ncharming Princes and Princesses: the pleasantest nine days I ever had\r\nin my life,' says the Electress. Friedrich grants, to her intercession,\r\npardon for some culprit. 'DIVA ANTONIA' he calls her henceforth for some\r\ntime; she him, 'PLUS GRAND DES MORTELS,' 'SALOMON DU NORD,' and the\r\nlike names.\" [_OEuvres de Frederic,_ (CORRESPONDANCE AVEC L'ELECTRICE\r\nMARIE-ANTOINE), xxiv. 179-186.] Next year too (September 26th-October\r\n5th, 1770), the bright Lady made a second visit; [Rodenbeck, iii. 24.]\r\nno third,--the times growing too political, perhaps; the times not\r\nsuiting. The Correspondence continues to the end; and is really pretty.\r\nAnd would be instructive withal, were it well edited. For example,--if\r\nwe might look backwards, and shoot a momentary spark into the vacant\r\ndarkness of the Past,--Friedrich wrote (the year before this):--\r\n\r\nPOTSDAM, 3d MAY, 1768.... \"Jesuits have got all cut adrift: A dim rumor\r\nspreads that his Holiness will not rest with that first anathema, but\r\nthat a fulminating Bull is coming out against the Most Christian, the\r\nMost Catholic and the Most Faithful. If that be so, my notion is, Madam,\r\nthat the Holy Father, to fill his table, will admit the Defender of the\r\nFaith [poor George III.] and your Servant; for it does not suit a Pope\r\nto sit solitary....\r\n\r\n\"A pity for the human race, Madam, that men cannot be tranquil,--but\r\nthey never and nowhere can! Not even the little Town of Neufchatel but\r\nhas had its troubles; your Royal Highness will be astonished to learn\r\nhow. A Parson there [this was above seven years ago, in old Marischal's\r\nreign [See Letters to Marischal, \"Leipzig, 9th March, 1761,\" \"Breslau,\r\n14th May, 1762:\" in _OEuvres de Frederic,_ xx. 282, 287.]] had set forth\r\nin a sermon, That considering the immense mercy of God, the pains of\r\nHell could not last forever. The Synod shouted murder at such scandal;\r\nand has been struggling, ever since, to get the Parson exterminated. The\r\naffair was of my jurisdiction; for your Royal Highness must know that I\r\nam Pope in that Country;--here is my decision: Let the parsons, who make\r\nfor themselves a cruel and barbarous God, be eternally damned, as they\r\ndesire, and deserve; and let those parsons, who conceive God gentle and\r\nmerciful, enjoy the plenitude of his mercy! However, Madam, my sentence\r\nhas failed to calm men's minds; the schism continues; and the number of\r\nthe damnatory theologians prevails over the others.\" [\"April 2d, 1768\"\r\n(a month before this Letter to Madam), there is \"riot at Neufchatel; and\r\nAvocat Gardot [heterodox Parson's ADVOCATE] killed in it\" (Rodenbeck,\r\nii. 303).]--Or again:--\r\n\r\nPOTSDAM, 1st DECEMBER, 1766. \"At present I have with me my Niece\r\n[Sister's Daughter, of Schwedt], the Duchess of Wurtemberg; who\r\nremembers with pleasure to have had the happiness of seeing your Royal\r\nHighness in former times. She is very unhappy and much to be pitied;\r\nher Husband [Eugen of Wurtemberg, whom we heard much of, and last at\r\nColberg] gives her a deal of trouble: he is a violent man, from whom\r\nshe has everything to fear; who gives her chagrins, and makes her\r\nno allowances. I try my best to bring him to reason;\"--but am little\r\nsuccessful. Three years after this, \"May 3d, 1769,\" we find Eugen, who\r\nonce talked of running his august Reigning Brother through the body, has\r\nended by returning to Stuttgard and him; where, or at Mumpelgard, his\r\nApanage, he continued thenceforth. And was Reigning Duke himself, long\r\nafterwards, for two years, at the very end of his life. [\"Succeeded,\" on\r\nhis Brother Karl's death, \"20th May, 1795; died 23d December, 1797, age\r\n75.\"] At this date of 1766, \"my poor Niece and he\" have been married\r\nthirteen years, and have half a score of children;--the eldest of them\r\nCzar Paul's Second Wife that is to be, and Mother of the now Czars.\r\n\r\nDECEMBER 17th, 1765.... \"I have had 12,360 houses and barns to rebuild,\r\nand am nearly through with that. But how many other wounds remain yet to\r\nbe healed!\"\r\n\r\nJULY 22d, 1766.... \"Wedding festivities of Prince of Prussia. Duchess\r\nof Kingston tipsy on the occasion!\"--But we must not be tempted farther.\r\n[_OEuvres de Frederic,_ xxiv. 90-155.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEXT YEAR THERE IS A SECOND INTERVIEW; FRIEDRICH MAKING A RETURN-VISIT\r\nDURING THE KAISER'S MORAVIAN REVIEWS (Camp of Mahrisch-Neustadt, 3d-7th\r\nSeptember, 1770).\r\n\r\nThe Russian-Turk especially in Second Campaign of it, \"Liberation of\r\nGreece,\" or, failing that, total destruction of the Turk Fleet in Greek\r\nwaters; conquest of Wallachia, as of Moldavia; in a word, imminency of\r\ntotal ruin to the Turk by land and sea,--all this is blazing aloft at\r\nsuch a pitch, in Summer, 1770, that a new Interview upon it may well, to\r\nneighbors so much interested, seem more desirable than ever. Interview\r\naccordingly there is to be: 3d September, and for four days following.\r\n\r\nKaunitz himself attends, this time; something of real business privately\r\nprobable to Kaunitz. Prince Henri is not there; Prince Henri is gone to\r\nSweden; on visit to his Sister, whom he has not seen since boyhood: of\r\nwhich Visit there will be farther mention. Present with the King were:\r\n[Rodenbeck, iii. 21.] the Prince of Prussia (luckier somewhat in his\r\nsecond wedlock, little red-colored Son and Heir born to him just a\r\nmonth ago); [Friedrich Wilhelm III., \"born 3d August, 1770.\"] Prince\r\nFerdinand; two Brunswick Nephews, ERBPRINZ whom we used to hear of, and\r\nLeopold a junior, of whom we shall once or so. No Seidlitz this\r\ntime. Except Lentulus, no General to name. But better for us than\r\nall Generals, in the Kaiser's suite, besides Kaunitz, was Prince de\r\nLigne,--who holds a PEN, as will appear.\r\n\r\n\"Liberation of the Greeks\" had kindled many people, Voltaire among the\r\nnumber, who is still intermittently in correspondence with Friedrich: \"A\r\nmagnificent Czarina about to revivify that true Temple of Mankind, or\r\nat least to sweep the blockhead Turks out of it; what a prospect!\"\r\nFriedrich is quite cool on Greece; not too hot on any part of this\r\nsubject, though intensely concerned about it. Besides his ingenious\r\nCount-Lynar Project, and many other businesses, Friedrich has just been\r\nconfuting Baron d'Holbach's _Systeme de la Nature;_ [\"EXAMEN CRITIQUE\r\nDU SYSTEME DE LA NATURE [in _OEuvres de Frederic,_ ix. 153 et seq.],\r\nfinished July, 1770.\"]--writing to Voltaire, POTSDAM, 18th AUGUST, 1770,\r\non this subject among others, he adds: \"I am going for Silesia, on\r\nthe Reviews. I am to see the Kaiser, who has invited me to his Camp in\r\nMahren. That is an amiable and meritorious Prince; he values your Works,\r\nreads them as diligently as he can; is anything but superstitious: in\r\nbrief, a Kaiser such as Germany has not for a great while had. Neither\r\nhe nor I have any love for the blockhead and barbaric sort;--but that\r\nis no reason for extirpating them: if it were, your Turks [oppressors of\r\nGreece] would not be the only victims!\" [_OEuvres de Frederic,_ xxiii.\r\n165, 166.]\r\n\r\nIn a lengthy Letter, written by request, TO STANISLAUS, KING OF POLAND,\r\n1735, or at a distance of fifteen years from this Interview at Neustadt,\r\nPrince de Ligne, who was present there, has left us some record or\r\nloose lively reminiscence of it; [Prince de Ligne, _Memoires et\r\nMelanges Historiques_ (Par. 1827), i. 3-21.]--sputtering, effervescing,\r\nepigrammatic creature, had he confined himself to a faithful\r\ndescription, and burnt off for us, not like a pretty fire-work, but like\r\nan innocent candle, or thing for seeing by! But we must take what we\r\nhave, and endeavor to be thankful. By great luck, the one topic he\r\ninsists on is Friedrich and his aspect and behavior on the occasion:\r\nwhich is what, of all else in it, we are most concerned with.\r\n\r\n\"You have ordered me, Sire [this was written for him in 1785], to speak\r\nto you of one of the greatest men of this Age. You admire him, though\r\nhis neighborhood has done you mischief enough; and, placing yourself at\r\nthe impartial distance of History, feel a noble curiosity on all that\r\nbelongs to this extraordinary genius. I will, therefore, give you\r\nan exact account of the smallest words that I myself heard the great\r\nFriedrich speak.... The I (LE JE) is odious to me; but nothing is\r\nindifferent when\"--Well, your account, then, your account, without\r\nfarther preambling, and in a more exact way than you are wont!--\r\n\r\n\"By a singular chance, in 1770 [3d-7th September, if you would but\r\ndate], the Kaiser was [for the second time] enabled to deliver himself\r\nto the personal admiration which he had conceived for the King of\r\nPrussia; and these Two great Sovereigns were so well together, that they\r\ncould pay visits. The Kaiser permitted me to accompany; and introduced\r\nme to the King: it was at Neustadt in Moravia [MAHRISCH-NEUSTADT, short\r\nway from AUSTERLITZ, which is since become a celebrated place]. I can't\r\nrecollect if I had, or had assumed, an air of embarrassment; but what I\r\ndo well remember is, that the Kaiser, who noticed my look, said to the\r\nKing, 'He has a timid expression, which I never observed in him before;\r\nhe will recover presently.' This he said in a graceful merry way; and\r\nthe two went out, to go, I believe, to the Play. On the way thither, the\r\nKing for an instant quitting his Imperial Friend, asked me if my LETTER\r\nTO JEAN JACQUES [now an entirely forgotten Piece], which had been\r\nprinted in the Papers, was really by me? I answered, 'Sire, I am not\r\nfamous enough to have my name forged' [as a certain Other name has been,\r\non this same unproductive topic]. He felt what I meant. It is known that\r\nHorace Walpole took the King's name to write his famous LETTRE A JEAN\r\nJACQUES [impossible to attend to the like of it at present], which\r\ncontributed the most to drive mad that eloquent and unreasonable man of\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\n\"Coming out of the Play, the Kaiser said to the King of Prussia: 'There\r\nis Noverre, the famous Composer of Ballets; he has been in Berlin, I\r\nbelieve.' Noverre made thereupon a beautiful dancing-master bow. 'Ah,\r\nI know him,' said the King: 'we saw him at Berlin; he was very droll;\r\nmimicked all the world, especially our chief Dancing Women, to make you\r\nsplit with laughing.' Noverre, ill content with this way of remembering\r\nhim, made another beautiful third-position bow; and hoped possibly the\r\nKing would say something farther, and offer him the opportunity of a\r\nsmall revenge. 'Your Ballets are beautiful,' said the King to him; 'your\r\nDancing Girls have grace; but it is grace in a squattish form (DE LA\r\nGRACE ENGONCEE). I think you make them raise their shoulders and their\r\narms too much. For, Monsieur Noverre, if you remember, our principal\r\nDancing Girl at Berlin wasn't so.' 'That is why she was at Berlin,\r\nSire,' replied Noverre [satirically, all he could].\r\n\r\n\"I was every day asked to sup with the King; too often the conversation\r\naddressed itself to me. In spite of my attachment to the Kaiser, whose\r\nGeneral I like to be, but not whose D'Argens or Algarotti, I had not\r\nbeyond reason abandoned myself to that feeling. When urged by the King's\r\noften speaking to me, I had to answer, and go on talking. Besides, the\r\nKaiser took a main share in the conversation; and was perhaps more at\r\nhis ease with the King than the King with him. One day, they got talking\r\nof what one would wish to be in this world; and they asked my opinion. I\r\nsaid, I should like to be 'a Pretty Woman till thirty; then, till sixty,\r\na fortunate and skilful General;'--and not knowing what more to say, but\r\nfor the sake of adding something, whatever it might be, 'a Cardinal till\r\neighty.' The King, who likes to banter the Sacred College, made himself\r\nmerry on this; and the Kaiser gave him a cheap bargain of Rome and its\r\nupholders (SUPPOTS). That supper was one of the gayest and pleasantest\r\nI have ever seen. The Two Sovereigns were without pretension and without\r\nreserve; what did not always happen on other days; and the amiability of\r\ntwo men so superior, and often so astonished to see themselves together,\r\nwas the agreeablest thing you can imagine. The King bade me come and\r\nsee him the first time he and I should have three or four hours to\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\n\"A storm such as there never was, a deluge compared with which that of\r\nDeucalion was a summer shower, covered our Hills with water [cannot say\r\nWHICH day of the four], and almost drowned our Army while attempting\r\nto manoeuvre. The morrow was a rest-day for that reason. At nine in the\r\nmorning, I went to the King, and stayed till one. He spoke to me of\r\nour Generals; I let him say, of his own accord, the things I think of\r\nMarshals Lacy and Loudon; and I hinted that, as to the others, it was\r\nbetter to speak of the dead than of the living; and that one never can\r\nwell judge of a General who has not in his lifetime actually played\r\nhigh parts in War. He spoke to me of Feldmarschall Daun: I said, 'that\r\nagainst the French I believed he might have proved a great man; but that\r\nagainst him [you], he had never quite been all he was; seeing always\r\nhis opponent as a Jupiter, thunder-bolt in hand, ready to pulverize his\r\nArmy.' That appeared to give the King pleasure: he signified to me a\r\nfeeling of esteem for Daun; he spoke favorably of General Brentano [one\r\nof the Maxen gentlemen]. I asked his reason for the praises I knew he\r\nhad given to General Beck. 'Why (MAIS), I thought him a man of\r\nmerit,' said the King. 'I do not think so, Sire; he didn't do you much\r\nmischief.' 'He sometimes took Magazines from me.' 'And sometimes let\r\nyour Generals escape.' (Bevern at REICHENBACH, for instance, do you\r\nreckon that his blame?)--'I have never beaten him,' said the King. 'He\r\nnever came near enough for that: and I always thought your Majesty\r\nwas only appearing to respect him, in order that we might have more\r\nconfidence in him, and that you might give him the better slap some day,\r\nwith interest for all arrears.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'Do you know who taught me the little I know? It was your old\r\nMarshal Traun: that was a man, that one.--You spoke of the French: do\r\nthey make progress?'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'They are capable of everything in time of war, Sire: but in\r\nPeace,--their chiefs want them to be what they are not, what they are\r\nnot capable of being.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'How, then; disciplined? They were so in the time of M. de\r\nTurenne.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'Oh, it isn't that. They were not so in the time of M. de Vendome,\r\nand they went on gaining battles. But it is now wished that they become\r\nyour Apes and ours; and that does n't suit them.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'Perhaps so: I have said of their busy people (FAISEURS,' St.\r\nGermains and Army-Reformers), 'that they would fain sing without knowing\r\nmusic.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'Oh, that is true! But leave them their natural notes; profit\r\nby their bravery, their alertness (LEGERETE), by their very faults,--I\r\nbelieve their confusion might confuse their enemies sometimes.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'Well, yes, doubtless, if you have something to support them\r\nwith.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'Just so, Sire,--some Swiss and Germans.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"''T is a brave and amiable nation, the French; one can't help\r\nloving them:--but, MON DIEU, what have they made of their Men of\r\nLetters; and what a tone has now come up among them! Voltaire, for\r\nexample, had an excellent tone. D'Alembert, whom I esteem in many\r\nrespects, is too noisy, and insists too much on producing effect in\r\nsociety:--was it the Men of Letters that gave the Court of Louis XIV.\r\nits grace, or did they themselves acquire it from the many amiable\r\npersons they found there? He was the Patriarch of Kings, that one [in\r\na certain sense, your Majesty!]. In his lifetime a little too much good\r\nwas said of him; but a great deal too much ill after his death.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'A King of France, Sire, is always the Patriarch of Clever People\r\n(PATRIARCHE DES GENS D'ESPRIT:' You do not much mean this, Monsieur? You\r\nmerely grin it from the teeth outward?)\r\n\r\nKING. \"'That is the bad Number to draw: they are n't worth a doit (NE\r\nVALENT PAS LE DIABLE, these GENS D'ESPRIT) at Governing. Better be\r\nPatriarch of the Greek Church, like my sister the Empress of Russia!\r\nThat brings her, and will bring, advantages. There's a religion for\r\nyou; comprehending many Countries and different Nations! As to our\r\npoor Lutherans, they are so few, it is not worth while being their\r\nPatriarch.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'Nevertheless, Sire, if one join to them the Calvinists, and\r\nall the little bastard Sects, it would not be so bad a post. [The King\r\nappeared to kindle at this; his eyes were full of animation. But it did\r\nnot last when I said:] If the Kaiser were Patriarch of the Catholics,\r\nthat too wouldn't be a bad place.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'There, there: Europe divided into Three Patriarchates. I was\r\nwrong to begin; you see where that leads us: Messieurs, our dreams are\r\nnot those of the just, as M. le Regent used to say. If Louis XIV. were\r\nalive, he would thank us.'\r\n\r\n\"All these patriarchal ideas, possible and impossible to realize, made\r\nhim, for an instant, look thoughtful, almost moody.\r\n\r\nKING. \"'Louis XIV., possessing more judgment than cleverness (ESPRIT),\r\nlooked out more for the former quality than for the latter. It was\r\nmen of genius that he wanted, and found. It could not be said that\r\nCorneille, Bossuet, Racine and Conde were people of the clever sort (DES\r\nHOMMES D'ESPRIT).'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'On the whole, there is that in the Country which really deserves\r\nto be happy, It is asserted that your Majesty has said, If one would\r\nhave a fine dream, one must--'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'Yes, it is true,--be King of France.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'If Francis I. and Henri IV. had come into the world after your\r\nMajesty, they would have said, \"be King of Prussia.\"'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'Tell me, pray, is there no citable Writer left in France?'\r\n\r\n\"This made me laugh; the King asked the reason. I told him, He reminded\r\nme of the RUSSE A PARIS, that charming little piece of verse of M. de\r\nVoltaire's; and we remembered charming things out of it, which made us\r\nboth laugh. He said,\r\n\r\nKING. \"'I have sometimes heard the Prince de Conti spoken of: what sort\r\nof man is he?'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'He is a man composed of twenty or thirty men. He is proud, he is\r\naffable,'\"--he is fiddle, he is diddle (in the seesaw epigrammatic way,\r\nfor a page or more); and is not worth pen and ink from us, since the\r\ntime old Marshal Traun got us rid of him,--home across the Rhine, full\r\nspeed, with Croats sticking on his skirts. [Supra, viii. 475.]\r\n\r\n\"This portrait seemed to amuse the King. One had to captivate him by\r\nsome piquant detail; without that, he would escape you, give you no time\r\nto speak. The success generally began by the first words, no matter how\r\nvague, of any conversation; these he found means to make interesting;\r\nand what, generally, is mere talk about the weather became at once\r\nsublime; and one never heard anything vulgar from him. He ennobled\r\neverything; and the examples of Greeks and Romans, or of modern\r\nGenerals, soon dissipated everything of what, with others, would have\r\nremained trivial and commonplace.\r\n\r\n\"'Have you ever,' said he, 'seen such a rain as yesterday's? Your\r\northodox Catholics will say, \"That comes of having a man without\r\nreligion among us: what are we to do with this cursed (MAUDIT) King; a\r\nProtestant at lowest?\" for I really think I brought you bad luck. Your\r\nsoldiers would be saying, \"Peace we have; and still is this devil of a\r\nman to trouble us!\"'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'Certainly, if your Majesty was the cause, it is very bad. Such\r\na thing is only permitted to Jupiter, who has always good reasons for\r\neverything; and it would have been in his fashion, after destroying the\r\none set by fire, to set about destroying the others by water. However,\r\nthe fire is at an end; and I did not expect to revert to it.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'I ask your pardon for having plagued you so often with that; I\r\nregret it for the sake of all mankind. But what a fine Apprenticeship\r\nof War! I have committed errors enough to teach you young people, all of\r\nyou, to do better. MON DIEU, how I love your grenadiers! How well they\r\ndefiled in my presence! If the god Mars were raising a body-guard for\r\nhimself, I should advise him to take them hand over head. Do you know\r\nI was well pleased (BIEN CONTENT) with the Kaiser last night at supper?\r\nDid you hear what he said to me about Liberty of the Press, and the\r\nTroubling of Consciences (LA GENE DES CONSCIENCES)? There will be bits\r\nof difference between his worthy Ancestors and him, on some points!'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'I am persuaded, he will entertain no prejudices on anything; and\r\nthat your Majesty will be a great Book of Instruction to him.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'How adroitly he disapproved, without appearing to mean anything,\r\nthe ridiculous Vienna Censorship; and the too great fondness of\r\nhis Mother (without naming her) for certain things which only make\r\nhypocrites. By the by, she must detest you, that High Lady?'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'Well, then, not at all. She has sometimes lectured me about my\r\nstrayings, but very maternally: she is sorry for me, and quite sure\r\nthat I shall return to the right path. She said to me, some time ago,\r\n\"I don't know how you do, you are the intimate friend of Father Griffet;\r\nthe Bishop of Neustadt has always spoken well of you; likewise the\r\nArchbishop of Malines; and the Cardinal [name Sinzendorf, or else not\r\nknown to me, dignity and red hat sufficiently visible] loves you much.\"'\r\n\r\n\"Why cannot I remember the hundred luminous things which escaped the\r\nKing in this conversation! It lasted till the trumpet at Head-quarters\r\nannounced dinner. The King went to take his place; and I think it was on\r\nthis occasion that, some one having asked why M. de Loudon had not come\r\nyet, he said, 'That is not his custom: formerly he often arrived before\r\nme. Please let him take this place next me; I would rather have him at\r\nmy side than opposite.'\"\r\n\r\nThat is very pretty. And a better authority gives it, The King said to\r\nLoudon himself, on Loudon's entering, _\"Mettez-vous aupres de moi, M.\r\nde Loudon; j'aime mieux vous avoir a cote de moi que vis-a-vis.\"_ He was\r\nvery kind to Loudon; \"constantly called him M. LE FELDMARECHAL [delicate\r\nhint of what should have been, but WAS not for seven years yet]; and,\r\nat parting, gave him [as he did to Lacy also] two superb horses,\r\nmagnificently equipped.\" [Pezzl, _Vie de Loudon,_ ii. 29.]\r\n\r\n\"Another day,\" continues Prince de Ligne, \"the Manoeuvres being over\r\nin good time, there was a Concert at the Kaiser's. Notwithstanding the\r\nKing's taste for music, he was pleased to give me the preference; and\r\ncame where I was, to enchant me with the magic of his conversation, and\r\nthe brilliant traits, gay and bold, which characterize him. He asked\r\nme to name the general and particular Officers who were present, and\r\nto tell him those who had served under Marshal Traun: 'For, ENFIN,' he\r\nsaid, 'as I think I have told you already, he is my Master; he corrected\r\nme in the Schooling I was at.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'Your Majesty was very ungrateful, then; you never paid him\r\nhis lessons. If it was as your Majesty says, you should at least have\r\nallowed him to beat you; and I do not remember that you ever did.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'I did not get beaten, because I did not fight.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'It is in this manner that the greatest Generals have often\r\nconducted their wars against each other. One has only to look at the two\r\nCampaigns of M. de Montecuculi and M. de Turenne, in the Valley of\r\nthe Rench [Strasburg Country, 1674 and 1675, two celebrated Campaigns,\r\nTurenne killed by a cannon-shot in the last].\r\n\r\nKING. \"'Between Traun and the former there is not much difference; but\r\nwhat a difference, BON DIEU, between the latter and me!'\r\n\r\n\"I named to him the Count d'Althan, who had been Adjutant-General, and\r\nthe Count de Pellegrini. He asked me twice which was which, from the\r\ndistance we were at; and said, He was so short-sighted, I must excuse\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'Nevertheless, Sire, in the war your sight was good enough; and,\r\nif I remember right, it reached very far!'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'It was not I; it was my glass.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'Ha, I should have liked to find that glass;--but, I fear it would\r\nhave suited my eyes as little as Scanderbeg's sword my arm.'\r\n\r\n\"I forget how the conversation changed; but I know it grew so free that,\r\nseeing somebody coming to join in it, the King warned him to take care;\r\nthat it was n't safe to converse with a man doomed by the theologians\r\nto Everlasting Fire. I felt as if he somewhat overdid this of his\r\n'being doomed,' and that he boasted too much of it. Not to hint at\r\nthe dishonesty of these free-thinking gentlemen (MESSIEURS LES ESPRITS\r\nFORTS), who very often are thoroughly afraid of the Devil, it is, at\r\nleast, bad taste to make display of such things: and it was with the\r\npeople of bad taste whom he has had about him, such as a Jordan, a\r\nD'Argens, Maupertuis, La Beaumelle, La Mettrie, Abbe de Prades, and\r\nsome dull sceptics of his own Academy, that he had acquired the habit of\r\nmocking at Religion; and of talking (DE PARLER) Dogma, Spinoism, Court\r\nof Rome and the like. In the end, I did n't always answer when he\r\ntouched upon it. I now seized a moment's interval, while he was using\r\nhis handkerchief, to speak to him about some business, in connection\r\nwith the Circle of Westphalia, and a little COMTE IMMEDIAT [County\r\nholding direct, of the Reich] which I have there. The King answered me:\r\n'I, for my part, will do anything you wish; but what thinks the other\r\nDirector, my comrade, the Elector of Cologne, about it?'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'I was not aware, Sire, that you were an Ecclesiastical Elector.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'I am so; at least on my Protestant account.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'That is not to OUR account's advantage! Those good people of mine\r\nbelieve your Majesty to be their protector.'\r\n\r\n\"He continued asking me the names of persons he saw. I was telling him\r\nthose of a number of young Princes who had lately entered the Service,\r\nand some of whom gave hopes. 'That may be,' said he; 'but I think the\r\nbreed of the governing races ought to be crossed. I like the children of\r\nlove: look at the Marechal de Saxe, and my own Anhalt [severe Adjutant\r\nvon Anhalt, a bastard of Prinz Gustav, the Old Dessauer's Heir-Apparent,\r\nwho begot a good many bastards, but died before inheriting: bastards\r\nwere brought up, all of them to soldiering, by their Uncles,---this one\r\nby Uncle Moritz; was thrown from his horse eight years HENCE, to the\r\ngreat joy of many]; though I am afraid that SINCE [mark this SINCE,\r\nalas!] his fall on his head, that latter is not so good as formerly.\r\nI should be grieved at it, [Not for eight years yet, MON PRINCE, I am\r\nsorry to say! Adjutant von Anhalt did, in reality, get this fall,\r\nand damaging hurt on the head, in the \"Bavarian War\" (nicknamed\r\nKARTOFFEL-KRIEG, \"Potato-War\"), 1778-1779. _Militair-Lexikon,_ i. 69:\r\nsee Preuss, ii. 356, iv. 578; &c.] both for his sake and for mine; he is\r\na man full of talents.'\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to remember this; for I have heard it said by silly\r\nslanderous people (SOTS DENIGRANTS), who accuse the King of Prussia of\r\ninsensibility, that he was not touched by the accident which happened to\r\nthe man he seemed to love most. Too happy if one had only said that\r\nof him! He was supposed to be jealous of the merit of Schwerin and of\r\nKeith, and delighted to have got them killed. It is thus that mediocre\r\npeople seek to lower great men, to diminish the immense space that lies\r\nbetween themselves and such.\r\n\r\n\"Out of politeness, the King, and his Suite as well, had put on white\r\n[Austrian] Uniforms, not to bring back on us that blue which we had so\r\noften seen in war. He looked as though he belonged to our Army and to\r\nthe Kaiser's suite. There was, in this Visit, I believe, on both\r\nsides, a little personality, some distrust, and perhaps a beginning\r\nof bitterness;--as always happens, says Philippe de Comines, when\r\nSovereigns meet. The King took Spanish snuff, and brushing it off with\r\nhis hand from his coat as well as he could, he said, 'I am not clean\r\nenough for you, Messieurs; I am not worthy to wear your colors.' The\r\nair with which he said this, made me think he would yet soil them with\r\npowder, if the opportunity arose.\r\n\r\n\"I forgot a little Incident which gave me an opportunity of setting off\r\n(FAIRE VALOIR) the two Monarchs to each other [Incident about the King's\r\nhigh opinion of the Kaiser's drill-sergeantry in this day's manoeuvres,\r\nand how I was the happy cause of the Kaiser's hearing it himself:\r\nIncident omissible; as the whole Sequel is, except a sentence or two].--\r\n\r\n... \"On this Neustadt occasion, the King was sometimes too ceremonious;\r\nwhich annoyed the Kaiser. For instance,--I know not whether meaning\r\nto show himself a disciplined Elector of the Reich, but so it\r\nwas,--whenever the Kaiser put his foot in stirrup, the King was sure to\r\ntake his Majesty's horse by the bridle, stand respectfully waiting the\r\nKaiser's right foot, and fit it into ITS stirrup: and so with everything\r\nelse. The Kaiser had the more sincere appearance, in testifying his\r\ngreat respect; like that of a young Prince to an aged King, and of a\r\nyoung Soldier to the greatest of Captains....\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes there were appearances of cordiality between the two\r\nSovereigns. One saw that Friedrich II. loved Joseph II., but that the\r\npreponderance of the Empire, and the contact of Bohemia and Silesia, a\r\ngood deal barred the sentiments of King and Kaiser. You remember, Sire\r\n[Ex-Sire of Poland], their LETTERS [readers shall see them, in\r\n1778,--or rather REFUSE to see them!'] on the subject of Bavaria; their\r\ncompliments, the explanations they had with regard to their intentions;\r\nall carried on with such politeness; and that from politeness to\r\npoliteness, the King ended by invading Bohemia.\"\r\n\r\nWell, here is legible record, with something really of portraiture in\r\nit, valuable so far as it goes; record unique on this subject;--and\r\nsubstantially true, though inexact enough in details. Thus, even in\r\nregard to that of Anhalt's HEAD, which is so impossible in this First\r\nDialogue, Friedrich did most probably say something of the kind, in a\r\nSecond which there is, of date 1780; of which latter De Ligne is here\r\ngiving account as well,--though we have to postpone it till its time\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nAt this Neustadt Interview there did something of Political occur;\r\nand readers ought to be shown exactly what. Kaunitz had come with the\r\nKaiser; and this something was intended as the real business among\r\nthe gayeties and galas at Neustadt. Poland, or its Farce-Tragedy now\r\nplaying, was not once mentioned that I hear of; though perhaps, as\r\nFLEBILE LUDIBRIUM, it might turn up for moments in dinner-conversation\r\nor the like: but the astonishing Russian-Turk War, which has sprung out\r\nof Poland, and has already filled Stamboul and its Divans and Muftis\r\nwith mere horror and amazement; and, in fact, has brought the Grand Turk\r\nto the giddy rim of the Abyss; nothing but ruin and destruction visible\r\nto him: this, beyond all other things whatever, is occupying these high\r\nheads at present;--and indeed the two latest bits of Russian-Turk news\r\nhave been of such a blazing character as to occupy all the world more\r\nor less. Readers, some glances into the Turk War, I grieve to say, are\r\nbecome inevitable to us!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUSSIAN-TURK WAR, FIRST TWO CAMPAIGNS.\r\n\r\n\"OCTOBER 6th, 1768, Turks declare War; Russian Ambassador thrown into\r\nthe Seven Towers as a preliminary, where he sat till Peace came to\r\nbe needed. MARCH 23d, 1769, Display their Banner of Mahomet, all in\r\nparoxysm of Fanaticism risen to the burning point: 'Under pain of death,\r\nNo Giaour of you appear on the streets, nor even look out, of window,\r\nthis day!' Austrian Ambassador's Wife, a beautiful gossamer creature,\r\nventuring to transgress on that point, was torn from her carriage by the\r\nPopulace, and with difficulty saved from destruction: Brother of the\r\nSun and Moon, apologizing afterwards down to the very shoe-tie, is\r\nforgiven.\"\r\n\r\nFIRST CAMPAIGN; 1769. \"APRIL 26th-30th, Galitzin VERSUS Choczim;\r\ncan't, having no provender or powder. Falls back over Dniester\r\nagain,--overhears that extraordinary DREAM, as above recited,\r\nbetokening great rumor in Russian Society against such Purblind\r\nCommanders-in-Chief. Purblind VERSUS Blind is fine play, nevertheless;\r\nwait, only wait:--\r\n\r\n\"JULY 2d, Galitzin slowly gets on the advance again: 150,000 Turks,\r\nstill slower, are at last across the Donau (sharp enough French\r\nOfficers among them, agents of Choiseul; but a mass incurably\r\nchaotic);--furiously intending towards Poland and extermination of the\r\nGiaour. Do not reach Dniester River till September, and look across\r\non Poland,--for the first time, and also for the last, in this War.\r\nSEPTEMBER 17th: Weather has been rainy; Dniester, were Galitzin\r\nnothing, is very difficult for Turks; who try in two places, but cannot.\r\n[Hermann, v. 611-613.] In a third place (name not given, perhaps has\r\nno name), about 12,000 of them are across; when Dniester, raging into\r\nflood, carries away their one Bridge, and leaves the 12,000 isolated\r\nthere. Purblind Galitzin, on express order, does attack these 12,000\r\n(night of September 17th-18th):--'Hurrah' of the devouring Russians\r\nabout midnight, hoarse shriek of the doomed 12,000, wail of their\r\nbrethren on the southern shore, who cannot, help:--night of horrors\r\n'from midnight till 2 A.M.;' and the 12,000 massacred or captive, every\r\nman of them; Russian loss 600 killed and wounded. Whereupon the Turk\r\nArmy bursts into unanimous insanity; and flows home in deliquium of\r\nruin. Choczim is got on the terms already mentioned (15 sick men and\r\nwomen lying in it, and 184 bronze cannon, when we boat across); Turk\r\nArmy can by no effort be brought to halt anywhere; flows across the\r\nDonau, disappears into Chaos:--and the whole of Moldavia is conquered\r\nin this cheap manner. What, perhaps is still better, Galitzin (28th\r\nSeptember) is thrown out; Romanzow, hitherto Commander of a second\r\nsmaller Army, kind of covering wing to Galitzin, is Chief for Second\r\nCampaign.\r\n\r\n\"In the Humber, this Winter, to the surprise of incredulous mankind,\r\na Russian Fleet drops anchor for a few days: actual Russian Fleet\r\nintending for the Greek waters, for Montenegro and intermediate errands,\r\nto conclude with 'Liberation of Greece next Spring,'--so grandiose is\r\nthis Czarina.\" [Hermann, v. 617.]\r\n\r\nSECOND CAMPAIGN; 1770. \"This is the flower of Anti-Turk\r\nCampaigns,--victorious, to a blazing pitch, both by land and sea.\r\nRomanzow, master of Moldavia, goes upon Wallachia, and the new or\r\nrehabilitated Turk Army; and has an almost gratis bargain of both.\r\nRomanzow has some good Officers under him ('Brigadier Stoffeln,' much\r\nmore 'General Tottlenen,' 'General Bauer,' once Colonel Bauer of the\r\nWesel Free-Corps,--many of the Superior Officers seem to be German,\r\nothers have Swedish or Danish names);--better Officers; and knows better\r\nhow to use them than Galitzin did. August 1st, Romanzow has a Battle,\r\ncalled of Kaghul, in Pruth Country. That is his one 'Battle' this\r\nSummer; and brings him Ismail, Akkerman, all Wallachey, and no Turks\r\nleft in those parts. But first let us attend to sea-matters, and the\r\nLiberation of Greece, which precede in time and importance.\r\n\r\n\"'Liberation of Greece:' an actual Fleet, steering from Cronstadt to\r\nthe Dardanelles to liberate Greece! The sound of it kindles all the warm\r\nheads in Europe; especially Voltaire's, which, though covered with the\r\nsnow of age, is still warm internally on such points. As to liberating\r\nGreece, Voltaire's hopes were utterly balked; but the Fleet from\r\nCronstadt did amazing service otherwise in those waters. FEBRUARY 28th,\r\n1770, first squadron of the Russian Fleet anchors at Passawa,--not far\r\nfrom Calamata, in the Gulf of Coron, on the antique Peloponnesian coast;\r\nSparta on your right hand, Arcadia on your left, and so many excellent\r\nGhosts (GREEK TEXT) of Heroes looking on:--Russian squadron has four big\r\nships, three frigates, more soon to follow: on board there are arms and\r\nmunitions of war; but unhappily only 500 soldiers. Admiral-in-Chief (not\r\nyet come up) is Alexei Orlof, a brother of Lover Gregory's, an extremely\r\nworthless seaman and man. Has under him 'many Danes, a good few English\r\ntoo,'--especially Three English Officers, whom we shall hear of, when\r\nAlexei and they come up. Meanwhile, on the Peloponnesian coast are\r\nmodern Spartans, to the number of 15,000, all sitting ready,\r\nexpecting the Russian advent: these rose duly; got Russian muskets,\r\ncartridges,--only two Russian Officers:--and attacked the Turks\r\nwith considerable fury or voracity, but with no success of the least\r\nsolidity. Were foiled here, driven out there; in fine, were utterly\r\nbeaten, Russians and they: lost Tripolizza, by surprise; whereupon\r\n(April 19th) the Russians withdrew to their Fleet; and the Affair\r\nof Greece was at an end. [Hermann, v. 621.] It had lasted (28th\r\nFebruary-19th April) seven weeks and a day. The Russians retired to\r\ntheir Fleet, with little loss; and rode at their ease again, in Navarino\r\nBay. But the 15,000 modern Spartans had nothing to retire to,--these had\r\nto retire into extinction, expulsion and the throat of Moslem vengeance,\r\nwhich was frightfully bloody and inexorable on them.\r\n\r\n\"Greece having failed, the Russian Fleet, now in complete tale, made for\r\nTurkey, for Constantinople itself. 'Into the very Dardanelles' they say\r\nthey will go; an Englishman among them--Captain Elphinstone, a dashing\r\nseaman, if perhaps rather noisy, whom Rulhiere is not blind to--has been\r\nheard to declare, at least in his cups: 'Dardanelles impossible? Pshaw,\r\nI will do it, as easily as drink this glass of wine!' Alexei Orlof is a\r\nSham-Admiral; but under him are real Sea-Officers, one or two.\r\n\r\n\"In the Turkish Fleet, it seems, there is an Ex-Algerine, Hassan Bey,\r\nof some capacity in sea-matters; but he is not in chief command, only\r\nin second; and can accomplish nothing. The Turkish Fleet, numerous but\r\nrotten, retires daily,--through the famed Cyclades, and Isles of Greece,\r\nParos, Naxos, apocalyptic Patmos, on to Scio (old Chios of the wines);\r\nand on July 5th takes refuge behind Scio, between Scio and the Coast\r\nof Smyrna, in Tchesme Bay. 'Safe here!' thinks the chief Turk Admiral.\r\n'Very far from safe!' remonstrates Hassan; though to no purpose. And\r\nprivately puts the question to himself, 'Have these Giaours a real\r\nAdmiral among them, or, like us, only a sham one?'\"\r\n\r\nTCHESME BAY, 7th JULY, 1770. \"Nothing can be more imaginary than Alexei\r\nOrlof as an Admiral: but he has a Captain Elphinstone, a Captain Gregg,\r\na Lieutenant Dugdale; and these determine to burn poor Hassan and his\r\nwhole Fleet in Tchesme here:--and do it totally, night of July 7th; with\r\none single fireship; Dugdale steering it; Gregg behind him, to support\r\nwith broadsides; Elphinstone ruling and contriving, still farther to\r\nrear; helpless Turk Fleet able to make no debate whatever. Such a blaze\r\nof conflagration on the helpless Turks as shone over all the world--one\r\nof Rulhiere's finest fire-works, with little shot;--the light of which\r\nwas still dazzling mankind while the Interview at Neustadt took place.\r\nTurk Fleet, fifteen ships, nine frigates and above 8,000 men, gone to\r\ngases and to black cinders,--Hassan hardly escaping with I forget how\r\nmany score of wounds and bruises. [Hermann, v. 623.]\r\n\r\n\"'Now for the Dardanelles,' said Elphinstone: (bombard Constantinople,\r\nstarve it,--to death, or to what terms you will!' 'Cannot be done; too\r\ndangerous; impossible!' answered the sham Admiral, quite in a tremor,\r\nthey say;--which at length filled the measure of Elphinstone's disgusts\r\nwith such a Fleet and Admiral. Indignant Elphinstone withdrew to his\r\nown ship, 'Adieu, Sham-Admiral!'--sailed with his own ship, through the\r\nimpossible Dardanelles (Turk batteries firing one huge block of granite\r\nat him, which missed; then needing about forty minutes to load\r\nagain); feat as easy to Elphinstone as this glass of wine. In sight of\r\nConstantinople, Elphinstone, furthermore, called for his tea; took his\r\ntea on deck, under flourishing of all his drums and all his trumpets:\r\ntea done, sailed out again scathless; instantly threw up his\r\ncommand,--and at Petersburg, soon after, in taking leave of the Czarina,\r\nsignified to her, in language perhaps too plain, or perhaps only too\r\npainfully true, some Naval facts which were not welcome in that high\r\nquarter.\" [Rulhiere, iii. 476-509.] This remarkable Elphinstone I take\r\nto be some junior or irregular Balmerino scion; but could never much\r\nhear of him except in RULHIERE, where, on vague, somewhat theatrical\r\nterms, he figures as above.\r\n\r\n\"AUGUST 1st, Romanzow has a 'Battle of Kaghul,' so they call it;\r\nthough it is a 'Slaughtery' or SCHLACHTEREI, rather than a 'Slaught' or\r\nSCHLACHT, say my German friends. Kaghul is not a specific place, but a\r\nlongish river, a branch of the Pruth; under screen of which the Grand\r\nTurk Army, 100,000 strong, with 100,000 Tartars as second line, has\r\nfinally taken position, and fortified itself with earthworks and\r\nabundant cannon. AUGUST 1st, 1770, Romanzow, after study and advising,\r\nfeels prepared for this Grand Army and its earthworks: with a select\r\n20,000, under select captains, Romanzow, after nightfall, bursts in\r\nupon it, simultaneously on three different points; and gains, gratis or\r\nnearly so, such a victory as was never heard of before. The Turks, on\r\ntheir earthworks, had 140 cannons; these the Turk gunners fired off two\r\ntimes, and fled, leaving them for Romanzow's uses. The Turk cavalry then\r\ntried if they could not make some attempt at charging; found they could\r\nnot; whirled back upon their infantry; set it also whirling: and in\r\na word, the whole 200,000 whirled, without blow struck; and it was a\r\nuniversal panic rout, and delirious stampede of flight, which never\r\npaused (the very garrisons emptying themselves, and joining in it) till\r\nit got across the Donau again, and drew breath there, not to rally or\r\nstand, but to run rather slower. And had left Wallachia, Bessarabia,\r\nDniester river, Donau river, swept clear of Turks; all Romanzow's\r\nhenceforth. To such astonishment of an invincible Grand Turk, and of his\r\nMoslem Populations, fallen on such a set of Giaours [\"ALLAH KERIM, And\r\ncannot we abolish them, then?\" Not we THEM, it would appear!],--as every\r\nreader can imagine.\" Which shall suffice every reader here in regard\r\nto the Turk War, and what concern he has in the extremely brutish\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nTchesme fell out July 7th; Elphinstone has hardly done his tea in the\r\nDardanelles, when (August 1st) this of Kaghul follows: both would be\r\nfresh news blazing in every head while the Dialogues between Friedrich\r\nand Kaunitz were going on. For they \"had many dialogues,\" Friedrich\r\nsays; \"and one of the days\" (probably September 6th) was mainly devoted\r\nto Politics, to deep private Colloquy with Kaunitz. Of which, and of the\r\ngreat things that followed out of it, I will now give, from Friedrich's\r\nown hand, the one entirely credible account I have anywhere met with in\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nFriedrich's account of Kaunitz himself is altogether life-like: a\r\nsolemn, arrogant, mouthing, browbeating kind of man,--embarrassed at\r\npresent by the necessity not to browbeat, and by the consciousness that\r\n\"King Friedrich is the only man who refuses to acknowledge my claims to\r\ndistinction:\" [Rulhiere (somewhere) has heard this, as an utterance\r\nof Kaunitz's in some plaintive moment.]--a Kaunitz whose arrogances,\r\nqualities and claims this King is not here to notice, except as they\r\nconcern business on hand. He says, \"Kaunitz had a clear intellect,\r\ngreatly twisted by perversities of temper (UN SENS DROIT, L'ESPRIT\r\nREMPLI DE TRAVERS), especially by a self-conceit and arrogance\r\nwhich were boundless. He did not talk, but preach. At the smallest\r\ninterruption, he would stop short in indignant surprise: it has happened\r\nthat, at the Council-Board in Schonbrunn, when Imperial Majesty herself\r\nasked some explanation of a word or thing not understood by her, Kaunitz\r\nmade his bow (LUI TIRA SA REVERENCE), and quitted the room.\" Good to\r\nknow the nature of the beast. Listen to him, then, on those terms, since\r\nit is necessary. The Kaunitz Sermon was of great length, imbedded in\r\ncircumlocutions, innuendoes and diplomatic cautions; but the gist of\r\nit we gather to have been (abridged into dialogue form) essentially as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nKAUNITZ. \"Dangerous to the repose of Europe, those Russian encroachments\r\non the Turk. Never will Imperial Majesty consent that Russia possess\r\nMoldavia or Wallachia; War sooner,--all things sooner! These views of\r\nRussia are infinitely dangerous to everybody. To your Majesty as well,\r\nif I may say so; and no remedy conceivable against them,--to me none\r\nconceivable,--but this only, That Prussia and Austria join frankly in\r\nprotest and absolute prohibition of them.\"\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH. \"I have nothing more at heart than to stand well with\r\nAustria; and always to be her ally, never her enemy. But your Highness\r\nsees how I am situated: bound by express Treaty with Czarish Majesty;\r\nmust go with Russia in any War! What can I do? I can, and will with all\r\nindustry, labor to conciliate Czarish Majesty and Imperial; to produce\r\nat Petersburg such a Peace with the Turks as may meet the wishes of\r\nVienna. Let us hope it can be done. By faithful endeavoring, on my part\r\nand on yours, I persuade myself it can. Meanwhile, steadfastly together,\r\nwe two! All our little rubs, custom-house squabbles on the Frontier,\r\nand such like, why not settle them here, and now? [and does so with\r\nhis Highness.] That there be nothing but amity, helpfulness and mutual\r\neffort towards an object so momentous to us both, and to all mankind!\"\r\n\r\nKAUNITZ. \"Good so far. And may a not intolerable Turk-Russian Peace\r\nprove possible, without our fighting for it! Meanwhile, Imperial Majesty\r\n[as she has been visibly doing for some time] must continue massing\r\ntroops and requisites on the Hungarian Frontier, lest the contrary\r\nhappen!\"\r\n\r\nThis was the result arrived at. Of which Friedrich \"judged it but polite\r\nto inform the young Kaiser; who appeared to be grateful for this mark\r\nof attention, being much held down by Kaunitz in his present state of\r\ntutelage.\" [_OEuvres de Frederic,_ xxvi. 30.]\r\n\r\nAnd by a singular chance, on the very morrow there arrived from the\r\nDivan (dated August 12th) an Express to Friedrich: \"Mediate a Peace for\r\nus with Russia; not you alone, as we have often asked, but Austria AND\r\nyou!\" For the Kaghul Slaughtery has come on us; Giaour Elphinstone\r\nhas taken tea in the Dardanelles; and we know not to what hand to\r\nturn!--\"The young Kaiser did not hide his joy at this Overture, as\r\nKaunitz did his, which was perhaps still greater:\" the Kaiser warmly\r\nexpressed his thanks to Friedrich as the Author of it; Kaunitz, with\r\na lofty indifference (MORGUE), and nose in air as over a small matter,\r\n\"merely signified his approval of this step which the Turks had taken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never was mediation undertaken with greater pleasure,\" adds the King.\r\nAnd both did proceed upon it with all zeal; but only the King as real\r\n\"mediator,\" or MIDDLEman; Kaunitz from the first planting himself\r\nimmovably upon the Turk side of things, which is likewise the Austrian;\r\nand playing in secret (as Friedrich probably expected he would) the\r\nstrangest tricks with his assumed function.\r\n\r\nSo that Friedrich had to take the burden of mediating altogether on\r\nhimself; and month after month, year after year, it is evident he\r\nprosecutes the same with all the industry and faculty that are in\r\nhim,--in intense desire, and in hope often nearly desperate, to keep his\r\ntwo neighbors' houses, and his own and the whole world along with\r\nthem, from taking fire. Apart from their conflicting interests, the two\r\nEmpresses have privately a rooted aversion to one another. What with\r\nRussian exorbitancy (a Czarina naturally uplifted with her Tchesmes and\r\nKaghuls); what with Austrian cupidity, pride, mulishness, and private\r\ntrickery of Kaunitz; the adroit and heartily zealous Friedrich never had\r\nsuch a bit of diplomacy to do. For many months hence, in spite of his\r\nintensest efforts and cunningest appliances, no way of egress visible:\r\n\"The imbroglio MUST catch fire!\" At last a way opens, \"Ha, at last\r\na way!\"--then, for above a twelvemonth longer, such a guiding of the\r\npurblind quadrupeds and obstinate Austrian mules into said way: and\r\nfor years more such an urging of them, in pig-driver fashion, along the\r\nsame, till Peace did come!--\r\n\r\nAnd here, without knowing it, we have insensibly got to the topmost\r\nsummit of our Polish Business; one small step more, and we shall be on\r\nthe brow of the precipitous inclined-plane, down which Poland and its\r\nbusiness go careering thenceforth, down, down,--and will need but few\r\nwords more from us. Actual discovery of \"a way out\" stands for next\r\nSection.\r\n\r\nFirst, however, we will notice, as prefatory, a curious occurrence\r\nin the Country of Zips, contiguous to the Hungarian Frontier. Zips, a\r\npretty enough District, of no great extent, had from time immemorial\r\nbelonged to Hungary; till, above 300 years ago, it was--by Sigismund\r\nSUPER GRAMMATICAM, a man always in want of money (whom we last saw, in\r\nflaming color, investing Friedrich's Ancestor with Brandenburg instead\r\nof payment for a debt of money)--pledged to the Crown of Poland for\r\na round sum to help in Sigismund's pressing occasions. Redemption by\r\npayment never followed; attempt at redemption there had never been,\r\nby Sigismund or any of his successors. Nay, one successor, in a Treaty\r\nstill extant, [Preuss, iv. 32 (date 1589; pawning had beep 1412).]\r\nexpressly gave up the right of redeeming: Pledge forfeited: a Zips\r\nbelonging to Polish Crown and Republic by every law.\r\n\r\nWell; Imperial Majesty, as we have transiently seen, is assembling\r\ntroops on the Hungarian Frontier, for a special purpose. Poor Poland is,\r\nby this time (1770), as we also saw, sunk in Pestilence,--pigs and dogs\r\ndevouring the dead bodies: not a loaf to be had for a hundred ducats,\r\nand the rage of Pestilence itself a mild thing to that of Hunger, not to\r\nmention other rages. So that both Austria and Prussia, in order to keep\r\nout Pestilence at least, if they cannot the other rages, have had to\r\ndraw CORDONS, or lines of troops along the Frontiers. \"The Prussian\r\ncordon,\" I am informed, \"goes from Crossen, by Frankfurt northward,\r\nto the Weichsel River and border of Warsaw Country:\" and \"is under the\r\ncommand of General Belling,\" our famous Anti-Swede Hussar of former\r\nyears. The Austrian cordon looks over upon Zips and other Starosties, on\r\nthe Hungarian Border: where, independently of Pestilence, an alarmed\r\nand indignant Empress-Queen has been and is assembling masses of troops,\r\nwith what object we know. Looking over into Zips in these circumstances,\r\nindignant Kaunitz and Imperial Majesty, especially HIS Imperial Majesty,\r\na youth always passionate for territory, say to themselves, \"Zips was\r\nours, and in a sense is!\"--and (precise date refused us, but after\r\nNeustadt, and before Winter has quite come) push troops across into\r\nZips Starosty: seize the whole Thirteen Townships of Zips, and not only\r\nthese, but by degrees tract after tract of the adjacencies: \"Must have\r\na Frontier to our mind in those parts: indefensible otherwise!\" And\r\nquietly set up boundary-pillars, with the Austrian double-eagle stamped\r\non them, and intimation to Zips and neighborhood, That it is now become\r\nAustrian, and shall have no part farther in these Polish Confederatings,\r\nPestilences, rages of men, and pigs devouring dead bodies, but shall\r\nlive quiet under the double-eagle as others do. Which to Zips, for the\r\nmoment, might be a blessed change, welcome or otherwise; but which awoke\r\nconsiderable amazement in the outer world,--very considerable in King\r\nStanislaus (to whom, on applying, Kaunitz would give no explanation the\r\nleast articulate);--and awoke, in the Russian Court especially, a rather\r\nintense surprise and provocation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCE HENRI HAS BEEN TO SWEDEN; IS SEEN AT PETERSBURG IN MASQUERADE (on\r\nor about New-year's Day, 1771); AND DOES GET HOME, WITH RESULTS THAT ARE\r\nIMPORTANT.\r\n\r\nPrince Henri, as we noticed, was not of this Second King-and-Kaiser\r\nInterview; Henri had gone in the opposite direction,--to Sweden, on a\r\nvisit to his Sister Ulrique,--off for West and North, just in the same\r\ndays while the King was leaving Potsdam for Silesia and his other errand\r\nin the Southeast parts. Henri got to Drottingholm, his Sister's country\r\nPalace near Stockholm, by the \"end of August;\" and was there with Queen\r\nUlrique and Husband during these Neustadt manoeuvres. A changed Queen\r\nUlrique, since he last saw her \"beautiful as Love,\" whirling off in the\r\ndead of night for those remote Countries and destinies. [Supra, viii.\r\n309.] She is now fifty, or on the edge of it, her old man sixty,--old\r\nman dies within few months. They have had many chagrins, especially she,\r\nas the prouder, has had, from their contumacious People,--contumacious\r\nSenators at least (strong always both in POCKET-MONEY French or Russian,\r\nand in tendency to insolence and folly),--who once, I remember, demanded\r\nsight and count of the Crown-Jewels from Queen Ulrique: \"There, VOILA,\r\nthere are they!\" said the proud Queen; \"view them, count them,--lock\r\nthem up: never more will I wear one of them!\" But she has pretty Sons\r\ngrown to manhood, one pretty Daughter, a patient good old Husband; and\r\nTime, in Sweden too, brings its roses; and life is life, in spite of\r\ncontumacious bribed Senators and doggeries that do rather abound. Henri\r\nstayed with her six or seven weeks; leaves Sweden, middle of October,\r\n1770,--not by the straight course homewards: \"No, verily, and well knew\r\nwhy!\" shrieks the indignant Polish world on us ever since.\r\n\r\nIt is not true that Friedrich had schemed to send Henri round by\r\nPetersburg. On the contrary, it was the Czarina, on ground of old\r\nacquaintanceship, who invited him, and asked his Brother's leave to\r\ndo it. And if Poland got its fate from the circumstance, it was by\r\naccident, and by the fact that Poland's fate was drop-ripe, ready to\r\nfall by a touch.--Before going farther, here is ocular view of the\r\nshrill-minded, serious and ingenious Henri, little conscious of being so\r\nfateful a man:--PRINCE HENRI IN WHITE DOMINO. \"Prince Henri of Prussia,\"\r\nsays Richardson, the useful Eye-witness cited already, \"is one of the\r\nmost celebrated Generals of the present age. So great are his military\r\ntalents, that his Brother, who is not apt to pay compliments, says of\r\nhim,--That, in commanding an army, he was never known to commit a fault.\r\nThis, however, is but a negative kind of praise. He [the King] reserves\r\nto himself the glory of superior genius, which, though capable of\r\nbrilliant achievements, is yet liable to unwary mistakes: and allows him\r\nno other than the praise of correctness.\r\n\r\n\"To judge of Prince Henri by his appearance, I should form no high\r\nestimate of his abilities. But the Scythian Ambassadors judged in the\r\nsame manner of Alexander the Great. He is under the middle size; very\r\nthin; he walks firmly enough, or rather struts, as if he wanted to\r\nwalk firmly; and has little dignity in his air or gesture. He is\r\ndark-complexioned; and he wears his hair, which is remarkably thick,\r\nclubbed, and dressed with a high toupee. His forehead is high; his eyes\r\nlarge and blue, with a little squint; and when he smiles, his upper\r\nlip is drawn up a little in the middle. His look expresses sagacity and\r\nobservation, but nothing very amiable; and his manner is grave and\r\nstiff rather than affable. He was dressed, when I first saw him, in a\r\nlight-blue frock with silver frogs; and wore a red waistcoat and blue\r\nbreeches. He is not very popular among the Russians; and accordingly\r\ntheir wits are disposed to amuse themselves with his appearance, and\r\nparticularly with his toupee. They say he resembles Samson; that all his\r\nstrength lies in his hair; and that, conscious of this, and recollecting\r\nthe fate of the son of Manoah, he suffers not the nigh approaches of any\r\ndeceitful Delilah. They say he is like the Comet, which, about fifteen\r\nmonths ago, appeared so formidable in the Russian hemisphere; and which,\r\nexhibiting a small watery body, but a most enormous train, dismayed the\r\nNorthern and Eastern Potentates with 'fear of change.'\r\n\r\n\"I saw him a few nights ago [on or about New-year's Day, 1771; come\r\nback to us, from his Tour to Moscow, three weeks before; and nothing\r\nbut galas ever since] at a Masquerade in the Palace, said to be the most\r\nmagnificent thing of the kind ever seen at the Russian Court. Fourteen\r\nlarge rooms and galleries were opened for the accommodation of the\r\nmasks; and I was informed that there were present several thousand\r\npeople. A great part of the company wore dominos, or capuchin dresses;\r\nthough, besides these, some fanciful appearances afforded a good deal\r\nof amusement. A very tall Cossack appeared completely arrayed in the\r\n'hauberk's twisted mail.' He was indeed very grim and martial. Persons\r\nin emblematical dresses, representing Apollo and the Seasons, addressed\r\nthe Empress in speeches suited to their characters. The Empress herself,\r\nat the time I saw her Majesty, wore a Grecian habit; though I was\r\nafterwards told that she varied her dress two or three times during the\r\nmasquerade. Prince Henri of Prussia wore a white domino. Several persons\r\nappeared in the dresses of different nations,--Chinese, Turks, Persians\r\nand Armenians. The most humorous and fantastical figure was a Frenchman,\r\nwho, with wonderful nimbleness and dexterity, represented an overgrown\r\nbut very beautiful Parrot. He chattered with a great deal of spirit; and\r\nhis shoulders, covered with green feathers, performed admirably the part\r\nof wings. He drew the attention of the Empress; a ring was formed; he\r\nwas quite happy; fluttered his plumage; made fine speeches in Russ,\r\nFrench and tolerable English; the ladies were exceedingly diverted;\r\neverybody laughed except Prince Henri, who stood beside the Empress, and\r\nwas so grave and so solemn, that he would have performed his part\r\nmost admirably in the shape of an owl. The Parrot observed him; was\r\ndetermined to have revenge; and having said as many good things as he\r\ncould to her Majesty, he was hopping away; but just as he was going out\r\nof the circle, seeming to recollect himself, he stopped, looked over his\r\nshoulder at the formal Prince, and quite in the parrot tone and French\r\naccent, he addressed him most emphatically with 'HENRI! HENRI! HENRI!'\r\nand then, diving into the crowd, disappeared. His Royal Highness was\r\ndisconcerted; he was forced to smile in his own defence, and the company\r\nwere not a little amused.\r\n\r\n\"At midnight, a spacious hall, of a circular form, capable of containing\r\na vast number of people, and illuminated in the most magnificent manner,\r\nwas suddenly opened. Twelve tables were placed in alcoves around the\r\nsides of the room, where the Empress, Prince Henri, and a hundred and\r\nfifty of the chief nobility and foreign ministers sat down to supper.\r\nThe rest of the company went up, by stairs on the outside of the room,\r\ninto the lofty galleries placed all around on the inside. Such a row of\r\nmasked visages, many of them with grotesque features and bushy beards,\r\nnodding from the side of the wall, appeared very ludicrous to those\r\nbelow. The entertainment was enlivened with a concert of music: and\r\nat different intervals persons in various habits entered the hall, and\r\nexhibited Cossack, Chinese, Polish, Swedish and Tartar dances. The whole\r\nwas so gorgeous, and at the same time so fantastic, that I could not\r\nhelp thinking myself present at some of the magnificent festivals\r\ndescribed in the old-fashioned romantes:--\r\n\r\n     'The marshal'd feast\r\n     Served up in hall with sewers and seneschals.'\r\n\r\nThe rest of the company, on returning to the rooms adjoining, found\r\nprepared for them also a sumptuous banquet. The masquerade began at 6 in\r\nthe evening, and continued till 5 next morning.\r\n\r\n\"Besides the masquerade, and other festivities, in honor of, and\r\nto divert Prince Henri, we had lately a most magnificent show of\r\nfire-works. They were exhibited in a wide apace before the Winter\r\nPalace; and, in truth, 'beggared description.' They displayed, by a\r\nvariety of emblematical figures, the reduction of Moldavia, Wallachia,\r\nBessarabia, and the various conquests and victories achieved since the\r\ncommencement of the present War. The various colors, the bright\r\ngreen and the snowy white, exhibited in these fire-works, were truly\r\nastonishing. For the space of twenty minutes, a tree, adorned with the\r\nloveliest and most verdant foliage, seemed to be waving as with a gentle\r\nbreeze. It was entirely of fire; and during the whole of this stupendous\r\nscene, an arch of fire, by the continued throwing of rockets and\r\nfire-balls in one direction, formed as it were a suitable canopy.\r\n\r\n\"On this occasion a prodigious multitude of people were assembled; and\r\nthe Empress, it was surmised, seemed uneasy. She was afraid, it was\r\napprehended, lest any accident, like what happened at Paris at the\r\nmarriage of the Dauphin, should befall her beloved people. I hope I\r\nhave amused you; and ever am\"--[W. Richardson, _Anecdotes of the Russian\r\nEmpire,_ pp. 325-331: \"Petersburg, 4th January, 1771.\"]\r\n\r\nThe masquerades and galas in honor of Prince Henri, from a grandiose\r\nHostess, who had played with him in childhood, were many; but it is not\r\nwith these that we have to do. One day, the Czarina, talking to him of\r\nthe Austrian procedures at Zips, said with pique, \"It seems, in Poland\r\nyou have only to stoop, and pick up what you like of it. If the Court\r\nof Vienna have the notion to dismember that Kingdom, its neighbors will\r\nhave right to do as much.\" [Rulhiere, iv. 210; _Trois Demembremens,_\r\ni. 142; above all, Henri himself, in _OEuvres de Frederic,_ xxvi. 345,\r\n\"Petersburg, 8th January, 1771.\"] This is supposed, in all Books, to\r\nbe the PUNCTUM SALIENS, or first mention, of the astonishing Partition,\r\nwhich was settled, agreed upon, within about a year hence, and has\r\nmade so much noise ever since. And in effect it was so; the idea rising\r\npractically in that high head was the real beginning. But this was\r\nnot the first head it had been in; far from that. Above a year ago,\r\nas Friedrich himself informed us, it had been in Friedrich's own\r\nhead,--though at the time it went for absolutely nothing, nobody even\r\nbestowing a sneer on it (as Friedrich intimates), and disappeared\r\nthrough the Horn-Gate of Dreams.\r\n\r\nFriedrich himself appears to have quite forgotten the Count-Lynar idea;\r\nand, on Henri's report from Russia, was totally incredulous; and even\r\nsuspected that there might be trickery and danger in this Russian\r\nproposal. Not till Henri's return (FEBRUARY 18th, 1771) could he\r\nentirely believe that the Czarina was serious;--and then, sure enough,\r\nhe did, with his whole heart, go into it: the EUREKA out of all these\r\ndifficulties, which had so long seemed insuperable. Prince Henri \"had\r\nan Interview with the Austrian Minister next day\" (February 19th),\r\nwho immediately communicated with his Kaunitz,--and got discouraging\r\nresponse from Kaunitz; discouraging, or almost negatory; which did not\r\ndiscourage Friedrich. \"A way out,\" thinks Friedrich: \"the one way to\r\nsave my Prussia and the world from incalculable conflagration.\" And\r\nentered on it without loss of a moment. And labored at it with such\r\ncontinual industry, rapidity and faculty for guiding and pushing, as\r\nall readers have known in him, on dangerous emergencies: at no moment\r\nlifting his hand from it till it was complete.\r\n\r\nHis difficulties were enormous: what a team to drive; and on such a\r\nroad, untrodden before by hoof or wheel! Two Empresses that cordially\r\nhate one another, and that disagree on this very subject. Kaunitz and\r\nhis Empress are extremely skittish in the matter, and as if quite refuse\r\nit at first: \"Zips will be better,\" thinks Kaunitz to himself; \"Cannot\r\nwe have, all to ourselves, a beautiful little cutting out of Poland in\r\nthat part; and then perhaps, in league with the Turk, who has money,\r\nbeat the Russians home altogether, and rule Poland in their stead, or\r\n'share it with the Sultan,' as Reis-Effendi suggests?\" And the dismal\r\ntruth is, though it was not known for years afterward, Kaunitz does\r\nabout this time, in profoundest secret, actually make Treaty of Alliance\r\nwith the Turk (\"so many million Piastres to us, ready money, year by\r\nyear, and you shall, if not by our mediating, then by our fighting, be\r\na contented Turk\"); and all along at the different Russian-Turk\r\n\"Peace-Congresses,\" Kaunitz, while pretending to sit and mediate\r\nalong with Prussia, sat on that far other basis, privately thwarting\r\neverything; and span out the Turk pacification in a wretched manner\r\nfor years coming. [\"Peace of Kainardschi,\" not till \"21st July,\r\n1774,\"--after four or five abortive attempts, two of them \"Congresses,\"\r\nKaunitz so industrious (Hermann, v. 664 et antea).] A dangerous,\r\nhard-mouthed, high-stalking, ill-given old coach-horse of a Kaunitz:\r\nfancy what the driving of him might be, on a road he did not like! But\r\nhe had a driver too, who, in delicate adroitness, in patience and in\r\nsharpness of whip, was consummate: \"You shall know it is your one road,\r\nmy ill-given friend!\" (I ostentatiously increase my Cavalry by 8,000;\r\nmeaning, \"A new Seven-Years War, if you force me, and Russia by my side\r\nthis time!\") So that Kaunitz had to quit his Turk courses (never paid\r\nthe Piastres back), and go into what really was the one way out.\r\n\r\nBut Friedrich's difficulties on this course are not the thing that\r\ncan interest readers; and all readers know his faculty for overcoming\r\ndifficulties. Readers ask rather: \"And had Friedrich no feeling about\r\nPoland itself, then, and this atrocious Partitioning of the poor\r\nCountry?\" Apparently none whatever;--unless it might be, that\r\nDeliverance from Anarchy, Pestilence, Famine, and Pigs eating your dead\r\nbodies, would be a manifest advantage for Poland, while it was the\r\none way of saving Europe from War. Nobody seems more contented in\r\nconscience, or radiant with heartfelt satisfaction, and certainty of\r\nthanks from all wise and impartial men, than the King of Prussia, now\r\nand afterwards, in regard to this Polish atrocity! A psychological fact,\r\nwhich readers can notice. Scrupulous regard to Polish considerations,\r\nmagnanimity to Poland, or the least respect or pity for her as a\r\ndying Anarchy, is what nobody will claim for him; consummate talent in\r\nexecuting the Partition of Poland (inevitable some day, as he may have\r\nthought, but is nowhere at the pains to say),--great talent, great\r\npatience too, and meritorious self-denial and endurance, in executing\r\nthat Partition, and in saving IT from catching fire instead of being\r\nthe means to quench fire, no well-informed person will deny him. Of his\r\ndifficulties in the operation (which truly are unspeakable) I will say\r\nnothing more; readers are prepared to believe that he, beyond others,\r\nshould conquer difficulties when the object is vital to him. I will\r\nmark only the successive dates of his progress, and have done with this\r\nwearisome subject:--\r\n\r\nJune 14th, 1771. Within four months of the arrival of Prince Henri and\r\nthat first certainty from Russia, diligent Friedrich, upon whom the\r\nwhole burden had been laid of drawing up a Plan, and bringing Austria\r\nto consent, is able to report to Petersburg, That Austria has dubieties,\r\nreluctances, which it is to be foreseen she will gradually get over;\r\nand that here meanwhile (June 14th, 1771) is my Plan of Partition,--the\r\nsimplest conceivable: \"That each choose (subject to future\r\nadjustments) what will best suit him; I, for my own part, will say,\r\nWest-Preussen;--what Province will Czarish Majesty please to say?\"\r\nCzarish Majesty, in answer, is exorbitantly liberal to herself; claims,\r\nnot a Province, but four or five; will have Friedrich, if the Austrians\r\nattack her in consequence, to assist by declaring War on Austria;\r\nCzarish Majesty, in the reciprocal case, not to assist Friedrich at all,\r\ntill her Turk War is done! \"Impossible,\" thinks Friedrich; \"surprisingly\r\nso, high Madam! But, to the delicate bridle-hand, you are a manageable\r\nentity.\"\r\n\r\nIt was with Kaunitz that Friedrich's real difficulties lay. Privately,\r\nin the course of this Summer, Kaunitz, by way of preparation for\r\n\"mediating a Turk-Russian Peace,\" had concluded his \"subsidy Treaty\"\r\nwith the Turk, [\"6th July, 1771\" (Preuss, iv. 31; Hermann; &c.\r\n&c.).]--Treaty never ratified, but the Piastres duly paid;--Treaty\r\nrendering Peace impossible, so long as Kaunitz had to do with mediating\r\nit. And indeed Kaunitz's tricks in that function of mediator, and also\r\nafter it, were of the kind which Friedrich has some reason to call\r\n\"infamous.\" \"Your Majesty, as co-mediator, will join us, should the\r\nRussians make War?\" said Kaunitz's Ambassador, one day, to Friedrich.\r\n\"For certain, no!\" answered Friedrich; and, on the contrary, remounted\r\nhis Cavalry, to signify, \"I will fight the other way, if needed!\" which\r\ndid at once bring Kaunitz to give up his mysterious Turk projects, and\r\ncome into the Polish. After which, his exorbitant greed of territory\r\nthere; his attempts to get Russia into a partitioning of Turkey as\r\nwell,--(\"A slice of Turkey too, your Czarish Majesty and we?\" hints he\r\nmore than once),--gave Friedrich no end of trouble; and are singular\r\nto look at by the light there now is. Not for about a twelvemonth did\r\nFriedrich get his hard-mouthed Kaunitz brought into step at all; and\r\nto the last, perpetual vigilance and, by whip and bit, the adroitest\r\ncharioteering was needed on him.\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY 17th, 1772, Russia and Prussia, for their own part,--Friedrich,\r\nin the circumstances, submitting to many things from his Czarina,--get\r\ntheir particular \"Convention\" (Bargain in regard to Poland) completed in\r\nall parts, \"will take possession 4th June instant:\" sign said Convention\r\n(February 17th);--and invite Austria to join, and state her claims.\r\nWhich, in three weeks after, MARCH 4th, Austria does;--exorbitant\r\nabundantly; and NOT to be got very much reduced, though we try, for a\r\nseries of months. Till at last:--\r\n\r\nAUGUST 5th, 1772, Final Agreement between the Three Partitioning Powers:\r\n\"These are our respective shares; we take possession on the 1st OF\r\nSEPTEMBER instant:\"--and actual possession for Friedrich's share did,\r\non the 13th of that month, ensue. A right glad Friedrich, as everybody,\r\nfriend or enemy, may imagine him! Glad to have done with such a\r\nbusiness,--had there been no other profit in it; which was far from\r\nbeing the case. One's clear belief, on studying these Books, is of two\r\nthings: FIRST, that, as everybody admits, Friedrich had no real hand in\r\nstarting the notion of Partitioning Poland;--but that he grasped at it\r\nwith eagerness, as the one way of saving Europe from War: SECOND, what\r\nhas been much less noticed, that, under any other hand, it would have\r\nled Europe to War;--and that to Friedrich is due the fact, that it got\r\neffected without such accompaniment. Friedrich's share of Territory\r\nis counted to be in all 9,465 English square miles; Austria's, 62,500;\r\nRussia's, 87,500, [Preuss, iv. 45.] between nine and ten times the\r\namount of Friedrich's,--which latter, however, as an anciently Teutonic\r\nCountry, and as filling up the always dangerous gap between his\r\nOst-Preussen and him, has, under Prussian administration, proved much\r\nthe most valuable of the Three; and, next to Silesia, is Friedrich's\r\nmost important acquisition. SEPTEMBER 13th, 1772, it was at last entered\r\nupon,--through such waste-weltering confusions, and on terms never yet\r\nunquestionable.\r\n\r\nConsent of Polish Diet was not had for a year more; but that is worth\r\nlittle record. Diet, for that object, got together 19th APRIL, 1773;\r\nrecalcitrant enough, had not Russia understood the methods: \"a common\r\nfund was raised [ON SE COTISA, says Friedrich] for bribing;\" the\r\nThree Powers had each a representative General in Warsaw (Lentulus the\r\nPrussian personage), all three with forces to rear: Diet came down\r\nby degrees, and, in the course of five months (SEPTEMBER 18th, 1773),\r\nacquiesced in everything.\r\n\r\nAnd so the matter is ended; and various men will long have various\r\nopinions upon it. I add only this one small Document from Maria\r\nTheresa's hand, which all hearts, and I suppose even Friedrich's had\r\nhe ever read it, will pronounce to be very beautiful; homely, faithful,\r\nwholesome, well-becoming in a high and true Sovereign Woman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMPRESS-QUEEN TO PRINCE KAUNITZ (Undated: date must be Vienna,\r\nFebruary, 1772).\r\n\r\n\"When all my lands were invaded, and I knew not where in the world I\r\nshould find a place to be brought to bed in, I relied on my good right\r\nand the help of God. But in this thing, where not only public law cries\r\nto Heaven against us, but also all natural justice and sound reason,\r\nI must confess never in my life to have been in such trouble, and am\r\nashamed to show my face. Let the Prince [Kaunitz] consider what an\r\nexample we are giving to all the world, if, for a miserable piece of\r\nPoland, or of Moldavia or Wallachia, we throw our honor and reputation\r\nto the winds. I see well that I am alone, and no more in vigor;\r\ntherefore I must, though to my very great sorrow, let things take their\r\ncourse.\" [_\"Als alle meine lander angefochten wurden und gar nit mehr\r\nwusste wo ruhig niederkommen sollte, steiffete ich mich auf mein gutes\r\nRecht und den Beystand Gottes. Aber in dieser Sach, wo nit allein das\r\noffenbare Recht himmelschreyent wider Uns, sondern auch alle Billigkeit\r\nund die gesunde Vernunft wider Uns ist, muess bekhennen dass zeitlebens\r\nnit so beangstigt mich befunten und mich sehen zu lassen schame. Bedenkh\r\nder Furst, was wir aller Welt fur ein Exempel geben, wenn wir um ein\r\nellendes stuk von Pohlen oder von der Moldau und Wallachey unser ehr und\r\nREPUTATION in die schanz schlagen.

Writing to Voltaire, a good while after (POTSDAM,\r\n9th OCTOBER, 1773)) this, in the swift-flowing, miscellaneous Letter,\r\nis one passage:... \"To return to your King of Poland. I am aware that\r\nEurope pretty generally believes the late Partition made (QU'ON A FAIT)\r\nof Poland to be a result of the Political trickeries (MANIGANCES) which\r\nare attributed to me; nevertheless, nothing is more untrue. After in\r\nvain proposing different arrangements and expedients, there was no\r\nalternative left but either that same Partition, or else Europe kindled\r\ninto a general War. Appearances are deceitful; and the Public judges\r\nonly by these. What I tell you is as true as the Forty-seventh of\r\nEuclid.\" [_OEuvres de Frederic_, xxiii. 257.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT FRIEDRICH DID WITH HIS NEW ACQUISITION.\r\n\r\nConsiderable obloquy still rests on Friedrich, in many liberal circles,\r\nfor the Partition of Poland. Two things, however, seem by this time\r\ntolerably clear, though not yet known in liberal circles: first, that\r\nthe Partition of Poland was an event inevitable in Polish History; an\r\noperation of Almighty Providence and of the Eternal Laws of Nature, as\r\nwell as of the poor earthly Sovereigns concerned there; and secondly,\r\nthat Friedrich had nothing special to do with it, and, in the way of\r\noriginating or causing it, nothing whatever.\r\n\r\nIt is certain the demands of Eternal Justice must be fulfilled: in\r\nearthly instruments, concerned with fulfilling them, there may be all\r\ndegrees of demerit and also of merit,--from that of a world-ruffian\r\nAttila the Scourge of God, conscious of his own ferocities and\r\ncupidities alone, to that of a heroic Cromwell, sacredly aware that he\r\nis, at his soul's peril, doing God's Judgments on the enemies of God,\r\nin Tredah and other severe scenes. If the Laws and Judgments are verily\r\nthose of God, there can be no clearer merit than that of pushing them\r\nforward, regardless of the barkings of Gazetteers and wayside dogs,\r\nand getting them, at the earliest term possible, made valid among\r\nrecalcitrant mortals! Friedrich, in regard to Poland, I cannot find to\r\nhave had anything considerable either of merit or of demerit, in the\r\nmoral point of view; but simply to have accepted, and put in his pocket\r\nwithout criticism, what Providence sent. He himself evidently views\r\nit in that light; and is at no pains to conceal his great sense of the\r\nvalue of West-Preussen to him. We praised his Narrative as eminently\r\ntrue, and the only one completely intelligible in every point: in\r\nhis Preface to it, written some years later, he is still more candid.\r\nSpeaking there in the first person, this once and never before or\r\nafter,--he says:--\r\n\r\n\"These new pretensions [of the Czarina, to assuage the religious\r\nputrid-fever of the Poles by word of command] raised all Poland [into\r\nConfederation of Bar, and WAR OF THE CONFEDERATES, sung by Friedrich];\r\nthe Grandees of the Kingdom implored the assistance of the Turks:\r\nstraightway War flamed out; in which the Russian Armies had only to\r\nshow themselves to beat the Turks in every rencounter.\" His Majesty\r\ncontinues: \"This War changed the whole Political System of Europe\r\n[general Diplomatic Dance of Europe, suddenly brought to a whirl by such\r\nchanges of the music]; a new arena (CARRIERE) came to open itself,--and\r\none must have been either without address, or else buried in stupid\r\nsomnolence (ENGOURDISSEMENT), not to profit by an opportunity so\r\nadvantageous. I had read Bojardo's fine Allegory: [Signifies only,\r\n\"seize opportunity;\" but here is the passage itself:--\r\n\r\n     \"Quante volte le disse: 'O bella dama,\r\n     Conosci l'ora de la tua ventura,\r\n     Dapoi che un tal Baron piu the che se t'ama,\r\n     Che non ha il Ciel piu vaga creatura.\r\n     Forse anco avrai di questo tempo brama,\r\n     Che'l felice destin sempre non dura;\r\n     Prendi diletto, mentre sei su 'l verde,\r\n     Che l'avuto piacer mai non si perde.\r\n     Questa eta giovenil, ch' e si gioiosa,\r\n     Tutta in diletto consumar si deve,\r\n     Perche quasi in un punto ci e nas cosa:\r\n     Como dissolve 'l sol la bianca neve,\r\n     Como in un giorno la vermiglia rosa\r\n     Perde il vago color in tempo breve,\r\n     Cosi fugge l' eta com' un baleno,\r\n     E non si puo tener, che non ha freno.'\"\r\n\r\n(Bojardo, _Orlando Innamorato,_ lib. i. cant. 2.)] I seized by the\r\nforelock this unexpected opportunity; and, by dint of negotiating and\r\nintriguing [candid King] I succeeded in indemnifying our Monarchy for\r\nits past losses, by incorporating Polish Prussia with my Old Provinces.\"\r\n[_OEuvres de Frederic,_ (Preface to MEMOIRS DEPUIS 1763 JUSQU'A 1774),\r\nvi. 6, 7: \"MEMOIRES [Chapter FIRST, including all the Polish part] were\r\nfinished in 1775; Preface is of 1779.\"]\r\n\r\nHere is a Historian King who uses no rouge-pot in his Narratives,--whose\r\nword, which is all we shall say of it at present, you find to be\r\nperfectly trustworthy, and a representation of the fact as it stood\r\nbefore himself! What follows needs no vouching for: \"This acquisition\r\nwas one of the most important we could make, because it joined Pommern\r\nto East Prussia [ours for ages past], and because, rendering us masters\r\nof the Weichsel River, we gained the double advantage of being able to\r\ndefend that Kingdom [Ost-Preussen], and to draw considerable tolls from\r\nthe Weichsel, as all the trade of Poland goes by that River.\"\r\n\r\nYes truly! Our interests are very visible: and the interests and wishes\r\nand claims of Poland,--are they nowhere worthy of one word from you, O\r\nKing? Nowhere that I have noticed: not any mention of them, or allusion\r\nto them; though the world is still so convinced that perhaps they were\r\nsomething, and not nothing! Which is very curious. In the whole course\r\nof my reading I have met with no Autobiographer more careless to\r\ndefend himself upon points in dispute among his Audience, and marked as\r\ncriminal against him by many of them. Shadow of Apology on such points\r\nyou search for in vain. In rapid bare summary he sets down the sequel of\r\nfacts, as if assured beforehand of your favorable judgment, or with the\r\nprofoundest indifference to how you shall judge them; drops his actions,\r\nas an Ostrich does its young, to shift for themselves in the wilderness,\r\nand hurries on his way. This style of his, noticeable of old in regard\r\nto Silesia too, has considerably hurt him with the common kind of\r\nreaders; who, in their preconceived suspicions of the man, are all the\r\nmore disgusted at tracing in him, not the least anxiety to stand well\r\nwith any reader, more than to stand ill, AS ill as any reader likes!\r\n\r\nThird parties, it would seem, have small temptation to become his\r\nadvocates; he himself being so totally unprovided with thanks for you!\r\nBut, on another score, and for the sake of a better kind of readers,\r\nthere is one third party bound to remark: 1. That hardly any Sovereign\r\nknown to us did, in his general practice, if you will examine it, more\r\nperfectly respect the boundaries of his neighbors; and go on the road\r\nthat was his own, anxious to tread on no man's toes if he could avoid\r\nit: a Sovereign who, at all times, strictly and beneficently confined\r\nhimself to what belonged to his real business and him. 2. That\r\napparently, therefore, he must have considered Poland to be an\r\nexceptional case, unique in his experience: case of a moribund Anarchy,\r\nfallen down as carrion on the common highways of the world; belonging to\r\nnobody in particular; liable to be cut into (nay, for sanitary\r\nreasons requiring it, if one were a Rhadamanthus Errant, which one\r\nis not!)--liable to be cut into, on a great and critically stringent\r\noccasion; no question to be asked of IT; your only question the consent\r\nof by-standers, and the moderate certainty that nobody got a glaringly\r\ndisproportionate share! That must have been, on the part of an equitable\r\nFriedrich, or even of a Friedrich accurate in Book-keeping by Double\r\nEntry, the notion silently formed about Poland.\r\n\r\nWhether his notion was scientifically right, and conformable to actual\r\nfact, is a question I have no thought of entering on; still less,\r\nwhether Friedrich was morally right, or whether there was not a higher\r\nrectitude, granting even the fact, in putting it in practice. These are\r\nquestions on which an Editor may have his opinion, partly complete for a\r\nlong time past, partly not complete, or, in human language, completable\r\nor pronounceable at all; and may carefully forbear to obtrude it on his\r\nreaders; and only advise them to look with their own best eyesight, to\r\nbe deaf to the multiplex noises which are evidently blind, and to think\r\nwhat they find thinkablest on such a subject. For, were it never so\r\njust, proper and needful, this is by nature a case of LYNCH LAW; upon\r\nwhich, in the way of approval or apology, no spoken word is permissible.\r\nLynch being so dangerous a Lawgiver, even when an indispensable one!--\r\n\r\nFor, granting that the Nation of Poland was for centuries past an\r\nAnarchy doomed by the Eternal Laws of Heaven to die, and then of\r\ncourse to get gradually buried, or eaten by neighbors, were it only for\r\nsanitary reasons,--it will by no means suit, to declare openly on behalf\r\nof terrestrial neighbors who have taken up such an idea (granting it\r\nwere even a just one, and a true reading of the silent but inexorably\r\ncertain purposes of Heaven), That they, those volunteer terrestrial\r\nneighbors, are justified in breaking in upon the poor dying or dead\r\ncarcass, and flaying and burying it, with amicable sharing of skin and\r\nshoes! If it even were certain that the wretched Polish Nation, for the\r\nlast forty years hastening with especial speed towards death, did in\r\npresent circumstances, with such a howling canaille of Turk Janissaries\r\nand vultures of creation busy round it, actually require prompt surgery,\r\nin the usual method, by neighbors,--the neighbors shall and must do that\r\nfunction at their own risk. If Heaven did appoint them to it, Heaven,\r\nfor certain, will at last justify them; and in the mean while, for a\r\ngeneration or two, the same Heaven (I can believe) has appointed\r\nthat Earth shall pretty unanimously condemn them. The shrieks, the\r\nfoam-lipped curses of mistaken mankind, in such case, are mankind's one\r\nsecurity against over-promptitude (which is so dreadfully possible) on\r\nthe part of surgical neighbors.\r\n\r\nAlas, yes, my articulate-speaking friends; here, as so often elsewhere,\r\nthe solution of the riddle is not Logic, but Silence. When a dark human\r\nIndividual has filled the measure of his wicked blockheadisms, sins and\r\nbrutal nuisancings, there are Gibbets provided, there are Laws provided;\r\nand you can, in an articulate regular manner, hang him and finish him,\r\nto general satisfaction. Nations too, you may depend on it as certain,\r\ndo require the same process, and do infallibly get it withal; Heaven's\r\nJustice, with written Laws or without, being the most indispensable and\r\nthe inevitablest thing I know of in this Universe. No doing without it;\r\nand it is sure to come:--and the Judges and Executioners, we observe,\r\nare NOT, in that latter case, escorted in and out by the Sheriffs of\r\nCounties and general ringing of bells; not so, in that latter case, but\r\nfar otherwise!--\r\n\r\nAnd now, leaving that vexed question, we will throw one glance--only one\r\nis permitted--into the far more profitable question, which probably\r\nwill one day be the sole one on this matter, What became of poor\r\nWest-Preussen under Friedrich? Had it to sit, weeping unconsolably, or\r\nnot? Herr Dr. Freytag, a man of good repute in Literature, has, in one\r\nof his late Books of Popular History, [G. Freytag, _Neue Bilder aus dem\r\nLeben des deutschen Volkes_ (Leipzig, 1862).] gone into this subject,\r\nin a serious way, and certainly with opportunities far beyond mine for\r\ninforming himself upon it:--from him these Passages have been excerpted,\r\nlabelled and translated by a good hand:--\r\n\r\nACQUISITION OF POLISH PRUSSIA. \"During several Centuries, the\r\nmuch-divided Germans had habitually been pressed upon, and straitened\r\nand injured, by greedy conquering neighbors; Friedrich was the first\r\nConqueror who once more pushed forward the German Frontier towards the\r\nEast; reminding the Germans again, that it was their task to carry Law,\r\nCulture, Liberty and Industry into the East of Europe. All Friedrich's\r\nLands, with the exception only of some Old-Saxon territory, had, by\r\nforce and colonization, been painfully gained from the Sclave. At no\r\ntime since the migrations of the Middle Ages, had this struggle for\r\npossession of the wide Plains to the east of Oder ceased. When arms were\r\nat rest, politicians carried on the struggle.\"\r\n\r\nPERSECUTION OF GERMAN PROTESTANTS IN POLAND. \"In the very 'Century of\r\nEnlightenment' the persecution of the Germans became fanatical in those\r\nCountries: one Protestant Church after the other got confiscated; pulled\r\ndown; if built of wood, set on fire: its Church once burnt, the Village\r\nhad lost the privilege of having one. Ministers and schoolmasters were\r\ndriven away, cruelly maltreated. 'VEXA LUTHERANURN, DABIT THALERUM\r\n(Wring the Lutheran, you will find money in him),' became the current\r\nProverb of the Poles in regard to Germans. A Protestant Starost of\r\nGnesen, a Herr von UNRUH of the House of Birnbaum, one of the largest\r\nproprietors of the country, was condemned to die, and first to have his\r\ntongue pulled out and his hands cut off,--for the crime of having copied\r\ninto his Note-book some strong passages against the Jesuits, extracted\r\nfrom German Books. Patriotic 'Confederates of Bar,' joined by all the\r\nplunderous vagabonds around, went roaming and ravaging through the\r\ncountry, falling upon small towns and German villages. The Polish\r\nNobleman, Roskowski [a celebrated \"symbolical\" Nobleman, this], put\r\non one red boot and one black, symbolizing FIRE and DEATH; and in this\r\nguise rode about, murdering and burning, from places to place; finally,\r\nat Jastrow, he cut off the hands, feet, and lastly the head of the\r\nProtestant Pastor, Willich by name, and threw the limbs into a swamp.\r\nThis happened in 1768.\"\r\n\r\nIN WHAT STATE FRIEDRICH FOUND THE POLISH PROVINCES. \"Some few only of\r\nthe larger German Towns, which were secured by walls, and some protected\r\nDistricts inhabited exclusively by Germans,--as the NIEDERUNG near\r\nDantzig, the Villages under the mild rule of the Cistercians of\r\nOliva, and the opulent German towns of the Catholic Ermeland,--were in\r\ntolerable circumstances. The other Towns lay in ruins; so also most of\r\nthe Hamlets (HOFE) of the open Country. Bromberg, the city of German\r\nColonists, the Prussians found in heaps and ruins: to this hour it\r\nhas not been possible to ascertain clearly how the Town came into this\r\ncondition. [_\"Neue Preussische Provinzialblotter,_ Year 1854, No. 4, p.\r\n259.\"] No historian, no document, tells of the destruction and slaughter\r\nthat had been going on, in the whole District of the NETZE there, during\r\nthe last ten years before the arrival of the Prussians, The Town of\r\nCulm had preserved its strong old walls and stately churches; but in the\r\nstreets, the necks of the cellars stood out above the rotten timber and\r\nbrick heaps of the tumbled houses: whole streets consisted merely of\r\nsuch cellars, in which wretched people were still trying to live. Of\r\nthe forty houses in the large Market-place of Culm, twenty-eight had no\r\ndoors, no roofs, no windows, and no owners. Other Towns were in similar\r\ncondition.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Country people hardly knew such a thing as bread; many had never\r\nin their life tasted such a delicacy; few Villages possessed an oven. A\r\nweaving-loom was rare, the spinning-wheel unknown. The main article of\r\nfurniture, in this bare scene of squalor, was the Crucifix and vessel\r\nof Holy-Water under it [and \"POLACK! CATHOLIK!\" if a drop of gin\r\nbe added].--The Peasant-Noble [unvoting, inferior kind] was hardly\r\ndifferent from the common Peasant: he himself guided his Hook Plough\r\n(HACKEN-PFLUG), and clattered with his wooden slippers upon the\r\nplankless floor of his hut.... It was a desolate land, without\r\ndiscipline, without law, without a master. On 9,000 English square miles\r\nlived 500,000 souls: not 55 to the square mile.\"\r\n\r\nSETS TO WORK. \"The very rottenness of the Country became an attraction\r\nfor Friedrich; and henceforth West-Preussen was, what hitherto Silesia\r\nhad been, his favorite child; which, with infinite care, like that of an\r\nanxious loving mother, he washed, brushed, new-dressed, and forced to\r\ngo to school and into orderly habits, and kept ever in his eye. The\r\ndiplomatic squabbles about this 'acquisition' were still going on,\r\nwhen he had already sent [so early as June 4th, 1772, and still more on\r\nSeptember 13th of that Year [See his new DIALOGUE with Roden, our Wesel\r\nacquaintance, who was a principal Captain in this business (in PREUSS,\r\niv. 57, 58: date of the Dialogue is \"11th May, 1772;\"--Roden was on the\r\nground 4th June next; but, owing to Austrian delays, did not begin\r\ntill September 13th).]] a body of his best Official People into this\r\nwaste-howling scene, to set about organizing it. The Landschaften\r\n(COUNTIES) were divided into small Circles; in a minimum of time, the\r\nland was valued, and an equal tax put upon it; every Circle received its\r\nLANDRATH, Law-Court, Post-office and Sanitary Police. New Parishes, each\r\nwith its Church and Parson, were called into existence as by miracle;\r\na company of 187 Schoolmasters--partly selected and trained by\r\nthe excellent Semler [famous over Germany, in Halle University and\r\nSEMINARIUM, not yet in England]--were sent into the Country: multitudes\r\nof German Mechanics too, from brick-makers up to machine-builders.\r\nEverywhere there began a digging, a hammering, a building; Cities were\r\npeopled anew; street after street rose out of the heaps of ruins; new\r\nVillages of Colonists were laid out, new modes of agriculture ordered.\r\nIn the first Year after taking possession, the great Canal [of Bromberg]\r\nwas dug; which, in a length of fifteen miles, connects, by the Netze\r\nRiver, the Weichsel with the Oder and the Elbe: within one year after\r\ngiving the order, the King saw loaded vessels from the Oder, 120 feet in\r\nlength of keel,\" and of forty tons burden, \"enter the Weichsel. The vast\r\nbreadths of land, gained from the state of swamp by drainage into this\r\nCanal, were immediately peopled by German Colonists.\r\n\r\n\"As his Seven-Years Struggle of War may be called super-human, so was\r\nthere also in his present Labor of Peace something enormous; which\r\nappeared to his contemporaries [unless my fancy mislead me] almost\r\npreternatural, at times inhuman. It was grand, but also terrible, that\r\nthe success of the whole was to him, at all moments, the one thing to be\r\nstriven after; the comfort of the individual of no concern at all. When,\r\nin the Marshland of the Wetze, he counted more the strokes of the 10,000\r\nspades, than the sufferings of the workers, sick with the marsh-fever in\r\nthe hospitals which he had built for them; [Compare PREUSS, iv. 60-71.]\r\nwhen, restless, his demands outran the quickest performance,--there\r\nunited itself to the deepest reverence and devotedness, in his People,\r\na feeling of awe, as for one whose limbs are not moved by earthly life\r\n[fanciful, considerably!]. And when Goethe, himself become an old man,\r\nfinished his last Drama [Second Part of FAUST], the figure of the old\r\nKing again rose on him, and stept into his Poem; and his Faust got\r\ntransformed into an unresting, creating, pitilessly exacting Master,\r\nforcing on his salutiferous drains and fruitful canals through the\r\nmorasses of the Weichsel.\" [G. Freytag, _Neue Bilder aus dem Leben des\r\ndeutschen Volkes_ (Leipzig, 1862), pp. 397-408.]\r\n\r\nThese statements and pencillings of Freytag, apart from here and there\r\na flourish of poetic sentiment, I believe my readers can accept as\r\nessentially true, and a correct portrait of the fact. And therewith, CON\r\nLA BOCCA DOLCE, we will rise from this Supper of Horrors. That Friedrich\r\nfortified the Country, that he built an impregnable Graudentz, and two\r\nother Fortresses, rendering the Country, and himself on that Eastern\r\nside, impregnable henceforth, all readers can believe. Friedrich has\r\nbeen building various Fortresses in this interim, though we have taken\r\nno notice of them; building and repairing many things;--trimming up his\r\nMilitary quite to the old pitch, as the most particular thing of all. He\r\nhas his new Silesian Fortress of Silberberg,--big Fortress, looking\r\ninto certain dangerous Bohemian Doors (in Tobias Stusche's Country,\r\nif readers recollect an old adventure now mythical);--his new Silesian\r\nSilberberg, his newer Polish Graudentz, and many others, and flatters\r\nhimself he is not now pregnable on any side.\r\n\r\nA Friedrich working, all along, in Poland especially, amid what\r\ncircumambient deluges of maledictory outcries, and mendacious\r\nshriekeries from an ill-informed Public, is not now worth mentioning.\r\nMere distracted rumors of the Pamphleteer and Newspaper kind: which,\r\nafter hunting them a long time, through dense and rare, end mostly in\r\nzero, and angry darkness of some poor human brain,--or even testify in\r\nfavor of this Head-Worker, and of the sense he shows, especially of the\r\npatience. For example: that of the \"Polish Towns and Villages, ordered\"\r\nby this Tyrant \"to deliver, each of them, so many marriageable girls;\r\neach girl to bring with her as dowry, furnished by her parents,\r\n1 feather-bed, 4 pillows, 1 cow, 3 swine and 3 ducats,\"--in which\r\ndesirable condition this tyrannous King \"sent her into the Brandenburg\r\nStates to be wedded and promote population.\" [Lindsey, LETTERS ON POLAND\r\n(Letter 2d). p. 61: Peyssonnel (in some. French Book of his, \"solemnly\r\npresented to Louis XVI. and the Constituent Assembly;\" cited in PREUSS,\r\niv. 85); &c. &c.] Feather-beds, swine and ducats had their value in\r\nBrandenburg; but were marriageable girls such a scarcity there? Most\r\nextraordinary new RAPE OF THE SABINES; for which Herr Preuss can find no\r\nbasis or source,--nor can I; except in the brain of Reverend Lindsey and\r\nhis loud LETTERS ON POLAND above mentioned.\r\n\r\nDantzig too, and the Harbor-dues, what a case! Dantzig Harbor, that\r\nis to say, Netze River, belongs mainly to Friedrich, Dantzig City\r\nnot,--such the Czarina's lofty whim, in the late Partition Treatyings;\r\nnot good to contradict, in the then circumstances; still less\r\nafterwards, though it brought chicanings more than enough. \"And she\r\nwas not ill-pleased to keep this thorn in the King's foot for her own\r\nconveniences,\" thinks the King; though, mainly, he perceives that it is\r\nthe English acting on her grandiose mind: English, who were apprehensive\r\nfor their Baltic trade under this new Proprietor, and who egged on an\r\nambitious Czarina to protect Human Liberty, and an inflated Dantzig\r\nBurgermeister to stand up for ditto; and made a dismal shriekery in\r\nthe Newspapers, and got into dreadful ill-humor with said Proprietor\r\nof Dantzig Harbor, and have never quite recovered from it to this day.\r\nLindsey's POLISH LETTERS are very loud again on this occasion, aided\r\nby his SEVEN DIALOGUES ON POLAND; concerning which, partly for extinct\r\nLindsey's sake, let us cite one small passage, and so wind up.\r\n\r\nMARCH 2d, 1775, in answer to Voltaire, Friedrich writes:... \"The POLISH\r\nDIALOGUES you speak of are not known to me. I think of such Satires,\r\nwith Epictetus: 'If they tell any truth of thee, correct thyself; if\r\nthey are lies, laugh at them.' I have learned, with years, to become a\r\nsteady coach-horse; I do my stage, like a diligent roadster, and pay\r\nno heed to the little dogs that will bark by the way.\" And then, three\r\nweeks after:--\r\n\r\n\"I have at length got the SEVEN DIALOGUES ON POLAND; and the whole\r\nhistory of them as well. The Author is an Englishman named Lindsey,\r\nParson by profession, and Tutor to the young Prince Poniatowski,\r\nthe King of Poland's Nephew,\"--Nephew Joseph, Andreas's Son, NOT the\r\nundistinguished Nephew: so we will believe for poor loud Lindsey's\r\nsake! \"It was at the instigation of the Czartoryskis, Uncles of the King,\r\nthat Lindsey composed this Satire,--in English first of all. Satire\r\nready, they perceived that nobody in Poland would understand it, unless\r\nit were translated into French; which accordingly was done. But as their\r\ntranslator was unskilful, they sent the DIALOGUES to a certain Gerard at\r\nDantzig, who at that time was French Consul there, and who is at present\r\na Clerk in your Foreign Office under M. de Vergennes. This Gerard, who\r\ndoes not want for wit, but who does me the honor to hate me cordially,\r\nretouched these DIALOGUES, and put them into the condition they were\r\npublished in. I have laughed a good deal at them: here and there occur\r\ncoarse things (GROSSIERETES), and platitudes of the insipid kind:\r\nbut there are traits of good pleasantry. I shall not go fencing with\r\ngoose-quills against this sycophant. As Mazarin said, 'Let the French\r\nkeep singing, provided they let us keep doing.'\" [_OEuvres de Frederic,_\r\nxxiii. 319-321: \"Potsdam, 2d March, 1775,\" and \"25th March\" following.\r\nSee PREUSS, iii. 275, iv. 85.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V.--A CHAPTER OF MISCELLANIES.\r\n\r\nAfter Neustadt, Kaiser Joseph and the King had no more Interviews.\r\nKaunitz's procedures in the subsequent Pacification and Partition\r\nbusiness had completely estranged the two Sovereigns: to friendly\r\nvisiting, a very different state of mutual feeling had succeeded;\r\nwhich went on, such \"the immeasurable ambition\" visible in some of\r\nus, deepening and worsening itself, instead of improving or abating.\r\nFriedrich had Joseph's Portrait hung in conspicuous position in the\r\nrooms where he lived; somebody noticing the fact, Friedrich answered:\r\n\"Ah, yes, I am obliged to keep that young Gentleman in my eye.\" And,\r\nin effect, the rest of Friedrich's Political Activity, from this time\r\nonwards, may be defined as an ever-vigilant defence of himself, and of\r\nthe German Reich, against Austrian Encroachment: which, to him, in the\r\nyears then running, was the grand impending peril; and which to us in\r\nthe new times has become so inexpressibly uninteresting, and will bear\r\nno narrative, Austrian Encroachment did not prove to be the death-peril\r\nthat had overhung the world in Friedrich's last years!--\r\n\r\nThese, accordingly, are years in which the Historical interest goes\r\non diminishing; and only the Biographical, were anything of Biography\r\nattainable, is left. Friedrich's industrial, economic and other Royal\r\nactivities are as beautiful as ever; but cannot to our readers, in our\r\nlimits, be described with advantage. Events of world-interest, after the\r\nPartition of Poland, do not fall out, or Friedrich is not concerned in\r\nthem. It is a dim element; its significance chiefly German or Prussian,\r\nnot European. What of humanly interesting is discoverable in it,--at\r\nleast, while the Austrian Grudge continues in a chronic state, and has\r\nno acute fit,--I will here present in the shape of detached Fragments,\r\nsuitably arranged and rendered legible, in hopes these may still have\r\nsome lucency for readers, and render more conceivable the surrounding\r\nmasses that have to be left dark. Our first Piece is of Winter, or late\r\nAutumn, 1771,--while the solution of the Polish Business is still in its\r\ninchoative stages; perfectly complete in the Artist's own mind; Russia\r\ntoo adhering; but Kaunitz so refractory and contradictory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHERR DOCTOR ZIMMERMANN, THE FAMOUS AUTHOR OF THE BOOK \"ON SOLITUDE,\"\r\nWALKS REVERENTIALLY BEFORE FRIEDRICH'S DOOR IN THE DUSK OF AN OCTOBER\r\nEVENING: AND HAS A ROYAL INTERVIEW NEXT DAY.\r\n\r\nFriday Evening, 25th October, 1771, is the date of Zimmermann's walk\r\nof contemplation,--among the pale Statues and deciduous Gardenings of\r\nSans-Souci Cottage (better than any Rialto, at its best),--the eternal\r\nstars coming out overhead, and the transitory candle-light of a King\r\nFriedrich close by.\r\n\r\n\"At Sans-Souci,\" says he, in his famed Book, \"where that old God of War\r\n(KRIEGSGOTT) forges his thunder-bolts, and writes Works of Intellect\r\nfor Posterity; where he governs his People as the best father would\r\nhis house; where, during one half of the day, he accepts and reads the\r\npetitions and complaints of the meanest citizen or peasant; comes to\r\nhelp of his Countries on all sides with astonishing sums of money,\r\nexpecting no payment, nor seeking anything but the Common Weal;\r\nand where, during the other half, he is a Poet and Philosopher:--at\r\nSans-Souci, I say, there reigns all round a silence, in which you can\r\nhear the faintest breath of every soft wind. I mounted this Hill for the\r\nfirst time in Winter [late Autumn, 25th October, 1771, edge of Winter],\r\nin the dusk. When I beheld the small Dwelling-House of this Convulser\r\nof the World close by me, and was near his very chamber, I saw indeed a\r\nlight inside, but no sentry or watchman at the Hero's door; no soul to\r\nask me, Who I was, or What I wanted. I saw nothing; and walked about as\r\nI pleased before this small and silent House.\" [Preuss, i. 387 (\"from\r\nEINSAMKEIT,\" Zimmermann's SOLITUDE, \"i. 110; Edition of Leipzig,\r\n1784\").]\r\n\r\nYes, Doctor, this is your Kriegsgott; throned in a free-and-easy\r\nfashion. In regard to that of Sentries, I believe there do come up from\r\nPotsdam nightly a corporal and six rank-and-file; but perhaps it is at\r\na later hour; perhaps they sit within doors, silent, not to make noises.\r\nAnother gentleman, of sauntering nocturnal habits, testifies to having,\r\none night, seen the King actually asleep in bed, the doors being left\r\najar. [Ib. i. 388.]--As Zimmermann had a DIALOGUE next day with his\r\nMajesty, which we propose to give; still more, as he made such noise in\r\nthe world by other Dialogues with Friedrich, and by a strange Book about\r\nthem, which are still ahead,--readers may desire to know a little who or\r\nwhat the Zimmermann is, and be willing for a rough brief Note upon him,\r\nwhich certainly is not readier than it is rough:--\r\n\r\nJohann Georg Zimmermann: born 1728, at Brugg in the Canton of Bern,\r\nwhere his Father seems to have had some little property and no\r\nemployment, \"a RATHSHERR (Town-Councillor), who was much respected.\" Of\r\nbrothers or sisters, no mention. The Mother being from the French part\r\nof the Canton, he learned to speak both languages. Went to Bern for his\r\nLatin and high-schooling; then to Gottingen, where he studied Medicine,\r\nunder the once great Haller and other now dimmed celebrities. Haller,\r\nhimself from Bern, had taken Zimmermann to board, and became much\r\nattached to him: Haller, in 1752, came on a summer visit to native Bern:\r\nZimmermann, who had in the mean time been \"for a few months\" in France,\r\nin Italy and England, now returned and joined him there; but the great\r\nman, feeling very poorly and very old, decided that he would like to\r\nstay in Bern, and not move any more;--Zimmermann, accordingly, was sent\r\nto Gottingen to bring Mrs. Haller, with her Daughters, bandboxes and\r\neffects, home to Bern. Which he did;--and not only them, but a soft,\r\ningenious, ingenuous and rather pretty young Gottingen Lady along with\r\nthem, as his own Wife withal. With her he settled as STADTPHYSICUS\r\n(Town-Doctor) in native Brugg; where his beloved Hallers were within\r\nreach; and practice in abundance, and honors, all that the place\r\nyielded, were in readiness for him.\r\n\r\nHere he continued some sixteen years; very busy, very successful in\r\nmedicine and literature; but \"tormented with hypochondria;\"--having\r\nindeed an immense conceit of himself, and generally too thin a skin for\r\nthis world. Here he first wrote his Book on SOLITUDE, a Book famed over\r\nall the world in my young days (and perhaps still famed); he wrote it\r\na second time, MUCH ENLARGED, about thirty years after: [_Betrachtungen\r\nuber die Einsamkeit, von Doctor J. G. Zimmermann, Stadtphysicus\r\nin Brugg_ (Zurich, 1756),--as yet only \"1 vol. 8vo, price 6d.\" (5\r\ngroschen); but it grew with years; and (Leipzig, 1784) came out\r\nremodelled into 4 vols.;--was translated into French, \"with many\r\nomissions,\" by Mercier (Paris, 1790); into English from Mercier\r\n(London, 1791). \"Zurich, 1763-1764:\" by and by, one \"Dobson did it into\r\nEnglish.\"] I read it (in the curtailed English-Mercier form, no Scene\r\nin it like the above), in early boyhood,--and thank it for nothing, or\r\nnearly so. Zimmermann lived much alone, at Brugg and elsewhere; all his\r\ndays \"Hypochondria\" was the main company he had:--and it was natural,\r\nbut UNprofitable, that he should say, to himself and others, the best\r\nhe could for that bad arrangement: poor soul! He wrote also on MEDICAL\r\nEXPERIENCE, a famed Book in its day;\" also on NATIONAL PRIDE; and\r\nbecame famed through the Universe, and was Member of infinite Learned\r\nSocieties.\r\n\r\nAll which rendered dull dead Brugg still duller and more dead; unfit\r\nutterly for a man of such sublime accomplishments. Plenty of Counts\r\nStadion, Kings of Poland even, offered him engagements; eager to\r\npossess such a man, and deliver him from dull dead Brugg; but he\r\nhad hypochondria, and always feared their deliverance might be into\r\nsomething duller. At length,--in his fortieth year, 1768,--the place of\r\nCourt-Physician (HOFMEDICUS) at Hanover was offered him by George the\r\nThird of pious memory, and this he resolved to accept; and did lift\r\nanchor, and accept and occupy accordingly.\r\n\r\nAlas, at the Gate of Hanover, \"his carriage overset;\" broke his poor old\r\nMother-in-law's leg (who had been rejoicing doubtless to get home\r\ninto her own Country), and was the end of her--poor old soul;--and the\r\nbeginning of misfortunes continual and too tedious to mention. Spleen,\r\nenvy, malice and calumny, from the Hanover Medical world; treatment, \"by\r\nthe old buckram Hofdames who had drunk coffee with George II.,\" \"which\r\nwas fitter for a laquais-de-place\" than for a medical gentleman\r\nof eminence: unworthy treatment, in fact, in many or most\r\nquarters;--followed by hypochondria, by dreadful bodily disorder (kind\r\nnot given or discoverable), \"so that I suffered the pains of Hell,\" sat\r\nweeping, sat gnashing my teeth, and could n't write a Note after dinner;\r\nfollowed finally by the sickness, and then by the death, of my poor\r\nWife, \"after five months of torment.\" Upon which, in 1771, Zimmermann's\r\nfriends--for he had many friends, being, in fact, a person of fine\r\ngraceful intellect, high proud feelings and tender sensibilities, gone\r\nall to this sad state--rallied themselves; set his Hanover house in\r\norder for him (governess for his children, what not); and sent him\r\noff to Berlin, there to be dealt with by one Meckel, an incomparable\r\nSurgeon, and be healed of his dreadful disorder (\"LEIBESSCHADE, of which\r\nthe first traces had appeared in Brugg\"),--though to most people it\r\nseemed rather he would die; \"and one Medical Eminency in Hanover said to\r\nmyself [Zimmermann] one day: 'Dr. So-and-so is to have your Pension,\r\nI am told; now, by all right, it should belong to me, don't you think\r\nso?'\" What, \"I\" thought of the matter, seeing the greedy gentleman thus\r\n\"parting my skin,\" may be conjectured!--\r\n\r\nThe famed Meckel received his famed patient with a nobleness worthy\r\nof the heroic ages. Dodged him in his own house, in softest beds\r\nand appliances; spoke comfort to him, hope to him,--the gallant\r\nMeckel;--rallied, in fact, the due medical staff one morning; came up to\r\nZimmermann, who \"stripped,\" with the heart of a lamb and lion conjoined,\r\nand trusting in God, \"flung himself on his bed\" (on his face, or on\r\nhis back, we never know), and there, by the hands of Meckel and staff,\r\n\"received above 2,000 (TWO THOUSAND) cuts in the space of an hour\r\nand half, without uttering one word or sound.\" A frightful operation,\r\ngallantly endured, and skilfully done; whereby the \"bodily disorder\"\r\n(LEIBESSCHADE), whatever it might be, was effectually and forever sent\r\nabout its business by the noble Meckel.\r\n\r\nHospitalities and soft, hushed kindnesses and soothing ministrations, by\r\nMeckel and by everybody, were now doubled and trebled: wise kind Madam\r\nMeckel, young kind Mamsell Meckel and the Son (who \"now, in\r\n1788, lectures in Gottingen\"); not these only, nor Schmucker Head\r\nArmy-Surgeon, and the ever-memorable HERR GENERALCHIRURGUS Madan, who\r\nhad both been in the operation; not these only, but by degrees all that\r\nwas distinguished in the Berlin world, Ramler, Busching, Sulzer, Prime\r\nMinister Herzberg, Queen's and King's Equerries, and honorable men and\r\nwomen,--bore him \"on angel-wings\" towards complete recovery. Talked\r\nto him, sang and danced to him (at least, the \"Muses\" and the female\r\nMeckels danced and sang), and all lapped him against eating cares, till,\r\nafter twelve weeks, he was fairly on his feet again, and able to make\r\njaunts in the neighborhood with his \"life's savior,\" and enjoy the\r\npleasant Autumn weather to his farther profit.--All this, though\r\ndescribed in ridiculous superlative by Zimmermann, is really touching,\r\nbeautiful and human: perhaps never in his life was he so happy, or\r\na thousandth part so helped by man, as while under the roof of this\r\nthrice-useful Meckel,--more power to Meckel!\r\n\r\nHead Army-Surgeon Schmucker had gone through all the Seven-Years War;\r\nZimmermann, an ardent Hero-worshipper, was never weary questioning\r\nhim, listening to him in full career of narrative, on this great\r\nsubject,--only eight years old at that time. Among their country drives,\r\nMeckel took him to Potsdam, twenty English miles off; in the end of\r\nOctober, there to stay a night. This was the ever-memorable Friday, when\r\nwe first ascended the Hill of Sans-Souci, and had our evening walk of\r\ncontemplation:--to be followed by a morrow which was ten times more\r\nmemorable: as readers shall now see. [Jordens, _Lexikon_ (Zimmermann),\r\nv. 632-658 (exact and even eloquent account, as these of Jordens,\r\nunexpectedly, often are); Zimmermann himself, UNTERREDUNGEN MIT\r\nFRIEDRICH DEM GROSSEN (ubi infra); Tissot, _Vie de M. Zimmermann_\r\n(Lausanne, 1797): &c. &c.]\r\n\r\nNEXT DAY, ZIMMERMANN HAS A DIALOGUE. Schmucker had his apartments\r\nin \"LITTLE SANS-SOUCI,\" where the King now lived (Big Sans-Souci, or\r\n\"Sans-Souci\" by itself, means in those days, not in ours at all, \"New\r\nPalace, NEUE PALAIS,\" now in all its splendor of fresh finish). De\r\nCatt, Friedrich's Reader, whom we know well, was a Genevese, and knew\r\nZimmermann from of old. Schmucker and De Catt were privately twitching\r\nup Friedrich's curiosity,--to whom also Zimmermann's name, and\r\nperhaps his late surgical operation, might be known: \"Can he speak\r\nFrench?\"--\"Native to him, your Majesty.\" Friedrich had some notion to\r\nsee Zimmermann; and judicious De Catt, on this fortunate Saturday, \"26th\r\nOctober, 1771,\" morrow after Zimmermann's arrival at Potsdam, \"came to\r\nour inn about, 1 P.M. [King's dinner just done]; and asked me to come\r\nand look at the beauties of Sans-Souci [Big Sans-Souci] for a little.\"\r\nZimmermann willingly went: Catt, left him in good hands to see the\r\nbeauties; slipt off, for his own part, to \"LITTLE Sans-Souci;\" came\r\nback, took Zimmermann thither; left, him with Schmucker, all trembling,\r\nthinking perhaps the King might call him. \"I trembled sometimes, then\r\nagain I felt exceeding happiness:\" I was in Schmucker's room, sitting\r\nby the fire, mostly alone for a good while, \"the room that had once\r\nbeen Marquis d'Argens's\" (who is now dead, and buried far away, good\r\nold soul);--when, at last, about half-past 4, Catt came jumping in,\r\nbreathless with joy; snatched me up: \"His Majesty wants to speak with\r\nyou this very moment!\" Zimmermann's self shall say the rest.\r\n\r\n\"I hurried, hand-in-hand with Catt, along a row of Chambers. 'Here,'\r\nsaid Catt, 'we are now at the King's room!'--My heart thumped, like\r\nto spring out of my body. Catt went in; but next moment the door again\r\nopened, and Catt bade me enter.\r\n\r\n\"In the middle of the room stood an iron camp-bed without curtains.\r\nThere, on a worn mattress, lay King Friedrich, the terror of Europe,\r\nwithout coverlet, in an old blue roquelaure. He had a big cocked-hat,\r\nwith a white feather [hat aged, worn soft as duffel, equal to most caps;\r\n\"feather\" is not perpendicular, but horizontal, round the inside of the\r\nbrim], on his head.\r\n\r\n\"The King took off his hat very graciously, when I was perhaps ten steps\r\nfrom him; and said in French (our whole Dialogue proceeded in French):\r\n'Come nearer, M. Zimmermann.'\r\n\r\n\"I advanced to within two steps of the King; he said in the mean while\r\nto Catt: 'Call Schmucker in, too.' Herr Schmucker came; placed himself\r\nbehind the King, his back to the wall; and Catt stood behind me. Now the\r\nColloquy began.\r\n\r\nKING. \"'I hear you have found your health again in Berlin; I wish you\r\njoy of that.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'I have found my life again in Berlin; but at this moment, Sire, I\r\nfind here a still greater happiness!' [ACH!]\r\n\r\nKING. \"'You have stood a cruel operation: you must have suffered\r\nhorribly?'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'Sire, it was well worth while.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'Did, you let them bind you before the operation?'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'No: I resolved to keep my freedom.'\r\n\r\nKING (laughing in a very kind manner). \"'Oh, you behaved like a brave\r\nSwitzer! But are you quite recovered, though?'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'Sire, I have seen all the wonders of your creation in Sans-Souci,\r\nand feel well in looking at them.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'I am glad of that. But you must have a care, and especially not\r\nget on horseback.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'It will be pleasant and easy for me to follow the counsels of\r\nyour Majesty.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'From what Town in the Canton of Bern are you originally?'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'From Brugg.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'I don't know that Town.' [No wonder, thought I!]\r\n\r\nKING. \"'Where did you study?'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'At Gottingen: Haller was my teacher.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'What is M. Haller doing now?'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'He is concluding his literary career with a romance.' [USONG had\r\njust come out;--no mortal now reads a word of it; and the great Haller\r\nis dreadfully forgotten already!]\r\n\r\nKING. \"'Ah, that is pretty!--On what system do you treat your patients?'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'Not on any system.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'But there are some Physicians whose methods you prefer to those\r\nof others?'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'I especially like Tissot's methods, who is a familiar friend of\r\nmine.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'I know M. Tissot. I have read his writings, and value them very\r\nmuch. On the whole, I love the Art of Medicine. My Father wished me to\r\nget some knowledge in it. He often sent me into the Hospitals; and even\r\ninto those for venereal patients, with a view of warning by example.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'And by terrible example!--Sire, Medicine is a very difficult Art.\r\nBut your Majesty is used to bring all Arts under subjection to the force\r\nof your genius, and to conquer all that is difficult.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'Alas, no: I cannot conquer all that is difficult!' [Hard-mouthed\r\nKaunitz, for example; stock-still, with his right ear turned on Turkey:\r\nhow get Kaunitz into step!]--Here the King became reflective; was silent\r\nfor a little moment, and then asked me, with a most bright smile: 'How\r\nmany churchyards have you filled?' [A common question of his to Members\r\nof the Faculty.]\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'Perhaps, in my youth, I have done a little that way! But now it\r\ngoes better; for I am timid rather than bold.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'Very good, very good.'\r\n\r\n\"Our Dialogue now became extremely brisk. The King quickened into\r\nextraordinary vivacity; and examined me now in the character of Doctor,\r\nwith such a stringency as, in the year 1751, at Gottingen, when I\r\nstood for my Degree, the learned Professors Haller, Richter, Segner\r\nand Brendel (for which Heaven recompense them!) never dreamed of! All\r\ninflammatory fevers, and the most important of the slow diseases, the\r\nKing mustered with me, in their order. He asked me, How and whereby I\r\nrecognized each of these diseases; how and whereby distinguished them\r\nfrom the approximate maladies; what my procedure was in simple and\r\nin complicated cases; and how I cured all those disorders? On\r\nthe varieties, the accidents, the mode of treatment, of small-pox\r\nespecially, the King inquired with peculiar strictness;--and spoke, with\r\nmuch emotion, of that young Prince of his House who was carried off,\r\nsome years ago, by that disorder--[suddenly arrested by it, while on\r\nmarch with his regiment, \"near Ruppin, 26th May, 1767.\" This is the\r\nPrince Henri, junior Brother of the subsequent King, Friedrich Wilhelm\r\nII., who, among other fooleries, invaded France, in 1792, with such\r\nsuccess. Both Henri and he, as boys, used to be familiar to us in\r\nthe final winters of the late War. Poor Henri had died at the age of\r\nnineteen,--as yet all brightness, amiability and nothing else: Friedrich\r\nsent an ELOGE of him to his ACADEMIE, [In _OEuvres de Frederic,_ vii. 37\r\net seq.] which is touchingly and strangely filled with authentic sorrow\r\nfor this young Nephew of his, but otherwise empty,--a mere bottle of\r\nsighs and tears]. Then he came upon Inoculation; went along over an\r\nincredible multitude of other medical subjects. Into all he threw\r\nmasterly glances; spoke of all with the soundest [all in superlative]\r\nknowledge of the matter, and with no less penetration than liveliness\r\nand sense.\r\n\r\n\"With heartfelt satisfaction, and with the freest soul, I made my\r\nanswers to his Majesty. It is true, he potently supported and\r\nencouraged me. Ever and anon his Majesty was saying to me: 'That is\r\nvery good;--that is excellently thought and expressed;--your mode of\r\nproceeding, altogether, pleases me very well;--I rejoice to see how much\r\nour ways of thinking correspond.' Often, too, he had the graciousness to\r\nadd: 'But, I weary you with my many questions!' His scientific questions\r\nI answered with simplicity, clearness and brevity; and could not forbear\r\nsometimes expressing my astonishment at the deep and conclusive (TIEFEN\r\nUND FRAPPANTEN) medical insights and judgments of the King.\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty came now upon the history of his own maladies. He told me\r\nthem over, in their series; and asked my opinion and advice about each.\r\nOn the HAEMORRHOIDS, which he greatly complained of, I said something\r\nthat struck him. Instantly he started up in his bed; turned his head\r\nround towards the wall, and said: 'Schmucker, write me that down!'\r\nI started in fright at this word; and not without reason! Then our\r\nColloquy proceeded:--\r\n\r\nKING. \"'The Gout likes to take up his quarters with me; he knows I am\r\na Prince, and thinks I shall feed him well. But I feed him ill; I live\r\nvery meagrely.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'May Gout, thereby get disgusted, and forbear ever calling on your\r\nMajesty!'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'I am grown old. Diseases will no longer have pity on me.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'Europe feels that your Majesty is not old; and your Majesty's\r\nlook (PHYSIOGNOMIE) shows that you have still the same force as in your\r\nthirtieth year.'\r\n\r\nKING (laughing and shaking his head). \"'Well, well, well!'\r\n\r\n\"In this way, for an hour and quarter, with uninterrupted vivacity, the\r\nDialogue went on. At last the King gave me the sign to go; lifting his\r\nhat very kindly, and saying: 'Adieu, my dear M. Zimmermann; I am very\r\nglad to have seen you.'\"\r\n\r\nTowards 6 P.M. now, and Friedrich must sign his Despatches; have his\r\nConcert, have his reading; then to supper (as spectator only),--with\r\nQuintus Icilius and old Lord Marischal, to-night, or whom? [Of Icilius,\r\nand a quarrel and estrangement there had lately been, now happily\r\nreconciled, see Nicolai, _Anekdoten,_ vi. 140-142.]\r\n\r\n\"Herr von Catt accompanied me into the anteroom, and Schmucker followed.\r\nI could not stir from the spot; could not speak, was so charmed and so\r\ntouched, that I broke into a stream of tears [being very weak of nerves\r\nat the time!]. Herr von Catt said: 'I am now going back to the King; go\r\nyou into the room where I took you up; about eight I will conduct you\r\nhome.' I pressed my excellent countryman's hand, I\"--\"Schmucker said, I\r\nhad stood too near his Majesty; I had spoken too frankly, with too much\r\nvivacity; nay, what was unheard of in the world, I had 'gesticulated'\r\nbefore his Majesty! 'In presence of a King,' said Herr Schmucker, 'one\r\nmust stand stiff and not stir.' De Catt came back to us at eight; and,\r\nin Schmucker's presence [let him chew the cud of that!], reported the\r\nfollowing little Dialogue with the King:--\r\n\r\nKING. \"'What says Zimmermann?'\r\n\r\nDE CATT. \"'Zimmermann, at the door of your Majesty's room, burst into a\r\nstream of tears.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'I love those tender affectionate hearts; I love right well those\r\nbrave Swiss people!'\r\n\r\n\"Next morning the King was heard to say: 'I have found Zimmermann\r\nquite what you described him.'--Catt assured me furthermore, 'Since the\r\nSeven-Years War there had thousands of strangers, persons of rank, come\r\nto Potsdam, wishing to speak with the King, and had not attained that\r\nfavor; and of those who had, there could not one individual boast that\r\nhis Majesty had talked with him an hour and quarter at once.' [Fourteen\r\nyears hence, he dismissed Mirabeau in half an hour; which was itself a\r\ngood allowance.]\r\n\r\n\"Sunday 27th, I left Potsdam, with my kind Meckels, in an enthusiasm\r\nof admiration, astonishment, love and gratitude; wrote to the King from\r\nBerlin, sent him a Tissot's Book (marked on the margins for Majesty's\r\nuse), which he acknowledged by some word to Catt: whereupon\r\nI\"--In short, I got home to Hanover, in a more or less seraphic\r\ncondition,--\"with indescribable, unspeakable,\" what not,--early in\r\nNovember; and, as a healed man, never more troubled with that disorder,\r\nthough still troubled with many and many, endeavored to get a little\r\nwork out of myself again. [Zimmermann, _Meine Unterredungen_ (Dialogues)\r\n_with Friedrich the Great_ (8vo, Leipzig, 1788), pp. 305-326.]\r\n\r\n\"Zimmermann was tall, handsome of shape; his exterior was distinguished\r\nand imposing,\" says Jordens. [Ubi supra, p. 643.] \"He had a firm and\r\nlight step; stood gracefully; presented himself well. He had a fine\r\nhead; his voice was agreeable; and intellect sparkled in his eyes:\"--had\r\nit not been for those dreadful hypochondrias, and confused disasters, a\r\nvery pretty man. At the time of this first visit to Friedrich he is 43\r\nyears of age, and Friedrich is on the borders of 60. Zimmermann, with\r\nstill more famous DIALOGUES, will reappear on us from Hanover, on a sad\r\noccasion! Meanwhile, few weeks after him, here is a Visit of far more\r\njoyful kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSISTER ULRIQUE, QUEEN-DOWAGER OF SWEDEN, REVISITS HER NATIVE PLACE\r\n(December, 1771-August, 1772).\r\n\r\nPrince Henri was hardly home from Petersburg and the Swedish Visit, when\r\npoor Adolf Friedrich, King of Sweden, died. [12th February, 1771.] A\r\nvery great and sad event to his Queen, who had loved her old man; and\r\nis now left solitary, eclipsed, in circumstances greatly altered on the\r\nsudden. In regard to settlements, Accession of the new Prince,\r\ndowager revenues and the like, all went right enough; which was some\r\nalleviation, though an inconsiderable, to the sorrowing Widow. Her two\r\nPrinces were absent, touring over Europe, when their Father died, and\r\nthe elder of them, Karl Gustav, suddenly saw himself King. They were\r\nin no breathless haste to return; visited their Uncle, their Prussian\r\nkindred, on the way, and had an interesting week at Potsdam and Berlin;\r\n[April 22d-29th: Rodenbeck, iii. 45.] Karl Gustav flying diligently\r\nabout, still incognito, as \"Graf von Gothland,\"--a spirited young\r\nfellow, perhaps too spirited;--and did not reach home till May-day was\r\ncome, and the outburst of the Swedish Summer at hand.\r\n\r\nSome think the young King had already something dangerous and serious in\r\nview, and wished his Mother out of the way for a time. Certain it is she\r\ndecided on a visit to her native Country in December following: arrived\r\naccordingly, December 2d, 1771; and till the middle of August next was a\r\nshining phenomenon in the Royal House and upper ranks of Berlin Society,\r\nand a touching and interesting one to the busy Friedrich himself, as may\r\nbe supposed. She had her own Apartments and Household at Berlin, in the\r\nPalace there, I think; but went much visiting about, and receiving many\r\nvisits,--fond especially of literary people.\r\n\r\nFriedrich's notices of her are frequent in his Letters of the time,\r\nall affectionate, natural and reasonable. Here are the first two I meet\r\nwith: TO THE ELECTRESS OF SAXONY (three weeks after Ulrique's arrival);\r\n\"A thousand excuses, Madam, for not answering sooner! What will plead\r\nfor me with a Princess who so well knows the duties of friendship, is,\r\nthat I have been occupied with the reception of a Sister, who has come\r\nto seek consolation in the bosom of her kindred for the loss of a loved\r\nHusband, the remembrance of whom saddens and afflicts her.\" And again,\r\ntwo months later: \"... Your Royal Highness deigns to take so obliging\r\nan interest in the visit I have had [and still have] from the Queen of\r\nSweden. I beheld her as if raised from the dead to me; for an absence\r\nof eight-and-twenty years, in the short space of our duration, is almost\r\nequivalent to death. She arrived among us, still in great affliction\r\nfor the loss she had had of the King; and I tried to distract her sad\r\nthoughts by all the dissipations possible. It is only by dint of such\r\nthat one compels the mind to shift away from the fatal idea where grief\r\nhas fixed it: this is not the work of a day, but of time, which in the\r\nend succeeds in everything. I congratulate your Royal Highness on your\r\nJourney to Bavaria [on a somewhat similar errand, we may politely say];\r\nwhere you will find yourself in the bosom of a Family that adores you:\"\r\nafter which, and the sight of old scenes, how pleasant to go on to\r\nItaly, as you propose! [_OEuvres de Frederic,_ xxiv. 230, 235. \"24th\r\nDecember 1771,\" \"February, 1772.\" See also, _\"Eptire a la Reine\r\nDouairiere de Suede\"_ (Poem on the Troubles she has had: _OEuvres de\r\nFrederic,_ xiii. 74, \"written in December, 1770\"), and _\"Vers a la Reine\r\nde Suede,\"_ \"January, 1771\" (ib. 79).]\r\n\r\nQueen Ulrique--a solid and ingenuous character (in childhood a\r\nfavorite of her Father's, so rational, truthful and of silent staid\r\nways)--appears to have been popular in the Berlin circles; pleasant and\r\npleased, during these eight months. Formey, especially Thiebault, are\r\ncopious on this Visit of hers; and give a number of insipid Anecdotes;\r\nHow there was solemn Session of the Academy made for her, a Paper of\r\nthe King's to be read there, [\"DISCOURS DE L'UTILITE DES SCIENCES ET\r\nDES ARTS DAM UN ETAT\" (in _OEuvres de Frederic,_ ix. 169 et seq.): read\r\n\"27th January, 1772.\" Formey, ii. 16, &c. &c.]--reading beautifully done\r\nby me, Thiebault (one of my main functions, this of reading the King's\r\nAcademy Papers, and my dates of THEM always correct); how Thiebault was\r\ninvited to dinner in consequence, and again invited; how Formey dined\r\nwith her Majesty \"twenty-five times;\" and \"preached to her in the\r\nPalace, August 19th\" (should be August 9th): insipid wholly, vapid and\r\nstupid; descriptive of nothing, except of the vapidities and vanities\r\nof certain persons. Leaving these, we will take an Excerpt, probably our\r\nlast, from authentic Busching, which is at least to be depended on for\r\nperfect accuracy, and has a feature or two of portraiture.\r\n\r\nBusching, for the last five or six years, is home from Russia;\r\ncomfortably established here as Consistorialrath, much concerned with\r\nSchool-Superintendence; still more with GEOGRAPHY, with copious rugged\r\nLiterature of the undigested kind: a man well seen in society; has \"six\r\nfamilies of rank which invite him to dinner;\" all the dining he is equal\r\nto, with so much undigested writing on his hands. Busching, in his\r\nfinal Section, headed BERLIN LIFE, Section more incondite even than its\r\nforegoers, has this passage:--\r\n\r\n\"On the Queen-Dowager of Sweden, Louise Ulrique's, coming to Berlin, I\r\nfelt not a little embarrassed. The case was this: Most part of the SIXTH\r\nVOLUME of my MAGAZINE [meritorious curious Book, sometimes quoted by us\r\nhere, not yet known in English Libraries] was printed; and in it, in the\r\nprinted part, were various things that concerned the deceased Sovereign,\r\nKing Adolf Friedrich, and his Spouse [now come to visit us],--and\r\namong these were Articles which the then ruling party in Sweden could\r\ncertainly not like. And now I was afraid these people would come upon\r\nthe false notion, that it was from the Queen-Dowager I had got the\r\nArticles in question;--notion altogether false, as they had been\r\nfurnished me by Baron Korf [well known to Hordt and others of us, at\r\nPetersburg, in the Czar-Peter time], now Russian Minister at Copenhagen.\r\nHowever, when Duke Friedrich of Brunswick [one of the juniors,\r\nsoldiering here with his Uncle, as they almost all are] wrote to me, one\r\nday, That his Lady Aunt the Queen of Sweden invited me to dine with her\r\nto-morrow, and that he, the Duke, would introduce me,--I at once decided\r\nto lay my embarrassment before the Queen herself.\r\n\r\n\"Next day, when I was presented to her Majesty, she took me by the hand,\r\nand led me to a window [as was her custom with guests whom she judged to\r\nbe worth questioning and talking to], and so placed herself in a corner\r\nthere that I came to stand close before her; when she did me the\r\nhonor to ask a great many questions about Russia, the Imperial Court\r\nespecially, and most of all the Grand-Duke [Czar Paul that is to be,--a\r\nkind of kinsman he, his poor Father was my late Husband's Cousin-german,\r\nas perhaps you know]. A great deal of time was spent in this way; so\r\nthat the Princes and Princesses, punctual to invitation, had to wait\r\nabove half an hour long; and the Queen was more than once informed that\r\ndinner was on the table and getting cold. I could get nothing of my own\r\nmentioned here; all I could do was to draw back, in a polite way, so\r\nsoon as the Queen would permit: and afterwards, at table, to explain\r\nwith brevity my concern about what was printed in the MAGAZINE; and\r\nrequest the Queen to permit me to send it her to read for herself. She\r\nhad it, accordingly, that same afternoon.\r\n\r\n\"A few days after, she invited me again; again spoke with me a long\r\nwhile in the window embrasure, in a low tone of voice: confirmed to\r\nme all that she had read,--and in particular, minutely explained that\r\nLETTER OF THE KING [one of my Pieces] in which he relates what passed\r\nbetween him and Count Tessin [Son's Tutor] in the Queen's Apartment. At\r\ntable, she very soon took occasion to say: 'I cannot imagine to myself\r\nhow the Herr Consistorialrath [Busching, to wit] has come upon that\r\nLetter of my deceased Lord the King of Sweden's; which his Majesty did\r\nwrite, and which is now printed in your MAGAZINE. For certain, the King\r\nshowed it to nobody.' Whereupon BUSCHING: 'Certainly; nor is that to\r\nbe imagined, your Majesty. But the person it was addressed to must\r\nhave shown it; and so a copy of it has come to my hands.' Queen still\r\nexpresses her wonder; whereupon again, Busching, with a courageous\r\ncandor: 'Your Majesty, most graciously permit me to say, that hitherto\r\nall Swedish secrets of Court or State have been procurable for money and\r\ngood words!' The Queen, to whom I sat directly opposite, cast down her\r\neyes at these words and smiled;--and the Reichsrath Graf von Schwerin [a\r\nSwedish Gentleman of hers], who sat at my left, seized me by the\r\nhand, and said: 'Alas, that is true!'\"--Here is a difficulty got\r\nover; Magazine Number can come out when it will. As it did, \"next\r\nEaster-Fair,\" with proper indications and tacit proofs that the Swedish\r\npart of it lay printed several months before the Queen's arrival in our\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nBusching dined with her Majesty several times,--\"eating nothing,\" he is\r\ncareful to mention and was careful to show her Majesty, \"except, very\r\ngradually, a small bit of bread soaked in a glass of wine!\"--meaning\r\nthereby, \"Note, ye great ones, it is not for your dainties; in fact, it\r\nis out of loyal politeness mainly!\" the gloomily humble man.\r\n\r\n\"One time, the Queen asked me, in presence of various Princes and\r\nPrincesses of the Royal House: 'Do you think it advisable to enlighten\r\nthe Lower Classes by education?' To which I answered: 'Considering only\r\nunder what heavy loads a man of the Lower Classes, especially of the\r\nPeasant sort, has to struggle through his life, one would think it was\r\nbetter neither to increase his knowledge nor refine his sensibility. But\r\nwhen one reflects that he, as well as those of the Higher Classes, is to\r\nlast through Eternity; and withal that good instruction may [or might,\r\nIF it be not BAD] increase his practical intelligence, and help him\r\nto methods of alleviating himself in this world, it must be thought\r\nadvisable to give him useful enlightenment.' The Queen accorded with\r\nthis view of the matter.\r\n\r\n\"Twice I dined with her Majesty at her Sister, Princess Amelia, the\r\nAbbess of Quedlinburg's:--and the second time [must have been Summer,\r\n1772], Professor Sulzer, who was also a guest, caught his death there.\r\nWhen I entered the reception-room, Sulzer was standing in the middle of\r\na thorough-draught, which they had managed to have there, on account of\r\nthe great heat; and he had just arrived, all in a perspiration, from\r\nthe Thiergarten: I called him out of the draught, but it was too late.\"\r\n[Busching: _Beitrage,_ vi. 578-582.] ACH, MEIN LIEBER SULZER,--Alas,\r\ndear Sulzer: seriously this time!\r\n\r\nBusching has a great deal to say about Schools, about the \"School\r\nCommission 1765,\" the subjects taught, the methods of teaching devised\r\nby Busching and others, and the King's continual exertions, under\r\ndeficient funds, in this province of his affairs. Busching had\r\nunheard-of difficulty to rebuild the old Gymnasium at Berlin into a new.\r\nTried everybody; tried the King thrice over, but nobody would. \"One of\r\nthe persons I applied to was Lieutenant-General von Ramin, Governor of\r\nBerlin [surliest of mankind, of whose truculent incivility there go\r\nmany anecdotes]; to Ramin I wrote, entreating that he would take a\r\ngood opportunity and suggest a new Town Schoolhouse to his Majesty:\r\n'Excellenz, it will render you immortal in the annals of Berlin!' To\r\nwhich Ramin made answer: 'That is an immortality I must renounce the\r\nhope of, and leave to the Town-Syndics and yourself. I, for my own part,\r\nwill by no means risk such a proposal to his Majesty; which he would,\r\nin all likelihood, answer in the negative, and receive ill at anybody's\r\nhands.'\" [Ib. vi. 568.] By subscriptions, by bequests, donations and the\r\nprivate piety of individuals, Busching aiding and stirring, the thing\r\nwas at last got done. Here is another glance into School-life: not from\r\nBusching:--\r\n\r\nJUNE 9th, 1771. \"This Year the Stande of the Kurmark find they have\r\nan overplus of 100,000 thalers (15,000 pounds); which sum they do\r\nthemselves the pleasure of presenting to the King for his Majesty's\r\nuses.\" King cannot accept it for his own uses. \"This money,\" answers he\r\n(9th June), \"comes from the Province, wherefore I feel bound to lay it\r\nout again for advantage of the Province. Could not it become a means of\r\ngetting English husbandry [TURNIPS in particular, whether short-horns\r\nor not, I do not know] introduced among us? In the Towns that follow\r\nFarming chiefly, or in Villages belonging to unmoneyed Nobles, we will\r\nlend out this 15,000 pounds, at 4 per cent, in convenient sums for\r\nthat object: hereby will turnip-culture and rotation be vouchsafed us;\r\ninterest at 4 per cent brings us in 600 pounds annually; and this we\r\nwill lay out in establishing new Schoolmasters in the Kurmark, and\r\nhaving the youth better educated.\" What a pretty idea; neat and\r\nbeautiful, killing two important birds with one most small stone! I have\r\nknown enormous cannon-balls and granite blocks, torrent after torrent,\r\nshot out under other kinds of Finance-gunnery, that were not only less\r\nrespectable, but that were abominable to me in comparison.\r\n\r\nUnluckily, no Nobles were found inclined; English Husbandry [\"TURNIPSE\"\r\nand the rest of it] had to wait their time. The King again writes: \"No\r\nNobles to be found, say you? Well; put the 15,000 pounds to interest in\r\nthe common way,--that the Schoolmasters at least may have solacement:\r\nI will add 120 thalers (18 pounds) apiece, that we may have a chance\r\nof getting better Schoolmasters;--send me List of the Places where the\r\nworst are.\" List was sent; is still extant; and on the margin of it, in\r\nRoyal Autograph, this remark:--\r\n\r\n\"The Places are well selected. The bad Schoolmasters are mostly Tailors;\r\nand you must see whether they cannot be got removed to little Towns, and\r\nset to tailoring again, or otherwise disposed of, that our Schools might\r\nthe sooner rise into good condition, which is an interesting thing.\"\r\n\"Eager always our Master is to have the Schooling of his People improved\r\nand everywhere diffused,\" writes, some years afterwards, the excellent\r\nZedlitz, officially \"Minister of Public Justice,\" but much and\r\nmeritoriously concerned with School matters as well. The King's ideas\r\nwere of the best, and Zedlitz sometimes had fine hopes; but the want of\r\nfunds was always great.\r\n\r\n\"In 1779,\" says Preuss, \"there came a sad blow to Zedlitz's hopes:\r\nMinister von Brenkenhof [deep in West-Preussen canal-diggings and\r\nexpenditures] having suggested, That instead of getting Pensions, the\r\nOld Soldiers should be put to keeping School.\" Do but fancy it; poor\r\nold fellows, little versed in scholastics hitherto! \"Friedrich, in his\r\npinch, grasped at the small help; wrote to the War-Department: 'Send\r\nme a List of Invalids who are fit [or at least fittest] to be\r\nSchoolmasters.' And got thereupon a list of 74, and afterwards 5\r\nmore [79 Invalids in all]; War-Department adding, That besides these\r\nscholastic sort, there were 741 serving as BUDNER [Turnpike-keepers,\r\nin a sort], as Forest-watchers and the like; and 3,443 UNVERSORGT\"\r\n(shifting for themselves, no provision made for them at all),--such\r\nthe check, by cold arithmetic and inexorable finance, upon the genial\r\ncurrent of the soul!--\r\n\r\nThe TURNIPS, I believe, got gradually in; and Brandenburg, in our\r\nday, is a more and more beautifully farmed Country. Nor were the\r\nSchoolmasters unsuccessful at all points; though I cannot report a\r\ncomplete educational triumph on those extremely limited terms. [Preuss,\r\niii. 115, 113, &c.]\r\n\r\nQueen Ulrique left, I think, on the 9th of August, 1772; there is sad\r\nfarewell in Friedrich's Letter next day to Princess Sophie Albertine,\r\nthe Queen's Daughter, subsequently Abbess of Quedlinburg: he is just\r\nsetting out on his Silesian Reviews; \"shall, too likely, never see your\r\ngood Mamma again.\" [\"Potsdam, 10th August, 1772:\" _OEuvres de Frederic,_\r\nxxvii. ii. 93.] Poor King; Berlin City is sound asleep, while he rushes\r\nthrough it on this errand,--\"past the Princess Amelia's window,\" in the\r\ndead of night; and takes to humming tender strophes to her too; which\r\ngain a new meaning by their date. [\"A MA SOEUR AMELIE, EN PASSANT, LA\r\nNUIT, SOUS SA FENETRE, POUR ALLER EN SILESIE (AOUT 1772):\" _OEuvres de\r\nFrederic,_ xiii. 77.]\r\n\r\nTen days afterwards (19th August, 1772),--Queen Ulrique not yet\r\nhome,--her Son, the spirited King Gustav III., at Stockholm had made\r\nwhat in our day is called a \"stroke of state,\"--put a thorn in the\r\nsnout of his monster of a Senate, namely: \"Less of palaver, venality and\r\ninsolence, from you, Sirs; we 'restore the Constitution of 1680,' and\r\nare something of a King again!\" Done with considerable dexterity and\r\nspirit; not one person killed or hurt. And surely it was the muzzling-up\r\nof a great deal of folly on their side,--provided only there came wisdom\r\nenough from Gustav himself instead. But, alas, there did not, there\r\nhardly could. His Uncle was alarmed, and not a little angry for the\r\nmoment: \"You had two Parties to reconcile; a work of time, of patient\r\nendeavor, continual and quiet; no good possible till then. And instead\r\nof that--!\" Gustav, a shining kind of man, showed no want of spirit, now\r\nor afterwards: but he leant too much on France and broken reeds;--and,\r\nin the end, got shot in the back by one of those beautiful \"Nobles\"\r\nof his, and came to a bad conclusion, they and he. [\"16th-29th March,\r\n1792,\" death of Gustav III. by that assassination: \"13th March, 1809,\"\r\nhis Son Gustav IV, has to go on his travels; \"Karl XIII.,\" a childless\r\nUncle, succeeds for a few years: after whom &c.] Scandinavian Politics,\r\nthank Heaven, are none of our business.\r\n\r\nQueen Ulrique was spared all these catastrophes. She had alarmed her\r\nBrother by a dangerous illness, sudden and dangerous, in 1775; who\r\nwrites with great anxiety about it, to Another still more anxious: [See\r\n\"Correspondence with Gustav III.\" (in _OEuvres de Frederic,_ xxvii. ii.\r\n84, &c.).] of this she got well again; but it did not last very long.\r\nJuly 16th, 1782, she died;--and the sad Friedrich had to say, Adieu.\r\nAlas, \"must the eldest of us mourn, then, by the grave of those\r\nyounger!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILHELMINA'S DAUGHTER, ELIZABETH FREDERIKE SOPHIE, DUCHESS OF\r\nWURTEMBERG, APPEARS AT FERNEY (September, 1773).\r\n\r\nOf our dear Wilhelmina's high and unfortunate Daughter there should be\r\nsome Biography; and there will surely, if a man of sympathy and faculty\r\npass that way; but there is not hitherto. Nothing hitherto but a few\r\nbare dates; bare and sternly significant, as on a Tombstone; indicating\r\nthat she had a History, and that it was a tragic one. Welcome to all of\r\nus, in this state of matters, is the following one clear emergence of\r\nher into the light of day, and in company so interesting too! Seven\r\nyears before her death she had gone to Lausanne (July, 1773) to consult\r\nTissot, a renowned Physician of those days. From Lausanne, after\r\ntwo months, she visited Voltaire at Ferney. Read this Letter of\r\nVoltaire's:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELIZABETH FREDERIKE SOPHIE, DUCHESS OF WURTEMBERG (at Lausanne).\r\n\r\n\"FEENEY, 10th July, 1773.\r\n\r\n\"MADAM,--I am informed that your most Serene Highness has deigned to\r\nremember that I was in the world. It is very sad to be there, without\r\npaying you my court. I never felt so cruelly the sad state to which old\r\nage and maladies have reduced me.\r\n\r\n\"I never saw you except as a child [1743, her age then 10]: but you\r\nwere certainly the beautifulest child in Europe. May you be the happiest\r\nPrincess [alas!], as you deserve to be! I was attached to Madam the\r\nMargravine [your dear Mother] with equal devotedness and respect; and I\r\nhad the honor to be pretty deep in her confidence, for some time\r\nbefore this world, which was not worthy of her, had lost that adorable\r\nPrincess. You resemble her;--but don't resemble her in--feebleness of\r\nhealth! You are in the flower of your age [coming forty, I should fear]:\r\nlet such bright flower lose nothing of its splendor; may your happiness\r\nbe able to equal [PUISSO EGALER] your beauty; may all your days be\r\nserene, and the sweets of friendship add a new charm to them! These are\r\nmy wishes; they are as lively as my regrets at not being at your feet.\r\nWhat a consolation it would be for me to speak of your loving Mother,\r\nand of all your august relatives! Why must Destiny send you to Lausanne\r\n[consulting Dr. Tissot there], and hinder me from flying thither!--Let\r\nyour most Serene Highness deign to accept the profound respect of the\r\nold moribund Philosopher of Ferney.--V.\" [_OEuvres de Voltaire,_ xcii.\r\n331.]\r\n\r\nThe Answer of the Princess, or farther Correspondence on the matter, is\r\nnot given; evident only that by and by, as Voltaire himself will inform\r\nus, she did appear at Ferney;--and a certain Swedish tourist, one\r\nBjornstahl, who met her there, enables us even to give the date. He\r\nreports this anecdote:--\r\n\r\n\"At supper, on the evening of 7th September, 1773, the Princess sat\r\nnext to Voltaire, who always addressed her 'VOTRE ALTESSE.' At last the\r\nDuchess said to him, 'TU ES ANON PAPA, JE SUIS TA FILLE, ET JE VOUZ ETRE\r\nAPPELEE TA FILLE.' Voltaire took a pencil from his pocket, asked for a\r\ncard, and wrote upon it:--\r\n\r\n    'Ah, le beau titre que voila!\r\n     Vous me donnez la premiere des places;\r\n     Quelle famille j'aurais la!\r\n     Je serais le pere des Graces'\r\n    [_OEuvres de Voltaire,_ xviii. 342.]\r\n\r\nHe gave the card to the Princess, who embraced and kissed him for it.\"\r\n[Vehse, _Geschichte der Deutschen Hofe_ (Hamburg, 1853), xxv. 252, 253.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLTAIRE TO FRIEDRICH (a fortnight after).\r\n\r\n\"FERNEY, 22d September, 1773.\r\n\r\n\"I must tell you that I have felt, in these late days, in spite of all\r\nmy past caprices, how much I am attached to your Majesty and to your\r\nHouse. Madam the Duchess of Wurtemberg having had, like so many others,\r\nthe weakness to believe that health is to be found at Lausanne, and that\r\nDr. Tissot gives it if one pay him, has, as you know, made the journey\r\nto Lausanne; and I, who am more veritably ill than she, and than all\r\nthe Princesses who have taken Tissot for an AEsculapius, had not the\r\nstrength to leave my home. Madam of Wurtemberg, apprised of all the\r\nfeelings that still live in me for the memory of Madam the Margravine\r\nof Baireuth her Mother, has deigned to visit my hermitage, and pass two\r\ndays with us. I should have recognized her, even without warning; she\r\nhas the turn of her Mother's face with your eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You Hero-people who govern the world don't allow yourselves to be\r\nsubdued by feelings; you have them all the same as we, but you maintain\r\nyour decorum. We other petty mortals yield to all our impressions: I set\r\nmyself to cry, in speaking to her of you and of Madam the Princess her\r\nMother; and she too, though she is Niece of the first Captain in Europe,\r\ncould not restrain her tears. It appears to me, that she has the talent\r\n(ESPRIT) and the graces of your House; and that especially she is more\r\nattached to you than to her Husband [I should think so!]. She returns, I\r\nbelieve, to Baireuth,--[No Mother, no Father there now: foolish Uncle\r\nof Anspath died long ago, \"3d August, 1757:\" Aunt Dowager of Anspach\r\ngone to Erlangen, I hope, to Feuchtwang, Schwabach or Schwaningen,\r\nor some Widow's-Mansion \"WITTWENSITZ\" of her own; [Lived, finally at\r\nSchwaningen, in sight of such vicissitudes and follies round her, till\r\n\"4th February, 1784\" (Rodenbeck, iii. 304).] reigning Son, with his\r\nFrench-Actress equipments, being of questionable figure],--\r\n\r\n--\"returns, I believe, to Baireuth; where she will find another Princess\r\nof a different sort; I mean Mademoiselle Clairon, who cultivates\r\nNatural History, and is Lady Philosopher to Monseigneur the\r\nMargraf,\"--high-rouged Tragedy-Queen, rather tyrannous upon him, they\r\nsay: a young man destined to adorn Hammersmith by and by, and not go a\r\ngood road.\r\n\r\n... \"I renounce my beautiful hopes of seeing the Mahometans driven out\r\nof Europe, and Athens become again the Seat of the Muses. Neither you\r\nnor the Kaiser are\"--are inclined in the Crusading way at all.... \"The\r\nold sick man of Ferney is always at the feet of your Majesty; he feels\r\nvery sorry that he cannot talk of you farther with Madam the Duchess of\r\nWurtemberg, who adores you.--LE VIEUX MALADE.\" [_OEuvres de Voltaire,_\r\nxcii. 390.]\r\n\r\nTo which Friedrich makes answer: \"If it is forevermore forbidden me to\r\nsee you again, I am not the less glad that the Duchess of Wurtemberg has\r\nseen you. I should certainly have mixed my tears with yours, had I been\r\npresent at that touching scene! Be it weakness, be it excess of regard,\r\nI have built for her lost Mother, what Cicero projected for his Tullia,\r\na TEMPLE OF FRIENDSHIP: her Statue occupies the background, and on each\r\npillar stands a mask (MASCARON) containing the Bust of some Hero in\r\nFriendship: I send you the drawing of it.\" [\"Potsdam, 24th October,\r\n1773:\" _OEuvres de Frederic,_ xxiii. 259:--\"Temple\" was built in 1768\r\n(Ib. p. 259 n.).] Which again sets Voltaire weeping, and will the\r\nDuchess when she sees it. [Voltaire's next Letter: _OEuvres de\r\nVoltaire,_ xcii. 434.]\r\n\r\nWe said there hitherto was nearly nothing anywhere discoverable as\r\nHistory of this high Lady but the dates only; these we now give. She was\r\n\"born 30th August, 1732,\"--her Mother's and Father's one Child;--four\r\nyears older than her Anspach Cousin, who inherited Baireuth too, and\r\nfinished off that genealogy. She was \"wedded 26th September, 1748;\" her\r\nage then about 16; her gloomy Duke of Wurtemberg, age 20, all sunshine\r\nand goodness to her then: she was \"divorced in 1757:\" \"died 6th April,\r\n1780,\"--Tradition says, \"in great poverty [great for her rank,\r\nI suppose, proud as she might be, and above complaining],--at\r\nNeustadt-on-the-Aisch\" (in the Nurnberg region), whither she had\r\nretired, I know not how long after her Papa's death and Cousin's\r\naccession. She is bound for her Cousin's Court, we observe, just now;\r\nand, considering her Cousin's ways and her own turn of mind, it is easy\r\nto fancy she had not a pleasant time there.\r\n\r\nTradition tells us, credibly enough, \"She was very like her Mother:\r\nbeautiful, much the lady (VON FEINEM TON), and of energetic character;\"\r\nand adds, probably on slight foundation, \"but very cold and proud\r\ntowards the people.\" [Vehse, xxv. 251.] Many Books will inform you how,\r\n\"On first entering Stuttgard, when the reigning Duke and she were met\r\nby a party of congratulatory peasant women dressed in their national\r\ncostume, she said to her Duke,\" being then only sixteen, poor young\r\nsoul, and on her marriage-journey, \"'WAS WILL DAS GESCHMEISS (Why does\r\nthat rabble bore us)!'\" This is probably the main foundation. That \"her\r\nLadies, on approaching her, had always to kiss the hem of her gown,\" lay\r\nin the nature of the case, being then the rule to people of her rank.\r\nBeautiful Unfortunate, adieu:--and be Voltaire thanked, too!--\r\n\r\nIt is long since we have seen Voltaire before:--a prosperous Lord at\r\nFerney these dozen years (\"the only man in France that lives like a\r\nGRAND SEIGNEUR,\" says Cardinal Bernis to him once [Their CORRESPONDENCE,\r\nreally pretty of its kind, used to circulate as a separate Volume in the\r\nyears then subsequent.]); doing great things for the Pays de Gex and\r\nfor France, and for Europe; delivering the Calases, the Sirvens and the\r\nOppressed of various kinds; especially ardent upon the INFAME, as the\r\nreal business Heaven has assigned him in his Day, the sunset of\r\nwhich, and Night wherein no man can work, he feels to be hastening on.\r\n\"Couldn't we, the few Faithful, go to Cleve in a body?\" thinks he at one\r\ntime: \"To Cleve; and there, as from a safe place, under the Philosopher\r\nKing, shoot out our fiery artilleries with effect?\" The Philosopher King\r\nis perfectly willing, \"provided you don't involve me in Wars with\r\nmy neighbors.\" Willing enough he; but they the Faithful--alas, the\r\nPatriarch finds that they have none of his own heroic ardor, and that\r\nthe thing cannot be done. Upon which, \"struck with sorrow,\" say his\r\nBiographers, \"he writes nothing to Friedrich for two years.\" [\"Nov.\r\n1769,\" recommences (_OEuvres de Frederic,_ xxiii. 140. 139).]\r\n\r\nThe truth is, he is growing very old; and though a piercing radiance, as\r\nof stars, bursts occasionally from the central part of him, the outworks\r\nare getting decayed and dim; obstruction more and more accumulating, and\r\nthe immeasurable Night drawing nigh. Well does Voltaire himself, at all\r\nmoments, know this; and his bearing under it, one must say, is rather\r\nbeautiful. There is a tenderness, a sadness, in these his later Letters\r\nto Friedrich; instead of emphasis or strength, a beautiful shrill\r\nmelody, as of a woman, as of a child; he grieves unappeasably to have\r\nlost Friedrich; never will forgive Maupertuis:--poor old man! Friedrich\r\nanswers in a much livelier, more robust tone: friendly, encouraging,\r\ncommunicative on small matters;--full of praises,--in fact, sincerely\r\nglad to have such a transcendent genius still alive with him in\r\nthis world. Praises to the most liberal pitch everything of\r\nVoltaire's,--except only the Article on WAR, which occasionally (as\r\nbelow) he quizzes a little, to the Patriarch or his Disciple.\r\n\r\n As we have room for nothing of all this, and perhaps shall not see\r\nVoltaire again,--there are Two actual Interviews with him, which, being\r\nwithal by Englishmen, though otherwise not good for much, we intend for\r\nreaders here. In these last twenty years D'Alembert is Friedrich's chief\r\nCorrespondent. Of D'Alembert to the King, it may be or may not, some\r\nopportunity will rise for a specimen; meanwhile here is a short Letter\r\nof the King's to D'Alembert, through which there pass so many threads of\r\ncontemporaneous flying events (swift shuttles on the loud-sounding Loom\r\nof Time), that we are tempted to give this, before the two Interviews in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nDate of the Letter is two months after that apparition of the Duchess of\r\nWurtemberg at Ferney. Of \"Crillon,\" an ingenious enough young Soldier,\r\nrushing ardently about the world in his holiday time, we have nothing to\r\nsay, except that he is Son of that Rossbach Crillon, who always fancies\r\nto himself that once he perhaps spared Friedrich's life (by a glass of\r\nwine judiciously given) long since, while the Bridge of Weissenfels was\r\non fire, and Rossbach close ahead. [Supra, x. 6.] Colonel \"Guibert\"\r\nis another Soldier, still young, but of much superior type; greatly an\r\nadmirer of Friedrich, and subsequently a Writer upon him. [Of Guibert's\r\nvisit to Friedrich (June, 1773), see Preuss, iv. 214; Rodenbeck, iii.\r\n80.]\r\n\r\nIn regard to the \"Landgravine of Darmstadt,\" notice these points.\r\nFirst, that her eldest Daughter is Wife, second Wife, to the\r\ndissolute Crown-Prince of Prussia; and then, that she has Three other\r\nDaughters,--one of whom has just been disposed of in an important way;\r\nwedded to the Czarowitsh Paul of Russia, namely. By Friedrich's means\r\nand management, as Friedrich informs us. [_OEuvres de Frederic,_\r\n(MEMOIRES DE 1763 JUSQU'A 1775), vi. 57.] The Czarina, he says, had sent\r\nout a confidential Gentleman, one Asseburg, who was Prussian by birth,\r\nto seek a fit Wife for her Son: Friedrich, hearing of this, suggested\r\nto Asseburg, \"The Landgravine of Darmstadt, the most distinguished and\r\naccomplished of German Princesses, has three marriageable Daughters; her\r\neldest, married to our Crown-Prince, will be Queen of Prussia in time\r\ncoming;--suppose now, one of the others were to be Czarina of Russia\r\nwithal? Think, might it not be useful both to your native Country and to\r\nyour adopted?\" Asseburg took the hint; reported at Petersburg, That of\r\nall marriageable Princesses in Germany, the Three of Darmstadt, one\r\nor the other of them, would, in his humble opinion, be the eligiblest.\r\n\"Could not we persuade you to come to Petersburg, Madam Landgravine?\"\r\nwrote the Czarina thereupon: \"Do us the honor of a visit, your three\r\nPrincesses and you!\" The Landgravine and Daughters, with decent\r\ncelerity, got under way; [Passed through Berlin 16th-19th May, 1773:\r\nRodenbeck, iii. 78.] Czarowitsh Paul took interesting survey, on\r\ntheir arrival; and about two months ago wedded the middle one of the\r\nthree:--and here is the victorious Landgravine bringing home the other\r\ntwo. Czarowitsh's fair one did not live long, nor behave well: died of\r\nher first child; and Czarowitsh, in 1776, had to apply to us again for\r\na Wife, whom this time we fitted better. Happily, the poor victorious\r\nLandgravine was gone before anything of this; she died suddenly five\r\nmonths hence; [30th March, 1774.] nothing doubting of her Russian\r\nAdventure. She was an admired Princess of her time, DIE GROSSE\r\nLANDGRAFIN, as Goethe somewhere calls her; much in Friedrich's\r\nesteem,--FEMINA SEXU, INGENIO VIR, as the Monument he raised to her\r\nat Darmstadt still bears. [_OEuvres de Frederic,_ xx. 183 n. His\r\nCORRESPONDENCE with her is Ib. xxvii ii. 135-153; and goes from 1757 to\r\n1774.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH TO D'ALEMBERT.\r\n\r\n\"POTSDAM, 16th December, 1773.\r\n\r\n\"M. de Crillon delivered me your CRILLONADE [lengthy Letter of\r\nintroduction]; which has completed me in the History of all the Crillons\r\nof the County of Avignon. He does n't stop here; he is soon to be off\r\nfor Russia; so that I will take him on your word, and believe him the\r\nwisest of all the Crillons: assuring myself that you have measured and\r\ncomputed all his curves, and angles of incidence. He will find Diderot\r\nand Grimm in Russia [famous visit of Diderot], all occupied with the\r\nCzarina's beautiful reception of them, and with the many things worthy\r\nof admiration which they have seen there. Some say Grimm will possibly\r\nfix himself in that Country [chose better],--which will be the asylum at\r\nonce of your fanatic CHAUMEIXES and of the ENCYCLOPEDISTES, whom he used\r\nto denounce. [This poor Chaumeix did, after such feats, \"die peaceably\r\nat Moscow, as a Schoolmaster.\"]\r\n\r\n\"M. de Guibert has gone by Ferney; where it is said Voltaire has\r\nconverted him, that is, has made him renounce the errors of ambition,\r\nabjure the frightful trade of hired manslayer, with intent to become\r\neither Capuchin or Philosophe; so that I suppose by this time he will\r\nhave published a 'Declaration' like Gresset, informing the public That,\r\nhaving had the misfortune to write a Work on Tactics, he repented it\r\nfrom the bottom of his soul, and hereby assured mankind that never more\r\nin his life would he give rules for butcheries, assassinations, feints,\r\nstratagems or the like abominations. As to me, my conversion not being\r\nyet in an advanced stage, I pray you to give me details about Guibert's,\r\nto soften my heart and penetrate my bowels.\r\n\r\n\"We have the Landgravine of Darmstadt here: [Rodenbeck, iii. 89, 90.]\r\nno end to the Landgravine's praises of a magnificent Czarina, and of all\r\nthe beautiful and grand things she has founded in that Country. As to\r\nus, who live like mice in their holes, news come to us only from mouth\r\nto mouth, and the sense of hearing is nothing like that of sight.\r\nI cherish my wishes, in the mean while, for the sage Anaxagoras [my\r\nD'Alembert himself]; and I say to Urania, 'It is for thee to sustain thy\r\nforemost Apostle, to maintain one light, without which a great Kingdom\r\n[France] would sink into darkness;' and I say to the Supreme Demiurgus:\r\n'Have always the good D'Alembert in thy holy and worthy keeping.'--F.\"\r\n[_OEuvres de Frederic,_ xxiv. 614.]\r\n\r\nTHE BOSTON TEA (same day). Curious to remark, while Friedrich is writing\r\nthis Letter, \"THURSDAY, DECEMBER 16th, 1773,\" what a commotion is\r\ngoing on, far over seas, at Boston, New England,--in the \"Old South\r\nMeeting-house\" there; in regard to three English Tea Ships that are\r\nlying embargoed in Griffin's Wharf for above a fortnight past. The case\r\nis well known, and still memorable to mankind. British Parliament,\r\nafter nine years of the saddest haggling and baffling to and fro, under\r\nConstitutional stress of weather, and such east-winds and west-winds\r\nof Parliamentary eloquence as seldom were, has made up its mind, That\r\nAmerica shall pay duty on these Teas before infusing them: and America,\r\nBoston more especially, is tacitly determined that it will not; and\r\nthat, to avoid mistakes, these Teas shall never be landed at all. Such\r\nis Boston's private intention, more or less fixed;--to say nothing of\r\nthe Philadelphias, Charlestons, New Yorks, who are watching Boston, and\r\nwill follow suit of it.\r\n\r\n\"Sunday, November 26th,--that is, nineteen days ago,--the first of\r\nthese Tea Ships, the DARTMOUTH, Captain Hall, moored itself in Griffin's\r\nWharf: Owner and Consignee is a broad-brimmed Boston gentleman called\r\nRotch, more attentive to profits of trade than to the groans of\r\nBoston:--but already on that Sunday, much more on the Monday following,\r\nthere had a meeting of Citizens run together,--(on Monday, Faneuil Hall\r\nwon't hold them, and they adjourn to the Old South Meeting-house),--who\r\nmake it apparent to Rotch that it will much behoove him, for the sake\r\nboth of tea and skin, not to 'enter' (or officially announce) this\r\nShip DARTMOUTH at the Custom-house in any wise; but to pledge his\r\nbroad-brimmed word, equivalent to his oath, that she shall lie dormant\r\nthere in Griffin's Wharf, till we see. Which, accordingly, she has\r\nbeen doing ever since; she and two others that arrived some days later;\r\ndormant all three of them, side by side, three crews totally idle; a\r\n'Committee of Ten' supervising Rotch's procedures; and the Boston world\r\nmuch expectant. Thursday, December 16th: this is the 20th day since\r\nRotch's DARTMOUTH arrived here; if not 'entered' at Custom-house in the\r\ncourse of this day, Custom-house cannot give her a 'clearance' either\r\n(a leave to depart),--she becomes a smuggler, an outlaw, and her fate is\r\nmysterious to Rotch and us.\r\n\r\n\"This Thursday accordingly, by 10 in the morning, in the Old South\r\nMeeting-house, Boston is assembled, and country-people to the number of\r\n2,000;--and Rotch never was in such a company of human Friends before.\r\nThey are not uncivil to him (cautious people, heedful of the verge of\r\nthe Law); but they are peremptory, to the extent of--Rotch may shudder\r\nto think what. \"I went to the Custom-house yesterday,' said Rotch, 'your\r\nCommittee of Ten can bear me witness; and demanded clearance and leave\r\nto depart; but they would not; were forbidden, they said!' 'Go, then,\r\nsir; get you to the Governor himself; a clearance, and out of harbor\r\nthis day: had n't you better?' Rotch is well aware that he had; hastens\r\noff to the Governor (who has vanished to his Country-house, on purpose);\r\nOld South Meeting-house adjourning till 3 P.M., for Rotch's return with\r\nclearance.\r\n\r\n\"At 3 no Rotch, nor at 4, nor at 5; miscellaneous plangent intermittent\r\nspeech instead, mostly plangent, in tone sorrowful rather than\r\nindignant:--at a quarter to 6, here at length is Rotch; sun is long\r\nsince set,--has Rotch a clearance or not? Rotch reports at large,\r\nwilling to be questioned and cross-questioned: 'Governor absolutely\r\nwould not! My Christian friends, what could I or can I do?' There are\r\nby this time about 7,000 people in Old South Meeting-house, very few\r\ntallow-lights in comparison,--almost no lights for the mind either,--and\r\nit is difficult to answer. Rotch's report done, the Chairman [one Adams,\r\n\"American Cato,\" subsequently so called] dissolves the sorrowful 7,000,\r\nwith these words: 'This Meeting declares that it can do nothing more to\r\nsave the Country.' Will merely go home, then, and weep. Hark, however:\r\nalmost on the instant, in front of Old South Meeting-house, (a terrific\r\nWar-whoop; and about fifty Mohawk Indians,)--with whom Adams seems to be\r\nacquainted; and speaks without Interpreter: Aha?--\r\n\r\n\"And, sure enough, before the stroke of 7, these fifty painted Mohawks\r\nare forward, without noise, to Griffin's Wharf; have put sentries all\r\nround there; and, in a great silence of the neighborhood, are busy,\r\nin three gangs, upon the dormant Tea Ships; opening their chests, and\r\npunctually shaking them out into the sea. 'Listening from the distance,\r\nyou could hear distinctly the ripping open of the chests, and no other\r\nsound.' About 10 P.M. all was finished: 342 chests of tea flung out to\r\ninfuse in the Atlantic; the fifty Mohawks gone like a dream; and Boston\r\nsleeping more silently even than usual.\" [\"Summary of the Advices from\r\nAmerica\" (in _Gentleman's Magazine_ for 1774, pp. 26, 27); Bancroft,\r\niii. 536 et seq.]\r\n\r\n\"Seven in the evening:\" this, I calculate, allowing for the Earth's\r\nrotation, will be about the time when Friedrich, well tired with the\r\nday's business, is getting to bed; by 10 on the Boston clocks, when the\r\nprocess finishes there, Friedrich will have had the best of his sleep\r\nover. Here is Montcalm's Prophecy coming to fulfilment;--and a curious\r\nintersection of a flying Event through one's poor LETTER TO D'ALEMBERT.\r\nWe will now give the two English Interviews with Voltaire; one of which\r\nis of three years past, another of three years ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 1. DR BURNEY HAS SIGHT OF VOLTAIRE (July, 1770).\r\n\r\nIn the years 1770-1771, Burney, then a famous DOCTOR OF MUSIC, made\r\nhis TOUR through France and Italy, on Musical errands and researches:\r\n[Charles Burney's _Present State of Music in France and Italy, being\r\nthe Journal of a Tour through those Countries to collect Materials for\r\na General History of Music_ (London, 1773). The _History of Music_\r\nfollowed duly, in Four 4tos (London, 1776-1789).] with these we have no\r\nconcern, but only with one most small exceptional offshoot or\r\nepisode which grew out of these. Enough for us to know that Burney, a\r\ncomfortable, well-disposed, rather dull though vivacious Doctor, age\r\nnear 45, had left London for Paris \"in June, 1770;\" that he was on to\r\nGeneva, intending for Turin, \"early in July;\" and that his \"M. Fritz,\"\r\nmentioned below, is a veteran Brother in Music, settled at Geneva for\r\nthe last thirty years, who has been helpful and agreeable to Burney\r\nwhile here. Our Excerpt therefore dates itself, \"one of the early days\r\nof July, 1770,\"--Burney hovering between two plans (as we shall dimly\r\nperceive), and not exactly executing either:--\r\n\r\n.... \"My going to M. Fritz broke [was about breaking, but did not quite]\r\ninto a plan which I had formed of visiting M. de Voltaire, at the same\r\nhour, along with some other strangers, who were then going to Ferney.\r\nBut, to say the truth, besides the visit to M. Fritz being more MY\r\nBUSINESS, I did not much like going with these people, who had only a\r\nGeneva Bookseller to introduce them; and I had heard that some English\r\nhad lately met with a rebuff from M. de Voltaire, by going without any\r\nletter of recommendation, or anything to recommend themselves. He asked\r\nthem What they wanted? Upon their replying That they wished only to see\r\nso extraordinary a man, he said: 'Well, gentlemen, you now see me: did\r\nyou take me for a wild beast or monster, that was fit only to be stared\r\nat as a show?' This story very much frightened me; for, not having, when\r\nI left London, or even Paris, any intention of going to Geneva, I was\r\nquite unprovided with a recommendation. However, I was determined to see\r\nthe place of his residence, which I took to be [still LES DELICES],\r\n\r\nCETTE MAISON D'ARISTIPPE, CES JARDINS D'PICURE,\r\n\r\nto which he retired in 1755; but was mistaken [not The DELICES now at\r\nall, but Ferney, for nine or ten years back].\r\n\r\n\"I drove to Ferney alone, after I had left M. Fritz. This House is\r\nthree or four miles from Geneva, but near the Lake. I approached it with\r\nreverence, and a curiosity of the most minute kind. I inquired WHEN I\r\nfirst trod on his domain; I had an intelligent and talkative postilion,\r\nwho answered all my questions very satisfactorily. M. de Voltaire's\r\nestate is very large here, and he is building pretty farm-houses\r\nupon it. He has erected on the Geneva side a quadrangular JUSTICE, or\r\nGallows, to show that he is the SEIGNEUR. One of his farms, or rather\r\nmanufacturing houses,--for he is establishing a manufacture upon his\r\nestate,--was so handsome that I thought it was his chateau.\r\n\r\n\"We drove to Ferney, through a charming country, covered with corn and\r\nvines, in view of the Lake, and Mountains of Gex, Switzerland and Savoy.\r\nOn the left hand, approaching the House, is a neat Chapel with this\r\ninscription:--\r\n\r\n'DEO EREXIT VOLTAIRE MDCCLXI.'\r\n\r\nI sent to inquire, Whether a stranger might be allowed to see the House\r\nand Gardens; and was answered in the affirmative. A servant soon came,\r\nand conducted me into the cabinet or closet where his Master had just\r\nbeen writing: this is never shown when he is at home; but having walked\r\nout, I was allowed that privilege. From thence I passed to the\r\nLibrary, which is not a very large one, but well filled. Here I found\r\na whole-length Figure in marble of himself, recumbent, in one of the\r\nwindows; and many curiosities in another room; a Bust of himself, made\r\nnot two years since; his Mother's picture; that of his Niece, Madam\r\nDenis; his Brother, M. Dupuis; the Calas Family; and others. It is a\r\nvery neat and elegant House; not large, nor affectedly decorated.\r\n\r\n\"I should first have remarked, that close to the Chapel, between that\r\nand the house, is the Theatre, which he built some years ago; where he\r\ntreated his friends with some of his own Tragedies: it is now only used\r\nas a receptacle for wood and lumber, there having been no play acted in\r\nit these four years. The servant told me his Master was 78 [76 gone],\r\nbut very well. 'IL TRAVAILLE,' said he, 'PENDANT DIX HEURES CHAQUE JOUR,\r\nHe studies ten hours every day; writes constantly without spectacles,\r\nand walks out with only a domestic, often a mile or two--ET LE VOILA, LA\r\nBAS, And see, yonder he is!'\r\n\r\n\"He was going to his workmen. My heart leaped at the sight of so\r\nextraordinary a man. He had just then quitted his Garden, and was\r\ncrossing the court before his House. Seeing my chaise, and me on the\r\npoint of mounting it, he made a sign to his servant who had been my\r\nCICERONE, to go to him; in order, I suppose, to inquire who I was.\r\nAfter they had exchanged a few words together, he,\" M. de Voltaire,\r\n\"approached the place where I was standing motionless, in order to\r\ncontemplate his person as much as I could while his eyes were turned\r\nfrom me; but on seeiug him move towards me, I found myself drawn by\r\nsome irresistible power towards him; and, without knowing what I did, I\r\ninsensibly met him half-way.\r\n\r\n\"It is not easy to conceive it possible for life to subsist in a form\r\nso nearly composed of mere skin and bone as that of M. de Voltaire.\"\r\nExtremely lean old Gentleman! \"He complained of decrepitude, and said,\r\nHe supposed I was anxious to form an idea of the figure of one walking\r\nafter death. However, his eyes and whole countenance are still full\r\nof fire; and though so emaciated, a more lively expression cannot be\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\n\"He inquired after English news; and observed that Poetical squabbles\r\nhad given way to Political ones; but seemed to think the spirit of\r\nopposition as necessary in poetry as in politics. _'Les querelles\r\nd'auteurs sont pour le bien de la litterature, comme dans un\r\ngouvernement libre les querelles des grands, et les clameurs des petits,\r\nsont necessaires a la liberte._' And added, 'When critics are silent, it\r\ndoes not so much prove the Age to be correct, as dull.' He inquired\r\nwhat Poets we had now; I told him we had Mason and Gray. 'They write\r\nbut little,' said he: 'and you seem to have no one who lords it over the\r\nrest, like Dryden, Pope and Swift.' I told him that it was one of the\r\ninconveniences of Periodical Journals, however well executed, that they\r\noften silenced modest men of genius, while impudent blockheads were\r\nimpenetrable, and unable to feel the critic's scourge: that Mr. Gray and\r\nMr. Mason had both been illiberally treated by mechanical critics, even\r\nin newspapers; and added, that modesty and love of quiet seemed in these\r\ngentlemen to have got the better even of their love of fame.\r\n\r\n\"During this conversation, we approached the buildings that he was\r\nconstructing near the road to his Chateau. 'These,' said he, pointing\r\nto them, 'are the most innocent, and perhaps the most useful, of all\r\nmy works.' I observed that he had other works, which were of far more\r\nextensive use, and would be much more durable, than those. He was so\r\nobliging as to show me several farm-houses that he had built, and the\r\nplans of others: after which I took my leave.\" [Burney's _Present State\r\nof Music_ (London, 1773), pp. 55-62.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. 2. A REVEREND MR. SHERLOCK SEES VOLTAIRE, AND EVEN DINES WITH HIM\r\n(April, 1776).\r\n\r\nSherlock's Book of TRAVELS, though he wrote it in two languages, and it\r\nonce had its vogue, is now little other than a Dance of Will-o'-wisps\r\nto us. A Book tawdry, incoherent, indistinct, at once flashy and opaque,\r\nfull of idle excrescences and exuberances;--as is the poor man himself.\r\nHe was \"Chaplain to the Earl of Bristol, Bishop of Derry;\" gyrating\r\nabout as ecclesiastical Moon to that famed Solar Luminary, what could\r\nyou expect! [Title of his Book is, _Letters from an English Traveller;\r\ntranslated from the French Original_ (London, 1780). Ditto, _Letters\r\nfrom an English Trader; written originally in French;_ by the Rev.\r\nMartin Sherlock, A.M., Chaplain to the Earl of Bristol, &c. (a new\r\nEdition, 2 vols., London, 1802).] Poor Sherlock is nowhere intentionally\r\nfabulous; nor intrinsically altogether so foolish as he seems: let that\r\nsuffice us. In his Dance of Will-o'-wisps, which in this point happily\r\nis dated,--26th-27th April, 1776,--he had come to Ferney, with proper\r\nintroduction to Voltaire; and here (after severe excision of the flabby\r\nparts, but without other change) is credible account of what he saw and\r\nheard. In Three Scenes; with this Prologue,--as to Costume, which is\r\nworth reading twice:--\r\n\r\nVOLTAIRE'S DRESS. \"On the two days I saw him, he wore white cloth shoes,\r\nwhite woollen stockings, red breeches, with a nightgown and waistcoat\r\nof blue linen, flowered, and lined with yellow. He had on a grizzle wig\r\nwith three ties, and over it a silk nightcap embroidered with gold and\r\nsilver.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE I. THE ENTRANCE-HALL OF FERNEY (Friday, 26th April, 1776):\r\nEXUBERANT SHERLOCK ENTERING, LETTER OF INTRODUCTION HAVING PRECEDED.\r\n\r\n\"He met in the hall; his Nephew M. d'Hornoi\" (Grand-nephew; Abbe Mignot,\r\nfamous for BURYING Voltaire, and Madame Denis, whom we know, were\r\nD'Hornoi's Uncle and Aunt)--Grand-nephew, \"Counsellor in the Parlement\r\nof Paris, held him by the arm. He said to me, with a very weak voice:\r\n'You see a very old man, who makes a great effort to have the honor of\r\nseeing you. Will you take a walk in my Garden? It will please you, for\r\nit is in the English taste:--it was I who introduced that taste into\r\nFrance, and it is become universal. But the French parody your Gardens:\r\nthey put your thirty acres into three.'\r\n\r\n\"From his Gardens you see the Alps, the Lake, the City of Geneva and its\r\nenvirons, which are very pleasant. He said:--\r\n\r\nVOLTAIRE. \"'It is a beautiful prospect.' He pronounced these words\r\ntolerably well.\r\n\r\nSHERLOCK. \"'How long is it since you were in England?'\r\n\r\nVOLTAIRE. \"'Fifty years, at least.'

He\r\nsaid some shocking things against Moses and against Shakspeare. [Like\r\nenough!]... We then talked of Spain.\r\n\r\nVOLTAIRE. \"'It is a Country of which we know no more than of the most\r\nsavage parts of Africa; and it is not worth the trouble of being known.\r\nIf a man would travel there, he must carry his bed, &c. On arriving in\r\na Town, he must go into one street to buy a bottle of wine; a piece of\r\na mule [by way of beef] in another; he finds a table in a third,--and he\r\nsups. A French Nobleman was passing through Pampeluna: he sent out for\r\na spit; there was only one in the Town, and that was lent away for a\r\nwedding.'\r\n\r\nD'HORNOI. \"'There, Monsieur, is a Village which M. de Voltaire has\r\nbuilt!'\r\n\r\nVOLTAIRE. \"'Yes, we have our freedoms here. Cut off a little corner, and\r\nwe are out of France. I asked some privileges for my Children here, and\r\nthe King has granted me all that I asked, and has declared this Pays de\r\nGex exempt from all Taxes of the Farmers-General; so that salt, which\r\nformerly sold for ten sous a pound, now sells for four.

The\r\nReview is beautiful as a Spectacle; but that is in no sort the intention\r\nof it. Rigorous business, as in the strictest of Universities examining\r\nfor Degrees, would be nearer the definition. Sometimes, when a new\r\nmanoeuvre or tactical invention of importance is to be tried by\r\nexperiment, you will find for many miles the environs of Potsdam, which\r\nis usually the scene of such experiments, carefully shut in; sentries\r\non every road, no unfriendly eye admitted; the thing done as with closed\r\ndoors. Nor at any time can you attend without leave asked; though to\r\nForeign Officers, and persons that have really business there, there\r\nappears to be liberality enough in granting it. The concourse of\r\nmilitary strangers seems to keep increasing every year, till Friedrich's\r\ndeath. [Rodenbeck, iii. IN LOCIS.] French, more and more in quantity,\r\npresent themselves; multifarious German names; generally a few English\r\ntoo,--Burgoyne (of Saratoga finally), Cornwallis, Duke of York, Marshal\r\nConway,--of which last we have something farther to say at present.\r\n\r\nIn Summer, 1774, Conway--the Marshal Conway, of whom Walpole is\r\ncontinually talking as of a considerable Soldier and Politician, though\r\nhe was not in either character considerable, but was Walpole's friend,\r\nand an honest modest man--had made up his mind, perhaps partly on\r\ndomestic grounds (for I have noticed glimpses of a \"Lady C.\" much out\r\nof humor), to make a Tour in Germany, and see the Reviews, both Austrian\r\nand Prussian, Prussian especially. Two immense LETTERS of his on that\r\nsubject have come into my hands, [Kindly presented me by Charles Knight,\r\nEsq., the well-known Author and Publisher (who possesses a Collection by\r\nthe same hand): these Two run to fourteen large pages in my Copy!] and\r\nelsewhere incidentally there is printed record of the Tour; [In Keith\r\n(Sir Robert Murray), _Memoirs and Correspondence,_ ii. 21 et, seq.]\r\nunimportant as possible, both Tour and Letters, but capable, if squeezed\r\ninto compass, of still being read without disadvantage here.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Murray Keith--that is, the younger Excellency Keith, now\r\nMinister at Dresden, whom we have sometimes heard of--accompanies Conway\r\non this Tour, or flies alongside of him, with frequent intersections\r\nat the principal points; and there is printed record by Sir Robert, but\r\nstill less interesting than this of Conway, and perfectly conformable\r\nto it:--so that, except for some words about the Lord Marischal, which\r\nshall be given, Keith must remain silent, while the diffuse Conway\r\nstrives to become intelligible. Indeed, neither Conway nor Keith tell us\r\nthe least thing that is not abundantly, and even wearisomely known from\r\nGerman sources; but to readers here, a pair of English eyes looking on\r\nthe matter (put straight in places by the help there is), may give it\r\na certain freshness of meaning. Here are Conway's Two Letters, with the\r\nnine parts of water charitably squeezed out of them, by a skilful friend\r\nof mine and his.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONWAY TO HIS BROTHER, MARQUIS OF HERTFORD (in London).\r\n\r\n\"BERLIN, July 17th, 1774.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR BROTHER,--In the hurry I live in--... Leaving Brunswick, where,\r\nin absence of most of the Court, who are visiting at Potsdam, my old\r\nCommander,\" Duke Ferdinand, now estranged from Potsdam, [Had a kind of\r\nquarrel with Friedrich in 1766 (rough treatment by Adjutant von\r\nAnhalt, not tolerable to a Captain now become so eminent), and quietly\r\nwithdrew,--still on speaking terms with the King, but never his Officer\r\nmore.] and living here among works of Art, and speculations on Free\r\nMasonry, \"was very kind to me, I went to Celle, in Hanover, to pay my\r\nrespects to the Queen of Denmark [unfortunate divorced Matilda, saved\r\nby my friend Keith,--innocent, I will hope!]... She is grown extremely\r\nfat.... At Magdeburg, the Prussian Frontier on this side, one is not\r\nallowed, without a permit, even to walk on the ramparts,--such the\r\nstrictness of Prussian rule.... Driving through Potsdam, on my way to\r\nBerlin, I was stopped by a servant of the good old Lord Marischal, who\r\nhad spied me as I passed under his window. He came out in his nightgown,\r\nand insisted upon our staying to dine with him--[worthy old man; a word\r\nof him, were this Letter done]. We ended, on consultation about times\r\nand movements of the King, by staying three days at Potsdam, mostly with\r\nthis excellent old Lord.\r\n\r\n\"On the third day [yesterday evening, in fact], I went, by appointment,\r\nto the New Palace, to wait upon the King of Prussia. There was some\r\ndelay: his Majesty had gone, in the interim, to a private Concert, which\r\nhe was giving to the Princesses [Duchess of Brunswick and other high\r\nguests [Rodenbeck (IN DIE) iii. 98.]]; but the moment he was told I\r\nwas there, he came out from his company, and gave me a most flattering\r\ngracious audience of more than half an hour; talking on a great variety\r\nof things, with an ease and freedom the very reverse of what I had\r\nbeen made to expect.... I asked, and received permission, to visit the\r\nSilesian Camps next month, his Majesty most graciously telling me the\r\nparticular days they would begin and end [27th August-3d September,\r\nSchmelwitz near Breslau, are time and place [Ib. iii. 101.]]. This\r\nconsiderably deranges my Austrian movements, and will hurry my return\r\nout of those parts: but who could resist such a temptation!--I saw the\r\nFoot-Guards exercise, especially the splendid 'First Battalion;' I could\r\nhave conceived nothing so perfect and so exact as all I saw:--so well\r\ndressed, such men, and so punctual in all they did.\r\n\r\n\"The New Palace at Potsdam is extremely noble. Not so perfect, perhaps,\r\nin point of taste, but better than I had been led to expect. The King\r\ndislikes living there; never does, except when there is high Company\r\nabout him; for seven or eight months in the year, he prefers Little\r\nSans-Souci, and freedom among his intimates and some of his Generals....\r\nHis Music still takes up a great share of the King's time. On a table in\r\nhis Cabinet there, I saw, I believe, twenty boxes with a German flute\r\nin each; in his Bed-chamber, twice as many boxes of Spanish snuff; and,\r\nalike in Cabinet and in Bed-chamber, three arm-chairs in a row for three\r\nfavorite dogs, each with a little stool by way of step, that the getting\r\nup might be easy....\r\n\r\n\"The Town of Potsdam is a most extraordinary and, in its appearance,\r\nbeautiful Town; all the streets perfectly straight, all at right angles\r\nto each other; and all the houses built with handsome, generally elegant\r\nfronts.... He builds for everybody who has a bad or a small house, even\r\nthe lowest mechanic. He has done the same at Berlin.\" Altogether, his\r\nMajesty's building operations are astonishing. And \"from whence does\r\nthis money come, after a long expensive War? It is all fairyland and\r\nenchantment,\"--MAGNUM VECTIGAL PARSIMONIA, in fact!... \"At Berlin here,\r\nI saw the Porcelain Manufacture to-day, which is greatly improved. I\r\nleave presently.

Unfortunate\r\nQueen Matilda; one never knows how guilty, or whether guilty at all,\r\nbut she was very unfortunate, poor young Lady! What with a mad Husband\r\ncollapsed by debaucheries into stupor of insanity; what with a Doctor,\r\ngradually a Prime Minister, Struensee, wretched scarecrow to look\r\nupon, but wiser than most Danes about; and finally, with a\r\nlynx-eyed Step-sister, whose Son, should Matilda mistake, will\r\ninherit,--unfortunate Matilda had fallen into the awfulest troubles;\r\ngot divorced, imprisoned, would have lost her head along with\r\nscarecrow Struensee had not her Brother George III. emphatically\r\nintervened,--Excellency Keith, with Seventy-fours in the distance,\r\ncoming out very strong on the occasion,--and got her loose. Loose from\r\nDanish axe and jail, at any rate; delivered into safety and solitude\r\nat Celle in Hanover, where she now is,--and soon after suddenly dies of\r\nfever, so closing a very sad short history.\r\n\r\nExcellency Keith, famed in the Diplomatic circles ever since, is at\r\npresent ahead of Conway on their joint road to the Austrian Reviews.\r\nBefore giving Conway's Second Letter, let us hear Keith a little on his\r\nkinsman the Old Marischal, whom he saw at Berlin years ago, and still\r\noccasionally corresponds with, and mentions in his Correspondence. Keith\r\nLOQUITUR; date is Dresden, February, 1770:--\r\n\r\nHAS VISITED THE OLD MARISCHAL AT POTSDAM LATELY.... \"My stay of three\r\ndays with Lord Marischal.... He is the most innocent of God's creatures;\r\nand his heart is much warmer than his head. The place of his abode,\" I\r\nmust say, \"is the very Temple of Dulness; and his Female Companion [a\r\npoor Turk foundling, a perishing infant flung into his late Brother's\r\nhands at the Fall of Oczakow, [Supra, vii. 82.]--whom the Marischal has\r\ncarefully brought up, and who refuses to marry away from him,--rather\r\nstupid, not very pretty by the Portraits; must now be two-and-thirty\r\ngone] is perfectly calculated to be the Priestess of it! Yet he\r\ndawdles away his day in a manner not unpleasant to him; and I really am\r\npersuaded he has a conscience that would gild the inside of a dungeon.\r\nThe feats of our bare-legged warriors in the late War [BERG-SCHOTTEN,\r\namong whom I was a Colonel], accompanied by a PIBRACH [elegiac bagpipe\r\ndroning MORE SUO] in his outer room, have an effect on the old Don,\r\nwhich would delight you.\" [Keith, i. 129; \"Dresden, 25th February,\r\n1770:\" to his Sister in Scotland.]\r\n\r\nAND THEN SEEN HIM IN BERLIN, ON THE SAME OCCASION.... \"Lord Marischal\r\ncame to meet me at Sir Andrew's [Mitchell's, in Berlin, the last year of\r\nthe brave Mitchell's life], where we passed five days together. My visit\r\nto his country residence,\" as you already know, \"was of three days; and\r\nI had reason to be convinced that it gave the old Don great pleasure.\r\nHe talked to me with the greatest openness and confidence of all the\r\nmaterial incidents of his life; and hinted often that the honor of the\r\nClan was now to be supported by our family, for all of whom he had the\r\ngreatest esteem. His taste, his ideas, and his manner of living, are a\r\nmixture of Aberdeenshire and the Kingdom of Valencia; and as he seeks\r\nto make no new friends, he seems to retain a strong, though silent,\r\nattachment for his old ones. As to his political principles, I believe\r\nhim the most sincere of converts\" to Whiggery and Orthodoxy.... \"Since\r\nI began this, I have had a most inimitable Letter from Lord Marischal. I\r\nhad mentioned Dr. Bailies to him [noted English Doctor at Dresden, bent\r\non inoculating and the like], and begged he would send me a state of his\r\ncase and infirmities, that the Doctor might prescribe for him. This is a\r\npart of his answer:--\r\n\r\n\"'I thank you for your advice of consulting the English Doctor to repair\r\nmy old carcass. I have lately done so by my old coach, and it is now\r\nalmost as good as new. Please, therefore, to tell the Doctor, that from\r\nhim I expect a good repair, and shall state the case. First, he must\r\nknow that the machine is the worse for wear, being nearly eighty years\r\nold. The reparation I propose he shall begin with is: One pair of new\r\neyes, one pair of new ears, some improvement on the memory. When this\r\nis done, we shall ask new legs, and some change in the stomach. For\r\nthe present, this first reparation will be sufficient; and we must not\r\ntrouble the Doctor too much at once.'--You see by this how easy his\r\nLordship's infirmities sit upon him; and it is really so as he says.\r\nYour friend Sir Andrew is, I am afraid, less gay; but I have not heard\r\nfrom him these three months.\" [Keith, i. 132, 133; \"Dresden, 13th March,\r\n1770:\" to his Father.]\r\n\r\nCONWAY TO KEITH, ON THE LATE THREE DAYS AT POTSDAM.

He stopped me as I passed, and not only made me\r\ndine with him that day, but in a manner live with him. He is not at all\r\nblind, as you imagined; so much otherwise, that I saw him read, without\r\nspectacles, a difficult hand I could not easily decipher.... Stayed but\r\na day at Berlin;\" am rushing after you:--Here is my Second Letter:--\r\n\r\n\r\nCONWAY'S SECOND LETTER (to his Brother, as before).\r\n\r\n\"SCHMELWITZ [near Breslau] HEAD-QUARTERS,\r\n\r\nAugust 31st, 1774.\r\n\r\n\"DEAR BROTHER... I left that Camp [Austrian Camp, and Reviews in\r\nHungary, where the Kaiser and everybody had been very gracious to\r\nme] with much regret.\" Parted regretfully with Keith;--had played, at\r\nPresburg, in sight of him and fourteen other Englishmen, a game with the\r\nChess Automaton [brand-new miracle, just out]; [Account of it, and of\r\nthis game, in KEITH too (ii. 18; \"View, 3d September, 1774:\" Keith to\r\nhis Father).]--came on through Vienna hitherward, as fast as post-horses\r\ncould carry us; travelling night and day, without stopping, being rather\r\nbehind time. \"Arrived at Breslau near dark, last night; where I learnt\r\nthat the Camp was twenty miles off; that the King was gone there,\r\nand that the Manoeuvres would begin at four or five this morning. I\r\ntherefore ordered my chaise at twelve at night, and set out, in darkness\r\nand rain, to be presented to the King of Prussia next morning at five,\r\nat the head of his troops.... When I arrived, before five, at the place\r\ncalled 'Head-quarters,' I found myself in the middle of a miserable\r\nVillage [this Schmelwitz here]; no creature alive or stirring, nor a\r\nsentinel, or any Military object to be seen.... As soon as anything\r\nalive was to be found, we asked, If the King was lodged in that Village?\r\n'Yes,' they said, 'in that House' (pointing to a clay Hovel). But\r\nGeneral Lentulus soon appeared; and--\r\n\r\n\"His Majesty has been very gracious; asked me many questions about my\r\ntour to Hungary. I saw all the Troops pass him as they arrived in Camp.\r\nThey made a very fine appearance really, though it rained hard the whole\r\ntime we were out; and as his Majesty [age 62] did not cloak, we were all\r\nheartily wet. And, what was worse, went from the field to Orders\r\n[giving out of Parole, and the like] at his Quarters, there to make our\r\nbow;--where we stayed in our wet clothes an hour and half [towards 10\r\nA.M. by this time].... How different at the Emperor's, when his Imperial\r\nMajesty and everybody was cloaked! [Got no hurt by the wet, strange to\r\nsay.] ... These are our news to this day. And now, having sat up five\r\nnights out of the last six, and been in rain and dirt almost all day, I\r\nwish you sincerely good-night.--H. S. C.\r\n\r\n\"P.S. Breslau, 4th September.--... My Prussian Campaign is finished,\r\nand as much to my satisfaction as possible. The beauty and order of\r\nthe Troops, their great discipline, their\" &c. &c., \"almost pass all\r\nbelief.... Yesterday we were on horseback early, at four o'clock. The\r\nmovement was conducted with a spirit and order, on both sides, that was\r\nastonishing, and struck the more delightful (SIC) by the variety, as in\r\nthe course of the Action the Enemy, conducted by General Anhalt [head\r\nall right as yet], took three different positions before his final\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\n\"The moment it was over [nine o'clock or so], his Majesty got a fresh\r\nhorse, and set out for Potsdam, after receiving the compliments of those\r\npresent, or rather holding a kind of short Levee in the field. I can't\r\nsay how much, in my particular, I am obliged to his Majesty for his\r\nextraordinary reception, and distinction shown me throughout. Each day\r\nafter the Manoeuvre, and giving the Orders of the day, he held a little\r\nLevee at the door, or in the court; at which, I can assure you, it is\r\nnot an exaggeration of vanity to say, that he not only talked to me, but\r\nliterally to nobody else at all. It was a good deal each time, and as\r\nsoon as finished he made his bow, and retired, though all, or most, of\r\nthe other Foreigners were standing by, as well as his own Generals. He\r\nalso called me up, and spoke to me several times on horseback, when we\r\nwere out, which he seldom did to anybody.\r\n\r\n\"The Prince Royal also showed me much civility. The second day, he asked\r\nme to come and drink a dish of tea with him after dinner, and kept me an\r\nhour and half. He told me, among other things, that the King of Prussia\r\nhad a high opinion of me, and that it came chiefly from the favorable\r\nmanner in which Duke Ferdinand and the Hereditary Prince [of Brunswick]\r\nhad spoken of me.... Pray let Horace Walpole know my address, that I may\r\nhave all the chance I can of hearing from him. But if he comes to Paris,\r\nI forgive him.--H. S. C.\"\r\n\r\nFriedrich's Reviews, though fine to look upon, or indeed the finest in\r\nthe world, were by no means of spectacular nature; but of altogether\r\nserious and practical, almost of solemn and terrible, to the parties\r\ninterested. Like the strictest College Examination for Degrees, as we\r\nsaid; like a Royal Assize or Doomsday of the Year; to Military people,\r\nand over the upper classes of Berlin Society, nothing could be more\r\nserious, Major Kaltenborn, an Ex-Prussian Officer, presumably of\r\nover-talkative habits, who sounds on us like a very mess-room of the\r\ntime all gathered under one hat,--describes in an almost awful manner\r\nthe kind of terror with which all people awaited these Annual Assizes\r\nfor trial of military merit.\r\n\r\n\"What a sight,\" says he, \"and awakening what thoughts, that of a body\r\nof from 18,000 to 20,000 soldiers, in solemn silence and in deepest\r\nreverence, awaiting their fate from one man! A Review, in Friedrich's\r\ntime, was an important moment for almost the whole Country. The fortune\r\nof whole families often depended on it: from wives, mothers, children\r\nand friends, during those terrible three days, there arose fervent\r\nwishes to Heaven, that misfortune might not, as was too frequently the\r\ncase, befall their husbands, fathers, sons and friends, in the course of\r\nthem. Here the King, as it were, weighed the merits of his Officers, and\r\ndistributed, according as he found them light or heavy, praise or blame,\r\nrebukes or favors; and often, too often, punishments, to be felt through\r\nlife. One single unhappy moment [especially if it were the last of a\r\nlong series of such!] often deprived the bravest Officer of his bread,\r\npainfully earned in peace and war, and of his reputation and honor,\r\nat least in the eyes of most men, who judge of everything only by its\r\nissue. The higher you had risen, the easier and deeper your fall might\r\nbe at an unlucky Review. The Heads and Commanders of regiments were\r\nalways in danger of being sent about their business (WEGGEJAGT).\"\r\n\r\nThe fact is, I Kaltenborn quitted the Prussian Service, and took\r\nHessian,--being (presumably) of exaggerative, over-talkative nature, and\r\nstrongly gravitating Opposition way!--Kaltenborn admits that the King\r\ndelighted in nothing so much as to see people's faces cheerful about\r\nhim; provided the price for it were not too high. Here is another\r\npassage from him:--\r\n\r\n\"At latest by 9 in the morning the day's Manoeuvre had finished, and\r\neverything was already in its place again. Straight from the ground\r\nall Heads of regiments, the Majors-DE-JOUR, all Aides-de-Camp, and from\r\nevery battalion one Officer, proceed to Head-quarters. It was impossible\r\nto speak more beautifully, or instructively, than the King did on such\r\noccasions, if he were not in bad humor. It was then a very delight to\r\nhear him deliver a Military Lecture, as it were. He knew exactly who\r\nhad failed, what caused the fault, and how it might and should have been\r\nretrieved. His voice was soft and persuasive (HINREISSEND); he looked\r\nkindly, and appeared rather bent upon giving good advice than commands.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, for instance, he once said to General van Lossow, Head of the\r\nBlack Hussars: 'Your (SEINE) Attack would have gone very well, had not\r\nyour own squadron pressed forward too much (VORGEPRELLT). The brave\r\nfellows wanted to show me how they can ride. But don't I know that well\r\nenough;--and also that you [covetous Lossow] always choose the best\r\nhorses from the whole remount for your own squadron! There was,\r\ntherefore, no need at all for that. Tell your people not to do so\r\nto-morrow, and you will see it will go much better; all will remain\r\ncloser in their places, and the left wing be able to keep better in\r\nline, in coming on.'--Another time, having observed, in a certain\r\nFoot-regiment, that the soldiers were too long in getting out their\r\ncartridges, he said to the Commandant: 'Do you know the cause of this,\r\nmy dear Colonel? Look, the cartouche, in the cartridge-box, has 32\r\nholes; into these the fellow sticks his eight cartridges, without caring\r\nhow: and so the poor devil fumbles and gropes about, and cannot get hold\r\nof any. But now, if the Officers would look to it that he place them\r\nall well together in the middle of the cartouche, he would never make\r\na false grasp, and the loading would go as quick again. Only tell your\r\nOfficers that I had made this observation, and I am sure they will\r\ngladly attend to it.'\" [Anonymous (Kaltenborn), _Briefe eines alten\r\nPreussischen Officiers_ (Hohenzollern, 1790), ii. 24-26.]\r\n\r\nOf humane consolatory Anecdotes, in this kind, our Opposition Kaltenborn\r\ngives several; of the rhadamanthine desolating or destructive kind,\r\nthough such also could not be wanting, if your Assize is to be good for\r\nanything, he gives us none. And so far as I can learn, the effective\r\npunishments, dismissals and the like, were of the due rarity and\r\npropriety; though the flashes of unjust rebuke, fulminant severity,\r\nlightnings from the gloom of one's own sorrows and ill-humor, were much\r\nmore frequent, but were seldom--I do not know if ever--persisted in to\r\nthe length of practical result. This is a Rhadamanthus much interested\r\nnot to be unjust, and to discriminate good from bad! Of Ziethen there\r\nare two famous Review Anecdotes, omitted and omissible by Kaltenborn,\r\nso well known are they: one of each kind. At a certain Review, year not\r\nascertainable,--long since, prior to the Seven-Years War,--the King's\r\nhumor was of the grimmest, nothing but faults all round; to Ziethen\r\nhimself, and the Ziethen Hussars, he said various hard things, and at\r\nlength this hardest: \"Out of my sight with you!\" [Madame de Blumenthal,\r\n_Life of Ziethen,_ i. 265.] Upon which Ziethen--a stratum of red-hot\r\nkindling in Ziethen too, as was easily possible--turns to his Hussars,\r\n\"Right about, RECHTS UM: march!\" and on the instant did as bidden.\r\nDisappeared, double-quick; and at the same high pace, in a high frame of\r\nmind, rattled on to Berlin, home to his quarters, and there first drew\r\nbridle. \"Turn; for Heaven's sake, bethink you!\" said more than one\r\nfriend whom he met on the road: but it was of no use. Everybody said,\r\n\"Ziethen is ruined;\" but Ziethen never heard of the thing more.\r\n\r\nAnecdote Second is not properly of a Review, but of an incidental Parade\r\nof the Guard, at Berlin (25th December, 1784), by the King in person:\r\nParade, or rather giving out of the Parole after it, in the King's\r\nApartments; which is always a kind of Military Levee as well;--and\r\nwhich, in this instance, was long famous among the Berlin people. King\r\nis just arrived for Carnival season; old Ziethen will not fail to pay\r\nhis duty, though climbing of the stairs is heavy to a man of 85 gone.\r\nThis is Madam Blumenthal's Narrative (corrected, as it needs, in certain\r\npoints):--\r\n\r\n\"SATURDAY, 25th DECEMBER, 1784, Ziethen, in spite of the burden of\r\neighty-six years, went to the Palace, at the end of the Parade, to pay\r\nhis Sovereign this last tribute of respect, and to have the pleasure\r\nof seeing him after six months' absence. The Parole was given out, the\r\norders imparted to the Generals, and the King had turned towards the\r\nPrinces of the Blood,--when he perceived Ziethen on the other side of\r\nthe Hall, between his Son and his two Aides-de-Camp. Surprised in a\r\nvery agreeable manner at this unexpected sight, he broke out into an\r\nexclamation of joy; and directly making up to him,--'What, my good old\r\nZiethen, are you there!' said his Majesty: 'How sorry am I that you have\r\nhad the trouble of walking up the staircase! I should have called upon\r\nyou myself. How have you been of late?' 'Sire,' answered Ziethen, (my\r\nhealth is not amiss, my appetite is good; but my strength! my strength!)\r\n'This account,' replied the King, 'makes me happy by halves only: but\r\nyou must be tired;--I shall have a chair for you.' [Thing unexampled in\r\nthe annals of Royalty!] A chair,\" on order to Ziethen's Aides-de-Camp,\r\n\"was quickly brought. Ziethen, however, declared that he was not at all\r\nfatigued: the King maintained that he was. 'Sit down, good Father (MEIN\r\nLIEBER ALTER PAPA ZIETHEN, SETZE ER SICH DOCH)!' continued his Majesty:\r\n'I will have it so; otherwise I must instantly leave the room; for I\r\ncannot allow you to be incommoded under my own roof.' The old General\r\nobeyed, and Friedrich the Great remained standing before him, in the\r\nmidst of a brilliant circle that had thronged round them. After asking\r\nhim many questions respecting his hearing, his memory and the general\r\nstate of his health, he at length took leave of him in these words:\r\n'Adieu, my dear Ziethen [it was his last adieu!]--take care not to catch\r\ncold; nurse yourself well, and live as long as you can, that I may often\r\nhave the pleasure of seeing you.' After having said this, the King,\r\ninstead of speaking to the other Generals, and walking through the\r\nsaloons, as usual, retired abruptly, and shut himself up in his closet.\"\r\n[Blumenthal, ii. 341; _Militair-Lexikon,_ iv. 318. Chodowiecki has\r\nmade an Engraving of this Scene; useful to look at for its military\r\nPortraits, if of little esteem otherwise. Strangely enough, both in\r\nBLUMENTHAL and in Chodowiecki's ENGRAVING the year is given as 1785\r\n(plainly impossible); _Militair-Lexikon_ misprints the month; and, one\r\nway or other, only Rodenbeck (iii. 316) is right in both day and year.]\r\n\r\nFollowing in date these small Conway Phenomena, if these, so extraneous\r\nand insignificant, can have any glimmer of memorability to readers, are\r\ntwo other occurrences, especially one other, which come in at this\r\npart of the series, and greatly more require to be disengaged from the\r\ndust-heaps, and presented for remembrance.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, the King had a fit of illness; which long occupied certain\r\nGazetteers and others. That is the first occurrence of the two, and far\r\nthe more important. He himself says of it, in his HISTORY, all that is\r\nessential to us here:--\r\n\r\n\"Towards the end of 1775, the King was attacked by several strong\r\nconsecutive fits of gout. Van Swieten, a famous Doctor's Son, and\r\nMinister of the Imperial Court at Berlin, took it into his head that\r\nthis gout was a declared dropsy; and, glad to announce to his Court\r\nthe approaching death of an enemy that had been dangerous to it, boldly\r\ninformed his Kaiser that the King was drawing to his end, and would\r\nnot last out the year. At this news the soul of Joseph flames into\r\nenthusiasm; all the Austrian troops are got on march, their Rendezvous\r\nmarked in Bohemia; and the Kaiser waits, full of impatience, at Vienna,\r\ntill the expected event arrives; ready then to penetrate at once into\r\nSaxony, and thence to the Frontiers of Brandenburg, and there propose\r\nto the King's Successor the alternative of either surrendering Silesia\r\nstraightway to the House of Austria, or seeing himself overwhelmed by\r\nAustrian troops before he could get his own assembled. All these things,\r\nwhich were openly done, got noised abroad everywhere; and did not, as is\r\neasy to believe, cement the friendship of the Two Courts. To the Public\r\nthis scene appeared the more ridiculous, as the King of Prussia, having\r\nonly had a common gout in larger dose than common, was already well\r\nof it again, before the Austrian Army had got to their Rendezvous. The\r\nKaiser made all these troops return to their old quarters; and the Court\r\nof Vienna had nothing but mockery for its imprudent conduct.\" [_OEuvres\r\nde Frederic,_ vi. 124.]\r\n\r\nThe first of these gout-attacks seems to have come in the end of\r\nSeptember, and to have lasted about a month; after which the illness\r\nabated, and everybody thought it was gone. The Kaiser-Joseph evolution\r\nmust have been in October, and have got its mockery in the next months.\r\nFriedrich, writing to VOLTAIRE, October 22d, has these words:... \"A pair\r\nof charming Letters from Ferney; to which, had they been from the great\r\nDemiurgus himself, I could not have dictated Answer. Gout held me tied\r\nand garroted for four weeks;--gout in both feet and in both hands; and,\r\nsuch its extreme liberality, in both elbows too: at present the pains\r\nand the fever have abated, and I feel only a very great exhaustion.\"\r\n[Ib. xxv. 44.] \"Four consecutive attacks; hope they are now all over;\"\r\nbut we read, within the Spring following, that there have been in\r\nall twelve of them; and in May, 1776, the Newspapers count eighteen\r\nquasi-consecutive. So that in reality the King's strength was sadly\r\nreduced; and his health, which did not recover its old average till\r\nabout 1780, continued, for several years after this bad fit, to be a\r\nconstant theme of curiosity to the Gazetteer species, and a matter of\r\nsolicitude to his friends and to his enemies.\r\n\r\nOf the Kaiser's immense ambition there can be no question. He is\r\nstretching himself out on every side; \"seriously wishing,\" thinks\r\nFriedrich, \"that he could 'revivify the German Reich,'\"--new Barbarossa\r\nin improved FIXED form; how noble! Certainly, to King Friedrich's sad\r\nconviction, \"the Austrian Court is aiming to swallow all manner of\r\ndominions that may fall within its grasp.\" Wants Bosnia and Servia in\r\nthe East; longs to seize certain Venetian Territories, which would unite\r\nTrieste and the Milanese to the Tyrol. Is throwing out hooks on Modena,\r\non the Ferrarese, on this and on that. Looking with eager eyes on\r\nBavaria,--the situation of which is peculiar; the present Kur-Baiern\r\nbeing elderly, childless; and his Heir the like, who withal is already\r\nKur-Pfalz, and will unite the Two Electorates under one head; a thing\r\nwhich Austria regards with marked dislike. [_OEuvres de Frederic,_ vi.\r\n123.] These are anxious considerations to a King in Friedrich's sick\r\nstate. In his private circle, too, there are sorrows: death of Fouquet,\r\ndeath of Quintus Icilius, of Seidlitz, Quantz (good old Quantz, with his\r\nfine Flutings these fifty years, and the still finer memories he awoke!\r\n[Friedrich's Teacher of the Flute; procured for him by his Mother\r\n(supra vi. 144).]),--latterly an unusual number of deaths. The ruggedly\r\nintelligent Quintus, a daily companion, and guest at the supper-table,\r\ndied few months before this fit of gout; and must have been greatly\r\nmissed by Friedrich. Fouquet, at Brandenburg, died last year: his\r\nbenefactor in the early Custrin distresses, his \"Bayard,\" and chosen\r\nfriend ever since; how conspicuously dear to Friedrich to the last is\r\nstill evident. A Friedrich getting lonely enough, and the lights of his\r\nlife going out around him;--has but one sure consolation, which comes\r\nto him as compulsion withal, and is not neglected, that of standing\r\nsteadfast to his work, whatever the mood and posture be.\r\n\r\nThe Event of 1776 is Czarowitsh Paul's arrival in Berlin, and Betrothal\r\nto a second Wife there; his first having died in childbirth lately. The\r\nfirst had been of Friedrich's choosing, but had behaved ill,--seduced by\r\nSpanish-French Diplomacies, by this and that, poor young creature:--the\r\nsecond also was of Friedrich's choosing, and a still nearer connection:\r\nfigure what a triumphant event! Event now fallen dead to every one of\r\nus; and hardly admitting the smallest Note,--except for chronology's\r\nsake, which it is always satisfactory to keep clear:--\r\n\r\n\"Czarowitsh Paul's first Wife, the Hessen-Darmstadt Princess of Three,\r\ndied of her first child April 26th, 1776: everybody whispered, 'It is\r\nnone of Paul's!' who, nevertheless, was inconsolable, the wild heart of\r\nhim like to break on the occurrence. By good luck, Prince Henri had set\r\nout, by invitation, on a second visit to Petersburg; and arrived there\r\nalso on April 26th, [Rodenbeck, iii. 139-146.] the very day of the\r\nfatality. Prince Henri soothed, consoled the poor Czarowitsh; gradually\r\nbrought him round; agreed with his Czarina Mother, that he must have a\r\nnew Wife; and dexterously fixed her choice on a 'Niece of the King's\r\nand Henri's.' Eldest Daughter of Eugen of Wurtemberg, of whom, as an\r\nexcellent General, though also as a surly Husband, readers have some\r\nmemory; now living withdrawn at Mumpelgard, the Wurtemberg Apanage\r\n[Montbeillard, as the French call it], in these piping times of\r\nPeace:--she is the Princess. To King Friedrich's great surprise and joy.\r\nThe Mumpelgard Principalities, and fortunate Princess, are summoned\r\nto Berlin. Czarowitsh Paul, under Henri's escort, and under gala and\r\nfestivities from the Frontier onward, arrived in Berlin 21st July, 1776;\r\nwas betrothed to his Wurtemberg Princess straightway; and after about a\r\nfortnight of festivities still more transcendent, went home with her\r\nto Petersburg; and was there wedded, 18th October following;--Czar and\r\nCzarina, she and he, twenty years after, and their posterity reigning\r\never since. [_OEuvres de Frederic,_ vi. 120-122.]\r\n\r\n\"At Vienna,\" says the King, \"everybody was persuaded the Czarowitsh\r\nwould never come to Berlin. Prince Kaunitz had been,\"--been at his old\r\ntricks again, playing his sharpest, in the Court of Petersburg again:\r\nwhat tricks (about Poland and otherwise) let us not report, for it is\r\nnow interesting to nobody. Of the Czarowitsh Visit itself I will remark\r\nonly,--what seems to be its one chance of dating itself in any of our\r\nmemories,--that it fell out shortly after the Sherlock dinner with\r\nVoltaire (in 1776, April 27th the one event, July 21st the other);--and\r\nthat here is, by pure accident, the exuberant erratic Sherlock, once\r\nmore, and once only, emerging on us for a few moments!--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXUBERANT SHERLOCK AND ELEVEN OTHER ENGLISH ARE PRESENTED TO FRIEDRICH\r\nON A COURT OCCASION (8th October, 1777); AND TWO OF THEM GET SPOKEN TO,\r\nAND SPEAK EACH A WORD. EXCELLENCY HUGH ELLIOT IS THEIR INTRODUCER.\r\n\r\nHarris, afterwards Earl of Malmesbury, succeeded Mitchell at Berlin;\r\n\"Polish troubles\" (heartily indifferent to England), \"Dantzig squabbles\"\r\n(miraculously important there),--nothing worth the least mention now.\r\nExcellency Harris quitted Berlin in Autumn, 1776; gave place to an\r\nExcellency Hugh Elliot (one of the Minto Elliots, Brother of the first\r\nEarl of Minto, and himself considerably noted in the world), of whom we\r\nhave a few words to say.\r\n\r\nElliot has been here since April, 1777; stays some five years in this\r\npost;--with not much Diplomatic employment, I should think, but with\r\na style of general bearing and social physiognomy, which, with some\r\nprocedures partly incidental as well, are still remembered in Berlin.\r\nSomething of spying, too, doubtless there was; bribing of menials,\r\nopening of Letters: I believe a great deal of that went on; impossible\r\nto prevent under the carefulest of Kings. [An ingenious young Friend of\r\nmine, connected with Legationary Business, found lately, at the Hague, a\r\nconsecutive Series, complete for four or five years (I think, from 1780\r\nonwards), of Friedrich's LETTERS to his MINISTER IN LONDON,--Copies\r\npunctually filched as they went through the Post-office\r\nthere:--specimens of which I saw; and the whole of which I might have\r\nseen, had it been worth the effort necessary. But Friedrich's London\r\nMinister, in this case, was a person of no significance or intimacy; and\r\nthe King's Letters, though strangely exact, clear and even elucidative\r\non English Court-Politics and vicissitudes, seemed to be nearly barren\r\nas to Prussian.] Hitherto, with one exception to be mentioned presently,\r\nhis main business seems to have been that of introducing, on different\r\nCourt-Days, a great number of Travelling English, who want to see the\r\nKing, and whom the King little wants, but quietly submits to. Incoherent\r\nSherlock, whom we discover to have been of the number, has, in his\r\ntawdry disjointed Book, this Passage:--\r\n\r\n\"The last time of my seeing him [this Hero-King of my heart] was at\r\nBerlin [not a hint of the time when]. He came thither to receive the\r\nadieus of the Baron de Swieten, Minister from their Imperial Majesties\r\n[thank you; that means 8th October, 1777 [Rodenbeck, iii. 172.]], and\r\nto give audience to the new Minister, the Count Cobenzl. The Foreign\r\nMinisters, the persons who were to be presented [we, for instance], and\r\nthe Military, were all that were at Court. We were ten English [thirteen\r\nby tale]: the King spoke to the first and the last; not on account of\r\ntheir situation, but because their names struck him. The first was Major\r\nDalrymple. To him the King said: 'You have been presented to me before?'\r\n'I ask your Majesty's pardon; it was my Uncle' (Lord Dalrymple, of\r\nwhom presently). Mr. Pitt [unknown to me which Pitt, subsequent Lord\r\nCamelford or another] was the last. THE KING: 'Are you a relation of\r\nLord Chatham's?' 'Yes, Sire.'--'He is a man whom I highly esteem' [read\r\n\"esteemed\"].\r\n\r\n\"He then went to the Foreign Ministers; and talked more to Prince\r\nDolgorucki, the Russian Ambassador, than to any other. In the midst of\r\nhis conversation with this Prince, he turned abruptly to Mr. Elliot, the\r\nEnglish Minister, and asked: 'What is the Duchess of Kingston's family\r\nname?' This transition was less Pindaric than it appears; he had just\r\nbeen speaking of the Court of Petersburg, and that Lady was then there.\"\r\n[Sherlock, ii. 27.] Whereupon Sherlock hops his ways again; leaving us\r\nconsiderably uncertain. But, by a curious accident, here, at first-hand,\r\nis confirmation of the flighty creature;--a Letter from Excellency\r\nElliot himself having come our way:--\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM EDEN, ESQUIRE (of the Foreign Office, London; Elliot's\r\nBrother-in-law; afterwards LORD AUCKLAND).\r\n\r\n\"BERLIN, 12th October, 1777.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR EDEN,--If you are waiting upon the pinnacle of all impatience\r\nto give me news from the Howes [out on their then famous \"Seizure of\r\nPhiladelphia,\" which came to what we know!], I am waiting with no less\r\nimpatience to receive it, and think every other subject too little\r\ninteresting to be mentioned. I must, however, tell you, the King has\r\nbeen here; [\"Came to Berlin 8th October,\" on the Van-Swieten errand;\r\n\"saw Princess Amelia twice; and on the 9th returned to Potsdam\"\r\n(Rodenbeck, iii. 172).] to the astonishment of all croakers, hearty and\r\nin high spirits. He was very civil to all of us. I was attended by one\r\ndozen English, which nearly completes my half-hundred this season.\r\nPitt made one of the twelve, and was particularly distinguished. KING:\r\n_\"Monsieur est-il parent de Mylord Chatham?'_ PITT: _'Oui, Sire.'_ KING:\r\n_'C'est un homme que j'ai beaucoup estime.'_\r\n\r\n\"You have no idea of the joy the people expressed to see the King on\r\nHorseback,--all the Grub-street nonsense of 'a Country groaning under\r\nthe weight of its burdens,' of 'a Nation governed with a rod of iron,'\r\nvanished before the sincere acclamations of all ranks, who joined in\r\ntestifying their enthusiasm for their great Monarch. I long for Harris\r\nand Company [Excellency Harris; making for Russia, I believe]; they are\r\nto pig together in my house; so that I flatter myself with having a near\r\nview, if not a taste, of connubial joys. My love to E and _e_ [your\r\nbig _E_leanor and your LITTLE, a baby in arms, who are my Sister and\r\nNiece;--pretty, this!]. Your most affectionate, H. E.\r\n\r\n\"P.S. I quite forgot to tell you, I sent out a servant some time ago\r\nto England to bring a couple of Horses. He will deliver some Packets to\r\nyou; which I beg you will send, with Lord Marischal's compliments, to\r\ntheir respective Addresses. There is also a china cup for Mr. Macnamara,\r\nLawyer, in the Temple or Lincoln's Inn, from the same person [lively old\r\ngentleman, age 91 gone; did die next year]. What does Eleanor mean about\r\nmy Congratulatory Letter to Lord Suffolk [our Foreign Secretary, on his\r\nmarriage lately]? I wished his Lordship, most sincerely, every happiness\r\nin his new state, as soon as I knew of it. I beg, however, Eleanor will\r\ndo the like;--and although it is not my system to 'congratulate' anybody\r\nupon marriage, yet I never fail to wish them what, I think, it is always\r\ntwo to one they do not obtain.\" [EDEN-HOUSE CORRESPONDENCE (part of\r\nwhich, not this, has been published in late years).]\r\n\r\nAs to the Dalrymple of SHERLOCK, read this (FRIEDRICH TO D'ALEMBERT, two\r\nyears before [_OEuvres de Frederic,_ xxv. 21: 5th August, 1775.]):...\r\n\"A Mylord of wonderful name [Lord Dalrymple, if I could remember it], of\r\namiable genius (AU NOM BAROQUE, A L'ESPRIT AIMABLE), gave me a Letter on\r\nyour part. 'Ah, how goes the Prince of Philosophers, then? Is he gay;\r\nis he busy; did you see him often?' To which the Mylord: 'I? No; I am\r\nstraight from London!'\"--\"QUOI DONC--?\" In short, knowing my Anaxagoras,\r\nthis Mylord preferred to be introduced by him; and was right: \"One of\r\nthe amiablest Englishmen I have seen; I except only the name, which I\r\nshall never remember [but do, on this new occasion]: Why doesn't he\r\nget himself unchristened of it, and take that of Stair, which equally\r\nbelongs to him?\" (Earl of Stair by and by; Nephew, or Grand-Nephew,\r\nof the great Earl of Stair, once so well known to some of us. Becomes\r\nEnglish Minister here in 1785, if we much cared.)\r\n\r\nThat word of reminiscence about Pitt is worth more attention. Not spoken\r\nlightly, but with meaning and sincerity; something almost pathetic\r\nin it, after the sixteen years separation: \"A man whom I much\r\nesteemed,\"--and had good reason to do so! Pitt's subsequent sad and\r\nbright fortunes, from the end of the Seven-Years War and triumphant\r\nsumming up of the JENKINS'S-EAR QUESTION, are known to readers. His\r\nBurton-Pynsent meed of honor (Estate of 3,000 pounds a year bequeathed\r\nhim by an aged Patriot, \"Let THIS bit of England go a noble road!\");\r\nhis lofty silences, in the World Political; his vehement attempts in it,\r\nwhen again asked to attempt, all futile,--with great pain to him, and\r\ngreat disdain from him:--his passionate impatiences on minor matters,\r\n\"laborers [ornamenting Burton-Pynsent Park, in Somersetshire] planting\r\ntrees by torchlight;\" \"kitchen people [at Hayes in North Kent, House\r\nstill to be seen] roasting a series of chickens, chicken after chicken\r\nall day, that at any hour, within ten minutes, my Lord may dine!\"--these\r\nthings dwell in the memory of every worthy reader. Here, saved from my\r\npoor friend Smelfungus (nobody knows how much of him I suppress), is a\r\nbrief jotting, in the form of rough MEMORANDA, if it be permissible:--\r\n\r\n\"Pitt four years King; lost in quicksands after that; off to Bath,\r\nfrom gout, from semi-insanity; 'India should pay, but how?' Lost in\r\nGeneral-Warrants, in Wilkes Controversies, American Revolts,--generally,\r\nin shallow quicksands;--dies at his post, but his post had become a\r\ndelirious one.\r\n\r\n\"A delicate, proud, noble man; pure as refined gold. Something\r\nsensitive, almost feminine in him; yet with an edge, a fire, a\r\nsteadiness; liker Friedrich, in some fine principal points, than any\r\nof his Contemporaries. The one King England has had, this King of Four\r\nYears, since the Constitutional system set in. Oliver Cromwell, yes\r\nindeed,--but he died, and there was nothing for it but to hang his body\r\non the gallows. Dutch William, too, might have been considerable,--but\r\nhe was Dutch, and to us proved to be nothing. Then again, so long as\r\nSarah Jennings held the Queen's Majesty in bondage, some gleams\r\nof Kinghood for us under Marlborough:--after whom Noodleism and\r\nSomnambulism, zero on the back of zero, and all our Affairs, temporal,\r\nspiritual and eternal, jumbling at random, which we call the Career of\r\nFreedom, till Pitt stretched out his hand upon them. For four years;\r\nnever again, he; never again one resembling him,--nor indeed can ever\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n\"Never, I should think. Pitts are not born often; this Pitt's ideas\r\ncould occur in the History of Mankind once only. Stranger theory of\r\nsociety, completely believed in by a clear, sharp and altogether human\r\nhead, incapable of falsity, was seldom heard of in the world. For King:\r\nopen your mouth, let the first gentleman that falls into it (a mass of\r\nHanover stolidity, stupidity, foreign to you, heedless of you) be King:\r\nSupreme Majesty he, with hypothetical decorations, dignities, solemn\r\nappliances, high as the stars (the whole, except the money, a mendacity,\r\nand sin against Heaven): him you declare Sent-of-God, supreme Captain of\r\nyour England; and having done so,--tie him up (according to Pitt) with\r\nConstitutional straps, so that he cannot stir hand or foot, for fear of\r\naccidents: in which state he is fully cooked; throw me at his Majesty's\r\nfeet, and let me bless Heaven for such a Pillar of Cloud by day.\r\n\r\n\"Pitt, closely as I could scrutinize, seems never to have doubted in\r\nhis noble heart but he had some reverence for George II. 'Reverenced\r\nhis Office,' says a simple reader? Alas, no, my friend, man does not\r\n'reverence Office,' but only sham-reverences it. I defy him to reverence\r\nanything but a Man filling an Office (with or without salary) nobly.\r\nFilling a noble office ignobly; doing a celestial task in a quietly\r\ninfernal manner? It were kinder perhaps to run your sword through him\r\n(or through yourself) than to take to revering him! If inconvenient\r\nto slay him or to slay yourself (as is oftenest likely),--keep well to\r\nwindward of him; be not, without necessity, partaker of his adventures\r\nin this extremely earnest Universe!...\r\n\r\n\"No; Nature does not produce many Pitts:--nor will any Pitt ever again\r\napply in Parliament for a career. 'Your voices, your most sweet voices;\r\nye melodious torrents of Gadarenes Swine, galloping rapidly down steep\r\nplaces, I, for one; know whither I'\"...--Enough.\r\n\r\nAbout four months before this time, Elliot had done a feat, not in\r\nthe Diplomatic line at all, or by his own choice at all, which had\r\nconsiderably astonished the Diplomatic world at Berlin, and was\r\ndoubtless well in the King's thoughts during this introduction of the\r\nDozen. The American War is raging and blundering along,--a delectable\r\nLord George Germaine (ALIAS Sackville, no other than our old Minden\r\nfriend) managing as War-Minister, others equally skilful presiding at\r\nthe Parliamentary helm; all becoming worse and worse off, as the matter\r\nproceeds. The revolted Colonies have their Franklins, Lees, busy in\r\nEuropean Courts: \"Help us in our noble struggle, ye European Courts;,\r\nnow is your chance on tyrannous England!\" To which France at least does\r\nappear to be lending ear. Lee, turned out from Vienna, is at work in\r\nBerlin, this while past; making what progress is uncertain to some\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nI know not whether it was by my Lord Suffolk's instigation, or what had\r\nput the Britannic Cabinet on such an idea,--perhaps the stolen Letters\r\nof Friedrich, which show so exact a knowledge of the current of events\r\nin America as well as England (\"knows every step of it, as if he\r\nwere there himself, the Arch-Enemy of honest neighbors in a time of\r\nstress!\")--but it does appear they had got it into their sagacious heads\r\nthat the bad neighbor at Berlin was, in effect, the Arch-Enemy, probably\r\nmainspring of the whole matter; and that it would be in the highest\r\ndegree interesting to see clearly what Lee and he had on hand. Order\r\nthereupon to Elliot: \"Do it, at any price;\" and finally, as mere price\r\nwill not answer, \"Do it by any method,--STEAL Lee's Despatch-Box for\r\nus!\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps few Excellencies living had less appetite for such a job than\r\nElliot; but his Orders were peremptory, \"Lee is a rebel, quasi-outlaw;\r\nand you must!\" Elliot thereupon took accurate survey of the matter; and\r\nrapidly enough, and with perfect skill, though still a novice in Berlin\r\naffairs, managed to do it. Privily hired, or made his servant hire, the\r\nchief Housebreaker or Pickpocket in the City: \"Lee lodges in such and\r\nsuch a Hostelry; bring us his Red-Box for a thirty hours; it shall\r\nbe well worth your while!\" And in brief space the Red-Box arrives,\r\naccordingly; a score or two of ready-writers waiting for it, who copy\r\nall day, all night, at the top of their speed, till they have enough:\r\nwhich done, the Lee Red-Box is left on the stairs of the Lee Tavern; Box\r\nlocked again, and complete; only the Friedrich-Lee Secrets completely\r\npumped out of it, and now rushing day and night towards England, to\r\nilluminate the Supreme Council-Board there.\r\n\r\nThis astonishing mass of papers is still extant in England; [In\r\nthe EDEN-HOUSE ARCHIVES; where a natural delicacy (unaware that the\r\nquestionable Legationary FACT stands in print for so many years past)\r\nis properly averse to any promulgation of them.]--the outside of them I\r\nhave seen, by no means the inside, had I wished it;--but am able to say\r\nfrom other sources, which are open to all the world, that seldom had a\r\nSupreme Council-Board procured for itself, by improper or proper ways,\r\na Discovery of less value! Discovery that Lee has indeed been urgent at\r\nBerlin; and has raised in Friedrich the question, \"Have you got to such\r\na condition that I can, with safety and advantage, make a Treaty of\r\nCommerce with you?\"--That his Minister Schulenburg has, by Order, been\r\ninvestigating Lee on that head; and has reported, \"No, your Majesty, Lee\r\nand People are not in such a condition;\" that his Majesty has replied,\r\n\"Well, let him wait till they are;\" and that Lee is waiting accordingly.\r\nIn general, That his Majesty is not less concerned in guidance or\r\nencouragement of the American War than he is in ditto of the Atlantic\r\nTides or of the East-Wind (though he does keep barometers and\r\nmeteorological apparatus by him); and that we of the Council-Board are\r\na--what shall I say! Not since the case of poor Dr. Cameron, in 1753,\r\nwhen Friedrich was to have joined the Highlanders with 15,000 chosen\r\nPrussians for Jacobite purposes,--and the Cham of Tartary to have taken\r\npart in the Bangorian Controversy,--was there a more perfect platitude,\r\nor a deeper depth of ignorance as to adjacent objects on the part of\r\nGoverning Men. For shame, my friends!--\r\n\r\nThis surprising bit of Burglary, so far as I can gather from the\r\nPrussian Books, must have been done on WEDNESDAY, JUNE 25th, 1777;\r\nBox (with essence pumped out) restored to staircase night of\r\nThursday,--Police already busy, Governor Ramin and Justice-President\r\nPhilippi already apprised, and suspicion falling on the English\r\nMinister,--whose Servant (\"Arrest him we cannot without a King's\r\nWarrant, only procurable at Potsdam!\") vanishes bodily. Friday, 27th,\r\nRamin and Philippi make report; King answers, \"greatly astonished:\" a\r\n\"GARSTIGE SACHE (ugly Business), which will do the English no honor:\"\r\n\"Servant fled, say you? Trace it to the bottom; swift!\" Excellency\r\nElliot, seeing how matters lay, owned honestly to the Official People,\r\nThat it was his Servant (Servant safe gone, Chief Pickpocket not\r\nmentioned at all); SUNDAY EVENING, 29th, King orders thereupon, \"Let the\r\nmatter drop.\" These Official Pieces, signed by the King, by Hertzberg,\r\nRamin and others, we do not give: here is Friedrich's own notice of it\r\nto his Brother Henri:--\r\n\r\n\"POTSDAM, 29th JUNE, 1777.... There has just occurred a strange thing\r\nat Berlin. Three days ago, in absence of the Sieur Lee, Envoy of the\r\nAmerican Colonies, the Envoy of England went [sent!] to the Inn where\r\nLee lodged, and carried off his Portfolio; it seems he was in fear,\r\nhowever, and threw it down, without opening it, on the stairs [alas,\r\nno, your Majesty, not till after pumping the essence out]. All Berlin is\r\ntalking of it. If one were to act with rigor, it would be necessary to\r\nforbid this man the Court, since he has committed a public theft: but,\r\nnot to make a noise, I suppress the thing. Sha'n't fail, however, to\r\nwrite to England about it, and indicate that there was another way of\r\ndealing with such a matter, for they are impertinent\" (say, ignorant,\r\nblind as moles, your Majesty; that is the charitable reading!).\r\n[_OEuvres de Frederic,_ xxvi. 394. In PREUSS, v. (he calls it \"iv.\" or\r\n\"URKUNDENBUCH to vol. iv.,\" but it is really and practically vol. v.)\r\n278, 279, are the various Official Reports.]\r\n\r\nThis was not Excellency Elliot's Burglary, as readers see,--among all\r\nthe Excellencies going, I know not that there is one with less natural\r\nappetite for such a job; but sometimes what can a necessitous Excellency\r\ndo? Elliot is still remembered in Berlin society, not for this only,\r\nbut for emphatic things of a better complexion which he did; a man more\r\njustly estimated there, than generally here in our time. Here his chief\r\nfame rests on a witty Anecdote, evidently apocryphal, and manufactured\r\nin the London Clubs: \"Who is this Hyder-Ali,\" said the old King to him,\r\none day (according to the London Clubs). \"Hm,\" answered Elliot, with\r\nexquisite promptitude, politeness and solidity of information, \"C'EST UN\r\nVIEUX VOLEUR QUI COMMENCE A RADOTER (An old robber, now falling into his\r\ndotage),\"--let his dotard Majesty take that.\r\n\r\nAlas, my friends!--Ignorance by herself is an awkward lumpish wench;\r\nnot yet fallen into vicious courses, nor to be uncharitably treated: but\r\nIgnorance and Insolence,--these are, for certain, an unlovely Mother and\r\nBastard! Yes;--and they may depend upon it, the grim Parish-beadles\r\nof this Universe are out on the track of them, and oakum and the\r\ncorrection-house are infallible sooner or later! The clever Elliot, who\r\nknew a hawk from a hernshaw, never floundered into that platitude. This,\r\nhowever, is a joke of his, better or worse (I think, on his quitting\r\nBerlin in 1782, without visible resource or outlook): \"I am far from\r\nhaving a Sans-Souci,\" writes he to the Edens; \"and I think I am coming\r\nto be SANS SIX-SOUS.\"--Here still are two small Fractions, which I must\r\ninsert; and then rigorously close. Kaiser Joseph, in these months, is\r\ntravelling through France to instruct his Imperial mind. The following\r\nis five weeks anterior to that of Lee's Red-Box:--\r\n\r\n1. A BIT OF DIALOGUE AT PARIS (Saturday, 17th May, 1777). After solemn\r\nSession of the ACADEMIE FRANCAISE, held in honor of an illustrious COMTE\r\nDE FALKENSTEIN (privately, Kaiser Joseph II.), who has come to look at\r\nFrance, [Minute and rather entertaining Account of his procedures there,\r\nand especially of his two Visits to the Academy (first was May 10th),\r\nin Mayer, _Reisen Josephs II._ (Leipzig, 1778), pp. 112-132, 147\r\net seq.]--Comte de Falkenstein was graciously pleased to step up to\r\nD'Alembert, who is Perpetual Secretary here; and this little Dialogue\r\nensued:--\r\n\r\nFALKENSTEIN. \"I have heard you are for Germany this season; some say you\r\nintend to become German altogether?\"\r\n\r\nD'ALEMBERT. \"I did promise myself the high honor of a visit to his\r\nPrussian Majesty, who has deigned to invite me, with all the kindness\r\npossible: but, alas, for such hopes! The bad state of my health--\"\r\n\r\nFALKENSTEIN. \"It seems to me you have already been to see the King of\r\nPrussia?\"\r\n\r\nD'ALEMBERT. \"Two times; once in 1756 [1755, 17th-19th June,--if you will\r\nbe exact], at Wesel, when I remained only a few days; and again in 1763,\r\nwhen I had the honor to pass three or four months with him. Since that\r\ntime I have always longed to have the honor of seeing his Majesty again;\r\nbut circumstances hindered me. I, above all, regretted not to have been\r\nable to pay my court to him that year he saw the Emperor at Neisse,--but\r\nat this moment there is nothing more to be wished on that head\" (Don't\r\nbow: the Gentleman is INCOGNITO).\r\n\r\nFALKENSTEIN. \"It was very natural that the Emperor, young, and desiring\r\nto instruct himself, should wish to see such a Prince as the King of\r\nPrussia; so great a Captain, a Monarch of such reputation, and who has\r\nplayed so great a part. It was a Scholar going to see his Master\" (these\r\nare his very words, your Majesty).\r\n\r\nD'ALEMBERT. \"I wish M. le Comte de Falkenstein could see the Letters\r\nwhich the King of Prussia did me the honor to write after that\r\nInterview: it would then appear how this Prince judged of the Emperor,\r\nas all the world has since done.\" [\"D'Alembert to Friedrich [in _OEuvres\r\nde Frederic,_ xxv. 75], 23d May, 1777.\" Ib. xxv. 82; \"13th August,\r\n1777.\"]\r\n\r\nKING TO D'ALEMBERT (three months after. Kaiser is home; passed Ferney,\r\nearly in August; and did not call on Voltaire, as is well known).... \"I\r\nhear the Comte de Falkenstein has been seeing harbors, arsenals, ships,\r\nmanufactures, and has n't seen Voltaire. Had I been in the Emperor's\r\nplace, I would not have passed Ferney without a glance at the old\r\nPatriarch, were it only to say that I had seen and heard him. Arsenals,\r\nships, manufactures, these you can see anywhere; but it requires ages\r\nto produce a Voltaire. By the rumors I hear, it will have been a certain\r\ngreat Lady Theresa, very Orthodox and little Philosophical, who forbade\r\nher Son to visit the Apostle of Tolerance.\"\r\n\r\nD'ALEMBERT (in answer): \"No doubt your Majesty's guess is right. It must\r\nhave been the Lady Mother. Nobody here believes that the advice came\r\nfrom his Sister [Queen Marie Antoinette], who, they say, is full of\r\nesteem for the Patriarch, and has more than once let him know it by\r\nthird parties.\" [_OEuvres de Frederic,_ xxv. 84.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Friedrich, Joseph's reflections in France were very gloomy:\r\n\"This is all one Country; strenuously kneaded into perfect union and\r\nincorporation by the Old Kings: my discordant Romish Reich is of\r\nmany Countries,--and should be of one, if Sovereigns were wise and\r\nstrenuous!\" [_OEuvres de Frederic,_ vi. 125.]\r\n\r\n2. A CABINET-ORDER AND ACTUAL (fac-simile) SIGNATURE OF\r\nFRIEDRICH'S.--After unknown travels over the world, this poor brown Bit\r\nof Paper, with a Signature of Friedrich's to it, has wandered hither;\r\nand I have had it copied, worthy or not. A Royal Cabinet-Order on the\r\nsmallest of subjects; but perhaps all the more significant on that\r\naccount; and a Signature which readers may like to see.\r\n\r\nFordan, or Fordon, is in the Bromberg Department in West\r\nPreussen,--Bromberg no longer a heap of ruins; but a lively,\r\nnew-built, paved, CANALLED and industrious trading Town. At Fordan is a\r\nGrain-Magazine: Bein (\"Leg,\" DER BEIN, as they slightingly call him) is\r\nProviant-Master there; and must consider his ways,--the King's eye being\r\non him. Readers can now look and understand:--\r\n\r\n\r\nAN DEN OBER-PROVIANTMEISTER BEIN, zu Fordan.\r\n\r\n\"POTSDAM, den 9ten April, 1777.\r\n\r\n_\"Seiner Koniglicher Majestat von Preussen, Unser allergnadigster Herr,\r\nlassen dem Ober-Proviantmeister Bein hiebey die Getraide-Preistabelle\r\ndes Brombergschen Departments zufertigen; Woraus derselbe ersiehet\r\nwie niedrig solche an einigen Orthen sind, und dass zu Inovraclaw und\r\nStrezeltnow der Scheffel Roggen um 12 Groschen kostet: da solches nun\r\nhier so wohlfeil ist, somuss ja der Preis in Pohlen noch wohl geringer,\r\nund ist daher nicht abzusehen warum die Pohlen auf so hohe Preise\r\nbestehen; der Bein muss sich daher nun rechte Muhe gebem, und den\r\nEinkauf so wohlfeil als nur immer mog_ lich zu machen suchen.\"\r\n\r\n\"His Royal Majesty of Preussen, Our most all-gracious Lord, lets\r\nherewith, to the Head Proviant-Master Bein, the Grain-Prices Table of\r\nthe Bromberg Department be despatched; Wherefrom Bein perceives how low\r\nin some places these are, and that, at Inovraclaw and Strezeltnow the\r\nBushel of Rye costs about 14 Pence: now, as it is so cheap there, the\r\nprice in Poland must be still smaller; and therefore it is not to be\r\nconceived why the Poles demand such high prices,\" as the said Bein\r\nreports: \"Bein therefore is charged to take especial pains, and try not\r\nto make the purchase dearer than is indispensable.\"\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH'S SIGNATURE HERE--PAGE 390, BOOK XXI----\r\n\r\n[Reference re signature] Original kindly furnished me by Mr. W. H. Doeg,\r\nBarlow Moor, Manchester: whose it now is,--purchased in London, A.D.\r\n1863. The FRH of German CURSIV-SCHRIFT (current hand), which the\r\nwoodcutter has appended, shut off by a square, will show English readers\r\nwhat the King means: an _\"Frh\"_ done as by a flourish of one's stick,\r\nin the most compendious and really ingenious manner,--suitable for an\r\neconomic King, who has to repeat it scores of times every day of his\r\nlife!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI.--THE BAVARIAN WAR.\r\n\r\nAt the very beginning of 1778, the chronic quarrel with Austria passed,\r\nby an accident just fallen out, into the acute state; rose\r\ngradually, and, in spite of negotiating, issued in a thing called\r\nBavarian-Succession War, which did not end till Spring of the following\r\nyear. The accident was this. At Munchen, December 30th, 1777, Max\r\nJoseph Kurfurst of Baiern, only Brother of our lively friend the\r\nElectress-Dowager of Saxony, died; suddenly, of small-pox unskilfully\r\ntreated. He was in his fifty-second year; childless, the last of that\r\nBavarian branch. His Heir is Karl Theodor, Kur-Pfalz (Elector Palatine),\r\nwho is now to unite the Two Electorates,--unless Austria can bargain\r\nwith him otherwise. Austria's desire to get hold of Baiern is of very\r\nold standing; and we have heard lately how much it was an object with\r\nKaunitz and his young Kaiser. With Karl Theodor they did bargain,--in\r\nfact, had beforehand as good as bargained,--and were greatly astonished,\r\nwhen King Friedrich, alone of all Teutschland or the world, mildly, but\r\nperemptorily, interfered, and said No,--with effect, as is well known.\r\n\r\nSomething, not much, must be said of this Bavarian-Succession War; which\r\noccupied, at a pitch of tension and anxiety foreign to him for a long\r\ntime, fifteen months of Friedrich's old age (January, 1778-March, 1779);\r\nand filled all Europe round him and it, in an extraordinary manner.\r\nSomething; by no means much, now that we have seen the issue of such\r\nmountains all in travail. Nobody could then say but it bade fair to\r\nbecome a Fourth Austrian-Prussian War, as sanguinary as the Seven-Years\r\nhad been; for in effect there stood once more the Two Nations ranked\r\nagainst each other, as if for mortal duel, near half a million men in\r\nwhole; parleying indeed, but brandishing their swords, and ever and anon\r\ngiving mutual clash of fence, as if the work had begun, though there\r\nalways intervened new parleying first.\r\n\r\nAnd now everybody sees that the work never did begin; that parleying,\r\nenforced by brandishing, turned out to be all the work there was: and\r\neverybody has forgotten it, and, except for specific purposes, demands\r\nnot to be put in mind of it. Mountains in labor were not so frequent\r\nthen as now, when the Penny Newspaper has got charge of them; though\r\nthen as now to practical people they were a nuisance. Mountains all in\r\nterrific travail-throes, threatening to overset the solar system, have\r\nalways a charm, especially for the more foolish classes: but when once\r\nthe birth has taken place, and the wretched mouse ducks past you,\r\nor even nothing at all can be seen to duck past, who is there but\r\nimpatiently turns on his heel?\r\n\r\nThose Territories, which adjoin on its own dominions, would have been\r\nextremely commodious to Austria;--as Austria itself has long known; and\r\nby repeatedly attempting them on any chance given (as in 1741-1745, to\r\ngo no farther back), has shown how well it knows. Indeed, the whole\r\nof Bavaria fairly incorporated and made Austrian, what an infinite\r\nconvenience would it be!\r\n\r\n\"Do but look on the Map [this Note is not by Busching, but by somebody\r\nof Austrian tendencies]: you would say, Austria without Bavaria is like\r\na Human Figure with its belly belonging to somebody else. Bavaria is the\r\ntrunk or belly of the Austrian Dominions, shutting off all the limbs of\r\nthem each from the other; making for central part a huge chasm.\r\n\r\n\"Ober-Pfalz,--which used to be Kur-Pfalz's, which is Bavaria's since we\r\ntook it from the Winter-King and bestowed it in that way,--Ober-Pfalz,\r\nthe country of Amberg, where Maillebois once pleased to make invasion of\r\nus;--does not it adjoin on the Bohemian Forest? The RIBS there, Bohemian\r\nall, up to the shoulder, are ours: but the shoulder-blade and left\r\narm, whose are they! Austria Proper and Hungary, these may be taken as\r\nsitting-part and lower limbs, ample and fleshy; but see, just above the\r\npelvis, on the south side, how Bavaria and its Tyrol sticks itself\r\nin upon Austria, who fancied she also had a Tyrol, and far the more\r\nimportant one. Our Tyrol, our Styria, Carniola, Carinthia,--Bavaria\r\nblocks these in. Then the Swabian Austria,--Breisach, and those\r\nUpper-Rhine Countries, from which we invade France,--we cannot reach\r\nthem except through Bavarian ground. Swabian Austria should be our right\r\narm, fingers of it reaching into Switzerland; Ober-Pfalz our left:--and\r\nas to the broad breast between these two; left arm and broad breast\r\nare Bavaria's, not ours. Of the Netherlands, which might be called\r\ngeographically the head of Austria, alas, the long neck, Lorraine, was\r\nonce ours; but whose is it? Irrecoverable for the present,--perhaps may\r\nnot always be so!\"\r\n\r\nThese are Kaunitz's ideas; and the young Kaiser has eagerly adopted them\r\nas the loadstar of his life. \"Make the Reich a reality again,\" thinks\r\nthe Kaiser (good, if only possible, think we too); \"make Austria great;\r\nAustria is the Reich, how else can the Reich be real?\"\r\n\r\nIn practical politics these are rather wild ideas; but they are really\r\nKaunitz's and his Kaiser's; and were persisted in long after this\r\nBavarian matter got its check: and as a whole, they got repeated checks;\r\nbeing impossible all, and far from the meaning of a Time big with French\r\nRevolution, and with quite other things than world-greatness to Austria,\r\nand rejuvenescence on such or on any terms to the poor old Holy Roman\r\nReich, which had been a wiggery so long. Nobody could guess of what it\r\nwas that France or the world might be with child: nobody, till the birth\r\nin 1789, and even for a generation afterwards. France is weakly and\r\nunwieldy, has strange enough longings for chalky, inky, visionary,\r\nfoolish substances, and may be in the family-way for aught we know.\r\n\r\nTo Kaunitz it is pretty clear that France will not stand in his path\r\nin this fine little Bavarian business; which is all he cares for at\r\npresent. England in war with its Colonies; Russia attentive to its Turk;\r\nforeign Nations, what can they do but talk; remonstrate more or less, as\r\nthey did in the case of Poland; and permit the thing with protest? Only\r\nfrom one Sovereign Person, and from him I should guess not much, does\r\nKaunitz expect serious opposition: from Friedrich of Prussia; to whom\r\nno enlargement of Austria can be matter of indifference. \"But cannot we\r\nperhaps make it worth his while?\" thinks Kaunitz: \"Tush, he is old and\r\nbroken; thought to be dying; has an absolute horror of war. He too will\r\nsit quiet; or we must make it worth his while.\" In this calculation\r\nKaunitz deceived himself; we are now shortly to see how.\r\n\r\nKaunitz's Case, when he brings it before the Reich, and general Public\r\nof mankind and its Gazetteers, will by no means prove to be a strong\r\none. His Law \"TITLE\" is this:--\r\n\r\n\"Archduke Albert V., of Austria, subsequently Kaiser Albert II., had\r\nmarried Elizabeth, only Daughter of Kaiser Sigismund SUPER-GRAMMATICAM:\r\nAlbert is he who got three crowns in one year, Hungary, Bohemia, Romish\r\nReich; and 'we hope a fourth,' say the Old Historians, 'which was a\r\nheavenly and eternal one,'--died, in short (1439, age forty). From him\r\ncome the now Kaisers.\r\n\r\n\"In 1426, thirteen years before this event of the Crowns, Sigismund\r\nGRAMMATICAM had infeoffed him in a thing still of shadowy nature,--the\r\nExpectancy of a Straubingen Princedom; pleasant extensive District,\r\nonly not yet fallen, or like falling vacant: 'You shall inherit, you\r\nand yours (who are also my own), so soon as this present line of\r\nWittelsbachers die!' said Kaiser Sigismund, solemnly, in two solemn\r\nsheepskins. 'Not a whit of it,' would the Wittelsbachers have answered,\r\nhad they known of the affair. 'When we die out, there is another Line of\r\nWittelsbachers, plenty of other lines; and House-treaties many and old,\r\nsettling all that, without help of you and Albert of the Three Crowns!'\r\nAnd accordingly there had never come the least fruit, or attempt at\r\nfruit, from these two Sigismund Sheepskins; which were still lying in\r\nthe Vienna Archives, where they had lain since the creation of them,\r\nknown to an Antiquary or two, but not even by them thought worthy\r\nof mention in this busy world. This was literally all the claim that\r\nAustria had; and every by-stander admitted it to be, in itself, not\r\nworth a rush.\"\r\n\r\n\"In itself perhaps not,\" thought Kaunitz; \"but the free consent of Karl\r\nTheodor the Heir, will not that be a Title in full? One would hope so;\r\nin the present state of Europe: France, England, Russia, every Nation\r\nweltering overhead in its own troubles and affairs, little at leisure\r\nfor ours!\" And it is with Karl Theodor, to make out a full Title for\r\nhimself there, that Kaunitz has been secretly busy this long time back,\r\nespecially in the late critical days of poor Kurfurst Max.\r\n\r\nKarl Theodor of the Pfalz, now fallen Heir to Baiern, is a poor idle\r\ncreature, of purely egoistic, ornamental, dilettante nature; sunk in\r\ntheatricals, bastard children and the like; much praised by Voltaire,\r\nwho sometimes used to visit him; and by Collini, to whom he is a kind\r\nmaster. Karl Theodor cares little for the integrity of Baiern, much\r\nfor that of his own skin. Very long ago, in 1742, in poor Kaiser Karl's\r\nCoronation time, we saw him wedded, him and another, to two fair Sister\r\nSulzbach Princesses, [Supra, viii. 119.] Grand-daughters of old Karl\r\nPhilip, the then Kur-Pfalz, whom he has inherited. It was the last act\r\nof that never-resting old Karl Philip, of whom we used to hear so\r\nmuch: \"Karl Theodor to have one of my inestimable Grand-daughters; Duke\r\nClement, younger Brother of our blessed new Kaiser, to have another;\r\nthereby we unite the kindred branches of the Pfalz-Baiern Families, and\r\nmake the assurance of the Heritages doubly sure!\" said old Karl Philip;\r\nand died happy, or the happiest he could.\r\n\r\nReaders no doubt have forgotten this circumstance; and, in their total\r\nlack of interest in Karl Theodor and his paltry affairs, may as well\r\nbe reminded of it;--and furthermore, that these brilliant young Wives,\r\n\"Duchess Clement\" especially, called on Wilhelmina during the Frankfurt\r\nGayeties, and were a charm to Kaiser Karl Albert, striving to look\r\nforward across clouds into a glittering future for his House. Theodor's\r\nPrincess brought him no children; she and her Sister are both still\r\nliving; a lone woman the latter (Duke Clement dead these seven\r\nyears),--a still more lone the former, with such a Husband yet living!\r\nLone women both, well forward in the fifties; active souls, I should\r\nguess, at least to judge by Duchess Clement, who being a Dowager, and\r\nmistress of her movements, is emphatic in denouncing such disaster and\r\ndisgrace; and plays a great part, at Munchen, in the agitating\r\nscenes now on hand. Comes out \"like a noble Amazon,\" say the admiring\r\nby-standers, on this occasion; stirs whatever faculty she has,\r\nespecially her tongue; and goes on urging, pushing and contriving all\r\nshe can, regardless of risks in such an imminency.\r\n\r\nKarl Theodor finds his Heritages indisputable; but he has no Legitimate\r\nSon to leave them to; and has many Illegitimate, whom Austria can\r\nprovide for,--and richly will. His Heir is a Nephew, Karl August\r\nChristian, of Zweibruck; whom perhaps it would not be painful to him\r\nto disappoint a little of his high expectations. On the whole, Peace;\r\nplentiful provision, titular and other, for his Illegitimates; and\r\na comfortable sum of ready money over, to enliven the Theatricals,\r\nDusseldorf Picture-Galleries and Dilettante operations and\r\nCollections,--how much welcomer to Theodor than a Baiern never so\r\nreligiously saved entire at the expense of quarrel, which cannot but be\r\ntedious, troublesome and dangerous! Honor, indeed--but what, to an old\r\nstager in the dilettante line, is honor? Old stagers there are who will\r\nown to you, like Balzac's Englishman in a case of conflagration, when\r\nhonor called on all men to take their buckets, \"MAIS JE N'AI POINT\r\nD'HONNEUR!\" To whom, unluckily, you cannot answer as in that case,\r\n\"C'EST EGAL, 'T is all one; do as if you had some!\" Karl Theodor\r\nscandalously left Baiern to its fate.\r\n\r\nKarl Theodor's Heir, poor August Christian of Zweibruck, had of course\r\nhis own gloomy thoughts on this parcelling of his Bavarian reversion:\r\nbut what power has he? None, he thinks, but to take the inevitable\r\npatiently. Nor generally in the Princes of the Reich, though one would\r\nhave thought them personally concerned, were it only for danger of a\r\nlike mistreatment, was there any emotion publicly expressed, or the\r\nleast hope of help. \"Perhaps Prussia will quarrel about it?\" think they:\r\n\"Austria, Prussia, in any of their quarrels we get only crushed; better\r\nto keep out of it. We well out of it, the more they quarrel and fight,\r\nthe better for us!\" England, in the shape of Hanover, would perhaps have\r\nmade some effort to interfere, provided France did: on either side, I\r\nincline to think,--that is to say, on the side opposite to France. But\r\npoor England is engaged with its melancholy American War; France on the\r\npoint of breaking out into Alliance with the Insurrection there. Neither\r\nFrance nor England did interfere. France is sinking into bankruptcy;\r\nintent to have a Navy before most things; to assist the Cause of Human\r\nLiberty over seas withal, and become a sublime spectacle, and a ruin to\r\nEngland,--not as in the Pitt-Choiseul time, but by that improved method.\r\nRussia, again involved in Turk business, looks on, with now and then\r\na big word thrown out on the one side and the other.--Munchen, in the\r\ninterval, we can fancy what an agitated City! One Note says:--\r\n\r\n\"Kurfurst Max Joseph being dead (30th December, 1777), Privy Councillor\r\nJohann Euchar von Obermayr, favorite and factotum Minister of the\r\nDeceased, opened the Chatoulle [Princely Safe, or Case of Preciosities];\r\ntook from it the Act, which already lay prepared, for Homaging and\r\nsolemn Instalment of Karl Theodor Kur-Pfalz, as heir of Baiern; with\r\nimmediate intent to execute the same. Euchar orders strict closure\r\nof the Town-gates; the Soldiery to draw out, and beset all\r\nstreets,--especially that street where Imperial Majesty's Ambassador\r\nlives: 'Rank close with your backs to that House,' orders Euchar; 'and\r\nthe instant anybody stirs to come out, sound your drums, and, at the\r\nsame instant, let the rearmost rank of you, without looking round [for\r\none would not give offence, unless imperative] smite the butts of their\r\nmuskets to the ground' (ready for firing, IF imperative). Nobody, I\r\nthink, stirred out from that Austrian Excellency's House; in any case,\r\nObermayr completed his Act without the least protest or trouble from\r\nanybody; and Karl Theodor, almost to his terror [for he meant to sell,\r\nand satisfy Austria, by no means to resist or fight, the paltry old\r\ncreature, careful of self and skin only], saw himself solemnly secured\r\nby all forms of law in all the Lands of the Deceased. [Fischer,\r\n_Geschichte Friedrichs des Zweiten_ (Halle, 1787), ii. 358.]\r\n\r\n\"Kaiser Joseph, in a fume at this, shot off an express to Bohemia: 'Such\r\nand such regiments, ten or twelve of you, with your artillery and tools,\r\nmarch instantly into Straubingen, and occupy that Town and District.'\r\nAt Vienna, to the Karl-Theodor Ambassador, the Kaunitz Officials were\r\naltogether loud-voiced, minatory: 'What is this, Herr Excellenz? Bargain\r\nalready made; lying ready for mere signature; and at Munchen such\r\ndoings. Sign this Bargain, or there cross your frontier 60,000 Austrian\r\nmen, and seize both Baiern and the Ober-Pfalz; bethink you, Herr!' The\r\npoor Herr bethought him, what could he do? signed the Bargain, Karl\r\nTheodor sanctioning, 3d January, 1778,--the fourth day after Obermayr's\r\nHomaging feat;--and completes the first act of this bad business. The\r\nBargain, on Theodor's side, was of the most liberal kind: All and\r\nsundry the Lands and Circles of Duke Johann of Straubingen, Lordship\r\nof Mindelheim [Marlborough's old Place] superadded, and I know not what\r\nelse; Sovereignty of the Fiefs in Ober-Pfalz to lapse to the Crown of\r\nBohmen on my decease.\" Half Bavaria, or better; some reckon it as good\r\nas two-thirds.\r\n\r\nThe figure of Duchess Clement, Amazon in hair-powder, driviug\r\nincessantly about among the officialities and aristocratic circles;\r\nthis and the order of \"Rattle your muskets on the ground;\" let these\r\ntwo features represent to us the Munchen of those months. Munchen,\r\nRegensburg, Vienna are loud with pleading, protocolling; but it is not\r\nthere that the crisis of the game will be found to lie.\r\n\r\nFriedrich has, for some time back, especially since the late\r\nKur-Baiern's illness, understood that Austria, always eager for a clutch\r\nat Baiern, had something of that kind in view; but his first positive\r\nnews of it was a Letter from Duchess Clement (date, JANUARY 3d), which,\r\nby the detail of facts, unveiled to his quick eye the true outline,\r\nextent and nature of this Enterprise of Austria's; Enterprise which, he\r\ncould not but agree with Duchess Clement, was one of great concernment\r\nnot to Baiern alone. \"Must be withstood; prevented, at whatever risk,\"\r\nthought Friedrich on the instant: \"The new Elector, Karl Theodor, he\r\nprobably is dead to the matter; but one ought to ask him. If he answer,\r\nDead; then ask his Heir, Have you no life to it?\" Heir is a gallant\r\nenough young gentleman, of endless pedigree, but small possessions,\r\n\"Karl August Christian [Karl II. in Official style], Duke of\r\nZweibruck-Birkenfeld,\" Karl Theodor's eldest Nephew; Friedrich judges\r\nthat he probably will have haggled to sign any Austrian convention for\r\ndismembering Baiern, and that he will start into life upon it so soon as\r\nhe sees hope.\r\n\r\n\"A messenger to him, to Karl Theodor and him,\" thinks Friedrich: \"a\r\nmessenger instantly; and who?\" For that clearly is the first thing. And\r\na delicate thing it is; requiring to be done in profoundest secrecy,\r\nby hint and innuendo rather than speech; by somebody in a cloak of\r\ndarkness, who is of adroit quality, and was never heard of in diplomatic\r\ncircles before, not to be suspected of having business of mine on hand.\r\nFriedrich bethinks him that in a late visit to Weimar, he had noticed,\r\nfor his fine qualities, a young gentleman named Gortz; Eustace von\r\nGortz, [Preuss, iv. 92 n. &c.] late Tutor to the young Duke (Karl\r\nAugust, whom readers know as Goethe's friend): a wise, firm,\r\nadroit-looking young gentleman; who was farther interesting as Brother\r\nto Lieutenant-General von Gortz, a respectable soldier of Friedrich's.\r\nEx-Tutor at Weimar, we say, and idle for the moment; hanging about Court\r\nthere, till he should find a new function.\r\n\r\nOf this Ex-Tutor Friedrich bethinks him; and in the course of that\r\nsame day,--for there is no delay,--Friedrich, who is at Berlin, beckons\r\nGeneral Gortz to come over to him from Potsdam instantly. \"Hither this\r\nevening; and in all privacy meet me in the Palace at such an hour\"\r\n(hour of midnight or thereby); which of course Gortz, duly invisible\r\nto mankind, does. Friedrich explains: An errand to Munchen; perfectly\r\nsecret, for the moment, and requiring great delicacy and address;\r\nperhaps not without risk, a timorous man might say: will your Brother\r\ngo for me, think you? Gortz thinks he will. \"Here is his Instruction, if\r\nso,\" adds the King, handing him an Autograph of the necessary outline\r\nof procedure,--not signed, nor with any credential, or even specific\r\naddress, lest accident happen. \"Adieu then, Herr General-Lieutenant;\r\nrule is, shoes of swiftness, cloak of darkness: adieu!\" And Gortz Senior\r\nis off on the instant, careering towards Weimar, where he finds Gortz\r\nJunior, and makes known his errand. Gortz Junior stares in the natural\r\nastonishment; but, after some intense brief deliberation, becomes\r\naffirmative, and in a minimum of time is ready and on the road.\r\n\r\nGortz Junior proved to have been an excellent choice on the King's part;\r\nand came to good promotion afterwards by his conduct in this affair.\r\nGortz Junior started for Munchen on the instant, masked utterly, or\r\nhis business masked, from profane eyes; saw this person, saw that, and\r\nglided swiftly about, swiftly and with sure aim; and speedily kindled\r\nthe matter, and had smoke rising in various points. And before January\r\nwas out, saw the Reichs-Diet at Regensburg, much more the general\r\nGazetteerage everywhere, seized of this affair, and thrown into\r\nparoxysms at the size and complexion of it: saw, in fact, a world\r\ngetting into flame,--kindled by whom or what nobody could guess, for\r\na long time to come. Gortz had great running about in his cloak of\r\ndarkness, and showed abundant talent of the kind needed. A pushing,\r\nclear-eyed, stout-hearted man; much cleverness and sureness in what\r\nhe did and forbore to do. His adventures were manifold; he had much\r\ntravelling about: was at Regensburg, at Mannheim; saw many persons\r\nwhom he had to judge of on the instant, and speak frankly to, or speak\r\ndarkly, or speak nothing; and he made no mistake. One of his best\r\ncounsellors, I gather, was Duchess Clement: of course it was not long\r\ntill Duchess Clement heard some inkling of him; till, in some of his\r\ngoings and comings, he saw Duchess Clement, who hailed him as an angel\r\nof light. In one journey more mysterious than ever, \"he was three\r\ndays invisible in Duchess Clement's Garden-house.\" \"AH, MADAME, QUE\r\nN'ETIEZ-VOUS ELECTEUR, Why were not you Elector!\" writes Friedrich to\r\nher once: \"We should not have seen those shameful events, which every\r\ngood German must blush for, to the bottom of his heart (DONT TOUT BON\r\nALLEMAND DOIT ROUGIR JUSQU'AU FOND DU COEUR)!\" [Preuss, iv. 94.]\r\n\r\nWe cannot afford the least narrative of Gortz and his courses:\r\nimagination, from a few traits, will sufficiently conceive them. He had\r\ngone first to Karl Theodor's Minister: \"Dead to it, I fear; has already\r\nsigned?\" Alas, yes. Upon which to Zweibruck the Heir's Minister; whom\r\nhis Master had distinctly ordered to sign, but who, at his own peril,\r\ngallant man, delayed, remonstrated, had not yet done it; and was able\r\nto answer: \"Alive to it, he? Yes, with a witness, were there hope in\r\nthe world!\"--which threw Gortz upon instant gallop towards Zweibruck\r\nSchloss, in search of said Heir, the young Duke August Christian; who,\r\nhowever, had left in the interim (summoned by his Uncle, on Austrian\r\nurgency, to consent along with him); but whom Gortz, by dexterity and\r\nintuition of symptoms, caught up by the road, with what a mutual joy!\r\nAs had been expected, August Christian, on sight of Gortz, with an armed\r\nFriedrich looming in the distance, took at once into new courses and\r\nactivities. From him, no consent now; far other: Treaty with Friedrich;\r\nflat refusal ever to consent: application to the Reich, application even\r\nto France, and whatever a gallant young fellow could do.\r\n\r\nIt was by Friedrich's order that he applied to France; his younger\r\nBrother, Max Joseph, was a soldier there, and strove to back him in\r\nOfficial and other circles,--who were all friendly, even zealous for\r\nhim; and gave good words, but had nothing more. This French department\r\nof the business was long a delay to Friedrich's operations: and in\r\nresult, poor Max's industry there, do what he could, proved rather a\r\nminus quantity than otherwise. A good young man, they say; but not\r\nthe man to kindle into action horses that are dead,--of which he had\r\nexperience more than once in time coming. He is the same that, 30 years\r\nafter, having survived his childless elder Brother, became King Max,\r\nfirst King of Baiern; begot Ludwig, second King,--who, for his part,\r\nhas begotten Otho King of Greece, and done other feats still less\r\nworth mentioning. August Christian's behavior is praised as\r\nexcellent,--passively firm and polite; the grand requisite, persistence\r\non your ground of \"No:\"--but his luck, to find such a Friedrich, and\r\nalso to find such a Gortz, was the saving clause for him.\r\n\r\nFriedrich was in very weak health in these months; still considered by\r\nthe Gazetteers to be dying. But it appears he is not yet too weak for\r\ntaking, on the instant necessary, a world-important resolution; and\r\nof being on the road with it, to this issue or to that, at full speed\r\nbefore the day closed. \"Desist, good neighbor, I beseech you. You must\r\ndesist, and even you shall:\" this resolution was entirely his own; as\r\nwere the equally prompt arrangements he contrived for executing it,\r\nshould hard come to hard, and Austria prefer war to doing justice.\r\n\"Excellent methods,\" say the most unfriendly judges, \"which must at\r\nonce have throttled Austria into compliance, had he been as prompt in\r\nexecuting them;--which he by no means was. And there lies his error\r\nand failure; very lamentable, excusable only by decrepitude of body\r\nproducing weakness and decay of mind.\" This is emphatically and\r\nwearisomely Schmettau's opinion, [F. W. C. Graf van Schmettau (this is\r\nthe ELDER Schmettau's Son, not the DRESDENER'S whom we used to quote),\r\nFELDZUG DER PREUSSISCHEN ARMEE IN BOHMEN IM JAHRE 1778 (Berlin,\r\n1789,--simultaneously in French too, with Plans): with which--as the\r\ncompletest Account by an eager Witness and Participator--compare\r\nalways Friedrich's own (MEMOIRES DE LA GUERRE DE 1778), in _OEuvres\r\nde Frederic,_ vi. 135-208. Schoning (vol. iv.), besides his own loose\r\nNarrative, or Summary, has given all the CORRESPONDENCE between Henri\r\nand the King:--sufficient to quench the sharpest appetite on this\r\nsubject.] who looks at it only as a military Adjutant, intent on honor\r\nand rapid feats of war,--with how much reason, readers not Prussian or\r\nmilitary shall judge as we go on.\r\n\r\nSaxony, we ought to mention, was also aggrieved. The Dowager-Electress\r\nMaria Antoinette, our sprightly friend, had, as sole surviving Sister\r\nof the late Kurfurst Max, the undoubted heirship of Kurfurst Max's\r\n\"allodial properties and territories:\" territories, I think, mainly in\r\nthe Ober-Pfalz (which are NOT Bavaria Proper, but were acquired in the\r\nThirty-Years War), which are important in value, and which Austria,\r\nregardless of our lively friend, has laid hold of as lapsed fiefs of\r\nBohemia. Clearly Bohemian, says Austria; and keeps hold. Our lively\r\nfriend hereupon makes over all her rights in that matter to her Son,\r\nthe reigning Elector; with the counsel, if counsel were needed,\r\n\"Ask protection of King Friedrich; go wholly with King Friedrich.\"\r\nMecklenburg too has an interest. Among the lapsed fiefs is one to a\r\nDuchy called of Leuchtenberg;--in regard to which, says Mecklenburg,\r\nas loud as it can, \"That Duchy is not lapsed at all; that is now mine,\r\nwitness this Document\" (of a valid testamentary nature)! Other claims\r\nwere put in; but these three: Zweibruck endlessly important; Saxony\r\nimportant too, though not in such degree; Mecklenburg unimportant, but\r\njust,--were alone recognized in impartial quarters as authentic and\r\nworthy of notice.\r\n\r\nOf the pleadings and procedures in the Reichs Diet no reader would\r\npermit me to speak, were I inclined. Enough to understand that they\r\nwent on in the usual voluminous dull-droning way, crescendo always; and\r\ndeserve, what at present they are sure of, oblivion from all creatures.\r\nThe important thing was, not those pleadings in the Reichs Diet, nor the\r\nAustrian proposals there or elsewhere; but the brandishing of arms in\r\nemitting and also in successively answering the same. Answer always No\r\nby Friedrich, and some new flash of handled arms,--the physiognomy of\r\nwhich was the one significant point, Austria, which is far from ready\r\nwith arms, though at each fresh pleading or proposal it tries to give\r\na kind of brandish, says mainly three things, in essence somewhat thus.\r\nAUSTRIA: \"Cannot two States of the Reich come to a mutual understanding,\r\nas Austria and Bavaria have done? And what have third parties to say\r\nto it?\" FRIEDRICH: \"Much! Parties of the Reich have much to say to it!\"\r\n(This several times with variations.) AUSTRIA: \"Our rights seem to us\r\nvalid: Zweibruck, Saxony, Mecklenburg, if aggrieved, can try in the\r\nReichs Law-Courts.\" FRIEDRICH: \"Law-Courts!\" with a new brandish; that\r\nis, sets more regiments on march, from Pommern to Wesel all on march, to\r\nBerlin, to Silesia, towards the Bohemian Frontier. AUSTRIA, by the voice\r\nof Kaunitz: \"We will not give up our rights without sentence of Law.\r\nWe cannot recognize the King of Prussia as Law-Judge in this matter.\"\r\nFRIEDRICH: \"The King of Prussia is of the Jury!\"\r\n\r\nPulse after pulse, this is something like the course things had,\r\ncrescendo till, in about three months, they got to a height which\r\nwas evidently serious. Nay, in the course of the pleadings it became\r\nmanifest that on the Austrian grounds of claim, not Maria Theresa\r\ncould be heir to Straubingen, but Friedrich himself: \"I descend from\r\nThree-Crown Albert's Daughter,\" said Maria Theresa. \"And I from an elder\r\nDaughter of his, and do not claim!\" Friedrich could have answered,\r\nbut did not; treating such claim all along as merely colorable and\r\nchimerical, not worth attention in serious affairs of fact. Till, at\r\nlength, after about three months, there comes a really serious brandish.\r\n\r\nSUNDAY, APRIL 5th, 1778, at Berlin, Friedrich holds review of his Army,\r\nall assembled, equipped and in readiness; and (in that upper Parole-Room\r\nof the Schloss) makes this Speech, which, not without extraneous\r\nintention, was printed in the Newspapers:--\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH'S SPEECH TO HIS GENERALS. \"Gentlemen, I have assembled you\r\nhere for a public object. Most of you, like myself, have often been in\r\narms along with one another, and are grown gray in the service of our\r\nCountry: to all of us is well known in what dangers, toils and renown we\r\nhave been fellow-sharers. I doubt not in the least that all of you, as\r\nmyself, have a horror of bloodshed: but the danger which now threatens\r\nour Countries, not only renders it a duty, but puts us in the\r\nabsolute necessity, to adopt the quickest and most effectual means for\r\ndissipating at the right time the storm which threatens to break out on\r\nus.\r\n\r\n\"I depend with complete confidence on your soldierly and patriotic zeal,\r\nwhich is already well and gloriously known to me, and which, while I\r\nlive, I will acknowledge with the heartiest satisfaction. Before all\r\nthings, I recommend to you, and prescribe as your most sacred duty,\r\nThat, in every situation, you exercise humanity on unarmed enemies;\r\nand be continually attentive that, in this respect too, there be the\r\nstrictest discipline (MANNSZUCHT) kept among those under you.\r\n\r\n\"To travel with the pomp of a King is not among my wishes: and all of\r\nyou are aware that I have no pleasure in rich field-furniture: but\r\nmy increasing age, and the weakness it brings, render me incapable of\r\nriding as I did in my youth. I shall, therefore, be obliged to make use\r\nof a post-chaise in times of marching; and all of you have liberty to\r\ndo the same. But on the day of battle you shall see me on horseback; and\r\nthere, also, I hope my Generals will follow that example.\"\r\n\r\nVOLTAIRE SMOTHERED UNDER ROSES. King's Speech was on Sunday, April 5th,\r\nEvening of last Monday (March 30th), at the Theatre Francais in\r\nParis, poor Voltaire had that world-famous apotheosis of his; and got\r\n\"smothered under roses,\" as he termed it. He had left Ferney (such the\r\nurgency of Niece Denis and her unappeasable desire for a sight of Paris\r\nagain) February 5th; arrived in Paris February 10th; ventured out to see\r\nhis poor last Tragedy, not till the sixth night of it, March 30th; was\r\nbeshouted, crowned, raised to the immortal gods by a repentant Paris\r\nworld: \"Greatest of men,--You were not a miscreant and malefactor, then:\r\non the contrary, you were a spiritual Hercules, a heroic Son of Light;\r\nSlayer of the Nightmare Monsters, and foul Dragons and Devils that were\r\npreying on us: to you shall not we now say, Long life, with all our\r\nthroats and all our hearts,\"--and so quench you at last! Which they\r\nmanaged to do, poor repentant souls. The tottering wayworn Voltaire,\r\nover-agitated in this way, took to bed; never rose again; and on that\r\nday two months was dead. [In DUVERNET, and still better in LONGCHAMP ET\r\nWAGNIERE, ample account of these interesting occurrences.] His light all\r\ndone; to King Friedrich, or to any of us, no flash of radiancy from him\r\nany more forever.\r\n\r\nAPRIL 6th, Friedrich gets on march--perhaps about 100,000 strong--for\r\nSchonwalde, in the Neisse-Schweidnitz neighborhood; and there, in\r\nthe course of the week, has cantoned himself, and sits completing his\r\nmagazines and appliances for actual work of war. This is a considerable\r\nbrandish; and a good deal astonishes Kaunitz and the Vienna people, who\r\nhave not 10,000 at present on those Frontiers, and nothing whatever in\r\na state of readiness. \"Dangerous really!\" Kaunitz admits; and sets new\r\nregiments on march from Hungary, from the Netherlands, from all ends\r\nof the Earth where they are. Tempers his own insolent talk, too; but\r\nstrives to persuade himself that it is \"Menace merely. He won't; he\r\nabhors war.\" Kaunitz had hardly exaggerated Friedrich's abhorrence of\r\nwar; though it turned out there were things which Friedrich abhorred\r\nstill more.\r\n\r\nSchonwalde, head-quarter of this alarming Prussian cantonment, is close\r\non the new Fortress of Silberberg, a beautiful new impregnability,\r\nlooking into those valleys of the Warta, of the young Neisse, which\r\nare the road to Bohemia or from it,--where the Pandour torrents used to\r\nissue into the first Silesian Wars; where Friedrich himself was once\r\nto have been snapped up, but was not quite,--and only sang Mass as\r\nExtempore Abbot, with Tobias Stusche, in the Monastery of Camenz,\r\naccording to the myth which readers may remember. No more can Pandours\r\nissue that way; only Prussians can enter in. Friedrich's windows in the\r\nSchloss of Schonwalde,--which are on the left hand, if you be touring in\r\nthose parts,--look out, direct upon Silberberg, and have its battlements\r\nbetween them and the 3-o'clock Sun. [Schoning, iv. (Introductory\r\nPart).] In the Town of Silberberg, Friedrich has withal a modest little\r\nlodging,--lodging still known,--where he can alight for an hour or\r\na night, in the multifarious businesses that lead him to and fro. \"A\r\nbeautiful place,\" says Schoning; \"where the King stayed twelve weeks\"\r\nor more; waiting till the Bavarian-Austrian case should ripen better. At\r\nSchonwalde, what was important in his private circle, he heard of Lord\r\nMarischal's death, then of Voltaire's; not to mention that of English\r\nPitt, and perhaps others interesting to him. [Voltaire died May 30th;\r\nMarischal, May 25th; Pitt, May 11th;--and May 4th, in the Cantonment\r\nhere, died General von Rentzel, the same who, as Lieutenant Rentzel,\r\nsixty years ago, had taught the little Crown-Prince his drill\r\n(Rodenbeck, iii. 187).]\r\n\r\n\"Now was the time,\" cry Schmettau and the unfavorable, \"when he might\r\nhave walked across into Eastern Bohemia, into Mahren, whither you like;\r\nto Vienna itself, and taken Austria by the throat at discretion: 'Do\r\njustice, then, will you! Let go Bavaria, or--!' In his young years,\r\nwould not he have done so? His Plan, long since laid down, was grand:\r\nTo march into Mahren, leaving Silesia guarded; nay leaving Bohemia to be\r\ninvaded,--for Prince Henri, and the Saxons, who are a willing handful,\r\nand will complete Henri likewise to 100,000, were to do that, feat the\r\nwhile;--March into Mahren, on to Vienna if he chose; laying all flat.\r\nInfallible,\" say the Schmettau people. \"He had the fire of head to\r\ncontrive it all; but worn down and grown old, he could not execute his\r\ngreat thoughts.\" Which is obviously absurd, Friedrich's object not being\r\nto lay Austria flat, or drive animosities to the sanguinary point, and\r\nkindle all Europe into war; but merely to extract, with the minimum of\r\nviolence, something like justice from Austria on this Bavarian matter.\r\nFor which end, he may justly consider slow pressure preferable to\r\nthe cutting method. His problem is most ticklish, not allowed for by\r\nSchmettau.\r\n\r\nThe encampment round Schonwalde, especially as there was nothing ready\r\nthereabouts on the Austrian side, produced a visible and great effect\r\non the negotiations; and notably altered the high Kaunitz tone towards\r\nFriedrich. \"Must two great Courts quarrel, then, for the sake of a small\r\none?\" murmured Kaunitz, plaintively now, to himself and to the King,--to\r\nthe King not in a very distinct manner, though to himself the principle\r\nis long since clear as an axiom in Politics: \"Great Courts should\r\nunderstand one another; then the small would be less troublesome.\" For\r\na quarter of a century this has been the Kaunitz faith. In 1753, when he\r\nmiraculously screwed round the French into union with the Austrians to\r\nput down an upstart Prussia, this was his grand fulcrum, the immovable\r\nrock in which the great Engineer fixed down his political capstans, and\r\nlevered and screwed. He did triumphantly wind matters round,--though\r\nwhether they much profited him when round, may be a question.\r\n\r\nBut the same grand principle, in the later instance of partitioning\r\nPoland, has it not proved eminently triumphant, successful in all\r\npoints? And, doubtless, this King of Prussia recognizes it, if made\r\nworth his while, thinks Kaunitz. In a word, Kaunitz's next utterance is\r\nwonderfully changed. The great Engineer speaks almost like a Bishop on\r\nthis new text. \"Let the Two Courts,\" says he, \"put themselves each in\r\nthe other's place; each think what it would want;\" and in fact each, in\r\na Christian manner, try to do as it would be done by! How touching in\r\nthe mouth of a Kaunitz, with something of pathos, of plaintiveness,\r\nalmost of unction in it! \"There is no other method of agreeing,\" urges\r\nhe: \"War is a terrible method, disliked by both of us. Austria wishes\r\nthis of Bavaria; but his Prussian Majesty's turn will come, perhaps now\r\nis (let him say and determine); we will make it worth his while.\" This\r\nis of APRIL 24th; notable change since the cantoning round Schonwalde.\r\n\r\nGermany at large, though it lay so silent, in its bedrid condition, was\r\nin great anxiety. Never had the Holy Romish Reich such a shock before:\r\n\"Meaning to partition us like Poland?\" thought the Reich, with a\r\nshudder. \"They can, by degrees, if they think good; these Two Great\r\nSovereigns!\" Courage, your Durchlauchts: one of the Two great ones has\r\nnot that in his thoughts; has, and will have, the reverse of that; which\r\nwill be your anchorages in the storms of fate for a long time to come!\r\nNor was it--as will shortly appear to readers--Kaunitz's immediate\r\nintention at all: enough if poor we can begin it, set it fairly under\r\nway; let some unborn happier Kaunitz, the last of a series, complete\r\nsuch blessed consummation; in a happier time, far over the practical\r\nhorizon at present. This we do gather to have been Kaunitz's real view;\r\nand it throws a light on the vexed Partition-of-Poland question, and\r\ngives weight to Dohm's assertion, That Kaunitz was the actual beginner\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nWeeks before Friedrich heard of this remarkable Memorial, and ten\r\ndays before it was brought to paper, there came to Friedrich another\r\nunexpected remarkable Document: a LETTER from Kaiser Joseph himself, who\r\nis personally running about in these parts, over in Bohemia, endeavoring\r\nto bring Army matters to a footing; and is no doubt shocked to find\r\nthem still in such backwardness, with a Friedrich at hand. The Kaiser's\r\nLetter, we perceive, is pilot-balloon to the Kaunitz episcopal Document,\r\nand to an actual meeting of Prussian and Austrian Ministers on the\r\nBavarian point; and had been seen to be a salutary measure by an Austria\r\nin alarm. It asks, as the Kaunitz Memorial will, though in another\r\nstyle, \"Must there be war, then? Is there no possibility left in\r\nnegotiation and mutual concession? I am your Majesty's friend and\r\nadmirer; let us try.\" This was an unexpected and doubtless a welcome\r\nthing to Friedrich; who answers eagerly, and in a noble style both of\r\ncourtesy and of business sense: upon which there followed two other\r\nImperial Letters with their two Royal answers; [In _OEuvres de\r\nFrederic,_ (vi. 183-193), Three successive Letters from the Kaiser (of\r\ndates, \"Olmutz,\" \"Litau,\" \"Konigsgratz,\" 13th-19th April, 1778),\r\nwith King's Answers (\"Schonwalde,\" all of them, and 14th-20th\r\nApril),--totally without interest to the general reader.] and directly\r\nafterwards the small Austrian-Prussian Congress we spoke of, Finkenstein\r\nand Hertzberg on the Prussian part, Cobenzl on the Austrian (Congress\r\nsitting at Berlin), which tried to agree, but could not; and to which\r\nKaunitz's Memorial of April 24th was meant as some helpful sprinkling of\r\npresidential quasi-episcopal oil.\r\n\r\nOil merely: for it turned out, Kaunitz had no thought at present of\r\npartitioning the German Reich with Friedrich; but intended merely to\r\nkeep his own seized portion of Baiern, and in return for Friedrich's\r\nassent intended to recompense Friedrich with--in fact, with Austria's\r\nconsent, That if Anspach and Baireuth lapsed home to Prussia (as it\r\nwas possible they might, the present Margraf, Friedrich's Nephew, the\r\nLady-Craven Margraf, having a childless Wife), Prussia should freely\r\nopen the door to them! A thing which Friedrich naturally maintained\r\nto be in need of nobody's consent, and to lie totally apart from this\r\nquestion; but which Austria always considered a very generous thing,\r\nand always returned to, with new touches of improvement, as their\r\ngrand recipe in this matter. So that, unhappily, the Hertzberg-Cobenzl\r\ntreatyings, Kaiser's Letters and Kaunitz's episcopal oil, were without\r\neffect,--except to gain for the Austrians, who infinitely needed it,\r\ndelay of above two months. The Letters are without general interest:\r\nbut, for Friedrich's sake, perhaps readers will consent to a specimen?\r\nHere are parts of his First Letter: people meaning to be Kings (which\r\nI doubt none of my readers are) could not do better than read it, and\r\nagain read it, and acquire that style, first of knowing thoroughly the\r\nobject in hand, and then of speaking on it and of being silent on it, in\r\na true and noble manner:--\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH TO HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY (at Olmutz).\r\n\r\n\"SCHONWALDE, 14th April, 1778.\r\n\r\n\"SIRE MY BROTHER,--I have received, with all the satisfaction possible,\r\nthe Letter which your Imperial Majesty has had the goodness to write to\r\nme. I have neither Minister nor Clerk (SCRIBE) about me; therefore your\r\nImperial Majesty will be pleased to put up with such Answer as an Old\r\nSoldier can give, who writes to you with probity and frankness, on one\r\nof the most important subjects which have risen in Politics for a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody wishes more than I to maintain peace and harmony between the\r\nPowers of Europe: but there are limits to everything; and cases so\r\nintricate (EPINEUX) arise that goodwill alone will not suffice to\r\nmaintain things in repose and tranquillity. Permit me, Sire, to state\r\ndistinctly what the question seems to me to be. It is to determine if\r\nan Emperor can dispose at his will of the Fiefs of the Empire. Answer in\r\nthe affirmative, and, all these Fiefs become TIMARS [in the Turk way],\r\nwhich are for life only; and which the Sultan disposes of again, on the\r\npossessor's death. Now, this is contrary to the Laws, to the Customs and\r\nConstitutions of the German Empire.\"--\"I, as member of the Empire, and\r\nas having, by the Treaty of Hubertsburg, re-sanctioned the Peace of\r\nWestphalia, find myself formally engaged to support the immunities, the\r\nliberties and rights of the Germanic Body.\r\n\r\n\"This, Sire, is the veritable state of things. Personal interest I have\r\nnone: but I am persuaded your Majesty's self would regard me as a paltry\r\nman, unworthy of your esteem, should I basely sacrifice the rights,\r\nimmunities and privileges, which the Electors and I have received from\r\nour Ancestors.\r\n\r\n\"I continue to speak to your Majesty with the same frankness. I love and\r\nhonor your person. It will certainly be hard for me to fight against a\r\nPrince gifted with excellent qualities, and whom I personally esteem.\r\nBut\"--And is there no remedy? Anspach and Baireuth stand in no need\r\nof sanction. I consent to the Congress proposed:--being with the &c.\r\n&c.--F. [_OEuvres de Frederic,_ vi. 187.]\r\n\r\nThe sittings of this little Congress at Berlin lasted all through\r\nMay and June; to the disgust of Schmettau and the ardent Prussian\r\nmess-rooms, \"lying ready here, and forbidden to act.\" For the Austrians\r\nall the while were at their busiest, improving the moments, marching\r\ncontinually hitherward from Hungary, from Limburg, from all ends of the\r\nearth. Both negotiating parties had shown a manifest wish to terminate\r\nwithout war; and both made various attempts or proposals that way;\r\nFriedrich offering, in the name of European peace, to yield the\r\nAustrians some small rim or paring of Bavaria from the edge\r\nadjoining them; the Austrians offering Anspach-Baireuth with some\r\nimprovements;--always offering Friedrich his own Baireuth-Anspach with\r\nsome new sauce (as that he might exchange those Territories with Saxony\r\nfor a fine equivalent in the Lausitz, contiguous to him, which was a\r\nreal improvement and increase):--but as neither party would in the least\r\ngive up in essentials, or quit the ground it had taken, the result was\r\nnothing. Week after week; so many weeks are being lost to Friedrich;\r\ngained to Austria: Schmettau getting more and more disgusted.\r\n\r\nFriedrich still waited; not in all points quite ready yet, he said, nor\r\nthe futile diplomacies quite complete;--evidently in the highest degree\r\nunwilling to come to the cutting point, and begin a War which nobody\r\ncould see the end of. Many things he tried; Peace so precious to him,\r\ntry and again try. All through June too, this went on; the result always\r\nzero,--obviously certain to be so. As even Friedrich had at last to own\r\nto himself; and likewise that the Campaign season was ebbing away; and\r\nthat if his grand Moravian scheme was to be tried on Austria, there was\r\nnot now a moment to lose.\r\n\r\nFriedrich's ultimate proposal, new modification of what all his\r\nproposals had been, \"To you some thin rim of Baiern; to Saxony and\r\nMecklenburg some ETCETERA of indemnity, money chiefly (money always to\r\nbe paid by Karl Theodor, who has left Baiern open to the spoiler in this\r\nscandalous manner),\" was of June 13th; Austrians for ten days meditating\r\non it, and especially getting forward their Army matters, answer, June\r\n24th \"No we won't.\" Upon which Friedrich--to the joy of Schmettau and\r\nevery Prussian--actually rises. Emits his War-Manifesto (JULY 3d):\r\n\"Declaration to our Brethren (MITSTANDE) of the Reich,\" that\r\nAustria will listen to nothing but War; [Fischer, ii 388; Dohm,\r\n_Denkwurdigkeiten,_ i. 110; _OEuvres de Frederic,_ vi. 145.] and, on and\r\nfrom that day, goes flowing forward in perfect columns and arrangements,\r\n100,000 strong; through the picturesque Glatz Country, straight towards\r\nthe Bohemian Border, hour by hour. Flows over the Bohemian Border by\r\nNachod Town; his vanguard bursting into field-music and flourishes of\r\ntrumpeting at that grand moment (July 5th); flowed bodily over; and\r\nencamped that night on Bohemian ground, with Nachod to rear; thence\r\ntowards Kwalkowitz, and on the second day to Jaromirtz (\"Camp of\r\nJaromirtz\"), a little Town which we have heard of before, but which\r\nbecame more famous than ever during the next ten weeks.\r\n\r\nJaromirtz, Kwalkowitz, Konigsgratz: this is the old hill-and-dale\r\nlabyrinth of an Upper-Elbe Country; only too well known to his Majesty\r\nand us, for almost forty years past: here again are the Austrians\r\nwaiting the King; watching diligently this new Invasion of his out of\r\nGlatz and the East! In the same days, Prince Henri, who is also near\r\n100,000, starts from Dresden to invade them from the West. Loudon,\r\nfacing westward, is in watch of Henri; Lacy, or indeed the Kaiser\r\nhimself, back-to-back of Loudon, stands in this Konigsgratz-Jaromirtz\r\npart; said to be embattled in a very elaborate manner, to a length of\r\nfifty miles on this fine ground, and in number somewhat superior to the\r\nKing;--the Austrians in all counting about 250,000; of whom Lacy has\r\nconsiderably the larger share. The terror at Vienna, nevertheless, is\r\nvery great: \"A day of terror,\" says one who was there; \"I will not trust\r\nmyself to describe the sensation which this news, 'Friedrich in Bohemia\r\nagain!' produced among all ranks of people.\" [Cogniazzo, iv. 316, 320,\r\n321; Preuss, iv. 101, &c.] Maria Theresa, with her fine motherly heart,\r\nin alarm for her Country, and trembling \"for my two Sons [Joseph and\r\nLeopold] and dear Son-in-Law [of Sachsen-Teschen], who are in the Army,\"\r\novercomes all scruples of pride; instantly despatches an Autograph to\r\nthe King (\"Bearer of this, Baron von Thugut, with Full Powers\"); and\r\non her own strength starts a new Negotiation,--which, as will be seen,\r\nended no better than the others. [Her Letters, four in all, with their\r\nAppendixes, and the King's Answers, in _OEuvres de Frederic,_ vi.\r\n196-200.]\r\n\r\nSchmettau says, \"Friedrich, cheated of his Mahren schemes, was still in\r\ntime; the Austrian position being indeed strong, but not being even\r\nyet quite ready.\" Friedrich himself, however, on reconnoitring, thought\r\ndifferently. A position such as one never saw before, thinks he;\r\ncontrived by Lacy; masterly use of the ground, of the rivers, of the\r\nrocks, woods, swamps; Elbe and his branches, and the intricate shoulders\r\nof the Giant Mountains: no man could have done it better than Lacy\r\nhere, who, they say, is the contriver and practical hand. [_OEuvres\r\nde Frederic,_ vi. 147.] From Konigsgratz, northward, by Konigshof, by\r\nArnau, up to Hohenelbe, all heights are crowned, all passes bristling\r\nwith cannon. Rivers Aupa, Elbe beset with redoubts, with dams in\r\nfavorable places, and are become inundations, difficult to tap. There\r\nare \"ditches 8 feet deep by 16 broad.\" Behind or on the right bank of\r\nElbe, it is mere intrenchment for five-and-twenty miles. With bogs, with\r\nthickets full of Croats; and such an amount of artillery,--I believe\r\nthey have in battery no fewer than 1,500 cannon. A position very\r\nconsiderable indeed:--must have taken time to deliberate, delve and\r\ninvest; but it is done. Near fifty miles of it: here, clear to your\r\nglass, has the head of Lacy visibly emerged on us, as if for survey of\r\nphenomena:--head of Lacy sure enough (body of him lying invisible in\r\nthe heights, passes and points of vantage); and its NECK of fifty miles,\r\nlike the neck of a war-horse clothed with thunder. On which (thinks\r\nSchmettau privately) you may, too late, make your reflections!\r\n\r\nSchmettau asserts that the position, though strong, was nothing like\r\nso infinitely strong; and that Friedrich in his younger days would very\r\nsoon have assaulted it, and turned Lacy inside out: but Friedrich, we\r\nknow, had his reasons against hurry. He reconnoitred diligently; rode\r\nout reconnoitring \"fifteen miles the first day\" (July 6th), ditto the\r\nsecond and following; and was nearly shot by Croats,--by one specific\r\nCroat, says Prussian Mythology, supported by Engraving. An old\r\nEngraving, which I have never seen; represents Friedrich reconnoitring\r\nthose five-and-twenty miles of Elbe, which have so many redoubts on\r\ntheir side of it, and swarm with Croat parties on both sides: this is\r\nall the truth that is in the Engraving. [Rodenbeck, p. 188.] Fact says:\r\nFriedrich (\"on the 8th,\" if that were all the variation) \"was a mark for\r\nthe Austrian sharpshooters for half an hour.\" Myth says, and engraves\r\nit, with the date of \"July 7th:\" Friedrich, skirting some thicket,\r\nsuddenly came upon a single Croat with musket levelled at him, wild\r\ncreature's finger just on the trigger;--and quietly admonishing,\r\nFriedrich lifts his finger with a \"DU, DU (Ah you!);\" upon which, such\r\nthe divinity that hedges one, the wild creature instantly flings down\r\nhis murder-weapon, and, kneeling, embraces the King's boot,--with\r\nkisses, for anything I know. It is certain, Friedrich, about six times\r\nover in this paltry War or Quasi No-War, set his attendants on the\r\ntremble; was namely, from Croateries and Artilleries, in imminent peril\r\nof life; so careless was he, and dangerous to speak to in his sour\r\nhumor. Humor very sour, they say, for most part; being in reality\r\naltogether backward and loath for grand enterprise; and yet striving\r\nto think he was not; ashamed that any War of his should be a No-War.\r\nSchmettau says:--\r\n\r\n\"On the day of getting into Jaromirtz [July 8th], the King, tired of\r\nriding about while the Columns were slowly getting in, lay down on the\r\nground with his Adjutants about him. A young Officer came riding past;\r\nwhom the King beckoned to him;--wrote something with pencil (an Order,\r\nnot of the least importance), and said: 'Here; that Order to General\r\nLossow, and tell him he is not to take it ill that I trouble him, as I\r\nhave none in my Suite that can do anything.'\" Let the Suite take it\r\nas they can! A most pungent, severe old King; quite perverse at times,\r\nthinks Schmettau. Thus again, more than once.:--\r\n\r\n\"On arriving with his Column where the Officer, a perfectly skilful\r\nman, had marked out the Camp, the King would lift his spy-glass; gaze\r\nto right and left, riding round the place at perhaps a hundred yards'\r\ndistance; and begin: 'SIEHT ER, HERR, But look, Herr, what a botching\r\nyou have made of it again (WAS ER DA WIEDER FUR DUMM ZEUG GEMACHT HAT)!'\r\nand grumbling and blaming, would alter the Camp, till it was all out\r\nof rule; and then say, 'See there, that is the way to mark out Camps.'\"\r\n[Schmettau, xxv. 30, 24.]\r\n\r\nIn a week's time, July 13th, came another fine excuse for inaction;\r\nPlenipotentiary Thugut, namely, and the Kaiserinn's Letter, which we\r\nspoke of. Autograph from Maria Theresa herself, inspired by the terror\r\nof Vienna and of her beautiful motherly heart. Negotiation to be private\r\nutterly: \"My Son, the Kaiser, knows nothing of it; I beg the most\r\nabsolute secrecy;\" which was accordingly kept, while Thugut, with\r\nFinkenstein and Hertzberg again, held \"Congress of Braunau\" in those\r\nneighborhoods,--with as little effect as ever. Thugut's Name, it seems,\r\nwas originally TUNICOTTO (Tyrolese-Italian); which the ignorant Vienna\r\npeople changed into \"THU-NICHT-GUT (Do-no-good),\" till Maria Theresa, in\r\nvery charity, struck out the negative, and made him \"Do-good.\" Do-good\r\nand his Congress held Friedrich till August 10th: five more weeks gone;\r\nand nothing but reconnoitring,--with of course foraging, and diligently\r\neating the Country, which is a daily employment, and produces fencing\r\nand skirmishing enough.\r\n\r\nHenri, in the interim, has invaded from the West; seen Leitmeritz,\r\nLobositz;--Prag Nobility all running, and I suppose Prayers to St. Titus\r\ngoing again,--and Loudon in alarm. Loudon, however, saved Prag \"by two\r\nmasterly positions\" (not mentionable here); upon which Henri took\r\ncamp at Niemes; Loudon, the weaker in this part, seizing the Iser as a\r\nbulwark, and ranking himself behind it, back-to-back of Lacy. Here for\r\nabout five weeks sat Henri, nothing on hand but to eat the Country. Over\r\nthe heads of Loudon and Lacy, as the crow flies, Henri's Camp may be\r\nabout 70 miles from Jaromirtz, where the King is. Hussar Belling, our\r\nold Anti-Swede friend, a brilliant cutting man, broke over the Iser\r\nonce, perhaps twice; and there was pretty fencing by him and the like\r\nof him: \"but Prince Henri did nothing,\" says the King, [_OEuvres de\r\nFrederic,_ vi. 154]--was, in fact, helping the King to do nothing.\r\nBy the 10th of September, as Henri has computed, this Country will be\r\neaten; \"Forage, I find, will be quite done here on September 10th,\"\r\nwrites Henri, after a week or two's experience.\r\n\r\nThere was always talk of Henri and the King, who are 100,000 each,\r\njoining hands by the post of Arnau, or some weak point of Lacy's\r\nwell north of Konigsgratz; thus of cutting off the meal-carts of that\r\nback-to-back copartnery, and so of tumbling it off the ground (which\r\nwas perfectly possible, says Schmettau); and small detachments and\r\nexpeditious were pushed out, General Dahlwig, General Anhalt, partly for\r\nthat object: but not the least of it ever took effect. \"Futile, lost by\r\nloitering, as all else was,\" groans Schmettau. Prince Henri was averse\r\nto attempt, intimates the King,--as indeed (though refusing to own\r\nit) was I. \"September 10th, my forage will be out, your Majesty,\" says\r\nHenri, always a punctual calculating man.\r\n\r\nThe Austrians, on their side, were equally stagnant; and, except the\r\ncontinual skirmishing with the Prussian foragers, undertook nothing.\r\n\"Shamefully ill-clone our foraging, too,\" exclaims Schmettau again and\r\nagain: \"Had we done it with neatness, with regularity, the Country would\r\nhave lasted us twice as long. Doing it headlong, wastefully and by the\r\nrule-of-thumb, the Country was a desert, all its inhabitants fled, all\r\nits edibles consumed, before six weeks were over. Friedrich is not now\r\nhimself at all; in great things or in little; what a changed Friedrich!\"\r\nexclaims Schmettau, with wearisome iteration.\r\n\r\nFrom about August 6th, or especially August 10th, when the Maria-Theresa\r\nCorrespondence, or \"Congress of Braunau,\" ended likewise in zero,\r\nFriedrich became impatient for actual junction with Prince Henri, actual\r\npush of business; and began to hint of an excellent plan he had: \"Burst\r\nthrough on their left flank; blow up their post of Hohenelbe yonder:\r\nthence is but one march to Iser river; junction with Prince Henri\r\nthere; and a Lacy and a Loudon tumbled to the winds.\" \"A plan perfectly\r\nfeasible,\" says Schmettau; \"which solaced the King's humor, but which he\r\nnever really intended to execute.\" Possibly not; otherwise, according\r\nto old wont, he would have forborne to speak of it beforehand. At\r\nall events, August 15th, in the feeling that one ought really to do\r\nsomething, the rather as forage hereabouts was almost or altogether\r\nrunning out, he actually set about this grand scheme.\r\n\r\nGot on march to rightward, namely, up the Aupa river, through the gloomy\r\nchasms of Kingdom-Wood, memorable in old days: had his bakery shifted\r\nto Trautenau; his heavy cannon getting tugged through the mire and the\r\nrains, which by this time were abundant, towards Hohenelbe, for the\r\ngreat enterprise: and sat encamped on and about the Battle-ground\r\nof Sohr for a week or so, waiting till all were forward; eating Sohr\r\nCountry, which was painfully easy to do. The Austrians did next to\r\nnothing on him; but the rains, the mud and scarcity were doing much.\r\nGetting on to Hohenelbe region, after a week's wet waiting, he, on\r\nocular survey of the ground about, was heard to say, \"This cannot be\r\ndone, then!\" \"Had never meant to do it,\" sneers Schmettau, \"and only\r\nwanted some excuse.\" Which is very likely. Schmettau gives an Anecdote\r\nof him here: In regard to a certain Hill, the Key of the Austrian\r\nposition, which the King was continually reconnoitring, and lamenting\r\nthe enormous height of, \"Impossible, so high!\" One of the Adjutants took\r\nhis theodolite, ascertained the height, and, by way of comforting his\r\nMajesty, reported the exact number of feet above their present level.\r\n\"How do YOU know, Herr?\" said the King angrily. \"Measured it by\r\nTrigonometry, your Majesty.\"--\"Trigonometry! SCHER' ER SICH ZUM TEUFEL\r\n(Off with you, Sir, to the Devil, your Trigonometry and you!)\"--no\r\nbeliever in mathematics, this King.\r\n\r\nHe was loath to go; and laid the blame on many things. \"Were Prince\r\nHenri now but across the Iser. Had that stupid Anhalt, when he was upon\r\nit [galloping about, to the ruin of his head], only seized Arnau, Arnau\r\nand its Elbe-Bridge; and had it in hand for junction with Prince Henri!\"\r\nIn fine, just as the last batch of heavy cannon--twenty or thirty\r\nhungered horses to a gun, at the rate of five miles a day in roads\r\nunspeakable--were getting in, he ordered them all to be dragged back,\r\nback to the Trautenau road; whither we must now all go. And, SEPTEMBER\r\n8th, in perfect order, for the Austrians little molested him, and got a\r\nbad bargain when they did, the great Friedrich with his whole Army\r\ngot on march homeward, after such a Campaign as we see. Climbed the\r\nTrautenau-Landshut Pass, with nothing of effective loss except from\r\nthe rainy elements, the steep miry ways and the starved horses;\r\ndraught-horses especially starved,--whom, poor creatures, \"you would\r\nsee spring at the ropes [draught-harness], thirty of them to a gun, when\r\nstarted and gee-ho'd to; tug violently with no effect, and fall down in\r\nwhole rows.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Henri, forage done, started punctually September 10th, two days\r\nafter his Brother; and with little or no pursuit, from the Austrians,\r\nand with horses unstarved, got home in comparatively tolerable\r\ncircumstances. Cantoned himself in Dresden neighborhood, and sat\r\nwaiting: he had never approved this War; and now, I suppose, would not\r\nwant for reflections. Friedrich's cantonments were round Landshut,\r\nand spread out to right and to left, from Glatz Country and the\r\nUpper-Silesian Hills, to Silberberg and Schweidnitz;--his own quarter\r\nis the same region, where he lay so long in Summer, 1759, talking on\r\nlearned subjects with the late Quintus Icilius, if readers remember,\r\nand wearily waiting till Cunctator Daun (likewise now deceased) took\r\nhis stand, or his seat, at Mark Lissa, and the King could follow him\r\nto Schmottseifen. Friedrich himself on this present occasion stayed at\r\nSchatzlar as rear-guard, to see whether the Austrians would not perhaps\r\ntry to make some Winter Campaign of it, and if so, whether they would\r\nattempt on Prince Henri or on him. The Austrians did not attempt on\r\neither; showed no such intention,--though mischievous enough in\r\nother small ways. Friedrich wrote the ELOGE of Voltaire [_OEuvres de\r\nFrederic,_ vii. 50 et seq. (\"finished Nov. 26th, 1778\").] while he\r\nwaited here at Schatzlar, among the rainy Mountains. Later on, as\r\nprospects altered, he was much at Breslau, or running about on civic\r\nerrands with Breslau as centre: at Breslau he had many Dialogues with\r\nProfessor Garve,--in whose good, but oppressively solemn, little Book,\r\nmore a dull-droning Preachment than a Narrative, no reader need look for\r\nthem or for him.\r\n\r\nAs to the EULOGY OF VOLTAIRE, we may say that it is generous, ingenious,\r\nsuccinct; and of dialect now obsolete to us. There was (and is,\r\nthough suppressed) another EULOGY, brand-new, by a Contemporary of our\r\nown,--from which I know not if readers will permit me a sentence or two,\r\nin this pause among the rainy Mountains?\r\n\r\n... \"A wonderful talent lay in this man--[in Voltaire, to wit; \"such\r\nan intellect, the sharpest, swiftest of the world,\" thinks our\r\nContemporary; \"fathoming you the deepest subject, to a depth far beyond\r\nmost men's soundings, and coming up with victory and something wise\r\nand logically speakable to say on it, sooner than any other man,--never\r\ndoubting but he has been at the bottom, which is from three to ten miles\r\nlower!\"] wonderful talent; but observe always, if you look closely, it\r\nwas in essence a mere talent for Speech; which talent Bavius and Maevius\r\nand the Jew Apella may admire without looking behind it, but this\r\nEulogist by no means will. Speech, my friend? If your sublime talent\r\nof speech consists only in making ignorance appear to be knowledge, and\r\nlittle wisdom appear to be much, I will thank you to walk on with it,\r\nand apply at some other shop. The QUANTITY of shops where you can\r\napply with thrice-golden advantage, from the Morning Newspapers to\r\nthe National Senate, is tremendous at this epoch of the poor world's\r\nhistory;--go, I request you! And while his foot is on the stairs,\r\ndescending from my garret, I think: O unfortunate fellow-creature in an\r\nunfortunate world, why is not there a Friedrich Wilhelm to 'elect' you,\r\nas he did Gundling, to his TOBACCO Parliament, and there set Fassmann\r\nupon you with the pans of burning peat? It were better even for\r\nyourself; wholesomely didactic to your poor self, I cannot doubt; and\r\nfor the poor multitudes to whom you are now to be sacred VATES, speaking\r\nand singing YOUR dismal GUNDLINGIANA as if inspired by Heaven, how\r\ninfinitely better!--Courage, courage! I discern, across these hideous\r\njargons, the reign of greater silence approaching upon repentant men;\r\nreign of greater silence, I say; or else that of annihilation, which\r\nwill be the most silent of all....\r\n\r\n\"Voltaire, if not a great man, is a remarkably peculiar one; and did\r\nsuch a work in these Ages as will render him long memorable, more or\r\nless. He kindled the infinite dry dung-heap of things; set it blazing\r\nheaven-high;--and we all thought, in the French Revolution time, it\r\nwould burn out rapidly into ashes, and then there would a clear Upper\r\nFirmament, if over a blackened Earth, be once more vouchsafed us. The\r\nflame is now done, as I once said; and only the dull dung-heap, smokily\r\nburning, but not now blazing, remains,--for it was very damp, EXCEPT on\r\nthe surface, and is by nature slow of combustion:--who knows but it may\r\nhave to burn for centuries yet, poisoning by its villanous mal-odors\r\nthe life-atmosphere of all men? Eternal Author of this Universe, whose\r\nthrone is Truth, to whom all the True are Sons, wilt thou not look down\r\nupon us, then!--Till this sad process is complete? Voltaire is like to\r\nbe very memorable.\"...\r\n\r\nTo Friedrich the Winter was in general tranquil; a Friedrich busy\r\npreparing all things for his grand Mahren Enterprise, and for \"real work\r\nnext year.\" By and by there came to be real Peace-prospects instead.\r\nMeanwhile, the Austrians do try a little, in the small Pandour way,\r\nto dislodge him from the Upper-Silesian or Teschen regions, where the\r\nErbprinz of Brunswick is in command; a man not to be pricked into gratis\r\nby Pandours. Erbprinz, accordingly, provoked by their Pandourings, broke\r\nout at last; and about Zuckmantel instantly scourged them home, and\r\nhad peace after. Foiled here, they next tried upon Glatz; \"Get into his\r\nGlatz Country, then;--a snatch of that will balance the account\" (which\r\nwas one of Newspaper glory only): and a certain Wurmser of theirs,\r\nexpert in such things, did burn the Town of Habelschwert one morning;\r\n[\"18th January, 1779\" (Rodenbeck, iii. 195; Schmettau, &c.).] and tried\r\nfarther, not wisely this time, a surprisal of Glatz Fortress itself; but\r\ngot smitten home by our old friend General Wunsch, without profit there.\r\nThis was the same Wurmser who came to bad issues in the Napoleon time\r\nafterwards; a rising man then; not a dim Old-Newspaper ghost as now.\r\n\r\nMost shameful this burning of Habelschwert by way of mere bravura,\r\nthinks Friedrich, in a time of actual Treaty for Peace, when our\r\nCongress of Teschen was just struggling to get together! It was the\r\nchief stroke done by the Austrians in this War; glorious or shameful, we\r\nwill not think of inquiring. Nor in fact of adding one word more on such\r\na War,--except, what everybody longs for, That, NOVEMBER 27th, 1778,\r\nCzarina Catharine, by her Prince Galitzin at Vienna, intervened in the\r\nmatter, in a lofty way; and ended it. Czarina Catharine,--small thanks\r\nto her, it seems, for it was Friedrich that by his industries and\r\nworld-diplomacies, French and other, had got her Turks, who had been\r\ngiving trouble again, compesced into peace for her; and indeed, to\r\nFriedrich or his interests, though bound by Treaty, she had small regard\r\nin taking this step, but wished merely to appear in German Politics as\r\na She-Jove,--Czarina Catharine signified, in high and peremptory though\r\npolite Diplomatic terms, at Vienna, \"Imperial Madam, how long is such a\r\nWar to last? Be at Peace, both of you; or--! I shall, however, mediate,\r\nif you like, being the hearty friend of both.\" [Copy of Galitzin's\r\n\"Declaration,\" in FISCHER, ii. 406-411.]\r\n\r\n\"Do,\" answers Maria Theresa, whose finance is quite out, whose motherly\r\nheart is almost broken, though a young Kaiser still prances violently,\r\nand kicks against the pricks: \"Do, your noble Czarish Majesty; France\r\ntoo is interfering: France and you will decide what is just, and we will\r\nend.\" \"Congress of Teschen\" met accordingly, MARCH 10th, 1779: Teschen,\r\nin Austrian Silesia, where we have been;--Repnin as Russian, Breteuil\r\nthe Frenchman, Cobentzl and Hertzberg as Austrian and Prussian;--and,\r\nMAY 13th (in two months' time, not in two weeks', as had been expected,\r\nfor there rose unexpected haggles), did close everything, firm as\r\nDiplomacy could do it, into equitable, or approximately equitable\r\nfinis: \"Go home, you Austria; quit your stolen Bavaria (all but a rim or\r\nparing, Circle of Burghausen, since you must have something!): Saxony,\r\nMecklenburg, these must be satisfied to moderate length; and therewith\r\ngeneral AS-YOU-WERE.\"\r\n\r\nRussia and France were agreed on the case; and Friedrich, bitterly\r\nlonging to have done with it, had said to himself, \"In two weeks or so:\"\r\nbut it proved far otherwise. Never were such hagglings, provocations and\r\nunreasonable confusions as now rose. The burning of Habelschwert was but\r\na type of them. Haggles on the part of worthless Karl Theodor, kindled\r\nby Joseph and his Kaunitz, kicking against the pricks. Haggles on\r\nSaxony's part: \"I claimed 7,000,000 pounds sterling, and you allow me\r\n600,000 pounds.\" \"Better that than nothing,\" answered Friedrich. Haggles\r\nwith Mecklenburg: \"Instead of my Leuchtenberg, I get an improvement in\r\nmy Law-Courts, right of Judging without Appeal; what is that!\"\r\nHaggles with the once grateful Duke of Zweibruck: \"Can't part with my\r\nBurghausen.\" \"Suppose you had had to part with your Bavaria altogether?\"\r\nIn short, Friedrich, who had gained nothing for himself, but such\r\ninfinity of outlay in all kinds, never saw such a coil of human follies\r\nand cupidities before; and had to exhaust his utmost patience, submit\r\nto new losses of his own, and try all his dexterities in pig-driving:\r\noverjoyed, at last, to get out of it on any terms. Outlay of Friedrich\r\nis about Two Millions sterling, and above 10,000 men's lives (his own\r\nnarrowly not included), with censures, criticisms, provocations and\r\nbotherations without end. In return for which, he has, truly, put a\r\nspoke in Austria's proud wheel for this time, and managed to see fair\r\nplay in the Reich; which had seemed to him, and seems, a considerable\r\nthing. By way of codicil, Austria agrees not to chicane him in regard to\r\nAnspach-Baireuth,--how generous of Austria, after this experience!--\r\n\r\nIn reality, the War was an Imaginary War; deserving on its own score\r\nlittle record anywhere; to readers here requiring almost less than it\r\nhas got. Schmettau, Schoning and others have been abundantly minute\r\nupon it; but even to soldiers there is little either of interest or\r\ninstruction; to us, all it yields is certain Anecdotes of Friedrich's\r\ntemper and ways in that difficult predicament; which, as coming at\r\nfirst-hand, gathered for us by punctual authentic Schmettau, who was\r\nconstantly about him, with eyes open and note-book ready, have a kind of\r\nworth in the Biographic point of view.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian Soldiery, of whom we see a type in Schmettau, were\r\ndisgusted with this War, and called it, in allusion to the foraging, A\r\nscramble for potatoes, \"DER KARTOFFEL-KRIEG, The Potato War;\" which\r\nis its common designation to this day. The Austrians, in a like humor,\r\ncalled it \"ZWETSCHKEN-RUMMEL\" (say \"THREE-BUTTON Loo\"); a game not worth\r\nplaying; especially not at such cost. Combined cost counted to have been\r\nin sum-total 4,350,000 pounds and 20,000 men. [Preuss, iv. 115.]\r\n\"The Prussian Army was full of ardor, never abler for fight\" (insists\r\nSchmettau), which indeed seems to have been the fact on every small\r\noccasion;--\"but fatally forbidden to try.\" Not so fatally perhaps, had\r\nSchmettau looked beyond his epaulettes: was not the thing, by that slow\r\nmethod, got done? By the swifter method, awakening a new Seven-Years\r\nbusiness, how infinitely costlier might it have been!\r\n\r\nSchmettau's NARRATIVE, deducting the endless lamentings, especially the\r\nextensive didactic digressions, is very clear, ocular, exact; and, in\r\ncontrast with Friedrich's own, is really amusing to read. A Schmettau\r\ngiving us, in his haggard light and oblique point of vision, the naked\r\ntruth, NAKED and all in a shiver; a Friedrich striving to drape it a\r\nlittle, and make it comfortable to himself. Those bits of Anecdotes in\r\nSCHMETTAU, clear, credible, as if we had seen them, are so many crevices\r\nthrough which it is curiously worth while to look.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII.--MILLER ARNOLD'S LAWSUIT.\r\n\r\nAbout the Second Law-Reform, after reading and again reading much dreary\r\ndetail, I can say next to nothing, except that it is dated as beginning\r\nin 1776, near thirty years after Cocceji's; [\"In 1748\" Cocceji's was\r\ncompleted; \"in 1774-1775,\" on occasion of the Silesian Reviews, Von\r\nCarmer, Chancellor of Silesia, knowing of the King's impatience at the\r\nstate of Law, presented successively Two MEMORIALS on the subject; the\r\nSecond of which began \"4th January, 1776\" to have visible fruit.] that\r\nevidently, by what causes is not stated, but may be readily enough\r\nconjectured (in the absence of Cocceji by death, and of a Friedrich\r\nby affairs of War), the abuses of Law had again become more or less\r\nunendurable to this King; that said abuses did again get some reform\r\n(again temporary, such the Law of Nature, which bids you sweep\r\nvigorously your kitchen, though it will next moment recommence the\r\ngathering of dirt upon it); and that, in fine, after some reluctance in\r\nthe Law circles, and debating PRO and CONTRA, oral some of it, and done\r\nin the King's presence, who is so intent to be convinced and see his\r\npractical way in it, [At Potsdam, \"4th January, 1776,\" Debate, by\r\nsolemn appointment, in the King's presence (King very unwell), between\r\nSilesian-Chancellor von Carmer and Grand-Chancellor von Furst, as to the\r\nfeasibility of Carmer's ideas; old Furst strong in the negative;--King,\r\nafter reflection, determining to go on nevertheless. (Rodenbeck, iii.\r\n131, 133.)]--there was, as supplement to the mere Project or Theory of\r\na CODEX FREDERICIANUS in Cocceji's time, an actual PRUSSIAN CODE set\r\nabout; Von Carmer, the Silesian Chancellor, the chief agent: and a\r\nFirst Folio, or a First and partly a Second of it, were brought out in\r\nFriedrich's lifetime, the remainder following in that of his Successor;\r\nwhich Code is ever since the Law of the Prussian Nation to this day.\r\n[Not finished and promulgated till \"5th February, 1794;\" First Volume\r\n(containing PROZESS-ORDNUNG, Form of Procedure, in all its important\r\ndetails) had come out \"26th April, 1784\" (Preuss, iii. 418-422).] Of\r\nits worth as a Code I have heard favorable opinions, comparatively\r\nfavorable; but can myself say nothing: famed Savigny finds it superior\r\nin intelligence and law-knowledge to the CODE NAPOLEON,--upon which\r\nindeed, and upon all Codes possible to poor hag-ridden and wig-ridden\r\ngenerations like ours, Savigny feels rather desperate. Unfortunate\r\nmortals do want to have their bits of lawsuits settled, nevertheless;\r\nand have, on trial, found even the ignorant CODE NAPOLEON a mighty\r\nbenefit in comparison to none!--\r\n\r\nReaders all see how this Second Prussian Law-Reform was a thing\r\nimportant to Prussia, of liveliest interest to the then King of Prussia;\r\nand were my knowledge of it greater than it is, this is all I could\r\nhope to say of it that would be suitable or profitable at present. Let\r\nwell-disposed readers take it up in their imaginations, as a fact and\r\nmass of facts, very serious there and then; and color with it in some\r\ndegree those five or six last years of this King's life.\r\n\r\nConnected with this Second Law Reform, and indeed partially a source of\r\nit, or provocation to go on with it, mending your speed, there is one\r\nlittle Lawsuit, called the MILLER ARNOLD CASE, which made an immense\r\nnoise in the world, and is still known by rumor to many persons, who\r\nwould probably be thankful, as certainly I myself should, for some\r\nintelligible word on it. In regard to which, and to which alone, in this\r\nplace, we will permit ourselves a little more detail.\r\n\r\nIn the sandy moors towards the Silesian border of the Neumark, southwest\r\nof Zullichau,--where we once were, with Dictator Wedell, fighting the\r\nRussians in a tragic way,--there is, as was casually then indicated,\r\non one of the poor Brooks trickling into Oder, a Mill called KREBSMUHLE\r\n(Crabmill); Millers of which are a line of dusty Arnolds, laboriously\r\nfor long generations grinding into meal the ryes, pulses, barleys of\r\nthat dim region; who, and whose Crabmill, in the year 1779-1780,\r\nburst into a notoriety they little dreamt of, and became famous in the\r\nfashionable circles of this Universe, where an indistinct rumor of them\r\nlives to this day. We indicated Arnold and his Mill in Wedell's time;\r\nWedell's scene being so remote and empty to readers: in fact,\r\nnobody knows on what paltriest of moors a memorable thing will not\r\nhappen;--here, for instance, is withal the Birthplace of that Rhyming\r\nmiracle, Frau Karsch (Karschin, KarchESS as they call her), the Berlin\r\nliterary Prodigy, to whom Friedrich was not so flush of help as had\r\nbeen expected. The child of utterly poor Peasants there; whose poverty,\r\nshining out as thrift, unweariable industry and stoical valor, is\r\nbeautiful to me, still more their poor little girl's bits of fortunes,\r\n\"tending three cows\" in the solitudes there, and gazing wistfully into\r\nEarth and Heaven with her ingenuous little soul,--desiring mainly\r\none thing, that she could get Books, any Book whatever; having\r\nhalf-accidentally picked up the art of reading, and finding hereabouts\r\nabsolutely nothing to read. Frau Karsch, I have no doubt, knows the\r\nCrabmill right well; and can, to all permissible lengths, inform the\r\nBerlin Circles on this point. [See JORDENS (Karschin), ii. 607-640.] An\r\nexcellent Silesian Nobleman lifted her miraculously from the sloughs of\r\nmisery, landed her from his travelling-carriage in the upper world of\r\nBerlin, \"January, 1761\" (age then thirty-nine, husband Karsch a wretched\r\ndrunken Tailor at Glogau, who thereupon enlisted, and happily got\r\nshot or finished): Berlin's enthusiasm was, and continued to be,\r\nconsiderable;--Karschin's head, I fear, proved weakish, though her\r\nrhyming faculty was great. Friedrich saw her once, October, 1763,\r\nspoke kindly to her (DIALOGUE reported by herself, with a Chodowiecki\r\nENGRAVING to help, in the MUSEN-ALMANACHS ensuing); and gave her a\r\n10 pounds, but never much more:--\"somebody had done me ill with him,\"\r\nthinks the Karschin (not thinking, \"Or perhaps nobody but my poor self,\r\nand my weakness of head\"). She continued rhyming and living--certain\r\nPrincipalities and High People still standing true--till \"12th October,\r\n1791.\"\r\n\r\nCrabmill is in Pommerzig Township, not far from Kay:--Zullichau, Kay,\r\nPalzig, Crossen, all come to speech again, in this Narrative; fancy how\r\nthey turned up in Berlin dinner-circles, to Dictator Wedell, gray old\r\ngentleman, who is now these many years War-Minister, peaceable, and\r\nwell accepted, but remembers the flamy youth he had. Landlord of these\r\nArnolds and their Mill is Major Graf von Schmettau (no connection of our\r\nSchmettaus),--to what insignificantly small amount of rent, I could\r\nnot learn on searching; 10 pounds annually is a too liberal guess.\r\nInnumerable things, of no pertinency to us, are wearisomely told, and\r\never again told, while the pertinent are often missed out, in that\r\ndreary cart-load of Arnold Law-Papers, barely readable, barely\r\nintelligible, to the most patient intellect: with despatch let us fish\r\nup the small cardinal particles of it, and arrange in some chronological\r\nor human order, that readers may form to themselves an outline of the\r\nthing. In 1759, we mentioned that this Mill was going; Miller of it an\r\nold Arnold, Miller's Lad a young. Here is the subsequent succession of\r\noccurrences that concern us.\r\n\r\nIn 1762, Young Arnold, as I dimly gather, had got married, apparently\r\na Wife with portion; bought the Mill from his Father, he and Wife\r\nco-possessors thenceforth;--\"Rosine his Spouse\" figuring jointly in all\r\nthese Law-Papers; and the Spouse especially as a most shifty litigant.\r\nThere they continue totally silent to mankind for about eight years.\r\nHappy the Nation, much more may we say the Household, \"whose Public\r\nHistory is blank.\" But in the eighth year,\r\n\r\nIn 1770, Freyherr Baron von Gersdorf in Kay, who lies farther up the\r\nstream, bethinks him of Fish-husbandry; makes a Fish-pond to himself,\r\nand for part supply thereof, lays some beam or weir across the poor\r\nBrook, and deducts a part of Arnold's water.\r\n\r\nIn 1773, the Arnolds fall into arrear of rent: \"Want of water; Fish-pond\r\nspoils our water,\" plead they to Major Graf von Schmettau. \"Prosecute\r\nVon Gersdorf, then,\" says Schmettau: \"I must have my rent! You shall\r\nhave time, lengthened terms; but pay THEN, or else-!\" For four years\r\nthe Arnolds tried more or less to pay, but never could, or never did\r\ncompletely: during which period Major von Schmettau had them up in his\r\nCourt of Pommerzig,--manorial or feudal kind of Court; I think it is\r\nmore or less his, though he does not sit there; and an Advocate, not\r\nof his appointing, though probably of his accepting, dispenses justice\r\nthere. Schlecker is the Advocate's name; acquitted by all Official\r\npeople of doing anything wrong. No appearance that the Herr Graf von\r\nSchmettau put hand to the balances of justice in this Court; with his\r\neye, however, who knows but he might act on them more or less! And, at\r\nany rate, be suspected by distressed Arnolds, especially by a distressed\r\nFrau Arnold, of doing so. The Frau Arnold had a strong suspicion that\r\nway; and seems to have risen occasionally upon Schlecker, who did once\r\norder the poor woman to be locked up for contempt of Court: \"Only two\r\nhours!\" asseverates Schlecker afterwards; after which she came out cool\r\nand respectful to Court.\r\n\r\nNot the least account survives of those procedures in Schlecker's Court;\r\nbut by accident, after many readings, you light upon a little fact which\r\ndoes shed a transient ray over them. Namely, that already in 1775, four\r\nyears before the Case became audible in Official circles, much more in\r\ngeneral society, Frau Arnold had seized an opportunity, Majesty being\r\nat Crossen in those neighborhoods, and presented a Petition: \"Oh,\r\njust King, appoint a MILITARY COMMISSION to investigate our business;\r\nimpartial Officers will speedily find out the facts, and decide what\r\nis just!\" [Preuss, iii. 382.] Which denotes an irritating experience in\r\nSchlecker's Court. Certain it is, Schlecker's Court did, in this tedious\r\nharassing way, decide against Frau Arnold in every point. \"Pay Herr Graf\r\nvon Schmettau, or else disappear; prosecute Von Gersdorf, if you like!\"\r\nAnd, in fine, as the Arnolds could not pay up, nor see any daylight\r\nthrough prosecuting Baron von Gersdorf, the big gentleman in\r\nKay,--Schlecker, after some five years of this, decreed Sale of the\r\nMill:--and sold it was. In Zullichau, September 7th, 1778, there is\r\nAuction of the Mill; Herr Landeinnehmer (CESS-COLLECTOR) Kuppisch bought\r\nit; knocked down to him for the moderate sum of 600 thalers, or 90\r\npounds sterling, and the Arnolds are an ousted family. \"September\r\n7th,\"--Potato-War just closing its sad Campaign; to-morrow, march for\r\nTrautenau, thirty horses to a gun.--\r\n\r\nThe Arnolds did make various attempts and appeals to the Neumark\r\nREGIERUNG (College of Judges); but it was without the least result.\r\n\"Schlecker right in every point; Gersdorf right,\" answered the College:\r\n\"go, will you!\" A Mill forfeited by every Law, and fallen to the\r\nhighest bidder. Cess-Collector Kuppisch, it was soon known, had sold\r\nhis purchase to Von Gersdorf: \"Hah!\" said the rural public, smelling\r\nsomething bad. Certain it is, Von Gersdorf is become proprietor both of\r\nPond and Mill; and it is not to the ruined Arnolds that Schlecker law\r\ncan seem an admirable sample. And truly, reading over those barrow-loads\r\nof pleadings and RELATIONES, one has to admit that, taken as a reason\r\nfor seeing oneself ruined, and one's Mill become the big gentleman's who\r\nfancies carp, they do seem considerably insufficient. The Law-Pleadings\r\nare duly voluminous. Barrow-loads of them, dreariest reading in\r\nCreation, remain; going into all manner of questions, proving, from\r\nGrotius and others, that landlords have rights upon private rivers, and\r\nanother sort upon public ditto; that Von Gersdorf, by Law of 1566, had\r\nverily the right to put down his Fish-pond,--whether Schmettau the\r\nduty to indemnify Arnold for the same? that is not touched upon: nor,\r\nsingular to say, is it anywhere made out, or attempted to be made out,\r\nHow much of water Arnold lost by the Pond, much less what degree of real\r\nimpediment, by loss of his own time, by loss of his customers (tired of\r\nsuch waiting on a mill), Arnold suffered by the Pond. This, which you\r\nwould have thought the soul of the matter, is absolutely left out;\r\naltogether unsettled,--after, I think, four, or at least three, express\r\nCommissions had sat on it, at successive times, with the most esteemed\r\nhydraulic sages opining and examining;--and remains, like the part of\r\nHamlet, omitted by particular desire. No wonder Frau Arnold begged for\r\na Military Commission; that is to say, a decision from rational human\r\ncreatures, instead of juridical wigs proceeding at this rate.\r\n\r\nIt was some time in 1775 that Rosine (what we reckoned a very\r\nelucidative point!) had given in her Petition to the King at Crossen,\r\nshowing how ill Schlecker was using them. She now, \"about Mayday, 1779,\"\r\nin a new Petition, referred to that, and again begged a Commission of\r\nSoldier-people to settle it. May 4th, 1779,--King not yet home, but\r\ncoming, [\"Arrived at Berlin May 27th\" (Rodenbeck, iii. 201).]--King's\r\nCabinet, on Order, \"SENDS this to Justice-Department;\" nothing SAID\r\non it, the existence of the Petition sufficiently SAYING.\r\nJustice-Department thereupon demands the Law-Records, documentary\r\nNarrative of RES Arnold, from Custrin; finds all right: \"Peace, ye\r\nArnolds; what would you have?\" [Preuss, iii. 382.]\r\n\r\nSame year, 1779 (no express date), Grand-Chancellor von Furst, being at\r\nCustrin, officially examining the condition of Law-matters, Frau Arnold\r\nfailed not to try there also with a Petition: \"See, great Law-gentleman\r\ncome to reform abuses, can that possibly be Law; or if so, is it not\r\nInjustice as well?\" \"Tush!\" answered Furst;--for I believe Law-people,\r\never since this new stringency of Royal vigilance upon them, are plagued\r\nwith such complaints from Dorfships and dark greedy Peasant people;\r\n\"Tush!\" and flung it promptly into his waste-basket.\r\n\r\nIs there no hope at all, then? Arnold remembers that a Brother of his\r\nis a Prussian soldier; and that he has for Colonel, Prince Leopold of\r\nBrunswick, a Prince always kind to the poor. The Leopold Regiment\r\nlies at Frankfurt: try Prince Leopold by that channel. Prince Leopold\r\nlistened;--the Soldier Arnold probably known to him as rational and\r\nrespectable. Prince Leopold now likewise applies to Furst: \"A defect,\r\nnot of Law, Herr Kanzler, but of Equity, there does seem. Schmettau had\r\na right to his rent; Von Gersdorf, by Deed of 1566, to his Pond: but\r\nthe Arnolds had not water and have lost their Mill. Could not there,\"\r\nsuggests Leopold, \"be appointed, without noise of any kind, a Commission\r\nof neutral people, strangers to the Neumark, to search this matter\r\nto the actual root of it, and let Equity ensue?\" To whom also Furst\r\nanswers, though in a politer shape, \"Tush, Durchlaucht! Every man to his\r\ntrade!\"\r\n\r\nSo that Prince Leopold himself, the King's own Nephew, proves futile?\r\nSome think Leopold did, this very Autumn, casually, or as if casually,\r\nmention the matter to the King,--whose mind is uneasily awake to\r\nall such cases, knowing what a buckram set his Lawyers are. \"At the\r\nReviews,\" as these people say, Leopold could not have done it; there\r\nbeing, this Year, no Reviews, merely return of King and Army from the\r\nBavarian War. But during August, and on into September this Year, it\r\nis very evident, there was a Visit of the Brunswick Family at Potsdam,\r\n[Rodenbeck, iii. 206 et seq.] Leopold's Mamma and certain of his\r\nBrothers,--of which, Colonel Prince Leopold, though not expressly\r\nmentioned in the Books, may very possibly have been permitted, for a day\r\nor two, to form part, for Mamma's behoof and his own; and may have made\r\nhis casual observation, at some well-chosen moment, with the effect\r\nintended. In which case, Leopold was by no means futile, but proved,\r\nafter all, to be the saving clause for the Arnolds.\r\n\r\nGallant young fellow, one loves to believe it of him; and to add it to\r\nthe one other fact now known of him, which was also beautiful, though\r\ntragic. Six years after, Spring, 1785, Oder River, swollen by rains, was\r\nin wild deluge; houses in the suburbs like to be washed away. Leopold,\r\nlooking on it from the Bridge or shore, perhaps partly with an Official\r\neye, saw the inhabitants of some houses like to be drowned;\r\nlooked wildly for assistance, but found none; and did, himself, in\r\nuncontrollable pity, dash off in a little boat, through the wild-eddying\r\nsurges; and got his own death there, himself drowned in struggling to\r\nsave others. Which occasioned loud lamentation in the world; in his poor\r\nMother's heart what unnamable voiceless lamentation! [Friedrich's Letter\r\nto her: _OEuvres de Frederic,_ xxvii. i. 351 (\"12th May, 1785\").] He had\r\nfounded a Garrison School at Frankfurt; spared no expenditure of pains\r\nor of money. A man adored in Frankfurt. \"His Brother Friedrich, in\r\nmemory of him, presented, next year, the Uniform in which Leopold was\r\ndrowned, to the Freemason Lodge of Berlin, of which he had been member.\"\r\n[_Militair-Lexikon,_ i. 24.] SUNT LACRYMAE RERUM.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Arnolds, and have done with them: for we are now,\r\nby Leopold's help or otherwise, got to the last act of that tedious\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nAugust 21st, 1779 (these high Brunswickers still at Potsdam, if that had\r\nany influence), the Arnolds again make Petition to the King: \"Alas, no\r\njustice yet, your Majesty!\" \"Shall we never see the end of this, then?\"\r\nthinks the King: \"some Soldier, with human eyes, let him, attended by\r\none of their Law-wigs, go upon the ground; and search it!\" And,\r\nnext day, having taken Protocol of the Arnold Complaint, issues\r\nCabinet-Order, or King's Message to the Custrin Law-wigs: \"Colonel\r\nHeucking [whose regiment lies in Zullichau district, a punctual enough\r\nman], he shall be the Soldier; to whom do YOU adjoin what member of\r\nyour Court you think the fittest: and let, at last, justice be done. And\r\nswift, if you please!\"\r\n\r\nThe Custrin Regierung, without delay, name REGIERUNGS-RATH Neumann; who\r\nis swiftly ready, as is Colonel Heucking swiftly,--and they two set out\r\ntogether up the Pommerzig Brook, over that moor Country; investigating,\r\npondering, hearing witnesses, and no doubt consulting, and diligently\r\nendeavoring to get to the bottom of this poor Arnold question. For how\r\nmany September days, I know not: everybody knows, however, that they\r\ncould not agree; in other words, that they saw TWO bottoms to it,--the\r\nLaw gentleman one bottom, the Soldier another. \"True bottom is already\r\nthere,\" argued the Law gentleman: \"confirm Decision of Court in\r\nevery point.\" \"No; Arnold has lost water, has suffered wrong,\" thinks\r\nHeucking; \"that is the true bottom.\" And so they part, each with his\r\nown opinion. Neumann affirmed afterwards, that the Colonel came with a\r\npredetermination that way, and even that he said, once or oftener, in\r\nhis eagerness to persuade: \"His Majesty has got it into his thought;\r\nthere will be nothing but trouble if you persist in that notion.\"\r\nTo which virtuous Neumann was deaf. Neumann also says, The Colonel,\r\nacquainted with Austrian enemies, but not with Law, had brought with him\r\nhis Regiment's-Auditor, one Bech, formerly a Law-practitioner in Crossen\r\n(readers know Crossen, and Ex-Dictator Wedell does),--Law-practitioner\r\nin Crossen; who had been in strife with the Custrin Regierung, under\r\nrebuke from them (too importunate for some of his pauper clients,\r\nbelike); was a cunning fellow too, and had the said Regierung in\r\nill-will. An adroit fellow Bech might be, or must have been; but his now\r\noffice of Regiment's-Auditor is certificate of honesty,--good, at least,\r\nagainst Neumann.\r\n\r\nNeumann's Court was silent about these Neumann surmises; but said\r\nafterwards, \"Heucking had not gone to the bottom of the thing.\" This was\r\nin a subsequent report, some five or six weeks subsequent. Their present\r\nreport they redacted to the effect, \"All correct as it stood,\" without\r\nonce mentioning Heucking. Gave it in, 27th September; by which time\r\nHeucking's also was in, and had made a strong impression on his Majesty.\r\nPresumably an honest, intelligible report; though, by ill-luck for the\r\ncurious, it is now lost; among the barrow-loads of vague wigged stuff,\r\nthis one Piece, probably human, is not to be discovered.\r\n\r\nFriedrich's indignation at the Custrin report, \"Perfectly correct as\r\nit stood,\" and no mention of Heucking or his dissent, was considerable:\r\nalready, 27th September,--that is, on the very day while those Custrin\r\npeople were signing their provoking report,--Friedrich, confident\r\nin Heucking, had transmitted to his Supreme Board of Justice\r\n(KAMMERGERICHT) the impartial Heucking's account of the affair, with\r\norder, \"See there, an impartial human account, clear and circumstantial\r\n(DEUTLICHES UND GANZ UMSTANDLICHES), going down to the true roots of the\r\nbusiness: swift, get me justice for these Arnolds!\" [Preuss, iii. 480.]\r\nScarcely was this gone, when, September 29th, the Custrin impertinence,\r\n\"Perfectly right as it stood,\" came to hand; kindling the King into hot\r\nprovocation; \"extreme displeasure, AUSSERSTES MISFALLEN,\" as his Answer\r\nbore: \"Rectify me all that straightway, and relieve these Arnolds of\r\ntheir injuries!\" You Pettifogging Pedant Knaves, bring that Arnold\r\nmatter to order, will you; you had better!--\r\n\r\nThe Custrin Knaves, with what feelings I know not, proceed accordingly;\r\nappoint a new Commission, one or more Lawyers in it, and at least one\r\nHydraulic Gentleman in it, Schade the name of him; who are to go upon\r\nthe ground, hear witnesses and the like. Who went accordingly; and\r\nmanaged, not too fast, Hydraulic Schade rather disagreeing from the\r\nLegal Gentlemen, to produce a Report, reported UPON by the Custrin\r\nCourt, 28th October: \"That there is one error found: 6 pounds 12s. as\r\nvalue of corn LEFT, clearly Arnold's that, when his Mill was sold; that,\r\nwith this improvement, all is NOW correct to the uttermost; and that\r\nHeucking had not investigated things to the bottom.\" By some accident,\r\nthis Report did not come at once to Friedrich, or had escaped his\r\nattention; so that--\r\n\r\nNovember 21st, matters hanging fire in this way, Frau Arnold applies\r\nagain, by Petition to his Majesty; upon which is new Royal Order, [Ib.\r\niii. 490.] far more patient than might have been expected: \"In God's\r\nname, rectify me that Arnold matter, and let us at last see the end of\r\nit!\" To which the Custriners answer: \"All is rectified, your Majesty.\r\nFrau Arnold, in her Petition, has not mentioned that she gained 6\r\npounds 12s.;\"--important item that; 6 pounds 12s. for CORN left (clearly\r\nArnold's that, when his Mill was sold)! \"Our sentence we cannot alter; a\r\nCourt's sentence is alterable only by appeal; your Majesty decides where\r\nthe appeal is to lie!\" Friedrich's patience is now wearing out; but\r\nhe does not yet give way: \"Berlin Kammergericht be your Appeal\r\nCourt,\" decides he, 28th November: and will admit of no delay on the\r\nKammergericht's part either. \"Papers all at Custrin, say you? Send for\r\nthem by express; they will come in one day: be swift, I say!\"\r\n\r\nChancellor Furst is not a willing horse in this case; but he is\r\nobliged to go. December 7th, Kammergericht sits on the Arnold Appeal;\r\nKammergericht's view is: \"Custrin papers all here, not the least delay\r\npermitted; you, Judge Rannsleben, take these Papers to you; down\r\nupon them: let us, if humanly possible, have a Report by to-morrow.\"\r\nRannsleben takes the Papers in hand December 7th; works upon them all\r\nday, and all night following, at a rate of energy memorable among Legal\r\ngentlemen; and December 8th attends with lucid Report upon them, or\r\ncouple of Reports; one on Arnold VERSUS Schmettau, in six folios; one on\r\nArnold VERSUS Gersdorf, in two ditto; draws these two Documents from his\r\npocket December 8th; reads them in assembled Court (six of the Judges\r\npresent) [Preuss, iii. 496.],--which, with marked thankfulness to the\r\nswift Rannsleben, at once adopts his Report, and pronounces upon the\r\nCustrin Raths, \"Right in every particular.\" Witness our hands: every one\r\naffixing his signature, as to a matter happily got done with.\r\n\r\nIt was Friday, 10th December, 1779, before Friedrich got this fine bit\r\nof news; Saturday 11th, before he authentically saw their Sentence. He\r\nis lying miserably ill of gout in the Schloss of Berlin; and I suppose,\r\nsince his Father, of blessed memory, took cudgel to certain Judges and\r\nknocked out teeth from them, and broke the judicial crowns, nobody in\r\nthat Schloss has been in such humor against men of Law. \"Attend me here\r\nat 2 P.M. with the Three Raths who signed in Arnold's Case:\" Saturday,\r\nabout 11 A.M., Chancellor Furst receives this command; gets Rannsleben,\r\nand two others, Friedel, Graun,--and there occurred such a scene--But it\r\nwill be better to let Rannsleben himself tell the story; who has left\r\nan AUTOBIOGRAPHY, punctually correct, to all appearance, but except this\r\nalone notable passage of it, still unpublished, and like to continue\r\nso:--\r\n\r\n\"BERLIN, TUESDAY, 7th DECEMBER, 1779,\" says Rannsleben (let him tell it\r\nagain in his own words), \"the ACTA, which had arrived from Custrin IN RE\r\nMiller Arnold and his Wife VERSUS Landrath von Gersdorf, as also those,\r\nin the same matter, VERSUS Count von Schmettau, were assigned to me, to\r\nbe reported on QUAM PRIMUM;--our President von Rebeur,\" President of\r\nthe Supreme KAMMERGERICHT (King's-Chamber Tribunal, say Exchequer High\r\nCourt, or COLLEGIUM), whereof I have the honor to be one of the Seven\r\nJudges, or RATHS,--\"our President von Rebeur enjoining me to make such\r\nutmost despatch that my Report on both these sets of Papers might be\r\nread to the assembled Court next day; whereby said Court might then and\r\nthere be enabled to pronounce judgment on the same, I at once set to\r\nwork; went on with it all night; and on the morrow I brought both my\r\nReports (RELATIONES),\"--one referring to the Gersdorf, the other to\r\nthe Schmettau part of the suit,--\"one of six sheets, the other of two\r\nsheets, to the Kammergericht; where both RELATIONES were read. There\r\nwere present, besides me, the following six members of the COLLEGIUM:\r\nPresident von Rebeur, Raths Uhl, Friedel, Kircheisen, Graun, Gassler.\r\n\r\n\"Appellant,\" as we all know, \"was Miller Arnold; and along with the ACTA\r\nwere various severe Cabinet-Orders, in which the King, who had taken\r\nquite particular notice of the Case, positively enjoined, That Miller\r\nArnold should have justice done him. The King had not, however, given\r\nformally any authoritative Decision of his own (KEINEN EIGENTLICHEN\r\nMACHTSPRUCH GETHAN),\" which might have given us pause, though not\r\nfull-stop by any means: \"but, in his Order to the Kammergericht, had\r\nmerely said, we were to decide with the utmost despatch, and then at\r\nonce inform his Majesty how.\" With the speed of light or of thought,\r\nRannsleben hardly done reading, this Kammergericht decided,--it is well\r\nknown how: \"In the King's name; right in every particular, you Custrin\r\nGentlemen;--which be so good as publish to parties concerned!\"\r\n\r\nReport of Kammergericht's Judgment to this effect, for behoof of\r\nCustrin, was at once got under way; and Kammergericht, in regard to his\r\nMajesty, agreed merely to announce the fact in that quarter: \"Judgment\r\narrived at, please your Majesty;--Judgment already under way for\r\nCustrin:\"--you, Rannsleben, without saying what the Judgment is, you\r\nagain write for us. And Rannsleben does so; writes the above little\r\nMessage to his Majesty, \"which got to the King's hand, Friday, December\r\n10th. And the same day,\" continues Rannsleben, \"the King despatched\r\na very severe Cabinet-Order to Minister von Dornberg,\"--head of the\r\nDepartment to which the Kammergericht belongs,--\"demanding a Copy of the\r\nJudgment. Which order was at once obeyed.\r\n\r\n\"Hereupon, on Saturday, about 11 A.M., there came to Grand-Chancellor\r\nvon Furst,\" sublime head of us and of all Lawyers, \"a Cabinet-Order,\r\n'Appear before me here, this day, at 2 o'clock; and bring with you your\r\nThree Kammergericht Raths who drew up (MINUTIRT) the Judgment in the\r\nArnold Case.'\" Message bodeful to Furst and the three Raths.\r\n\r\n\"NOTA,\" says Rannsleben here, \"the King is under the impression that, in\r\njudging a Case, Three Raths are always employed, and therefore demands\r\nThree of us. But, properly, all the above-named Six MEMBRA COLLEGII,\r\nbesides myself, ought to have gone to the Palace, or else I alone.\" On\r\nsome points an ill-informed King. Rannsleben continues:--\r\n\r\n\"President von Rebeur came to me in his carriage, at a quarter to 12;\r\ntold me of the King's Order; and said, as the King demanded only Three\r\nRaths, there was nothing for it but to name me and Raths Friedel and\r\nKircheisen, my usual partners in Judgment business. Finding, however,\r\non looking into the Sentence itself, that Kircheisen was not amongst the\r\nsigners of it, he [Rebeur] named, instead of him, Rath Graun, who was.\r\nFor the Herr President apprehended the King might demand to see our\r\nSentence IN ORIGINALI, and would then be angry that a person had been\r\nsent to him who had not signed the same. President von Rebeur instructed\r\nme farther, That I, as Reporter in the Case, was to be spokesman at the\r\nPalace; and should explain to his Majesty the reasons which had weighed\r\nwith the Kammergericht in coming to such decision.\r\n\r\n\"To my dear Wife I,\" as beseemed a good husband, \"said nothing of all\r\nthis; confiding it only to my Father-in-law, who tried to cheer me. Nor,\r\nindeed, did I feel any fear within me, being persuaded in my conscience\r\nthat, in this decision of the Arnold Case, I had proceeded according to\r\nthe best of my knowledge and conviction.\r\n\r\n\"At 1 o'clock I drove to the Grand-Chancellor's, where I found the\r\nRaths Friedel and Graun already arrived. The Chancellor,\" old Furst,\r\n\"instructed us as to what we had to do when we came before the King. And\r\nthen, towards 2 o'clock, he took us in his carriage to the Palace. We\r\nentered the room immediately at the end of the Great Hall. Here we found\r\na heyduc [tall porter], by whom the Chancellor announced to the King\r\nthat we were here. Heyduc soon came back to inquire, Whether the\r\nCABINETS-RATH Stellter,\" a Secretary or Short-hand writer of his\r\nMajesty's, \"had arrived yet; and whether we [WE, what a doubt!] were\r\nPrivy Councillors. We were then shortly after shown in to the King. We\r\npassed through three rooms, the second of which was that in which stands\r\nthe CONFIDENZ TAFEL [Table that goes by pulleys through the floor, and\r\ncomes up refurnished, when you wish to be specially private with your\r\nfriends]. In the fourth, a small room with one window, was the King. The\r\nChancellor walked first; I followed him close; behind me came the Rath\r\nFriedel, and then Graun. Some way within, opposite the door, stood a\r\nscreen; with our backs to this,\" the Kingward side of this, \"we ranged\r\nourselves,\"--in respectful row of Four, Furst at the inward end of us\r\n(right or left is no matter). \"The King sat in the middle of the room,\r\nso that he could look point-blank at us; he sat with his back to the\r\nchimney, in which there was a fire burning. He had on a worn hat, of the\r\nclerical shape [old-military in fact, not a shovel at all]; CASSAQUIN,\"\r\nshort dressing-gown, \"of red-brown (MORDORE) velvet; black breeches, and\r\nboots which came quite up over the knee. His hair was not dressed. Three\r\nlittle benchlets or stools, covered with green cloth, stood before him,\r\non which he had his feet lying [terribly ill of gout]. In his lap he had\r\na sort of muff, with one of his hands in it, which seemed to be giving\r\nhim great pain. In the other hand he held our Sentence on the Arnold\r\nCase. He lay reclining (LAG) in an easy-chair; at his left stood a\r\ntable, with various papers on it,--and two gold snuffboxes, richly set\r\nwith brilliants, from which he kept taking snuff now and then.\r\n\r\n\"Besides us, there was present in the room the Cabinets-Rath Stellter\r\n[of the short-hand], who stood at a desk, and was getting ready for\r\nwriting. The King looked at us, saying, 'Come nearer!' Whereupon we\r\nadvanced another step, and were now within less than two steps of him.\r\nHe addressed himself to us three Raths, taking no notice at all of the\r\nGrand-Chancellor:--\r\n\r\nKING. \"'Is it you who drew up the judgment in the Arnold case?'\r\n\r\nWE (especially I, with a bow). \"'Yea.'\r\n\r\n\"The King then turned to the Rath Friedel [to Friedel, as the central\r\nfigure of the Three, perhaps as the portliest, though poor Friedel,\r\nexcept signing, had little cognizance of the thing, in which not he but\r\nRannsleben was to have been spokesman], and addressed to Friedel those\r\nquestions, of which, with their answers, there is Protocol published,\r\nunder Royal authority, in the Berlin newspapers of December 14th, 1779;\"\r\n[VON SEINER KONIGLICHEN MAJESTAT HOCHSTSELBAT ANGEHALTENES PROTOCOLL:\r\n\"Protocol [Minute of Proceedings] held by Royal Majesty's Highest-self,\r\non the 11th December, 1779, concerning the three Kammergerichts-Raths,\r\nFriedel, Graun and Rannsleben:\" in PREUSS, iii. 495.] Shorthand Stellter\r\ntaking down what was said,--quite accurately, testifies Rannsleben. From\r\nStellter (that is to say from the \"Protocol\" just mentioned), or from\r\nStellter and Rannsleben together, we continue the Dialogue:--\r\n\r\nKING to Friedel [in the tone of a Rhadamanthus suffering from gout].\r\n\"'To give sentence against a Peasant from whom you have taken wagon,\r\nplough and everything that enables him to get his living, and to pay his\r\nrent and taxes: is that a thing that can be done?'\r\n\r\nFRIEDEL (and the two Mutes, bowing). \"'No.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'May a Miller who has no water, and consequently cannot grind,\r\nand, therefore, not earn anything, have his mill taken from him, on\r\naccount of his not having paid his rent: is that just?'\r\n\r\nFRIEDEL (and Mutes as aforesaid). \"'No.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'But here now is a Nobleman, wishing to make a Fish-pond: to get\r\nmore water for his Pond, he has a ditch dug, to draw into it the water\r\nfrom a small stream which drives a water-mill. Thereby the Miller loses\r\nhis water, and cannot grind; or, at most, can only grind in the spring\r\nfor the space of a fortnight, and late in the autumn, perhaps another\r\nfortnight. Yet, in spite of all this, it is pretended that the Miller\r\nshall pay his rent quite the same as at the time when he had full water\r\nfor his mill. Of course, he cannot pay his rent; his incomings are gone!\r\nAnd what does the Custrin Court of Justice do? It orders the mill to\r\nbe sold, that the Nobleman may have his rent. And the Berlin\r\nTribunal'\"--Chancellor Furst, standing painfully mute, unspoken to,\r\nunnoticed hitherto, more like a broomstick than a Chancellor, ventures\r\nto strike in with a syllable of emendation, a small correction, of these\r\nwords \"Berlin Tribunal\"--\r\n\r\nFURST (suggestively). \"'Kammergericht [mildly suggestive, and perhaps\r\nwith something in his tone which means, \"I am not a broomstick!\"]:\r\nKammergericht!'\r\n\r\nKING (to short-hand Stellter). \"'Kammergerichts-Tribunal:--[then to\r\nFurst] Go you, Sir, about your business, on the instant! Your\r\nSuccessor is appointed; with you I have nothing more to do.\r\nDisappear!'\"--\"Ordered,\" says Official Rannsleben, \"ordered the\r\nGrand-Chancellor, in very severe terms, To be gone! telling him that\r\nhis Successor was already appointed. Which order Herr von Furst, without\r\nsaying a word, hastily obeyed, passing in front of us three, with the\r\nutmost speed.\" In front,--screen, I suppose, not having room behind\r\nit,--and altogether vanishes from Friedrich's History; all but some\r\nGHOST of him (so we may term it), which reappears for an instant once,\r\nas will be noticed.\r\n\r\nKING (continues to Friedel, not in a lower tone probably):--\"'the\r\nKammergerichts-Tribunal confirms the same. That is highly unjust; and\r\nsuch Sentence is altogether contrary to his Majesty's landsfatherly\r\nintentions:--my name [you give it, \"In the King's Name,\" forsooth]\r\ncruelly abused!'\"\r\n\r\nSo far is set forth in the \"Royal Protocol printed next Tuesday,\" as\r\nwell as in Rannsleben. But from this point, the Dialogue--if it can be\r\ncalled Dialogue, being merely a rebuke and expectoration of Royal wrath\r\nagainst Friedel and his Two, who are all mute, so far as I can learn,\r\nand stand like criminals in the dock, feeling themselves unjustly\r\ncondemned--gets more and more into conflagration, and cannot be\r\ndistinctly reported. \"MY name to such a thing! When was I found to\r\noppress a poor man for love of a rich? To follow wiggeries and forms\r\nwith solemn attention, careless what became of the internal fact? Act\r\nof 1566, allowing Gersdorf to make his Pond? Like enough;--and Arnold's\r\nloss of water, that is not worth the ascertaining; you know not yet what\r\nit was, some of you even say it was nothing; care not whether it was\r\nanything. Could Arnold grind, or not, as formerly? What is Act of 1566,\r\nor any or all Acts, in comparison? Wretched mortals, had you wigs\r\na fathom long, and Law-books on your back, and Acts of 1566 by the\r\nhundredweight, what could it help, if the right of a poor man were left\r\nby you trampled under foot? What is the meaning of your sitting there\r\nas Judges? Dispensers of Right in God's Name and mine? I will make an\r\nexample of you which shall be remembered!--Out of my sight!\" Whereupon\r\nEXEUNT in haste, all Three,--though not far, not home, as will be seen.\r\n\r\nOnly the essential sense of all this, not the exact terms, could (or\r\nshould) any Stellter take in short-hand; and in the Protocol it is\r\ndecorously omitted altogether. Rannsleben merely says: \"The King farther\r\nmade use of very strong expressions against us,\"--too strong to be\r\nrepeated,--\"and, at last, dismissed us without saying what he intended\r\nto do with us. We had hardly left the room, when he followed us,\r\nordering us to wait. The King, during the interview with us, held\r\nthe Sentence, of my composition, in his hand; and seemed particularly\r\nirritated about the circumstance of the judgment being pronounced in his\r\nname, as is the usual form. He struck the paper again and again with\r\nhis other hand,\"--heat of indignation quite extinguishing gout, for the\r\nmoment,--\"exclaiming at the same time repeatedly, 'Cruelly abused my\r\nname (MEINEN NAMEN CRUEL MISSBRAUCHT)!'\" [Preuss, iii. 495-498.]--We\r\nwill now give the remaining part of the Protocol (what directly follows\r\nthe above CATECHETICAL or DIALOGUE part before that caught fire),--as\r\ntaken down by Stellter, and read in all the Newspapers next Tuesday:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"PROTOCOL [of December 11th, Title already given; [Supra, p. 439 n.]\r\nDocketing adds], WHICH IS TO BE PRINTED.\"\r\n\r\n... (CATECHETICS AS ABOVE,--AND THEN): \"The King's desire always is\r\nand was, That everybody, be he high or low, rich or poor, get prompt\r\njustice; and that, without regard of person or rank, no subject of his\r\nfail at any time of impartial right and protection from his Courts of\r\nLaw.\r\n\r\n\"Wherefore, with respect to this most unjust Sentence against the\r\nMiller Arnold of the Pommerzig Crabmill, pronounced in the Neumark, and\r\nconfirmed here in Berlin, his Majesty will establish an emphatic example\r\n(EIN NACHDRUCKLICHES EXEMPEL STATUIREN); to the end that all Courts of\r\nJustice, in all the King's Provinces, may take warning thereby, and not\r\ncommit the like glaring unjust acts. For, let them bear in mind, That\r\nthe least peasant, yea, what is still more, that even a beggar, is, no\r\nless than his Majesty, a human being, and one to whom due justice must\r\nbe meted out. All men being equal before the Law, if it is a prince\r\ncomplaining against a peasant, or VICE VERSA, the prince is the same as\r\nthe peasant before the Law; and, on such occasions, pure justice must\r\nhave its course, without regard of person: Let the Law-Courts, in all\r\nthe Provinces, take this for their rule. And whenever they do not carry\r\nout justice in a straightforward manner, without any regard of person\r\nand rank, but put aside natural fairness,--then they shall have to\r\nanswer his Majesty for it (SOLLEN SIC ES MIT SEINER KONIGLICHEN MAJESTAT\r\nZU THUN KRIEGEN). For a Court of Law doing injustice is more dangerous\r\nand pernicious than a band of thieves: against these one can protect\r\noneself; but against rogues who make use of the cloak of justice to\r\naccomplish their evil passions, against such no man can guard himself.\r\nThese are worse than the greatest knaves the world contains, and deserve\r\ndouble punishment.\r\n\r\n\"For the rest, be it also known to the various Courts of Justice, That\r\nhis Majesty has appointed a new Grand-Chancellor.\" Furst dismissed. \"Yet\r\nhis Majesty will not the less look sharply with his own eyes after the\r\nLaw-proceedings in all the Provinces; and he commands you\"--that is,\r\nall the Law-courts--\"urgently herewith: FIRSTLY,\"--which is also\r\nlastly,--\"To proceed to deal equally with all people seeking justice,\r\nbe it prince or peasant; for, there, all must be alike. However, if\r\nhis Majesty, at any time hereafter, come upon a fault committed in this\r\nregard, the guilty Courts can now imagine beforehand how they will\r\nbe punished with rigor, President as well as Raths, who shall have\r\ndelivered a judgment so wicked and openly opposed to justice. Which all\r\nColleges of Justice in all his Majesty's Provinces are particularly to\r\ntake notice of.\"\r\n\r\n\"MEM. By his Majesty's special command, measures are taken that this\r\nProtocol be inserted in all the Berlin Journals.\" [In _Berlin'sche\r\nNachrichten von Staats und Gelehrten Sachen,_ No. 149, \"Tuesday, 14th\r\nDecember, 1779.\" Preuss, iii. 494.]\r\n\r\nThe remainder of Rannsleben's Narrative is beautifully brief and\r\nsignificant.--\"We had hardly left the room,\" said he SUPRA, \"when\r\nthe King followed us,\" lame as he was, with a fulminant \"Wait there!\"\r\nRannsleben continues: \"Shortly after came an Aide-de-Camp, who took\r\nus in a carriage to the common Town-prison, the Kalandshof; here two\r\nCorporals and two Privates were set to guard us. On the 13th December,\r\n1779,\" third day of our arrest, \"a Cabinet-Order was published to us,\r\nby which the King had appointed a Commission of Inquiry; but had, at\r\nthe same time, commanded beforehand that the Sentence should not be\r\nless than a year's confinement in a fortress, dismissal from office,\r\nand payment of compensation to the Arnold people for the losses they had\r\nsustained.\" Which certainly was a bad outlook for us.\r\n\r\nPrecisely the same has befallen our Brethren of Custrin; all suddenly\r\npacked into Prison, just while reading our Approval of them;--there\r\nthey sit, their Sentence to be like ours. \"Our arrest in the Kalandshof\r\nlasted from 11th December, 1779, till 5th January, 1780,\" three weeks\r\nand three days,--when (with Two Exceptions, to be noted presently) we\r\nwere all, Kammergerichters and Custriners alike, transferred to Spandau.\r\n\r\nI spoke of what might be called a ghost of Kanzler Furst once revisiting\r\nthe glimpses of the Moon, or Sun if there were any in the dismal\r\nDecember days. This is it, witness one who saw it: \"On the morning\r\nof December 12th, the day after the Grand-Chancellor's dismissal, the\r\nStreet in which he lived was thronged with the carriages of callers,\r\nwho came to testify their sympathy, and to offer their condolence to the\r\nfallen Chancellor. The crowd of carriages could be seen from the windows\r\nof the King's Palace.\" The same young Legal Gentleman, by and by a very\r\nold one, who, himself one of the callers at the Ex-Chancellor's house\r\nthat day, saw this, and related it in his old age to Herr Preuss,\r\n[Preuss, iii. 499, 500.] remembers and relates also this other\r\nsignificant fact:--\r\n\r\n\"During the days that followed\" the above event and Publication of the\r\nRoyal Protocol, \"I often crossed, in the forenoon, the Esplanade in\r\nfront of the Palace (SCHLOSSPLATZ), at that side where the King's\r\napartments were; the same which his Royal Highness the Crown-Prince now\r\n[1833] occupies. I remember that here, on that part of the Esplanade\r\nwhich was directly under Friedrich's windows, there stood constantly\r\nnumbers of Peasants, not ten or twelve, but as many as a hundred at\r\na time; all with Petitions in their hands, which they were holding up\r\ntowards the window; shouting, 'Please his Majesty to look at these;\r\nwe have been still worse treated than the Arnolds!' And indeed, I have\r\nunderstood the Law-Courts, for some time after, found great difficulty\r\nto assert their authority: the parties against whom judgment went,\r\ntaking refuge in the Arnold precedent, and appealing direct to the\r\nKing.\"\r\n\r\nFar graver than this Spectre of Furst, Minister Zedlitz hesitates,\r\nfinally refuses, to pronounce such a Sentence as the King orders on\r\nthese men of Law! Estimable, able, conscientious Zedlitz; zealous on\r\nEducation matters, too;--whom I always like for contriving to attend a\r\nCourse of Kant's Lectures, while 500 miles away from him (actual\r\nCourse in Konigsberg University, by the illustrious Kant; every Lecture\r\npunctually taken in short-hand, and transmitted to Berlin, post after\r\npost, for the busy man). [Kuno Fischer, _Kant's Leben_ (Mannheim, 1860),\r\npp. 34, 35.] Here is now some painful Correspondence between the King\r\nand him,--painful, yet pleasant:--\r\n\r\nKING TO MINISTER VON ZEDLITZ, WHO HAS ALARMING DOUBTS (Berlin, 28th\r\nDecember, 1779).--\"Your Report of the 20th instant in regard to Judgment\r\non the arrested Raths has been received. But do you think I don't\r\nunderstand your Advocate fellows and their quirks; or how they can\r\npolish up a bad cause, and by their hyperboles exaggerate or extenuate\r\nas they find fit? The Goose-quill class (FEDERZEUG) can't look at facts.\r\nWhen Soldiers set to investigate anything, on an order given, they go\r\nthe straight way to the kernel of the matter; upon which, plenty of\r\nobjections from the Goose-quill people!--But you may assure yourself\r\nI give more belief to an honest Officer, who has honor in the heart of\r\nhim, than to all your Advocates and sentences. I perceive well they are\r\nthemselves afraid, and don't want to see any of their fellows punished.\r\n\"If, therefore, you will not obey my Order, I shall take another in your\r\nplace who will; for depart from it I will not. You may tell them that.\r\nAnd know, for your part, that such miserable jargon (MISERABEL STYL)\r\nmakes not the smallest impression on me. Hereby, then, you are to guide\r\nyourself; and merely say whether you will follow my Order or not; for\r\nI will in no wise fall away from it. I am your well-affectioned\r\nKing,--FRIEDRICH.\"\r\n\r\nMARGINALE (in Autograph).--\"My Gentleman [you, Herr von Zedlitz, with\r\nyour dubitatings] won't make me believe black is white. I know the\r\nAdvocate sleight-of-hand, and won't be taken in. An example has become\r\nnecessary here,--those Scoundrels (CANAILLEN) having so enormously\r\nmisused my name, to practise arbitrary and unheard-of injustices. A\r\nJudge that goes upon chicaning is to be punished more severely than a\r\nhighway Robber. For you have trusted to the one; you are on your guard\r\nagainst the other.\"\r\n\r\nZEDLITZ TO THE KING (Berlin, 31st December, 1779).--\"I have at all times\r\nhad your Royal Majesty's favor before my eyes as the supreme happiness\r\nof my life, and have most zealously endeavored to merit the same: but I\r\nshould recognize myself unworthy of it, were I capable of an undertaking\r\ncontrary to my conviction. From the reasons indicated by myself, as\r\nwell as by the Criminal-Senate [Paper of reasons fortunately lost],\r\nyour Majesty will deign to consider that I am unable to draw up a\r\ncondemnatory Sentence against your Majesty's Servants-of-Justice now\r\nunder arrest on account of the Arnold Affair. Your Majesty's till\r\ndeath,--VON ZEDLITZ.\"\r\n\r\nKING TO ZEDLITZ (Berlin, 1st January, 1780).--\"My dear State's-Minister\r\nFreiherr von Zedlitz,--It much surprises me to see, from your Note\r\nof yesterday, that you refuse to pronounce a judgment on those\r\nServants-of-Justice arrested for their conduct in the Arnold Case,\r\naccording to my Order. If you, therefore, will not, I will; and do it as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\"1. The Custrin Regierungs-Rath Scheibler, who, it appears in evidence,\r\nwas of an opposite opinion to his Colleagues, and voted That the man\r\nup-stream had not a right to cut off the water from the man down-stream;\r\nand that the point, as to Arnold's wanting water, should be more closely\r\nand strictly inquired into,--he, Scheibler, shall be set free from\r\nhis arrest, and go back to his post at Custrin. And in like manner,\r\nKammergerichts-Rath Rannsleben--who has evidently given himself faithful\r\ntrouble about the cause, and has brought forward with a quite visible\r\nimpartiality all the considerations and dubieties, especially about\r\nthe condition of the water and the alleged hurtfulness of the Pond--is\r\nabsolved from arrest.\r\n\r\n\"2. As for the other arrested Servants-of-Justice, they are one and\r\nall dismissed from office (CASSIRT), and condemned to one year's\r\nFortress-Arrest. Furthermore, they shall pay to Arnold the value of his\r\nMill, and make good to him, out of their own pocket, all the loss\r\nand damage he has suffered in this business; the Neumark KAMMER\r\n(Revenue-Board) to tax and estimate the same. [Damage came to 1,358\r\nthalers, 11 groschen, 1 pfennig,--that is, 203 pounds 14s. and some\r\npence and farthings; the last farthing of which was punctually paid to\r\nArnold, within the next eight months;] [Preuss, iii. 409.]--so that\r\n\r\n\"3. The Miller Arnold shall be completely put as he was (IN INTEGRUM\r\nRESTITUIRT).\r\n\r\n\"And in such way must the matter, in all branches of it, be immediately\r\nproceeded with, got ready, and handed in for my Completion (VOLLZIEHUNG)\r\nby Signature. Which you, therefore, will take charge of, without delay.\r\nFor the rest, I will tell you farther, that I am not ill pleased to know\r\nyou on the side you show on this occasion [as a man that will not go\r\nagainst his conscience], and shall see, by and by, what I can farther do\r\nwith you. [Left him where he was, as the best thing.] Whereafter you\r\nare accordingly to guide yourself. And I remain otherwise your\r\nwell-affectioned King, FRIEDRICH.\" [Ib. iii. 519, 520; see ib. 405 n.]\r\n\r\nThis, then, is an impartial account of the celebrated passage between\r\nFriedrich and the Lawyers known by the name of \"the MILLER-ARNOLD CASE;\"\r\nwhich attracted the notice of all Europe,--just while the decennium of\r\nthe French Revolution was beginning. In Russia, the Czarina Catharine,\r\nthe friend of Philosophers, sent to her Senate a copy of Friedrich's\r\nPROTOCOL OF DECEMBER 11th, as a noteworthy instance of Royal supreme\r\njudicature. In France, Prints in celebration of it,--\"one Print\r\nby Vangelisti, entitled BALANCE DE FREDERIC,\"--were exhibited\r\nin shop-windows, expounded in newspapers, and discoursed of in\r\ndrawing-rooms. The Case brought into talk again an old Miller Case\r\nof Friedrich's, which had been famous above thirty years ago, when\r\nSans-Souci was getting built. Readers know it: Potsdam Miller, and his\r\nobstinate Windmill, which still grinds on its knoll in those localities,\r\nand would not, at any price, become part of the King's Gardens. \"Not at\r\nany price?\" said the King's agent: \"Cannot the King take it from you\r\nfor nothing, if he chose?\" \"Have n't we the Kammergericht at Berlin!\"\r\nanswered the Miller. To Friedrich's great delight, as appears;--which\r\nmight render the Windmill itself a kind of ornament to his Gardens\r\nthenceforth. The French admiration over these two Miller Cases continued\r\nto be very great. [Dieulafoi, LE MEUNIER DE SANS-SOUCI (Comedy or farce,\r\nof I know not what year); Andrieux, LE MOULIN DE SANS-SOUCI (\"Poem,\" at\r\nINSTITUT NATIONAL 15 GERMINAL, AN 5), &c. &c.: Preuss, iii. 412, 413.]\r\n\r\nAs to Miller Arnold and his Cause, the united voice of Prussian Society\r\ncondemned Friedrich's procedure: Such harshness to Grand-Chancellor\r\nFurst and respectable old Official Gentlemen, amounting to the barbarous\r\nand tyrannous, according to Prussian Society. To support which feeling,\r\nand testify it openly, they drove in crowds to Furst's (some have told\r\nme to the Prison-doors too, but that seems hypothetic); and left cards\r\nfor old Furst and Company. In sight of Friedrich, who inquired, \"What is\r\nthis stir on the streets, then?\"--and, on learning, made not the least\r\naudible remark; but continued his salutary cashierment of the wigged\r\nGentlemen, and imprisonment till their full term ran.\r\n\r\nMy impression has been that, in Berlin Society, there was more\r\nsympathy for mere respectability of wig than in Friedrich. To Friedrich\r\nrespectability of wig that issues in solemnly failing to do justice,\r\nis a mere enormity, greater than the most wigless condition could be.\r\nWigless, the thing were to be endured, a thing one is born to, more or\r\nless: but in wig,--out upon it! And the wig which screens, and would\r\nstrive to disguise and even to embellish such a thing: To the gutters\r\nwith such wig!\r\n\r\nIn support of their feeling for Furst and Company, Berlin Society was\r\nfarther obliged to pronounce the claim of Miller Arnold a nullity, and\r\nthat no injustice whatever had been done him. Mere pretences on his\r\npart, subterfuges for his idle conduct, for his inability to pay due\r\nrent, said Berlin Society. And that impartial Soldier-person, whom\r\nFriedrich sent to examine by the light of nature, and report? \"Corrupted\r\nhe!\" answer they: \"had intrigues with--\" I forget whom; somebody of the\r\nwomankind (perhaps Arnold's old hard-featured Wife, if you are driven\r\ninto a corner!)--\"and was not to be depended on at all!\" In which\r\ncondemned state, Berlin Society almost wholly disapproving it, the\r\nArnold Process was found at Friedrich's death (restoration of honors to\r\nold Furst and Company, one of the first acts of the New Reign, sure of\r\nimmediate popularity); and, I think, pretty much continues so still, few\r\nor none in Berlin Society admitting Miller Arnold's claim to redress,\r\nmuch less defending that onslaught on Furst and the wigs. [Herr Preuss\r\nhimself inclines that way, rather condemnatory of Friedrich; but\r\nhis Account, as usual, is exact and authentic,--though distressingly\r\nconfused, and scattered about into different corners (Preuss, iii.\r\n381-413; then again, ibid. 520 &c.). On the other hand, there is one\r\nSegebusch, too, a learned Doctor, of Altona, who takes the King's\r\nside,--and really is rather stupid, argumentative merely, and\r\nunilluminative, if you read him: Segebusch, _Historischrechtliche\r\nWurdigung der Einmischung Friedrich's des Grossen in die bekannte\r\nRechtssache des Mullers Arnold, auch fur Nicht-Juristen_ (Altona,\r\n1829).]\r\n\r\nWho, from the remote distance, would venture to contradict? Once more,\r\nmy own poor impression was, which I keep silent except to friends,\r\nthat Berlin Society was wrong; that Miller Arnold had of a truth lost\r\nportions of his dam-water, and was entitled to abatement; and that\r\nin such case, Friedrich's horror at the Furst-and-Company Phenomenon\r\n(horror aggravated by gout) had its highly respectable side withal.\r\n\r\nWhen, after Friedrich's death, on Von Gersdorf's urgent reclamations,\r\nthe case was reopened, and allowed to be carried \"into the Secret\r\nTribunal, as the competent Court of Appeal in third instance,\" the said\r\nTribunal found, That the law-maxim depended upon by the Lower Courts, as\r\nto \"the absolute right of owners of private streams,\" did NOT apply\r\nin the present case; but that the Deed of 1566 did; and also that \"the\r\nfacts as to pretended damage [PRETENCE merely] from loss of water, were\r\nsatisfactorily proved against Arnold:\" Gersdorf, therefore, may have his\r\nPond; and Arnold must refund the money paid to him for \"damages\" by the\r\ncondemned Judges; and also the purchase-money of his Mill, if he means\r\nto keep the latter. All which moneys, however, his Majesty Friedrich\r\nWilhelm II., Friedrich's Successor, to have done with the matter,\r\nhandsomely paid out of his own pocket: the handsome way of ending it.\r\n\r\nIn his last journey to West-Preussen, June, 1784, Friedrich said to the\r\nnew Regierungs-President (Chief Judge) there: \"I am Head Commissary of\r\nJustice; and have a heavy responsibility lying on me,\"--as will you\r\nin this new Office. Friedrich at no moment neglected this part of his\r\nfunctions; and his procedure in it throughout, one cannot but admit\r\nto have been faithful, beautiful, human. Very impatient indeed when he\r\ncomes upon Imbecility and Pedantry threatening to extinguish Essence\r\nand Fact, among his Law People! This is one MARGINALE of his, among many\r\nsuch, some of them still more stinging, which are comfortable to every\r\nreader. The Case is that of a murderer,--murder indisputable; \"but may\r\nnot insanity be suspected, your Majesty, such the absence of motive,\r\nsuch the--?\" Majesty answers: \"That is nothing but inanity and stupid\r\npleading against right. The fellow put a child to death; if he were a\r\nsoldier, you would execute him without priest; and because this CANAILLE\r\nis a citizen, you make him 'melancholic' to get him off. Beautiful\r\njustice!\" [Preuss, iii. 375.]\r\n\r\nFriedrich has to sign all Death-Sentences; and he does it, wherever I\r\nhave noticed, rigorously well. For the rest, his Criminal Calendar\r\nseems to be lighter than any other of his time; \"in a population of\r\n5,200,000,\" says he once, \"14 to 15 are annually condemned to death.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII.--THE FURSTENBUND: FRIEDRICH'S LAST YEARS.\r\n\r\nAt Vienna, on November 29th, 1780, the noble Kaiserinn Maria Theresa,\r\nafter a short illness, died. Her end was beautiful and exemplary, as\r\nher course had been. The disease, which seemed at first only a bad\r\ncold, proved to have been induration of the lungs; the chief symptom\r\nthroughout, a more and more suffocating difficulty to breathe. On the\r\nedge of death, the Kaiserinn, sitting in a chair (bed impossible in such\r\nstruggle for breath), leant her head back as if inclined to sleep.\r\nOne of her women arranged the cushions, asked in a whisper, \"Will your\r\nMajesty sleep, then?\" \"No,\" answered the dying Kaiserinn; \"I could\r\nsleep, but I must not; Death is too near. He must not steal upon me.\r\nThese fifteen years I have been making ready for him; I will meet him\r\nawake.\" Fifteen years ago her beloved Franz was snatched from her, in\r\nsuch sudden manner: and ever since, she has gone in Widow's dress; and\r\nhas looked upon herself as one who had done with the world. The 18th\r\nof every month has been for her a day of solitary prayer; 18th of every\r\nAugust (Franz's death-day) she has gone down punctually to the vaults\r\nin the Stephans-Kirche, and sat by his coffin there;--last August,\r\nsomething broke in the apparatus as she descended; and it has ever since\r\nbeen an omen to her. [Hormayr, _OEsterreichischer Plutarch,_ iv. (2tes)\r\n94; Keith, ii. 114.] Omen now fulfilled.\r\n\r\nOn her death, Joseph and Kaunitz, now become supreme, launched abroad\r\nin their ambitious adventures with loose rein. Schemes of all kinds;\r\nincluding Bavaria still, in spite of the late check; for which latter,\r\nand for vast prospects in Turkey as well, the young Kaiser is now upon\r\na cunning method, full of promise to him,--that of ingratiating himself\r\nwith the Czarina, and cutting out Friedrich in that quarter. Summer,\r\n1780, while the Kaiserinn still lived, Joseph made his famous First\r\nVisit to the Czarina (May-August, 1780), [Hermann, vi. 132-135.]--not\r\nyet for some years his thrice-famous Second Visit (thrice-famous\r\nCleopatra-voyage with her down the Dnieper; dramaturgic cities and\r\npopulations keeping pace with them on the banks, such the scenic faculty\r\nof Russian Officials, with Potemkin as stage-manager):--in the course\r\nof which First Visit, still more in the Second, it is well known the\r\nCzarina and Joseph came to an understanding. Little articulated of it as\r\nyet; but the meaning already clear to both. \"A frank partnership, high\r\nMadam: to you, full scope in your glorious notion of a Greek Capital and\r\nEmpire, Turk quite trampled away, Constantinople a Christian metropolis\r\nonce more [and your next Grandson a CONSTANTINE,--to be in readiness]:\r\nwhy not, if I may share too, in the Donau Countries, that lie handy? To\r\nyou, I say, an Eastern Empire; to me, a Western: Revival of the poor\r\nold Romish Reich, so far as may be; and no hindrance upon Bavaria,\r\nnext time. Have not we had enough of that old Friedrich, who stands\r\nperpetually upon STATUS QUO, and to both of us is a mere stoppage of the\r\nway?\"\r\n\r\nCzarina Catharine took the hint; christened her next Grandson\r\n\"Constantine\" (to be in readiness); [This is the Constantine who\r\nrenounced, in favor of the late Czar Nicholas; and proved a failure in\r\nregard to \"New Greek Empire,\" and otherwise.] and from that time stiffly\r\nrefused renewing her Treaty with Friedrich;--to Friedrich's great grief,\r\nseeing her, on the contrary, industrious to forward every German scheme\r\nof Joseph's, Bavarian or other, and foreshadowing to himself dismal\r\nissues for Prussia when this present term of Treaty should expire. As to\r\nJoseph, he was busy night and day,--really perilous to Friedrich and\r\nthe independence of the German Reich. His young Brother, Maximilian, he\r\ncontrives, Czarina helping, to get elected Co-adjutor of Koln; Successor\r\nof our Lanky Friend there, to be Kur-Koln in due season, and make the\r\nElectorate of Koln a bit of Austria henceforth. [Lengthy and minute\r\naccount of that Transaction, in all the steps of it, in DOHM, i.\r\n295-39.] Then there came \"PANIS-BRIEFE,\" [PANIS (Bread) BRIEF is a\r\nLetter with which, in ancient centuries, the Kaiser used to furnish an\r\nold worn-out Servant, addressed to some Monastery, some Abbot or Prior\r\nin easy circumstances: \"Be so good as provide this old Gentleman with\r\nPanis (Bread, or Board and Lodging) while he lives.\" Very pretty in\r\nBarbarossa's time;--but now--!]--who knows what?--usurpations, graspings\r\nand pretensions without end:--finally, an open pretension to incorporate\r\nBavaria, after all. Bavaria, not in part now, but in whole: \"You, Karl\r\nTheodor, injured man, cannot we give you Territory in the Netherlands;\r\na King there you shall be, and have your vote as Kur-Pfalz still; only\r\nthink! In return for which, Bavaria ours in fee-simple, and so finish\r\nthat?\" Karl Theodor is perfectly willing,--only perhaps some others are\r\nnot. Then and there, these threatening complexities, now gone like a\r\ndream of the night, were really life-perils for the Kingdom of Prussia;\r\nnever to be lost sight of by a veteran Shepherd of the People. They\r\nkept a vigilant King Friedrich continually on the stretch, and were\r\na standing life-problem to him in those final Years. Problem nearly\r\ninsoluble to human contrivance; the Russian card having palpably\r\ngone into the other hand. Problem solved, nevertheless; it is still\r\nremembered how.\r\n\r\nOn the development of that pretty Bavarian Project, the thing became\r\npressing; and it is well known by what a stroke of genius Friedrich\r\ncheckmated it; and produced instead a \"FURSTENBUND,\" or general\r\n\"Confederation of German Princes,\" Prussia atop, to forbid peremptorily\r\nthat the Laws of the Reich be infringed. FURSTENBUND: this is the\r\nvictorious summit of Friedrich's Public History, towards which all his\r\nefforts tended, during these five years: Friedrich's last feat in the\r\nworld. Feat, how obsolete now,--fallen silent everywhere, except in\r\nGerman Parish-History, and to the students of Friedrich's character in\r\nold age! Had no result whatever in European History; so unexpected was\r\nthe turn things took. A FURSTENBUND which was swallowed bodily within\r\nfew years, in that World-Explosion of Democracy, and War of the Giants;\r\nand--unless Napoleon's \"Confederation of the Rhine\" were perhaps some\r\ntransitory ghost of it?--left not even a ghost behind. A FURSTENBUND\r\nof which we must say something, when its Year comes; but obviously not\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nNor are the Domesticities, as set forth by our Prussian authorities,\r\nan opulent topic for us. Friedrich's Old Age is not unamiable; on the\r\ncontrary, I think it would have made a pretty Picture, had there been\r\na Limner to take it, with the least felicity or physiognomic\r\ncoherency;--as there was not. His Letters, and all the symptoms we have,\r\ndenote a sound-hearted brave old man; continually subduing to himself\r\nmany ugly troubles; and, like the stars, always steady at his work. To\r\nsit grieving or desponding is, at all times, far from him: \"Why despond?\r\nWon't it be all done presently; is it of much moment while it lasts?\" A\r\nfine, unaffectedly vigorous, simple and manful old age;--rather serene\r\nthan otherwise; in spite of electric outbursts and cloudy weather that\r\ncould not be wanting.\r\n\r\nOf all which there is not, in this place, much more to be said.\r\nFriedrich's element is itself wearing dim, sombre of hue; and the\r\nrecords of it, too, seem to grow dimmer, more and more intermittent. Old\r\nfriends, of the intellectual kind, are almost all dead; the new are\r\nof little moment to us,--not worth naming in comparison, The chief,\r\nperhaps, is a certain young Marchese Lucchesini, who comes about this\r\ntime, [\"Chamberlain [titular, with Pension, &c.], 9th May, 1780, age\r\nthen 28\" (Preuss, iv. 211);-arrived when or how is not said.]\r\nand continues in more and more favor both with Friedrich and his\r\nSuccessor,--employed even in Diplomatics by the latter. An accomplished\r\nyoung Gentleman, from Lucca; of fine intelligence, and, what was no less\r\nessential to him here, a perfect propriety in breeding and carriage. One\r\nmakes no acquaintance with him in these straggling records, nor desires\r\nto make any. It was he that brought the inane, ever scribbling\r\nDenina hither, if that can be reckoned a merit. Inane Denina came as\r\nAcademician, October, 1782; saw Friedrich, [Rodenbeck, iii. 285, 286.]\r\nat least once (\"Academician, Pension; yes, yes!\")--and I know not\r\nwhether any second time.\r\n\r\nFriedrich, on loss of friends, does not take refuge in solitude;\r\nhe tries always for something of substitute; sees his man once or\r\ntwice,--in several instances once only, and leaves him to his pension in\r\nsinecure thenceforth. Cornelius de Pauw, the rich Canon of Xanten\r\n(Uncle of Anacharsis Klootz, the afterwards renowned), came on those\r\nprinciples; hung on for six months, not liked, not liking; and was\r\nthen permitted to go home for good, his pension with him. Another,\r\na Frenchman, whose name I forget, sat gloomily in Potsdam, after his\r\nrejection; silent (not knowing German), unclipt, unkempt, rough as\r\nNebuchadnezzar, till he died. De Catt is still a resource; steady till\r\nalmost the end, when somebody's tongue, it is thought, did him ill with\r\nthe King.\r\n\r\nAlone, or almost alone, of the ancient set is Bastiani; a tall,\r\nblack-browed man, with uncommonly bright eyes, now himself old, and a\r\ncomfortable Abbot in Silesia; who comes from time to time, awakening\r\nthe King into his pristine topics and altitudes. Bastiani's history is\r\nsomething curious: as a tall Venetian Monk (son of a tailor in Venice),\r\nhe had been crimped by Friedrich Wilhelm's people; Friedrich found him\r\nserving as a Potsdam Giant, but discerned far other faculties in the\r\nbright-looking man, far other knowledges; and gradually made him what\r\nwe see. Banters him sometimes that he will rise to be Pope one day, so\r\ncunning and clever is he: \"What will you say to me, a Heretic, when you\r\nget to be Pope; tell me now; out with it, I insist!\" Bastiani parried,\r\npleaded, but unable to get off, made what some call his one piece of\r\nwit: \"I will say: O Royal Eagle, screen me with thy wings, but spare me\r\nwith thy sharp beak!\" This is Bastiani's one recorded piece of wit; for\r\nhe was tacit rather, and practically watchful, and did not waste his\r\nfine intellect in that way.\r\n\r\nForeign Visitors there are in plenty; now and then something brilliant\r\ngoing. But the old Generals seem to be mainly what the King has for\r\ncompany. Dinner always his bright hour; from ten to seven guests daily.\r\nSeidlitz, never of intelligence on any point but Soldiering, is long\r\nsince dead; Ziethen comes rarely, and falls asleep when he does; General\r\nGortz (brother of the Weimar-Munchen Gortz); Buddenbrock (the King's\r\ncomrade in youth, in the Reinsberg times), who has good faculty;\r\nPrittwitz (who saved him at Kunersdorf, and is lively, though stupid);\r\nGeneral and Head-Equerry Schwerin, of headlong tongue, not witty, but\r\nthe cause of wit; Major Graf von Pinto, a magniloquent Ex-Austrian ditto\r\nditto: these are among his chief dinner-guests. If fine speculation\r\ndo not suit, old pranks of youth, old tales of war, become the staple\r\nconversation; always plenty of banter on the old King's part;--who\r\nsits very snuffy (says the privately ill-humored Busching) and does not\r\nsufficiently abhor grease on his fingers, or keep his nails quite clean.\r\nOccasionally laughs at the Clergy, too; and has little of the reverence\r\nseemly in an old King. The truth is, Doctor, he has had his sufferings\r\nfrom Human Stupidity; and was always fond of hitting objects on the raw.\r\nFor the rest, as you may see, heartily an old Stoic, and takes matters\r\nin the rough; avoiding useless despondency above all; and intent to have\r\na cheerful hour at dinner if he can.\r\n\r\nVisits from his Kindred are still pretty frequent; never except on\r\ninvitation. For the rest, completely an old Bachelor, an old Military\r\nAbbot; with business for every hour. Princess Amelia takes care of\r\nhis linen, not very well, the dear old Lady, who is herself a cripple,\r\nsuffering, and voiceless, speaking only in hoarse whisper. I think I\r\nhave heard there were but twelve shirts, not in first-rate order,\r\nwhen the King died. A King supremely indifferent to small concerns;\r\nespecially to that of shirts and tailorages not essential. Holds to\r\nLiterature, almost more than ever; occasionally still writes; [For one\r\ninstance: The famous Pamphlet, DE LA LITTERATURE ALLEMANDE (containing\r\nhis onslaught on Shakspeare, and his first salutation, with the reverse\r\nof welcome, to Goethe's GOTZ VON BERLICHINGEN);--printed, under stupid\r\nThiebault's care, Berlin, 1780. Stands now in _OEuvres de Frederic,_\r\nvii. 89-122. The last Pieces of all are chiefly MILITARY INSTRUCTIONS\r\nof a practical or official nature.] has his daily Readings, Concerts,\r\nCorrespondences as usual:--readers can conceive the dim Household\r\nPicture, dimly reported withal. The following Anecdotes may be added as\r\ncompletion of it, or at least of all I have to say on it:--\r\n\r\nYOU GO ON WEDNESDAY, THEN?--\"Loss of time was one of the losses\r\nFriedrich could least stand. In visits even from his Brothers and\r\nSisters, which were always by his own express invitation, he would say\r\nsome morning (call it Tuesday morning): 'You are going on Wednesday, I\r\nam sorry to hear' (what YOU never heard before)!--'Alas, your Majesty,\r\nwe must!' 'Well, I am sorry: but I will lay no constraint on you.\r\nPleasant moments cannot last forever!' And sometimes, after this had\r\nbeen agreed to; he would say: 'But cannot you stay till Thursday, then?\r\nCome, one other day of it!'--'Well, since your Majesty does graciously\r\npress!' And on Thursday, not Wednesday, on those curious terms, the\r\nvisit would terminate. This trait is in the Anecdote-Books: but its\r\nauthenticity does not rest on that uncertain basis; singularly enough,\r\nit comes to me, individually, by two clear stages, from Friedrich's\r\nSister the Duchess of Brunswick, who, if anybody, would know it well!\"\r\n[My informant is Sir George Sinclair, Baronet, of Thurso; his was the\r\ndistinguished Countess of Finlater, still remembered for her graces of\r\nmind and person, who had been Maid-of-Honor to the Duchess.]\r\n\r\nDINNER WITH THE QUEEN.--The Queen, a prudent, simple-minded, worthy\r\nperson, of perfect behavior in a difficult position, seems to have been\r\nmuch respected in Berlin Society and the Court Circles. Nor was the King\r\nwanting in the same feeling towards her; of which there are still\r\nmany proofs: but as to personal intercourse,--what a figure has that\r\ngradually taken! Preuss says, citing those who saw: \"When the King,\r\nafter the Seven-Years War, now and then, in Carnival season, dined\r\nwith the Queen in her Apartments, he usually said not a word to her. He\r\nmerely, on entering, on sitting down at table and on leaving it, made\r\nthe customary bow; and sat opposite to her. Once, in the Seventies\r\n[years 1770, years now past], the Queen was ill of gout; table was in\r\nher Apartments; but she herself was not there, she sat in an easy-chair\r\nin the drawing-room. On this occasion the King stepped up to the Queen,\r\nand inquired about her health. The circumstance occasioned, among the\r\ncompany present, and all over Town as the news spread, great wonder and\r\nsympathy (VERWUNDERUNG UND THEILNAHME). This is probably the last time\r\nhe ever spoke to her.\" [Preuss, iv. 187.]\r\n\r\nTHE TWO GRAND-NEPHEWS.--\"The King was fond of children; liked to have\r\nhis Grand-Nephews about him. One day, while the King sat at work in his\r\nCabinet, the younger of the two, a boy of eight or nine [who died soon\r\nafter twenty], was playing ball about the room; and knocked it once and\r\nagain into the King's writing operation; who twice or oftener flung it\r\nback to him, but next time put it in his pocket, and went on. 'Please\r\nyour Majesty, give it me back!' begged the Boy; and again begged:\r\nMajesty took no notice; continued writing. Till at length came, in the\r\ntone of indignation, 'Will your Majesty give me my ball, then?' The\r\nKing looked up; found the little Hohenzollern planted firm, hands on\r\nhaunches, and wearing quite a peremptory air. 'Thou art a brave little\r\nfellow; they won't get Silesia out of thee!' cried he laughing, and\r\nflinging him his ball.\" [Fischer, ii. 445 (\"year 1780\").]\r\n\r\nOf the elder Prince, afterwards Friedrich Wilhelm III. (Father of the\r\nnow King), there is a much more interesting Anecdote, and of his own\r\nreporting too, though the precise terms are irrecoverable: \"How the\r\nKing, questioning him about his bits of French studies, brought down a\r\nLA FONTAINE from the shelves, and said, 'Translate me this Fable;' which\r\nthe Boy did, with such readiness and correctness as obtained the King's\r\npraises: praises to an extent that was embarrassing, and made the honest\r\nlittle creature confess, 'I did it with my Tutor, a few days since!' To\r\nthe King's much greater delight; who led him out to walk in the Gardens,\r\nand, in a mood of deeper and deeper seriousness, discoursed and exhorted\r\nhim on the supreme law of truth and probity that lies on all men, and on\r\nall Kings still more; one of his expressions being, 'Look at this high\r\nthing [the Obelisk they were passing in the Gardens], its UPRIGHTness\r\nis its strength (SA DROITURE FAIT SA FORCE);' and his final words,\r\n'Remember this evening, my good Fritz; perhaps thou wilt think of it,\r\nlong after, when I am gone.' As the good Friedrich Wilhelm III. declares\r\npiously he often did, in the storms of fate that overtook him.\" [R.\r\nF. Eylert, _Charakterzuge und historische Fragmente aus dem Leben\r\ndes Konigs von Preussen Friedrich Wilhelm III._ (Magdeburg, 1843), i.\r\n450-456. This is a \"King's Chaplain and Bishop Eylert:\" undoubtedly he\r\nheard this Anecdote from his Master, and was heard repeating it; but the\r\ndialect his Editors have put it into is altogether tawdry, modern,\r\nand impossible to take for that of Friedrich, or even, I suppose, of\r\nFriedrich Wilhelm III.]\r\n\r\nIndustrial matters, that of Colonies especially, of drainages,\r\nembankments, and reclaiming of waste lands, are a large item in the\r\nKing's business,--readers would not guess how large, or how incessant.\r\nUnder this head there is on record, and even lies at my hand translated\r\ninto English, what might be called a Colonial DAY WITH FRIEDRICH (Day of\r\nJuly 23d, 1779; which Friedrich, just come home from the Bavarian War,\r\nspent wholly, from 5 in the morning onward, in driving about, in earnest\r\nsurvey of his Colonies and Land-Improvements in the Potsdam-Ruppin\r\nCountry); curious enough Record, by a certain Bailiff or Overseer, who\r\nrode at his chariotside, of all the questions, criticisms and remarks\r\nof Friedrich on persons and objects, till he landed at Ruppin for the\r\nnight. Taken down, with forensic, almost with religious exactitude, by\r\nthe Bailiff in question; a Nephew of the Poet Gleim,--by whom it was\r\npublished, the year after Friedrich's death; [Is in _Anekdoten und\r\nKarakterzuge,_ No. 8 (Berlin, 1787), pp. 15-79.] and by many others\r\nsince. It is curiously authentic, characteristic in parts, though in\r\nits bald forensic style rather heavy reading. Luckier, for most readers,\r\nthat inexorable want of room has excluded it, on the present occasion!\r\n[Printed now (in Edition 1868, for the first time), as APPENDIX to this\r\nVolume.]\r\n\r\nNo reader adequately fancies, or could by any single Document be made to\r\ndo so, the continual assiduity of Friedrich in regard to these interests\r\nof his. The strictest Husbandman is not busier with his Farm, than\r\nFriedrich with his Kingdom throughout;--which is indeed a FARM leased\r\nhim by the Heavens; in which not a gate-bar can be broken, nor a stone\r\nor sod roll into the smallest ditch, but it is to his the Husbandman's\r\ndamage, and must be instantly looked after. There are Meetings with the\r\nSilesian manufacturers (in Review time), Dialogues ensuing, several of\r\nwhich have been preserved; strange to read, however dull. There are many\r\nscattered evidences;--and only slowly does, not the thing indeed, but\r\nthe degree of the thing, become fully credible. Not communicable, on the\r\nterms prescribed us at present; and must be left to the languid fancy,\r\nlike so much else.\r\n\r\nHere is an Ocular View, here are several such, which we yet happily\r\nhave, of the actual Friedrich as he looked and lived. These, at a cheap\r\nrate, throw transiently some flare of illumination over his Affairs and\r\nhim: these let me now give; and these shall be all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCE DE LIGNE, AFTER TEN YEARS, SEES FRIEDRICH A SECOND TIME; TIME;\r\nAND REPORTS WHAT WAS SAID.\r\n\r\nIn Summer, 1780, as we mentioned, Kaiser Joseph was on his first Visit\r\nto the Czarina. They met at Mohilow on the Dnieper, towards the end of\r\nMay; have been roving about, as if in mere galas and amusements (though\r\nwith a great deal of business incidentally thrown in), for above a month\r\nsince, when Prince de Ligne is summoned to join them at Petersburg. He\r\ngoes by Berlin, stays at Potsdam with Friedrich for about a week; and\r\nreports to Polish Majesty these new Dialogues of 1780, the year after\r\nsending him those of Mahrisch-Neustadt of 1770, which we read above.\r\nThose were written down from memory, in 1785; these in 1786,--and\r\n\"towards the end of it,\" as is internally evident. Let these also be\r\nwelcome to us on such terms as there are.\r\n\r\n\"Since your Majesty [Quasi-Majesty, of Poland] is willing to lose\r\nanother quarter of an hour of that time, which you employ so well in\r\ngaining the love of all to whom you deign to make yourself known, here\r\nis my Second Interview. It can be of interest only to you, Sire, who\r\nhave known the King, and who discover traits of character in what to\r\nanother are but simple words. One finds in few others that confidence,\r\nor at least that kindliness (BONHOMIE), which characterizes your\r\nMajesty. With you, one can indulge in rest; but with the King of\r\nPrussia, one had always to be under arms, prepared to parry and to\r\nthrust, and to keep the due middle between a small attack and a grand\r\ndefence. I proceed to the matter in hand, and shall speak to you of him\r\nfor the last time.\r\n\r\n\"He had made me promise to come to Berlin. I hastened thither directly\r\nafter that little War [Potato-War], which he called 'an action where he\r\nhad come as bailiff to perform an execution.' The result for him, as is\r\nknown, was a great expense of men, of horses and money; some appearance\r\nof good faith and disinterestedness; little honor in the War; a little\r\nhonesty in Policy, and much bitterness against us Austrians. The King\r\nbegan, without knowing why, to prohibit Austrian Officers from entering\r\nhis Territories without an express order, signed by his own hand.\r\nSimilar prohibition, on the part of our Court, against Prussian Officers\r\nand mutual constraint, without profit or reason. I, for my own part, am\r\nof confident humor; I thought I should need no permission, and I think\r\nstill I could have done without one. But the desire of having a Letter\r\nfrom the great Friedrich, rather than the fear of being ill-received,\r\nmade me write to him. My Letter was all on fire with my enthusiasm,\r\nmy admiration, and the fervor of my sentiment for that sublime and\r\nextraordinary being; and it brought me three charming Answers from him.\r\nHe gave me, in detail, almost what I had given him in the gross; and\r\nwhat he could not return me in admiration,--for I do not remember\r\nto have gained a battle,--he accorded me in friendship. For fear of\r\nmissing, he had written to me from Potsdam, to Vienna, to Dresden, and\r\nto Berlin. [In fine, at Potsdam I was, SATURDAY, 9th JULY, 1780,\r\nwaiting ready;--stayed there about a week.] [\"9th (or 10th) July, 1780\"\r\n(Rodenbeck, iii. 233): \"Stayed till 16th.\"]\r\n\r\n\"While waiting for the hour of 12, with my Son Charles and M. de Lille\r\n[Abbe de Lille, prose-writer of something now forgotten; by no means\r\nlyrical DE LISLE, of LES JARDINS], to be presented to the King, I went\r\nto look at the Parade;--and, on its breaking up, was surrounded, and\r\nescorted to the Palace, by Austrian deserters, and particularly from\r\nmy own regiment, who almost caressed me, and asked my pardon for having\r\nleft me.\r\n\r\n\"The hour of presentation struck. The King received me with an\r\nunspeakable charm. The military coldness of a General's Head-quarters\r\nchanged into a soft and kindly welcome. He said to me, 'He did not think\r\nI had so big a Son.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'He is even married, Sire; has been so these twelve months.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'May I (OSERAIS-JE) ask you to whom?' He often used this\r\nexpression, 'OSERAIS-JE;' and also this: 'If you permit me to have the\r\nhonor to tell you, SI VOUS ME PERMETTES D'AVOIR L'HONNEUR DE VOUS DIRE.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'To a Polish-Lady, a Massalska.'\r\n\r\nKING (to my Son). \"'What, a Massalska? Do you know what her Grandmother\r\ndid?'\r\n\r\n\"'No, Sire,' said Charles.\r\n\r\nKING. \"'She put the match to the cannon at the Siege of Dantzig with her\r\nown hand; [February, 1734, in poor Stanislaus Leczinski's SECOND fit of\r\nRoyalty: supra vi. 465.] she fired, and made others fire, and\r\ndefended herself, when her party, who had lost head, thought only of\r\nsurrendering.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'Women are indeed undefinable; strong and weak by turns,\r\nindiscreet, dissembling, they are capable of anything.' 'Without doubt,'\r\nsaid M. de Lille, distressed that nothing had yet been said to him,\r\nand with a familiarity which was not likely to succeed; 'Without doubt.\r\nLook--' said he. The King interrupted him. I cited some traits in\r\nsupport of my opinion,--as that of the woman Hachette at the Siege\r\nof Beauvais. [A.D. 1472; Burgundians storming the wall had their flag\r\nplanted; flag and flag-bearer are hurled into the ditch by Hachette and\r\nother inspired women,--with the finest results.] The King made a little\r\nexcursion to Rome and to Sparta: he liked to promenade there. After\r\nhalf a second of silence, to please De Lille, I told the King that M. de\r\nVoltaire died in De Lille's arms. That caused the King to address some\r\nquestions to him; he answered in rather too long-drawn a manner, and\r\nwent away. Charles and I stayed dinner.\" This is day first in Potsdam.\r\n\r\n\"Here, for five hours daily, the King's encyclopedical conversation\r\nenchanted me completely. Fine arts, war, medicine, literature and\r\nreligion, philosophy, ethics, history and legislation, in turns passed\r\nin review. The fine centuries of Augustus and of Louis XIV.; good\r\nsociety among the Romans, among the Greeks, among the French; the\r\nchivalry of Francois I.; the frankness and valor of Henri IV.; the\r\nnew-birth (RENAISSANCE) of Letters and their revolution since Leo X.;\r\nanecdotes about the clever men of other times, and the trouble they\r\ngive; M. de Voltaire's slips; susceptibilities of M. de Maupertuis;\r\nAlgarotti's agreeable ways; fine wit of Jordan; D'Argens's hypochondria,\r\nwhom the King would send to bed for four-and-twenty hours by simply\r\ntelling him that he looked ill;--and, in fine, what not? Everything, the\r\nmost varied and piquant that could be said, came from him,--in a most\r\nsoft tone of voice; rather low than otherwise, and no less agreeable\r\nthan were the movements of his lips, which had an inexpressible grace.\r\n\r\n\"It was this, I believe, which prevented one's observing that he was,\r\nin fact, like Homer's heroes, somewhat of a talker (UN PEU BABILLARD),\r\nthough a sublime one. It is to their voices, their noise and gestures,\r\nthat talkers often owe their reputation as such; for certainly one could\r\nnot find a greater talker than the King; but one was delighted at his\r\nbeing so. Accustomed to talk to Marquis Lucchesini, in the presence of\r\nonly four or five Generals who did not understand French, he compensated\r\nin this way for his hours of labor, of study, of meditation and\r\nsolitude. At least, said I to myself, I must get in a word. He had just\r\nmentioned Virgil. I said:--\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'What a great Poet, Sire; but what a bad gardener!'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'Ah, to whom do you tell that! Have not I tried to plant, sow,\r\ntill, dig, with the GEORGICS in my hand? \"But, Monsieur,\" said my man,\r\n\"you are a fool (BETE), and your Book no less; it is not in that way\r\none goes to work.\" Ah, MON DIEU, what a climate! Would you believe it,\r\nHeaven, or the Sun, refuse me everything? Look at my poor orange-trees,\r\nmy olive-trees, lemon-trees: they are all starving.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'It would appear, then, nothing but laurels flourish with\r\nyou, Sire.' (The King gave me a charming look; and to cover an inane\r\nobservation by an absurd one, I added quickly:) 'Besides, Sire, there\r\nare too many GRENADIERS [means, in French, POMEGRANATES as well as\r\nGRENADIERS,--peg of one's little joke!] in this Country; they eat up\r\neverything!' The King burst out laughing; for it is only absurdities\r\nthat cause laughter.\r\n\r\n\"One day I had turned a plate to see of what, porcelain it was. 'Where\r\ndo you think it comes from?' asked the King.\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'I thought it was Saxon; but, instead of two swords [the Saxon\r\nmark], I see only one, which is well worth both of them.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'It is a sceptre.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'I beg your Majesty's pardon; but it is so much like a sword,\r\nthat one could easily mistake it for one.' And such was really the\r\ncase. This, it, is known, is the mark of the Berlin china. As the\r\nKing sometimes PLAYED KING, and thought himself, sometimes, extremely\r\nmagnificent while taking up a walking-stick or snuffbox with a few\r\nwretched little diamonds running after one another on it, I don't quite\r\nknow whether he was infinitely pleased with my little allegory.\r\n\r\n\"One day, as I entered his room, he came towards me, saying, 'I tremble\r\nto announce bad news to you. I have just heard that Prince Karl of\r\nLorraine is dying.' [Is already dead, \"at Brussels, July 4th;\" Duke of\r\nSachsen-Teschen and Wife Christine succeeded him as Joint-Governors in\r\nthose parts.] He looked at me to see the effect this would have; and\r\nobserving some tears escaping from my eyes, he, by gentlest transitions,\r\nchanged the conversation; talked of war, and of the Marechal de Lacy.\r\nHe asked me news about Lacy; and said, 'That is a man of the greatest\r\nmerit. In former time, Count Mercy among yourselves [killed, while\r\ncommanding in chief, at the Battle of Parma in 1733], Puysegur among\r\nthe French, had some notions of marches and encampments; one sees from\r\nHyginus's Book [ancient Book] ON CASTRAMETATION, that the Greeks also\r\nwere much occupied with the subject: but your Marechal surpasses the\r\nAncients, the Moderns and all the most famous men who have meddled with\r\nit. Thus, whenever he was your Quartermaster-General, if you will\r\npermit me to make the remark to you, I did not gain the least advantage.\r\nRecollect the two Campaigns of 1758 and 1759; you succeeded in\r\neverything. I often said to myself, 'Shall I never get rid of that man,\r\nthen?' You yourselves got me rid of him; and--[some liberal or even\r\nprofuse eulogy of Lacy, who is De Ligne's friend; which we can omit].\r\n\r\n\"Next day the King, as soon as he saw me, came up; saying with the most\r\npenetrated air: 'If you are to learn the loss of a man who loved you,\r\nand who did honor to mankind, it will be better that it be from some\r\none who feels it as deeply as I do. Poor Prince Karl is no more. Others,\r\nperhaps, are made to replace him in your heart; but few Princes will\r\nreplace him with regard to the beauty of his soul and to all his\r\nvirtues.' In saying this, his emotion became extreme. I said: 'Your\r\nMajesty's regrets are a consolation; and you did not wait for his death\r\nto speak well of him. There are fine verses with reference to him in the\r\nPoem, SUR L'ART DE LA GUERRE.' My emotion troubled me against my will;\r\nhowever, I repeated them to him.\r\n\r\n    [\"Soutien de mes rivaux, digne appui de ta reine,\r\n     Charles, d'un ennemi sourd aux cris de la haine\r\n     Recois l'eloge\"...\r\n\r\n(for crossing the Rhine in 1744): ten rather noble lines, still worth\r\nreading; as indeed the whole Poem well is, especially to soldier\r\nstudents (L'ART DE LA GUERRE, Chant vi.: _OEuvres de Frederic,_ x.\r\n273).] The Man of Letters seemed to appreciate my knowing them by heart.\r\n\r\nKING. \"'His passage of the Rhine was a very fine thing;--but the poor\r\nPrince depended upon so many people! I never depended upon anybody but\r\nmyself; sometimes too much so for my luck. He was badly served, not\r\ntoo well obeyed: neither the one nor the other ever was the case with\r\nme.--Your General Nadasti appeared to me a great General of Cavalry?'\r\nNot sharing the King's opinion on this point, I contented myself with\r\nsaying, that Nadasti was very brilliant, very fine at musketry, and\r\nthat he could have led his hussars to the world's end and farther (DANS\r\nL'ENFER), so well did he know how to animate them.\r\n\r\nKING. \"'What has become of a brave Colonel who played the devil at\r\nRossbach? Ah, it was the Marquis de Voghera, I think?--Yes, that's it;\r\nfor I asked his name after the Battle.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'He is General of Cavalry.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'PERDI! It needed a considerable stomach for fight, to charge\r\nlike your Two Regiments of Cuirassiers there, and, I believe, your\r\nHussars also: for the Battle was lost before it began.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'Apropos of M. de Voghera, is your Majesty aware of a little thing\r\nhe did before charging? He is a boiling, restless, ever-eager kind of\r\nman; and has something of the good old Chivalry style. Seeing that his\r\nRegiment would not arrive quick enough, he galloped ahead of it; and\r\ncoming up to the Commander of the Prussian Regiment of Cavalry which\r\nhe meant to attack, he saluted him as on parade; the other returned the\r\nsalute; and then, Have at each other like madmen.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'A very good style it is! I should like to know that man; I would\r\nthank him for it.--Your General von Ried, then, had got the devil\r\nin him, that time at Eilenburg [spurt of fight there, in the Meissen\r\nregions, I think in Year 1758, when the D'Ahremberg Dragoons got so cut\r\nup], to let those brave Dragoons, who so long bore your Name with glory,\r\nadvance between Three of my Columns?'--He had asked me the same question\r\nat the Camp of Neustadt ten years since; and in vain had I told him that\r\nit was not M. de Ried; that Ried did not command them at all; and that\r\nthe fault was Marechal Daun's, who ought not to have sent them into that\r\nWood of Eilenburg, still less ordered them to halt there without even\r\nsending a patrol forward. The King could not bear our General von Ried,\r\nwho had much displeased him as Minister at Berlin; and it was his way to\r\nput down everything to the account of people he disliked.\r\n\r\nKING. \"'When I think of those devils of Saxon Camps [Summer,\r\n1760],--they were unattackable citadels! If, at Torgau, M. de Lacy had\r\nstill been Quartermaster-General, I should not have attempted to attack\r\nhim. But there I saw at once the Camp was ill chosen.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'The superior reputation of Camps sometimes causes a desire to\r\nattempt them. For instance, I ask your Majesty's pardon, but I have\r\nalways thought you would at last have attempted that of Plauen, had the\r\nWar continued.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'Oh, no, indeed! There was no way of taking that one.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'Does n't your Majesty think: With a good battery on the heights\r\nof Dolschen, which commanded us; with some battalions, ranked behind\r\neach other in the Ravine, attacking a quarter of an hour before daybreak\r\n[and so forth, at some length,--excellent for soldier readers who\r\nknow the Plauen Chasm], you could have flung us out of that almost\r\nimpregnable Place of Refuge?'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'And your battery on the Windberg, which would have scourged my\r\npoor battalions, all the while, in your Ravine?'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'But, Sire, the night?'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'Oh, you could not miss us even by grope. That big hollow that\r\ngoes from Burg, and even from Potschappel,--it would have poured like a\r\nwater-spout [or fire-spout] over us. You see, I am not so brave as you\r\nthink.'\r\n\r\n\"The Kaiser had set out for his Interview [First Interview, and indeed\r\nit is now more than half done, a good six weeks of it gone] with\r\nthe Czarina of Russia. That Interview the King did not like [no\r\nwonder]:--and, to undo the good it had done us, he directly, and very\r\nunskilfully, sent the Prince Royal to Petersburg [who had not the least\r\nsuccess there, loutish fellow, and was openly snubbed by a Czarina gone\r\ninto new courses]. His Majesty already doubted that the Court of Russia\r\nwas about to escape him:--and I was dying of fear lest, in the middle of\r\nall his kindnesses, he should remember that I was an Austrian. 'What,'\r\nsaid I to myself, 'not a single epigram on us, or on our Master? What a\r\nchange!'\r\n\r\n\"One day, at dinner, babbling Pinto said to the person sitting next him,\r\n'This Kaiser is a great traveller; there never was one who went so far.'\r\n'I ask your pardon, Monsieur,' said the King; 'Charles Fifth went to\r\nAfrica; he gained the Battle of Oran.' And, turning towards me,--who\r\ncouldn't guess whether it was banter or only history,--'This time,' said\r\nhe, 'the Kaiser is more fortunate than Charles Twelfth; like Charles,\r\nhe entered Russia by Mohilow; but it appears to me he will arrive at\r\nMoscow.'\r\n\r\n\"The same Pinto, one day, understanding the King was at a loss whom to\r\nsend as Foreign Minister some-whither, said to him: 'Why does not your\r\nMajesty think of sending Lucchesini, who is a man of much brilliancy\r\n(HOMME D'ESPRIT)?' 'It is for that very reason,' answered the King,\r\n'that I want to keep him. I had rather send you than him, or a dull\r\nfellow like Monsieur--' I forget whom, but believe it is one whom he did\r\nappoint Minister somewhere.\r\n\r\n\"M. de Lucchesini, by the charm of his conversation, brought out that of\r\nthe King's. He knew what topics were agreeable to the King; and then,\r\nhe knew how to listen; which is not so easy as one thinks, and which no\r\nstupid man was ever capable of. He was as agreeable to everybody as to\r\nhis Majesty, by his seductive manners and by the graces of his mind.\r\nPinto, who had nothing to risk, permitted himself everything. Says he:\r\n'Ask the Austrian General, Sire, all he saw me do when in the service of\r\nthe Kaiser.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'A fire-work at my Wedding, was n't that it, my dear Pinto?'\r\n\r\nKING (interrupting). \"'Do me the honor to say whether it was\r\nsuccessful?'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'No, Sire; it even alarmed all my relations, who thought it a bad\r\nomen. Monsieur the Major here had struck out the idea of joining Two\r\nflaming Hearts, a very novel image of a married couple. But the groove\r\nthey were to slide on, and meet, gave way: my Wife's heart went, and\r\nmine remained.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'You see, Pinto, you were not good for much to those people, any\r\nmore than to me.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'Oh, Sire, your Majesty, since then, owes him some compensation\r\nfor the sabre-cuts he had on his head.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'He gets but too much compensation. Pinto, did n't I send you\r\nyesterday some of my good Preussen honey?'\r\n\r\nPINTO. \"'Oh, surely;--it was to make the thing known. If your Majesty\r\ncould bring that into vogue, and sell it all, you would be the greatest\r\nKing in the world. For your Kingdom produces only that; but of that\r\nthere is plenty.'\r\n\r\n\"'Do you know,' said the King, one day, to me,--'Do you know that the\r\nfirst soldiering I did was for the House of Austria? MON DIEU, how the\r\ntime passes!'--He had a way of slowly bringing his hands together, in\r\nejaculating these MON-DIEUS, which gave him quite a good-natured and\r\nextremely mild air.--(Do you know that I saw the glittering of the last\r\nrays of Prince Eugen's genius?'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'Perhaps it was at these rays that your Majesty's genius lit\r\nitself.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'EH, MON DIEU! who could equal the Prince Eugen?'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'He who excels him;--for instance, he who could win Twelve\r\nBattles!'--He put on his modest air. I have always said, it is easy\r\nto be modest, if you are in funds. He seemed as though he had not\r\nunderstood me, and said:--\r\n\r\nKING. \"'When the cabal which, during forty years, the Prince had always\r\nhad to struggle with in his Army, were plotting mischief on him, they\r\nused to take advantage of the evening time, when his spirits, brisk\r\nenough in the morning, were jaded by the fatigues of the day. It was\r\nthus they persuaded him to undertake his bad March on Mainz' [March not\r\nknown to me].\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'Regarding yourself, Sire, and the Rhine Campaign, you teach me\r\nnothing. I know everything your Majesty did, and even what you said.\r\nI could relate to you your Journeys to Strasburg, to Holland, and what\r\npassed in a certain Boat. Apropos of this Rhine Campaign, one of our old\r\nGenerals, whom I often set talking, as one reads an old Manuscript, has\r\ntold me how astonished he was to see a young Prussian Officer, whom he\r\ndid not know, answering a General of the late King, who had given out\r\nthe order, Not to go a-foraging: \"And I, Sir, I order you to go; our\r\nArmy needs it; in short, I will have it so (JE LE VEUX)!--\"'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'You look at me too much from the favorable side! Ask these\r\nGentlemen about my humors and my caprices; they will tell you fine\r\nthings of me.'\r\n\r\n\"We got talking of some Anecdotes which are consigned to, or concealed\r\nin, certain obscure Books. 'I have been much amused, said I to the King,\r\n(with the big cargo of Books, true or false, written by French Refugees,\r\nwhich perhaps are unknown in France itself.' [Discourses a little on\r\nthis subject.]\r\n\r\nKING. \"'Where did you pick up all these fine old Pieces? These would\r\namuse me on an evening; better than the conversation of my Doctor of the\r\nSorbonne [one Peyrau, a wandering creature, not otherwise of the least\r\ninterest to us], [Nicolai, _Anekdoten,_ ii. 133 n.] whom I have here,\r\nand whom I am trying to convert.'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'I found them all in a Bohemian Library, where I sat diverting\r\nmyself for two Winters.'\r\n\r\nKING. \"'How, then? Two Winters in Bohemia? What the devil were you doing\r\nthere! Is it long since?'\r\n\r\nEGO. \"'No, Sire; only a year or two [Potato-War time]! I had retired\r\nthither to read at my ease.'--He smiled, and seemed to appreciate my not\r\nmentioning the little War of 1778, and saving him any speech about it.\r\nHe saw well enough that my Winter-quarters had been in Bohemia on that\r\noccasion; and was satisfied with my reticence. Being an old sorcerer,\r\nwho guessed everything, and whose tact was the finest ever known, he\r\ndiscovered that I did not wish to tell him I found Berlin changed since\r\nI had last been there. I took care not to remind him that I was at\r\nthe capturing of it in 1760, under M. de Lacy's orders [M. de Lacy's\r\nindeed!].--It was for having spoken of the first capture of Berlin, by\r\nMarshal Haddick [highly temporary as it was, and followed by Rossbach],\r\nthat the King had taken a dislike to M. de Ried.\r\n\r\n\"Apropos of the Doctor of the Sorbonne [uninteresting Peyrau] with whom\r\nhe daily disputed, the King said to me once, 'Get me a Bishopric for\r\nhim.' 'I don't think,' answered I, (that my recommendation, or that of\r\nyour Majesty, could be useful to him with us.' 'Ah, truly no!' said the\r\nKing: 'Well, I will write to the Czarina of Russia for this poor devil;\r\nhe does begin to bore me. He holds out as Jansenist, forsooth. MON DIEU,\r\nwhat blockheads the present Jansenists are! But France should not have\r\nextinguished that nursery (FOYER) of their genius, that Port Royal,\r\nextravagant as it was. Indeed, one ought to destroy nothing! Why have\r\nthey destroyed, too, the Depositaries of the graces of Rome and of\r\nAthens, those excellent Professors of the Humanities, and perhaps of\r\nHumanity, the Ex-Jesuit Fathers? Education will be the loser by it. But\r\nas my Brothers the Kings, most Catholic, most Christian, most Faithful\r\nand Apostolic, have tumbled them out, I, most Heretical, pick up as many\r\nas I can; and perhaps, one day, I shall be courted for the sake of them\r\nby those who want some. I preserve the breed: I said, counting my stock\r\nthe other day, \"A Rector like you, my Father, I could easily sell for\r\n300 thalers; you, Reverend Father Provincial, for 600; and so the rest,\r\nin proportion.\" When one is not rich, one makes speculations.'\r\n\r\n\"From want of memory, and of opportunities to see oftener and longer the\r\nGreatest Man that ever existed [Oh, MON PRINCE!], I am obliged to stop.\r\nThere is not a word in all this but was his own; and those who have seen\r\nhim will recognize his manner. All I want is, to make him known to those\r\nwho have not had the happiness to see him. His eyes are too hard in the\r\nPortraits: by work in the Cabinet, and the hardships of War, they had\r\nbecome intense, and of piercing quality; but they softened finely in\r\nhearing, or telling, some trait of nobleness or sensibility. Till his\r\ndeath, and but quite shortly before it,--notwithstanding many levities\r\nwhich he knew I had allowed myself, both in speaking and writing,\r\nand which he surely attributed only to my duty as opposed to my\r\ninterest,--he deigned to honor me with marks of his remembrance; and has\r\noften commissioned his Ministers, at Paris and at Vienna, to assure me\r\nof his good-will.\r\n\r\n\"I no longer believe in earthquakes and eclipses at Caesar's death,\r\nsince there has been nothing of such at that of Friedrich the Great. I\r\nknow not, Sire, whether great phenomena of Nature will announce the day\r\nwhen you shall cease to reign [great phenomena must be very idle if they\r\ndo, your Highness!]--but it is a phenomenon in the world, that of a King\r\nwho rules a Republic by making himself obeyed and respected for his\r\nown sake, as much as by his rights\" (Hear, hear). [Prince de Ligne,\r\n_Memoires et Melanges,_ i. 22-40.]\r\n\r\nPrince de Ligne thereupon hurries off for Petersburg, and the final\r\nSection of his Kaiser's Visit. An errand of his own, too, the Prince\r\nhad,--about his new Daughter-in-law Massalska, and claims of extensive\r\nPolish Properties belonging to her. He was the charm of Petersburg and\r\nthe Czarina; but of the Massalska Properties could retrieve nothing\r\nwhatever. The munificent Czarina gave him \"a beautiful Territory in\r\nthe Crim,\" instead; and invited him to come and see it with her, on his\r\nKaiser's next Visit (1787, the aquatic Visit and the highly scenic).\r\nWhich it is well known the Prince did; and has put on record, in his\r\npleasant, not untrue, though vague, high-colored and fantastic way,--if\r\nit or he at all concerned us farther.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW GENERAL VON DER MARWITZ, IN EARLY BOYHOOD, SAW FRIEDRICH THE GREAT\r\nTHREE TIMES (1782-1785).\r\n\r\nGeneral von der Marwitz, who died not many years ago, is of the\r\nold Marwitz kindred, several of whom we have known for their rugged\r\nhonesties, genialities and peculiar ways. This General, it appears,\r\nhad left a kind of Autobiography; which friends of his thought might be\r\nuseful to the Prussian Public, after those Radical distractions which\r\nburst out in 1848 and onwards; and a first Volume of the MARWITZ\r\nPOSTHUMOUS PAPERS was printed accordingly, [NACHLASS DES GENERAL VON DER\r\nMARWITZ (Berlin, 1852), 1 vol. 8vo.]--whether any more I have not\r\nheard; though I found this first Volume an excellent substantial bit of\r\nreading; and the Author a fine old Prussian Gentleman, very analogous\r\nin his structure to the fine old English ditto; who showed me the\r\nPER-CONTRA side of this and the other much-celebrated modern Prussian\r\nperson and thing, Prince Hardenberg, Johannes von Muller and the\r\nlike;--and yielded more especially the following Three Reminiscences\r\nof Friedrich, beautiful little Pictures, bathed in morning light, and\r\nevidently true to the life:--\r\n\r\n1. JUNE, 1782 OR 1783. \"The first time I saw him was in 1782 (or it\r\nmight be 1783, in my sixth year),\" middle of June, whichever year, \"as\r\nhe was returning from his Annual Review in Preussen [WEST-Preussen,\r\nnever revisits the Konigsberg region], and stopped to change horses\r\nat Dolgelin.\" Dolgelin is in Mullrose Country, westward of\r\nFrankfurt-on-Oder; our Marwitz Schloss not far from it. \"I had been\r\nsent with Mamsell Benezet,\" my French Governess; \"and, along with the\r\nClergyman of Dolgelin, we waited for the King.\r\n\r\n\"The King, on his journeys, generally preferred, whether at midday or\r\nfor the night, to halt in some Country place, and at the Parsonages most\r\nof all; probably because he was quieter there than in the Towns. To\r\nthe Clergyman this was always a piece of luck; not only because, if he\r\npleased the King, he might chance to get promoted; but because he was\r\nsure of profitable payment, at any rate; the King always ordering 50\r\nthalers [say 10 guineas] for his noon halt, and for his night's lodging\r\n100. The little that the King ate was paid for over and above. It is\r\ntrue, his Suite expected to be well treated; but this consisted only of\r\none or two individuals. Now, the King had been wont almost always, on\r\nthese journeys homewards, to pass the last night of his expedition with\r\nthe Clergyman of Dolgelin; and had done so last year, with this present\r\none who was then just installed; with him, as with his predecessor, the\r\nKing had talked kindly, and the 100 thalers were duly remembered. Our\r\ngood Parson flattered himself, therefore, that this time too the same\r\nwould happen; and he had made all preparations accordingly.\r\n\r\n\"So we waited there, and a crowd of people with us. The team of horses\r\nstood all ready (peasants' horses, poor little cats of things, but the\r\nbest that could be picked, for there were then no post-horses THAT COULD\r\nRUN FAST);--the country-fellows that were to ride postilion all decked,\r\nand ten head of horses for the King's coach: wheelers, four, which the\r\ncoachman drove from his box; then two successive pairs before, on each\r\npair a postilion-peasant; and upon the third pair, foremost of all, the\r\nKing's outriders were to go.\r\n\r\n\"And now, at last, came the FELDJAGER [Chacer, Hunting-groom], with his\r\nbig whip, on a peasant's, horse, a peasant with him as attendant. All\r\nblazing with heat, he dismounted; said, The King would be here in five\r\nminutes; looked at the relays, and the fellows with the water-buckets,\r\nwho were to splash the wheels; gulped down a quart of beer; and so,\r\nhis saddle in the interim having been fixed on another horse, sprang up\r\nagain, and off at a gallop. The King, then, was NOT to stay in Dolgelin!\r\nSoon came the Page, mounted in like style; a youth of 17 or 18; utterly\r\nexhausted; had to be lifted down from his horse, and again helped upon\r\nthe fresh one, being scarcely able to stand;--and close on the rear\r\nof him arrived the King. He was sitting alone in an old-fashioned\r\nglass-coach, what they call a VIS-A-VIS (a narrow carriage, two seats\r\nfore and aft, and on each of them room for only one person). The coach\r\nwas very long, like all the old carriages of that time; between the\r\ndriver's box and the body of the coach was a space of at least four\r\nfeet; the body itself was of pear-shape, peaked below and bellied out\r\nabove; hung on straps, with rolled knuckles [WINDEN], did not rest on\r\nsprings; two beams, connecting fore wheels and hind, ran not UNDER the\r\nbody of the coach, but along the sides of it, the hind-wheels following\r\nwith a goodly interval.\r\n\r\n\"The carriage drew up; and the King said to his coachman [the far-famed\r\nPfund]: 'Is this Dolgelin?' 'Yes, your Majesty!'--'I stay here.'\r\n'No,' said Pfund; 'The sun is not down yet. We can get on very well\r\nto Muncheberg to-night [ten miles ahead, and a Town too, perfidious\r\nPfund!]--and then to-morrow we are much earlier in Potsdam.' 'NA,\r\nHM,--well, if it must be so!'--\r\n\r\n\"And therewith they set to changing horses. The peasants who were\r\nstanding far off, quite silent, with reverently bared heads, came\r\nsoftly nearer, and looked eagerly at the King. An old Gingerbread-woman\r\n(SOMMELFRAU) of Lebbenichen [always knew her afterwards] took me in her\r\narm, and held me aloft close to the coach-window. I was now at farthest\r\nan ell from the King; and I felt as if I were looking in the face of God\r\nAlmighty (ES WAR MIR ALS OB ICH DEN LIEBEN GOTT ANSAHE). He was gazing\r\nsteadily out before him,\" into the glowing West, \"through the front\r\nwindow. He had on an old three-cornered regimental hat, and had put the\r\nhindward straight flap of it foremost, undoing the loop, so that this\r\nflap hung down in front, and screened him from the sun. The hat-strings\r\n(HUT-CORDONS,\" trimmings of silver or gold cord) \"had got torn loose,\r\nand were fluttering about on this down-hanging front flap; the white\r\nfeather in the hat was tattered and dirty; the plain blue uniform, with\r\nred cuffs, red collar and gold shoulder-bands [epaulettes WITHOUT\r\nbush at the end], was old and dusty, the yellow waistcoat covered with\r\nsnuff;--for the rest, he had black-velvet breeches [and, of course, the\r\nperpetual BOOTS, of which he would allow no polishing or blacking, still\r\nless any change for new ones while they would hang together]. I thought\r\nalways he would speak to me. The old woman could not long hold me up;\r\nand so she set me down again. Then the King looked at the Clergyman,\r\nbeckoned him near, and asked, Whose child it was? (Herr von Marwitz of\r\nFriedersdorf's.)--'Is that the General?' 'No, the Chamberlain.' The King\r\nmade no answer: he could not bear Chamberlains, whom he considered as\r\nidle fellows. The new horses were yoked; away they went. All day the\r\npeasants had been talking of the King, how he would bring this and that\r\ninto order, and pull everybody over the coals who was not agreeable to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Afterwards it turned out that all Clergymen were in the habit of giving\r\n10 thalers to the coachman Pfund, when the King lodged with them: the\r\nformer Clergyman of Dolgelin had regularly done it; but the new one,\r\nknowing nothing of the custom, had omitted it last year;--and that was\r\nthe reason why the fellow had so pushed along all day that he could pass\r\nDolgelin before sunset, and get his 10 thalers in Muncheberg from the\r\nBurgermeister there.\"\r\n\r\n2. JANUARY, 1785. \"The second time I saw the King was at the Carnival of\r\nBerlin in 1785. I had gone with my Tutor to a Cousin of mine who was a\r\nHofdame (DAME DE COUR) to the Princess Henri, and lived accordingly\r\nin the Prince-Henri Palace,--which is now, in our days, become the\r\nUniversity;--her Apartments were in the third story, and looked out into\r\nthe garden. As we were ascending the great stairs, there came dashing\r\npast us a little old man with staring eyes, jumping down three steps at\r\na time. My Tutor said, in astonishment, 'That is Prince Henri!' We now\r\nstept into a window of the first story, and looked out to see what the\r\nlittle man had meant by those swift boundings of his. And lo, there came\r\nthe King in his carriage to visit him.\r\n\r\n\"Friedrich the Second NEVER drove in Potsdam, except when on journeys,\r\nbut constantly rode. He seemed to think it a disgrace, and unworthy of a\r\nSoldier, to go in a carriage: thus, when in the last Autumn of his life\r\n(this very 1785) he was so unwell in the windy Sans-Souci (where there\r\nwere no stoves, but only hearth-fires), that it became necessary to\r\nremove to the Schloss in Potsdam, he could not determine to DRIVE\r\nthither, but kept hoping from day to day for so much improvement as\r\nmight allow him to ride. As no improvement came, and the weather grew\r\never colder, he at length decided to go over under cloud of darkness,\r\nin a sedan-chair, that nobody might notice him.--So likewise during the\r\nReviews at Berlin or Charlottenburg he appeared always on horseback: but\r\nduring the Carnival in Berlin, where he usually stayed four weeks, he\r\nDROVE, and this always in Royal pomp,--thus:--\r\n\r\n\"Ahead went eight runners with their staves, plumed caps and\r\nrunner-aprons [LAUFER-SCHURZE, whatever these are], in two rows. As\r\nthese runners were never used for anything except this show, the office\r\nwas a kind of post for Invalids of the Life-guard. A consequence of\r\nwhich was, that the King always had to go at a slow pace. His courses,\r\nhowever, were no other than from the Schloss to the Opera twice a week;\r\nand during his whole residence, one or two times to Prince Henri and the\r\nPrincess Amelia [once always, too, to dine with his Wife, to whom he did\r\nnot speak one word, but merely bowed at beginning and ending!]. After\r\nthis the runners rested again for a year. Behind them came the Royal\r\nCarriage, with a team of eight; eight windows round it; the horses with\r\nold-fashioned harness, and plumes on their heads. Coachman and outriders\r\nall in the then Royal livery,--blue; the collar, cuffs, pockets, and all\r\nseams, trimmed with a stripe of red cloth, and this bound on both sides\r\nwith small gold-cord; the general effect of which was very good. In the\r\nfour boots (NEBENTRITTEN) of the coach stood four Pages, red with gold,\r\nin silk stockings, feather-hats (crown all covered with feathers), but\r\nnot having plumes;--the valet's boot behind, empty; and to the rear of\r\nit, down below, where one mounts to the valet's boot [BEDIENTEN-TRITT,\r\nwhat is now become FOOT-BOARD], stood a groom (STALLKNECHT). Thus came\r\nthe King, moving slowly along; and entered through the portal of the\r\nPalace. We looked down from the window in the stairs. Prince Henri stood\r\nat the carriage-door; the pages opened it, the King stepped out, saluted\r\nhis Brother, took him by the hand, walked upstairs with him, and thus\r\nthe two passed near us (we retiring upstairs to the second story), and\r\nwent into the Apartment, where now Students run leaping about.\"\r\n\r\n3. MAY 23d, 1785. \"The third time I saw him was that same year, at\r\nBerlin still, as he returned home from the Review. [\"May 21st-23d\"\r\n(Rodenbeck, iii. 327).] My Tutor had gone with me for that end to the\r\nHalle Gate, for we already knew that on that day he always visited his\r\nSister, Princess Amelia. He came riding on a big white horse,--no doubt\r\nold CONDE, who, twenty years after this, still got his FREE-BOARD in the\r\nECOLE VETERINAIRE; for since the Bavarian War (1778), Friedrich hardly\r\never rode any other horse. His dress was the same as formerly at\r\nDolgelin, on the journey; only that the hat was in a little better\r\ncondition, properly looped up, and with the peak (but not with the LONG\r\npeak, as is now the fashion) set in front, in due military style. Behind\r\nhim were a guard of Generals, then the Adjutants, and finally the grooms\r\nof the party. The whole 'Rondeel' (now Belle-Alliance Platz) and the\r\nWilhelms-Strasse were crammed full of people; all windows crowded, all\r\nheads bare, everywhere the deepest silence; and on all countenances an\r\nexpression of reverence and confidence, as towards the just steersman\r\nof all our destinies. The King rode quite alone in front, and saluted\r\npeople, CONTINUALLY taking off his hat. In doing which he observed a\r\nvery marked gradation, according as the on-lookers bowing to him from\r\nthe windows seemed to deserve. At one time he lifted the hat a very\r\nlittle; at another he took it from his head, and held it an instant\r\nbeside the same; at another he sunk it as far as the elbow. But these\r\nmotions lasted continually; and no sooner had he put on his hat, than\r\nhe saw other people, and again took it off. From the Halle Gate to the\r\nKoch-Strasse he certainly took off his hat 200 times.\r\n\r\n\"Through this reverent silence there sounded only the trampling of the\r\nhorses, and the shouting of the Berlin street-boys, who went jumping\r\nbefore him, capering with joy, and flung up their hats into the air,\r\nor skipped along close by him, wiping the dust from his boots. I and my\r\nTutor had gained so much room that we could run alongside of him, hat in\r\nhand, among the boys.--You see the difference between then and now.\r\nWho was it that then made the noise? Who maintained a dignified\r\ndemeanor?--Who is it that bawls and bellows now? [Nobilities ought to\r\nbe noble, thinks this old Marwitz, in their reverence to Nobleness. If\r\nNobilities themselves become Washed Populaces in a manner, what are we\r\nto say?] And what value can you put on such bellowing?\r\n\r\n\"Arrived at the Princess Amelia's Palace (which, lying in the\r\nWilhelms-Strasse, fronts also into the Koch-Strasse), the crowd grew\r\nstill denser, for they expected him there: the forecourt was jammed\r\nfull; yet in the middle, without the presence of any police, there was\r\nopen space left for him and his attendants. He turned into the Court;\r\nthe gate-leaves went back; and the aged lame Princess, leaning on two\r\nLadies, the OBERHOFMEISTERINN (Chief Lady) behind her, came hitching\r\ndown the flat steps to meet him. So soon as he perceived her, he put his\r\nhorse to the gallop, pulled up, sprang rapidly down, took off his hat\r\n(which he now, however, held quite low at the full length of his arm),\r\nembraced her, gave her his arm, and again led her up the steps. The\r\ngate-leaves went to; all had vanished, and the multitude still stood,\r\nwith bared head, in silence, all eyes turned to the spot where he had\r\ndisappeared; and so it lasted a while, till each gathered himself and\r\npeacefully went his way.\r\n\r\n\"And yet there had nothing happened! No pomp, no fireworks, no\r\ncannon-shot, no drumming and fifing, no music, no event that had\r\noccurred! No, nothing but an old man of 73, ill-dressed, all dusty, was\r\nreturning from his day's work. But everybody knew that this old man was\r\ntoiling also for him; that he had set his whole life on that labor, and\r\nfor five-and-forty years had not given it the slip one day! Every one\r\nsaw, moreover, the fruits of this old man's labor, near and far,\r\nand everywhere around; and to look on the old man himself awakened\r\nreverence, admiration, pride, confidence,--in short all the nobler\r\nfeelings of man.\" [_Nachlass des General von der Marwitz,_ i. 15-20.]\r\n\r\nThis was May 21st, 1785; I think, the last time Berlin saw its King in\r\nthat public manner, riding through the streets. The FURSTENBUND Affair\r\nis now, secretly, in a very lively state, at Berlin and over Germany at\r\nlarge; and comes to completion in a couple of months hence,--as shall be\r\nnoticed farther on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL BOUILLE, HOME FROM HIS WEST-INDIAN EXPLOITS, VISITS FRIEDRICH\r\n(August 5th-11th, 1784).\r\n\r\nIn these last years of his life Friedrich had many French of distinction\r\nvisiting him. In 1782, the Abbe Raynal (whom, except for his power of\r\nface, he admired little); [Rodenbeck, iii. 277 n.] in 1786, Mirabeau\r\n(whose personal qualities seem to have pleased him);--but chiefly, in\r\nthe interval between these two, various Military Frenchmen, now home\r\nwith their laurels from the American War, coming about his Reviews:\r\neager to see the Great Man, and be seen by him. Lafayette, Segur and\r\nmany others came; of whom the one interesting to us is Marquis de\r\nBouille: already known for his swift sharp operation on the English\r\nLeeward Islands; and memorable afterwards to all the world for his\r\npresidency in the FLIGHT TO VARENNES of poor Louis XVI. and his Queen,\r\nin 1791; which was by no means so successful. \"The brave Bouille,\" as we\r\ncalled him long since, when writing of that latter operation, elsewhere.\r\nBouille left MEMOIRES of his own: which speak of Friedrich: in the _Vie\r\nde Bouille,_ published recently by friendly hands: [Rene de Bouille,\r\nESSAI SUR LA VIE DU MARQUIS DE BOUILLE (Paris, 1853)] there is Summary\r\ngiven of all that his Papers say on Friedrich; this, in still briefer\r\nshape, but unchanged otherwise, readers shall now see.\r\n\r\n\"In July, 1784, Marquis de Bouille (lately returned from a visit to\r\nEngland), desirous to see the Prussian Army, and to approach the great\r\nFriedrich while it was yet time, travelled by way of Holland to Berlin,\r\nthrough Potsdam [no date; got to Berlin \"August 6th;\" [Rodenbeck, iii.\r\n309.] so that we can guess \"August 5th\" for his Potsdam day]. Saw, at\r\nSans-Souci, in the vestibule, a bronze Bust of Charles XII.; in the\r\ndining-room, among other pictures, a portrait of the Chateauroux, Louis\r\nXV.'s first Mistress. In the King's bedroom, simple camp-bed, coverlet\r\nof crimson taffetas,--rather dirty, as well as the other furniture,\r\non account of the dogs. Many books lying about: Cicero, Tacitus, Titus\r\nLivius [in French Translations]. On a chair, Portrait of Kaiser Joseph\r\nII.; same in King's Apartments in Berlin Schloss, also in the Potsdam\r\nNew Palace: 'C'EST UN JEUNE HOMME QUE JE NE DOIS PAS PERDRE DE VUE.'\r\n\r\n\"King entering, took off his hat, saluting the Marquis, whom\r\na Chamberlain called Gortz presented [no Chamberlain; a\r\nLieutenant-General, and much about the King; his Brother, the Weimar\r\nGortz, is gone as Prussian Minister to Petersburg some time ago]. King\r\ntalked about the War DES ISLES [my West-India War], and about England.\r\n'They [the English] are like sick people who have had a fever; and don't\r\nknow how ill they have been, till the fit is over.' Fox he treated as\r\na noisy fellow (DE BROUILLON); but expressed admiration of young Pitt.\r\n'The coolness with which he can stand being not only contradicted, but\r\nridiculed and insulted, CELA PARAIT AU-DESSUS DE LA PATIENCE HUMAINE.'\r\nKing closed the conversation by saying he would be glad to see me in\r\nSilesia, whither he was just about to go for Reviews [will go in ten\r\ndays, August 15th].\r\n\r\n\"Friedrich was 72,\" last January 24th. \"His physiognomy, dress,\r\nappearance, are much what the numerous well-known Portraits represent\r\nhim. At Court, and on great Ceremonies, he appears sometimes in\r\nblack-colored stockings rolled over the knee, and rose-colored or\r\nsky-blue coat (BLEU CELESTE). He is fond of these colors, as his\r\nfurniture too shows. The Marquis dined with the Prince of Prussia,\r\nwithout previous presentation; so simple are the manners of this Soldier\r\nCourt. The Heir Presumptive lodges at a brewer's house, and in a very\r\nmean way; is not allowed to sleep from home without permission from the\r\nKing.\"\r\n\r\nBouille set out for Silesia 11th August; was at Neisse in good time.\r\n\"Went, at 5 A.M. [date is August 19th, Review lasts till 24th],\r\n[Rodenbeck, iii. 310.] to see the King mount. All the Generals, Prince\r\nof Prussia among them, waited in the street; outside of a very simple\r\nHouse, where the King lodged. After waiting half an hour, his Majesty\r\nappeared; saluted very graciously, without uttering a word. This was\r\none of his special Reviews [that was it!]. He rode (MARCHAIT) generally\r\nalone, in utter silence; it was then that he had his REGARD TERRIBLE,\r\nand his features took the impress of severity, to say no more. [Is\r\ndispleased with the Review, I doubt, though Bouille saw nothing\r\namiss;--and merely tells us farther:] At the Reviews the King inspects\r\nstrictly one regiment after another: it is he that selects the very\r\nCorporals and Sergeants, much more the Upper Officers; nominating for\r\nvacancies what Cadets are to fill them,--all of whom are Nobles.\" Yes,\r\nwith rare exceptions, all. Friedrich, democratic as his temper was, is\r\nvery strict on this point; \"because,\" says he repeatedly, \"Nobles have\r\nhonor; a Noble that misbehaves, or flinches in the moment of crisis, can\r\nfind no refuge in his own class; whereas a man of lower birth always can\r\nin his.\" [_OEuvres de Frederic,_ (more than once).] Bouille continues:--\r\n\r\n\"After Review, dined with his Majesty. Just before dinner he gave to the\r\nassembled Generals the 'Order' for to-morrow's Manoeuvres [as we saw in\r\nConway's case, ten years ago]. This lasted about a quarter of an hour;\r\nKing then saluted everybody, taking off TRES-AFFECTUEUSEMENT his hat,\r\nwhich he immediately put on again. Had now his affable mien, and was\r\nmost polite to the strangers present. At dinner, conversation turned\r\non the Wars of Louis XIV.; then on English-American War,--King always\r\nblaming the English, whom he does not like. Dinner lasted three hours.\r\nHis Majesty said more than once to me [in ill humor, I should almost\r\nguess, and wishful to hide it]: 'Complete freedom here, as if we were in\r\nour Tavern, Sir (ICI, TOUTE LIBERTE, MONSIEUR, COMME SI NOUS ETIONS AU\r\nCABARET)!' On the morrow,\" August 20th, \"dined again. King talked of\r\nFrance; of Cardinal Richelieu, whose principles of administration he\r\npraised. Repeated several times, that 'he did not think the French\r\nNation fit for Free Government.' At the Reviews, Friedrich did not\r\nhimself command; but prescribed, and followed the movements; criticised,\r\nreprimanded and so forth. On horseback six hours together, without\r\nseeming fatigued.\r\n\r\n\"King left for Breslau 25th August [24th, if it were of moment]. Bouille\r\nfollowed thither; dined again. Besides Officers, there were present\r\nseveral Polish Princes, the Bishop of the Diocese, and the Abbot\r\nBastiani. King made pleasantries about religion [pity, that]; Bastiani\r\nnot slow with repartees\", of a defensive kind. \"King told me, on one\r\noccasion, 'Would you believe it? I have just been putting my poor\r\nJesuits' finances into order. They understand nothing of such things,\r\nCES BONS HOMMES. They are useful to me in forming my Catholic Clergy.\r\nI have arranged it with his Holiness the Pope, who is a friend of mine,\r\nand behaves very well to me.' Pointing from the window to the Convent of\r\nCapuchins, 'Those fellows trouble me a little with their bell-ringings.\r\nThey offered to stop it at night, for my sake: but I declined. One must\r\nleave everybody to his trade; theirs is to pray, and I should have been\r\nsorry to deprive them of their chimes (CARILLON).'\r\n\r\n\"The 20,000 troops, assembled at Breslau, did not gain the King's\r\napproval,\"--far from it, alas, as we shall all see!\" To some Chiefs of\r\nCorps he said, 'VOUS RESSEMBLEZ PLUS A DES TAILLEURS QU'A DES MILITAIRES\r\n(You are more like tailors than soldiers)!' He cashiered several,\r\nand even sent one Major-General to prison for six weeks.\" That of the\r\ntailors, and Major-General Erlach clapt in prison, is too true;--nor is\r\nthat the saddest part of the Affair to us. \"Bouille was bound now on\r\nan excursion to Prag, to a Camp of the Kaiser's there. 'Mind,' said the\r\nKing, alluding to Bouille's BLUE uniform,--'mind, in the Country you\r\nare going to, they don't like the blue coats; and your Queen has even\r\npreserved the family repugnance, for she does not like them either.'\r\n[ESSAI SUR LA VIE DU MARQUIS DE BOUILLE, pp. l34-149.]\r\n\r\n\"September 5th, 1784, Bouille arrived at Prag. Austrian Manoeuvres\r\nare very different; troops, though more splendidly dressed, contrast\r\nunfavorably with Prussians;\"--unfavorably, though the strict King was so\r\ndissatisfied. \"Kaiser Joseph, speaking of Friedrich, always admiringly\r\ncalls him 'LE ROI.' Joseph a great questioner, and answers his own\r\nquestions. His tone BRUSQUE ET DECIDE. Dinner lasted one hour.\r\n\r\n\"Returned to Potsdam to assist at the Autumn Reviews\", 21st-23d\r\nSeptember, 1784. [Rodenbeck, iii. 313.] \"Dinner very splendid,\r\nmagnificently served; twelve handsome Pages, in blue or rose-colored\r\nvelvet, waited on the Guests,--these being forty old rude Warriors\r\nbooted and spurred. King spoke of the French, approvingly: 'But,' added\r\nhe, 'the Court spoils everything. Those Court-fellows, with their red\r\nheels and delicate nerves, make very bad soldiers. Saxe often told me,\r\nIn his Flanders Campaigns the Courtiers gave him more trouble than did\r\nCumberland.' Talked of Marechal Richelieu; of Louis XIV., whose apology\r\nhe skilfully made. Blamed, however, the Revocation of the Edict of\r\nNantes. Great attachment of the 'Protestant Refugees' to France and its\r\nKing. 'Would you believe it?' said he: 'Under Louis XIV. they and their\r\nfamilies used to assemble on the day of St. Louis, to celebrate the\r\nFETE of the King who persecuted them!' Expressed pity for Louis XV., and\r\npraised his good-nature.\r\n\r\n\"Friedrich, in his conversation, showed a modesty which seemed a little\r\naffected. 'S'IL M'EST PERMIS D'AVOIR UNE OPINION,' a common expression\r\nof his;--said 'opinion' on most things, on Medicine among others,\r\nbeing always excellent. Thinks French Literature surpasses that of the\r\nAncients. Small opinion of English Literature: turned Shakspeare into\r\nridicule; and made also bitter fun of German Letters,--their Language\r\nbarbarous, their Authors without genius....\r\n\r\n\"I asked, and received permission from the King, to bring my Son to be\r\nadmitted in his ACADEMIE DES GENTILSHOMMES; an exceptional favor. On\r\nparting, the King said to me: 'I hope you will return to me Marechal de\r\nFrance; it is what I should like; and your Nation could n't do better,\r\nnobody being in a state to render it greater services.'\"\r\n\r\nBouille will reappear for an instant next year. Meanwhile he returns to\r\nFrance, \"first days of October, 1784,\" where he finds Prince Henri; who\r\nis on Visit there for three months past. [\"2d July, 1784,\" Prince Henri\r\nhad gone (Rodenbeck, iii. 309).] A shining event in Prince Henri's Life;\r\nand a profitable; poor King Louis--what was very welcome in Henri's\r\nstate of finance--having, in a delicate kingly way, insinuated into\r\nhim a \"Gift of 400,000 francs\" (16,000 pounds): [Anonymous (De la\r\nRoche-Aymon), _Vie privee, politique et militaire du Prince Henri, Frere\r\nde Frederic II._ (a poor, vague and uninstructive, though authentic\r\nlittle Book: Paris, 1809), pp. 219-239.]--partly by way of retaining-fee\r\nfor France; \"may turn to excellent account,\" think some, \"when a certain\r\nNephew comes to reign yonder, as he soon must.\"\r\n\r\nWhat Bouille heard about the Silesian Reviews is perfectly true; and\r\nonly a part of the truth. Here, to the person chiefly responsible, is\r\nan indignant Letter of the King's: to a notable degree, full of settled\r\nwrath against one who is otherwise a dear old Friend:--\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH TO LIEUTENANT-GENERAL TAUENTZIEN INFANTRY INSPECTOR-GENERAL OF\r\nSILESIA.\r\n\r\n\"POTSDAM, 7th September, 1784.\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR GENERAL VON TAUENTZIEN,--While in Silesia I mentioned to you,\r\nand will now repeat in writing, That my Army in Silesia was at no\r\ntime so bad as at present. Were I to make Shoemakers or Tailors into\r\nGenerals, the Regiments could not be worse. Regiment THADDEN is not\r\nfit to be the most insignificant militia battalion of a Prussian Army;\r\nROTHKIRCH and SCHWARTZ\"--bad as possible all of them--\"of ERLACH, the\r\nmen are so spoiled by smuggling [sad industry, instead of drilling],\r\nthey have no resemblance to Soldiers; KELLER is like a heap of undrilled\r\nboors; HAGER has a miserable Commander; and your own Regiment is\r\nvery mediocre. Only with Graf von Anhalt [in spite of his head], with\r\nWENDESSEN and MARGRAF HEINRICH, could I be content. See you, that is the\r\nstate I found the Regiments in, one after one. I will now speak of their\r\nManoeuvring [in our Mimic Battles on the late occasion]:--\r\n\r\n\"Schwartz; at Neisse, made the unpardonable mistake of not sufficiently\r\nbesetting the Height on the Left Wing; had it been serious, the Battle\r\nhad been lost. At Breslau, Erlach [who is a Major-General, forsooth!],\r\ninstead of covering the Army by seizing the Heights, marched off with\r\nhis Division straight as a row of cabbages into that Defile; whereby,\r\nhad it been earnest, the enemy's Cavalry would have cut down our\r\nInfantry, and the Fight was gone.\r\n\r\n\"It is not my purpose to lose Battles by the base conduct (LACHETE) of\r\nmy Generals: wherefore I hereby appoint, That you, next year, if I be\r\nalive, assemble the Army between Breslau and Ohlau; and for four days\r\nbefore I arrive in your Camp, carefully manoeuvre with the ignorant\r\nGenerals, and teach them what their duty is. Regiment VON ARNIM and\r\nGarrison-Regiment VON KANITZ are to act the Enemy: and whoever does not\r\nthen fulfil his duty shall go to Court-Martial,--for I should think it\r\nshame of any Country (JEDEN PUISSANCE) to keep such people, who trouble\r\nthemselves so little about their business. Erlach sits four weeks longer\r\nin arrest [to have six weeks of it in full]. And you have to make known\r\nthis my present Declared Will to your whole Inspection.--F.\" [Rodenbeck,\r\niii. 311.]\r\n\r\nWhat a peppering is the excellent old Tauentzien getting! Here is a case\r\nfor Kaltenborn, and the sympathies of Opposition people. But, alas,\r\nthis King knows that Armies are not to be kept at the working point\r\non cheaper terms,--though some have tried it, by grog, by sweetmeats,\r\nsweet-speeches, and found it in the end come horribly dearer! One thing\r\nis certain: the Silesian Reviews, next Year, if this King be alive,\r\nwill be a terrible matter; and Military Gentlemen had better look to\r\nthemselves in time! Kaltenborn's sympathy will help little; nothing\r\nbut knowing one's duty, and visibly and indisputably doing it, will the\r\nleast avail.\r\n\r\nJust in the days when Bouille left him for France, Friedrich (\"October,\r\n1784\") had conceived the notion of some general Confederation, or\r\nCombination in the Reich, to resist, the continual Encroachments of\r\nAustria; which of late are becoming more rampant than ever. Thus, in\r\nthe last year, especially within the last six months, a poor Bishop of\r\nPassau, quasi-Bavarian, or in theory Sovereign Bishop of the Reich, is\r\ngetting himself pulled to pieces (Diocese torn asunder, and masses of\r\nit forcibly sewed on to their new \"Bishopric of Vienna\"), in the most\r\ntragic manner, in spite of express Treaties, and of all the outcries\r\nthe poor man and the Holy Father himself can make against it. [Dohm\r\n(DENKWURDIGKEITEN, iii. 46,--GESCHICHTE DER LETZTEN PERIODE FRIEDRICHS\r\nDES ZWEITEN) gives ample particulars. Dohm's first 3 volumes call\r\nthemselves \"History of Friedrich's last Period, 1778-1786;\" and are\r\nfull of Bavarian War, 3d vol. mostly of FURSTENBUND;--all in a candid,\r\nauthentic, but watery and rather wearisome way.] To this of Passau, and\r\nto the much of PANIS-BRIEFE and the like which had preceded, Friedrich,\r\nthough studiously saying almost nothing, had been paying the utmost of\r\nattention:--part of Prince Henri's errand to France is thought to\r\nhave been, to take soundings on those matters (on which France proves\r\naltogether willing, if able); and now, in the general emotion about\r\nPassau, Friedrich jots down in a Note to Hertzberg the above idea; with\r\norder to put it into form a little, and consult about it in the\r\nReich with parties interested. Hertzberg took the thing up with zeal;\r\ninstructed the Prussian Envoys to inquire, cautiously, everywhere;\r\nfancied he did find willingness in the Courts of the Reich, in Hanover\r\nespecially: in a word, got his various irons into the fire;--and had not\r\nproceeded far, when there rose another case of Austrian Encroachment,\r\nwhich eclipsed all the preceding; and speedily brought Hertzberg's irons\r\nto the welding-point. Too brief we cannot be in this matter; here are\r\nthe dates, mostly from Dohm:--\r\n\r\nNEW-YEAR'S DAY, 1785, on or about that day, Romanzow, Son of our\r\nold Colberg and Anti-Turk friend, who is Russian \"Minister in the\r\nOber-Rheinish Circle,\" appears at the little Court of Zweibruck, with a\r\nmost sudden and astounding message to the Duke there:--\r\n\r\n\"Important bargain agreed upon between your Kaiser and his Highness of\r\nthe Pfalz and Baiern; am commanded by my Sovereign Lady, on behalf of\r\nher friend the Kaiser, to make it known to you. Baiern all and whole\r\nmade over to Austria; in return for which the now Kur-Baiern gets the\r\nAustrian Netherlands (Citadels of Limburg and Luxemburg alone excepted);\r\nand is a King henceforth, 'King of Burgundy' to be the Title, he and\r\nhis fortunate Successors for all time coming. To your fortunate self, in\r\nacknowledgment of your immediate consent, Austria offers the free-gift\r\nof 100,000 pounds, and to your Brother Max of 50,000 pounds; Kur-Baiern,\r\nfor his loyal conduct, is to have 150,000 pounds; and to all of you, if\r\nhandsome, Austria will be handsome generally. For the rest, the thing is\r\nalready settled; and your refusal will not hinder it from going forward.\r\nI request to know, within eight days, what your Highness's determination\r\nis!\"\r\n\r\nHis poor Highness, thunderstruck as may be imagined, asks:\r\n\"But--but--What would your Excellency advise me?\" \"Have n't the least\r\nadvice,\" answers his Excellency: \"will wait at Frankfurt-on-Mayn, for\r\neight days, what your Highness's resolution is; hoping it may be a wise\r\none;--and have the honor at present to say Good-morning.\" Sudden, like a\r\nthunder-bolt in winter, the whole phenomenon. This, or JANUARY 3d,\r\nwhen Friedrich, by Express from Zweibruck, first heard of this, may be\r\nconsidered as birthday of a Furstenbund now no longer hypothetic, but\r\ncertain to become actual.\r\n\r\nZweibruck naturally shot off expresses: to Petersburg (no answer ever);\r\nto Berlin (with answer on the instant);--and in less than eight days,\r\npoor Zweibruck, such the intelligence from Berlin, was in a condition to\r\nwrite to Frankfurt: \"Excellency; No; I do not consent, nor ever will.\"\r\nFor King Friedrich is broad-awake again;--and Hertzberg's smithy-fires,\r\nwe may conceive how the winds rose upon these, and brought matters to a\r\nwelding heat!--\r\n\r\nThe Czarina,--on Friedrich's urgent remonstrance, \"What is this, great\r\nMadam? To your old Ally, and from the Guaranty and Author of the Peace\r\nof Teschen!\"--had speedily answered: \"Far from my thoughts to violate\r\nthe Peace of Teschen; very far: I fancied this was an advantageous\r\nexchange, advantageous to Zweibruck especially; but since Zweibruck\r\nthinks otherwise, of course there is an end.\" \"Of course;\"--though my\r\nRomanzow did talk differently; and the forge-fires of a certain person\r\nare getting blown at a mighty rate! Hertzberg's operation was conducted\r\nat first with the greatest secrecy; but his Envoys were busy in all\r\nlikely places, his Proposal finding singular consideration; acceptance,\r\nhere, there,--\"A very mild and safe-looking Project, most mild in tone\r\nsurely!\"--and it soon came to Kaunitz's ear; most unwelcome to the new\r\nKingdom of Burgundy and him!\r\n\r\nThrice over, in the months ensuing (April 13th, May 11th, June 23d), in\r\nthe shape of a \"Circular to all Austrian Ambassadors\", [Dohm, iii. 64,\r\n68.] Kaunitz lifted up his voice in severe dehortation, the tone of him\r\nwaxing more and more indignant, and at last snuffling almost tremulous\r\nquite into alt, \"against the calumnies and malices of some persons,\r\nmisinterpreters of a most just Kaiser and his actions.\" But as the\r\nCzarina, meanwhile, declared to the Reich at large, that she held, and\r\nwould ever hold, the Peace of Teschen a thing sacred, and this or any\r\nKingdom of Burgundy, or change of the Reichs Laws, impossible,--the\r\nKaunitz clangors availed nothing; and Furstenbund privately, but at\r\na mighty pace, went forward. And, JUNE 29th, 1785, after much\r\nlabor, secret but effective, on the part of Dohm and others, Three\r\nPlenipotentiaries, the Prussian, the Saxon, the Hanoverian (\"excellent\r\nmethod to have only the principal Three!\" ) met, still very privately,\r\nat Berlin; and laboring their best, had, in about four weeks, a\r\nFurstenbund Covenant complete; signed, JULY 23d, by these Three,--to\r\nwhom all others that approved append themselves. As an effective\r\nrespectable number, Brunswick, Hessen, Mainz and others, did, [List of\r\nthem in Dohm.]--had not, indeed, the first Three themselves,\r\nespecially as Hanover meant England withal, been themselves moderately\r\nsufficient.--Here, before the date quite pass, are two Clippings which\r\nmay be worth their room:--\r\n\r\n1. BOUILLE'S SECOND VISIT (Spring, 1785). May 10th, 1785,--just while\r\nFURSTENBUND, so privately, was in the birth-throes,--\"Marquis de Bouille\r\nhad again come to Berlin, to place his eldest Son in the ACADEMIE DES\r\nGENTILSHOMMES; where the young man stayed two years. Was at Potsdam\" May\r\n13th-16th; [Rodenbeck, iii. 325.] \"well received; dined at Sans-Souci.\r\nInformed the King of the Duc de Choiseul's death [Paris, May 8th). King,\r\nshaking his head, 'IL N'Y A PAS GRAND MAL.' Seems piqued at the Queen of\r\nFrance, who had not shown much attention to Prince Henri. Spoke of\r\nPeter the Great, 'whose many high qualities were darkened by singular\r\ncruelty.' When at Berlin, going on foot, as his custom was, unattended,\r\nto call on King Friedrich Wilhelm, the people in the streets crowded\r\nmuch about him. 'Brother,' said he to the King, 'your subjects are\r\ndeficient in respect; order one or two of them to be hanged; it will\r\nrestrain the others!' During the same visit, one day, at Charlottenburg;\r\nthe Czar, after dinner, stepped out on a balcony which looked into\r\nthe Gardens. Seeing many people assembled below, he gnashed his teeth\r\n(GRINCA DES DENTS), and began giving signs of frenzy. Shifty little\r\nCatharine, who was with him, requested that a certain person down\r\namong the crowd, who had a yellow wig, should be at once put away, or\r\nsomething bad would happen. This done, the Czar became quiet again. The\r\nCzarina added, he was subject to such attacks of frenzy; and that, when\r\nshe saw it, she would scratch his head, which moderated him. 'VOILA\r\nMONSIEUR,' concluded the King, addressing me: 'VOILA LES GRANDS HOMMES!'\r\n\r\n\"Bouille spent a fortnight at Reinsberg, with Prince Henri; who\r\nrepresents his Brother as impatient, restless, envious, suspicious, even\r\ntimid; of an ill-regulated imagination\",--nothing like so wise as some\r\nof us! \"Is too apprehensive of war; which may very likely bring it on.\r\nOn the least alarm, he assembles troops at the frontier; Joseph does the\r\nlike; and so\"--A notably splenetic little Henri; head of an Opposition\r\nParty which has had to hold its tongue. Cherishes in the silent depths\r\nof him an almost ghastly indignation against his Brother on some points.\r\n\"Bouille returned to Paris June, 1785.\" [ESSAI SUR LA VIE DE BOUILLE\r\n(ubi supra).]\r\n\r\n2. COMTE DE SEGUR (on the road to Petersburg as French Minister) HAS\r\nSEEN FRIEDRICH: January 29th, 1785. Segur says: \"With lively curiosity I\r\ngazed at this man; there as he stood, great in genius, small in stature;\r\nstooping, and as it were bent down under the weight of his laurels and\r\nof his long toils. His blue coat, old and worn like his body; his long\r\nboots coming up above the knee; his waistcoat covered with snuff, formed\r\nan odd but imposing whole. By the fire of his eyes, you recognized\r\nthat in essentials he had not grown old. Though bearing himself like\r\nan invalid, you felt that he could strike like a young soldier; in his\r\nsmall figure, you discerned a spirit greater than any other man's....\r\n\r\n\"If used at all to intercourse with the great world, and possessed of\r\nany elevation of mind, you have no embarrassment in speaking to a King;\r\nbut to a Great Man you present yourself not without fear. Friedrich, in\r\nhis private sphere, was of sufficiently unequal humor; wayward, wilful;\r\nopen to prejudices; indulged in mockery, often enough epigrammatic upon\r\nthe French;--agreeable in a high degree to strangers whom he pleased to\r\nfavor; but bitterly piquant for those he was prepossessed against, or\r\nwho, without knowing it, had ill-chosen the hour of approaching him. To\r\nme, luck was kind in all these points;\" my Interview delightful, but not\r\nto be reported farther. [_\"Memoires par M. le Comte de Segur_ (Paris,\r\n1826), ii. 133, 120:\" cited in PREUSS, iv. 218. For date, see Rodenbeck,\r\niii. 322, 323.]\r\n\r\nExcept Mirabeau, about a year after this, Segur is the last\r\ndistinguished French visitor. French Correspondence the King has\r\nnow little or none. October gone a year, his D'Alembert, the last\r\nintellectual Frenchman he had a real esteem for, died. Paris and France\r\nseem to be sinking into strange depths; less and less worth hearing of.\r\nNow and then a straggling Note from Condorcet, Grimm or the like, are\r\nall he gets there.\r\n\r\nThat of the Furstenbund put a final check on Joseph's notions of making\r\nthe Reich a reality; his reforms and ambitions had thenceforth to\r\ntake other directions, and leave the poor old Reich at peace. A mighty\r\nreformer he had been, the greatest of his day. Broke violently in upon\r\nquiescent Austrian routine, on every side: monkeries, school-pedantries,\r\ntrade-monopolies, serfages,--all things, military and civil, spiritual\r\nand temporal, he had resolved to make perfect in a minimum of time.\r\nAustria gazed on him, its admiration not unmixed with terror. He rushed\r\nincessantly about; hardy as a Charles Twelfth; slept on his bearskin\r\non the floor of any inn or hut;--flew at the throat of every Absurdity,\r\nhowever broad-based or dangerously armed, \"Disappear, I say!\" Will hurl\r\nyou an Official of Rank, where need is, into the Pillory; sets him, in\r\none actual instance, to permanent sweeping of the streets in Vienna.\r\nA most prompt, severe, and yet beneficent and charitable kind of man.\r\nImmensely ambitious, that must be said withal. A great admirer of\r\nFriedrich; bent to imitate him with profit. \"Very clever indeed,\" says\r\nFriedrich; \"but has the fault [a terribly grave one!] of generally\r\ntaking the second step without having taken the first.\"\r\n\r\nA troublesome neighbor he proved to everybody, not by his reforms\r\nalone;--and ended, pretty much as here in the FURSTENBUND, by having,\r\nin all matters, to give in and desist. In none of his foreign Ambitions\r\ncould he succeed; in none of his domestic Reforms. In regard to these\r\nlatter, somebody remarks: \"No Austrian man or thing articulately\r\ncontradicted his fine efforts that way; but, inarticulately, the\r\nwhole weight of Austrian VIS INERTIAE bore day and night against\r\nhim;--whereby, as we now see, he bearing the other way with the force of\r\na steam-ram, a hundred tons to the square inch, the one result was, To\r\ndislocate every joint in the Austrian Edifice, and have it ready for the\r\nNapoleonic Earthquakes that ensued.\" In regard to ambitions abroad it\r\nwas no better. The Dutch fired upon his Scheld Frigate: \"War, if\r\nyou will, you most aggressive Kaiser; but this Toll is ours!\"\r\nHis Netherlands revolted against him, \"Can holy religion, and old\r\nuse-and-wont be tumbled about at this rate?\" His Grand Russian\r\nCopartneries and Turk War went to water and disaster. His reforms, one\r\nand all, had to be revoked for the present. Poor Joseph, broken-hearted\r\n(for his private griefs were many, too), lay down to die. \"You may put\r\nfor epitaph,\" said he with a tone which is tragical and pathetic to us,\r\n\"Here lies Joseph,\" the grandly attempting Joseph, \"who could succeed\r\nin nothing.\" [Died, at Vienna, 20th February, 1790, still under\r\nfifty;--born there 13th March, 1741. Hormayr, _OEsterreichischer\r\nPlutarch,_ iv. (2tes) 125-223 (and five or six recent LIVES of Joseph,\r\nnone of which, that I have seen, was worth reading, in comparison).] A\r\nman of very high qualities, and much too conscious of them. A man of\r\nan ambition without bounds. One of those fatal men, fatal to themselves\r\nfirst of all, who mistake half-genius for whole; and rush on the second\r\nstep without having made the first. Cannot trouble the old King or us\r\nany more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX.--FRIEDRICH'S LAST ILLNESS AND DEATH.\r\n\r\nTo the present class of readers, Furstenbund is become a Nothing; to all\r\nof us the grand Something now is, strangely enough, that incidental item\r\nwhich directly followed, of Reviewing the Silesian soldieries, who had\r\nso angered his Majesty last year. \"If I be alive next year!\" said\r\nthe King to Tauentzien. The King kept his promise; and the Fates had\r\nappointed that, in doing so, he was to find his--But let us not yet\r\npronounce the word.\r\n\r\nAUGUST 16th, 1785, some three weeks after finishing the Furstenbund,\r\nFriedrich set out for Silesia: towards Strehlen long known to him and us\r\nall;--at Gross-Tinz, a Village in that neighborhood, the Camp and Review\r\nare to be. He goes by Crossen, Glogau; in a circling direction: Glogau,\r\nSchweidnitz, Silberberg, Glatz, all his Fortresses are to be inspected\r\nas well, and there is much miscellaneous business by the road. At\r\nHirschberg, not on the military side, we have sight of him; the account\r\nof which is strange to read:--\r\n\r\n\"THURSDAY, AUGUST 18th,\" says a private Letter from that little Town,\r\n[Given IN EXTENSO, Rodenbeck, iii. 331-333.] \"he passed through here:\r\nconcourse of many thousands, from all the Country about, had been\r\nwaiting for him several hours. Outriders came at last; then he himself,\r\nthe Unique; and, with the liveliest expression of reverence and love,\r\nall eyes were directed on one point. I cannot describe to you my\r\nfeelings, which of course were those of everybody, to see him, the aged\r\nKing; in his weak hand the hat; in those grand eyes such a fatherly\r\nbenignity of look over the vast crowd that encircled his Carriage, and\r\nrolled tide-like, accompanying it. Looking round when he was past, I saw\r\nin various eyes a tear trembling. [\"Alas, we sha'n't have him long!\"]\r\n\r\n\"His affability, his kindliness, to whoever had the honor of speech with\r\nthis great King, who shall describe it! After talking a good while\r\nwith the Merchants-Deputation from the Hill Country, he said, 'Is\r\nthere anything more, then, from anybody?' Upon which, the President\r\n(KAUFMANNSALTESTE,\" Merchants'-Eldest) \"Lachmann, from Greiffenberg,\"\r\nwhich had been burnt lately, and helped by the King to rebuild itself,\r\n\"stepped forward, and said, 'The burnt-out Inhabitants of Greiffenberg\r\nhad charged him to express once more their most submissive gratitude for\r\nthe gracious help in rebuilding; their word of thanks, truly, was of no\r\nimportance, but they daily prayed God to reward such Royal beneficence.'\r\nThe King was visibly affected, and said, 'You don't need to thank me;\r\nwhen my subjects fall into misfortune, it is my duty to help them up\r\nagain; for that reason am I here.'\"...\r\n\r\nSaturday 20th, he arrived at Tinz; had a small Cavalry Manoeuvre, next\r\nday; and on Monday the Review Proper began. Lasted four days,--22d-25th\r\nAugust, Monday to Thursday, both inclusive. \"Head-quarter was in the\r\nDORF-SCHULZE'S (Village Mayor's) house; and there were many Strangers\r\nof distinction quartered in the Country Mansions round.\" Gross-Tinz is\r\nabout 12 miles straight north from Strehlen, and as far straight east\r\nfrom the Zobtenberg: Gross-Tinz, and its Review of August, 1785, ought\r\nto be long memorable.\r\n\r\nHow the Review turned out as to proficiency recovered, I have not heard;\r\nand only infer, by symptoms, that it was not unsatisfactory. The sure\r\nfact, and the forever memorable, is, That on Wednesday, the third day\r\nof it, from 4 in the morning, when the Manoeuvres began, till well after\r\n10, when they ended, there was a rain like Noah's; rain falling as from\r\nbuckets and water-spouts; and that Friedrich (and perhaps most others\r\ntoo), so intent upon his business, paid not the least regard to it;\r\nbut rode about, intensely inspecting, in lynx-eyed watchfulness of\r\neverything, as if no rain had been there. Was not at the pains even to\r\nput on his cloak. Six hours of such down-pour; and a weakly old man\r\nof 73 past. Of course he was wetted to the bone. On returning to\r\nhead-quarters, his boots were found full of water; \"when pulled off, it\r\ncame pouring from them like a pair of pails.\"\r\n\r\nHe got into dry clothes; presided in his usual way at dinner, which soon\r\nfollowed; had many Generals and guests,--Lafayette, Lord Cornwallis,\r\nDuke of York;--and, as might be expected, felt unusually feverish\r\nafterwards. Hot, chill, quite poorly all afternoon; glad to get to\r\nbed:--where he fell into deep sleep, into profuse perspiration, as his\r\nwont was; and awoke, next morning, greatly recovered; altogether well\r\nagain, as he supposed. Well enough to finish his Review comfortably;\r\nand start for home. Went--round by Neisse, inspection not to be omitted\r\nthere, though it doubles the distance--to Brieg that day; a drive of 80\r\nmiles, inspection-work included. Thence, at Breslan for three days more:\r\nwith dinners of state, balls, illuminations, in honor of the Duke\r\nof York,--our as yet last Duke of York, then a brisk young fellow of\r\ntwenty-two; to whom, by accident, among his other distinctions, may\r\nbelong this of having (most involuntarily) helped to kill Friedrich the\r\nGreat!\r\n\r\nBack to Potsdam, Friedrich pushed on with business; and complained\r\nof nothing. Was at Berlin in about ten days (September 9th), for an\r\nArtillery Review; saw his Sister Amelia; saw various public works in a\r\nstate of progress,--but what perhaps is medically significant, went in\r\nthe afternoon to a kind of Spa Well they have at Berlin; and slept,\r\nnot at the Palace, but at this Spa, in the hostelry or lodging-house\r\nattached. [Rodenbeck, IN DIE.] Next day (September 10th), the Artillery\r\nManoeuvre was done; and the King left Berlin,--little guessing he had\r\nseen Berlin for the last time.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, his health, unknown to him (though that of taking a Night\r\nat the Spa Well probably denotes some guess or feeling of the kind\r\non his part), must have been in a dangerous or almost ruinous state.\r\nAccordingly, soon afterwards, September 18th-19th, in the night-time,\r\nhe was suddenly aroused by a Fit of Suffocation (what they call\r\nSTICKFLUSS); and, for some hours, till relief was got, everybody feared\r\nhe would perish. Next day, there came gout; which perhaps he regarded\r\nalmost as a friend: but it did not prove such; it proved the captain\r\nof a chaotic company of enemies; and Friedrich's end, I suppose,\r\nwas already inexorably near. At the Grand Potsdam Review (22d-23d\r\nSeptember), chief Review of all, and with such an affluence of Strangers\r\nto it this Autumn, he was quite unable to appear; prescribed the\r\nManoeuvres and Procedures, and sorrowfully kept his room. [This of 23d\r\nSeptember, 1785, is what Print-Collectors know loosely as \"FRIEDRICH'S\r\nLAST REVIEW;\"--one Cunningham, an English Painter (son of a Jacobite\r\nditto, and himself of wandering habitat), and Clemens, a Prussian\r\nEngraver, having done a very large and highly superior Print of it, by\r\nway of speculation in Military Portraits (Berlin, 1787); in which,\r\namong many others, there figures the crediblest Likeness known to me\r\nof FRIEDRICH IN OLD AGE, though Friedrich himself was not there.\r\n(See PREUSS, iv. 242; especially see RODENBECK, iii. 337 n.)--As\r\nCrown-Prince, Friedrich had SAT to Pesne: never afterwards to any\r\nArtist.]\r\n\r\nFriedrich was always something of a Doctor himself: he had little faith\r\nin professional Doctors, though he liked to speak with the intelligent\r\nsort, and was curious about their science, And it is agreed he really\r\nhad good notions in regard to it; in particular, that he very well\r\nunderstood his own constitution of body; knew the effects of causes\r\nthere, at any rate, and the fit regimens and methods:--as an old man of\r\nsense will usually do. The complaint is, that he was not always faithful\r\nto regimen; that, in his old days at least, he loved strong soups, hot\r\nspicy meats;--finding, I suppose, a kind of stimulant in them, as others\r\ndo in wine; a sudden renewal of strength, which might be very tempting\r\nto him. There has been a great deal of unwise babble on this subject,\r\nwhich I find no reason to believe, except as just said: In the fall of\r\nthis year, as usual, perhaps rather later than usual,--not till November\r\n8th (for what reason so delaying, Marwitz told us already),--he withdrew\r\nfrom Sans-Souci, his Summer-Cottage; shut himself up in Potsdam Palace\r\n(Old Palace) for the winter. It was known he was very ailing; and that\r\nhe never stirred out,--but this was not quite unusual in late winters;\r\nand the rumors about his health were vague and various. Now, as always,\r\nhe himself, except to his Doctors, was silent on that subject. Various\r\nmilitary Doctors, Theden, Frese and others of eminence, were within\r\nreach; but it is not known to me that he consulted any of them.\r\n\r\nNot till January, 1786, when symptoms worse than ever, of asthma, of\r\ndropsy, began to manifest themselves, did he call in Selle, the chief\r\nBerlin Doctor, and a man of real sagacity, as is still evident; who from\r\nthe first concluded the disease to be desperate; but of course began\r\nsome alleviatory treatment, the skilfulest possible to him. [Christian\r\nGottlieb Selle, KRANKHEITSGESCHICHTE DES HOCHSTSEELIGEN KONIGS VAN\r\nPREUSSEN FRIEDRICHS DES ZWEYTEN MAJESTAT (Berlin, 1786); a very small\r\nPamphlet, now very rare;--giving in the most distinct, intelligent,\r\nmodest and conclusive way, an account of everything pertinent, and\r\nrigorously of nothing else.] Selle, when questioned, kept his\r\nworst fears carefully to himself: but the King noticed Selle's real\r\nopinion,--which, probably, was the King's own too;--and finding little\r\nactual alleviation, a good deal of trouble, and no possibility of a\r\nvictorious result by this warfare on the outworks, began to be weary of\r\nSelle; and to turn his hopes--what hopes he yet had--on the fine weather\r\nsoon due. He had a continual short small cough, which much troubled him;\r\nthere was fear of new Suffocation-Fit; the breathing always difficult.\r\n\r\nBut Spring came, unusually mild; the King sat on the southern balconies\r\nin the genial sun and air, looking over the bright sky and earth, and\r\nnew birth of things: \"Were I at Sans-Souci, amid the Gardens!\" thought\r\nhe. APRIL 17th, he shifted thither: not in a sedan, as Marwitz told us\r\nof the former journey; but \"in his carriage, very early in the\r\nmorning, making a long roundabout through various Villages, with\r\nnew relays,\"--probably with the motive Marwitz assigns. Here are two\r\ncontemporaneous Excerpts:--\r\n\r\n1. MIRABEAU AT SANS-SOUCI. \"This same day,\" April 17th, it appears,\r\n[Preuss: in _OEuvres de Frederic,_ xxv. 328 n.] \"the King saw Mirabeau,\r\nfor the second and last time. Mirabeau had come to Berlin 19th January\r\nlast; his errand not very precise,--except that he infinitely wanted\r\nemployment, and that at Paris the Controller-General Calonne, since so\r\nfamous among mankind, had evidently none to offer him there. He seems to\r\nhave intended Russia, and employment with the Czarina,--after viewing\r\nBerlin a little, with the great flashy eyesight he had. He first saw\r\nFriedrich January 25th. There pass in all, between Friedrich and him,\r\nseven Letters or Notes, two of them by the King; and on poor Mirabeau's\r\nside, it must be owned, there is a massively respectful, truthful and\r\nmanly physiognomy, which probably has mended Friedrich's first opinion\r\nof him. [... \"Is coming to me to-day; one of those loose-tongued\r\nfellows, I suppose, who write for and against all the world.\" (Friedrich\r\nto Prince Henri, \"25 January, 1786:\" _OEuvres de Frederic,_ xxvi. 522.)]\r\nThis day, April 17th, 1786, he is at Potsdam; so far on the road to\r\nFrance again,--Mirabeau Senior being reported dangerously ill. 'My\r\nDialogue with the King,' say the Mirabeau Papers, 'was very lively; but\r\nthe King was in such suffering, and so straitened for breath, I was\r\nmyself anxious to shorten it: that same evening I travelled on.'\r\n\r\n\"Mirabeau Senior did not die at this time: and Controller-General\r\nCalonne, now again eager to shake off an importunate and far too\r\nclear-sighted Mirabeau Junior, said to the latter: 'Back to Berlin,\r\ncould n't you? Their King is dying, a new King coming; highly important\r\nto us!'--and poor Mirabeau went. Left Paris again, in May; with money\r\nfurnished, but, no other outfit, and more in the character of Newspaper\r\nVulture than of Diplomatic Envoy,\" [Rodenbeck, iii. 343. Fils Adoptif,\r\n_Memoires de Mirabeau_ (Paris, 1834), iv. 288-292, 296.] as perhaps we\r\nmay transiently see.\r\n\r\n2. MARIE ANTOINETTE AT VERSAILLES; TO HER SISTER CHRISTINE AT BRUSSELS\r\n(Husband and she, Duke and Duchess of Sachsen-Teschen, are Governors of\r\nthe Netherlands):--\r\n\r\nMARCH 20th, 1786.... \"There has been arrested at Geneva one Villette,\r\nwho played a great part in that abominable Affair [of the Diamond\r\nNecklace, now emerging on an astonished Queen and world]. [Carlyle's\r\n_Miscellanies_ (Library Edition), v. 3-96,? DIAMOND NECKLACE. The\r\nwretched Cardinal de Rohan was arrested at Versailles, and put in the\r\nBastille, \"August 15th, 1785,\" the day before Friedrich set out for\r\nhis Silesian Review; ever since which, the arrestments and judicial\r\ninvestigations have continued,--continue till \"May 10th, 1786,\" when\r\nSentence was given.] M. Target\", Advocate of the enchanted Cardinal, \"is\r\ncoming out with his MEMOIR: he does his function; and God knows what are\r\nthe lies he will produce upon us. There is a MEMOIR by that Quack of a\r\nCagliostro, too: these are at this moment the theme of all talk.\"\r\n\r\nAPRIL 6th. \"The MEMOIRS, the lies, succeed each other; and the Business\r\ngrows darker, not clearer. Such a Cardinal of the Church! He brazenly\r\nmaintains his distracted story about the Bosquet [Interview with me in\r\nperson, in that Hornbeam Arbor at Versailles; to me inconceivable, not\r\nyet knowing of a Demoiselle d'Oliva from the streets, who had acted\r\nmy part there], and my Assent [to purchase the Necklace for me]. His\r\nimpudence and his audacity surpass belief. O Sister, I need all my\r\nstrength to support such cruel assaults.... The King of Prussia's\r\ncondition much engages attention (PREOCCUPE) here, and must do at Vienna\r\ntoo: his death is considered imminent.

He is better at this moment; but so weak he cannot resist long.\r\nPhysique is gone; but his force and energy of soul, they say, have often\r\nsupported him, and in desperate crises have even seemed to increase.\r\nLiking to him I never had: his ostentatious immorality (IMMORALITE\r\nAFFICHEE,\" ah, Madame!) \"has much hurt public virtue [public\r\northodoxy, I mean], and there have been related to me [by mendacious or\r\nill-informed persons] barbarities which excite horror. He has done us\r\nall a great deal of ill. He has been a King for his own Country; but\r\na Trouble-feast for those about him;--setting up to be the arbiter of\r\nEurope; always undertaking on his neighbors, and making them pay the\r\nexpense. As Daughters of Maria Theresa, it is impossible we can regret\r\nhim, nor is it the Court of France that will make his funeral oration.\"\r\n[Comte de Hunolstein, _Correspondance inedite de Marie Antoinette_\r\n(Paris, 1864), pp. 136, 137, 149.--Hunolstein's Book, I since find, is\r\nmainly or wholly a Forgery! (NOTE of 1868.)]\r\n\r\nFrom Sans-Souci the King did appear again on horseback; rode out several\r\ntimes (\"Conde,\" a fine English horse, one of his favorites, carrying\r\nhim,--the Conde who had many years of sinecure afterwards, and was well\r\nknown to Touring people): the rides were short; once to the New Palace\r\nto look at some new Vinery there, thence to the Gate of Potsdam,\r\nwhich he was for entering; but finding masons at work, and the street\r\nencumbered, did not, and rode home instead: this, of not above two\r\nmiles, was his longest ride of all. Selle's attendance, less and less in\r\nesteem with the King, and less and less followed by him, did not quite\r\ncease till June 4th; that day the King had said to Selle, or to himself,\r\n\"It is enough.\" That longest of his rides was in the third week after;\r\nJune 22d, Midsummer-Day. July 4th, he rode again; and it was for the\r\nlast time. About two weeks after, Conde was again brought out; but it\r\nwould not do: Adieu, my Conde; not possible, as things are!--\r\n\r\nDuring all this while, and to the very end, Friedrich's Affairs, great\r\nand small, were, in every branch and item, guided on by him, with a\r\nperfection not surpassed in his palmiest days: he saw his Ministers, saw\r\nall who had business with him, many who had little; and in the sore coil\r\nof bodily miseries, as Hertzberg observed with wonder, never was the\r\nKing's intellect clearer, or his judgment more just and decisive. Of his\r\ndisease, except to the Doctors, he spoke no word to anybody. The body\r\nof Friedrich is a ruin, but his soul is still here; and receives his\r\nfriends and his tasks as formerly. Asthma, dropsy, erysipelas, continual\r\nwant of sleep; for many months past he has not been in bed, but sits day\r\nand night in an easy-chair, unable to get breath except in that posture.\r\nHe said one morning, to somebody entering, \"If you happened to want a\r\nnight-watcher, I could suit you well.\"\r\n\r\nHis multifarious Military businesses come first; then his three Clerks,\r\nwith the Civil and Political. These three he latterly, instead of\r\ncalling about 6 or 7 o'clock, has had to appoint for 4 each morning:\r\n\"My situation forces me,\" his message said, \"to give them this trouble,\r\nwhich they will not have to suffer long. My life is on the decline; the\r\ntime which I still have I must employ. It belongs not to me, but to\r\nthe State.\" [Preuss, iv. 257 n.] About 11, business, followed by short\r\nsurgical details or dressings (sadly insisted on in those Books, and\r\nin themselves sufficiently sad), being all done,--his friends or daily\r\ncompany are admitted: five chiefly, or (NOT counting Minister Hertzberg)\r\nfour, Lucchesini, Schwerin, Pinto, Gortz; who sit with him about one\r\nhour now, and two hours in the evening again:--dreary company to our\r\nminds, perhaps not quite so dreary to the King's; but they are all he\r\nhas left. And he talks cheerfully with them \"on Literature, History,\r\non the topics of the day, or whatever topic rises, as if there were no\r\nsickness here.\" A man adjusted to his hard circumstances; and bearing\r\nhimself manlike and kinglike among them.\r\n\r\nHe well knew himself to be dying; but some think, expected that the end\r\nmight be a little farther off. There is a grand simplicity of stoicism\r\nin him; coming as if by nature, or by long SECOND-nature; finely\r\nunconscious of itself, and finding nothing of peculiar in this new trial\r\nlaid on it. From of old, Life has been infinitely contemptible to him.\r\nIn death, I think, he has neither fear nor hope. Atheism, truly, he\r\nnever could abide: to him, as to all of us, it was flatly inconceivable\r\nthat intellect, moral emotion, could have been put into HIM by an Entity\r\nthat had none of its own. But there, pretty much, his Theism seems to\r\nhave stopped. Instinctively, too, he believed, no man more firmly,\r\nthat Right alone has ultimately any strength in this world: ultimately,\r\nyes;--but for him and his poor brief interests, what good was it? Hope\r\nfor himself in Divine Justice, in Divine Providence, I think he had not\r\npractically any; that the unfathomable Demiurgus should concern himself\r\nwith such a set of paltry ill-given animalcules as oneself and mankind\r\nare, this also, as we have often noticed, is in the main incredible to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nA sad Creed, this of the King's;--he had to do his duty without fee or\r\nreward. Yes, reader;--and what is well worth your attention, you will\r\nhave difficulty to find, in the annals of any Creed, a King or man\r\nwho stood more faithfully to his duty; and, till the last hour, alone\r\nconcerned himself with doing that. To poor Friedrich that was all the\r\nLaw and all the Prophets: and I much recommend you to surpass him,\r\nif you, by good luck, have a better Copy of those inestimable\r\nDocuments!--Inarticulate notions, fancies, transient aspirations, he\r\nmight have, in the background of his mind. One day, sitting for a while\r\nout of doors, gazing into the Sun, he was heard to murmur, \"Perhaps I\r\nshall be nearer thee soon:\"--and indeed nobody knows what his thoughts\r\nwere in these final months. There is traceable only a complete\r\nsuperiority to Fear and Hope; in parts, too, are half-glimpses of a\r\ngreat motionless interior lake of Sorrow, sadder than any tears or\r\ncomplainings, which are altogether wanting to it.\r\n\r\nFriedrich's dismissal of Selle, June 4th, by no means meant that he had\r\ngiven up hope from medicine; on the contrary, two days after, he had a\r\nLetter on the road for Zimmermann at Hanover; whom he always remembers\r\nfavorably since that DIALOGUE we read fifteen years ago. His first\r\nNote to Zimmermann is of June 6th, \"Would you consent to come for a\r\nfortnight, and try upon me?\" Zimmermann's overjoyed Answer, \"Yes, thrice\r\nsurely yes,\" is of June 10th; Friedrich's second is of June 16th, \"Come,\r\nthen!\" And Zimmermann came accordingly,--as is still too well known.\r\nArrived 23d June; stayed till 10th July; had Thirty-three Interviews or\r\nDIALOGUES with him; one visit the last day; two, morning and evening,\r\nevery preceding day;--and published a Book about them, which made\r\nimmense noise in the world, and is still read, with little profit\r\nor none, by inquirers into Friedrich. [Ritter von Zimmermann, _Uber\r\nFriedrich den Grossen und meine Unterredungen mit Ihm kurz von seinem\r\nTode_ (1 vol. 8vo: Leipzig, 1788);--followed by _Fragmente uber\r\nFriedrich den Grossen_ (3 vols. 12mo: Leipzig, 1790); and by &c. &c.]\r\nThirty-three Dialogues, throwing no new light on Friedrich, none of them\r\nequal in interest to the old specimen known to us.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the Book turns rather on Zimmermann himself than on his Royal\r\nPatient; and might be entitled, as it was by a Satirist, DIALOGUES\r\nOF ZIMMERMANN I. AND FRIEDRICH II. An unwise Book; abounding in\r\nexaggeration; breaking out continually into extraneous sallies and\r\nextravagancies,--the source of which is too plainly an immense conceit\r\nof oneself. Zimmermann is fifteen years older since we last saw him; a\r\nman now verging towards sixty; but has not grown wiser in proportion.\r\nIn Hanover, though miraculously healed of that LEIBESSCHADE, and full of\r\nhigh hopes, he has had his new tribulations, new compensations,--both\r\nof an agitating character. \"There arose,\" he says, in reference to\r\nsome medical Review-article he wrote, \"a WEIBER-EPIDEMIK, a universal\r\nshrieking combination of all the Women against me:\"--a frightful\r\naccident while it lasted! Then his little Daughter died on his hands;\r\nhis Son had disorders, nervous imbecilities,--did not die, but did\r\nworse; went into hopeless idiotcy, and so lived for many years.\r\nZimmermann, being dreadfully miserable, hypochondriac, what not, \"his\r\nfriends,\" he himself passive, it would seem, \"managed to get a young\r\nWife for him;\" thirty years younger than he,--whose performances,\r\nhowever, in this difficult post, are praised.\r\n\r\nLastly, not many months ago (Leipzig, 1785), the big FINAL edition of\r\n\"SOLITUDE\" (four volumes) has come out; to the joy and enthusiasm of all\r\nphilanthropic-philosophic and other circulating-library creatures:--a\r\nCopy of which came, by course of nature, not by Zimmermann's help, into\r\nthe hands of Catharine of Russia. Sublime imperial Letter thereupon,\r\nwith 'valuable diamond ring;' invitation to come to Petersburg, with\r\ncharges borne (declined, on account of health); to be imperial Physician\r\n(likewise declined);--in fine, continued Correspondence with Catharine\r\n(trying enough for a vain head), and Knighthood of the Order of St.\r\nWladimir,--so that, at least, Doctor Zimmermann is RITTER Zimmermann\r\nhenceforth. And now, here has come his new Visit to Friedrich the\r\nGreat;--which, with the issues it had, and the tempestuous cloud of\r\ntumid speculations and chaotic writings it involved him in, quite upset\r\nthe poor Ritter Doctor; so that, hypochondrias deepening to the abysmal,\r\nhis fine intellect sank altogether,--and only Death, which happily\r\nfollowed soon, could disimprison him. At this moment, there is in\r\nZimmermann a worse \"Dropsy\" of the spiritual kind, than this of the\r\nphysical, which he has come in relief of!\r\n\r\nExcerpts of those Zimmermann DIALOGUES lie copiously round me, ready\r\nlong ago,--nay, I understand there is, or was, an English TRANSLATION of\r\nthe whole of them, better or worse, for behoof of the curious:--but\r\non serious consideration now, I have to decide, That they are but as\r\na Scene of clowns in the Elder Dramatists; which, even were it NOT\r\noverdone as it is, cannot be admitted in this place, and is plainly\r\nimpertinent in the Tragedy that is being acted here. Something of Farce\r\nwill often enough, in this irreverent world, intrude itself on the most\r\nsolemn Tragedy; but, in pity even to the Farce, there ought at least to\r\nbe closed doors kept between them.\r\n\r\nEnough for us to say, That Ritter Zimmermann--who is a Physician and a\r\nMan of Literary Genius, and should not have become a Tragic Zany--did,\r\nwith unspeakable emotions, terrors, prayers to Heaven, and paroxysms\r\nof his own ridiculous kind, prescribe \"Syrup of Dandelion\" to the King;\r\ntalked to him soothingly, musically, successfully; found the King a\r\nmost pleasant Talker, but a very wilful perverse kind of Patient; whose\r\nerrors in point of diet especially were enormous to a degree. Truth is,\r\nthe King's appetite for food did still survive:--and this might have\r\nbeen, you would think, the one hopeful basis of Zimmermann's whole\r\ntreatment, if there were still any hope: but no; Zimmermann merely, with\r\nuncommon emphasis, lyrically recognizes such amazing appetite in an old\r\nman overwhelmed by diseases,--trumpets it abroad, for ignorant persons\r\nto regard as a crime, or perhaps as a type generally of the man's past\r\nlife, and makes no other attempt upon it;--stands by his \"Extract of\r\nDandelion boiled to the consistency of honey;\" and on the seventeenth\r\nday, July 10th, voiceless from emotion, heart just breaking, takes\r\nhimself away, and ceases. One of our Notes says:--\r\n\r\n\"Zimmermann went by Dessau and Brunswick; at Brunswick, if he made speed\r\nthither, Zimmermann might perhaps find Mirabeau, who is still there, and\r\njust leaving for Berlin to be in at the death:--but if the Doctor and\r\nhe missed each other, it was luckier, as they had their controversies\r\nafterwards. Mirabeau arrived at Berlin, July 21st: [Mirabeau, HISTOIRE\r\nSECRETE DE LA COUR DE BERLIN, tome iii. of _OEuvres de Mirabeau:_ Paris,\r\n1821, LETTRE v. p. 37.] vastly diligent in picking up news, opinions,\r\njudgments of men and events, for his Calonne;--and amazingly accurate,\r\none finds; such a flash of insight has he, in whatever element, foul or\r\nfair.\r\n\r\n\"JULY 9th, the day before Zimmerman's departure, Hertzberg had come\r\nout to Potsdam in permanence. Hertzberg is privately thenceforth in\r\ncommunication with the Successor; altogether privately, though no doubt\r\nFriedrich knew it well enough, and saw it to be right. Of course, all\r\nmanner of poor creatures are diligent about their own bits of interests;\r\nand saying to themselves, 'A New Reign is evidently nigh!' Yes,\r\nmy friends;--and a precious Reign it will prove in comparison:\r\nsensualities, unctuous religiosities, ostentations, imbecilities;\r\nculminating in Jena twenty years hence.\"\r\n\r\nZimmermann haggles to tell us what his report was at Brunswick; says, he\r\n\"set the Duke [ERBPRINZ, who is now Duke these six years past] sobbing\r\nand weeping;\" though towards the Widow Duchess there must have been some\r\nhope held out, as we shall now see. The Duchess's Letter or Letters to\r\nher Brother are lost; but this is his Answer:--\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH TO THE DUCHESS-DOWAGER OF BRUNSWICK.\r\n\r\n\"SANS-SOUCI, 10th August, 1786.\r\n\r\n\"MY ADORABLE SISTER,--The Hanover Doctor has wished to make himself\r\nimportant with you, my good Sister; but the truth is, he has been of no\r\nuse to me (M'A ETE INUTILE). The old must give place to the young, that\r\neach generation may find room clear for it: and Life, if we examine\r\nstrictly what its course is, consists in seeing one's fellow-creatures\r\ndie and be born. In the mean while, I have felt myself a little easier\r\nfor the last day or two. My heart remains inviolably attached to you, my\r\ngood Sister. With the highest consideration,--My adorable Sister,--Your\r\nfaithful Brother and Servant, \"FRIEDRICH.\" [_OEuvres de Frederic,_\r\nxxvii. i. 352.]\r\n\r\nThis is Friedrich's last Letter;--his last to a friend. There is one to\r\nhis Queen, which Preuss's Index seems to regard as later, though without\r\napparent likelihood; there being no date whatever, and only these words:\r\n\"Madam,--I am much obliged by the wishes you deign to form: but a\r\nheavy fever I have taken (GROSSE FIEVRE QUE J'AI PRISE) hinders me from\r\nanswering you.\" [Ib. xxvi. 62.]\r\n\r\nOn common current matters of business, and even on uncommon, there\r\ncontinue yet for four days to be Letters expressly dictated by\r\nFriedrich; some about military matters (vacancies to be filled, new\r\nFree-Corps to be levied). Two or three of them are on so small a subject\r\nas the purchase of new Books by his Librarians at Berlin. One, and it\r\nhas been preceded by examining, is, Order to the Potsdam Magistrates to\r\ngrant \"the Baker Schroder, in terms of his petition, a Free-Pass out of\r\nPreussen hither, for 100 bushels of rye and 50 of wheat, though Schroder\r\nwill not find the prices much cheaper there than here.\" His last, of\r\nAugust 14th, is to De Launay, Head of the Excise: \"Your Account of\r\nReceipts and Expenditures came to hand yesterday, 13th; but is too\r\nmuch in small: I require one more detailed,\"--and explains, with brief\r\nclearness, on what points and how. Neglects nothing, great or small,\r\nwhile life yet is.\r\n\r\nTUESDAY, AUGUST 15th, 1786, Contrary to all wont, the King did not\r\nawaken till 11 o'clock. On first looking up, he seemed in a confused\r\nstate, but soon recovered himself; called in his Generals and\r\nSecretaries, who had been in waiting so long, and gave, with his old\r\nprecision, the Orders wanted,--one to Rohdich, Commandant of Potsdam,\r\nabout a Review of the troops there next day; Order minutely perfect,\r\nin knowledge of the ground, in foresight of what and how the evolutions\r\nwere to be; which was accordingly performed on the morrow. The Cabinet\r\nwork he went through with the like possession of himself, giving, on\r\nevery point, his Three Clerks their directions, in a weak voice, yet\r\nwith the old power of spirit,--dictated to one of them, among other\r\nthings, an \"Instruction\" for some Ambassador just leaving; \"four quarto\r\npages, which,\" says Hertzberg, \"would have done honor to the most\r\nexperienced Minister;\" and, in the evening, he signed his Missives as\r\nusual. This evening still,--but--no evening more. We are now at the last\r\nscene of all, which ends this strange eventful History.\r\n\r\nWednesday morning, General-Adjutants, Secretaries, Commandant, were\r\nthere at their old hours; but word came out, \"Secretaries are to wait:\"\r\nKing is in a kind of sleep, of stertorous ominous character, as if it\r\nwere the death-sleep; seems not to recollect himself, when he does\r\nat intervals open his eyes. After hours of this, [Selle (ut sup.);\r\nAnonymous (Kletschke), LETZTE STUNDEN UND LEICHENBEGANGNISS FRIEDRICHS\r\nDES ZWEYTEN, (Potsdam, 1786); Preuss, iv. 264 et seq.; Rodenbeck, iii.\r\n363-366.] on a ray of consciousness, the King bethought him of Rohdich,\r\nthe Commandant; tried to give Rohdich the Parole as usual; tried twice,\r\nperhaps three times; but found he could not speak;--and with a glance of\r\nsorrow, which seemed to say, \"It is impossible, then!\" turned his head,\r\nand sank back into the corner of his chair. Rohdich burst into tears:\r\nthe King again lay slumberous;--the rattle of death beginning soon\r\nafter, which lasted at intervals all day. Selle, in Berlin, was sent\r\nfor by express; he arrived about three of the afternoon: King seemed a\r\nlittle more conscious, knew those about him, \"his face red rather than\r\npale, in his eyes still something of their old fire.\" Towards evening\r\nthe feverishness abated (to Selle, I suppose, a fatal symptom); the\r\nKing fell into a soft sleep, with warm perspiration; but, on awakening,\r\ncomplained of cold, repeatedly of cold, demanding wrappage after\r\nwrappage (\"KISSEN,\" soft QUILT of the old fashion);--and on examining\r\nfeet and legs, one of the Doctors made signs that they were in fact\r\ncold, up nearly to the knee. \"What said he of the feet?\" murmured the\r\nKing some time afterwards, the Doctor having now stepped out of sight.\r\n\"Much the same as before,\" answered some attendant. The King shook his\r\nhead, incredulous.\r\n\r\nHe drank once, grasping the goblet with both hands, a draught of\r\nfennel-water, his customary drink; and seemed relieved by it;--his last\r\nrefection in this world. Towards nine in the evening, there had come on\r\na continual short cough, and a rattling in the breast, breath more and\r\nmore difficult. Why continue? Friedrich is making exit, on the common\r\nterms; you may HEAR the curtain rustling down. For most part he was\r\nunconscious, never more than half conscious. As the wall-clock above his\r\nhead struck 11, he asked: \"What o'clock?\" \"Eleven,\" answered they. \"At\r\n4\" murmured he, \"I will rise.\" One of his dogs sat on its Stool near\r\nhim; about midnight he noticed it shivering for cold: \"Throw a quilt\r\nover it,\" said or beckoned he; that, I think, was his last completely\r\nconscious utterance. Afterwards, in a severe choking fit, getting at\r\nlast rid of the phlegm, he said, \"LA MONTAGNE EST PASSEE, NOUS IRONS\r\nMIEUX, We are over the hill, we shall go better now.\"\r\n\r\nAttendants, Hertzberg, Selle and one or two others, were in the outer\r\nroom; none in Friedrich's but Strutzki, his Kammerhussar, one of Three\r\nwho are his sole valets and nurses; a faithful ingenious man, as they\r\nall seem to be, and excellently chosen for the object. Strutzki, to save\r\nthe King from hustling down, as he always did, into the corner of\r\nhis chair, where, with neck and chest bent forward, breathing was\r\nimpossible,--at last took the King on his knee; kneeling on the ground\r\nwith his other knee for the purpose,--King's right arm round Strutzki's\r\nneck, Strutzki's left arm round the King's back, and supporting his\r\nother shoulder; in which posture the faithful creature, for above two\r\nhours, sat motionless, till the end came. Within doors, all is silence,\r\nexcept this breathing; around it the dark earth silent, above it the\r\nsilent stars. At 20 minutes past 2, the breathing paused,--wavered;\r\nceased. Friedrich's Life-battle is fought out; instead of suffering and\r\nsore labor, here is now rest. Thursday morning, 17th August, 1786, at\r\nthe dark hour just named. On the 31st of May last, this King had reigned\r\n46 years. \"He has lived,\" counts Rodenbeck, \"74 years, 6 months and 24\r\ndays.\"\r\n\r\nHis death seems very stern and lonely;--a man of such affectionate\r\nfeelings, too; \"a man with more sensibility than other men!\" But so had\r\nhis whole life been, stern and lonely; such the severe law laid on him.\r\nNor was it inappropriate that he found his death in that poor Silesian\r\nReview; punctually doing, as usual, the work that had come in hand. Nor\r\nthat he died now, rather than a few years later. In these final days\r\nof his, we have transiently noticed Arch-Cardinal de Rohan, Arch-Quack\r\nCagliostro, and a most select Company of Persons and of Actions, like an\r\nElixir of the Nether World, miraculously emerging into daylight; and all\r\nParis, and by degrees all Europe, getting loud with the DIAMOND-NECKLACE\r\nHistory. And to eyes of deeper speculation,--World-Poet Goethe's, for\r\ninstance,--it is becoming evident that Chaos is again big. As has not\r\nshe proved to be, and is still proving, in the most teeming way! Better\r\nfor a Royal Hero, fallen old and feeble, to be hidden from such things.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday, Wednesday, August 16th,\" says a Note which now strikes us\r\nas curious, \"Mirabeau, smelling eagerly for news, had ridden out towards\r\nPotsdam; met the Page riding furiously for Selle ('one horse already\r\nbroken down,' say the Peasants about); and with beak, powerful beyond\r\nany other vulture's, Mirabeau perceived that here the end now was. And\r\nthereupon rushed off, to make arrangements for a courier, for flying\r\npigeons, and the other requisites. And appeared that night at the\r\nQueen's Soiree in Schonhausen [Queen has Apartment that evening,\r\ndreaming of nothing], 'where,' says he, 'I eagerly whispered the French\r\nMinister,' and less eagerly 'MON AMI Mylord Dalrymple,' the English\r\none;--neither of whom would believe me. Nor, in short, what Calonne will\r\nregret, but nobody else, could the pigeons be let loose, owing to\r\nwant of funds.'\" [Mirabeau, HISTOIRE SECRETE, &c. (LETTRE xiv.), pp.\r\n58-63.]--Enough, enough.\r\n\r\nFriedrich was not buried at Sans-Souci, in the Tomb which he had built\r\nfor himself; why not, nobody clearly says. By his own express will,\r\nthere was no embalming. Two Regiment-surgeons washed the Corpse,\r\ndecently prepared it for interment: \"At 8 that same evening, Friedrich's\r\nBody, dressed in the uniform of the First Battalion of Guards, and laid\r\nin its coffin, was borne to Potsdam, in a hearse of eight horses, twelve\r\nNon-commissioned Officers of the Guard escorting. All Potsdam was in the\r\nstreets; the Soldiers, of their own accord, formed rank, and followed\r\nthe hearse; many a rugged face unable to restrain tears: for the rest,\r\nuniversal silence as of midnight, nothing audible among the people but\r\nhere and there a sob, and the murmur, 'ACH, DER GUTE KONIG!'\r\n\r\n\"All next day, the Body lay in state in the Palace; thousands crowding,\r\nfrom Berlin and the other environs, to see that face for the last time.\r\nWasted, worn; but beautiful in death, with the thin gray hair parted\r\ninto locks, and slightly powdered. And at 8 in the evening [Friday,\r\n18th], he was borne to the Garnison-Kirche of Potsdam; and laid beside\r\nhis Father, in the vault behind the Pulpit there,\" [Rodenbeck, iii. 365\r\n(Public Funeral was not till September 9th).] where the two Coffins are\r\nstill to be seen.\r\n\r\nI define him to myself as hitherto the Last of the Kings;--when the\r\nNext will be, is a very long question! But it seems to me as if Nations,\r\nprobably all Nations, by and by, in their despair,--blinded, swallowed\r\nlike Jonah, in such a whale's-belly of things brutish, waste, abominable\r\n(for is not Anarchy, or the Rule of what is Baser over what is\r\nNobler, the one life's misery worth complaining of, and, in fact, the\r\nabomination of abominations, springing from and producing all others\r\nwhatsoever?)--as if the Nations universally, and England too if it hold\r\non, may more and more bethink themselves of such a Man and his Function\r\nand Performance, with feelings far other than are possible at present.\r\nMeanwhile, all I had to say of him is finished: that too, it seems,\r\nwas a bit of work appointed to be done. Adieu, good readers; bad also,\r\nadieu.",
