Beethoven\r\ninvokes all manner of blessings on the head of his pupil and patron\r\nand, begging a continuance of gracious benevolences for himself, sets\r\nforth a picture of his unhappy plight.\r\n\r\n    A terrible occurrence has recently taken place in my family affairs\r\n    which for a time robbed me of all my reasoning powers; and to this\r\n    must be charged the circumstance that I have not called upon Y.\r\n    R. H. in person nor made mention of the masterly Variations of my\r\n    highly honored and exalted pupil, the favorite of the Muses. I do\r\n    not dare to express either by word of mouth or in writing my thanks\r\n    for the surprise and favor with which I have been honored, inasmuch\r\n    as I occupy _much too humble_ a position, nor dare I, much as I\r\n    would like and ardently as I long to do so, _requite like with\r\n    like_.\r\n\r\nA little boy of eleven years runs away from his uncle to his indulgent\r\nmother whom he, for months at a time, has not been allowed to see,\r\nalthough both live within the same city limits. What else could be\r\nexpected than that this should now and then occur? What should be\r\nthought of the child’s heart if it did not? And when it did, who but\r\nBeethoven would have felt more than a passing disturbance of his\r\nequanimity at an offense so natural under the circumstances? But to\r\nhim it was a “terrible occurrence” which for a space robbed him of his\r\nreason. No one of ordinary sensibilities can read the story without\r\nstrong feelings of compassion for him--not that the boy’s freak was\r\nin any sense in itself a grievous misfortune, but because the uncle’s\r\nsufferings occasioned by it were so real and intense.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to doubt the mother’s assertion that she sent\r\nthe child back through the intervention of the police, for this was\r\nclearly her best policy, more especially because she and her advisers\r\nfound in the incident a wished-for occasion to renew her petition to\r\nhave her son admitted into the R. I. Convict. It was this petition,\r\nenforced by Hotschevar’s long paper and its accompanying documents,\r\nwhich had led to the question of Beethoven’s right to have his case\r\ntried by the tribunal of the nobility, and the negative decision which\r\ntransferred the whole matter to the City Magistracy. At this point a\r\nfew official data are wanting, and the suspension of Beethoven from the\r\nguardianship of his nephew can only be stated as having been determined\r\nby the magistrates immediately after the beginning of the new year,\r\nand that, in consequence of this, the boy was for a few weeks with his\r\nmother. On January 10, Fanny Giannatasio writes in her diary: “What\r\nMüller tells me about Beethoven pains me deeply. The wicked woman has\r\nfinally succeeded in triumphing over him. He has been removed from\r\nthe guardianship[1] and the wicked son returns to the source of his\r\nwickedness. I can imagine Beethoven’s grief. It is said that since\r\nyesterday he has been entirely alone and eats apart from the others. He\r\nought to know that Karl is glad to be with his mother; it would ease\r\nthe pain of the separation.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEETHOVEN’S APPEAL TO THE MAGISTRACY]\r\n\r\nOn January 7 the magistrates summoned Beethoven (who still lived in\r\nthe Gärtnergasse), the boy, the mother, Hotschevar and the curator,\r\nDr. Schönauer, to appear before them on January 11. Of what action was\r\ntaken that day there is no record, but Hotschevar’s attack brought\r\nout a vigorous defense in the shape of a letter sent by Beethoven\r\nto the Magistracy,[2] in which he maintained the superiority of the\r\neducational plan which he was pursuing over that which had been\r\nproposed by the mother, proclaimed the magnanimity and virtuousness of\r\nall his acts and discharged a broadside of accusation and insinuation\r\nagainst Madame van Beethoven and the priest who had come to her help.\r\nWe can make room for only a few passages:\r\n\r\n    His exceptional capacity, and partly also his peculiarities,\r\n    call for exceptional measures; and I never did a more beneficial\r\n    or magnanimous act than when I took my nephew to myself and\r\n    personally assumed charge of his education. Seeing that (according\r\n    to Plutarch) a Philip did not think it beneath his dignity to\r\n    direct the education of his son Alexander and give him the great\r\n    Aristotle for a teacher because he did not consider the ordinary\r\n    teachers suitable, and a Laudon looked after the education of\r\n    his son _himself_, why should not such beautiful and sublime\r\n    examples be followed by others? Already during his lifetime his\r\n    father entrusted my nephew to me and I confess that I feel myself\r\n    better fitted than anybody else _to incite my nephew to virtue and\r\n    industry by my own example_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Had the mother been able to subdue her wicked disposition and\r\n    permitted my plans to take their quiet development a very favorable\r\n    result would have followed; but when a _mother of this sort_ seeks\r\n    to involve her child in the secrets of her own vulgar and evil\r\n    surroundings, and in his tender years (a plague for children!!!)\r\n    leads aim astray to deception, to bribery of my servants, to\r\n    _untruthfulness_, by _laughing at him_ when he tells the truth,\r\n    yes, even _giving him money_ to awaken in him lusts and desires\r\n    which are harmful, tells him that things are trifles which _in me\r\n    and others would be accounted_ grave faults, the already difficult\r\n    task becomes more difficult and dangerous.\r\n\r\n    Gifts of fortune may be acquired; morality must be _implanted_\r\n    early, particularly when a child has had the misfortune to suck\r\n    in such _mother’s milk_, was in her care for several years, was\r\n    put to thoroughly bad uses, even had to help _deceive_ his father.\r\n    Furthermore he will _inherit from me_ and even now I could leave\r\n    him enough to _keep him from want_ while continuing his studies\r\n    until he should receive an appointment. We need only _quiet and no\r\n    more interference_ from the mother, and the beautiful goal which I\r\n    have set will be attained.\r\n\r\n    Ought I now to reply to the intrigues of a Mr. Courtscrivener\r\n    Hotschowa [Hotschevar] against me, or to the _priest of Mödling_,\r\n    who is despised by his congregation, who is suspected of being\r\n    guilty of _illicit intercourse_, who lays his pupils military\r\n    fashion on a form to be thrashed and could not forgive me because I\r\n    kept watch on him and would not permit my nephew to be caned like a\r\n    _brute_--ought I? No; the association of these men with Madame van\r\n    Beethoven _bears witness_ against them both, and _only such_ could\r\n    make _common cause_ with Madame van Beethoven _against me_.\r\n\r\nBeethoven accompanied this address with a private letter presumably to\r\nDr. Tschiska (or Tschischka), an official of the Magistracy, in which\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n    I am not a guardian from self-interest, but I want to rear a new\r\n    monument to myself in my nephew. I do not need my nephew, but he\r\n    needs me. Gossip, calumny, are beneath the dignity of a man who is\r\n    raising himself up! What is to be done when they even touch the\r\n    laundry!?!? I might be very sensitive, but the just man must be\r\n    able to endure injustice without departing an iota from the right.\r\n    In this sense I shall endure every trial, nothing shall shake\r\n    my resolution. A great responsibility would be incurred were my\r\n    nephew to be wholly withdrawn from me; moral and even political\r\n    consequences would follow to him. I commend him to you and appeal\r\n    to your heart for his welfare. My actions must commend me for his\r\n    sake, not mine.\r\n\r\nWe do not know the particulars, but for the present Beethoven retained\r\nthe right to look after the further education of the boy; the right, at\r\nleast, was not judicially taken away from him or given to another. He\r\ndid not send him again to a public school, but engaged a private tutor\r\nunder whose care he continued his studies in an institute conducted by\r\nJoseph Kudlich, of whom he spoke in great praise. Besides the ordinary\r\nsubjects, he received instruction in French, drawing and music; his\r\nreligious training was entrusted to a priest. This state of affairs\r\nlasted till the end of March, when he announced a desire to resign the\r\nguardianship--persuaded to take this step, it is fair to presume, by\r\nthe magistrates who, in the end, would have been obliged to remove him.\r\nKarl was living with his mother at the time. According to the court\r\nrecords, Beethoven left the matter of education “entirely to Kudlich,”\r\nwith whom (if a passage in one of the Conversation Books is read\r\ncorrectly) he seems also to have lived temporarily, and it was given\r\nto him to propose the name of a guardian, either in place of himself\r\nor as an associate. He consulted earnestly with his friends as to what\r\nwas to be done with the boy and who should be his guardian, and those\r\nfriends were sorely tried by his constitutional indecision. In these\r\nconsultations, the project of sending the boy away from Vienna, and\r\nthe name of Sailer, were mooted.[3] “What must be done,” Bernard says,\r\n“is to select as guardian a man who has your entire confidence both as\r\nrespects morality and pedagogical skill, and with whom you may always\r\nremain on friendly terms concerning the affair. Since Kudlich has more\r\ninfluence on Karl than Giannatasio, it is my opinion that you seek no\r\nfurther for someone who would meet every requirement.--It would merely\r\nbe very troublesome for you.” Beethoven seems to be in doubt; he had a\r\npreference for his friend the magisterial Councillor Tuscher, and the\r\nproject of sending him to Sailer in Landshut appealed to him. Bernard\r\nsays again: “If you want peace of mind I think it wise that you name a\r\nguardian as you were willing to do yesterday. But if it is possible to\r\nsend the boy to Sailer at Landshut,[4] it would, of course, be better\r\nstill, since then you could feel assured that he was in the best of\r\nhands. Even if you have Tuscher as co-guardian, your case will not be\r\nbettered, inasmuch as all cares will still rest on you. Perhaps Tuscher\r\nand Kudlich might jointly assume the guardianship--this might be very\r\nadvantageous. All the same, everything will remain as heretofore, even\r\nif you send him away he will remain with Kudlich until a change has\r\nbeen made. So long as you are guardian and Karl remains here, you will\r\nnot only have all the cares as heretofore, but also be compelled to\r\nfight the mother and all her intrigues. Have Karl sent for the present\r\nagain to Kudlich, meanwhile the matter may be straightened out.”[5]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A NEW GUARDIAN FOR KARL APPOINTED]\r\n\r\nBeethoven seems to have expressed a doubt as to Tuscher’s willingness\r\nto serve as guardian. Bernard continues: “Perhaps he might be more\r\neasily persuaded if a co-guardian like Kudlich were appointed.--It is\r\nnot necessary to settle everything by to-morrow. If we go to Omeyer\r\nto-morrow morning, then to Tuscher and Kudlich, we can come to an\r\nunderstanding as to what will be the best thing to do.” Tuscher, if\r\nwe are correct in recognizing his handwriting, permitted himself to\r\nbe persuaded, though a bit under protest; he foresaw difficulties.\r\nThe Magistracy at the suggestion of Beethoven thereupon appointed\r\nthe Magisterial Councillor Matthias von Tuscher guardian of the boy\r\non March 26. He was commanded to place his ward, then “living with\r\nhis mother, Johanna van Beethoven,” in another place for bringing\r\nup and education under proper care, and submit his opinion touching\r\nthe proposition of the mother and Hotschevar that he be entered in a\r\npublic institute of learning before the expiration of the second school\r\nsemester, that Beethoven contribute to the cost and that the share of\r\nthe mother’s pension and the interest on the money deposited for the\r\nboy be applied to this end. Tuscher was decidedly of the opinion that\r\nthe boy must be sent away for a time and was agreed with the plan of\r\nplacing him with Prof. Sailer in Landshut after it had been broached to\r\nhim. For this the consent of the Magistracy and the police authorities\r\nand a passport were necessary. In the opinion of one of Beethoven’s\r\nadvisers (Bach) Tuscher was to be informed of the plan only after the\r\npassport had been obtained, but before the mother, who had already\r\nfound “a channel,” could take steps to communicate with Tuscher.\r\nBeethoven applied to the city authorities for a passport for two years\r\nfor his ward. On April 23, the authorities asked of the Magistracy\r\nif there were any objections to the proposed step. The Magistracy\r\nobjected to the boy’s being sent into a foreign country, but asked\r\nTuscher if he were not willing to withdraw his application and name an\r\ninstitute in Austria. Tuscher declined and set forth the great hopes\r\nwhich he placed in the training to be had of a man like Sailer, who,\r\n“because of his reverence for the talents of the composer, Beethoven,\r\nwas especially bound to him,” and hence would bestow upon his charge\r\nthe strictest oversight and care, which was of great importance in the\r\ncase of a boy who was “extremely cunning and an adept in every sort of\r\ncraftiness.” In replying to the municipal authorities the Magistracy\r\n(on May 7) conceded the necessity of withdrawing the boy from his\r\nmother’s influence, but thought it unnecessary to send him out of the\r\ncountry on this account, against which the mother had protested and the\r\ncurator of the ward, Dr. Schönauer, had declared himself. The passport\r\nwas therefore refused. Beethoven had taken a step which seems to have\r\nbeen made to prevent the widow from securing help for her plans from\r\na source higher than any that had yet been invoked and to enlist that\r\nhigher power in his own behalf. He appealed to Archduke Rudolph to use\r\nhis influence with Archduke Ludwig, the youngest brother of Emperor\r\nFranz I, to aid him in his project of sending his nephew far away from\r\nthe mother’s influence. In the letter written to the Archduke[6] he\r\nstates that it had been his intention to petition Archduke Ludwig in\r\nthe premises, but there had thitherto appeared to be no occasion for\r\nso doing for the reason that all the authorities who had jurisdiction\r\nin the matter were convinced of the advisability of the step, viz.:\r\nthe Police, the Supervisory Guardianship Court and the guardian. He\r\nhad heard, however, that the mother intended to seek an audience of\r\nArchduke Ludwig to prevent the execution of his plan. Convinced that\r\nshe would stop at nothing in the way of calumination, he expressed the\r\nhope that his reputation for morality would suffice as a refutation of\r\nher slanders, and that Archduke Rudolph would bear testimony in his\r\nbehalf.\r\n\r\nThe plan to send the nephew out of the country had been frustrated\r\nand had to be abandoned. His mind being filled with artistic projects\r\nof the greatest magnitude, Beethoven was desirous to pass the summer\r\nmonths again in Mödling, and after the experiences of the preceding\r\nyear nothing could be hoped for his nephew in that quarter. He came\r\nto a realization of the advantages which Giannatasio’s institute had\r\noffered and in a letter to Giannatasio asked him again to take the lad\r\ntill other arrangements had been made. The Giannatasio family were\r\nfearful lest such a proceeding might work harm to their institution,\r\nand on June 17 visited Beethoven at Mödling to tell him that his wishes\r\ncould not be complied with. “Grievously as it pained us,” Fanny writes\r\nin her diary, “to refuse Beethoven anything, I am yet so convinced of\r\nthe necessity of the step and that it could do us no good, but on the\r\ncontrary harm, that I prefer to have it so.” Thereupon the lad was\r\nsent to the institute of Joseph Blöchlinger. Claudius Artaria, who was\r\none of the teachers there (1821-1824), recalled in later years that\r\nKarl was one of the older scholars, “naturally talented, but somewhat\r\nconceited because he was the nephew of Beethoven.” He also saw the\r\nmother there a few times, but remembered nothing in particular in\r\nconnection with her visits. The lad appears to have prospered during\r\nthe early part of his stay at this school. In December, 1819, an\r\nunknown hand writes in a Conversation Book:\r\n\r\n    A great deal has been gained in that the boy has again become\r\n    orderly in his public studies. Plöchlinger [_sic_] moreover, though\r\n    not exactly brilliant, seems to be good--the public school system\r\n    acts as a restraint on him.--Your nephew looks well; handsome\r\n    eyes--charm, a speaking physiognomy, and excellent bearing. I would\r\n    continue his education for only two years more.--He is always\r\n    present, and thus she can do him no harm. But he is agreed that she\r\n    spoils the boy.--When you have acquired the sole guardianship, then\r\n    do you decide and he will obey.--Your views are admirable but not\r\n    always reconcilable with this wretched world.--Would that everybody\r\n    might understand and appreciate your love for your nephew.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TUSCHER RELIEVED OF THE GUARDIANSHIP]\r\n\r\nTuscher, a member of the Magistracy, was compelled to recognize that\r\nhis colleagues were wholly under the influence of Madame van Beethoven\r\nand Hotschevar, and that he could do no service to his friend or his\r\nfriend’s ward; on July 5, he applied to be relieved of the guardianship\r\nwhich, he said, had become “in every respect burdensome and vexatious,”\r\non the ground that “the multiplicity of official duties as well as\r\nvarious other considerations would not permit him longer to administer\r\nthe office.” Beethoven took this action in very bad part, and Tuscher\r\nshared the fate of many others of being for a space an object of the\r\ncomposer’s critical ill will. Beethoven now served notice on the\r\nMagistracy that he would resume the guardianship under the testamentary\r\nappointment and that he had placed his ward in Blöchlinger’s\r\ninstitution. On July 15 he writes to Archduke Rudolph, lamenting that\r\nconfusion still reigns in his domestic affairs, no hope or comfort is\r\nin sight, all his structures are blown away, as if by the wind. “The\r\npresent proprietor of the institute in which I have placed my nephew,\r\na pupil of Pestalozzi, is of the opinion that it will be difficult\r\nto achieve a desirable outcome in the boy’s training--and also that\r\nthere could be nothing more profitable to my nephew than absence from\r\nthe country.” In a letter of September 14 to Blöchlinger he writes:\r\n“_Only the following individuals have free access to my nephew, Mr. v.\r\nBernard, Mr. v. Oliva, Mr. v. Piuk, Recording Secretary.... My nephew\r\nis not to go out of the house without my written permission_--from\r\nwhich it is plain what course is to be followed toward the mother--I\r\ninsist that in this respect _strict obedience_ be given to what the\r\nauthorities and I have ordained.”\r\n\r\nIt is not known whether the Magistracy was immediately informed\r\nof the new steps which Beethoven had taken, or whether Madame van\r\nBeethoven made a presentment of some sort on the subject. Be that as\r\nit may, as chief guardian it determined if possible to put an end\r\nto the continual friction and undertook an investigation of all the\r\neducational experiments which had been made, arriving at the conclusion\r\nthat the boy had been “subject to the whims of Beethoven and had been\r\ntossed back and forth like a ball from one educational institution to\r\nanother.” For this reason it decreed, on September 17, that Tuscher’s\r\nrequest be granted, but that the guardianship should not again be\r\nentrusted to Beethoven but to the mother, the natural guardian under\r\nthe law, with a capable and honest man as co-guardian. To this office\r\nLeopold Nussböck, municipal Sequestrator, was appointed. Beethoven\r\nprotested against the action in a letter which the Magistracy received\r\non October 31.[7] Having been absent from the city at the time, “on\r\na matter of business,” he had made no objection to the appointment\r\nof Herr Nussböck as guardian of his nephew, but returning with the\r\nintention of remaining in Vienna he wished to resume the guardianship,\r\nas this was essential to the welfare of the boy, the mother having\r\nneither the will nor the strength to look after his training. He was\r\nthe more insistent on a resumption of this duty since he had learned\r\nthat owing to lack of money the boy was to be removed from the\r\ninstitution which he had selected for him, and he charged that the\r\nmother wished to take her son to her home so that she might be able\r\nto expend his income, including the half of her pension which she was\r\nobliged to devote to his education, upon herself. He asked that the\r\nintermediary guardianship be taken from Nussböck and be restored to\r\nhim without delay. About the same time (October 23) he wrote at great\r\nlength to Dr. Bach, who had now become his lawyer.[8] From this it\r\nappears that Madame van Beethoven had addressed another communication\r\nto the Magistrates’ Court, in which she apparently said or intimated\r\nthat Beethoven would, in consequence of the elevation of the Archduke\r\nto the Archbishopric, be obliged to spend the greater part of his time\r\nin Olmütz, and had renewed her attacks upon his moral character. “His\r\nImperial Highness, Eminence and Cardinal” would unhesitatingly bear\r\nwitness to his morality, and, as to the twaddle about Olmütz, the\r\nArchduke would probably spend not more than six weeks of the year there.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEETHOVEN INSISTS ON SOLE GUARDIANSHIP]\r\n\r\n    The chief points are that I be recognized at once as sole guardian,\r\n    I will accept no co-guardian, that the mother be excluded from\r\n    intercourse with her son in the _Institute_ because in view of\r\n    her _immorality_ there cannot be enough watchmen there and she\r\n    confuses the teacher by her false statements and lies. She also\r\n    has led her son to tell shameful lies and make charges _against\r\n    me_, and accuses me herself of having given him too much or too\r\n    little; but that the claims of humanity may not be overlooked, she\r\n    may see her son occasionally at my home in the presence of his\r\n    teachers and other excellent men.... It is my opinion that you\r\n    should insist stoutly and irrevocably that I be _sole_ guardian\r\n    and that this unnatural mother shall see her son only at _my\r\n    house_; my well known humanity and culture are a guarantee that\r\n    my treatment of her will be no less generous than that given to\r\n    her son. Moreover, I think that all this should be done quickly\r\n    and that if possible we ought to get the Appellate Court to assume\r\n    the superior guardianship, as I want my nephew to be placed in a\r\n    higher category; neither he nor I belong to the Magistracy under\r\n    whose guardianship are only innkeepers, shoemakers and tailors. As\r\n    regards his present maintenance, it shall be cared for as long as\r\n    I live. For the future he has 7,000 florins _W.W._ of which his\r\n    mother has the usufruct during life; also 2,000 fl. (or a little\r\n    more since I have reinvested it), the interest on which belongs to\r\n    _him_, and 4,000 florins in silver of _mine_ are lying in the bank;\r\n    as he is to inherit all my property this belongs to his capital.\r\n    You will observe that while because of his _great talent_ (to which\r\n    the Honorable Magistracy is indifferent) he will not be able at\r\n    once to support himself, there is already a superfluity in case of\r\n    my death.\r\n\r\nIn a postscript he accuses the mother of wishing to gain possession of\r\nher son in order to enjoy all of her pension. In view of this he had\r\ntaken counsel as to whether or not he should let her keep the money and\r\nmake it good from his own pocket. He had been advised not to do so,\r\nhowever, because she would make bad use of the money. “I have decided,\r\ntherefore, to set aside the sum in time. You see again how foolishly\r\nthe Magistracy is acting in trying to tear my son wholly from me, since\r\nwhen she dies the boy will lose this share of the pension and would get\r\nalong _very poorly_ without my aid.” A few days later Beethoven wrote\r\nto Dr. Bach again, this time to suggest that legal steps be taken to\r\nattach the widow’s pension, he having a suspicion that she was trying\r\nto evade payment of her son’s share because she had permitted nine\r\nmonths to pass without drawing the pension from the exchequer.\r\n\r\nThe Magistracy disposed of Beethoven’s protest and application on\r\nNovember 4, by curtly referring him to the disposition made of his\r\npetition of September 17. Beethoven asked for a reconsideration of the\r\nmatter, but without avail, and the only recourse remaining to him was\r\nthe appeal to the higher court which had already been suggested to Dr.\r\nBach. The story of that appeal belongs to the year 1820. Meanwhile\r\nthe association of Councillor Peters with him in the guardianship had\r\nbeen broached and was the subject of discussion with his friends. In\r\nDecember Bernard writes in a Conversation Book:\r\n\r\n    The Magistracy has till now only made a minute of the proceedings\r\n    and will now hold a session to arrive at a decision. It is already\r\n    decided that you shall have the chief guardianship, but a 2d is\r\n    to be associated with you. As no objection can be made to Peters,\r\n    there will be no difficulty. The matter will be ordered according\r\n    to your wishes and I will take care of Mr. Blöchlinger. The mother\r\n    will not be admitted to the institute unless you are present, 4\r\n    times a year is enough--nor the guardian either?--The Magistracy\r\n    has compromised itself nicely.\r\n\r\nBach seems to have advised that the mother be accepted as co-guardian.\r\nHe writes: “As co-guardian she will have no authority, only the\r\nhonor of being associated in the guardianship. She will be a mere\r\nfigurehead.” Whether the conversations noted at the time referred to\r\nthe case on appeal or to the application still pending before the\r\nMagistracy, or some to the one, some to the other, it is impossible to\r\ndetermine. The record of the refusal of the Magistracy has not been\r\nprocured, but the decree of the Appellate Court gives December 20 as\r\nits date.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SCHINDLER AND THE CONVERSATION BOOKS]\r\n\r\nFrequent citations from the so-called “Conversation Books” made\r\nin the course of the narrative touching the later phases of the\r\ncontroversy over the guardianship call for some remarks upon this new\r\nsource of information opened in this year. In the “Niederrheinische\r\nMusikzeitung,” No. 28 of 1854, Schindler wrote:\r\n\r\n    Beethoven’s hearing had already become too weak for oral\r\n    conversation, even with the help of an ear-trumpet, in 1818,\r\n    and recourse had now to be had to writing. Only in the case of\r\n    intercourse with Archduke Rudolph, and here because of his gentle\r\n    voice, the smallest of the ear-trumpets remained of service for\r\n    several years more.\r\n\r\nThat he was able, partly by the ear and partly by the eye, to judge of\r\nthe correctness of the performance of his music, Schindler states in\r\nthe same article--a fact also known from many other sources; this was\r\nthe case even to his last year. When, after the death of Beethoven,\r\nsuch of his manuscripts and papers as were thought to be salable\r\nwere set apart, there remained in the hands of von Breuning a lot of\r\nletters, documents and Conversation Books. The estimated value in the\r\ninventory of the manuscripts and the price obtained for them at the\r\nauction sale, indicate how utterly worthless from a pecuniary point\r\nof view that other collection was thought to be; as, however, they\r\nmight be of use to some future biographer, it was well to have them\r\npreserved, and doubtless a small gratification to Schindler for his\r\ngreat sacrifices and very valuable services to Beethoven in these last\r\nmonths, the only one which he as guardian to the absent nephew could\r\nmake; so Breuning gave them to him. The Conversation Books, counting\r\nin as such those which were really nothing but a sheet or two of paper\r\nloosely folded, were only about 400 in number, or less than fifty per\r\nannum for the last eight and a half years of Beethoven’s life--that\r\nbeing the period which they cover. Schindler, who spoke on this as on\r\nso many other topics frankly and without reserve, said that he long\r\npreserved the books and papers intact, but not finding any person\r\nbut himself who placed any value upon them, their weight and bulk\r\nhad led him in the course of his long unsettled life by degrees to\r\ndestroy those which he deemed to be of little or no importance. The\r\nremainder were, in 1845, transferred to the Royal Library in Berlin,\r\nand, in 1855, when they were examined for this work, numbered 138. It\r\nwas but natural that those preserved are such as place Schindler’s\r\nrelation to the master in the strongest light and those deemed by him\r\nessential to the full understanding of the more important events of\r\nBeethoven’s last years. Most of them bear evidence of the deep interest\r\nwith which Schindler, while they remained in his possession, lived\r\nover the past in them. In many cases he appended the names of the\r\nprincipal writers; so that one soon learns to distinguish their hands\r\nwithout difficulty; and occasionally he enriched them with valuable\r\nannotations.[9] The larger of them--ordinary blank note-books--are\r\nonly of a size and thickness fitted to be carried in the coat-pocket.\r\nIt is obvious, therefore, on a moment’s reflection, that at a single\r\nsitting with a few friends in an inn or coffee-house, the pages must\r\nhave filled rapidly as the book passed from hand to hand and one or\r\nanother wrote question or reply, remark or statement, a bit of news\r\nor a piece of advice. A few such conversations, one sees, would fill\r\na book, all the sooner as there is no thought of economizing space\r\nand each new sentence is usually also a new paragraph. It strikes\r\none, therefore, that the whole 400 could have contained but a small\r\nportion of the conversations of the period they covered. This was so.\r\nAt home a slate or any loose scraps of paper were commonly used, thus\r\nsaving a heavy item of expense; moreover, many who conversed with\r\nBeethoven would only write upon the slate in order to obliterate it\r\nimmediately, that nothing should remain exposed to the eyes of others.\r\nThe books, therefore, were for the most part for use when the composer\r\nwas away from home, although there were occasions when, it being\r\ndesirable to preserve what was written, they were also used there.\r\nHence, the collection in Berlin can be viewed as little more than\r\nscattered specimens of the conversations of the master’s friends and\r\ncompanions, most unequally distributed as to time. For months together\r\nthere is nothing or hardly anything; and then again a few days will\r\nfill many scores of leaves. In a few instances Beethoven has himself\r\nwritten--that is, when in some public place he did not trust his voice;\r\nand memoranda of divers kinds, even of musical ideas from his pen, are\r\nnot infrequent. One is surprised to find so few distinguished names in\r\nliterature, science and art--Grillparzer’s forms an exception and he\r\nappears only in the later years; as for the rest, they are for the most\r\npart of local Vienna celebrities.\r\n\r\nThere is no source of information for the biography of Beethoven\r\nwhich at first sight appears so rich and productive and yet, to the\r\nconscientious writer, proves so provokingly defective and requires such\r\nextreme caution in its use as these Conversation Books. The oldest of\r\nthem belongs to the time before us (1819) and was evidently preserved\r\nby Schindler on account of the protracted conversations on the topic of\r\nthe nephew. We have already made several citations from it and shall\r\nhave frequent occasion to have recourse to it in the progress of this\r\nnarrative. The period in which it was used is approximately fixed by a\r\nreference to a concert given by the violinist Franz Clement, at which\r\nhe played an introduction and variations on a theme by Beethoven.\r\nThis concert took place on April 4, 1819.[10] The last conversations\r\nin the book took place about the time of Beethoven’s removal to\r\nMödling--shortly before and after.\r\n\r\nThis explanatory digression may serve as a modulation to more cheerful\r\nthemes than that which has occupied us of late.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MUSICAL SURPRISE AT A WEDDING]\r\n\r\nThough Karl was no longer a member of the Giannatasio household or\r\npupil of the institute, and though there were, in consequence, fewer\r\nmeetings between Beethoven and his self-sacrificing friends, their\r\nrelations remained pleasant, and early in 1819 Beethoven found occasion\r\nto supplement his verbal protestations of gratitude with a deed. Nanni,\r\nthe younger daughter of Giannatasio, was married on February 6, 1819,\r\nto Leopold Schmerling. When the young couple returned to the house\r\nafter the ceremony they were greeted by a wedding hymn for tenor solo,\r\nmen’s voices and pianoforte accompaniment. The performers were hidden\r\nin a corner of the room. When they had finished they stepped forth from\r\ntheir place of concealment. Beethoven was among them and he handed the\r\nmanuscript of the music which he had written to words of Prof. Stein,\r\nwho occupied a chair of philosophy at the University and was also tutor\r\nin the imperial household,[11] to the bride.\r\n\r\nBeethoven made a single appearance as conductor in this year. It was on\r\nJanuary 17 at a concert given for the benefit of the Widows and Orphans\r\nof the Juridical Faculty of the University. The orchestra was largely\r\ncomposed of amateurs and the programme began with the overture to\r\n“Prometheus” and ended with the Seventh Symphony. Among the listeners\r\nwas P. D. A. Atterbom, the Swedish poet, who wrote a sympathetic\r\naccount of it.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the worries occasioned by the guardianship, Beethoven\r\nwas elected Honorary Member of the Philharmonic Society of Laibach,\r\nan institution which had been founded in 1702 and revived, after\r\nrepeated interruptions, in 1816. The project of giving him the\r\ndistinction had been broached in the councils of the society in 1808,\r\nbut Anton Schmith, a physician in Vienna, whose opinion had been\r\nasked, had advised against it, saying: “Beethoven is as freakish as\r\nhe is unserviceable.” Eleven years later the men of Laibach had more\r\nknowledge or better counsel, and they sent him a diploma on March\r\n15 through von Tuscher. Acknowledging the honor on May 4, Beethoven\r\nstated that as a mark of appreciation he was sending, also through\r\nthe magistrate, an “unpublished” composition and would hold himself\r\nin readiness to serve the society should it ever need him. There is\r\nno direct evidence as to what composition he had in mind; but in the\r\narchives of the Laibach society there is a manuscript copy of the Sixth\r\nSymphony. It is not an autograph except as to its title, Beethoven\r\nhaving written “Sinfonia pastorale” on the cover in red crayon, and\r\ncorrections in lead pencil in the music.[12]\r\n\r\nThe time for Beethoven’s annual summer flitting had come. Mödling was\r\nchosen again for the country sojourn and Beethoven arrived there on May\r\n12, taking lodgings as before in the Hafner house in the Hauptstrasse.\r\nHe had, evidently, brought a housekeeper with him and now engaged a\r\nhousemaid. The former endured two months.[13] Karl was placed under\r\nthe tuition of Blöchlinger on June 22. Beethoven, as letters to the\r\nArchduke dated July 15 and August 31[14] show, was not in the best of\r\nhealth, but was hard at work on the mass, with an excursion now and\r\nthen into the symphony (Ninth). Schindler presents us with a pathetic,\r\nimpressive, almost terrifying picture of the state to which his labors\r\nlifted him (Ed. of 1860, I, 270):\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: IN A FRENZY OF COMPOSITION]\r\n\r\n    Towards the end of August, accompanied by the musician Johann\r\n    Horsalka still living in Vienna, I arrived at the master’s home in\r\n    Mödling. It was 4 o’clock in the afternoon. As soon as we entered\r\n    we learned that in the morning both servants had gone away, and\r\n    that there had been a quarrel after midnight which had disturbed\r\n    all the neighbors, because as a consequence of a long vigil both\r\n    had gone to sleep and the food which had been prepared had become\r\n    unpalatable. In the living-room, behind a locked door, we heard\r\n    the master singing parts of the fugue in the _Credo_--singing,\r\n    howling, stamping. After we had been listening a long time to this\r\n    almost awful scene, and were about to go away, the door opened and\r\n    Beethoven stood before us with distorted features, calculated to\r\n    excite fear. He looked as if he had been in mortal combat with the\r\n    whole host of contrapuntists, his everlasting enemies. His first\r\n    utterances were confused, as if he had been disagreeably surprised\r\n    at our having overheard him. Then he reached the day’s happenings\r\n    and with obvious restraint he remarked: “Pretty doings, these!\r\n    (_Saubere Wirthschaft_.) Everybody has run away and I haven’t\r\n    had anything to eat since yesternoon!” I tried to calm him and\r\n    helped him to make his toilet. My companion hurried on in advance\r\n    to the restaurant of the bathing establishment to have something\r\n    made ready for the famished master. Then he complained about the\r\n    wretched state of his domestic affairs, but here, for reasons\r\n    already stated, there was nothing to be done. Never, it may be\r\n    said, did so great an artwork as is the _Missa Solemnis_ see its\r\n    creation under more adverse circumstances.[15]\r\n\r\nThe fact that Beethoven received an advance payment on a commission\r\nfor an oratorio which he undertook to write for the Gesellschaft der\r\nMusikfreunde has been mentioned. The sum was 400 florins. It was on\r\nAugust 18. Four days later there was a meeting of the society at which\r\nLandgrave von Fürstenberg reported[16] that on the written application\r\nof Prince von Odescalchi, representing the President, Beethoven had\r\nreplied that he had long been desirous to compose a work which would\r\nreflect honor on the society and that he would do his best to expedite\r\nit. That seems to have been the end of the matter for the time being.\r\nThere was also during the Mödling sojourn a continuation of the\r\nnegotiations with Thomson. A Mr. Smith visited Beethoven bearing a\r\nletter from the Scotch publisher which called out a playful rejoinder\r\nin which Beethoven sought to turn an easy play upon German words into\r\nFrench. Thomson suggested that the introductions and accompaniments\r\nto the Scotch songs be made easier (“lighter,” in the German idiom);\r\nthey would be so, Beethoven replied, if the compensation were made more\r\ndifficult (“heavier” would have been his word had he been permitted to\r\nuse the German equivalent). As it is, Beethoven’s humor becomes rather\r\nponderous, as see the letter which was written in French by Beethoven\r\napparently without assistance:\r\n\r\n  _Vienne le 25me Maj, 1819._\r\n\r\n  _Mon cher Ami!_\r\n\r\n    _Vous ecrivés toujours facile très--je m’accomode tout mon\r\n    possible, mais--mais--mais--l’honorare pourroit pourtant être\r\n    plus difficile, ou plus-tôt pesante!!!!! Votre ami Mosieur Smith\r\n    m’a fait grand plaisir a cause de sa visite chez moi--en Hâte,\r\n    je vous assure, que je serais toujours avec plaisir a votres\r\n    services--comme j’ai a present votre Addresse par Mr. Smith, je\r\n    serai bientôt en Etat de vous écrire plus ample--l’honorare pour un\r\n    Théme avec variations j’ai fixé, dans ma derniere letter à vous par\r\n    Messieurs le Friess, a moien dix ducats en or, C’est, je vous jure\r\n    malgre cela seulement par complaisance pour vous, puisque je n’ais\r\n    pas besoin, de me méler avec de telles petites choses, mais il\r\n    faut toujours pourtant perdre du temps avec de telles bagatelles,\r\n    et l’honneur ne permit pas, de dire a quelqu’un, ce qu’on en\r\n    gagne,--je vous souhaite toujours le bon gout pour la vrai Musique\r\n    et si vous cries facile--je crierai difficile pour facile!!!!_\r\n\r\nThomson indorsed on this letter: “25 May, 1819. Beethoven. Some\r\npleasantry on my repeated requests to make his Symphs and accompgnts.\r\nto our National Airs Easy, sent by Mr. John Smith of Glasg.” Another\r\nBritish commission was offered him about the same time. There are\r\ntwo entries in a Conversation Book, apparently in the handwriting of\r\nSchindler:\r\n\r\n    The Englishman brought me your letter yesterday and evening\r\n    before last I received another one for you through Fries. Another\r\n    commission was brought by the other Englishman, the friend of\r\n    Smith. A Mr. Donaldson in Edinburgh wants to know if you will not\r\n    write a Trio for 3 pianofortes and in the style of your Quintet in\r\n    E-flat. He wants to announce it as his property--The remuneration\r\n    which you demand is to be paid to you in any way you may\r\n    select--All the parts of the Trio must be obbligato. If you do not,\r\n    write to Donaldson in Edinburgh direct. These Englishmen speak of\r\n    nothing else than their wish to have you come to England--they give\r\n    assurance that if you come for a single winter to England, Scotland\r\n    and Ireland, you will earn so much that you can live the rest of\r\n    your life on the interest.\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n    The gentleman is going to write to\r\n    Donaldson--Edinburgh--to-day--the answer can be here in 4 weeks and\r\n    the gentleman can be here that long. Tell him how much you want,\r\n    when it might be finished and how you want the payment made. He\r\n    is very desirous to have a composition from you and there is no\r\n    possibility of its being left on your hands--Moreover it is a great\r\n    work. If you get 40 ducats for the Sonata he can doubtless pay 100.\r\n    By that time the answer may be here from Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain’s monetary reward, had Beethoven accepted all its\r\ninvitations, would no doubt have been all that the friend of “Mr.\r\nDonaldson of Edinburgh” stated and in proportion would have been the\r\nappreciation which Beethoven would have found at the hands of the\r\nEnglish professional musicians, amateurs and musical laity.\r\n\r\nPathetic and diverting are the incidents which Karl Friedrich\r\nZelter relates in letters to Goethe of his attempts to form a\r\ncloser acquaintance with Beethoven. Zelter came to Vienna in July.\r\nHe says that he wanted to call upon Beethoven, but he was in the\r\ncountry--nobody knew where. This in his first letter which mentions the\r\nsubject. On August 16 he writes:\r\n\r\n    It is said that he is intolerably _maussade_. Some say that he is a\r\n    lunatic. It is easy to talk. God forgive us all our sins! The poor\r\n    man is reported as being totally deaf. Now I know what it means to\r\n    see all this digital manipulation around me while my fingers are\r\n    becoming useless one after the other. Lately Beethoven went into an\r\n    eating-house; he sat himself down to a table and lost himself in\r\n    thought. After an hour he calls the waiter. “What do I owe?” “The\r\n    gentleman has not eaten anything yet” “What shall I bring?” “Bring\r\n    anything you please, but let me alone!”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MEETING BETWEEN BEETHOVEN AND ZELTER]\r\n\r\nZelter stays in Vienna from July to September, but sees nothing of\r\nBeethoven. Then, on September 12, he sets out with Steiner to visit\r\nthe master at Mödling. On the road they meet Beethoven, who is on his\r\nway to the city. Leaving their carriages they embrace each other, but\r\nconversation with a deaf man not being practicable on the highway\r\nthey separate after agreeing to meet at Steiner’s at 4 o’clock in the\r\nafternoon. Zelter was moved almost to tears. After a hurried meal he\r\nand Steiner hastened back to Vienna. Let him relate the rest:\r\n\r\n    After eating we drove back to Vienna at once. Full as a badger\r\n    and tired as a dog I lie down and sleep away the time, sleep so\r\n    soundly that not a thing enters my mind. Then I go to the theatre\r\n    and when I see Beethoven there I feel as if I had been struck by\r\n    lightning. The same thing happens to him at sight of me, and this\r\n    is not the place for explanations with a deaf man. Now comes the\r\n    point: In spite of the things of which Beethoven is accused justly\r\n    or unjustly, he enjoys a popular respect such as is bestowed only\r\n    upon the most excellent. Steiner had given it out that Beethoven\r\n    would appear in his little office, which will hold only six or\r\n    eight persons, for the first time in person at 4 o’clock, and\r\n    invited guests so generously that in a room crowded to the street,\r\n    half a hundred brilliant people waited in vain. I did not get an\r\n    explanation till next day, when I received a letter from Beethoven\r\n    in which he begged my pardon, for he, like me, had passed the time\r\n    set for the meeting in blissful sleep.\r\n\r\nZelter’s letter calls for a slight rectification. It was not the\r\nnext day but four days later that Beethoven wrote him the letter of\r\nexplanation, and Zelter’s statement that Beethoven had overslept\r\nhimself as he had done was pure assumption--unless he learned it from\r\nanother source. Beethoven wrote:\r\n\r\n    Highly respected Sir:\r\n\r\n    It is my fault that you were lately besmeared (_angeschmiert_,\r\n    that is, deceived, cheated) as we say here, by me. Unforeseen\r\n    circumstances robbed me of the pleasure of passing a few lovely and\r\n    enjoyable hours, which would have been profitable to art, with you.\r\n    I hear that you are already leaving Vienna day after to-morrow. My\r\n    country life, to which I am forced by my poor health, is, however,\r\n    not as beneficial as usual to me this year. It may be that I shall\r\n    come in again day after to-morrow and if you are not already gone\r\n    in the afternoon I hope to tell you by word of mouth with true\r\n    cordiality how much I esteem you and desire your friendship (to be\r\n    near to you).\r\n\r\nThe autograph of this letter contains what appears to be either a\r\ntranscript or a draft of a letter which Zelter either sent or planned\r\nto send to Beethoven. In view of the fact that it shows a different\r\nfeeling towards the great composer than that formerly entertained by\r\nthe teacher of Mendelssohn, it is given here:\r\n\r\n    To see once more, face to face, in this life the man who brings\r\n    joy and edification to so many good people, among whom I of course\r\n    am glad to count myself--this was the purpose, worthy friend, for\r\n    which I wished to visit you at Mödlingen. You met me, and my aim\r\n    was at least not wholly frustrated, for I saw your face. I know of\r\n    the infirmity which burdens you and you have my sympathy, for I\r\n    am similarly afflicted. On the day after to-morrow I go from here\r\n    to resume my labors, but I shall never cease to hold you in high\r\n    respect and to love you.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A COMPOSITION BY ARCHDUKE RUDOLPH]\r\n\r\nFriedrich Schneider, of Dessau, visited Vienna in the fall of the year\r\nand caused a sensation by his organ-playing. He reported that Beethoven\r\nhad received him graciously and that he, in turn, had heard the master\r\nplay the pianoforte, his improvisation being the most marvellous thing\r\nhe had ever listened to. In August, Johann van Beethoven bought an\r\nestate near Gneixendorf. This brought the brothers together in Vienna\r\nduring the winter. Johann was the “landowner” of a familiar story, and\r\nBeethoven, the “brain owner,” seemed at this time disposed to emulate\r\nhim. At least he read advertisements of houses for sale in Mödling\r\nbefore the day set for the sale and advised him in the premises. In\r\nthe same letter[17] he advises Steiner to publish a set of variations\r\ncomposed by the Archduke. “I have mentioned your name in the matter,\r\ninasmuch as I do not believe that you will lose anything by the\r\ntransaction, and it is always honorable to print something by such a\r\n_Principe Professore_.” The variations were on a theme composed by\r\nBeethoven and given to his imperial pupil as a lesson, and had called\r\nout the obsequious remarks which may be read in the New Year’s letter\r\nto the Archduke. His remark to Steiner is explained by the fact that on\r\nAugust 31 he had written to the Archduke as follows:\r\n\r\n    As regards the masterly variations of Y. I. H. I think they might\r\n    be published under the following title, namely:\r\n\r\n        Theme, or Task\r\n      set by L. v. Beeth.\r\n      forty times varied\r\n  and dedicated to his teacher\r\n  by the Most Serene Author.\r\n\r\n    There are so many requests for them, and eventually this honorable\r\n    work will reach the public in garbled copies. Y. I. H. will\r\n    yourself not be able to avoid presenting copies here and there;\r\n    therefore, in the name of God, among the many consecrations which\r\n    Y. I. H. is receiving and of which the world is being informed, let\r\n    the consecration of Apollo (or the Christian Cäcilia) also be made\r\n    known. True, Y. I. H. may accuse me of vanity; but I can assure you\r\n    that although this dedication is precious to me and I am really\r\n    proud of it, this is not at all my aim. 3 publishers have appealed\r\n    for it, Artaria, Steiner and a third whose name does not occur\r\n    to me. To which of the first two shall the Variations be given?\r\n    On this point I await the commands of Y. I. H. Both of them have\r\n    offered to print the variations at _their own cost_. The question\r\n    now is whether Y. I. H. is _satisfied with the title_? To the\r\n    question whether or not the variations ought to be published, Y. I.\r\n    H. ought to close your eyes; if it is done, Y. I. H. may call it a\r\n    misfortune; but _the world will think the contrary_.\r\n\r\nSteiner printed the archducal work in the seventh number of his\r\n“Musical Museum” under a slightly changed title, viz.: “Theme\r\n(_Aufgabe_) composed by Ludwig van Beethoven, varied forty times and\r\ndedicated to the author by his pupil R[udolph], A[rch-]D[uke].”[18]\r\nOther evidences of Beethoven’s interest in Archduke Rudolph’s studies\r\nin composition are to be noted about this time. On July 29 he wrote\r\nto his pupil from Mödling, sending him three poems and asking him\r\nto select one for composition, encouraging him in these words: “The\r\nAustrians now know already that the spirit of Apollo has newly awakened\r\nin the Imperial family. From all quarters I receive requests for\r\nsomething. The proprietor of the _Modezeitung_ will appeal to Y. I. H.\r\nin writing. I hope I _shall not be accused of bribery--at Court and not\r\na courtier_, what possibilities??!!!” In this letter, however, there\r\nare words of vaster import, as showing Beethoven’s attitude towards\r\nmusical evolution. We quote:\r\n\r\n    ... but _freedom_, _progress_, is the aim in the world of art as\r\n    in the whole great universe, and even if we moderns are not so far\r\n    advanced in sound technique (_Festigkeit_) as our _forefathers_,\r\n    refinement in manners has opened many things to us. My exalted\r\n    pupil in music, already a fellow-contestant for the laurel of fame,\r\n    must not subject himself to the accusation of _onesidedness_,--_et\r\n    iterum venturus judicare vivos et mortuos_.[19]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A PAINTER’S PRESENCE FORGOTTEN]\r\n\r\nA number of incidents in Beethoven’s life may now be passed in hurried\r\nchronological review: On October 1, he was made an honorary member of\r\nthe Mercantile Association (_Kaufmännischer Verein_) in Vienna. In the\r\nfall Ferdinand Schimon (1797-1852), who was musician and opera-singer\r\nas well as painter, painted the portrait which afterward came into\r\nthe possession of Schindler, and was engraved by Eduard Eichers for\r\nSchindler’s biography.[20] Schimon had obtained permission through\r\nSchindler to set up his easel in the chamber adjoining Beethoven’s\r\nworkroom, the composer having resolutely refused a sitting because he\r\nwas busy on the _Credo_ of the mass. From this point of vantage he made\r\nhis studies and had finished them all but the eyes--the most striking\r\nfeature in the portrait. Out of this dilemma Beethoven unconsciously\r\nhelped him. He had evidently been impressed with the discretion, or\r\nindependence, of the young artist who came without a “good morning” and\r\nwent without a “good evening,” and invited him to coffee. Thus Schimon\r\nhad ample opportunity to supply the one deficiency in his sketches.\r\n\r\nAt the end of October, Beethoven returned to Vienna from Mödling,\r\ntaking lodging this time at No. 16 Josephstädter Glacis, opposite the\r\nAuersberg Palace and near the Blöchlinger Institute where Karl was\r\nstudying. The guardianship matter soon occupied his attention; spells\r\nof indisposition tormented him; and financial distress so threatened\r\nhim that he attempted to negotiate a loan from the banker Hennickstein,\r\nand borrowed 750 florins from Steiner.[21] Countess Erdödy was in\r\nVienna at the end of the year and he sent her a note on December 19,\r\npromising to visit her soon and scratching down a musical phrase which\r\nhe afterwards erased to make of it the New Year canon: “Glück, Glück\r\nzum neuen Jahr.”\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that Beethoven, under the circumstances which have\r\nbeen set forth in this chapter, could continue his labors on the Mass\r\nwhich were his principal occupation during the year; it was but another\r\nproof of the absorbing possession which the composition of a great work\r\ntook of him when once fairly begun. So diligently did he apply himself\r\nthat he had hopes not only of finishing it in time for the installation\r\nof the Archduke as Archbishop of Olmütz, but wrote to Ries on November\r\n10 that he had already nearly completed it and would like to know what\r\ncould be done with it in London. To Schindler, however, in expressing\r\na doubt that he would have it done in time for the ceremonial, he said\r\nthat every movement had taken on larger dimensions than had originally\r\nbeen contemplated. Schindler says also that when the day came, not\r\none of the movements was finished in the eyes of the composer; yet he\r\nalleges that Beethoven brought the completed _Credo_ with him when\r\nhe came back to Vienna from Mödling. There is this to be added to\r\nthese statements: A pocket sketchbook used in 1820 (it is now in the\r\nBeethoven House at Bonn) shows some sketches for the _Credo_; and\r\nthere are memoranda for the same movement in a Conversation Book used\r\nnear the close of the year. That the _Gloria_ had received its final\r\nshape is a fair deduction from a Conversation Book of the same period.\r\nBernard (presumably) writes:\r\n\r\n    It was decided yesterday that you give a concert either on\r\n    Christmas or some other day. Count Stadion will give the use of the\r\n    room, and Schick, Czerny and Janitschek will care for the rest. The\r\n    programme is to include a symphony, the _Gloria_ from your mass,\r\n    the new Sonata played by you and a grand final chorus. All your\r\n    works. 4,000 florins are guaranteed. Only one movement of the mass\r\n    is to be performed.\r\n\r\nThe project is mentioned again by another friend, and Beethoven\r\nremarks: “It is too late for Christmas, but it might be possible in\r\nLent.” That he worked occasionally on the Ninth Symphony, especially\r\nin the early part of the year, has already been said. Thomson’s\r\ncommissions occupied some of his time, as well as a project to\r\nextend his labors on folksongs into a wider field. The second set of\r\nVariations on folksong themes which was published as Op. 107 in 1820,\r\nmust be assigned, at least in part, to this year. He also, as Schindler\r\ntells us, composed a set of waltzes for a band of seven men who played\r\nat an inn in the valley of the Brühl near Mödling, and wrote out the\r\nparts for the different instruments. These waltzes have disappeared;\r\nSchindler tried in vain to find them a few years later. The canon\r\n“Glück zum neuen Jahr” was composed for Countess Erdödy on the last day\r\nof December, if A. Fuchs, who says that he copied it from the original\r\nmanuscript, is correct. He also wrote a canon for Steiner in the\r\nsummer, as appears from a conversation recorded in a book of March 20,\r\n1820. An unidentified hand writes:\r\n\r\n    Last summer you sent a _canon infinitus a due_ to Steiner from\r\n    Mödling\r\n\r\n    [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    Nobody has solved it, but I have solved it. The second voice enters\r\n    on the second:\r\n\r\n    [Illustration:\r\n\r\n      it is infinite.\r\n    Go to the devil[22]\r\n    God protect you\r\n      was the text.\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n    On September 21 he wrote a canon to the words “Glaube und hoffe”\r\n    for the younger Schlesinger, afterwards publisher in Paris, who\r\n    was a visitor in Vienna from Berlin at the time, as Beethoven’s\r\n    inscription on the autograph shows.[23]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PUBLICATIONS OF THE YEAR 1819]\r\n\r\nThe publications of the year 1819 were (1) Two Sonatas for Pianoforte\r\nand Violoncello, Op. 102, dedicated to Countess Erdödy, by Artaria in\r\nVienna (they had already been published by Simrock); (2) The Quintet\r\nin C minor, Op. 104, arranged from the Trio, Op. 1, No. 3; (3) Themes\r\nand Variations on Motives from Folksongs, for Pianoforte and Flute or\r\nViolin, Op. 105, by Artaria; Pianoforte Sonata in B-flat, Op. 106,\r\ndedicated to Archduke Rudolph, by Artaria.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] He had not been removed, but only temporarily suspended; he\r\nretained the supervision of the boy’s education and at a later period\r\nvoluntarily resigned the guardianship for a time.\r\n\r\n[2] See Kalischer-Shedlock, Vol. II. p. 124 _et seq._ The letter was\r\ndated erroneously February 1, 1818, instead of 1819.\r\n\r\n[3] These citations are from the Conversation Books.\r\n\r\n[4] Landshut University. It was afterward removed to Munich.\r\n\r\n[5] As a matter of fact the boy was with Kudlich after this and\r\nremained there until Beethoven went to Mödling. At the time of this\r\nconsultation he was with his mother. Kudlich was instructed not to\r\npermit any communication between him and his mother.\r\n\r\n[6] It is undated, but to judge by its contents and the sequence of\r\nevents was written in May. See Kalischer-Shedlock, Vol. II, p. 134.\r\n\r\n[7] Kalischer-Shedlock, Vol. II, p. 149.\r\n\r\n[8] Kalischer-Shedlock, Vol. II, p. 145.\r\n\r\n[9] That he was not always scrupulous in preserving their integrity\r\nwhen they offered evidence in contradiction of his printed statements\r\nis the conviction of this editor for reasons which will appear later.\r\n\r\n[10] Apparently in reply to a question put by Beethoven an unidentified\r\nhand writes: “Poor stuff,--empty--totally ineffective--your theme was\r\nin bad hands; with much monotony he made 15 or 20 variations and put\r\na cadenza (_fermate_) in every one, you may imagine what we had to\r\nendure--he has fallen off greatly and looks too old to entertain with\r\nhis acrobatics on the violin.”\r\n\r\nThayer’s industry in the gathering and ordering of material for this\r\nbiography, let it be remarked here in grateful tribute, is illustrated\r\nin the fact that he made practically a complete transcript of the\r\nConversation Books, laboriously deciphering the frequently hieroglyphic\r\nscrawls, and compiled a mass of supplementary material for the purpose\r\nof fixing the chronological order of the conversations. The dates of\r\nall concerts and other public events alluded to were established by the\r\nexamination of newspapers and other contemporaneous records and the\r\nutility of the biographical material greatly enhanced.\r\n\r\n[11] Madame Pessiak-Schmerling, a daughter of Nanni, recounted this\r\nincident twice in the letters to Thayer. Madame Pessiak possessed a\r\ncopy of the song. Her mother had jealously preserved the original,\r\nbut, together with Beethoven’s letters to Giannatasio, it was stolen.\r\nIn 1861 Thayer found song and letters among the autographs owned by\r\nWilliam Witt of the firm of Ewer and Co. in London, and obtained copies\r\nof them, but Thayer’s copy of the song was not found by this Editor\r\namong the posthumous papers of the author when he examined them in\r\norder to set aside the needful material for the completion of this\r\nbiography. The music of Miss Nanni’s hymeneal ode was forty years later\r\nput to a right royal use. Transposed from C to A major it was published\r\nfor the first time by Ewer and Co. as a setting to English words on\r\nthe occasion of the marriage of Victoria, eldest daughter of Queen\r\nVictoria, to Frederick William of Prussia (afterwards Emperor Frederick\r\nIII) on January 25, 1858. The title of this publication, which is now\r\nout of print, was “The Wedding Song, written and by gracious permission\r\ndedicated to Her Royal Highness Victoria, Princess Royal, on her\r\nWedding Day, by John Oxenford. The music composed by L. van Beethoven.\r\nPosthumous Work.” The inscription on the original manuscript, according\r\nto Thayer, was “Am 14ten Jenner 1819--für F. v. Giannatasio de Rio von\r\nL. v. Beethoven.”\r\n\r\nAt the Editor’s request Mr. J. S. Shedlock, in 1912, kindly made an\r\ninvestigation and reported that so far as could be learned from the\r\npublic records the song had no place in the wedding ceremonies in 1858.\r\nMessrs. Novello and Co. most courteously brought forth the old plates\r\nfrom their vaults and had a “pull” of them made for this Editor’s use.\r\nThe music can not be said to have any other than a curious interest. A\r\nsingle stanza will suffice to disclose the quality of Mr. Oxenford’s\r\nhymeneal ode:\r\n\r\n    “Hail, Royal Pair, by love united;\r\n      With ev’ry earthly blessing crown’d;\r\n    A people lifts its voice delighted,\r\n      And distant nations hear the sound.\r\n    All hearts are now with gladness swelling,\r\n    All tongues are now of rapture telling,\r\n      A day of heartfelt joy is found!”\r\n\r\n\r\n[12] Dr. F. Keesbacher, who published a history of the Laibach\r\nPhilharmonic Society in 1862, thought that this was the composition\r\nsent by Beethoven; but the “Pastoral” Symphony had been published\r\nnearly ten years before--by Breitkopf and Härtel in May, 1809.\r\n\r\n[13] On the blank leaves of an Almanac for 1819, such as used to be\r\nbound in those useful household publications for the reception of\r\nmemoranda, Beethoven notes: “Came to Mödling, May 12.!!! _Miser sum\r\npauper_....” “On May 14 the housemaid in Mr. came, to receive 6 florins\r\na month.... On 29th May Dr. Hasenöhrl made his 3rd visit to K. Tuesday\r\non the 22nd of June my nephew entered the institute of Mr. Blöchlinger\r\nat monthly payments in advance of 75 florins _W. W._ Began to take the\r\nbaths here regularly (?) on 28th Monday, for the first (?) time daily.”\r\nSchindler adds: “On July 20 gave notice to the housekeeper.”\r\n\r\n[14] Kalischer-Shedlock, Vol. II. pp. 138 and 139.\r\n\r\n[15] In his draft for this chapter Thayer wrote: “In the hope of\r\nobtaining further particulars Horsalka’s attention was directed to\r\nthis passage in the copy now before the writer. The result is written\r\non the margin in Herr Luib’s hand: ‘Horsalka knows nothing of this’.\r\nThis incident is doubtless true, but that Horsalka should not have\r\nremembered it if he was present, is incredible. Schindler’s queer\r\nmemory has again proved treacherous in regard to his companion.”\r\n\r\n[16] So Pohl, who wrote a history of the “Gesellschaft,” informed\r\nThayer in a note.\r\n\r\n[17] Kalischer-Shedlock, II, p. 144.\r\n\r\n[18] The theme was the melody written for a song beginning “O Hoffnung,\r\ndu stählst die Herzen, vertreibst die Schmerzen,” from Tiedge’s\r\n“Urania.” Nohl, without giving an authority, quotes an inscription on\r\nthe autograph as follows: “Composed in the spring of 1818 by L. v.\r\nBeethoven _in doloribus_ for H. Imp. Highness the Archduke Rudolph.”\r\nThayer knows nothing about such an inscription, but it does not look\r\nlike an invention. In one of the Conversation Books somebody (Dr.\r\nDeiters opines it was Peters) writes: “Fräulein Spitzenberger played\r\nthe 40 variations by the Archduke for me yesterday. I know nothing\r\nabout it, but it seems to me that they were pretty extensively\r\ncorrected by you. The critics insist on the same thing.” We do not\r\nknow what reply Beethoven made and it is a matter of small moment. The\r\nsame comment has been called out by many a royal composition since;\r\nit was Brahms who said: “Never criticize the composition of a Royal\r\nHighness;--you do not know who may have written it!” In justice to\r\nArchduke Rudolph, however, it deserves to be mentioned that a set of\r\nvariations on a melody from Rossini’s “Zelmira” composed by him shows\r\npencil corrections in the hand of Beethoven and they are few and\r\ntrifling.\r\n\r\n[19] There is a vagueness in this passage, and especially in the words\r\nwhich precede it, which has exercised the minds of Köchel, Nohl and\r\nDeiters; but it is the opinion of the English Editor that the meaning\r\nhas been reproduced in the above translation. As the reader may,\r\nhowever, wish to form his own opinion in the matter, which is certainly\r\nmost interesting, the context is given in the original and what might\r\nbe described as an expository rendering into English: _Ich war in\r\nWien, um aus der Bibliothek I. K. H. das mir Tauglichste auszusuchen.\r\nDie Hauptabsicht ist das geschwinde Treffen und mit der bessern\r\nKunst-Vereinigung, wobei aber practische Absichten Ausnahmen machen,\r\nwofür die Alten zwar doppelt dienen, indem meistens reeller Kunstwerth\r\n(Genie hat doch nur der deutsche Händel und Seb. Bach gehabt) allein\r\nFreiheit, etc._, that is: “I was in Vienna to seek out some things best\r\nsuited to my purpose. What is chiefly needed is a quick recognition of\r\nthe essential coupled with a better union of the arts [i. e., poetry\r\nand music] in respect of which practical considerations sometimes\r\ncompel an exception, as we may learn in a twofold way from the old\r\ncomposers, where we find chiefly stress laid upon the artistically\r\nvaluable (among them only the German Handel and Seb. Bach had genius)\r\nbut freedom, etc.” Beethoven, presumably, was following the injunction\r\nnoted in the _Tagebuch_ and, for the purposes of the work which then\r\nengrossed him, was consulting authorities on ecclesiastical music.\r\nThat his mind was full of his Mass is indicated by the somewhat\r\nirrelevant quotation from the text of the _Credo_. Was he not essaying\r\na union between the technical perfection of the old masters and a more\r\ntruthful, or literal, illustration of the missal text, wherefor freedom\r\nwas necessary?\r\n\r\n[20] The picture is now preserved among the rest of the relics which\r\nSchindler deposited in Berlin.\r\n\r\n[21] See Kalischer-Shedlock, II, p. 151.\r\n\r\n[22] “Hol Euch der Teufel! B’hüt Euch Gott!”\r\n\r\n[23] Marx published it for the first time in _facsimile_ in the\r\nappendix of Vol. II of his biography of Beethoven. In the Collected\r\nWorks it appears on page 275, Series 25.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\n    The Years 1820 and 1821--End of the Guardianship Litigation--A\r\n    Costly Victory--E. T. A. Hoffmann--Financial Troubles--Adagios and\r\n    English Hymn-tunes--Arrested as a Vagrant--Negotiations for the\r\n    Mass in D--The Last Pianoforte Sonatas.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEPARTURE OF OLD FRIENDS]\r\n\r\nAlmost involuntarily, in passing in review the incidents of the year\r\nwhose story has just been told and projecting a glance into the\r\nnear future, the question arises: Where, in these moments of doubt,\r\nill-health, trial, vexation of spirit and torment of body were the\r\nold friends of Beethoven who in the earlier years had stood by him\r\nfaithfully and lovingly? Where was Stephan von Breuning? Alas! he\r\nseems to have been an early sacrifice to Beethoven’s obstinate course\r\nin respect of his nephew. Schindler says that he had advised against\r\nthe adoption of the boy and thus wounded Beethoven in his most\r\nsensitive part. The temporary estrangement began in 1817. Some others\r\nof the old friends may have been rebuffed in like manner; some, like\r\nthe faithful seneschal, Zmeskall, were ill; some were absent from\r\nVienna--Count Brunswick, Schuppanzigh; some were dead; in some the\r\nflames of friendship may have died down because there was so little\r\nin Beethoven’s public life to challenge their sympathy and support.\r\nCount Lichnowsky has dropped out of the narrative and does not appear\r\nfor some years. What had happened to the ardent friend of the youthful\r\ndays, Count Waldstein? There is no answer. Once a Conversation Book\r\nawakens curiosity and a hope. Somebody warns Beethoven in a public\r\nplace not to speak so loud, as everybody is listening. “Count Waldstein\r\nis sitting near; where does he live?” Beethoven’s answer is unrecorded\r\nand thus passes the only opportunity which the known material offers\r\nfrom which might have been learned what caused the death of that\r\nbeautiful friendship. Bernard, Schindler, Oliva, Peters and Bach were\r\nnear to him, and the last was of incalculable value to him in his\r\ngreat trial. But could they replace those who were gone?\r\n\r\nBeethoven was become a lonely man--an enforced seeker of solitude. No\r\ndoubt many who would have been glad to give him their friendship were\r\ndeterred by the wide-spread reports of his suspicious, unapproachable,\r\nalmost repellant nature. But a miracle happens. Driven in upon\r\nhimself by the forces which seem to have been arrayed against\r\nhim, introspection opens wider and wider to him the doors of that\r\nimagination which in its creative function, as Ruskin tells us, is “an\r\neminent beholder of things when and where they are not; a seer that is,\r\nin the prophetic sense, calling the things that are not as though they\r\nwere; and for ever delighting to dwell on that which is not tangibly\r\npresent.” Now he proclaims a new evangel, illustrates a higher union of\r\nbeauty and truthfulness of expression, exalts art till it enters the\r\nrealm of religion.\r\n\r\nIn the _Tagebuch_ there stands a bold inscription written in February\r\nof the year 1820: “The moral law in us, and the starry sky above\r\nus--Kant.”[24] This and two other citations, the first of which\r\nBeethoven surely culled from some book, also deserve to be set down\r\nhere as mottoes applicable to the creative work which occupied his mind\r\nduring the year and thereafter:\r\n\r\n    ’Tis said that art is long and life is fleeting:--\r\n      Nay; life is long and brief the span of art!\r\n    If e’er her breath vouchsafes with gods a meeting,\r\n      A moment’s favor ’tis of which we’ve had a part.\r\n\r\n    The world is a king and desires flattery in return for favor; but\r\n    true art is perverse and will not submit to the mould of flattery.\r\n    Famous artists always labor under an embarrassment;--therefore,\r\n    first works are the best, though they may have sprung from dark\r\n    ground.\r\n\r\nWe can only record the fact that Beethoven began the year 1820, as\r\nhe had begun its immediate predecessor, by sending a New Year’s\r\ngreeting to the august pupil who was now almost continually in his\r\nmind--Archduke Rudolph, soon to be Archbishop and Cardinal[25]--before\r\ntaking up the story of the incubus which oppressed the composer’s\r\nmind, the clog which impeded his creative activities during much of\r\nthe year--the legal proceedings concerning the guardianship of nephew\r\nKarl. Fortunately for the tinge of these pages the end is not distant.\r\n\r\nTwo applications made by Beethoven to the Court of Magistrates had been\r\ndenied and he now asked for a review of these decisions by the Court\r\nof Appeals. The action of the Magistracy had grievously pained him, so\r\nhe informed the superior tribunal, and not only had his rights been\r\nset aside, but no regard had been shown for the welfare of his nephew.\r\nAgainst this he now sought relief, and he set forth his grievances: (1)\r\nHe was testamentary appointee and the _Landrecht_ had confirmed him and\r\nexcluded the mother; circumstances compelling his absence from Vienna,\r\nhe had arranged that Herr Nussböck should be appointed guardian _ad\r\ninterim_; back permanently in the city, his nephew’s welfare required\r\nthat he resume the guardianship; (2) The higher education which his\r\nnephew’s talents demanded neither the mother nor Nussböck could\r\ndirect--the former because she was a woman and had conducted herself in\r\na manner which had led the _Landrecht_ to exclude her, Nussböck because\r\nhe was too much occupied with his duties as Municipal Sequestrator and,\r\nhaving been no more than a paper-maker, he did not possess the insight\r\nand judgment essential to the scientific education of the ward. (3)\r\nHaving no child of his own, his hopes were set on the boy, who was\r\nunusually talented, yet he had been told that he had been held back\r\na year in his studies and that owing to a lack of funds he was to be\r\ntaken from the institution in which he had been placed and given in the\r\ncare of his mother; by her mismanagement the boy would be sacrificed,\r\nit being the aim of the mother to expend his share of the pension\r\nmoney on herself. He had declared to the Magistracy his willingness\r\nto defray the costs at the institute and also to engage other masters\r\nfor the boy. Being “somewhat hard of hearing” communication with\r\nhim was difficult and therefore he had asked that a co-guardian\r\nbe appointed in the person of Herr Peters, Prince Lobkowitzsian\r\nCouncillor, whose knowledge and moral character would assure such a\r\ntraining and education as were justified by the boy’s capacity. “I know\r\nof no more sacred duty than the care and education of a child,” he\r\nobserves. He would offer no objection to the mother’s having a “sort of\r\njoint-guardianship,” but its duties and privileges should be limited to\r\nher visiting him and learning what plans were making for his education;\r\nto permit more would be to compass the ruin of the boy.[26]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AN APPEAL TO A HIGHER COURT]\r\n\r\nThis petition was filed on January 7, 1820; three days later the\r\nAppellate Court commanded the Magistracy to file a report of the\r\nproceedings had before it, together with all minutes and documents. The\r\nMagistracy complied on February 5, citing its decision of September 17,\r\n1819, and defending its action on the grounds that (a) Beethoven, owing\r\nto his deafness and his hatred of the mother of the ward, was incapable\r\nof acting as guardian; (b) the guardianship belonged to the mother by\r\nright of law; (c) the commission of an act of infidelity against her\r\nhusband in 1811, for which she had suffered punishment, was no longer a\r\nbar; (d) none of the alleged “injurious disturbances and interferences”\r\nhad been definitely set forth or proven:\r\n\r\n    If under injurious disturbances we are to understand that the\r\n    mother is desirous to see her child once every 14 days or 4 weeks,\r\n    or to convince herself about the wear and cleanliness of his\r\n    clothing, or to learn of his conduct toward his teachers, these can\r\n    appear injurious only in the eyes of the appellant; the rest of the\r\n    world, however, would find it amiss in a mother if she made inquiry\r\n    concerning her child only once a fortnight or month.\r\n\r\nAnswering the second charge, the magistrates urged that the appellant\r\nseemed to ask of the mother and other guardian that they themselves\r\neducate the boy in the sciences. For this not even the appellant was\r\nfitted, at least he had not demonstrated such a fitness; he had left\r\nthe preparation for the higher studies to others and this the mother\r\nand guardian could also do, having, indeed, a better plan, which was to\r\nsend the boy to the R. I. Convict, where he would surely make better\r\nprogress at smaller expense. _Ad tertium_, the failure of the boy to\r\nadvance in his classes could not be laid to the mother or guardian, but\r\nmust be charged against the appellant, who had taken the boy away from\r\nhis studies for the university after two months, kept him at home three\r\nmonths, and sent him to another institution of learning at the end of\r\nJune; naturally enough he lost a school year.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals demanded a more explicit report, which the\r\nMagistracy filed on February 28, taking advantage of the opportunity to\r\nreview the proceedings had before the _Landrecht_ from the beginning,\r\nand to make severe strictures on the conduct of Beethoven in filing\r\nan exhibit (F) with his petition in support of which no evidence was\r\noffered, though because of it the _Landrecht_ was asked to exclude the\r\nmother from the guardianship which belonged to her under the law. Again\r\nwe quote:\r\n\r\n    This exclusion can have nothing for its foundation except the\r\n    misdemeanor of which the mother was guilty in 1811, for all the\r\n    rest contained in appellant’s exhibit F is unproven chatter to\r\n    which the _Landrecht_ could give no consideration, but which gives\r\n    speaking proof of how passionately and inimically the appellant\r\n    has always acted, and still acts, towards the mother, how little\r\n    he recks of tearing open wounds that were healed, since after\r\n    having endured punishment she stood rehabilitated; and yet he\r\n    reproaches her with a transgression for which she had atoned years\r\n    before, which had been pardoned by the injured husband himself who\r\n    petitioned for leniency in her sentence and who had declared her\r\n    capable and fit for the guardianship of his son in his last will\r\n    and testament, directing that the son be not taken away from his\r\n    mother. Regardless of this the appellant last year, certainly not\r\n    in the interest of the boy’s welfare, inasmuch as we have excellent\r\n    educational institutions here, but only to pain the mother, to\r\n    tear the heart out of her bosom, attempted to send him out of the\r\n    country to Landshut. Fortunately the government authorities, acting\r\n    on information derived from this court, frustrated the plan by\r\n    refusing a passport.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEPRAVITY OF KARL’S MOTHER]\r\n\r\nLet us try now to take a dispassionate view of the case as thus far\r\npresented in the pleadings and documents. Not only the law of nature\r\nbut the laws of the land justified the mother in asserting her right\r\nto look after the physical well-being of her child and seeking to\r\nenforce it. Dr. Bach seems to have impressed that fact upon Beethoven,\r\nwherefore he declares his willingness in the bill of appeal to\r\nassociate her with himself in the guardianship to that extent. That the\r\nMagistrates displayed unusual, not to say unjudicial zeal in her behalf\r\nwhile defending their own course is indubitable; but we are in no\r\nposition to judge of the propriety of their course, which seems to have\r\nbeen in harmony with the judicial procedure of the place and period,\r\nleast of all to condemn them, so long as it was permitted them so to\r\ndo, for having made a stout resistance when their acts were impugned\r\nin the appeal to the higher court. The “Exhibit F,” filed in the\r\nproceedings before the _Landrecht_, has not been found and its contents\r\ncan only be guessed at from the allusions to it in the documents.\r\nObviously it contained aspersions on the moral character of Madame van\r\nBeethoven, and it may have been, nay, probably was, true that they were\r\nunsupported by evidence and therefore undeserving of consideration in\r\na court either of law or equity. Perhaps they were not susceptible of\r\nlegal proof. It has been thought that Beethoven felt some hesitancy in\r\nflaunting evidence of his sister-in-law’s infamy in the face of the\r\nworld,[27] but he certainly showed no disposition to spare her in his\r\nletters, nor did he hesitate to accuse her of unmentionable things\r\nby innuendo. In a Conversation Book of this year (1820) he writes of\r\nher that she was “born for intrigue, accomplished in deceit, mistress\r\nof all the arts of dissimulation.” On the other hand, it is singular\r\nthat the Magistrates in their final effort to justify their course\r\nhave nothing to say about the present moral standing of the woman\r\nwhose legal and natural rights they claimed to be upholding. Were they\r\nin ignorance of what we now know, namely, that her conduct had not\r\nonly been reprehensible in 1811 (though condoned by her husband) but\r\ncontinued so after her husband’s death? Schindler says that she gave\r\nbirth to a child while the case was pending, and that is confirmed by\r\na statement of Nephew Karl’s widow,[28] that in her old age Madame van\r\nBeethoven lived in Baden with this illegitimate daughter, who was also\r\na dissolute woman.\r\n\r\nBut there are many anomalous things to the studious mind in the\r\nproceedings which we are reporting, which differ greatly from anything\r\nwhich could happen in a court of chancery or probate in Great Britain\r\nor America to-day. It is certainly repugnant to our present legal\r\nethics that having filed a petition to reverse the action of one\r\ncourt Beethoven should not only have written private letters to a\r\njudge of the court of review, pleading his case on personal grounds,\r\nbut that his counsel should have advised him to visit members of the\r\nhigher court to present arguments in his behalf. But, no doubt, this\r\nwas consistent with the customs of Austria a century ago; and it is\r\nwhat happened. Beethoven writes to Karl Winter, an _Appellationsrat_,\r\nand his lawyer tells him to engage him and one of his colleagues,\r\nSchmerling, in conversation on the subject. Perhaps Winter himself\r\nquestioned the propriety of the proceeding, for in a Conversation Book\r\nsomebody, who had evidently acted as messenger in the delivery of\r\nthe letter, writes: “I gave it to Herr v. Winter; he kept me waiting\r\nand then said that he could give no answer, nor involve himself in a\r\ncorrespondence.” The letter in question was written on March 6. In it\r\nBeethoven says that he had prepared a memorial which he would place in\r\nhis hands in a few days. From the outline given it is plain that the\r\nmemorial contained a review of the case since the death of Beethoven’s\r\nbrother. It had been prepared, said Beethoven, “believing that I\r\nowed it to myself to expose the falsity of the many slanders which\r\nhave been uttered against me and to lay bare the intrigues of Madame\r\nvan Beethoven against me to the injury of her own child, as also to\r\nplace in its proper light the conduct of the Magistrates’ Court.” He\r\ncharges that the Magistrates had summoned the widow and her son to a\r\nhearing without his knowledge and, as his nephew had told him, he had\r\nbeen urged and led on by his mother to make false accusations against\r\nhim. He had also forwarded a document which proved the wavering and\r\npartisan conduct of the Magistrates. He repeats the charge about his\r\nnephew’s failure to advance in his studies and adds that the boy had\r\nhad a hemorrhage which, had he not been on hand, might almost have cost\r\nhim his life. These things were not attributable to Herr Tuscher for\r\nthe reason that the Magistrates had given him too little support and\r\nhe could not proceed with sufficient energy--this the writer could do\r\nin his capacity of uncle, guardian and defrayer of expenses. He asks\r\nthat if it becomes necessary he and his nephew be examined, cites his\r\nexpenditures to keep the boy two years in an educational institution,\r\nsaying that he had received nothing from the widow in nearly fourteen\r\nmonths but would continue to pay the cost unselfishly in the future,\r\nand had set apart 4,000 florins which was on deposit in bank and was to\r\ngo to his nephew on his death. Moreover, he had expectations from his\r\nrelations with the Archbishop of Olmütz, etc.\r\n\r\nThe case was prepared shrewdly, carefully and most discreetly by Dr.\r\nBach, who seems to have exerted an admirable influence on Beethoven\r\nat this crisis. The nature of his advice may be learned from the\r\ncommunication of Bernard in one of the recorded conversations. Bernard\r\nis writing, and evidently giving the result of a consultation with\r\nDr. Bach. The Court of Appeals would ask another report from the\r\nMagistrates and on its receipt would adjudge the case. Nussböck,\r\nwho Dr. Bach said was willing, should voluntarily retire from the\r\nguardianship. Beethoven was asked as to the appointment of Tuscher;\r\nhad he resigned permanently or only temporarily in favor of Tuscher,\r\nthe better to accomplish the nephew’s removal from his mother? In what\r\nmanner had Tuscher abdicated, and had the Magistracy informed Beethoven\r\nof the fact? It was necessary, said the adviser, to proceed with\r\nmoderation in all things so as to avoid the appearance of malice, and\r\nthe mother should not be assailed if it was at all avoidable, stress\r\nbeing laid only on the fact that as a woman she ought not to have the\r\ndirection of the education of a boy of Karl’s age, not having the\r\nrequisite fitness. It would also be necessary for him, in case he were\r\nasked, to state his readiness to defray the cost of the boy’s education\r\nin the future and this, if the worst came to the worst, might be\r\nfollowed by a threat to withdraw wholly from his care. Reproaches might\r\nbe made against him concerning the period when he had the boy with him,\r\nthe priests having taken to meddling in the matter, and it would be\r\nwell in the future not to take the boy to public eating-houses where he\r\nwould be observed and scandal fomented.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: APPOINTMENT OF A JOINT GUARDIANSHIP]\r\n\r\nBach seems to have advised Beethoven to visit two of the judges, Winter\r\nand Schmerling, and himself had an interview with the boy, who told his\r\nuncle what the advocate had questioned him about. For the nonce Karl\r\nwas on his good behavior. Blöchlinger reported favorably on his studies\r\nto Bernard, and in a Conversation Book the boy apologized to his\r\nuncle for some statements derogatory to him which he had made to the\r\nMagistrates. “She promised me so many things,” he said, “that I could\r\nnot resist her; I am sorry that I was so weak at the time and beg your\r\nforgiveness; I will not again permit myself to be led astray. I did not\r\nknow what results might follow when I told the Magistrates what I did;\r\nbut if there is another examination I will retract all the falsehoods\r\nI uttered.” The magisterial commission which followed on March 29, had\r\nplainly been held at the instance of the Appellate Court. Beethoven\r\nwas solemnly admonished, and in answer to questions declared: (1) that\r\nhe still demanded the guardianship of his nephew under the will and\r\nwould not relinquish his claim; (2) that he requested the appointment\r\nof Councillor Peters as associate guardian; (3) that he demanded that\r\nMadame van Beethoven be excluded from the guardianship as she had been\r\nby the _Landrecht_, and (4) he reiterated his readiness to provide\r\nfinancially for the care of his ward; he would accept an associate\r\nguardian, but not a sole guardian, as he was convinced that no guardian\r\nwould care for his nephew as well as he. In insisting on a renewed\r\ndeclaration on these points it is likely that the Court of Appeals\r\nhad some hope that Beethoven might voluntarily renounce or modify\r\nhis claims or the Magistrates recede from their attitude. Neither\r\ncontingency occurred, however, and on April 8 the reviewing court\r\nissued its decree in Beethoven’s favor, he and Peters being appointed\r\njoint guardians (_gemeinschaftliche Vormünde_), the mother and Nussböck\r\nbeing deposed. The widow now played her last card:--she appealed to\r\nthe Emperor, who upheld the Court of Appeals. There was nothing for\r\nthe Magistracy to do except to notify the result of the appeals to\r\nBeethoven, Madame van Beethoven, Peters and Nussböck. This was done on\r\nJuly 24.\r\n\r\nBeethoven had won at last. But at what a cost to himself, his art,\r\nthe world! What time, what labor, what energy had he not taken away\r\nfrom his artistic creations! What had he not expended in the way of\r\npeace of mind, of friendship, of physical comfort, of wear of brain\r\nand nerve-force, for the privilege of keeping the boy to himself,\r\nof watching unmolested over his physical welfare and directing his\r\nintellectual and moral training unhindered! Surely such sacrifices,\r\ninspired, as we know they were, by a transcendent sense of duty and\r\nprofoundest love, merited the rich reward of which he had dreamed--the\r\ndevotion of one who ought to have been all that a son could be, the\r\nhappiness of seeing the object of his love grow into a brilliant man\r\nand a useful citizen. Was it vouchsafed him? Let us not in the midst\r\nof his present happiness look too far into the future. Now his joy is\r\nunbounded. He breaks into a jubilation when, in conveying the news\r\nto Pinterics--that Pinterics who had sung the bass in “Ta, ta, ta,”\r\nin honor of Mälzel: “Dr. Bach was my representative in this affair\r\nand this Brook (_Bach_) was joined by the sea, lightning, thunder, a\r\ntempest, and the magisterial brigantine suffered complete shipwreck!”\r\nSchindler says that “his happiness over the triumph which he had\r\nwon over wickedness and trickery, but also because of the supposed\r\nsalvation from physical danger of his talented nephew, was so great\r\nthat he worked but little or not at all all summer--though this was\r\nperhaps more apparent than real, the sketchbooks disclosing from now on\r\nonly empty pages.” A wise qualification, for though the sketchbooks may\r\nhave been empty, there is evidence enough elsewhere of hard work. Yet\r\nthe Mass was not finished, and for this unfortunate circumstance the\r\nguardianship trial was no doubt largely to blame. To this subject we\r\nshall return presently.\r\n\r\nOf Peters, who was appointed joint guardian with Beethoven of the\r\nnephew, little is known beyond what we learn from Beethoven and\r\nPeters’s contributions to the Conversation Books. He was a tutor in\r\nthe house of Prince Lobkowitz and had been on terms of friendship with\r\nBeethoven since 1816; his appointment by the court is a confirmation\r\nof Beethoven’s tribute to him as a man of intellectual parts and of\r\ngood moral character. His wife had a good voice and was a great admirer\r\nof Beethoven, who presented her with a copy of the song cycle “An die\r\nferne Geliebte.” A letter, once in the possession of John Ella in\r\nLondon, which may be of earlier date than 1821, to which year it is,\r\nhowever, most naturally assigned in view of the allusion to the “state\r\nburden” (the nephew), runs as follows:\r\n\r\n    How are you? Are you well or ill? How is your wife? Permit me to\r\n    sing something for you:\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Canon (Lively)\r\n\r\n    Saint Peter was a rock! St.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Canon (Drawn out and dragged)\r\n\r\n    Bernardus was a Saint? Ber-]\r\n\r\n    How are your young princes? Will you be at home this afternoon at 5\r\n    o’clock? Perhaps I’ll visit you together with my _state_ burden.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BAD CONDUCT OF NEPHEW KARL]\r\n\r\nNephew Karl remained at Blöchlinger’s institute and continued to cause\r\nworry and anxiety to his uncle. Reports concerning his conduct and\r\nstudies were variable from different persons and at different times.\r\nBlöchlinger complained that he needed constant supervision: “Had we\r\nnot always been strict with him, he would not be where he is now.”\r\nA cleric declares that he was at heart not a bad child but had been\r\nharmed by bad examples. “Karl has little feeling and in spite of the\r\nknowledge for which he is praised he has no reasoning powers,” writes\r\nan unidentified person in the Conversation Book, surely not to the\r\nsatisfaction of the uncle who was always setting forth his nephew’s\r\nexceptional talent. In June somebody else (this time it may have\r\nbeen Oliva) feels constrained to write: “The boy lies every time he\r\nopens his mouth.” The “terrible occurrence” which had almost crushed\r\nBeethoven in December, 1818, repeats itself, fortunately without such\r\ndire results to the too sympathetic uncle: In June, instead of coming\r\nto an oral examination, Karl ran away to his mother. Madame Blöchlinger\r\nhad to take a coach and servant and bring him back to the school; and\r\nto get him away from Madame van Beethoven, who was disposed to keep\r\nhim in concealment, had to promise to see to it that he should not\r\nbe punished for his naughtiness. Now Blöchlinger, who says that the\r\npresence of Madame van Beethoven “poisons the air,” wants the woman\r\nexcluded from his house and asks for a power of attorney to call in\r\nthe help of the police every time that Karl shall go to his mother,\r\nwhom he calls a “notorious strumpet,” of whose presence in his house\r\nhe must needs be ashamed. All this was told to Beethoven by Bernard,\r\nwho had learned it from Blöchlinger. Beethoven went for advice to Bach,\r\nwho told his client that it was impracticable to get a judicial writ\r\nagainst the mother enjoining her from meeting her son, and impossible\r\nto prevent secret meetings and secret correspondence. The practical\r\nsolution of the problem was to have Blöchlinger refuse to admit the\r\nwoman to his institute and compel her to see Karl at his uncle’s home.\r\nThis would serve the purpose to some extent, as the mother did not like\r\nto meet her brother-in-law.\r\n\r\nThe enthronization of Beethoven’s imperial pupil as Archbishop of\r\nOlmütz took place on March 20. The Mass which was to have been the\r\ncomposer’s tribute was still unfinished. The reader knows why, or at\r\nleast has been provided with an opportunity to form an opinion as to\r\nthe reason. It may have been for the purpose of offering an explanation\r\nto the new dignitary of the church, that Beethoven sought an audience\r\nas he states in a letter of April 3. The Archducal Archbishop had gone\r\nto Olmütz and Beethoven wants to know his plans for the immediate\r\nfuture. He had heard that H. I. H. was to return to Vienna in May,\r\nbut also that he intended to be absent for a year and a half. If so,\r\nBeethoven deplores that he has made plans for himself which are unwise.\r\nHe begs H. I. H. not to give credence to the false reports concerning\r\nhimself (Beethoven) which might reach his ears: “If Y. I. H. calls me\r\none of your most treasured objects, I can honestly say that Y. I. H.\r\nis to me one of the most treasured objects in the universe. Although\r\nI am no courtier, I believe that Y. I. H. has learned to know me well\r\nenough to know that no cold interest, but a sincere affection, has\r\nalways attached me to yourself and inspired me; and I might well say\r\nthat Blondel was found long ago, and if no Richard is to be found in\r\nthe world for me, God will be my Richard.” He has evidently concerned\r\nhimself about the music at the court in Olmütz: “It appears to me that\r\nmy idea to maintain a quartet will certainly be the best thing to do.\r\nIf there are already productions on a large scale in Olmütz, something\r\nadmirable might arise in Moravia through a quartet.” He advises\r\nhis pupil, in case it is his purpose to return in May, to keep his\r\ncompositions till then so as to play them first to him; but if his stay\r\nis to be longer, he will receive the compositions with the greatest\r\npleasure and seek to guide H. I. H. “to the highest peaks of Parnassus.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A PUNNING CANON ON HOFMANN]\r\n\r\nA reference to himself as one who was at court yet not a courtier had\r\nbeen made by Beethoven in an earlier letter. This play on words seems\r\nto have been much in his head about this time and it is small wonder\r\nthat when an opportunity offered for the employment of the pun in a\r\ncanon it should have been embraced; in fact, it looks as if possibly he\r\nhad strained for the occasion, unless it should appear from evidence\r\nyet to be found that “One who was named Hoffmann,” in Beethoven’s\r\nwords, was, as was long believed, the redoubtable E. T. A. Hoffmann,\r\nwho had surely deserved the tribute contained in a canon which\r\nBeethoven wrote at this time. In the Conversation Book used in March,\r\n1820, a strange hand writes: “In the _Phantasie-Stücke_ by Hoffmann,\r\nyou are often spoken of. Hoffmann was musical director in Bamberg; he\r\nis now Government Councillor. Operas of his composition are performed\r\nin Berlin.” Beethoven remarks, in writing: “Hofmann du bist kein\r\n_Hofmann_.” Later in a conversation held at table, these words occur\r\ntwice: “Hŏfmānn ÷ sei ja kein Hōfmănn--nein ÷ ÷ ÷ ich heisse Hŏfmānn\r\nund bin kein Hōfmănn.” These words are preceded by a measure of music,\r\nthe beginning of the canon in question. Did Beethoven thus honor the\r\nfantastic poet, musician, novelist, essayist, singer, scene-painter and\r\ntheatrical manager who had shown such keen critical appreciation of\r\nhis symphonies? It was long a pleasure to believe so and natural, too,\r\nuntil Nottebohm came with his iconoclastic evidence to the contrary.\r\nOn March 23 Beethoven had written a letter to Hoffmann, expressing his\r\ngratification at having won the good opinion of a man gifted with such\r\nexcellent attributes as Hoffmann possessed. Had he written the canon\r\nat this time he would surely have enclosed it in this letter and then,\r\nsince it was preserved among Hoffmann’s papers, it would have been\r\nfound and given to the world with the letter. But Beethoven kept the\r\ncanon in his mind or had a copy of it, and printed it in 1825, when B.\r\nSchott’s Sons in Mayence asked him for a contribution to their musical\r\njournal “Cäcilia,” which had been founded a year before. Now comes\r\nNottebohm with his evidence in the case. A man named Gross was once\r\nthe owner of the autograph and his son told Nottebohm that it had been\r\nwritten in the Matschaker Hof, a tavern at which Beethoven was dining\r\nat the time, and referred to a church musician named Vincenz Hoffmann,\r\nas the informant remembered the name. Nottebohm looked through the\r\nofficial lists of musicians in Vienna in the first decades of the\r\ncentury; he did not find a Vincenz, but did find a Joachim Hoffmann who\r\nmight have been an acquaintance of Beethoven’s; and so he set him down\r\nas the recipient of the composer’s tribute.[29]\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1820, Beethoven went to Mödling again, but he did not\r\ntake the lodgings in the Harfner house for the very sufficient reason\r\nthat the proprietor had served notice on him in 1819, that he could\r\nnot have it longer on account of the noisy disturbances which had\r\ntaken place there. He took a house instead in the Babenbergerstrasse\r\nand paid twelve florins extra for the use of a balcony which commanded\r\na view which was essential to his happiness. He takes the baths and\r\nreceives a visit from his nephew, who probably stays with him during\r\nhis school vacation; at any rate, the boy does not return to Vienna\r\nuntil October 5, on which day the Giannatasios, making an excursion\r\nto Mödling, meet him with Karl driving to town. There is at this time\r\nconsiderable talk in the Conversation Book of publishing a complete\r\nedition of Beethoven’s works. Bernard, probably, tells him that Steiner\r\nis already counting on it and Schindler, who is enthusiastic over the\r\nproject, gives it as his opinion that arrangements must be made with\r\na Vienna publisher so as to avoid voluminous correspondence. Somebody\r\nremarks: “Eckstein will so arrange it that you will always get all\r\nthe profits and will also publish your future works as your property.\r\nHe thinks that every fourth or fifth piece should be a new one.” The\r\nplan appealed strongly to Beethoven, but nothing came of it at the\r\ntime, though we shall hear of it later. It was the discussion of it,\r\nprobably, by his friends which brought out a letter from Beethoven to\r\nHaslinger, “best of Adjutants,” asking him to decide a bet. Beethoven\r\nhad wagered 10 florins that it was not true that the Steiners had\r\nbeen obliged to pay Artaria 2000 florins damages for having published\r\nMozart’s works, which were reprinted universally.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of October, Beethoven returned to Vienna and took\r\nlodgings at No. 244 Hauptstrasse in the Landstrasse, “the large house\r\nof the Augustinians” beside the church. There he was visited by Dr.\r\nW. Chr. Müller of Bremen, a philologist and musical amateur who had\r\nlong admired Beethoven and, with the help of his “Family Concerts,”\r\nestablished in 1782, had created such a cult for Beethoven’s music as\r\nexisted in no city in Germany in the second decade of the nineteenth\r\ncentury--according to Schindler. Müller’s daughter Elise played the\r\nsonatas exceptionally well and was largely instrumental with her father\r\nin creating this cult. Müller was making an Italian tour, visited\r\nVienna in October and November and published an account of his meetings\r\nwith Beethoven in the “Allg. Musik. Zeit.” in 1827. In this he tells\r\nof Beethoven’s freedom of speech at public eating-houses, where he\r\nwould criticize the Austrian government, the morals of the aristocracy,\r\nthe police, etc., without stint. The police paid no attention to his\r\nutterances, either because they looked upon him as a harmless fantastic\r\nor had an overwhelming respect for his artistic genius. “Hence,” says\r\nDr. Müller, “his opinion that nowhere was speech freer than in Vienna;\r\nbut his ideal of a political constitution was the English one.” It was\r\nthrough Dr. Müller that we know somewhat of Beethoven’s views on the\r\nsubject of analytical programmes. Among the zealous promoters of the\r\nBeethoven cult in Bremen, was a young poet named Dr. Karl Iken, editor\r\nof the “Bremer Zeitung,” who, inspired by the _Familien-Concerte_,\r\nconceived the idea of helping the public to an understanding of\r\nBeethoven’s music by writing programmatic expositions of the symphonies\r\nfor perusal before the concerts. Some of his lucubrations were sent\r\nto Beethoven by Dr. Müller, and aroused the composer’s ire. Schindler\r\nfound four of these “programmes” among Beethoven’s papers, and he gave\r\nthe world a specimen. In the Seventh Symphony, Dr. Iken professed to\r\nsee a political revolution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “PROGRAMME” FOR THE SEVENTH SYMPHONY]\r\n\r\n    The sign of revolt is given; there is a rushing and running about\r\n    of the multitude; an innocent man, or party, is surrounded,\r\n    overpowered after a struggle and haled before a legal tribunal.\r\n    Innocency weeps; the judge pronounces a harsh sentence; sympathetic\r\n    voices mingle in laments and denunciations--they are those of\r\n    widows and orphans; in the second part of the first movement the\r\n    parties have become equal in numbers and the magistrates are now\r\n    scarcely able to quiet the wild tumult. The uprising is suppressed,\r\n    but the people are not quieted; hope smiles cheeringly and suddenly\r\n    the voice of the people pronounces the decision in harmonious\r\n    agreement.... But now, in the last movement, the classes and the\r\n    masses mix in a variegated picture of unrestrained revelry. The\r\n    quality still speak aloofly in the wind-instruments,--strange\r\n    bacchantic madness in related chords--pauses, now here, now\r\n    there--now on a sunny hill, anon on flowery meadow where in merry\r\n    May all the jubilating children of nature vie with each other with\r\n    joyful voices--float past the fancy.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely to be wondered at that such balderdash disgusted and\r\neven enraged Beethoven. In the fall of 1819, he dictated a letter\r\nto Müller--it has, unfortunately been lost--in which he protested\r\nenergetically against such interpretations of his music. He pointed\r\nout, says Schindler, who wrote the letter for him, the errors to\r\nwhich such writings would inevitably give rise. If expositions\r\nwere necessary, they should be confined to characterization of the\r\ncomposition in general terms, which could easily and correctly be done\r\nby any educated musician.\r\n\r\nBeethoven’s complaints concerning his financial condition were chronic\r\nand did not cease even in periods where extraordinary receipts make\r\nthem difficult to understand. That the lamentations in his letters\r\nduring the two years which we have in review were well-founded,\r\nhowever, is no doubt true. With so engrossing a work as the “Missa\r\nsolemnis” on hand there could not have been much time for such\r\npotboilers as he mentions and the other sources of revenue were not\r\nmany. From the records which are at hand, we know something about a\r\nfew of his monetary transactions. On October 26, 1820, he collected\r\n300 florins on account, apparently, from Artaria and Co., through his\r\nold friend Oliva. Shortly after his return to Vienna from the country,\r\nhe asks the same firm, from which he had borrowed 750 florins,[30] for\r\na further loan of 150 to save himself the necessity of selling one\r\nof his bank shares. These shares, it will be remembered in partial\r\nextenuation or at least explanation of some of his actions which are\r\nscarcely compatible with his protestations of his unswerving honesty\r\nin business transactions, had been set apart by him as his nephew’s\r\nlegacy and he clung to them as to a sacred pledge. He promises to repay\r\nArtaria in three months and meanwhile to send him a composition in one,\r\ntwo or more movements, without honorarium. An incident which shows\r\nhim in an unamiable light is connected with his financial relations\r\nwith the publisher Steiner. On December 29, 1820, Steiner wrote him a\r\nletter which did not see the public eye until published in the “Neue\r\nFreie Presse” newspaper of Vienna on August 17, 1900. Steiner had sent\r\nBeethoven a dun, or at least a statement of account, and Beethoven had,\r\nevidently, been both rude and unreasonable in his reply. We quote from\r\nSteiner:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INDEBTEDNESS TO STEINER]\r\n\r\n    I cannot rest content with your remarks concerning the account\r\n    sent you; for the cash money loaned you I have charged you only 6%\r\n    interest, while for the money which you deposited with me I paid\r\n    you 8% promptly in advance and also repaid the capital promptly.\r\n    What is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander (_Was also\r\n    dem Einen recht ist, muss dem Andern billig sein_). I am not in a\r\n    position to lend money without interest. As a friend I came to your\r\n    help in need, I trusted your word of honor and believe that I have\r\n    not been importunate, nor have I plagued you in any way; wherefore\r\n    I must solemnly protest against your upbraidings. If you recall\r\n    that my loan to you was made in part 5 years ago, you will yourself\r\n    confess that I am not an urgent creditor. I would spare you even\r\n    now and wait patiently if I were not on my honor in need of cash\r\n    for my business. If I were less convinced that you are really in a\r\n    position to give me relief and able to keep your _word of honor_\r\n    I would, difficult as it would be for me, right gladly remain\r\n    patient a while longer; but when I remember that I myself returned\r\n    to you 4,000 florins, conventional coin, or 10,000 florins, Vienna\r\n    Standard, as capital 17 months ago and at your request did not\r\n    deduct the amount due me, it is doubly painful to me now to be\r\n    embarrassed because of my good will and my trust in your word of\r\n    honor. Every man knows best where the shoe pinches and I am in this\r\n    case; wherefore I conjure you again not to leave me in the lurch\r\n    and to find means to liquidate my account as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n    As for the rest I beg you to accept from me the compliments of the\r\n    season together with the request that you continue to give me your\r\n    favor and friendship. It will rejoice me if you keep your word\r\n    and honor me soon with a visit; it rejoices me more that you have\r\n    happily withstood your illness and are again restored to health.\r\n    God preserve you long in health, contentment and enjoyment, this is\r\n    the wish of your wholly devoted\r\n\r\n  S. A. Steiner.\r\n\r\nThe letter contains pencil memoranda by Beethoven. He has evidently\r\nadded together the various sums which he owes Steiner and they amount\r\nto 2420 florins W. W. He remarks that 1300 florins was received\r\n“probably” in 1816 or 1817; 750 florins “perhaps” in 1819; 300\r\nflorins “are debts which I assumed for Madame van Beethoven and\r\ncan be chargeable for only a few years; the 70 florins may have\r\nbeen for myself in 1819. Payment may be made of 1200 florins a year\r\nin semi-annual payments.” A further memorandum on the cover notes\r\nSteiner’s willingness to accept payments on April 15 and October\r\n15, 1821. The settlements seem to have been made. On April 1, 1821,\r\nBeethoven collected 600 florins from the estate of Kinsky, being\r\none-half of the annuity for the year September 1820 to September 1821.\r\nHe also persuaded his friend Franz Brentano to advance him money on\r\nthe amount for which he sold the “Missa Solemnis” to Simrock in Bonn,\r\nthough he did not give him the Mass for publication in the end. But\r\nthis is a matter which can be better discussed in connection with the\r\nincidents in the history of the compositions which fall within the\r\npresent period.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of the year 1821 found him still at his home in the\r\nsuburb Landstrasse, and, it would seem, working as hard as his health\r\npermitted. When he went to the country for the summer he went to\r\nUnterdöbling and thence, after September, to Baden to take a cure\r\nprescribed by his physician, Dr. Staudenheimer. In Baden he lived\r\nin the Rathshausgasse. He had suffered from rheumatism during the\r\npreceding winter and now became a victim of jaundice, for which, no\r\ndoubt, he was sent to Baden, though he had gotten rid of the disease\r\nto some extent at least by the end of August. The cure prescribed by\r\nStaudenheimer was more severe than he could endure and, as he writes\r\nto Franz Brentano on November 12, 1821, he had to “flee to Vienna,”\r\nwhere he was more comfortable. The attack of jaundice may have been an\r\n_arant-courier_ of the disease of the liver which brought him to the\r\ngrave six years later. He expresses a fear in a letter to the Archduke\r\n(July 18, 1821) that it might prevent him for a long time from waiting\r\nupon his pupil. There is the usual monetary complaint in the letter,\r\nwhich concludes with: “God who knows my heart and how sacredly I\r\nfulfill all the duties commanded by humanity, God and nature will some\r\nday free me from this affliction.”\r\n\r\nIn 1820 the voice of an old English admirer reaches him with a request\r\nwhich must have seemed strange to him. William Gardiner, as has been\r\ntold in the chapter in the first volume of this work devoted to the\r\ncompositions of the Bonn period, was one of the first proclaimers of\r\nBeethoven’s evangel in England. He had now compiled and composed a sort\r\nof _pasticcio_, an oratorio entitled “Judah,” piecing the work out\r\nwith original compositions where he had failed to find music written\r\nby others which he could use. In his book “Music and Friends” (III,\r\n377) he relates that he had hoped to get an original composition for\r\n“Judah” in the shape of an appropriate overture, and to this end had\r\nwritten a letter to Beethoven and forwarded it to Vienna through Baron\r\nNeumann of the Austrian Embassy, who, on receiving it, had remarked\r\nthat it was doubtful if an answer would be received, as Beethoven held\r\nno communication with the world. Gardiner’s letter was as follows:\r\n\r\n  To Louis van Beethoven.\r\n\r\n  Dear Sir:\r\n\r\n    At the house of Lady Bowater in Leicestershire in 1796, I met with\r\n    your Trio in E-flat (for Violin, Viola and Bass). Its originality\r\n    and beauty gave me inexpressible delight; indeed it was a new\r\n    sense to me. Ever since I have anxiously endeavoured to procure\r\n    your compositions as much so as the war could permit. Allow me\r\n    to present to you the first volume of my “Sacred Melodies” which\r\n    contain your divine Adagios appropriated to the British church. I\r\n    am now engaged upon a work entitled “The Oratorio of Judah” giving\r\n    a history of that peculiar people from the Jewish scriptures. The\r\n    object of this letter is to express a hope that I may induce you to\r\n    compose an Overture for this work upon which you can bring all the\r\n    force of your sublime imagination (if it please you) in the key of\r\n    D minor. For this service my friend Mr. Clementi will accept your\r\n    draft upon him for one hundred guineas.\r\n\r\n  I have the honour to be, dear Sir,\r\n  Your faithful servant\r\n  William Gardiner.\r\n\r\nThere is no date, but as “Judah” was criticized in “The Musical Review”\r\nin 1821, it is presumable that the letter was written in 1820. Gardiner\r\ndeplores the fact that he received no reply from Beethoven, although\r\nthe Empress had thanked him for a copy of the “Sacred Melodies” which\r\nhe had sent to her. Evidently he did not realize that Beethoven was not\r\nthe man to feel complimented by having his “divine Adagios” turned into\r\nhymn-tunes. An occurrence which may have cost Beethoven a pang was the\r\nloss of his faithful helper Oliva, who took his passport in December,\r\n1820, and went to St. Petersburg, where he settled as a teacher of\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A PORTRAIT PAINTED BY STIELER]\r\n\r\nAnother of the portraits of Beethoven which have been made familiar\r\nby reproductions was painted in 1820, though begun in 1819. Joseph\r\nStieler, who enjoyed wide reputation as a portrait painter, had\r\ncome to Vienna from Munich to paint the portrait of Emperor Franz\r\nin the latter year. He remained till some time in 1820 and made the\r\nacquaintance of Beethoven through a letter of introduction probably\r\ngiven to him by Brentano. Beethoven took a liking to him and gave\r\nhim some sittings--three, according to the testimony of the painter\r\nhimself, thus disproving Schindler’s statement that “sitting after\r\nsitting was granted and never a complaint uttered.” On the contrary,\r\nthe Conversation Book presents the artist as pleading for a little\r\nmore time; and because Beethoven refused to sit longer, Stieler had to\r\nexercise his imagination or memory in painting the hands. In fact, the\r\npainting never received the finishing touches but remained, as those\r\nwho have seen it testify, “sketchy.” In March Stieler writes in the\r\nConversation Book: “Have you written to Frankfort that I have begun\r\nyour portrait?--You must determine the destination of the picture.\r\nI say that I am painting it for myself.” In April Stieler asks the\r\nquestion: “In what key is your mass? I want to write on the sheet:\r\n(Mass in--)” Beethoven writes the answer: “_Missa solemnis in D_,” and\r\nStieler: “After it has been exhibited I shall send it to Brentano--I\r\nthank you thousands and thousands of times for so much patience.”\r\nBeethoven’s friends refer frequently to the picture in their written\r\nconversations with Beethoven. One says: “That you have been painted _en\r\nface_ is the result of more extended study of your physiognomy. This\r\nview shows your spirit much better than a profile.” Schindler writes\r\nthat he prefers the portrait by Schimon: “There is more character\r\nin it--all agree on that--You were very well two years ago; now you\r\nare always ailing.” J. Czerny writes: “We were just talking about\r\nyour portrait. Oliva thinks you are well hit off.” The artist visits\r\nBeethoven again at Mödling in July and writes: “Before the exhibition\r\nI shall paint your portrait again, but full life-size. Your head makes\r\nan excellent effect full face, and it was so appropriate because Haydn\r\nwas on one side and Mozart on the other.” Stieler dated the canvass\r\n“1819,” but this can only refer to the time when it was begun. It\r\nremained for a while in the possession of the family of the painter,\r\nthen passed through several hands by purchase until it reached those of\r\nCountess Sauerma in Berlin, in whose possession it was when Frimmel\r\nand Kalischer inspected it for purposes of description. Schindler says\r\nit reproduces Beethoven’s characteristic expression faithfully and that\r\nit met with approval, though fault was found with the pose. Beethoven’s\r\ncontemporaries were not used to see him with his head bowed down as\r\nStieler represents him; on the contrary, he carried his head high\r\neven when suffering physical pain. A lithographic reproduction of the\r\nportrait was made by Fr. Dürck and published by Artaria in 1826.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1860, the author[31] had a conversation with Horzalka in\r\nwhich the latter spoke very highly of Schindler and his disinterested\r\nfidelity to Beethoven. Horzalka also said that in 1820 or 1821, as near\r\nas he could recollect, the wife of a Major Baumgarten took boy boarders\r\nin a house then standing where the Musikverein’s hall now stands in\r\nVienna. Her sister, Baroness Born, lived with her. Frau Baumgarten had\r\na son who studied at Blöchlinger’s Institute, and Beethoven’s nephew\r\nwas amongst her boarders. One evening Horzalka called there and found\r\nonly the Baroness Born at home. Soon another caller came and stayed to\r\ntea. It was Beethoven. Among other topics, Mozart came on the tapis and\r\nthe Baroness asked Beethoven, in writing of course, which of Mozart’s\r\noperas he thought most of. “Die Zauberflöte,” said Beethoven and,\r\nsuddenly clasping his hands and throwing up his eyes exclaimed, “Oh,\r\nMozart!” As Horzalka had, as was the custom, always considered “Don\r\nGiovanni” the greatest of Mozart’s operas, this opinion by Beethoven\r\nmade a very deep impression upon him. Beethoven invited the Baroness to\r\ncome to his lodgings and have a look at his Broadwood pianoforte.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ARRESTED AS A VAGRANT]\r\n\r\nIn 1820 Professor Höfel, who lived at Salzburg in the last years of his\r\nlife and who engraved the Latronne portrait of Beethoven for Artaria,\r\nwas appointed to a professorship of drawing in Wiener Neustadt. A year\r\nor two afterward, as he said,[32] he was one evening with Eisner and\r\nother colleagues in the garden of the tavern “Zum Schleifen,” a little\r\nway out of town. The Commissioner of Police was a member of the party.\r\nIt was autumn and already dark when a constable came and said to the\r\nCommissioner: “Mr. Commissioner, we have arrested somebody who will\r\ngive us no peace. He keeps on yelling that he is Beethoven; but he’s\r\na ragamuffin, has no hat, an old coat, etc.--nothing by which he can\r\nbe identified.” (_Herr Commissär, wir haben Jemand arretirt, welcher\r\nuns kein’ Ruh gibt. Er schreit immer dass er Beethoven sei. Er ist\r\naber ein Lump, hat kein’ Hut, alter Rock, etc., kein Aufweis wer er\r\nist, etc._) The Commissioner ordered that the man be kept under arrest\r\nuntil morning, “then we will examine him and learn who he is.” Next\r\nmorning the company was very anxious to know how the affair turned\r\nout, and the Commissioner said that about 11 o’clock at night he was\r\nwaked by a policeman with the information that the prisoner would\r\ngive them no peace and had demanded that Herzog, Musical Director in\r\nWiener Neustadt, be called to identify him. So the Commissioner got up,\r\ndressed, went out and waked up Herzog, and in the middle of the night\r\nwent with him to the watchhouse. Herzog, as soon as he cast eyes on\r\nthe man exclaimed, “That _is_ Beethoven!” He took him home with him,\r\ngave him his best room, etc. Next day came the burgomaster, making all\r\nmanner of apologies. As it proved, Beethoven had got up early in the\r\nmorning, and, slipping on a miserable old coat and, without a hat, had\r\ngone out to walk a little. He got upon the towpath of the canal and\r\nkept on and on; seems to have lost his direction, for, with nothing to\r\neat, he had continued on until he brought up at the canal-basin at the\r\nUngerthor. Here, not knowing where he was, he was seen looking in at\r\nthe windows of the houses, and as he looked so like a beggar the people\r\nhad called a constable who arrested him. Upon his arrest the composer\r\nsaid, “I am Beethoven.” “Of course, why not?” (_Warum nicht gar?_)\r\nsaid the policeman; “You’re a tramp: Beethoven doesn’t look so.” (_Ein\r\nLump sind Sie; so sieht der Beethoven nicht aus._) Herzog gave him\r\nsome decent clothes and the burgomaster sent him back to Baden, where\r\nhe was then living, in the magisterial state-coach. This simple story\r\nis the foundation for the fine narrative related as a fact in Vienna\r\nthat Beethoven had got into this scrape following troops from Vienna\r\nwho had a sham battle near Wiener Neustadt, and taking notes for his\r\n“Wellington’s Victory”--which whole story thus goes to the wall.\r\n\r\nA letter written from Baden on September 10, 1821, to Tobias Haslinger\r\naccompanying a canon[33] on the words “O Tobias _dominus_ Haslinger,\r\nO, O!” deserves to be given here to show that Beethoven’s high spirits\r\ncould at times dominate him in spite of his general misery.\r\n\r\n    Very best fellow!\r\n\r\n    Yesterday, in the carriage on the way to Vienna, I was overcome by\r\n    sleep, naturally enough, since (because of my early rising here)\r\n    I had never slept well. While thus slumbering I dreamed that I\r\n    had made a long journey--to no less distant a country than Syria,\r\n    no less than India, back again, no less than Arabia, finally I\r\n    reached Jerusalem; the Holy City aroused in me thoughts of Holy\r\n    Writ and small wonder that the man Tobias now occurred to me, and\r\n    how natural that our little Tobias should enter my mind and the\r\n    _pertobiasser_, and now during my dream journey the following canon\r\n    came to me: “O Tobias _dominus_ Haslinger, O, O!” But scarcely\r\n    awakened, away went the canon and nothing of it would come back\r\n    to my memory. But when, next day, I was on my way hither in the\r\n    same conveyance (that of a poor Austrian musician) and continued\r\n    the dream journey of the day before, now awake, behold, according\r\n    to the laws of association of ideas, the same canon occurred to\r\n    me again; now fully awake I held it fast, as erst Menelaus held\r\n    Proteus, only allowing it to change itself into 3 voices.\r\n\r\n    Farewell. Presently I shall send you something on Steiner to show\r\n    you that he has no stony (_steinernes_) heart. Farewell, very best\r\n    of fellows, we ever wish that you will always belie your name of\r\n    publisher (_Verleger_) and never become embarrassed (_verlegen_)\r\n    but remain a publisher (_Verleger_) never at a loss (_verlegen_)\r\n    either in receiving or paying--Sing the epistles of St. Paul every\r\n    day, go to pater Werner,[34] who will show you the little book by\r\n    which you may go to heaven in a jiffy. You see my anxiety for your\r\n    soul’s salvation; and I remain with the greatest pleasure from\r\n    everlasting to everlasting,\r\n\r\n  Your most faithful debtor\r\n  Beethoven.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE MASS IN D]\r\n\r\nAnd now as to the creative work of the two years. Paramount attention\r\nmust be given to the Mass in D, which, though long in hand and destined\r\nfor a function in which Beethoven and his Imperial Archepiscopal pupil\r\nwere profoundly concerned, was yet incomplete when the time for that\r\nfunction arrived. Archduke Rudolph was installed as Archbishop of\r\nOlmütz on March 20, 1820. Exactly what condition the Mass was in at\r\nthat time we have no means of knowing; it was, however, in a sufficient\r\nstate of forwardness to enable Beethoven to begin negotiations for its\r\npublication. On March 18 he wrote to Simrock:\r\n\r\n    As regards the mass, I have pondered the matter carefully and might\r\n    give it to you for the honorarium of 100 Louis d’ors which you\r\n    offered me, provided you agree to a few conditions which I shall\r\n    propose and which I think, will not be found burdensome by you. We\r\n    have gone through the plan for publication here and believe that\r\n    with a few modifications it can be put into effect very soon, which\r\n    is very necessary; wherefore I shall make haste to inform you of\r\n    the necessary changes soon.\r\n\r\nThis would seem to indicate that the work had been practically\r\ncompleted, and that this view obtained amongst Beethoven’s friends we\r\nknow from the evidence of the Conversation Books. In the summer at\r\nMödling he was frequently asked if it was finished and when it would\r\nbe performed. Some hurried sketches belonging to the _Credo_ are found\r\namongst the remarks of his friends, and also sketches for the _Agnus\r\nDei_. Schindler asks him in August: “Is the _Benedictus_ written out in\r\nscore? Are those sketches for the _Agnus_?” Rudolph had communicated\r\nto him his intention to spend a part of the summer in Mödling.\r\nBeethoven writes to him on August 3 and September 2, making apologies\r\nfor apparent neglect in not waiting upon him (he had no carriage the\r\nfirst time, was in ill-health the second), but says not a word about\r\nthe mass. Some of the remarks in the Conversation Book are vague as to\r\nthe composition referred to, but many are plain enough to show that\r\nBeethoven had informed his friends and advisers of the negotiations\r\nwith Simrock. Surprise is expressed at Simrock’s delay. Beethoven is\r\nadvised to write to him and also to Brentano in Frankfort, who had\r\nbeen authorized to collect the honorarium. In April somebody writes:\r\n“Have you written to Simrock that he _must not_ publish the mass at\r\nonce, as you want first to send it or hand it to the Archduke?” Again:\r\n“If you send the _Recepisse_ of the stage-coach he will certainly send\r\nyou the money _at once_.” And later: “It would be quicker to give the\r\nmusic to the stage-coach and send Brentano the receipt--at the same\r\ntime informing Simrock that Brentano had been assured of its despatch;\r\nthen Brentano can send you the money at once without waiting to receive\r\nthe music.” In April again: “But he has not yet replied to your last\r\noffer of the mass? I mean Simrock--200 ducats could help you out\r\ngreatly--Because of _your circumstances_. You must not delay writing to\r\nSimrock or Brentano. Brentano can send you the money _at once_--or at\r\nleast very soon.” “I am surprised that Simrock has not answered yet.”\r\nMeanwhile Simrock answers. “Leave Simrock’s letter with me,” says the\r\nmentor, “I’ll answer it and give you the letter this afternoon--if you\r\nare satisfied with it you will sign it and I will post it to-morrow.\r\nThere must be no delay.” “He says the mass can be used only by\r\nCatholics, which is not true.” “He is paying too little rather than too\r\nmuch with 200 ducats.”\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that some difficulty had arisen between Beethoven and\r\nSimrock. What that difficulty was is explained in a letter from\r\nSimrock to Brentano dated November 12, 1820. It was a misunderstanding\r\nconcerning the price of the “new grand musical mass” which the\r\ncomposer wished to sell for 100 Louis d’ors. The publisher had agreed\r\nto the price, understanding Louis d’ors to mean what the term meant\r\nin Bonn, Leipsic and throughout Germany, namely, the equivalent of\r\nFriedrichs d’ors, pistoles. In order to avoid unpleasantness after the\r\nreception of the mass he had explained this clearly to Beethoven and in\r\na letter, dated September 23, had repeated that by Louis d’ors he meant\r\nFriedrichs d’ors; he was not in a position to give more. He would hold\r\nthe sum in readiness against the receipt of the mass, which Beethoven\r\nhad promised to provide with German as well as Latin words. He was also\r\nunder the impression that he had asked a speedy decision, as he did\r\nnot want to keep his money tied up in Frankfort. Hearing nothing for\r\nfour weeks he had quit counting on the mass and made other use of his\r\nmoney. Learning, however, from Brentano’s letter of November 8th that\r\nBeethoven had agreed to let him have the mass, he now finds himself in\r\nthe embarrassment of not having the gold Louis d’ors on hand, but as\r\nBrentano had said nothing on the subject he would in the meantime try\r\nto secure the coin, unless Brentano were willing to take the equivalent\r\nin florins at the rate of 9.36. He asked to be informed of the arrival\r\nof the music so that he might instruct Heinrich Verhuven to receive it\r\non paying the sum mentioned.\r\n\r\nSimrock waited four weeks before abandoning hope that Beethoven would\r\nsend the mass; it was ten weeks and more before Beethoven answered\r\nSimrock’s letter. Then he sent his reply to Brentano enclosed in a\r\nletter dated November 28. The letter has not been found, or at least\r\nnot made public; but the letter to Brentano[35] makes it plain that\r\nBeethoven had acceded to Simrock’s offer and agreed to take pistoles\r\nfor Louis d’ors. He says:\r\n\r\n    Your kindness permits me to hope that you will not refuse to have\r\n    the enclosure sent to Simrock, inasmuch as in it my views are set\r\n    forth concerning the whole matter. Nothing remains now except to\r\n    take what he offers, namely the 100 pistoles and as much more as\r\n    you, an expert in the business, can get for me by the rate of\r\n    exchange. I am convinced of your kind disposition in this regard.\r\n    I am very hard-pressed just now, but such things are to be told\r\n    _last of all to a publisher_; it is, thank God, not my fault, but\r\n    my sacrifices for others, chiefly, too, for the weak Cardinal who\r\n    led me into this morass and does not know how to help himself. As\r\n    soon as the translation is finished I shall trouble you again by\r\n    sending you the mass, and I pray you give a little attention then\r\n    to securing what you can for me from the Jewish[36] publisher.\r\n\r\nThus matters stand with the Mass at the end of 1820, and thus they\r\nseem to have remained throughout the next year. Simrock always was to\r\nbe but never was blest with the score. On July 18, 1821, Beethoven\r\npromises to put the work into the Archduke’s hands “while here”--i. e.,\r\nat Unterdöbling; he leaves the reasons for the delay to the imagination\r\nof his patron: “the details might prove anything but pleasant to Y. I.\r\nH.” In November he thinks again of Simrock and on the 12th writes to\r\nBrentano:\r\n\r\n    The mass might have been sent before this, but had to be _carefully\r\n    looked through_, for the publishers in other countries do not get\r\n    along well with my manuscript, as I know from experience, and a\r\n    copy for the engraver must be examined note by note. Moreover,\r\n    I could not come because of illness, the more since despite\r\n    everything I have been compelled to make a considerable number\r\n    of potboilers (as unfortunately I must call them). I think I am\r\n    justified in making an attempt to get Simrock to reckon the Louis\r\n    d’ors at a higher rate, inasmuch as several applications have been\r\n    made from other quarters, concerning which I shall write you soon.\r\n    As for the rest, do not question my honesty; frequently I think of\r\n    nothing except that your kind advance may soon be repaid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LOAN ADVANCED ON THE MASS]\r\n\r\nIt seems a fair inference from the concluding remark, together with\r\nthe advice of his friend or friends in the Conversation Book of the\r\nprevious summer concerning a collection through Brentano as soon as the\r\nmass had been handed over to the stage-coach, that Beethoven had got an\r\nadvance from Brentano on the money which was awaiting the arrival of\r\nthe work in Frankfort. The following letter to Brentano strengthens the\r\ninference:\r\n\r\n  Vienna, December 20, 1821.\r\n\r\n  Noble man!\r\n\r\n    I am awaiting another letter respecting the mass, which I shall\r\n    send you to give you an insight into the whole affair. In any event\r\n    the entire honorarium will be paid to you whereupon you will please\r\n    deduct the amount of my indebtedness to you, my gratitude to you\r\n    will always be unbounded. I was so presumptuous as without asking\r\n    to dedicate a composition of mine to your daughter Maxe, please\r\n    accept the deed as a mark of my continual devotion to you and your\r\n    entire family--do not misinterpret the dedication as prompted by\r\n    interest or as a recompense--this would pain me greatly. There are\r\n    nobler motives to which such things may be ascribed if reasons must\r\n    be found. The new year is about to enter, may it fulfil all your\r\n    wishes and daily increase your happiness as the father of a family\r\n    in your children. I embrace you cordially and beg you to present\r\n    my compliments to your excellent, only and glorious Toni.\r\n\r\n  Yours, etc.\r\n\r\n    I have received from here and elsewhere offers of 200 ducats in\r\n    gold for the mass. I think I can get 100 florins W. W. more. On\r\n    this point I am waiting for a letter which I will send you at once,\r\n    the matter might then be presented to Simrock, who will certainly\r\n    not expect me to lose so much. Till then please be patient and do\r\n    not think that you have acted magnanimously towards an unworthy man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THREE SONATAS AT A BREATH]\r\n\r\nBrentano informed Simrock of the situation; but the subject is now\r\ncarried over into the next year and must be left for the nonce, while\r\nwe take up the history of some other compositions. The last three\r\npianoforte sonatas, Op. 109, 110 and 111, belong to this period.\r\nAlso the Bagatelles Op. 119, Nos. 7 to 11 inclusive. Their story\r\nis known. Friedrich Starcke, Chapelmaster of an Austrian regiment\r\nof infantry, had undertaken the publication of a pianoforte method\r\nwhich he called the “Wiener Pianoforteschule.” Part III of the work,\r\nwhich appeared early in 1821, contained these five Bagatelles under\r\nthe title “Trifles” (_Kleinigkeiten_). Above them Starcke printed:\r\n“A contribution from the great composer to the publisher.” They must\r\nhave been asked for in 1820. Somewhere about February of that year an\r\nunidentified hand writes in the Conversation Book: “Starcke wants a\r\nlittle music-piece by you for the second part of his _Klavierschule_,\r\nfor which he has contributions from the leading composers besides short\r\nnotices.... We must give him something. Notwithstanding his great\r\ndeserts in music and literature he is extremely modest, industrious\r\nand humble.... He understands the art of compiling well. There are now\r\nweaklings everywhere even among the strong.” To this appeal Beethoven\r\nyielded. He wrote the five Bagatelles, sketches for which are found\r\namongst some for the Sonata in E major (Op. 109) and the _Benedictus_\r\nof the mass. No. 6 is also sketched among studies for the _Credo_. No\r\ndoubt these little pieces were some of the “potboilers” (_Brodarbeit_)\r\nreferred to in the letter to Brentano; also some folksong arrangements;\r\nand it may even be, that Beethoven included also the three great\r\nsonatas. Schindler relates that when Beethoven heard that it was\r\nbruited about that he had written himself out, his invention was\r\nexhausted, and that he had taken up Scottish melodies like Haydn in\r\nhis old age, he seemed amused and said: “Wait a while, you’ll soon\r\nlearn differently.” Schindler then adds: “Late in the Fall (1820),\r\nreturned from his summer sojourn in Mödling, where like a bee he had\r\nbeen engaged busily in gathering ideas, he sat himself down to his\r\ntable and wrote out the three sonatas Op. 109, 110, 111 ‘in a single\r\nbreath,’ as he expressed it in a letter to Count Brunswick in order to\r\nquiet the apprehension of his friends touching his mental condition.”\r\nSchindler was dubious about the “single breath” and, indeed, there was\r\na considerable lapse of time between the writing of the first of the\r\nthree sonatas and the last two. The Sonata in E belongs unquestionably\r\nto the year 1820. The first theme is found in the Conversation Book of\r\nApril, and the work was sketched before he began the _Benedictus_ of\r\nthe mass and while he was at work on this movement, the _Credo_, the\r\n_Agnus Dei_ and the Bagatelles for Starcke. Before the end of the year\r\nArchduke Rudolph received the manuscript for his collection. It was\r\ndedicated to Maximiliane Brentano,[37] and published in November, 1821,\r\nby Schlesinger in Berlin.\r\n\r\nBeethoven has himself left data concerning the other two sonatas. On\r\nthe autograph of that in A-flat major, Op. 110, he wrote the date\r\n“December 25, 1821.” Sketches for it follow sketches for the _Agnus\r\nDei_ of the mass, which were begun in 1820.[38] It was published\r\nby Schlesinger in Berlin and Paris in 1822. There is evidence in a\r\nmemorandum to Schindler found among the latter’s papers, and also in a\r\nletter to Schlesinger of 1823, that Beethoven intended to dedicate both\r\nof the last two sonatas to Madame Brentano. “Ries-nichts” (“nothing\r\nto Ries”), says the memorandum, significantly. Ideas utilized in the\r\nC minor Sonata, Op. 111, are found amongst those for Op. 110 and\r\nparticularly among some for the _Agnus Dei_. The autograph bears the\r\ndate January 13, 1822,[39] and it is plain that most of the work was\r\ndone in 1821. It was published by Schlesinger in April, 1823, after\r\nBeethoven had offered it to Peters of Leipsic. Corrections for these\r\nthree sonatas occupied a great deal of time; the engraving of the\r\nFrench edition of the C minor was so faulty that Beethoven demanded\r\nproof copies three times; twice his call was granted, the third time\r\nit was refused.[40] This Sonata, Op. 111, was dedicated to Archduke\r\nRudolph. Beethoven had left the matter to Schlesinger, but he afterward\r\nmade a suggestion as to his wishes, for in a letter to the Archduke\r\non June 1, 1823, he writes: “Y. I. H. seemed to find pleasure in\r\nthe Sonata in C minor, and therefore I feel that it would not be\r\npresumptuous if I were to surprise you with its dedication.”\r\n\r\nThere are few other compositions of these two years to ask attention,\r\nthe Canons and five Bagatelles having been mentioned. There is a song,\r\n“Abendlied unter dem gestirnten Himmel,” words by Heinrich Göbel, the\r\noriginal manuscript of which bears date March 4, 1820, and which was\r\npublished as a supplement to the “Modenzeitung” on March 28, 1820,\r\nwith a dedication to Dr. Braunhofer.[41] The twenty-five Scotch Songs,\r\nOp. 108, were published in 1821 by Schlesinger. The performances of\r\nBeethoven’s works in Vienna in 1820 and 1821 are quickly summed up. The\r\nGesellschaft der Musikfreunde performed the “Eroica” on February 20,\r\nthe C minor on April 9 and the F major on November 19. The Overture\r\nin C, Op. 115, was played at a concert for the benefit of Widows and\r\nOrphans on April 16, 1820. In the _Concerts spirituels_, conducted\r\nby F. X. Gebauer in the season 1820-21, the Symphonies in C minor,\r\nA major, and F major, and the Oratorio “Christus am Ölberg,” were\r\nperformed. Leopoldine Blahetka, a young woman of 18 who was creating\r\nsomething of a furore by her pianoforte playing at the time, played the\r\nConcerto in B-flat on April 3, having studied it with J. Czerny.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[24] “Two things fill the soul with ever new and increasing wonder\r\nand reverence the oftener the mind dwells upon them--the starry sky\r\nabove me and the moral law within me.”--Kant’s “Criticism of Practical\r\nReason.”\r\n\r\n[25] The greeting was in the form of a four-part canon beginning with\r\na short homophonic chorus, the words: “Seiner Kaiserlichen Hoheit! Dem\r\nErzherzog Rudolph! Dem geistlichen Fürsten! Alles Gute, alles Schöne!”\r\nThe autograph is preserved by the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in\r\nVienna. B. and H. Ges. Aus.

Thayer’s working copy of his\r\n“Chronologisches Verzeichniss,” which contains annotations of a\r\nmuch later date than Nottebohm’s publication in the “Thematisches\r\nVerzeichniss” which he edited for Breitkopf and Härtel, pays no\r\nattention to Nottebohm’s conclusion.\r\n\r\n[30] See the letter in the Kalischer-Shedlock Coll. II, 178.\r\n\r\n[31] Thayer.\r\n\r\n[32] This anecdote is recorded in Thayer’s note-book as a memorandum of\r\na conversation had with Höfel on June 23, 1860.\r\n\r\n[33] For the music the reader is referred to Series XXIII of the\r\nComplete Edition of Beethoven’s works published by Breitkopf and Härtel.\r\n\r\n[34] The dramatic poet Zacharias Werner, who had become a convert\r\nto Roman Catholicism and, now an ordained priest, was preaching to\r\ngreat crowds of Viennese. The puns on the German word _Verleger_ and\r\n_verlegen_ are untranslatable.\r\n\r\n[35] The letter is preserved in the Beethoven House at Bonn. It was\r\nfirst published in the “Vossische Zeitung” by Dr. Kalischer on July 26,\r\n1903. See Kalischer-Shedlock, II, 177.\r\n\r\n[36] Dr. Kalischer refers the remark about the “Jewish publisher”\r\nto Schlesinger in Berlin; but this may be a mistake. In a later\r\ncorrespondence with Peters, who suggests the term, Schlesinger is thus\r\nreferred to; but there is nothing to indicate that when correspondence\r\nbetween Schlesinger and Beethoven had scarcely begun, Brentano was\r\ncalled on to come to the rescue. Beethoven may mean a fling at Simrock\r\nfor his action in the matter of the Louis d’ors.\r\n\r\n[37] See the letter to Franz Brentano of December 20, 1821, and the\r\nnote to his daughter dated December 6, 1821. (Kalischer-Shedlock, II,\r\n189.)\r\n\r\n[38] See Nottebohm, “Zweit. Beeth.,” pp. 465 and 471.\r\n\r\n[39] Beethoven wrote, as if absentmindedly, “Ludwig Ludwig am 13ten\r\nJenner 1822.”\r\n\r\n[40] It is noteworthy, as shown by Nottebohm (“Zweit. Beeth.,” pp.\r\n467, 468) that the first theme of the first movement of the C minor\r\nSonata was originally intended for a third movement in a “second\r\nsonata” which (Op. 109 being finished) can only have been the one in C\r\nminor. It would seem as if the use of the theme in the first movement\r\ndid not occur to the composer until after he had conceived the theme\r\nof the variations. But the theme had figured twenty years before in a\r\nsketchbook used when the Sonata in A major, Op. 30, was in hand. Its\r\nkey then was F-sharp minor, and it may have been intended for Op. 30.\r\n\r\n[41] Published also, together with three other songs--“Geheimniss,”\r\n“Resignation” and “So oder so”--by Sauer and Leidesdorf as Op. 113 in\r\n1821 or 1822. Beethoven presented a copy of it to Fanny Giannatasio on\r\nApril 19, 1820.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\n    The Year 1822--The _Missa Solemnis_--Beethoven and His\r\n    Publishers--Brother Johann--Meetings with Rochlitz and\r\n    Rossini--Overture: “The Consecration of the House”--A Revival\r\n    of “Fidelio”--Madame Schroeder-Devrient--The “Bagatelles”--A\r\n    Commission from America.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now desirable to disregard the strict chronological sequence of\r\nincident and dispose, so far as is possible, of the history of the\r\ngreat Mass in D prior to the adoption of a new plan by which Beethoven\r\nhoped to make it a source of extraordinary revenue. So far as it\r\naffects Beethoven’s character as a man not always scrupulous in his\r\nobservance of business obligations, the story does not need to extend\r\nbeyond the year 1822. Careful readers of this biography can easily\r\nrecall a number of lapses from high ideals of candor and justice in his\r\ntreatment of his friends and of a nice sense of honor and honesty in\r\nhis dealings with his publishers; but at no time have these blemishes\r\nbeen so numerous or so patent as they are in his negotiations for the\r\npublication of the _Missa Solemnis_--a circumstance which is thrown\r\ninto a particularly strong light by the frequency and vehemence of\r\nhis protestations of moral rectitude in the letters which have risen\r\nlike ghosts to accuse him, and by the strange paradox that the period\r\nis one in which his artistic thoughts and imagination dwelt in the\r\nhighest regions to which they ever soared. He was never louder in his\r\nprotestations of business morality than when he was promising the\r\nmass to four or more publishers practically at the same time, and\r\ngiving it to none of them; never more apparently frank than when he\r\nwas making ignoble use of a gentleman, whom he himself described as\r\none of the best friends on earth, as an intermediary between himself\r\nand another friend to whom he was bound by business ties and childhood\r\nassociations which challenged confidence; never more obsequious (for\r\neven this word must now be used in describing his attitude towards\r\nFranz Brentano) than after he had secured a loan from that friend in\r\nthe nature of an advance on a contract which he never carried out;\r\nnever more apparently sincere than when he told one publisher (after\r\nhe had promised the mass to another) that he should be particularly\r\nsorry if he were unable to give the mass into his hands; never more\r\nforcefully and indignantly honest in appearance than when he informed\r\nstill another publisher that the second had importuned him for the\r\nmass (“bombarded” was the word), but that he had never even deigned\r\nto answer his letters. But even this is far from compassing the\r\nindictment; the counts are not even complete when it is added that in\r\na letter he states that the publisher whom he had told it would have\r\nbeen a source of sorrow not to favor had never even been contemplated\r\namongst those who might receive the mass; that he permitted the friend\r\nto whom he first promised the score to tie up some of his capital for\r\na year and more so that “good Beethoven” should not have to wait a day\r\nfor his money; that after promising the mass to the third publisher he\r\nsought to create the impression that it was not the _Missa Solemnis_\r\nthat had been bargained for, but one of two masses which he had in hand.\r\n\r\nIt is not only proper, but a duty, to give all possible weight to\r\nthe circumstances which can be, ought to be, must indeed be pleaded\r\nin extenuation of his conduct; but the facts can not be obscured or\r\nignored without distorting the picture of the man Beethoven as this\r\nbiography has consistently striven from the beginning to present it.\r\nFor English and American readers, moreover, the shock of surprise will\r\nbe lessened by a recollection of Beethoven’s first transactions in\r\nLondon, which more than five years before had called out the advice\r\nof the English publishers to Neate for God’s sake not to buy anything\r\nof Beethoven! As for the rest it is right to remember that at this\r\ntime many of the sources of Beethoven’s income had dried up. He was no\r\nlonger able to offer his publishers symphonies in pairs, or sonatas and\r\nchamber compositions in groups. He produced laboriously and, in the\r\ncase of compositions which were dear to his heart, with infinite and\r\nuntiring care and insatiable desire for perfection. Engrossed in such\r\nworks, he gave no thought to pecuniary reward; but, rudely disturbed\r\nby material demands, he sought the first means at hand to supply\r\nthe need. Hence his resurrection of works composed and laid aside\r\nyears before; his acceptance of commissions which he was never able\r\nto perform; his promise of speedy delivery of works scarcely begun;\r\nhis acceptance of advances on contracts which he could not fulfil;\r\nhis strange confidence (this we feel we are justified in assuming)\r\nin his ability to bring forth works of magnitude in time to keep his\r\nobligations even when the works which he had in mind had already been\r\nthere for years; his ill-health which brought with it loss of creative\r\nvitality, of fecundity in ideas and facility in execution in inverse\r\nratio to the growth of his artistic ideals; the obsession of his whole\r\nbeing by his idolatrous love for his nephew and the mental distress and\r\nmonetary sacrifice which his self-assumed obligation entailed and which\r\ncompelled him to become the debtor of his publishers lest he encroach\r\nupon the emoluments of the Vienna Congress which he had solemnly\r\nconsecrated to his foster-son. Let all these things be remembered when\r\nthe story of his shortcomings is told.[42]\r\n\r\nAnd now let the story of the Mass be resumed from the point where it\r\nwas dropped in the preceding chapter; with it will be found statements\r\nbearing on a few other more or less inconsequential compositions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: REPREHENSIBLE CONDUCT TOWARDS SIMROCK]\r\n\r\nOn May 13, 1822, Simrock reminds Beethoven that a year has passed\r\nsince he promised to deliver the score into his hands by the end of\r\nApril. Since October 25, 1820, he (Simrock) had kept 100 Louis d’ors\r\non deposit in Frankfort so that there would be no delay in the payment\r\nof the remuneration. On March 19, Beethoven had written that he had\r\nbeen sick abed for six weeks and was not yet entirely well. He had told\r\nthe publisher to rest easy in his mind, that being the sole purpose\r\nof the letter. The publisher had gone to the autumn fair of 1821 and\r\nto the Easter fair of 1822 and asked Brentano for the mass; but been\r\ntold that it had not been received. He begs for a few words on the\r\nsubject. It would seem as if Simrock had preserved his temper very\r\nwell. The letter brings another evidence of his unchanged good will, He\r\nhad resolved at an earlier period to publish the six symphonies which\r\nwere in his catalogue in a new edition, but had not done so because it\r\nwould not pay. Now, he said, he wanted to rear a monument to his worthy\r\nold friend and had brought out the scores in a style which he hoped\r\nthe composer would deem worthy. What Beethoven said in reply to this\r\nletter is not known, his answer not having been given to the world;\r\nit can be surmised, however, from the recital given to Brentano in a\r\nletter from Beethoven dated May 19. He had been troubled by “gout in\r\nthe chest” for four months, he says, and able to do but little work;\r\nnevertheless the Mass would be in Frankfort by the end of the next\r\nmonth, that is, by the end of June, 1822. There was another reason for\r\nthe delay. Cardinal Rudolph, strongly disposed in favor of his music at\r\nall times, did not want the Mass published so early and had returned\r\nto the composer the score and parts only three days before. Here we\r\nhave a very significant statement. What may be called the official copy\r\nof the Mass in D was formally presented to Archduke Rudolph on March\r\n19, 1823; here, ten months earlier, he speaks of a score and parts\r\nwhich the Archduke had returned to him three days before. The Mass,\r\ntherefore, must have had what, for the time being (Beethoven never\r\nconsidered it finished so long as it was in his hands), was looked upon\r\nas a definitive shape at the time when Beethoven promised to send it to\r\nBrentano for Simrock. The Archduke returned it, as Beethoven says, so\r\nthat the publication might not be hindered. How long it had been in the\r\nhands of the Archduke no one can tell. Now, said Beethoven to Brentano,\r\nthe score will be copied again, carefully examined, which would take\r\nsome time owing to his ill health, but it would be in Frankfort at the\r\nend of June “at the latest,” by which time Simrock must be ready to\r\nmake payment. He had received better offers from Vienna and elsewhere,\r\nbut had rejected all of them because he had given his word to Simrock\r\nand would abide by the agreement even if he lost money, trusting to\r\nmake his losses good by other sales to Simrock who, moreover, might\r\nbe disposed to make a contract for the Complete Edition. Brentano\r\ncommunicated with Simrock at once and received a letter from the\r\npublisher on May 29 expressing regret that sickness had been partly\r\nresponsible for the delay. He had been expecting the Mass every day for\r\nmore than a year, during which time the money had lain with Heinrich\r\nVerhuven because he did not want Beethoven to wait a single day for it.\r\n\r\nThus on May 19, Beethoven tells Brentano that he will keep the faith\r\nwith Simrock even at a sacrifice. On March 1, however, he had written\r\nto Schlesinger in Berlin:\r\n\r\n    In regard to my health, things are better. As to the Mass I beg\r\n    of you to get everything, everything (_Alles, alles_, in Jahn’s\r\n    transcript) in readiness as other publishers have asked for it and\r\n    many approaches have been made to me, especially from here, but I\r\n    resolved long ago that it should not be published here, as the\r\n    matter is a very important one for me. For the present I ask of\r\n    you only that you signify to me whether you accept my last offer\r\n    of the Mass together with the two songs; as regards the payment of\r\n    the honorarium, it may wait for more than four weeks. I must insist\r\n    upon an early answer, chiefly because two other publishers who want\r\n    to have it in their catalogues have been waiting for a definite\r\n    answer from me for a considerable time. Farewell, and write to me\r\n    at once; it would grieve me very much if _I could not give you just\r\n    this particular work_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MASS SOLD TO SCHLESINGER]\r\n\r\nSchlesinger, as we learn from a letter dated July 2, 1822, had received\r\nletters from Beethoven under date of April 9, May 29 and June (he\r\nmistakenly says May 1). He answers the three at once, excusing his\r\ndelay on the ground that he had attended the fair in Leipsic, where he\r\nfell ill, and had remained under the weather for several weeks after\r\nhis return to Berlin. Meanwhile business had accumulated. He accepts\r\nBeethoven’s terms for the mass and the two songs:\r\n\r\n    Everything is in order about the Mass; pray send it and the two\r\n    songs as soon as possible and draw on me at fourteen days’ sight\r\n    for 650 R. T. I will honor the draft at once and pay it. I have no\r\n    opportunity to make payment to you through Vienna. Although several\r\n    music dealers there are extensively in my debt I cannot count on\r\n    prompt payment from any of them. These gentlemen have two very ugly\r\n    traits: 1), they do not respect property rights and 2), it is with\r\n    difficulty that they are brought to pay their accounts. The book\r\n    dealers are much sounder.\r\n\r\nBy a coincidence Schlesinger’s son, who had established himself in\r\nbusiness in Paris, wrote to Beethoven on the same day and asked him\r\nif a third movement of the Pianoforte Sonata in C minor (Op. 111),\r\nwhich he was publishing, had not been forgotten at the copyists. He,\r\nlike his father a little later, evidently suspected that they had not\r\nreceived as much music, measured in detached movements, as they had\r\npaid for; they missed a rondo finale! The incident may have amused,\r\nor (which is more likely) even angered Beethoven; but it can scarcely\r\naccount for the fact that Beethoven resolved about this time to have\r\nnothing more to do with Schlesinger _père_. On July 26 he writes to\r\nPeters of Leipsic, with whom he has now entered into negotiations and\r\nto whom he has offered the Mass, “In no event will Schlesinger ever\r\nget anything more from me; he has played me a Jewish trick, but aside\r\nfrom that he is not among those who might have received the Mass.”\r\nWhen Beethoven was conducting the negotiations with Schott and Sons in\r\nMayence which resulted in the firm’s getting the work, he recurred to\r\nthe Schlesingers in a letter of January 22, 1824, and said: “Neither\r\nis Schlesinger to be trusted, for he takes where he can. Both _père\r\net fils_ bombarded me for the mass, but I did not deign to answer\r\neither of them, since after thinking them over I had cast them out long\r\nbefore.” Beethoven’s threats were frequently mere _brutum fulmen_; the\r\nSchlesingers, _père et fils_, remained his friends to the end and got\r\ntwo of the last Quartets.\r\n\r\nBoth Simrock and Schlesinger are now waiting for Beethoven to send\r\nthem the Mass and the fee is waiting for the composer at Frankfort.\r\nMeanwhile negotiations have been taken up with a newcomer in the field,\r\nwho, however, is but trying to renew an association which had begun\r\nmore than 29 years earlier. Before entering upon this phase of the\r\nhistory of the Mass it seems well to dispose finally of the Simrock\r\nincident.[43] On August 22, 1822, Simrock wrote to Beethoven again.\r\nBeethoven’s answer followed on September 13 and, as it contains more\r\nthan a mere implication why he refused to abide by his contract (a\r\npoint that has been a matter more or less of speculation from the time\r\nwhen the negotiations ceased till now), it is given in full here:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AN APPEAL TO SIMROCK’S GENEROSITY]\r\n\r\n  Baden, September 13, 1822.\r\n\r\n  My dear and valued Simrock:\r\n\r\n    You will receive this letter from Baden, where I am taking the\r\n    baths, as my illness which has lasted a year and a half is not yet\r\n    ended. Much as I should like to write to you about many things I\r\n    must yet be brief and only reply to your last of August 22nd. As\r\n    regards the Mass you know that at an earlier date I wrote you that\r\n    a larger honorarium had been offered me. I would not be so sordid\r\n    as to haggle with you for a hundred or few more florins; but my\r\n    poor health and many other unpleasant circumstances compel me to\r\n    insist upon it. The minimum that at least four publishers have\r\n    offered me for the mass is 1000 florins Convention Coin at the\r\n    rate of twenty, or counting the florin at 3 Austrian florins C. C.\r\n    Much as I shall regret if we must part just because of this work,\r\n    I know that your generosity (_Biederherzigkeit_) will not allow me\r\n    to lose money on this work, which is perhaps the greatest that I\r\n    have composed. You know that I am not boastful and that I do not\r\n    like to show the letters of others or even quote from them; if it\r\n    were not so I might submit proofs from far and near. But I very\r\n    much wish to have the matter about the Mass settled as soon as\r\n    possible, for I have had to endure plots of all sorts on account\r\n    of it. It would be agreeable if you would let me know as soon as\r\n    possible if you will pay me this honorarium. If you will, you need\r\n    only deposit the difference with Brentano, whereupon I will at once\r\n    send you a well corrected score of the Mass which will suffice\r\n    you for the engraving. I hope my dear Simrock, whom I consider the\r\n    richest of all these publishers, will not permit his old friend to\r\n    go elsewhere for the sake of a few hundred florins. Concerning all\r\n    other matters I will write you soon; I shall remain here till the\r\n    beginning of October. I shall receive all letters which you may\r\n    write, safely as I did your last, only I beg you to write soon.\r\n    Farewell, greet the family cordially for me; as soon as I can I\r\n    will write to them myself.\r\n\r\n  Cordially your old friend,\r\n\r\n  Beethoven.\r\n\r\nThis letter can scarcely be called ingenuous by the most zealous\r\nof Beethoven’s defenders. Aside from the fact that he had closed\r\nthe contract, had received an advance on the sum deposited and told\r\nBrentano that he would keep his promise even at a sacrifice to himself,\r\nthe 1000 florins which he now asks Simrock to pay was not the minimum\r\nsum which other publishers had offered but the maximum sum which he had\r\nasked and all of them had agreed to pay--which, indeed, B. Schott and\r\nSons did pay a year and a half later. Under the circumstances it is\r\nscarcely to be wondered at if the appeal to Simrock’s generosity fell\r\non stony soil; but we do not know that it did. The letter was evidently\r\nanswered by Simrock, who, despairing of ever getting the Mass, may\r\nhave suggested that he would accept other works in lieu of it, for on\r\nMarch 10, 1823, Beethoven writes again saying (as he had said to Peters\r\nin November, 1822) that he should surely receive a mass, for he had\r\nwritten two and was only undecided which one to send. He asked Simrock\r\nto be patient till Easter, when he would send one of them to Brentano.\r\nHe intended also to write a mass for the Emperor. As to other works, he\r\noffered the overture to “The Consecration of the House,” the music to\r\n“The Ruins of Athens,” the overture to “King Stephen,” some songs and\r\n“Kleinigkeiten” for the pianoforte. Only for the new overture did he\r\nfix a price (50 ducats), but he added: “You will surely receive one of\r\nthese two grand masses which are already composed; only be patient till\r\nafter Easter, by which time I shall have decided which to send.” This\r\nis the last letter between Beethoven and Simrock which has been found.\r\nIt leaves the composer promising _a_ mass instead of delivering _the_\r\nMass, and that promise unfulfilled;--of a necessity, for the work,\r\nthough described as “already composed,” was never written.\r\n\r\nIn 1814 C. F. Peters had purchased the Bureau de Musique founded in\r\n1798 by Hoffmeister and Kühnel, publishers of a number of Beethoven’s\r\ncompositions, including the First Symphony, between 1800 and 1805. On\r\nMay 18, 1822, Peters addressed a letter to Beethoven in which he said\r\nthat he had long wished to publish some of his compositions but had\r\nrefrained from applying to him because he did not wish to offend the\r\nViennese publishers; seeing now, however, that he was going outside\r\nwith his compositions and giving them “even to the Jew Schlesinger,”\r\nhe would no longer give heed to such considerations. He had spoken to\r\nSteiner on the subject at the last fair, who had offered no objections,\r\nhad, indeed, said that he would be glad if he (Peters) got the works\r\ninstead of Schlesinger, and had offered his services as mediary\r\nbetween him and Beethoven, and asked for a list of compositions which\r\nhe wanted. Thereupon he had given Steiner such a list: symphonies,\r\npianoforte quartets and trios, pianoforte solos “among which there\r\nmight be small pieces,” songs, etc.--anything, in short, which\r\nBeethoven should send him would be welcome, for he wanted honor, not\r\nprofit, from the association. Beethoven replied on June 5:\r\n\r\n    Although I met Steiner several days ago and asked him jocularly\r\n    what he had brought for me from Leipsic, he did not mention _your\r\n    commission_, even in a _syllable_, nor _you_, but earnestly pleaded\r\n    with me to assure him that _I would give him and him alone all my\r\n    present and future works_ and this _contract-wise_; I declined.\r\n    This trait suffices to show you why I often prefer foreign\r\n    publishers to local; I love straightforwardness and uprightness\r\n    and am of the opinion that the artist ought not to be belittled,\r\n    for alas! glittering as is the external aspect of fame, he is not\r\n    permitted to be Jupiter’s guest on Olympus every day; too often\r\n    and too repulsively the vulgar many drag him down from the pure\r\n    ethereal heights.\r\n\r\nHe now opened his budget of wares: the largest work was a Mass--many\r\nhad striven for it, “100 weighty Louis d’ors” had been offered for it,\r\nbut he had demanded at least 1,000 florins Convention Coin, for which\r\nsum he would also prepare the pianoforte score; variations on a waltz\r\n(“there are many”) for pianoforte--30 ducats in gold; a comic air with\r\norchestra on Goethe’s “Mit Mädeln sich vertragen,” and another air of\r\nthe same genre, 16 ducats each;[44] several rather extended songs with\r\npianoforte accompaniment, among them a little Italian cantata with\r\nrecitative,[45] 12 ducats each; there were also recitatives to some of\r\nthe German songs; 8 ducats each for songs; an elegy for four voices\r\nand string quartet accompaniment,[46] 24 ducats; a chorus of Dervishes\r\nwith full orchestra, 20 ducats; a march for orchestra written for the\r\ntragedy “Tarpeia,” with arrangement for pianoforte, 12 ducats; Romance\r\nfor violin solo and orchestra,[47] 15 ducats; Grand Trio for 2 oboi and\r\n1 English horn,[48] which might be transcribed for other instruments,\r\n30 ducats; four military marches with percussion (“Turkish music”)\r\nprices on application; bagatelles, or trifles for pianoforte, prices on\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nThe copy of the letter as printed contains the words here: “All\r\nthese works are ready,” but they are wanting in the original draft.\r\nBeethoven now goes on with a list of compositions which Peters “might\r\nhave soon”; a sonata for pianoforte solo,[49] 40 ducats; a string\r\nquartet, 50 ducats. More than anything else, however, he was desirous\r\nto have a complete edition of his works, as he wished to look after the\r\npublication in his lifetime. He had received a number of applications,\r\nbut could not, or would not, meet all the conditions. With some\r\nnecessary help he thought such an edition of his works might be brought\r\nout in two years, possibly in one-and-a-half; a new work was to be\r\nadded to each class, “to the Variations a new set of variations, to\r\nthe Sonatas a new sonata,” etc., “and for all these together I ask\r\n10,000 florins Convention Coin.” He deplores the fact that he is no\r\nbusiness man; he wishes that matters were different than they are, but\r\nhe is forced to act as he does by competition, and begs that secrecy be\r\nobserved touching the negotiations, to guard against trouble with other\r\npublishers.\r\n\r\nHe was not kept waiting for an answer;--Peters’ reply is dated June\r\n15. He regrets to hear of Steiner’s duplicity, but his conduct may\r\nhave been harmless in intention and caused by his weakness. The works\r\nwhich he wanted and of which he had given a list to Steiner were a\r\nquartet for strings, a trio of the same kind, a concert overture\r\nfor full orchestra, songs and some small solos for pianoforte “such\r\nas capriccios, divertissements,” etc. Then he takes up Beethoven’s\r\ndetailed offer of compositions:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE MASS SOLD TO PETERS]\r\n\r\n    The most admirable amongst them is your Grand Mass, which you offer\r\n    me together with the pianoforte score for one thousand florins\r\n    C. C. and to the acceptance of which at the price I confess my\r\n    readiness.... Between honest men (_offenen Männern_) like us there\r\n    is no need of a contract; but if you want one send it to me and\r\n    I will return it _signed_. If not, please state to me in writing\r\n    that I am to receive the Mass in question together with the\r\n    pianoforte score for 1000 florins in 20-florin pieces, and indicate\r\n    when I am to receive it and that it is to be my _sole property for\r\n    ever_. I want the first so that I may look upon this transaction\r\n    as _concluded_, and the time I want to know so that I can arrange\r\n    about the publication. If I were a rich man I would pay you very\r\n    differently for this Mass, for I opine that it is something right\r\n    excellent, especially because it was composed for an occasion;\r\n    but for me 1000 florins for a Mass is a large expenditure and the\r\n    entire transaction, on my word, is undertaken only in order to show\r\n    myself to you and the world as a publisher who does something for\r\n    art. I must ask another consideration, namely, that _nobody_ learn\r\n    how much I have paid for the Mass--at least not for some time; I am\r\n    not a man of large means, but must worry and drudge; nevertheless\r\n    I pay artists as well as I can and in general better than other\r\n    publishers.\r\n\r\nFor the present, Peters adds, he does not want to publish larger vocal\r\nworks by Beethoven nor the Mass singly but along with other works, to\r\nshow the Viennese publishers that there is a contract between him and\r\nBeethoven which obliges the latter to send him compositions. To that\r\nend he asks for some songs, a few bagatelles for pianoforte solo, the\r\nfour military marches; he would be glad to take also the new string\r\nquartet, but 50 ducats is beyond his means. Beethoven is at liberty to\r\ntell Steiner that he had applied to Beethoven with his knowledge and\r\nconsent. Beethoven’s answer (incorrectly dated July instead of June 26)\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SALE OF THE MASS TO PETERS CONFIRMED]\r\n\r\n    I write you now only that I give you the Mass together with the\r\n    pianoforte score for the sum of 1000 florins, C. C. in 20-florin\r\n    pieces. You will in all likelihood receive the score in copy by\r\n    the end of July--perhaps a few days earlier or later. As I am\r\n    always busy and have been ailing for five months and works must\r\n    be carefully examined, if they go to a distance this always is\r\n    a slower matter with me. In no event will _Schlesinger_ ever\r\n    get anything more from me; he has played me a Jewish trick, but\r\n    aside from that he is not among those who might have received the\r\n    Mass. The competition for my works is very strong at present for\r\n    which I thank the Almighty, for I have also already lost much.\r\n    Moreover, I am the foster-father of the child of my brother, who\r\n    died destitute. As this boy at the age of 15 years shows so much\r\n    aptitude for the sciences, his studies and support cost much money\r\n    now and he must be provided for in the future, we being neither\r\n    Indians nor Iroquois who, as is notorious, leave everything in the\r\n    hands of God, and a pauper’s is a wretched lot. I keep silence\r\n    concerning everything between us _by preference_ and beg you to be\r\n    silent about the present connection with me. I will let you know\r\n    when it is time to speak, which is not at all necessary now....\r\n    I assure you on my honor, which I hold highest after God, that I\r\n    never asked Steiner to receive orders for me. It has always been my\r\n    chief principle never to appeal to a publisher, not out of pride\r\n    but because I have wanted to see how extended is the province which\r\n    my fame has reached.... As for the songs, I have already spoken.\r\n    I think that an honorarium of 40 ducats is not _too much_ for the\r\n    3 songs and 4 marches. You can write to me on the subject. As soon\r\n    as the Mass is ready I will let you know and ask you to remit the\r\n    honorarium to a house here and I will deliver the work as soon as\r\n    I have received it. I will take care to be present at the delivery\r\n    to the post and that the freight charge shall not be too great. I\r\n    should like soon to be made acquainted with your plan concerning\r\n    the complete edition which is so close to my heart.\r\n\r\nPeters answers this letter on July 3. He is willing to pay 40 ducats\r\nfor the songs and marches and to remit part of the honorarium in\r\nadvance. Beethoven’s complaint about his financial affairs distresses\r\nhim and he would like to help him. “It is wrong that a man like you\r\nis obliged to think about money matters. The great ones of the earth\r\nshould long ago have placed you in a position free from care, so that\r\nyou would no longer have to live on art but only for art.” Before this\r\nletter was received Beethoven had written a second and supplementary\r\nreply to the letter of June 13; it is dated July 6. He had reread\r\nhis letter and discovered that Peters wanted some of the bagatelles\r\nand a quartet for strings. For the former, “among which are some of\r\n_considerable length_--they might be published separately under the\r\ntitle ‘Kleinigkeiten’ (Trifles) No. 1, 2, etc.”--he asked 8 ducats\r\neach. The quartet was not fully completed, work on it having been\r\ninterrupted. Here it was difficult to lower the prices, as such works\r\nwere the most highly paid for--he might almost say, to the shame of\r\nthe general taste, which in art frequently falls below that of private\r\ntaste. “I have written you everything concerning the Mass, and that\r\nis settled.” On July 12, Peters writes that he does not know how\r\nlong the bagatelles are and so can not tell whether they are to be\r\nprinted separately or together; but he asks that a number be sent to\r\nhim together with word as to how many of such small pieces Beethoven\r\nhas on hand, as he might take them all. As for songs he would prefer\r\nto have some in the style of “Adelaide” or “Schloss Markenstein.”\r\nThe honorarium for the compositions which were to be sent now would\r\namount to 200 or 300 florins in pieces of 20, but as he could not\r\ndetermine the exact amount he asked Beethoven to collect the amount\r\nfrom Meiss (Meisl) Brothers, bankers, on exhibition of receipt and\r\nbill of shipment. It was all the same to him whether he collected the\r\nmoney now or later; it was waiting and at Beethoven’s disposal. In this\r\nmanner, so convenient for Beethoven, he would make all his payments for\r\nmanuscripts purchased. On August 3 Beethoven writes:\r\n\r\n    I have not made up my mind as to the selection of songs and\r\n    _Kleinigkeiten_, but everything will be delivered by August 13. I\r\n    await your advices in the matter and will make no use of your bill\r\n    of exchange. As soon as I know that the honorarium for the Mass and\r\n    the other works is here all these things can be delivered by the\r\n    15th.\r\n\r\nPeters was prompt in his remittance of the money which was to be\r\nsubject to Beethoven’s order; Beethoven, though less prompt in getting\r\nit, was yet ahead of his delivery of the manuscripts for which the\r\nmoney was to pay. Singularly enough, the incident which provides for\r\nus knowledge of the time when the money was received by Peters’s agent\r\nserved as evidence in Beethoven’s excuse for drawing the money without\r\nkeeping his part of the agreement. On July 25, about a fortnight after\r\nthe date of Peters’s letter of advice, Piringer, associate conductor of\r\nthe _Concerts spirituels_, who was on terms of intimacy with Beethoven,\r\nwrote him as follows:\r\n\r\n    _Domine Generalissimo!_\r\n\r\n    _Victoria_ in Döbling--fresh troops are advancing! The wholesalers,\r\n    Meisl Bros, here in the Rauhensteingasse, their own house, 2nd\r\n    storey, have received advices from Hrn. Peters in Leipsic to pay\r\n    several hundred florins to Herrn Ludwig van Beethoven. I hasten on\r\n    Degen’s pinions[50] to convey this report to _Illustrissimo_ at\r\n    once. To-day is the first sad day in the Viennese calendar, because\r\n    yesterday was the last day of the Italian opera.\r\n\r\nThis letter Beethoven sent to Peters from Baden on September 13 in\r\nevidence of his presumption that Piringer, who was a daily caller at\r\nthe Steiner establishment, had gossipped about the relations between\r\nhim and Peters. He was sorry that Peters had sent the money so early,\r\nbut fearing talk he had collected the money. He would send all the\r\nlittle things soon. He had been pressed by the Cardinal, who had come\r\nto Baden on the 15th and on whom he had to attend several times a week;\r\nand work had been forced upon him by the opening of the Josephstadt\r\nTheatre; also he wanted to write new trios to some of the marches and\r\nrevise other works, but illness and too much other employment had\r\nprevented. “You see from this at least that I am not an author for the\r\nsake of money.... You will recall that I begged you to keep everything\r\naway from Steiner. Why? That I will reveal to you in time. I hope that\r\nGod will protect me against the wiles of this wicked man Steiner.” On\r\nNovember 22, Beethoven writes again: he had been expecting reproaches\r\nfor his negligence but though he had delivered nothing he had received\r\nthe honorarium. It looked wrong (“offensive” is his word), but he was\r\nsure that all would be set right could they but be together a few\r\nminutes. All the music intended for Peters had been laid aside except\r\nthe songs, the selection of which had not yet been made; as a reward\r\nfor waiting, Peters should receive one more than the stipulated number.\r\nHe could deliver more than the four bagatelles agreed on, as he had\r\nnine or ten extra ones on hand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “A MASS” NOT “THE MASS” FOR PETERS]\r\n\r\nNow there enters a new element into the story of the Mass; let\r\nBeethoven introduce it in his own words: “This is the state of affairs\r\nwith regard to the Mass: I completed one long ago, but another is\r\nnot yet finished. There will always be gossip about me, and you must\r\nhave been misled about it. I do not know which of the two you will\r\nreceive.” The gossip against which Beethoven warned Peters, it is safe\r\nto assume, related to the compositions which the latter had purchased\r\nbut not received; in great likelihood rumors about the Mass had\r\nreached Leipsic. Peters was in communication with Steiner and others;\r\nand that he knew that the mass had been planned for the installation\r\nof Archduke Rudolph as Archbishop of Olmütz he had indicated when he\r\nexpressed the belief that it was something “right excellent” because\r\nit had been composed for an occasion. The mass which Beethoven had\r\nagreed to deliver by the end of July could therefore have been none\r\nother than the Mass in D. It is deserving of mention, however, that\r\nthere is evidence that Beethoven was thinking of more than one mass\r\nat the time--in fact, that he had thoughts of three. In a sketchbook\r\nof the period is found a memorandum: “The _Kyrie_ in the second mass\r\nwith wind-instruments and organ only”;[51] and in another place there\r\nare six measures of a theme for a _Dona nobis_ with the superscription\r\n“Mass in C-sharp minor.” To this _Dona_ there is still another\r\nreference or two of a later date; but that is all. It is likely that\r\nthe second mass was intended for the Emperor, as we shall see later;\r\nBeethoven himself says that he had thoughts of a third.\r\n\r\nPeters is getting importunate, and on December 20 Beethoven writes to\r\nhim that nothing intended for him is entirely ready; there had been\r\ndelays in copying and sending, but he had no time to explain. The songs\r\nand marches would be sent “next week” and there would be six bagatelles\r\ninstead of four, and he asks that payment be made for the extra two on\r\nreceipt. He had so many applications for his works that he could not\r\nattend to them all: “Were it not that my income brings in nothing[52] I\r\nshould compose only grand symphonies, church music or at the outside\r\nquartets in addition.” Of smaller works Peters might have variations\r\nfor two oboes and English horn on a theme from “Don Giovanni”--_Da\r\nci la mano_ wrote Beethoven, meaning _Là ci darem la mano_--and a\r\nGratulatory Minuet;[53] he would like Peters’ opinion about the\r\ncomplete edition. In a letter with the double date February 15 and 18,\r\n1823, Peters is informed that three songs,[54] six bagatelles, one\r\nmarch and a tattoo had been sent on the preceding Saturday--the tattoo\r\nin place of one of the promised marches:\r\n\r\n    You will pardon the delay I believe, if you could see into my heart\r\n    you would not accuse me of intentional wrongdoing. To-day I give\r\n    the lacking two tattoos and the fourth grand march to the post. I\r\n    thought it best to send three tattoos and a march instead of four\r\n    marches, although the former can be used as marches. Regimental\r\n    chapelmasters can best judge how to use such things and moreover\r\n    pianoforte arrangements of them might be made. My conduct as an\r\n    artist you may judge from the songs; one has an accompaniment for\r\n    two clarinets, one horn, violas and violoncellos and can be sung to\r\n    these instruments alone or with the pianoforte without them. The\r\n    second song is with accompaniment for two clarinets, two horns and\r\n    two bassoons, and can also be sung to them alone or with pianoforte\r\n    accompaniment alone. Both songs have choruses and the third is a\r\n    quite extended arietta with pianoforte alone. I hope you are now\r\n    reassured. I should be sorry if these delays were attributed to my\r\n    fault or desire. I shall soon write to you about the Mass, as the\r\n    decision which you are to have will presently be made.\r\n\r\n“Some time” before March 10, 1823, Beethoven repaid the loan of 300\r\nflorins to Brentano, sending the money through Geimüller. In his letter\r\nof thanks on that date he encloses a letter to Simrock, unsealed\r\nevidently, and says to his friend, “You see from it the state of things\r\nconcerning the Mass.” What that state was as it presented itself to the\r\nmind of Beethoven we have as yet no means of knowing; but we know that\r\nPeters was still kept in a state of expectation, for on March 20, 1823,\r\nBeethoven writes:\r\n\r\n    As regards the Mass I will also send you a document which I beg\r\n    you to sign, for in any event the time is approaching when you\r\n    will receive one or the other. Besides yourself there are two\r\n    other men who also desire each a mass. I am resolved to write\r\n    at least three--the first is entirely finished, the second _not\r\n    yet_, the third not even begun; but in view of them I must have an\r\n    understanding so that I may be secured in any case. You may have\r\n    the Mass whenever you pay 1000 C. C.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THREE PURCHASERS FAIL TO GET THE MASS]\r\n\r\nSo far as Peters is concerned the matter must be dropped for a space;\r\nhe published none of the works sent to him, did not receive the Mass,\r\nand, refusing to take a quartet in return for the 360 florins which\r\nBeethoven collected in advance, placing the blame on him, got the money\r\nback from Beethoven some time after November, 1825. Peters did not\r\nget the Mass; nor did Simrock; nor did Schlesinger; nor did Probst,\r\nanother Leipsic publisher with whom Beethoven carried on negotiations\r\nfor it and the Ninth Symphony, as will appear later; nor did Artaria,\r\nBeethoven’s old publisher who, in all likelihood, was one of the “two\r\nother men” of whom Beethoven wrote in the letter last quoted. On August\r\n23, 1822, Artaria received a letter which, as it seems to stand alone\r\nso far as the Mass is concerned, may well be printed in full:\r\n\r\n    Being just now overwhelmed with work, I can only say briefly that I\r\n    have always returned your favors whenever possible. As regards the\r\n    Mass I have been offered 1000 florins, C. C. for it. The state of\r\n    my affairs do not permit me to take a smaller honorarium from you.\r\n    All that I can do is to _give you the preference_. Rest assured\r\n    that I do not _take a heller more from you than_ has been _offered\r\n    me by others_. I could prove this to you in writing. You may think\r\n    this over but I beg of you to send me an answer by _to-morrow noon_\r\n    as to-morrow is postday and my decision is expected in other places.\r\n\r\n    I will make a proposition to you concerning the 150 florins C. C.\r\n    which I owe you, but the sum must not be deducted now, as I am in\r\n    urgent need of the 1000 florins. In addition I beg of you to keep\r\n    everything secret about the Mass.\r\n\r\nIt must long ago have been observed by the studious reader of these\r\npages that a great deal of illuminative material in the life-story\r\nof Beethoven is found in the correspondence between the composer and\r\nhis publishers; but these letters in the later years of his life, and\r\nespecially in the period with which we are now concerned, were but\r\nsorry guides to the state of forwardness in which compositions found\r\nthemselves at any stated time. Frequently they offer for publication\r\nworks which, so far as they had been fixed on paper at all, existed\r\nonly in the form of detached sketches; also some which, so far as we\r\nknow, existed only in the plans or purposes of the composer of which\r\nthe letters themselves are the only surviving records. It seems also\r\nto be a fair deduction from them that Beethoven’s attitude towards\r\nhis publishers with reference to them depended to a considerable\r\nextent on his temporary financial condition, and sometimes they are\r\nan index of that consecration to high artistic ideals of which he\r\nremains an unapproached exemplar. The Mass in D is almost always\r\nready for delivery when he is in financial extremities; but when he\r\nhas helped himself with loans or the collection of advances, or\r\nthe sale of old manuscripts or potboilers, his insatiable desire to\r\nrevise, amend and improve his great work takes possession of him, and\r\nthe vast amount of rewriting and recopying thus entailed pushes its\r\nultimate completion into the future and precipitates another period\r\nof distress. He borrowed money from Brentano on the strength of the\r\ndeposit which Simrock had made in Frankfort; collected the honorarium\r\nwhich Peters had advanced on the purchase of long undelivered songs,\r\nbagatelles and marches; postponed the evil day of liquidation with\r\nSteiner; finally borrowed money from his brother Johann, and to secure\r\nthe debt practically hypothecated to him all the manuscripts which\r\nlay finished and unfinished in his desk by placing their sale in his\r\nhands, subject to his instructions and advice. This circumstance brings\r\nJohann van Beethoven back significantly into this history and invites\r\nan inquiry into his character and his conduct with reference to his\r\nfamous brother. That, contemptible as his character may have been,\r\nhe has yet been maligned and his conduct towards Beethoven falsified\r\nby Schindler and the romance writers who have accepted Schindler’s\r\nmisrepresentations and embellished them with the products of their own\r\nunscrupulous imaginations, is scarcely open to doubt.\r\n\r\nSomething of the earlier history of Johann van Beethoven has been\r\ntold in the chapters of this biography which deal with the incidents\r\nof the years 1808 and 1812. The brother, whose association with a\r\nwoman obnoxious to him because of her frivolousness and moral laxity\r\nBeethoven sought to prevent by police methods and thereby only\r\nprecipitated a marriage, had grown rich enough in the interim to buy\r\nsome farm property near Gneixendorf and to make his winter residence\r\nin Vienna. There we find him in the spring of 1822 living in the house\r\nof his brother-in-law, a baker named Obermayer, at the intersection of\r\nKoth- and Pfarrgassen. Thenceforward for a number of years, because of\r\nhis relationship to his famous brother, his idiosyncrasies, habits and\r\npublic behavior (and to a smaller number, the conduct of his wife), he\r\nbecame a conspicuous and rather comical figure in Vienna. Gerhard von\r\nBreuning described him thus:[55]\r\n\r\n    His hair was blackish-brown; hat well brushed; clothing clean\r\n    but suggesting that of a man who wishes to be elegantly clad on\r\n    Sundays; somewhat old-fashioned and uncouth, an effect which was\r\n    caused by his bone-structure, which was angular and unlovely. His\r\n    waist was rather small; no sign of embonpoint; shoulders broad; if\r\n    my memory serves me rightly, his shoulders were a trifle uneven,\r\n    or it may have been his angular figure which made him look\r\n    unsymmetrical; his clothing generally consisted of a blue frockcoat\r\n    with brass buttons, white necktie, light trousers (I think corn\r\n    color), loose linen-thread gloves, the fingers too long so that\r\n    they folded at the ends or stuck out loosely. His hands were broad\r\n    and bony. He was not exactly tall of stature, but much taller than\r\n    Ludwig. His nose was large and rather long, the position of his\r\n    eyes, crooked, the effect being as if he squinted a little with one\r\n    eye. The mouth was crooked, one corner drawn upwards giving him\r\n    the expression of a mocking smile. In his garb he affected to be\r\n    a well-to-do elegant, but the role did not suit his angular, bony\r\n    figure. He did not in the least resemble his brother Ludwig.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CHARACTER OF JOHANN VAN BEETHOVEN]\r\n\r\nBreuning also says in his book “Aus dem Schwarzspanierhause,” that\r\nhe was sometimes seen driving in the Prater with two or four horses\r\nin an old-fashioned phaeton, either handling the reins himself or\r\nlolling carelessly in the seat with two gallooned servants on the box.\r\nBeethoven’s friends used to ridicule his brother to his face. In a\r\nConversation Book of 1822-23 Count Moritz Lichnowsky writes: “Everybody\r\nthinks him a fool; we call him only the Chevalier--all the world says\r\nof him that his only merit is that he bears your name.” No doubt there\r\nwas something, even a good deal, of the parvenu in Johann’s character.\r\nHe had neither the intellectual nor moral poise to fit him for the\r\nplace which he thought he was entitled to fill by virtue of his wealth\r\nand his relationship to one of the most famous men of his age. Nor\r\ncould he command respect from a social point of view. How far from\r\nabove reproach his wife was, Beethoven showed by his unjustifiable\r\nconduct when he sought to have her ejected from Linz in order to\r\nseparate her from his brother. That conduct Ludwig’s letters, soon to\r\nbe quoted, show had been condoned by him, but a memorandum found among\r\nSchindler’s papers discloses that her conduct in Vienna was such that\r\nBeethoven again thought of invoking the police.[56]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A DEFENSE OF THE OLDER BROTHER]\r\n\r\nThat Johann van Beethoven was fond of money is indicated in his remarks\r\nin the Conversation Books, when his advice to his brother is always\r\ndictated by financial considerations and, no doubt, by the thoughts of\r\nprofits in which he hoped to share. But what would you? For what other\r\npurposes had Beethoven asked him in to his councils? Surely not to get\r\nhis views on the artistic value of his work. He defers in his letters\r\nto his brother’s superior business sagacity--that is all. It does not\r\nanywhere appear that Johann ever attempted to overreach him or lead\r\nhim to financial injury. No doubt Beethoven in his fits of anger said\r\nmany things about him which put him in a bad light before his friends;\r\nbut did he not do the same thing in their own cases? Did Schindler\r\nescape calumny? The better evidence is that offered by the letters\r\nwhich show that Beethoven had confidence in his brother’s honesty and\r\njudgment, invited his help, and was solicitous lest he suffer loss\r\nfrom his efforts. If Johann lacked appreciation of his brother’s real\r\nsignificance in art, he was proud of the world’s appreciation of him,\r\nand if he could not have high regard for that high moral attitude in\r\nthe matter which had brought condemnation on his sister-in-law and\r\nwife, he at least showed magnanimity in not trying to do his brother\r\ninjury and being always ready to help him when he could. It is very\r\nlikely that he was not at all musical and that his affectation of\r\nappreciation of his brother’s works made him a fair subject for\r\nridicule. But surely there was little moral obliquity in that. In a\r\nconversation in 1824 the nephew relates that his uncle had been present\r\nat a chamber concert. Beethoven wants to know what he was doing there,\r\nand the nephew replies: “He wants to acquire taste; he is continually\r\ncrying _bravo_.” So also Holz relates, in 1826, that Johann had\r\ncertainly heard the Quartet in E-flat major ten times, yet when it was\r\nplayed in that year he said he was hearing it for the first time.[57]\r\n\r\nBeethoven needed Johann’s help; he had a good opinion of his business\r\nability, and it is possible that he had learned something of tolerance\r\nfrom the trials and tribulations which his quarrels with his other\r\nsister-in-law had brought him. It is certain that after a separation\r\nof nine years from his brother he was not merely desirous but eager\r\nfor a perfect reconciliation and a closer union. Johann offers his\r\nhelp, but it is Beethoven who expresses the wish that the two may\r\nlive together, it is Beethoven who asks his brother to come to him\r\nand help him negotiate the sale of his compositions. Johann no doubt\r\nconducted some negotiations without his brother’s knowledge, but not\r\nwithout authority; and so far as the Mass is concerned it is put into\r\nthe brother’s hands only after Johann has lent Beethoven 200 florins\r\nand the Mass has been promised not only to Peters but to Simrock before\r\nhim. No doubt Johann exceeded his authority; at least, something had\r\ncome to the ears of Count Moritz Lichnowsky, probably from Beethoven\r\nhimself, which made him say in the conversation already cited, “You\r\nought to forbid him doing business or carrying on correspondence\r\nwithout your signature. Perhaps he has already closed a contract in\r\nyour name”; but would it not have been better for Beethoven’s present\r\nreputation for business honesty--if we must distinguish between the\r\nethics of the counting-house and those of the rest of the world--if he\r\nhad closed and kept the contracts which he had made when he called his\r\nbrother to help him with his correspondence? Schindler accuses Johann\r\nof having persuaded Beethoven to take unfit lodgings; but Beethoven\r\nexpressly exonerates him from blame. He reproaches Johann for not\r\nhaving provided his brother with money to pay his debts or offering his\r\nsecurity for them; but Johann lent him 200 florins before he went to\r\nBaden and probably did not see why he should burden his own business\r\nenterprises in order to enable Beethoven to keep the bank shares intact\r\nfor the nephew. He was willing to be helpful, however, and repeatedly\r\noffered his brother a house on his estate, and in 1824 tried to\r\npersuade him to take one rent free; but Beethoven’s antipathy to his\r\nsister-in-law would not let him accept.\r\n\r\nExactly when Beethoven went to Oberdöbling in the summer of 1822\r\nis not known, but he was there in July, and an endorsement on the\r\nSimrock letter of May 13 would seem to indicate that he was there in\r\nthat month. His lodgings were in No. 135 Alleegasse. In the spring or\r\nearly summer he writes to Johann begging him, instead of driving in\r\nthe Prater, to come to him with his wife and step-daughter. His whole\r\ndesire is for the good which would inevitably follow a union. He had\r\nmade inquiries about lodgings and found that it would not be necessary\r\nto pay much more than at Oberdöbling, and that, without sacrifice of\r\nany pleasure, much money might be saved for both. He says:\r\n\r\n    I have nothing against your wife; I only wish that she might\r\n    realize how much you might benefit from being with me and that all\r\n    the miserable trifles of this life ought to cause no disturbances.\r\n\r\n    Peace, peace be with us. God grant that the most natural tie\r\n    between brothers be not unnaturally broken. At the best my life\r\n    may not be of long duration. I say again that I have nothing\r\n    against your wife, although her behavior towards me has struck me\r\n    as strange several times of late; besides, I have been ailing for\r\n    three and a half months and extremely sensitive and irritable. But\r\n    away with everything which does not _promote the object_, which is,\r\n    that I and my good Karl lead a regular life which is so necessary\r\n    to me.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEETHOVEN ASKS JOHANN’S HELP]\r\n\r\nHere there is no mention of business matters and hence it may be\r\nassumed that the letter dates from an early period in the reunion of\r\nthe brothers. But business considerations prompt a letter of July 26 in\r\nwhich he tells Johann that his physician had ordered him to go to Baden\r\nto take thirty baths and that he would make the journey on August 6 or\r\n7. Meanwhile he would like to have his brother come to him and give him\r\nhis help and then accompany him to Baden and remain there a week. He\r\nwas engaged, he said, upon corrections of the Mass for which Peters was\r\nto give him 1000 florins. Peters had also agreed to take some smaller\r\nworks and had sent 300 florins, but he had not yet accepted the money.\r\nBreitkopf and Härtel had also sent the Saxon _Chargé d’Affaires_ to him\r\nto talk about new works and inquiries had come from Paris and Diabelli\r\nin Vienna. Publishers were now struggling for his works: “What an\r\n_unfortunate fortunate_ am I!!!--this Berliner has also turned up--if\r\nmy health would return I might yet _feather my nest_ (_auf einen grünen\r\nZweig kommen_).”\r\n\r\n    The Archduke-Cardinal is here. I go to him twice a week. Though\r\n    there is nothing to be expected from him in the way of magnanimity\r\n    or money, I am on such a good and confidential footing with him\r\n    that it would be extremely painful not to show him some agreeable\r\n    attention; moreover, I do not think that his apparent niggardliness\r\n    is his fault.\r\n\r\nIn the same letter he says he might have had the 1000 florins from\r\nPeters in advance but did not want to take them. He did not want to\r\n“expose” himself, and he therefore asked his brother for a loan,\r\nso that his trip to Baden might not be delayed. There was no risk\r\ninvolved, as he would return the 200 florins in September with thanks.\r\n“As a merchant you are a good counsellor,” are some of his words. The\r\nSteiners are also crowding him into a corner and trying to force him\r\ninto a written agreement to let them have all his compositions; but he\r\nhad declared that he would not enter into such an arrangement until his\r\naccount had been settled, and to that end he had proposed to them that\r\nthey take two pieces which he had written for Hungary[58] and which\r\nmight be looked upon as two little operas. They had before then taken\r\nfour of the numbers. The debt to the Steiners amounted to 3000 florins,\r\nbut they had in the “most abominable manner” charged interest, to which\r\nhe would not consent. Part of the debt had been Karl’s mother’s[59]\r\nwhich he had assumed because he wanted to show himself as kindly\r\ndisposed as possible, so that Karl’s interests would not be endangered.\r\nAgain he urges him to come to Baden and to put pantry and cellar in the\r\nbest of condition against September, for presumably he and his little\r\nson would set up headquarters with him and had formed the noble resolve\r\nto eat him out of house and home.\r\n\r\nIn this letter was enclosed a memorandum of the deposit of 300 florins\r\n(from Peters) to his credit at Maisl’s; and another of no date, but\r\nevidently written at about the same time, stated that the money was\r\nat Maisl’s but in case of need he would rather make a loan than draw\r\nit, “for the Mass will be ready on the 15th of next month.” He went to\r\nBaden on September 1, but before then wrote again to Johann expressing\r\na wish to see him so that the affair with Steiner might be settled, it\r\nbeing necessary to have the music to “The Ruins of Athens”[60] in print\r\nby the end of October, when the theatre for which it had been prepared\r\nwould be opened. A week after his arrival in Baden, on September 8,\r\nhe writes that he had been disturbed at the delay, partly because of\r\nhis brother’s ill health, partly because he had had no report on the\r\ncommission undertaken with Steiner. Simrock had written again about the\r\nMass, but had mentioned the old price; if he were written to, however,\r\nhe thought he would increase it. Two singers had called on him that day\r\nand asked to kiss his hands, “but as they were very pretty I suggested\r\nthat they kiss my lips.” Another letter obviously written about the\r\nsame time but a little later tells of his temporary apprehension lest\r\nhis brother had fallen out with Steiner. He also suspected that his\r\nbrother might be angered at his not having mentioned the loan. In\r\nthis dilemma, fearful for the Mass, he had written to Simrock that he\r\nwould let him have it for 1000 florins. “But as you write that you\r\nwant the Mass I am agreed, but I do not want you to lose anything by\r\nit.” Matters are not yet straightened out at Steiner’s, as appears\r\nfrom a letter which he encloses. Meanwhile the Josephstadt Theatre\r\nhas given him work to do which will be quite burdensome, in view of\r\nhis cure, Staudenheimer having advised him to take baths of one and a\r\nhalf hour’s duration. However, he already had written a chorus with\r\ndances and solo songs;[61] if his health allows, he will also write\r\na new overture. On October 6, he addresses his brother in a jocular\r\nmood: “Best of little Brothers! Owner of all the lands in the Danube\r\nnear Krems! Director of the entire Austrian Pharmacy!” The letter\r\ncontains a proposition for Steiner concerning the Josephstadt Theatre\r\nmusic. Steiner has two numbers already and has advertised one of them;\r\nthere are eight numbers left, including an overture. These Steiner can\r\nhave at the following rates: the overture 30 (perhaps he could get 40\r\nducats); four songs with instrumental accompaniment, 20 ducats each;\r\ntwo wholly instrumental numbers, 10 ducats each:--total, 140 ducats.\r\nIf “King Stephen” is wanted there are twelve numbers of which four are\r\nto be reckoned at 20 ducats each, the others at 10 ducats and one at 5\r\nducats--_summa summarum_ 155 ducats. “Concerning the new overture, you\r\nmay say to them that the old one could not remain, because in Hungary\r\nthe piece was given as a postlude, while here the theatre was opened\r\nwith it.... Ponder the matter of the Mass well, because I must answer\r\nSimrock; unless you lose nothing, I beg of you not to undertake it.”\r\n\r\nThe story of the music composed and adapted for the Josephstadt Theatre\r\nwill be told in the chronological narrative of incidents belonging\r\nto the year; as for the Mass let it be noted that after Johann had\r\nexpressed a desire to take it in hand we hear nothing more of the\r\ncorrespondence with Peters for a long time. The autograph score was\r\nready; Beethoven had it copied, but continued making alterations in it;\r\nnot until the next year was it delivered into the hands of the Archduke\r\nand new efforts made towards its publication.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1822, Beethoven still lived at No. 244\r\nHauptstrasse, Landstrasse, Vienna. The first significant happening\r\nto him in the new year was his election as honorary member of the\r\nMusik-Verein of Steiermark in Gratz, whose diploma, couched in the\r\nextravagantly sentimental verbiage of the day and country, bore date\r\nJanuary 1. He noted the conclusion of the C minor Sonata (Op. 111)\r\non the autograph manuscript on January 11. Bernhard Romberg, the\r\nvioloncello virtuoso, was in Vienna in the beginning of the year,\r\ngiving concerts with his daughter Bernhardine and a son of 11 years,\r\nwho was also a budding virtuoso on his father’s instrument. On February\r\n12, Beethoven writes to his old friend that if he was not present at\r\nthe concert, it would be because he had been attacked with an earache,\r\nthe pain of which would be aggravated even by the concert-giver’s\r\ntones. He concluded the letter with the wish in addition “to the\r\nfullest tribute of applause, also the _metallic recognition_ which\r\nhigh art seldom receives in these days.” If Hanslick is correct in his\r\nhistory of concert life in Vienna, Beethoven’s wish was fulfilled:\r\nRomberg’s earnings during the Vienna season amounted to 10,000 florins.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ADVICES FROM LONDON THROUGH NEATE]\r\n\r\nWhen Beethoven went to Oberdöbling he moved into the house Alleegasse\r\n135, but for the time being kept his lodgings in town. In Oberdöbling\r\nhe began a treatment consisting of taking powders and drinking the\r\nwaters. He worked on the Mass, the Ninth Symphony, and on smaller\r\ncompositions from which he expected quicker returns. He was expected to\r\nvisit Archduke Rudolph twice a week, but the attendance was irregular.\r\nApplications for his works came to him from other cities and Breitkopf\r\nand Härtel sent the Chargé d’Affaires of the Saxon Legation to him\r\nwith a letter regretting that the business connection which formerly\r\nexisted had been discontinued and expressing a desire to renew it with\r\nan opera. The messenger was Greisinger, Haydn’s first biographer, who\r\nhad made Beethoven’s acquaintance as a young man. He was musical, and\r\nBeethoven applied to him for advice the next year, when he sent an\r\ninvitation to the Saxon Court for a subscription to the Mass in D. On\r\nSeptember 2, Beethoven received a letter from Charles Neate, which\r\nwas plainly an answer to an appeal which had been sent by Beethoven,\r\nconcerning the publication in London of three quartets. Letters\r\nfrom Ries refer to the same quartets, which as yet existed only in\r\nBeethoven’s intentions. Neate says that he had found it difficult\r\nto obtain subscriptions for the works. He thought, however, that he\r\nmight still be able to raise £100, but could not get any money before\r\nthe arrival of the works in London. There was also apprehension that\r\nthe compositions would be copied in Vienna. Beethoven had referred\r\nto a quartet and possibly some successors in his correspondence with\r\nPeters, so that it is more than likely that a determination to return\r\nto the quartet field had been formed by Beethoven before the practical\r\nand material incentive came to him in the last month of the year from\r\nPrince Galitzin--the incentive to which we owe three of the last five\r\nQuartets.\r\n\r\nThere must now be recorded some of the facts connected with the\r\nvisit to Beethoven of a distinguished musical littérateur from\r\nLeipsic--Friedrich Rochlitz. Rochlitz arrived in Vienna on May 24\r\nand remained there till August 2. He wrote two letters about his\r\nexperiences in the Austrian capital, one under date of June 28, the\r\nother of July 9. The latter contained his account of his meetings\r\nwith Beethoven and is reprinted in Vol. IV of his “Für Freunde der\r\nTonkunst.” He had never seen Beethoven in the flesh and was eager for\r\na meeting. A friend to whom he went (it is very obvious that it was\r\nHaslinger) told him that Beethoven was in the country and had grown\r\nso shy of human society that a visit to him might prove unavailing;\r\nbut it was Beethoven’s custom to come to Vienna every week and he was\r\nthen as a rule affable and approachable. He advised Rochlitz to wait,\r\nand he did so until the following Saturday. The meeting was a pleasant\r\none and enabled Rochlitz to study Beethoven’s appearance and manner;\r\nbut the interview was suddenly terminated by Beethoven in the midst\r\nof the visitor’s confession of his own admiration and the enthusiasm\r\nwhich Beethoven’s symphonies created in Leipsic. From the beginning\r\nBeethoven had listened, smiled and nodded, but after he had curtly\r\nexcused himself on the score of an engagement and departed abruptly,\r\nRochlitz learned that his auditor had not heard or understood a word\r\nof all that he had said. A fortnight later Rochlitz met Franz Schubert\r\nin the street, who told him that if he wanted to see Beethoven in\r\nan unconstrained and jovial mood he should go along with him to an\r\neating-house where the great man dined. He went and found Beethoven\r\nsitting with a party of friends whom the chronicler did not know.\r\nThough he got a nod of recognition for his greeting he did not join\r\nthe party but took a seat near enough to observe Beethoven and hear\r\nwhat he said, for he spoke in a loud voice. It was not a conversation\r\nso much as a monologue to which he listened. Beethoven talked almost\r\nincessantly; his companions laughed, smiled and nodded approval.\r\n\r\n    He philosophised and politicised in his manner. He spoke of England\r\n    and the English, whom he surrounded with incomparable glory--which\r\n    sounded strange at times. Then he told many anecdotes of the French\r\n    and the two occupations of Vienna. He was not amiably disposed\r\n    towards them. He talked freely, without the least restraint,\r\n    seasoning everything with highly original and naïve opinions and\r\n    comical conceits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONVERSATION WITH FRIEDRICH ROCHLITZ]\r\n\r\nAfter finishing his meal Beethoven approached Rochlitz and beckoned him\r\ninto a little anteroom, where conversation was carried on with the help\r\nof a tablet which Beethoven produced. He began with praise of Leipsic\r\nand its music, especially the performances in church, concert-room and\r\ntheatre; outside of these things he knows nothing of Leipsic, through\r\nwhich he passed as a youth on his way to Vienna. (No doubt it was the\r\nBerlin trip to which Beethoven referred, of which Rochlitz appears to\r\nbe ignorant.) Praise of Leipsic was followed by violent condemnation\r\nof Vienna and its music.\r\n\r\n    Of my works you hear nothing. Now--in summer.\r\n\r\n    No; it’s the same in winter. What is there for them to hear?\r\n    “Fidelio”? they can’t perform it and do not want to hear it. The\r\n    symphonies? For these they have no time. The concertos? Everybody\r\n    grinds out his own productions. The solos? They’re out of fashion\r\n    long ago--and fashion is everything. At the best, Schuppanzigh\r\n    occasionally digs up a quartet, etc.\r\n\r\nRochlitz is here probably helping out his memory by drawing a bit\r\non his fancy; Schuppanzigh was at this time still in Russia, having\r\nstarted on a tour through Germany, Poland and Russia in 1815, from\r\nwhich he did not return till 1823. Rochlitz is interesting, but it is\r\nwell to revise his utterances by occasional appeals to known facts. He\r\ngoes on: Beethoven asked him if he lived in Weimar and Rochlitz shook\r\nhis head. “Then you do not know the great Goethe?” Rochlitz nodded\r\nviolently in affirmation that he did know the great Goethe. “I do, too;\r\nI got acquainted with him in Carlsbad--God knows how long ago!” (But it\r\nwas not in Carlsbad that Beethoven met Goethe; it was in Teplitz and\r\nten years “ago.”) Beethoven continued: “I was not so deaf then as I am\r\nnow, but hard of hearing. How patient the great man was with me!...\r\nHow happy he made me then! I would have gone to my death for him; yes,\r\nten times! It was while I was in the ardor of this enthusiasm that I\r\nthought out my music to his ‘Egmont’--and it is a success, isn’t it?” A\r\nsuccess, surely; but Beethoven is not likely to have forgotten that the\r\nmusic to “Egmont” was two years old when he met Goethe. Rochlitz, it is\r\nto be feared, is indulging his imagination again; but he is probably\r\ncorrect on the whole. Let Beethoven proceed with his monologue:\r\n\r\n    Since that summer I read Goethe every day, when I read at all. He\r\n    has killed Klopstock for me. You are surprised? Now you smile? Aha!\r\n    You smile that I should have read Klopstock! I gave myself up to\r\n    him many years,--when I took my walks and at other times. Ah well!\r\n    I didn’t understand him always. He is so restless; and he always\r\n    begins too far away, from on high down; always _Maestoso_, D-flat\r\n    major! Isn’t it so? But he’s great, nevertheless, and uplifts the\r\n    soul. When I did not understand I divined pretty nearly. But why\r\n    should he always want to die? That will come soon enough. Well; at\r\n    least he always sounds well, etc. But Goethe:--he lives and wants\r\n    us all to live with him. That’s the reason he can be composed.\r\n    Nobody else can be so easily composed as he.\r\n\r\nRochlitz had sought Beethoven with a commission from Härtel:--that he\r\ncompose music for Goethe’s “Faust” like that written for “Egmont.” The\r\npsychological moment for broaching the subject was arrived and Rochlitz\r\nmade the communication on the tablet.\r\n\r\n    He read. “Ha!” he cried, and threw his hands high in the air. “That\r\n    would be a piece of work! Something might come out of that!” He\r\n    continued for a while in this manner, elaborating his ideas at once\r\n    and with bowed head staring at the ceiling. “But,” he continued,\r\n    after a while, “I have been occupied for a considerable time with\r\n    three other big works; much of them is already hatched out--i. e.,\r\n    in my head. I must rid myself of them first; two large symphonies\r\n    differing from each other, and an oratorio. They will take a long\r\n    time; for, you see, for some time I can’t bring myself to write\r\n    easily. I sit and think, and think. The ideas are there, but they\r\n    will not go down on the paper. I dread the beginning of great\r\n    works; once begun, it’s all right.”\r\n\r\nMost of this is in harmony with what we know from other sources. We\r\nhave seen how laboriously Beethoven developed the works of large\r\ndimensions in this period; we know that he had thought of “Faust” as a\r\nsubject for composition as early as 1808[62] and that it pursued him\r\nin his last years. But Härtel’s proposition sent through Greisinger\r\nin the same year was for an opera, and it seems likely that the\r\n“Faust” idea was independent of it and possibly an original conceit of\r\nRochlitz’s. Be that as it may, Rochlitz did make one proposition in\r\nwhich his interest was personal. After his return to Leipsic he wrote\r\na letter to Haslinger on September 10, 1822, in which he expressed\r\nthe wish that Beethoven would give a musical setting to his poem “Der\r\nerste Ton,” and, if Schindler is correct, he suggested to Beethoven\r\nhimself that he write music for his “Preis der Tonkunst.” Nothing came\r\nof the suggestions, though it would appear that Rochlitz had discussed\r\nboth poems with Beethoven. There was a third meeting at which the\r\ntwo, in company with another friend of Beethoven’s (Rochlitz says it\r\nwas Gebauer), made a promenade through a valley which lasted from ten\r\no’clock in the forenoon till six o’clock in the evening. Beethoven\r\nenlivened the walk with conversation full of tirades against existing\r\nconditions, humorous anecdotes and drolleries. “In all seriousness,\r\nhe seems amiable, or, if this word startle you, I say: The gloomy,\r\nunlicked bear is so winning and confiding, growls and shakes his hairy\r\ncoat so harmlessly and curiously, that it is delightful, and one could\r\nnot help liking him even if he were but a bear and had done nothing but\r\nwhat a bear can do.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEETHOVEN’S OPINION OF ROSSINI]\r\n\r\nThe meeting between Rochlitz and Beethoven took place in Baden; but\r\nas we have seen, the latter did not begin his sojourn there until\r\nSeptember 1, and Rochlitz’s letter is dated July 9; so it would appear\r\nthat Beethoven had come from Oberdöbling on a visit to Baden; Schindler\r\nsays nothing to the contrary. Earlier in 1822 Beethoven received a\r\nvisit from a man who lies considerably nearer the sympathies of the\r\ngeneration for which this book is written than Rochlitz. This man was\r\nRossini. His operas had been on the current list in Vienna for several\r\nyears, and with the coming of the composer in person, in the spring of\r\n1822, the enthusiasm for him and his music had grown into a fanatical\r\nadoration. Beethoven had seen the score of “Il Barbiere” and heard it\r\nsung by the best Italian singers of the period. Moreover, he had a\r\nhigh admiration for the Italian art of song and a very poor opinion of\r\nGerman singers. In Barbaja’s troupe were Lablache, Rubini, Donzelli and\r\nAmbroggio, and the Demoiselles Sontag, Ungher, Lalande and Dardanelli.\r\nRossini was on his wedding trip, having but recently married Colbran,\r\nand his elegant manners and brilliant conversation had made him the\r\nlion of aristocratic drawing-rooms in the Austrian capital. “Zelmira”\r\nhad been written especially for the Vienna season, though it had been\r\ntried at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples in the preceding December.\r\nIt had its first performance at the Kärnthnerthor Theatre on April\r\n13.[63] Several of Beethoven’s utterances concerning the musician,\r\nwho no doubt did much to divert the taste of the masses away from the\r\nGerman master’s compositions, have been preserved. Seyfried recorded\r\nthat in answer to the question. “What is Rossini?” Beethoven replied,\r\n“A good scene-painter,” and Seyfried also makes note of this utterance:\r\n“The Bohemians are born musicians; the Italians ought to take them as\r\nmodels. What have they to show for their famous conservatories? Behold\r\ntheir idol--Rossini! If Dame Fortune had not given him a pretty talent\r\nand pretty melodies by the bushel, what he learned at school would\r\nhave brought him nothing but potatoes for his big belly!” Schindler\r\nsays that after reading the score of “Il Barbiere” Beethoven said:\r\n“Rossini would have been a great composer if his teacher had frequently\r\napplied some blows _ad posteriora_.” To Freudenberg at Baden in 1824\r\nhe remarked: “Rossini is a talented and a melodious composer; his\r\nmusic suits the frivolous and sensuous spirit of the times, and his\r\nproductivity is so great that he needs only as many weeks as the\r\nGermans need years to write an opera.”\r\n\r\nThe Rossini craze was no doubt largely responsible for some of\r\nBeethoven’s outbreaks concerning the taste of the Viennese, but on\r\nthe whole he does not seem seriously to have been disturbed by it.\r\nSchindler cites him as remarking on the change in the popular attitude:\r\n“Well, they can not rob me of my place in musical history.” As for the\r\nItalian singers he thought so much of them that he told Caroline Ungher\r\nthat he would write an Italian opera for Barbaja’s company.\r\n\r\nAs for Rossini, he had heard some of Beethoven’s quartets played by\r\nMayseder and his associates, and had enjoyed them enthusiastically. It\r\nwas therefore natural enough that he should want to visit the composer.\r\nSchindler says that he went twice with Artaria to call upon him, after\r\nArtaria had each time asked permission, but that on both occasions\r\nBeethoven had asked to be excused from receiving him--a circumstance\r\nwhich had given rise to considerable comment in Vienna. The story\r\nis not true, but that it was current in Vienna four years afterward\r\nappears from an entry in a Conversation Book of August 1826 where\r\nsomebody asks: “It is true, isn’t it, that Rossini wanted to visit you\r\nand you refused to see him?” There is no written answer. We repeat:\r\nthe story is not true, though both Nohl and Wasielewski accepted it\r\nwithout demur. Twice, at least, Rossini publicly denied it. In 1867 Dr.\r\nEduard Hanslick visited him with two friends in Paris. Concerning the\r\ninterview, Hanslick wrote:[64]\r\n\r\n    Suddenly, as if he intentionally wanted to call attention to\r\n    something loftier, he asked if the Mozart monument at Vienna\r\n    was finished? And Beethoven’s? We three Austrians looked rather\r\n    embarrassed. “I remember Beethoven well,” continued Rossini after\r\n    a pause, “although it is nearly half a century ago. On my visit to\r\n    Vienna I hastened to look him up.”\r\n\r\n    “And he did not receive you, as Schindler and other biographers\r\n    assure us.”\r\n\r\n    “On the contrary,” said Rossini, correcting me: “I had Carpani, the\r\n    Italian poet with whom I had already called upon Salieri, introduce\r\n    me, and he received me at once and very politely. True, the visit\r\n    did not last very long, for conversation with Beethoven was nothing\r\n    less than painful. His hearing was particularly bad on that day\r\n    and in spite of my loudest shoutings he could not understand me;\r\n    his little practice in Italian may have made conversation more\r\n    difficult.”\r\n\r\nThis confirms what Rossini told Ferdinand Hiller in 1856:[65]\r\n\r\n    During my sojourn in Vienna I had myself introduced to him by old\r\n    Calpani [_sic_]; but between his deafness and my ignorance of\r\n    German, conversation was impossible. But I am glad that I saw him,\r\n    at least.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ALLEGED MEETING OF BEETHOVEN AND SCHUBERT]\r\n\r\nQuite as inaccurate is a statement of Schindler’s touching a meeting\r\nbetween Schubert and Beethoven in this year. Schindler’s story is to\r\nthe effect that Schubert, accompanied by Diabelli, went to Beethoven\r\nand handed him the variations for pianoforte, four hands, which he had\r\ndedicated to him; but that Schubert was so overwhelmed at the majestic\r\nappearance of Beethoven that his courage oozed away and he was scarcely\r\nable to write the answers to the questions which were put to him.\r\nAt length, when Beethoven pointed out a trifling error in harmony,\r\nremarking that it was “not a mortal sin,” Schubert lost control of\r\nhimself completely, regained his composure only after he had left the\r\nhouse, and never again had courage enough to appear in Beethoven’s\r\npresence. As opposed to this, Heinrich von Kreissle, Schubert’s\r\nbiographer, adduces the testimony of Joseph Hüttenbrenner, a close\r\nfriend of Schubert’s, who had it from the song composer himself that\r\nhe had gone to Beethoven’s house with the variations, but the great\r\nman was not at home and the variations were left with the servant.\r\nHe had neither seen Beethoven nor spoken with him, but learned with\r\ndelight afterwards that Beethoven had been pleased with the variations\r\nand often played them with his nephew Karl. Now, had Schindler been an\r\neyewitness of the scene which he describes, he would have mentioned the\r\nfact; but he was not yet living with Beethoven.\r\n\r\nWhile in Baden, Beethoven began the work which was to call him\r\nback into public notice. This was the music for the opening of the\r\nJosephstadt Theatre, which the director of the theatre, Carl Friedrich\r\nHensler, director also of the combined theatres of Pressburg and Baden,\r\nasked of him immediately after his arrival at the watering-place.\r\nHensler (1761-1825) was a popular dramatist as well as manager and an\r\nold acquaintance of Beethoven’s, by whom he was greatly respected.\r\nHe had bought the privilege of the Josephstadt Theatre in Vienna.\r\nCarl Meisl, who was a Commissioner of the Royal Imperial Navy, had\r\nwritten two festival pieces for the opening, which had been set down\r\nfor October 3, 1822, the name-day of the Emperor. The first piece was\r\na paraphrase of Kotzebue’s “Ruins of Athens,” written for the opening\r\nof the theatre in Pesth in 1812, for which Beethoven had composed the\r\nmusic. Meisl took Kotzebue’s text and made such alterations in it as\r\nwere necessary to change “The Ruins of Athens” into “The Consecration\r\nof the House.” Nottebohm’s reprint in “Zweite Beethoveniana” (p. 385\r\n_et seq._) enables a comparison to be made with the piece as it left\r\nthe hands of Meisl and the original. The new words did not always fit\r\nthe music and caused Beethoven considerable concern. A choral dance:\r\n\r\n    Wo sich die Pulse\r\n    jugendlich jagen,\r\n    Schwebet im Tanze\r\n    das Leben dahin, etc.\r\n\r\nwas introduced and to this Beethoven had to write new music, which\r\nhe did in September. He also revised, altered and extended the march\r\nwith chorus.[66] Beethoven wrote a new overture also, that known as\r\n“Consecration of the House,” putting aside the overture to “The Ruins\r\nof Athens” because that play had served as a second piece, or epilogue,\r\nat Pesth. Schindler says he began work on this occasional music in\r\nJuly, after the last touches had been given to the Mass; but progress\r\nwas not as rapid as was desirable because of the extreme hot weather.\r\nHe also says it was in Baden and that he was there with him. The\r\nletters to Johann show, however, that Beethoven did not go to Baden\r\ntill September 1, having before that been in Oberdöbling. But he wrote\r\nthe new pieces in Baden. On a revised copy of the chorus “Wo sich die\r\nPulse” Beethoven wrote: “Written towards the end of September, 1823,\r\nperformed on October 3 at the Josephstadt Theatre.” The 1823 should be\r\n1822, of course, but singularly enough the same blunder was made on a\r\ncopy of the overture and another composition, the “Gratulatory Minuet,”\r\nwhich was written about the same time. The explanation is probably\r\nthat offered by Nottebohm, viz.: that Beethoven dated the copies\r\nwhen he sent them to the Archduke. Beethoven’s remark in a letter to\r\nJohann that he had finished the chorus with dances and would write the\r\noverture if his health allowed, also fixes the date of the composition\r\nof the overture in September. This Schindler, though in error about the\r\nwork done in July, confirms in this anecdote about the origin of the\r\noverture:\r\n\r\n    Meanwhile September was come. It was therefore time to go to work\r\n    on the new overture, for the master had long ago seen that that\r\n    to “The Ruins of Athens” was for obvious reasons unsuitable. One\r\n    day, while I was walking with him and his nephew in the lovely\r\n    Helenenthal near Baden, Beethoven told us to go on in advance and\r\n    join him at an appointed place. It was not long before he overtook\r\n    us, remarking that he had written down two motives for an overture.\r\n    At the same time he expressed himself also as to the manner in\r\n    which he purposed treating them--one in the free style and one\r\n    in the strict, and, indeed, in Handel’s. As well as his voice\r\n    permitted he sang the two motives and then asked us which we liked\r\n    the better. This shows the roseate mood into which for the moment\r\n    he was thrown by the discovery of two gems for which, perhaps, he\r\n    had been hunting a long time. The nephew decided in favor of both,\r\n    while I expressed a desire to see the fugal theme worked out for\r\n    the purpose mentioned. It is not to be understood that Beethoven\r\n    wrote the overture “Zur Weihe des Hauses” as he did because I\r\n    wanted it so, but because he had long cherished the plan to write\r\n    an overture in the strict, expressly in the Handelian, style.\r\n\r\nThe overture was written. “The newly organized orchestra of the\r\nJosephstadt Theatre did not receive it till the afternoon before the\r\nopening, and with innumerable mistakes in every part. The rehearsal\r\nwhich took place in the presence of an almost filled parterre, scarcely\r\nsufficed for the correction of the worst of the copyist’s errors.” The\r\noverture and chorus written for “The Consecration of the House” are\r\n“occasionals” and were conceived and wrought out in a remarkably short\r\ntime for that period in Beethoven’s activities. The first was offered\r\nfor publication to Steiner and, with other pieces, to Diabelli. The\r\nnegotiations failed and the overture finally appeared from the press of\r\nSchott in 1825, with a dedication to Prince Galitzin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: OPENING OF THE JOSEPHSTADT THEATRE]\r\n\r\nThe performance of “The Consecration of the House” took place as\r\nprojected, on October 3, the eve of the Emperor’s name-day. All of\r\nthe 400 reserved seats and 14 boxes had been sold several weeks\r\nbefore. Beethoven had reserved the direction for himself and sat at\r\nthe pianoforte, the greater part of the orchestra within view, his\r\nleft ear turned towards the stage. He was still able to hear a little\r\nwith that ear, as we know from the fact related by Schindler, that he\r\nwas fond of listening to Cherubini’s overture to “Medea” played by a\r\nmusical clock which stood in a restaurant adjoining the Josephstadt\r\nTheatre. Chapelmaster Franz Gläser stood at his right, and Schindler,\r\nwho had recently abandoned the law, led the first violins. At the\r\ndress rehearsal Fanny Heckermann sang timidly and dragged perceptibly\r\nin the duet. Beethoven observed this and called the singer to him,\r\npointed out the places in which he wanted more animation, spoke some\r\nwords of encouragement and advised her to follow the tenor, who was\r\nan experienced singer. He then had the number repeated and on its\r\nconclusion remarked: “Well done, this time, Fräulein Heckermann!” The\r\ntenor was Michael Greiner, with whom Beethoven was acquainted, from\r\nBaden, and Fräulein Kaiser sang the part of _Pallas_. The rehearsal\r\nand the performance demonstrated plainly, Schindler says, that under\r\nno circumstances was Beethoven able longer to conduct large bodies\r\nof performers. The representation, despite the enthusiasm of the\r\nperformers, stimulated by Beethoven’s encouraging speeches, was\r\nnot a success. Beethoven would take none of the fault to himself,\r\nhowever, though his anxiety led him to hold back the music despite\r\nthe exertions of his two leaders, whom he admonished against too much\r\nprecipitancy, of which Schindler protests they were not guilty. There\r\nwere demonstrations of enthusiasm at the close and Beethoven was led\r\nbefore the curtain by Director Hensler. The work was repeated on\r\nOctober 4, 5 and 6. Beethoven’s friendly feeling for Hensler gave rise\r\nto a new orchestral composition a few weeks later. The members of the\r\ncompany paid a tribute to their director on his name-day, November 3.\r\nAfter a performance of Meisl’s drama “1722, 1822, 1922,” the audience\r\nhaving departed, the director was called to the festively decorated\r\nand illuminated stage, and surrounded by his company in gala dress.\r\nA poetical address was read to him by the stage-manager. After he\r\nhad gone back to his lodgings, the orchestra and chorus serenaded\r\nhim, the programme consisting of an overture to “The Prodigal Son” by\r\nChapelmaster Drechsel, a concerto for flute by Chapelmaster Gläser,\r\nand what Bäuerle’s “Theaterzeitung” called “a glorious new symphony”\r\ncomposed for the occasion by Beethoven, the whole ending with the\r\nmarch and chorus from Mozart’s “Titus.” The “new symphony” was the\r\n“Gratulatory Minuet” of which mention has been made. Nothing is said\r\nin the accounts about Beethoven’s presence at the serenade, and as\r\n“Fidelio” was performed that night at the Kärnthnerthor Theatre, his\r\nabsence might easily be explained. On the next day[67] Hensler gave a\r\ndinner in the property-room of the theatre at 3 p.m. Beethoven, Gläser,\r\nBäuerle, Gleich, Meisl, Hopp and others were present. Beethoven had\r\na seat directly under the musical clock. Gläser told Reubl (Reichl?)\r\nwho provided the entertainment to set the clock to the overture to\r\n“Fidelio” and then wrote to Beethoven to listen, as he would soon hear\r\nit. Beethoven listened and then said: “It plays it better than the\r\norchestra in the Kärnthnerthor.”\r\n\r\nThe “Gratulatory Minuet” was offered to Peters in the letter of\r\nDecember 20. Beethoven was evidently eager to realize quickly on a work\r\nwhich had cost him but little labor--the product of a period in which\r\nhis fancy seemed to have regained its old-time fecundity and he his\r\nold-time delight in work. He offered it elsewhere and gave a copy (the\r\none that he misdated) to Archduke Rudolph for his collection. Artaria\r\npublished it in 1835 under the title “Allegretto (Gratulations-Menuet)”\r\nwith a dedication to Carl Holz. The title on the autograph reads:\r\n“Tempo di Minuetto quasi Allegretto.” “Allegro non troppo” was\r\noriginally written but was scratched out and “Gratulations-Menuet”\r\nwritten in its place.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: UNABLE TO CONDUCT “FIDELIO”]\r\n\r\nBeethoven’s absence from the complimentary function to Hensler in\r\nthe theatre may be explained by the revival of “Fidelio” which took\r\nplace on the same night, November 3, after an absence from the stage\r\nof three years (not eight, as Schindler says), though we do not know\r\nthat he was present. It was a benefit performance for Wilhelmine\r\nSchröder, then 17 years old, afterwards the famous dramatic singer\r\nMadame Schröder-Devrient. Haitzinger sang _Florestan_, Zeltner _Rocco_,\r\nForti _Pizarro_. Rauscher _Jaquino_, Nestroy _the Minister_, Fräulein\r\nDemmer _Marcelline_ and Fräulein Schröder _Leonore_. Schindler tells\r\na pathetic tale concerning the dress rehearsal. Together with his\r\nfriends, mindful of the happenings in the Hall of the University\r\nin 1819 and in the Josephstadt Theatre only a short time before,\r\nSchindler advised Beethoven not to attempt to conduct the performance.\r\nHe hesitated for a few days, then announced his intention to direct\r\nwith the help of Umlauf. Schindler escorted him to the rehearsal. The\r\noverture went well, the orchestra being well trained in it, but at the\r\nfirst duet it became painfully manifest that Beethoven heard nothing\r\nof what was going on on the stage. He slackened his beat and the\r\norchestra obeyed; the singers urged the movement onward. Umlauf stopped\r\nthe performance at the rappings on the jailor’s lodge-gate but gave no\r\nreason to Beethoven. At the same place on the repetition there was the\r\nsame confusion. Let Schindler continue the narrative, the correctness\r\nof which there seems to be no reason to question:\r\n\r\n    The impossibility of going ahead with the author of the work\r\n    was evident. But how, in what manner inform him of the fact?\r\n    Neither Duport, the director, nor Umlauf was willing to speak\r\n    the saddening words: “It will not do; go away, you unhappy man!”\r\n    Beethoven, already uneasy in his seat, turned now to the right\r\n    now to the left, scrutinizing the faces to learn the cause of the\r\n    interruption. Everywhere silence. I had approached near him in\r\n    the orchestra. He banded me his note-book with an indication that\r\n    I write what the trouble was. Hastily I wrote in effect: “Please\r\n    do not go on; more at home.” With a bound he was in the parterre\r\n    and said merely: “Out, quick!” Without stopping he ran towards his\r\n    lodgings, Pfarrgasse, Vorstadt Leimgrube. Inside he threw himself\r\n    on the sofa, covered his face with his hands and remained in this\r\n    attitude till we sat down to eat. During the meal not a word\r\n    came from his lips; he was a picture of profound melancholy and\r\n    depression. When I tried to go away after the meal he begged me not\r\n    to leave him until it was time to go to the theatre. At parting he\r\n    asked me to go with him next day to his physician, Dr. Smetana,\r\n    who had gained some repute as an aurist.\r\n\r\nSome details of the representation may be learned from the account in\r\nthe “Theaterzeitung” of November 9. The day was the name-day of the\r\nEmpress; the square about the Opera-house was illuminated; the national\r\nhymn, “Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser,” was sung; the overture received\r\nsuch applause that it had to be repeated; the great duet and the canon\r\nquartet also, and the soprano and tenor were recalled at the end of the\r\nopera. Was Beethoven present? The question cannot be answered. Alfred\r\nvon Wolzogen in his biography of Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient quotes\r\nfrom Claire von Glümer, who had access to the singer’s notes, in his\r\naccount of the affair. The incident of the rehearsal is told with a\r\nvariation which strengthens Schindler’s narrative. At the performance,\r\nClaire von Glümer says, Beethoven sat behind the chapelmaster in the\r\norchestra so deeply wrapped in his cloak that only his gleaming eyes\r\nwere visible. The youthful prima donna was unspeakably alarmed, but\r\nscarcely had she uttered her first words than she felt her whole body\r\ninfused with marvellous power. Beethoven--the public--everything\r\nvanished from view. She forgot that she had studied the rôle--she was\r\ntransformed into _Leonore_--she lived, she suffered the part, scene\r\nafter scene. Beethoven, the story proceeds, though he had heard not a\r\nword but had observed the soul of her singing in her transfigured face,\r\nhad recognized his _Leonore_ in her.\r\n\r\n    After the performance he went to her; his usually threatening\r\n    eyes smiled upon her, he patted her cheeks, thanked her for her\r\n    _Fidelio_ and promised to compose a new opera for her--a promise\r\n    which, unfortunately was never fulfilled. Wilhelmine never met the\r\n    master again, but of all the evidences of homage paid to the famous\r\n    woman in later years her most precious recollection were the words\r\n    of appreciation which Beethoven spoke to her.\r\n\r\nThe tale is amiable, and plausible enough; standing alone there\r\nwould seem to be no ground for doubting its correctness. But there\r\nare circumstances which give our credence pause. Schindler, who was\r\nBeethoven’s constant companion in those days, who presents the story\r\nof the rehearsal so convincingly, and who waited until it was time\r\nto go to the theatre, says not a word about Beethoven’s presence at\r\nthe representation. Would he, after suffering such a heartbreaking\r\nhumiliation at the rehearsal, have gone to the theatre and taken a\r\nconspicuous place in the orchestra? It does not seem likely. Moreover,\r\nin a letter published in the “Neue Berliner Musikzeitung” of July 30,\r\n1851, Schindler, discussing an impersonation of _Fidelio_ by Frau\r\nKöster-Schlegel in Frankfort, says: “It may be remarked in passing\r\nthat Beethoven never saw Schröder-Devrient as _Fidelio_, but was\r\ndissatisfied with her conception of the character as he had learned\r\nto know it from the public prints and oral communications. His ideal\r\nwas not an operatic heroine, etc.” This would seem to be conclusive,\r\nwere there not evidence that Schindler’s memory had played him false\r\nagain. “Fidelio” was repeated on November 4, and also on November\r\n26 and December 17, 1822, and March 3 and 18, 1823, and Bäuerle’s\r\n“Theaterzeitung” distinctly states that “Beethoven attended the second\r\nperformance, sitting in a box in the first tier.” Moreover, Louis\r\nSchlösser, who was at this performance, adds confirmation by telling\r\nhow he saw Beethoven leaving the theatre in the company of Schindler\r\nand von Breuning. Beethoven may not have been able to form an opinion\r\nof a performance which he could not hear, but the testimony of\r\nSchindler that he never saw Schröder-Devrient in the role of _Fidelio_\r\nis greatly weakened by this proved fact. But would he have made such a\r\nstatement if Beethoven had been present at the first performance and\r\npaid so spectacular a tribute to the singer? It is easier to imagine\r\nthat Schindler’s memory was treacherous concerning a later performance.\r\nAt best, the evidence is inconclusive, because contradictory. In\r\nMarch, 1823, Chapelmaster Reuling remarks in a Conversation Book: “I\r\nsaw you in the theatre at the first performance of ‘Fidelio’.” Did\r\nhe mean the first performance in November, 1822, or the first of the\r\ntwo performances in the month in which he was writing--March, 1823?\r\nSchröder-Devrient in her prime is reputed to have been the greatest of\r\nall _Fidelios_; but she did not reach her full artistic stature until\r\nafter Beethoven’s death.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TREATMENT FOR DEAFNESS RESUMED]\r\n\r\nFollowing Schindler’s narrative we learn that Beethoven’s woeful\r\nexperience at the rehearsal led to a resolution on his part to make\r\nanother effort to be healed of his deafness. He went to Dr. Smetana,\r\nwho prescribed medicaments to be taken inwardly, thereby indicating,\r\nas Schindler asserts, that he had no expectation of effecting a cure,\r\nbut wanted only to occupy Beethoven’s mind, knowing what to expect\r\nfrom so impatient, wilful and absent-minded a patient; for Beethoven\r\nwas as unready to follow a physician’s advice as a musician’s, and was\r\nmore likely to injure himself with overdoses of drugs than to invite\r\nthe benefit which the practitioner hoped for by obedience to the\r\nprescription. The usual thing happened; not only with Dr. Smetana’s\r\ntreatment, but also with that of the priest, Pater Weiss, whom he had\r\nconsulted some 18 years before and to whom he now returned. For a\r\nwhile he thought that the oil which the priest dropped into his ears\r\nwas beneficial, and Pater Weiss himself expressed the belief that\r\nthe left ear, at least, might permanently be helped; but Beethoven\r\ngrew skeptical, as he always did unless he experienced immediate\r\nrelief, his work monopolized his attention, and despite the priest’s\r\nsolicitations he abandoned the treatment and yielded himself to his\r\nfate. Thenceforward no one heard him lament because of his deafness.\r\n\r\nThe compositions which were in Beethoven’s hands at the close of the\r\nyear were those which had occupied him in the earlier months. The Mass,\r\nseveral times completed but never complete so long as it was within\r\nreach, received what must now be looked upon as its finishing touches;\r\nprogress was made on the Ninth Symphony and thought given to a quartet,\r\nperhaps several quartets. The Bagatelles for Pianoforte grouped under\r\nOp. 119, some of which had been published a year before (Nos. 7-11),\r\nwere finished; Nos. 1 to 6 were ready for the publisher by the end of\r\n1822--the autograph manuscript bearing the inscription “Kleinigkeiten,\r\n1822 Novemb.” Nottebohm thinks that Nos. 2 to 5 were conceived between\r\n1800 and 1804; a sketch for No. 5 (C minor, _Risoluto_) is found among\r\nsketches made in 1802 for the Sonata in C minor Op. 30; Lenz says\r\nsketches for No. 3 (in D, _a l’Allemande_) are among sketches for the\r\nlast movement of the “Eroica” Symphony; No. 6 (G major) is sketched on\r\na sheet containing experimental studies for a passage in the _Credo_ of\r\nthe Mass; sketches for Nos. 2 and 4 are among suggestions of a melody\r\nfor Goethe’s “Erlkönig,” indicating an early period which cannot be\r\ndetermined. Of Nos. 7-11, enough has been said in a previous chapter.\r\nThe piece published as No. 12 and added to the set by Diabelli after\r\nBeethoven’s death was originally a song with pianoforte accompaniment\r\nand had its origin in 1800 at the latest. Whether or not Beethoven made\r\nthe pianoforte piece out of the projected song, on which point nothing\r\nof significance can be said, it is certain that it does not belong to\r\nthe set, which consists of 11 numbers only in the old editions and in\r\nthe manuscripts of the Rudolphinian Collection.\r\n\r\nBeethoven offered a number of Bagatelles to Peters--at first four,\r\nthen a larger number; he sent six to the publisher on February 15,\r\n1823. Peters returned them--Beethoven receiving them on March 19--with\r\nthe remark that they were not worth the price asked for them and\r\nthat Beethoven ought to consider it beneath his dignity to waste his\r\ntime on such trifles; anybody could write them. Schindler says that\r\nPeters’s action aggrieved Beethoven, which is easily believed; but\r\nSchindler confounded the Bagatelles Op. 119 with the set, Op. 126,\r\nworks of distinctly a higher order which were not composed at the time.\r\nOn February 25, 1823, Beethoven sent 11 Bagatelles to Ries in London\r\nwith instructions to sell them as best he could. Naturally, Op. 119 is\r\nmeant. On May 7, 1823, six were offered to Lissner in St. Petersburg.\r\nSchlesinger published the set in Paris at the end of 1823, as Op. 112,\r\nand Sauer and Leidesdorf issued them almost simultaneously in Vienna\r\nwith the same opus number. The number 119 appears to have been assigned\r\nto the set after an agreement had been reached with Steiner concerning\r\nthe works now numbered 112 to 118. The last known song by Beethoven,\r\n“Der Kuss,” was finished at this time, though written down practically\r\nas we know it in 1798. Sketches involving the few changes made are\r\nfound among some for the overture “The Consecration of the House”\r\nand the Ninth Symphony. The autograph is dated “December, 1822.” It\r\nwas sent to Peters, who did not print it; in 1825 it was sent to the\r\nSchotts, numbered 128, and they published it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GALITZIN AND AN ORATORIO FOR BOSTON]\r\n\r\nIn the last weeks of the year a connection was established which\r\nwas destined to be of great influence in Beethoven’s final creative\r\nactivities. Prince Nicolas Boris Galitzin, born in 1795, who as a young\r\nman had taken part in the Napoleonic wars, was an influential factor\r\nin the musical life of St. Petersburg. He played the violoncello, and\r\nhis wife (_née_ Princess Saltykow) was an admirable pianist. Prince\r\nGalitzin was an ardent admirer of Beethoven’s music and had arranged\r\nsome of the works written for the pianoforte for strings. Whether\r\nor not he had made the personal acquaintance of Beethoven has not\r\nbeen established, but wanting to have as his private property some\r\ncomposition by the master whom he revered, he addressed a letter to\r\nBeethoven on November 9, 1822, saying that as a passionate amateur of\r\nmusic and an admirer of the master’s talent he asked him to compose for\r\nhim one, two or three string quartets, for which he would be pleased\r\nto pay any sum demanded and that he would accept the dedication of the\r\nworks with gratitude. Beethoven’s answer, dated January 25, 1823, has\r\nnot been found but it is known that he accepted the commission and\r\nfixed the honorarium at 50 ducats each. This is the prologue to the\r\nstory of the last Quartets.\r\n\r\nIn Charles C. Perkins’s “History of the Handel and Haydn Society, of\r\nBoston,” Vol. I, p. 87, the author writes: “The most interesting matter\r\nconnected with the history of the society in the year 1823 ... is the\r\nfact that Beethoven was commissioned to write an oratorio for it.”\r\nThe date is obviously wrong; it should be 1822, for in a letter dated\r\nDecember 20, 1822, as will appear in the next chapter of this work,\r\nBeethoven tells Ries that he has received requests from all parts of\r\nEurope “and even from North America.” The historian of the Boston\r\nSociety adds:\r\n\r\n    That the commission was given is certain, but as it is not\r\n    mentioned in the records, Mr. A. W. Thayer is probably right in\r\n    thinking that it was given unofficially by Richardson and two or\r\n    three other members. In October 1854 Mr. Thayer wrote a letter to\r\n    Mr. J. S. Dwight, the well-known editor of the “Musical Journal,”\r\n    to say that he had questioned Schindler, Beethoven’s biographer,\r\n    on the subject and had learned from him that in 1823 a Boston\r\n    banker, whose name was unknown to him, having occasion to write\r\n    to Geymüller, a Viennese banker, had sent an order to the great\r\n    musician to compose an oratorio for somebody or some society in\r\n    Boston and it was forwarded to its destination.... Wishing to know\r\n    the truth about the matter I wrote to Mr. Thayer, then, as now, U.\r\n    S. Consul at Trieste, for information, and in reply learned that in\r\n    one of Beethoven’s note books he had found this passage: “Bühler\r\n    writes: ‘The oratorio for Boston?’ (Beethoven) ‘I cannot write what\r\n    I should like best to write, but that which the pressing need of\r\n    money obliges me to write. This is not saying that I write only for\r\n    money. When this period is past I hope to write what for me and for\r\n    art is above all--Faust.’”\r\n\r\nThe passages cited are from a Conversation Book used in the early\r\ndays of April, 1823. In the fall of that year, on November 5, the\r\n“Morgenblatt für Gebildete Leser” closed an article on Beethoven with\r\nthe words: “A symphony, quartets, a Biblical oratorio, sent to him in\r\nEnglish by the consul of the United States, observe the United States,\r\nand possibly one of Grillparzer’s poems, may be expected.”\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[42] For this arraignment and defence (if defence it be) of Beethoven\r\nthe present Editor wishes to assume entire responsibility. Thayer’s\r\nnotes fail him here, but the indictment, he is convinced, is not only\r\ndemanded by historical truth but also wholly within the spirit of\r\nThayer as manifested in the earlier volumes of this work. Dr. Deiters\r\nmakes no effort to conceal the facts, though he does not marshal them\r\nso as to present the moral delinquency in the strong light in which\r\nit appears when Beethoven’s words and deeds are brought sharply into\r\njuxtaposition; nevertheless, after presenting a plea in extenuation\r\nfully and fairly, he says: “We pay the tribute of our profoundest\r\nsympathy for Beethoven under these circumstances; we know sufficiently\r\nwell the noble impulses of his soul in all other fields; we are aware\r\nof the reasons which compelled him to try everything which promised\r\nto better his condition; but the conscientious reporter cannot ignore\r\nfacts which lie notoriously before him, and, hard as it may be, can not\r\nacquit Beethoven of the reproach that his conduct was not in harmony\r\nwith the principles of strict justice and uprightness.”\r\n\r\n[43] This has been made possible for the editor by the courtesy of\r\nthe present representatives of the venerable house in Bonn, viz.:\r\nN. Simrock G. m. b. H. in Berlin, who in 1909 issued a handsome\r\nbook containing all the letters which passed between N. Simrock and\r\nBeethoven in a period beginning in 1794 and ending in 1823. Nicolaus\r\nSimrock, the reader may be reminded, was a friend of Beethoven in his\r\nchildhood and a colleague in the orchestra at Bonn.\r\n\r\n[44] Youthful works.\r\n\r\n[45] Probably “Primo amore,” though it has orchestral accompaniment.\r\n\r\n[46] Composed in 1814 in memory of Baroness Pasqualati.\r\n\r\n[47] The Romances for Violin Op. 40 and 50 having been published long\r\nbefore, Beethoven must have had another one in mind.\r\n\r\n[48] The Trio for wind-instruments, Op. 87, already in print. Beethoven\r\nhad composed variations on “Là ci darem” from “Don Giovanni” for\r\nthe same instruments and the composition was called a Terzetto when\r\nperformed in 1797. This was probably in his mind.\r\n\r\n[49] The last three sonatas as we know them being out of the question,\r\nBeethoven must have thought himself in readiness to write another if it\r\nwas desired; there was no lack of material in his sketchbooks.\r\n\r\n[50] Degen was a popular aëronaut who had long before excited the\r\ninterest of Beethoven.\r\n\r\n[51] Evidences of the second mass may be found in Nottebohm’s “Zweit.\r\nBeeth.,” pages 152 and 541-543.\r\n\r\n[52] Beethoven indulges in his propensity for puns: “Wäre mein Gehalt\r\nnicht ganz ohne Gehalt.”\r\n\r\n[53] A composition written for a serenade given to Hensler, Director of\r\nthe Josephstädter Theatre, as will appear later.\r\n\r\n[54] Nottebohm says that the three songs were “Opferlied,” “Bundeslied”\r\nand “Der Kuss.” Peters published none of them. The first appeared as\r\nOp. 121, the second as Op. 122, the third as Op. 128, published by\r\nSchott and Sons in 1825. This was the firm which eventually got the\r\nMass in D.\r\n\r\n[55] In a note to Thayer.\r\n\r\n[56] No. 34 in Portfolio I of the Schindler papers in Berlin is a note\r\nas follows: “Mr. v. Schindler of course must not be mentioned in the\r\npresence (or by) the two persons, but I, certainly.” To this Schindler\r\nattached the following explanation: “The above lines were addressed to\r\nPolice Commissioner Ungermann as an appendix to a detailed report to\r\nhim. The commissioner was requested by official or other means to help\r\nhim induce his brother to watch over the moral conduct of his wife, or\r\nto have it overseen by others, since her excesses had reached a pass\r\nwhich already subjected her and her husband to public censure. But the\r\nefforts of Beethoven and the public official were fruitless because his\r\nbrother could not be persuaded to take energetic action. The excesses\r\nof the licentious woman grew greater from year to year until they led,\r\nin 1823, to open scandal in the barracks where Madame van Beethoven had\r\nvisited her lovers (officers), with whom she was seen on the public\r\npromenades. Then our Beethoven took energetic steps with his brother,\r\ntrying to persuade him to divorce his vicious wife, but made shipwreck\r\non the indolence of this man, who was himself morally depraved.”\r\n\r\n[57] Here, as in a former case, the editor of this English edition is\r\nseeking to reproduce the spirit of Thayer, who was so eager to undo\r\nsome of the injustice which had been visited upon Beethoven’s brothers\r\nKarl and Johann that he undertook their defense in a brochure entitled\r\n“Ein kritischer Beitrag zur Beethovenliteratur,” published in Berlin in\r\n1877. He also spoke with emphasis on the subject in a review of Nohl’s\r\nbiography of Beethoven which he contributed to the “New York Tribune”\r\nin the spring of 1881.\r\n\r\n[58] “King Stephen” and “The Ruins of Athens.”\r\n\r\n[59] 300 florins.\r\n\r\n[60] Which he had adapted to “Die Weihe des Hauses.”\r\n\r\n[61] “Wo sich die Pulse,” which Beethoven inscribed as having been\r\nwritten “Towards the end of September.”\r\n\r\n[62] Nohl, II, 50.\r\n\r\n[63] Archduke Rudolph wrote variations on one of the melodies from the\r\nopera, which Beethoven corrected.\r\n\r\n[64] In an article in the “Neue Freie Presse” of July 21, 1867,\r\nreprinted in “Aus dem Concertsaal,” page 594.\r\n\r\n[65] “Aus dem Tonleben, etc.,” II, 49.\r\n\r\n[66] Published as Op. 114, and designated as “new” by Beethoven, though\r\nnot a measure had been added, but only a few lines of text, and the\r\nchoral music simplified. Steiner published pianoforte arrangements for\r\ntwo and four hands in 1822, and the score in 1824.\r\n\r\n[67] This anecdote was told to Thayer on October 28, 1859 by an old\r\nactor named Hopp who was present on the occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\n    The Solemn Mass in D--A Royal Subscription--More Negotiations with\r\n    England--Opera Projects--Grillparzer’s “Melusine”--The Diabelli\r\n    Variations--Summer Visitors--An Englishman’s Account--Weber and\r\n    Julius Benedict--Ries and the Ninth Symphony--Franz Liszt and\r\n    Beethoven’s Kiss--The Year 1823.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the year 1823 opens, the Mass in D is supposedly finished and\r\nnegotiations for its publication have been carried on in a manner the\r\ncontemplation of which must affect even the casual reader grievously.\r\nThe work had been originally intended for the functions attending the\r\ninstallation of Archduke Rudolph as Archbishop of Olmütz--not merely\r\nas a personal tribute to the imperial, archepiscopal pupil, but for\r\nactual performance at the ceremony of inthronization--a fact which\r\nought to be borne in mind during its study, for it throws light upon\r\nBeethoven’s attitude towards the Catholic Church (at least so far as\r\nthat church’s rubrics are concerned) as well as towards religion in\r\ngeneral and art as its handmaiden and mistress. Archduke Rudolph had\r\nbeen chosen Cardinal on April 24, 1819, and Archbishop on June 4 of\r\nthe same year; he was installed as head of the see of Olmütz on March\r\n20, 1820; but the fact of his selection for the dignities was known in\r\nVienna amongst his friends as early as the middle of 1818. When the\r\nstory of the year 1823 opens, therefore, Beethoven’s plan is nearly\r\nfive years old and Archduke Rudolph has been archbishop nearly a year.\r\nWe first hear of the Mass this year in a letter dated February 27, when\r\nBeethoven apologizes to his august pupil for not having waited upon\r\nhim. He had delayed his visit, he said, because he wanted to send him a\r\ncopy of the Mass; but this had been held back by corrections and other\r\ncircumstances. Accompanying the letter were the copies of the overture\r\nto “The Consecration of the House” and the “Gratulatory Minuet.”\r\nFinally, on March 19, 1823, on the very eve of the first anniversary of\r\nthe installation, Beethoven placed a manuscript copy of the Mass in\r\nthe Archduke’s hands. In the catalogue of the Rudolphinian Collection,\r\nnow preserved by the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna, it is\r\nentered thus: “_Missa Solemnis_. Partitur. MS. This beautifully written\r\nMS. was delivered by the composer himself on March 19, 1823.”\r\n\r\nThe plan to write the Mass for the installation ceremonies seems to\r\nhave been original with Beethoven; it was not suggested by the Archduke\r\nor any of his friends, so far as has ever been learned. He began work\r\nupon it at once, for Schindler says he saw the beginning of the score\r\nin the fall of 1818. Nottebohm’s study of all the sketches which\r\nhave been discovered (save a number now preserved in the Beethoven\r\nHouse in Bonn which do not add materially to our knowledge) led him\r\nto conclusions which may be summed up as follows: The movements were\r\ntaken up in the order in which the various portions of the text appear\r\nin the Roman missal, but work was prosecuted on several movements\r\nsimultaneously. The _Kyrie_ was begun at the earliest in the middle\r\nof 1818, i. e., shortly after the fact of the Archduke’s appointment\r\nbecame known; the _Gloria_ was completely sketched by the end of 1819,\r\nthe _Credo_ in 1820; the entire Mass was complete in sketch-form in\r\nthe beginning of 1822. While sketching the Mass Beethoven composed the\r\nPianoforte Sonatas, Op. 109, 110 and 111, the Variations, Op. 107, No.\r\n8, and several other small pieces, including the canons “O, Tobias,”\r\n“Gehabt euch wohl,” “Tugend ist kein leerer Name,” and “Gedenkt heute\r\nan Baden.” But with the elaboration of the sketches the Mass was not\r\nreally finished, for subsequently Beethoven undertook many changes.\r\nThe _Allegro molto_ which enters in the _Credo_ at the words _et\r\nascendit_ is shorter in the autograph than in the printed edition. At\r\nthe entrance of the words _et iterum_ and _cujus regni_ the autograph\r\nis in each case two measures shorter than in the printed score. In the\r\nautograph, and also in the copy which Beethoven gave to the Archduke,\r\nthe trombones do not enter till the words _judicare vivos et mortuos_.\r\nThere are no trombones in the _Gloria_. The trombone passage which\r\nnow appears just before the entrance of the chorus on _judicare_ was\r\nformerly set for the horns. After the words _et mortuos_ the trombones\r\nare silent till the end of the _Credo_ in the autograph; they enter\r\nagain in the beginning of the _Sanctus_, but are silent at the next\r\n_Allegro_. They occur in the _Benedictus_, but are wanting in the\r\n_Agnus Dei_. From the nature of these supplementary alterations it is\r\nto be concluded that considerable time must have elapsed before they\r\ncould all be made and the Mass be given the shape in which we know it.\r\nHolding to the date on which the copy was delivered to the Archduke\r\n(March 19, 1823), the earliest date at which the Mass can have received\r\nits definitive shape must be set down as the middle of 1823. Beethoven,\r\ntherefore, devoted about five years to its composition. He made so many\r\nchanges in the tympani part of the _Agnus Dei_ that he wore a hole in\r\nthe very thick paper, his aim being, apparently, by means of a vague\r\nrhythm to suggest the distance of the disturbers of the peace. That\r\nhe was sincere in his purpose to provide a mass for the installation\r\nceremonies is to be found, outside of Schindler’s statement, in a\r\nletter to the Archduke written in 1819, in which he says:\r\n\r\n    The day on which a high mass of my composition is performed at the\r\n    ceremony for Y. I. H. will be to me the most beautiful in my life\r\n    and God will enlighten me so that my poor powers may contribute to\r\n    the glory of this solemn day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEETHOVEN AND RELIGION]\r\n\r\nSomething was said, in the conclusion of the chapter of this biography\r\ndevoted to a review of the incidents of the years 1807 to 1809,\r\nconcerning the views Beethoven entertained on the subject of religion\r\nand dogmatic and sectarian Christianity. His attitude towards the Roman\r\nCatholic Church becomes an almost necessary subject of contemplation in\r\na study of the Solemn Mass in D; but it is one into which the personal\r\nequation of the student must perforce largely enter. The obedient\r\nchurchman of a Roman Catholic country will attach both less and more\r\nimportance, than one brought up in a Protestant land, to the fact that\r\nhe admonished his nephew when a lad to say his prayers and said them\r\nwith him (as the boy testified in the guardianship proceedings), that\r\nhe himself at least once led him to the door of the confessional,[68]\r\nthat he consented to the summoning of a priest when _in extremis_\r\nand that he seemed to derive comfort and edification from the sacred\r\nfunction. It is not necessary, however, to go very deeply into a\r\ncritical study of the Mass in order to say that while the composition\r\nshows respect for traditions in some portions and while it is possible\r\nto become eloquent without going beyond the demonstration contained\r\nin the music itself, in describing the overwhelming puissance of\r\nhis proclamation of the fatherhood of God and belief in Him as the\r\nCreator of all things visible and invisible, the most obvious fact\r\nwhich confronts the analytical student is that Beethoven approached\r\nthe missal text chiefly with the imagination and the emotions of an\r\nartist, and that its poetical, not to say dramatic elements were those\r\nwhich he was most eager to delineate.[69] One proof of this is found in\r\nwhat may be called the technical history of the Mass, and is therefore\r\npertinent here. It was scarcely necessary for Beethoven to do so, but\r\nhe has nevertheless given us an explanation of his singular treatment\r\nof the prayer for peace. Among the sketches for the movement is found\r\nthe remark: “_dona nobis pacem_ darstellend den _innern_ und äussern\r\nFrieden” (“delineating internal and external peace”), and in agreement\r\nwith this he superscribes the first _Allegro vivace_ in the autograph\r\nwith the same words. In the later copy this phrase is changed to\r\n“Prayer for internal and external peace,” thus showing an appreciation\r\nof the fact that the words alone contain the allusion to peace which in\r\nits external aspect is disturbed by the sounds of war suggested by the\r\ninstruments. The petition for peace is emphasized by the threatening\r\ntones of military instruments accompanying the agonizing appeal for\r\nmercy sent up by the voices. The device is purely dramatic and it was\r\nnot an entirely novel conceit of Beethoven’s. When the French invaded\r\nStyria in 1796, Haydn wrote a mass “In tempore belli” in which a soft\r\ndrum-roll entered immediately after the words “Agnus Dei” and was\r\ngradually reinforced by trumpets and other wind-instruments “as if the\r\nenemy were heard approaching in the distance.”\r\n\r\nWhence came the plan of postponing the publication of the mass for\r\na period in order to sell manuscript copies of it by subscription\r\nto the sovereigns of Europe does not appear. Beethoven had it under\r\nconsideration at the beginning of 1823, for the year was only a week\r\nold when he sent his brother Johann with a letter to Griesinger of the\r\nSaxon Legation asking him to give advice on the subject to the bearer\r\nof the letter, apologizing for not coming in person on the ground\r\nof indisposition. Whether or not Griesinger came to his assistance\r\nwe do not know, but within a fortnight work on the project had been\r\nenergetically begun. Schindler was now called upon to write, fetch\r\nand carry as steadily and industriously as if he were, in fact, what\r\nhe described himself to be--a private secretary. Among his papers in\r\nBerlin are found many billets and loose memoranda bearing on the\r\nsubject, without date, but grouped as to periods by Schindler himself\r\nand provided with occasional glosses touching their contents. Beethoven\r\ntook so much of his time in requisition, indeed, that he offered to\r\npay him 50 florins after the collection of one of the subscription\r\nfees, but Schindler records that he never received them nor would he\r\nhave accepted them. He was, as he informed the world for many years\r\nafterward on his visiting card, “L’Ami de Beethoven,” and his very\r\nconsiderable and entirely unselfish labors were “works of friendship”\r\nfor which he wanted no remuneration; but he was very naturally rejoiced\r\nwhen Beethoven presented him with several autograph scores, and we\r\nhave seen how, after the death of Beethoven, Breuning gave him many\r\npapers which seemed valueless then but are looked upon as invaluable\r\nnow. Moreover, he disposed of his Beethoven _memorabilia_ to the\r\nRoyal Library of Berlin for an annuity of 400 thalers--all of which,\r\nhowever, does not detract from the disinterestedness of his labors for\r\nBeethoven, alive, suffering and so frequently helpless.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ROYAL SUBSCRIPTIONS INVITED]\r\n\r\nThe invitations to the courts were issued in part before the end of\r\nJanuary. A letter to Schindler, evidently written in that month, asks\r\nhim to draw out a memorandum of courts from an almanac in which the\r\nforeign embassies stationed at Vienna were listed. The invitations were\r\nposted on the following dates: to the courts at Baden, Wurtemburg,\r\nBavaria and Saxony on January 23; “to the other ambassadors” (as\r\nBeethoven notes) on January 26; to Weimar on February 4; to Mecklenburg\r\nand Hesse-Darmstadt on February 5; to Berlin, Copenhagen, Hesse-Cassel\r\nand Nassau on February 6; to Tuscany on February 17, and to Paris on\r\nMarch 1. The invitation to the court at Hesse-Cassel had been written\r\non January 23, but it was not sent because, as Schindler says, “it had\r\nbeen found that nothing was to be got from the little courts.” The\r\nletter came back to Beethoven and its preservation puts in our hands\r\nthe formula which, no doubt was followed in all the formal addresses.\r\nWe therefore give it here:\r\n\r\n    The undersigned cherishes the wish to send his latest work, which\r\n    he regards as the most successful of his intellectual products, to\r\n    the Most Exalted Court of Cassel.\r\n\r\n    It is a grand solemn mass for 4 solo voices with choruses and\r\n    complete grand orchestra in score, which can also be used as a\r\n    grand oratorio.\r\n\r\n    He therefore begs the High Embassy of His Royal Highness, the\r\n    Elector of Hesse-Cassel, to be pleased to procure for him the\r\n    necessary permission of your Exalted Court.\r\n\r\n    Inasmuch, however, as the copying of the score will entail a\r\n    considerable expense the author does not think it excessive if he\r\n    fixes an honorarium at 50 ducats in gold. The work in question,\r\n    moreover, will not be published for the present.\r\n\r\n  Vienna, 23 January, 1823.\r\n\r\n  Ludwig van Beethoven.\r\n\r\nOnly the signature was in Beethoven’s handwriting. It is not known\r\nhow many of these invitations were issued; Schindler’s account goes\r\nonly to the subscriptions received and even here it is not entirely\r\naccurate. There were ten acceptances. The first came from the King of\r\nPrussia. Prince Hatzfeld acted in the matter for Berlin and Beethoven\r\nalso invoked the aid of Zelter. Court Councillor Wernhard, Director\r\nof the Chancellary of the Embassy at Vienna, brought the report to\r\nBeethoven and asked him if he would not prefer a royal order to the 50\r\nducats. Without hesitation, Beethoven replied “50 ducats,” and after\r\nWernhard had gone he indulged in sarcastic comments on the pursuit\r\nof decorations by various contemporaries--“which in his opinion were\r\ngained at the cost of the sanctity of art.” Beethoven received the\r\nmoney, but the score was not delivered, owing, no doubt, to delay in\r\nthe copying, and in July Prince Hatzfeld feels compelled to remind the\r\ncomposer of his remissness. Prince Radziwill in Berlin also subscribed,\r\nbut he did not receive his copy till more than a year later. On June\r\n28, 1824, a representative of the Prince politely informed Beethoven\r\nthat he had sent a cheque for 50 ducats to him with a request for a\r\nreceipt and a copy of the score, but had received neither. On July\r\n3, Schindler informed Beethoven that Hatzfeld had earnestly inquired\r\nwhether he was now going to receive the Mass. He was being so pestered\r\nabout the matter from Berlin that it was becoming burdensome. He\r\nasked that Beethoven write to the Prince without delay, telling him\r\nwhen he should receive the Mass, so that he might show it in his\r\nown justification in Berlin. Schindler says the fault lay with the\r\ncopyists; in every copy many pages had to be rewritten.\r\n\r\nMuch to Beethoven’s vexation and impatience the Saxon court was\r\nvery tardy in its reply, or rather in subscribing, for at first the\r\ninvitation was declined; but Beethoven was not thus to be put off by a\r\ncourt with which his imperial pupil was closely connected. He called\r\nin the help of Archduke Rudolph, to whom on July 1, 1823, he wrote a\r\nletter. He complains in this letter of pain in the eyes from which he\r\nhas been suffering for a week. He was forced to make sparing use of\r\nthem and therefore had not been able to look through some variations\r\ncomposed by the Archduke, but had been obliged to leave the task to\r\nanother. He continues:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AN ARCHDUKE ASKED TO BE SOLICITOR]\r\n\r\n    In regard to the Mass which Y. I. H. wished to see made more\r\n    generally useful: the continuously poor state of my health for\r\n    several years, more especially the heavy debts which I have\r\n    incurred and the fact that I had to forgo the visit to England\r\n    which I was invited to make, compelled me to think of means for\r\n    bettering my condition. For this the Mass seemed suitable. I was\r\n    advised to offer it to several courts. Hard as it was for me to\r\n    do this I nevertheless did not think that I ought to subject\r\n    myself to reproach by not doing it. I therefore invited several\r\n    courts to subscribe for the Mass, fixed the fee at 50 ducats, as\r\n    it was thought that would not be too much and, if a number of\r\n    subscribers were found, also not unprofitable. Thus far, indeed,\r\n    the subscription does me honor, their Royal Majesties of France and\r\n    Prussia having accepted. I also a few days ago received a letter\r\n    from my friend Prince Gallitzin [_sic_] in St. Petersburg, in which\r\n    this truly amiable prince informs me that His Imperial Majesty\r\n    of Russia had accepted and I should soon hear the details from\r\n    the Imperial Russian embassy here. In spite of all this, however,\r\n    though others have also become subscribers I do not get as much as\r\n    I would as fee from a publisher, only I have the advantage that\r\n    the work remains _mine_. The costs of copying are large and will\r\n    be increased by the new pieces[70] which are to be added, which I\r\n    shall send to Y. I. H. as soon as I have finished them. Perhaps Y.\r\n    I. H. will not find it burdensome graciously to ask H. R. H. the\r\n    Grand Duke of Tuscany to take a copy of the Mass. The invitation\r\n    was sent some time ago to the Grand Duke of Tuscany through the\r\n    agent v. Odelgha, and O. solemnly assures me that the invitation\r\n    will surely be accepted, but I am not entirely confident, since\r\n    it was several months ago and no answer has been received. The\r\n    matter having been undertaken, it is only natural that as much as\r\n    possible should have been done to attain the desired result. It\r\n    was hard for me to understand this, still harder for me to tell Y.\r\n    I. H. of it or permit you to notice it, but “_Necessity knows no\r\n    law_.” But I thank Him above the stars[71] that I am beginning to\r\n    use my eyes again. I am now writing a new symphony for England,\r\n    for the Philharmonic Society, and hope to have it completely done\r\n    in a fortnight. I can not yet strain my eyes for a long period,\r\n    wherefore I beg Y. I. H. graciously to be patient in regard to Y.\r\n    I. H.’s variations which seem to me charming but need carefully to\r\n    be looked through by me. Continue Y. I. H. to practice the custom\r\n    of briefly jotting down your ideas at the pianoforte; for this a\r\n    little table alongside the pianoforte will be necessary. By this\r\n    means the fancy will not only be strengthened but one learns to\r\n    fix at once the most remote ideas. It is also necessary to write\r\n    without the pianoforte, and sometimes to develop a simple chorale\r\n    melody now with simple, and anon with varied figurations in\r\n    counterpoint and this will cause no headache to Y. I. H. but rather\r\n    a great pleasure at finding yourself absorbed in the art. Gradually\r\n    there comes the capacity to represent just that only which we wish\r\n    to feel, an essential need in the case of men of noble mould. My\r\n    eyes command me to stop, etc.\r\n\r\nThis letter was written in Vienna, but from Hetzendorf he sent a\r\npostscript in which he said:\r\n\r\n    If convenient, will Y. I. H. graciously recommend the Mass to\r\n    Prince Anton in Dresden, so that His Royal Majesty of Saxony may\r\n    be induced to subscribe to the Mass, which will surely happen if\r\n    Y. I. H. shows the slightest interest in the matter. As soon as\r\n    I have been informed that you have shown me this favor, I shall\r\n    at once address myself to the Director General of the Theatre and\r\n    Music there, who is in charge of such matters, and send him the\r\n    invitation to subscribe for the King of Saxony which, however, I\r\n    do not wish to do. My opera “Fidelio” was performed with great\r\n    success in Dresden at the festivities in honor of the visit of the\r\n    King of Bavaria, all their Majesties being present. I heard of\r\n    this from the above-mentioned Director General, who asked me for\r\n    the score through Weber and afterwards made me a handsome present\r\n    in return. Y. I. H. will pardon me for inconveniencing you by such\r\n    requests but Y. I. H. knows how little importunate I am as a rule;\r\n    but if there should be the least thing unpleasant to you in the\r\n    affair you will understand as a matter of course that I am none\r\n    the less convinced of your magnanimity and graciousness. It is not\r\n    greed, not the desire for speculation, which I have always avoided,\r\n    but need which compels me to do everything possible to extricate\r\n    myself from this position. In order not to be too harshly judged,\r\n    it is perhaps best to be frank. Because of my continual illness,\r\n    which prevented me from writing as much as usual, I am burdened\r\n    with a debt of 2300 florins C. M. which can be liquidated only by\r\n    extraordinary exertions. If these subscriptions help matters, for\r\n    which there are the best of hopes, I shall be able to get a firm\r\n    foothold again through my compositions. Meanwhile, may Y. I. H. be\r\n    pleased to receive my frankness not ungraciously. If ever I should\r\n    be charged with not being as active as formerly, I should keep\r\n    silent as I always have done. As regards the recommendations I am\r\n    nevertheless convinced that Y. I. H. will always be glad to do good\r\n    _whenever possible_ and will make no exception in my case.\r\n\r\nBeethoven’s impatience with the Saxon Court was so great that some\r\ntime before his hopes had been reanimated, probably by the application\r\nfor his opera, he had said in a note to Schindler: “Nothing from\r\nDresden. Wait till the end of the month then an advocate in Dresden.”\r\nThese words led Schindler to the singular conclusion that Beethoven\r\nhad thoughts of compelling the King of Saxony to reach a decision by\r\njudicial means. Obviously, all that Beethoven meant by “advocate” was a\r\npleader, an intercessor. He could have contemplated legal measures only\r\nif he had sent a copy of the Mass to the King with the invitation, and\r\nthis we know he did not do from a letter written by Archduke Rudolph,\r\nwhich says, that the King of Saxony had not received a score by July\r\n31. Archduke Rudolph became the advocate through his brother-in-law\r\nPrince Anton, brother to the King, and so did the Director General v.\r\nKönneritz, to whom Beethoven wrote on July 17 and again on July 25. In\r\nthe first letter he promises to send the invitation to the King and\r\nin the next he does so. This must have been a second invitation, for\r\nBeethoven tells v. Könneritz that the original one had been declined. A\r\nparagraph from each letter deserves reproduction.\r\n\r\n    I know that you will scarcely think of me as among those who\r\n    write simply for vulgar gain, but when do not circumstances\r\n    sometimes compel a man to act contrary to his habits of thought and\r\n    principles!! My Cardinal is a good-hearted prince, but he lacks\r\n    means.\r\n\r\n    Up to now, in spite of all external glory, I have scarcely received\r\n    for the work what I would have been paid by a publisher, the costs\r\n    of copying having been so great. My friends conceived the idea of\r\n    thus circulating the Mass, for I, thank God, am a _layman_ in all\r\n    speculations. Besides, there is no citizen of our country who has\r\n    not suffered loss, and so have I. Were it not for my sickness of\r\n    years’ standing, I should have received enough from foreign lands\r\n    to live a care-free life, caring only for art. Judge me kindly and\r\n    not unfavorably, I live for my art alone and to fulfil my duties as\r\n    a man, but alas! that this can not always be done without the help\r\n    of the _subterrestrial powers_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SUBSCRIPTIONS BY REGAL COURTS]\r\n\r\nThese last efforts were successful; King Friedrich August subscribed\r\nfor the Mass, and on July 31 Archduke Rudolph wrote to his\r\nmusic-master: “My brother-in-law Prince Anton has already written to me\r\nthat the King of Saxony is expecting your beautiful Mass.” On September\r\n12, Prince Anton wrote to Beethoven that he had no doubt his royal\r\nbrother would grant his wish, especially as he had spoken to him on the\r\nsubject in the name of his brother-in-law, the Cardinal. The money must\r\nhave arrived soon afterward and Beethoven set Schindler’s mind at ease\r\nby writing to him:\r\n\r\n    In order that evil report may not longer injure the poor Dresdeners\r\n    too much, I inform you that the money reached me to-day, with all\r\n    marks of respect.\r\n\r\nAccording to Fürstenau the manuscript copy of the Mass is still in the\r\nprivate music collection of the King of Saxony in Dresden.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duke of Hesse-Darmstadt was appealed to directly under date\r\nof February 5, the letter, probably following the formula and signed\r\nby Beethoven, being forwarded through the Hessian ambassador, Baron\r\nvon Türckheim, a cultured art connoisseur and subsequently Intendant\r\nof the Grand Ducal Theatre in Darmstadt. Louis Schlösser was in Vienna\r\nat the time, and Baron von Türckheim, knowing that he wanted to make\r\nBeethoven’s acquaintance, gave him the opportunity by asking him\r\nto carry the information that the invitation had been accepted, to\r\nBeethoven, handing him the dispatch with the Grand Ducal seal affixed\r\nfor that purpose. Schlösser went to Beethoven, “No. 60 Kothgasse, first\r\nstorey, door to the left,” and has left us a description of the visit,\r\nwhich must have been made in April or early in May, 1823. Beethoven\r\nread the document with great joy and said to Schlösser:\r\n\r\n    Such words as I have read do good. Your Grand Duke speaks not only\r\n    like a princely Mæcenas but like a thorough musical connoisseur of\r\n    comprehensive knowledge. It is not alone the acceptance of my work\r\n    which rejoices me but the estimation which in general he places\r\n    upon my works.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A VAIN APPEAL TO GOETHE]\r\n\r\nNo success was met with at the cultivated Court of Weimar, though here\r\nBeethoven invoked the assistance of no less a dignitary than Goethe.\r\nHis letter to the poet is still preserved in the Grand Ducal archives\r\nand is worthy of being given in full:\r\n\r\n  Vienna, February 8th, 1823.\r\n\r\n    Your Excellency!\r\n\r\n    Still living as I have lived from my youthful years in your\r\n    immortal, never-aging works, and never forgetting the happy\r\n    hours spent in your company, it nevertheless happens that I must\r\n    recall myself to your recollection--I hope that you received the\r\n    dedication to Your Excellency of “Meeresstille und glückliche\r\n    Fahrt” composed by me. Because of their contrast they seemed to me\r\n    adapted for music in which the same quality appears; how gladly\r\n    would I know whether I have fittingly united my harmonies with\r\n    yours; advice too, which would be accepted as very truth, would be\r\n    extremely welcome to me, for I love the latter above all things\r\n    and it shall never be said of me _veritas odium parit_. It is very\r\n    possible that a number of your poems which must ever remain unique,\r\n    set to music by me, will soon be published, among them “Rastlose\r\n    Liebe.” How highly would I value some general observations from\r\n    you on the composition or setting to music of your poems! Now a\r\n    request to Y. E. I have composed a Grand Mass which, however, I\r\n    do not want to publish at present, but which is to be sent to the\r\n    principal courts. The honorarium for the same is 50 ducats only. I\r\n    have addressed myself in the matter to the Grand Ducal Weimarian\r\n    Embassy, which has accepted the appeal to His Serene Highness and\r\n    promised to deliver it. The Mass can also be used as an oratorio\r\n    and who does not know that the benevolent societies are suffering\r\n    from the lack of such things. My request consists in this, that\r\n    Y. E. call the attention of His Serene Highness, the Grand Duke,\r\n    to this matter so that His Highness may subscribe for the Mass.\r\n    The Grand Ducal Weimarian Embassy gave me to understand that it\r\n    would be very beneficial if the Grand Duke could be induced to\r\n    regard the matter favorably in advance. I have written much but\r\n    accumulated scarcely anything, and now I am no longer alone but\r\n    have for more than six years been father to a son of my deceased\r\n    brother, a promising youth in his sixteenth year, wholly devoted to\r\n    science and already at home in the rich shafts of Hellenism; but in\r\n    these countries such things cost a great deal and, in the case of\r\n    young students, not only the present but also the future must be\r\n    borne in mind, and as much as I formerly kept my thoughts directed\r\n    aloft I must now extend my glances _downwards_. My income is all\r\n    outgo--the condition of my health for years has not permitted\r\n    that I make artistic journeys nor seize upon the many things which\r\n    yield money!?--If my health should be completely restored I might\r\n    expect other and better things. Y. E. must not think that it is\r\n    because I am asking a favor that I have dedicated the “Meeresstille\r\n    und glückliche Fahrt” to you--this was already done in May, 1822,\r\n    and this method of making the Mass known was not thought of till a\r\n    few weeks ago. The respect, love and esteem which I have cherished\r\n    for the only and immortal Goethe since the days of my youth have\r\n    remained with me. Things like this are not easily put into words,\r\n    especially by a bungler like myself, who has always been bent only\r\n    on making tones his own, but a singular feeling impels me always to\r\n    tell you this, inasmuch as I live in your works. I know that you\r\n    will not refuse to help an artist who feels only too keenly how far\r\n    mere _monetary reward_ is from _her_ (art) now that he is compelled\r\n    by _need_ and constrained to work and labor _because of others for\r\n    others_. The good is always plain to us and therefore I know that\r\n    Y. E. will not deny my request.\r\n\r\n    A few words from you would fill me with happiness.\r\n\r\n    I remain, Your Excellency, with the sincerest and most unbounded\r\n    respect,\r\n\r\n  Beethoven.\r\n\r\nAccording to Schindler, who surely was in a position to know, no answer\r\nto this letter was ever received; nor did the Grand Duke subscribe.\r\nThat the invitation reached its destination may safely be assumed from\r\nBeethoven’s remark about the interest displayed in the plan at the\r\nembassy; but the document is not to be found in the archives. Goethe’s\r\nindifference, if he was indifferent in the premises, may be explained\r\non a number of grounds. If he ever was thoroughly appreciative of\r\nBeethoven’s music, it was only later in life. He was in the prime\r\nof life with fixed tastes in music as well as the other arts before\r\nBeethoven came with his new evangel. Reichardt, Zelter and men of their\r\nstamp produced the music which was most to his liking. It is true that\r\nin July, 1812, he wrote a letter in which he said that he had never\r\nseen a more self-contained, energetic and sincere artist than Beethoven\r\nand that he could well understand why he appeared singular in the eyes\r\nof the world; but it is doubtful if he ever felt any real attachment\r\nto the man, and not altogether impossible, if the Teplitz stories are\r\ntrue, that he resented the bad manners of which Beethoven is said to\r\nhave been guilty. But a long time had elapsed since the two great men\r\ncame together in 1812.\r\n\r\nBavaria’s story is a short one. In a Conversation Book towards the\r\nclose of May, Schindler writes: “A negative answer has come from\r\nBavaria.” To the King of Naples, Beethoven sent a French copy of the\r\nletter of invitation practically identical with the formula, and also\r\nto the King of France.[72] In the latter case Cherubini was asked to be\r\nthe advocate. The draft of Beethoven’s letter to him is still preserved\r\namong the Schindler papers in Berlin:\r\n\r\n    Highly respected Sir!\r\n\r\n    It is with great pleasure that I embrace the opportunity to\r\n    approach you in writing; in spirit I am with you often enough,\r\n    inasmuch as I value your works more than all others written for\r\n    the stage, though the beautiful world of art must deplore the fact\r\n    that for a considerable period no new theatrical work of yours\r\n    of large dimensions has appeared, at least not in our Germany;\r\n    high as your other works are esteemed by true connoisseurs, it is\r\n    yet a veritable loss to art not to possess a new product of your\r\n    great mind. True art remains imperishable and the genuine artist\r\n    feels sincere pleasure in real and great products of genius, and\r\n    so I, too, am enraptured whenever I hear a new work of yours and\r\n    feel as great an interest in it as in my own works.--In brief, I\r\n    honor and love you--If it were not for my continual ill health and\r\n    I could see you in Paris, with what extraordinary delight would\r\n    I discuss art matters with you?! I must add that to every artist\r\n    and art-lover I always speak of you with _Enthusiasm_, otherwise\r\n    you might (_illegible word_) believe, since I am about to ask a\r\n    favor of you, that this was merely an introduction to the subject.\r\n    I hope, however, that you will not attribute such lowmindedness,\r\n    so contemptible an action, to me. My request consists in this,\r\n    etc.[73] That in this, etc. I know that if you will advise His\r\n    Majesty to take the Mass, he will surely do so. My situation _ma\r\n    critique demande que je ne fixe seulement come ordinaire mes\r\n    pensées aux ciel aux contraire, il faut les fixer en bas pour les\r\n    necessites de la vie_. Whatever may be the fate of my request to\r\n    you, I shall always love and honor you _et vous resteres toujours\r\n    celui de mes contemporains, que je l’estime le plus si vous me\r\n    voulez faire une_ [sic] _estréme plaisir, c’etoit si m’ecrireess\r\n    quelque lignes, ce que me soulagera bien--l’art unie touta_ [sic]\r\n    _le monde_ and how much more true artists, _et peut etres vous me\r\n    dignes aussi, de me mettre_ also to be counted amongst this number,\r\n\r\n  _avec la plus haute\r\n  estime\r\n  votre ami\r\n  e serviteur\r\n  Beeth._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A MEDAL FROM THE KING OF FRANCE]\r\n\r\nThe letter was despatched on March 15. Cherubini did not receive it,\r\nand as late as 1841 expressed his great regret at the miscarriage\r\nwhich, however, worked no harm to the enterprise. King Louis XVIII\r\nnot only subscribed for the Mass but within less than a year sent\r\nBeethoven a gold medal weighing twenty-one Louis d’ors, showing on\r\nthe obverse side the bust of the King and on the reverse, within a\r\nwreath, the inscription: _Donnée par le Roi à Monsieur Beethoven_. Duke\r\nd’Achâts, First Chamberlain of the King, accompanied the gift with the\r\nfollowing letter:\r\n\r\n    _Je m’empresse de vous prévenir, Monsieur, que le Roi a accueillé\r\n    avec bonté l’hommage de la Partition de Votre Messe en Musique et\r\n    m’a chargé de vous faire parvenir une medaille d’or à son effigie.\r\n    Je me félicite d’avoir à vous transmettre le témoinage de la\r\n    satisfaction de Sa Majesté et je saisis cette occasion de vous\r\n    offrir l’assurance de ma considération distinguée._\r\n\r\n  _Le Premier Gentilhomme\r\n  de la Chambre du Roi_\r\n\r\n  Aux Tuileries ce 20 Février 1824.       Le duc d’Achâts.\r\n\r\n“This was a distinction,” says Schindler, “than which one more\r\nsignificant never fell to the lot of the artist during his life”; but\r\nthe biographer certainly is in error when he intimates that the medal\r\nwas given in payment of the subscription price. Beethoven informed\r\nArchduke Rudolph that the King had accepted the invitation in his\r\nletter of June 1, 1823; the medal was received early in 1824, over\r\neight months later. Beethoven’s needs and the reply which he gave the\r\nmessenger from Prussia when he offered a decoration instead of the 50\r\nducats, indicate plainly enough how he felt as to the remuneration.\r\nMoreover, in a billet which he sent to Schindler instructing him\r\nto call upon von Obreskow of the Russian Embassy to tell him how\r\nto pay the subscription of the Czar, Beethoven says: “let him know\r\nincidentally, when opportunity offers, that France simply sent the\r\nmoney to you.” Evidently King Louis XVIII paid the money in the regular\r\nway and sent the medal as a special mark of distinction.\r\n\r\nNo subscription was received from the King of Naples. The negotiations\r\nwith the Grand Duke of Tuscany were more successful, though they\r\ndragged on into the next year. They were a subject of discussion\r\nin the Conversation Book in which Count Lichnowsky, Brother Johann\r\nand Nephew Karl took part. From remarks there recorded it appears\r\nthat an appeal was also made to Ex-Empress Maria Louisa, Duchess of\r\nParma. Here the agent was Odelga and there was a plan to interest\r\nCountess Neuberg. Count Lichnowsky seems to have suggested the name\r\nof Maria Louisa and offered to write to Count Neuberg, whom he knew,\r\non the subject. It looks also as if the case of the Grand Duke of\r\nTuscany had been exceptional, in that the Mass had been forwarded\r\nbefore the subscription had been received; this at least might be\r\nthe interpretation of a remark noted by Karl: “I shall go to Odelga\r\non Sunday. We must get to work, or they will keep the Mass and send\r\nnothing.”\r\n\r\nSchindler says that Beethoven sent a carefully written letter to the\r\nKing of Sweden to accompany the invitation; but nothing came of it. The\r\nKing of Denmark subscribed, but as we hear nothing of the particulars,\r\nit is most likely that everything went smoothly in his case.\r\n\r\nPrince Galitzin was asked to make a plea to the Russian Court and\r\nreported in a letter to Beethoven, dated June 2, that the invitation\r\nhad been accepted and the official notification would follow in due\r\ncourse through the Russian Embassy. The money came soon afterwards. On\r\nJuly 9, Schindler writes in a jocular vein, using a metaphor which had\r\nalready done service in Beethoven’s correspondence:\r\n\r\n    I take pleasure in reporting to you herewith, that by command of\r\n    the Emperor of all the Russias, 50 horsemen in armor are arrived\r\n    here as a Russian contingent to do battle under you for the\r\n    Fatherland. The leader of these choice troops is a Russian Court\r\n    Councillor. Herr Stein, pianoforte maker, has been commissioned\r\n    by him to quarter them on you. _Rien de nouveau chez nos voisins\r\n    jusqu’ici._\r\n\r\n  _Fidelissimus Papageno._[74]\r\n\r\nThe director of the business affairs of the Russian Embassy, von\r\nObreskow, had made inquiry as to how the fee was to be paid. Beethoven\r\nwrote to Schindler to tell Obreskow to pay the bearer on delivery of a\r\nreceipt; to say (if it became opportune) that the King of France had\r\ndone so; and admonished him always to remember that such personages\r\nrepresented “Majesty itself”; also to “say nothing about the Mass\r\nnot being finished, which is not true, for the new pieces are only\r\nadditions.” Impatience at the non-delivery of the Mass at the expected\r\ntime must have been expressed by the Russian Embassy, for in a note\r\nwhich Schindler dates “in the winter of 1824,” Beethoven says:\r\n\r\n    Mr. v. Schindler:\r\n\r\n    Here the _Paquett_ for the Russian Embassy, please look after it at\r\n    once, moreover say that I shall soon visit him in person, inasmuch\r\n    as it hurts me that lack of confidence has been felt in me and I\r\n    thank God I am in a position to prove that I do not deserve it in\r\n    any way nor will my honor permit it.[75]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PRINCE GALITZIN’S SUBSCRIPTION]\r\n\r\nPrince Galitzin, who had already expressed his delight in the new work\r\nand who had also been invited to subscribe, suggested that the Mass\r\nbe published by popular subscription at four or five ducats, as there\r\nwere not many amateurs who could afford to pay 50 ducats for a written\r\ncopy. “All that I can do,” the Prince writes in conclusion, “is to beg\r\nyou to put me down among your subscribers and to send me a copy as soon\r\nas possible so that I may produce it at a concert for the benefit of\r\nthe widows of musicians which takes place annually near Christmas.”\r\nPlainly, this was a subscription in the existing category; there was no\r\nother, and Beethoven, in view of the invitation to the courts, could\r\nnot at once entertain the subject of a popular subscription for a\r\nprinted edition. Galitzin also accedes to a request which had obviously\r\nbeen made to him when the invitation was extended, that the 50 ducats\r\nalready deposited in Vienna by him for a quartet be applied to the\r\naccount of the Mass. He writes on September 23 (October 3): “I have\r\njust received your letter of the 17th and hasten to answer that I have\r\ninstructed the house of Henikstein to pay you immediately the 50 ducats\r\nwhich I fancied had long ago been placed at your disposal.” The bankers\r\nHenikstein sent the Prince Beethoven’s receipt for the 50 ducats “which\r\nwe paid to him on the order and account of Your Highness as fee for\r\nthe Mass which we have forwarded through the High State Chancellary.”\r\nThe score was in the hands of Prince Galitzin on November 29, but the\r\nperformance which he had projected did not take place until April 6,\r\n1824. It was the first performance of the Mass anywhere, and Galitzin\r\nwrote an enthusiastic account of it to Beethoven under date of April\r\n8.[76]\r\n\r\nA special invitation to subscribe to the Mass was not extended to the\r\nAustrian court for reasons which, no doubt, were understood between\r\nBeethoven and Archduke Rudolph and which may have been connected with\r\nefforts which were making at the time to secure a court appointment\r\nfor the composer. At the request of Artaria, however, an invitation\r\nwas sent to Prince Paul Esterhazy. Beethoven had little confidence in\r\nthe successful outcome of the appeal, probably with a recollection in\r\nhis mind of the Prince’s attitude toward him on the occasion of the\r\nproduction of the Mass in C in 1807, to which he seems to refer in a\r\nletter to Schindler dated June 1:[77]\r\n\r\n    /# You will kindly again make inquiry of (_illegible_) for a\r\n    report. I doubt if it will be favorable for I do not expect a good\r\n    opinion from him, at least not to judge by earlier times! I think\r\n    that such matters can only be successfully presented to him by\r\n    women.\r\n\r\nBeethoven’s suspicious nature had other food. On the outside of this\r\nletter he wrote:\r\n\r\n    N. B. So far as I can remember there was nothing said in the\r\n    invitation to Prince Esterhazy about the Mass being distributed\r\n    only in manuscript. What mischief may not result from this. I\r\n    suspect that the purpose of Herr Artaria in suggesting that the\r\n    Mass be offered to the Prince gratis was to enable him to steal a\r\n    work of mine for the third time.\r\n\r\nBeethoven’s lack of faith in the enterprise was justified; Esterhazy\r\ndid not subscribe.\r\n\r\nNo invitation was sent to the English court, probably because Beethoven\r\ncherished a grudge in that quarter; but subscriptions were asked\r\nof two large singing societies--the Singakademie of Berlin and the\r\nCäcilien-Verein of Frankfort. Zelter was director of the Singakademie,\r\nand to him Beethoven wrote on February 8 as follows, after the\r\nintroductory compliments and reflections:\r\n\r\n    I wrote a Grand Mass, which might also be performed as an oratorio\r\n    (for the benefit of the poor, as is the good custom that has been\r\n    introduced) but did not want to publish it in print in the ordinary\r\n    way, but to give it to the principal courts only. The fee amounts\r\n    to 50 ducats. Except the copies subscribed for, none will be\r\n    issued, so that the Mass is practically only a manuscript.\r\n\r\nHe informs Zelter that an appeal has been sent to the King of Prussia\r\nand that he has asked the intercession in its behalf of Prince\r\nRadziwill. He then continues:\r\n\r\n    I ask of you that you do what you can in the matter. A work of\r\n    this kind might also be of service to the Singakademie, for there\r\n    is little wanting to make it practicable for voices alone; but the\r\n    more doubled and multiplied the latter in combination with the\r\n    instruments, the more effective it would be. It might also be in\r\n    place as an oratorio, such as is in demand for the Societies for\r\n    Poverty. More or less ill for several years and therefore not in\r\n    the most brilliant situation, I had recourse to this means. I have\r\n    written much but accumulated almost 0. Disposed to send my glances\r\n    aloft--but man is compelled for his own and for others’ sake to\r\n    direct them downwards; but this too is a part of man’s destiny.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ZELTER AND THE SOLEMN MASS]\r\n\r\nThe letter will be seen, on comparison with that written on the same\r\nday to Goethe, to be either a draft for the latter in part or an echo\r\nof it. There is the same pun on “geschrieben” and “erschrieben,” the\r\nsame lament about having to keep his eyes on the ground while desirous\r\nto keep them fixed on higher things, the same reference to the value\r\nof the Mass for concert purposes in behalf of charity. As this last\r\npoint is one which would naturally occur to the writer in addressing a\r\nmusician and not at all naturally in an appeal to a poet, it is safe\r\nto say that the Zelter letter was written first. It is an unpleasant\r\nduty to call attention to a very significant difference between this\r\nletter and the invitation issued to the courts as well as the letter\r\nto Goethe. In the latter he distinctly says that the Mass will not be\r\npublished in the ordinary way “for the present,” thus reserving the\r\nprivilege of printing it at a future time. To Zelter, and presumably\r\nto the Frankfort society, he plainly intimates that there is to be no\r\npublication in the ordinary way at all. It is not a violent presumption\r\nthat Zelter may have observed this discrepancy, which was of vital\r\nmoment to his society, and that this may have caused the termination of\r\nthe negotiations, which began auspiciously enough in a letter written\r\nby Zelter on February 22 in reply to Beethoven’s. In this letter he\r\nsaid he was ready to purchase the Mass for the Singakademie at his own\r\nrisk, provided Beethoven would adapt it to the use of the society--that\r\nis, arrange it for performance practically without instruments--a\r\nproceeding, he explained, which would make it practicable for all\r\nsimilar concert institutions. To this letter Beethoven replied on March\r\n25:\r\n\r\n    I have carefully considered your suggestion for the Singakademie.\r\n    If it should ever appear in print I will send you a copy without\r\n    pay. It is true that it might almost be performed _a la capella_,\r\n    but to this end the whole would have to be arranged. Perhaps you\r\n    have the patience to do this. Besides, there is already a movement\r\n    in it which is entirely _a la capella_ and I am inclined to call\r\n    this style the only true church style. I thank you for your\r\n    readiness. From such an artist as you are, _with honor_, I would\r\n    never accept anything. I honor you and desire only an opportunity\r\n    to prove this to you in deed.\r\n\r\nThere the matter ended, so far as is known. The negotiations with\r\nthe Frankfort society were more successful. On May 19, 1823, J. N.\r\nSchelble, director, wrote saying:\r\n\r\n    The hope of receiving a new composition from you, great master,\r\n    inspires all the members and reinvigorates their musical zeal. I\r\n    therefore request you as soon as it is convenient to you to forward\r\n    a copy of your Mass to me.\r\n\r\nThere were, therefore, as appears from this account and the list of\r\nnames sent in November, 1825, to the publishers of the Mass, ten\r\nsubscribers, namely: the Czar of Russia, the Kings of Prussia, Saxony,\r\nFrance and Denmark, the Grand Dukes of Tuscany and Hesse-Darmstadt,\r\nPrinces Galitzin and Radziwill and the Cäcilia Society of Frankfort.\r\nBeethoven’s receipts, 500 ducats (£250 or about $1200), were very\r\nmaterially reduced, how much we can not say, by the costs of copying.\r\nIn this work his principal helper was a professional copyist named\r\nSchlemmer, who could best decipher his manuscript. But Schlemmer\r\nwas sickly and died before the year was over; his successor was\r\nnamed Rampel, and seems to have caused Beethoven a great deal of\r\nannoyance; he probably was made to bear a great deal of the blame for\r\nthe tardiness of the work, for which, also, the composer’s frequent\r\nalterations were in part responsible. One of the numerous letters to\r\nSchindler from this period throws a little light on this subject:\r\n\r\n    Samothracian L----l.[78]\r\n\r\n    How about the trombone part. It is certain that the youngster still\r\n    has it, as he did not return it when he brought back the _Gloria_.\r\n    There was so much to do in looking over the wretched scribbling\r\n    that to carry back the trombone part was forgotten. If necessary,\r\n    I shall come to Vienna about the police matter. Here, for Rampel,\r\n    is first the theme of the _Var._ which is to be copied for me on\r\n    a separate sheet--then he is to copy the rest to _Var._ 13 or to\r\n    the end of _Var._ 12, and so an end of this. Get from Schlemmer\r\n    what remains of the _Kyrie_:--show him the postscript and herewith\r\n    _satis_.--for such _Hauptl----ls_ there is nothing more to be done.\r\n    Farewell--attend to everything--I am obliged to bind up my eyes\r\n    at night and must be very sparing in my use of them. Otherwise,\r\n    Smettana writes, I shall write but few more notes. To Wocher,\r\n    whom I shall visit myself as soon as I come to town, my prettiest\r\n    compliments and has he yet sent away the _Var._?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: NEGOTIATIONS WITH DIABELLI]\r\n\r\nBeethoven’s thoughts in connection with the Mass were not all engrossed\r\nduring 1823 with the finishing touches on the composition and the\r\nsubscription; he was still thinking of the publication of the work.\r\nHis thoughts went to London, as a letter to Ries shows. The Mass\r\nalso came up in his dealings with Diabelli in Vienna. There were,\r\nprobably, other negotiations, of which we are not advised. An agreement\r\nhad been reached with Diabelli concerning the Variations, Op. 120\r\n(on the Diabelli waltz theme), and the Mass had also been mentioned.\r\nWhatever the nature of the negotiations may have been, Diabelli now\r\nseems to have been insisting on conditions which Beethoven could not\r\naccept without breach of contract with his subscribers or revoking the\r\nsubscriptions. In March Diabelli called Schindler into his shop and\r\nhad a talk with him which is detailed in a Conversation Book. It is\r\nSchindler who is speaking:\r\n\r\n    Diabelli called me in to-day while I was passing and said to\r\n    me that he would take the Mass and publish it in two months by\r\n    subscription. He guarantees you the 1000 florins, as he says he has\r\n    already told you. You can have as many copies as you want--Diabelli\r\n    only asks of you that you let him know your decision within a\r\n    few days, then he will have work begun at once and promises that\r\n    everything shall be ready by the end of May. You, however, will not\r\n    have any further care in the matter. I think the proposition a very\r\n    good one, the more, because the work will be printed at once.\r\n\r\nBeethoven appears to have doubts or scruples on the score of the\r\ninvitations sent to the sovereigns.\r\n\r\n    It will make no difference to the most exalted courts if printed\r\n    copies are put out. Do you want the 1000 florins in cash at once\r\n    or later?--he assures me that they will be guaranteed to you; the\r\n    business now is that you come to an understanding.\r\n\r\nIt appears, now, that Diabelli wants to publish the three supplementary\r\npieces also; but Beethoven still hesitates:\r\n\r\n    It would be best if you were to persuade Diabelli to print the\r\n    work at once, but wait a few months with the publication by\r\n    subscription. Then you will not be compromised in the matter, nor\r\n    he either.\r\n\r\nLater (there has plainly been another consultation between Schindler\r\nand Diabelli):\r\n\r\n    Diabelli agrees to wait until the tardy answers have been received\r\n    before opening the subscription. But he is not willing to wait a\r\n    whole year.\r\n\r\nAnd in April:\r\n\r\n    Are you agreed? The only question is whether you give Diab. the\r\n    privilege of announcing the subscription a month before he pays. It\r\n    is his wish not to put the Mass in hand until he has paid. About\r\n    Diabelli then--do you want to leave the matter to me or consider\r\n    the publication by yourself? Diabelli wants the Mass by July 1 in\r\n    order to have it ready by the St. Michael Fair.\r\n\r\nLater, August 1 and September 1 are mentioned. Beethoven was firm in\r\nhis determination to keep faith with his subscribers. He writes to\r\nSchindler: “There are only two courses as regards the Mass, namely,\r\nthat the publisher delay the publication a year and a day; or, if\r\nnot, we can not accept a subscription.” Later he writes: “Nothing is\r\nto be changed in the Diabelli contract except that _the time_ when he\r\nis to receive the Mass from me be left undetermined.” The contract in\r\nquestion which was thus to be amended concerned the Variations, but\r\npresumably the Mass also. Beethoven writes:\r\n\r\n    From my little book I see that you have doubts in the matter of the\r\n    Mass and Diab., wherefore, I beg you to come soon, for in that case\r\n    we will not give him the Var. either, as my brother knows somebody\r\n    who wants to take them both. We are therefore in a position to talk\r\n    to him.\r\n\r\nEither this disagreement or some other in a matter in which Schindler\r\nacted as Beethoven’s agent brought out a letter from the latter to\r\nthe former in which he expresses a belief that the business, “so\r\ndisagreeable to you,” might be brought to a conclusion soon: “moreover\r\nI was not, unfortunately, entirely wrong in not wholly trusting Diab.”\r\nSchindler, in a gloss on this note, says that the disagreeable business\r\nconcerned the Mass. Diabelli had made plans which were not only\r\nharmful to the work but humiliating as well to Beethoven. Schindler\r\npointed this out and Diabelli became violent and declared that since\r\nthe contract was as good as closed he would summon Schindler before a\r\ncourt of law if it were not kept. “But,” says Schindler, “the threat\r\ndid no good; he had to take back the document.” The numerous notes to\r\nSchindler about this period are undated and the times at which they\r\nwere written have been only approximately fixed by Schindler; there\r\nis also some vagueness touching the time and order of the written\r\nconversations, but the evidence thus far presented, together with a\r\nsignificant remark in a billet to Schindler, to the effect that he\r\nhad thought of a project which would “act like a pistol-shot on this\r\nfellow,” would seem to justify the assumption that Beethoven had\r\nentered into the same kind of obligation with Diabelli as he had with\r\nSimrock and Peters so far as the Mass was concerned, and that before\r\nthe execution of a formal contract, which seems to have been considered\r\nnecessary in this case, which was to include the Variations on the\r\nDiabelli Waltz theme, Beethoven had embarked on his enterprise with\r\nthe sovereigns, which made the speedy publication of the Mass in the\r\nordinary way impossible with honor; further, that a threat to withhold\r\nthe Variations had been used to bring the irate publisher to terms. In\r\nthe April Conversation Book Schindler says: “Won’t Diabelli make wry\r\nfaces when your brother demands the document back almost as soon as he\r\nhas received it!”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DUBIOUS ASPECT OF THE NEGOTIATIONS]\r\n\r\nTo the commercialized mind of to-day it is possible that the picture\r\nwhich has just been presented here of a superlatively great artist\r\nhawking his creations in the courts of Europe, appealing to his friends\r\nand patrons among the great to act as his go-betweens, railing against\r\nthe tardy and permitting those who were prompt in payment to wait\r\nunconscionable periods for their property, may seem to present as\r\nlittle of the aspect of debasement of genius and its products as it\r\ndid at a time when great musicians were menials in the households of\r\nthe highborn, and thrift could only follow fawning. But Beethoven had\r\ndone much to exalt art and emancipate the artist, and what would have\r\ncaused little comment in the case of his predecessors amongst court\r\nmusicians was scarcely venial in him who preached a new ethic as well\r\nas artistic evangel. And so, to minds untainted by trade and attuned\r\nto a love of moral as well as æsthetic beauty, the spectacle which\r\nBeethoven presents in 1823 must be quite as saddening as that disclosed\r\nby his dealings with the publishers in the years immediately preceding.\r\nA greater measure of commiseration goes out to him now, however,\r\nbecause of the evidence that the new phase cost him greater qualms\r\nof conscience and that the exigencies which impelled him were more\r\npressing. His physical ailments were increasing; his deafness had put a\r\nstop to his appearances in public as an artist; his eyes were troubling\r\nhim; there was no lessening of his concern about his ward, but an\r\nincrease in the cost of his maintenance; his income was continually\r\ndwindling because of his lessening productivity, notwithstanding that\r\nthe fees which he could command for new works (and even the remnants\r\nof his youthful activity) had reached dimensions of which he had\r\nnever dreamed in the heyday of his powers; he felt the oppressive\r\nburden of his debts more and more as his unreasoning love for his\r\nfoster-son prompted him to make provision against the future. The royal\r\nsubscription was, no doubt, a welcome scheme which, if not suggested by\r\nhis advisers, was certainly encouraged by them; but it must have cost\r\nhis proud soul no little humiliation to have his application rejected\r\nafter he had so deeply bent “the pregnant hinges of the knee.” The\r\npublishers gave him less concern. They were his natural enemies and he\r\ntheirs--“hellhounds who licked and gnawed his brains,” as he expressed\r\nit in a letter to Holz in 1825; yet he knew that he would need them,\r\nand he knew also that as soon as he went to them, and the mass appeared\r\nin print, the manuscript copies which he had sold would be all but\r\nworthless. But this may have troubled him little, as he, in all\r\nlikelihood, shared Schindler’s conviction that there was no permanency\r\nof interest in the work on the part of the crowned heads and that they\r\nwould not be troubled by the appearance of the work in print. Patronage\r\nof art is part of the obligation which rests upon royalty, and it\r\nwould have been little less than a crime to withhold the Mass from\r\nthe public; but what of the exclusiveness of right which was implied,\r\nif not expressed, in the letter to Zelter and presumably also in that\r\nto the Cæcilia Society of Frankfort? He had informed the kings, who\r\nmight not even deign to glance at the Mass, that he had no “present”\r\nintention to print the work, leaving them to gather that he would do so\r\nlater; but he plainly gives Zelter to understand that it is to remain\r\na manuscript. Here, too, the advice of his friends, who could see his\r\nneed but did not feel the moral responsibility which he may, or ought\r\nto, have felt, must have been persuasive and also comforting.[79] The\r\nworld has too long enjoyed the great work to distress itself about the\r\ncircumstances of its creation and publication; but the historian and\r\nmoralist may yet as deeply deplore them as pity the conditions which\r\ncompelled the composer to yield to them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEALINGS WITH THE LONDON PHILHARMONIC]\r\n\r\nPreliminary to the narrative of the other varied incidents of the year\r\n1823, let us set down a brief mention of the fact that on January 20\r\nBeethoven wrote a little piece for voice and pianoforte in the album\r\nof Countess Wimpfen, _née_ Eskeles, on the words of Goethe: “Der edle\r\nMensch sei hülfreich und gut,” [_sic_] which was published in facsimile\r\nin the “Allgemeine Wiener Musikzeitung” on November 23, 1843. Having\r\ntraversed the year in our search for material relating to the Mass\r\nin D, the next most significant subject is that which concerned the\r\nSymphony in D minor, on which he worked industriously and which had\r\nbeen the subject of correspondence between himself and Ries (in London)\r\nfor some time before the year opened. On April 6, 1822, Beethoven had\r\ninquired of his old pupil: “What would the Philharmonic Society be\r\nlikely to offer me for a symphony?” Ries, evidently, laid the matter\r\nbefore the directors of the society who, at a meeting on November 10,\r\n“resolved to offer Beethoven fifty pounds for a MS. symphony.”[80] Ries\r\nconveyed the information to Beethoven in a letter dated November 15\r\nand in a reply dated December 20, Beethoven, although he protested that\r\nthe remuneration was not to be compared with what other nations might\r\ngive, accepted the offer, adding:\r\n\r\n    I would write _gratis_ for the first artists of Europe, if I were\r\n    not still poor Beethoven. If I were in London, what would I not\r\n    write for the Philharmonic Society! For Beethoven can write, God be\r\n    thanked, though he can do nothing else in this world. If God gives\r\n    me back my health, which has at least improved somewhat, I shall\r\n    yet be able to comply with all the requests which have come from\r\n    all parts of Europe, and even from North America, and I might yet\r\n    feather my nest.\r\n\r\nA glimpse into the occupations, cares and perplexities which beset\r\nBeethoven at this period is given by the first letter in the series\r\nwritten in the new year--on February 5, which Ries, in his “Notizen,”\r\ngives only in part:\r\n\r\n    I have no further news to give you about the _Sinfonie_ but\r\n    meanwhile you may confidently count on it. Since I have made the\r\n    acquaintance here of a very amiable and cultivated man, who holds\r\n    an appointment in our imperial embassy at London, he will undertake\r\n    later to forward the Symphony to you in London, so that _it will\r\n    soon be in London_. Were I not so poor that I am obliged to live by\r\n    my pen I would accept nothing at all from the Ph. Society; as it is\r\n    I must wait until the fee for the Sinfonie is deposited here. But\r\n    to give you an evidence of my affection for and confidence in the\r\n    society I have already delivered the new Overture referred to in my\r\n    last letter, to the gentleman of the Imperial society.[81] As he is\r\n    to start from here for London in a few days he will deliver it to\r\n    you in person in London. Goldschmidt will no doubt know where you\r\n    live; if not, please tell him, so that this accommodating gentleman\r\n    will not be obliged long to hunt you. I leave to the Society all\r\n    the arrangements about the Overture which, like the Symphony, it\r\n    can keep for 18 months. Not until after the lapse of that time\r\n    shall I publish it. And now another request: my brother here, who\r\n    keeps his carriage, wanted a lift from me and so, without asking\r\n    me, he offered the Overture in question to a publisher in London\r\n    named Bosey [Boosey]. Let him wait, and tell him that at present\r\n    it is impossible to say whether he can have the Overture or not;\r\n    I will write to him myself. It all depends on the Philharmonic\r\n    Society; say to him please that my brother made a mistake in the\r\n    matter of the Overture; as to the other works which he wrote about,\r\n    he may have them. My brother _bought them_ of me in order to\r\n    traffic with them, as I observe. _O frater!_ I beg of you to write\r\n    to me as soon as possible after you have received the Overture,\r\n    whether the Philharmonic Society will take it, for otherwise I\r\n    shall publish it soon.\r\n\r\n    I have heard nothing of your _Sinfonie_ dedicated to me. If I did\r\n    not look upon the _Dedicat_ as a sort of challenge for which I\r\n    might give you _Revanche_ I should long ago have dedicated some\r\n    work to you. As it is, I have always thought that I must first\r\n    see your work. How willingly would I show you my gratitude in\r\n    some manner. I am deeply your debtor for so many proofs of your\r\n    affection and for favors. If my health is improved by a bath-cure\r\n    which I am to take in the coming summer I will kiss your wife in\r\n    London in 1824.\r\n\r\nWhat justification Beethoven had, or imagined he had, for imputing a\r\ndishonorable act to his brother, cannot be said; it is noteworthy,\r\nhowever, that he does not even mention him in a letter written twenty\r\ndays later which reiterates much that had already been set forth,\r\nand offers to send the Symphony at once on receiving word from Ries\r\naccompanied by a draft. He also intends to send six Bagatelles and\r\nasks Ries to traffic, as best he can, with them and two sonatas. Had\r\nhe received a dedication from Ries, he says, he would at once have\r\ninscribed the Overture to him. Not long afterward Beethoven wrote\r\nagain to Ries. The letter, which has been preserved only in part, is\r\nprinted with a few omissions and changes in the “Notizen” (p. 154).\r\nIts significant remark about the new Symphony is that it is to bear a\r\ndedication to Ries; its most valuable contribution, however, refers\r\nto the Mass in D and the explanation which it offers of the fact that\r\nBeethoven sent no invitation to the English court to subscribe for\r\nthat work. “In addition to these hardships,” Beethoven writes, “I have\r\nmany debts to pay, for which reason it would be agreeable to me if you\r\nhave disposed of the Mass to send me also the check for it, for by\r\nthat time the copy for London will have been made. There need be no\r\nscruples because of the few _souverains_ who are to get copies of it.\r\nIf a local publisher made no objections, there ought to be still fewer\r\nin London; moreover, I bind myself in writing that not a note of it\r\nshall appear either in print or otherwise.” The poor Archduke-Cardinal\r\ncomes in for his customary drubbing, the special complaint now being\r\nthat Beethoven is obliged to draw his “wretched salary” with the aid of\r\na stamp. The letter was placed for delivery in the hands of the amiable\r\ngentleman of the Austrian Embassy whose name we now learn to be Bauer\r\nand who was also the bearer of an address to King George IV[82] which\r\nRies was to ask Bauer to read, after which the latter was to see to its\r\ndelivery into the royal hands and if possible get in return at least\r\na “butcher’s knife or a tortoise”; a printed copy of the “Battle of\r\nVittoria” was to accompany it. The character of the address to the king\r\ncan be guessed at from the following draft for an earlier letter which\r\nwas found amongst Schindler’s papers:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AN APPEAL TO THE KING OF ENGLAND]\r\n\r\n    In thus presuming, herewith, to submit my most obedient prayer to\r\n    Your Majesty, I venture at the same time to supplement it with a\r\n    second.\r\n\r\n    Already in the year 1823, the undersigned took the liberty, at\r\n    the frequent requests of several Englishmen then living here, to\r\n    send his composition entitled “Wellington’s Battle and Victory at\r\n    Vittoria” which no one possessed at that time (to Your Majesty).\r\n    The then Imperial Russian Ambassador, Prince Rasoumowsky, undertook\r\n    to send the work to Your Majesty by a courier.\r\n\r\n    For many years the undersigned cherished the sweet wish that Your\r\n    Majesty would graciously make known the receipt of his work to him;\r\n    but he has not yet been able to boast of this happiness, and had\r\n    to content himself with a brief notice from Mr. Ries, his former\r\n    worthy pupil, who reported that Y. M. had been pleased graciously\r\n    to deliver the work to the then Musical Director, Mr. Salomon\r\n    and Mr. Smart for public performance in Drury Lane Theatre. This\r\n    appears also from the English journals, which added, as did Mr.\r\n    Ries, that the work had been received with extraordinary favor\r\n    not only in London but elsewhere. Inasmuch as it was extremely\r\n    humiliating to the undersigned to learn all this from indirect\r\n    sources, Y. M. will surely pardon his sensitiveness and graciously\r\n    permit him to observe that he spared neither time nor cost to lay\r\n    this work before your exalted person in the most proper manner in\r\n    order to provide a pleasure for Y. M.\r\n\r\n    From this the undersigned concludes, that it may have been\r\n    improperly submitted to Y. M. and inasmuch as the most obedient\r\n    petition which is now submitted, enables him again to approach Y.\r\n    M., he takes the privilege of handing to Y. M. accompanying printed\r\n    copy of the Battle of Vittoria in score, which has been set aside\r\n    for this purpose ever since 1815 and which has been retained so\r\n    long because of the uncertainty felt by the undersigned concerning\r\n    the matter.\r\n\r\n    Convinced of the lofty wisdom and graciousness which Y. M. has\r\n    hitherto shown toward art and artists to their appreciation and\r\n    good fortune, the undersigned flatters himself that Your Majesty\r\n    will graciously condescend to take all this in consideration and\r\n    grant his most humble petition.\r\n\r\n    [_Convaincu de la haute sagesse dont Votre Majesté a toujours su\r\n    apprecier l’art ainsi que de la haute faveur qu’elle accordé a\r\n    l’artiste le soussigné se flatte que Votre Majesté prendra l’un\r\n    et l’autre en consideration et vaudra en grace condescendre a sa\r\n    tres-humble demande._]\r\n\r\n    _a Vienne le 24 fevrier._\r\n\r\nThere are other letters to Ries which must be considered later. They\r\ndo not bear out Schindler’s contention that an estrangement had taken\r\nplace between former master and pupil, but were it not that Beethoven’s\r\nutterances on that point were chronic when negotiating sales of his\r\nworks it might be said that they show that his burden of debt rested\r\nwith peculiar grievousness upon him at this time. That it did trouble\r\nhim more than ordinarily is otherwise evidenced. In April Schindler\r\nwrites: “Don’t think night and day about your debts. When you are\r\nwell again you’ll pay them without feeling it.” Steiner, who may have\r\nthought that consideration was no longer incumbent on him, now that\r\nBeethoven was offering his works to other publishers, pressed him\r\nfor the money which he had loaned him and threatened to sue him for\r\n800 florins. Beethoven presented a counter-claim and demanded that\r\nSteiner publish a number of compositions which he had purchased but had\r\nnot issued. The debt to Brentano also distressed him. He had as yet\r\nreceived nothing from the royal subscribers to the _Missa Solemnis_. He\r\nappealed to his brother Johann to go security for him, but he refused.\r\nThen he consulted Dr. Bach, who advised him to dispose of one of the\r\nseven shares of bank stock which he had purchased after his stroke of\r\nfortune at the time of the Congress of Vienna. Schindler was called on\r\nto act as fiscal agent in what must have seemed a complicated matter to\r\nBeethoven, since at another time he had wanted to hypothecate a share\r\nand, on getting it out of its hiding-place, learned that all he had to\r\ndo to get the money he needed was to cut off a coupon and collect it.\r\nNow he writes to Schindler:\r\n\r\n    Do not forget the B. A. (bank share); it is highly necessary. I\r\n    should not like to be sued for nothing and less than nothing. The\r\n    conduct of my brother is worthy of him. The tailor is coming to-day\r\n    and I hope to turn him away without unpleasantness.\r\n\r\nAnother note to the same:\r\n\r\n    Try to find some philanthropist who will make me a loan on a bank\r\n    share, so that, first, I need not put too severe a strain on the\r\n    generosity of my only (the word is indistinct) friend v. B. and may\r\n    not myself get in need because of the withholding of this money due\r\n    to the beautiful arrangement made by my dear brother!\r\n\r\nOn a separate scrap of paper is written: “It must not appear that the\r\nmoney is needed.” The date of this note is fixed by the circumstance\r\nthat it is the one in which Beethoven asks Schindler to draw up a list\r\nof courts to which the invitations to subscribe to the Mass were to be\r\nsent. In still another note he refers to bank shares which evidently\r\nwere to be hypothecated. It was while in this distressful state\r\nconcerning his debts that he took the first steps toward making his\r\nnephew his legal heir. On March 6, 1823, he wrote to Bach:\r\n\r\n    Death might come unannounced and give no time to make a legal\r\n    will; therefore I hereby attest with my own hand that I declare my\r\n    nephew Karl van Beethoven to be my universal heir and that after\r\n    my death everything without exception _which can be called my\r\n    property shall belong to him_. I appoint you to be his curator, and\r\n    if there should be no testament after this you are also authorized\r\n    and requested to find a guardian for my beloved nephew--to the\r\n    exclusion of my brother Johann van Beethoven--and secure his\r\n    appointment according to law. I declare this writing to be valid\r\n    for all time as being my last will before my death. I embrace you\r\n    with all my heart.\r\n\r\nThe words excluding Johann from the guardianship were written on the\r\nthird page of the document and on the first there was this addition:\r\n“NB. In the way of capital there are 7 shares of bank stock; whatever\r\nelse is found in cash is like the bank shares to be his.” Shortly\r\nbefore his death he reiterated this bequest with modifications entailed\r\nby changed conditions.\r\n\r\nThe origin of a canon which Beethoven improvised at the coffee-house\r\n“Zur goldenen Birne” on February 20 to the words “Bester Herr Graf, Sie\r\nsind ein Schaf” is said by Schindler to have been a discussion between\r\nthe composer and Count Lichnowsky concerning a contract with Steiner.\r\nObviously, Beethoven and his adviser had disagreed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SEEKS APPOINTMENT AS COURT COMPOSER]\r\n\r\nIn November 1822, Anton Tayber, Imperial Court Composer, died.\r\nBeethoven applied for the appointment as his successor and Counts\r\nLichnowsky and Dietrichstein entered the lists for him. Beethoven made\r\na personal appeal to Dietrichstein, who was the “Court Music-Count”\r\nwho, on February 23, 1823, disclosed the plan which had been conceived\r\nto promote Beethoven’s interests with the Emperor in a letter to\r\nLichnowsky:\r\n\r\n    It would have been my duty long ago to reply to good Beethoven,\r\n    since he came to me so trustfully. But after I had spoken with\r\n    you I decided to break silence only after I had received definite\r\n    information on the subject in question. I can now tell you\r\n    positively that the post held by the deceased Tayber--who was not\r\n    Chamber but Court Composer--is not to be filled again. I do not\r\n    want to write to Beethoven because I do not like to disappoint a\r\n    man whom I so sincerely respect, and therefore I beg of you when\r\n    occasion offers to let him know the fact and then to inform me when\r\n    and where I may meet him, as I have forgotten where he lives.\r\n\r\n    I am also sending you herewith the score of a mass by Reutter\r\n    which Beethoven wished to see. It is true that H. M. the Emperor\r\n    is fond of this style, but Beethoven, if he writes a mass, need\r\n    not adhere to it. Let him follow the bent of his great genius and\r\n    have a care only that the mass be not too long or too difficult\r\n    to perform;--that it be a _tutti_ mass and have only short\r\n    soprano and alto solos in the voices (for which I have two fine\r\n    singing-boys)--but no tenor, bass or organ solos. If he wishes he\r\n    may introduce a violin, oboe or clarinet solo.\r\n\r\n    His Majesty likes to have fugues well worked out but not too long;\r\n    the _Sanctus_ and _Osanna_ as short as possible, in order not to\r\n    delay the transubstantiation, and--if I may add something on my\r\n    own account--the _Dona nobis pacem_ connected with the _Agnus Dei_\r\n    without marked interruption, and soft. In two masses by Handel\r\n    (arranged from his anthems), two by Naumann and Abbé Stadler, this\r\n    makes a particularly beautiful effect. These in brief, as results\r\n    of my experience, are the things which are to be considered and\r\n    I should congratulate myself, the court and art if our great\r\n    Beethoven were soon to take the work in hand.\r\n\r\nOn March 10 Dietrichstein sent Beethoven three texts for graduals and\r\na like number for offertories from which to choose words to be used\r\nin the mass to be composed for the emperor. On the count’s letter\r\nBeethoven wrote the memorandum: “Treat the gradual as a symphony with\r\nsong--does it follow the _Gloria_?” Here we have some light on the\r\nsubject which came up for thought during the account of Beethoven’s\r\nnegotiations with publishers for the Mass in D. It would seem to\r\nappear that Beethoven was much pleased with the interest manifested\r\nin his application by Count Dietrichstein, and looked with auspicious\r\neye upon the latter’s plan to put him into the Emperor’s good books.\r\nThere can scarcely be a doubt but that he gave considerable thought\r\nto the proposed mass even while still at work on the Mass in D. He\r\nconceived the plan of accompanying the _Kyrie_ with wind-instruments\r\nand organ only in a “new mass,” as he designates it, and sketches for\r\na _Dona nobis pacem_ which have been found “for the mass in C-sharp\r\nminor” point to a treatment which may be said to be in harmony, so\r\nfar as can be seen, with Count Dietrichstein’s suggestions. On one\r\noccasion he writes to Peters that he had not made up his mind which\r\nmass he should have, and on another that he had three masses, two\r\nother publishers having asked for such works. He tells Schindler that\r\nreports that the Mass in D was not finished were to be denied because\r\nthey were not true, the unfinished numbers being additions. So also\r\nhe writes to the Archduke. These additions were to be a gradual, an\r\noffertory, and a setting of the hymn _Tantum ergo sacramentum_, and it\r\nis a fair presumption, since appropriate texts for the first two were\r\nsent to Beethoven by Count Dietrichstein, that they were contemplated\r\nin connection with the mass for the emperor and that possibly after\r\nthe abandonment of that project they were associated with the Mass in\r\nD. Nothing is known of the music which Beethoven had in mind for these\r\nadditional numbers, but many sketches are lost and there is no knowing\r\nhow much music which was never written out Beethoven carried in his\r\nhead.[83]\r\n\r\nBeethoven spoke of the “second” mass to others besides the publishers.\r\nNothing came of it, however. He decided to postpone work on the mass\r\nfor the Emperor, pleading the pressure of other obligations in the\r\nletters of thanks which he sent to Counts Lichnowsky and Dietrichstein.\r\nThey and Archduke Rudolph were greatly disappointed and, if Schindler\r\nis to be believed, the Archduke and Lichnowsky rebuked him.[84]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONSIDERATION OF OPERATIC SUBJECTS]\r\n\r\nIn this period, too, the alluring vision of a new opera presented\r\nitself, haunted the minds of Beethoven and his friends for a space\r\nand then disappeared in the limbo of unexecuted projects. “Fidelio”\r\nhad been revived on November 3, 1822, at the Kärnthnerthor Theatre.\r\nIts success was so great that the management of the theatre offered\r\na commission to Beethoven for a new opera. Beethoven viewed the\r\nproposition favorably and his friends hailed it with enthusiasm,\r\nespecially Count Moritz Lichnowsky. Beethoven’s love for classic\r\nliterature led him to express a desire for a libretto based on some\r\nstory of the antique world. He was told that such stories were all\r\nworn threadbare. In the Conversation Books we see what suggestions\r\nwere offered by others: a text by Schlegel; Voltaire’s tragedies;\r\nSchiller’s “Fiesco.” Local poets and would-be poets were willing to\r\nthrow themselves into the breach. Friedrich August Kanne, editor of\r\nthe musical journal published by Steiner and Co., wrote a libretto\r\nwhich Beethoven sent to Schindler with a note saying that except for\r\nthe fact that the first act was rather lukewarm it was so admirably\r\nwritten that it really did not require the collaboration of “one of the\r\nfirst composers,” adding, “I do not want to say that it is just the\r\nmost suitable thing for me, but if I can rid myself of obligations to\r\nwhich I am bound, who knows what might--or will--happen!” Lichnowsky\r\ntells Beethoven in February that he is determined to see Grillparzer,\r\nwith whom he evidently wants to talk about an opera-book on “Macbeth”\r\nor “Romeo and Juliet.” Brother Johann brings Beethoven a proposition\r\nfrom Johann Sporchil, historian and publicist, and Sporchil, receiving\r\nencouragement, submitted a work act by act to the composer, who wrote\r\ncomments on the manuscripts but never did more.[85] Lichnowsky hears\r\nof an opera on “Alfred the Great,” said to be very beautiful and full\r\nof spectacular pomp. He will bring it to the composer in a few days.\r\nThe Count has also written to Grillparzer, and Beethoven, recalling\r\nthat he is an old acquaintance, resolves to visit him. Lichnowsky’s\r\nsuggestion bore fruit of a kind. Grillparzer has left us an account\r\nof his attempt to collaborate with Beethoven on an opera in his\r\n“Erinnerungen an Beethoven.”[86] The request for a libretto, he says,\r\ncame to him through Count Dietrichstein and was somewhat embarrassing\r\nto him because of his unfamiliarity with the lyric drama and his doubts\r\ntouching Beethoven’s ability, after his later works, to compose an\r\nopera. Finally, however, he decided to make the attempt, and submitted\r\na subject to Beethoven’s friends and then to Beethoven himself. It\r\nwas a semi-diabolical story drawn from Bohemian legendary history,\r\nentitled “Dragomira.” It met with Beethoven’s approval and he agreed to\r\nwrite it, but afterward changed his mind and took up the fairy tale of\r\nMelusina. Of the manner in which he treated this subject Grillparzer\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GRILLPARZER AND HIS “MELUSINA”]\r\n\r\n    So far as possible I banished the reflective element and sought,\r\n    by giving prominence to the chorus, creating powerful finales and\r\n    adopting the melodramatic style for the third act, to adjust myself\r\n    to Beethoven’s last period. I avoided a preliminary conference with\r\n    the composer concerning the subject-matter, because I wanted to\r\n    preserve the independence of my views. Moreover, it was possible to\r\n    make alterations, and in the last instance it rested with him to\r\n    compose the book or not to compose it, as he listed. In order not\r\n    to coerce him in the least I sent him the book by the same channel\r\n    which had brought me the call. He was not to be influenced by\r\n    personal considerations or embarrassed in any manner whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe book appealed to Beethoven, but several conferences between him\r\nand the poet were necessary before it was brought into satisfactory\r\nshape. Grillparzer had excluded much of the material in the old legend\r\nwhich was unsuited to dramatic treatment, and strengthened the plot\r\nwith conceits of his own invention. As soon as he had sent the text he\r\nwent to Beethoven at Schindler’s request. At first blush Beethoven was\r\nmuch pleased with the book, and he wrote Grillparzer a letter which\r\ndelighted the poet. Grillparzer describes the visit to Beethoven at his\r\nlodgings in the Kothgasse which he made in company with Schindler:\r\n\r\n    I found him lying in soiled night wear on a disordered bed, a book\r\n    in his hand. At the head of the bed was a small door which, as I\r\n    observed later, opened into the dining-room and which Beethoven\r\n    seemed in a manner to be guarding, for when subsequently a maid\r\n    came through it with butter and eggs he could not restrain himself,\r\n    in the middle of an earnest conversation, from throwing a searching\r\n    glance at the quantity of the provisions served--which gave me a\r\n    painful picture of the disorder prevailing in his domestic economy.\r\n\r\n    As we entered Beethoven arose from the bed, gave me his hand,\r\n    poured out his feelings of good-will and respect and at once\r\n    broached the subject of the opera. “Your work lives here,” said\r\n    he, pointing to his heart; “I am going to the country in a few\r\n    days and shall at once begin to compose it. Only, I don’t know\r\n    what to do with the hunters’ chorus which forms the introduction.\r\n    Weber used four horns; you see, therefore, that I must have eight;\r\n    where will this lead to?” Although I was far from seeing the need\r\n    of such a conclusion I explained to him that without injury to the\r\n    rest of the book the hunters’ chorus could be omitted, with which\r\n    concession he seemed to be satisfied, and neither then nor later\r\n    did he offer any objection to the text or ask that a change be\r\n    made. He even insisted on closing a contract with me at once. The\r\n    profits of the opera should be divided evenly between us, etc. I\r\n    declared to him, and truthfully, that I had not thought of a fee\r\n    or anything of the kind while at work.... Least of all was it to\r\n    be the subject of conversation between us. He was to do with the\r\n    book what he pleased--I would never make a contract with him. After\r\n    a good deal of talk (or rather of writing, for he could no longer\r\n    hear speech) back and forth, I took my leave, promising to visit\r\n    him in Hetzendorf after he had settled himself there.\r\n\r\n    I had hoped that he had given up all thoughts of business in regard\r\n    to the matter; but a few days later my publisher, Wallishauser,\r\n    came to me and said that Beethoven insisted upon the execution of\r\n    a contract. If I could not make up my mind, Wallishauser suggested\r\n    that I assign the property-right in the book to him and he would\r\n    arrange with Beethoven, who was already advised of such a step.\r\n    I was glad to get rid of the business, let Wallishauser pay me a\r\n    moderate sum, and banished the matter from my thoughts. Whether or\r\n    not they made a contract I do not know.\r\n\r\nOtto Jahn’s notes of a conversation with Grillparzer state that\r\nBeethoven made a contract with Barbaja, who was the _de facto_ manager\r\nof the Kärnthnerthor Theatre, for 6,000 florins, W. W. (2,500 C. M.).\r\nShortly afterward Barbaja abandoned the contract, saying to Beethoven\r\nthat he knew that though he was bound by it he could not use the opera.\r\nThereupon Beethoven tore up the document. On April 20, 1824, Duport\r\nwrote to Beethoven that Barbaja had sent word from Naples that he would\r\nlike to have an opera by Beethoven and would give time and terms as\r\nsoon as he received assurance that his contract for the theatre would\r\nbe extended from December 1. The extension was not granted. Schindler\r\ndenied that a contract between manager and composer ever existed.\r\n\r\nGrillparzer kept his promise to visit Beethoven at Hetzendorf, going\r\nthither with Schindler. Part of his account may best be given in his\r\nown words:\r\n\r\n    We took a promenade and entertained each other as well as was\r\n    possible half in conversation, half in writing, while walking.\r\n    I still remember with emotion that when we sat down to table\r\n    Beethoven went into an adjoining room and himself brought forth\r\n    five bottles. He set down one at Schindler’s plate, one at his own\r\n    and three in front of me, probably to make me understand in his\r\n    wild and simple way that I was master and should drink as much as I\r\n    liked. When I drove back to town without Schindler, who remained in\r\n    Hetzendorf, Beethoven insisted on accompanying me. He sat himself\r\n    beside me in the open carriage but instead of going only to the\r\n    edge of the village, he drove with me to the city, getting out\r\n    at the gates and, after a cordial handshake, starting back alone\r\n    on the journey of an hour and a half homeward. As he left the\r\n    carriage I noticed a bit of paper lying on the seat which he had\r\n    just vacated. I thought that he had forgotten it and beckoned him\r\n    to come back; but he shook his head and with a loud laugh, as at\r\n    the success of a ruse, he ran the faster in the opposite direction.\r\n    I unrolled the paper and it contained exactly the amount of the\r\n    carriage-hire which I had agreed upon with the driver. His manner\r\n    of life had so estranged him from all the habits and customs of\r\n    the world that it probably never occurred to him that under other\r\n    circumstances he would have been guilty of a gross offence. I took\r\n    the matter as it was intended and laughingly paid my coachman with\r\n    the money which had been given to me.[87]\r\n\r\nIn a Conversation Book used during the visit to Hetzendorf may be read\r\none side of a conversation about “Melusine” which permits us to observe\r\nthe poet’s capacity to look into the future:\r\n\r\n    Are you still of the opinion that something else ought to be\r\n    substituted for the first chorus of our opera? Perhaps a few tones\r\n    of the hunting-horns might be continued by an invisible chorus of\r\n    nymphs. I have been thinking if it might not be possible to mark\r\n    every appearance of Melusine or of her influence in the action by a\r\n    recurrent and easily grasped melody. Might not the overture begin\r\n    with this and after the rushing _Allegro_ the introduction be made\r\n    out of the same melody? I have thought of this melody as that to\r\n    which Melusine sings her first song.\r\n\r\nGrillparzer speaks of “Dragomira,” promises to send the plot to\r\nBeethoven in writing and makes many observations concerning music and\r\nmusicians which must have interested Beethoven even when he did not\r\nagree with him. He asserts that on the whole the North Germans know\r\nlittle of music--they will never produce anything higher than “Der\r\nFreischütz.” Also he has a good word for Italian opera:\r\n\r\n    And yet I cannot agree with those who unqualifiedly reject Italian\r\n    opera. To my mind there are two kinds of opera--one setting out\r\n    from the text, the other from the music. The latter is the Italian\r\n    opera. Lablache, and in a degree Fodor, are better actors than the\r\n    Germans ever had. Perhaps Mozart formed himself on the Italian\r\n    opera. It is worse now. You would have trouble to find singers for\r\n    your opera.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ADVICE SOUGHT FROM FRIENDS]\r\n\r\nThere are many others with whom Beethoven discussed the opera and\r\nwho came to him to tell him of their desire to see it written.\r\nDuport is greatly interested, wants to read the book with care and\r\nasks Beethoven’s terms; Lichnowsky is willing to risk the financial\r\noutcome; “I will go security,” he says in October, “for the money\r\nwhich you want for the opera. After selling the opera to the director\r\nyou can still reserve the right of disposing of it at home and\r\nabroad.” And again: “If you do not compose the opera it will be all\r\nday with German opera--everybody says that. After the failure of\r\nWeber’s opera ‘Euryanthe’ many sent the books back. ‘Freischütz’ is\r\nnot a genuine opera. If you can use me in any way, you know me and\r\nhow sincere I am”; and still again, towards the end of November: “You\r\nwill get incomparably more without a contract; if you want one, the\r\ndirector will make a contract with pleasure at once. Talk it over with\r\nGrillparzer; it will also be all one to him. Duport already asked about\r\nthe opera several days ago.” From other quarters Beethoven is urged\r\nto write to Duport after the latter had written to him. In a letter\r\nwhich must have been written late in the year, since Beethoven is back\r\nin his town lodgings, he writes to Grillparzer telling him that the\r\nmanagement had asked for his (Grillparzer’s) terms and suggesting that\r\nhe write directly to the management and he would do the same.[88] A\r\nlater conversation which must have taken place toward the close of\r\nthe year (and may have been the result of this letter) begins with a\r\ncomplaint by Grillparzer against the censorship for having forbidden\r\nhis “Ottokar.” Beethoven’s part in the dialogue may easily be supplied\r\nby the imagination, and it will be seen that he is still unreconciled\r\nto the opening chorus.\r\n\r\n    You have again taken up “Melusine?” I have already appealed to\r\n    the management twice but have had no answer.--I have already\r\n    said that I was compelled to ask 100 ducats for it.--Because as\r\n    a matter of fact, all the profits of an opera-book remain with\r\n    the theatre in which it is performed for the first time.--I could\r\n    have made a spoken drama out of the same material which would have\r\n    brought me three times as much--I _must_ ask so much in order to\r\n    meet my obligations to Wallishauser. For ordinary opera-books\r\n    they pay up to 300 florins C. M. Have you already begun to\r\n    compose?--Will you please write down for me where you want the\r\n    changes made?--Because then, nevertheless, the piece will _have_\r\n    to begin with a hunt.--Perhaps the last tones of a vanishing\r\n    hunters’ chorus might blend with the introduction without having\r\n    the hunters enter.--To begin with a chorus of nymphs might weaken\r\n    the effect of the chorus at the close of the first act.--I am\r\n    not quite versed in opera texts.--You want to deliver it to the\r\n    theatre by September.--The direction wants to make a creditable\r\n    showing in the eyes of the public.--Doesn’t the text of the opera\r\n    also seem too _long_ to you?--To whom are you thinking of giving\r\n    the rôle of _Raimund_?--They are talking of a young tenor who may\r\n    have made his début by that time. I believe his name is Cramolini;\r\n    besides a handsome figure he is said to have a beautiful voice.--It\r\n    is said that the direction is having him educated.--Forti is a\r\n    little too gross.--Then I am to expect your written suggestion as\r\n    to alterations, soon?--I am not busy at present.--I am ready for\r\n    anything.\r\n\r\nFor a space there is talk about oratorio texts (“Judith”) and the\r\npossibility of musical expression in the case of Christ. Then the text\r\nof “Dragomira” is referred to, concerning which Beethoven seems to have\r\nasked. Grillparzer says:\r\n\r\n    Dragomira. Great variety--great characters, effects.--The mother\r\n    of St. Wenzelaus, the Duke of Bohemia.--One of her sons kills the\r\n    other. She herself is a pagan, the better son is a Christian. They\r\n    still show the spot in Prague where she was swallowed up by the\r\n    earth with horses and equipage.--After I have lost all hope _here_\r\n    I shall send it to Berlin.\r\n\r\nThere is much more talk in the Conversation Book about the opera, but\r\nneither sequence nor date can always be determined. Lichnowsky tells\r\nhim that the management of the theatre is willing to do anything\r\nasked of it and is negotiating with Grillparzer. Brother Johann says:\r\n“Grillparzer is coming to-morrow--that is no affair of yours.--You\r\nwrote to the management to make arrangements with the poet, and to this\r\nit was agreed; hence Grillparzer must make terms.” In the same book\r\nSchikh, the editor, writes: “Why don’t you compose Grillparzer’s opera?\r\nWrite the opera first and then we shall be in a position to wish you\r\nalso to write a Requiem.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GRILLPARZER PARTS WITH BEETHOVEN]\r\n\r\nGrillparzer says that Beethoven told him in Hetzendorf that his opera\r\nwas ready (whether he meant in his head or in its essential elements\r\nin the numerous sketchbooks, the poet could not say), but after the\r\ncomposer’s death not a single note was found which could indubitably\r\nbe assigned to their common work. The poet had faithfully adhered to\r\nhis resolve not to remind the composer of the work in any way and “was\r\nnever near him again until, clad in black and carrying a burning torch\r\nin my [his] hand,” he walked behind his coffin. Grillparzer’s memory\r\nis faulty in a few details. He says that he never met Beethoven after\r\nthe visit to Hetzendorf except once; but the two men were together\r\nagain in 1824. This, however, is inconsequential; the fact remains that\r\nBeethoven did not compose “Melusine.”--Why not? Many reasons must be\r\nobvious to those who have followed this narrative closely: illness;\r\nvexation of spirit; loss of initiative; a waning of the old capacity\r\nto assimilate conceptions and ideas which did not originate in his\r\nown consciousness and were not in harmony with his own predilections.\r\nMoreover, it was the period of his greatest introspection; he was\r\ncommuning more and more with his own soul, and separating himself more\r\nand more from all agencies of utterance except the one which spoke most\r\ntruthfully and directly within him, and to which he entrusted his last\r\nrevelations--the string quartet. “Melusine” was not composed, but the\r\nopera continued to occupy his attention at intervals until deep into\r\nthe next year, and unless Holz is in error, some of his last labors\r\nwere devoted to it. Too literal an acceptance must not, therefore, be\r\ngiven to Schindler’s statement that he “suddenly” abandoned the plan of\r\nwriting a German opera because he learned that the similarity between\r\nthe subjects of “Melusine” and “Undine” would embarrass the production\r\nof the former in Berlin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: B A C H]\r\n\r\nA project which cropped out intermittently during 1823 was the writing\r\nof an overture on the musical motive suggested by the letters composing\r\nthe name of Bach. The thought seems to have become fixed in his mind\r\nin 1822, though the device of using as a motive in composition was\r\nat least as old as the Leipsic master’s “Art of Fugue,” and no doubt\r\nfamiliar to Beethoven. However, he was deeply engrossed in fugal\r\nwriting at this period and it is very likely, as Nottebohm suggests,\r\nthat he conceived an overture on the motive as a tribute to Bach’s\r\ngenius. Several sketches showing different forms of the theme appear\r\nin the books of 1823; and a collateral memorandum, “This overture with\r\nthe new symphony, and we shall have a concert (_Akademie_) in the\r\nKärnthnerthor Theatre,” amongst sketches for the last quartets in\r\n1825, shows that he clung to the idea almost to the end. Had Beethoven\r\ncarried out all the plans for utilizing the theme which presented\r\nthemselves to him between 1822 and 1825, there would have been several\r\nBach overtures; unfortunately, he carried out none.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEETHOVEN AND THE BOY LISZT]\r\n\r\nOn April 13, 1823, the boy Franz Liszt, who was studying with Carl\r\nCzerny and had made his first public appearance on the first day of\r\nthe year, gave a concert in the small Ridotto room. Together with his\r\nfather he had been presented to Beethoven by Schindler, but had not\r\nbeen received with any special marks of friendliness. The precocious\r\nboy gave expression to the hope that Beethoven would attend his\r\napproaching concert.[89] Later in the Conversation Book:\r\n\r\n    Little Liszt has urgently requested me humbly to beg you for a\r\n    theme on which he wishes to improvise at his concert to-morrow. He\r\n    will not break the seal till the time comes. The little fellow’s\r\n    improvisations do not seriously signify. The lad is a fine pianist,\r\n    but so far as his fancy is concerned it is far from the truth\r\n    to say that he really improvises (_was Phantasie anbelangt, so\r\n    ist es noch weit am Tage bis man sagen kann, er phantasiert_).\r\n    Czerny (Carl) is his teacher. Just eleven years. Do come; it will\r\n    certainly please Karl to hear how the little fellow plays. It is\r\n    unfortunate that the lad is in Czerny’s hands.--You will make good\r\n    the rather unfriendly reception of recent date by coming to little\r\n    Liszt’s concert?--It will encourage the boy.--Promise me to come.\r\n\r\nDid Beethoven attend the concert, and did he afterwards go upon the\r\nstage, lift up the prodigy and kiss him? So the world has long believed\r\non the authority of Nohl,[90] who got the story from Liszt himself.\r\nSchindler ought to be a good witness in this case, since he pleaded\r\nthe cause of the little lad before his great friend; but unfortunately\r\nSchindler in this instance gives testimony at one time which he\r\nimpeaches at another. In the second edition of his “Biography of\r\nBeethoven” (Münster, 1845, second appendix, page 71, note) he says:\r\n\r\n    One can never know if a child will grow into a man, and if so what\r\n    kind of man; so I could not foresee when I introduced the promising\r\n    boy Liszt and his father in 1823, to Beethoven, what kind of\r\n    musical vandal would grow out of this young talent. Did Beethoven\r\n    have a premonition? The reception was not the usual friendly one\r\n    and I had reason at the time not to be particularly satisfied,\r\n    since the prodigy had interested me in an unusual degree. Beethoven\r\n    himself noticed that he had been somewhat lax in his interest in\r\n    little Franz, which made it easy to persuade him to honor the\r\n    concert of little Liszt with his presence in order to atone for the\r\n    indifference he had first shown.\r\n\r\nIn the third edition of his book (1860, Part II, p. 178) he says:\r\n\r\n    The author knows of only one reception to which the term “friendly”\r\n    can not be applied. It was in the case of little Franz Liszt, who,\r\n    accompanied by his father, was presented by me. This unfriendliness\r\n    grew out of the excessive idolization of this truly sensational\r\n    talent; but chiefly it was due to the request made of Beethoven\r\n    to give the twelve-year-old lad a theme for improvisation at\r\n    his farewell concert--a request which was as indiscreet as it\r\n    was unreasonable. But hyperenthusiasm always betrays a want of\r\n    timeliness. It is not impossible that this enthusiasm, after\r\n    Beethoven had declined the request with obvious displeasure, yet\r\n    managed to secure from Emperor Franz, or at least Archduke Rudolph,\r\n    a theme for the young virtuoso. The idolatry of the wonder-child\r\n    gave the master, who had gone through so severe a school of\r\n    experience, a text for many observations on the hindrances and\r\n    clogs to the equable development of extraordinary talents as soon\r\n    as they were made the darlings of the multitude. Sketches of the\r\n    life of Liszt have stated that Beethoven attended the farewell\r\n    concert of 1823; in Schilling’s encyclopædia it is added that\r\n    Beethoven at this concert shook the hand of little Liszt and\r\n    thereby designated him as worthy of the name of artist. Beethoven\r\n    did _not_ attend the concert; nor any private concert after\r\n    1816.[91]\r\n\r\nThe visit of Louis Schloesser, afterwards chapelmaster in Darmstadt,\r\nwho delivered the message from the Grand Duke of Hesse-Darmstadt,\r\ntook place in the spring of the year. His description of the visit\r\nwas printed in the journal “Hallelujah” in 1885 (Nos. 20 and 21).\r\nSchloesser revisited him later and met him afterwards in town, walking\r\nwith him to Steiner, whom he said he was about to take to task for a\r\nremissness. “When it comes to the publication of a new work,” Beethoven\r\nsaid, “they would like to postpone it as long as possible, even till\r\nafter my death, thinking thus to do a better business with it; but I\r\nshall checkmate them.” Schloesser was surprised on this occasion to\r\nfind Beethoven dressed with unwonted elegance and remarked the fact to\r\nMayseder, who explained, with a smile, that it was not the first time\r\nthat his friends had stolen his old clothes at night and left new ones\r\nin their place. Mayseder added that the substitution was never noticed\r\nby Beethoven, who donned the garments with perfect calmness. Schloesser\r\nobserves that he never detected the least sign of absentmindedness in\r\nBeethoven.\r\n\r\nAt the last meeting between the men Schloesser showed Beethoven one of\r\nhis compositions, a somewhat complicated work. Beethoven looked through\r\nit and observed: “You write too much; less would have been better.\r\nThat’s the way of our young heaven-stormers who think that they can\r\nnever do enough. But that will change with riper age, and I prefer a\r\nsuperabundance to a paucity of ideas.” To the question how this might\r\nbe attained Schloesser says Beethoven replied “literally”:\r\n\r\n    I carry my thoughts about me for a long time, often a very long\r\n    time, before I write them down. Meanwhile my memory is so tenacious\r\n    that I am sure never to forget, not even in years, a theme that has\r\n    once occurred to me. I change many things, discard and try again\r\n    until I am satisfied. Then, however, there begins in my head the\r\n    development in every direction and, insomuch as I know exactly what\r\n    I want, the fundamental idea never deserts me--it arises before me,\r\n    grows--I see and hear the picture in all its extent and dimensions\r\n    stand before my mind like a cast and there remains for me nothing\r\n    but the labor of writing it down, which is quickly accomplished\r\n    when I have the time, for I sometimes take up other work, but never\r\n    to the confusion of one with the other. You will ask me where I\r\n    get my ideas? That I can not tell you with certainty; they come\r\n    unsummoned, directly, indirectly,--I could seize them with my hands\r\n    out in the open air; in the woods; while walking; in the silence\r\n    of the night; early in the morning; incited by moods which are\r\n    translated by the poet into words, by me into tones,--sound and\r\n    roar and storm about me until I have set them down in notes.\r\n\r\nAt parting, Beethoven gave Schloesser a sheet containing a canon\r\nfor six voices on the words, “Edel sei der Mensch, hülfreich und\r\ngut,” with the inscription: “Words by Goethe, tones by Beethoven.\r\nVienna, May, 1823.” On the back he wrote: “A happy journey, my dear\r\nHerr Schloesser, may all things which seem desirable come to meet\r\nyou. Your devoted Beethoven.”[92] Judging by the position of the\r\ncanon in the Rudolphinian Collection, Nottebohm was of the opinion\r\nthat it was composed at an earlier date, say 1819-20. Beethoven also\r\ngave Schloesser, who was going to Paris, a letter of introduction\r\nto Cherubini which accomplished his acceptance as a pupil of the\r\nConservatoire.\r\n\r\nOur old friend Schuppanzigh, after an absence of seven years, returned\r\nto Vienna in 1823. On May 4 he gave a concert at which Piringer\r\nconducted the orchestra, and on June 14 the quartet meetings were\r\nresumed, with Holz, Weiss and Linke as his associates.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VARIATIONS ON A WALTZ BY DIABELLI]\r\n\r\nSchindler places the incident which gave the incentive to the creation\r\nof the last of Beethoven’s characteristic works for the pianoforte,\r\nthe “Variations on a Waltz by Diabelli,” Op. 120, in the winter of\r\n1822-’23. In this, as will appear presently, he was in error, as he\r\nwas also touching the date of the completion of the composition, but\r\notherwise his story is no doubt correct. Anton Diabelli, head of the\r\nmusic-publishing house of Diabelli and Co., having composed a waltz,\r\nconceived the idea of having variations written on its melody by a\r\nlarge group of the popular composers of the day. Beethoven was among\r\nthose who received the invitation, but, mindful of his experiences\r\nin 1808, when he contributed a setting of “In questa tomba” to a\r\nsimilar conglomeration, he declared that he would never do so again.\r\nMoreover, so Schindler says, he did not like the tune, which he called\r\na _Schusterfleck_.[93] He declined Diabelli’s request, but not long\r\nafterward asked Schindler to inquire of Diabelli if he were disposed\r\nto take from him a set of variations on the waltz, and if so, what\r\nhe would pay. Diabelli received the proposition with delight and\r\noffered 80 ducats, requiring not more than six or seven variations.\r\nThe contract was formally closed and Beethoven remarked to Schindler:\r\n“Good; he shall have variations on his cobble!” This the story as told\r\nby Schindler. Lenz, who claimed to have the authority of Holz for his\r\nversion, says that after receiving thirty-two variations from other\r\ncomposers, Diabelli went to Beethoven and asked him for the one which\r\nhe had promised. Beethoven inquired how many variations he already had\r\nand when Diabelli replied “Thirty-two” he said: “Well, go and publish\r\nthem and I alone will write you thirty-three.” This story, however,\r\nlacks probability. Lenz himself says that Diabelli told him that\r\nBeethoven had not agreed to write for him; hence he could not have\r\nasked for the “promised” variation. But Schindler is also wrong in\r\nsaying that the variations were the first work taken up by Beethoven\r\nafter his removal to Hetzendorf in the summer of 1823 and that they\r\nwere published in July. They were advertised as published by Diabelli\r\nin the “Wiener Zeitung” on June 16, 1823, and there are other dates\r\nto corroborate the evidence that they were finished when Beethoven\r\nremoved to Hetzendorf on May 17. On May 7 Beethoven offered them for\r\npublication to Lissner in St. Petersburg; on April 25 he wrote to\r\nRies: “You will also receive in a few weeks 33 variations on a theme,\r\ndedicated to your wife,” and on July 16: “By this time the variations\r\nmust be with you.” The date of Diabelli’s conception of the plan was\r\nprobably a whole year, even two years earlier than the date given by\r\nSchindler. In a letter dated June 5, 1822, Beethoven offered to Peters\r\n“Variations on a Waltz for pianoforte solo (there are many)” for 30\r\nducats; they must therefore have been far advanced in composition and\r\nfully planned at that time. Nottebohm says that Schubert’s contribution\r\nto the collection of variations bears on the autograph the date “March,\r\n1821.” The Variations appeared from the press of Diabelli and Co. in\r\nJune, with a dedication to Mme. Antonia von Brentano; not, it will be\r\nobserved, to the wife of Ries. Had there been an English edition there\r\nwould have been such a dedication, but it is another case in which an\r\nEnglish publisher was disappointed in the conduct of the composer. Ries\r\nhad complied with Beethoven’s solicitations and secured a publisher.\r\nHe closed an agreement with Boosey; but when the manuscript reached\r\nLondon, Boosey was already in possession of a copy of the Vienna\r\nedition and the work had also been printed in Paris. The copy made\r\nfor London bore a dedication written in large letters by Beethoven to\r\nMadame Ries; but the printed copies were inscribed to Madame Brentano.\r\nBeethoven attempted an explanation and defence in a letter to Ries\r\ndated Baden September 5:\r\n\r\n    You say that I ought to look about me for somebody to look after\r\n    my affairs. This was the case with the _Variat._ which were cared\r\n    for by my friends and Schindler. The _Variat._ were not to appear\r\n    here until after they had been published in London. The dedication\r\n    to B---- (not clear) was intended only for Germany, as I was\r\n    under obligations to her and could publish nothing else at the\r\n    time; besides only Diabelli, the publisher here, got them from\r\n    me. Everything was done by Schindler; a bigger wretch I never got\r\n    acquainted with on God’s earth--an arch-scoundrel whom I have sent\r\n    about his business. I can dedicate another work to your wife in\r\n    place of it.\r\n\r\nHow much blame in this affair really attached to Schindler is not\r\nknown; it seems pretty apparent that though Beethoven was also fuming\r\nagainst him at the time at home, he was doing duty in London as a\r\nwhipping-boy. Beethoven went right on calling in the help of the\r\n“biggest wretch on earth and arch-scoundrel.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TROUBLED BY HIS EYES AT HETZENDORF]\r\n\r\nAfter the labors and vexations of town life in the winter, the call of\r\nthe country in the summer was more than usually imperative, because the\r\nwork which had long occupied Beethoven’s mind--the Ninth Symphony--was\r\ndemanding completion. His brother Johann had invited him to visit\r\nhim on his estate near Gneixendorf, but he had declined. His choice\r\nfor the summer sojourn fell upon Hetzendorf, a village not far from\r\nVienna, where he hit upon a villa, surrounded by a beautiful park,\r\nwhich belonged to Baron Müller-Pronay. There was some haggling about\r\nthe rent and some questioning about the post service--an important\r\nmatter in view of the many negotiations with publishers, in all of\r\nwhich Schindler was depended on--but eventually all was arranged.\r\nIll health marred the Hetzendorf sojourn. Beethoven’s other ailments\r\nwere augmented by a painful affection of the eyes which called for\r\nmedical treatment, retarded his work and caused him no small amount of\r\nanxiety. Complaints on this score began in April and were continued\r\nthrough July, on the 15th of which month he writes to the Archduke, “My\r\neyes are better, but improvement is slow. It would be more rapid if\r\nI were not obliged to use glasses; it is an unfortunate circumstance\r\nwhich delays me in everything”; and later, when on a short visit to\r\nVienna: “I have just heard here that Y. I. H. is coming to-morrow. If\r\nI cannot obey the wishes of my heart, please ascribe it to my eyes.\r\nThey are much better, but I must not breathe the town air for many\r\nmore days, for it would have ill effects on my eyes.” In August, very\r\nshortly before his departure for Baden: “I am feeling really badly,\r\nnot my eyes alone. I purpose to drag myself to Baden to-morrow to take\r\nlodgings and in a few days will have to go there to stay. The town air\r\nhas an injurious effect on my entire organization and I hurt myself\r\nby going twice to my physicians in the city.” From Baden on the 22nd\r\nhe complains of a catarrhal affection, the misery in his bowels and\r\nthe trouble with his eyes, but adds: “Thank God, the eyes are so much\r\nimproved that I can again use them considerably in the daytime. Things\r\nare going better also with my other ailments; more could not be asked\r\nin this short time.”\r\n\r\nAmong the cheering incidents of the summer were the reports which\r\nreached him of the production of “Fidelio” under the direction of Weber\r\nin Dresden. Weber opened a correspondence on January 28 and continued\r\nit with letters dated February 18, April 7 and June 5; Beethoven’s\r\nanswers were dated February 16, April 10 and June 9. Most unfortunately\r\nall these letters have disappeared, and the only hints we have as to\r\ntheir contents are from the draft for Weber’s first communication\r\ndiscovered among the papers of the writer:\r\n\r\n    “Fidelio.” To Beethoven. The performance in Prague under my\r\n    direction of this mighty work, which bears testimony to German\r\n    grandeur and depth of feeling, gave me an intimacy, as inspiring\r\n    as it was instructive, with the essence through which I hope to\r\n    present it to the public in its complete effectiveness here, where\r\n    I have all possible means at my command. Every representation will\r\n    be a festival day on which I shall be privileged to offer to your\r\n    exalted mind the homage which lives in my heart, where reverence\r\n    and love for you struggle with each other.\r\n\r\nWeber had received the score of the opera on April 10 from Beethoven,\r\nwho had to borrow it from the Kärnthnerthor Theatre, whose musical\r\narchives were in the care of Count Gallenberg. Through Schindler,\r\nGallenberg sent word to Beethoven that he would send the score,\r\nprovided two copies were on hand; if not, he would have a copy made.\r\nSchindler, reporting the message to Beethoven, adds that Gallenberg had\r\nsaid he thought Beethoven himself had the score: “But when I assured\r\nhim that you did not have it he said that its loss was a consequence\r\nof your irregularity and many changes of lodgings.”[94] Nevertheless,\r\nWeber got the score and after fourteen rehearsals the representation\r\ntook place with great success. Von Könneritz, Director-General of the\r\nRoyal Chapel, reported the triumph to Beethoven and sent Beethoven a\r\nfee of 40 ducats. Beethoven in acknowledging receipt on July 17 is\r\nemboldened “by the account which my dear friend Maria Weber gives me\r\nof the admirable and noble motives of Your Excellency” to ask his\r\nintercession with the Saxon court in behalf of the Mass in D, as has\r\nalready been recorded in this chapter.\r\n\r\nA number of incidents may now hurriedly be marshalled. In 1822 the\r\nRoyal Academy of Music of Sweden had elected Beethoven to foreign\r\nmembership. The consent of the Austrian government was necessary to\r\nhis acceptance of the honor and this seems to have been deferred an\r\nunconscionably long time; at least Beethoven’s letters to the Academy\r\nand to King Charles XIV (whom as General Bernadotte, then French\r\nambassador at Vienna, he had known 25 years before) are dated March\r\n1, 1823. When permission came he wrote notes to the editors of the\r\nnewspapers “Beobachter” and “Wiener Zeitschrift,” asking them to\r\nannounce the fact of his election--a circumstance which shows that\r\nhe was not always as indifferent to distinctions of all kinds as he\r\nprofessed occasionally. Franz Schoberlechner, a young pianist, appealed\r\nto him for letters of recommendation to be used on a concert-tour. The\r\nletter reached Beethoven through Schindler, to whom he returned it with\r\nthe curt indorsement: “A capable fellow has no need of recommendation\r\nother than from one good house to another.” Schindler importuned him\r\nagain, and Beethoven wrote to him somewhat testily: “It must be plain\r\nto you that I do not want to have anything to do with this matter.\r\nAs for ‘being noble’ I think I have shown you sufficiently that I am\r\nthat on principle; I even think that you must have observed that I\r\nhave never been otherwise. _Sapienti sat._” That ended the matter;\r\nbut when Chapelmaster Dreschler of the Josephstadt Theatre became a\r\ncandidate for the post of second court organist, Beethoven recommended\r\nhim enthusiastically to Archduke Rudolph, whom in a second letter he\r\nurged to remain firm notwithstanding that Abbé Stadler had presented\r\nanother candidate. Archduke Rudolph spoke to the emperor and Count\r\nDietrichstein in favor of Drechsler, but in vain. In his letters\r\nBeethoven referred to a canon, “Grossen Dank,” which he said he had\r\nwritten for the Archduke and which he intended to hand him in person.\r\nSketches for it have been found among those for the third movement of\r\nthe Ninth Symphony, but nothing has yet been heard of the completed\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TROUBLES WITH A COUNTRY LANDLORD]\r\n\r\nBeethoven’s domestic affairs continued to plague him. While at\r\nHetzendorf he had the services of a housekeeper whom he described as\r\n“the swift-sailing frigate” Frau Schnaps, in letters to Schindler. He\r\nhas no end of trouble about his town lodging in the Kothgasse where\r\nSchindler was living, and must needs take time to write long letters to\r\nhis factotum on the subject. Here is one sent from Hetzendorf on July 2:\r\n\r\n    The continued brutality of the landlord, from the beginning as\r\n    long as I have been in the house, calls for the help of the R.\r\n    I. Police. Go to them direct. As regards the storm-window, the\r\n    housekeeper was ordered to look after it and particularly after\r\n    the recent severe rain-storm to see if it was necessary to prevent\r\n    rain from entering the room; but she found that it had neither\r\n    rained in nor could rain in. Believing this, I put on the lock so\r\n    that the brutal fellow could not open my room in my absence as he\r\n    threatened to do. Tell them further how he behaved towards you and\r\n    that he put up the bill without notice, which he has no right to do\r\n    before St. James’s day.--He has also refused to give me a receipt\r\n    from St. George’s to St. James’ as this paper shows because of the\r\n    demand that I pay a charge for lighting of which I knew nothing.\r\n    This abominable lodging _without a stove-flue_ and with the most\r\n    wretched sort of main chimney has cost me at least 259 florins W.\r\n    W. for extra expenses above the rent in order to make it habitable\r\n    while I was there in the winter. It was an intentional cheat,\r\n    inasmuch as I never saw the lodgings in the first storey but only\r\n    in the second, for which reason many objectionable things remained\r\n    unknown to me. I can not comprehend how it is possible that so\r\n    _shameful a chimney, ruinous to human health, can be tolerated by\r\n    the government_. You remember how the walls of your room looked\r\n    because of smoke, how much it cost to get rid of some but not all\r\n    of the nuisance. The chief thing now is that he be commanded to\r\n    take down the notice and to give me the receipt for the rent paid\r\n    at any rate. I never had that wretched lighting, but had other\r\n    large expenses in order to make life endurable in this lodging. My\r\n    sore eyes can not yet stand the town air, otherwise I would myself\r\n    go to the imperial police.\r\n\r\nSchindler obeyed instructions; the police director, Ungermann, sent\r\nhis compliments to Beethoven, told him that his wishes were all\r\ngranted in advance but advised him to pay the 6 florins for lighting\r\nto prevent a scoundrelly landlord from having any kind of hold upon\r\nhim--and Schindler got well scolded for his pains! How could he accept\r\nsomething-or-other from such a churl accompanied by a threat? Where was\r\nhis judgment? Where he always kept it, of course! The bill came down,\r\nbut Beethoven did not keep the lodging.\r\n\r\nBeethoven’s nephew Karl pursued his studies at Blöchlinger’s\r\nInstitute till in August and then spent his vacation with his uncle\r\nin Baden. He made himself useful as amanuensis and otherwise, and\r\nhis words are occasionally found among the notes of conversation.\r\nHis mother remains in the background for the time being, which\r\nis providential, for Beethoven has trouble enough with his other\r\ndelectable sister-in-law, the wife of Johann, whose conduct reaches\r\nthe extreme of reprehensibleness in the summer of 1823, during a spell\r\nof sickness which threw her husband on his back. The woman chose this\r\ntime to receive her lover in her house and to make a shameless public\r\nparade of her moral laxness. The step-daughter was no less neglectful\r\nof her filial duties. Accounts of his sister-in-law’s misconduct\r\nreached Beethoven’s ears from various quarters and he was frank in his\r\ndenunciation of her to his brother and only a little more plain-spoken\r\nthan Schindler, who was asked by Beethoven to lay the matter before the\r\npolice, but managed to postpone that step for the time being.[95]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AUTOGRAPHED SHUTTERS IN DEMAND]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Beethoven was hard at work on the Ninth Symphony. It was so\r\never-present with him that there was neither paradox nor hyperbole in\r\nhis words: “I am never alone when I am alone.” He had much to irritate\r\nhim while sketches and drafts of the symphony were piling up before\r\nhim in August, and finally, if Schindler is to be believed, he could\r\nno longer endure the obsequious bows with which his landlord, Baron\r\nPronay, always greeted him, and resolved to abandon the pretty villa\r\nat Hetzendorf and go to Baden. He may have formed the plan earlier in\r\nthe year--probably had--but the baron’s excessive politeness helped\r\nto turn his departure into something like a bolt. He went to Baden on\r\na house-hunting expedition with Schindler, and returning, sent his\r\n“swift-sailing frigate” to Schindler with a billet commanding him to\r\nbe up and off at 5 o’clock in the morning “_presto prestissimo_.” He\r\nknew only one lodging in Baden suited to his requirements--the one\r\nwhich he had occupied in 1822--but the owner refused to let him have it\r\nagain. This owner was a locksmith. To him Schindler was sent. In the\r\nname of his master he made all manner of humble promises concerning\r\nmore orderly conduct and consideration for the other tenants, but the\r\nplea was rejected. A second appeal was made and now the houseowner\r\nrelented, but made it a condition that Beethoven replace the\r\nwindow-shutters which had been removed. Beethoven was the more willing\r\nto do this, since he thought it necessary for the sake of his eyes.\r\nThe landlord had not divulged the reason for his demand. Beethoven was\r\nin the habit of scrawling all kinds of memoranda on his shutters in\r\nleadpencil--accounts, musical themes, etc. A family from North Germany\r\nhad noticed this in the previous year and on Beethoven’s departure had\r\nbought one of the shutters as a curiosity. The thrifty locksmith had an\r\neye for business and disposed of the remaining shutters to other summer\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\nBeethoven had arrived in Baden on August 13 with the help of Schindler,\r\ntowards whom he was filled with as much gratitude as can be read in the\r\nfollowing remarks from two letters to his nephew dated August 16 and 23:\r\n\r\n    My ruined belly must be restored by medicine and diet, and this I\r\n    owe to the _faithful messenger_! You can imagine how I am racing\r\n    about, for only to-day did I really begin my service to the muses;\r\n    I _must_, though that is not noticeable, for the baths invite me at\r\n    least to the enjoyment of beautiful nature, but _nous sommes trop\r\n    pauvre et il faut écrire ou de n’avoir pas de quoi_.\r\n\r\n    He (Schindler) was with me only a day here to take a lodging,\r\n    as you know; slept in Hetzendorf, and as he said, went back to\r\n    Josephstadt in the morning. Do not get to gossipping against him.\r\n    It might work him injury, and is he not already sufficiently\r\n    punished? Being what he is, it is necessary plainly to tell him\r\n    the truth, for his evil character which is prone to trickery needs\r\n    to be handled seriously.\r\n\r\nBeethoven’s unamiable mood, which finds copious expression in abuse of\r\nSchindler at this juncture, has some explanation (also extenuation, if\r\nthat is necessary) in the rage and humiliation with which contemplation\r\nof his brother’s domestic affairs filled him. Johann was convalescing\r\nand wrote a letter to the composer which occasioned the following\r\noutburst under date of August 13:\r\n\r\n    Dear Brother:\r\n\r\n    I am rejoiced at your better health. As regards myself, my eyes\r\n    are not entirely recovered and I came here with a disordered\r\n    stomach and a frightful catarrh, the first due to the arch-pig of\r\n    a housekeeper, the second to a beast of a kitchen-maid whom I have\r\n    once driven away but whom the other took back. _You ought not to\r\n    have gone to Steiner_; I will see what can be done. It will be\r\n    difficult to do anything with the songs _in puris_ as their texts\r\n    are German; more likely with the overture.\r\n\r\n    I received your letter of the 10th at the hands of the miserable\r\n    scoundrel Schindler. You need only to give your letters directly\r\n    to the post, I am certain to receive them, for I avoid this mean\r\n    and contemptible fellow as much as possible. Karl can not come to\r\n    me before the 29th of this month when he will write you. You can\r\n    not well be wholly unadvised as to what the two _canailles_, Lump\r\n    and Bastard,[96] are doing to you, and you have had letters on the\r\n    subject from me and Karl, for, little as you deserve it I shall\r\n    never forget that you are my brother, and a good angel will yet\r\n    come to rid you of these two _canailles_. This former and present\r\n    strumpet who received visits from her fellow no less than three\r\n    times while you were ill, and who in addition to everything else\r\n    has your money wholly in her hands. O infamous disgrace! Isn’t\r\n    there a spark of manhood in you?!!!... About coming to you I will\r\n    write another time. Ought I so to _degrade_ myself as to associate\r\n    with such bad company? Mayhap this can be avoided and we yet pass\r\n    a few days with you. About the rest of your letter another time.\r\n    Farewell. Unseen I hover over you and work through others so that\r\n    these _canailles_ shall not strangle you.\r\n\r\n  As always your faithful\r\n  Brother.\r\n\r\nThere were several visitors to Beethoven at Baden in the summer of 1823\r\nwho have left accounts of their experiences. One was an Englishman,\r\nEdward Schulz, who published his story in the “Harmonicon” in January\r\n1824. This extremely lively letter was reprinted by Moscheles in\r\nhis translation (or rather, adaptation) of Schindler’s biography\r\nof Beethoven and incorporated in the second German edition, where\r\nSchindler accompanies it with several illuminative glosses which are\r\nless necessary now than they were when the biographer wrote. Schulz\r\nvisited Beethoven on September 28 in the company of Haslinger. He\r\ndescribes it as a _dies faustus_ for him and, as Schindler shrewdly\r\nobserves, it must also have been one for Beethoven, since he managed\r\nto hear the conversation of his visitors without the aid of an\r\near-trumpet. He talked with great animation, as was his wont when in\r\ngood humor, but, says the English visitor, “one unlucky question, one\r\nill-judged piece of advice--for instance, concerning the cure of his\r\ndeafness--is quite sufficient to estrange him from you forever.” He\r\nasked Haslinger about the highest possible note on the trombone, but\r\nwas dissatisfied with the answer which he received; introduced his\r\nnephew and showed his pride in the youth’s attainments by telling his\r\nguest that he might put to him “a riddle in Greek” if he liked. At\r\ndinner during a visit to the Helenenthal he commented on the profusion\r\nof provisions at dinner, saying: “Why such a variety of dishes? Man is\r\nbut little above other animals if his chief pleasure is confined to a\r\ndinner-table.” A few excerpts from the letter will serve to advance the\r\npresent narrative:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEETHOVEN’S TRIBUTE TO HANDEL]\r\n\r\n    In the whole course of our table-talk there was nothing so\r\n    interesting as what he said about Handel. I sat close by him\r\n    and heard him assert very distinctly in German, “Handel is the\r\n    greatest composer that ever lived.” I can not describe to you\r\n    with what pathos, and I am inclined to say, with what sublimity\r\n    of language, he spoke of the “Messiah” of this immortal genius.\r\n    Every one of us was moved when he said, “I would uncover my head,\r\n    and kneel down at his tomb!” H. and I tried repeatedly to turn the\r\n    conversation to Mozart, but without effect. I only heard him say,\r\n    “In a monarchy we know who is the first”; which might or might\r\n    not apply to the subject.... He is engaged in writing a new opera\r\n    called “Melusine,” the words by the famous but unfortunate poet\r\n    Grillparzer. He concerns himself but very little about the newest\r\n    productions of living composers, insomuch, that when I asked about\r\n    the “Freischütz,” he replied, “I believe _one_ Weber has written\r\n    it”.... He appears uniformly to entertain the most favorable\r\n    opinion of the British nation. “I like,” said he, “the noble\r\n    simplicity of the English manners,” and added other praises. It\r\n    seemed to me as if he had yet some hopes of visiting this country\r\n    together with his nephew. I should not forget to mention that I\r\n    heard a MS. trio of his for the pianoforte, violin and violoncello,\r\n    which I thought very beautiful, and as, I understood, to appear\r\n    shortly in London.\r\n\r\nOur author’s statement that he heard a manuscript pianoforte trio at\r\nthis time piques curiosity. Schindler disposes of the question as to\r\nwhat it may have been in the manner more characteristic of the present\r\nthan the past attitude of German writers towards everything English or\r\nAmerican. “Who knows what it was that the non-musical gentleman took\r\nfor a trio?” he asks. Evidently Schindler was of the opinion that no\r\nEnglishman except, possibly, a professional musician, could count\r\nthree or recognize the employment of pianoforte, violin and violoncello\r\nin a piece of music. He is right in scouting the idea that it could\r\nhave been the great Trio in B-flat, for that work had long been in\r\nprint. Nor is it likely to have been the little trio in the same key\r\ndedicated to Maximiliane Brentano; for though that was not published\r\nat the time, it is not likely that Beethoven would produce it in 1823\r\nas a novelty. There are in existence sketches for a Trio in F minor\r\nmade in 1815, but nothing to show that the work was ever written out.\r\nHad it been in Beethoven’s hands at a time when he was turning over\r\nthe manuscripts of earlier days, it would surely have been offered to\r\na publisher; so that is out of the way. There is only one other known\r\nwork which invites speculation--the “Adagio, Variations and Rondo,”\r\nfor pianoforte, violin and violoncello, which Steiner and Co. gave to\r\nthe public in 1824, as Op. 121. The variations are on a melody from\r\nWenzel Müller’s opera “Die Schwestern aus Prag” (“Ich bin der Schneider\r\nKakadu”). It is at least remotely possible that this was the trio which\r\nthe English traveller heard, and if so we have in the fact a hint as to\r\nthe time of its origin--the only hint yet given.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VON WEBER’S VISIT TO BEETHOVEN]\r\n\r\nA few days after the one just recorded Beethoven received a visit\r\nfrom a man of much greater moment than the English traveller. The new\r\nvisitor was Carl Maria von Weber. That the composer of “Der Freischütz”\r\nwas unable in his salad days to appreciate the individuality of\r\nBeethoven’s genius has already been set forth; and the author of the\r\nletter in the “Harmonicon” seems to have learned that Beethoven was\r\ndisposed to speak lightly of Weber only a month before he received\r\nhim with most amiable distinction at Baden. Schindler’s explanation,\r\nthat a memory of Weber’s criticism of the Fourth Symphony may at the\r\nmoment have risen, ghost-like, in Beethoven’s mind and prompted the\r\ndisparaging allusion quoted by Schulz, is far-fetched. It is not\r\nnecessary to account for such moody remarks in Beethoven’s case. He was\r\noften unjust in his comments on even his most devoted friends, and we\r\nmay believe that to Schulz he did speak of the composer as “one Weber,”\r\nand at the same time accept the account which Max Maria von Weber gives\r\nof the reception of his father by Beethoven. From the affectionate\r\nbiography written by the son, we learn that after the sensational\r\nsuccess achieved by “Der Freischütz” Beethoven was led to study its\r\nscore and that he was so astonished at the originality of the music\r\nthat he struck the book with his hand and exclaimed: “I never would\r\nhave thought it of the gentle little man (_sonst weiche Männel_). Now\r\nWeber must write operas; nothing but operas--one after the other and\r\nwithout polishing them too much. _Casper_, the monster, stands out here\r\nlike a house. Wherever the devil puts in his claws they are felt.” He\r\nlearned to know “Euryanthe” later and was less impressed by it than\r\nby its predecessor. After glancing through it hurriedly he remarked:\r\n“The man has taken too much pains.”[97] Whatever may have been their\r\nearlier feelings and convictions, however, the representations of\r\n“Fidelio” at Prague and Dresden under the direction of Weber warmed\r\ntheir hearts towards each other. Weber’s filial biographer says that\r\nwhen the youthful sin of his father was called to the notice of\r\nBeethoven, the latter showed some resentment, but there is no shadow\r\nof this in the pictures which we have from the pens of Weber himself,\r\nMax Maria von Weber and Julius Benedict, of the meeting between the two\r\nmen. Weber had come to Vienna, bringing with him his pupil Benedict,\r\nto conduct the first performance of “Euryanthe.” On his visit in the\r\nprevious year, when “Der Freischütz” was produced, he had neglected\r\nto call on Beethoven, but now some kindly words about “Euryanthe”\r\nspoken by Beethoven to Steiner being repeated to him, he made good his\r\ndereliction and, announced by Haslinger, drove out to Baden to pay his\r\nrespects. In his diary Weber noted the visit thus: “The 5th, Sunday\r\n(October, 1823), at 8 o’clock, drove with Burger (Piringer), Haslinger\r\nand Benedict to Baden; abominable weather; Saw spring and baths; to\r\nDuport and _Beethoven_; received by him with great cordiality. Dined\r\nwith him, his nephew and Eckschlager at the Sauerhof. Very cheerful.\r\nBack again at 5 o’clock.” On the next day (though the letter is dated\r\n“October 5”) Weber wrote an account to his wife as follows:\r\n\r\n    I was right tired but had to get up yesterday at 6 o’clock\r\n    because the excursion to Baden had been appointed for half-past 7\r\n    o’clock. This took place with Hasslinger, Piringer and Benedict;\r\n    but unfortunately the weather was atrocious. The main purpose\r\n    was to see Beethoven. He received me with an affection which was\r\n    touching; he embraced me most heartily at least six or seven times\r\n    and finally exclaimed enthusiastically: “Indeed, you’re a devil\r\n    of a fellow!--a good fellow!” We spent the afternoon very merrily\r\n    and contentedly. This rough, repellant man actually paid court to\r\n    me, served me at table as if I had been his lady. In short, this\r\n    day will always remain remarkable in my memory as well as of those\r\n    present. It was uplifting for me to be overwhelmed with such loving\r\n    attention by this great genius. How saddening is his deafness!\r\n    Everything must be written down for him. We inspected the baths,\r\n    drank the waters, and at 5 o’clock drove back to Vienna.\r\n\r\nMax Maria von Weber in his account of the incident says that Beethoven,\r\nin the conversation which followed his greeting of the “devil of\r\na fellow,” railed at the management of the theatre, the concert\r\nimpresarios, the public, the Italians, the taste of the people,\r\nand particularly at the ingratitude of his nephew. Weber, who was\r\ndeeply moved, advised him to tear himself away from his discouraging\r\nenvironment and make an artistic tour through Germany, which would show\r\nhim what the world thought of him. “Too late!” exclaimed Beethoven,\r\nshaking his head and going through the motions of playing the\r\npianoforte. “Then go to England, where you are admired,” wrote Weber.\r\n“Too late!” cried Beethoven, drew Weber’s arm into his and dragged him\r\nalong to the Sauerhof, where they dined. At parting, Beethoven embraced\r\nand kissed him several times and cried: “Good luck to the new opera; if\r\nI can I’ll come to the first performance.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SIR JULIUS BENEDICT’S RECORD]\r\n\r\nA generation later Sir Julius Benedict, who had also put his memory\r\nof those Vienna days at the service of Weber’s son, wrote down his\r\nrecollections for his work in these words:\r\n\r\n    I endeavor, as I promised you, to recall the impressions I received\r\n    of Beethoven when I first met him in Vienna in October, 1823. He\r\n    then lived at Baden; but regularly, once a week, he came to the\r\n    city and he never failed to call on his old friends Steiner and\r\n    Haslinger, whose music-store was then in the Paternostergässchen, a\r\n    little street, no longer in existence, between the Graben and the\r\n    Kohlmarkt.\r\n\r\n    If I am not mistaken, on the morning that I saw Beethoven for\r\n    the first time, Blahetka, the father of the pianist, directed\r\n    my attention to a stout, short man with a very red face, small,\r\n    piercing eyes, and bushy eyebrows, dressed in a very long overcoat\r\n    which reached nearly to his ankles, who entered the shop about 12\r\n    o’clock. Blahetka asked me: “Who do you think that is?” and I at\r\n    once exclaimed: “It must be Beethoven!” because, notwithstanding\r\n    the high color of his cheeks and his general untidiness, there was\r\n    in those small piercing eyes an expression which no painter could\r\n    render. It was a feeling of sublimity and melancholy combined. I\r\n    watched, as you can well imagine, every word that he spoke when he\r\n    took out his little book and began a conversation which to me, of\r\n    course, was almost incomprehensible, inasmuch as he only answered\r\n    questions pencilled to him by Messrs. Steiner and Haslinger. I was\r\n    not introduced to him on that occasion; but the second time, about\r\n    a week after, Mr. Steiner presented me to the great man as a pupil\r\n    of Weber. The other persons present were the old Abbé Stadler and\r\n    Seyfried. Beethoven said to Steiner: “I rejoice to hear that you\r\n    publish once more a German work. I have heard much in praise of\r\n    Weber’s opera and hope it will bring both you and him a great deal\r\n    of glory.” Upon this Steiner seized the opportunity to say: “Here\r\n    is a pupil of Weber’s”; when Beethoven most kindly offered me his\r\n    hand, saying: “Pray tell M. de Weber how happy I shall be to see\r\n    him at Baden, as I shall not come to Vienna before next month.” I\r\n    was so confused at having the great man speak to me that I hadn’t\r\n    the courage to ask any questions or continue the conversation with\r\n    him.\r\n\r\n    A few days afterwards I had the pleasure of accompanying Weber\r\n    and Haslinger with another friend to Baden, when they allowed me\r\n    the great privilege of going with them to Beethoven’s residence.\r\n    Nothing could be more cordial than his reception of my master. He\r\n    wanted to take us to the Helenenthal and to all the neighborhood;\r\n    but the weather was unfavorable, and we were obliged to renounce\r\n    this excursion. They all dined together at one table at an inn, and\r\n    I, seated at another close to them, had the pleasure of listening\r\n    to their conversation.\r\n\r\n    In the month of November, when Beethoven came to town and paid\r\n    his daily visit to the Paternostergässchen, I seldom missed the\r\n    opportunity of being one of the circle of young admirers, eager\r\n    to show their reverence to the greatest musical genius as well as\r\n    hoping to be honored by his notice. Among those whom I met upon\r\n    this errand were Carl Maria von Bocklet, his pupil, Worzischek,\r\n    Léon de St. Louvain, Mayseder, Holz, Böhm, Linke, Schuppanzigh,\r\n    Franz Schubert and Kanne.\r\n\r\n    On the morning after the first performance of “Euryanthe,” when\r\n    Steiner and Haslinger’s shop was filled with the musical and\r\n    literary authorities, Beethoven made his appearance and asked\r\n    Haslinger: “Well, how did the opera go last night?” The reply\r\n    was: “A great triumph.” “_Das freut mich, das freut mich_,” he\r\n    exclaimed, and perceiving me he said: “I should so much have liked\r\n    to go to the theatre, but,” pointing to his ears, “I go no more\r\n    to those places.” Then he asked Gottdank, the régisseur; “How did\r\n    little Sontag get on? I take a great interest in her; and how\r\n    is the book--good or bad?” Gottdank answered the first question\r\n    affirmatively, but as to the other he shrugged his shoulders and\r\n    made a negative sign, to which Beethoven replied: “Always the same\r\n    story; the Germans cannot write a good libretto.” Upon which I took\r\n    his little conversation book and wrote in it: “And ‘Fidelio’?” to\r\n    which he answered: “That is a French and Italian book.” I asked him\r\n    afterwards: “Which do you consider the best librettos?”; he replied\r\n    “‘Wasserträger’ and ‘Vestalin.’”\r\n\r\n    Further than this I cannot recall any distinct conversation,\r\n    although I often met him, and I had never the good fortune of\r\n    hearing him perform or seeing him conduct. But the wonderful\r\n    impression his first appearance made on me was heightened every\r\n    time I met him. When I saw him at Baden, his white hair flowing\r\n    over his mighty shoulders, with that wonderful look--sometimes\r\n    contracting his brows when anything afflicted him, sometimes\r\n    bursting out into a forced laughter, indescribably painful to\r\n    his listeners--I was touched as if _King Lear_ or one of the old\r\n    Gaelic bards stood before me; and when I thought how the creator\r\n    of the sublimest musical works was debarred by a cruel fate for a\r\n    great many years from the delight of hearing them performed and\r\n    appreciated I could but share the deep grief of all musical minds.\r\n\r\n    I may add that I heard the first public performance of one of his\r\n    so-called “posthumous” quartets in his own presence. Schuppanzigh\r\n    and his companions, who had been his interpreters before, were\r\n    scarcely equal to this occasion; as they did not seem to understand\r\n    the music themselves, they failed entirely to impart its meaning\r\n    to the audience. The general impression was most unsatisfactory.\r\n    Not until Ernst had completely imbued himself in the spirit of\r\n    these compositions could the world discover their long-hidden\r\n    beauties.[98]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SONGS AND MILITARY MARCHES]\r\n\r\nMadame Marie Pachler-Koschak, with whom Beethoven had spent many\r\nhappy moments in 1817, was among those who took the waters at Baden\r\nin the summer of 1823, but we are told she searched for him in vain,\r\na fact which shows in what seclusion he must have dwelt some of the\r\ntime at least. She was more fortunate when she returned in September\r\nto complete her cure; and when she left Baden she carried with her an\r\nautographic souvenir--a setting of “The beautiful to the good,” the\r\nconcluding words of Matthison’s “Opferlied” which he had in hand in\r\nthis year. Towards the close of October Beethoven returned to Vienna.\r\nWe know the date approximately from Benedict’s account, the first\r\nperformance of “Euryanthe” having taken place on October 25. He removed\r\nto new lodgings in the Ungarstrasse, where his nephew remained with him\r\nas long as he continued a student at the university. Here he worked at\r\nthe Ninth Symphony, more particularly on the last movement.\r\n\r\nThe exact chronological order in which works were taken up in 1823\r\ncannot be recorded here. Matthison’s “Opferlied” was taken up several\r\ntimes--in 1794, then in 1801 and 1802; finally in 1822 and 1823. In its\r\nlast stages he extends its dimensions, adds the refrain for chorus and\r\nan orchestral accompaniment.[99] Beethoven had offered it to Peters\r\nin February, 1823, though at that time he described its accompaniment\r\nas being for two clarinets, horn, viola and violoncello, so that the\r\nviolins and bassoon were added later. Why Peters did not publish the\r\nsong is not known; the manuscript does not seem to have been returned\r\nto Beethoven. Nottebohm concludes that two or more versions were made\r\nin 1822 and 1823 (possibly as late as 1824), and that the final form\r\nwas that known as Op. 121b. On April 9, 1825 (“Notizen,” p. 161), a\r\nletter was written to Ries which said: “You will soon receive a second\r\ncopy of the ‘Opferlied,’ which mark as corrected by me so that the one\r\nwhich you already have may not be used. Here you have an illustration\r\nof the miserable copyist whom I have, since Schlemmer died. You can\r\ndepend on scarcely a note.” A sketchbook analyzed by Nottebohm,[100]\r\nwhich contains sketches made at different times bound up with sketches\r\nfor the last quartets made in 1824, shows sketches for a pianoforte\r\nsonata for four hands, the Ninth Symphony, the Mass in C-sharp minor,\r\na fugue on B-a-c-h, and the “Bundeslied,” besides the latest form of\r\nthe “Opferlied” but not wholly like the printed edition. The impetus\r\nto the C-sharp minor mass came in 1823 and the other sketches in all\r\nlikelihood were made in the same year. It is therefore to be concluded\r\nthat he worked on the new “Opferlied” in 1823 and possibly carried it\r\nover to the early part of 1824. Beethoven owed money to his brother and\r\noffered the song as Johann’s property, in a letter of November 1824,\r\nto Schott and Sons, who published it in 1825; but he made alterations\r\nby letter as late as May 7, 1825. Schindler’s statement that the two\r\nsongs “Opferlied” and “Bundeslied” were composed to be sung by the\r\ntenor Ehlers at a benefit concert in Pressburg, is wrong. Schindler’s\r\ninexactitude as to dates is shown by his statements that the concert\r\ntook place in 1822 and the song published in 1826. The first song was\r\nwritten in the soprano clef; the second has tenor clef but two solo\r\nvoices; neither was made for Ehlers. As to the “Bundeslied” (words by\r\nGoethe) so far as the history of the song is concerned, the documentary\r\nevidence is found in the sketchbook just mentioned; whether or not it\r\nhad its origin at an earlier date has not been ascertained,[101] but\r\nreceived alterations later. It, too, was published by Schott in 1825.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MINOR COMPOSITIONS OF THE YEAR 1823]\r\n\r\nBesides these songs, and the Bagatelles mentioned in the letter of\r\nFebruary, 1823, as sent to Peters, there are several other minor\r\ncompositions which may well be discussed here. The Tattoo with\r\npercussive instruments (Turkish music), the two other Tattoos and a\r\nMarch, were all old compositions. Up to 1874, when the letter was\r\nmade public, only one of the Tattoos had been printed. It was that\r\nin F major, which, according to the autograph preserved by Artaria,\r\nwas composed for the Bohemian _Landwehr_ in 1809 and then designated\r\nas March No. 1. A copy more fully orchestrated than it is in the\r\nprinted form was dedicated to Prince Anton in that year.[102] A second\r\nautograph of later date (also in Artaria’s collection) is entitled\r\n“Zapfenstreich No. 1.” Here the march had a trio which has not become\r\nknown. It was then, together with the one that follows, rewritten for\r\nthe tournament at Laxenburg held in honor of the birthday of Empress\r\nMaria Ludovica on August 25, 1810, and this version has been printed\r\nin the Complete Edition of Beethoven’s works.[103] In the earliest\r\nprint by Schlesinger it is number 37 in a collection of “Quick-steps\r\nfor the Prussian Army. For the York Corps”; but Nottebohm says that\r\nthe version does not agree with any of the manuscripts mentioned.\r\nSimultaneously with this march another was published which was composed\r\nin 1810 for Archduke Anton. An autograph at Haslinger’s bears the\r\ninscription “Zapfenstreich No. 3,” and below it “One step to each\r\nmeasure.” A copy in the archives of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde\r\nis inscribed “March for H. I. Highness, the Archduke Anton, by Ludwig\r\nvan Beethoven, 1810 on the 3rd of the Summermonth” (i. e., June). A\r\nthird form was prepared for the tournament of 1810, and this has been\r\npublished. Artaria had a “Trio No. 3” in F minor, 6-4 time. This is\r\nfollowed in the “Gesammt-Ausgabe” by a third in C major with a trio\r\nin F major, which was published from a copy made by Nottebohm. This,\r\nwhich has been published by Haslinger, Steger, and Liszt and Franke,\r\nwas entitled “Zapfenstreich No. 2.” In Nottebohm’s opinion it belongs\r\nto the two others and like them had its origin between 1809 and June\r\n1810. These were the three Tattoos which Beethoven sent to Peters,\r\nwho, however, did not publish them. The fourth March was the Military\r\nMarch in D major composed in 1816.[104] It was first published in\r\n1827, after Beethoven’s death, in an arrangement for pianoforte, by\r\nCappi and Czerny; a four-hand arrangement followed soon after and it\r\nwas given to the world in its original shape in the Complete Edition.\r\nIt was composed at the personal request of F. X. Embel, “Magisterial\r\nCouncillor and Lieut.-Colonel of the Civil Artillery,” who probably\r\npreferred his request in 1815, a sketch for it appearing in a book\r\nused in 1815-1816.--The data concerning these old works are given here\r\nbecause Beethoven brought them out of his portfolio and offered them to\r\nthe publishers in this year.\r\n\r\nThe Bagatelles, Op. 126, belong to this period, though their completion\r\nfell later. Taking up earlier sketches probably, Beethoven worked on\r\nthem after the Ninth Symphony was practically complete in his mind and\r\nthe sketchbooks--at the close of 1823 at the earliest. It is likely\r\nthat they were not finished until the middle of 1824. Nottebohm had\r\nsubjected them to a minute study which leads him to the conclusion that\r\nthe pieces were conceived as a homogeneous series, the numbers being\r\nlinked together by key-relationship. On the margin of a sketch for the\r\nfirst one Beethoven wrote “Cycle of Trifles” (“Kleinigkeiten”), which\r\nfact, their separation from each other (all but the first two) by the\r\nuniform distance of a major third, taken in connection with their unity\r\nof style, establishes a cyclical bond. When he offered them to Schott\r\nin 1824 he remarked that they were probably the best things of the\r\nkind which he had ever written. They were among the compositions which\r\nhad been pledged to his brother, in whose interest he offered them to\r\nSchott. They were published by that firm, probably in the early part of\r\n1825.\r\n\r\nIn 1828 Diabelli and Co. published a “Rondo a Capriccio” in G which\r\nhad been purchased at the auction sale of Beethoven’s effects after\r\nhis death. It bore on its title-page the inscription: “Die Wuth über\r\nden Verlornen Groschen, ausgetobt in einer Caprice” (“Rage at the\r\nloss of a groat stormed out in a Caprice”). Nothing is known of its\r\norigin. In the catalogue of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, Czerny\r\nnoted it as belonging to Beethoven’s youthful period; which may be\r\ntrue of its theme, but can not be of its treatment. Among the sketches\r\nand drafts for the Bagatelles is a sketch for an arch and mischievous\r\npiece evidently intended for strings,[105] and a two-part canon on the\r\nwords “Te solo adoro” from Metastasio’s “Betulia liberata,” which, as\r\ntranscribed by Nottebohm, has been printed in the Complete Edition.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[68] In a Conversation Book of 1820 we read this remark by Beethoven:\r\n“What I think of confession may be deduced from the fact that I myself\r\nled Karl to the Abbot of St. Michael for confession. But the abbot\r\ndeclared that as long as he had to visit his mother, confession would\r\nbe of no avail.”\r\n\r\n[69] In Vol. IV of the German edition of this biography, Dr. Deiters\r\npresents a long and extremely interesting descriptive and critical\r\nanalysis of the mass from the point of view held by a devout\r\nRoman Catholic churchman; wherefore, in spite of his enthusiastic\r\nappreciation of the music, he is obliged to point out its departure\r\nfrom some of the dogmas of the church, as well as the rubrics which the\r\ncomposers had long disregarded. All this is, however, far outside the\r\nscope of this biography as originally conceived by Thayer and to which\r\nthe editor has sought to bring it back in this English edition.\r\n\r\n[70] These pieces, we learn later, were to be an offertory, a graduale\r\nand a _Tantum ergo_.\r\n\r\n[71] Beethoven’s mind reverts to the choral movement of the Ninth\r\nSymphony which is occupying him.\r\n\r\n[72] Were it not for the very general confusion which still exists\r\ntouching musical terms, it might be set down as a bit singular that\r\nneither Beethoven nor Schindler seems to have known that the French\r\nequivalent of “oratorio” is “oratorio,” and nothing else. The letter,\r\nhowever, reads: _elle se prète de même a etre executée en Oratoire_. In\r\nFrance an _oratoire_ is still an oratory, a room for prayer.\r\n\r\n[73] The blanks were filled according to the formula.\r\n\r\n[74] “Papageno” was the name applied to Schindler in his notes when\r\nBeethoven wished to enjoin silence on his factotum; the allusion, of\r\ncourse, being to the lip-locked bird-catcher in Mozart’s “Magic Flute.”\r\n\r\n[75] If this note refers to the Mass, Schindler’s date must be a year\r\ntoo late.\r\n\r\n[76] In view of what will have to be said later about the controversy\r\nwhich raged for years after Beethoven’s death about the financial\r\ndealings between Prince Galitzin and Beethoven, it was thought best to\r\nestablish at this time the fact that Galitzin subscribed for the Mass\r\nand paid the fee in the manner which has been set forth.\r\n\r\n[77] The letter is incorrectly dated July 1, by Kalischer. Thayer’s\r\ntranscript and also one made by Dr. Kopfermann of the Royal Library at\r\nBerlin for Dr. Deiters give June as the month.\r\n\r\n[78] Beethoven had a number of nicknames for Schindler besides\r\n_Papageno_ with its various qualifications. One of these was\r\n_Lumpenkerl_; another _Hauptlumpenkerl_--Ragamuffin and Chief\r\nRagamuffin. In this instance Schindler is a “Samothracian ragamuffin”\r\nand Schindler in a gloss tells us that the allusion was to the ancient\r\nceremonies of Samothrace, Schindler being thus designated as one\r\ninitiated into the mysteries of Beethoven’s affairs and purposes. The\r\ninjunction of silence was understood, of course. Count Brunswick, Count\r\nLichnowsky and Zmeskall were also initiates. Wocher, to whom Beethoven\r\nsends his compliments, was Prince Esterhazy’s courier. Beethoven’s\r\nsecond thoughts seem frequently to have been bestowed on the trombones.\r\nWe have already seen how often this was the case in the alterations in\r\nthe Mass in D. An interesting illustration was found by the present\r\neditor among Thayer’s papers. The biographer owned a sheet of four\r\npages containing, in Beethoven’s handwriting, the trombone parts of\r\nthe Trio in the Scherzo of the Ninth Symphony with instructions to the\r\ncopyist where they were to be introduced. As the trombones do not take\r\npart in the first and third movements nor in the Scherzo outside of the\r\nTrio, but are highly important in the choral Finale, it would seem as\r\nif Beethoven had thought of the beautiful effect which they produce in\r\nthe Trio after he had decided that they were necessary in the Finale.\r\n\r\n[79] In Hetzendorf, while the negotiations with the courts are pending,\r\nCount Moritz Lichnowsky writes in a Conversation Book: “Can you not\r\nsell the Mass to publishers next year, so that it may become publicly\r\nuseful?”\r\n\r\n[80] “The Philharmonic Society of London,” by George Hogarth, London,\r\n1862, page 31.\r\n\r\n[81] _Sic._ Beethoven of course means the Embassy. The Overture was no\r\ndoubt that to “The Consecration of the House,” Op. 124.\r\n\r\n[82] Bauer was in Beethoven’s company a short time before he went to\r\nEngland, and the incident of the sending of the score of “Wellington’s\r\nVictory, or the Battle of Vittoria” came up for conversation between\r\nthem. We read in a Conversation Book, in Bauer’s hand: “I am of the\r\nopinion that the King had it performed, but perhaps nobody reminded him\r\nthat on that account he ought to answer. I will carry a letter to the\r\nKing and direct it in a channel which will insure its delivery, since I\r\ncannot hand it over in person.” The story of King George’s action, or\r\nwant of action, has been told in earlier pages of this work. From the\r\nopening phrase of the address to the King it is fair to surmise that it\r\nwas to follow an invitation to subscribe for the Mass in D, and from\r\nthe letter to Ries that Beethoven subsequently decided to strike the\r\nKing of England from his list.\r\n\r\n[83] In his letter to Zelter, Beethoven says that one of the numbers of\r\nthe Mass was without accompaniment. There being no _a cappella_ setting\r\nof any section of the missal text in the Mass in D, it is likely that\r\nBeethoven here, too, had the three additional pieces in mind. For this\r\nspeculation, however, as well as the hypothesis that the settings\r\noriginally contemplated for the “second” mass in C-sharp minor were\r\ntransferred to the scheme of the _Missa Solemnis_, the present editor\r\nis alone responsible. In a Conversation Book of 1823 an unidentified\r\nfriend answers several questions about the hymn “Tantum ergo” and its\r\nintroduction in the service.\r\n\r\n[84] Schindler bases his statements on alleged testimony of the\r\nArchduke’s secretary Baumeister, but there is no word of reproval in\r\nany of the letters of the two men which have been found.\r\n\r\n[85] Sporchil’s drama bore the title “The Apotheosis in the Temple of\r\nJupiter Ammon.” What it had to do with the new operatic project is not\r\nplain to this editor, for it was but a new text to be used to the music\r\nof “The Ruins of Athens.” Beethoven once described “The Ruins” as “a\r\nlittle opera” and his abiding and continued interest in it is disclosed\r\nby the fact that after he got into touch with Grillparzer he discussed\r\nthe possibility of its revival with that poet.\r\n\r\n[86] Grillparzer’s “Werke,” Vol. XVI, p. 228 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[87] Thayer saw Grillparzer on July 4, 1860, and got from him a\r\nconfirmation of both incidents here narrated.\r\n\r\n[88] The concluding paragraph of the letter betrays his growing\r\nantipathy towards Schindler: “Afternoons you will find me in the\r\ncoffee-house opposite the ‘Goldene Birne.’ If you want to come, please\r\ncome alone. This importunate appendix of a Schindler, as you must\r\nhave noticed in Hetzendorf, has long been extremely objectionable to\r\nme--_otium est citium_.”\r\n\r\n[89] Thayer copies the entry found in the Conversation Book, but doubts\r\nif the handwriting is that of Liszt _fils_. It is as follows: “I have\r\noften expressed the wish to Herr von Schindler to make your high\r\nacquaintance and am rejoiced to be able now to do so. As I shall give a\r\nconcert on Sunday the 13th I most humbly beg you to give me your high\r\npresence.” The courtly language suggests the thought that the father\r\nmay have written the words for the boy.\r\n\r\n[90] “Beethoven, Liszt und Wagner,” p. 199.\r\n\r\n[91] In view of the fact that Beethoven would not have been able to\r\nhear a note of the music had he been present and that, unless deeply\r\nmoved, he would not have made a public exhibition of his feelings,\r\nand that even Schindler does not seem to have heard of the story of\r\nthe kiss, it is very likely, in the opinion of the present editor,\r\nthat the whole story is a canard invented for advertising purposes.\r\nThayer’s note on the copy which he made of the conversation at the\r\ntime of the presentation of the lad is: “B. does not appear to have\r\nattended the concert, as some one reports to him that he ‘improvised on\r\na Hungarian-German theme.’” But there are several versions of the story\r\n(see Frimmel, “Bausteine, etc.,” p 91) and Beethoven may at another\r\ntime have kissed the boy.\r\n\r\n[92] Nohl is mistaken in saying that the canon was written in\r\nSchloesser’s album. It is printed in the B. and H. “Ges. Ausg.,” Series\r\nXXIII, No. 256.\r\n\r\n[93] A _Schusterfleck_, that is a cobble, or cobbler’s patch, like\r\n_Vetter Michel_ and _Rosalia_ in the musical terminology of Germany, is\r\na tune largely made up of repetitions on different degrees of the scale\r\nof a single figure or motive.\r\n\r\n[94] See the conversation, Vol. I, p. 321.\r\n\r\n[95] Here are a few extracts from a letter written to Beethoven on July\r\n3, 1823: “As I have been visiting him (Johann) three to four times a\r\nday ever since he took to his bed, and have entertained him by the\r\nhour, I have had an opportunity carefully to observe these two persons;\r\nhence I can assure you on my honor that, despite your venerable name,\r\nthey deserve to be shut up, the old one in prison, the young one in\r\nthe house of correction.... This illness came opportunely for both of\r\nthem, to enable them to go their ways without trammel. These beasts\r\nwould have let him rot if others had not taken pity on him. He might\r\nhave died a hundred times without the one in the Prater or at Nussdorf\r\nthe other at the baker’s deigning to give him a look.... He often wept\r\nover the conduct of his family and once he gave way completely to his\r\ngrief and begged me to let you know how he is being treated so that you\r\nmight come and give the two the beating they deserve.... It is most\r\nunnatural and more than barbarous if that woman, while her husband is\r\nlying ill, introduces her lover into his room, prinks herself like a\r\nsleigh-horse in his presence and then goes driving with him, leaving\r\nthe sick husband languishing at home. She did this very often. Your\r\nbrother himself called my attention to it, and is a fool for tolerating\r\nit so long.”\r\n\r\n[96] Meaning Johann’s wife and step-daughter. Very incomprehensibly\r\nKalischer thinks the _Lump_ was Schindler!\r\n\r\n[97] Schindler quotes Beethoven as remarking of “Euryanthe” that it was\r\n“an accumulation of diminished seventh-chords--all little backdoors!”\r\n\r\n[98] The Quartet which Benedict heard was that in E-flat major, Op.\r\n127, which had its performance on March 6, 1825, the year in which\r\nBenedict left Vienna with Barbaja. His letter to Thayer, therefore,\r\ncarries us far beyond the period now under discussion. The conversation\r\nabout the libretto of “Euryanthe” is said by Max Maria von Weber to\r\nhave taken place at the dinner in Baden; but Benedict’s is the likelier\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n[99] It was performed for the first time at a concert of the\r\nGesellschaft der Musikfreunde on April 4, 1824, but it had been\r\ncompleted a long time before.\r\n\r\n[100] “Zweit. Beeth.,” p. 540 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[101] Czerny wrote in the catalogue of the Gesellschaft der\r\nMusikfreunde concerning this song, the “Opferlied” and “Der Kuss,”\r\n“sketched at a very early period.” The note cannot be considered\r\nseriously, as there is nothing to show that he had any information on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n[102] See list of compositions in the chapter of this work devoted to\r\n1809.\r\n\r\n[103] B. and H., Series XXV, Nos. 120 and 287.\r\n\r\n[104] See _ante_.\r\n\r\n[105] Nottebohm’s “Zweit. Beeth.,” p. 208.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\n\r\n    The Symphony in D Minor--Its Technical History--Schiller’s “Ode to\r\n    Joy”--An Address to Beethoven--The Concerts of 1824--Laborious and\r\n    Protracted Preparations--Production of the Symphony and Mass in\r\n    D--Financial Failure--Negotiations with Publishers Resumed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Symphony in D minor, familiarly known the world over as the\r\n“Ninth,” and also as the “Choral” Symphony in England and America,\r\nwas completed in February, 1824. The conclusion of the work upon it,\r\nSchindler says, had a cheering effect upon Beethoven’s spirits. He\r\nno longer grudged himself occasional recreation and was again seen\r\nstrolling through the streets of Vienna, gazing into the shop-windows\r\nthrough eyeglasses which dangled at the end of a black ribbon, and,\r\nafter a long interregnum, greeting friends and acquaintances as they\r\npassed. The history of the work is far more interesting than that of\r\nany of his compositions, with the possible exception of the Mass in\r\nD. Nottebohm has painstakingly extracted from the sketchbooks all the\r\nevidence which they afford, touching the origin and development of the\r\nwork, and presented it in a chapter of his “Zweite Beethoveniana”;[106]\r\nand his conclusions have been adopted in the presentation of facts\r\nwhich follow.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GROWTH OF THE CHORAL SYMPHONY]\r\n\r\nThoughts of a symphony to succeed the Symphonies in A and F major (Nos.\r\n7 and 8), were in the composer’s mind while he was making sketches for\r\nthose two works in 1812; but the memoranda there found tell us only\r\nin what key the new symphony was to be; they are mere verbal notes:\r\n“2nd Sinfonie, D minor” and “Sinfonie in D minor--3rd Sinfonie.” A\r\nfugue-theme, identical, so far as the first three measures go, with\r\nthat of the Scherzo of the Ninth Symphony, presented itself to him\r\nand was imprisoned in his note-book in 1815, being recorded among the\r\nsketches for the Sonata for Pianoforte and Violoncello in D, Op. 102,\r\nNo. 2.[107] There is another sketch with a note[108] to show that\r\nBeethoven was thinking of a new symphony at the time; but the sketch\r\ncannot be associated with the Ninth Symphony, the composition of which\r\nreally began when the beginning of the first movement was sketched. Of\r\nthis fragments are found on loose leaves belonging to the year 1817.\r\nBy the end of that year and the beginning of 1818 (presumably from\r\nSeptember to May) extended sketches of the movement were made. The\r\nprincipal subject is definitively fixed, but the subsidiary material\r\nis still missing. The fugue-theme of 1817 is assigned to the third\r\nmovement. There is no suggestion of the use of Schiller’s “Ode to Joy,”\r\nbut a plain intimation of an instrumental finale. In 1818 a plan is\r\noutlined for the introduction of voices into the slow movement of a\r\nsymphony which is to follow the “Sinfonie in D.” It is as follows:\r\n\r\n    _Adagio Cantique._\r\n\r\n    Pious song in a symphony in the ancient modes--Lord God we praise\r\n    Thee--alleluia--either alone or as introduction to a fugue. The\r\n    whole 2nd sinfonie might be characterized in this manner in which\r\n    case the vocal parts would enter in the last movement or already\r\n    in the Adagio. The violins, etc., of the orchestra to be increased\r\n    tenfold in the last movement. Or the Adagio might be repeated in\r\n    some manner in the last movement, in which case the vocal parts\r\n    would enter gradually--in the text of the Adagio Greek myth,\r\n    _Cantique Ecclesiastique_--in the Allegro feast of Bachus [_sic_].\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that in 1822 Beethoven told Rochlitz that he had\r\ntwo symphonies in his mind which were to differ from each other. One\r\ndifference at least is indicated here by the purpose to use voices in\r\na movement to be written in the old modes. His well-known love for\r\nclassic subjects, no doubt, prompted the thought of the “pious orgies”\r\nof a Pagan festival. Schiller’s hymn is still absent from his mind.\r\nThese sketches were all sidewise excursions undertaken while Beethoven\r\nwas chiefly occupied with the composition of the Pianoforte Sonata, Op.\r\n106. What progress, if any, was made with the Symphony during the next\r\nfour years can not well be determined. The work was interrupted by\r\nthe composition of other works, notably the Mass in D, the last three\r\nPianoforte Sonatas and the overture and chorus for “The Consecration of\r\nthe House.” It was not until the Mass and the Josephstadt Theatre music\r\nwere finished in the sketches that he gave his attention largely to the\r\nSymphony. In the sketches of 1822, there are evidences of considerable\r\nprogress on the first movement, little if any on the Scherzo (designed\r\nto take third place in the scheme of movements), the fugue-themes of\r\n1815 and 1817 appearing in them almost unchanged. There is no hint as\r\nyet of the slow movement, but among the sketches appears the beginning\r\nof the melody of the “Ode to Joy” with the underlying words, assigned\r\nas a Finale. The thought of using the ode for a concluding movement had\r\npresented itself, but only tentatively, not as a fixed determination.\r\nFollowing this sketch, but of another date (to judge by the handwriting\r\nand the contents), comes a memorandum indicating that the symphony in\r\nmind was to consist of four movements--the first (no doubt, though it\r\nis not mentioned) being the present first, the second in 2-4 time, the\r\nthird (presumably) in 6-8, while the fourth was to be built on the\r\nfugal theme of 1817 and to be “well fugued.” The next recognizable\r\nsketch is for a Presto in 2-4 designated as a second movement and this\r\nis followed by the beginning of the first movement preceded by four\r\nmeasures in triple time marked “_Alla Autrichien_.” A third sketch is\r\nmarked as belonging to a “_Sinfonie allemand_.” It is a new melody to\r\nthe words beginning Schiller’s ode to be used in a chorus; and again\r\nthe accompanying memorandum reads: “_Sinfonie allemand_,” but now with\r\nthis addition: “either with variations after which the chorus _Freude\r\nschöner Götterfunken Tochter aus Elysium_ enters or without variations.\r\nEnd of the Sinfonie with Turkish music and vocal chorus.” It is\r\npossible that the melody had an earlier origin than that which appears\r\nfirst in the sketches and was eventually used. The last relevant sketch\r\nin the book of 1822 is a sort of thematic index to the symphony as it\r\nnow lay planned in Beethoven’s purpose:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe second movement was to be a fugued Scherzo with the theme of 1815,\r\nthe fourth the Presto in 2-4 time which first appeared in this year,\r\nthe fifth the “Ode to Joy.” In the midst of these sketches appears\r\nthe significant remark: “Or perhaps instead of a new symphony, a new\r\noverture on _Bach_, well fugued with 3----.”[109]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TWO SYMPHONIES IN CONTEMPLATION]\r\n\r\nThe conclusions to be drawn from the sketches thus far are that, as\r\nwas the case in 1812 when the Seventh and Eighth Symphonies were\r\nbrought forth as a pair, Beethoven was again contemplating the almost\r\nsimultaneous production of two symphonies. He did not adhere to the\r\nproject long, so far as we can know from the written records, and\r\nthe remark about the substitution of an overture on B-a-c-h probably\r\nmarks the time when he began seriously to consider the advisability\r\nof abandoning what would then have been the Tenth Symphony. With the\r\nexception of a portion of the first movement, the Ninth Symphony was\r\nstill in a chaotic state. Taken in connection with negotiations which\r\nhad been concluded with the Philharmonic Society of London, it may be\r\nassumed, however, that the present Symphony in D minor was associated\r\nin Beethoven’s mind with the English commission, and that the second,\r\nwhich he had thoughts of abandoning in favor of the overture, was to\r\nhave been a “Sinfonie allemand.” For a time, at least, Beethoven is\r\nnot likely to have contemplated a choral movement with German words in\r\nconnection with the symphony for the London Philharmonic Society: this\r\nwas to have an instrumental finale. The linguistic objection would be\r\ninvalid in the case of the German symphony, however, and to this was\r\nnow assigned the contemplated setting of Schiller’s poem.\r\n\r\nWork now proceeded with little interruption (except that occasioned\r\nby the composition of the Variations, Op. 120), and most of the first\r\nhalf of 1823 was devoted to the first movement, which was nearly\r\ncomplete in sketch-form before anything of the other movements appeared\r\nbeyond the themes which have already been cited. When the foundation\r\nof the work is firmly laid we have the familiar phenomenon of work\r\nupon two or three movements simultaneously. In a general way it may\r\nbe asserted that the year 1823 saw the birth of the Symphony, though\r\nwork was carried over into 1824. The second movement was complete in\r\nthe sketches before the third--this was about August; the third before\r\nthe fourth--about the middle of October. The second theme of the slow\r\nmovement was perfected before the sketches for the first movement were\r\nfinished. In a Conversation Book used in the fall of the year 1823\r\nthe nephew writes: “I am glad that you have brought in the beautiful\r\nandante.” The principal theme of the movement appears to have been\r\nconceived between May and July, 1823, but it had to submit to much\r\nalteration before it acquired the lovely contours which we now admire.\r\nThis was the case, too, with the simple folksong-like tune of the\r\nFinale.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INTRODUCING THE ODE TO JOY]\r\n\r\nSketches for the Finale show that Beethoven had made considerable\r\nprogress with the setting of Schiller’s ode before he decided to\r\nincorporate it with the Symphony. In June or July, 1823, he wrote down\r\na melody in D minor which he designated “_Finale instromentale_,” and\r\nwhich, transposed into another key and slightly altered, was eventually\r\nused in the finale of the Quartet in A minor, Op. 132. That it was\r\nintended for the Finale of the symphony is proved by the fact that it\r\nis surrounded with sketches for the Symphony in D minor and Beethoven\r\nrecurred to it twice before the end of the year; there was no thought\r\nof the quartet at the time.\r\n\r\nWhen he began work on the Finale, Beethoven took up the choral\r\npart with the instrumental variations first and then attacked the\r\ninstrumental introduction with the recitatives. The present “Joy”\r\nmelody, as noted in the fall of 1822, was preceded by a different one\r\nconceived later, if the sketches are taken as a guide. After adoption\r\nthe tune, especially its second period, underwent many transformations\r\nbefore its definitive form was established. Among the musical sketches\r\noccur several verbal memoranda containing hints which were carried out\r\nin part, for instance: “Turkish music in _Wer das nie gekonnt stehle_”;\r\nin sketches for the _Allegro alla marcia_: “Turkish music--first\r\n_pianissimo_--a few sounds _pianissimo_--a few rests--then the full\r\nstrength”; a third: “On _Welt Sternenzelt forte_ trombone blasts”; a\r\nfourth (in studies for the final chorus): “the height of the voices\r\nto be more by instruments” (which may be interpreted to mean that\r\nBeethoven realized that he was carrying the voices into dangerous\r\naltitudes and intended to give them instrumental support). Other\r\nsketches indicate that Beethoven intended for a considerable time to\r\nwrite an instrumental introduction with new themes for the Finale. For\r\nthis prelude there are a number of sketches of different kinds, some\r\nof them conceived while sketches for the first movement were still in\r\nhand. Before July, 1823, there are no hints of a combined vocal and\r\ninstrumental bridge from the Adagio to the setting of the “Ode to Joy.”\r\nAfter that month there are evidences that he had conceived the idea\r\nof introducing the “Joy” melody played upon wind-instruments with a\r\nprelude in the recitative style, a reminiscence of the first movement\r\nand premonitory suggestions of the fundamental melody. This was the\r\nfirst step towards the eventual shape of the finale. The lacking\r\nelement was the verbal link which should connect the instrumental\r\nmovements with the choral conclusion. The sketches bear out Schindler’s\r\nremark: “When he reached the development of the fourth movement there\r\nbegan a struggle such as is seldom seen. The object was to find a\r\nproper manner of introducing Schiller’s ode. One day entering the\r\nroom he exclaimed ‘I have it! I have it!’ With that he showed me the\r\nsketchbook bearing the words, ‘Let us sing the song of the immortal\r\nSchiller _Freude_.’”\r\n\r\nBy grouping a number of sketches it is now possible to make a graphic\r\nrepresentation of the ideas which passed through Beethoven’s mind\r\nwhile seeking a way to bridge the chasm between instrumental and vocal\r\nutterance by means of the formula of recitative. The sketches are in\r\nparts illegible, in parts so obscure that Nottebohm and Deiters differ\r\nin their readings; regard has been had for both in the following\r\nversion: Over a portion of an instrumental recitative (_a_) occur the\r\nwords: “_Nein diese ... erinnern an unsere Verzweifl._” (No, these ...\r\nremind (us) of our despair); other sketches follow in the order here\r\nindicated:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:(a)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Heute ist ein feierlicher Tag\r\n  (To-day is a solemn day)\r\n\r\n  meine Fru (Freunde?) dieser sei gefeiert\r\n  my fri (friends?) let it be celebrated\r\n\r\n  durch mit Gesang und [Tanz?

Freude\r\n  (“not these tones, more joyful ones”)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe entire Symphony was finished in sketch-form at the end of 1823 and\r\nwritten out in score in February, 1824. Omitting from consideration the\r\ntheme of the second movement, noted in 1815 and again in 1817 (probably\r\nwith an entirely different purpose in mind), the time which elapsed\r\nbetween the beginning of the first movement (1817-1818) and the time of\r\ncompletion was about six and a half years. Within this period, however,\r\nthere were extended interruptions caused by other works. Serious and\r\ncontinuous labor on the Symphony was not taken up until after the\r\ncompletion of the _Missa solemnis_; it began in 1822, occupied the\r\ngreater part of 1823 and ended in the early part of 1824. Beethoven,\r\ntherefore, worked on the Symphony a little more than a year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INSTRUMENTAL AND VOCAL PARTS UNITED]\r\n\r\nThose who cherish the fantastic notion that the Symphony was conceived\r\n_ab initio_ as a celebration of joy, and therefore feel obliged to go\r\nback to Beethoven’s first design to compose music for Schiller’s ode,\r\nhave a large territory for the play of their fancy. Beethoven formed\r\nthe plan of setting the ode while still living in Bonn in 1793. It\r\nis heard of again in a sketchbook of 1798, where there is a melodic\r\nphrase adapted to the words, “Muss ein lieber Vater wohnen.” Amongst\r\nsketches for the Seventh and Eighth Symphonies (say in 1811) there\r\ncrops up a melody for the beginning of the hymn, and possibly a little\r\nlater (1812) a more extended sketch amongst material used in the\r\nOverture, Op. 115, into which he appears at one time to have thought\r\nof introducing portions of it. All these sketches, of course, preceded\r\nthe melody of 1812, conceived for use in a “_Sinfonie allemand_.”\r\nWhen Beethoven first took up the ode for setting it was to become a\r\n“durchkomponirtes Lied,” i. e., each stanza was to have an illustrative\r\nsetting; when he planned to incorporate it in an overture he proposed\r\nto use only selected portions of the poem, for he accompanies the\r\nmelodic sketch with the note: “Disjointed fragments like Princes\r\nare beggars, etc., not the whole”; and a little later: “disjointed\r\nfragments from Schiller’s _Freude_ connected into a whole.”[110]\r\n\r\nThe questions which have been raised by the choral finale are many\r\nand have occupied the minds of musicians, professional and amateur,\r\never since the great symphony was first given to the world. In 1852\r\nCarl Czerny told Otto Jahn that Beethoven had thought, after the\r\nperformance, of composing a new finale without vocal parts for the\r\nwork. Schindler[111] saw the note in Jahn’s papers and wrote in the\r\nmargin: “That is not true”; but it must be remembered that there was a\r\ncessation of the great intimacy between Beethoven and Schindler which\r\nbegan not long after the Symphony had been produced, and lasted almost\r\ntill Beethoven was on his deathbed. Schindler can not have been present\r\nat all of the meetings between Beethoven and his friends at which the\r\nSymphony was discussed. Nevertheless he is upheld, in a measure, by the\r\nfact (to which Nottebohm directed attention) that Beethoven, if he made\r\nthe remark, either did not mean it to be taken seriously or afterwards\r\nchanged his mind; for after keeping the manuscript in his hands six\r\nmonths he sent it to the publisher as we have it. Seyfried, writing\r\nin “Cäcilia” (Vol. IX, p. 236), faults Beethoven for not having taken\r\nthe advice of well-meaning friends and written a new finale as he did\r\nfor the Quartet in B-flat, Op. 130. Even if one of the well-meaning\r\nfriends was Seyfried himself, the statement has value as evidence that\r\nBeethoven was not as convinced as Czerny’s story would have it appear\r\nthat the choral finale was a mistake. Sonnleithner, in a letter to the\r\neditor of the “Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung” in 1864, confirmed\r\nJahn’s statement by saying that Czerny had repeatedly related as an\r\nunimpeachable fact that some time after the first performance of the\r\nSymphony Beethoven, in a circle of his most intimate friends, had\r\nexpressed himself positively to the effect that he perceived that he\r\nhad made a mistake (_Misgriff_) in the last movement and intended to\r\nreject it and write an instrumental piece in its stead, for which he\r\nalready had an idea in his head. What that idea was the reader knows.\r\nThat Beethoven may have had scruples touching the appropriateness\r\nof the choral finale, is comprehensible enough in view of the fact\r\nthat the original plan of the Symphony contemplated an instrumental\r\nclose and that Beethoven labored so hard to establish arbitrarily an\r\norganic union between the ode and the first three movements; but it is\r\nnot likely that he gave long thought to the project of writing a new\r\nfinale. He had witnessed the extraordinary demonstration of delight\r\nwith which the whole work had been received and he may have found it\r\nas easy as some of his commentators to believe that his device for\r\npresenting the choral finale as the logical and poetically just outcome\r\nof the preceding movements had been successful despite its obvious\r\nartificiality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PREPARING FOR THE FIRST PERFORMANCE]\r\n\r\nFor the chief facts in the story of the first performance of the D\r\nminor Symphony in Vienna we are largely dependent on Schindler, who\r\nwas not only a witness of it but also an active agent. Beethoven was\r\nthoroughly out of sympathy with the musical taste of Vienna, which had\r\nbeen diverted from German ideals by the superficial charm of Rossini’s\r\nmelodies. He wanted much to produce his symphony, but despaired of\r\nreceiving adequate support or recognition from his home public. His\r\nfriends offered him encouragement, but his fear and suspicion that\r\nhis music was no longer understood by the Viennese and he no longer\r\nadmired, had grown into a deep-rooted conviction. The project of a\r\nconcert at which the Mass in D should be performed had been mooted\r\nmonths before. One day Sontag visited him and asked, “When are you\r\ngoing to give your concert?” We have a record of her speeches only;\r\nwhat Beethoven said must be supplied from the reader’s fancy. It is\r\nplain enough that instead of answering the question he expressed a\r\ndoubt as to a successful financial outcome. “You give the concert,”\r\nsaid the singer, “and I will guarantee that the house will be full.”\r\nStill a moody suspicion, which the lady thinks it her right to rebuke:\r\n“You have too little confidence in yourself. Has not the homage of the\r\nwhole world given you a little more pride? Who speaks of opposition?\r\nWill you not learn to believe that everybody is longing to worship\r\nyou again in new works? O obstinacy!” This was in January. Beethoven\r\nhad inquired of Count Brühl in Berlin whether or not a performance of\r\nthe new Mass and Symphony might be given in that city, and Brühl had\r\nfavored the plan. When news of this fact became known in Vienna, a\r\nnumber of Beethoven’s friends addressed him in the following memorial:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AN ADDRESS TO THE COMPOSER]\r\n\r\n    To Herrn Ludwig van Beethoven.\r\n\r\n    Out of the wide circle of reverent admirers surrounding your genius\r\n    in this your second native city, there approach you to-day a small\r\n    number of the disciples and lovers of art to give expression to\r\n    long-felt wishes, timidly to prefer a long-suppressed request.\r\n\r\n    But as the number of spokesmen bears but a small proportion to the\r\n    many who joyfully acknowledge your worth and what you have grown\r\n    to be to the present as well as the future, so the wishes and\r\n    requests are by no means restricted to the number of those who are\r\n    like-minded with themselves and who, in the name of all to whom\r\n    art and the realization of their ideals are something more than\r\n    means and objects of pastime, assert that their wish is also the\r\n    wish of an unnumbered multitude, their request is echoed loudly or\r\n    in silence by every one whose bosom is animated by a sense of the\r\n    divine in music.\r\n\r\n    It is the wish of those of our countrymen who reverence art to\r\n    which we desire more especially to give expression; for though\r\n    Beethoven’s name and creations belong to all contemporaneous\r\n    humanity and every country which opens a susceptible bosom to art,\r\n    it is Austria which is best entitled to claim him as her own. Among\r\n    her inhabitants appreciation for the great and immortal works which\r\n    Mozart and Haydn created for all time within the lap of their home\r\n    still lives, and they are conscious with joyous pride that the\r\n    sacred triad in which these names and yours glow as the symbol of\r\n    the highest within the spiritual realm of tones, sprang from the\r\n    soil of their fatherland. All the more painful must it have been\r\n    for you to feel that a foreign power has invaded this royal citadel\r\n    of the noblest, that above the mounds of the dead and around the\r\n    dwelling-place of the only survivor of the band, phantoms are\r\n    leading the dance who can boast of no kinship with the princely\r\n    spirits of those royal houses; that shallowness is abusing the name\r\n    and insignia of art, and unworthy dalliance with sacred things is\r\n    beclouding and dissipating appreciation for the pure and eternally\r\n    beautiful.\r\n\r\n    For this reason they feel a greater and livelier sense than\r\n    ever before that the great need of the present moment is a new\r\n    impulse directed by a powerful hand, a new advent of the ruler in\r\n    his domain. It is this need which leads them to you to-day, and\r\n    following are the petitions which they lay before you in behalf of\r\n    all to whom these wishes are dear, and in the name of native art.\r\n\r\n    Do not withhold longer from the popular enjoyment, do not keep\r\n    longer from the oppressed sense of that which is great and perfect,\r\n    a performance of the latest masterworks of your hand. We know that\r\n    a grand sacred composition has been associated with that first one\r\n    in which you have immortalized the emotions of a soul, penetrated\r\n    and transfigured by the power of faith and superterrestrial light.\r\n    We know that a new flower glows in the garland of your glorious,\r\n    still unequalled symphonies. For years, ever since the thunders\r\n    of the Victory at Vittoria ceased to reverberate, we have waited\r\n    and hoped to see you distribute new gifts from the fulness of your\r\n    riches to the circle of your friends. Do not longer disappoint the\r\n    general expectations! Heighten the effect of your newest creations\r\n    by the joy of becoming first acquainted with them through you!\r\n    Do not allow these, your latest offspring, some day to appear,\r\n    perhaps, as foreigners in their place of birth, introduced,\r\n    perhaps, by persons to whom you and your mind are strange! Appear\r\n    soon among your friends, your admirers, your venerators! This is\r\n    our nearest and first prayer.\r\n\r\n    Other claims on your genius have been made public. The desires\r\n    expressed and offers made to you more than a year ago by the\r\n    management of our Court Opera and the Society of Austrian Friends\r\n    of Music had too long been the unuttered wish of all admirers of\r\n    art, and your name stimulated the hopes and expectations of too\r\n    many not to obtain the quickest and widest publicity, not to awaken\r\n    the most general interest. Poetry has done her share in giving\r\n    support to these lovely hopes and wishes. Worthy material from the\r\n    hand of a valued poet waits to be charmed into life by your fancy.\r\n    Do not let that intimate call to so noble an aim be made in vain.\r\n    Do not delay longer to lead us back to those departed days when the\r\n    song of Polyhymnia moved powerfully and delighted the initiates in\r\n    art and the hearts of the multitude!\r\n\r\n    Need we tell you with what regret your retirement from public life\r\n    has filled us? Need we assure you that at a time when all glances\r\n    were hopefully turned towards you, all perceived with sorrow that\r\n    _the one_ man whom all of us are compelled to acknowledge as\r\n    foremost among living men in his domain, looked on in silence as\r\n    foreign art took possession of German soil, the seat of honor of\r\n    the German muse, while German works gave pleasure only by echoing\r\n    the favorite tunes of foreigners and, where the most excellent had\r\n    lived and labored, a second childhood of taste threatens to follow\r\n    the Golden Age of Art?\r\n\r\n    You alone are able to insure a decisive victory to the efforts of\r\n    the best amongst us. From you the native Art Society and the German\r\n    Opera expect new blossoms, rejuvenated life and a new sovereignty\r\n    of the true and beautiful over the dominion to which the prevalent\r\n    spirit of fashion wishes to subject even the eternal laws of art.\r\n    Bid us hope that the wishes of all who have listened to the sound\r\n    of your harmonies will soon be fulfilled! This is our most urgent\r\n    second prayer.\r\n\r\n    May the year which we have begun not come to an end without\r\n    rejoicing us with the fruits of our petition and may the coming\r\n    Spring when it witnesses the unfolding of one of our longed-for\r\n    gifts become a twofold blooming-time for us and all the world of\r\n    art!\r\n\r\n    Vienna, February, 1824.\r\n\r\nThis address was signed by thirty of Beethoven’s friends and admirers,\r\namong them being Prince Lichnowsky, Count Dietrichstein, Count\r\nLichnowsky, Abbé Stadler, Count Palfy, Count Fries, Dr. Sonnleithner,\r\nand the publishers Diabelli, Artaria, Leidesdorf and Steiner and Co.\r\nThe most active agent in securing signatures was Count Lichnowsky.\r\nIt was published in Bäuerle’s “Theater-Zeitung” and also in Kanne’s\r\njournal. This publication, and gossip to the effect that he had\r\nprompted both writing and printing, annoyed Beethoven greatly. He gave\r\nvent to his rage in a remark which he himself wrote in a Conversation\r\nBook: “Now that the thing has taken this turn I can no longer find\r\njoy in it. The atrocity of attributing such an act to me sickens me\r\nwith the whole business and I am scarcely able to address even a few\r\nwords to men of such intellectual prominence. Not a single critic can\r\nboast of having received a letter from me. I have never----” there\r\nhis outburst breaks off; he did not finish the sentence in writing.\r\nSchindler tried to ease his mind! “Your fears are groundless,” he\r\nwrote; “your honor has not been compromised--let that suffice you;\r\nnobody will accuse you of having been directly concerned in it.” Court\r\nSecretary von Felsburg and J. N. Bihler, a tutor in the imperial\r\nhousehold, waited upon Beethoven one afternoon to present the address,\r\nand talk over its suggestions. Beethoven said he wanted to read it\r\nwhen alone. Later Schindler went to him and found him with the letter\r\nin his hand. He was manifestly moved by its expressions and handed it\r\nto Schindler to read while he went to the window and gazed out for\r\nquite a while. Then he returned to Schindler, said briefly: “It is\r\nvery beautiful!--it rejoices me greatly!” and when Schindler also had\r\nexpressed his delight added: “Let us go out for a walk.” During the\r\nwalk he remained sunk in thought.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A CONSPIRACY OF FRIENDS]\r\n\r\nThe object had in view by the designers of the memorial was\r\naccomplished;--Beethoven was lifted out of his despondent mood and\r\ninspired with new determination. By March Schindler had been informed\r\nthat the concert would be given in Vienna. He lauded Beethoven’s\r\ndecision and begged him not to distress himself with vain imaginings\r\nabout the outcome--everything would go gloriously and everybody\r\nwould esteem it an honor to participate. Expressions of satisfaction\r\npoured in on the composer from all quarters, and also offers of help.\r\nBeethoven’s friends gathered together and discussed the details in the\r\nliveliest fashion--the time, the place, the programme, the choir and\r\norchestra, who should sing the solos, the price of seats, the number\r\nof rehearsals. The concert-season was drawing to a close and delay was\r\nhazardous; but delay there was, for Beethoven was vacillating, full\r\nof doubtings and suspicions, and there was a too great multiplicity\r\nof counsellors. Schindler was kept extremely busy; Lichnowsky and\r\nSchuppanzigh bestirred themselves mightily; Brother Johann came to\r\nthe fore with advice and suggestions, especially about the business\r\nadministration; Nephew Karl, much to Schindler’s dissatisfaction,\r\nnot only ran errands but volunteered his opinion on many topics. A\r\npage from a Conversation Book will disclose how the consultations\r\nwith Beethoven were carried on--for Beethoven’s consent to every step\r\nhad to be obtained, which was a pity. In the following excerpt it is\r\nSchuppanzigh who is speaking to the composer, whom he, as was his wont,\r\naddresses in the third person--as was fitting to the dignity of “Mylord\r\nFalstaff.”\r\n\r\n    How about the concert? It is getting late--Lent will not last much\r\n    longer. He ought to give three movements [the mass is meant, of\r\n    course].--Under no circumstances a piano piece. There are no piano\r\n    players here. He will need Buringer [Piringer] to provide the best\r\n    _dilettante_, Sonnleithner to look after the singers, and Plachetka\r\n    [Blahetka] for the announcements and bills--Young Sonnleithner has\r\n    all the amateur singers under his thumb. It would be a good idea\r\n    for him [Beethoven] to pay a visit to Duport _to talk to him once\r\n    more about me_.\r\n\r\nThe significance of the concluding remark will appear later. At another\r\ntime Karl is reporting progress:\r\n\r\n    Piringer has said that he would undertake the appointment of\r\n    the instrumentalists, Sonnleithner the chorus, Schuppanzigh the\r\n    orchestra, Blahetka the announcements, tickets, etc. So everything\r\n    is looked after. You can give two concerts.... When will you have\r\n    it announced? Schuppanzigh is coming to-morrow.... Blahetka offered\r\n    to stamp the tickets, etc., but I think that all such matters ought\r\n    to be [entrusted] to your brother. It would be safer.... Piringer\r\n    has enough to do with the choruses. Piringer is a very capable man\r\n    but not the man that Schuppanzigh is; in any event it would be\r\n    unjust to disregard S., as he has taken so much pains and spurred\r\n    on the others.\r\n\r\nAt first it was agreed that the place should be the\r\nTheater-an-der-Wien. Count Palfy, who had signed the memorial, was\r\nwilling to provide the theatre and all the forces, vocal as well as\r\ninstrumental, for 1200 florins, let Beethoven have as many rehearsals\r\nas he desired and fix the prices of admission. But a difficulty\r\npresented itself at once. At the Theater-an-der-Wien Seyfried was\r\nchapelmaster and Clement leader of the orchestra. Beethoven wanted\r\nUmlauf to be general conductor of the concert and Schuppanzigh leader\r\nof the orchestra. Count Palfy was willing to sacrifice Seyfried, but\r\nnot Clement--at least, he asked that if Clement was to be displaced it\r\nbe done with as little injury to his feelings as possible. He therefore\r\nsuggested that Beethoven write a letter of explanation to Clement,\r\nwhich he felt sure would solve the difficulty. Meanwhile Schindler had\r\nbegun negotiations with Duport, director of the Kärnthnerthor Theatre.\r\nDuport was favorably inclined towards the enterprise and also towards\r\nSchuppanzigh; but troublesome questions of another kind were now\r\nprecipitated--questions about prices of admission, the solo singers\r\nand the number of rehearsals. On all these points Beethoven was so\r\nirresolute that the project seemed likely to fall by the wayside; in\r\nwhich crisis the leading spirits thought themselves entitled to resort\r\nto a stratagem to give stability to the wavering mind of Beethoven.\r\nIn at least one instance the Conversation Book record was given the\r\nappearance of a formal journal of proceedings. It was now planned that\r\nLichnowsky, Schindler and Schuppanzigh should simultaneously call upon\r\nBeethoven as if by accident, turn the conversation on the points on\r\nwhich it was necessary for Beethoven to reach a decision and that his\r\nutterances should then be put into writing and he be asked, half in\r\njest, half in earnest, to affix his signature to the document. The ruse\r\nsucceeded for the nonce, but the result would eventually have been\r\nwoeful had Beethoven been less irresolute. After the conspirators had\r\ngone away Beethoven saw through the trick which had been played on him\r\nand, scenting treachery as was his wont, decided off-hand to abandon\r\nthe concert. He issued his pronunciamento to the three friends in this\r\ncharacteristic fashion:\r\n\r\n    To Count Moritz Lichnowsky. I despise treachery. Do not visit me\r\n    again. No concert.\r\n\r\n    To Herrn Schuppanzigh. Let him not visit me more. I shall give no\r\n    concert.\r\n\r\n    To Schindler. I request you not to come again until I send for you.\r\n    No concert.\r\n\r\nThe three friends refused to take umbrage at Beethoven’s rudeness; the\r\nnotes were not accompanied by a silken rope; they gave him time to get\r\nover his wrath and suspicion and then went on with the preparations\r\nfor the concert. In the Conversation Book there appears a record of a\r\nconsultation which may fairly be set down as that of the meeting at\r\nwhich Beethoven’s helpers employed their stratagem.[112] Schindler\r\nopens a page formally thus:\r\n\r\n  Protocol of March 2.\r\n\r\n  Present:\r\n    Mr. L. van Beethoven, a _musikus_.\r\n    Mr. Count v. Lichnowsky, an amateur.\r\n    Mr. Schindler, a fiddler.\r\n  Not yet present to-day:\r\n    Mr. Schuppanzigh, a fiddler representing Mylord Fallstaff.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LOOKING AFTER DETAILS]\r\n\r\nAt this consultation Schindler reports an offer from Palfy to furnish\r\nthe Theater-an-der-Wien, orchestra, lights, etc., _appertinentia_\r\nfor 1000 florins, provided a second or third concert be given. At a\r\nmoderate charge for admission (which would be necessary) he says the\r\nreceipts would be 4000 florins, which would yield a profit of 2000\r\nflorins at the first concert and about 3000 at the second, when there\r\nwould be no copying charges. The prices would not be so high as at the\r\nRidotto Room. If Duport were to charge only 300 florins, there would\r\nstill be a further charge of 300 florins for building the platform\r\nand no end of vexation and labor. Palfy wanted only his expenses.\r\nWould Beethoven authorize him (Schindler) and Lichnowsky to complete\r\narrangements with Palfy? He need not be paid, and it would be possible\r\nto withdraw from the arrangement at any time. Haste was necessary,\r\nfor a supervisor must be appointed--Umlauf or somebody else--so that\r\nrehearsals might begin. If Schuppanzigh were given too much to do and\r\nanything went ill the conductor would lay the blame on insufficient\r\nstudy. From the record of a subsequent consultation (in March) the\r\nfollowing excerpts are made:\r\n\r\n    _Lichnowsky_: It is right that the orchestra be doubled, but\r\n    superfluous to engage more than are necessary; after Schuppanzigh\r\n    and Umlauf know what is at their service at the Wiedener Theatre we\r\n    can tell what is needed.\r\n\r\n    _Schindler_: Lichnowsky says that a smaller orchestra is\r\n    more effective at the Theater-an-der-Wien than a large\r\n    one in the Ridotto Room. You need not take all at the\r\n    Theater-an-der-Wien--none at all if you do not need them,--that is\r\n    the arrangement with Palfy.\r\n\r\n    _Lichnowsky_: Unnecessary expenses must be avoided.\r\n\r\n    _Schindler_: You will not have to pay the forces at the\r\n    Theater-an-der-Wien at all--so that may be deducted. The days of\r\n    performance if agreeable to you would be the 22nd or 23rd or 24th\r\n    of this month.\r\n\r\n    _Lichnowsky_: You will make money, and more if you give a second\r\n    concert, when it will not be necessary that all the pieces be new;\r\n    you will have the same symphony and two other missal movements.\r\n\r\n    _Schindler_: The prices of admission will be considerably modified\r\n    at 2 florins for the parterre, 2 florins for the gallery and 15\r\n    florins for the seats.--You ought not to seek difficulties where\r\n    there are none; if the worst comes to the worst, everything will be\r\n    settled--The question is not whether there are more difficulties at\r\n    the theatre or the Ridotto Room--I shall see Schuppanzigh to-day\r\n    noon; but before then Lichnowsky will go to Palfy tentatively to\r\n    report your decision.\r\n\r\nThe conversation continued (probably the next day):\r\n\r\n    _Schindler_: Schuppanzigh is greatly pleased that you have come\r\n    to an understanding with Palfy. He will make use of the entire\r\n    orchestra of the theatre. He is coming to the Ridotto Room to-day,\r\n    as he hopes to find you there. The choruses at the theatre are\r\n    also good; Schuppanzigh says that the women’s choir of the society\r\n    is not of the best because they are all young girls; which is\r\n    true.--The Baron took the tempo just once again as fast, therefore\r\n    your advice was highly important; not until the second time did it\r\n    go well.--Besides, the women’s choir is thoroughly bad. Falstaff\r\n    was also convinced and is now glad that nothing but the men’s choir\r\n    will be needed. The solo voices are much too weak for the room and\r\n    too--young.--The soprano singer is sixteen years old at the most.\r\n    Palfy is sending you word that he will send you his offer, which\r\n    you know, and the promise which he made, to-morrow in writing.--You\r\n    are choosing the lesser of two evils.--Twenty to twenty-four\r\n    for each part in the chorus are already on hand.--Of the twelve\r\n    violins for each part we to-day selected the six best, who are to\r\n    be arranged in rank and file.--The only wish that Palfy has, as\r\n    he admitted to Lichnowsky to-day, is that Klement be handled as\r\n    gently as possible so that his feelings may not be hurt. For this\r\n    reason we all request you to write a billet to Klement and tell\r\n    the truth as it is. But as there is no question but that he will\r\n    come to the second concert, I suggest that the direction be then\r\n    given to him.--Schuppanzigh is agreed to this. And as Piringer of\r\n    the Theater-an-der-Wien pretends that as a high R. I. official he\r\n    cannot take part, Klement might take first place among the second\r\n    violins at the first concert and Schuppanzigh at the second.--Palfy\r\n    does not at all want that you shall take Klement, but only that you\r\n    shall take the trouble to write him a billet and tell him about\r\n    the matter. He will certainly be agreeable.--He [Schuppanzigh] has\r\n    become much quieter and more _commode_ since he was in Russia--his\r\n    paunch is already beginning to embarrass him. Böhm will play first\r\n    violin, Piringer will not play at the An-der-Wien, which is all one\r\n    to Schuppanzigh.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COMPOSITION OF THE PERFORMING FORCE]\r\n\r\nBut matters were not so easily arranged with Clement as Schindler had\r\nimagined. He did not want to be deprived of the honor of playing at the\r\nconcert, the orchestra of the Theater-an-der-Wien sided with him and\r\ndeclared that it would not play under Schuppanzigh. Schindler appealed\r\nto Count Palfy, who knew that though you can lead a horse to water\r\nyou cannot make him drink. He said that he could command the men to\r\nplay under Schuppanzigh, but he did not want to be answerable for the\r\nmischief which would result. Schindler advised Beethoven that if Palfy\r\nstood by Clement the contract for the Kärnthnerthor Theatre be closed\r\nwith Duport. Up to late in April it was as good as settled that the\r\nconcert would be given at the Theater-an-der-Wien, though Beethoven’s\r\nfatal indecision left the point uncertain. With negotiations pending\r\nwith both theatres the Ridotto Room came up for consideration, and\r\nfinally (it would seem as a consequence of advice by the Steiner\r\nfirm), also a fourth _locale_. This was the Landständischer Saal, a\r\nsmall room in which the _Concerts Spirituels_ took place. Lichnowsky,\r\nwhen he heard that Beethoven was considering such a step, hurried to\r\nhim with representations that if the hall were taken there would be\r\ntrouble with Palfy and he himself humiliated and embarrassed, since he\r\nhad come to an agreement with the manager in his name. He as well as\r\nSchindler was sorely tried by the new turn of affairs and represented\r\nto Beethoven that the room was too small, holding only 500 persons, and\r\nthat the court would not go there. But Nephew Karl favored the hall\r\nbecause its choice would avoid the difficulties (_Sauerei_) incident\r\nto the selection of either of the theatres. Lichnowsky and Schindler\r\ndid not seek to hide their displeasure from Beethoven because of his\r\nwillingness to take the advice of others (meaning, no doubt, Brother\r\nJohann, Nephew Karl and Steiner), in preference to theirs, but at\r\nlength circumstances compelled him to abandon all other plans and\r\nagree to take the Kärnthnerthor Theatre. He considered the noon hour as\r\nthe time for the concert, but Johann told him that an evening concert\r\nwas worth 1500 florins more than one given in the daytime; he clung\r\nto the Landständischer Saal, but Schindler told him that on the day\r\nwhich had been fixed upon there was to be a concert at the Ridotto\r\nRoom in which Sontag, Unger and the Italian singers would take part.\r\n“The girls” would therefore be unavailable for his concert and the\r\ncourt would, of course, go to the fashionable place and affair. As\r\nlate as April 21, it was publicly announced that the concert would\r\nbe given in the Theater-an-der-Wien, but at length Beethoven made up\r\nhis mind, and Schindler was empowered to close with Duport for the\r\nKärnthnerthor Theatre. Palfy yielded to the composer’s wishes, but\r\nregretfully, saying that he would rather lose 1000 florins than the\r\nhonor of having the concert in his house. It would seem as if it was\r\nthe cabal in the orchestra against Schuppanzigh which ended Beethoven’s\r\nirresolution. Beethoven now decided to take the Court theatre for 400\r\nflorins, chorus and orchestra being included as well as the lighting,\r\nwith the privilege of a repetition on the same terms in seven or eight\r\ndays. In the letter which Beethoven sent to Duport, were named Sontag,\r\nUnger and Preisinger (bass) as solo singers, Umlauf and Schuppanzigh\r\nas leaders, the orchestra and chorus were to be augmented from the\r\namateur forces of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde. There were to be\r\n24 violins, 10 violas, 12 contrabasses and violoncellos, and the number\r\nof wind-instruments was to be doubled, for which reason room would have\r\nto be provided for the orchestra on the stage. Duport was requested to\r\nfix the date not later than May 3rd or 4th and was informed that the\r\nreason why the agreement with Count Palfy had been cancelled was that\r\nthe Theater-an-der-Wien was lacking in capable solo singers and that\r\nPalfy wanted Clement to lead the orchestra, whereas Beethoven had long\r\nbefore selected Schuppanzigh for the post. With a change of date to May\r\n7 this arrangement was formally confirmed.\r\n\r\nBut many details remained to be settled, the most vexatious to\r\nBeethoven being the prices of admission. Beethoven wanted an advance\r\non the regular tariff. Duport appealed to the Minister of Police, but\r\npermission to raise the prices was refused. In the selection of solo\r\nsingers Therese Grünbaum had been considered, but she was eventually\r\nset aside in favor of Henrietta Sontag, for whom Beethoven had a\r\npersonal admiration (he could not know much, if anything, about her\r\nvoice and art). She and Unger, who had a sincere love for Beethoven’s\r\nmusic, were the composer’s “pretty witches” and had been invited by\r\nhim to dinner. Jäger had been suggested for the tenor part, but Anton\r\nHaitzinger was chosen because, in a spirit of professional courtesy,\r\nJäger refused to take a part away from a Kärnthnerthor singer. Forti\r\nand Preisinger were rival candidates for the solo bass parts. The\r\nlatter was considered the more musical of the two and better fitted\r\nfor Beethoven’s music, and was therefore selected. He took part in\r\nthe rehearsals, and for him Beethoven made a change in the music of\r\nthe recitative in the Symphony (Schindler gives it in his biography);\r\nbut at the last the _tessitura_ of the part was found to be too high\r\nfor him and Preisinger had to withdraw. It was impossible under the\r\ncircumstances now to appeal to Forti, and the part was entrusted to\r\nSeipelt of the company at the Theater-an-der-Wien.\r\n\r\nIt was originally intended that the programme should consist of the\r\nnew Overture (Op. 124), the Mass in D and the new Symphony; but\r\nrealizing that this would make the concert unduly long Beethoven first\r\ndecided to omit the _Gloria_ of the mass, and after the rehearsals\r\nhad already begun he curtailed the list still more by eliding the\r\n_Sanctus_. The large amount of copying involved was done by a staff\r\nof men some of whom worked, apparently, under the supervision of the\r\nwidow of Schlemmer, Beethoven’s favorite copyist who had died the year\r\nbefore. The composer angrily rejected Haslinger’s suggestion that\r\nthe chorus parts be engraved, but consented to have them duplicated\r\nby lithographic process. The church authorities were opposed to the\r\nperformance of missal music in a theatre and the censor therefore\r\nwithheld his approval of the programme. So, in April, at the suggestion\r\nof Schindler, Beethoven wrote a letter to the censor, Sartorius, in\r\nwhich he pleaded for his consent to the performance on the ground that\r\nhe was giving the concert by request, had involved himself in costs\r\nby reason of the copying, there was no time in which to produce other\r\nnovelties, and if consent were refused he would be compelled to abandon\r\nthe concert and all his expenditures would have been in vain. The three\r\necclesiastical pieces which were to be performed were to be listed on\r\nthe programme as hymns. The letter failed of its mission; not until an\r\nappeal was made to Count Sedlnitzky, the Police President, through the\r\nagency of Count Lichnowsky, was the performance sanctioned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE COMPOSER AND HONORARY TITLES]\r\n\r\nOne further detail of the preparations, as disclosed by a discussion\r\nin Beethoven’s ministerial cabinet, is too interesting to be omitted.\r\nThe time is come when bills must be posted in front of the theatre.\r\nSchindler is the first speaker:\r\n\r\n    Master! Listen! I have something to say, so follow me: How shall\r\n    the placard be worded (it must be printed to-day); shall I put in\r\n    Member of the Royal Academy at Stockholm and Amsterdam? Tell me\r\n    briefly. What a tremendous title!!\r\n\r\n    _Schuppanzigh_: I am not in favor of it. Beethoven is dictator and\r\n    president of all the academies in the world and sensible people\r\n    will look upon this title as vanity on his part.\r\n\r\n    _Schindler_: My lord is not wrong. At any rate it will be made\r\n    public by the last notices in the newspapers. The name of\r\n    Beethoven shines brightest without affix of any kind and when most\r\n    unassuming; all the world knows who and what you are. It will do\r\n    your posterity no good.--Who knows what a later time will bring\r\n    forth.... I must go now to get the bill ready for to-morrow. It is\r\n    half-past 5.\r\n\r\nThis was, no doubt, another case in which it was thought judicious to\r\nget Beethoven’s consent beyond equivocation. There is record of another\r\nconversation on the subject. Schindler speaks again:\r\n\r\n    Well then, it shall appear on the bill to-morrow, Member of the\r\n    Royal Academies of Stockholm and Amsterdam. Nothing more; that\r\n    sounds best.--Then it ought to read of Arts and Sciences.--But when\r\n    one says Roy. Acad. the _epitheton_ Arts and Sciences is understood.\r\n\r\nIn neither of these consultations, which took place two days before\r\nthe concert, is there any indication that Beethoven objected to the\r\nuse of the title; on the contrary, he seems to have desired to make\r\nit more explicit by the inclusion of the words “Arts and Sciences.”\r\nBut Schindler relates that when Bernard, in preparing an announcement\r\nfor the public press, added to Beethoven’s name: “Honorary Member of\r\nthe Academies of Arts and Sciences at Stockholm and Amsterdam and also\r\nHonorary Citizen of the R. I. Capital and Residential City Vienna,”\r\nhe rebuked the editor severely, not wanting to have such “silly and\r\nridiculous playthings” figure in the announcement. As a matter of fact,\r\nall titles were omitted in the affiches of the two concerts, though\r\nOtto Jahn found one for the second meeting in the Fuchs Collection\r\nwhich contained them. It would seem that after one had been thus\r\nprinted it was after all rejected by Beethoven.\r\n\r\nThe rehearsals were now in progress. Dirzka was making good headway\r\nwith the choruses and was satisfied; Schuppanzigh was holding\r\nrehearsals for the strings in the rehearsal-room of the Ridotto;\r\nthe solo singers were studying under the supervision of Beethoven,\r\nsometimes in his lodgings, Umlauf assisting. Accustomed to Rossini’s\r\nmusic, the principal singers found it difficult to assimilate the\r\nBeethovenian manner, especially as it is exemplified in the concluding\r\nmovement of the symphony. They pleaded with the composer for changes\r\nwhich would lighten their labors, but he was adamant. Unger called\r\nhim a “tyrant over all the vocal organs” to his face, but when he\r\nstill refused to grant her petitions she turned to Sontag and said:\r\n“Well, then we must go on torturing ourselves in the name of God!” The\r\nchoirmaster requested that the passage in the fugue of the _Credo_\r\nwhere the sopranos enter on B-flat _in alt_ be altered, because none\r\nof the singers could reach the note; but though Umlauf reinforced that\r\nargument, a refusal was the only reply. In only one alteration did\r\nBeethoven acquiesce;--he changed the concluding passage of the bass\r\nrecitative, because Preisinger could not sing the high F-sharp; but\r\nPreisinger did not sing at all at the concert. The consequences of his\r\nobduracy were not realized by Beethoven at the concert, for though he\r\nstood among the performers and indicated the tempo at the beginning of\r\neach movement he could not hear the music except with his mental ear.\r\nThe obvious thing happened;--the singers who could not reach the high\r\ntones simply omitted them. Duport had allowed two full rehearsals.\r\nThere was to have been a third, but it was prevented by a rehearsal for\r\na ballet. At the final meeting on May 6, Beethoven was “dissolved in\r\ndevotion and emotion” at the performance of the _Kyrie_, and after the\r\nSymphony stationed himself at the door and embraced all the amateurs\r\nwho had taken part.[113] The official announcement of the concert read\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  GRAND\r\n  MUSICAL CONCERT\r\n  by\r\n  MR. L. VAN BEETHOVEN\r\n  which will take place\r\n  To-morrow, May 7, 1824\r\n  in the R. I. Court Theatre beside the Kärnthnerthor.\r\n\r\n    The musical pieces to be performed are the latest works of Mr.\r\n    Ludwig van Beethoven.\r\n\r\n    First: A Grand Overture.\r\n\r\n    Second: Three Grand Hymns with Solo and Chorus Voices.\r\n\r\n    Third: A Grand Symphony with Solo and Chorus Voices entering in the\r\n    finale on Schiller’s Ode to Joy.\r\n\r\n    The solos will be performed by the Demoiselles Sonntag and Unger\r\n    and the Messrs. Haizinger and Seipelt. Mr. Schuppanzigh has\r\n    undertaken the direction of the orchestra, Mr. Chapelmaster Umlauf\r\n    the direction of the whole and the Music Society the augmentation\r\n    of the chorus and orchestra as a favor.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Ludwig van Beethoven will himself participate in the general\r\n    direction.\r\n\r\n    Prices of admission as usual.\r\n\r\n    Beginning at 7 o’clock in the evening.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INCIDENTS OF THE PERFORMANCE]\r\n\r\nThe overture was that to “The Consecration of the House.” Duport had\r\na hand in the drafting of the announcement and wanted to include in\r\nit the statement that Beethoven would conduct with Umlauf. Schindler\r\nin reporting the fact to Beethoven added: “I did not know what to\r\nreply and so it was omitted this time. You _could_ surely conduct the\r\noverture alone. It would put too severe a strain upon your ears and for\r\nthat reason I would not advise you to conduct the whole.”\r\n\r\nThe theatre was crowded in every part except the imperial box; that\r\nwas empty. Beethoven had gone in person, accompanied by Schindler, to\r\ninvite the Imperial Family, and some of its members promised to attend;\r\nbut the Emperor and Empress had left Vienna a few days before and\r\nArchduke Rudolph, who had naturally displayed interest in the affair,\r\nwas in Olmütz. But we hear of several of Beethoven’s present and\r\nformer friends seated in various parts of the house;--poor, bedridden\r\nZmeskall was carried to his seat in a sedan chair. Some of the\r\nforemost musicians of Vienna were in the band--Mayseder, Böhm, Jansa,\r\nLinke, etc. The performance was far from perfect. There was lack of a\r\nhomogeneous power, a paucity of nuance, a poor distribution of lights\r\nand shades. Nevertheless, strange as the music must have sounded to the\r\naudience, the impression which it made was profound and the applause\r\nwhich it elicited enthusiastic to a degree. At one point in the\r\nScherzo, presumably at the startling entry of the tympani at the _ritmo\r\ndi tre battute_, the listeners could scarcely restrain themselves, and\r\nit seemed as if a repetition then and there would be insisted upon. To\r\nthis Beethoven, no doubt engrossed by the music which he was following\r\nin his mind, was oblivious. Either after the Scherzo or at the end\r\nof the Symphony,[114] while Beethoven was still gazing at his score,\r\nFräulein Unger, whose happiness can be imagined, plucked him by the\r\nsleeve and directed his attention to the clapping hands and waving hats\r\nand handkerchiefs. Then he turned to the audience and bowed.\r\n\r\nAfter the concert Beethoven’s friends, as was natural, came together to\r\nexchange comments and felicitate him. From Schindler Beethoven received\r\na report which is preserved in the Conversation Book. It gives us a\r\nglimpse of his own joy and the composer’s happy pride in having been\r\nmore enthusiastically greeted than the court:\r\n\r\n    Never in my life did I hear such frenetic and yet cordial\r\n    applause. Once the second movement of the Symphony was completely\r\n    interrupted by applause--and there was a demand for a repetition.\r\n    The reception was more than imperial--for the people burst out\r\n    in a storm 4 times. At the last there were cries of Vivat!--The\r\n    wind-instruments did very bravely--not the slightest disturbance\r\n    could be heard.--When the parterre broke out in applauding cries\r\n    the 5th time the Police Commissioner yelled Silence!--The court\r\n    only 3 successive times but Beethoven 5 times.--My triumph is now\r\n    attained; for now I can speak from my heart. Yesterday I still\r\n    feared secretly that the Mass would be prohibited because I heard\r\n    that the Archbishop had protested against it. After all I was right\r\n    in at first not saying anything to the Police Commissioner. By God,\r\n    it would have happened!--He surely never has been in the Court\r\n    Theatre. Well, _Pax tecum_!\r\n\r\nJoseph Hüttenbrenner went with Schindler when he escorted the composer\r\nto his lodgings. At this point there appears to be something like a\r\nflight of the imagination in Schindler’s narrative. Arrived at home\r\nSchindler hands Beethoven the box-office report. He takes it, gives\r\nit a glance and falls in a swoon. The two friends raise him from\r\nthe floor and carry him to a sofa, where he lies without uttering a\r\nword until far into the night. Then they observe that he has fallen\r\nasleep, and depart. Next morning Beethoven is found on the sofa,\r\nstill in his concert-clothes. Schindler should have taken a glance at\r\nthe Conversation Books before writing this dramatic story. There he\r\nwould have found a record of his own words which shows that he came\r\nto Beethoven on the day after the concert and asked him to send his\r\nnephew to meet him in the afternoon at the box-office of the theatre\r\nwhere the accounts were to be settled. He did not know what the\r\nreceipts were even then, for he remarks to Beethoven, “In Paris and\r\nLondon the concert would certainly have yielded from 12 to 15 thousand\r\nflorins; here it may be as many hundreds.” And then he goes on: “After\r\nyesterday you must now too plainly see that you are trampling upon\r\nyour own interests by remaining longer within these walls. In short, I\r\nhave no words to express my feelings at the wrong which you are doing\r\nyourself.... Have you recovered from yesterday’s exertions?”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRIENDS ACCUSED OF DISHONESTY]\r\n\r\nThe financial results of the concert fell far short of Beethoven’s\r\nexpectations. The gross receipts were 2200 florins in the depreciated\r\nVienna money, of which only 420 florins remained after paying the cost\r\nof administration and copying; and against this pitiful sum some petty\r\nexpenses were still chargeable. Beethoven was not only disappointed; he\r\nwas chagrined and thrown into a fuming ill-humor. He invited Schindler,\r\nUmlauf and Schuppanzigh to dine with him at the restaurant “Zum wilden\r\nMann” in the Prater. The composer came with his nephew; “his brow was\r\nclouded, his words were cold, peevish, captious,” says Schindler. He\r\nhad ordered an “opulent” meal, but no sooner had the party sat down to\r\nthe table than the “explosion which was imminent” came. In plainest\r\nterms he burst out with the charge that the management and Schindler\r\nhad cheated him. Umlauf and Schuppanzigh tried to convince him that\r\nthat was impossible, as every penny had passed through the hands of the\r\ntwo theatre cashiers, whose accounts tallied, and that though it was\r\ncontrary to custom, his nephew had acted in behalf of his brother as\r\ncomptroller. Beethoven persisted in his accusation, saying that he had\r\nhis information from an entirely credible source. Thereupon Schindler\r\nand Umlauf abruptly left the room. Schuppanzigh remained behind just\r\nlong enough to get a few stripes on his broad back and then joined\r\nhis companions in misery. Together they finished their meal at a\r\nrestaurant in the Leopoldstadt.[115] Schindler, after a disquisition\r\non Beethoven’s habit of estranging his friends by insulting them and\r\nthen winning them back by the frankness of his confessions and the\r\nsincerity of his contrition, says that after the composer’s return\r\nfrom Baden in November, he approached him in this winning mood, “and\r\nthe entire occurrence was at once drowned in the waters of Lethe.” But\r\nSchindler was not only in error as to the time of the incident--he\r\nsays it was after the second concert--he also seems to have forgotten\r\nthat he received a letter which on its face shows that he had written\r\nto Beethoven defending himself against the charges made. Beethoven’s\r\nletter was as follows:\r\n\r\n    I did not accuse you of any wrongdoing in connection with the\r\n    concert; but unwisdom and arbitrary actions spoiled much. Besides\r\n    I have a certain fear lest some great misfortune shall some time\r\n    happen to me through you. Clogged drains often open suddenly, and\r\n    that day in the Prater I thought you were offensive in several\r\n    things. Moreover there are many times when I would rather try to\r\n    repay the services which you perform for me with a little gift than\r\n    with a _meal_, for I admit that I am often too greatly disturbed.\r\n    If you do not see a pleasant face you say at once: “Bad weather\r\n    again to-day”; for being commonplace yourself how can you help\r\n    misunderstanding that which is not commonplace?\r\n\r\n    In short I love my independence too much. There will be no lack\r\n    of opportunities to invite you, but it is impossible to do so\r\n    continually, inasmuch as thereby all my affairs are disarranged.\r\n\r\n    Duport has consented to next Tuesday for the concert. For the\r\n    Landständischen Saal, which I might have had for to-morrow, he\r\n    again refuses to let me have the singers. He has also again\r\n    referred me to the police; therefore please go there with the bill\r\n    and learn if there is any objection to the second time. I would\r\n    never have accepted the favors done me gratis and will not. As for\r\n    friendship that is a difficult thing in your case. In no event\r\n    would I like to entrust my welfare to you since you lack judgment\r\n    and act arbitrarily, and I learned some time ago to know you from a\r\n    side which is not to your credit; and so did others. I must confess\r\n    that the purity of my character does not permit me to recompense\r\n    mere favors with friendship, although I am ready willingly to serve\r\n    your welfare.\r\n\r\n  B----n.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FINANCIAL FAILURE REPEATED]\r\n\r\nA second concert had been contemplated from the outset, or at least\r\nsince the opening of negotiations with Palfy. Schindler says that\r\nDuport offered to pay all expenses and guarantee 500 florins Convention\r\nCoin (1200 florins Vienna Standard) with the understanding that the\r\nprofits should be divided equally between Beethoven and the exchequer\r\nof the theatre. But he wanted a change made in the programme. To this\r\nchange, obviously designed as a concession to the popular taste,\r\nBeethoven seems to have given his consent. The concert took place\r\non Sunday, May 23rd, at midday--half-past 12 o’clock. Of the missal\r\nhymns only one, the _Kyrie_, was performed; between the overture and\r\nit Beethoven’s trio, “Tremate, empj, tremate,” was sung by Madame\r\nDardanelli and Signori Donzelli and Botticelli. The original solo\r\nsingers sang in the _Kyrie_ and the Symphony, which numbers were\r\nseparated by Rossini’s “Di tanti palpiti” in a transposed key sung by\r\nthe tenor David “almost throughout in a falsetto voice.” Schindler says\r\nthat Sontag also sang her favorite _aria di bravura_ by Mercadante, but\r\nof this number there is no mention on the _affiche_. The delightful\r\nweather lured the people into the open air, the house was not half full\r\nand there was, in consequence, a deficit of 800 florins. Nor was the\r\npopular demonstration of enthusiasm over the music so great as at the\r\nfirst concert, and Beethoven, who had not favored the repetition, was\r\nso disheartened that he was with difficulty persuaded to accept the\r\n500 florins which Duport had guaranteed to him. He was also vexed to\r\nfind his old trio announced as a novelty (it was composed more than\r\ntwenty years before and had been performed in 1814), and so was Tobias\r\nHaslinger, who had bought but had not published it. Moreover, Haslinger\r\nhad been overlooked in the distribution of complimentary tickets.\r\nBeethoven had to apologize to him for the oversight, which he protested\r\nwas due to an inadvertence, and also to explain that the announcement\r\nof the trio as a new work was of Duport’s doing, not his.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[106] Page 157 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[107] There are several stories touching the origin of the fugue-theme\r\nof the Scherzo of the D minor symphony, which may be given for what\r\nthey are worth. Czerny says that the theme occurred to Beethoven while\r\nlistening to the twittering of sparrows in a garden. Holz told Jahn\r\nthat one evening Beethoven was seated in the forest at Schönbrunn and\r\nin the gloaming fancied he saw all about him a multitude of gnomes\r\npopping in and out of their hiding-places; and this stirred his fancy\r\nto the invention of the theme. Another story has it that it flashed\r\ninto his mind with a sudden outbursting glitter of lights after he had\r\nlong been seated in the dark.\r\n\r\n[108] “Sinfonie at the beginning only 4 voices, 2 viol. viola, basso,\r\namongst them forte with other voices and if possible bring in all the\r\nother instruments one by one and gradually.”\r\n\r\n[109] Nottebohm fills the hiatus with “Trombones? Subjects?”\r\n\r\n[110] “Abgerissene Sätze wie Fürsten sind Bettler u. s. w.” The phrase\r\nis probably a record of Beethoven’s imperfect recollection of the line\r\n“_Bettler_ werden Fürstenbrüder,” which appeared in an early version\r\nof Schiller’s poem where now we read “_Alle Menschen werden Brüder_.”\r\nThe thought lies near that it was the early form of the poem, when\r\nit was still an “Ode to Freedom” (not “to Joy”), which first aroused\r\nenthusiastic admiration for it in Beethoven’s mind. In a Conversation\r\nBook of 1824 Bernard says to Beethoven: “In your text it reads,”\r\nfollowed by the observation, “All this is due here to the direction\r\nof the aristocracy”--which may or may not have connection with a\r\nconversation in which politics was playing a part.\r\n\r\n[111] So Thayer remarks.\r\n\r\n[112] For this assumption the present editor is alone responsible.\r\nThayer, who says nothing on the subject, corrects Schindler’s date to\r\nMarch 20, for no obvious reason.\r\n\r\n[113] The statement about the _Kyrie_ was made by Holz to Jahn; that\r\nabout the Symphony, by Fuchs.\r\n\r\n[114] The incident is variously related. Schindler and Fräulein Unger\r\n(the latter of whom told it to George Grove in London in 1869) say\r\nthat it took place at the end of the concert. Thalberg, the pianist,\r\nwho was present, says that it was after the Scherzo. A note amongst\r\nThayer’s papers reads: “November 23, 1860. I saw Thalberg in Paris.\r\nHe told me as follows: He was present at Beethoven’s concert in the\r\nKärnthnerthor Theatre 1824. Beethoven was dressed in black dress-coat,\r\nwhite neckerchief, and waistcoat, black satin small-clothes, black silk\r\nstockings, shoes with buckles. He saw after the Scherzo of the 9th\r\nsymphony, how B. stood turning over the leaves of his score utterly\r\ndeaf to the immense applause, and Unger pulled him by the sleeve and\r\nthen pointed to the audience when he turned and bowed. Umlauf told the\r\nchoir and orchestra to pay no attention whatever to Beethoven’s beating\r\nof the time but all to watch him. Conradin Kreutzer was at the P. F.”\r\nDid Thalberg describe Beethoven’s dress correctly? Evidently not. In\r\na conversation just before the concert Schindler, who is to call for\r\nBeethoven, tells him to make himself ready. “We will take everything\r\nwith us now; also take your green coat, which you can put on when you\r\nconduct. The theatre will be dark and no one will notice it.... O,\r\ngreat master, you do not own a black frock coat! The green one will\r\nhave to do; in a few days the black one will be ready.”\r\n\r\n[115] It is more than likely that Beethoven’s “credible” informant was\r\nhis brother Johann. He was jealous of Schindler’s participation in the\r\ncomposer’s business affairs and probably took advantage of a favorable\r\nopportunity to strengthen Beethoven’s chronic suspicion and growing\r\ndistrust of what the composer himself looked upon as Schindler’s\r\nofficiousness. In the Conversation Book used at the meeting after the\r\nconcert, Karl tells his uncle: “Schindler knows from an ear-witness\r\nthat your brother said in the presence of several persons that he was\r\nonly waiting for the concert to be over before driving S. out of the\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\n    Incidents and Labors of 1824--Bernard’s Oratorio--Visitors at\r\n    Baden--New Publishers--A Visitor from London--Beethoven’s Opinion\r\n    of his Predecessors--The Quartet in E-flat, Op. 127.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the chapter preceding the last, which recorded the doings\r\nof the year 1823, Beethoven was left in his lodgings in the Ungargasse,\r\noccupied with work upon the Ninth Symphony, which was approaching\r\ncompletion, oppressed with anxiety concerning his health and worried\r\nabout his brother’s domestic affairs. As the story of his life is\r\nresumed with the year 1824, there has been no serious change in his\r\nphysical condition, but complaints of ill health are frequent in his\r\ncommunications with his friends. His eyes continue to trouble him till\r\nlate in March; Schindler cautions him not to rub them, as that might\r\nincrease the inflammation; Karl suggests buying a shade to protect them\r\nfrom the glare of the light; and when Count Brunswick wants to take him\r\nalong with him to Hungary, Schindler advises him to take the trip, as\r\nit might be beneficial for his eyes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: KIND INTEREST IN KARL’S MOTHER]\r\n\r\nFor a moment we have a glimpse at the gentler side of the composer’s\r\nnature in a letter which he sends when the year is about a week old\r\nto the widow of his brother, the wicked mother of his adopted son,\r\nin lieu of the New Year’s call which they had been prevented by work\r\nfrom making. He should have come to wish her happiness for the year,\r\nhe says, had he been able: “but I know that, nevertheless, you expect\r\nnothing but the best of good wishes for your welfare from me as well\r\nas Karl.” She had complained of being in need, and he says he would\r\ngladly have helped her, but had himself too many expenditures, debts\r\nand delayed receipts to prove his willingness at the moment; but he\r\nwould now give it to her “in writing” that thenceforth she might retain\r\nthe portion of her pension which had been set apart for her son. If,\r\nin the future, he could give her money to better her condition, he\r\nwould willingly do so; moreover, he had long before assumed the debt\r\nof 280 florins and 20 kreutzers which she owed Steiner. Manifestly a\r\ntruce had been established between the woman and her brother-in-law,\r\nand in the absence of any evidence that she was in any way concerned\r\nin an escapade of Karl’s later in the year, it would appear that she\r\nnever violated it; it was not the woman whom Beethoven hated, but the\r\nyouth whom he loved, who brought grief and an almost broken heart into\r\nhis last days. Nevertheless, there is more than passive contentment\r\nexhibited in this letter; there is also an active magnanimity which\r\nfinds even warmer expression in a letter which he seems to have written\r\nat an earlier date to his friend Bernard. Bernard[116] had been helpful\r\nto Beethoven in drawing up the memorial to the court in the matter of\r\nthe guardianship and was among the friends whom Beethoven consulted\r\nabout Karl’s education and bringing up. To him Beethoven writes:\r\n\r\n    I beg of you before the day is over to make inquiries about F. v.\r\n    B. [Frau van Beethoven] and if it is possible, to have her assured\r\n    through her physician that from this month on _so long as I shall\r\n    live_ she shall have the enjoyment of the whole of her pension,\r\n    and I will see to it that if I die first, Karl shall not need the\r\n    half of her pension. It was, moreover, always my intention to\r\n    permit her to keep the whole of her pension so soon as Karl left\r\n    the Institute, but as her illness and need are so great she must be\r\n    helped at once. God has never deserted me in this heavy task and I\r\n    shall continue to trust in Him. If possible I beg of you to send\r\n    me information yet to-day and I will see to it that my _tenacious\r\n    brother also makes a contribution_ to her.\r\n\r\nThe nephew was now attending the philological lectures at the\r\nuniversity and living in the winter and spring months with his uncle.\r\nHe had left Blöchlinger’s Institute in August 1823 and matriculated\r\nat the university. He was active in the service of Beethoven, doing\r\nwork as his amanuensis, carrying messages, making purchases, and so\r\non; in fact, Beethoven seems to have taken up more of his time than\r\nwas good for his studies. He loved him tenderly and was unceasingly\r\nthoughtful of his welfare; but the jealousy of his affection led him\r\nto exercise a strictness of discipline over him which could not fail\r\nto become irksome to a growing stripling. He left him little liberty,\r\nand, yielding to a disposition prone to passion, he not seldom treated\r\nhim with great severity. The youth appears in the Conversation Books as\r\nlively, clever and shrewd, and Beethoven, proud of his natural gifts\r\nof mind, was indulgent of his comments on others, permitting him\r\napparently to speak lightly and discourteously of the men upon whose\r\nhelp and counsel he was obliged to depend. The result of Beethoven’s\r\nextremes of harsh rebuke and loving admonition, of violent accusation\r\nand tender solicitude, was to encourage him in his innate bent for\r\ndisingenuousness and deception, and he continued the course which he\r\nhad begun as a boy of repeating words of disparagement touching those\r\nagainst whom his uncle levelled his criticisms, and of reporting, no\r\ndoubt with embellishments of his own invention, the speeches which told\r\nof the popular admiration in which the great composer was held. By\r\nthis species of flattery he played upon the weakness of his uncle and\r\nactually obtained an influence over him in the course of time which he\r\nexploited to his own advantage in various directions. He was naturally\r\ninclined to indolence and self-indulgence, and it is not strange that\r\nBeethoven’s self-sacrifice in his behalf never awakened in him any deep\r\nsense of gratitude, while his unreasonable and ill-considered severity\r\naroused a spirit of rebellion in him which grew with his advance\r\ntowards adolescence. Beethoven never seems to have realized that he had\r\noutgrown the period when he could be treated as a child, and it was a\r\nchild’s submission which he asked of him.\r\n\r\nGrillparzer’s opera-book was a frequent subject of conversation between\r\nBeethoven and his friends in the early months of 1824, but petitions\r\nand advice were alike unfruitful. He did not go to work upon it nor\r\nyet upon a composition which presented a more urgent obligation. This\r\nwas the oratorio which he had agreed to write for the Gesellschaft\r\nder Musikfreunde and on which he had received an advance of money in\r\n1819. Here the fatal procrastination, though it may have been agreeable\r\nto Beethoven, was not altogether his fault. Bernard began the book,\r\nbut seems to have put it aside after a few weeks. In April, 1820, he\r\ntells Beethoven in a Conversation Book, “I must finish the oratorio\r\ncompletely this month so that it may be handed to you in Mödling.” In\r\nAugust, possibly, somebody writes: “I have put it seriously to _Sanctus\r\nBernardus_ that it is high time that it be done; that Hauschka was\r\nurging a completion. He will finish it this month, _id est_ in 5 days,\r\nand see you this evening at Camehl’s.... When I told Bernard that\r\nHauschka had come to you about it he was embarrassed and--it seems to\r\nme that he is throwing the blame on you. He does not want to show his\r\npoetical impotency.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: GROWING IMPATIENCE ABOUT AN ORATORIO]\r\n\r\nFor four years after giving the commission, the Gesellschaft der\r\nMusikfreunde waited before it put any signs of impatience on record.\r\nTowards the close of October, 1823, Bernard gave a copy of the text\r\nof the oratorio, which was entitled “Der Sieg des Kreutzes” (“The\r\nVictory of the Cross”), to Beethoven and also one to Sonnleithner for\r\nthe society. After waiting nearly three months, the directorate of the\r\nsociety at a meeting held on January 9, 1824, took action, the nature\r\nof which was notified to both Beethoven and Bernard. The latter was\r\ninformed that as the society had left the choice of the text which\r\nhe was to compose to Beethoven, it could not say whether or not the\r\nsociety would make use of the poem which he had sent until Beethoven\r\nhad set it to music, and the censor had given it his sanction. He was\r\nalso asked to coöperate with the society in stimulating Beethoven to\r\nfinish the work “so long expected by the musical world.” Beethoven\r\nwas told that the choice of a book for the oratorio which the society\r\nhad commissioned him to write four years before had been left to him;\r\nthat it had been informed that Bernard had undertaken to write it;\r\nthat its inquiries as to when the music would be completed had always\r\nbeen answered by the statement that the poem had not been received.\r\nNot presuming to ask a composer of his eminence to outline the plan\r\nof a musical composition before he had become familiar with the work\r\nas a whole and had satisfied himself touching its plan and execution,\r\nthe society, therefore, had thitherto always directed its inquiries to\r\nBernard, who had delivered the book in October. In view of the fact\r\nthat the society could not use the text until it had been set and he\r\n(Beethoven) had repeatedly expressed his intention to write a work\r\nof the kind and confirmed the receipt of earnest money paid at his\r\nrequest, the society asked him explicitly to say whether or not he\r\nintended to compose Bernard’s poem, and, if so, when the work might be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nBeethoven answered the letter at great length. He said that he had not\r\nasked Bernard to write the text but had been told that the society had\r\ncommissioned him to do so; Bernard being the editor of a newspaper it\r\nwas impossible for him to consult him often; moreover, consultations\r\nof this character would be long drawn out and personally disagreeable,\r\nas Bernard had written nothing for music except “Libussa,” which had\r\nnot been performed at the time, but which he had known since 1809 and\r\nwhich had required many alterations; he was compelled to be somewhat\r\nskeptical about the collaboration and have the book before him in its\r\nentirety. He had once received a portion of the book, but Bernard, to\r\nthe best of his recollection, had said that it would have to be changed\r\nand he had given it back to him. At last he had received the whole\r\ntext at the time that the society received it, but other obligations\r\nwhich illness had retarded had had to be fulfilled, since, as the\r\nsociety probably knew, he was compelled to live from his compositions.\r\nMany changes, some of which he had indicated to Bernard, would have to\r\nbe made in the book. He would finish his suggestions and consult with\r\nBernard, for,\r\n\r\n    though I find the material good and the poem has a value, it cannot\r\n    remain _as it is_. The poet and I wrote “Christus am Ölberg” in\r\n    14 days, but that poet was musical and had written several things\r\n    for music and I could consult with him at any moment. Let us leave\r\n    out of consideration _the value_ of poems of this sort; we all\r\n    know what allowances are to be made--the merit lies in the middle.\r\n    So far as I am concerned I would rather set Homer, Klopstock,\r\n    Schiller to music; if they offer difficulties to be overcome _these\r\n    immortal poets_ at least deserve it. As soon as I am through with\r\n    making changes in the oratorio with Bernard I shall have the honor\r\n    to inform you of the fact and at the same time let the society\r\n    know when it may with certainty count upon it. That is all that I\r\n    can say about it at present. Respecting the 400 florins, Vienna\r\n    standard, sent to me _without demand_ I would have sent them back\r\n    long ago had I been able to foresee that the matter would last\r\n    much longer than I had imagined; it was grievous to me not to\r\n    be able to express myself on the subject. Concerning it I had a\r\n    notion, in order to provide at least the interest on the sum, to\r\n    unite with the society in a concert; but neither Herr Schindler\r\n    nor my brother was authorized to say anything on the subject, and\r\n    it was farthest from my thoughts that it should be done _in such a\r\n    manner_. Please inform Herrn von Sonnleithner of this. I also thank\r\n    the society heartily for the offer of the platform and its aid\r\n    which it proffered me and in time I shall make use of them. I shall\r\n    be glad to hear whether the society wishes to make use of my works\r\n    after my concert, among which is a new symphony. The Grand Mass is\r\n    really rather in the oratorio style and particularly adapted to the\r\n    society. I shall be especially pleased if my unselfishness and also\r\n    my zealous desire to serve the society in whose benevolent deeds in\r\n    behalf of art I always take the greatest interest, are recognized.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note in connection with this letter that Beethoven\r\nresents the statement that he had asked for the money given as an\r\nearnest; that he was unwilling to assume responsibility for the\r\nselection of Bernard as his collaborator (though Bernard was among his\r\nfriends and advisors and he had expressed satisfaction with his choice\r\nwhen he accepted the commission, only insisting that the poet be paid\r\nby the society); that he gave at least moderate approval to the book as\r\na whole but insisted on some alterations which were essential; that he\r\nhad been contemplating co-operation with the society in a concert, and\r\nthat he had received an offer of assistance from it in a concert which\r\nhe was to give. The letter was written on January 23, some time before\r\nthe receipt of the memorial which was the first official step toward\r\nthe great concerts of May 7 and 23. There is evidence of a kindly\r\nfeeling between the society and him, and, indeed, that feeling was\r\nnever interrupted, though the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde never got\r\nthe oratorio nor received back the money advanced on its commission.\r\nThe society afterward elected him to honorary membership.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CONTRADICTORY ADVICE AS TO BERNARD’S BOOK]\r\n\r\nBeethoven was frequently urged to set to work on the music of “The\r\nVictory of the Cross”; but he was also advised not to compose it.\r\nArchduke Rudolph accepted the dedication of the poem and wrote to\r\nBeethoven telling him of the fact and expressing a wish that he would\r\nset it to music. But Schikh said to him: “If I were Beethoven I would\r\nnever compose the extremely tiresome text of this oratorio.” Beethoven\r\nhad expressed satisfaction with the subject and the quality of the\r\nlines; he discussed changes which he wished to have made with Bernard\r\nafter he had had time to consider the work as a whole; he promised\r\nHauschka in September that he would compose it as soon as he returned\r\nto the city, and asked him to pay Bernard his fee; but he never set\r\nseriously to work upon it, though at the end of the letter to Hauschka\r\n(which bears date September 23, 1824) he reiterated his promise so that\r\nhe might, with mock solemnity, attest it by affixing his hand and seal.\r\n\r\nThe book of “The Victory of the Cross” was based upon the ancient story\r\nof the apparition of the cross and the legend “_In hoc signo vinces_”\r\nto Constantine the Great. _Constantine_ has crossed the Alps into Italy\r\nand lies encamped confronting his enemy _Maxentius_ before Rome. His\r\ndaughter _Julia_, who is represented as wife to _Maxentius_, attempts\r\nto avert the battle, but the vision strengthens _Constantine’s_\r\nresolve. _Julia_ hears the angelic canticles which accompany the\r\napparition and is converted to the true faith, persisting in it to\r\nmartyrdom, to which she is condemned by her husband. _Maxentius_ also\r\nhears the voices, but his augurs (allegorical figures representing\r\n_Hate_ and _Discord_) interpret them to his advantage, whereas similar\r\nfigures (_Faith_, _Hope_ and _Charity_) inspire the Christian army.\r\nPious canticles on the one hand, harsh songs on the other, precede the\r\nbattle, the progress of which is related by a solo voice. _Constantine_\r\npromises to raise the cross on the forum in Rome; the victory is won\r\nand celebrated with Christian hymns, “Hosanna!” and “Glory to God!”\r\nBeethoven’s copy of the libretto has been preserved, and in it there\r\nare indications that he made some heroic excisions. He permitted\r\n_Faith_, _Hope_ and _Charity_ to remain, but banished _Hate_ and\r\n_Discord_. It is pretty plain that Beethoven found nothing inspiring in\r\nthe work. Holz told Jahn that he said to him, “How could I get up any\r\nenthusiasm about it?” Schindler says that Beethoven’s failure to set\r\nthe book caused a rupture of the friendship which existed between him\r\nand Bernard. The directors of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde dropped\r\nthe matter, neither importuning Beethoven more nor taking any steps to\r\nrecover the money paid on account.\r\n\r\nOne outcome of the concerts of May was the appearance of a new\r\nportrait of Beethoven. It was a lithographic reproduction of a crayon\r\ndrawing made by Stephen Decker and was printed as a supplement to the\r\n“Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung” edited by F. A. Kanne, on June 6,\r\n1824. In this and two subsequent numbers of the journal (June 9 and 16)\r\nKanne reviewed the concerts with discriminating appreciation, ending\r\nwith an enthusiastic encomium of the composer. In 1827 Steinmüller made\r\na plate of Decker’s drawing for Artaria. Schindler and Frimmel agree\r\nin saying that the well-known portrait by Kriehuber is an imitation of\r\nDecker’s drawing, which was made, as Kanne’s journal stated, “a few\r\ndays after his great concert in May, 1824.”[117]\r\n\r\nDuring the preparations for the concerts, thought was also given to\r\nthe usual summer sojourn, and various places--Grinzing, Heiligenstadt,\r\nPenzing, Breitensee, Hietzing, Hetzendorf--were canvassed in\r\nconsultation with Beethoven by his friends. His brother had again\r\noffered him a home on his estate and it was expected that Count\r\nBrunswick would come for the concert and take Beethoven back with him\r\nto Hungary. In all of the excursions which were made in the vicinity\r\nof Schönbrunn in search of a summer home, Schindler accompanied the\r\ncomposer to see, to advise, to negotiate. The choice fell upon Penzing,\r\nwhere an apartment was found in the first storey of the house numbered\r\n43 belonging to a tailor in Vienna named Johann Hörr, who was rejoiced\r\nto have so distinguished a tenant. Beethoven took it for the summer\r\nbeginning on May 1, for a rental of 180 florins, C. M. The receipt is\r\nin existence, with a characteristic memorial of Beethoven’s violent\r\nand abrupt change of mind concerning men and things. The lodgings were\r\nin all things adapted to his needs and Beethoven, entirely satisfied,\r\nmoved into them soon after the second concert. An old couple lived in\r\nthe parterre, but otherwise he was the only tenant of the house. But\r\nthe house lay close to a foot-bridge over the little stream called\r\nthe Wien Fluss and people crossing it frequently stopped to gaze\r\ninto his rooms. He could have saved himself the annoyance by drawing\r\nthe curtains, but instead he flew into a rage, quarrelled with his\r\nlandlord, against whom he recorded his anger by scrawling the epithet\r\n“Schurke” (rogue, wretch, scoundrel, etc.) under his name on the\r\nreceipt, and removing to Baden (Gutenbrunn). He had been in the house\r\nsix weeks; in Baden he staid from about the 1st of August till some\r\ntime in November; and thus was again paying rent for three lodgings at\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TWO NEW OFFERS OF THE MASS IN D]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Schott and Sons Buy the Mass]\r\n\r\nThe matter of the subscriptions for the Mass being disposed of (except\r\nso far as the deliveries of some of the scores was concerned), and\r\nthe Symphony completed, Beethoven now had time, while getting ready\r\nfor their performance, to think also of their publication. As he had\r\npromised to deliver the Mass to Simrock long before, so also he had\r\ncontracted to give exclusive possession of the Symphony for eighteen\r\nmonths to the Philharmonic Society of London, in March, 1823. It was\r\neleven months after that date that the score was finished and thirteen\r\nmonths before it was placed in the hands of the Philharmonic Society’s\r\nagent in Vienna. Hogarth in his history of the Philharmonic Society is\r\nonly technically correct when he says that it was not “received” by the\r\nsociety until “after it had been performed at Vienna.” It was handed\r\nto Ries’s representative on April 26 or 27, 1824; the first concert\r\ntook place on May 7th. When Beethoven took up the matter of publication\r\nagain he ignored Simrock, Peters, Schlesinger and the Vienna publishers\r\nand turned to Schott and Sons of Mayence and H. A. Probst of Leipsic.\r\nSchott and Sons had sent him their journal “Cäcilia” with the request\r\nthat he recommend a correspondent in the Austrian capital, and also\r\nsend them some compositions for publication. He answered on March 10,\r\n1824, that he would gladly serve the paper if it were not that he\r\nfelt it to be a higher and more natural calling to manifest himself\r\nthrough his musical compositions; but he had instigated a search for\r\na fit man to act as Viennese reviewer. Of his compositions he offered\r\n“a new Grand Mass with solo and chorus and full orchestra” which he\r\nconsidered his “greatest work,” and a new Grand Symphony with a finale\r\nin the style of his Pianoforte Fantasia with chorus “but on a much\r\nlarger scale”; also a new quartet for strings.[118] The fees demanded\r\nwere 1000 florins C. M. for the Mass, 600 florins for the Symphony and\r\n50 ducats for the Quartet. “This business only to oblige you.” On the\r\nsame day he wrote to H. A. Probst offering the Mass and Symphony at\r\nthe same prices but stipulating that the latter should not be published\r\nbefore July, 1825, though, to recompense the publisher for the delay,\r\nhe would let him have the pianoforte arrangement _gratis_. Only a\r\nportion of this letter has been preserved, but the contents of the lost\r\nfragment can be gathered from Probst’s answer under date March 22, in\r\nwhich he promises to deposit at once with Joseph Loydl and Co. 100\r\nimperial ducats to Beethoven’s account, to be paid over on delivery of\r\nthree songs with pianoforte accompaniment (two of them to have parts\r\nfor other instruments, the third to be an arietta), six bagatelles\r\nfor pianoforte solo, and a grand overture with pianoforte arrangement\r\nfor 2 and 4 hands. What these works were may easily be guessed. After\r\nthis business had been arranged to the satisfaction of both parties,\r\nProbst said, he would communicate his decision respecting the Mass.\r\nBeethoven wrote, probably on July 3, explaining his delay on the score\r\nthat the compositions “had just been finished” but were now ready for\r\ndelivery at any moment to Herrn Glöggl, to whom he requested that the\r\nmoney be sent. On August 9, Probst informed Beethoven that the 100\r\nducats had already been sent to Loydl and Co., in Vienna. A letter\r\nwritten by Beethoven on the same day has been lost, but a portion of\r\nits contents can be deduced from Probst’s reply a week later--August\r\n16. The Leipsic publisher admitted that his action in depositing the\r\nmoney to be delivered in exchange for the manuscripts had been due\r\nto reports which had reached him touching difficulties which another\r\npublisher had had with the composer. In purchasing manuscripts without\r\nexamination he was departing from his established rule of action and\r\nhe trusted to the admiration which he felt for the composer’s genius\r\nthat the latter had set apart works of excellence for him. He would\r\ngladly have published the Symphony, but was deterred by the danger of\r\npiracy which was peculiarly great in Austria. He promised a speedy and\r\nhandsome publication of the works purchased. A memorandum by Beethoven\r\nindicates that he answered this letter, but the nature of his reply\r\nis not known. It is to be presumed that he withdrew his offer of the\r\nSymphony. The correspondence with Probst ended and the negotiations,\r\nwhich had again reached the point of a deposit of the fee against the\r\ndelivery of the manuscripts, came to nothing; Schott and Sons secured\r\nnot only the Mass, Symphony and Quartet, but the smaller pieces also.\r\nThe firm accepted the offer of the Quartet at once, but asked either a\r\nreduction of the fees for the Symphony and Mass, or permission to pay\r\nthe money in installments at intervals of six months. Subsequently the\r\nfirm offered to provide a guaranty for the deferred payments and to\r\nconsider any proposition which Beethoven had to make. The two letters,\r\ndated respectively March 24 and April 10, remaining unanswered,\r\nSchott and Sons again wrote on April 19 and still again on April 27;\r\nintroducing with the former letter Christian Rummel, Chapelmaster of\r\nthe Duke of Nassau, and asking a contribution to “Cäcilia” in the\r\nlatter. In the midst of his preparations for the concert, Beethoven\r\nreplied and repeated his offer of the Mass and Symphony, but held the\r\nmatter of the Quartet in abeyance. He asked that payment for the other\r\nworks be made by bills drawn on a Vienna bank payable 600 florins in\r\none month, 500 florins in two months and 600 florins in four months.\r\nOn July 3 he also conceded the Quartet, which he promised to deliver\r\ninside of six weeks. With this the business was concluded and, as an\r\nundated letter of Beethoven’s shows, much to his gratification; the\r\nbusiness methods of Schott and Sons were extremely satisfactory to him.\r\nBut the year came to an end, and the Mayence publishers were still\r\nwaiting for their manuscripts, while Beethoven was kept busy writing\r\nexplanations in answer to their questions and requests. On September 17\r\nBeethoven says he will attend to the copying of the works as soon as he\r\nhas returned to Vienna, and send the Quartet by the middle of October;\r\nin November he is obliged to give two lessons a day to Archduke Rudolph\r\nand has no time to look after the matter; on December 5 the works are\r\nmost certainly to be delivered to Fries and Co. within the current\r\nweek; on December 17 it will be another week before the works can be\r\ndelivered--the Archduke has but gone and he must look through the copy\r\nof the score several times--and he begs his correspondents not to\r\nthink ill of him, for he had “never done anything wrong,” intimating\r\nthat a certain publisher in Vienna was trying to seduce him from the\r\nMayence firm and to that end was seeking to make them suspicious,\r\netc.; meanwhile he offers for publication the overture which had been\r\nperformed at his concert, six bagatelles and three songs in behalf of\r\nhis brother to whom they belong, the price 130 ducats in gold. These\r\nwere the works which Probst had agreed to purchase for 100 ducats and\r\nthe money for which had been sent to Vienna. Schott agreed to buy them\r\nfor 130 ducats and Beethoven wrote to his brother in Gneixendorf on\r\nDecember 24: “I inform you that Mayence will give 130 ducats in gold\r\nfor your works: if Herr Probst will not pay as much, give them to\r\nMayence, who will at once send you a cheque; these are really honest,\r\nnot mean, business men.” Johann promptly put himself in communication\r\nwith Schott and Sons and graciously confirmed the sale of the works at\r\n130 florins, “out of respect” for his brother.\r\n\r\nPeters, who had been informed of the state of affairs concerning the\r\nMass, evidently sent a complaint, or protest, to Beethoven, for on\r\nDecember 12, 1824, the latter informs the publisher that the case\r\nhas been closed by his promise of the work to another publisher. He\r\n(Peters) should have received a quartet had the publishers who took\r\nthe Mass not made the Quartet a condition of his acceptance. But he\r\nshould surely have another quartet soon, or he was ready to make him\r\na proposition for a larger work, in which case the sum which had been\r\npaid might be deducted from the new fee. Let Peters but be patient and\r\nhe should be completely satisfied. Then follows this rebuke:\r\n\r\n    You did wrong to _yourself_ and _to me_, and you are still doing\r\n    the latter in, as I hear, accusing me of having sent you _inferior_\r\n    works. Did you not yourself ask for songs and bagatelles? Afterward\r\n    it occurred to you that the fee was too large and that a larger\r\n    work might have been had for it. That you showed yourself to be a\r\n    poor judge of art in this is proved by the fact that several of\r\n    these works have been and will be published, and such a thing never\r\n    happened to me before.[119] As soon as I can I will liquidate my\r\n    indebtedness to you, and meanwhile I remain, etc.\r\n\r\nIn September of this year the interest of Beethoven’s old friend\r\nAndreas Streicher, whose wife was a visitor at Baden, seems to have\r\nbeen awakened in a marked degree, and he gave himself to the devising\r\nof plans to ameliorate the composer’s financial position. He revived\r\nthe project for a complete edition of the compositions which, as he\r\noutlines it, he thinks might yield a profit of 10,000 florins, good\r\nmoney; proposes six high-class subscription concerts in the approaching\r\nwinter, which, with 600 subscribers, would yield 4,800 florins; finally\r\nhe suggests that manuscript copies of the Mass in D with pianoforte\r\nor organ accompaniment be sold to a number of singing societies.\r\nThough this project had in a measure been attempted in the case of\r\nthe Singverein of Berlin and achieved in that of the Cäcilienverein\r\nof Frankfort, Beethoven seems to have authorized Streicher to make an\r\neffort in the direction proposed, for two copies of a letter evidently\r\nwritten to be communicated to singing societies or representative\r\nmembers have been found. In the letter Beethoven suggests that owing to\r\nthe cost of copying, etc., the price be 50 ducats--just as much as he\r\nhad asked of his royal subscribers for the full orchestral score. None\r\nof the projects came to execution, though the first, which lay close\r\nto Beethoven’s heart, came up for attention at a later date.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PRAISE FOR ENGLAND AND THE ENGLISH]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of September, Johann Stumpff, a native of Thuringia but\r\na resident of London, was among the visitors at Baden who were admitted\r\nto intimate association with Beethoven. This was another Stumpff, not\r\nthe one who came to Vienna in 1818 with a letter from Thomas Broadwood,\r\nand who tuned the new English pianoforte. He was a manufacturer of\r\nharps and an enthusiastic admirer of Beethoven’s music. Anticipating\r\na meeting with the composer, he had provided himself with a letter of\r\nintroduction to Haslinger, whose help to that end he asked. He had\r\nalso gotten a letter from Streicher, whose acquaintance he had made\r\nin London. He accomplished his end and wrote a long and enthusiastic\r\naccount of his intercourse with Beethoven at Baden, whither Haslinger\r\nhad accompanied him on his first visit.[120] He was received by\r\nBeethoven with extraordinary cordiality. The composer accepted an\r\ninvitation to dinner, entertained his host at dinner in return, played\r\nfor him on his Broadwood pianoforte (after Stein, at Stumpff’s request,\r\nhad restored its ruins), and at parting gave him a print of one of\r\nhis portraits and promised to alight at his house if ever he came to\r\nLondon. Much of his conversation, which Stumpff records, is devoted to\r\na condemnation of the frivolity and bad musical taste of the Viennese,\r\nand excessive laudation of everything English. “Beethoven,” Stumpff\r\nremarks, “had an exaggerated opinion of London and its highly cultured\r\ninhabitants,” and he quotes Beethoven as saying: “England stands high\r\nin culture. In London everybody knows something and knows it well; but\r\nthe man of Vienna can only talk of eating and drinking, and sings and\r\npounds away at music of little significance or of his own making.” He\r\nspoke a great deal about sending his nephew to London to make a man of\r\nhim, asked questions about the cost of living there and, in short, gave\r\nproof that an English visit was filling a large part of his thoughts.\r\nThe incidents of the conclusion of the dinner which he gave to Stumpff\r\nmay be told in the latter’s words:\r\n\r\n    Beethoven now produced the small bottle. It contained the precious\r\n    wine of Tokay with which he filled the two glasses to the brim.\r\n    “Now, my good German-Englishman, to your good health.” We drained\r\n    the glasses, then, extending his hand, “A good journey to you\r\n    and to a meeting again in London.” I beckoned to him to fill\r\n    the glasses again and hurriedly wrote in his notebook: “Now\r\n    for a pledge to the welfare of the greatest living composer,\r\n    Beethoven.”--I arose from my chair, he followed my example, emptied\r\n    his glass and seizing my hand said: “To-day I am just what I am\r\n    and what I ought to be,--all unbuttoned.” And now he unbosomed\r\n    himself on the subject of music which had been degraded and made a\r\n    plaything of vulgar and impudent passions. “True music,” he said,\r\n    “found little recognition in this age of Rossini and his consorts.”\r\n    Thereupon I took up the pencil and wrote in very distinct letters:\r\n\r\n    “Whom do you consider the greatest composer that ever lived?”\r\n\r\n    “Handel,” was his instantaneous reply; “to him I bow the knee,” and\r\n    he bent one knee to the floor.\r\n\r\n    “Mozart,” I wrote.\r\n\r\n    “Mozart,” he continued, “is good and admirable.”\r\n\r\n    “Yes,” wrote I, “who was able to glorify even Handel with his\r\n    additional accompaniments to ‘The Messiah’.”\r\n\r\n    “It would have lived without them,” was his answer.\r\n\r\n    I continued writing. “Seb. Bach.”\r\n\r\n    “Why is he dead?”\r\n\r\n    I answered immediately “He will return to life again.”\r\n\r\n    “Yes, if he is studied, and for that there is now no time.”\r\n\r\n    I took the liberty of writing: “As you yourself, a peerless artist\r\n    in the art of music, exalt the merits of Handel so highly above\r\n    all, you must certainly own the scores of his principal works.”\r\n\r\n    “I? How should I, a poor devil, have gotten them? Yes, the scores\r\n    of ‘The Messiah’ and ‘Alexander’s Feast’ went through my hands.”\r\n\r\n    If it is possible for a blind man to help a cripple, and the two\r\n    attain an end which would be impossible to either one unaided, why\r\n    might not in the present case a similar result be effected by a\r\n    similar coöperation? At that moment I made a secret vow: Beethoven,\r\n    you shall have the works for which your heart is longing if they\r\n    are anywhere to be found.\r\n\r\nStumpff relates that Beethoven’s brother, who came into the room during\r\nhis visit, seemed glad to greet him and begged him most amiably to call\r\non him, as he desired to talk with him about a number of things. In\r\nsaying farewell Beethoven accompanied him to the door and said: “That\r\nis my brother--have nothing to do with him--he is not an honest man.\r\nYou will hear me accused of many wrong actions of which he has been\r\nguilty.” Stumpff returned to London on December 6. He fulfilled his vow\r\ntouching the gift of Handel’s works two years later.\r\n\r\nOn November 17, 1824, as the autograph attests, Beethoven wrote a\r\nfour-part canon on the words “Schwenke dich ohne Schwänke,” which he\r\nsent to Schott and Sons for publication in the “Cäcilia,” where it\r\nappeared in April, 1825. There the title is “Canon on one who was\r\ncalled Schwenke.” The person whose name has thus been perpetuated\r\nwas Carl Schwenke, son of Christian Friedrich Gottlieb Schwenke,\r\nDirector of Church Music and Cantor at the Johanneum in Hamburg. Of the\r\nacquaintanceship between Beethoven and him, the canon is the only relic.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the summer Beethoven accepted a commission from\r\nDiabelli for “a Sonata in F for pianoforte, four hands.” The project\r\nseems to have originated with the publisher, who asked for such a\r\ncomposition and specified the key in a letter dated August 7, 1824.\r\nBeethoven waited a fortnight before replying and then agreed to compose\r\nthe work for a fee of 80 ducats in gold, although a sonata for four\r\nhands was not in his line. He mentioned the composition and the fee\r\nwhich he was to receive for it in the draft for a letter to Schlesinger\r\nnext year, but never wrote the work; nor have any certain traces of it\r\nbeen found in the sketchbooks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Quartet in E-flat, Op. 127]\r\n\r\nThere is only one other work which calls for attention as having\r\nlargely occupied Beethoven’s mind this year. It is the Quartet for\r\nStrings in E-flat, Op. 127. When Beethoven in January, 1823, accepted\r\nthe invitation of Prince Galitzin to write three quartets for him, he\r\nhad for some time been contemplating a return to the field which he had\r\ncultivated so successfully but had permitted to lie fallow after the\r\ncompletion of the quartet in F minor, Op. 95, in October, 1810. He had\r\nheld out a promise for speedy delivery of a quartet to Peters on June\r\n5, 1822, but Peters declined the work in his next letter. Galitzin sent\r\nthe stipulated fee of 50 ducats promptly to his bankers in Vienna, but\r\nsubsequently yielded to Beethoven’s request and permitted the money\r\nto be applied to his subscription for the Mass. On March 10, 1824,\r\nBeethoven offered “a new quartet” to Schott and Sons for 50 ducats\r\nand the publishers promptly notified their acceptance of the offer to\r\nhim. Neate was informed by a letter dated March 19 that the Quartet\r\nwas finished; but, as usual, the word was used in a Pickwickian sense.\r\nThe correspondence with Schott and Sons sings the same tune with\r\nrespect to the Quartet that it does regarding Mass and Symphony. On\r\nMay 20 Beethoven cannot positively promise it; on July 3 he is sure\r\nthat the publishers will receive it in six weeks; on September 17 the\r\ntime of delivery is postponed to the middle of October; in November to\r\nthe beginning of December; and on December 17 he says there is still\r\nsomething to be written on it. All the works which Schott and Sons have\r\nbought are to be delivered at one time, yet when they receive the Mass\r\nand Symphony on January 16, 1825, the Quartet is withheld but promised\r\nin another week, and, after a month has passed, in still another\r\nweek. The Quartet is performed for the first time by Schuppanzigh on\r\nMarch 6, 1825. At last Beethoven writes to Schott and Sons on May 7,\r\n1825: “You will have received the Quartet by this time--it is the one\r\npromised to you.” In March, 1826, its publication is announced in the\r\n“Cäcilia.” The autograph of the first movement is dated “1824” and no\r\ndoubt the bulk of the work upon it was done in the latter part of the\r\nyear, though it must have existed at least in a fragmentary form in\r\nBeethoven’s head when he wrote to Neate in March that it was finished.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the year Beethoven’s nephew Karl is still pursuing\r\nhis philological studies at the university and living with his uncle.\r\nDuring the summer his holidays are spent in the country with Beethoven,\r\nto whom he is the cause of no little anxiety, especially when towards\r\nthe end of the year he repeats his youthful escapade of running away\r\nfrom home. Beethoven, thinking of his foster-child’s welfare and\r\napparently made ill at ease by symptoms which made him apprehend that\r\nhe was likely to die suddenly of an apoplectic stroke (“like my good\r\ngrandfather, whom I resemble,” he wrote), sent a letter to Dr. Bach\r\non August 1, begging him to draw up a formal will and reiterating his\r\nintention to make his nephew inheritor of all his property. He also\r\ndirected: “As it is customary to make a bequest to relatives even if\r\nthey are in no wise related,” that his French pianoforte be given to\r\nhis brother. “As regards Steiner, let him be content with the assurance\r\nthat he shall be paid in full by the end of September--for if anything\r\ncomes of the Mayence business it will not be before then and the first\r\n600 florins must go to two of the noblest of mankind who, when I was\r\nalmost helpless, most kindly and disinterestedly came to my assistance\r\nwith this sum.” No doubt the Brentanos were meant; Steiner had\r\nevidently been dunning him for the old debt.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of November, Beethoven returned again to Vienna,\r\nwhere he took up a new residence--probably at No. 969 Johannesgasse, a\r\nhouse owned by a family named Kletschka. He did not remain there long,\r\nhowever, as the other tenants complained of his pianoforte playing\r\nand the disturbance caused by his quarrels with his nephew and the\r\nhousekeeper. He received notice to quit and removed, presumably, to\r\napartments in the second storey of a house in the Krügerstrasse, now\r\nknown as No. 13.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AN ENGLISH VISIT AGAIN CONTEMPLATED]\r\n\r\nThoughts of a visit to England had been revived early in the year by\r\na letter from Neate and, while the plans of the concert were making,\r\nit had been determined, so far as it was possible to do so, that\r\nthe visit should be undertaken in the fall and that Schindler should\r\naccompany him. This is the key to Schindler’s forceful observation\r\nafter the financial fiasco of the concert. A second letter bearing on\r\nthe subject was written by Neate on December 20. Consideration of it\r\nbelongs in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[116] Beethoven’s letters to Bernard were published by Alexander\r\nHajdecki in the February number, 1909, of “Nord und Süd”; Hajdecki\r\nfound the letters in the hands of a niece of one of Bernard’s daughters\r\nto whom he had bequeathed them. They are not included in the Kalischer\r\nor Prelinger collections.\r\n\r\n[117] Frimmel, however, placing faith in a tradition to that effect,\r\nsays that the Decker drawing was made in the fall of 1825 in the\r\nSchwarzspanier House. The print issued by the “Allgemeine Musikalische\r\nZeitung” could not be found by Dr. Deiters; but Thayer, (who spells\r\nthe name of the artist “Daker,”) saw one in the hands of Prof.\r\nSpatzenegger, a son-in-law of the artist, in Salzburg.\r\n\r\n[118] This could only have been the Quartet in E-flat, which, however,\r\nwas far from finished.\r\n\r\n[119] Only the Bagatelles, Op. 119, had been published when this was\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\n[120] Stumpff’s manuscript, which also covered the principal incidents\r\nof a trip through Germany, after his death came into the possession of\r\nhis surviving partner, T. Martin, who permitted Thayer to transcribe\r\nall of it relating to Beethoven. Many of his observations parallel\r\nthose made by Reichardt, Rochlitz, Schultz and other visitors, and\r\ntheir repetition here would add nothing to the story of Beethoven’s\r\nlife and manners; besides, the account is too long to be inserted in\r\nfull. The reader who wishes to read all of it is referred to the German\r\nedition of Thayer’s biography. Vol. V, page 122 _et seq._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\n\r\n    The Year 1825--The London Philharmonic Society again--Karl\r\n    Holz--The Early Biographies--Visits of Rellstab, Kuhlau, Smart and\r\n    Others--Stephan von Breuning--The A Minor Quartet, Op. 132.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter from Neate referred to at the conclusion of the last\r\nchapter brought with it an invitation from the Philharmonic Society of\r\nLondon which kept the thought of an English visit alive in Beethoven’s\r\nirresolute mind for a considerable space longer. Neate wrote in an\r\nextremely cordial vein. He had long wished to see Beethoven in England,\r\nhe said, where he believed that his genius was appreciated more than\r\nin any other country; and now he had received the pleasant charge from\r\nthe Philharmonic Society to invite him to come. He made no doubt but\r\nthat in a short time he would earn enough money richly to compensate\r\nhim for all the inconveniences of the journey. The Philharmonic Society\r\nwas disposed to give him 300 guineas for conducting at least one of\r\nhis works at each of the Society’s concerts in the coming season, and\r\ncomposing a new symphony which was to be produced during his visit\r\nbut to remain the composer’s property. As an additional pecuniary\r\ninducement he held out that Beethoven could give a concert of his own\r\nat which he would make at least £500, besides which there were many\r\nother avenues of profit open to him. If he were to bring along the\r\nquartets of which he had written, they would yield him £100 more, and\r\nhe might therefore be sure of carrying back a large sum of money,\r\nenough, indeed, to make all the remainder of his life much pleasanter\r\nthan the past had been. He told Beethoven that the new Symphony had\r\narrived and the first rehearsal of it set for January 17. He hoped that\r\nBeethoven would be on hand to direct it at the first concert of the\r\nSociety and trusted that a report that a copy of it was in Paris was\r\nnot true.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLANS FOR THE TRIP TO LONDON]\r\n\r\nBeethoven replied: He was delighted with the terms which the Society\r\noffered, but would like to have 100 guineas more to pay for the\r\nexpenses of the trip, it being necessary that he buy a carriage for\r\nthe journey, and take a companion with him. He would bring a new\r\nquartet. The rumor that there was a copy of the Symphony was not true;\r\nit would, indeed, be published in Germany, but not before the year\r\nwas past during which it was to remain the society’s property.[121]\r\nHe urged that separate string rehearsals be held and the choruses be\r\nthoroughly studied above all, and directions for the _reprise_ in the\r\nsecond movement, the marks for which had been forgotten in the copy.\r\nAn early reply was asked, as he had been requested to write a large\r\nwork upon which he did not wish to begin before receiving an answer,\r\nfor while he did not write in the hope of gaining a fortune it was\r\nnecessary that he have assurance that he would earn a living. To this\r\nletter Neate replied on February 1. He had conveyed the contents of\r\nBeethoven’s letter to the directors of the Philharmonic Society and had\r\nnow regretfully to report that they had declined to make any change\r\nin their offer. He was personally willing to give the advance asked,\r\nbut the individual directors were not masters of their conduct in all\r\nthings; they had to abide by the laws of the Society. He hoped that\r\nunder the circumstances Beethoven would come; he was sure the trip\r\nwould pay him, and the directors would impatiently await his presence\r\nat the second concert, it being already too late for the first. There\r\nwas to be another rehearsal of the Symphony that evening.\r\n\r\nAgain Beethoven had to struggle with the question as to whether or\r\nnot he should make the journey to London. He was strongly urged to go\r\nby his desire to earn a large sum of money. His friends pressed him\r\nwith arguments in favor of the trip. Karl admonished him to make up\r\nhis mind without giving heed to his insatiably sordid brother, but\r\nreminded him that Neate had assured him he would make enough money to\r\nbe free of care for the rest of his life. Johann did not talk of the\r\nfinancial advantage alone but said that he would benefit physically,\r\ntravel being good for the health. Apparently answering an objection of\r\nBeethoven’s on the score of his age, Karl reminded him that Haydn also\r\nwent to London when he was fifty years old and he was “not so famous.”\r\nSchuppanzigh bursts out with his brusque third person singular: “I wish\r\nhe would pluck up enough courage to make the trip; he would not regret\r\nit.” Who should accompany him? Schindler had been recommended by Neate,\r\nbut his name does not occur in these conversations; instead, there\r\nis talk of Schuppanzigh and young Streicher. But as it turned out, no\r\none was to accompany him, nobody alight with him either at the house\r\nof Stumpff or the Hotel de la Sablonière in Leicester Square which\r\nNeate had recommended as a French house much visited by foreigners. His\r\ndoubts, suspicions, fears for his health, anxiety about his nephew,\r\nhis fatal indecision, prevailed;--he would make the visit some other\r\ntime--perhaps in the fall, as he wrote to Neate. Meanwhile would Neate\r\naid him in the matter of the quartets? He had finished one and was\r\nat work on a second, which would be completed soon. Then he wrote\r\nagain--on May 25; he was satisfied with the offer of £100 for the three\r\nquartets, was Neate agreed to his plan of sending them to a banker\r\nto be delivered on payment of the fee? If so he would send the first\r\nquartet at once and the fee might be paid after he had given notice of\r\nthe completion of the other two.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE NINTH SYMPHONY AT AIX-LA-CHAPELLE]\r\n\r\nThe absence of Ries’s name in these negotiations is explained by the\r\nfact that he was no longer in London. He had purchased an estate in\r\nGodesberg, near Bonn, and removed thither in 1824. He had invited\r\nBeethoven to be his guest there and it would seem that he was advised\r\nabout the English situation. At least in a letter, presumably written\r\nearly in 1825, Beethoven deems it incumbent to inform Ries that the\r\npresent efforts to dispose of the Ninth Symphony were tentative and\r\nthat the period during which the Philharmonic Society was to hold the\r\nwork would be scrupulously respected. It had never been sent to Bremen\r\nor to Paris as had been reported. The occasion for this letter was one\r\nfrom Ries requesting metronome marks for “Christus am Ölberg,” and for\r\nthe score of the Ninth Symphony for the approaching Lower Rhenish Music\r\nFestival, which he had been engaged to conduct. These _Niederrheinische\r\nMusikfeste_ had come into existence in 1817. The seventh meeting was\r\nto be held at Aix-la-Chapelle. Reports of the Vienna performance had\r\nbeen spread and it was desired to make the Symphony a feature of\r\nthe festival scheme. In January, Schott and Sons were asked if the\r\nscore would be in print by May and replied in the negative. Thereupon\r\nRies was asked to write to Beethoven for a manuscript copy. Ries\r\ndid not favor the production of the Symphony[122] but wrote for the\r\nmusic nevertheless, and Beethoven sent him the score of the purely\r\ninstrumental movements and the parts of the finale. This was about\r\nMarch 12; a week later, on March 19 (two days, by the way, before the\r\nfirst performance in London), he sent the chorusmaster’s score of the\r\nfinale and suggested that the instrumental score might be written out\r\nand appended. In the earlier letter in which Beethoven had promised\r\nto send the Symphony and in which he enclosed the metronome marks for\r\nthe “Christus am Ölberg,” Beethoven offered to send also the Mass in\r\nD, an overture which he had written “for the Philharmonic Society,”\r\nand some smaller things for orchestra and chorus, which would enable\r\nthe festival managers to give two or three concerts instead of one. He\r\nsuggested that 40 Carolines would, perhaps, not be too much as a fee.\r\nBeethoven explained to Ries that he had only one copy of the score of\r\nthe Ninth Symphony, and as there was a concert in prospect he could\r\nnot send it; so Ries had a score made of the finale for the festival\r\nperformance. Beethoven had also sent the “Opferlied,” the Overture in\r\nC (Op. 115, of course), the _Kyrie_ and _Gloria_ of the Mass and an\r\nItalian duet. He was still to send a grand march and chorus (from “The\r\nRuins of Athens”), and might add an overture which was as yet unknown\r\noutside of Vienna, but thought he had sent enough. The Symphony and\r\n“Christus am Ölberg” were performed on the second day of the festival.\r\nThe time was too short for the difficult music thoroughly to be learned\r\nand at the performance portions of the slow movement and Scherzo of\r\nthe Symphony were “regretfully” omitted. There were 422 performers\r\nin chorus and orchestra, and the popular reception of the music was\r\nenthusiastic enough to enable Ries to report to Beethoven that the\r\nperformance had been a success; and he sent him 40 Louis d’ors as a\r\nfee. Ries recognized the symphony as a work without a fellow and told\r\nBeethoven that had he written nothing else it would have made him\r\nimmortal. “Whither will you yet lead us?” he asked. Very naturally,\r\nBeethoven had reported the negotiations touching a visit to England\r\nto Ries, who expressed his satisfaction that he had not accepted the\r\nengagement and added: “If you want to go there you must make thorough\r\npreparations. Rossini got £2500 from the Opera alone. If Englishmen\r\nwant to do an extraordinary thing, they must all get together so as to\r\nmake it worth while. There will be no lack of applause and marks of\r\nhonor, but you have probably had enough of these all your life.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A JOKE ON HASLINGER MISCARRIES]\r\n\r\nMass and symphony had been delivered to Fries, the banker, on January\r\n16, to be forwarded to Schott and Sons. Beethoven informed the firm by\r\nletter and took occasion to deny the report that it had been printed\r\nelsewhere. However, he does not seem to be entirely at ease in the\r\nmatter. “Schlesinger is not to be trusted, for he takes where he can;\r\nboth _Père et fils_ bombarded me for the Mass, etc., but I did not\r\ndeign to answer either of them, since after thinking them over I had\r\ncast them out long before.”[123] He asks their attention to his plan\r\nfor a complete edition of his works, which he would like to prepare and\r\ntake a lump sum as an honorarium. He sends two canons for publication\r\nin the journal “Cäcilia,” and attempted a joke on his friend Haslinger\r\nwhich exercised his mind not a little during the next month or two.\r\nThis was a skit purporting to be an outline or draft for an article\r\non Haslinger’s career. The Schotts, either not understanding the\r\njoke or desiring to injure a rival who had spoken ill of them to\r\nBeethoven, printed the communication together with the two canons as\r\nif they belonged together. Beethoven either felt or affected to feel\r\ngreat anger at the proceeding; he sent a letter to the publishers and\r\ndemanded its publication without change or curtailment. In this he\r\nrebuked them for printing what was intended as a pleasantry but might\r\neasily be construed as an intentional insult. He had not destined it\r\nfor publication, and it was contrary to his nature intentionally to\r\ngive offence to anybody. He had never resented anything that had been\r\nsaid about him as an artist, but he felt differently about things\r\nwhich affected him as a man. Haslinger was a respected old friend and\r\nhe had thought to heighten the effect of the joke by suggesting that\r\nhis consent to the publication be obtained. The printing was an abuse\r\nof the privileges of private correspondence, especially as the canons\r\nprinted,[124] being set forth as a supplement to the skit, thereby\r\nbecame inexplicably incongruous. He would have a care that such a thing\r\nshould not occur again. Whether or not the communication was ever\r\nprinted does not appear; neither does it appear that Beethoven took\r\nthe matter so greatly to heart as his letter was calculated to make\r\nthe public believe, had it been printed. In August he wrote to his new\r\nfriend Karl Holz: “I hear with amazement that the Mayence street-boys\r\nreally abused a joke! It is contemptible; I assure you it was not\r\nat all my intention. What I meant was to have Castelli write a poem\r\non these lines under the name of the musical Tobias, which I would\r\nset to music. But since it has so happened, it must be accepted as a\r\ndispensation from heaven. It will form a companion-piece to Goethe’s\r\nBardt _sans comparaison_ with all other authors. But I believe Tobias\r\nhas wronged you a little, etc.,--_Voila_ it is better to be revenged\r\nthan to fall into the maw of a monster.[125] I can’t shed tears over it\r\nbut must laugh like--.” To his nephew he wrote: “It was not right for\r\nMayence to do a thing like that, but as it is done it will do no harm.\r\nThe times demand strong men to castigate these petty, tricky, miserable\r\nlittle fellows”; and then, as if repenting him of the sounding phrase,\r\nhe wrote in the margin: “much as my heart rebels against doing a man\r\nharm; besides it was only a joke and I never thought of having it\r\nprinted.” It would seem that Haslinger must have known of the skit\r\nbefore it was sent to Schott, for in a letter of February 5, Beethoven\r\nsuggested to the firm, as a joke, to ask Haslinger for the “romantic\r\nbiography” which Beethoven had written of him, and added: “That is the\r\nway to handle this fellow, a heartless Viennese, who is the one who\r\nadvised me not to deal with you. _Silentium!_” And he describes Steiner\r\nas a “rascally fellow and skinflint,” and Haslinger as a “weakling”\r\nwhom he made useful to himself in some things. Haslinger may have\r\nfelt incensed at the publication, but he eventually accepted it in an\r\namiable spirit and it did not lead to any rupture of friendship between\r\nthe men.\r\n\r\nAn amusing illustration of how Beethoven could work himself into a rage\r\neven when alone is preserved at the Beethoven Museum in Bonn, in the\r\nshape of some extraordinary glosses on a letter from a copyist named\r\nWolanek, who was in his employ in the spring of the year. Wolanek was a\r\nBohemian. Beethoven had railed against him whenever sending corrections\r\nto a publisher or apologizing for delays, and it is not difficult to\r\nimagine what the poor fellow had to endure from the composer’s voluble\r\ntongue and fecund imagination in the invention and application of\r\nepithets. In delivering some manuscripts by messenger some time before\r\nEaster, Wolanek ventured a defense of his dignity in a letter which,\r\nthough couched in polite phrase, was nevertheless decidedly ironical\r\nand cutting. He said that he was inclined to overlook Beethoven’s\r\nconduct towards him with a smile; since there were so many dissonances\r\nin the ideal world of tones, why not also in the world of reality?\r\nFor him there was comfort in the reflection that if Beethoven had\r\nbeen copyist to “those celebrated artists, Mozart and Haydn,” he\r\nwould have received similar treatment. He requested that he be not\r\nassociated with those wretches of copyists who were willing to be\r\ntreated as slaves simply for the sake of a livelihood, and concluded\r\nby saying that nothing that he had done would cause him to blush in\r\nthe slightest degree in the presence of Beethoven. It did not suffice\r\nBeethoven to dismiss the man from his employ; such an outcome seemed\r\nanticipated in the letter. He must make him feel that his incompetency\r\nwas wholly to blame and realize how contemptible he looked in the eyes\r\nof the composer. The reference to Mozart and Haydn was particularly\r\ngalling. Beethoven read the letter and drew lines across its face from\r\ncorner to corner. Then in letters two inches long he scrawled over\r\nthe writing the words: “_Dummer, Eingebildeter, Eselhafter Kerl_”\r\n(“Stupid, Conceited, Asinine Fellow”). That was not enough. There was\r\na wide margin at the bottom of the sheet, just large enough to hold\r\nBeethoven’s next ebullition: “Compliments for such a good-for-nothing,\r\nwho pilfers one’s money?--better to pull his asinine ears!” Then\r\nhe turned the sheet over. A whole page invited him--and he filled\r\nit, margins and all. “Dirty Scribbler! Stupid Fellow! Correct the\r\nblunders which you have made in your ignorance, insolence, conceit and\r\nstupidity--this would be more to the purpose than to try to teach me,\r\nwhich is as if a _Sow_ were to try to give lessons to Minerva!” “Do YOU\r\ndo honor to Mozart and Haidn by never mentioning their names.” “It was\r\ndecided yesterday and even before then _not to have you write any more_\r\nfor me.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FIRST PERFORMANCES OF THE E-FLAT QUARTET]\r\n\r\nThe E-flat Quartet was now finished and about to be performed by\r\nSchuppanzigh and his companions. Beethoven was greatly concerned about\r\nthe outcome and, as if at once to encourage and admonish them, he\r\ndrafted a document in which all pledged themselves to do their best\r\nand sent it to them for signature. They obeyed, Linke adding to his\r\nname the words: “The Grand Master’s accursed violoncello.” and Holz:\r\n“The last--but only in signing.” The performance took place on March\r\n6, and the result was disappointing. The music was not understood\r\neither by the players or the public and was all but ineffective.\r\nSchuppanzigh was held responsible and his patience must have been\r\nseverely taxed by Beethoven’s upbraidings and his determination to\r\nhave an immediate repetition by other players. Schuppanzigh defended\r\nhimself as vigorously as possible and was particularly vexed because\r\nBeethoven cited his brother’s opinion of the performance--that of a\r\nmusical ignoramus. He wanted to play the Quartet a second time, but\r\ntold Beethoven that he had no objections to the work being handed over\r\nto Böhm; yet he protested with no little energy, that the fault of the\r\nfiasco was not his individually, as Beethoven had been told. He could\r\neasily master the technical difficulties, but it was hard to arrive at\r\nthe spirit of the work: the _ensemble_ was faulty, because of this fact\r\nand too few rehearsals. Beethoven decided that the next hearing should\r\nbe had from Böhm, and though Schuppanzigh had acquiesced, he harbored\r\na grievance against the composer for some time. Böhm had been leader\r\nof the quartet concerts in Vienna during Schuppanzigh’s long absence.\r\nHe has left an account of the incident, in which he plainly says that\r\nSchuppanzigh’s attitude toward the work was not sympathetic and that\r\nhe had wearied of the rehearsals, wherefore at the performance it made\r\nbut a _succès d’estime_. Beethoven sent for him (Böhm) and curtly said:\r\n“You must play my Quartet”--and the business was settled; objections,\r\nquestionings, doubts were of no avail against Beethoven’s will. The\r\nQuartet was newly studied under Beethoven’s own eyes, a circumstance\r\nwhich added to the severity of the rehearsals, for, though he could not\r\nhear a tone, Beethoven watched the players keenly and detected even the\r\nslightest variation in tempo or rhythm from the movement of the bows.\r\nBöhm tells a story in illustration of this:\r\n\r\n    At the close of the last movement of the quartet there occurred\r\n    a _meno vivace_,[126] which seemed to me to weaken the general\r\n    effect. At the rehearsal, therefore, I advised that the original\r\n    tempo be maintained, which was done, to the betterment of the\r\n    effect. Beethoven, crouched in a corner, heard nothing, but watched\r\n    with strained attention. After the last stroke of the bows he said,\r\n    laconically “Let it remain so,” went to the desks and crossed out\r\n    the _meno vivace_ in the four parts.\r\n\r\nThe Quartet was played twice by Böhm and his fellows at a morning\r\nconcert in a coffee-house in the Prater, late in March or early in\r\nApril, and was enthusiastically received. Steiner, who had attended\r\none or more of the rehearsals, was particularly enraptured by it and\r\nat once offered to buy it for publication for 60 ducats--a fact which\r\nBeethoven did not fail to report to Schott and Sons when he sent the\r\nmanuscript to them. Subsequently Mayseder also played it at a private\r\nconcert in the house of Dembscher, an official or agent of the war\r\ndepartment of the Austrian Government, and this performance Holz\r\ndescribed as a _réparation d’honneur_. Beethoven was now completely\r\nsatisfied and, no doubt, went to work on its successor with a contented\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: KARL HOLZ SUPPLANTS SCHINDLER]\r\n\r\nIt is now become necessary to pay attention to the new friend of\r\nBeethoven whose name has been mentioned--the successor of Schindler,\r\nas he had been of Oliva, in the office of factotum in ordinary. This\r\nwas Karl Holz, a young man (he was born in 1798) who occupied a post\r\nin the States’ Chancellary of Lower Austria. He had studied music with\r\nGlöggl in Linz and was so capable a violinist that, on Schuppanzigh’s\r\nreturn from Russia in 1823, he became second in the latter’s quartet.\r\nHe seems to have come into closer contact with Beethoven early in the\r\nspring of 1825, probably when, having to conduct a performance of the\r\nB-flat Symphony at a concert in the Ridotto Room, he asked an audience\r\nof the composer in order that he might get the _tempi_ for that work.\r\nThough not a professional musician, he gave music lessons, later\r\noccasionally conducted the _Concerts spirituels_ and eventually became\r\nthe regular director of these affairs. Emboldened by the kindness\r\nwith which he was first received he gradually drew nearer to the\r\ncomposer and in August, 1825, an intimate friendship seems imminent,\r\nas is indicated by Beethoven’s remark in a letter to his nephew: “It\r\nseems as if Holz might become a friend.” He was good at figures, a\r\nquality which made him particularly serviceable to Beethoven (who was\r\nwoefully deficient in arithmetic)[127] at a time when he was dealing\r\nwith foreign publishers and there was great confusion in money values\r\nand rates of exchange. He was also a well-read man, a clever talker,\r\nmusically cultured, a cheery companion, and altogether an engaging\r\nperson. All these qualities, no less than the fact that he was strong\r\nand independent in his convictions and fearless in his proclamation\r\nof them, recommended him to Beethoven, and he does not seem to have\r\nhesitated to take advantage of the fact that he entered the inner\r\ncircle of Beethoven’s companions at a time when the composer had begun\r\nto feel a growing antipathy to Schindler. He promptly embraced the\r\nopportunity which his willing usefulness brought him, to draw close to\r\nthe great man, to learn of him and also to exhibit himself to the world\r\nas his confidential friend. He was not obsequious, and this pleased\r\nBeethoven despite the fact that he himself was not indisposed to play\r\nupon his friends for his own purposes “like instruments,” as he himself\r\nonce confessed. In a short time Holz made himself indispensable and\r\nacquired great influence over the composer. He aided him in the copying\r\nof his works, looked into the affairs of Nephew Karl and reported upon\r\nthem, advised him in his correspondence, and directed his finances at\r\na time when he was more than ordinarily desirous to acquire money so\r\nthat he might leave a competency on his death to his foster-son. In\r\ntime Beethoven came to entrust weighty matters to his decision, even\r\nthe choice of publishers and his dealings with them. His prepossessing\r\naddress, heightened by his independence of speech, made it less easy\r\nto contradict him than Schindler. Moreover, the recorded conversations\r\nshow that he was witty, that he had a wider outlook on affairs than\r\nBeethoven’s other musical advisers, that his judgments were quickly\r\nreached and unhesitatingly pronounced. His speeches are not free from\r\nfrivolity nor always from flattery, but he lived at a time and among\r\na people accustomed to extravagant compliments and there can be no\r\ndoubt of his reverence for Beethoven’s genius. Beethoven could endure\r\na monstrous deal of lip-service, as all his friends knew, and surely\r\ntook no offence when Holz said to him: “I am no flatterer, but I assure\r\nyou that the mere thought of Beethovenian music makes me glad, first of\r\nall, that I am alive!”\r\n\r\nWe owe much of our knowledge of the relations between Beethoven and\r\nHolz to Schindler’s statements as they appear in his biography,[128]\r\ntwo articles which appeared in the “Kölnische Zeitung” in 1845, and\r\namong the glosses on the Conversation Book. But many of his utterances\r\nshow ill-feeling, which it is not unfair to trace to a jealousy dating\r\nback to the time when Holz crowded Beethoven’s “Secretary _sans_\r\nsalary” out of Beethoven’s service and good graces. There was no open\r\nrupture between Beethoven and Schindler, but a feeling of coolness and\r\nindifference which grew with the advancement of the younger man in the\r\nfavor of the composer. There is considerably more to be read between\r\nSchindler’s lines than on their surface, and because of their personal\r\nequation they ought to be received with caution. True, he does not deny\r\nthat Holz was possessed of excellent artistic capacities, that he was\r\nwell educated and entirely respectable as a man. He describes him as a\r\nprime specimen of the Viennese “Phæacians” of whom Beethoven was wont\r\nto speak with supreme contempt; and there is ample evidence that Holz\r\nwas indeed given to the pleasures which Beethoven attributed to the\r\ndenizens of Scheria. But the results of Beethoven’s fellowship with a\r\ncheery companion were certainly not so great as Schindler says, nor so\r\nevil and grievous as he intimates. His earlier insinuation, that in\r\norder to exhibit his influence to the public Holz led Beethoven into\r\ncompany and practices which he would otherwise have avoided, among\r\nthem to the frequenting of taverns and to excessive wine-bibbing, were\r\nsubsequently developed into an accusation that Holz had spread a\r\nreport that the composer had contracted dropsy from vinous indulgence.\r\nBeethoven was accustomed to drink wine from youth up, and also to\r\nthe companionship which he found in the inns and coffee houses of\r\nVienna, which are not to be confounded with the groggeries with which\r\nstraitlaced Americans and Englishmen are prone to associate the words.\r\nIt was, moreover, undoubtedly a charitable act to drag him out of his\r\nisolation into cheerful company. We know that he was so accustomed to\r\ntake wine at his meals that his physicians found it difficult to make\r\nhim obey their prohibition of wine and heating spices when he was ill;\r\nbut that he was more given to wine-drinking in 1825 and 1826 than at\r\nany other period, we learn only from Schindler, whose credibility as\r\na witness on this point is impeached by the fact that, as he himself\r\nconfesses, he seldom saw Beethoven between March 1825 and August 1826.\r\nNor is it true, as Schindler asserts, that Beethoven’s habits now\r\ncost him the loss of old friendships. On the contrary, it was in this\r\nperiod that the cordial relations between him and Stephan von Breuning,\r\nwhich had been interrupted many years before, were restored and became\r\npeculiarly warm. Czerny told Jahn that Beethoven’s hypochondria led to\r\nmany estrangements; but when he was ill, Count Lichnowsky, Haslinger\r\nand Piringer were visitors at his bedside, and not even Schindler\r\nseems to have been able to name a man whose sympathy the composer had\r\nsacrificed. His life was solitary; but not more than it had been for\r\nyears.[129] In Gerhard von Breuning’s recollections, as recorded in\r\n“Aus dem Schwarzspanierhause,” there is scarcely a mention of Holz and\r\nnone at all of the dangers into which Beethoven is alleged to have been\r\nled by him.\r\n\r\nBeethoven’s letters bear witness to the fond regard in which he held\r\nhim. His name, which in German signifies wood and in the literature\r\nof the church also cross, provided Beethoven with a welcome chance to\r\nindulge his extravagant fondness for punning. Thus in the composer’s\r\njovial address-book, not distinguished by reverence for anything sacred\r\nor profane, Holz becomes “Best Mahoghany,” “Best Splinter from the\r\nCross of Christ,” “Best _lignum crucis_.” The tone of the letters is\r\nalways respectful, and once he begs his friend to forget an undescribed\r\nhappening. Holz had his entire confidence, and when the great\r\ncatastrophe of 1826 came, Holz was the strongest prop upon which he\r\nleaned. Schindler says that Beethoven was godfather to Holz’s child,\r\nbut that is plainly an error; Holz was married in the early winter of\r\n1826, only three or four months before Beethoven’s death. The extent to\r\nwhich he had won Beethoven’s confidence and Beethoven’s high opinion of\r\nhis character and ability are attested by the following document, which\r\nwas signed only a short time after the intimacy began:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: HOLZ AUTHORIZED TO WRITE A BIOGRAPHY]\r\n\r\n    With pleasure I give my friend, Karl Holz, the assurance which\r\n    has been asked of me, that I consider him competent to write my\r\n    eventual biography, assuming that such a thing should be desired,\r\n    and I repose in him the fullest confidence that he will give to the\r\n    world without distortion all that I have communicated to him for\r\n    this purpose.\r\n\r\n  Vienna, August 30, 1826.\r\n\r\n  Ludwig van Beethoven.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question as to the sincerity of the desire which finds\r\nutterance in this declaration. It was made in the midst of a period\r\nwhen Holz was of incalculable service to him, and he had every reason\r\nto believe that Holz had both the ability and the disposition to write\r\nthe truthful, unvarnished account of his life which he wanted the world\r\nto have. Schindler says that he subsequently changed his mind, said\r\nthat the document was the result of a surprise sprung upon him in the\r\nconfusion of occurrences, and asked von Breuning to request Holz to\r\nreturn it. Breuning declined to do so, says Schindler, and Beethoven,\r\nnot having courage himself to make the request, contented himself with\r\ndoubting the validity of a paper which was written only in pencil.\r\nOn his deathbed, Schindler continues,[130] Beethoven, in answer to a\r\nquestion directly put to him by Breuning, unhesitatingly declared that\r\nRochlitz was his choice as biographer; and at a later date, realizing\r\nthat death was approaching, he requested Breuning and Schindler to\r\ngather up his papers, make such use of them as could be done in strict\r\ntruth, and to write to Rochlitz. Two months after Beethoven had passed\r\naway Breuning followed him, and Schindler was left alone to fulfil the\r\ncomposer’s wish. He wrote to Rochlitz, who regretfully declined the\r\npious task on the ground that the state of his health did not permit\r\nhim to undertake so large a work. Thereupon Schindler let the matter\r\nrest, waiting for time and circumstances to determine the course which\r\nhe should follow.\r\n\r\nStephan von Breuning had informed his brother-in-law, Dr. Wegeler, of\r\nBeethoven’s charge with reference to the papers, and Wegeler had sent\r\nSchindler notes on Beethoven’s boyhood years and his life in Bonn.\r\nIn 1833 Schindler visited Wegeler in Coblenz and consulted with him\r\nabout the biography which, as Wegeler knew, Rochlitz had been asked,\r\nbut declined, to write. Wegeler thereupon suggested that Schindler,\r\nhe and Ferdinand Ries collaborate in the writing. Ries was consulted\r\nand agreed, but work had scarcely been begun before differences arose\r\nbetween Schindler and Ries as to the propriety of giving to the world\r\nmatters which Schindler (who insisted that Ries was paying a grudge\r\nwhich he owed his erstwhile teacher) thought of no interest or too\r\noffensive for publication. Ries contended that to tell the whole truth\r\nabout great men was right and could do them no injury. Schindler says\r\nhe then persuaded Wegeler to continue the collaboration without Ries,\r\nbut, delays resulting from correspondence with persons in Vienna,\r\nWegeler became impatient and in October, 1844,[131] announced that his\r\nnotes were about to be published. They did not appear, however, and\r\nSchindler tried again to work in company with Ries; but the latter\r\npersisted in his purpose, and the project fell through a second time.\r\nThis was in 1837, and the next year, shortly after Ries’s sudden\r\ndeath, appeared the “Biographische Notizen über Ludwig van Beethoven”\r\nby Wegeler and Ries. In the remarks with which the men prefaced their\r\nreminiscences there is no reference to the projected collaboration\r\ndescribed by Schindler, nor can it truthfully be said that anything in\r\nRies’s observations bears out Schindler’s charge that he felt a grudge\r\nagainst Beethoven and sought to feed it by telling unpleasant truths\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\nTo continue the story of these early biographies: Schindler now\r\nasked counsel of Dr. Bach, who advised him to betake himself to the\r\ntask of writing the life of Beethoven alone. He did so, and his book\r\nappeared in 1840. Holz never made use of the _imprimatur_ which he\r\nhad received from Beethoven, but in 1843 formally relinquished his\r\nauthorization to Dr. Gassner, of Carlsruhe, promising to deliver all\r\nthe material which he held into his hands and to use his influence in\r\nthe procurement of dates from authentic sources, “so that the errors\r\nin the faulty biographies which have appeared up to the present time\r\nmay be corrected.” That this was a fling at Schindler’s book is evident\r\nfrom a document[132] in which, on November 1, 1845, Holz, at that time\r\ndirector of the _Concerts spirituels_ in Vienna, declares that the\r\nforthcoming biography (by Gassner) would “not derive its dates from\r\n_fictitious_ or _stolen_ conversation books, and _unsophisticated_\r\nevidence will also give more intimate information about Mr.\r\nSchindler.” Twice did Schindler attack Holz in the “Kölnische Zeitung”\r\nin 1845 and once, it would appear, Holz answered him, but anonymously.\r\nThe subject need not be continued here, however; it has a bearing only\r\non the credibility of the two men in the discussion of each other.\r\nGassner’s biography never appeared.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was characteristic of Beethoven, and also of the friends who\r\ncame to his help in need, that though Schindler had been written down\r\nin his bad books before Holz established himself in his confidence,\r\nand though there was never a serious estrangement between Beethoven\r\nand Holz, it was Schindler upon whom Beethoven leaned most strongly\r\nfor help when the days of physical dissolution arrived--Schindler, not\r\nHolz. The latter’s devotion had either undergone a cooling process or\r\nbeen interfered with by his newly assumed domestic obligations. But\r\nSchindler’s statement that he was “dismissed” in December, 1826, is an\r\nexaggeration, to say the least; Beethoven wrote him a letter a month\r\nbefore he died, asking his help in collecting money from the Archduke.\r\nHolz died on November 9, 1858. He had been helpful to Otto Jahn when\r\nthe latter was gathering material for a life of Beethoven.[133]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STRICT PHYSICIANS AND AN UNRULY PATIENT]\r\n\r\nThe E-flat Quartet had been successfully brought forward, a pause had\r\nbeen reached in the correspondence with Schott and Sons and Neate, a\r\nsummer home for Beethoven was in prospect, and considerable progress\r\nhad been made in the draft for a new quartet designed for Prince\r\nGalitzin, when an illness befell Beethoven which kept him within\r\ndoors, and for a portion of the time in bed, from about the middle of\r\nApril to the beginning of May, 1825. Beethoven had been told by his\r\nphysician that he was in danger of an inflammation of the bowels, and\r\nas such Beethoven described his ailment in letters to his brother and\r\nto Schott and Sons. Dr. Staudenheimer had been in attendance on him\r\nbefore and had insisted upon strict obedience to his prescriptions.\r\nBeethoven now called in Dr. Braunhofer, who proved to be even less\r\nconsiderate of the patient’s wilfulness; he was so blunt and forceful\r\nin his demands for obedience that Beethoven was somewhat awed, and\r\nbeneficial results followed. Were it possible for the readers of these\r\npages who are curious on such subjects to consult the Conversation\r\nBooks of this period, they would there find interesting information as\r\nto diagnosis and treatment in the case of the distinguished patient.\r\nDr. Braunhofer did not want to “torment” Beethoven long with medicines,\r\nbut he gave orders for a strict diet. “No wine; no coffee; no spices of\r\nany kind. I’ll arrange matters with the cook.”--“Patience, a sickness\r\ndoes not disappear in a day.” “I shall not trouble you much longer\r\nwith medicine, but you must adhere to the diet; you’ll not starve on\r\nit.” “You must do some work in the daytime so that you can sleep at\r\nnight. If you want to get entirely well and live a long time, you must\r\nlive according to nature. You are very liable to inflammatory attacks\r\nand were close to a severe attack of inflammation of the bowels; the\r\npredisposition is still in your body. I’ll wager that if you take\r\na drink of spirits you’ll be lying weak and exhausted on your back\r\ninside of an hour.” The doctor inspired him with courage and hope, and\r\nadmonished him to keep quiet and be patient. In dry weather he was to\r\ntake walks, but even after going to Baden he must take no baths so long\r\nas the weather remained damp and symptoms of his illness remained.\r\n\r\nBeethoven went to Baden early in May and probably within a week of his\r\narrival he reported his condition to Dr. Braunhofer in a semi-humorous\r\nmanner by writing down a dialogue between doctor and patient in which\r\nthe latter suggests desired changes in his treatment. He asks for\r\nsomething strengthening to help him get to his desk, thinks that he\r\nmight be permitted to drink white wine and water, as the “mephitic\r\nbeer” revolts him; he is still very weak, expectorates blood freely\r\n“probably from the bronchial tubes,” etc. The physician had asked for\r\na few notes written by his own hand as a souvenir. Beethoven complies\r\nwith the request by sending him a canon written while taking a walk\r\non May 11. It looks like a sign of mingled apprehension and returning\r\nspirits:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Doktor sperrt das Thor dem Tod, Note hilft auch aus der Noth.\r\n  Close the door ’gainst Death, I plead, Doctor, notes will help in\r\n      need.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn May 17, he reports to his nephew that he is beginning to do\r\nconsiderable work.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: LUDWIG RELLSTAB VISITS BEETHOVEN]\r\n\r\nIt was while Beethoven was ill in Vienna that Ludwig Rellstab made\r\nseveral visits to him, of which he has left enthusiastic reports.[134]\r\nHe was 26 years old at the time and had made a mark as essayist and\r\npoet; the chief object of his journey to Vienna from Berlin, on\r\nwhich he set out on March 21, was to see the composer. He reached\r\nthe Austrian capital in the last days of March or the first days of\r\nApril. His account of the meeting is like many others except that\r\nit is written with literary elegance, albeit with that excessive\r\nfervor, that _Überschwänglichkeit_, which is characteristic of German\r\nhero-worshippers. Zelter had given him a letter of introduction and\r\nhad written that Rellstab wanted to write the libretto of an opera to\r\nbe set by the composer, and this was the first subject broached after\r\nBeethoven had warmly greeted his visitor and expressed delight with\r\nZelter’s letter. Beethoven is pleased at the prospect of getting an\r\nopera-book from Rellstab:\r\n\r\n    It is so difficult to get a good poem. Grillparzer promised me\r\n    one. He has already made one for me but we can not come to an\r\n    understanding with each other. I want one thing, he wants another.\r\n    You’ll have trouble with me!... I care little what genre the works\r\n    belong to, so the material be attractive to me. But it must be\r\n    something which I can take up with sincerity and love. I could not\r\n    compose operas like “Don Juan” and “Figaro.” They are repugnant to\r\n    me. I could not have chosen such subjects; they are too frivolous\r\n    for me!\r\n\r\nRellstab had had it in mind to write an opera-book for Weber and\r\nhad pondered over many subjects, and he now gave a list of these to\r\nBeethoven--“Attila,” “Antigone,” “Belisarius,” “Orestes” and others.\r\nBeethoven read the names thoughtfully and then apologized for the\r\ntrouble he was causing his visitor. Rellstab, seeing an expression\r\nof weariness in his face, took his departure, after saying that he\r\nwould send him a specimen of his handiwork. In a Conversation Book\r\nused in the middle of April there is further talk between Rellstab and\r\nBeethoven about opera, but the notes, which are fragmentary, give no\r\nindications of Beethoven’s views. The most interesting incident of the\r\nmeetings occurred at a subsequent visit. Rellstab had told that he had\r\nbeen deeply moved (he dared not express a more specific opinion on the\r\nsubject, being in doubt himself) by the Quartet in E-flat, which he had\r\nheard performed twice in succession.[135] He continues:\r\n\r\n    Beethoven read and remained silent; we looked at each other mutely,\r\n    but a world of emotions surged in my breast. Beethoven, too,\r\n    was unmistakably moved. He arose and went to the window, where\r\n    he remained standing beside the pianoforte. To see him so near\r\n    the instrument gave me an idea which I had never before dared to\r\n    harbor. If he--Oh! he needed only to turn half way around and he\r\n    would be facing the keyboard--if he would but sit down and give\r\n    expression to his feelings in tones! Filled with a timid, blissful\r\n    hope, I approached him and laid my hand upon the instrument. It\r\n    was an English pianoforte by Broadwood. I struck a chord lightly\r\n    with my right hand in order to induce Beethoven to turn around;\r\n    but he seemed not to have heard it. A few moments later, however,\r\n    he turned to me, and, seeing my eyes fixed upon the instrument he\r\n    said: “That is a beautiful pianoforte! I got it as a present from\r\n    London. Look at these names.” He pointed to the cross-beam over\r\n    the keyboard. There I saw several names which I had not before\r\n    noticed--Moscheles, Kalkbrenner, Cramer, Clementi, Broadwood\r\n    himself.... “That is a beautiful gift,” said Beethoven looking at\r\n    me, “and it has such a beautiful tone,” he continued and moved his\r\n    hands towards the keys without taking his eyes off me. He gently\r\n    struck a chord. Never again will one enter my soul so poignant,\r\n    so heartbreaking as that one was! He struck C major with the\r\n    right hand and B as a bass in the left, and continued his gaze\r\n    uninterruptedly on me, repeated the false chord several times in\r\n    order to let the sweet tone of the instrument reverberate; and the\r\n    greatest musician on earth did not hear the dissonance! Whether or\r\n    not Beethoven noticed his mistake I do not know; but when he turned\r\n    his head from me to the instrument he played a few chords correctly\r\n    and then stopped. That was all that I heard from him directly.\r\n\r\nRellstab had planned a short excursion to Hungary and then intended to\r\nleave Vienna for his home. Fearful that he might not see Beethoven on\r\nhis return to the city he went to him to say farewell:\r\n\r\n    Beethoven spoke very frankly and with feeling. I expressed\r\n    my regret that in all the time of my sojourn in Vienna I had\r\n    heard, except one of his symphonies and a quartet, not a single\r\n    composition of his in concert; why had “Fidelio” not been given?\r\n    This gave him an opportunity to express himself on the subject of\r\n    the taste of the Vienna people. “Since the Italians (Barbaja) have\r\n    gotten such a strong foothold here the best has been crowded out.\r\n    For the nobility, the chief thing at the theatre is the ballet.\r\n    Nothing can be said about their appreciation of art; they have\r\n    sense only for horses and dancers. We have always had this state\r\n    of things. But this gives me no concern; I want only to write that\r\n    which gives me joy. If I were well it would be all the same to me!”\r\n\r\nOn his departure Beethoven, who had been absent from his lodgings when\r\nRellstab called for his final leavetaking, sent him a letter to Steiner\r\nand Co., containing a canon on the words from Matthison’s “Opferlied”\r\nof which he had made use on at least one earlier occasion (“Das Schöne\r\nzu dem Guten”).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: AN UTTERANCE ON ECCLESIASTICAL MUSIC]\r\n\r\nKarl Gottfried Freudenberg, a young musician who afterwards became\r\nHead Organist at Breslau and wrote a book of reminiscences entitled\r\n“Erinnerungen eines alten Organisten,” visited Beethoven in July of the\r\nyear and has left a record which is none the less interesting because\r\nits lack of literary flourish is offset by succinct reports of the\r\ngreat composer’s estimate of some of his contemporaries, and his views\r\non ecclesiastical music. Beethoven, according to Freudenberg, described\r\nRossini as a “talented and a melodious composer; his music suits the\r\nfrivolous and sensuous spirit of the time, and his productivity is\r\nsuch that he needs only as many weeks as the Germans do years to\r\nwrite an opera.” He said of Spontini: “There is much good in him;\r\nhe understands theatrical effects and the musical noises of warfare\r\nthoroughly”; of Spohr: “He is too rich in dissonances, pleasure in his\r\nmusic is marred by his chromatic melody”; of Bach: “His name ought not\r\nto be Bach (brook) but Ocean, because of his infinite and inexhaustible\r\nwealth of combinations and harmonies. He was the ideal of an organist.”\r\nThis led Beethoven into the subject of music for the church. “I, too,\r\nplayed the organ a great deal in my youth,” he said, “but my nerves\r\ncould not stand the power of the gigantic instrument. I place an\r\norganist who is master of his instrument, first among virtuosi.” Pure\r\nchurch music, he remarked, ought to be performed only by voices, unless\r\nthe text be a _Gloria_ or something of the kind. For this reason he\r\npreferred Palestrina to all other composers of church music, but it\r\nwas folly to imitate him unless one had his genius and his religious\r\nbeliefs; moreover, it was practically impossible for singers to-day to\r\nsing the long-sustained notes of this music in a cantabile manner.\r\n\r\nKarl August Reichardt, afterwards Court Organist in Altenburg, S.\r\nM. de Boer, a member of the Academy of Fine Arts in Amsterdam, Carl\r\nCzerny, Friedrich Kuhlau, Sir George Smart and Moritz Schlesinger were\r\namong the visitors to Baden in the summer to whose meetings with the\r\ncomposer the Conversation Books bear always interesting and sometimes\r\ndiverting witness. Reichardt’s visit seems to have been brief, and it\r\nis safe to presume that the young man received scant encouragement to\r\nremain long, for his talk was chiefly about himself, his desire to get\r\nadvice as to a good teacher and to have Beethoven look at some of his\r\nmusic. The man from Holland, who probably had used his predicate as a\r\nmember of the Academy which had elected Beethoven an honorary member\r\nto gain an audience, must have diverted the composer with his broken\r\nGerman, which looks no more comical in the Conversation Book than it\r\nmust have sounded; but a canon without words which he carried away\r\nwith him may be said to bear witness to the fact that he made a good\r\nimpression on Beethoven, to whom he gave information concerning the\r\nstate of music in the Dutch country. Czerny, apparently, was urged\r\nby his erstwhile teacher to get an appointment and to compose in the\r\nlarger forms. Beethoven was curious to learn how much Czerny received\r\nfor his compositions and Czerny told him that he attached no importance\r\nto his pieces, because he scribbled them down so easily, and that he\r\ntook music from the publishers in exchange.\r\n\r\nThe visit of the Danish composer, flautist and director, Friedrich\r\nKuhlau, led to a right merry feast, for a description of which\r\nSeyfried found a place in the appendix of his “Studien.” That the\r\nboundaries of nice taste in conversation and story-telling may have\r\nbeen strained a bit is an inference from the fact that several pages\r\nof the Conversation Book containing the recorded relics of the affair\r\nare missing. After a promenade through the Helenenthal in which\r\nBeethoven amused himself by setting all manner of difficult tasks in\r\nhill-climbing, the party sat down to dinner at an inn. Champagne flowed\r\nfreely, and after the return to Beethoven’s lodgings red Vöslauer,\r\nbrought from his closet or cellar, did its share still further to\r\nelevate the spirits of the feasters. Beethoven seems to have held his\r\nown in the van of the revel. Kuhlau improvised a canon on B-a-c-h, to\r\nwhich Beethoven replied with the same notes as an opening motive and\r\nthe words “Kühl, nicht lau” (“Cool, not lukewarm”)--a feeble play on\r\nthe Danish musician’s name, but one which served to carry the music.\r\nBeethoven wrote his canon in the Conversation Book. The next day Kuhlau\r\nconfessed to Schlesinger that he did not know how he had gotten home\r\nand to bed: Beethoven’s post-festal reflections may be gathered from\r\nthe letter which accompanied a copy of the canon which he sent to\r\nKuhlau by the hands of Holz:\r\n\r\n  Baden, September 3, 1825.\r\n\r\n    I must admit that the champagne went too much to my head also,\r\n    yesterday, and that I was compelled again to make the experience\r\n    that such things retard rather than promote my capacities; for easy\r\n    as it generally is for me to meet a challenge on the instant, I do\r\n    not at all remember what I wrote yesterday.\r\n\r\nIn handing over letter and canon to Holz for delivery he wrote to him\r\nthat he had scarcely reached home before it occurred to him that he\r\nmight have made a dreadful mess of it on the day before.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A GARRULOUS PARISIAN PUBLISHER]\r\n\r\nSchlesinger, of Paris, son of the Berlin publisher, was a very\r\ninsistent as well as persistent courtier, with an auspicious eye to\r\nbusiness at all times. He wanted to purchase the two new quartets\r\nand did succeed in getting one of them, and he aroused Beethoven’s\r\nsuspicions by the pertinacity with which he pleaded for permission to\r\nattend a rehearsal of the second; the pride of the composer revolted,\r\nevidently, at the thought that a publisher should ask to hear a work of\r\nhis which he purposed buying. But Schlesinger, who had Nephew Karl as\r\nhis advocate at court in all things, made it appear that he was eager\r\nonly for the inestimable privilege of hearing the new works of the\r\nmaster, and put in a plea that he might also hear the Quartet which\r\nhad already been sold to Schott and Sons. Holz discloses a distrust\r\nof him very plainly and misses no occasion to warn Beethoven against\r\nentangling alliances with the Parisian publisher. Schlesinger wins his\r\nway to a very familiar footing with Beethoven, going so far once as\r\nto ask him if a report which he had heard that Beethoven had wanted\r\nto marry the pianist, Cibbini, was true.[136] The old page does not\r\ntell us what answer Beethoven gave, but Schlesinger, who had disclosed\r\nhis own heartwounds and railed against the fair sex because of his\r\nexperiences, tells the composer that he shall be the first to make the\r\nbride’s acquaintance should he ever get married. Schlesinger appears\r\ndesirous to become a sort of dealer _en gros_ in Beethoven’s products;\r\nhe would like the two new Quartets (in A minor and B-flat major); he\r\nwill publish a Complete Edition and begin with the chamber pieces, to\r\nwhich ends he wants still another quartet and three quintets; he seeks\r\nto awaken a literary ambition in the writer of notes--the journal\r\npublished by the Schlesingers in Berlin will be glad to republish\r\nwhatever Beethoven may write to the Mayence journal about the joke on\r\nHaslinger, and Beethoven ought really to write some essays--on what a\r\nsymphony and an overture ought to be and on the art of fugue, of which\r\nhe was now the sole repository. He knows how to approach genius on\r\nits most susceptible side. Beethoven must go to England, where he is\r\nso greatly admired; he reports that Cherubini had said to his pupils\r\nat the Conservatoire in Paris: “The greatest musical minds that ever\r\nlived or ever will live, are Beethoven and Mozart.” At dinner, at the\r\nsuggestion of the same garrulous talker, the company drink the healths\r\nof Goethe and Cherubini. Again Schlesinger urges Beethoven to go to\r\nLondon: “I repeat again that if you will go to England for three months\r\nI will engage that, deducting your travelling expenses, you will make\r\n1000 pounds, or 25,000 florins W. W. at least, if you give only two\r\nconcerts and produce some new music.... The Englishmen are proud enough\r\nto count themselves fortunate if Beethoven would only be satisfied\r\nwith them.” When the toast to Cherubini is drunk, Schlesinger takes\r\noccasion to satisfy the curiosity of Beethoven touching the status of\r\nthe composer whom he most admired among living men.\r\n\r\n    Cherubini has now received the title of Baron from the government\r\n    as well as the order of the Legion of Honor. It is a proof\r\n    of the recognition of his talent, for he did not seek it.\r\n    Napoleon, who appreciated him highly, once found fault with one\r\n    of his compositions and Cherubini retorted: “Your Majesty knows\r\n    no more about it than I about a battle.” Napoleon’s conduct\r\n    was contemptible. Because of the words that I have quoted he\r\n    took away all of Cherubini’s offices and he had nothing to\r\n    live on. Nevertheless, he did an infinite amount of good for\r\n    popular culture. If Napoleon, instead of becoming an insatiable\r\n    world-conqueror, had remained First Consul, he would have been one\r\n    of the greatest men that ever existed.\r\n\r\nSchlesinger had his way about hearing the new Quartet (in A minor, Op.\r\n132), for it was rehearsed at his rooms on Wednesday, September 7,\r\npreparatory to the performance, which was to take place at the tavern\r\n“Zum wilden Mann” at noon on September 9. Beethoven wanted the players\r\nto come to him at Baden for the final rehearsal, but that was found\r\nto be impracticable. On the day after the meeting at Schlesinger’s,\r\nhowever, Holz went out to Beethoven to tell him all about it. He\r\nreported that Wolfmayr “at the _Adagio_ wept like a child?” and that\r\n“Tobias scratched himself behind the ears when he heard the Quartet; he\r\ncertainly regrets that the Jew Steiner did not take it.”\r\n\r\nWe have an account of the performance at the “Wilden Mann” from\r\nthe English visitor whom Beethoven received at this time. This\r\nwas Sir George Smart, who, in the summer of 1825, made a tour of\r\nGermany in company with Charles Kemble. He was with Mr. Kemble when\r\nthat gentleman made the agreement with Weber for “Oberon,” but his\r\n“principal reason for the journey,” as he himself put it, “was to\r\nascertain from Beethoven himself the exact times of the movements of\r\nhis characteristic--and some of his other--Sinfonias.”[137] Sir George\r\nrecorded the incidents of his meetings with Beethoven in his journal,\r\nfrom which the following excerpts are taken:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SIR GEORGE SMART’S JOURNAL]\r\n\r\n    On the 7th of September, at nine in the morning, I called on\r\n    Mayseder, who received me most politely.... We conversed about\r\n    Beethoven’s Choral Symphony; our opinion agrees about it. When\r\n    it was performed here Umlauf conducted it and Kletrinsky and\r\n    Schuppanzigh were the leaders. All the basses played in the\r\n    recitative, but they had the story that it was written for\r\n    Dragonetti only.\r\n\r\n    Friday, September 9th.--We then went to Mecchetti’s music shop,\r\n    they, too, are publishers, and bought three pieces for Birchall....\r\n    Mr. Holz, an amateur in some public office and a good violin\r\n    player, came in and said Beethoven had come from Baden this morning\r\n    and would be at his nephew’s--Karl Beethoven, a young man aged\r\n    twenty--No. 72 Alleegasse.... At twelve I took Ries[138] to the\r\n    hotel Wildemann,[139] the lodgings of Mr. Schlesinger, the music\r\n    seller of Paris, as I understood from Mr. Holz that Beethoven\r\n    would be there, and there I found him. He received me in the most\r\n    flattering manner. There was a numerous assembly of professors\r\n    to hear Beethoven’s second[140] new manuscript quartette, bought\r\n    by Mr. Schlesinger. This quartette is three-quarters of an hour\r\n    long. They played it twice. The four performers were Schuppanzigh,\r\n    Holz, Weiss, and Lincke. It is most chromatic and there is a\r\n    slow movement entitled “Praise for the recovery of an invalid.”\r\n    Beethoven intended to allude to himself I suppose for he was very\r\n    ill during the early part of this year. He directed the performers,\r\n    and took off his coat, the room being warm and crowded. A staccato\r\n    passage not being expressed to the satisfaction of his eye, for\r\n    alas, he could not hear, he seized Holz’s violin and played the\r\n    passage a quarter of a tone too flat. I looked over the score\r\n    during the performance. All paid him the greatest attention.\r\n    About fourteen were present, those I knew were Boehm (violin),\r\n    Marx (’cello), Carl Czerny, also Beethoven’s nephew, who is like\r\n    Count St. Antonio, so is Boehm, the violin player. The partner of\r\n    Steiner, the music seller, was also there. I fixed to go to Baden\r\n    on Sunday and left at twenty-five minutes past two.\r\n\r\n    Saturday, September 10th. I called for the music at Artaria’s for\r\n    Birchall, for which I paid, and on our return found a visiting-card\r\n    from Earl Stanhope and also from Schlesinger of Paris with a\r\n    message that Beethoven would be at his hotel to-morrow at twelve,\r\n    therefore of course I gave up going to Baden to visit Beethoven,\r\n    which he had arranged for me to do.... In the morning Mr.\r\n    Kirchoffer called to say he should invite me to his house. It was\r\n    he who, through Ries, had the arrangement of procuring the Choral\r\n    Symphony for our Philharmonic Society.\r\n\r\n    Sunday, September 11th.... From hence I went alone to\r\n    Schlesinger’s, at the “Wildemann,” where was a larger party than\r\n    the previous one. Among them was L’Abbé Stadler, a fine old man\r\n    and a good composer of the old school, to whom I was introduced.\r\n    There was also present a pupil of Moscheles, a Mademoiselle Eskeles\r\n    and a Mademoiselle Cimia [Cibbini?], whom I understood to be a\r\n    professional player. When I entered Messrs. C. Czerny, Schuppanzigh\r\n    and Lincke had just begun the Trio, Op. 70, of Beethoven, after\r\n    which the same performers played Beethoven’s Trio, Op. 79--both\r\n    printed by Steiner. Then followed Beethoven’s quartette, the same\r\n    that I had heard on September the 9th and it was played by the\r\n    same performers. Beethoven was seated near the pianoforte beating\r\n    time during the performance of these pieces. This ended, most of\r\n    the company departed, but Schlesinger invited me to stop and dine\r\n    with the following company of ten: Beethoven, his nephew, Holz,\r\n    Weiss, C. Czerny, who sat at the bottom of the table, Lincke, Jean\r\n    Sedlatzek--a flute player who is coming to England next year, and\r\n    has letters to the Duke of Devonshire, Count St. Antonio, etc.--he\r\n    has been to Italy--Schlesinger, Schuppanzigh, who sat at the top,\r\n    and myself. Beethoven calls Schuppanzigh Sir John Falstaff, not a\r\n    bad name considering the figure of this excellent violin player.\r\n\r\n    We had a most pleasant dinner, healths were given in the English\r\n    style. Beethoven was delightfully gay but hurt that, in the letter\r\n    Moscheles gave me, his name should be mixed up with the other\r\n    professors. However he soon got over it. He was much pleased and\r\n    rather surprised at seeing in the oratorio bill I gave him that the\r\n    “Mount of Olives” and his “Battle Symphony” were both performed the\r\n    same evening. He believes--I do not--that the high notes Handel\r\n    wrote for trumpets were played formerly by one particular man. I\r\n    gave him the oratorio book and bill. He invited me by his nephew to\r\n    Baden next Friday. After dinner he was coaxed to play extempore,\r\n    observing in French to me, “Upon what subject shall I play?”\r\n    Meanwhile he was touching the instrument thus\r\n\r\n    [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    to which I answered, “Upon that.” On which theme he played for\r\n    about twenty minutes in a most extraordinary manner, sometimes\r\n    very fortissimo, but full of genius.[141] When he arose at the\r\n    conclusion of his playing he appeared greatly agitated. No one\r\n    could be more agreeable than he was--plenty of jokes. We all wrote\r\n    to him by turns, but he can hear a little if you halloo quite close\r\n    to his left ear. He was very severe in his observations about the\r\n    Prince Regent never having noticed his present of the score of\r\n    his “Battle Symphony.” His nephew regretted that his uncle had no\r\n    one to explain to him the profitable engagement offered by the\r\n    Philharmonic Society last year.\r\n\r\nSmart accepted Beethoven’s invitation to visit him at Baden on\r\nSeptember 16, and at this meeting accomplished the specific purpose\r\nof his visit to Vienna by getting Beethoven to give him the tempo of\r\nvarious movements from his symphonies, by playing portions of them on\r\nthe pianoforte.[142]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEETHOVEN’S INTEREST IN ENGLISH MATTERS]\r\n\r\nThough he had been warned not to write in Beethoven’s book, Sir\r\nGeorge did not, or was not always able to, obey the injunction. A\r\nconsiderable portion of the conversation at the meeting is preserved\r\nin a Conversation Book which covers three dates, September 16, 19, and\r\n24. From this book some excerpts are made here, since they bear on the\r\nsubject which filled so large a place in the plans of Beethoven for\r\nseveral years, and were in his mind up to the time of his death--the\r\nEnglish tour. Other matters bearing on points of history which have\r\nbeen or may be mentioned, are included. The nephew has translated for\r\nBeethoven the announcement of the Ninth Symphony as it appeared on\r\nthe programme of the Philharmonic’s concert of March 21, viz.: “New\r\nGrand Characteristic Sinfonia, MS. with vocal finale, the principal\r\nparts to be sung by Madame Caradori, Miss Goodall, Mr. Vaughn and Mr.\r\nPhillips; composed expressly for this Society.” No doubt Beethoven\r\ngave expression, as he frequently had done, to his admiration for the\r\nEnglish people and possibly also for their national hymn, for Karl\r\ntranslates the stanza:\r\n\r\n      Long may he reign!\r\n    May he defend our laws,\r\n    And ever give us cause\r\n    To sing with heart and voice:\r\n      God save the king!\r\n\r\nThe one-sided conversation proceeds:\r\n\r\n    _Smart._--You understand English writing?--_Extremement\r\n    bien._----Winter _me dit que on l’intention de donner Fidelio a\r\n    music_.\r\n\r\n    _Karl._--He would like to know the tempi of the finale of the last\r\n    symphony. Haven’t you it here?--\r\n\r\n    How long you worked on the symphony?--How long does it last?--1\r\n    hour and 3 minutes--3/4 hour--We are now going to take a walk.\r\n\r\nAccording to Smart’s journal, Beethoven now ordered dinner “with his\r\nfunny old cook,” told his nephew to look after the wine, and the party\r\nof five took a walk in the course of which Schuppanzigh told Smart\r\nthat it was while sketching in the open air that Beethoven caught his\r\ndeafness. “He was writing in a garden and was so absorbed that he\r\nwas not sensible of a pouring rain, till his music paper was so wet\r\nthat he could no longer write.” The story is inconsequential unless\r\nSchuppanzigh had it from Beethoven who, as we have seen in an earlier\r\nvolume (Vol. I, p. 263 _et seq._), gave an entirely different account\r\nof the origin of his deafness to Neate. Holz talks to Beethoven now\r\nabout Schlesinger, telling him that it was the publisher’s purpose to\r\nprint the quartets in succession, which would postpone the appearance\r\nof the thirteenth for two years, and advises Beethoven hereafter to\r\nmake immediate publication a condition of purchase. He suggests that if\r\nhe were to threaten not to compose the quintets under the circumstances\r\nit might help.\r\n\r\n    _Smart.--Elle est morte.--Kalkbrenner est à Paris.--Broadwood,\r\n    Stodart, Tomkinson, Clementi and Co.--Les meilleurs Pièces à vendre\r\n    à Londres sont les Duettos pour le Piano Forte.--Mais je dis pour\r\n    nous de composer à présent.--Cramer, Moscheles, Neate, Potter....\r\n    J’ai voyagé par le Rhine et par la Donau.--Je suis Protestant; le\r\n    premier chose est d’être honnête homme.... Esterhazy.--Le nom de\r\n    Capitaine, ou comme tous les autres.--On faites de badinage contre\r\n    moi en Allemagne--contre lui--moi je suis Garçon._\r\n\r\n    _Karl._--He asked why you had not come before now; he said the 300\r\n    pounds of the Philhar. Society were not be to looked upon as the\r\n    principal thing. For that you needed only to appear 2 or 3 times in\r\n    the orchestra and make money with your own concerts.--He said that\r\n    in a short time you could make at least 1000 pounds and carry it\r\n    away with you.--10,000 florins, Vienna money.--If you would only\r\n    go. The 1,000 pounds would be easily earned and more.--You can do\r\n    better business with the publishers there than here.--And you’ll\r\n    find 1,000 friends, Smarth [_sic_] says, who will do everything\r\n    to help you.--The sea fish.--In the Thames....

It\r\n    was a most curious one and so plentiful that dishes came in as we\r\n    came out, for, unfortunately, we were rather in a hurry to get to\r\n    the stage coach by four, it being the only one going to Vienna\r\n    that evening. I overheard Beethoven say, “We will try how much the\r\n    Englishman can drink.” _He_ had the worst of the trial. I gave\r\n    him my diamond pin as a remembrance of the high gratification I\r\n    received by the honour of his invitation and kind reception and he\r\n    wrote me the following droll canon as fast as his pen could write\r\n    in about two minutes of time as I stood at the door ready to depart.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Ars longa vita brevis]\r\n\r\n    “Written on the 16th of September, 1825, in Baden, when my dear\r\n    talented musical artist and friend Smart (from England) visited me\r\n    here.\r\n\r\n  Ludwig van Beethoven.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A VISITOR FROM AMERICA]\r\n\r\nSmart left Vienna on his return journey to London on September 20.\r\nThree months later Beethoven received a visit from one who must have\r\nraised more curious questionings in his mind than did the brilliant\r\nyoung Englishman. With Smart he had corresponded years before. Smart\r\nhad produced his oratorio and his “Wellington’s Victory” in England\r\nand conducted the first performance in London of his Ninth Symphony;\r\nthere were direct bonds of sympathy between them. The other visitor\r\nbrought a message of appreciation from across the wide Atlantic. It\r\nwas Theodore Molt, evidently a German or a man of German birth, who,\r\na music teacher in Quebec, was making a European tour and gained the\r\nprivilege of telling Beethoven to his face how greatly he admired him,\r\nthen asked the favor of a souvenir which he could carry back on a\r\njourney of “3,000 hours” as a precious keepsake. For him, on December\r\n16, Beethoven wrote the canon, “Freu dich des Lebens” (Ges. Aus. Series\r\nXXV, 285, 5).[143]\r\n\r\nTo this period belongs an anecdote which is almost a parallel of one\r\nrelated by Zelter to Goethe. It was told[144] by Mittag, a bassoon\r\nplayer who had taken part in a performance of the Septet at a concert\r\non December 11. Going home one evening, Mittag stepped into a tavern\r\nknown as “Zum Dachs” to drink a glass of beer. Smoking was not allowed\r\nin the place and there were few guests. In a corner, however, sat\r\nBeethoven in the attitude of one lost in thought. After Mittag had\r\nwatched him a few minutes he jumped up and called to the waiter: “My\r\nbill!” “Already paid!” shrieked the waiter in his ear. Mittag, thinking\r\nthat Beethoven ought not to be left alone, followed him without\r\nbetraying himself and saw him enter his house safely.\r\n\r\nOn November 29, 1825, Beethoven was one of fifteen men elected to\r\nhonorary membership in the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde by the\r\ndirectors (Cherubini, Spontini, Spohr, Catel and Weigl being among\r\nthem); the election was confirmed by the society on January 26, 1826,\r\nbut the diploma was not issued until October 26, and thus reached\r\nBeethoven’s hands only a few months before his death. On November\r\n25, Beethoven wrote to Schott and Sons promising to send them the\r\nmetronome marks for the Mass in D soon, telling them to print the list\r\nof subscribers before the dedication, asking delay in the matter of the\r\ndedication of the Ninth Symphony, and requesting that the publication\r\nof both works be postponed three months. He gives the title of the mass\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n  _MISSA\r\n  Composita et\r\n  Serenissimo ac Eminentissimo Domino Domino\r\n  Rudolpho Joanni Cæsareo Principi et Archiduci Austriæ S. R. E.\r\n  Tit. S. Petri in monte aureo Cardinali Archiepiscopo Olomucensi\r\n  profundissima cum veneratione dicata_ [sic]\r\n  _a\r\n  Ludovico van Beethoven_\r\n\r\nOn the same day he wrote to Peters in Leipsic to the effect that his\r\nrecent letters had not been definite and certain. He wanted a specific\r\nstatement that the amount which he (Beethoven) had received as an\r\nadvance was 360 florins. If Peters was willing to take a quartet for\r\nthat sum he would send him one as soon as possible; if not, and he\r\npreferred to have the money, he would return it to him. “If you had\r\ndone this at once you might have had two quartets; but you can not ask\r\nme to be loser. If I wanted to draw the strings tighter I could ask a\r\nlarger price. I will send nothing for examination.” This, then, was\r\nBeethoven’s ultimatum: Peters must pay 360 florins for the Quartet or\r\nreceive back the money advanced three years before. Peters asked for\r\nthe money and it was paid over to Steiner and Co., on his order on\r\nDecember 7.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INTIMACY WITH THE BREUNINGS RENEWED]\r\n\r\nIn the renting season of St. Michael (September 29 to October 12)\r\nBeethoven signed a lease for lodgings in the Schwarzspanierhaus,\r\nAlservorstadt Glacis 200. Into this, which was the last lodging\r\noccupied by Beethoven, he moved presumably on October 15. The house,\r\nwhich is fully described and pictured in Gerhard von Breuning’s book\r\n“Aus dem Schwarzspanierhause,” derived its name from the fact that it\r\nhad been built by the Benedictines of Spain. In it Beethoven occupied\r\nfour rooms on the second floor, besides a kitchen and servant’s\r\nquarters. One of the most important results of Beethoven’s removal to\r\nthese quarters was a reëstablishment of the intimate relations which\r\nhad existed for so many years with the friend of his youth Stephan\r\nvon Breuning, a Councillor in the War Department of the Austrian\r\nGovernment, who lived hard by. Though there had been no open rupture\r\nbetween him and Beethoven an estrangement had existed from the time\r\nwhen von Breuning had advised against Beethoven’s assumption of the\r\nguardianship over his nephew. They had met occasionally _ad interim_,\r\nbut it was not until they became neighbors that the intimate friendship\r\nwhich had existed in earlier years was restored. A beginning in this\r\ndirection was made when, on a visit to Vienna in August, Beethoven\r\nmet the Breuning family in the street. It was necessary that changes\r\nbe made in the lodgings and while waiting for them Beethoven became\r\na frequent visitor at the Breunings, dining with them frequently and\r\nsometimes sending them a mess of fish, of which he was very fond.\r\nMadame von Breuning meanwhile looked after the fitting out of his\r\nkitchen and saw to the engagement of his servants. Concerning the\r\nrelations which existed between Beethoven and her father’s family,\r\nMarie, a daughter of Stephan von Breuning, wrote many years after:[145]\r\n\r\n    My mother once met Beethoven when on her way to the Kaiserbad\r\n    on the Danube; he accompanied her for the rather long distance\r\n    from the Rothes Haus, where she lived. She spent about an hour in\r\n    the bath-house (the bath being a warm one) and on coming out was\r\n    surprised to find Beethoven waiting to accompany her home. She\r\n    often said that he was always gallant towards women and had paid\r\n    court to her for a while.\r\n\r\n    She related, too, that his animated gestures, his loud voice and\r\n    his indifference towards others surprised the people in the street,\r\n    and that she was often ashamed because they stopped and took him\r\n    for a madman. His laugh was particularly loud and ringing.\r\n\r\n    My mother often and repeatedly deplored the fact that she had never\r\n    heard him play--but my father, in his unbounded tenderness, always\r\n    replied when she expressed a desire to hear him: “He doesn’t like\r\n    to do it, and I do not want to ask him because it might pain him\r\n    not to hear himself.”\r\n\r\n    Beethoven repeatedly invited my mother to coffee, or, as the\r\n    Viennese say, _zur Jause_; but my mother almost always declined, as\r\n    his domestic arrangements did not appear altogether appetizing.\r\n\r\n    My mother often said to my father that Beethoven’s habit of\r\n    expectorating in the room, his neglected clothing and his\r\n    extravagant behavior were not particularly attractive. My father\r\n    always replied: “And yet he has a great deal of success, especially\r\n    with women.”\r\n\r\n    Beethoven often told my mother that he longed greatly for domestic\r\n    happiness and much regretted that he had never married.\r\n\r\nBeethoven was fond of Stephan von Breuning’s son Gerhard, whom,\r\nbecause of his attachment to his father, he dubbed _Hosen-knopf_\r\n(Trousers-button) and because of his lightness of foot _Ariel_. He once\r\nhad the boy play for him, criticized the position of his hands and sent\r\nhim Clementi’s Method as preferable to Czerny’s which the lad was using.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the renewed association with von Breuning\r\nfrequently turned his thoughts to his old home and his boyhood friends\r\nin the Rhine country, and his delight must have been keen when in this\r\nyear, he received letters from Wegeler, whom he had not seen since\r\nhe left Vienna twenty-eight years before, and his wife, who had been\r\nEleonore von Breuning. They were tender letters, full of information\r\nabout their family, each other, friends and relations--real home\r\nletters telling of births, marriages, careers and deaths. One would\r\nthink that they ought to have been answered at once, but Beethoven did\r\nnot find time or occasion to write a reply until the next year, despite\r\nthis obvious challenge in Dr. von Wegeler’s letter:\r\n\r\n    Why did you not avenge the honor of your mother when, in the\r\n    Encyclopædia, and in France, you were set down as a love-child? The\r\n    Englishman who tried to defend you gave the filth a cuff, as we say\r\n    in Bonn, and let your mother carry you in her womb 30 years, since\r\n    the King of Prussia, your alleged father, died already in 1740--an\r\n    assertion which was altogether wrong since Frederick II ascended\r\n    the throne in 1740 and did not die till 1786. Only your inborn\r\n    dread of having anything but music of yours published is, probably,\r\n    the cause of this culpable indolence. If you wish it I will set the\r\n    world right in this matter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE LAST STRING QUARTETS]\r\n\r\nThe great contributions which Beethoven made to music in the year 1825,\r\nwere the Quartets in A minor, Op. 132 and in B-flat major, Op. 130,\r\nwhich were composed in the order here mentioned; but the second, being\r\npublished before its companion, received the earlier opus number. The A\r\nminor Quartet was the second of the three which Beethoven composed on\r\ninvitation of Prince Galitzin, the first being that in E-flat, Op. 127,\r\nthe third that in B-flat. It was taken up immediately on the completion\r\nof the E-flat Quartet. In March Beethoven had written to Neate that\r\nthe first of the three quartets which he thought of bringing with him\r\nto London was written, that he was at work on the second and that it\r\nand the third would be finished “soon.” On the same day he wrote to\r\nSchott and Sons: “The violin quartets are in hand; the second is nearly\r\nfinished.” The sketches of the A minor (as established by Nottebohm)\r\ndate back to 1824. The work was originally to have the customary four\r\nmovements; labor on it was interrupted by the illness of April and\r\nthen the plan was changed to include the “Song of Thanksgiving in\r\nthe Lydian mode,” the short march before the last movement, and the\r\nminuet. The work was finished by August at the latest. The passage in\r\neighth-notes in the second part of the first movement is practically\r\na quotation from one of the German dances written for the Ridotto\r\nballs fully thirty years before, with the bar-lines shifted so\r\nthat the change of harmony occurs on the up-beats of the measures.\r\nIn a Conversation Book used in May or June, 1825, Beethoven wrote\r\n_Dankeshimne eines Kranken an Gott bei seiner Genesung. Gefühl neuer\r\nKraft und wiedererwachtes Gefühl_ (“Hymn of Thanksgiving to God of an\r\nInvalid on his Convalescence. Feeling of new strength and reawakened\r\nfeeling”). In the original score this was changed to the reading:\r\n“Sacred Song of Thanksgiving of a Convalescent to the Divinity, in\r\nthe Lydian Mode. N. B. This piece has always B instead of B-flat.” As\r\nhas already been mentioned in the history of the Ninth Symphony, the\r\nprincipal theme of the last movement was originally conceived for the\r\nfinale of that work. The B-flat Quartet was begun early in the year, as\r\nthe letters to Neate and Schott indicate. On August 29, Beethoven wrote\r\nto his nephew that it would be wholly finished in ten or twelve days.\r\nIn November he himself writes in the Conversation Book: “Title for the\r\nQuartet,” and a strange hand adds: “_31ème Quatuor. Pour deux Violons,\r\nViola et Violoncello composé aux désirs de S. A. Monseigneur le Prince\r\nNicolas Galitzin et dédié au même_,” to which Beethoven adds: “par L.\r\nv. B.” The Quartet, though more than half-promised to Schlesinger, who\r\ngot the A minor Quartet, was sold to Artaria, and in January, 1826,\r\nHolz writes, “The Quartet will be printed at once; thus the third\r\nQuartet will appear before the first two.” This was the case, which\r\naccounts for the incorrect numbering of them. It had its first public\r\nperformance in March, 1826. The Fugue in B-flat, Op. 133, originally\r\nformed the finale of the work but was put aside after the first\r\nperformance and the present finale, which was composed in Gneixendorf\r\nin 1826, was substituted.\r\n\r\nAfter securing the A minor Quartet and an assurance that he should\r\nalso have that in B-flat (he had offered to deposit 80 ducats with a\r\nViennese banker against its completion and delivery and Beethoven had\r\naccepted his offer), Schlesinger said that he would purchase the first\r\nof the three Quartets from Schott and Sons so as to have all three\r\nfor his Complete Edition. Karl, in reporting the fact to Beethoven,\r\nexpressed his belief that the Schotts would sell for fear that if they\r\ndid not Schlesinger would reprint the work in Paris without permission.\r\nThe latter made a strenuous effort to get the autograph score of\r\nthe A minor, but had perforce to content himself with a copy. Holz\r\nrepresented to Beethoven that the autograph would be an asset for Karl\r\nin the future, and Karl was of the same opinion; he supported Holz’s\r\nassertion with the argument that such _Capitalien_ grew more valuable\r\nwith age and that he was sure Schlesinger would get 30 ducats for the\r\nmanuscript. Beethoven expressed indifference as to which publisher got\r\nthe works so long as he was promptly paid. In urging haste upon Holz,\r\nwho had undertaken to look after the copying of the B-flat, he wrote:\r\n\r\n    It is immaterial which hellhound licks and gnaws my brains, since\r\n    it must needs be so, only see that the answer is not delayed\r\n    too long. The hellhound in L. can wait and meanwhile entertain\r\n    himself with Mephistopheles (the Editor of the Musik. L. Zeit.) in\r\n    Auerbach’s Cellar; he will soon be plucked by the ears by Belzebub\r\n    the chief of devils.\r\n\r\nThe Leipsic “hellhound” thus consigned to Belzebub was, of course,\r\nPeters. It was about this time that Karl told his uncle an anecdote\r\nto the effect that Cherubini, asked why he did not compose a quartet,\r\nreplied: “If Beethoven had never written a quartet I would write\r\nquartets; as it is, I can not.” After the meetings at Schlesinger’s\r\nroom in the inn “Zum wilden Mann” the Quartets in E-flat and A minor\r\nwere played again at a concert in which Schuppanzigh was prevented from\r\ntaking part, and Holz played the first violin. Beethoven grew merry at\r\nhis expense and wrote a canon in the Conversation Book to the words:\r\n“Holz fiddles the quartets as if they were treading _Kraut_.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PRAISE FROM THE BEPRAISED]\r\n\r\nTwo trifles which kept company with the Quartets in this year were\r\na Waltz in D and an Écossaise in E-flat for pianoforte, which were\r\npublished in a collection of light music by C. F. Müller. There are\r\nseveral allusions to the oratorio commissioned by the Gesellschaft\r\nder Musikfreunde in the Conversation Books of 1825, in one of which\r\nGrillparzer is mentioned as a likely author for another book; but so\r\nfar as is known no work was done on “The Victory of the Cross,” though\r\nBernard shortened the book. Before the end of the year the principal\r\ntheme of the Quartet in C-sharp minor, Op. 131, is noted, accompanied\r\nby the words written by Beethoven: “Only the praise of one who has\r\nenjoyed praise can give pleasure”;--it is, no doubt, a relic of some of\r\nthe composer’s classic readings.[146]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[121] The correspondence nowhere shows a modification of the\r\nstipulation that the Symphony was to be the exclusive property of the\r\nSociety for 18 months. But Kirchhoffer, Ries’s representative, knew of\r\nthe preparations for the Vienna performance.\r\n\r\n[122] Dr. Deiters thinks Ries’s hesitation was due to fear of\r\ndifficulties in the performance--a fear which was realized; it is more\r\nlikely, however, as may be deduced from the context of the letter, that\r\nRies felt that his London friends were not being treated fairly in the\r\nmatter, Beethoven having entered upon an obligation with them to let\r\nthem have exclusive possession of the Symphony for eighteen months\r\nafter the time of delivery.\r\n\r\n[123] Had he wholly forgotten the letter in which he offered\r\nSchlesinger the Mass in 1822 and said that it would grieve him very\r\nmuch if he could not give him “just this particular work”?\r\n\r\n[124] The canons were those on Hoffmann and Schwenke.\r\n\r\n[125] The remark is meaningless and was made only for the sake of a\r\nplay on words--_Rache_ and _Rachen_. Beethoven professed friendship to\r\nHaslinger to the end, though he lampooned him in private.\r\n\r\n[126] The mark is _Allegro con moto_ in the Complete Edition;\r\n_Allo. commodo_ in others. Joachim’s edition gives the _commodo_ in\r\nparenthesis.\r\n\r\n[127] There are pitiful proofs in the Conversation Books that simple\r\nsums in addition were more than he could master and that on his\r\ndeathbed he studied the mysteries of multiplication.\r\n\r\n[128] Vol. II. p. 107 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[129] Beethoven’s table habits were thus described by Holz to Jahn: “He\r\nwas a stout eater of substantial food; he drank a great deal of wine at\r\ntable, but could stand a great deal, and in merry company he sometimes\r\nbecame tipsy (_bekneipte er sich_). In the evening he drank beer or\r\nwine, generally the wine of Vöslau or red Hungarian. When he had drunk\r\nhe never composed. After the meal he took a walk.”\r\n\r\n[130] See the preface to his biography.\r\n\r\n[131] The date is Schindler’s, but a palpable error; it may have been\r\n1834.\r\n\r\n[132] It was among Thayer’s papers.\r\n\r\n[133] Notes of Jahn’s interviews with Holz were among Thayer’s papers.\r\n\r\n[134] “Aus meinem Leben,” Berlin, 1861, Vol. II, p. 24 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[135] It was probably the performance by Böhm.\r\n\r\n[136] Antonia Cibbini, _née_ Koželuch, was among those who attended the\r\nperformance of the Quartet. In the conversation which followed, Karl\r\ntells his uncle: “The Cibbini looked to me like a bacchante when the\r\nQuartet was played; it pleased her so greatly.”\r\n\r\n[137] By the “Characteristic Symphony” Smart meant the Ninth, which\r\nhe had directed at its first performance in London on March 21, 1825.\r\nMr. Thayer visited Sir George in February, 1861, and received from\r\nhim permission to make a transcript of all the entries in his journal\r\ntouching the meetings with Beethoven, also supplementing them with oral\r\ninformation. The journal remained in manuscript for forty years after\r\nSir George’s death and then was edited by H. Bertram Cox and C. L. E.\r\nCox and published by Longmans, Green and Co. in 1907, under the title:\r\n“Leaves from the Journals of Sir George Smart.” The extracts here\r\nquoted are from the book, and show signs of having been revised after\r\nThayer copied them.\r\n\r\n[138] Not the composer, but a pianoforte maker of Vienna.\r\n\r\n[139] The Thayer transcript has it correctly: “at the inn _Zum wilden\r\nMann_.”\r\n\r\n[140] In the Thayer transcript: “the second of the three MSS.\r\nquartettes bought by Schlesinger.”\r\n\r\n[141] Dr. Deiters prints in a foot-note a different version of this\r\nstory from Castelli’s memoirs. According to this it was Castelli who\r\nset the theme for Beethoven, he having, after long urging, said,\r\n“Very well, in the name of the three devils; but Castelli, who has no\r\nidea of pianoforte playing, must give me a theme.” Thereupon Castelli\r\nbrushed his finger up and down three adjacent keys of the pianoforte\r\nand these notes Beethoven continually wove into the music which he\r\nimprovised for an hour, by the clock. Smart names the ten men who\r\ncomposed Schlesinger’s party; Castelli’s is not among them, and Smart’s\r\nstory, noted in his journal at the time, is unquestionably correct.\r\nSchlesinger may have given another dinner, or Castelli’s imagination\r\nbeen livelier than his memory.\r\n\r\n[142] When Mr. Thayer visited Sir George Smart in London in 1861 he\r\nmade the following notes of the conversation: Smart spoke, or rather\r\nwrote on Beethoven’s slate;--he had been warned not to write in\r\nBeethoven’s books--in French, a language which Beethoven (as he says)\r\nspoke fluently. He (Smart) was particularly desirous of understanding\r\nBeethoven’s intentions as to the performance of the Choral Sym. and\r\nspoke with him about the recitative for instruments in the last\r\nmovement. Beethoven’s reply was:\r\n\r\n“The recitative in strict time.”\r\n\r\nSmart objected, that so played, it was not a recitative nor had words\r\nto recite. Beethoven replied, “he called it so;” and finally closed\r\nthe discussion with “I _wish_ it to go in strict time”; which, from\r\na composer, was of course decisive. The question of how the bass\r\nrecitatives ought to be played had already been discussed when the\r\nrehearsals for the concert of 1824 were in progress, as may be seen\r\nin a Conversation Book of March: _Schindler_:--“How many contrabasses\r\nare to play the recitative?--All!--There would be no difficulty in\r\nstrict time, but to give it in a singing style will make careful study\r\nnecessary.--If old Krams were still alive we could let the matter go\r\nunconcernedly, for he directed 12 contrabasses who had to do what he\r\nwanted.--Good; then just as if words were under it?--If necessary I\r\nwill write words under it so that they may learn to sing.”\r\n\r\n[143] From Thayer’s note-book of 1857: “Circumstance related to\r\nme by the son of Mr. Molt. When Mr. Molt called upon Beethoven,\r\nDecember 16, 1825, (B.’s birthday) Beethoven showed him some verses\r\nhe had just written complimentary to a young lady and fell into\r\nsuch enthusiasm talking about her that he passed entirely from his\r\nmusical conversation. Verses poor enough, Mr. Molt said. Mr. Molt also\r\ndescribed the meanness of the rooms in which B. lived.”\r\n\r\n[144] To Thayer; from his note-book.\r\n\r\n[145] In a memorandum for Thayer.\r\n\r\n[146] _Laudari a viro laudate_--Nævius. _Lætus sum laudari me, inquit\r\nHector, opinor apud Nævium, abs te, pater, a laudate viro_--Cicero _ad\r\nfam._ XV, 6; _Cum tragicus ille apud nos ait magnificum esse laudari a\r\nlaudato viro, laude digno, ait._--Seneca, _Epist._ 102, 16.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\n\r\n    A Year of Sickness and Sorrow: 1826--The Quartets in\r\n    B-Flat, C-Sharp Minor and F Major--Controversy with Prince\r\n    Galitzin--Dedication of the Ninth Symphony--Life at\r\n    Gneixendorf--Beethoven’s Last Compositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A REQUEST FOR THE GERMAN BIBLE]\r\n\r\nThe year which witnessed the last of Beethoven’s completed labors,\r\nand saw what by general consent might be set down as the greatest of\r\nhis string quartets, that in C-sharp minor, Op. 131, beheld also the\r\nculmination of the grief and pain caused by the conduct of his nephew.\r\nThe year 1826 was a year of awful happenings and great achievements;\r\na year of startling contradictions, in which the most grievous blows\r\nwhich an inscrutable Providence dealt the composer as if utterly to\r\ncrush him to earth, were met by a display of creative energy which\r\nwas amazing not only in its puissance but also in its exposition of\r\ntransfigured emotion and imagination. The history of the year can\r\nbest be followed if it be told in two sections, for which reason we\r\nhave chosen to group the incidents connected with the nephew in a\r\nchapter by themselves and review first the artistic activities of the\r\ncomposer. After the history of the year has been set forth there will\r\nremain to be told only the story of the gathering of the gloom which\r\nearly in the next year shut down over his mortal eyes forever. The\r\nfigure which stands out in highest relief throughout the year beside\r\nthat of the composer is that of Holz, whose concern for his welfare\r\ngoes into the smallest detail of his unfortunate domestic life and\r\nincludes also the major part of the labors and responsibilities caused\r\nby the tragical outcome of the nephew’s waywardness--his attempt at\r\nself-destruction. Schindler appears at intervals, but with jealous\r\nreserve, chary of advice, waiting to be asked for his opinion and\r\npettishly protesting that after it once has been given it will not be\r\nacted upon. Stephan von Breuning appears in all the nobility of his\r\nnature; and in the attitude and acts of Brother Johann, though they\r\nhave been severely faulted and, we fear, maligned, there is evidence of\r\nsomething as near affectionate sympathy and interest as Beethoven’s\r\nparadoxical conduct and nature invited of him. Among the other persons\r\nwhom the Conversation Books disclose as his occasional associates are\r\nSchuppanzigh, Kuffner, Grillparzer, Abbé Stadler and Mathias Artaria,\r\nwhose talk is chiefly about affairs in which they are concerned, though\r\nKuffner at one time entertains Beethoven with a discourse on things\r\nancient and modern which must have fascinated the artist whose mind\r\never delighted to dwell on matters of large moment. Beethoven was\r\ntroubled with a spell of sickness which began near the end of January\r\nand lasted till into March. Dr. Braunhofer was called and we read the\r\nfamiliar injunctions in the Conversation Book. The composer has pains\r\nin the bowels, gouty twinges, and finds locomotion difficult. He is\r\nadvised to abstain from wine for a few days and also from coffee,\r\nwhich he is told is injurious because of its stimulating effect on\r\nthe nerves. The patient is advised to eat freely of soups, and small\r\ndoses of quinine are prescribed. There are postponed obligations of\r\nduty--the oratorio, the opera, a _Requiem_--upon the composer which\r\noccupy him somewhat, but his friends and advisers more. His thoughts\r\nare not with such things but in the congenial region of the Quartets;\r\nfor the little community of stringed instruments is become more than\r\never his colporteur, confidant, comforter and oracle. Kuffner tells him\r\nthrough Holz that he has read Bernard’s oratorio book but cannot find\r\nin it even the semblance of an oratorio, much less half-good execution.\r\nPerhaps there is something of personal equation in this judgment, for\r\nKuffner is ready to write not only one but even two oratorio texts if\r\nBeethoven will but undertake their composition. He presents the plan\r\nof a work to be called “The Four Elements,” in which man is to be\r\nbrought into relationship with the imposing phenomena of nature, but\r\nBeethoven has been inspired by a study of Handel’s “Saul” with a desire\r\nto undertake that subject and Kuffner submits specimens of his poetical\r\nhandiwork to him. He had become interested in the ancient modes (as\r\nhis Song of Thanksgiving in the Lydian mode in the A minor quartet had\r\nalready witnessed) and was now eager to read up on the ancient Hebrews.\r\nHe sends Holz to get him books on the subject and to a visitor, who to\r\nus is a stranger (so far as the handwriting in the C. B. is concerned),\r\nhe expresses a desire to get Luther’s translation of the Bible. He is\r\nalso interested in religious questions, as a long talk with his nephew\r\nshows. Kuffner intended in his treatment of the story of Saul to make\r\nit a representation of the triumph of the nobler impulses of man over\r\nuntamed desire, and said that he would be ready to deliver the book in\r\nsix weeks. Holz shows Beethoven some of the specimen sheets and points\r\nout a place in which Beethoven might indulge in an excursion into\r\nantique art. “Here you might introduce a chorus in the Lydian mode,” he\r\nsays. He also explains that Kuffner intended to treat the chorus as an\r\neffective agent in the action, for which purpose it was to be divided\r\ninto two sections, like the dramatic chorus of the Greek tragedians.\r\nKuffner was sufficiently encouraged to write the book and Holz says\r\nthat Beethoven finished the music of the first part “In his head”; if\r\nso, it staid there, so far as the sketchbooks bear testimony.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WORKS WHICH WERE NEVER WRITTEN]\r\n\r\nGrillparzer still hopes that the breath of musical life will be\r\nbreathed into “Melusine”; Duport, having secured the Court Opera, asks\r\nfor it, and Brother Johann and Karl urge that an opera is the most\r\nremunerative enterprise to which he can now apply himself. Schlesinger,\r\nin Berlin, had told Count von Brühl that Beethoven was disposed to\r\nwrite an opera for the Royal Opera at the Prussian capital and Brühl\r\nhad written to the composer that he would be glad to have an opera from\r\nhim and expressed a desire that he collaborate with Grillparzer in its\r\nmaking; but he did not want “Melusine,” because of the resemblance\r\nbetween its subject and that of de la Motte-Fouqué’s “Undine.” An\r\nadaptation to operatic uses of Goethe’s “Claudine von Villa Bella” was\r\ndiscussed, apparently with favor, but Kanne, who was designated to take\r\nthe adaptation in hand, was afraid to meddle with the great poet’s\r\ndrama. So nothing came of the Berlin project or of “Melusine,” though\r\nGrillparzer talked it over again with Beethoven and told Holz that\r\nthough he was not inclined to attach too great importance to it, he yet\r\nthought it would be hard to find an opera text better adapted to its\r\npurpose than it, from a musical and scenic point of view. To Schindler,\r\nBeethoven once held out a prospect that “something would come” of the\r\nidea of music for “Faust” which Rochlitz had implanted in Beethoven’s\r\nmind; but it shared the fate of opera and oratorio. His friends also\r\nurged him to compose a Requiem mass and such a composition belongs in\r\nthe category with the oratorio as a work which he had been paid to\r\nundertake. Among the ardent admirers of Beethoven and most zealous\r\npatrons of the Schuppanzigh Quartets was Johann Nepomuk Wolfmayer, a\r\nmuch respected cloth merchant. One of the methods chosen by Wolfmayer\r\nto show his appreciation of the composer was occasionally to have a new\r\ncoat made for him which he would bring to Beethoven’s lodgings, place\r\nupon a chair and then see to it that an old one disappeared from his\r\nwardrobe. We have already heard a similar story from Mayseder. It is\r\nsaid that Wolfmayer sometimes had difficulty in getting the composer’s\r\nconsent to the exchange, but always managed to do it. Early in the\r\nsecond decade of the century Wolfmayer commissioned Beethoven to write\r\na _Requiem_ for him and paid him 1,000 florins as an advance on the\r\nhonorarium. Beethoven promised, but never set to work: though Holz says\r\nthat he was firmly resolved to do so and, in talking about it, said\r\nthat he was better satisfied with Cherubini’s setting of the text of\r\nthe Mass for the Dead than with Mozart’s. A _Requiem_, he said, should\r\nbe a sorrowful memorial of the dead and have nothing in it of the\r\nnoises of the last trump and the day of judgment.\r\n\r\nThe sketchbooks bear witness, though not voluminously, to two other\r\nworks of magnitude which were in Beethoven’s thoughts in this year but\r\nnever saw completion. These were a symphony and a string quintet. In\r\na book used towards the end of 1825, containing sketches for the last\r\nmovement of the Quartet in B-flat, there is a memorandum of a _Presto_\r\nin C minor, 3-4 time, and of a short movement in A-flat, _Andante_,\r\nwhich Schindler marked as belonging to “the tenth symphony.” There\r\nare also some much longer sketches for an overture on B-a-c-h, in the\r\nmidst of which Beethoven has written: “This overture together with\r\nthe new symphony and we shall have a new concert (_Akademie_) in the\r\nKärnthnerthor.” Schindler published the sketches of the symphony in\r\nHirschbach’s “Musikalisch-kritisches Repertorium” of January, 1844,\r\nand started the story of an uncompleted tenth symphony. Nottebohm, in\r\nhis “Zweite Beethoveniana” (p. 12), scouts the idea that Beethoven\r\noccupied himself seriously with the composition of such a work. “It is\r\nnot necessary,” he says, “to turn over many leaves of the sketchbooks\r\nto prove the untenableness of the view that if Beethoven had written\r\na Tenth Symphony it would have been on the basis of these sketches.\r\nWe see in them only such momentary conceits as came to Beethoven by\r\nthe thousand and which were as much destined to be left undeveloped\r\nas the multitude of other abandoned sketches in the other books.\r\nTo be big with a symphony argues persevering application to it. Of\r\nsuch application there can be no talk in this case. The sketches in\r\nquestion were never continued; there is not a vestige of them in the\r\nbooks which follow. If Beethoven had written as many symphonies as\r\nhe began we should have at least fifty.” Nottebohm’s argument does\r\nnot dispose of the matter, though we shall presently find occasion to\r\nthink well of it. Lenz says that Holz wrote to him that Beethoven had\r\nplayed “the whole of the Tenth Symphony” for him on the pianoforte,\r\nthat it was finished in all of its movements in the sketches, but\r\nthat nobody but Beethoven could decipher them. Holz, however, made no\r\nsuch broad statement to Otto Jahn, a much more conscientious reporter\r\nthan Lenz. To Jahn he said that there was an introduction in E-flat\r\nmajor, a soft piece, and then a powerful Allegro in C minor, which were\r\ncomplete in Beethoven’s head and which he had played to him (Holz) on\r\nthe pianoforte. This is very different from an entire symphony. But\r\nin the letter to Moscheles which Schindler says Beethoven dictated to\r\nhim on March 18, 1827, bearing a message of thanks to the Philharmonic\r\nSociety of London, Beethoven says: “An entire sketched symphony lies\r\nin my desk, also a new overture and other things”; and a few days\r\nlater Schindler writes to Moscheles: “Three days after receiving your\r\nletter he was greatly excited and demanded the sketches of the Tenth\r\nSymphony, concerning the plan of which he told me a great deal. He has\r\nnow definitely decided that it shall go to the Philharmonic Society.”\r\nThe reader is familiar with Beethoven’s habit of speaking of works as\r\nfinished though not a note of them had been put on paper (as in the\r\ncase of the additional movements for the Mass in D, for instance), and\r\nif there were sketches for a finished symphony in Beethoven’s desk when\r\nhe died, it is passing strange that Schindler did not produce them\r\nwhen he started the world to talking about its loss of a successor to\r\nthe Ninth. What Nottebohm saw in the books deposited by Schindler in\r\nthe Royal Library in Berlin seems to justify what he said, at least.\r\nMoreover, Schindler says that the sketches for the Symphony dated back\r\nto 1824, and the incorrectness of this statement can be shown beyond\r\nall peradventure by Nottebohm’s study of the sketchbooks. Of the other\r\nworks which play a part in the story of 1826, something will be said\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEETHOVEN’S FAVORITE QUARTET]\r\n\r\nOpera, oratorio, the mass for the dead, symphony, beckoned to him, but\r\nhis affections were fixed in the higher and purer regions of chamber\r\nmusic, the form which represents chaste ideals, lofty imagination,\r\nprofound learning; which exacts a mutual sympathy between composer,\r\nperformer and listener and binds them in something like that angelic\r\nwedlock which Weber said to Planché ought to unite librettist and\r\ncomposer. When the year 1826 opened, Beethoven was looking forward\r\nwith no little eagerness to the first performance of the Quartet in\r\nB-flat--his “Liebquartett” it is once called in the Conversation Books.\r\nSchuppanzigh and his fellows had taken it in hand. They found the\r\nconcluding fugue extremely troublesome, but the Cavatina entranced them\r\nat once; Schuppanzigh entered a record against any change in it. The\r\nperformance took place on March 21. The second and fourth movements had\r\nto be repeated, but the fugue proved a _crux_ as, no doubt, the players\r\nhad expected it would. Some of Beethoven’s friends argued that it had\r\nnot been understood and that this objection would vanish with repeated\r\nhearings; others, plainly a majority, asked that a new movement be\r\nwritten to take its place. Johann van Beethoven told the composer that\r\n“the whole city” was delighted with the work. Schindler says that\r\nthe _Danza alla tedesca_, one of the movements which were demanded a\r\nsecond time, was originally intended for another quartet, presumably\r\nthat in A minor. Lenz objects to the theory on critical grounds, but\r\nNottebohm points out that the first sketches appear in A before the\r\nsketches for the B-flat Quartet and assigns them to the A minor Quartet\r\nwithout qualification of any kind. Dr. Deiters suggests that the\r\nmovement was written for the A minor Quartet and put aside when the\r\nSong of Thanksgiving presented itself to Beethoven’s mind. There is\r\nanother reason for believing that Nottebohm is right and Lenz, as he\r\nso frequently is, is wrong. As has been mentioned, Beethoven recurred\r\nto one of his old German dances, written for the Ridotto balls, in the\r\nfirst movement of the A minor Quartet; what more likely than that,\r\nthinking over the old German dance, he should have conceived the idea\r\nof a _Danza tedesca_? Schuppanzigh’s high opinion of the Cavatina was\r\nshared by many and also by Beethoven himself. Holz said that it cost\r\nthe composer tears in the writing and brought out the confession that\r\nnothing that he had written had so moved him; in fact, that merely to\r\nrevive it afterwards in his thoughts and feelings brought forth renewed\r\ntributes of tears.\r\n\r\nThe doubts about the effectiveness of the fugue felt by Beethoven’s\r\nfriends found an echo in the opinions of the critics. Mathias Artaria,\r\nthe publisher, who seems in this year to have entered the circle\r\nof the composer’s intimate associates, presented the matter to him\r\nin a practicable light. He had purchased the publishing rights of\r\nthe Quartet and after the performance he went to Beethoven with the\r\nsuggestion that he write a new finale and that the fugue be published\r\nas an independent piece, for which he would remunerate him separately.\r\nBeethoven listened to the protests unwillingly, but, “vowing he would\r\nne’er consent, consented” and requested the pianist Anton Halm, who\r\nhad played in the B-flat Trio at the concert, to make the pianoforte\r\narrangements for which there had already been inquiries at Artaria’s\r\nshop. Halm accepted the commission and made the arrangement, with\r\nwhich Beethoven was not satisfied; “You have divided the parts too\r\nmuch between _prim_ and second,” he remarked to Halm,[147] referring\r\nto a device which the arranger had adopted to avoid crossing of\r\nhands--giving passages to the right hand which should logically have\r\nbeen given to the left, the effect being the same to the ear but not to\r\nthe eye. Nevertheless, Halm presented a claim for 40 florins to Artaria\r\nfor the work, and was paid. Beethoven then made an arrangement and\r\nsent it to Artaria, also demanding a fee. To this Artaria demurred and\r\nasked Beethoven for Halm’s manuscript. Beethoven sent it by a messenger\r\n(probably Holz) with instructions to get his arrangement in return for\r\nit, but at the same time told Artaria, that while he did not ask that\r\nArtaria publish his work, he was under no obligations to give it to\r\nhim; he might have it for twelve ducats. Artaria reconciled himself\r\nto the matter and paid Beethoven his fee on September 5. Schindler\r\nincorrectly states that the arrangement which Artaria announced on\r\nMarch 10, 1827, as Op. 134 (the original score being advertised at the\r\nsame time as Op. 133), was Halm’s.\r\n\r\nOther performances of the Quartet were planned, but it does not appear\r\nthat any took place. Schuppanzigh was indisposed to venture upon a\r\nrepetition, but Böhm and Mayseder were eager to play it. The latter\r\nwith his companions gave quartet parties at the house of Dembscher, an\r\nagent of the Austrian War Department, and wanted to produce the Quartet\r\nthere. But Dembscher had neglected to subscribe for Schuppanzigh’s\r\nconcert and had said that he would have it played at his house, since\r\nit was easy for him to get manuscripts from Beethoven for that purpose.\r\nHe applied to Beethoven for the Quartet, but the latter refused to let\r\nhim have it, and Holz, as he related to Beethoven, told Dembscher in\r\nthe presence of other persons that Beethoven would not let him have\r\nany more music because he had not attended Schuppanzigh’s concert.\r\nDembscher stammered in confusion and begged Holz to find some means\r\nto restore him to Beethoven’s good graces. Holz said that the first\r\nstep should be to send Schuppanzigh 50 florins, the price of the\r\nsubscription. Dembscher laughingly asked, “Must it be?” (_Muss es\r\nsein?_). When Holz related the incident to Beethoven he too laughed and\r\ninstantly wrote down a canon on the words: “It must be! Yes, yes, yes,\r\nit must be. Out with the purse!”[148]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ORIGIN OF “ES MUSS SEIN!”]\r\n\r\nOut of this joke in the late fall of the year grew the finale of the\r\nlast of the last five quartets, that in F major. Op. 135, to which\r\nBeethoven gave the superscription: “The difficult resolution” (_Der\r\nschwergefasste Entschluss_). The story, almost universally current and\r\nstill repeated, that the phrases: _Muss es sein_? _Es muss sein_, and\r\n_Der schwergefasste Entschluss_ had their origin in\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Es muss sein! Es muss sein! ja, ja, ja, ja\r\n  It must be! It must be! yes, yes, yes, yes\r\n\r\n  Es muss sein! ja, ja, ja, ja Es muss sein! ja, ja, ja, ja\r\n  It must be! yes, yes, yes, yes, It must be! yes, yes, yes, yes\r\n\r\n  Heraus mit dem Beutel! Heraus! Heraus: Es muss sein!\r\n  Come down with the rhino! Come down! Come down! It must be!\r\n\r\n  Ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, Es muss sein!\r\n  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, It must be!\r\n]\r\n\r\na scene frequently repeated when Beethoven’s housekeeper came to him\r\nof a Saturday for the weekly house-money, was spread by Schindler, who\r\nwas familiar in a way with the Dembscher incident but assigned it to\r\nthe Quartet in E-flat. Holz was an actor in the scene and is the better\r\nwitness, being confirmed, moreover, by the Conversation Book. Schindler\r\nprobably took his clue from a page in the Conversation Book used in\r\nDecember, 1826, in which Beethoven writes the phrases “Must it be?” and\r\n“It must be,” and Schindler, after a conversation in which Schuppanzigh\r\ntakes part, concludes with: “It must be. The old woman is again in need\r\nof her weekly money.” The joke played a part in the conversations with\r\nBeethoven for some time.\r\n\r\nHolz says that when once he remarked to Beethoven that the one in\r\nB-flat was the greatest of his Quartets the composer replied: “Each\r\nin its way. Art demands of us that we shall not stand still. You\r\nwill find a new manner of voice treatment (part writing) and, thank\r\nGod! there _is less lack of fancy than ever before_.” Afterward he\r\ndeclared the C-sharp minor Quartet to be his greatest. The first form\r\nof the fugue-theme in this work, as has been noted, was written down\r\nin a Conversation Book in the last days of December, 1825. The theme\r\nof the variations, in a form afterwards altered, was also noted amid\r\nthe records of conversations before the end of January, 1826. It is\r\nlikely that a goodly portion of the work was written within a month and\r\nready for the copyist, for Schuppanzigh once in January suggests that\r\nsomething from the work in hand be tried. Whether or not it was ever\r\nplayed in the lifetime of the composer can not be said with certainty.\r\nSchindler says positively that it was not. It was ready for the\r\npublisher in July and Schott and Sons, who had bought it for 80 ducats\r\npayable in two installments, sent the drafts early to accommodate\r\nBeethoven, who spoke of being on the eve of a short journey--of which\r\nnothing is known save that he did not make it. The score was turned\r\nover to Schott’s agent in Vienna on August 7. On the copy Beethoven\r\nhad written “Put together from pilferings from one thing and another”\r\n(_Zusammengestohlen aus Verschiedenem diesem und Jenem_). This alarmed\r\nthe publishers, who wrote to Beethoven about it and in reply received\r\na letter stating: “You wrote me that the quartet must be an original\r\none. As a joke I wrote on the copy ‘Put together, etc....’; but it is\r\nbrand new.” It was published by Schott and Sons very shortly after\r\nBeethoven’s death in April, 1827, under the opus number 129. Beethoven\r\noriginally intended to dedicate it to Wolfmayer but out of gratitude to\r\nBaron von Stutterheim, Lieutenant Fieldmarshal, who had made a place\r\nfor Nephew Karl in his regiment, placed his name upon the title-page.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PRINCE GALITZIN AND HIS QUARTETS]\r\n\r\nWith the Quartet in B-flat, Beethoven had completed the three works of\r\nits kind which he had been commissioned to compose by Prince Nicolas\r\nGalitzin. He had taken three years to perform the task, but in the\r\nend the patience of his patron had been nobly rewarded--rewarded,\r\nindeed, in a manner which insured him as large a share of immortality\r\nas falls to the lot of a man--and meanwhile he had been privileged\r\nto shine in the musical circles of St. Petersburg as one who stood\r\npeculiarly close to the greatest of living composers. During the delay\r\nPrince Galitzin’s conduct was in the highest degree honorable. In his\r\nletters he was most generous in his offers of assistance, practically\r\ngiving Beethoven _carte blanche_ to draw on his bankers in case of\r\nneed. He organized a performance of the _Missa solemnis_ (the first\r\ngiven of the work or any portion of it), and presented his copy of the\r\nwritten score to the Philharmonic Society of St. Petersburg. He was so\r\nproud of his collection of Beethoven’s music that he applied to the\r\ncomposer himself to help him make it complete. Too eager to wait for\r\nthe publishers, he commissioned Beethoven to have copies made of new\r\nworks, like the Ninth Symphony and the overture to “The Consecration\r\nof the House,” at his expense. He entertained the idea of repeating\r\nin St. Petersburg the concert which Beethoven had given in Vienna, at\r\nwhich the Symphony had received its first performance. For a while\r\nhe contemplated a repetition of the Mass. Beethoven had dedicated the\r\noverture to him and he had written that he would requite the act with\r\na gift of 25 ducats. All this before he received the Quartets. Then a\r\nstrange and unaccountable change came over his attitude towards the\r\ncomposer. Beethoven sent the first Quartet to him in January, 1825;\r\nthe second and third sometime in February, 1826. He had followed up\r\nhis commission in 1823 with an order to his bankers, Henikstein and\r\nCo. in Vienna, to pay Beethoven 50 ducats, the fee agreed upon, for\r\neach Quartet. The money was paid over in October, 1823, but with his\r\nexpress consent, at Beethoven’s request, was applied to the payment\r\nof his subscription for the Mass. If there could be any doubt on this\r\npoint it would be dissipated by the letter in which Henikstein and\r\nCo., forwarded Beethoven’s receipt. This letter was written on October\r\n15, 1823, and stated that the sum had been paid _comme honoraire de la\r\nmesse que nous expediée par l’entremise de la haute chancellerie de\r\nl’État_. On December 5, 1824, let us say six weeks or two months before\r\nhe received the first Quartet, he sent another 50 ducats, which it is\r\nfair to assume was the fee for that work and took the place of the sum\r\ndiverted to the payment for the Mass. These facts must be carefully\r\nnoted and borne in mind, for the question of Galitzin’s indebtedness to\r\nBeethoven became the subject of a scandalous controversy a long time\r\nafter the composer’s death; it endured down to 1838 and might be opened\r\nagain were there a disposition in any quarter to do so. For the present\r\nthe story of the Quartets during Beethoven’s lifetime may be pursued\r\nas it is disclosed by records in the Conversation Books and so much of\r\nthe correspondence as has been preserved.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1826, one of the Quartets, perhaps both of them, had been\r\nsent to St. Petersburg by special courier. (“Everything written by\r\nBeethoven ought to be sent to its destination by special courier,” is\r\none of Schuppanzigh’s magnificent remarks when the question of sending\r\nthe Quartet to the Prince is under discussion.) The money did not\r\ncome and Beethoven grew impatient and anxious. Karl tried to reassure\r\nhim. The Prince had written _Je vais_, he remarks in the Conversation\r\nBook, plainly referring to a letter dated January 14, 1826, in which\r\nPrince Galitzin had said: “_Je vais faire remettre à M. Stieglitz_\r\n(his banker) _la valeur de 75 ducats pour vous être remis par M.\r\nFries; 50 pour le quatuor et 25 pour l’ouverture qui est magnifique\r\net que je vous remercie beaucoup de m’avoir dédiée_.” Still the money\r\ndid not come. In the middle of May Holz reports to Beethoven that a\r\nletter had been received from the courier, whose name was Lipscher.\r\nHe had called on Prince Galitzin, who had begged to be excused; “he\r\nhad not time--call another day.” He had repeated the visit five or six\r\ntimes, but each time was denied an audience on one pretext or another.\r\nFinally, he had bribed a domestic with five florins and found his\r\nway to the Prince, who seemed greatly embarrassed, fumbled amongst\r\nhis scores for a time and then asked him to come again before his\r\ndeparture and he would give him the money. The courier had added that\r\nhe considered it a “Russian trick” but that he was not to be disposed\r\nof so easily. Lipscher would be back in Vienna in four or five days,\r\nHolz added, and advised Beethoven to await his coming before writing\r\nto him. Schindler, a short time after, gives his views in a style\r\ncharacteristic of his attitude toward Beethoven during the period of\r\nHolz’s factotumship: “The matter of the Prince Galitzin is getting\r\ncritical and I wish you a happy outcome. If you had obeyed me he would\r\nhave had only one quartet and with that _basta_. You never permitted\r\nyourself to be deceived by flattery as you have by this princely\r\nbraggart.” Again: “_Voila_, the letter to Count Lebzeltern (Russian\r\nAmbassador) and the banker Stieglitz. They can go to-day as it is great\r\npostday. What more is there to be considered? Wait, and wait--and no\r\nresults. Breuning is agreed. If Prince Galitzin could act in such\r\ncontradiction to his letters nothing good is to be expected of him.”\r\nAt a later date there came another letter from the courier. He had\r\ntried seven times to see the Prince, but all in vain. Later (it was now\r\nJuly) he had gone again; the Prince had been polite, but denied him\r\nadmittance. Still later in the same month Karl tells his uncle that he\r\nwants to write to Stieglitz, the Prince’s banker, upon whom Beethoven\r\nhad been told to draw in case he needed money. Karl does not use\r\ngeneral terms as to the sum involved, but specifically says “the 125\r\nducats.” On August 2 Beethoven wrote to Stieglitz and Co., from whom he\r\nreceived a letter dated August 13 saying that the Prince was absent,\r\nbut his attention should be directed to the matter. Evidently the\r\nbankers kept their word, for on November 10-22, Prince Galitzin wrote\r\nto Beethoven saying that he had received the two Quartets but had been\r\nthe victim of great losses and other misfortunes; he was now obliged to\r\ngo to the wars in Persia, but before going would pay the “125 ducats”\r\nwhich he owed, thus admitting the debt in specific terms. On January\r\n10, 1827, Beethoven, already on his deathbed, dictated a letter of\r\ninquiry to Stieglitz and Co., and the bankers again answered promptly:\r\nthey were still waiting for an answer from the Prince. Five days\r\nbefore his death Beethoven made his last appeal to Stieglitz and Co.,\r\nreviewing the recent correspondence and Galitzin’s promise and asking\r\nthe bankers, if the money had been received, to forward it to Arnstein\r\nand Eskeles, as he was greatly in need of it because of his protracted\r\nsickness. Beethoven dictated the letter, but signed it himself and\r\nendorsed the draft: “To Prince Galitzin, concerning 125 ducats, March\r\n21, 1827.” He died on March 26.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DID GALITZIN PAY FOR THE QUARTETS?]\r\n\r\nThus stands the record at the time of Beethoven’s death. Prince\r\nGalitzin was back from the wars, but sent no money. On March 20, 1829,\r\nHotschevar as guardian of Karl van Beethoven appealed to the Imperial\r\nChancellary to ask the Embassy at St. Petersburg to collect the debt\r\nof 125 ducats from the Prince. Galitzin demanded an explanation, but\r\nafter repeated requests from Karl agreed to pay 50 ducats in two\r\ninstallments of 20 and 30 ducats each. The sums were paid, the latter,\r\nas Karl’s receipt shows, on November 9, 1832. Karl continued to make\r\nrepresentations to the Prince touching a balance of 75 ducats still\r\ndue and on June 2-14, 1835, Galitzin promised to pay the sum, not as\r\na balance due on his business transactions with Beethoven, but as a\r\nmemorial _pour honorer sa mémoire, que m’est chère_. Even now the\r\nmoney was not paid, but after a controversy had broken out between\r\nSchindler and the Prince over the former’s charge that Beethoven had\r\nnever been paid for the Quartets, Galitzin sent the 75 ducats, and Karl\r\ncomplaisantly acquiesced in the Prince’s request and signed a receipt\r\nfor the money, not as in payment of the debt, but as a voluntary\r\ntribute to the dead composer.[149]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DEDICATION OF THE NINTH SYMPHONY]\r\n\r\nSchott was ready with the Ninth Symphony in July, 1826, but Beethoven\r\nasked him to delay the despatch of the printed score to the King of\r\nPrussia, to whom it was dedicated, until he had had an opportunity\r\nto send the monarch a manuscript copy, which, he said, would have no\r\nvalue after the publication. The reward which he was looking forward to\r\nin return was a decoration. The Conversation Books have considerable\r\nto say about the dedication, but if the London Philharmonic Society\r\never entered Beethoven’s mind in connection with it, the record has\r\nbeen lost. He wanted an Order, and had he received one in time for\r\nthe concert, its insignia would, in great likelihood, have graced his\r\nbreast on that occasion. He had repeatedly expressed contempt for the\r\noutward signs of royal condescension, but the medal sent by the King\r\nof France had evidently caused a change of heart in this regard. He\r\nwas eager to see a description and illustration of the medallion in\r\nthe newspapers; and that he thought of hanging it about his neck,\r\nappears from a remark to him made by Karl before the concert, telling\r\nhim that it was too heavy to wear and would pull down his collar.\r\nVisitors called to see it and he permitted his intimate friends to\r\nshow it about, until Holz cautioned him to do so no more, as it was\r\nshowing marks of damage from a fall. In one conversation, Johann\r\nsuggests that the Symphony be dedicated to the Czar of Russia and from\r\na remark in one of Prince Galitzin’s letters telling him that, by a\r\nrecent decree, all foreigners who wished to dedicate works of art to\r\nthe Czar would have to obtain permission to do so from the Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs, it would appear that Johann’s suggestion, or approval,\r\nhad also received his sanction. Ferdinand Ries was also a candidate\r\nfor the distinction (Beethoven had promised him the dedication in a\r\nletter), his claim being put forward, without particular urgency, by\r\nFranz Christian Kirchhoffer, a bookkeeper with whom Beethoven was\r\nacquainted and through whom Ries carried on his correspondence with\r\nthe composer. On April 8, 1824, Karl wrote in a Conversation Book:\r\n“As soon as the Symphony has been sent to England it must be copied\r\nagain handsomely on vellum paper and sent with an inscription to the\r\nKing of France.” On the same day, apparently, Schindler asks: “Who has\r\nthe preference in the matter of the dedication of the Symphony--Ries\r\nor the King of Prussia?--It ought to be offered as a proof of your\r\ngratitude, in these words.--There could be no better opportunity than\r\njust now for this purpose.” It is obvious that Schindler favors the\r\nKing of France, for a day or two later he writes: “Schwaebl sends his\r\ncompliments and is highly delighted that you are pleased with the gift.\r\nAs regards the you-know-what he wants you to write to the Duke de la\r\nChârtre [d’Âchats] yourself, but for the present nothing about the\r\ndedication--leave the reference till later.” The advice is repeated and\r\nthe subject concluded with: “Good, then you will stick to France.”\r\n\r\nThese facts belong chronologically to the history of 1824, but they\r\nhave been made pertinent by the discussion of the dedication and\r\npresentation of the Ninth Symphony to the King of Prussia, which took\r\nplace in 1826. They are also valuable to correct a misapprehension\r\nwhich has prevailed ever since the publication of Hogarth’s history\r\nof the London Philharmonic Society and was no doubt current before\r\nthen. Hogarth says that the directors of the society resolved to offer\r\nBeethoven £50 for a manuscript symphony on November 10, 1822, and adds,\r\n“the money was immediately advanced.” In a note to his translation of\r\none of Beethoven’s letters (Kalischer-Shedlock, Vol. II, p. 448) Mr.\r\nShedlock calls attention to the fact that there is a document in the\r\nBritish Museum, acknowledging receipt of £50 for a symphony composed\r\nfor the society, dated April 27, 1824. This document proves the date on\r\nwhich Beethoven received the remuneration for the Symphony to have been\r\nthat indicated in the receipt beyond peradventure. On April 26 or 27\r\nKarl writes, in the Conversation Book from which we have been quoting:\r\n\r\n\r\n    He [presumably Johann van Beethoven] is not at home at noon. He\r\n    will himself come soon after 7. He says you owe him 500 florins\r\n    which is squared by the payment for the Symphony. Moreover Ries\r\n    begs you to dedicate the Symphony to him.--Shares--You must not\r\n    refuse bluntly, but give him an evasive answer, until you have\r\n    the shares. Is the Symphony ready to be taken away?--Then you can\r\n    go out and the brother will come here. The Symphony must not be\r\n    published for a year.[150] Did you dedicate the overture to him?\r\n    You might dedicate it to him.\r\n\r\n    _Johann_ (a short time afterward).--Kirchhoffer was here and said\r\n    that ducats have depreciated in value and we ought to inform\r\n    ourselves at once. He wants me to bring him the two documents and\r\n    the Symphony, when he will at once hand over the two shares. I\r\n    beg you therefore to sign this now so that I can be with him at\r\n    10 o’clock. I will bring the two shares at once.--The girl can\r\n    carry the Symphony with me now.--As regards the dedication of the\r\n    Symphony it was only a question put for Ries by Kirchhoffer and\r\n    must in no case be. He would have liked to see Ries [get it?]\r\n    because he is going to leave London soon.--I told him it could not\r\n    well be in the case of this work, whereupon he said no more. In no\r\n    event does he count on it longer.\r\n\r\nWhen finally, in 1826, Beethoven decided that the Symphony should be\r\ndedicated to the King of Prussia, he obtained permission of Prince\r\nHatzfeld, the Prussian Ambassador, to do so. Dr. Spicker, the King’s\r\nlibrarian, was in Vienna at the time and arrangements were made\r\nto transmit a copy of the score to Berlin through him. Holz had a\r\ntalk with him and he advised him concerning the preparation of the\r\npresentation copy and also discussed the possibility of a decoration.\r\nSpicker told Holz to have Beethoven copy the title of the printed work\r\non the title-page in his natural and habitual handwriting without any\r\nattempt at beautification. This would enhance the value of the score\r\nin the eyes of the King and he would put it in his private library. To\r\nget the order would be an easy matter, for the King was predisposed in\r\nBeethoven’s favor. Spicker also visited Beethoven, being presented by\r\nHaslinger, but, unfortunately, the pages of the book which must have\r\nrecorded the conversation have not been preserved; or, if preserved,\r\nnot been made known. Beethoven wrote the title-page, the score was\r\nhandsomely bound by Steiner and Co. and placed in the hands of Dr.\r\nSpicker with the following letter:\r\n\r\n    Your Majesty:\r\n\r\n    It is a piece of great good fortune in my life that Your Majesty\r\n    has graciously allowed me to dedicate the present work to you.\r\n\r\n    Your Majesty is not only the father of your subjects but also\r\n    protector of the arts and sciences; how much more, therefore, must\r\n    I rejoice in your gracious permission since I am also so fortunate\r\n    as to count myself a citizen of Bonn and therefore one of your\r\n    subjects.\r\n\r\n    I beg of Your Majesty graciously to accept this work as a slight\r\n    token of the high reverence which I give to all your virtues.\r\n\r\n  Your Majesty’s\r\n  Most obedient servant\r\n  Ludwig van Beethoven.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A ROYAL GIFT OF SMALL VALUE]\r\n\r\nThe King’s acknowledgment was as follows:\r\n\r\n    In view of the recognized worth of your compositions it was very\r\n    agreeable for me to receive the new work which you have sent me. I\r\n    thank you for sending it and hand you the accompanying diamond ring\r\n    as a token of my sincere appreciation.\r\n\r\n  Berlin, November 25, 1826\r\n  Friedrich Wilhelm.\r\n\r\n    To the composer Ludwig van Beethoven.\r\n\r\nSchindler says that when the case containing the King’s gift was\r\nopened it was found to contain, not a diamond ring as the letter had\r\ndescribed it, but one set with a stone of a “reddish” hue which the\r\ncourt jeweller to whom it was shown appraised at 300 florins, paper\r\nmoney. Beethoven was very indignant and was with difficulty dissuaded\r\nfrom sending it back to the Prussian Ambassador; eventually he sold\r\nit to the jeweler at the value which he had set upon it. Whether or\r\nnot the ring was the one really sent from Berlin or one which had been\r\nsubstituted for it (as was suspected in some quarters), has never been\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nDespite the cordial relations between Beethoven and Haslinger, which\r\nendured to the end of the composer’s life, there was continual friction\r\nbetween him and the Steiner firm, for which it would seem that Holz\r\nwas at this time responsible in a considerable degree; and it may have\r\nbeen he who put the notion into Beethoven’s head that it would be a\r\nstroke of business to buy back all of his manuscripts which Steiner had\r\nacquired but had not yet published. Dissatisfaction with the policy\r\nof publishers, however, was in Beethoven a confirmed mood; we have\r\nheard him rail against the men who wanted to withhold his works till\r\nhe was dead, so as to profit from the public curiosity which would\r\nfollow. Beethoven made the proposition in a jocular letter to Haslinger\r\noffering to pay the same “shameful” price for all his unpublished\r\nmanuscripts which the firm had paid him. The transaction was not\r\nconsummated; if it had been there can be no doubt but that it would\r\nhave been highly advantageous to him, since both Schott and Artaria\r\nwere now eager to have his works.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A DEFENSE OF MOZART’S “REQUIEM”]\r\n\r\nAmong Beethoven’s intimate friends was Abbé Stadler, an old man and\r\nan old-fashioned musician, the horizon of whose æsthetic appreciation\r\nwas marked by the death-date of his friend Mozart. Castelli says that\r\nhe used to call Beethoven’s music “pure nonsense”; certain it is that\r\nhe used to leave the concert-room whenever a composition by Beethoven\r\nwas to be played. Schuppanzigh offered as an excuse for him that he\r\nhad a long way home, and it does not appear that Beethoven ever took\r\numbrage at his conduct. Holz, telling Beethoven in February, 1825,\r\nthat as usual he had left the room when an overture by Beethoven was\r\nabout to be played, added: “He is too old. He always says when Mozart\r\nis reached, ‘More I cannot understand.’” But once he staid and not\r\nonly listened to a Beethoven piece but praised it. It was the Trio for\r\nStrings, Op. 9, which had been composed nearly a generation before!\r\nHolz becomes sarcastic: “One might say A. B. C. D. (_Abbé cédait_).”\r\nStadler now had occasion to court Beethoven’s favor, or at least to\r\nbetray the fact that even if he could not appreciate his music he\r\nyet had had a vast respect for his genius and reputation. In 1825,\r\nGottfried Weber had written an essay, which was published in the\r\n“Cäcilia” journal, attacking the authenticity of Mozart’s “Requiem.”\r\nThe article angered Beethoven, as is evidenced by his marginal glosses\r\non the copy of the journal which he read, now in the possession of Dr.\r\nPrieger in Bonn. The glosses are two in number: “Oh, you arch ass!” and\r\n“Double ass!” Such a disposition of an attack on the artistic honor of\r\nhis friend did not suffice Stadler. He published a defence of Mozart\r\n(“_Vertheidigung der Echtheit des Mozartschen Requiems_”) and sent a\r\ncopy to Beethoven, who acknowledged it thus:\r\n\r\n  On the 6th of Feby., 1826.\r\n\r\n  Respected and venerable Sir:\r\n\r\n    You have done a really good deed in securing justice for the\r\n    _manes_ of Mozart by your truly exemplary and exhaustive essay,\r\n    and lay and _profane_, all who are musical or can in anywise be\r\n    accounted so must give you thanks.\r\n\r\n    It requires either nothing or much for one like Herr W. to bring\r\n    such a subject on the carpet.\r\n\r\n    When it is also considered that to the best of my knowledge such\r\n    an one has written a treatise on composition and yet tries to\r\n    attribute such passages as\r\n\r\n    [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    to Mozart, and adds to it such passages as\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Agnus Dei peccata mundi]\r\n\r\n    and\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: qui tollis peccata qui tollis peccata]\r\n\r\n    we are reminded by Herr W’s amazing knowledge of harmony and melody\r\n    of the old and dead Imperial Composers Sterkel, ...... (illegible),\r\n    Kalkbrenner (the father), Andre (_nicht der gar Andere_) etc.\r\n\r\n    _Requiescat in pace._--I thank you in especial, my honored friend,\r\n    for the happiness which you have given me in sending me your essay.\r\n    I have always counted myself among the greatest admirers of Mozart\r\n    and will remain such till my last breath.\r\n\r\n    Reverend Sir, _your blessing soon_.[151]\r\n\r\nThe concluding supplication recalls an anecdote related by Castelli\r\nin his memoirs: Beethoven and Abbé Stadler once met at Steiner’s.\r\nAbout to depart, Beethoven kneeled before the Abbé and said: “Reverend\r\nSir, give me your blessing.” Stadler, not at all embarrassed, made the\r\nsign of the cross over the kneeling man and, as if mumbling a prayer,\r\nsaid: “Hilft’s nix, schadt’s nix” (“If it does no good, ’twill do no\r\nharm”). Beethoven thereupon kissed his hand amid the laughter of the\r\nbystanders. Jahn heard the same story from Fischoff.[152]\r\n\r\nA remark in a Conversation Book of 1826 indicates that Stadler had\r\nurged Beethoven to write a mass. Holz says: “If Stadler tells you to\r\nwrite a mass it is certain that something will be done for it. He\r\nknows best of anybody which way the wind blows.--He has Dietrichstein\r\nand Eybler in his pocket.--You are well cared for if Stadler favors\r\nit.” The conversations of Holz also provide a fleeting glimpse of\r\nSchubert in this year. Holz tells Beethoven that he had seen the young\r\ncomposer with either Artaria or Mosel (the allusion is vague) and that\r\nthe two were reading a Handel score together. “He (Schubert) was very\r\namiable and thanked me for the pleasure which Mylord’s [Schuppanzigh’s]\r\nQuartets gave him; he was always present.--He has a great gift for\r\nsongs.--Do you know the ‘Erlking’? He spoke very mystically, always.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEETHOVEN AND FRIEDRICH WIECK]\r\n\r\nFriedrich Wieck, father of Clara Schumann, spent three hours with\r\nBeethoven in May, having been presented by Andreas Stein, the\r\npianoforte maker. He told about the visit long afterward in a letter\r\nto his second wife which was reprinted in the “Signale” No. 57, in\r\nDecember, 1873, from the “Dresdener Nachrichten.” Beethoven gave his\r\nguest wine (to which Wieck was not accustomed), improvised for him\r\nover an hour and talked voluminously about\r\n\r\n    musical conditions in Leipsic--Rochlitz--Schicht--Gewandhaus--his\r\n    housekeeper--his many lodgings, none of which suited him--his\r\n    promenades--Hietzing--Schönbrunn--his brother--various stupid\r\n    people in Vienna--aristocracy--democracy--revolution--Napoleon--\r\n    Mara--Catalani--Malibran--Fodor--the excellent Italian singers\r\n    Lablache, Donzelli, Rubini and others, the perfection of Italian\r\n    opera (German opera could never be so perfect because of the\r\n    language and because the Germans did not learn to sing as\r\n    beautifully as the Italians)--my views on pianoforte playing--\r\n    Archduke Rudolph--Fuchs in Vienna, at the time a famous musical\r\n    personality--my improved method of pianoforte teaching, etc.\r\n\r\nWieck says the meeting was in Hietzing, and that Beethoven played upon\r\nthe pianoforte “presented to him by the city of London”--three obvious\r\nmistakes, since Beethoven was not in Hietzing in May, but in Vienna,\r\nand the Broadwood pianoforte, which was not presented to him by the\r\ncity of London but by Thomas Broadwood, was in the hands of Graf for\r\nrepairs in May.\r\n\r\nAfter Karl’s attempt to end his ill-spent life, with its crushing\r\neffect upon the composer, the friends, Holz in particular, made many\r\nefforts to divert Beethoven’s mind from his disappointment and grief.\r\nThey accompanied him on brief excursions into the country which he\r\nloved so passionately and which had been closed to him, for the\r\ncustomary happy season, by his nephew’s act. Again did his brother\r\noffer him a haven at Gneixendorf in August, only to receive the curt\r\nanswer: “I will not come. Your brother??????!!!! Ludwig.” His nephew\r\nwas lying in the hospital. He could not leave him then nor did he go\r\nuntil it had become necessary to find an asylum for Karl as well as\r\na resting-place for himself. His brother came to the city late in\r\nSeptember; it was necessary that Karl should remain out of Vienna\r\nuntil he could join a regiment of soldiery, and so Beethoven accepted\r\nJohann’s renewed invitation to make a sojourn at Gneixendorf. Meanwhile\r\nhe was far from idle. He had begun a new quartet, in F major, and\r\nSchlesinger, _père_, who had come from Berlin, negotiated with him\r\nfor its publication. He had the new finale for the B-flat Quartet\r\non his mind and, as will appear later, several other works occupied\r\nhim. With Schlesinger he talked about the Complete Edition and some\r\nmilitary marches which the King of Prussia was to pay for, as they were\r\nto be written for the Royal Band. The chief obstacle to Beethoven’s\r\nacceptance of his brother’s repeated invitations to visit him at\r\nGneixendorf came from the presence there of the brother’s wife. Her\r\nscandalous conduct had begotten an intense hatred in Beethoven’s mind.\r\nUrged on by his brother, Johann had once planned to put her away, but\r\nthere was an obstacle in the shape of a marriage contract, which gave\r\nher half of his property, and though she was willing to surrender\r\nthe contract at one time, she was not content to be turned out upon\r\nthe world with neither character nor means of subsistence. Besides,\r\nJohann was loath to take the drastic methods which alone were open to\r\nhim. He was inclined, much to the indignation of his brother, to be\r\ncomplaisant; he needed a housekeeper and for that she would serve.\r\n“I go my way and let her go hers,” he said, and he told his brother\r\nwhen trying to persuade him to spend his summers, perhaps eventually\r\nall his time, at Gneixendorf, that he need pay no heed whatever to\r\nhis sister-in-law. Much of the ill-feeling was due to the fact that\r\nBeethoven wanted to insure his brother’s fortune for Karl. The nephew\r\ndid eventually become his sole heir and inherited 42,000 florins from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEETHOVEN AT GNEIXENDORF]\r\n\r\nOn September 28, Beethoven and his nephew left Vienna for Gneixendorf,\r\nintending to stay a week. A night was passed at a village _en route_,\r\nand Johann’s estate was reached in the afternoon of the next day--the\r\n29th--but not too late for the composer to walk through the fields\r\nwith his brother to take a look at the property. The next day the\r\nwalk was extended to the vineyards on the hill in the forenoon and\r\nto Imbach in the afternoon. There Karl pointed out to his uncle some\r\nhistorical monuments: “This is the cloister where Margarethe, Ottocar’s\r\nwife, died; the scene occurs in Grillparzer’s piece.” Thus, with other\r\nexcursions the next day, life at Gneixendorf began. [153] Gneixendorf\r\nis a little village on a high plateau of the Danube Valley about an\r\nhour’s walk from Krems. It is a mean hamlet, with only one street and\r\nthat narrow, rough and dirty. The houses are low huts. Wasserhof,\r\nas the place is now called, the Beethoven estate, lies opposite the\r\nvillage and is reached by a wagon road which runs a large part of the\r\nway along the edge of a ravine, which torrents have cut out of the\r\nclayey soil. The plateau is almost treeless but covered with fields\r\nand vines. In Beethoven’s time there were two houses on the estate,\r\nboth large and handsome, each with its garden and surrounding wall. The\r\nhouses were separated from each other by a road. A generation after\r\nBeethoven had been a visitor there the gardens were found neglected\r\nand the trees which surrounded the house, a two-storey structure\r\nstrongly built of stone with a covering of mortar, shut out a view of\r\nthe surrounding country.[154] Beethoven’s rooms were on the east side,\r\nand unless the trees interfered the composer had a magnificent view of\r\nthe Danubian valley stretching to the distant Styrian mountains. Johann\r\nvan Beethoven’s possessions compassed nearly 400 acres, most of which\r\nhe leased to tenants. A lover of hills and forests like Beethoven must\r\nhave found Wasserhof dreary and monotonous in the extreme, yet the\r\ndistant view of the Danube seems to have compensated him in a measure,\r\nfor it reminded him of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nGerhard von Breuning gives a distressful account of Beethoven’s\r\nreception and treatment at Gneixendorf. It is, indeed, too distressful\r\nto be implicitly accepted as true, nor are all his accusations against\r\nJohann borne out by the evidence of the Conversation Books and\r\nother indubitable facts. If the account in Breuning’s book “Aus dem\r\nSchwarzspanierhause” were literally true, we should have to picture to\r\nourselves Beethoven, arrived at his brother’s place, being assigned\r\nrooms which were unfit for occupation in the cold, wet November weather\r\nwhich ensued, denied facilities for proper heating, having fire-wood\r\nstingily doled out to him, compelled to eat miserable food and forced\r\nto be content with too little even of that, and three days after his\r\narrival informed that he would be expected to pay for his board and\r\nlodging. One would think while reading the account that Johann van\r\nBeethoven, who had been offering hospitalities to his brother for\r\nyears, had done so only to make money out of him and had at last\r\nsucceeded in his design by taking advantage of the overwhelming\r\nsorrow which had come upon him.[155] Beethoven is said to have made\r\ncomplaints in the nature of von Breuning’s accusations in a letter\r\nwritten from Gneixendorf to Stephan von Breuning, and also to have\r\ngiven expression to his feelings at being obliged to submit to the\r\nrepulsive companionship of his brother’s wife and step-daughter. The\r\nletter is lost and was not printed by Breuning’s son in proof of the\r\ncharges; but if it had been it would not be conclusive in the minds\r\nof dispassionate judges. Against it there would lie the evidences of\r\nthe brother’s numerous acts of helpfulness, the many instances of\r\nBeethoven’s unreasonable suspicion and unjust judgment and, above\r\nall, the testimony of the Conversation Books. As to the matter of an\r\ninsufficient supply of fire-wood, there is a remark of Karl’s, made\r\nafter a return to Vienna is already in contemplation: “As regards\r\nexpenses, wood is so cheap that it is inconceivable that your brother\r\nshould be at any considerable cost, for you can heat a long time with\r\na cord and he is already overpaid.” Long before when Johann had been\r\ntrying in vain to induce him to come to Gneixendorf for the summer he\r\nrebukes him for his unwillingness to accept his hospitality gratis.\r\nOnce during the sojourn he says explicitly: “You do not need money\r\nhere”; and at another time: “If you want to live with us you can have\r\neverything for 40 florins Convention money a month, which makes only\r\n500 florins for a whole year,” and again: “You will need only half of\r\nyour pension” and “I will charge nothing for the first fortnight; I\r\nwould do more if I were not so hard-pressed with taxes.” Beethoven had\r\nplanned at the outset to stay only a week, just long enough for the\r\nscar on Karl’s head to disappear sufficiently to make him presentable\r\nto his commanding officer. Instead, the visit lasted two months and\r\nJohann was short of money. He had still two payments to make on the\r\npurchase-money for the estate, and collections were not good.\r\n\r\nBeethoven was sick when he went to Gneixendorf. He had not recovered\r\nfrom his illness of the early months of the year when Karl attempted to\r\nkill himself, and this was not calculated to improve the physical or\r\nmental condition of so nervous and irritable a being as he. On October\r\n7, eight days after his arrival in Gneixendorf, he wrote a letter from\r\na sickbed and Breuning, to whom it was sent, who knew his physical\r\ncondition well, remarked that he was in danger of becoming seriously\r\nill, possibly dropsical. Nothing was more natural than that his letters\r\nshould be full of complaints, some of which might well be measurably\r\nfounded on fact without convicting his brother of inhumanity. He had\r\nnever been a comfortable or considerate guest or tenant at the best,\r\nand his adaptability to circumstances was certainly not promoted by\r\nthe repugnance which he felt towards his sister-in-law and his want of\r\nhonest affection for his brother.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ANECDOTES OF A RURAL SOJOURN]\r\n\r\nConcerning his life in Gneixendorf, a number of interesting details\r\nwere told in an article entitled “Beethoven in Gneixendorf,” published\r\nin the “Deutsche Musikzeitung” in 1862,[156] some of which are worth\r\nreciting again. One day Johann went to Langenfeld and Beethoven and\r\nother people from Gneixendorf went with him. The purpose was to visit a\r\nsurgeon named Karrer, a friend of the brother. The surgeon was absent\r\non a sick-call, but his wife, flattered by a visit from the landowner,\r\nentertained him lavishly. Noticing a man who held himself aloof from\r\nthe company, sitting silently on the bench behind the stove, and\r\ntaking him for one of her guest’s servants, she filled a little jug\r\nwith native wine and handed it to him with the remark: “He shall also\r\nhave a drink.” When the surgeon returned home late at night and heard\r\nan account of the incident he exclaimed: “My dear wife, what have you\r\ndone? The greatest composer of the century was in our house to-day and\r\nyou treated him with such disrespect!”\r\n\r\nJohann had occasion to visit the syndic Sterz in Langenlois on a\r\nmatter of business. Beethoven accompanied him. The conference lasted a\r\nconsiderable time, during all of which Beethoven stood motionless at\r\nthe door of the official’s office. At the leavetaking Sterz bowed often\r\nand low to the stranger, and after he was gone asked his clerk, named\r\nFux, an enthusiastic lover of music, especially of Beethoven’s; “Who do\r\nyou think the man was who stood by the door?” Fux replied: “Considering\r\nthat you, Mr. Syndic, treated him with such politeness, his may be\r\nan exceptional case; otherwise I should take him for an imbecile\r\n(_Trottel_).” The consternation of the clerk may be imagined when told\r\nthe name of the man whom he had taken for an idiot.\r\n\r\nJohann’s wife had assigned Michael Krenn, son of one of her husband’s\r\nvinedressers, to look after Beethoven’s wants. At first the cook had to\r\nmake up Beethoven’s bed. One day, while the woman was thus occupied,\r\nBeethoven sat at a table gesticulating with his hands, beating time\r\nwith his feet, muttering and singing. The woman burst into a laugh,\r\nwhich Beethoven observed. He drove her out of the room instanter.\r\nKrenn tried to follow her, but Beethoven drew him back, gave him three\r\n20-kreutzer pieces, told him not to be afraid, and said that hereafter\r\nhe should make the bed and clean the floor every day. Krenn said that\r\nhe was told to come to the room early, but generally had to knock a\r\nlong time before Beethoven opened the door. It was Beethoven’s custom\r\nto get up at half-past 5 o’clock, seat himself at a table and write\r\nwhile he beat time with hands and feet and sang. This frequently\r\nstirred Krenn’s risibles, and when he could no longer restrain his\r\nlaughter he used to leave the room. Gradually he grew accustomed to\r\nit. The family breakfast was eaten at half-past 7 o’clock, after which\r\nBeethoven hurried out into the open air, rambled across the fields\r\nshouting and waving his arms, sometimes walking very rapidly, sometimes\r\nvery slowly and stopping at times to write in a sort of pocketbook.\r\nThis book he once lost and said: “Michael, run about and hunt my\r\nwritings; I must have them again at any cost.” Michael luckily found\r\nthem. At half-past 12 Beethoven would come home for dinner, after which\r\nhe went to his room until about 3 o’clock; then he roamed over the\r\nfields until shortly before sunset, after which he never went out of\r\ndoors. Supper was at half-past 7, and after eating he went to his room,\r\nwrote till 10 o’clock and then went to bed. Occasionally Beethoven\r\nplayed the pianoforte, which did not stand in his room but in the\r\nsalon. Nobody was permitted to enter his rooms except Michael, who had\r\nto put them in order while Beethoven was out walking. In doing so he\r\nseveral times found money on the floor, and when he carried it to its\r\nowner, Beethoven made him show him where he had picked it up and then\r\ngave it to him. This happened three or four times, after which no more\r\nmoney was found. In the evening Michael had to sit with Beethoven and\r\nwrite down answers to questions which he asked. Generally Beethoven\r\nwanted to know what had been said about him at dinner and supper.\r\n\r\nOne day the wife of the landowner sent Michael to Stein with 5 florins\r\nto buy wine and a fish; but Michael was careless and lost the money.\r\nHe came back to Gneixendorf in consternation. As soon as Madame van\r\nBeethoven saw him she asked for the fish, and when he told her of the\r\nloss she discharged him from her service. When Beethoven came into\r\ndinner he asked at once for his servant and the lady told him what had\r\nhappened. Beethoven grew fearfully excited, gave her 5 florins, and\r\nangrily demanded that Michael be called back at once. After that he\r\nnever went to table any more but had his dinner and supper brought to\r\nhis rooms, where Michael had to prepare breakfast for him. Even before\r\nthis occurrence Beethoven scarcely ever spoke to his sister-in-law\r\nand seldom to his brother. Beethoven wanted to take Michael with him\r\nto Vienna, but when a cook came to call for the composer the plan was\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEETHOVEN SCARES A YOKE OF OXEN]\r\n\r\nTwo old peasants told the owner of Wasserhof in 1862 stories which\r\nconfirm Krenn’s account of Beethoven’s unusual behavior in the fields.\r\nBecause of his unaccountable actions they at first took him for a\r\nmadman and kept out of his way. When they had become accustomed to his\r\nsingularities and learned that he was a brother of the landlord they\r\nused to greet him politely; but he, always lost in thought, seldom if\r\never returned their greetings. One of these peasants, a young man at\r\nthe time, had an adventure with Beethoven of a most comical nature. He\r\nwas driving a pair of young oxen, scarcely broken to the yoke, from the\r\ntile-kiln toward the manor-house when he met Beethoven shouting and\r\nwaving his arms about in wild gesticulations. The peasant called to\r\nhim: _A bissel stada!_ (“A little quieter”) but he paid no attention\r\nto the request. The oxen took fright, ran down a steep hill and the\r\npeasant had great difficulty in bringing them to a stand, turning them\r\nand getting them back on the road. Again Beethoven came towards them,\r\nstill shouting and gesticulating. The yokel called to him a second\r\ntime, but in vain; and now the oxen rushed towards the house, where\r\nthey were stopped by one of the men employed there. When the driver\r\ncame up and asked who the fool was who had scared his oxen the man told\r\nhim it was the proprietor’s brother. “A pretty brother, that he is!”\r\nwas the answering comment.\r\n\r\nOn October 7 Beethoven answered the letter which he had received many\r\nmonths before from Wegeler. He wrote a long letter in the cordial and\r\nintimate tone which is to be found only in the correspondence with\r\npersons to whom he was bound by ties of affectionate friendship, but\r\nmade no reference to Karl. On the subject of his paternity he wrote:\r\n\r\n    You write that I am written down somewhere as a natural son of the\r\n    deceased king of Prussia; this was mentioned to me long ago. I have\r\n    made it a principle never to write anything about myself nor to\r\n    reply to anything written about me. For this reason I gladly leave\r\n    it to you to make known to the world the honesty of my parents, and\r\n    my mother in particular.\r\n\r\nHe tells with pride of the gift from the King of France, of other\r\ndistinctions which he had received, and of King Frederick William’s\r\ndesire to have the autograph of his new Symphony for the Royal Library,\r\nand adds: “Something has been said to me in this connection about the\r\norder of the Red Eagle, second class.[157] What the outcome will be I\r\ndo not know; I have never sought for such marks of honor, but at my\r\npresent age they would not be unwelcome, for several reasons.”\r\n\r\nOn October 13 he wrote a merry letter to Haslinger, whom he addresses\r\nin music as “First of all Tobiasses,” asking him to deliver a quartet\r\n(the one in F major published as Op. 135) to Schlesinger’s agent and\r\ncollect and forward the money, of which he stands in need. On the same\r\nday he wrote to Schott and Sons enclosing the metronome marks for the\r\nNinth Symphony which the Conversation Book shows had been dictated to\r\nKarl before the departure from Vienna. That he was not as grievously\r\ndisappointed by his surroundings at Gneixendorf as might have been\r\nexpected is evidenced by the remark: “The scenes among which I am\r\nsojourning remind me somewhat of the Rhine country which I so greatly\r\nlong to see again, having left them in my youth.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WORKS WRITTEN AT GNEIXENDORF]\r\n\r\nThe Quartet in F was completed at Gneixendorf. Beethoven sent it to\r\nSchlesinger’s agent on October 30, and had probably put the finishing\r\ntouches on it about the time when he wrote to Haslinger about its\r\ndelivery a fortnight before. Schlesinger had agreed to pay 80 ducats\r\nfor it. It had been in hand four months at least, for in July he told\r\nHolz that he intended to write another quartet and when Holz asked, “In\r\nwhat key?” and was told, he remarked, “But that will be the third in\r\nF. There is none in D minor. It is singular that there is none among\r\nHaydn’s in A minor.” If there were positive evidence in the “Muss es\r\nsein?” incident, a still earlier date would have to be set for its\r\norigin, but here we are left to conjecture. There was considerable\r\nmerry-making over the Dembscher joke, and it is at least probable that\r\nthe first sketches for the Quartet and the Canon were written about the\r\nsame time. The point which cannot be definitely determined is whether\r\nor not the motif of the Canon was destined from the first for the\r\nfinale of the Quartet. It may have been in Beethoven’s mind for that\r\npurpose and the sudden inspiration on hearing the story of Dembscher’s\r\nquery “Muss es sein?” may have gone only to the words and the use of\r\nthem with the music for the Canon. That the Quartet was to be shorter\r\nthan the others was known before Beethoven left Vienna. Holz once says\r\nto Beethoven before the departure that Schlesinger had asked about it\r\nand that he had replied that Beethoven was at work upon it, and added:\r\n“You will not publish it if it is short. Even if it should have only\r\nthree movements it would still be a quartet by Beethoven, and it would\r\nnot cost so much to print it.”[158]\r\n\r\nThe new finale for the Quartet in B-flat was also completed in\r\nGneixendorf, though it, too, had been worked out almost to a conclusion\r\nin Vienna. It was delivered on November 25 to Artaria, who gave him 15\r\nducats for it. Schuppanzigh gave it a private performance in December\r\nand told Beethoven that the company thought it _köstlich_ and that\r\nArtaria was overjoyed when he heard it. There were other compositions\r\non which Beethoven worked in Gneixendorf when he compelled laughter\r\nfrom the cook and frightened the peasant’s oxen. At Diabelli’s request\r\nhe had said that he would write a quintet with flute. Sketches for a\r\nquintet have been found, showing that the work was in a considerable\r\nstate of forwardness, but in them there are no signs of a flute. Holz\r\ntold Jahn that the first movement of a quintet in C for strings which\r\nDiabelli had bought for 100 ducats was finished in the composer’s\r\nhead and the first page written out. In the catalogue of Beethoven’s\r\nposthumous effects No. 173 was “Fragment of a new Violin Quintet,\r\nof November, 1826, last work of the composer,” which was officially\r\nvalued at 10 florins. It was bought by Diabelli at the auction sale\r\nand published in pianoforte arrangements, two and four hands, with the\r\ntitle: “Ludwig van Beethoven’s last Musical Thought, after the original\r\nmanuscript of November, 1826,” and the remark: “Sketch of the Quintet\r\nwhich the publishers, A. Diabelli and Co., commissioned Beethoven to\r\nwrite and purchased from his relics with proprietary rights.” The\r\npublished work is a short movement in C in two divisions, having a\r\nbroad theme of a festal character, _Andante maestoso_ and Polonaise\r\nrhythm. The autograph having disappeared it can not now be said how\r\nmuch of the piece was actually written out by Beethoven. Nottebohm\r\nshows (“Zweit. Beeth.,” p. 79 _et seq._) that the sketches for the\r\nquintet were written after Beethoven had begun to make a fair copy of\r\nthe last movement of the B-flat Quartet. Lenz, in volume V of his work\r\non Beethoven (p. 219), tells a story derived from Holz to the effect\r\nthat when Beethoven sent him the last movement of the B-flat Quartet\r\nwith injunctions to collect 12 ducats from Artaria, he accompanied\r\nit with a Canon on the words “Here is the work; get me the money”\r\n(_Hier ist das Werk, schafft mir das Geld_). According to a report\r\ncirculated in Vienna in 1889, a copy of this Canon was purchased from\r\nHolz’s son for the Beethoven Collection in Heiligenstadt. The lines and\r\nnotes were described as having been written by Beethoven, the words:\r\n_Hier ist das Werk, sorgt für das Geld--1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,\r\n10, 11, 12 Dukaten_, by Holz to Beethoven’s dictation. The story is\r\nnot altogether convincing. The movement was completed in Gneixendorf\r\nand Artaria received and paid for it in November. He paid 15, not 12,\r\nducats; and it is not patent how Beethoven in Gneixendorf could dictate\r\nto Holz in Vienna. He did not return to Vienna till December 2. There\r\nare references to other works in the Conversation Books which are not\r\nclear. In January Mathias Artaria writes: “I hear of six fugues.--We\r\nwill empty a bottle of champagne in their honor.” Holz asks: “Is it\r\ntrue that you sold a rondo to Dominik Artaria which he has not yet\r\nreceived? It is said that you took it back and have not returned\r\nit.”--It is possible that the Rondo Caprice which was published by\r\nDiabelli as Op. 129, the history of which is a blank, is the work\r\nalluded to; but there is no evidence on the subject.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[147] Halm’s personal explanation to Mr. Thayer.\r\n\r\n[148] The Editor has taken the liberty of transferring the music to\r\nthe treble clef and to interpret the notes which are indistinct in the\r\nautograph in accordance with Dr. Deiters’s transcript.\r\n\r\n[149] It would scarcely be worth while to review the acrimonious\r\ncontroversy on this subject. There were errors and misunderstandings\r\ngrowing out of faulty memories and imperfect records. Mr. Thayer made\r\na painstaking study of the subject and secured all the available\r\ncorrespondence from Prince George Galitzin and from other sources\r\nin 1861. His résumé as given in Grove’s “Dictionary of Music and\r\nMusicians” (Art. “Galitzin”) doubtless sets forth the fact of\r\nindebtedness and payment correctly. He says: “These (the last two\r\nQuartets) were received by the Prince together and were acknowledged\r\nby him Nov. 22, 1826. He also received a MS. copy of the Mass in D and\r\nprinted copies of the Ninth Symphony and of the two overtures in C, the\r\none (Op. 124) dedicated to him, the other (Op. 115) dedicated to Count\r\nRadzivill. Thus the whole claim against him was--Quartets 150 ducats;\r\nOverture (Op. 115), 25 ducats; Mass, 50 ducats; loss on exchange, 4\r\nducats; total 229 ducats, not including various other pieces of music\r\nsent. On the other hand he appears, notwithstanding all his promises,\r\nto have paid, up to the time of Beethoven’s death, only 104 ducats.\r\nIt should be said that in 1826, war and insurrection had broken out\r\nin Russia, which occupied the Prince and obliged him to live away\r\nfrom Petersburg, and also put him to embarrassing expenses. After the\r\npeace of Adrianople, (Sept. 14, 1829) when Beethoven had been dead\r\nsome years a correspondence was opened with him by Hotschevar, Karl\r\nvan Beethoven’s guardian, which resulted in 1832 in a further payment\r\nof 50 ducats, making a total of 154. Karl still urges his claim for\r\n75 more to make up the 150 ducats for the Quartets, which Galitzin in\r\n1835 promises to pay but never does. In 1852, roused by Schindler’s\r\nstatement of the affair (ed. I. pp. 162, 163), he writes to the\r\n_Gazette musicale_ of July 21, 1852, a letter stating correctly the\r\nsum paid but incorrectly laying it all to the account of the Quartets.\r\nOther letters passed between him and Karl Beethoven, but they are not\r\nessential to the elucidation of the transaction.”\r\n\r\nTo this the present editor adds a bit of history derived chiefly from\r\nMr. Thayer’s papers. In the course of time Schindler’s partly erroneous\r\nstatement that the debt which Galitzin owed Beethoven at the time\r\nof his death was all on account of the quartets was magnified into\r\nthe statement made by Heinrich Döring and Brendel that the Prince\r\nhad “cheated” the composer out of the fee for the Quartets. Prince\r\nNicolas Galitzin had withdrawn to his distant estates in Russia, but\r\nat his instigation the cudgels were taken up in his behalf by his son\r\nPrince George, who, stirred into indignation by Döring’s biography\r\nin particular, sent that writer the following letter: “I can not and\r\ndo not want to know anything of the past, all the less since it will\r\ncertainly not be expected of me to contradict the proofs produced by\r\nhim (his father). But as by the publication of your article you have\r\nmade the question for me one of the day, I, as a man of honor must do\r\nmy duty to put an end to these misunderstandings. I have deposited\r\nthe sum of 125 ducats which you bring in question with Mr. Kaskel,\r\nbanker in Dresden, for the heirs of Beethoven, and from you, my dear\r\nSir, I expect the necessary information in this matter, since you must\r\nhave acquainted yourself with the necessary facts while writing your\r\nnotice. You must admit that hereafter I reserve the right to treat\r\nthis question as a personal one! In case the family of Beethoven has\r\ndied out there will be no other disposition of the money deposited\r\nwith Banker Kaskel than to pay it over to a charity or some other\r\ncause which may be directly associated with the name and works of the\r\nfamous artist. Dresden, July 15-3, 1858.” Karl van Beethoven, sole\r\nheir of the composer, had died three months previously, leaving a\r\nwidow and children, who were his heirs. Prince George’s money seemed\r\nlike a gift of Providence to the widow, who hastened, as soon as she\r\nread the letter in a musical journal, to write to Holz as the friend\r\nof the dead composer to collect the money for her and express her\r\ngratitude to Prince George. Holz complied with part of her request\r\nin a letter full of obsequiousness in which he accused Schindler of\r\nscandalmongering and offered to provide the Prince with evidence of\r\nthat gentleman’s rascality. But he did not collect the money, which\r\nlay still untouched in the vaults of Kaskel in 1861, when Madame van\r\nBeethoven, having made a vain application to Prince George, addressed\r\na letter to Kaskel asking whether the money was still deposited with\r\nhim or had been withdrawn by Prince George. In the latter event she\r\nstated that she wanted to contradict a statement circulating by the\r\npublic press that the heirs of Beethoven had received the gift. Kaskel\r\nreferred her to Ad. Reichel, a musical director in Dresden and a friend\r\nof the Prince, through whom, indeed, the deposit had been made. On\r\nApril 28, 1861, she wrote to Reichel, reviewing the facts in the case\r\nand stating her desire to apply the money, in case it was given to\r\nher, to the musical education of her youngest daughter, Hermine van\r\nBeethoven, then 8 years of age. Kaskel also wrote to Reichel, sending\r\nhim Madame van Beethoven’s letter and saying that as he had not heard\r\nanything from Prince Galitzin for several years he intended to turn the\r\nmoney over to the Municipal Court of Dresden in order to spare himself\r\nall further correspondence in the matter. Kaskel wrote to the Prince on\r\nMay 7, 1861, asking him to prescribe a disposition of the money, for,\r\nif Kaskel carried out his determination to send it to the court, it\r\nwould be frittered away. He urged that the money be given to Madame van\r\nBeethoven. This revival of interest in the subject was evidently due\r\nto Mr. Thayer’s activity in behalf of the widow and her daughter. Mr.\r\nThayer was in London in 1860 and evidently took up the matter with the\r\nPrince. He makes no mention of the subject in his notice written for\r\nGrove’s “Dictionary”; but among his letters the present writer found\r\nthe following letter, evidently written on the eve of his departure\r\nfrom England in February, 1861:\r\n\r\n“Dear Mr. Thayer. Prince Galitzin has asked me to remit to you the\r\nenclosed letters, praying you kindly to act for him in the affair, as\r\nyou will soon be on the spot. He begs you, however, to bear in mind the\r\nnecessity off proving that the money for these Quartets has not been\r\npaid (I fear an impossibility!); but however vexatious this may be to\r\npoor Mad. v. B. everyone must defer to the obstacle to her having the\r\nmoney: in the awkward light in which it places the Prince’s father.\r\nFrom what I can gather from his conversation he will be most satisfied\r\nto have the money appropriated for the purpose you suggested: the M. S.\r\nS. At all events Prince G. is quite content to leave the matter in your\r\nhands. Wishing you a pleasant journey and speedy return, believe me,\r\ndear Mr. Thayer, Yours sincerly Natalia Macfarren.”\r\n\r\nThe editor’s efforts to learn the ultimate disposition of the money\r\ndeposited with Kaskel have been in vain. Mr. Thayer’s papers contain\r\nno hint of the steps which may have been taken after Mrs. Macfarren’s\r\nappeal to Prince George; the banking house of Kaskel is gone out\r\nof existence; Nephew Karl’s daughter, Hermine, is dead. For three\r\nyears, from 1866 to 1869, she was a student in the pianoforte and\r\nharmonium classes of the Conservatory at Vienna, and it seems likely\r\nthat Mr. Thayer succeeded in having the Dresden deposit applied to her\r\neducation; but if so he left no memorandum of that fact amongst the\r\npapers which have come under the editor’s eyes.\r\n\r\n[150] Under the agreement it was to be the exclusive property of the\r\nPhilharmonic Society for a year and a half.\r\n\r\n[151] This interesting letter is now owned by Dwight Newman of Chicago.\r\n\r\n[152] Though there is no authority for doing so it seems impossible not\r\nto associate the following three-part canon, which may be found in the\r\nB. and H. Complete Edition, with this amusing anecdote:\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Signor Abbate!   io sono, io sono, io sono ammalato!\r\n    (Signor Abbate! I’m ailing, I’m ailing, I’m ailing, I am ailing!\r\n\r\n    Santo Padre vieni e datemi la benedizione, la benedizione.\r\n    Holy Father! hasten, hasten to me, hasten to me, hasten, and give\r\n        me thy blessing!\r\n\r\n    Hol’ Sie der Teufel, wenn Sie nicht kommen, hol’ Sie der Teufel,\r\n        wenn Sie nicht kommen, hol’ Sie der Teufel!\r\n    Go to the devil, unless you hasten, go to the devil, unless you\r\n        hasten, go to the devil!)\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n[153] “The name is something like the breaking of an axletree,” wrote\r\nBeethoven to Haslinger in October.\r\n\r\n[154] The description is based on that made by Thayer when he visited\r\nGneixendorf in 1860.\r\n\r\n[155] The romancing biographers who copy Schindler and Gerhard von\r\nBreuning in their accusations that Johann van Beethoven was prompted\r\nonly by the meanest motives of self-interest in all his dealings\r\nwith his great brother will have a difficult task to explain away\r\nthe evidence to the contrary afforded by the Conversation Books. The\r\nproposition that the two make a common home in Vienna had come from\r\nLudwig and been urged by him. After Johann had acquired the estate\r\nat Gneixendorf he made repeated efforts to persuade his brother to\r\nspend his summer vacation there. In 1823 Beethoven wrote: “He always\r\nwants me to come to his people--_non possibile per me_.” The obstacle\r\nwas Johann’s wife, who had become one of “his people” because of the\r\ncomposer’s interference with Johann’s private affairs at Linz. Urged on\r\nby Ludwig, Johann had taken action against the woman and made himself\r\nmaster of his household. In a Conversation Book of 1824 may be read\r\nin Johann’s hand: “My wife has surrendered her marriage contract and\r\nentered into an obligation permitting me to drive her away without\r\nnotice at the first new acquaintance which she makes.” Beethoven seems\r\nto have asked, “Why do you not do it!” for Johann continues: “I cannot\r\ndo that. I cannot know but that some misfortune might befall me.” Then\r\nKarl takes the pencil: “Your brother proposes that you spend the four\r\nmonths at his place. You would have 4 or 5 rooms, very beautiful,\r\nhigh and large. Everything is well arranged; you will find fowls,\r\noxen, cows, hares, etc. Moreover, as regards the wife, she is looked\r\nupon as a housekeeper only and will not disturb you. The scenery is\r\nglorious and it will not cost you a penny. There is a housekeeper;\r\nwater containing iron, an individual bathroom, etc. If you do not take\r\nit he will give up five rooms and announce the fact in the newspapers.”\r\nBeethoven, obviously, brings forward his objection to Johann’s wife,\r\nfor Karl writes: “That matter has come to an end. You will scarcely see\r\nthe woman. She looks after the housekeeping and works. All the more\r\nsince she is completely tamed. Besides, she has promised to conduct\r\nherself properly.” Other matters are discussed and then Johann writes:\r\n“It looks to me as if you did not want to come because it will not\r\ncost you anything. Who will look after our household affairs? Who will\r\nendure our humors?” In another book Karl writes that Johann had often\r\nsaid that his brother could have everything for nothing at Gneixendorf.\r\n\r\n[156] Page 77 _et seq._ The article was based largely on information\r\ngathered by Mr. Thayer at Gneixendorf in 1860 and had been submitted to\r\nhim for revision.\r\n\r\n[157] Third class is what is talked about in the Conversation Books.\r\n\r\n[158] Holz told Jahn that Schlesinger had bought it for 80 ducats and\r\nsent 360 florins in payment; whereupon Beethoven had said “If a Jew\r\nsends circumcised ducats he shall have a circumcised Quartet. That’s\r\nthe reason it is so short.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\n\r\n    Karl van Beethoven--A Wayward Ward and an Unwise\r\n    Guardian--Beethoven and His Nephew--An Ill-advised Foster-father\r\n    and a Graceless, Profligate Nephew--Effect on Beethoven’s\r\n    Character of the Guardianship--An Unsuccessful Attempt at\r\n    Self-destruction--Karl is Made a Soldier.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now to learn of the calamitous consequences of Beethoven’s\r\neffort to be a foster-father to the son of his dead brother Kaspar. The\r\ntale is one that has been fruitful of fiction in most of the writings\r\nwhich have dealt with the life-history of the great composer; nor is\r\nthe circumstance to be wondered at. There is still some obscurity\r\nin the story, and if there is anything in the melancholy lot of the\r\ngreat man, next to his supreme affliction, calculated to challenge\r\nthe pity of the world, it is the manner in which his efforts to\r\nattach to himself the one human being for whom he felt affection were\r\nrequited. There is no more pitiful picture in the history of great men\r\nthan that presented by his devotion to the lad in whom, for a reason\r\nwhich must have seemed to him more inscrutable than his own physical\r\ncalamity, he could not inspire a spark of love or a scintilla of\r\ngratitude. It was an unwise devotion and an ill-directed effort, but\r\nthat does not alter the case. From the beginning, all of his friends\r\nrecognized Beethoven’s unfitness for the office of guardian of his\r\nnephew. He was incapacitated for it by his occupation, his irregular\r\nmode of life, his lack of understanding of a child’s nature, his\r\nirresolute mind, his infirmities of temper, and the wretchedness of\r\nhis domestic surroundings due to his ignorance of and indifference to\r\nthe things essential to the amenities and comforts of social life.\r\nHe did not assume the guardianship in a spirit of gentle obedience\r\nto a dying brother’s request; he violently wrested it unto himself\r\nalone in defiance of that brother’s last entreaties. There can be no\r\ndoubt but that he believed that in doing so he was performing a pious\r\nduty toward his own flesh and blood and acting for the good of the\r\nchild and the welfare of the community. He was proud of the boy’s\r\nintellectual gifts, which were out of the ordinary; he dreamed of\r\nseeing him great and respected in the eyes of the world; he wanted\r\nloving companionship now, and in his old age; he hungered for sympathy\r\nand for help which would not keep him in bonds of obligation to\r\nmen whose disinterestedness he could not understand because of his\r\nsuspicious disposition; he desired to see by his side and in his kin\r\nan incarnation of that polite learning and that practical knowledge\r\nof worldly affairs which had been denied to him. All his aims were\r\nlaudable, all his desires natural and praiseworthy; but he was the last\r\nman in the world to know how to attain them. There can be no doubt\r\nthat his stubborn insistence upon making himself the sole director\r\nof the welfare of his ward cost him the sympathy, perhaps also the\r\nrespect and regard, of many of those whose counsel he was perforce\r\ncompelled to seek. For a long time until the final and woeful trial\r\ncame it separated him from the oldest and truest friend that he had\r\nin Vienna--Stephan von Breuning. It tested the patience and tried the\r\nforbearance of those who helped him in his mistaken zeal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEETHOVEN’S MORAL NATURE MARRED]\r\n\r\nMoreover, it may be said without harshness or injustice to his memory\r\nthat its consequences to his own moral nature were most deplorable. In\r\na mind and heart prone to equity and tenderness it developed a strange\r\ncapacity for cruel injustice. Aided by his native irresolution it\r\ntwisted his judgment and turned his conduct into paradox. To satisfy\r\nhis own love for the boy he strove fiercely to stifle a child’s natural\r\naffection for its mother. He thought that love for himself would grow\r\nout of hatred of the woman, though the passion which he tried to\r\nevoke was abhorrent to every instinct of nature. It matters not that\r\nthe mother of Karl was profligate and lewd. Once a glimmer of that\r\nfact dawned upon him. It was while he was struggling to prevent all\r\nintercourse between the widow and her child in the early years that\r\nhe was compelled to admit that to a child under all circumstances a\r\nmother is a mother still; but he made the confession to extenuate the\r\nconduct of the boy, not to justify the solicitude of the woman. His\r\nmemory of his own mother, the sweet, patient sufferer of Bonn, was\r\nto him like a benison his whole life long. “Who was happier than I\r\nwhen I could still speak the sweet word ‘mother’ and have it heard,”\r\nhe wrote to Dr. Schade, who had helped him on his sorrowful journey\r\nfrom Vienna to Bonn in 1787. But from the time that his brother Kaspar\r\ndied until he himself gave up the ghost he was unswervingly occupied\r\nin preventing communication between Kaspar’s widow and her son. After\r\nmore than twelve years he found that what he had tried to eradicate\r\nin the child, still lived in the youth. He had fought against nature\r\nand failed; and the failure filled him with bitterness, added to his\r\nhatred of the woman and his disappointment with the son. Such intensity\r\nof malevolence, though it may have had its origin in the profoundest\r\nconviction of virtuous purpose, could not fail to be prejudicial to\r\nhis own moral character. So, also, his solicitude for his ward’s\r\nmaterial welfare, which extended to a time when he should no longer\r\nbe able to make provision for him, seems to have warped his nature.\r\nIt weakened his pride; distorted his moral view; subjected him, not\r\nalways unjustly, to accusation of dishonesty in his dealings with his\r\npatrons and publishers; made him parsimonious, and at the last brought\r\nupon him the reproach of having begged alms of his English friends,\r\nthough possessed of property which might easily and quickly have been\r\nconverted into money to supply his last needs more than generously.\r\n\r\nTo protect him against indictment for these moral flaws, many of\r\nBeethoven’s biographers thought, and still think, it necessary or\r\njustifiable to veil the truth and magnify the transgressions of his\r\nkindred and friends. His earliest apologists may have had other\r\nreasons besides these for so doing; his present biographers have\r\nnone. By his own decree the world is entitled to know the truth.\r\nSchindler was embittered against Holz; Holz against Schindler; both\r\nagainst Johann van Beethoven, the brother; Beethoven himself taught\r\nhis nephew to despise his uncle Johann as well as Schindler; and all\r\nthree--Schindler, Holz and Johann--commissioned to that end, reported\r\ntheir observations of the lad’s shortcomings to his guardian. He\r\naccepted everything they said against the boy as he did everything\r\nthey said against each other; indeed, his suspicious nature made him\r\nprone to believe evil of everyone near to him; and we do not know of a\r\ncertainty that their reports were always within the bounds of strict\r\nveracity. After the tragedy they were unanimous in condemnation of\r\nthe misguided, wayward, wicked youth and in praise of Beethoven’s\r\nmagnanimity and self-sacrifice; but the evidence of helpful advice,\r\nwarning and admonition to the mariner who was sailing a craft on a sea\r\nfull of dangers to which nature had made him blind is not plentiful.\r\nHolz was young. He had scarcely finished sowing his own wild oats, and\r\nhe seems to have been more lenient in his judgment than his elders,\r\nthough just as convinced of the dangers into which the young man was\r\nrunning during the fateful last two years; but the few practical\r\nsuggestions which we find him making do not seem to have been accepted.\r\nHe was himself, like everybody else, under suspicion in Beethoven’s\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nConcerning the details of the always disgraceful and at the end\r\ntragical conduct of Beethoven’s nephew much obscurity is left after the\r\nmost painstaking study of the evidence to be found in the contemporary\r\ndocuments which have been preserved; but it is to these documents\r\nthat appeal must be made if the truth is to be learned, not to the\r\ngeneralizations of romancing biographers. Twenty-nine letters written\r\nby Beethoven to the youth came into the hands of Beethoven after the\r\nattempt at suicide and through Schindler into the Royal Library at\r\nBerlin. However they may be viewed, they are a pathetic monument. They\r\nare a deeply affecting memorial of his almost idolatrous love for one\r\nwholly unworthy to receive it; but they also help measurably to explain\r\nwhy Beethoven defeated his own benevolent intentions. In them the\r\nparadoxes in his nature are piled one on top of the other. Alternately\r\nthey breathe tender affection, gentle admonition and violent\r\naccusation; pride in the lad’s mental gifts, hope for his future, and\r\nloathing of his conduct; proclamations of his own self-sacrificing\r\ndevotion set off against his ward’s ingratitude; pleadings that the boy\r\nlove him and hate his mother; proud condemnation and piteous prayers\r\nfor forgiveness; petitions for the boy’s reformation and promises of\r\nbetterment in his own conduct. They give out the light in which the\r\nstory must be told, though they contribute but little to the record\r\nof concrete facts. They leave us to conjecture and surmise as to many\r\nof the nephew’s motives and actual doings. It is from the pages of\r\nthe Conversation Books of 1825 and 1826 that practically all of the\r\nattested truth concerning the happenings, their causes and effects,\r\nmust be learned. Letters and these records of conversations are at the\r\nbase of the following recital.[159]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: STUDY BECOMES IRKSOME TO KARL]\r\n\r\nKarl was taken from his studies at the Blöchlinger Institute in the\r\nfall of 1823 and matriculated at the University of Vienna, where he\r\npursued studies in philology from that time until the summer of 1825.\r\nThough his gifts were unquestioned and his attainments such as to make\r\nBeethoven eager to exploit them, he was not an industrious student.\r\nHe seems to have experienced a desire to abandon the career which his\r\nuncle wished him to follow--that of a professor of languages, no\r\ndoubt--before he had sat under the university lectures a year. His\r\nzeal for study soon evaporated, he spent much time in idle amusements,\r\nneglected to visit his uncle with the regularity expected from him,\r\nand soon broached the subject of a change in his intended pursuits.\r\nAs early as 1824 he expressed a desire to enter the army. The thought\r\nwas little short of appalling to Beethoven, who was obliged, however,\r\nat last to listen to arguments in favor of a mercantile career. Karl\r\npointed out that a bookkeeper earned a great deal more money than a\r\nprofessor, that trade was honorable, and that he intended to keep on\r\nwith his study of the languages, especially Greek, for his own pleasure\r\nand intellectual profit. Meanwhile he had continued his attendance on\r\nthe lectures at the university, and it was not until towards the end\r\nof the Easter semester of 1825 that Beethoven consented to the change,\r\nentered him in the Polytechnic Institute, and arranged to have the\r\nvice-director of the Institute, Dr. Reisser, appointed co-guardian in\r\nplace of Peters, with whom he took counsel as he also did, in great\r\nlikelihood, with Stephan von Breuning. There were two great admirers\r\nof Beethoven’s music in the Institute, Reisser and Dr. Ignaz von\r\nSonnleithner, one of the teachers, and after Karl had been placed\r\nunder the supervision of a government official named Schlemmer, who\r\nlived in the Alleegasse adjacent to the Karlskirche, with whom the lad\r\ntook lodgings, all seemed again to be well. He entered the Institute\r\nabout Easter, 1825, and, if his own statements are to be accepted\r\n(Dr. Reisser, too, makes favorable reports of him), he made a good\r\nbeginning in his new studies. His Sundays and holidays during the\r\nensuing summer were spent with his uncle at Baden, where he was kept\r\nat work, too assiduously perhaps, writing Beethoven’s letters, and\r\nfilling numerous other commissions. But his zeal did not endure. He\r\nbecame negligent in his studies; work became irksome and the pleasures\r\nof the city alluring. He was drawn willingly into the maelstrom of\r\nViennese life. He grew fond of billiards, dancing and the theatre;\r\nhe kept low company. Of all this there can be no doubt. Beethoven\r\nkept himself informed as to his conduct through Holz, through his\r\nbrother, and sometimes went to Vienna himself to make inquiries. When\r\nKarl comes to Baden, Beethoven charges him with his shortcomings and\r\nthere are unseemly scenes between the two. At first Karl seeks to be\r\nconciliatory, but it is only too plain that he is not always frank and\r\ntruthful in his replies. The chronological course of events as learned\r\nfrom the Conversation Books cannot be set down with exactitude; nor\r\nis it necessary that it should. A young rake’s progress can easily\r\nbe imagined, but some incidents may be included in this narrative, as\r\nshowing the changing attitude of guardian and ward, uncle and nephew,\r\ntoward each other, and some of the steps which led to the final\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\nAt an early date in this period Beethoven had become suspicious of\r\nthe character of some of Karl’s associates, particularly of a lad\r\nof his own age named Niemetz, whose acquaintance, it was said, he\r\nmade at his mother’s. Whether or not this is true cannot be proved;\r\nbut if Beethoven believed it that fact sufficed to convince him of\r\nthe young man’s moral turpitude. Certain it is that the mother knew\r\nNiemetz and thought as well of him as the uncle thought ill, for one\r\nof her exclamations after the attempt at self-destruction, reported\r\nto Beethoven, was, “What will good Niemetz say!” Beethoven forbade\r\nthe association and a violent quarrel ensued in Baden, where Karl\r\nintroduced his friend to his uncle. It seems likely that the encounter\r\ntook place in a public room and that Beethoven could not wait until\r\nhe had reached the privacy of his lodgings before expressing his\r\ndissatisfaction with the young man; for his remarks to Karl as well as\r\nthe latter’s replies are written in the book. Beethoven’s denunciations\r\nstir up a spirit of defiance in his ward; he finally declares flatly\r\nthat Niemetz had cheered his unhappy hours at Blöchlinger’s and that he\r\nwould not now lie by saying that he would cease loving his friend or\r\nadmit that he had a bad character.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEETHOVEN PLEADS WITH HIS NEPHEW]\r\n\r\nBeethoven learns that Karl goes to the theatre, has been seen in the\r\ncompany of lewd women, frequents dancing places, plays billiards and\r\nborrows money. Holz, who once suggests the advisability of assuming\r\nthe co-guardianship, thinks it might be a good thing could he attach\r\nthe young man to himself by becoming his often companion. He invites\r\nhim to a beerhouse to learn his drinking habits and reports favorably\r\nupon them. He talks with Karl about the theatre and advises him to\r\ngo less to the Josephstadt playhouse and oftener to the Burg, where\r\nclassical pieces are played; and learning that Karl attends the former\r\nbecause it costs him nothing, ventures the statement that his uncle\r\nwill allow him money for the theatre if he will but go to the better\r\nplace. Beethoven’s views on the subject are expressed in a letter:\r\n“Let the theatre alone for the present.” After the wicked deed, Holz\r\nreminded Beethoven that Johann van Beethoven had said that Karl knew\r\nevery strumpet in Vienna and that investigation had disclosed that he\r\nwas right. Karl goes to dances; Beethoven is so solicitous as to their\r\ncharacter that he expressed a desire to go to some of them with Holz so\r\nas to learn what they are like, and Holz dissuades him on the ground\r\nthat he would be stared at and it would cause public comment; but he\r\noffers to take him to a hall “of the reformed” in the Apollo Room,\r\nwhere he would be less observed. Beethoven fears that Karl’s passion\r\nfor billiards will lead him astray, and Holz says he will sometime go\r\nwith the lad to see how well he plays and thus learn whether or not\r\nhe plays much.[160] Karl is now nearly 20 years old, but Beethoven\r\ndoes not, or will not, know that he is no longer to be disciplined as\r\na child. He commands Schlemmer that he is not to be permitted to go\r\nout at night except on written permission signed by him. He exhausts\r\nDr. Reisser’s patience with his frequent calls to learn of the young\r\nman’s habits and conduct. He takes upon himself the task of the\r\nancient pedagogue and waits for him upon the steps of the Institute to\r\naccompany him home. His illness and melancholy, due to his solitary\r\nlife in Baden, increase and he is haunted by premonitions of death. In\r\na Conversation Book he once writes what seems to be the title of an\r\nimaginary composition “On the Death of Beethoven.” On June 9, 1825, he\r\nwrites to Karl: “You know how I live here. To this is added the cold\r\nweather. This solitude weakens me still more, for my weakness really\r\noften borders on a swoon. O, do not pain me more! The man with the\r\nscythe will not give me much more time.” In the same summer: “God will\r\nset me free from them. _Libera me domine de illis etc._” and “God be\r\nwith you and me. It will soon be all over with your faithful father.”\r\nHis loneliness oppresses him more and more as fears for his nephew’s\r\nfate and recognition of his own impotency to avert it pursue him. “God\r\nhas never deserted me. Somebody will be found who will close my eyes,”\r\nhe writes on September 14. Tenderness and reproach alternate in the\r\nletters written from Baden in the summer of 1825. With the young man’s\r\nhabits of extravagance he has no patience whatever. He insists on a\r\nstrict accounting for every florin which he allows him and is enraged\r\nwhen he hears that Karl has not forgotten his boyish trick of borrowing\r\nfrom the servants. He contrasts his own habits of thrift with the\r\nprodigence of his ward: “I should have gotten along two years with the\r\nwalking-coat. True, I have the bad habit of always wearing an old coat\r\nat home, but Mr. Karl--O, what a shame! And why? The money-bag Mr. L.\r\nv. B-n is here only for this purpose.”\r\n\r\nThe thought of laying down the guardianship occupies his mind over and\r\nover again and his friends without exception urge him to do it; but he\r\nclings to the office, hoping against hope for his nephew’s reclamation.\r\nCrises of apprehension and foreboding produce tender appeals and\r\npiteous expostulations like these:\r\n\r\n    If you find me violent, ascribe it to my great concern for\r\n    yourself, beset as you are by many dangers.\r\n\r\n    I hope at least to receive a letter from you to-morrow. Do not make\r\n    me fear. O, think of my sufferings! By good right I ought to have\r\n    no cares of this kind; but what have I not experienced!\r\n\r\n    Reflect that I am sitting here and might easily fall ill.\r\n\r\n    God is my witness, I dreamed only of being rid of you and of this\r\n    miserable brother and the hideous family which he foisted upon me.\r\n    God hear my prayer for I can _never_ trust you again. Unfortunately\r\n    your father--or rather, not your father.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of October, 1825, Karl absented himself from his\r\nlodgings for several days. Where he went and what he did is a secret\r\nheld by the dead; but repentance of some sort, or consideration of the\r\nfact that he was dependent upon his uncle, seems to have persuaded him\r\nto write to Beethoven and beg his forgiveness. On the 5th of the month\r\nBeethoven wrote from Baden:\r\n\r\n    Precious, dear son!\r\n\r\n    I have just received your letter. Already filled with anxiety I had\r\n    to-day determined to hurry to Vienna. God be thanked, it is not\r\n    necessary. Do but obey me and love and happiness of the soul paired\r\n    with human happiness will be at our side and you will consort an\r\n    intensive existence with the external, but it were better that the\r\n    _former_ dominate the _latter_.--_il fait trop froid_--I am to see\r\n    you on Saturday, then, write whether you are coming in the morning\r\n    or evening so that I may hasten to meet you.--I embrace you and\r\n    kiss you a thousand times not my _lost_ (prodigal) _but my new-born\r\n    son_. I wrote to Schlemmer--do not think harshly on that account--I\r\n    am still so full of fear.\r\n\r\nThe letter has been mutilated and the remainder is unintelligible, all\r\nbut a request in bad French for matches. But his impatience to see the\r\nreturned prodigal was stronger than his purpose to wait for him in\r\nBaden. He went to Vienna and evidently sent the following letter from\r\nKarl’s lodgings:\r\n\r\n    My precious son:\r\n\r\n    Go no further--Come but to my arms, not a harsh word shall you\r\n    hear. O God, do not rush to destruction.... You shall be received\r\n    lovingly as ever. What to consider, what to do in the future--this\r\n    we will talk over affectionately. On my word of honor no\r\n    reproaches, since they would in no case do good now. Henceforth you\r\n    may expect from me only the most loving care and help. Do but come.\r\n    Come to the faithful heart of your father.\r\n\r\n  Beethoven.\r\n\r\n  _Volti sub._\r\n\r\n    Come home at once on getting this.\r\n\r\n    _Si vous ne viendres pas rous me tuerés surement lisès la lettre et\r\n    restés a la maison chez vous, venes de m’embrasser votre pere vous\r\n    vraiment adonné soyes assurés, que tout cela resterá entre nous._\r\n\r\n    (On the margin): Only for God’s sake come back home to-day. It\r\n    might bring you, who knows what danger. Hurry, hurry!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE NEPHEW RESENTS DISCIPLINE]\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1826, Beethoven’s plans with reference to the\r\nsupervision of his nephew are divided between an abandonment of the\r\nguardianship and taking the young man back into his own lodgings. The\r\nlatter alternative at least did not meet with Karl’s approval, who\r\npleads against it the great loss of time in coming and going to the\r\ndistant Institute; besides, he says, “it is only one year more and\r\nthen there will be no more separation.” With such feigned expressions\r\nof gentle feeling, with smiles and occasional cajolings, Karl had\r\nlearned that he could at any time bend “the old fool,” as he once\r\ncalled him in a letter to Niemetz, to his wishes. The fact is that\r\nBeethoven’s attempts at discipline had long ago become irksome to his\r\nnephew and his authority a burden which it was pleasant to forget in\r\nthe opportunities which freedom brought. He absents himself more and\r\nmore from Beethoven’s lodgings and spends less and less time at his\r\nown. The “miserable brother” is told by Beethoven to find out why,\r\nand reports the result of a talk which he had upon the subject with\r\nKarl, who had replied, in effect: the reason he did not come oftener\r\nwas that he dreaded the noisy encounters which always followed and the\r\ncontinual reminders of past transgressions. Also the turbulent scenes\r\nbetween his uncle and the servants. Johann takes occasion to tell his\r\nbrother that he might win the young man to him by a different mode of\r\ntreatment. He is apprehensive of the consequences of idleness and urges\r\nthat as soon as Karl completes his studies at the Institute, a place\r\nbe found for him in either a local or foreign business house. “In the\r\nlatter case,” he continues, “place the guardianship in Bach’s hands.\r\nYou are as little able as I to run after him always.” Beethoven’s\r\nconcern is so great that he is willing to take counsel of Schindler,\r\nwhom he had so unsparingly and, we believe, unjustly denounced to his\r\nnephew. Schindler is ready with advice, but first takes advantage of\r\nthe opportunity to air his grudge against Holz: “do not depend upon him\r\nin this matter,” he says in a recorded conversation. Karl’s requests\r\nfor money excite his guardian’s misgivings and he demands to see the\r\nreceipts for tuition fees and other expenditures. The growing feeling\r\nbetween guardian and ward, and some of its causes, are reflected in\r\nthe record of a conversation at Karl’s lodgings in 1826, when the\r\ncrisis is rapidly approaching. It is Karl who speaks, but the tenor of\r\nBeethoven’s utterances is easily to be surmised:\r\n\r\n    You consider it insolence if, after you have upbraided me for hours\r\n    undeservedly, this time at least, I cannot turn from my bitter\r\n    feeling of pain to jocularity. I am not so frivolous as you think.\r\n    I can assure you that since the _attack_ on me in the presence of\r\n    this fellow I have been so depressed that the people in the house\r\n    observed it. The receipt for the 80 florins which were paid in May\r\n    I now positively know, after a search at home, I gave you; it must\r\n    and no doubt will be found. If I continue to work while you are\r\n    here it is not in a spirit of insolence, but because I believe that\r\n    you will not be offended if I do not permit your presence to keep\r\n    me from my labors, which are now really piling up on me--all the\r\n    more since we see each other _here_, where there is time, enough to\r\n    talk over all needful things. You are mistaken, too, when you think\r\n    that I wait for your coming to _become industrious_. You also seem\r\n    to accept as _my views_ what I repeat to you as the opinions of\r\n    others as, for instance, the word of Haslinger and the twaddle of\r\n    Frau Passy. I know very well what to think of such gossip, but did\r\n    not consider it my duty to inform you about it. I hope that what I\r\n    have said will serve to convince you of my real views and feelings\r\n    and put an end to the strain which has existed of late between us,\r\n    though not on my side by any means.\r\n\r\nThis is not the speech of filial love and obedience, but neither is\r\nit the language of a naughty child. There ought to be no doubt but\r\nthat such exhibitions of independence and resentment, coupled with\r\nintimations of still greater independence of conduct, frequently\r\nfilled Beethoven with consternation and apprehension. Once, to judge\r\nof a recorded remark by Holz, Karl seems to have raised his hand in\r\nphysical violence against the uncle. Holz says: “I came in just as\r\nhe took you by the breast. At the door, as he was coming out.” It is\r\nthe only allusion to the incident in the book and we know none of the\r\nparticulars; but it and other scenes of tumult and the utterances which\r\nthey provoked must have inspired the dreadful conflict of emotions\r\nwhich finds expression in a letter written at this time:\r\n\r\n    If for no other reason than that you obeyed me, at least, all\r\n    is forgiven and forgotten; more to-day by word of mouth, very\r\n    quietly--Do not think of me otherwise than as governed wholly by\r\n    thoughts for your well-being, and from this point of view judge my\r\n    acts. Do not take a step which might make you unhappy and shorten\r\n    _my_ life. I did not get asleep until 3 o’clock, for I coughed all\r\n    night long. I embrace you cordially and am convinced that you will\r\n    soon cease longer to _misjudge_ me; it is thus that I also judge of\r\n    your conduct yesterday. I expect you surely to-day at 1 o’clock.\r\n    Do not give me cause for further worry and apprehension. Meanwhile\r\n    farewell!\r\n\r\n  Your real and true Father.\r\n\r\n    We shall be alone, for which reason I shall not permit H. to\r\n    come--the less since I do not wish anything about yesterday to be\r\n    known.\r\n\r\n    Do come--Do not permit _my poor heart to bleed longer_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEETHOVEN GROWS APPREHENSIVE]\r\n\r\nA poor heart, indeed! One that knew not how to win the love for which\r\nit hungered; and a mind “perplex’d in the extreme.” That love still\r\nwent out to the unworthy mother in spite of entreaties, warnings,\r\nlamentations, threats. In May, 1826, already at Baden, Beethoven hears\r\nthat Karl has again visited her; and on the 22nd he writes:\r\n\r\n    Till now only suspicions, although I have received assurances from\r\n    one that there is again secret intercourse between you and your\r\n    mother. Am I again to experience the most abominable ingratitude?!\r\n    No; if the bond is broken, be it so. You will make yourself hated\r\n    by all impartial persons who hear of this ingratitude.... I ought\r\n    not to mix into these miserable affairs. If the pact oppresses you\r\n    then in God’s name--I leave you to Divine Providence. I have done\r\n    my duty and am ready to appear before the Supreme Judge. Do not\r\n    fear to come to me to-morrow. As yet I only suspect--God grant that\r\n    _nothing_ be true, for your misfortune would truly be incalculable\r\n    indifferently as the rascally brother and possibly your--mother\r\n    would take it.\r\n\r\nLate in July, 1826, an intimation of some desperate purpose formed\r\nand expressed by the nephew was carried to Beethoven. The date is\r\nuncertain, but it was probably on Saturday, the 29th. The intention may\r\nhave been self-destruction, but it needed to be no more than a purpose\r\nto go out into the world, beyond an irksome supervision, to fill\r\nBeethoven’s soul with a terrible fear. He called Holz and together they\r\nwent to Schlemmer’s house in the Alleegasse. Schlemmer told all he knew\r\nin a few phrases which must have seemed shrouded with a pall as they\r\nfell upon the page of his book:\r\n\r\n    I learned to-day that your nephew intended to shoot himself before\r\n    next Sunday at the latest. As to the cause I learned only this\r\n    much, that it was by reason of his debts,--but not of a certainty;\r\n    he admitted only in part that they were the consequences of former\r\n    sins. I looked to see if there were signs of preparations. I found\r\n    a loaded pistol in a chest together with bullets and powder. I tell\r\n    you this so that you may act in the case as his father. The pistol\r\n    is in my keeping. Be lenient with him or he will despair.\r\n\r\nHolz went at once to the Polytechnic Institute and there found Karl,\r\nwho agreed to go back with him to Schlemmer’s, but said that he must\r\nfirst go to a friend’s house and get some papers. Holz engaged Dr.\r\nReisser in conversation while he waited for Karl to return. “A pistol!”\r\nremarked Reisser, “the young comedy hero!” But Karl had lied; he did\r\nnot come back to the Institute and Holz returned to Beethoven with his\r\nstory:\r\n\r\n    He will not stay here. I could not detain him. He said he would go\r\n    to Schlemmer’s, but wanted to get his papers from a friend while I\r\n    talked with Reisser. He would not be gone more than a quarter of an\r\n    hour.\r\n\r\nBeethoven apparently rebukes him for letting his ward out of his sight.\r\nHolz:\r\n\r\n    He would have run away from you just the same. If he has made up\r\n    his mind to injure himself no one can prevent him. He has till\r\n    September 3 to make up his examinations.... He said to me: “What\r\n    good will it do you to detain me? If I do not escape to-day I will\r\n    at another time.”\r\n\r\nSchlemmer reported the finding of another pistol. A new suspicion\r\nseized upon the mind of Beethoven. For some reason, though he may\r\nalso have uttered it orally, he wrote it down in the book: “He will\r\ndrown himself.” Probably he did not want the bystanders to know his\r\nthoughts, and the fear was therefore committed to the written page\r\nfor the instruction of Holz. What else was said at the time we do not\r\nknow, for the book here shows a mutilation; some pages are missing.\r\nPerhaps Schindler removed them in later years to save the integrity of\r\nhis account; or they may have been torn out by Beethoven himself when,\r\nsome weeks later, Holz advised him to look through his books against\r\ntheir possible demand for examination by the police magistrate; they\r\nmight contain references to affairs which he did not want to bring\r\ninto public discussion. The missing pages might have helped us in the\r\nchronology of the story, but the main facts are before us without them.\r\nIt was resolved first to go to the house of Niemetz, who it was thought\r\nmight be privy to Karl’s intentions, and then if necessary, to call in\r\nthe help of the police.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A BUNGLING ATTEMPT AT SUICIDE]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Karl, having given Holz the slip, went straight to a\r\npawnbroker and pledged his watch. With the money he bought two pistols,\r\npowder and balls. He did not dare go to his lodgings for the pistols\r\nwhich he had in readiness for the contemplated deed, and the new ones\r\nwere therefore necessary. For him the circumstance proved fortunate. He\r\ndrove out to Baden, and spent the night in writing letters. One was to\r\nhis uncle, and this he enclosed in one to his friend Niemetz. The next\r\nmorning, it being a Sunday, he climbed up to the ruins of Rauhenstein,\r\nin the lovely Helenenthal which his uncle loved so well, and there\r\ndischarged both pistols toward his left temple. He was a bungler with\r\nfirearms. The first bullet flew past harmlessly; the second ripped\r\nup the flesh and grazed the bone, but did not penetrate the skull.\r\nHolz said afterwards that, had he taken with him the pistols which he\r\nwas obliged to leave at his lodgings, he would have been a dead man;\r\ntheir barrels were charged with powder and ball to above the middle.\r\nA teamster came upon him lying among the ruins and, no doubt at his\r\nrequest, carried him to his mother’s house in the city. There Beethoven\r\nfound him, whether in a search for him or because of intelligence\r\nbrought by the teamster is not clear. The uncle is anxious to learn the\r\nparticulars of the tragedy, but he receives a sullen answer; “It is\r\ndone. Now, only a surgeon who can hold his tongue. Smetana, if he is\r\nhere. Do not plague me with reproaches and lamentations; it is past.\r\nLater all matters may be adjusted.” “When did it happen?” Beethoven\r\nasks and the mother writes the answer: “He has just come. The teamster\r\ncarried him down from a rock in Baden and has just driven out to\r\nyou.--I beg of you to tell the surgeon not to make a report or they\r\nwill take him away from here at once, and we fear the worst. There is a\r\nbullet in his head on the left side.”\r\n\r\nSmetana was the physician who had treated Karl when he was a boy at\r\nGiannatasio’s school. Beethoven knew him as a friend. To him he wrote:\r\n\r\n    A great misfortune has happened to Karl accidentally by his own\r\n    hand. I hope that he can yet be saved, especially by you if you\r\n    come quickly. Karl has a _bullet_ in his head, how, you shall\r\n    learn--only quick, for God’s sake, quick!\r\n\r\n    In order to save time it was necessary to take him to his mother’s,\r\n    where he now is--the address follows.\r\n\r\nHolz took this letter for delivery but before he left the place a\r\nsurgeon named Dögl had been called in. Smetana said that Dögl was a\r\ncapable practitioner and that in order not to compromise him he would\r\nnot come unless Dögl desired to see him in consultation. Karl expressed\r\nhimself as satisfied and the case was left for the time being in Dögl’s\r\nhands. Beethoven went home, but Holz remained some time longer. The\r\nmatter had to be reported to the police and Holz thought it best to\r\ndo this himself, as he wanted to be able to inform Beethoven what the\r\nconsequences of the young man’s act were likely to be in case of his\r\nrecovery. He learned, and so reported, that there would be a severe\r\nreprimand and thereafter police surveillance. He told Beethoven that,\r\nafter he had left him, Karl had said, “If he would only not show\r\nhimself again!” and “If he would only quit his reproaches!” He had\r\nalso threatened to tear the bandage from the wound if another word was\r\nspoken to him about his uncle.\r\n\r\nOn August 7th, the day being a Monday,[161] the wounded youth, who by\r\nhis act was fallen into the hands of the law, was removed from his\r\nmother’s house to the general hospital by the police authorities.\r\nThe deed was committed on a Sunday, as appears from parts of the\r\nconversations which took place between Holz and Beethoven after the\r\nfact was known. Holz says: “He left me yesterday, went straight into\r\nthe city, bought the pistols and drove to Baden”; and later: “He sold\r\nhis watch on Saturday and with the proceeds bought two new pistols.”\r\nThe obvious conclusion would seem to be that Karl shot himself on\r\nSunday, August 6; but there is evidence pointing to an earlier date.\r\nThe police authorities were not informed until somewhat late in the\r\nday. An investigation had to be made and formalities complied with\r\nbefore the removal to the hospital could take place. Schlemmer, in\r\nreply to a question touching Karl’s indebtedness while Beethoven and\r\nHolz were probing for a cause, said that he had been paid “for this\r\nmonth, but not for August,” which indicates that the inquiry was made\r\nin July. On September 11th, discussing the disposition to be made of\r\nthe nephew when he should leave the hospital and trying to persuade\r\nBeethoven to grant Karl’s request that he be permitted to visit his\r\nmother, Holz says: “In my opinion _one_ day will make no difference,\r\ninasmuch as she was with him whole days after the shooting.” There are,\r\nbesides, evidences that conversations were held for several days during\r\nwhich he was in the care of his mother. It is therefore probable that\r\nthe nephew made the attempt upon his life on Sunday, July 30. Schindler\r\nsays “in August” without giving a specific date. The evidence is not\r\nentirely conclusive; but if Beethoven consented to leave the would-be\r\nsuicide in the hands of his mother for an entire week it was most\r\nlikely because the police authorities commanded it; he did not yield\r\nher a day after her son came out of the hospital. At first, however,\r\nBeethoven’s spirit was broken by the awful blow and he may have been\r\nmore pliant than usual. Holz, reporting to Beethoven, tells of an\r\ninterview at the hospital when he met the woman at her son’s bedside.\r\n“If you have anything on your mind,” she enjoined, “tell your uncle\r\nnow. You see, this is the time; he is weak, and now he will surely do\r\nanything you want.” Karl replied, sullenly: “I know nothing.” “How,”\r\nHolz explains to Beethoven, “can any one find out a single trace so\r\nlong as he persists in remaining silent?” And he tells his friend of\r\nthe lack of “mercy” in the weeping mother for denouncing the conduct of\r\nthe guardian of her son!\r\n\r\nNo doubt the blow was a crushing one to Beethoven. On the fateful\r\nSunday, or the day after, he met the wife of Stephan von Breuning and\r\ntold her the tragical story. “And is he dead?” she inquired in tender\r\nsolicitude. “No,” was the answer, “it was a glancing shot; he lives\r\nand there is hope that he will be saved. But the disgrace which he has\r\nbrought upon me! And I loved him so!” The occurrence was soon noised\r\nabout the city and much sympathy was expressed for Beethoven, as Holz\r\ntook occasion to inform him. Schindler says that the blow bowed the\r\nproud figure of the composer and he soon looked like a man of seventy.\r\nTo add to his sufferings he was compelled to learn that many persons\r\nplaced part of the blame for the rash act upon him. Karl was placed\r\nin the “men’s three-florin” ward, which was under the care of a Dr.\r\nGassner. He had an assistant named Dr. Seng, who told Gerhard von\r\nBreuning long after, how Beethoven had come to visit his nephew and\r\ndescribed him as a “dissolute fellow” and “rascal,” one “who did not\r\ndeserve to be visited” and had been “spoiled by kindness.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: REASONS FOR THE DEED]\r\n\r\nStrenuous efforts were made by Beethoven through Holz and others to\r\ndiscover what direct cause had led the misguided young man to attempt\r\nto end his life. The inquiries made of him at the hospital during the\r\nweeks spent there brought scarcely more information from his lips\r\nthan the first question asked by his mother. Schindler seems to have\r\nbeen persuaded that it was his failure to pass his examinations at\r\nthe Polytechnic Institute; but this theory is not tenable. Aside from\r\nthe fact that he had time till September 3 to make up his neglected\r\nstudies, he never himself advanced this as an excuse or explanation,\r\nbut explicitly denied it. In the hospital he told Holz that it would\r\nhave been easy for him to make himself fit to pass, but that, having\r\nmade up his mind to do away with himself long before, he had not\r\nthought it worth while to continue his studies. “He said that he\r\nwas tired of life,” Holz reports to Beethoven, “because he saw in\r\nit something different from what you wisely and righteously could\r\napprove.” He also phrased it thus: “Weariness of imprisonment.” To the\r\nexamining police magistrate Karl said that his reason for shooting\r\nhimself was that Beethoven “tormented him too much,” and also “I grew\r\nworse because my uncle wanted me to be better.” To Beethoven’s question\r\nif Karl had railed against him, Schlemmer replied: “He did not rail,\r\nbut he complained that he always had trouble.” Holz’s explanation many\r\nyears after to Otto Jahn was that Beethoven was “rigorous to excess\r\nin his treatment and would not allow him the slightest extravagance.”\r\nThe chief cause, in greatest probability, was that he had hopelessly\r\ninvolved himself in debts by a dissolute life. Schindler told Beethoven\r\nthat he not only played billiards but played with low persons, coachmen\r\nand the like; and that he did not always play honestly. There is a\r\nmemorandum in a Conversation Book which discloses that Beethoven\r\nreceived specific reports about his conduct, and noted them for\r\nreference: “One night in the Prater.--2 nights did not sleep at home.”\r\nBeethoven stinted him the matter of pocket-money, and the scores of\r\nreckonings in the Conversation Books show how close was the watch\r\nkept upon every kreutzer placed in his hands. So he had recourse to\r\nborrowing and no doubt, though the fact does not appear plainly in\r\nthe books, he went into debt at the places which he frequented for\r\npleasure. When he shot himself he had paid his lodging bill for the\r\nmonth but owed his tutor. A matter which gave Beethoven great concern\r\nwas the discovery that he had disposed of some of the composer’s books\r\nat an antiquary’s. This was theft, a penal offence, and Beethoven seems\r\nto have been in great trepidation lest the fact, and something more\r\ndreadful still which he did not know, be discovered by the magistrate\r\ncharged with an examination into the case. Under the Austrian code an\r\nattempt at suicide seems to have been an offence against the Church\r\nand guilty persons were remanded in the care of priests who imparted\r\nreligious instruction until a profession of conversion could be\r\nrecorded. In the case of Karl, this medicine for the mind and soul\r\nwas administered by a Redemptorist, and, the Liguorian penances being\r\nproverbially strict, Holz inspired the hope in Beethoven that Karl’s\r\nsecret would be discovered by the priest. “These Liguorians are like\r\nleeches,” is one of his remarks to the composer while Karl is lying at\r\nthe hospital. It is pathetic to note that Beethoven himself, willing\r\nas he was to charge his nephew with prevarication, extravagance,\r\ndeception and frivolity, yet sought an explanation for the act outside\r\nof these delinquencies. In his hand appears a note in a Conversation\r\nBook: “Mental aberration and insanity; the heat, too--afflicted with\r\nheadaches since childhood.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PLANNING A MILITARY LIFE FOR KARL]\r\n\r\nImmediately after Karl’s removal to the hospital Holz visited him and\r\nmade a long report to Beethoven, from which it appears that there\r\nwas no delay in considering plans for the future. In fact, a prompt\r\ndecision was necessary, for it was the penal aspect of the case which\r\nhad the greatest terrors for Beethoven. Holz says: “Here you see\r\ningratitude as clear as the sun! Why do you want further to restrain\r\nhim? Once with the military, he will be under the strictest discipline,\r\nand if you want to do anything more for him you need only make him a\r\nsmall allowance monthly. A soldier at once.... Do you still doubt? This\r\nis a marvellous document.” The last remark may have been called out,\r\nindeed, it seems more than probable that it was, by the letter written\r\nby the nephew on the eve of his attempt--a letter which has never been\r\nfound. Holz also urges: “Resign the guardianship; this will make an\r\nimpression on him.” Beethoven must now needs listen to upbraidings\r\nbecause of his lenient treatment of his ward: “If your good nature had\r\nnot so often got the better of your firmness you would have driven him\r\naway long ago”; but Beethoven still hungers for the ingrate’s love. He\r\nasks about his feelings towards himself. Holz answers: “He said it was\r\nnot hatred of you which he felt, but something entirely different”; and\r\nthen he puts the question: “Did he mean fear?”\r\n\r\nThe day after the deed, Stephan von Breuning, himself unable to come,\r\nsent Gerhard to his friend with a message: his parents wanted him to\r\ntake his meals with them so as not to be alone. Then Breuning comes,\r\nand now he will receive advice on the advisability of a military life\r\nfrom one fitted to give it, for von Breuning is a court councillor in\r\nthe war department. “A military life will be the best discipline for\r\none who cannot endure freedom; and it will teach him how to live on\r\nlittle,” is one of Breuning’s first utterances.\r\n\r\nHolz continues his visits to the hospital and his reports. His help was\r\nnow invaluable and he gave it unselfishly and ungrudgingly, winning\r\nthat measure of gratitude from Beethoven which found expression in the\r\nletter empowering him to write his biography. He tells Beethoven that\r\nKarl receives visits from four physicians four times a day. That the\r\nmagistrate is investigating the case and will send a priest to give the\r\npatient religious instruction, and that his release from the hands of\r\nthe police authorities must wait upon his “complete conversion”; but\r\nso long as there is danger of too much mental strain this instruction\r\nwill not be given. At ease in his mind touching the physical condition\r\nof his ward, Beethoven is kept in a state of anxiety about the inquiry,\r\nwhich is so protracted as to excite his apprehension that something\r\nawful may be disclosed. He wants to go himself to see the “Minister”\r\n(of Police, evidently) and dreads the ordeal of examination. “The court\r\nwill not annoy you,” Holz, tells him; “the mother and Karl at the\r\nworst.”\r\n\r\nDr. Bach joined Breuning, Schindler and Holz in advising Beethoven to\r\nresign the guardianship; but while the other three favored placing\r\nKarl in the army, Bach urged that he be sent off at once to some\r\nbusiness house in Trieste, Milan or Hamburg without waiting for him\r\nto make up his studies and pass the examination which seems necessary\r\nto Beethoven. “Away with him from Vienna!” is the general cry, but\r\nBeethoven hesitates; he still thinks that he must keep his ward\r\nunder his eye. In the Conversation Book he writes: “I wanted only to\r\naccomplish his good; if he is abandoned now, something might happen.”\r\nMeanwhile von Breuning in pursuance of his plan consulted Baron von\r\nStutterheim and persuaded him to give the young man a cadetship in\r\nhis regiment, and on September 11 Breuning is able to communicate\r\nthe success of his efforts to Beethoven who, as soon as he began to\r\nconsider the military proposition at all, had thought of his old\r\nfriend, General von Ertmann, the husband of his “Dorothea-Cäcilia.”\r\nBut the project failed, and Breuning carried the day for his plan and\r\nagreed to accept the guardianship which had been laid down by Reisser.\r\nThe Court Councillor goes at matters in a practical way; he brings to\r\nBeethoven von Stutterheim’s advice as to the allowance: he must not\r\ngive more than 12 florins in silver a month, as that was all that the\r\nrichest cadet in the service received.\r\n\r\nKarl was unwilling to see his uncle, and Beethoven knew it. The latter\r\nwrote to his nephew, however, and the affectionate tenor of the letters\r\nmet with the disapproval of both Holz and Schindler. Beethoven hoped\r\nwith them to win back his nephew’s love, but his advisers told him\r\nthey would do no good. He seems to have thought it necessary to learn\r\nKarl’s opinion before consenting to von Breuning’s plan. He visited\r\nKarl at the hospital, who, after asking his uncle to say as little as\r\npossible about that which was past alteration, said that a military\r\nlife was the one in which he could be most satisfied and that he was\r\nentirely capable of making a firm resolve and adhering to it. As a\r\ncadet, promotion would be open to him. Beethoven, in planning to keep\r\nthe young man in Vienna, had suggested to his advisers that the mother\r\nmight be sent away--to Pressburg or Pesth. After it had been fixed that\r\nKarl should enter the army as soon as possible after his discharge from\r\nthe hospital, the question arose as to what disposition should be made\r\nof him in the interim. Beethoven was unalterably opposed to his being\r\nwith his mother even for a day. In an interview he brought the subject\r\nup and began to berate her as usual; but Karl interrupted him:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A SON DEFENDS HIS MOTHER]\r\n\r\n    I do not want to hear anything derogatory to her; it is not for\r\n    me to be her judge. If I were to spend the little time for which\r\n    I shall be here with her it would be only a small return for all\r\n    that she has suffered on my account. Nothing can be said of a\r\n    harmful influence on me even if it should happen, if for no other\r\n    reason than the brevity of the time. In no event shall I treat her\r\n    with greater coldness than has been the case heretofore ... let be\r\n    said what will.... (He tells his uncle that his mother will offer\r\n    no objection to his new calling.) All the less, therefore, can I\r\n    deny her wish to be with me now, as I shall in all likelihood not\r\n    be here again soon. It is self-evident that this will not prevent\r\n    you and me from seeing each other as often as you wish.\r\n\r\nVery reluctantly Beethoven gave his consent that his nephew should\r\nbecome a soldier, and he continued his solicitude for him, as is\r\ndisclosed by letters to Holz and von Breuning. His first thought was\r\nto send him to a military institute and have him graduated as an\r\nofficer. This proved impracticable. Now he lays down three conditions\r\nas to the cadetship: he must not be treated as a culprit, not be\r\ncompelled to live so meanly as to preclude his advancement, not be too\r\nmuch restricted as to food and drink. The plans for this disposition\r\nwere made. He was to be presented to von Stutterheim as soon as he\r\nwas discharged from the hospital, take the oath of service the next\r\nday, and leave Vienna for Iglau, where von Stutterheim’s regiment was\r\nstationed, within five or six days. He was discharged as cured on\r\nSeptember 25. Breuning, who had assumed the guardianship, now found\r\nhimself confronted by a serious embarrassment. Where should the young\r\nman be sent while the preparations for his entry into the military\r\nservice were making? Karl did not want to go to his uncle’s, nor did\r\nvon Breuning want to send him there, and frankly tells Beethoven his\r\nreason: “If he were here you would talk to him too much and that would\r\ncause new irritation; for he testified in the police court that the\r\nreason why he had taken the step was because you harassed him too\r\nmuch.” Beethoven feared that the magistrate might allow him to go to\r\nhis mother’s, and to guard against this he wrote two letters to that\r\nofficial, a man kindly disposed toward him, named Czapka. In the first\r\nhe wrote:\r\n\r\n    I earnestly beg of you, since my nephew will be well in a few days,\r\n    to direct that he be not permitted to leave the hospital with\r\n    anybody but me and Mr. v. Holz. It must not possibly be allowed\r\n    that he be near his mother, this utterly depraved person. Her bad\r\n    and wickedly malicious character, the belief that she often tempted\r\n    Karl to lure money from me, the probability that she divided\r\n    sums with him and was also in the confidence of Karl’s dissolute\r\n    companion, the notice which she attracts with her illegitimate\r\n    daughter, the likelihood that at his m--’s he would make the\r\n    acquaintance of women who are anything but virtuous, justify my\r\n    solicitude and my request. Even the mere habit of being in the\r\n    company of such a person cannot possibly lead a young man to\r\n    virtue.\r\n\r\nIn a second letter he suggests that the magistrate admonish the\r\nyoung man and give him to understand that he will be under police\r\nsurveillance while he is with his uncle. Beethoven’s brother was again\r\nin Vienna. He had repeated his offer to give the composer a temporary\r\nhome and his nephew a harbor of refuge at Gneixendorf; but haste\r\nwas imperative, both on account of his business affairs and Karl’s\r\nstatus. In three days the business of finishing the corrections in\r\nthe manuscript copy of the Ninth Symphony which was to be sent to the\r\nKing of Prussia, placing it in the hands of Haslinger, who was to have\r\nit bound, and writing the letter to the King, was disposed of and on\r\nSeptember 28 the two brothers and their nephew set out for Gneixendorf.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[159] Beethoven’s letters to his nephew are presented in the original\r\nin Vol. V of Thayer’s biography as completed by Dr. Deiters and revised\r\nby Dr. Riemann. Also copious extracts from the Conversation Books.\r\nThese books, in Thayer’s transcript, have been consulted anew by the\r\npresent writer in his presentation of the case which he believes to\r\nbe in the spirit of Thayer, as he tried also to make the account\r\nof the legal controversy over the guardianship. Nevertheless, the\r\neditor believes it only right to assume full responsibility for his\r\nutterances. The letters may be found in translation in Vol. II of Mr.\r\nShedlock’s edition of the Kalischer collection.\r\n\r\n[160] It was Herbert Spencer who remarked to a young man who had beaten\r\nhim at billiards that while to be able to play well was a praiseworthy\r\naccomplishment, such playing as he had just witnessed betokened an\r\nill-spent life.\r\n\r\n[161] The date was obtained by Thayer from the records of the hospital\r\non September 22, 1862. F. Helm, then Director of the hospital,\r\ncertified to the facts of reception, treatment and discharge, but\r\nstated that no history of the case could be found in the records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\n\r\n    The Last Days in Gneixendorf--A Brother’s Warning--Beethoven\r\n    and his Kinspeople--The Fateful Journey to\r\n    Vienna--Sickness--Schindler’s Disingenuousness--Conduct of the\r\n    Physicians--Death and Burial.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Conversation Books add nothing to the picturesque side of the\r\naccount of Beethoven’s sojourn in Gneixendorf as it has been drawn from\r\nother sources. They indicate that there were some days of peace and\r\ntranquility, and that not only Johann, but his wife and nephew also,\r\nwere concerned with making the composer comfortable and providing him\r\nwith such diversion as place and opportunity afforded. At the outset\r\nBeethoven seems to have been in a conciliatory mood even towards the\r\nwoman whom he so heartily despised; and her willingness to please him\r\nis obvious. She talks with him about various things, praises Karl’s\r\nmusical skill, which the nephew demonstrates by playing four-hand\r\nmarches with his great uncle. She discusses his food with him, and\r\nif he ever was suspicious of the honesty in money matters of herself\r\nand her family, he hides his distrust and permits her brother, the\r\nbaker, to collect money for him in Vienna, and the woman to go thither\r\nto fetch it. There are frequent walks into the country round about\r\nand drives to neighboring villages, and it would seem from one of\r\nKarl’s speeches that sometimes argument and warning were necessary to\r\ndissuade Beethoven from undertaking promenades in inclement weather.\r\nCharacteristic of the suspicious nature which his dreadful malady\r\nhad developed in him to an abnormal degree, and confirmatory also\r\nof Michael Krenn’s remark that he was always called upon to give an\r\naccount of the conversations at table, is the evidence that the wife,\r\nKarl and even a woman boarder are questioned as to the goings-out and\r\ncomings-in of the inmates of the house. Before the departure from\r\nGneixendorf, Karl begins to chafe under his uncle’s discipline. Johann\r\nis occupied with the affairs of the estate and Karl does errands for\r\nhim as well as his greater uncle in Krems, whither he is willing to\r\njourney on foot as often as necessary, perhaps oftener, for there are\r\nsoldiers stationed at the village, there is a theatre, English circus\r\nriders give an exhibition (to which Karl offers to accompany the\r\ncomposer) and, what is perhaps more to the young man’s liking, there\r\nis a billiard-room. Of this fact, however, we are informed later by a\r\nremark recorded in the Conversation Books by Johann after the return\r\nto Vienna. The old suspicions touching the reasons for Karl’s absence\r\nfrom Wasserhof again arise to plague Beethoven’s mind, nor are they\r\ndissipated by Madame van Beethoven’s repeated assurances that he will\r\nreturn soon. It is plain that the young man is taken to task, not only\r\nfor these absences, but also for what his uncle looked upon as moody\r\nand defiant silences when suffering rebuke. Thus we read:\r\n\r\n    You ask me why I do not talk. Because I have enough. Yours is the\r\n    right to command; I must endure everything.... I can give no answer\r\n    as to what you say; the best I can do is to hear and remain silent,\r\n    as is my duty.\r\n\r\nAt a later period, when Beethoven has apparently upbraided the young\r\nman for his unwillingness to return to Vienna, Karl retorts:\r\n\r\n    If you want to go, good; if not, good again. But I beg of you once\r\n    more not to torment me as you are doing; you might regret it, for I\r\n    can endure much, but not too much. You treated your brother in the\r\n    same way to-day without cause. You must remember that other people\r\n    are also human beings.--These everlastingly unjust reproaches!--Why\r\n    do you make such a disturbance? Will you let me go out a bit\r\n    to-day? I need recreation. I’ll come again later.--I only want to\r\n    go to my room.--I am not going out, I want only to be alone for a\r\n    little while.--Will you not let me go to my room?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A RETURN TO VIENNA PRECIPITATED]\r\n\r\nKarl was a young man of nearly twenty years; thriftless, no doubt;\r\nindolent, no doubt; fond of his ease and addicted to idle pleasures,\r\nno doubt--but still a man; and no matter how much he ought to have\r\nbeen willing to sacrifice himself to make his uncle happy, it is a\r\nquestion if there was any way in the world to that sure and permanent\r\nresult. He was not wise enough, nor self-sacrificing enough, to do\r\nthat which not a single one of the composer’s maturer friends, not\r\neven Stephan von Breuning, had been able to do. Once in the Books he\r\nshows a disposition to resort to the wheedling tactics which had been\r\nfrequently successful in earlier years, and urges as a reason for\r\ntarrying longer in Gneixendorf that it will make possible their longer\r\ncompanionship. He is pleading for a week’s longer stay: Breuning had\r\nsaid that he should not present himself to the Fieldmarshal until\r\nno evidences of the recent “incident” were longer visible; in a week\r\nmore the scar would not be noticeable, nor would a stay be necessary\r\nhad he provided himself with pomade; then he remarks: “The longer we\r\nare here the longer we shall be together; for when we are in Vienna\r\nI shall, of course, have to go away soon.” It was after this speech\r\nthat he made the remark already referred to about the cheapness of\r\nfire-wood. Karl had plainly grown more than content with his life in\r\nGneixendorf and there is evidence to show that Beethoven had begun\r\nto fear that he was wavering in his determination to enter the army.\r\nSome drastic measure or occurrence was necessary to change the native\r\nirresolution of Beethoven’s mind. Schindler, in his desire to paint\r\nall the Beethovens, with the exception of the composer, with the\r\nblackest pigments on his imaginative palette, does not scruple to\r\naccuse Karl of undue intimacy with his aunt and offers this as a reason\r\nfor the departure. To this no reference can be found in the pages of\r\nthe Conversation Books, unless it be a remark which preceded Karl’s\r\noutburst, last recorded. Here he tells his uncle that all his “talk\r\nabout intrigues needs no refutation.” The reference is vague and it\r\nis extremely unlikely that the intrigues meant were those involved in\r\nthe vile insinuation of Schindler, for a reason which will be made\r\napparent presently. The house at Gneixendorf was not fitted for tenancy\r\nin winter; the weather was growing boisterous; Madame van Beethoven had\r\nleft the men to their own devices and gone to her town-house. This,\r\napparently, was the state of affairs when Johann handed a letter to his\r\nbrother which could have no other result than to bring about a decision\r\nto go back to Vienna at the earliest possible moment, and to carry\r\nwith him a heart full of bitterness which could only be intensified by\r\nthe sufferings which attended upon his journey. The letter bears no\r\ndate, but an allusion to the fact that von Breuning had allowed Karl\r\na fortnight for recuperation and he had already been two months at\r\nGneixendorf, is proof that it was written near the end of November.\r\nThat the brothers discussed it and cognate matters while it was in\r\ntheir hands is evidenced by the fact that it contains on its back the\r\nwords in Johann’s writing: “Let us leave this until the day you go.--An\r\nold woman.--She has her share and will get no more.” The letter was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    My dear Brother:\r\n\r\n    I can not possibly remain silent concerning the future fate of\r\n    Karl. He is abandoning all activity and, grown accustomed to this\r\n    life, the longer he lives as at present, the more difficult will\r\n    it be to bring him back to work. At his departure Breuning gave\r\n    him a fortnight to recuperate in, and now it is two months. You see\r\n    from Breuning’s letter that it is his decided wish that Karl _shall\r\n    hasten_ to his calling; the longer he is here the more unfortunate\r\n    will it be for him, for the harder will it be for him to get to\r\n    work, and it may be that we shall suffer harm.\r\n\r\n    It is an infinite pity that this talented young man so wastes his\r\n    time; and on whom if not on us two will the blame be laid? for he\r\n    is still too young to direct his own course; for which reason it\r\n    is your duty, if you do not wish to be reproached by yourself and\r\n    others hereafter, to put him to work at his profession as soon as\r\n    possible. Once he is occupied it will be easy to do much for him\r\n    now and in the future; but under present conditions nothing can be\r\n    done.\r\n\r\n    I see from his actions that he would like to remain with us, but if\r\n    he did so it would be all over with his future, and therefore this\r\n    is impossible. The longer we hesitate the more difficult will it be\r\n    for him to go away; I therefore adjure you--make up your mind, do\r\n    not permit yourself to be dissuaded by Karl. I think it ought to\r\n    be by _next Monday_, for in no event can you wait for me, inasmuch\r\n    as I cannot go away from here without money, and it will be a long\r\n    time before I collect enough to enable me to go to Vienna.\r\n\r\nHow Beethoven received this letter must be left to the imagination.\r\nIts wisdom temporarily disarmed Schindler, who forgot all of his\r\nfrequently wicked charges against Johann long enough to admit that\r\nthe document proved that he was not utterly without good qualities of\r\ncharacter. He adds that he was in a position to assert that Ludwig took\r\nhis brother’s suggestion with bad grace and that before his departure\r\nfrom Gneixendorf there was an exceedingly acrimonious quarrel between\r\nthe brothers, growing out of Ludwig’s demand that Johann make a will\r\nin favor of Karl, thus cutting off his wife. It is to this that the\r\npenciled endorsement on the letter refers. This subject, Schindler\r\nsays, was the real cause of the estrangement between the brothers\r\nduring the last five or six years of Ludwig’s life. The blame, he adds,\r\nrested with Ludwig, who, “constantly at odds with himself and all the\r\nworld, loved and hated without reason.” Weeks afterward, while he lay\r\ndying in Vienna, Beethoven’s thoughts were still occupied with the\r\npurpose of persuading his brother to make a will in Karl’s favor.[162]\r\nA moment’s reflection on a single fact will serve to give the quietus\r\nto Schindler’s insinuation as to improper relationship between the\r\nyoung man of 19 and his aunt of 40; at the time that Karl is pleading\r\nto stay in the country, Johann is urging his brother to send him about\r\nhis duty, and Beethoven is halting in irresolution, the woman is in\r\nVienna.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE FATEFUL JOURNEY FROM GNEIXENDORF]\r\n\r\nIt must be assumed that the Monday referred to in Johann’s letter\r\nwas Monday, November 27; but several days must have elapsed between\r\nthis date and the time when Beethoven and Karl set out on the fateful\r\njourney to Vienna. A determination seems to have been reached when\r\nthe Book shows Johann as saying: “If you are to start on Monday the\r\ncarriage must be ordered on Sunday.” There is no recorded conversation\r\ntouching the use of Johann’s carriage, which, so far as anything is\r\nknown to the contrary, may have still been in Vienna, whither, it is\r\nsafe to assume, it had carried Johann’s wife, and whither it was to\r\ncarry its owner as soon as he could make a satisfactory adjustment\r\nof his financial affairs. That means of conveyance were discussed is\r\nproved by Johann’s remark and also by a report made by Karl to the\r\ncomposer: “There is no postchaise to Vienna, but only to St. Pölten....\r\nFrom here there is no opportunity except by a stagecoach.”\r\n\r\nExactly when and how the travellers set out it is not possible to\r\ndetermine. Schindler says that owing to Johann’s refusal to let his\r\nbrother use his closed carriage, Beethoven was obliged to make the\r\njourney in an “open calash.” This is his statement in the first edition\r\nof the biography, but in the third, for an unexplained reason, the\r\n“open calash” is the vehicle used from Gneixendorf to Krems only, a\r\ndistance which was easily traversed on foot inside of an hour. If Dr.\r\nWawruch, Beethoven’s attending physician during the illness which\r\nended in his death, is correct, Beethoven told him that he had made\r\nthe journey “in the devil’s most wretched vehicle, a milk-wagon.”\r\nLater Dr. Wawruch calls the vehicle in which he arrived in Vienna\r\na “Leiterwagen,” from which we might gather, which is utterly\r\npreposterous, that it was a rack vehicle. Beethoven arrived in Vienna\r\non Saturday, December 2, and as there is a reference to only one night\r\nspent in transit (as there had been one on the journey from Vienna\r\nto Gneixendorf), it is likely that he left Gneixendorf early in the\r\nmorning of Friday, December 1. “That December,” says Dr. Wawruch, “was\r\nraw, wet and frosty; Beethoven’s clothing anything but adapted to the\r\nunfriendly season of the year, and yet he was urged on by an internal\r\nunrest and a gloomy foreboding of misfortune. He was compelled to\r\nspend a night in a village tavern where, besides wretched shelter, he\r\nfound an unwarmed room without winter shutters. Towards midnight he\r\nexperienced his first fever-chill, a dry hacking cough accompanied by\r\nviolent thirst and cutting pains in the sides. When seized with the\r\nfever he drank a few measures of ice-cold water and longed, helplessly,\r\nfor the first rays of the morning light. Weak and ill, he permitted\r\nhimself to be lifted into the _Leiterwagen_ and arrived, at last,\r\nweak, exhausted and without strength, in Vienna.” Wawruch derived his\r\ninformation from Beethoven, possibly in part also from Karl, the only\r\nwitness from whom a succinct and absolutely correct account was to have\r\nbeen expected; unhappily the tale, which Karl must have been called\r\nupon to tell many times, was never reported. The untrustworthiness\r\nof Schindler’s statements about the incidents of which he had no\r\npersonal knowledge is emphasized by obvious efforts made to falsify and\r\nemasculate the record in the Conversation Books, concerning which it\r\nwill soon become necessary to speak.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: ONE OF SCHINDLER’S SLANDERS REFUTED]\r\n\r\nIt was Saturday, December 2nd, 1826, then, that Beethoven arrived\r\nin Vienna from Gneixendorf and went to his lodgings in the\r\nSchwarzspanierhaus. It does not appear that he considered himself\r\nseriously ill, for in a letter to Holz which must have been written\r\ntwo, or more likely three, days later, he says merely that he is\r\n“unpässlich,” that is, indisposed. The letter was the second of its\r\nkind, the first having been mislaid. In this letter he asked Holz to\r\ncome to him. It was written from dictation, but before appending his\r\nsignature Beethoven wrote, “Finally, I add to this ‘We all err, only\r\neach in a different way’,” setting the quoted words to music for a\r\ncanon. This canon, of which an autograph copy on a separate sheet\r\nof paper is preserved in the Royal Library at Berlin, points to a\r\npossibility that some misunderstanding had arisen between Beethoven\r\nand Holz just before the former started for Gneixendorf. Inasmuch as\r\nHolz is at Beethoven’s side at least ten days before Schindler appears\r\nthere, and gives his services to the sick man until the end, though\r\nnot to the extent that Schindler does after his coming, the latter’s\r\nefforts to create the impression that Beethoven had sent Holz away\r\nfrom him is disingenuous, to say the least. Holz’s first act convicts\r\nSchindler of an error which can scarcely be set down as an innocent\r\none. The story involves one of the slanders against Karl which has\r\nbeen repeated from Schindler’s day to this, although its refutation\r\nneeded only a glance into the Conversation Books of December, 1826.\r\nSchindler says that he did not learn of Beethoven’s condition until\r\n“several days” after his return to Vienna. That he then hurried to\r\nhim and learned that neither Dr. Braunhofer nor Dr. Staudenheimer,\r\nthough sent for by Beethoven, had answered the summons and that Dr.\r\nWawruch’s coming was due to something only a little better than an\r\naccident. Karl, though charged with the duty of summoning a physician,\r\nhad forgotten, or neglected, to so do, for several days. His commission\r\noccurred to him while playing at billiards, and he incidentally asked\r\na _marqueur_ (scorer) in the billiard-room to send a physician to his\r\nuncle. The _marqueur_, not being well, could not do it at the time, but\r\nmentioned the matter some time later to Dr. Wawruch at the hospital\r\nto which he had been taken. This story of unexampled heartlessness,\r\nto which Dr. Gerhard von Breuning also gave currency, Schindler said\r\nhe had heard from Dr. Wawruch; but it is branded as a shameless\r\nfabrication by Dr. Wawruch’s published statement and the evidence of\r\nthe Conversation Book. Dr. Wawruch wrote a history of Beethoven’s\r\nillness entitled “Ärztlicher Rückblick auf Ludwig van Beethoven’s\r\nletzte Lebensepoche” under date of May 20, 1827, which was published\r\nby Aloys Fuchs in the “Wiener Zeitschrift” of April 30, 1842. In\r\nthis report Dr. Wawruch says, “I was not called in until the third\r\nday.” This third day would be December 5th, and the date has twofold\r\nconfirmation in the Conversation Book. A fortnight after Beethoven’s\r\nreturn to Vienna there is an entry in Karl’s handwriting of the\r\nphysician’s visits beginning with December 5th and ending with December\r\n14, which shows that within this period Dr. Wawruch made daily visits\r\nand on one day came twice. Schindler’s name does not appear until some\r\ntime after this entry, and it is recorded in a manner which indicates\r\nplainly that it was his first meeting with the sick man. As the book\r\nwas folded and renumbered by Schindler the page on which this entry\r\nappears is made to look as if it preceded others which are filled with\r\nevidences of Holz’s helpfulness, but the records of the first call of\r\nthe physician are plain and undisputable. It was Holz who sent for him\r\nand he did so on December 5, the day on which the first visit is noted.\r\nEvidently Holz had hastened to Beethoven on receiving the letter asking\r\nhim to come which Karl seems to have delivered to him on the 4th or\r\n5th. What passed at the first meeting does not appear, but this remark\r\nin the handwriting of Holz does:\r\n\r\n    I have had Professor Wawruch called for you; Vivenot is himself\r\n    sick. I do not know Wawruch personally, but he is known here as one\r\n    of the most skillful physicians.--He is Bogner’s doctor.--He is\r\n    professor in the hospital.--He will come after dinner.\r\n\r\nVivenot was a physician. In all probability Beethoven had exhausted the\r\nlist of physicians of his acquaintance (Smetana, a surgeon, may not\r\nhave been considered and Malfatti could not be at the time for reasons\r\nwhich Beethoven knew and was made painfully to feel later), before\r\nHolz succeeded in securing the attendance of Wawruch.[163] According\r\nto the accepted story, Braunhofer, who had been the last physician to\r\ntreat Beethoven before the misfortunes of the summer, had declined\r\nthe call because of the too great distance between his house and\r\nBeethoven’s, and Staudenheimer, whom Braunhofer had displaced, promised\r\nto come but did not. The latter, probably both, took part later in the\r\nconsultations. Wawruch was an amateur violoncello player and an ardent\r\nadmirer of Beethoven’s music. When he comes to his august patient,\r\nthough he permits Karl to write the questions, he takes the pencil\r\nhimself to tell who he is: “One who greatly reveres your name will do\r\neverything possible to give you speedy relief--Prof. Wawruch.” In his\r\nhistory of the case Wawruch writes:\r\n\r\n    I found Beethoven afflicted with serious symptoms of inflammation\r\n    of the lungs. His face glowed, he spat blood, his respiration\r\n    threatened suffocation and a painful stitch in the side made lying\r\n    on the back a torment. A severe counter-treatment for inflammation\r\n    soon brought the desired relief; his constitution triumphed and by\r\n    a lucky crisis he was freed from apparent mortal danger, so that on\r\n    the fifth day he was able, in a sitting posture, to tell me, amid\r\n    profound emotion, of the discomforts which he had suffered. On the\r\n    seventh day he felt considerably better, so that he was able to get\r\n    out of bed, walk about, read and write.\r\n\r\nDr. Gerhard von Breuning, who was concerned in proving that Dr.\r\nWawruch was a bungling practitioner, protests that Beethoven was not\r\nsuffering from inflammation of the lungs but from inflammation of the\r\nperitoneum, which alone, he says, could have brought on the dropsy of\r\nthe belly from which it has been thought until recently Beethoven died.\r\nHe based his opinion on the fact, which, though only a boy of 13, he may\r\nhave observed in the sick-room, that the patient did not cough, had no\r\ndifficulty in breathing, and that afterwards his lungs were found to be\r\nsound. Wawruch, however, an experienced physician, is speaking of what\r\nhe observed on his first visit and is not likely to have erred in so\r\nobvious a matter as incipient lobar pneumonia, the general history of\r\nwhich as now understood agrees with the recorded account of Beethoven’s\r\ncase, even in such details as the critical period reached on the fifth\r\nday. The subsequent strength of the lungs is not inconsistent with\r\nthe theory that in the first week Beethoven weathered an attack of\r\npneumonia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: BEETHOVEN’S HEALTH IN THE COUNTRY]\r\n\r\nThere are few references to the state of Beethoven’s health during the\r\nsojourn at Gneixendorf, but that he was ill when he arrived there is\r\nindicated by an early remark by Johann attributing an improvement in\r\nthe condition of his eyes to the good air “without rosewater.” Johann\r\nwrote later that, when with him, Beethoven ate little. When the food\r\nwas not prepared to his taste he ate soft-boiled eggs for dinner “and\r\ndrank all the more wine.” He had frequent attacks of diarrhœa. His\r\nabdomen also became distended so that he wore a bandage for comfort.\r\nWawruch had no knowledge of his patient’s previous medical history and\r\nwas compelled to discover for himself what his colleagues, to whom the\r\nsick man’s call was first extended, would have known from their earlier\r\nexperiences with him. Schindler attacks Wawruch on the ground that he\r\nhad said that Beethoven was addicted to the use of spirituous liquors.\r\nThe Conversation Books and other testimony plentifully indicate that\r\nthe great composer was fond of wine and that his physicians had\r\ndifficulty in enforcing abstinence upon him; but the only one who, by\r\nindirection, accused Beethoven of drinking to excess, was Schindler,\r\nwhose statements on that point are not free from the suspicion that\r\nthey were made only for the purpose of hitting Holz over Wawruch’s\r\nshoulders.[164]\r\n\r\nWawruch’s report continues:\r\n\r\n    But on the eighth day I was alarmed not a little. At the morning\r\n    visit I found him greatly disturbed and jaundiced all over\r\n    his body. A frightful choleraic attack (_Brechdurchfall_) had\r\n    threatened in the preceding night. A violent rage, a great grief\r\n    because of ingratitude and undeserved humiliation, was the cause\r\n    of the mighty explosion. Trembling and shivering he bent double\r\n    because of the pains which raged in his liver and intestines, and\r\n    his feet, thitherto moderately inflated, were tremendously swollen.\r\n    From this time on dropsy developed, the segregation of urine became\r\n    less, the liver showed plain indication of hard nodules, there\r\n    was an increase of jaundice. Gentle entreaties from his friends\r\n    quieted the threatening mental tempest, and the forgiving man\r\n    forgot all the humiliation which had been put upon him. But the\r\n    disease moved onward with gigantic strides. Already in the third\r\n    week there came incidents of nocturnal suffocation; the enormous\r\n    volume of collected water demanded speedy relief and I found myself\r\n    compelled to advise tapping in order to guard against the danger of\r\n    bursting.\r\n\r\nAfter Dr. Wawruch had reached this decision, Dr. Staudenheimer was\r\ncalled in consultation and he confirmed the attending physician’s\r\nopinion as to the necessity of an operation. Beethoven was told.\r\n“After a few moments of serious thought he gave his consent.” The\r\nservant Thekla, who had, apparently, come from Gneixendorf (as her\r\nname appears in the Conversation Book used there), in the midst of\r\nthe preparations for the operation had been found to be dishonest and\r\ndismissed. The composer’s brother had arrived in Vienna about December\r\n10 and thereafter is found constant in his attendance, a fact which it\r\nbecomes necessary to mention because of the obvious effort of Schindler\r\nto create the impression that the burden of the care of Beethoven had\r\nbeen assumed by him, von Breuning and the latter’s son Gerhard. Wawruch\r\nhad retained Dr. Seibert, principal surgeon (_Primärwundarzt_) at the\r\nhospital, to perform the operation. The date was December 20 (not 18,\r\nas Schindler says). Those present were Johann, Karl and Schindler.\r\nBeethoven’s sense of humor did not desert him. When, the incision\r\nhaving been made, Dr. Seibert introduced the tube and the water spurted\r\nout, Beethoven said: “Professor, you remind me of Moses striking the\r\nrock with his staff.”[165] Wawruch writes in the Conversation Book:\r\n\r\n    Thank God, it is happily over!--Do you already feel relief?--If\r\n    you feel ill you must tell me.--Did the incision give you any\r\n    pain?--From to-day the sun will continue to ascend higher.--God\r\n    save you! [_This in English._] Lukewarm almond milk.--Do you\r\n    not now feel pain?--Continue to lie quietly on your side.--Five\r\n    measures and a half.--I hope that you will sleep more quietly\r\n    to-night.... You bore yourself like a knight.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MULTIPLICATION AND HANDEL’S SCORES]\r\n\r\nIn the early days after Beethoven’s return to Vienna there is a\r\ncontinuation of the correspondence with Schott and Sons concerning the\r\npublication of the works which they had purchased, and before the end\r\nof December, probably in the third week, occurs the incident of the\r\ndisappointing gift from the King of Prussia which makes its appearance\r\nin the record with something like a shout of “Good news!” from\r\nSchindler. Karl is busily occupied in preparations for his military\r\ncareer and upon him, until the arrival of Holz, appears to devolve\r\nthe labor of writing and of carrying messages. The Conversation Book\r\nused by him on the 4th of December and the two following days bears a\r\npathetic proof of Beethoven’s helplessness in the matter of figures. A\r\npage or so is filled with examples in simple multiplication--tables,\r\nwithout answers, of threes, fours, sevens, etc.--and the remark, “Then\r\nbackwards.” Later Karl writes an explanation: “Multiplication is a\r\nsimplified form of addition, wherefore examples are performed in the\r\nsame manner. Each product is set under its proper place. If it consists\r\nof two digits, the left one is added to the product of the next. Here a\r\nsmall illustration: 2348 multiplied by 2.” It was thus that the great\r\ngenius approaching his 56th birthday was employing his time while\r\nwaiting in vain for the physicians who would not or could not answer\r\nhis summons!\r\n\r\nOne joyful event brightened the solitary gloom of the sick-chamber in\r\nthe middle of December. From Stumpff, of London, Beethoven received the\r\n40 volumes of Dr. Arnold’s edition of the works of Handel which the\r\ndonor had resolved to send Beethoven on his visit in 1824. Gerhard von\r\nBreuning pictures the joy of Beethoven at the reception of the gift,\r\nwhich he described as royal compared with that of the King of Prussia.\r\nOne day the boy was asked to hand the big books from the pianoforte\r\nwhere they rested to the bed. “I have long wanted them,” said the\r\ncomposer to his faithful little friend, “for Handel is the greatest,\r\nthe ablest composer that ever lived. I can still learn from him.” He\r\nleaned the books against the wall, turned over the pages, and ever and\r\nanon paused to break out into new expressions of praise. Von Breuning\r\nplaces these incidents in the middle of February, 1827, but his memory\r\nwas plainly at fault. Schindler says the books arrived in December, and\r\nhe is right, for Stumpff preserved the receipt for them, a letter and\r\nReichardt’s “Taschenbuch für Reisende,” which is dated “December 14,\r\n1826.” The gift was sent through the son of Stumpff’s friend Streicher.\r\n\r\nStephan von Breuning had called on Beethoven shortly after his arrival\r\nand the work of making a soldier of Karl was begun at once. It was\r\nexpected that the preparations would occupy only a few days, but they\r\ndragged themselves through the month of December, owing partly, no\r\ndoubt, to an illness which befell the Councillor. There were formal\r\ncalls to be made upon the Lieut. Field Marshal and other officers,\r\na physical examination to be undergone (it was most perfunctory),\r\nuniforms to be provided, the oath of service to be taken, and his\r\nmonthly allowance to be fixed. All this was disposed of by the date\r\nof the first tapping, and it was expected that he would set out to\r\njoin his regiment at Iglau before the Christmas holidays. There is\r\nno evidence of a change in the attitude towards each other of uncle\r\nand nephew. Some of Karl’s entries in the Conversation Books betray a\r\ntestiness which is in marked contrast to Beethoven’s obvious solicitude\r\nfor the young man’s position and comfort in his regiment; but the\r\nentries also indicate that illness had not sweetened the disposition of\r\nthe sufferer. His outbursts of rage are the subject of warnings from\r\nphysicians and friends. We have Schindler’s word for it that Beethoven\r\nbecame cheerful after the graceless youth’s departure for Iglau on\r\nJanuary 2nd, and the testimony of the Conversation Book that the old\r\nyear closed upon a quarrel between the two. Karl writes this greeting\r\non New Year’s day: “I wish you a happy new year, and it grieves me that\r\nI should have been compelled already in the first night to give cause\r\nfor displeasure. It might easily have been avoided, however, if you had\r\nbut given the order to have my meal taken to my room.”\r\n\r\nIt is very possible that Beethoven’s spirits grew lighter after the\r\ndeparture of his nephew. The service which Karl gave his uncle seems\r\nfrequently to have been given grudgingly and no doubt looked more\r\nungracious than it may really have been, when accompanied by protests\r\nthat he would not be found failing in duty and petulant requests that\r\nhe be spared upbraidings and torments. To satisfy the singular mixture\r\nof affectionate solicitude and suspicion which filled Beethoven’s heart\r\nand mind would perhaps have taxed the philosophy of a wiser as well\r\nas gentler being than this young man, who, as Johann’s wife told the\r\ncomposer in Gneixendorf, had inherited the testy family temper. When\r\nopen quarrels were no longer possible, it is likely that a greater\r\ncontentment than had lodged there for a long time filled Beethoven’s\r\nsoul. There is no record of the parting, and it is safe to assume\r\nthat it passed off without emotional demonstration of any kind. But\r\nBeethoven’s thoughts went swiftly towards his self-assumed duty of\r\nproviding for the young man’s future. The very next day he wrote the\r\nfollowing letter to Dr. Bach:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PROVIDING FOR THE NEPHEW’S FUTURE]\r\n\r\n  Vienna, Wednesday January 3, 1827.\r\n\r\n    Before my death I declare my beloved nephew my sole and universal\r\n    heir of all the property which I possess in which is included\r\n    chiefly seven bank shares and whatever money may be on hand. If\r\n    the laws prescribe a modification in this I beg of you as far as\r\n    possible to turn it to his _advantage_. I appoint you his _curator_\r\n    and beg his guardian, Court Councillor von Breuning, to take the\r\n    place of a father to him. God preserve you. A thousand thanks for\r\n    the love and friendship which you have shown me.\r\n\r\n  (L. S.) Ludwig van Beethoven.\r\n\r\nFrom Gerhard von Breuning’s account of the last days of Beethoven it\r\nwould seem that this letter, though written on January 3rd, and then\r\naddressed to his legal adviser, was not signed until shortly before\r\nhis death, and that at intervals in the interim it was the subject\r\nof consultations between the composer, Bach, Breuning, Schindler and\r\nJohann. Certain it is that before dispatching the letter to Bach,\r\nBeethoven submitted it to von Breuning for an opinion. Gerhard carried\r\nit to his father and brought back an answer which may have postponed\r\nits formal execution and delivery till two days before Beethoven died.\r\nStephan von Breuning was not willing that Karl should enter upon\r\nunrestricted possession of the property immediately upon the death of\r\nhis uncle. In his letter he pointed out that till now Karl had shown\r\nhimself frivolous and that there was no knowing what turn his character\r\nmight take as a result of the new life upon which he had entered. He\r\ntherefore advised that for the young man’s own good and future safety\r\nhe be prohibited from disposing of the capital of his inheritance,\r\neither during his lifetime or for a term of years after he had reached\r\nhis majority, which under the Austrian law then prevailing was the age\r\nof 24 years. He argued that the income from the legacy would suffice\r\nfor his maintenance for the time being and that to restrict him in\r\nthe disposition of the capital would ensure him against the possible\r\nresults of frivolous conduct before he should ripen into a man of solid\r\nparts. He recommended that Beethoven talk the matter over with Bach\r\nand wanted then to consult with both of them, as he feared that even a\r\ntemporary restriction would not suffice to restrain Karl from making\r\ndebts which in time would devour the inheritance when he should enter\r\nupon it. How Beethoven received this advice we shall learn later.\r\n\r\nThere is little that need be added to the story of the nephew. He was\r\nwith his regiment at Iglau. Through Schindler, Beethoven wrote him\r\na letter. It is lost, but apparently it contained an expression of\r\ndissatisfaction with Dr. Wawruch, for in the reply, which has been\r\npreserved, Karl says: “Concerning yourself I am rejoiced to know that\r\nyou are in good hands. I, too, had felt some distrust of the treatment\r\nof your former (or, perhaps, present?) physician; I hope improvement\r\nwill now follow.” He reports about his situation in the regiment, asks\r\nfor money and the flute part of the Pianoforte Concerto in B-flat\r\n(Op. 19), which one of the officers of the regiment wished to play,\r\nand adds in a postscript: “Do not think that the little privations\r\nto which I am now subjected have made me dissatisfied with my lot.\r\nOn the contrary, rest assured that I am living in contentment, and\r\nregret only that I am separated so far from you. In time, however,\r\nthis will be different.” But communications from the young man are\r\nnot many, and Schindler’s rebukes and complaints in the Conversation\r\nBooks about his undutifulness are probably only a reflex of Beethoven’s\r\nmoods and utterances. One cause of dissatisfaction was the fact that\r\na letter to Smart had been sent to him for translation and was not\r\npromptly returned. But he acknowledges the receipt of money towards\r\nthe end of February, and on March 4th he writes another letter, which\r\nhas been preserved. He sends his thanks for a pair of boots, says the\r\ntranslation of the letter to Smart must have been received, and adds:\r\n\r\n    To-day a cadet returned to his batallion who had been in Vienna on\r\n    a furlough; and he reports having heard that you had been saved by\r\n    an ice and are feeling well. I hope the report is true, no matter\r\n    what the means may have been... Write me very soon about the state\r\n    of your health ... I kiss you. Your loving son Charles.\r\n\r\nHere Karl van Beethoven practically disappears from this history. He\r\nnever saw his uncle in life again, nor even in death, for he was not\r\npresent at the funeral--as indeed in those days of tardy communication\r\nand slow conveyance he could not be.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SCENES IN THE COMPOSER’S SICK-ROOM]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding that they do not make a complete record, since the\r\nslate was also, and indeed largely, used by Beethoven’s visitors,\r\nand despite the fact that they have not been left intact, but bear\r\nevidences of mutilation and falsification, the Conversation Books\r\nfurnish a more vivid and also a more pathetic picture of Beethoven’s\r\nsick-room than the writings of Schindler and Gerhard von Breuning.\r\nBusy about the couch of the patient we see his brother Johann and his\r\nnephew Karl, besides Schindler, Holz and Stephan von Breuning. The\r\nvisits of the last are interrupted by illness and his official labors,\r\nbut his son, the lad Gerhard, frequently lends a gracious touch to the\r\nscene by his familiar mode of address, his gossip about his father’s\r\ndomestic affairs and his suggestions of intellectual pabulum for his\r\naugust friend. He is a daily message-bearer between the two households.\r\nEven at a sacrifice of space it is necessary to recount a few incidents\r\nof small intrinsic interest in order that some errors in history may\r\nbe rectified. Notwithstanding Schindler’s obvious efforts to have\r\nthe contrary appear, Holz continues to be faithful in attendance,\r\nthough his visits are not so numerous as they were during the weeks\r\nof Beethoven’s great trial in the summer. The reason was obvious and\r\ncertainly not to his discredit, though Schindler attempted to belittle\r\nit. Holz took unto himself a wife about the time that Beethoven\r\nreturned to Vienna. Thitherto he had been able to devote a large\r\nportion of the time not given to official duties to his friend. Now,\r\nthis was no longer possible; nor was it necessary after Dr. Wawruch\r\nhad assumed care of the case. Beethoven’s brother also returned to\r\nVienna and Schindler found his way back to the composer’s side within\r\na fortnight. It is Holz, however, who looks after the correction and\r\npublication of the last compositions, and collects his annuity; and if\r\nit were necessary, his apologists might find evidence of Beethoven’s\r\nconfidence in his friendship and integrity in the fact that there is\r\nno indication that he ever questioned his honesty in money matters,\r\nwhile there is proof in Schindler’s own handwriting that Beethoven\r\nthought _him_ capable of theft. It is pitiful that while Schindler is\r\nsacrificing himself in almost menial labors, Beethoven forces him to a\r\npained protestation that he had returned the balance of a sum placed\r\nin his hands wherewith to make purchases. Schindler himself records\r\nthe fact of Beethoven’s suspicion with sorrow. A livelier sense of\r\ngratitude took possession of the sufferer later and found expression in\r\ngifts of autograph scores (of the Ninth Symphony, for instance, now in\r\nthe Royal Library[166] at Berlin), and a promise, which he was unable\r\nto fulfill, to take part in a concert for Schindler’s benefit.\r\n\r\nWhether Schindler was always as scrupulously honest in his attitude\r\ntowards the public as he was in his dealings with Beethoven may be\r\ndoubted. There are mutilations, interlineations and erasures in the\r\nConversation Books which it is difficult to believe were not made for\r\nthe purpose of bolstering up mistaken statements in his biography,\r\nwhich had already been published when the documents passed out of his\r\nhands into the possession of the Royal Library. Here is a case in\r\npoint: Schuppanzigh has called and reported that one of Beethoven’s\r\nquartets had been enthusiastically received by the public at a\r\nperformance on the preceding Sunday (December 10, 1826). To what seems\r\nto have been an oral comment, Beethovens adds the words and music of\r\nthe motto from the Quartet in F: “Muss es sein? Es muss sein.” This\r\nmoves Schuppanzigh to say: “But does he”--(Beethoven, of course, whom\r\nSchuppanzigh addresses in the third person as usual)--“does he know\r\nthat the dirty fellow has become my enemy on that account?” Here we\r\nhave an unmistakable allusion to the anecdote about Dembscher and the\r\norigin of the Canon on the theme of the finale of the F major Quartet.\r\nA few pages later Schindler is the writer and has just brought the\r\nnews of the arrival of the ring presented to Beethoven by the King of\r\nPrussia. He had been asked to carry the ring to Beethoven, but had\r\nbeen unwilling to accept it unless he could give Beethoven’s receipt\r\nfor it in exchange. He adds the words “Es muss sein” as if in answer\r\nto a question by Beethoven. Now appear squeezed in between the music\r\nand the edge of the sheet the words: “The Old Woman (_Die Alte_) is\r\nagain in need of her weekly allowance.” The handwriting is plainly of\r\na different date and at the time of the conversation the “Old Woman”\r\nwas not in Beethoven’s employ.[167] It is not easy to acquit Schindler\r\nof a sinister motive here nor to avoid the suspicion that it was his\r\nhand which made an attempt to obliterate the entry on December 5, which\r\nproves that Holz sent for Dr. Wawruch on that date and thus gives the\r\nlie to the infamous story about Karl and the billiard _marqueur_. The\r\nevidences of Schindler’s eagerness to encourage Beethoven’s detestation\r\nof his brother and his suspicion of his nephew are too numerous to be\r\noverlooked, and some of them may call for mention later.\r\n\r\nAn offer by Gerhard von Breuning to bring one of his school-books\r\ncontaining pictures of classic antiquities is an evidence of the\r\nlad’s familiarity with Beethoven’s literary tastes. It was Brother\r\nJohann, however, who suggested the novels of Sir Walter Scott for his\r\nentertainment, and the impression conveyed by the story that after\r\nbeginning “Kenilworth” Beethoven threw the volume down with the angry\r\nremark: “To the devil with the scribbling! The fellow writes only for\r\nmoney,” that the composer would have no more of the novelist, is rudely\r\ndisturbed by evidence that Beethoven read all of Scott’s works which\r\nwere to be found in translation in the circulating library. Beethoven\r\nlater himself calls for Ovid’s “Metamorphoses”; and his interest in\r\ninternational politics is so keen that he is not content with an\r\nabstract of Channing’s great speech of December 12, 1826, but expresses\r\na desire to read a full report.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DISSATISFIED WITH HIS PHYSICIAN]\r\n\r\nWhile Beethoven’s friends are discussing with Dr. Wawruch the necessity\r\nof a second tapping, and Karl is packing his boxes for Iglau, the year\r\n1826 ends. The surgeon Seibert seems to have advised a postponement of\r\nthe operation. In a conversation on January 6, 1827, Schindler says\r\nto Beethoven: “Then Hr. Seibert was really right in still postponing\r\nthe second operation, for it will probably make a third unnecessary.”\r\nThere are now signs of Beethoven’s dissatisfaction with the attending\r\nphysician. Gerhard von Breuning has much to say on the point in his\r\nlittle book, and Schindler joins in the criticism many years after\r\nBeethoven’s death; but in the Conversation Books he appears more than\r\nonce as Wawruch’s defender. From von Breuning we learn that while at\r\na later date Malfatti’s coming was awaited with eagerness and hailed\r\nwith unfeigned gladness, Wawruch’s visits were ungraciously received,\r\nBeethoven sometimes turning his face to the wall and exclaiming “Oh!\r\nthe ass!” when he heard his name announced. But in the first week of\r\nJanuary, Schindler is still concerned in keeping up the patient’s faith\r\nin the skill of his physician. In a Conversation Book he writes shortly\r\nafter the remark about the surgeon:\r\n\r\n    He understands his profession, that is notorious, and he is right\r\n    in following a safe course.--I have a great deal of confidence in\r\n    him, but I can not speak from experience.--However, he is known as\r\n    an able man and is esteemed by his students. But as we are here\r\n    concerned with a _carum caput_ my advice from the beginning has\r\n    been always to take into consultation a physician who is familiar\r\n    with your constitution from _medical treatment_; such an one\r\n    generally adopts very different measures.\r\n\r\nEvidently, Beethoven renews his expression of distrust. Schindler\r\ncontinues:\r\n\r\n    Yet it is better and more advisable not to lose confidence in the\r\n    physician, for after all he has done a great deal.--It is a very\r\n    well-known fact that dropsy is very slow of cure.--Shall I come\r\n    when the doctor is here?\r\n\r\nA few days later (January 8, says Schindler, who was present) the\r\nsecond operation took place. There were no complications, the tapping\r\nwas accomplished without difficulty and Dr. Seibert reported that the\r\nwater was clearer and the outflow greater than the first time. Ten\r\nmeasures were drawn off. On January 11 there was a consultation of\r\nphysicians to which, besides either Dr. Braunhofer or Staudenheimer,\r\nDr. Malfatti had been called. It had become an ardent wish of\r\nBeethoven’s that Malfatti undertake his case, but Malfatti had refused,\r\npleading professional ethics, but no doubt actuated by reasons of a\r\nmore personal character. Many years before, probably as early as 1813,\r\nhe had been not only Beethoven’s physician but also his friend; indeed,\r\nhe was an uncle of the Therese Malfatti to whom the composer once made\r\nan offer of marriage. He made, what it is easy to imagine to have been,\r\nthe experience of all the medical men who undertook the care of the\r\ngreat man. Beethoven was ever a disobedient and impatient patient.\r\nHe became dissatisfied with Dr. Malfatti’s treatment and commented\r\nupon it and him in such a manner as to cause a serious and lasting\r\nestrangement. Ten years at least had elapsed between this incident\r\nand the time when Beethoven’s longing went out towards his one-time\r\nprofessional friend. Schindler’s story of the disappointments which\r\nhe suffered when first he tried to persuade Dr. Malfatti to take the\r\ncase in hand was printed in the “Frankfurter Konversationsblatt” of\r\nJuly 14, 1842. It was a long time afterward, and we can not withhold\r\na suspicion that it is rather highly colored, but since the coming of\r\nMalfatti was a matter of large moment to Beethoven and the treatment\r\nwhich he recommended (strictly speaking, he can not be said to have\r\nprescribed it, for Dr. Wawruch remained in charge of the case to the\r\nend) has a large bearing upon Beethoven’s physical condition and its\r\ncauses, it may be told here. Schindler writes, in his communication to\r\nthe Frankfort newspaper:\r\n\r\n    Never shall I forget the harsh words of that man which he\r\n    commissioned me to bear to the friend and teacher who lay mortally\r\n    ill, when after the second operation (January 8) I repeatedly\r\n    carried to him the urgent requests of Beethoven that he come to his\r\n    help or he should die. Dr. Wawruch did not know his constitution,\r\n    was ruining him with too much medicine. He had already been\r\n    compelled to empty 75 bottles, without counting various powders,\r\n    he had no confidence in this physician, etc. To all of these\r\n    representations Malfatti answered me coldly and drily: “Say to\r\n    Beethoven that he, as a master of harmony, must know that I must\r\n    also live in harmony with my colleagues.” Beethoven wept bitter\r\n    tears when I brought him this reply, which, hard as it was, I had\r\n    to do, so that he might no longer look for help to that quarter....\r\n    Though Malfatti finally took pity on poor Beethoven and abolished\r\n    Wawruch’s medicine bottles at once and prescribed an entirely\r\n    different course of treatment, despite the pleadings of the patient\r\n    he refused to remain his _ordinarius_ and visit him often. On the\r\n    contrary, he came only at long intervals and contented himself with\r\n    occasional reports from me as to the sick man’s condition. He was\r\n    not willing even to send one of his assistants to Beethoven and\r\n    consequently Dr. Wawruch remained his daily visitor in spite of\r\n    Beethoven’s protests.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: RECONCILIATION WITH DR. MALFATTI]\r\n\r\nOn January 19, after a second visit to Dr. Malfatti, Schindler wrote to\r\nBeethoven saying that the Doctor would come to him and begging him to\r\nseek a reconciliation, inasmuch as Malfatti still cherished resentment\r\nbecause of the treatment which he had received a decade before at\r\nBeethoven’s hands. Malfatti came, a reconciliation was effected,\r\nand under the inspiration of the changed treatment which Malfatti\r\nintroduced Beethoven’s spirits rose buoyantly, his physical condition\r\nresponded and the despair which had begun to fill the sufferer gave\r\nway to a confident hope of recovery. The treatment was simple, but the\r\nimprovement which it brought about was not lasting. Malfatti put away\r\nthe drugs and decoctions and prescribed frozen punch, and rubbing the\r\npatient’s abdomen with ice-cold water. Dr. Wawruch in his history of\r\nthe case confirms Schindler’s statement of the beneficial results which\r\nwere at first attained. He says:\r\n\r\n    Then Dr. Malfatti, who thenceforth supported me with his advice,\r\n    and who, as a friend of Beethoven of long years’ standing\r\n    understood his predominant inclination for spirituous liquors,\r\n    hit upon the notion of administering frozen punch. I must confess\r\n    that the treatment produced excellent effects for a few days\r\n    at least. Beethoven felt himself so refreshed by the ice with\r\n    its alcoholic contents that already in the first night he slept\r\n    quietly throughout the night and began to perspire profusely. He\r\n    grew cheerful and was full of witty conceits and even dreamed of\r\n    being able to complete the oratorio “Saul and David”[168] which\r\n    he had begun. But this joy, as was to have been foreseen, did not\r\n    last long. He began to abuse the prescription and applied himself\r\n    right bravely to the frozen punch. The spirits soon caused a\r\n    violent pressure of the blood upon the brain, he grew soporous,\r\n    breathed stertorously like an intoxicated person, began to wander\r\n    in his speech, and a few times inflammatory pains in the throat\r\n    were paired with hoarseness and even aphony. He became more\r\n    unruly and when, because of the cooling of the bowels, colic and\r\n    diarrhœa resulted, it was high time to deprive him of this precious\r\n    refreshment.\r\n\r\nWawruch’s remark here about Beethoven’s predilection for spirituous\r\nliquors formed the basis for Schindler’s charge, which has already\r\nbeen discussed, that the physician had slandered Beethoven and had\r\ntried to create the impression that he had contracted dropsy by\r\ninordinate use of alcoholic drinks. The account of the beneficial\r\neffect of Malfatti’s coming, no less than the treatment which he\r\nprescribed, is reasonable enough. Beethoven no doubt, in the warm\r\nglow of a recovered friendship, gave the physician a full measure of\r\nconfidence and hailed in him much more than the ordinary professional\r\nleech. It is also safe to assume that Malfatti knew from the beginning\r\nthat a cure was impossible and strove at once for temporary relief,\r\nwhich in Beethoven’s case was the surest of means for cheering him\r\nup and reanimating hope within him. By administering frozen punch\r\nhe stimulated the jaded organs more successfully than Wawruch had\r\nsucceeded in doing; at the same time he warned against excess in its\r\nuse and forbade the patient taking it in a liquid form. But this was\r\nonly at the beginning; when he saw the inevitable end approaching he\r\nwaived all injunctions as to quantity. Schindler says:\r\n\r\n    The quantity of frozen punch permitted in the first weeks was not\r\n    more than one glass a day. Not until after the fourth operation\r\n    (February 27th), when it was seen that the case was hopeless,\r\n    were all restrictions removed. The noble patient, feeling the\r\n    marked effects of a doubled and even trebled allowance meanwhile,\r\n    thought himself already half saved and wanted to work on his\r\n    tenth symphony, which he was allowed to do to a small extent.\r\n    From these days, so extraordinary in the sight of the friends who\r\n    surrounded him, the last lines are dated which he wrote to me on\r\n    March 17--nine days before his death--the very last page which the\r\n    immortal master wrote with his own hands:\r\n\r\n    “Miracles! Miracles! Miracles! The highly learned gentlemen are\r\n    both defeated! Only through Malfatti’s science shall I be saved. It\r\n    is necessary that you come to me for a moment this forenoon.”\r\n\r\nThe reiteration of the word “miracles” is indicated by the usual\r\nmusical sign of repetition 𝄎. There is no date in Beethoven’s\r\nhandwriting, but Schindler has endorsed it: “Beethoven’s last lines\r\nto Schindler on March 17, 1827.” The endorsement is of a later date\r\nand marks another obvious error of memory. It is not possible that\r\nBeethoven wrote the letter after he had himself abandoned all hope\r\nof recovery, as he had before the date affixed by Schindler. Most\r\nobviously the pathetic document is an outburst of jubilation on feeling\r\nthe exhilaration consequent on Malfatti’s prescription, as mentioned\r\nin Dr. Wawruch’s report. Schindler says that the “learned gentlemen”\r\nreferred to were Wawruch and Seibert. Wawruch says that Beethoven\r\nabandoned hope after the fourth tapping; Johann van Beethoven records\r\nthat the physicians declared him lost on March 16. Schindler in his\r\nbiography describes a letter written in February as the last letter\r\nactually written by the composer.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: TREATMENT OF THE PATIENT]\r\n\r\nGerhard von Breuning, prejudiced as he was against Dr. Wawruch, was yet\r\nfar from unqualified in his praise of Malfatti. He says:\r\n\r\n    But the usually brilliant physician seems to have been little\r\n    inspired in the presence of Beethoven. The frozen punch which he\r\n    prescribed to restore the tone of the digestive organs, excessively\r\n    weakened by Wawruch’s overload of medicaments, had, indeed, the\r\n    desired restorative effect; but it was too transient. On the\r\n    other hand a sort of sweat-bath prescribed a few days after the\r\n    second[169] operation was so obviously injurious to the patient,\r\n    filled with longing and hope, that it had to be abandoned at once.\r\n    Jugs filled with hot water were arranged in a bath-tub and covered\r\n    thickly with birch leaves on which the patient was seated, all of\r\n    his body but the head being covered with a sheet. Malfatti hoped\r\n    for a beneficient action upon the skin and to put the organs into\r\n    a productive perspiration. But the very opposite effect resulted.\r\n    The body of the patient, which had been emptied of its water by the\r\n    scarcely completed tapping, attracted the moisture developed by the\r\n    bath like a block of salt; it swelled visibly in the apparatus and\r\n    in a few days compelled the introduction anew of the tube into the\r\n    still unhealed puncture.\r\n\r\nThe story of this sweat-bath needs to be told, if for no other reason\r\nthan because it is the basis of another of the romances still current,\r\nwhich were retailed for the single purpose of presenting Beethoven as\r\na sufferer from the niggardliness of Johann. On January 25 (the date\r\nis fixed by a remark of Johann’s in the Conversation Book) Schindler\r\nbrought word to Beethoven that the mother of the singer Fräulein\r\nSchechner had sent for him that morning to tell him about two remedies\r\nwhich had proved efficacious in the case of her father, who had also\r\nbeen afflicted with dropsy. One of these was Juniperberry tea, the\r\nother a vapor bath from a decoction, the ingredients of which were\r\na head of cabbage, two handfuls of caraway seeds and three handfuls\r\nof hayseed (_Heublumen_). These remedies had been prescribed by the\r\nphysician of the late King of Bavaria and had worked a cure in the case\r\nof Madame Schechner’s father when he was 70 years old. Dr. Malfatti\r\nseems to have been told of these remedies and to have prescribed the\r\nbath, which, it is said in the Conversation Books, he recognized at\r\nonce as a cure used by Dr. Harz, the Royal Physician mentioned. Within\r\na day or two Schindler notes in the book, that he had asked Johann for\r\nsome hay and the latter had replied that his hay was not good enough\r\nfor the purpose; but the next day, on seeing the hay, which had been\r\nprocured from another source, Johann had said that he had plenty of\r\nthat sort and that his was dryer. Unwilling, apparently, to admit\r\nthat Johann might have been honest in his belief that the hay from\r\nhis stable was not fit for medicinal purposes, Schindler writes for\r\nBeethoven’s perusal: “Is it not abominable that he is unwilling even to\r\ngive hay for a single bath!” Yet this monster of inhumanity, unwilling\r\nto sacrifice even a wisp of hay for a dying brother, was at the time in\r\ndaily attendance upon that brother and had taken upon himself a great\r\ndeal of the onerous and disagreeable labor of the sick-room!\r\n\r\nAmong Beethoven’s visitors in February, near the end of the month,\r\nwhen Beethoven was at an extremity of his suffering, was the singer\r\nDemoiselle Schechner, who almost forced her way to the bedside to\r\ntell him of her great admiration for his music, of her successes in\r\n“Fidelio,” and that it was through singing his “Adelaide” that she had\r\nwon her way to the operatic stage. Under date of February there also\r\ncame to the composer a cheery letter from his old playmate Wegeler,\r\ncalling to his mind some of his early flames--Jeanette Honrath and\r\nFräulein Westerholt--and playfully outlining a plan by which the old\r\nfriends might enjoy a reunion: he would send, he said, one of his\r\npatients to Carlsbad and go there with him as soon as Beethoven should\r\narrange also to go there for his convalescence. Then, after a three\r\nweeks’ trip through South Germany, there should be a final visit to the\r\nhome of their childhood. And, as before, Eleonore sends a postscript\r\nemphasizing the pleasures of the reunion. Beethoven answered the letter\r\non February 17, and told his old friend how he had tried to send him a\r\nletter and portrait through Stephan von Breuning on December 10, but\r\nthe plan had miscarried. Now the matter was to be entrusted to the\r\nSchotts.\r\n\r\nZmeskall, faithful to the old friendship, a bound prisoner to his room\r\nthrough gout, sends greetings and inquiries through Schindler. From his\r\nsick-bed Beethoven answers him, not in the jocular spirit which marked\r\nhis voluminous notes of old, but in terms which breathe sincerity and\r\nreal friendship:\r\n\r\n    A thousand thanks for your sympathy. I do not despair. The most\r\n    painful feature is the cessation of all activity. No evil without\r\n    its good side. May heaven but grant you amelioration of your\r\n    painful existence. Perhaps health is coming to both of us and we\r\n    shall meet again in friendly intimacy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: COMFORT RECEIVED FROM ENGLAND]\r\n\r\nThough Beethoven had received the Handel scores in December, he does\r\nnot seem to have had an opportunity to enjoy Stumpff’s gift thoroughly\r\nuntil he turned to them for intellectual refreshment on his bed of\r\npain. He had signed the receipt for them in December, but it was\r\nnot until his thoughts turned to his English friends in the hope of\r\npecuniary relief that he wrote a letter to Stumpff under date of\r\nFebruary 8.[170]\r\n\r\n    How great a joy the sending of the works of Handel of which you\r\n    made me a present--for me a royal present!--this my pen cannot\r\n    describe. An article about it was even printed by the newspaper,\r\n    which I enclose. Unfortunately I have been down with the dropsy\r\n    since the 3rd of December. You can imagine in what a situation this\r\n    places me! I live generally only from the proceeds of my brain,\r\n    to make provision of all things for myself and my Carl. Unhappily\r\n    for a month and a half I have not been able to write a note. My\r\n    salary suffices only to pay my semi-annual rent, after which there\r\n    remains only a few hundred florins. Reflect now that it cannot\r\n    yet be determined when my illness will end, I again be able to\r\n    sail through the air on Pegasus under full sail. Doctor, surgeon,\r\n    everything must be paid.\r\n\r\n    I recall right well that several years ago the Philharmonic Society\r\n    wanted to give a concert for my benefit. It would be fortunate for\r\n    me if they would come to this determination now. It might save me\r\n    from all the needs which confront me. On this account I am writing\r\n    to Mr. S. [Smart] and if you, my dear friend, can do anything\r\n    toward this end I beg of you to coöperate with Mr. S. Moscheles\r\n    will also be written to about it and if all my friends unite I\r\n    believe that something can be done for me in this matter.\r\n\r\n    Concerning the Handel works for H. Imperial Highness Archduke\r\n    Rudolph, I cannot as yet say anything with certainty. But I will\r\n    write to him in a few days and remind him of it.\r\n\r\n    While thanking you again for your glorious gift, I beg of you to\r\n    command me if I can be of service to you here in any way, I shall\r\n    do it with all my heart. I again place my condition as I have\r\n    described it close to your benevolent heart and while wishing you\r\n    all things good and beautiful, I commend myself to you.\r\n\r\nStumpff had already been informed of Beethoven’s illness by Streicher.\r\nIt is evident that he went at once to Smart and Moscheles, and\r\nknowledge of Beethoven’s condition and request was communicated to the\r\ndirectors of the Philharmonic Society forthwith. Beethoven, meanwhile,\r\nhad written to both Smart and Moscheles, enclosing the letter of the\r\nformer in the letter to the latter; but the quick and sympathetic\r\naction of the Society was no doubt due primarily to the initiative of\r\nStumpff, for the letters could by no means have reached London when the\r\ndirectors held a meeting on February 28. Mr. Dance presided, and those\r\npresent, as recorded in the Society’s minutes, were F. Cramer, Horsley,\r\nMoralt, Dragonetti, Neate, Dizi, Beale, T. Cooke, Sir G. Smart, Welsh,\r\nLatour, Spagnoletti, Calkin, J. B. Cramer, Cipriani Potter and Watts.\r\nThe minutes continue:\r\n\r\n    It was moved by Mr. Neate, and seconded by Mr. Latour:\r\n\r\n    “That this Society do lend the sum of One Hundred Pounds to its\r\n    own members to be sent through the hands of Mr. Moscheles to some\r\n    confidential friend of Beethoven, to be applied to his comforts and\r\n    necessities during his illness.”\r\n\r\n    Carried unanimously.\r\n\r\nBoth Stumpff and Moscheles wrote the good news to Beethoven the\r\nnext day. Moscheles’s letter appears in his translation, or rather\r\nparaphrase, of Schindler’s biography. In it he said:\r\n\r\n    The Philharmonic Society resolved to express their good will\r\n    and lively sympathy by requesting your acceptance of 100 pounds\r\n    sterling (1,000 florins) to provide the necessary comforts and\r\n    conveniences during your illness. This money will be paid to your\r\n    order by Mr. Rau, of the house of Eskeles, either in separate sums\r\n    or all at once as you desire.\r\n\r\nHe added an expression of the Philharmonic Society’s willingness to aid\r\nhim further whenever he should inform it of his need of assistance.\r\nBeethoven’s impatience was so great that, having found Smart’s address\r\namong his papers, he wrote him a second letter on March 6th, being\r\nable now to mention the fact of the fourth tapping on February 27th\r\nand to utter the apprehension that the operation might have to be\r\nrepeated--perhaps more than once. On March 14th he was still without\r\nthe answer of his English friends and he wrote again to Moscheles\r\ntelling him of the two letters sent to Smart, urging action and\r\nconcluding with\r\n\r\n    Whither is this to lead, and what is to become of me if this\r\n    continues for a while longer? Verily, a hard lot has befallen me!\r\n    But I yield to the will of fate and only pray God so to order it in\r\n    his Divine Will that so long as I must endure this death in life I\r\n    may be protected against want. This will give me strength to endure\r\n    my lot, hard and terrible as it may be, with submission to the will\r\n    of the Most High.... Hummel is here and has already visited me a\r\n    few times.\r\n\r\nSchindler says that the appeal to London, which had been suggested\r\nby Beethoven, had been discussed with the composer by himself and\r\nBreuning, who agreed in questioning the advisability of the step\r\nwhich, they said, would make a bad impression if it became known. They\r\nreminded Beethoven of his bank-shares, but he protested vigorously\r\nagainst their being touched; he had set them apart as a legacy for his\r\nnephew which must not be encroached upon. The letters to Smart and\r\nMoscheles are mentioned several times in the Conversation Books, but\r\nthere is no record of a protest by Schindler or Breuning. Inasmuch,\r\nhowever, as much of the conversation with Beethoven was at this time\r\ncarried on with the help of a slate, it is very likely that Schindler’s\r\nstatement is correct. At any rate it serves to give a quietus to the\r\nfantastic notion of the romancers that Beethoven had forgotten that\r\nhe had the shares. Not only were they talked about by his friends,\r\nbut they were the subject of discussion in the correspondence and\r\ncongratulations between Beethoven, Bach and Breuning on the subject of\r\nthe will.\r\n\r\nThe last letters to Smart and Moscheles were scarcely dispatched before\r\nadvices were received from London. Beethoven dictated the following\r\nacknowledgment which Schindler, though he held the pen, did not\r\nreproduce in full in his biography:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MONEY FROM THE LONDON PHILHARMONIC]\r\n\r\n  Vienna, March 18, 1827.\r\n\r\n  My dear good Moscheles:\r\n\r\n    I can not describe to you in words with what feelings I read your\r\n    letter of March 1. The generosity with which the Philharmonic\r\n    Society anticipated my petition has touched me in the innermost\r\n    depth of my soul. I beg you, therefore, my dear Moscheles, to be\r\n    the agency through which I transmit my sincerest thanks for the\r\n    particular sympathy and help, to the Philharmonic Society.\r\n\r\n    I found myself constrained to collect at once the entire sum of\r\n    1,000 florins C. M. being in the unpleasant position of raising\r\n    money which would have brought new embarrassments.\r\n\r\n    Concerning the concert which the Philharmonic Society has resolved\r\n    to give, I beg the Society not to abandon this noble purpose, and\r\n    to deduct the 1,000 florins already sent to me from the proceeds of\r\n    the concert. And if the Society is disposed graciously to send me\r\n    the balance I pledge myself to return my heartiest thanks to the\r\n    Society by binding myself to compose for it either a new symphony,\r\n    which lies already sketched in my desk, a new overture or whatever\r\n    else the Society shall wish.\r\n\r\n    May heaven very soon restore me again to health, and I will prove\r\n    to the generous Englishmen how greatly I appreciate their interest\r\n    in my sad fate. Their noble act will never be forgotten by me and I\r\n    shall follow this with especial thanks to Sir Smart and Mr. Stumpff.\r\n\r\nSchindler relates that Beethoven on March 24, whispered to him, “write\r\nto Smart and Stumpff,” and that he would have done so on the morrow had\r\nBeethoven been able to sign his name. In a translation of the letter to\r\nMoscheles printed in a pamphlet published by the Philharmonic Society\r\nin 1871,[171] it concluded as follows:\r\n\r\n  Farewell! with the kindest remembrances and highest esteem\r\n  From your friend\r\n  Ludwig van Beethoven.\r\n\r\n    Kindest regards to your wife. I have to thank you and the\r\n    Philharmonic Society for a new friend in Mr. Rau. I enclose for the\r\n    Philharmonic Society a metronomic list of the movements of my ninth\r\n    Symphony.\r\n\r\n  Allegro ma non troppo  88 = 𝅘𝅥\r\n  Molto vivace          116 = 𝅗𝅥\r\n  Presto                116 = 𝅗𝅥\r\n  Adagio primo           60 = 𝅘𝅥\r\n  Andante moderato       63 = 𝅗𝅥\r\n  Finale presto          96 = 𝅘𝅥\r\n  Allegro ma non tanto   88 = 𝅘𝅥\r\n  Allegro assai          80 = 𝅗𝅥\r\n  Alla marcia            84 = 𝅘𝅥\r\n  Andante maestoso       72 = 𝅗𝅥\r\n  Adagio divoto          60 = 𝅗𝅥\r\n  Allegro energico       84 = 𝅗𝅥\r\n  Allegro ma non tanto  120 = 𝅗𝅥\r\n  Prestissimo           132 = 𝅗𝅥\r\n  Maestoso               60 = 𝅘𝅥\r\n\r\nThe history of the Philharmonic Society’s benefaction may properly be\r\ncompleted at this point. The money, as is to be seen from Beethoven’s\r\nacknowledgment, was collected by the composer at once. Herr Rau, of the\r\nbanking-house of Eskeles to whom it had been entrusted, called upon\r\nBeethoven immediately on receiving advices from London. It was on March\r\n15, and two days later he enclosed Beethoven’s receipt (dated March 16)\r\nin a letter to Moscheles which the latter transmitted to Mr. W. Watts,\r\nSecretary of the Philharmonic Society. Rau wrote:\r\n\r\n    I have with the greatest surprise heard from you, who reside in\r\n    London, that the universally admired Beethoven is so dangerously\r\n    ill and in want of pecuniary assistance, while we, here at Vienna,\r\n    are totally ignorant of it. I went to him immediately after having\r\n    read your letter to ascertain his state, and to announce to him\r\n    the approaching relief. This made a deep impression upon him, and\r\n    called forth true expressions of gratitude. What a satisfactory\r\n    sight would it have been for those who so generously relieved him\r\n    to witness such a touching scene! I found poor Beethoven in a sad\r\n    way, more like a skeleton than a living being. He is suffering\r\n    from dropsy, and has already been tapped four times; he is under\r\n    the care of our clever physician Malfatti, who unfortunately gives\r\n    little hope of his recovery.\r\n\r\n    How long he may remain in his present state, or if he can at all\r\n    be saved, can not yet be ascertained. The joyous sensation at the\r\n    sudden relief from London has, however, had a wonderful effect upon\r\n    him; it made one of the wounds (which since the last operation had\r\n    healed) suddenly burst open during the night, and all the water\r\n    which had gathered since a fortnight ran out freely. When I came to\r\n    see him on the following day he was in remarkably good spirits and\r\n    felt himself much relieved. I hastened to Malfatti to inform him of\r\n    this alteration and he considers the event as very consolatory. He\r\n    will contrive to keep the wound open for some time and thus leave a\r\n    channel for the water which gathers continually. Beethoven is fully\r\n    satisfied with his attendants, who consist of a cook and housemaid.\r\n    His friend and ours, Mr. Schindler, dines with him every day\r\n    and thus proves his sincere attachment to him. S. also manages\r\n    his correspondence and superintends his expenses. You will find\r\n    enclosed a receipt from Beethoven for the 1,000 florins (or 100\r\n    pounds). When I proposed to him to take half of the sum at present,\r\n    and to leave the rest with Baron Eskeles, where he might have it\r\n    safely deposited, he acknowledged to me openly that he considered\r\n    this money as a relief sent him from heaven; and that 500 florins\r\n    would not suffice for his present want. I therefore gave him,\r\n    according to his wish, the whole sum at once. Beethoven will soon\r\n    address a letter to the Philharmonic Society by which he means to\r\n    express his gratitude. I hope you will again accept my services\r\n    whenever they can be of any use to Beethoven. I am, etc.\r\n\r\nIn a letter, dated March 24, Schindler wrote to Moscheles:\r\n\r\n    I much regret that you did not express more decidedly in your\r\n    letter the wish that he should draw the 100 pounds by installments,\r\n    and I agreed with Rau to recommend this course, but he (Beethoven)\r\n    preferred acting on the last part of your letter. Care and anxiety\r\n    seemed at once to vanish when he had received the money, and he\r\n    said to me quite happily, “Now we can again look forward to some\r\n    comfortable days.” We had only 340 florins, W. W. remaining and\r\n    we had been obliged to be very economical for some time in our\r\n    housekeeping.... His delight on receiving this gift from the\r\n    Philharmonic Society resembled that of a child. A letter from that\r\n    worthy man Stumpff arrived here two days before yours and all this\r\n    affected Beethoven very much. Numberless times during the day he\r\n    exclaimed. “May God reward them a thousandfold.”\r\n\r\nOn March 28 Rau wrote again to Moscheles:\r\n\r\n    Beethoven is no more; he died on the 26th inst. at five o’clock\r\n    in the afternoon, in the most dreadful agonies of pain. He was,\r\n    as I mentioned to you in my last letter, according to his own\r\n    statement, without any relief, without any money, consequently in\r\n    the most painful circumstances; but on taking an inventory of his\r\n    property after his death, at which I was present, we found in an\r\n    old half-mouldy chest, seven Austrian bank bills which amount to\r\n    about 1,000 pounds. Whether Beethoven concealed these purposely,\r\n    for he was very mistrusting, and hoped for a speedy recovery,\r\n    or whether he was himself ignorant of his possession, remains a\r\n    riddle. We found the whole of the 100 pounds which the Philharmonic\r\n    Society sent him, and I reclaimed them according to your former\r\n    orders.[172] but was compelled to deposit them with the magistrate\r\n    until a further communication from that Society arrives. I could,\r\n    of course, not permit the expenses of the burial to be paid out of\r\n    this money without the consent of the Society. Beethoven’s nephew\r\n    now succeeds to all his property. I hope to hear from you soon and\r\n    explicitly what I am to do, and you may rest perfectly assured of\r\n    my promptness and exactitude.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MOSCHELES REPORTS TO LONDON]\r\n\r\nMoscheles, “by return post,” as he assures Mr. Watts, asked Rau to send\r\nthe £100 back to the Philharmonic Society “according to the conditions\r\nunder which the money was sent.” A correspondence ensued between\r\nMoscheles and Hotschevar, who was appointed guardian of the nephew\r\nafter Breuning’s death (on June 4, 1827), which ended in Moscheles’ (as\r\nhe himself says) laying before the Philharmonic Society the case of\r\nyoung Beethoven (then under age) and soliciting them “not to reclaim\r\nthe £100, but, in honor of the great deceased, to allow the small\r\npatrimony to remain untouched.” Meanwhile it appears from a letter from\r\nSchindler to Smart dated March 31,[173] that Schindler and Breuning\r\napplied a portion of the sum to the payment of the funeral expenses;\r\n“otherwise,” says the letter, “we could not have had him decently\r\nburied without selling one of the seven bank-shares which constitute\r\nhis entire estate.” The sum thus expended is shown to have been 650\r\nflorins C. M. by the inventory preserved by Fischoff.\r\n\r\nThere are evidences outside of the importunate letters to London that\r\nBeethoven had frequent spells of melancholy during the period between\r\nthe crises of his disease, which culminated in the third operation on\r\nFebruary 2,[174] and the fourth. Some of them were, no doubt, due to\r\nforebodings touching the outcome of his illness; some to the anxiety\r\nwhich his financial condition gave him (more imaginary than real in\r\nview of the easily convertible bank-shares), and some presumably to\r\ndisappointment and chagrin at the conduct of his nephew, who had not\r\nanswered his letter to Iglau. Breuning explained that the negligence\r\nmight be due to Karl’s time and attention being engrossed by the\r\ncarnival gayeties at the military post, and warned Beethoven that\r\nto give way to melancholy was to stand in the way of recovery. We\r\nlearn this from the Conversation Books, which also give glimpses of\r\nfriendly visits calculated to divert the sick man’s mind and keep\r\nhim in touch with the affairs of the city, theatre and the world at\r\nlarge. Doležalek, Schuppanzigh, and apparently Linke also, came in a\r\ngroup; Beethoven showed them the Handel scores and the conversation\r\nran out into a discussion of international politics. Moritz Lichnowsky\r\nmade a call and entertained him with the gossip of the theatres.\r\nGleichenstein made several visits, and once brought with him his\r\nwife and son. The Countess was a sister of Therese Malfatti, to whom\r\nBeethoven had once made an offer of marriage, and was disappointed\r\nwhen Beethoven did not recognize her. About the middle of February\r\nDiabelli gave Beethoven a print-picture of Haydn’s birthplace, which\r\nhe had published; Beethoven showed it to his little friend Gerhard von\r\nBreuning and said: “Look, I got this to-day. See this little house, and\r\nin it so great a man was born!”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FRIENDS AROUND THE DEATH-BED]\r\n\r\nOn February 25 Holz is called by letter to look after the collection\r\nof Beethoven’s annuity. His visits have been infrequent, but evidently\r\nthere are some things which Beethoven either cannot or will not\r\nentrust to anybody else. Schindler is ceaselessly and tirelessly busy\r\nwith Beethoven’s affairs, but his statement that Breuning and he were\r\nthe only persons who were much with the composer during his illness,\r\nexcept the lad, Gerhard von Breuning, must be taken with some grains\r\nof allowance. On 123 pages of the Conversation Books, covering the\r\nmonths of January and February, 1827 (the evidence of which can not be\r\ngainsaid, since the books were long in the hand of Schindler to do with\r\nas he willed), there are forty-eight entries by Johann van Beethoven,\r\nforty-six by Gerhard von Breuning and thirty by Breuning the elder.\r\nSchindler’s entries number 103. Other writers in the Books are Bernhard\r\n(1), Holz (7), Bach (2), Piringer (6), Haslinger (11), Schikh (1),\r\nDoležalek (4), Schuppanzigh (6), Moritz Lichnowsky (1), Gleichenstein\r\n(1), Jekel (1), Marie Schindler, Anton’s sister (1) and Wolfmayer (1).\r\n\r\nSometime in February--it was probably at the time when Beethoven’s\r\nmind was so fixedly bent on obtaining help from London--Schindler was\r\neither ill or suffering from an accident which kept him for a brief\r\nspace from Beethoven’s bedside. The composer sent him a gift--a repast,\r\nevidently--and a letter of sympathy so disjointed in phrase as to give\r\npitiful confirmation of Schindler’s statement that it was the last\r\nletter which Beethoven wrote with his own hand, and that at the time he\r\ncould no longer think connectedly. It ran:\r\n\r\n    Concerning your accident, since it has happened, as soon as we see\r\n    each other I can send to you somebody without inconvenience--accept\r\n    this--here is something--Moscheles, Cramer--without your having\r\n    received a letter--There will be a new occasion to write one\r\n    Wednesday and lay my affairs to his heart, if you are not well by\r\n    that time one of my--can take it to the post against a receipt.\r\n    _Vale et fave_, there is no need of my assuring you of my sympathy\r\n    in your accident--do take the meal from me, it is given with all my\r\n    heart--Heaven be with you.\r\n\r\nMore pathetic than even this letter is the picture of the sufferer\r\nin his sick-room at the time of the fourth operation (February 27).\r\nSo wretched are his surroundings that it is scarcely impossible\r\nto avoid the conviction that not poverty alone but ignorance and\r\ncarelessness were contributary to the woeful lack of ordinary sick-room\r\nconveniences. Gerhard von Breuning says that after the operation\r\nthe fluid which was drained from the patient’s body flowed half-way\r\nacross the floor to the middle of the room; and in the C. B. there is\r\na mention of saturated bedclothing and the physician suggests that\r\noilcloth be procured and spread over the couch. Beethoven now gave\r\nup hope. Dr. Wawruch says: “No words of comfort could brace him up,\r\nand when I promised him alleviation of his sufferings with the coming\r\nof the vitalizing weather of Spring he answered with a smile: ‘My\r\nday’s work is finished. If there were a physician could help me his\r\nname should be called Wonderful.’ This pathetic allusion to Handel’s\r\n‘Messiah’ touched me so deeply that I had to confess its correctness\r\nto myself with profound emotion.” The incident so sympathetically\r\ndescribed bears evidence of veracity on its face; Handel’s scores were\r\nalways in Beethoven’s mind during the last weeks of his life.\r\n\r\nAmong Beethoven’s visitors in February was Wolfmayer, whose coming must\r\nhave called up a sense of a long-standing obligation and purpose in\r\nthe composer’s mind.[175] On February 22nd he dictated a letter to the\r\nSchotts asking that the Quartet in C-sharp minor be dedicated to “my\r\nfriend Johann Nepomuk Wolfmayer.” The letter then proceeds:\r\n\r\n    Now, however, I come with a very important request.--My doctor\r\n    orders me to drink very good old Rhinewine. To get a thing of that\r\n    kind unadulterated is not possible at any price. If, therefore, I\r\n    were to receive a few small bottles I would show my gratitude to\r\n    you in the Cæcilia. I think something would be done for me at the\r\n    customs so that the transport would not cost too much. As soon as\r\n    my strength allows you shall receive the metronomic marks for the\r\n    Mass, for I am just in the period when the fourth operation is\r\n    about to be performed. The sooner, therefore, that I receive the\r\n    Rhinewine, or Moselle, the more beneficial it may be to me in my\r\n    present condition; and I beg of you most heartily to do me this\r\n    favor for which I shall be under an obligation of gratitude to you.\r\n\r\nOn March 1st he repeated his request:\r\n\r\n    I am under the necessity of becoming burdensome to you again,\r\n    inasmuch as I am sending you a packet for the Royal Government\r\n    Councillor Wegeler at Coblenz, which you will have the kindness to\r\n    transmit from Mayence to Coblenz. You know without more ado that I\r\n    am too unselfish to ask you to do all these things gratuitously.\r\n\r\n    I repeat my former request, that, namely, concerning old white\r\n    Rhinewine or Moselle. It is infinitely difficult to get any here\r\n    which is genuine and unadulterated, even at the highest price. A\r\n    few days ago, on February 27, I had my fourth operation, and yet I\r\n    am unable to look forward to my complete recovery and restoration.\r\n    Pity your devoted friend\r\n\r\n  Beethoven.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: WINE AND DELICACIES FOR THE SUFFERER]\r\n\r\nOn March 8 the Schotts answered that they had forwarded a case of\r\ntwelve bottles of Rüdesheimer Berg of the vintage of 1806, _via_\r\nFrankfort, but in order that he might the sooner receive a slight\r\nrefreshment, they had sent that day four bottles of the same wine, two\r\npure and two mixed with herbs, to be used as a medicine which had been\r\nprescribed for his disease. The prescription had come, they said, from\r\na friend who had cured many persons of dropsy with it. Before the wine\r\nreached Vienna, on March 10, Beethoven wrote again to the Schotts:\r\n\r\n    According to my letter the Quartet was to be dedicated to one\r\n    whose name I have already sent to you. Since then there has been\r\n    an occurrence which has led me to make a change in this. It must\r\n    be dedicated to Lieut.-Fieldmarshal von Stutterheim to whom I am\r\n    deeply indebted. If you have already engraved the first dedication\r\n    I beg of you, by everything in this world, to change it and I\r\n    will gladly pay the cost. Do not accept this as an empty promise;\r\n    I attach so much importance to it that I am ready to make any\r\n    compensation for it. I enclose the title. As regards the shipment\r\n    to my friend, the Royal Prussian Government Councillor v. Wegeler\r\n    in Coblenz, I am glad to be able to relieve you wholly. Another\r\n    opportunity has offered itself. My health, which will not be\r\n    restored for a long time, pleads for the wines which I have asked\r\n    for and which will certainly bring me refreshment, strength and\r\n    health.\r\n\r\nThere are evidences that the wine was received on March 24. On March\r\n29 the Schotts, under the impression that Beethoven was still alive,\r\nwrote him again. Baron Pasqualati, in whose house he had lived for a\r\nlong time, an old friend, joined his new friends, the publishers, in\r\nan effort to contribute to his physical comfort and well-being. There\r\nare several little letters in which Beethoven acknowledges the receipt\r\nof contributions from his cellar and larder. One of these, most likely\r\nthe first, has been endorsed by a strange hand as having been sent or\r\nreceived on March 6. It reads:\r\n\r\n    Hearty thanks for your health-gift; as soon as I have found out\r\n    which of the wines is the most suitable I will let you know, but I\r\n    shall abuse your kindness as little as possible. I am rejoicing\r\n    in the expectation of the compotes and will appeal to you often\r\n    for them. Even this costs me an exertion. _Sapienta pauca_--Your\r\n    grateful friend\r\n\r\n  Beethoven.\r\n\r\nAnd a little while afterwards he writes:\r\n\r\n    I beg you again to-day for a cherry compote, but without lemons,\r\n    entirely simple; also I should be glad to have a light pudding,\r\n    almost a suggestion of a gruel--my good cook is not yet adept in\r\n    food for the sick. I am allowed to drink _champagne_, but for\r\n    the time being I beg you to send a champagne glass with it. Now\r\n    as regards the wine: At first Malfatti wanted only Moselle; but\r\n    he asserted that there was none genuine to be obtained here; he\r\n    therefore himself gave me several bottles of Krumpholz-Kirchner and\r\n    claims that this is the best for my health, since no Moselle is to\r\n    be had. Pardon me for being a burden and ascribe it to my helpless\r\n    condition.\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n    How shall I thank you enough for the glorious champagne? How\r\n    greatly has it refreshed me and will continue to do so! I need\r\n    nothing to-day and thank you for everything--whatever conclusions\r\n    you may draw in regard to the wines I beg of you to note that I\r\n    would gladly recompense you to the extent of my ability.--I can\r\n    write no more to-day. Heaven bless you for everything and for your\r\n    affectionate sympathy.\r\n\r\nStill another:\r\n\r\n    Many thanks for the food of yesterday, which will also serve\r\n    for to-day.--I am allowed to eat game; the doctor thinks that\r\n    _Krametsvögel_ (Fieldfares) are good and wholesome for me. This for\r\n    your information, but it need not be to-day. Pardon my senseless\r\n    writing--Weary of night vigils--I embrace and reverence you.\r\n\r\nAnd finally this, presumably last, letter:\r\n\r\n    My thanks for the food sent yesterday. A sick man longs for\r\n    such things like a child and therefore I beg you to-day for the\r\n    peach compote. As regards other food I must get the advice of\r\n    the physicians. Concerning the wine they consider the Grinzinger\r\n    beneficial but prefer old Krumpholz Kirchener over all others.--I\r\n    hope this statement will not cause you to misunderstand me.\r\n\r\nOthers who sent him gifts of wine were Streicher and Breuning, and, as\r\nwe see from one of the letters, Malfatti himself. There is considerable\r\ntalk in the C. B. about wine. His days were numbered--why should any\r\ncomfort be denied him?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE REPUTED VISIT BY SCHUBERT]\r\n\r\nConcerning the last few days of his life the Conversation Books provide\r\nabsolutely no information. There is no record of the visit of Schubert\r\nto the bedside of the dying man, but the account given by Schindler is\r\nprobably correct in the main. On page 136 of the second volume of his\r\nbiography of Beethoven, Schindler says:\r\n\r\n    As only a few of Franz Schubert’s compositions were known to him\r\n    and obsequious persons had always been busily engaged in throwing\r\n    suspicion on his talent, I took advantage of the favorable moment\r\n    to place before him several of the greater songs, such as “Die\r\n    junge Nonne,” “Die Bürgschaft,” “Der Taucher,” “Elysium” and the\r\n    Ossianic songs, acquaintance with which gave the master great\r\n    pleasure; so much, indeed, that he spoke his judgment in these\r\n    words: “Truly, the divine spark lives in Schubert,” and so forth.\r\n    At the time, however, only a small number of Schubert’s works had\r\n    appeared in print.\r\n\r\nHere no date is fixed for the incident and a little suspicion was cast\r\nupon the story because of the fact that only “Die junge Nonne” of all\r\nthe songs mentioned had been published at the time of Beethoven’s\r\ndeath. Schindler helped himself measurably out of the dilemma by saying\r\nin an article published in the “Theaterzeitung” of May 3, 1831, that\r\nmany of the songs which he laid before Beethoven were in manuscript. He\r\ncontradicts his statement made in the biography, however, by saying:\r\n“What would the great master have said had he seen, for instance\r\nthe Ossianic songs, ‘Die Bürgschaft,’ ‘Elysium,’ ‘Der Taucher’ and\r\nother great ones which have only recently been published?” As usual,\r\nSchindler becomes more explicit when he comes to explain one of his\r\nutterances. Now he says:\r\n\r\n    As the illness to which Beethoven finally succumbed after four\r\n    months of suffering from the beginning made his ordinary mental\r\n    activity impossible, a diversion had to be thought of which would\r\n    fit his mind and inclinations. And so it came about that I placed\r\n    before him a collection of Schubert’s songs, about 60 in number,\r\n    among them many which were then still in manuscript. This was done\r\n    not only to provide him with a pleasant entertainment, but also\r\n    to give him an opportunity to get acquainted with Schubert in his\r\n    essence in order to get from him a favorable opinion of Schubert’s\r\n    talent, which had been impugned, as had that of others by some of\r\n    the exalted ones. The great master, who before then had not known\r\n    five songs of Schubert’s, was amazed at their number and refused\r\n    to believe that up to that time (February, 1827) he had already\r\n    composed over 500 of them. But if he was astonished at the number\r\n    he was filled with the highest admiration as soon as he discovered\r\n    their contents. For several days he could not separate himself from\r\n    them, and every day he spent hours with Iphigenia’s monologue,\r\n    “Die Grenzen der Menschheit,” “Die Allmacht,” “Die junge Nonne,”\r\n    “Viola,” the “Müllerlieder,” and others. With joyous enthusiasm he\r\n    cried out repeatedly: “Truly, a divine spark dwells in Schubert;\r\n    if I had had this poem I would have set it to music”; this in the\r\n    case of the majority of poems whose material contents and original\r\n    treatment by Schubert he could not praise sufficiently. Nor could\r\n    he understand how Schubert had time to “take in hand such long\r\n    poems, many of which contained ten others,” as he expressed it....\r\n    What would the master have said had he seen, for instance, the\r\n    Ossianic songs, “Die Bürgschaft,” “Elysium,” “Der Taucher” and\r\n    other great ones which have only recently been published? In short,\r\n    the respect which Beethoven acquired for Schubert’s talent was so\r\n    great that he now wanted to see his operas and pianoforte pieces;\r\n    but his illness had now become so severe that he could no longer\r\n    gratify this wish. But he often spoke of Schubert and predicted of\r\n    him that he “would make a great sensation in the world,” and often\r\n    regretted that he had not learned to know him earlier.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that the remark, “Truly, the divine spark dwells in\r\nSchubert,” as Schindler quoted it in his biography, came more than\r\nonce from Beethoven’s lips. Luib heard Hüttenbrenner say that one day\r\nBeethoven said of Schubert, “He has the divine spark!” Schindler’s\r\narticle in the “Theaterzeitung” was a defense of the opinion which he\r\nhad expressed that Schubert was a greater song-composer than Beethoven,\r\nand for this reason it may be assumed that it was a little high-pitched\r\nin expression. Beethoven knew a little about Schubert, but not much, as\r\nappears from a remark quoted from Holz in one of the Conversation Books\r\nof 1826. It may have been Schindler’s ambition to appear as having\r\nstood sponsor for Schubert before Beethoven which led him to ignore\r\nHolz’s remark concerning Schubert’s unique genius as a writer of songs,\r\nhis interest in Handel and his patronage of Schuppanzigh’s quartet\r\nparties. Beethoven and Schubert had met. Anselm Hüttenbrenner wrote to\r\nLuib:[176]\r\n\r\n    But this I know positively, that about eight days before\r\n    Beethoven’s death Prof. Schindler, Schubert and I visited the sick\r\n    man, Schindler announced us two and asked Beethoven whom he would\r\n    see first. He said: “Let Schubert come first.”\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of Schindler that he makes no mention of this\r\nincident. Another incident recorded by Gerhard von Breuning deserves\r\nto be told here. When Beethoven’s friends called they usually reported\r\nto Beethoven about the performances of his works. One day Gerhard von\r\nBreuning found that a visitor had written in the Conversation Book:\r\n“Your Quartet which Schuppanzigh played yesterday did not please.”\r\nBeethoven was asleep when Gerhard came and when he awoke the lad\r\npointed to the entry. Beethoven remarked, laconically: “It will please\r\nthem some day,” adding that he wrote only as he thought best and would\r\nnot permit himself to be deceived by the judgment of the day, saying at\r\nthe end: “I know that I am an artist.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: FERDINAND HILLER’S LAST VISIT]\r\n\r\nIn a letter which Schindler wrote to Moscheles, forwarding Beethoven’s,\r\nhe said: “Hummel and his wife are here; he came in haste to see\r\nBeethoven once again alive, for it is generally reported in Germany\r\nthat he is on his deathbed. It was a most touching sight last Thursday\r\nto see these two friends meet again.” The letter was written on March\r\n14 and the “last Thursday” was March 8th. We have an account of this\r\nmeeting in Ferdinand Hiller’s “Aus dem Tonleben unserer Zeit.”[177]\r\nHiller was then fifteen years old and had come to the Austrian Capital\r\nwith Hummel, who was his teacher. Hummel had heard in Weimar that\r\nBeethoven was hopelessly ill and had reached Vienna on March 6; two\r\ndays later he visited his dying friend. Hiller writes:\r\n\r\n    Through a spacious anteroom in which high cabinets were piled\r\n    with thick, tied-up parcels of music we reached--how my heart\r\n    beat!--Beethoven’s living-room, and were not a little astonished\r\n    to find the master sitting in apparent comfort at the window. He\r\n    wore a long, gray sleeping-robe, open at the time, and high boots\r\n    reaching to his knees. Emaciated by long and severe illness he\r\n    seemed to me, when he arose, of tall stature; he was unshaven,\r\n    his thick, half-gray hair fell in disorder over his temples. The\r\n    expression of his features heightened when he caught sight of\r\n    Hummel, and he seemed to be extraordinarily glad to meet him. The\r\n    two men embraced each other most cordially. Hummel introduced\r\n    me. Beethoven showed himself extremely kind and I was permitted\r\n    to sit opposite him at the window. It is known that conversation\r\n    with Beethoven was carried on in part in writing; he spoke, but\r\n    those with whom he conversed had to write their questions and\r\n    answers. For this purpose thick sheets of ordinary writing-paper\r\n    in quarto form and lead-pencils always lay near him. How painful\r\n    it must have been for the animated, easily impatient man to be\r\n    obliged to wait for every answer, to make a pause in every moment\r\n    of conversation, during which, as it were, thought was condemned\r\n    to come to a standstill! He always followed the hand of the\r\n    writer with hungry eyes and comprehended what was written at a\r\n    glance instead of reading it. The liveliness of the conversation\r\n    naturally interfered with the continual writing of the visitor. I\r\n    can scarcely blame myself, much as I regret it, for not taking down\r\n    more extended notes than I did; indeed, I rejoice that a lad of\r\n    fifteen years who found himself in a great city for the first time,\r\n    was self-possessed enough to regard any details. I can vouch with\r\n    the best conscience for the perfect accuracy of all that I am able\r\n    to repeat.\r\n\r\n    The conversation at first turned, as is usual, on domestic\r\n    affair,--the journey and sojourn, my relations with Hummel and\r\n    matters of that kind. Beethoven asked about Goethe’s health with\r\n    extraordinary solicitude and we were able to make the best of\r\n    reports, since only a few days before the great poet had written\r\n    in my album. Concerning his own state, poor Beethoven complained\r\n    much. “Here I have been lying for four months,” he cried out,\r\n    “one must at last lose patience!” Other things in Vienna did not\r\n    seem to be to his liking and he spoke with the utmost severity\r\n    of “the present taste in art,” and “the dilettantism which is\r\n    ruining everything.” Nor did he spare the government, up to the\r\n    most exalted regions. “Write a volume of penitential hymns and\r\n    dedicate it to the Empress,” he remarked with a gloomy smile to\r\n    Hummel, who, however, made no use of the well-meant advice. Hummel,\r\n    who was a practical man, took advantage of Beethoven’s condition\r\n    to ask his attention to a matter which occupied a long time. It\r\n    was about the theft of one of Hummel’s concertos, which had been\r\n    printed illicitly before it had been brought out by the lawful\r\n    publisher. Hummel wanted to appeal to the Bundestag against this\r\n    wretched business, and to this end desired to have Beethoven’s\r\n    signature, which seemed to him of great value. He sat down to\r\n    explain the matter in writing and meanwhile I was permitted to\r\n    carry on the conversation with Beethoven. I did my best, and the\r\n    master continued to give free rein to his moody and passionate\r\n    utterances in the most confidential manner. In part they referred\r\n    to his nephew, whom he had loved greatly, who, as is known, caused\r\n    him much trouble and at that time, because of a few trifles (thus\r\n    Beethoven at least seemed to consider them), had gotten into\r\n    trouble with the officials. “Little thieves are hanged, but big\r\n    ones are allowed to go free!” he exclaimed ill-humoredly. He\r\n    asked about my studies and, encouraging me, said: “Art must be\r\n    propagated ceaselessly,” and when I spoke of the exclusive interest\r\n    in Italian opera which then prevailed in Vienna, he gave utterance\r\n    to the memorable words: “It is said _vox populi, vox dei_. I never\r\n    believed it.”\r\n\r\n    On March 13 Hummel took me with him a second time to Beethoven. We\r\n    found his condition to be materially worse. He lay in bed, seemed\r\n    to suffer great pains, and at intervals groaned deeply despite the\r\n    fact that he spoke much and animatedly. Now he seemed to take it\r\n    much to heart that he had not married. Already at our first visit\r\n    he had joked about it with Hummel, whose wife he had known as a\r\n    young and beautiful maiden. “You are a lucky man,” he said to him\r\n    now smilingly, “you have a wife who takes care of you, who is in\r\n    love with you--but poor me!” and he sighed heavily. He also begged\r\n    of Hummel to bring his wife to see him, she not having been able\r\n    to persuade herself to see in his present state the man whom she\r\n    had known at the zenith of his powers. A short time before he had\r\n    received a present of a picture of the house in which Haydn was\r\n    born. He kept it close at hand and showed it to us. “It gave me a\r\n    childish pleasure,” he said, “the cradle of so great a man!” Then\r\n    he appealed to Hummel in behalf of Schindler, of whom so much was\r\n    spoken afterwards. “He is a good man,” he said, “who has taken a\r\n    great deal of trouble on my account. He is to give a concert soon\r\n    at which I promised my coöperation. But now nothing is likely\r\n    to come of that. Now I should like to have you do me the favor\r\n    of playing. We must always help poor artists.” As a matter of\r\n    course, Hummel consented. The concert took place--ten days after\r\n    Beethoven’s death--in the Josephstadt-Theater. Hummel improvised\r\n    in an obviously exalted mood on the Allegretto of the A major\r\n    Symphony; the public knew why he participated and the performance\r\n    and its reception formed a truly inspiring incident.\r\n\r\n    Shortly after our second visit the report spread throughout Vienna\r\n    that the Philharmonic Society of London had sent Beethoven £100\r\n    in order to ease his sick-bed. It was added that this surprise\r\n    had made so great an impression on the great poor man that it had\r\n    also brought physical relief. When we stood again at his bedside,\r\n    on the 20th, we could educe from his utterances how greatly he had\r\n    been rejoiced by this altruism; but he was very weak and spoke\r\n    only in faint and disconnected phrases. “I shall, no doubt, soon\r\n    be going above,” he whispered after our first greeting. Similar\r\n    remarks recurred frequently. In the intervals, however, he spoke of\r\n    projects and hopes which were destined not to be realized. Speaking\r\n    of the noble conduct of the Philharmonic Society and in praise of\r\n    the English people, he expressed the intention, as soon as matters\r\n    were better with him, to undertake the journey to London. “I will\r\n    compose a grand overture for them and a grand symphony.” Then, too,\r\n    he would visit Madame Hummel (she had come along with her husband)\r\n    and go to I do not know how many places. It did not occur to us to\r\n    write anything for him. His eyes, which were still lively when we\r\n    saw him last, dropped and closed to-day and it was difficult from\r\n    time to time for him to raise himself. It was no longer possible to\r\n    deceive one’s self--the worst was to be feared.\r\n\r\n    Hopeless was the picture presented by the extraordinary man when\r\n    we sought him again on March 23rd. It was to be the last time. He\r\n    lay, weak and miserable, sighing deeply at intervals. Not a word\r\n    fell from his lips; sweat stood upon his forehead. His handkerchief\r\n    not being conveniently at hand, Hummel’s wife took her fine cambric\r\n    handkerchief and dried his face several times. Never shall I forget\r\n    the grateful glance with which his broken eye looked upon her. On\r\n    March 26, while we were with a merry company in the art-loving\r\n    house of Herr von Liebenberg (who had formerly been a pupil of\r\n    Hummel’s), we were surprised by a severe storm between five and\r\n    six o’clock. A thick snow-flurry was accompanied by loud peals of\r\n    thunder and flashes of lightning, which lighted up the room. A few\r\n    hours later guests arrived with the intelligence that Ludwig van\r\n    Beethoven was no more;--he had died at 4:45 o’clock.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE SIGNING OF THE WILL]\r\n\r\nThe consultations between Beethoven and his legal advisers, Bach,\r\nBreuning and others, concerning the proper disposition of his estate\r\nby will, which had begun soon after Karl’s departure for Iglau, had\r\nnot been brought to a conclusion when it became apparent to all that\r\nit was high time that the document formally be executed. Dr. Bach does\r\nnot seem to have been consulted at this crisis; haste was necessary,\r\nand on March 23 von Breuning made a draft of a will which, free from\r\nunnecessary verbiage, set forth the wishes of the testator in three\r\nlines of writing. Beethoven had protested against the proposition of\r\nhis friends that provision be made that Karl should not be able to\r\ndissipate the capital or surrender any portion of it to his mother. To\r\nthis end a trust was to be created and he was to have the income during\r\nlife, the reversion being to his legitimate heirs. With this Beethoven\r\nat length declared himself satisfied; but when Breuning placed the\r\ndraft before the dying man, who had yielded unwillingly, he copied\r\nit laboriously but substituted the word “natural” for “legitimate.”\r\nSchindler says the copying was a labor, and when Beethoven finished it\r\nand appended his signature he said: “There; now I’ll write no more.”\r\nBreuning called his attention to the fact that controversy would ensue\r\nfrom his change in the text, but Beethoven insisted that the words\r\nmeant the same thing and there should be no change. “This,” says\r\nSchindler, “was his last contradiction.” Hiller’s description of the\r\nlast visit of Hummel, pictures the condition of the dying man on this\r\nday, and Schindler’s statement that it was laborious for Beethoven to\r\ncopy even the few words of the will is pathetically verified by the\r\northography of the document which, _verb. et lit._, is as follows:\r\n\r\n    Mein Neffe Karl Soll alleiniger Erbe seyn, das Kapital meines\r\n    Nachlasses soll jedoch Seinen natürlichen oder testamentarischen\r\n    Erben zufallen.\r\n\r\n  Wien am 23 März 1827.\r\n  Ludwig van Beethoven mp.\r\n\r\nAccording to Gerhard von Breuning, signatures were necessary to\r\nseveral documents--the will, the transfer of the guardianship of the\r\nnephew to von Breuning and the letter of January 3, which also made a\r\ntestamentary disposition of Beethoven’s property. These signatures were\r\nall obtained with great difficulty. The younger von Breuning places\r\nthe date on March 24th. After von Breuning, Schindler and the dying\r\nman’s brother had indicated to Beethoven, who lay in a half-stupor,\r\nthat his signature was required they raised him as much as possible and\r\npushed pillows under him for support. Then the documents, one after the\r\nother, were laid before him and von Breuning put the inked pen in his\r\nhand. “The dying man, who ordinarily wrote boldly in a lapidary style,\r\nrepeatedly signed his immortal name, laboriously, with trembling hand,\r\nfor the last time; still legibly, indeed, but each time forgetting one\r\nof the middle letters--once an _h_, another time an_e_.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “COMŒDIA FINITA EST.”]\r\n\r\nOn the day which saw the signing of the will, Beethoven made an\r\nutterance, eminently characteristic of him, but which, because of an\r\ninterpretation which it has received, has caused no small amount of\r\ncomment. The date is fixed as March 23rd by Schindler’s letter to\r\nMoscheles of March 24th in which he says: “Yesterday he said to me and\r\nBreuning, ‘Plaudite, amici, comœdia finita est’.” Though the phrase\r\ndoes not seem to be a literal quotation from any author known to have\r\nbeen familiar to Beethoven, it is obviously a paraphrase of something\r\nwhich he had read. According to Schindler and Gerhard von Breuning\r\nthe words were uttered in a tone of sarcastic humor. Schindler and\r\nDr. Wawruch (though the latter was not present) agree in saying that\r\nhe made the speech after receiving the viaticum, and it is this\r\ncircumstance, coupled with the deduction that the dying man referred to\r\nthe sacred function just performed, which greatly disturbed the minds\r\nof some of his devout admirers. It needed not have done so; the phrase\r\nis almost a literary commonplace and its significance has never been in\r\nquestion.[178]\r\n\r\nWhen Beethoven’s friends saw the end approaching, they were naturally\r\ndesirous that he receive the spiritual comfort which the offices of the\r\nRoman Catholic church offer to the dying and it was equally natural\r\nthat Beethoven, brought up as a child of the church though careless of\r\nhis duties toward it, should, at the last, be ready to accept them.\r\nJohann van Beethoven relates that a few days after the 16th of March,\r\nwhen the physicians gave him up for lost, he had begged his brother to\r\nmake his peace with God, to which request he acceded “with the greatest\r\nreadiness.” Confirmation of this is found in Dr. Wawruch’s report.\r\nWawruch, it will be remembered, had, at the beginning of his studies,\r\nintended to enter the priesthood. At the crisis described by Johann he\r\nsays he called Beethoven’s attention to his impending dissolution “so\r\nthat he might do his duty as a citizen and to religion.” He continues:\r\n\r\n    With the greatest delicacy I wrote the words of admonition on a\r\n    sheet of paper.... Beethoven read the writing with unexampled\r\n    composure, slowly and thoughtfully, his countenance like that of\r\n    one transfigured; cordially and solemnly he held out his hand to\r\n    me and said: “Have the priest called.” Then he lay quietly lost in\r\n    thought and amiably indicated by a nod his “I shall soon see you\r\n    again.” Soon thereafter Beethoven performed his devotions with a\r\n    pious resignation which looked confidently into eternity and turned\r\n    to the friends around him with the words, “Plaudite, amici, finita\r\n    est comœdia!”\r\n\r\nWawruch was not present at the time when the words were spoken.\r\nSchindler’s account, in a letter to the “Cäcilia” dated April 12, 1827,\r\nand printed in that journal in May, is as follows:\r\n\r\n    On the day before (the 23rd) there remained with us only one\r\n    ardent wish--to reconcile him with heaven and to show the world\r\n    at the same time that he had ended his life a true Christian. The\r\n    Professor in Ordinary [Wawruch] therefore wrote and begged him\r\n    in the name of all his friends to receive the holy sacrament; to\r\n    which he replied quietly and firmly (_gefasst_), “I wish it.” The\r\n    physician went away and left us to care for it.\r\n\r\nSchindler describes the administration of the sacrament, which\r\nBeethoven received with edification, and adds that now for the first\r\ntime he seemed to believe that he was about to die; for “scarcely\r\nhad the priest left the room before he said to me and young von\r\nBreuning, ‘Plaudite, amici, comœdia finita est. Did I not always\r\nsay that it would end thus?’” (“_Habe ich nicht immer gesagt, dass\r\nes so kommen wird?_”) Here there is agreement with Wawruch, but, to\r\nGerhard von Breuning, Schindler said that Beethoven made the remark at\r\nthe conclusion of a long consultation after the physicians had gone\r\naway; and this is confirmed by Gerhard von Breuning. In 1860 Anselm\r\nHüttenbrenner wrote:[179]\r\n\r\n    It is not true, as has been reported, that I begged Beethoven to\r\n    receive the sacrament for the dying; but I did bring it about at\r\n    the request of the wife of the music-publisher Tobias Haslinger,\r\n    now deceased, that Beethoven was asked in the gentlest manner by\r\n    Herr Johann Baptist Jenger and Madame van Beethoven, wife of the\r\n    landowner, to strengthen himself by receiving holy communion. It\r\n    is a pure invention that Beethoven spoke the words “Plaudite,\r\n    amici! Comœdia finita est!” to me, for I was not present when\r\n    the rite was administered in the forenoon of March 24, 1827. And\r\n    surely Beethoven did not make to others an utterance so completely\r\n    at variance with his sturdy character. But on the day of her\r\n    brother-in-law’s death Frau v. Beethoven told me that after\r\n    receiving the viaticum he said to the priest, “I thank you, ghostly\r\n    sir! You have brought me comfort!”\r\n\r\nHüttenbrenner is confirmed by Johann van Beethoven, who wrote in his\r\nbrief review of his brother’s last illness that when the priest was\r\nleaving the room Beethoven said to him, “I thank you for this last\r\nservice.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: INCIDENTS OF THE FINAL STRUGGLE]\r\n\r\n\r\nBeethoven received the viaticum in the presence of Schindler, von\r\nBreuning, Jenger and the wife of his brother Johann. After the priest\r\nhad taken his departure he reminded his friends of the necessity of\r\nsending a document ceding the proprietary rights of the C-sharp minor\r\nQuartet to the Schotts. It was drawn up and his signature to it, the\r\nlast which he wrote, was attested by Schindler and Breuning. He also\r\nspoke of a letter of thanks to the Philharmonic Society of London and\r\nin suggesting its tenor, comprehended the whole English people with a\r\nfervent “God bless them!” About one o’clock the special shipment of\r\nwine and wine mixed with herbs came from Mayence, and Schindler placed\r\nthe bottles upon the table near the bed. Beethoven looked at them and\r\nmurmured, “Pity, pity--too late!” He spoke no more. A little of the\r\nwine was administered to him in spoonfuls at intervals, as long as\r\nhe could swallow it. Towards evening he lost consciousness and the\r\ndeath-struggle began. It lasted two days. “From towards the evening of\r\nthe 24th to his last breath he was almost continually _in delirio_,”\r\nwrote Schindler to Moscheles. We have a description from Gerhard von\r\nBreuning:[180]\r\n\r\n    During the next day and the day following the strong man lay\r\n    completely unconscious, in the process of dissolution, breathing\r\n    so stertorously that the rattle could be heard at a distance. His\r\n    powerful frame, his unweakened lungs, fought like giants with\r\n    approaching death. The spectacle was a fearful one. Although it\r\n    was known that the poor man suffered no more it was yet appalling\r\n    to observe that the noble being, now irredeemably a prey to the\r\n    powers of dissolution, was beyond all mental communication.\r\n    It was expected as early as the 25th that he would pass away\r\n    in the following night; yet we found him still alive on the\r\n    26th--breathing, if that was possible, more stertorously than on\r\n    the day before.\r\n\r\nThe only witnesses of Beethoven’s death were his sister-in-law and\r\nAnselm Hüttenbrenner. From the latter we have a description of the last\r\nscene.[181]\r\n\r\n    When I entered Beethoven’s bedroom on March 26, 1827 at about 3\r\n    o’clock in the afternoon, I found there Court Councillor Breuning,\r\n    his son, Frau van Beethoven, wife of Johann van Beethoven,\r\n    landowner and apothecary of Lenz, and my friend Joseph Teltscher,\r\n    portrait painter. I think that Prof. Schindler was also present.\r\n\r\nGerhard von Breuning says that Beethoven’s brother was in the room, and\r\nalso the housekeeper Sali; Schindler adds a nurse from Dr. Wawruch’s\r\nclinic. No doubt all were present at one moment or another; they came\r\nand went as occasion or duty called. Hüttenbrenner says that Teltscher\r\nbegan drawing the face of the dying man, which grated on Breuning’s\r\nfeelings and he made a remonstrance, whereupon the painter left the\r\nroom. Then Breuning and Schindler went away to choose a spot for the\r\ngrave. Hüttenbrenner continues:\r\n\r\n    Frau van Beethoven and I only were in the death-chamber during\r\n    the last moments of Beethoven’s life. After Beethoven had lain\r\n    unconscious, the death-rattle in his throat from 3 o’clock in the\r\n    afternoon till after 5, there came a flash of lightning accompanied\r\n    by a violent clap of thunder, which garishly illuminated the\r\n    death-chamber. (Snow lay before Beethoven’s dwelling.) After\r\n    this unexpected phenomenon of nature, which startled me greatly,\r\n    Beethoven opened his eyes, lifted his right hand and looked up\r\n    for several seconds with his fist clenched and a very serious,\r\n    threatening expression as if he wanted to say: “Inimical powers,\r\n    I defy you! Away with you! God is with me!” It also seemed as if,\r\n    like a brave commander, he wished to call out to his wavering\r\n    troops: “Courage, soldiers! Forward! Trust in me! Victory is\r\n    assured!”[182]. When he let the raised hand sink to the bed, his\r\n    eyes closed half-way. My right hand was under his head, my left\r\n    rested on his breast. Not another breath, not a heartbeat more!\r\n    The genius of the great master of tones fled from this world of\r\n    delusion into the realm of truth!--I pressed down the half-open\r\n    eyelids of the dead man, kissed them, then his forehead, mouth and\r\n    hands.--At my request Frau van Beethoven cut a lock of hair from\r\n    his head and handed it to me as a sacred souvenir of Beethoven’s\r\n    last hour. Thereupon I hurried, deeply moved, into the city,\r\n    carried the intelligence of Beethoven’s death to Herr Tobias\r\n    Haslinger, and after a few hours returned to my home in Styria.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE CAUSE OF BEETHOVEN’S DEATH]\r\n\r\nIt remained for modern science to give the right name to the disease\r\nwhich caused the death of the greatest of all tone-poets. Dropsy, said\r\nthe world for three-quarters of a century. But dropsy is not a disease;\r\nit is only a symptom, a condition due to disease. To Dr. Theodor von\r\nFrimmel belongs the credit of having made it clear that the fatal\r\nmalady was cirrhosis of the liver, of which _ascites_, or _hydrops\r\nabdominalis_, was a consequence. Beethoven had suffered from disorders\r\nof the liver years before. In 1821, as has been noted, he suffered an\r\nattack of jaundice. In his medical history of the case, Dr. Wawruch\r\nstated that the cause of the disease was to be found in an “antiquated”\r\nailment of liver as well as defects in the abdominal organs. When he\r\nobserved the first aggravation of the disease he recorded that “the\r\nliver plainly showed traces of hard knots, the jaundice increased.” In\r\nhis report of the autopsy, Dr. Wagner said: “The liver seemed to have\r\nshrunk to one half its normal size, to have a leathery hardness, a\r\ngreenish-blue color, and its lumpy surface, as well as its substance,\r\nwas interwoven with knots the size of a bean. All the blood-vessels\r\nwere narrow, with thickened walls and empty.” The treatment prescribed\r\nby Dr. Wawruch and adopted empirically at the suggestion of friends was\r\ndesigned, not to go to the seat of the difficulty but to relieve the\r\ndropsical condition of the abdominal cavity;--medicaments, decoctions,\r\nthe unfortunate sweat-bath, all were intended to produce liquid\r\nevacuations from the bowels, increase the secretion of urine and induce\r\nperspiration; the final resort was to _paracentesis_.[183]\r\n\r\nWhen Breuning and Schindler left the dying man in the care of\r\nHüttenbrenner and Frau van Beethoven, they went to the cemetery of the\r\nlittle village of Währing, and selected a place for Beethoven’s grave\r\nin the vicinity of the burial plot of the Vering family, to which\r\nBreuning’s first wife had belonged. Their return was retarded by the\r\nstorm. When they reëntered the sick-room they were greeted with the\r\nwords: “It is finished!” The immediate activities of the friends were\r\nnow directed to preparations for the funeral, the preservation of the\r\nphysical likeness of the great composer and, so far as was necessary,\r\nthe safeguarding of his possessions. In respect of the latter Gerhard\r\nvon Breuning tells of a painful incident which happened on the day\r\nafter Beethoven’s death.\r\n\r\nBreuning, Schindler, Johann van Beethoven and Holz were met in the\r\nlodgings to gather up the dead man’s papers, particularly to look\r\nfor the seven bank-shares which the will had given to the nephew. In\r\nspite of strenuous search they were not found and Johann let fall an\r\ninsinuation that the search was a sham. This angered von Breuning and\r\nhe left the house in a state of vexation and excitement. He returned\r\nto the lodgings in the afternoon and the search was resumed. Then Holz\r\npulled out a protruding nail in a cabinet, whereupon a drawer fell\r\nout and in it were the certificates. In later years Holz explained to\r\nOtto Jahn: “Beethoven kept his bank-shares in a secret drawer, the\r\nexistence of which was known only to Holz. While Beethoven lay dying\r\nhis brother in vain tried to find out where it was.” On a copy of this\r\nmemorandum,[184] Schindler wrote: “First of all after the death, Johann\r\nvan Beethoven searched for the shares, and not finding them cried out:\r\n‘Breuning and Schindler must produce them!’ Holz was requested to come\r\nby Breuning and asked if he did not know where they were concealed. He\r\nknew the secret drawer in an old cabinet in which they were preserved.”\r\nEven this simple incident has given rise to contradictory stories.\r\nSchindler, in his biography, says the place of concealment was a\r\nsecret drawer in a _Kassette_; Breuning, “in a secret compartment of\r\na writing-desk.” In 1863, Schindler explained to Gerhard von Breuning\r\nthat the article of furniture was an ordinary clothes-press. With the\r\ncertificates were found the letter to the “Immortal Beloved” and the\r\nportrait of the Countess von Brunswick.[185]\r\n\r\nOn March 27th, an autopsy was performed by Dr. Johann Wagner in the\r\npresence of Dr. Wawruch. Its significant disclosures have already been\r\nprinted here. In order to facilitate an examination of the organs of\r\nhearing the temporal bones were sawed out and carried away. Joseph\r\nDanhauser, a young painter who chanced to be in Vienna, received\r\npermission from Breuning to make a plaster cast of the dead man’s face.\r\nThis he did on March 28th, but the cast has little value as a portrait,\r\ninasmuch as it was made after the autopsy, which had greatly disfigured\r\nthe features. On the same day (not “immediately after death,” as has\r\nincorrectly been stated) Danhauser made a drawing of the head of\r\nBeethoven, which he reproduced by lithographic process. This picture\r\nbears the inscription: “Beethoven, March 28, drawn at his death-bed,\r\n1827,” and to the left, “Danhauser.” This drawing, too, was made after\r\nthe autopsy. For a bust which he modeled, the artist made use of the\r\ncast taken by Klein in 1812. Danhauser never came in contact with\r\nBeethoven alive.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: IMPOSING FUNERAL CEREMONIES]\r\n\r\nThe funeral took place at 3 o’clock in the afternoon of March 29th.\r\nIt was one of the most imposing functions of its kind ever witnessed\r\nin Vienna.[186] Breuning and Schindler had made the arrangements.\r\nCards of invitation were given out at Haslinger’s music-shop. Hours\r\nbefore the appointed time a multitude assembled in front of the\r\nSchwarzspanierhaus, and the mass grew moment by moment. Into the square\r\nin front of the house, it is said, 20,000 persons were crowded. All the\r\nnotable representatives of art were present. The schools were closed.\r\nFor the preservation of order, Breuning had asked the help of the\r\nmilitary. In its report “Der Sammler” said:\r\n\r\n    The crowd was so great that after the roomy court of Beethoven’s\r\n    residence could no longer hold it the gates had to be closed until\r\n    the procession moved. The coffin containing the corpse of the great\r\n    composer had been placed on view in the court. After the clergy\r\n    were come to perform their sacred office, the guests, who had been\r\n    invited to attend these solemn functions--musicians, singers,\r\n    poets, actors--all clad in complete mourning, with draped torches\r\n    and white roses fastened to bands of crape on their sleeves,\r\n    encircled the bier and the choristers sang the _Miserere_[187]\r\n    composed by the deceased. Solemnly, sublimely the pious tones of\r\n    the glorious composition floated upwards through the silent air.\r\n    The scene was imposing. The coffin, with its richly embroidered\r\n    pall, the clergy, the distinguished men who were giving the last\r\n    escort to their colleague, and the multitude round about--all this\r\n    made a stupendous picture.\r\n\r\nOn the conclusion of the canticle, the coffin was raised from the\r\nbier and the door of the court was opened. The singers lifted the\r\ncoffin to their shoulders and carried it to the Trinity Church of the\r\nMinorites in the Alserstrasse. It was difficult to order the procession\r\nbecause of the surging multitude. Johann van Beethoven, von Breuning\r\nand his son and Schindler, found their places with difficulty. Eight\r\nchapelmasters--Eybler, Weigl, Hummel, Seyfried, Kreutzer, Gyrowetz,\r\nWürfel and Gänsbacher--carried the edges of the pall. At the sides\r\nwalked the torch-bearers, among them Schubert, Castelli, Bernard,\r\nBöhm, Czerny, Grillparzer, Haslinger, Holz, Linke, Mayseder, Piringer,\r\nSchuppanzigh, Streicher, Steiner and Wolfmayer. In the procession\r\nwere also Mosel and the pupils of Drechsler. While passing the Rothes\r\nHaus the sounds of the funeral march from Beethoven’s Sonata, Op.\r\n26, were heard. The cortège moved through the crowded streets to the\r\nparish church in the Alserstrasse, where the service for the dead\r\nwas concluded with the _Libera nos Domine_ in 16 parts _a cappella_,\r\ncomposed by Seyfried, sung by the choristers.\r\n\r\nThe account of the “Sammler” continues: “The coffin was now placed in\r\nthe hearse drawn by four horses, and taken to the cemetery at Währing.\r\nThere, too, a multitude had assembled to do the last honors to the dead\r\nman....” The rules of the cemetery prohibiting all public speaking\r\nwithin its precincts, the actor Anschütz delivered a funeral oration\r\nwritten by Grillparzer over the coffin at the cemetery gate. After the\r\ncoffin had been lowered into the grave, Haslinger handed three laurel\r\nwreaths to Hummel, who placed them upon the coffin. A poem by Castelli\r\nhad been distributed at the house of mourning, and one by Baron von\r\nSchlechta at the cemetery; but there was no more speaking or singing at\r\nthe burial.\r\n\r\nMozart’s “Requiem” was sung at the Church of the Augustinians, Lablache\r\ntaking part, on April 3rd, and Cherubini’s at the Karlskirche two days\r\nlater. The grave in the cemetery at Währing was marked by a simple\r\npyramid bearing the one word\r\n\r\n    BEETHOVEN\r\n\r\nIt fell into neglect, and on October 13th, 1863, the Gesellschaft der\r\nMusikfreunde of Vienna caused the body to be exhumed and re-buried. On\r\nJune 21st, 1888, the remains of Beethoven and Schubert were removed to\r\nthe Central Cemetery in Vienna, where they now repose side by side.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[162] He did not live to see this wish fulfilled; but it was in the\r\nend. Therese van Beethoven, Johann’s wife, died on November 20, 1828,\r\nat Wasserhof; Johann died in Vienna on January 12, 1848, and though\r\none of Beethoven’s sensation-mongering biographers at one time printed\r\nthe monstrous falsehood that he had married his wife’s illegitimate\r\ndaughter in order to keep the family possessions in his hands, and\r\nat another that he had invested his money so that he might use it up\r\nduring his life and leave nothing to his heirs, the fact is that Johann\r\nmade Karl his sole heir and that under the will, after paying the costs\r\nof probate and administration and a legacy to his housekeeper, over\r\n42,000 florins passed into his nephew’s hands.\r\n\r\n[163] Wawruch was a native of Nemtschütz in Moravia. At Olmütz he was\r\na student of theology, but before consecration to the priesthood he\r\ncame to Vienna as tutor and there decided to abandon the church for\r\nmedicine. In the course of time he became assistant and also son-in-law\r\nto Professor Hildebrand, the director of the General Hospital. Thence\r\nhe went to Prague as professor of general pathology and pharmacology\r\nand, returning to Vienna, became professor of special pathology and\r\nmedical clinics in the surgical department of the Hospital. He died\r\nin 1842. He was accused of adhering to old-fashioned theories in his\r\npractice and of having been antagonistic to the determinations of\r\npathological anatomy, and the criticisms of von Breuning and others\r\nhave pursued him through all the books devoted to Beethoven’s life;\r\nyet the scientific determinations of to-day offer justification of his\r\ndiagnosis and treatment of Beethoven’s case so far as it is possible to\r\njudge at this late day.\r\n\r\n[164] Holz’s statement on this point has already been given in an\r\nearlier chapter. To Otto Jahn Dr. Bertolini said: “Beethoven liked to\r\ndrink a glass of wine, but he was never a drinker or a gourmand.”\r\n\r\n[165] “Better from my belly than from my pen,” is another remark\r\ncredited to him by Seyfried.\r\n\r\n[166] The Royal Library acquired the autograph manuscripts of the\r\ninstrumental movements of the Symphony from Schindler, and the choral\r\npart from the Artaria Collection of Vienna when it was dispersed by\r\nsale in 1901. The autograph is not intact, however, the coda of the\r\nScherzo, consisting of four pages, having been given to Moscheles by\r\nSchindler on September 14, 1827. Moscheles in turn gave the relic to\r\nHenry Phillips. In July, 1907, it was purchased at a public sale by Mr.\r\nEdward Speyer, its owner at the present writing. The autograph of the\r\nFinale, too, had been mutilated, a page containing the five measures\r\nimmediately preceding the _Allegro energico_, 6-4 time, with the words\r\n“Über Sternen muss er wohnen,” having been removed. It was sold by an\r\nautograph dealer of Berlin to Charles Malherbe, of Paris, who on his\r\ndeath bequeathed it to the Conservatoire. As published, the _Allegro\r\nnon tanto_ contains eight measures which Beethoven did not write in the\r\nautograph, but are, no doubt, an addition made by him in a revision. It\r\nwould be a beautiful act of piety to assemble the autograph score and\r\npublish it in _facsimile_.\r\n\r\n[167] Mr. Thayer, who has given expression in these pages to his\r\nbelief that Schindler was honest, in transcribing this page of the\r\nConversation Book writes these words: “It is to be noted, first, that\r\nthe writing (‘The Old Woman,’ etc.) does not correspond with the rest,\r\nand secondly, that _Die Alte_ was no longer in Beethoven’s service.\r\nIt is evident on inspection and from the talk in these last books\r\nabout Thekla and other servants that Schindler inserted these words\r\nlong afterwards. The ‘Es muss sein’ can only refer here to Beethoven’s\r\nreceipt for the ring.” Whether or not Thayer suspected what may have\r\nbeen Schindler’s purpose in making the interlineation does not appear.\r\n\r\n[168] Schindler, impeaching Dr. Wawruch’s accuracy here, denies that\r\nBeethoven worked on oratorio of “Saul and David” during his last\r\nillness. Thayer in a note directs attention to the fact that Beethoven\r\nwas confessedly deeply absorbed in Handel’s scores, which he had\r\nreceived only a short time before, and that before the end of December\r\nKiesewetter sent a request through Holz for a return of the pianoforte\r\nscore of “Saul” as no longer necessary, now that the scores were come.\r\n\r\n[169] Dr. von Breuning should have said “third.”\r\n\r\n[170] Thayer procured a copy of this letter in London along with the\r\nother Stumpff papers already mentioned. Only a fragment of the letter\r\nhas been printed hitherto in the collections of Beethoven’s letters and\r\nthat, in great probability, from the draft preserved by Schindler. The\r\nnewspaper article referred to was printed in the “Modezeitung.”\r\n\r\n[171] “Documents, Letters etc., relating to the Bust of Ludwig van\r\nBeethoven, presented to the Philharmonic Society of London, by Frau\r\nFanny Linzbauer (_née_ Ponsing).

Bell, London: Published for the Philharmonic\r\nSociety by Lamborn Cock and Co., 63 New Bond Street, W. 1871.”\r\n\r\n[172] Schindler had accompanied Beethoven’s application to Moscheles\r\nfor relief with a personal letter in which he advised that the\r\nPhilharmonic Society, in case it should accede to his request, explain\r\nto Beethoven that the amount would be sent to a responsible person\r\nin Vienna from whom it might be drawn by degrees according to his\r\nrequirements; and that this precautionary step was taken “because, as\r\nthey well knew, some of his relations who are with him do not act quite\r\nuprightly towards him”--a fling, of course, at the composer’s brother\r\nwhom he so cordially hated; the nephew was not in Vienna.\r\n\r\n[173] Among Mr. Thayer’s papers.\r\n\r\n[174] The third operation was performed on February 2, not January 28,\r\nas Schindler says.\r\n\r\n[175] Wolfmayer had commissioned him years before to write a “Requiem,”\r\nand paid him for it.\r\n\r\n[176] Letter among Mr. Thayer’s papers.\r\n\r\n[177] Neue Folge, 1871, p. 169 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[178] “Rabelais being very sick, Cardinal du Bellay sent his page to\r\nhim to have an account of his condition; his answer was, ‘Tell my Lord\r\nin what circumstances thou findest me; I am going to leap into the\r\ndark. He is up in the cockloft, bid him keep where he is. As for thee,\r\nthou’lt always be a fool: let down the curtain, the farce is done.’”\r\n... An author (Thov. His. de Jean Clopinel) who styles Rabelais a man\r\nof excellent learning, writes, that he being importuned by some to\r\nsign a will whereby they had made him bestow on them legacies that\r\nexceeded his ability, he, to be no more disturbed, complied at last\r\nwith their desires; but when they came to ask him where they should\r\nfind a fund answerable to what he gave; ‘as for that,’ replied he,\r\n‘you must do like the spaniel, look about and search’; then, adds that\r\nauthor, having said, ‘Draw the curtain, the farce is over,’ he died.\r\nLikewise a monk (P. de St. Romuald, _Rel. Feuillant_) not only tells us\r\nthat he ended his life with that jest, but that he left a paper sealed\r\nup wherein were found three articles as his last will: ‘I owe much,\r\nI have nothing, I give the rest to the poor.’ The last story or that\r\nbefore it must undoubtedly be false; and perhaps both are so as well\r\nas the message by the page; though Fregius (_Comment. in Orat. Cic._,\r\ntom. I) relates also that Rabelais said when he was dying, ‘Draw the\r\ncurtain,’ etc. But if he said so, many great men have said much the\r\nsame. Thus Augustus (_Nunquid vitæ mimum commode peregisset_) near his\r\ndeath, asked his friends whether he had not very well acted the farce\r\nof life? And Demonax, one of the best philosophers, when he saw that he\r\ncould not, by reason of his great age, live any longer, without being\r\na burden to others, as well as to himself, said to those who were near\r\nhim what the herald used to say when the public games were ended, ‘You\r\nmay withdraw, the show is over,’ and refusing to eat, kept his usual\r\ngaiety to the last, and set himself at ease. (Lucian)--_From Peter\r\nMotteux’s Life of Rabelais prefaced to the English translation made by\r\nhimself and Sir Thomas Urquhart._\r\n\r\n[179] In a letter to Mr. Thayer which was found among Hüttenbrenner’s\r\nposthumous papers and printed in the “Gratzer Tagespost” of October\r\n23rd, 1868.\r\n\r\n[180] “Aus dem Schwarzspanierhause,” p. 108.\r\n\r\n[181] Mr. Thayer visited Hüttenbrenner in Gratz in June, 1860. His\r\ntranscript of what Hüttenbrenner told him is reprinted in “Music and\r\nManners in the Classical Period,” by Henry Edward Krehbiel (New York,\r\n1898). The account in the body of the text is that contained in a\r\nletter to Mr. Thayer.\r\n\r\n[182] The transcript in Mr. Thayer’s note-book of Hüttenbrenner’s\r\noral recital is more sententious and dramatic: “At this startling,\r\nawful, peal of thunder, the dying man suddenly raised his head\r\nfrom Hüttenbrenner’s arm, stretched out his own right arm\r\nmajestically--‘like a general giving orders to an army’. This was but\r\nfor an instant; the arm sunk back; he fell back; Beethoven was dead.”\r\n\r\n[183] The revised edition of Grove’s “Dictionary of Music and\r\nMusicians,” 1904, says: “The cold had developed into an inflammation\r\nof the lungs, and on this dropsy supervened.” Dr. Wawruch was\r\nunquestionably correct in his diagnosis not only in regard to the\r\ninflammation of the lungs but also in regard to the diseased condition\r\nof the liver.\r\n\r\n[184] Preserved amongst Thayer’s papers.\r\n\r\n[185] The attested inventory of the sale of Beethoven’s effects, which,\r\npreserved by Fischoff, passed through the hands of Otto Jahn into those\r\nof Mr. Thayer, showed that his estate amounted to 9,885 florins, 13\r\nkreutzer, silver, and 600 florins, paper (Vienna standard). The market\r\nvalue of the bank-shares, including an unpaid coupon attached to each,\r\nwas 1,063 florins on the day of Beethoven’s death. In the item of cash\r\nis included the £100 received from the London Philharmonic Society,\r\nwhich, as has been stated, was found intact. The official summary was\r\nset forth as follows:\r\n\r\n  Cash                            1215 fl. (C. M.) 600 fl. (W. W.)\r\n  Bank-shares                     7441 fl.\r\n  Debts receivable (annuity)       144 fl. 33 k.\r\n  Jewels and silverware            314 fl. 30 k.\r\n  Clothing                          37 fl.\r\n  Furniture and household\r\n    goods                          156 fl.\r\n  Instruments                       78 fl.\r\n  Music and manuscripts            480 fl. 30 k.\r\n  Books                             18 fl. 20 k.\r\n                                  ------------------------------\r\n                                  9885 fl. 13 k. 600 fl. (W. W.)\r\n\r\nAccording to a statement by Aloys Fuchs to Jahn the sum realized from\r\nthe sale of the musical compositions, autographic and otherwise,\r\nsketch-books, etc., was 1063 florins. In view of the difference\r\nin purchasing power of money in 1827 and 1913 it may be said that\r\nBeethoven’s estate amounted to the equivalent of £3,000, or about\r\n$15,000.\r\n\r\n[186] See “Aus dem Schwarzspanierhause,” p. 113; Hiller’s “Aus dem\r\nTonleben, etc.” p. 177 _et seq._; “Der Sammler,” April 14, 1827;\r\nSeyfried’s “Beethoven-Studien,” appendix, p. 50 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[187] The _Miserere_ sung in the court of the Schwarzspanierhaus and\r\nits complement, _Amplius lava me_, were arrangements for male chorus\r\nmade by Seyfried of the Equale for Trombones composed by Beethoven in\r\nLinz in 1812 at the request of Glöggl for use on All Souls’ Day.
