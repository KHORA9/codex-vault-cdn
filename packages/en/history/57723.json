Commencing with the conquest of the Isles by Harald Harfagri,\r\nthe Saga relates the subsequent history of the Earldom of Orkney under\r\nthe long line of its Norse Jarls, and is, for a period of three\r\ncenturies and a half, the principal authority for the history of\r\nNorthern Scotland. The narrative is mainly personal, and therefore\r\npicturesque, pourtraying the men in person and character, impartially\r\nrecording their deeds, and mentioning what was thought of them and their\r\nactions at the time. Occasionally the Saga-writer is enabled to do this\r\nin the words of a contemporary Skald. The skaldic songs, so often\r\nquoted, were the materials from which the Sagas were subsequently\r\nelaborated. In estimating their value as historical materials, it must\r\nbe borne in mind that all history has begun in song. When great events\r\nand mighty deeds were preserved for posterity by oral recitation alone,\r\nit was necessary that the memory should be enabled to retain its hold of\r\nthe elements of the story by some extraneous artistic aid, and therefore\r\nthey were welded by the word-smith’s rhymes into a compact and\r\nhomogeneous “lay.” Thus, worked into a poetical setting (as the jeweller\r\nmounts his gems to enhance their value and ensure their preservation),\r\nthey passed as heirlooms from generation to generation, floating on the\r\noral tradition of the people. Snorri Sturluson tells us that the songs\r\nof the skalds who were with Harald Harfagri in his wars were known and\r\nrecited in his day, after an interval of nearly four centuries. “These\r\nsongs,” he says, “which were sung in the presence of kings and chiefs,\r\nor of their sons, are the materials of our history; what they tell of\r\ntheir deeds and battles we take for truth; for though the skalds did no\r\ndoubt praise those in whose presence they stood, yet no one would dare\r\nto relate to a chief what he and those who heard it knew to be wholly\r\nimaginary or false, as that would not be praise but mockery.” Our\r\nearliest Scottish chroniclers did not disdain to make use of the\r\nlay-smith’s craft, as a help to history, long after the Iceland skald\r\nhad been succeeded by the Saga-writer, and the flowery recitative of an\r\nunclerkly age superseded by the terser narrative of the parchment\r\nscribe. The art is as old as Odin and the gods, if indeed it be not\r\nolder, and these its creations. But its golden age had passed ere\r\nPaganism began to give way before Christianity, and the specimens we\r\nhave in this Saga are mostly of the period of its decadence and by\r\ninferior skalds. Yet it is significant of the esteem in which the art\r\ncontinued to be held by the settlers in the Orkneys, that we find Earl\r\nSigurd honouring Gunnlaug Ormstunga with princely gifts, Arnor\r\nJarlaskald enjoying the special favour and friendship of Earl Thorfinn,\r\nand Earl Rögnvald, the founder of the cathedral, courting for himself\r\nthe reputation of an accomplished skald.\r\n\r\nBut though we can thus trace to some extent the authorship of the\r\nunwritten materials from which the Saga was framed, there is nothing to\r\nshow where or by whom it was written. There is proof, however, that it\r\nwas known in Iceland in the first half of the thirteenth century. Its\r\nearlier chapters, down to the division of the Earldom between Thorfinn\r\nand Brúsi, are incorporated into the Olaf Saga of Snorri Sturluson, and\r\nare there cited as from the “Jarla Saga,” or Saga of the Earls. It must\r\ntherefore have been in existence as a completed work before 1241, the\r\ndate of Snorri’s death. The compiler of the Fagrskinna, which is shown\r\nby internal evidence to have been written between 1222 and 1225, also\r\nquotes from it, by the title of “Jarla Sagan.” The closing chapters of\r\nthe Orkneyinga Saga, in its present form, recording the burning of\r\nBishop Adam, could not have been written before 1222; but, as it is\r\nstated in the last chapter that the terrible retribution exacted by the\r\nScottish King for the murder of the Bishop was still in fresh memory, it\r\nmay very well have been completed before 1225. No manuscript of the\r\nJarla Saga is known to exist, and the original form of what is now\r\ncalled “The Orkneyinga Saga” is thus matter of conjecture. We know it\r\nonly as the substance of its earlier chapters was given by Snorri\r\nprevious to 1241, and in the expanded version of the Flateyjarbók, where\r\nit is pieced into the Sagas of Olaf Tryggvi’s son and Olaf the Holy. The\r\nFlateyjarbók, however, is nearly a century and a half later than\r\nSnorri’s work, having been written between the years 1387 and 1394.\r\n\r\nThe object of the present issue being simply to provide a plain,\r\nreadable, and unadorned translation of the Orkneyinga Saga (which has\r\nbeen hitherto inaccessible to the English reader), it has been deemed\r\nadvisable to adhere to the form of the Saga adopted by its first editor\r\nJonæus, though not to Jonæus’s text, which is by no means free from\r\ncorruptions. The Christiania edition of the Flateyjarbók, printed\r\nliterally from the manuscript, has afforded the means of rectifying the\r\ntext where necessary; and the expanded version of the earlier chapters\r\ngiven in the Flateyjarbók has also been translated and inserted as an\r\nappendix, for the sake of the fuller details which it supplies of the\r\nearlier history of the Earldom. In one sense it might have been\r\ndesirable to have compiled a text which would have given the fullest\r\nhistory of the Orkney Earls, but this would not have been the\r\n“Orkneyinga Saga.” It would have necessitated the collection and\r\ncritical collation of all the passages in all the Sagas and early\r\nwritings relating to the history of the Northmen in Scotland—a work\r\nwhich has long been in progress in abler hands, and under more\r\nfavourable auspices.\r\n\r\nThe Introduction, however, has been compiled with a view to supplement\r\nthe Saga narrative, as well as to furnish a continuation of the history\r\nof the Earldom down to the time when it ceased to form part of the\r\nNorwegian dominions. Some account of the islands previous to the Norse\r\ninvasion, and a few notices of their antiquities and ecclesiastical\r\nremains, as well as of the existing traces of the Norsemen, seemed\r\nrequisite to supplement the notes in illustration of the text.\r\nChronological and Genealogical Tables have been added to facilitate\r\nreference; and on the maps of Scotland and of the island-groups which\r\nformed the Earldom proper are shown the names of the principal places\r\nmentioned in the Sagas as known to the Northmen.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I have to express my obligations to those kind friends\r\nwho have aided me with their advice and assistance. To Dr. John Stuart,\r\nDr. John Hill Burton, Sir Henry Dryden, Bart., and Colonel Balfour of\r\nBalfour and Trenaby, I am indebted for many valuable suggestions. To the\r\nfirst-named gentleman I am also under obligations for the use of the\r\nwoodcuts of the symbols of the Sculptured Stones. The Society of\r\nAntiquaries of Scotland have generously contributed the woodcuts of the\r\nBressay Stone, the Saverough Bell, and the Sword and Scabbard-tip; to\r\nthe Society of Antiquaries of London I am indebted for the illustrations\r\nof the Stones of Stennis; to Mr. James Ferguson and Mr. John Murray for\r\nthose of Maeshow; to Mr. Thomas S. Muir for the Dragon of Maeshow, the\r\netchings of the churches of Weir and Lybster, and the ground-plans of\r\nthe ancient churches; to Messrs. Chambers for the woodcut of Mousa; and\r\nto Dr. Daniel Wilson and Messrs. Constable for those of the Brooch and\r\nComb, illustrating the burial-usages of the Norsemen. The view of\r\nEgilsey church is from a photograph, for which I am indebted to Mr.\r\nGeorge Petrie of Kirkwall, whose pleasant companionship in a pilgrimage\r\namong the localities described in the Saga is gratefully remembered.\r\n\r\n                                                                   J.

EARLIEST HISTORICAL NOTICES OF THE ORKNEYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe historical notices of the Orkneys previous to the Norse occupation\r\nare few in number, and exceedingly obscure. We learn little more from\r\nthe allusions of the Roman writers than that scarcely anything was known\r\nto them with certainty of these remote localities. It may be inferred,\r\nhowever, that the first wave of Celtic population that overspread the\r\nnorthern mainland of Britain must have gradually extended northward to\r\nthe outlying Isles. The correspondence of the early remains found in the\r\nIslands with those of northern Scotland is of itself a striking\r\ntestimony to the connection of their early population with the Celtic\r\nstock of the northern mainland of Scotland. We gather from these remains\r\nthat the earliest population of the Islands, of which we have any\r\nreliable evidence, lived in the same manner as the natives of the\r\nnorthern mainland, fought with the same varieties of weapons of stone\r\nand bronze, erected the same forms of defensive structures, practised\r\nthe same funereal rites, and constructed similar forms of sepulchral\r\nchambers, over which they piled the great mounds which are among the\r\nmost striking features of an Orkney landscape.[1] The number and\r\nmagnitude of these monuments and structural remains bear witness in a\r\nmost remarkable manner to the activity, intelligence, and social\r\norganisation of the times that have no other record.\r\n\r\nIt is not until the middle of the 5th century of the Christian era that\r\nthe early chronicles begin to cast occasionally a feeble and uncertain\r\nlight upon the history of the northern isles. It is stated in the\r\n“Historia Britonum” of Nennius that the Saxon chiefs Ochtha and Ebissa,\r\nwho came over with “forty keels” in the year 449, laid waste the Orkney\r\nIslands, and seized a great many regions beyond the Frisic Sea.[2] At\r\nthat time, and for a long period previously (according to Nennius), the\r\nPicts had been in possession of the Orkneys. Whatever value may be\r\nattached to these statements as referring to events which took place 400\r\nyears before the author’s own time, there can be no reason for\r\ndiscrediting his testimony when he says that the Picts continued in\r\npossession of the Orkneys in his day.[3]\r\n\r\nAdamnan, in his Life of St. Columba, mentions that the saint being on a\r\nvisit to Bruide Mac Meilcon, king of the Northern Picts, at his\r\nstronghold on the river Ness, requested the king to recommend to the\r\n_reguli_ of the Orkneys (one of whom was then present, and whose\r\nhostages were then in the king’s hands) that Cormac and the clerics who\r\nhad accompanied him on a missionary voyage to the Orkneys should receive\r\nno harm; and it is added that this was the means of saving them from a\r\nviolent death. But if the authority and influence of the king of the\r\nNorthern Picts extended to these islands in the reign of Bruide, it does\r\nnot seem to have been effectual in protecting them from foreign\r\ninvasion. Bruide Mac Meilcon died in 584, and some time before his death\r\nthe new and rising power of the Dalriadic kings had made itself felt as\r\nfar as the Orkneys. In the Annals of Ulster there is a notice under the\r\nyear 580 of an expedition against the Orkneys by Aedan, son of Gabran,\r\nseventh king of the Dalriad Scots, who, coming over from Ireland (then\r\ncalled Scotia) about the year 503, had established themselves in Argyle\r\nand the Western Highlands, and founded the kingdom of Dalriada. From the\r\ndate of Aedan’s expedition in 580 we have no mention of the islands in\r\nthe native chronicles for a whole century, and the next entry, which\r\noccurs under the year 682, gives colour to the supposition that they may\r\nhave been under Dalriadic rule in the interval. The record in 682 is\r\nsimply, that the Orkneys were wasted by Bruide Mac Bile, the king of the\r\nNorthern Picts, and apparently brought once more under the rule of the\r\nNorthern Pictish kings.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 II. EARLY CHRISTIANITY OF THE ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is probable that both the island groups of Orkney and Shetland were\r\nvisited at a very early period by wandering clerics of the Irish Church,\r\nwhose missionary efforts contributed so much to the diffusion of\r\nChristianity in Scotland. But we have no record of an earlier visitation\r\nthan that of the companions of St. Columba, although there are\r\nindications that between that time and the colonisation of the islands\r\nby the heathen Northmen, these Irish clerics were no strangers in any of\r\nthe island groups.\r\n\r\nThe Irish monk Dicuil, who wrote his treatise “De Mensura Orbis\r\nTerrarum” in or about the year 825, states that “thirty years before\r\nthat time some clerics had told him that they had lived in an island\r\nwhich they supposed to be Thule, where at the summer solstice the sun\r\nonly hid himself behind a little hill for a short time during the night,\r\nwhich was quite light; and that a day’s sail towards the north would\r\nbring them from thence into the frozen sea.” This island is obviously\r\nIceland. He then states that there are many other islands in the\r\nnorthern British sea, which lie at the distance of two days and two\r\nnights from the northern islands of Britain, in a straight course, and\r\nwith a fair wind and a full sail. “One of these,” he says, “a certain\r\nhonest monk told me he had visited one summer after sailing a day, a\r\nnight, and another day, in a two-benched boat.” These appear to be the\r\nShetland Islands. Dicuil further states that “there are also some other\r\nsmall islands, almost all divided from each other by narrow sounds,\r\ninhabited for about a century by hermits proceeding from our Scotia;[4]\r\nbut as they had been deserted since the beginning of the world, so are\r\nthey now abandoned by these anchorites on account of the Northern\r\nrobbers; but they are full of countless sheep, and swarm with sea-fowl\r\nof various kinds. We have not seen these islands mentioned in the works\r\nof any author.” Here the reference to the “small isles separated by\r\nnarrow sounds” is distinctive of the Faroes, of which the long narrow\r\nsounds are the peculiar physical feature; while the statement that they\r\nare full of countless sheep, taken in connection with the fact that the\r\nNorthmen named them “Sheep-isles” (Fær-eyiar), establishes the identity\r\nof the group which Dicuil describes. The Faroes were colonised by “the\r\nNorthern robbers,” led by Grim Kamban, in 825, the very year in which\r\nDicuil was writing.\r\n\r\nThe first Norwegian settlement was made in Iceland in 875, by Leif and\r\nIngulf, who carried with them a number of Irish captives; and the\r\nLandnamabók states that “before Iceland was colonised from Norway, men\r\nwere living there whom the Northmen called Papas; they were Christians,\r\nand it is thought they came over the sea from the west, for after them\r\nwere found Irish books, and bells, and crosiers, and other things, so\r\nthat one could see that they were Westmen: these things were found in\r\nPapey, eastwards, and in Papyli.” Again, in the Islendingabók of Ari\r\nFrodi the same reason is assigned for the departure of the monks as is\r\ngiven by Dicuil. Ari Frodi also says, speaking of Iceland:—“Christian\r\nmen were here then called by the Northmen _Papa_, but afterwards they\r\nwent their way, for they would not remain in company with heathens; and\r\nthey left behind them Irish books, and bells, and pastoral staves, so\r\nthat it was clear that they were Irishmen.”\r\n\r\nThus by the concurrent testimony of Adamnan, the biographer of St.\r\nColumba, himself an abbot of the monastery of Hy; of the Irish monk\r\nDicuil, writing during the lifetime of the men who had fled from the\r\nNorthern robbers; and lastly, of the Icelandic historians themselves—it\r\nis established that the whole of the northern islands were visited by\r\nChristian teachers, and probably, in part at least, converted to the\r\nChristian faith, before they were overrun by the Norwegian invaders, and\r\nthe new faith swallowed up in the rising tide of heathenism thrown upon\r\ntheir shores from the land of Odin and the Aser.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of all record we cannot expect to ascertain to what\r\nextent these early missionary settlements had succeeded in leavening the\r\nCeltic population of the islands of Orkney and Shetland with the\r\nChristian faith. But it seems probable that during the three centuries\r\nthat intervened between the coming of Cormac in his coracle and the\r\narrival of Harald Harfagri with his fleet of war galleys, the new faith\r\nhad been firmly established and widely extended both in the northern\r\nmainland of Scotland and in the remoter isles.\r\n\r\nThe indications which point to a Christian occupation of the isle, of no\r\ninconsiderable extent and continuance, previous to their occupation by\r\nthe Norsemen, are:—The dedications of the early ecclesiastical\r\nfoundations; the occurrence of monumental stones sculptured in the style\r\npeculiar to the earliest Christian monuments of the mainland of\r\nScotland, and bearing inscriptions in the Ogham character; the finding\r\n(as at Saverough and Burrian) of ecclesiastical bells of the\r\nsquare-sided form, peculiar to the early ages of the Church; and the\r\noccurrence in the Norse topography of the islands of place-names\r\nindicative of the previous settlement of Celtic Christian priests.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SQUARE-SIDED BELL FOUND AT SAVEROUGH, ORKNEY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest dedications were probably those to St. Ninian and St.\r\nColumba, St. Brigid, and St. Tredwell. It may be significant that in the\r\nsouth parish of South Ronaldsay, where in all probability the companions\r\nof St. Columba would make their first landing in Orkney, there were no\r\nfewer than three chapels dedicated to him.[5]\r\n\r\nThe sculptured monuments furnish us with three collateral lines of\r\ninference, tending to the same conclusion. These inferences are derived\r\nfrom the inscriptions, the ornamentation, and the symbols of the\r\nmonuments.\r\n\r\nTwo of these monuments bear inscriptions in the Ogham character, a style\r\nof cryptographic writing characteristic of the early inscribed stone\r\nmonuments of Ireland, but occurring also in Cornwall, in Wales, and in\r\nScotland. One of these two was found near the ancient church of\r\nCulbinsbrugh, in the island of Bressay in Shetland. It is a slab of\r\nchlorite slate, 4 feet in length, about 16 inches wide at the top,\r\ntapering to a little less than a foot at the bottom, and about 1¾ inch\r\nthick. It is sculptured on both sides in low relief, and the inscription\r\nis incised on the edges of the stone. On one of its sculptured faces it\r\nbears the Christian emblem of the cross, and among the figures\r\nsculptured on it are those of two ecclesiastics with pastoral staves\r\n(see Plates). The other inscribed stone was found by Dr. William Traill\r\nin the Pictish Tower or “Broch” of Burrian, in North Ronaldsay in\r\nOrkney. The inscription scratched on it has not yet been deciphered. It\r\nalso bears the Christian emblem of the cross. The association of the\r\ncross with these Ogham inscriptions[6] points to a period anterior to\r\nthe Norse occupation of the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRESSAY STONE. Showing one side and Ogham inscription\r\non edge.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRESSAY STONE. Showing the other side and Ogham\r\ninscription on edge.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn examining the characteristics of the art of these monumental stones,\r\nwe are guided to similar conclusions. The Bressay stone bears none of\r\nthe symbols peculiar to the Scottish monuments, and in its artistic\r\nfeatures it comes nearer to some of the Irish than to the general style\r\nof the Scottish sculptures. It is sculptured in low relief, while all\r\nthe Orkney examples are merely incised. But some of the forms of their\r\nornamentation are also characteristic of the art of the illuminated\r\nIrish manuscripts of the 7th and 8th centuries, and others are equally\r\ncharacteristic of the art of the bronzes of what has been styled the\r\nlate Celtic period.\r\n\r\nThe Scottish sculptured monuments scattered over the territory ranging\r\nfrom the Forth to the Orkneys are characterised by a peculiar set of\r\nsymbols of unknown significance, which are often associated with the\r\nChristian emblem of the cross.[7] The symbol which is of most frequent\r\noccurrence, and which may therefore be said to be the most\r\ncharacteristic of the period of the monuments, is a crescent conjoined\r\nwith what has been called a double sceptre, as represented in the first\r\nfigure of the accompanying Plate.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SYMBOLS ON THE SCULPTURED STONES OF SCOTLAND.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis characteristic symbol occurs on a sculptured slab which was found\r\nbuilt into St. Peter’s Church in South Ronaldsay, and which had\r\nevidently formed part of a monument older than the church. It occurs\r\nalso on the slab found at Firth, on the mainland of Orkney. Most\r\nsingularly, it occurs on the phalangial bone of an ox which was found in\r\nthe Broch of Burrian along with the slab previously described as bearing\r\nan Ogham inscription and a peculiar form of cross. It occurs associated\r\nwith the same form of cross on the elaborately-sculptured stone at\r\nUlbster in Caithness. We have this crescent symbol also associated with\r\nthe cross on the inscribed stone of St. Vigeans in Forfarshire. This\r\nstone bears the only inscription which is known to have been left to us\r\nin the Pictish language:—[8]\r\n\r\n            DROSTEN │ IPE  │ VORET  │     ELT      │ FORCUS\r\n            “Drost, │son of│ Voret, │of the race of│Fergus,”\r\n\r\nand is believed to refer to that Drost, king of the Picts, who fell at\r\nthe battle of Blathmig, according to the Annals of Tighearnac, in A.D.\r\n729.\r\n\r\nThe indications afforded by the Norse topography of the Islands, if\r\ntaken in connection with the passages previously quoted from the\r\nLandnamabók and the Islendingabók of Ari Frodi regarding the origin of\r\nthe names Papa and Papyli in Iceland, require only to be mentioned. The\r\nmost obvious of these are the frequency with which the name Papa[9]\r\noccurs both in the topography of Orkney and Shetland, and the occurrence\r\nof such names as St. Ninian’s Isle in Shetland, Rinansey (Ringan’s-ey,\r\nSt. Ninian’s Isle) in Orkney, Daminsey, now Damsey (St. Adamnan’s Isle),\r\nand Enhallow (Eyin-Helga, Holy Isle), given, we must suppose,\r\nintelligently by the Norsemen.\r\n\r\nThus, at the very starting-point of their recorded history, we find\r\nindications of Christianity, with suggestions even of its civilisation\r\nand its art shedding their benign influence over the isles.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. ARRIVAL OF THE NORTHMEN, AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THE EARLDOM OF ORKNEY\r\n                             AND CAITHNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest notice we have of the visits of the Northmen to the shores\r\nof Britain occurs in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle under the date A.D. 787:—\r\n\r\n    “In this year King Beorhtric took Eadburh, King Offa’s daughter, to\r\n    wife. And in his days first came three ships of Northmen from\r\n    Hæretha-land; and then the reeve rode thereto, and would drive them\r\n    to the king’s vill, for he knew not what they were, and they there\r\n    slew him. These were the first ships of Danish men that sought the\r\n    land of the English race.”\r\n\r\nAs they came from Hæretha-land, now Hördaland, on the west coast of\r\nNorway, they were Norwegians, not Danes.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Annals and the Welsh Chronicles agree in representing the\r\nfirst inroads of the Norsemen on the Irish coasts as having commenced in\r\nthe year 795. In 798 they plundered Inispatrick of Man and the Hebrides;\r\nin 802, and again in 806, they ravaged Iona, slaying in the latter year\r\nsixty-eight of the monastic family there. In 807 they established\r\nthemselves on the mainland of Ireland; and a few years afterwards we\r\nfind a Norseman making Armagh the capital of his kingdom.\r\n\r\nIn 852, Olaf the White, a chieftain descended from the same family as\r\nHarald Harfagri, conquered Dublin, and founded the most powerful and\r\npermanent of the Norse kingdoms in Ireland.\r\n\r\nBy the victory of Hafursfiord in 872, Harald Harfagri made himself sole\r\nmonarch of Norway. Large numbers of the wealthy and powerful odallers,\r\nwhom he had dispossessed of their territorial possessions, fled to the\r\nislands of Orkney and Shetland, which, for a full century previous to\r\nthis time, had been well known to the Norsemen as the viking station of\r\nthe western haf—the rendezvous of the Northern rovers, who swept the\r\ncoasts of the Hebrides and swarmed in the Irish Seas. Being fugitives\r\nfrom their country, and outlaws of the new kingdom which Harald had\r\nsucceeded in establishing in Norway, they settled themselves permanently\r\nin the islands. Then they turned their haven of refuge into a base of\r\noperations for retaliatory warfare, harrying the coasts of Norway during\r\nthe summer months, and living at leisure in the islands during winter on\r\nthe plunder. At length King Harald, irritated by their incessant\r\nravages, collected a powerful fleet, and visiting Shetland, Orkney, and\r\nthe Hebrides, in succession, he swept their coasts clear of the\r\nplunderers, subduing the whole of the Northern and Western islands as\r\nfar south as Man.\r\n\r\nIn this expedition Ivar, a son of Rögnvald, Earl of Moeri, was\r\nkilled.[10] In order to recompense Rögnvald for the loss of his son,\r\nKing Harald bestowed on him the territory of the subjugated isles of\r\nOrkney and Shetland, with the title of Earl of the Orkneys. Harald seems\r\nto have dealt similarly with the Hebrides, but his conquest of the\r\nvikings in these remote isles was not so complete as in the Orkneys.\r\nKetil Flatnef (Flat nose), who, according to the Laxdæla Saga, had\r\nemigrated to the Hebrides because he could not resist King Harald in\r\nNorway, had married his daughter Aud to Olaf the White, the powerful\r\nking of Dublin, and had established himself in a kind of independent\r\nsovereignty in the Hebrides; and though he seems to have migrated from\r\nthem to Iceland in consequence of King Harald’s expedition, the\r\ncontinued hostility to King Harald’s rule is evinced by the fact that\r\nthe second earl whom he sent to the Hebrides, AsBjörn Skerablesi, was\r\nslain by two relatives of Ketil Flatnef, his wife and daughter taken\r\ncaptive, and the latter sold as a slave. Rögnvald, however, returned to\r\nhis own Earldom in Norway, and made over his newly-acquired possessions\r\nto his brother Sigurd, the “first earl” of the Saga.\r\n\r\n\r\n              IV. THE EARLDOM IN THE NORSE LINE, 872-1231.\r\n\r\n\r\nThorstein the Red, son of Olaf the White, king of Dublin, came then to\r\nthe north, and allying himself with Earl Sigurd, they crossed over to\r\nthe mainland of Scotland, and subdued Caithness and Sutherland as far as\r\nEkkialsbakki, and afterwards carried their conquests into Ross and\r\nMoray. In this invasion Earl Sigurd killed Maelbrigd the buck-toothed\r\n(Melbrigda tönn), a Scottish maormor of Ross or Moray; and having tied\r\nhis head to his saddle-bow, “the tooth,” which was very prominent,\r\ninflicted a wound on his leg, and the wound inflaming caused the death\r\nof the earl, who was hoy-laid (buried in a mound or cairn) on\r\nEkkialsbakki.[11] After his death, Thorstein the Red reigned as king\r\nover the conquered districts of Scotland, which at that time, says the\r\nLandnamabók,[12] comprehended “Caithness and Sutherland, Ross and Moray,\r\nand more than the half of Scotland.” The Laxdæla Saga[13] says that in\r\nhis engagements with the Scots Thorstein was always successful, “until\r\nat length he became reconciled with the King of the Scots, and obtained\r\npossession of the half of Scotland, over which he became king.” But he\r\nwas shortly afterwards slain in Caithness by the treachery of the Scots;\r\nand after his death Aud, his mother, migrated to Iceland. Previous to\r\nher departure she had given Groa, the daughter of Thorstein, in marriage\r\nto Duncan, earl or maormor of Duncansby in Caithness. Thus the Norse\r\nearldom of Caithness passed for a time into the family of one of its\r\nnative chiefs. But by the subsequent marriage of Grelauga, the daughter\r\nof Duncan and Groa, with Thorfinn Hausakliuf, son of Torf-Einar, Earl of\r\nOrkney, the Scottish earldom was again added to the earldom of the\r\nIsles.\r\n\r\nWhile Thorstein the Red ruled on the northern mainland of Scotland,\r\nGuttorm, the son of Sigurd Eysteinson, had succeeded to the Orkney\r\nearldom on the death of his father, but after having held it for one\r\nyear he died childless.\r\n\r\nMeantime, when Rögnvald, Earl of Moeri, heard in Norway of the death of\r\nhis brother Sigurd, he obtained a grant of the earldom of Orkney from\r\nKing Harald for his own son Hallad. Hallad found the Islands so much\r\ninfested by vikings that he soon gave up the earldom in disgust, and\r\nreturned to Norway, preferring the life of a farmer to that of an\r\nearl.[14]\r\n\r\nThen Rögnvald sent another son, Einar, to take possession of the\r\nearldom. Einar was a man of a different stamp from Hallad. He soon made\r\nhis power felt among the western vikings, and freed his possessions\r\nentirely from their ravages. The sons of Harald Harfagri, Halfdan Hálegg\r\nand Guthrod, grew up to be men of great violence. One spring they went\r\nnorth to Moeri and burnt Earl Rögnvald in his own house with sixty of\r\nhis men. Halfdan Hálegg then sailed west to Orkney to dispossess Einar\r\nof the earldom, but having allowed himself to be surprised by Einar, he\r\nwas captured in Rinansey, and killed by having a blood-eagle cut on his\r\nback.[15] Harald Harfagri came west, and fined the Orkneys in sixty\r\nmarks of gold for the death of his son. Earl Einar offered to the\r\nBœndr[16] that he would pay the money on condition that he should have\r\nall the odal possessions in the islands—a condition to which they agreed\r\nthe more readily, says the Saga, “that all the poorer men had but small\r\nlands, while those who were wealthy said they would redeem theirs when\r\nthey pleased.”[17] But the odal lands remained in the possession of the\r\nearl till Einar’s great-grandson, Sigurd Hlödverson, was obliged to buy\r\nthe assistance of the odallers against the Scots when hard pressed by\r\nthe Scottish earl Finnleik.[18]\r\n\r\nWhen Einar died he left three sons, two of whom, Arnkell and Erlend,\r\nwere killed with King Erik Bloodyaxe in England. The third, Thorfinn\r\nHausakliuf, married Grelauga, daughter of Duncan, earl of Duncansbay,\r\nand thus reunited in the Norse line the two earldoms of Orkney and\r\nCaithness. Earl Thorfinn Hausakliuf left five sons. Arnfinn, the eldest,\r\nwho was married to Ragnhild, a daughter of King Erik Bloodyaxe, was\r\nkilled by his wife at Myrkhol (Murkle) in Caithness. She then married\r\nHavard, his brother. She soon tired of him, and instigated Einar\r\nKlining, his sister’s son, to kill him. Havard fell in the fray at\r\nStennis, and was buried there.[19] Ragnhild had promised to marry Einar\r\nif he killed her husband Havard. When the deed was done, however, she\r\nrefused to perform her promise, and instigated another Einar, by the\r\npromise of her hand, to slay Einar Klining. This he did, but again\r\nRagnhild was faithless. Then she married Liot, the third son of Earl\r\nThorfinn Hausakliffer, and brother of the two husbands whom she had\r\nalready had and slain. Meanwhile Skuli, a fourth brother, had gone to\r\nScotland and obtained an earl’s title for Caithness from the King of\r\nScots.[20] He was defeated by Liot, and slain in the Dales of Caithness,\r\nand thus Liot became sole earl of Caithness and Orkney. He fell in\r\nbattle with a native chieftain, named Magbiód[21] in the Sagas, at Skida\r\nMyre[22] (Skitten) in Caithness, and was succeeded in the earldom by\r\nHlödver, the last of the five brothers.\r\n\r\nEarl Hlödver married Audna, the daughter of the Irish king Kiarval. He\r\ndied shortly after his accession to the earldom, and was buried at Hofn\r\n(Huna) in Caithness.[23] His son Sigurd, sometimes called “the Stout,”\r\nsucceeded him. He is said to have been a mighty warrior, and to have\r\ndriven the Scots completely from Caithness.[24] But he was not left in\r\nundisturbed possession of his Scottish earldom. The Scottish earl or\r\nmaormor, Finlay (MacRuari?) invaded Caithness and gave him battle at\r\nSkida Myre, where his uncle Liot had fallen before another Scottish\r\nmaormor not long previously. Finlay had so large a force that there were\r\nno less than seven Scotsmen to one of Sigurd’s men, and the Orkneymen\r\nwho were with Earl Sigurd were unwilling to fight against such odds.\r\nThen Sigurd offered to restore to the Bœndr their allodial lands, which\r\nthey had resigned to Earl Einar, his great-grandfather. By this means,\r\nmore than by the charmed raven-banner made for him by his Irish mother,\r\nhe obtained the victory. “After this,” says the Njal Saga,[25] “Earl\r\nSigurd became ruler over these dominions in Scotland, Ross and Moray,\r\nSutherland and the Dales” (of Caithness), which seem also to include the\r\nold Strathnaver. But his troubles with the Scots were not yet over.\r\nCaithness was invaded by two Scottish maormors, called Hundi and\r\nMelsnati in the Saga.[26] A battle took place at Duncansbay, in which\r\nMelsnati was slain, but Hundi fled, and the Norsemen, learning that\r\nanother Scottish earl, Malcolm, was assembling an army at Duncansbay,\r\ngave up the pursuit and returned to Orkney. Afterwards Sigurd became\r\nreconciled to Malcolm, King of the Scots, and obtained his daughter in\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nBut the most notable event in the life of Earl Sigurd was that which\r\nbefel him as he lay in the harbour of Osmondwall shortly after his\r\naccession to the earldom. Olaf Tryggvason, King of Norway, returning\r\nfrom a western cruise, happened to run his vessels into the same\r\nharbour, as the Pentland Firth was not to be passed that day. On hearing\r\nthat the earl was there he sent for him on board his ship, and told him,\r\nwithout much parley, that he must allow himself to be baptized, and make\r\nall his people profess the Christian faith. The Flateyjarbók says that\r\nthe king took hold of Sigurd’s boy, who chanced to be with him, and\r\ndrawing his sword, gave the earl the choice of renouncing for ever the\r\nfaith of his fathers, or of seeing his boy slain on the spot. In the\r\nposition in which he found himself placed, Sigurd became a nominal\r\nconvert, but there is every reason to believe that the Christianity\r\nwhich was thus forced upon the Islanders was for a long time more a name\r\nthan a reality. Nearly twenty years afterwards we find Earl Sigurd\r\nbearing his own raven-banner “woven with mighty spells,” at the battle\r\nof Clontarf, against the Christian king Brian; and Sigurd’s fall was\r\nmade known in Caithness by the twelve weird sisters (the Valkyriar of\r\nthe ancient mythology) weaving the woof of war:—[27]\r\n\r\n                       “The woof y-woven\r\n                        With entrails of men,\r\n                        The warp hardweighted\r\n                        With heads of the slain.”\r\n\r\nAn incident which occurred just before he set out for Ireland gives a\r\nstriking illustration of the fierce manners of the times. King Sigtrygg,\r\nwho had come from Dublin to obtain Earl Sigurd’s aid, was being\r\nentertained at the Yule-feast in Earl Sigurd’s hall in Hrossey (the\r\nMainland of Orkney), and was set on the high seat, having Earl Sigurd on\r\nthe one side and Earl Gilli, who had come with him, on the other. Gunnar\r\nLambi’s son was telling the company the story of the burning of Njal and\r\nhis comrades, but giving an unfair version of it, and every now and then\r\nlaughing out loud. It so happened that as, in answer to an inquiry of\r\nKing Sigtrygg’s how they bore the burning, he was saying that one of\r\nthem had given way to tears, one of Njal’s friends, Kari by name, who\r\nhad just arrived in Orkney, chanced to come into the hall. Hearing what\r\nwas said, Kari drew his sword, and smote Gunnar Lambi’s son on the neck\r\nwith such a sharp blow that his head spun off on to the board before the\r\nking and the earls, so that the board was all one gore of blood, and the\r\nearls’ clothing too. Earl Sigurd called out to seize Kari and kill him,\r\nbut no man stirred, and some spoke up for him, saying that he had only\r\ndone what he had a right to do, and so Kari walked away, and there was\r\nno hue and cry after him.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Clontarf, in which Earl Sigurd fell, is the most\r\ncelebrated of all the conflicts in which the Norsemen were engaged on\r\nthis side of the North Sea. “It was at Clontarf, in Brian’s battle,”\r\nsays Dasent, “that the old and new faiths met in the lists face to face\r\nfor their last struggle,” and we find Earl Sigurd arrayed on the side of\r\nthe old faith, though nominally a convert to the new. The Irish account\r\nof the battle[28] describes it as seen from the walls of Dublin, and\r\nlikens the carnage to a party of reapers cutting down a field of oats.\r\nSigurd is described as dealing out wounds and slaughter all around—“no\r\nedged weapon could harm him, and there was no strength that yielded not,\r\nand no thickness that became not thin before him.” Murcadh, son of Brian\r\nBorumha, was equally conspicuous on the side of the Irish. He had thrice\r\npassed through the phalanx of the foreigners, slaying a mail-clad man at\r\nevery stroke. Then perceiving Sigurd, he rushed at him, and by a blow of\r\nhis right-hand sword, cut the fastenings of his helmet, which fell back,\r\nand a second blow given with the left-hand sword cut into his neck, and\r\nstretched him lifeless on the field. In the Njal Saga the incidents\r\nconnected with Earl Sigurd’s death are differently related. His\r\nraven-banner, which was borne before him, was fulfilling the destiny\r\nannounced by Audna, when she gave it to him at Skida Myre, that it would\r\nalways bring victory to those before whom it was borne, but death to him\r\nwho bore it. Twice had the banner-bearer fallen, and Earl Sigurd called\r\non Thorstein, son of Hall of the Side, next to bear the banner.\r\nThorstein was about to lift it, when Asmund the White called out, “Don’t\r\nbear the banner, for all they who bear it get their death.” “Hrafn the\r\nRed!” cried Earl Sigurd, “bear thou the banner.” “Bear thine own devil\r\nthyself,” said Hrafn.[29] Then said the earl, “’Tis fittest that the\r\nbeggar should bear the bag,” and with that he took up the banner, and\r\nwas immediately pierced through with a spear. Then flight broke out\r\nthrough all the host.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of Earl Sigurd’s death reached Scotland King Malcolm gave\r\nthe earldom of Caithness to Thorfinn, his daughter’s son by Sigurd, then\r\nonly five years of age, and Sumarlidi, Brúsi, and Einar, Sigurd’s sons\r\nby his former marriage, divided the Orkneys between them. Sumarlidi soon\r\ndied, and Einar got his portion. Einar made himself unpopular by the\r\nviolence with which he exacted his services from the Bœndr for his\r\nviking expeditions, and was killed by Thorkel Fóstri (Amundi’s son) at\r\nSandwick, in Deerness. Brúsi then took possession of the whole earldom\r\nof the Orkneys, as Thorfinn had that of Caithness. Thorfinn, however,\r\nclaimed a share of the Islands, and as he had the assistance of his\r\ngrandfather Malcolm, the King of Scots, Brúsi felt himself unable to\r\ncope with him. He therefore went to Norway to negotiate with King Olaf\r\nHaraldson for a grant of the whole of the earldom of the Islands.\r\nThorfinn followed him on the same errand, but the king was more than a\r\nmatch for them both, and the result was that he gave each a third of the\r\nIslands, declaring the third which had belonged to Earl Einar to be\r\nforfeited to himself for the murder of his friend and henchman Eyvind\r\nUrarhorn, whom Einar had slain in revenge for Eyvind’s helping the Irish\r\nking Conchobhar against him at Ulfreksfiord. After Thorfinn’s departure,\r\nhowever, he gave Brúsi to understand that he was to have the forfeited\r\nthird of the earldom, as well as his own third, to enable him to hold\r\nhis own against Thorfinn. An arrangement was afterwards made between\r\nBrúsi and Thorfinn that the latter should receive two-thirds of the\r\nIslands on condition of his undertaking the defence of the whole, as\r\nthey were at that time much exposed to the predatory incursions of Norse\r\nand Danish vikings.\r\n\r\nWhen Thorfinn’s maternal grandfather, King Malcolm, died, Kali\r\nHundason[30] took the kingdom in Scotland. He attempted to exact tribute\r\nfrom Thorfinn for his dominions in the north of Scotland, and failing in\r\nthis he sent his sister’s son, Moddan, into Caithness, giving him the\r\ntitle of Earl. Thorfinn was supported by the inhabitants, however, and\r\nafter an unsuccessful attempt to establish himself in Caithness, Moddan\r\nreturned to King Kali with the news that Thorfinn was plundering in Ross\r\nand Sutherland. King Kali embarked a considerable force in eleven ships\r\nat Beruvik (apparently Berriedale on the southern frontier of\r\nCaithness), and sent Moddan northwards by land with another division of\r\nhis army, intending to enclose Thorfinn in the north-east corner of\r\nCaithness, and attack him from two sides at once. Thorfinn, however, was\r\naware of the trap laid for him, and retired to the Islands. There Kali\r\ncame up with him off Deerness, in Orkney, and a fierce battle took\r\nplace, in which Kali was defeated. He fled southwards, and Thorfinn,\r\nfollowing him, obliged him again to give battle at Baefiord, where he\r\nwas again defeated, while Thorkel Fóstri fell upon Moddan at Thurso and\r\nslew him. Then, say the Sagas, Earl Thorfinn overran Scotland as far\r\nsouth as Fife, burning and slaying, and subduing the land wherever he\r\nwent. By these conquests he became the most powerful of all the Earls of\r\nOrkney.\r\n\r\nRögnvald Brusison was in Norway when he heard of his father’s death, and\r\nbeing odal-born to his father’s third of the Islands, and having\r\nreceived from King Magnus Olafson a grant of that third which King Olaf\r\nhad declared forfeited to himself for Eyvind Urarhorn’s murder, he went\r\nwest to the Orkneys, prepared to maintain his rights against the claims\r\nof Thorfinn, who had taken possession of the whole. An amicable\r\narrangement was made between the kinsmen, and they joined their forces\r\nfor viking forays upon the Hebrides, venturing even upon an extensive\r\nforay in England during the absence of Hardicanute in Denmark. After an\r\neight years’ alliance, however, discord broke out between the kinsmen,\r\nand in a sea-fight in the Pentland Firth, off Rauda Biorg,[31] in\r\nCaithness, Rögnvald was defeated and fled, and Thorfinn reduced the\r\nwhole of the Islands. Rögnvald went to Norway, and stayed some time with\r\nKing Magnus. Then he came west to the Islands in a single ship, and\r\nsurprising Thorfinn in a house on the Mainland of Orkney, he set fire to\r\nit. Thorfinn broke down part of the wall of the house and leapt out,\r\ncarrying his wife Ingibiorg in his arms, and escaped through the smoke.\r\nRögnvald, believing that Thorfinn had perished, took possession of the\r\nIslands. Thorfinn, who had got secretly over to his dominions in\r\nCaithness, returned shortly afterwards, and surprising Rögnvald in a\r\nhouse on Papa Stronsay, burnt the house and all who were in it, except\r\nRögnvald, who sprang over the heads of the men who surrounded him, and\r\ngot away in the darkness. He concealed himself among the rocks by the\r\nshore, but was discovered by the barking of his dog, and slain by\r\nThorkel Fóstri. Thus Thorfinn was again sole ruler of the Orkney\r\nearldom, as well as that of Caithness. He went to Norway to make his\r\npeace with King Magnus, who was foster-brother to Earl Rögnvald, and\r\ntherefore would seek vengeance for his death. At that time Magnus was at\r\nwar with Swein Ulfson, King of Denmark. While he lay with his fleet at\r\nSeley two war-ships rowed up to the king’s vessel, and a man in a white\r\ncloak went straight aboard, and up to the quarter-deck, where the king\r\nsat at meat. Saluting the king, the man reached forth his hand, took a\r\nloaf from the table, broke it, and ate of it. The king handed the cup to\r\nhim when he saw that he had broken bread at his table, and then he\r\nlearned that it was Earl Thorfinn, who, having broken his bread and\r\ndrunk from his cup, was, for the present at least, safe from his\r\nvengeance, according to the ancient laws of hospitality. He deemed it\r\nwise, however, to take his departure without having obtained a formal\r\nreconciliation. King Magnus died shortly afterwards, and was succeeded\r\nby his uncle Harald Hardradi. Thorfinn again went to Norway on hearing\r\nof King Magnus’ death, and effected a reconciliation with King Harald,\r\nso that he was now established in the earldom of Orkney by consent of\r\nthe over-lord, the King of Norway.\r\n\r\nFrom Norway he went to Denmark, visiting King Swein at Aalborg, and\r\nproceeded thence through Germany on a pilgrimage to Rome, where he\r\nobtained absolution for all his deeds. After his return from Rome it is\r\nsaid that he turned his mind more to the government of his dominions and\r\nthe welfare of his people than he had previously done in his career of\r\nconquest. He built Christ’s Kirk in Birsay, and established there the\r\nfirst bishop’s see in the Orkneys. He died in 1064, having been Earl, by\r\nthe Saga account, for “seventy winters,” and the most powerful and\r\nwide-landed of all the Earls of the Orkneys. After his death, as the\r\nSaga states, his widow Ingibiorg was married to King Malcolm\r\nCanmore,[32] and became the mother of Duncan, whom, however, the\r\nScottish historians have always represented as a bastard.\r\n\r\nThorfinn was succeeded by his two sons, Paul and Erlend, who were with\r\nKing Harald Hardradi in his unfortunate expedition to England. After the\r\nbattle of Stamford Bridge, in which King Harald fell, the Orkney earls\r\nwere allowed to go home by the victorious Harold Godwinson, and they\r\nruled their dominions jointly in great harmony till their sons grew up\r\nto manhood, when there began to be discord between the families. Hakon,\r\nthe son of Paul, was of a turbulent and overbearing disposition. He\r\nseems to have had a lingering attachment to the Pagan faith of his\r\nforefathers, for, while in Sweden (which was longer in being converted\r\nto Christianity than Norway), he is said to have sought out the Pagan\r\nspaemen to learn his future from them. Coming to Norway he tried hard to\r\ninduce King Magnus Barelegs to undertake an expedition to the Orkneys\r\nand the Western Isles, hoping that the king would conquer the Islands\r\nfor the glory of the conquest, and hand them over to him, as Harald\r\nHarfagri had given them to Rögnvald, Earl of Mœri. He was more\r\nsuccessful than he anticipated. King Magnus, fired with the love of\r\nconquest, did make the expedition, but he deposed Paul and Erlend, and\r\ncarried them to Norway, placing his own son Sigurd, a mere child, over\r\nthe Orkneys.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Saga speaks as if there had been only one expedition by\r\nKing Magnus to Scotland, there were in reality three. Fordun[33] states\r\nthat when Donald Bane, Duncan, and Edgar, were struggling for the\r\nkingdom on the death of Malcolm in 1093, King Magnus was ravaging the\r\ngulfs of the Scottish seaboard, and it is stated in the Saga[34] that he\r\nassisted Murcertach in the capture of Dublin in 1094. In his second\r\nexpedition in 1098 he carried off the Earls Paul and Erlend, and made\r\nhis own son Sigurd Earl of Orkney. Munch surmises that the motives of\r\nthis expedition were two-fold—to secure his power in the Orkneys, and to\r\nassist his protégé Donald Bane, who had again usurped the crown of\r\nScotland on the death of Duncan in 1095, and was in 1097 hard pressed by\r\nEdgar with an English army. King Magnus took with him from the Orkneys\r\nMagnus Erlend’s son (afterwards St. Magnus), and proceeded southwards to\r\nthe Hebrides, where he ravaged Lewis, Skye, Uist, Tiree, and Mull,\r\nsparing Iona on account of its sanctity. The Saga says that he opened\r\nthe door of the little church of Columbkill (St. Oran’s chapel), and was\r\nabout to enter, but stopped suddenly, closed the door, forbade any one\r\nto enter, and gave the inhabitants peace. Then he went on to Isla and\r\nKintyre, and thence to Man and Anglesea, where he fought the battle with\r\nthe two Hughs, Earls of Chester and Shrewsbury. On his return northward\r\nhe caused his vessel to be drawn across the isthmus of Tarbert, in\r\nimitation of the fabulous sea-king Beite, of whom a similar story is\r\ntold. He returned to Norway in 1099, and during the next two years was\r\noccupied with the Swedish war. In 1102 he returned to the west, married\r\nhis son Sigurd to Biadmynia, the daughter of Murcertach, and fell in a\r\nskirmish with the Irish in Ulster in 1103. He was buried in St.\r\nPatrick’s church in Down.[35]\r\n\r\nSigurd, the son of King Magnus, remained Earl of the Orkneys until his\r\nfather’s death, when he succeeded to the throne of Norway.\r\n\r\nHakon Paul’s son, and Magnus Erlend’s son, then succeeded to the\r\nearldom, and held it jointly until Magnus was murdered in Egilsey by\r\nHakon on the 16th April, A.D. 1115.[36]\r\n\r\nAfter the murder of Magnus, Hakon became sole earl. He went on a\r\npilgrimage to Rome and the Holy Land, and after his return became a good\r\nruler, and was so popular “that the Orkneymen desired no other rulers\r\nthan Hakon and his issue.”\r\n\r\nEarl Hakon left two sons, Harald and Paul (the silent). Harald, who had\r\nsucceeded to the earldom of Caithness, which “he held from the King of\r\nScots,” was in some way unintentionally put to death by his mother Helga\r\nand her sister Frákork. As the Saga tells the story, he met his death by\r\ninsisting on putting on a poisoned shirt which the sisters intended for\r\nhis half-brother Paul, who, on Harald’s death, became sole Earl of the\r\nOrkneys.\r\n\r\nA new claimant arose, however, in the person of Kali, son of Kol, a\r\nnobleman resident at Agdir, in Norway, who had married a sister of Earl\r\nMagnus the saint. Kali received from King Sigurd the gift of half the\r\nOrkneys, which had belonged to his uncle Magnus, and his name was\r\nchanged from Kali Kolson to Rögnvald, because his mother said that\r\nRögnvald Brusison was the most accomplished of all the Earls of Orkney,\r\nand thought the name would bring her son good fortune.\r\n\r\nRögnvald had many romantic adventures in the prosecution of his attempt\r\nto obtain possession of half of the earldom held by Paul, which are\r\ndetailed at length in the Saga. At last he was advised by his father Kol\r\nto make a vow to St. Magnus, that if he should succeed in establishing\r\nhimself in the Orkneys he would build and endow a “stone minster” at\r\nKirkwall, dedicated to St. Magnus, “to whom the half of the earldom\r\nrightly belonged.” The vow was made, and Rögnvald’s next expedition was\r\nsuccessful. He landed in Shetland, and by a dexterous stratagem the\r\nbeacons on Fair Isle and in the Orkneys were made to give a false alarm\r\nof his descent upon the Orkneys, so that when he did land there he was\r\nunopposed. Then he secured the intervention of the bishop, and an\r\nagreement that he should have half the Islands was concluded between him\r\nand Earl Paul. Shortly thereafter Earl Paul was captured by Swein\r\nAsleifson, a notable leader at that time in the Islands, and the last\r\nand greatest of the Orkney vikings. Swein carried the earl off in his\r\nvessel, and, landing him on the southern shore of the Moray Firth,\r\ndelivered him into the safe keeping of Maddad, Earl of Athole,[37] who\r\nwas married to Margaret, a sister of Earl Paul. What became of the earl\r\nis not known, “but this,” says the Saga, “is well known, that he came\r\nnever again to the Orkneys, and had no dominions in Scotland.” Swein\r\nAsleifson returned to Orkney, and by the joint consent of Earl Rögnvald,\r\nBishop William of Orkney, and Bishop John of Athole, Harald, the son of\r\nMaddad, earl of Athole, was made Earl, along with Rögnvald, though he\r\nwas at that time a child of only five years old. This arrangement was\r\nafterwards confirmed by a meeting, held in Caithness, of the Bœndr and\r\nchiefs of the Orkneys and Caithness.\r\n\r\nThe Earls Rögnvald and Harald visited King Ingi by invitation at Bergen,\r\nand there Earl Rögnvald met with Eindridi Ungi, a returned Crusader, and\r\nbecame possessed by a strong desire to visit the Holy Land. On his\r\nreturn voyage to Orkney, Earl Rögnvald was shipwrecked at Gulberwick in\r\nShetland, and narrowly escaped with his life. Bishop William strongly\r\napproved of his project to go on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and\r\nagreed to accompany him. Accordingly he went back to Norway to organise\r\nthe expedition, and returned to the Orkneys followed by a large number\r\nof Jorsala-farers—mostly adventurers of very indifferent character, if\r\nwe are to judge by their turbulent and lawless behaviour during their\r\nstay in the Orkneys, where they spent the winter previous to their\r\ndeparture for the East. Early in the spring of the year 1152 Earl\r\nRögnvald called a Thing-meeting of the inhabitants of the Islands, and\r\ntold them of his purposed voyage, announcing that he was to leave the\r\nsole government in the hands of Harald during his absence, and asking\r\nthem all to obey him and help him faithfully as their lawful lord. The\r\nsummer was far advanced before he sailed, but he had a prosperous\r\nvoyage, the adventures of which are detailed in the Saga; and after\r\nvisiting Jerusalem and bathing in the Jordan, he returned by way of\r\nConstantinople, Durazzo, Apulia, and Rome, and so overland to Norway,\r\nthe whole expedition occupying about three years.\r\n\r\nIn the same summer that Earl Rögnvald left the Orkneys on his\r\npilgrimage, King Eystein came from Norway with a large force, and\r\nseizing Earl Harald Maddadson as he lay at Thurso with a single ship,\r\nmade him pay a ransom of three marks of gold, and swear fealty to him\r\nfor Orkney and Shetland. Earl Maddad of Athole was now dead, and\r\nMargaret, the mother of Earl Harald, had come to the Orkneys. Erlend,\r\nthe son of the Earl Harald (Slettmali), who was killed by the poisoned\r\nshirt, had set up his claim to half the earldom after Rögnvald’s\r\ndeparture. His cause was favoured by King Eystein, and espoused by Swein\r\nAsleifson, and Earl Harald was obliged to make peace by taking oath to\r\nallow Erlend to remain in possession of the Islands, an arrangement\r\nwhich was afterwards confirmed by a Thing-meeting of the Bœndr of the\r\nOrkneys, Earl Rögnvald’s claim to his share of the Islands being,\r\nhowever, reserved. Earl Harald (Maddadson) was thus denuded of all power\r\nin the Islands. He fled across to Caithness, but after a time he\r\nreturned to the Orkneys with four ships and a hundred men, and after an\r\nunsuccessful attempt to surprise Erlend[38] he was obliged to abandon\r\nthe enterprise for a time. Meanwhile, Erlend had carried off Harald’s\r\nmother Margaret (who seems to have been still a beautiful woman, though\r\nof very indifferent character), and fled with her to the island of Mousa\r\nin Shetland, where they fortified themselves in the old Pictish tower or\r\nborg of Mousa, which about two centuries before had given shelter during\r\na whole winter to a pair of lovers from Norway, under circumstances\r\nsomewhat similar.[39] Harald pursued them, and laid siege to the borg,\r\nwhich could not be taken by assault, but the two earls came to a mutual\r\nunderstanding, and the siege was abandoned. Erlend married Margaret, and\r\nthe same summer he and Harald went each on a visit to Norway to meet\r\nEarl Rögnvald on his return from the Holy Land.\r\n\r\nErlend succeeded in making an alliance with Earl Rögnvald. Earl Harald\r\nwas not aware of this till he returned from Norway, and heard the news\r\nin Orkney. He and Rögnvald met at Thurso, and a skirmish took place\r\nbetween their respective followers, in which thirteen of Rögnvald’s men\r\nwere slain, but by the efforts of their mutual friends the two earls\r\nwere brought to an agreement of peace. Erlend and his faithful ally\r\nSwein Asleifson surprised the squadron of the two earls at Scapa, taking\r\nfourteen ships, and putting both the earls to flight. They crossed over\r\nto Caithness during the night, each in a separate boat, and returning\r\nsome time after with a fresh force, they surprised Erlend in Damsey, and\r\nslew him. Then they made peace with Erlend’s old ally, Swein Asleifson,\r\nalthough this was not effected without some difficulty. Harald and\r\nRögnvald then ruled the two earldoms jointly, and apparently in great\r\nharmony, until the death of the latter in 1158. Rögnvald was slain at\r\nCalder, in Caithness, by Thorbiörn Klerk, the former friend and\r\ncounsellor of Earl Harald, who had been made an outlaw by Earl Rögnvald\r\nfor a murder committed in Kirkwall, following on a series of acts of\r\nviolence.[40]\r\n\r\nEarl Harald Maddadson now became sole ruler of the earldoms of Orkney\r\nand Caithness. But by his second marriage he had allied himself with\r\nHoarflad (Gormlath), daughter of Malcolm MacHeth, the so-called Earl of\r\nMoray, ex-bishop Wimund, and pretender to the Scottish throne, and\r\nconsequently there could be no pacific relations between him and King\r\nWilliam the Lion. The events of this period are somewhat confusedly told\r\nin the chronicles, but it seems probable that Harald was one of the six\r\nearls who rebelled against King Malcolm in 1160, in order to place\r\nWilliam of Egremont, grandson of Duncan, on the throne,[41] and that he\r\nalso supported Donaldbane, the son of William who aspired to the throne,\r\nand from 1180 maintained himself in Moray and Ross, till he was slain at\r\nthe battle of Macgarvey, 1187.[42] When Harald Ungi, son of Eirik\r\nSlagbrellir, by Ingigerd (or Ingirid), daughter of Earl Rögnvald,\r\nappeared as a rival claimant to the earldom of Orkney, having received\r\nfrom King Magnus Erlingson a grant of his grandfather’s share of the\r\nIslands, King William embraced his interests, and gave him a grant of\r\nhalf of Caithness, which was thus taken from Earl Harald. Then Earl\r\nHarald became involved in difficulties with his other suzerain, the\r\nreigning King of Norway, through the expedition of the Eyarskeggiar or\r\npartisans of Sigurd, son of Magnus Erlingson, whom they endeavoured to\r\nplace upon the throne in opposition to King Sverrir. Sigurd’s cause was\r\nlargely espoused by the Orkneymen, and the expedition (which was\r\norganised and fitted out in Orkney) did much mischief in Norway. Earl\r\nHarald was obliged to present himself before King Sverrir in Bergen. He\r\nwent from Orkney accompanied by Bishop Bjarni. In presence of a great\r\nassembly in the Christ’s Kirk garth, the earl confessed his fault,\r\nsaying that he was now an old man, as his beard bore witness; that he\r\nhad bent the knee before many kings, sometimes in closest friendship,\r\nbut oftener in circumstances of misfortune; that he had not been\r\nunfaithful to his allegiance, although some of his people might have\r\ndone that which was contrary to the king’s interests; and that he had\r\nnot been always able to rule the Orkneys entirely according to his own\r\nwill; and that now he came to yield up himself and all his possessions\r\ninto the king’s power. So saying, he advanced, and casting himself to\r\nthe earth, he laid his head at King Sverrir’s feet. The king granted him\r\npardon, but took from him the whole of Shetland,[43] “which never after\r\nthat formed part of the Norwegian earldom of Orkney,” though after the\r\ntime of the Saga-writer, Shetland as well as Orkney was granted to Henry\r\nSt. Clair in 1379 by King Hakon Magnusson, the second of that name.\r\n\r\nYet though humiliated in this manner, and stripped of a great part of\r\nhis dominions, Earl Harald, according to Hoveden, dared to contest the\r\npossession of Moray with King William, instigated no doubt by his wife,\r\nin whose right alone he could have had any feasible claim to its\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nRoger de Hoveden, chaplain to Henry II., a contemporary chronicler, thus\r\nrecords the events that followed:—[44]\r\n\r\n“In the same year (1196) William, King of Scots, having gathered a great\r\narmy, entered Moray to drive out Harald MacMadit, who had occupied that\r\ndistrict. But before the king could enter Caithness, Harald fled to his\r\nships, not wishing to risk a battle with the king. Then the King of\r\nScots sent his army to Turseha (Thurso), the town of the aforesaid\r\nHarald, and destroyed his castle there. But Harald, seeing that the king\r\nwould completely devastate the country, came to the king’s feet and\r\nplaced himself at his mercy, chiefly because of a raging tempest in the\r\nsea, and the wind being contrary, so that he could not go to the\r\nOrkneys; and he promised the king that he would bring to him all his\r\nenemies when the king should again return to Moray. On that condition\r\nthe king permitted him to retain a half of Caithness, and the other half\r\nhe gave to Harald, the younger, grandson of Reginald (Rögnvald), a\r\nformer Earl of Orkney and Caithness. Then the king returned to his own\r\nland, and Harald to the Orkneys. The king returned in the autumn to\r\nMoray, as far as Ilvernarran (Invernairn), in order to receive the\r\nking’s enemies from Harald. But though Harald had brought them as far as\r\nthe port of Lochloy near Invernairn, he allowed them to escape; and when\r\nthe king returned late from hunting, Harald came to him, bringing with\r\nhim two boys, his grandchildren, to deliver them to the king as\r\nhostages. Being asked by the king where were the king’s enemies whom he\r\nhad promised to deliver up, and where was Thorfinn his son, whom he had\r\nalso promised to give as a hostage, he replied, ‘I allowed them to\r\nescape, knowing that if I delivered them up to you they would not escape\r\nout of your hands. My son I could not bring, for there is no other heir\r\nto my lands.’ So, because he had not kept the agreement which he had\r\nmade with the king, he was adjudged to remain in the king’s custody\r\nuntil his son should arrive and become a hostage for him. And because he\r\nhad permitted the king’s enemies to escape, he was also adjudged to have\r\nforfeited those lands which he held of the king. The king took Harald\r\nwith him to Edinburgh Castle, and laid him in chains until his men\r\nbrought his son Thorfinn from the Orkneys; and on their delivering him\r\nup as a hostage to the king, Harald was liberated.\r\n\r\n“So Harald returned to Orkney, and there remained in peace and quiet,\r\nuntil Harald the younger, having received a grant of the half of the\r\nOrkneys from Sverrir Birkebein, the King of Norway, joined himself to\r\nSigurd Murt, and many other warriors, and invaded Orkney. Harald the\r\nelder, being unwilling to engage with him in battle, left the Orkneys\r\nand fled to the Isle of Man. He was followed by Harald the younger, but\r\nHarald the elder had left Man before his arrival there, and gone by\r\nanother way to the Orkneys with his fleet, and there he killed all the\r\nadherents of the younger Harald whom he found in the Islands. Harald the\r\nyounger returned to Caithness to Wick, where he engaged in battle with\r\nHarald the elder, and in that battle Harald the younger and all his army\r\nwere slain. Harald the elder then went to the King of Scots, on the safe\r\nconduct of Roger and Reginald, the bishops of St. Andrews and\r\nRosemarkie, and took to the king a large sum in gold and silver for the\r\nredemption of his lands of Caithness. The king said he would give him\r\nback Caithness if he would put away his wife (Gormlath), the daughter of\r\nMalcolm MacHeth, and take back his first wife, Afreka, the sister of\r\nDuncan, Earl of Fife, and deliver up to him as a hostage Laurentius his\r\npriest,[45] and Honaver the son of Ingemund, as hostages. But this\r\nHarald was unwilling to do; therefore came Reginald, son of Sumarlid,\r\nKing of Man and the Isles, to William, King of Scots, and purchased from\r\nhim Caithness, saving the king’s annual tribute.”\r\n\r\nReginald, being supplied with auxiliary forces from Ireland by his\r\nbrother-in-law, John of Courcy, overran Caithness, and, returning home,\r\nleft the conquered earldom in charge of three deputies. Harald procured\r\nthe murder of one of them, and then, coming over from Orkney with a\r\nstrong force, landed at Scrabster, where the bishop met him and\r\nendeavoured to mollify him. But Harald had a special grudge against\r\nBishop John, which added to his rage at what he considered the defection\r\nof his Caithness subjects. The bishop had refused to collect from the\r\npeople of Caithness a tax of one penny annually from each inhabited\r\nhouse, which Earl Harald had some years previously granted to the papal\r\nrevenues. Accordingly he stormed the “borg” at Scrabster, in which the\r\nbishop and the principal men of the district had taken refuge, slew\r\nalmost all that were in it, and caused the bishop to be blinded and his\r\ntongue to be cut out.[46] The two remaining deputies of King Reginald\r\nfled to the King of Scots, whose first act was to take revenge on\r\nHarald’s son Thorfinn. He was blinded and castrated after the barbarous\r\nmanner of the times, and died miserably in the dungeon of Roxburgh\r\nCastle. King William, then collecting a great army, marched north to\r\nEysteinsdal on the borders of Caithness in the spring of 1202. Though\r\nHarald had collected a force of 6000 men, he felt himself unable to cope\r\nwith the king, and was obliged to sue for peace, which was obtained on\r\nthe hard condition of the payment of every fourth penny to be found in\r\nCaithness, amounting to 2000 marks of silver.\r\n\r\nEarl Harald’s career was now drawing to a close. He died in 1206, at the\r\nadvanced age of seventy-three, having had the earldom for twenty years\r\njointly with Earl Rögnvald, and forty-eight years after Rögnvald’s\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nHis sons John and David succeeded him, and ruled jointly for seven\r\nyears, when David died and John became sole Earl of Orkney and\r\nCaithness. The most notable event of his time was the burning of Bishop\r\nAdam at Halkirk in Caithness.\r\n\r\nBishop Adam was a man of low birth. According to the Saga he was a\r\nfoundling, and had been exposed at a church door. Previous to his\r\nconsecration to the see of Caithness, in 1214, he had been Abbot of\r\nMelrose.[47] He arbitrarily increased the exaction of the bishop’s seat\r\nto such an extent that the populace rose in a body, and proceeding\r\ntumultuously to Halkirk, where he was residing, demanded abatement of\r\nthe unjust exactions. Earl John, who was in the neighbourhood at the\r\ntime, declined to interfere, and the exasperated populace, finding the\r\nbishop indisposed to treat them more liberally, first killed his\r\nadviser, Serlo, a monk of Newbottle, and then burnt the bishop. In the\r\nquaint language of Wyntoun—\r\n\r\n               “Thre hundyre men in cumpany\r\n                Gaddyrt on hym suddanly,\r\n                Tuk hym owt quhare that he lay\r\n                Of his chawmyre befor day,\r\n                Modyr naked hys body bare;\r\n                Thai band hym, dang hym, and woundyt sair\r\n                In-to the nycht or day couth dawe.\r\n                The monk thai slwe thare, hys falawe,\r\n                And the child that in hys chawmyr lay,\r\n                Thare thai slwe hym before day.\r\n                Hymself bwndyn and wowndyt syne\r\n                Thai pwt hym in hys awyn kychyne,\r\n                In thair felny and thare ire\r\n                Thare thai brynt hym in a fyre.”\r\n\r\nThe Saga tells that when the tidings of this outrage reached King\r\nAlexander he was greatly enraged, and that the terrible vengeance he\r\ntook was still fresh in memory when the Saga was written. Fordun states\r\nthat the king had the perpetrators of this deed mangled in limb and\r\nracked with many a torture. The Icelandic Annals are more precise. They\r\nsay that he caused the hands and feet to be hewn from eighty of the men\r\nwho had been present at the burning, and that many of them died in\r\nconsequence.\r\n\r\nWith this tragic and ill-omened event the chequered history of the line\r\nof the Norse Earls draws to a close. Earl John sought to clear himself\r\nfrom the guilt of complicity in the murder of the bishop by the\r\ntestimony of “good men” that he had no hand in it; but seeing that he\r\nhad neither assisted the bishop nor sought to punish his murderers, he\r\nwas heavily fined by King Alexander, and deprived of part of his\r\nScottish earldom. Subsequently he had an interview with the king at\r\nForfar, and bought back his lands. In the summer of 1224 he was summoned\r\nby King Hakon to Norway, having fallen under suspicion of a desire to\r\naid the designs of Earl Skule against Hakon’s power in Norway; and after\r\na conference with the king at Bergen he returned to Orkney, leaving his\r\nonly son Harald behind him as a hostage. In 1226 Harald was drowned at\r\nsea, probably on his passage home from Norway. In 1231, Earl John having\r\nbecome involved in a feud with Hanef Ungi, a commissioner whom King\r\nHakon had sent over to the Orkneys, Snækoll Gunnason, grandson of Earl\r\nRögnvald (Kali Kolson), and Aulver Illteit, they attacked him suddenly\r\nin an inn at Thurso, set fire to the house, and slew him in the cellar,\r\nwhere he had sought to conceal himself.\r\n\r\nThus the ancient line of the Norse Earls, that had ruled the Orkneys\r\nsince 872—a period of 350 years—became extinct, and the earldom passed\r\ninto the possession of the house of Angus.\r\n\r\n\r\n              V. THE EARLDOM IN THE ANGUS LINE—1231-1312.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the failure of the line of the Norse Earls by the death of Earl John\r\nin 1231, King Alexander II. of Scotland, in 1232, granted the earldom of\r\nNorth Caithness to Magnus,[48] the second son of Gilbride, Earl of\r\nAngus. Sutherland, or the southern land of Caithness, was now made a\r\nseparate earldom, and given to William, son of Hugh Freskyn, who was\r\nthus the first of the Earls of Sutherland.\r\n\r\nMagnus seems to have been confirmed in the earldom of Orkney by the King\r\nof Norway; but from this time the notices of Orkney and its earls in the\r\nIcelandic or Norwegian records are so few and obscure, that but little\r\nis to be gathered from them. The Iceland Annals, however, record the\r\ndeath of Magnus, Earl of Orkney, in 1239.\r\n\r\nIn the Diploma of Bishop Thomas Tulloch, drawn up _circa_ 1443,[49] it\r\nis stated that this Magnus was succeeded by Earl Gilbride, to whom\r\nsucceeded Gilbride his son, who held both the earldoms of Orkney and\r\nCaithness in Scotland. The Annals only notice one Gilbride, whom they\r\ncall “Gibbon, Earl of Orkney.” His death is placed in the year 1256.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Diploma, Gilbride had one son, Magnus, and a daughter,\r\nMatilda. This Magnus is mentioned in the Saga of Hakon Hakonson as\r\naccompanying the ill-fated expedition of that monarch against Scotland\r\nin 1263. “With King Hakon from Bergen went Magnus, Earl of Orkney, and\r\nthe king gave him a good long-ship.” Pilots had previously been procured\r\nfrom the Orkneys, and the fleet, after being two nights at sea with a\r\ngentle wind, put into Bressay Sound in Shetland, where they remained\r\nnearly half a month. Then they sailed for the Orkneys, and lay for some\r\ntime in Elwick Bay, opposite Inganess, near Kirkwall. Then they moved\r\nround South Ronaldsay, and lay some time in Ronaldsvoe, while men were\r\nsent over to Caithness to levy a contribution from the inhabitants,[50]\r\nof which the scald sings that “he imposed tribute on the dwellers on the\r\nNess, who were terrified by the steel-clad exactor of rings.” Ordering\r\nthe Orkneymen to follow him as soon as they were ready, the king sailed\r\nsouth to Lewis and Skye, where he was joined by Magnus, King of Man. The\r\nfleet, which now consisted of more than a hundred vessels, for the most\r\npart large and all well equipped, was divided into two squadrons, one of\r\nwhich, consisting of fifty ships, plundered the coasts of Kintyre and\r\nMull, rejoining King Hakon at Gigha. A detached squadron now plundered\r\nBute, and the fleet cast anchor in Arran Sound, from which King Hakon\r\nsent Gilbert, Bishop of Hamar, and Henry, Bishop of Orkney, with three\r\nother envoys, to treat for peace with the Scottish King. The\r\nnegotiations failed, and soon after the fleet was disabled by a storm,\r\nand the power of the Norwegian King utterly broken in the battle of\r\nLargs. King Hakon, gathering together the shattered remnants of his\r\nfleet and army, retired slowly northwards, meeting with no impediment\r\nuntil they arrived off Durness, in Sutherlandshire, when the wind fell\r\ncalm, and the fleet steered into the sound, where seven men of a boat’s\r\ncrew, who had been sent ashore for water, were killed by the Scots. In\r\npassing through the Pentland Firth one vessel went down with all on\r\nboard in the “Swelkie,” a dangerous whirlpool in certain states of the\r\ntide, and another was carried by the current helplessly through the\r\nFirth, and made straight for Norway. King Hakon laid up his fleet in\r\nMidland Harbour and Scapa Bay. He then rode to Kirkwall, and lay down to\r\ndie. He was lodged in the bishop’s palace, and after having been\r\nconfined to his bed for some days, he recovered so much that he attended\r\nmass in the bishop’s chapel, and walked to the cathedral to visit the\r\nshrine of St. Magnus. But there came a relapse, and he was again laid\r\nprostrate. He caused the Bible and Latin books to be read to him to\r\nbeguile the tedium of the sick bed, until he was no longer able to bear\r\nthe fatigue of reflecting on what he heard; and then he desired that\r\nNorwegian books should be read to him night and day—first the Sagas of\r\nthe Saints, and then the Chronicles of the Kings, from Halfdan the Black\r\nthrough all the succession of the Kings of Norway. Then he set his\r\naffairs in order, caused his silver plate to be weighed out to pay his\r\ntroops, and received the sacrament. He died at midnight on Saturday,\r\n15th December 1263. On Sunday the corpse, clothed in the richest\r\ngarments, with a garland on the head, was laid in state in the upper\r\nhall of the palace. The king’s chamberlains stood round it with tapers,\r\nand all day long the people came to view the remains of their king. The\r\nnobles kept watch over the bier through the night; and on Monday the\r\nroyal remains were borne to St. Magnus’ Cathedral, where they lay in\r\nstate all that night. On Tuesday they were temporarily interred in the\r\nchoir of the church, near the steps leading to the shrine of St. Magnus.\r\nBefore his death the king had given directions that his body should be\r\ncarried east to Norway, and buried beside the remains of his father and\r\nhis relatives in Bergen. In the month of March the corpse was exhumed\r\nand conveyed to Scapa, where it was placed on board the great ship in\r\nwhich he had sailed on the unfortunate expedition to Largs, and taken to\r\nBergen, where it was interred in the choir of Christ’s Church.\r\n\r\nMagnus Gilbride’s son, who was Earl of Orkney at the time of King\r\nHakon’s expedition, died (according to the Annals) in 1273.\r\n\r\nHe was succeeded by a son of the same name. The Annals have the entry\r\nunder the year 1276:—“Magnus, King of Norway, gave to Magnus, son of\r\nEarl Magnus of Orkney, the title of Earl, at Tunsberg.” He appears also\r\nas Earl of Orkney in the document, dated 5th February 1283, declaring\r\nMargaret, the Maiden of Norway, the nearest heir to the Scottish\r\nthrone.[51] The death of Earl Magnus, Magnus’ son, is recorded in the\r\nyear 1284,[52] along with that of Bishop Peter of Orkney and Sturla the\r\nLawman. The Diploma states that he died without issue, and was succeeded\r\nby his brother John in the earldom of Orkney and Caithness.\r\n\r\nJohn, as Earl of Caithness, appears in 1289 as one of the signatories to\r\nthe letter addressed by the nobles to King Edward of England proposing\r\nthat the young Prince Edward should marry Margaret, the Maid of Norway.\r\nHis name also occurs in the list of those summoned to attend the first\r\nparliament of Balliol. He swore fealty to King Edward at Murkle in\r\nCaithness, in 1297.\r\n\r\nKing Eirik of Norway in 1281 had married the Scottish princess Margaret,\r\ndaughter of Alexander III. She died in 1283, leaving one daughter,\r\nMargaret, “the Maid of Norway,” who became sole heiress to the crown of\r\nScotland, and in 1289 was formally betrothed to Prince Edward of\r\nEngland. She died at sea off the coast of Orkney,[53] on her way to\r\nScotland, in September or October 1290. There is no record of the\r\ncircumstances of her death,[54] but we learn from a letter of Bishop\r\nAudfinn of Bergen,[55] written twenty years after the event in\r\nconnection with the case of the false Margaret, who was burned at Bergen\r\nin 1301 (as will be detailed hereafter), that her remains were brought\r\nback to Bergen in charge of the Bishop (most probably of the Orkneys)\r\nand Herr Thore Hakonson, whose wife, Ingibiorg Erlingsdatter, was\r\nMargaret’s attendant on the voyage. In 1293 Eirik married Isabel, who is\r\nstyled in the Iceland Annals “daughter of Sir Robert, son of Robert,\r\nEarl of Brus.”[56] It appears that on the 24th of July of that year King\r\nEdward gave permission to Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrick, the father of\r\nIsabella Bruce, to go to Norway,[57] and to remain there for a time; and\r\nMunch, the Norwegian historian, conjectures that he had then brought\r\nover his daughter, and stayed till the marriage took place,[58] and that\r\nKing Eirik may have hoped by this alliance to bring the crown of\r\nScotland once more into the possession of a branch of his own royal\r\nline. In 1297 Isabella bore him a daughter named Ingibiorg. King Eirik\r\ndied 13th July 1299, and was succeeded by his brother Hakon (Magnusson).\r\n\r\nJohn, Earl of Orkney, seems to have gone to Norway to take the oath of\r\nallegiance to King Hakon immediately after his accession, for we find in\r\nthe Icelandic Annals that he was betrothed to King Eirik’s daughter in\r\n1299. The statement is explicit, and though it may seem strange to us\r\nthat an infant scarcely two years of age should be betrothed to a man of\r\nforty, Munch makes the remark that such unlikely contracts were by no\r\nmeans so unusual in those days as to oblige us to discredit the\r\nstatement. In fact, we find this same King Hakon betrothing his own\r\ndaughter when an infant of one year to a man who, though he was much\r\nyounger than Earl John, was nevertheless a full-grown man. But Earl John\r\nseems to have died shortly after the betrothal, for we find that\r\nIngibiorg was betrothed anew in 1311, and John’s successor in the\r\nearldom appears on record in 1312, with Ferquhard, Bishop of Caithness,\r\nwitnessing the confirmation by King Robert I. and Hakon V. (at\r\nInverness, 28th October) of the prior treaty executed at Perth, 6th July\r\n1266, between King Alexander III. and Magnus IV. (the son of the\r\nunfortunate Hakon), by which the Kings of Norway ceded for ever the Isle\r\nof Man and all the other islands of the Sudreys, and all the islands in\r\nthe west and south of the great Haf, except the isles of Orkney and\r\nShetland, which were specially reserved to Norway. In consideration of\r\nthis the King of Scotland became bound to pay to the King of Norway and\r\nhis heirs for ever an annual sum of 100 marks, within St. Magnus’\r\nchurch, in addition to a payment of 4000 marks to be paid within the\r\nspace of four years.\r\n\r\nIt was about the time of Earl John’s visit to the court of King Hakon,\r\non the occasion above referred to, that there occurred in Norway one of\r\nthe most extraordinary instances of imposture on record. A woman\r\nappeared in Bergen, in 1300, declaring that she was the princess\r\nMargaret, daughter of King Eirik, and heiress to the crown of Scotland,\r\nwho was believed by all in Norway and in Britain to have died off the\r\ncoast of Orkney some ten years previously. She had come over in a ship\r\nfrom Lubeck,[59] and her story was that she had been “sold” or betrayed\r\nby her attendant Ingibiorg Erlingsdatter, in the interest of certain\r\npersons who wished her out of the way, and had falsely given her out for\r\ndead. Although her appearance and circumstances were strongly against\r\nthe credibility of her story, it seems to have taken a strong hold of\r\nthe popular mind, and not a few of the clergy and the higher classes,\r\npossibly influenced by political motives, appear to have given her\r\ncountenance. She was a married woman, and was accompanied by her\r\nhusband, a German. She is described by Bishop Audfinn as being well up\r\nin years, her hair was greyish, and partially whitened with age, and to\r\nall appearance she was at least twenty years older than the date of King\r\nEirik’s marriage with Margaret of Scotland, and consequently about seven\r\nyears older than King Eirik himself, who was but thirteen when he was\r\nmarried. “Yet,” says Munch, “though the king’s daughter Margaret had\r\ndied in the presence of some of the best men of Norway, though her\r\ncorpse had been brought back by the bishop and Herr Thore Hakonson, to\r\nKing Eirik, who himself had laid it in the open grave, satisfied himself\r\nof the identity of his daughter’s remains, and placed them in the\r\nChrist’s Kirk by the side of her mother’s;—though this woman, in short,\r\nwas a rank impostor, yet she found many among the great men to believe\r\nher story, and not a few of the priests also gave her their countenance\r\nand support. That this German woman, purely of her own accord, should\r\nhave attempted to personate the princess Margaret ten years after her\r\ndeath, and should have ventured to appear publicly in Norway on such an\r\nenterprise, seems hardly credible. It is more likely that she may have\r\nbeen persuaded to it by some parties perceiving in her a certain\r\npersonal resemblance, who schooled her in the story she must tell to\r\ngive her personation an air of reality.” King Hakon was away from\r\nBergen, and no action was taken in regard to her case until he returned\r\nin the early part of the winter of 1301. It was natural that he should\r\nwish personally to see and examine the impostor, and confront her with\r\nthe princess’s attendants, especially to hear the testimony of Ingibiorg\r\nErlingsdatter, before deciding on anything. There is no record of the\r\ntrial, but soon after the king’s arrival the “false Margaret” was burnt\r\nat Nordness in Bergen, as an impostor, and her husband was beheaded. As\r\nshe was being taken through the Kongsgaard gate to the place of\r\nexecution, she is reported to have said—“I remember well when I as a\r\nchild was taken through this self-same gate to be carried to Scotland.\r\nThere was then in the High Church of the Apostles an Iceland priest,\r\nHaflidi[60] by name, who was the court priest of my father King Eirik;\r\nand when the clergy ceased singing, then Sir Haflidi struck up with the\r\n‘Veni Creator,’ and the hymn was sung out to the end just as I was being\r\ntaken on board the ship.” Notwithstanding the manifest nature of the\r\nimposture she was regarded by the multitude as a martyr; a chapel was\r\nerected on the spot where she suffered, and the number of pilgrimages\r\nmade to it increased to such an extent that Bishop Audfinn interfered\r\nand forbade them.[61]\r\n\r\nEarl John’s successor in the earldom of Orkney and Caithness was his son\r\nMagnus, the fifth of the name, and last of the Angus line. He first\r\nappears on record in 1312 in the treaty between King Robert Bruce and\r\nHakon Magnusson, concluded at Inverness. In 1320, as Earl of Caithness\r\nand Orkney, he subscribed the famous letter to the Pope, asserting the\r\nindependence of Scotland.[62] It seems as if he had been dead in 1321,\r\nfor in a document addressed by King Robert Bruce to the “ballivi” of the\r\nKing of Norway in Orkney, and dated at Cullen, 4th August 1321, he\r\ncomplains that Alexander Brun, “the king’s enemy,” convicted of _lese\r\nmajestatis_, had been received into Orkney and had been refused to be\r\ngiven up, though instantly demanded by “our ballivus in Caithness, Henry\r\nSt. Clair.” He was certainly dead in 1329, for in that year Katharina,\r\nas his widow, executes two charters in her own name as Countess of\r\nOrkney and Caithness, by which she purchases from the Lord High Steward\r\n(Drottset), Herr Erling Vidkunnson, certain lands in Rögnvaldsey,\r\nincluding the Pentland Skerries.[63] In one of these documents she\r\nspeaks of Earl John as he from whom her husband had inherited his\r\npossessions which he left to her, thus corroborating the statement of\r\nthe Diploma that Magnus was the son of John.[64]\r\n\r\n\r\n           VI. THE EARLDOM IN THE STRATHERNE LINE—1321-1379.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Diploma states that the earldom now passed by lineal succession to\r\nMalise, Earl of Stratherne, Magnus V. having left no male issue. In 1331\r\nMalise, Earl of Stratherne, possessed lands in Caithness,[65] doubtless\r\nin right of his wife, probably a daughter of Magnus V. Malise fell in\r\nthe battle of Halidon Hill in 1333, and was succeeded by his son, also\r\nnamed Malise, who became heir to the three earldoms of Stratherne,\r\nCaithness, and Orkney.\r\n\r\nMalise (the younger) styles himself Earl of Stratherne, Caithness, and\r\nOrkney, in a document dated at Inverness in 1334,[66] in which he grants\r\nhis daughter Isabella in marriage to William, Earl of Ross, granting her\r\nalso the earldom of Caithness failing heirs male of himself and his wife\r\nMarjory.[67]\r\n\r\nWilliam, Earl of Ross, succeeded his father Hugh, who fell at Halidon\r\nHill in 1333, but it is stated that he was not confirmed in the earldom\r\nfor three years, on account of his absence in Norway.[68]\r\n\r\nIt seems that Earl Malise must have passed over to Norway about the same\r\nperiod, in all probability to obtain formal investiture of the earldom\r\nof Orkney from the Norwegian King Magnus, and William, Earl of Ross, may\r\nhave accompanied his father-in-law. There is no record of Malise’s\r\nmovements, but we learn incidentally that he had betaken himself to his\r\nnorthern possessions,[69] when he lost the earldom of Stratherne, which\r\nwas declared forfeited by King Edward and given to John de Warrenne,\r\nEarl of Surrey. It is stated that Malise, apparently seeking to preserve\r\nthe earldom in a branch of his own family, gave one of his daughters in\r\nmarriage to John de Warrenne, and that King David then declared the\r\nearldom forfeited,[70] and bestowed it on his nephew, Maurice de\r\nMoravia,[71] son of Sir John de Moravia of Abercairny, who had married\r\nMalise’s sister Mary.[72]\r\n\r\nMalise appears to have made an effort to recover the earldom of\r\nStratherne in 1334. In that year King Edward, by a letter dated 2d\r\nMarch, directed Henry de Beaumont, Earl of Boghan, not to allow any\r\nprocess to be made before him respecting the earldom of Stratherne\r\nforfeited for treason by Earl Malise. He also wrote a letter of the same\r\ndate to Edward Balliol, stating that he has heard that Malise, Earl of\r\nStratherne, claims the county of Stratherne, which he had granted to\r\nJohn de Warrenne, Earl of Surrey, and requesting Balliol to act with\r\ndeliberation.[73]\r\n\r\nThe Diploma states that Malise was first married to Johanna, daughter of\r\nSir John Menteith, and that by her he had a daughter Matilda, married to\r\nWayland de Ard. But there is a record of a confirmation by Robert I.\r\n(1306-1329) of a grant of the lands of Carcathie (Cortachy) in\r\nForfarshire, and half of Urkwell in the earldom of Stratherne, by\r\nMalise, Earl of Stratherne, to his wife Johanna, daughter of the late\r\nJohn de Monteith.[74] As Malise the younger only became Earl of\r\nStratherne on the death of his father in 1333, if the confirmation be\r\ncorrectly ascribed to Robert I., this must refer to the Malise who was\r\nearl previous to 1333, and who had a daughter Matilda contracted to\r\nRobert de Thony in 1293, “being not yet in her 20th year.”[75]\r\n\r\nThe Diploma further states that Malise (the younger) was married the\r\nsecond time to a daughter of Hugh, Earl of Ross, consequently a sister\r\nof William, Earl of Ross, who married Malise’s daughter Isabella. From\r\nthe deed of 1334 we learn that Malise’s wife’s name was Marjory. In a\r\ndeed of 1350 we find William, Earl of Ross, styling his sister Marjory\r\nCountess of Caithness and Orkney,[76] and with her consent appointing\r\nhis brother Hugh his heir in the event of his own death without male\r\nissue. From this it would appear that Malise was then dead. He must have\r\nbeen dead before 1353, when his son-in-law, Erngils Suneson, obtained\r\nthe title of Earl of Orkney from the King of Norway. He is mentioned as\r\ndead in 1357 and 1358,[77] and the Earl of Ross is then said to have\r\nentered to his lands in Caithness, doubtless in right of his wife\r\nIsabella, and in terms of that deed of 1334 previously noticed.[78]\r\n\r\nWhile Malise was in Norway and Sweden two of his daughters had been\r\nmarried to Swedish noblemen—one to Arngils[79] or Erngisl, son of Sune\r\nJonsson, and another to Guttorm Sperra.[80] On the death of Malise, or\r\nshortly thereafter, Erngisl Suneson claimed his wife’s share of the\r\nearldom. In the year 1353 we find him executing a deed on the 10th April\r\nas plain Erngisl Suneson, and on the 6th May thereafter his signature\r\nappears to a document drawn up at Vagahuus concerning the queen’s dowry,\r\noccupying the foremost place among the nobles of Norway, and with the\r\ntitle of Earl of Orkney.[81] Although the Diploma states that he held\r\nonly his wife’s share of the earldom, it is plain from this document\r\nthat he must have received the title of Earl of the Orkneys from the\r\nKing of Norway. He soon became involved with the Swedish party in favour\r\nof King Eirik of Pomern, and in 1357 King Magnus sequestrated his\r\nestates in Norway, and declared his title forfeited. His right to the\r\nearldom would have lapsed with the death of his wife, who died childless\r\nbefore 1360.[82] Nevertheless he continued to style himself Earl of\r\nOrkney during his lifetime.[83] He died in 1392.\r\n\r\nOn the sequestration of Erngisl’s rights by the king, a certain Duncan\r\nAnderson, who appears to have been a Scotchman, and probably agent for\r\nAlexander de Ard, the son of Matilda, called the eldest daughter of\r\nMalise, issued a manifesto, notifying to the inhabitants of Orkney that\r\nhe has the true and legitimate heir of Earl Malise, the former Earl of\r\nOrkney, under his guardianship; that this heir has now the full and\r\nundeniable right to the earldom; and that, as he has heard that the King\r\nof Norway has recently sequestrated the revenues of the earldom, he\r\nwarns the inhabitants not to allow these revenues to be taken furth of\r\nthe land till the true heir be presented to them, which will be ere very\r\nlong, if the Lord will. The inhabitants, who seem to have been somewhat\r\ndisquieted by the missive, sent a representation on the subject to the\r\ncourt of Norway. It would seem that a representation must have been made\r\nby the court of Norway to the Scottish King regarding the troubling of\r\nthe islands by the claimants or their friends in Scotland, for an edict\r\nwas issued by King David from Scone, in 1367, forbidding any of his\r\nsubjects, of whatever rank or condition, to pass into Orkney, or\r\nfrequent its harbours, on any other errand than that of lawful commerce.\r\n\r\nIn 1375, King Hakon of Norway granted the earldom of Orkney for a single\r\nyear till next St. John’s Day to Alexander de Ard,[84] naming him,\r\nhowever, in the document not as Earl but simply as Governor and\r\nCommissioner for the King, and declaring, in the document addressed to\r\nthe Islanders, that this grant is given provisionally until the said\r\nAlexander shall establish his claim to the earldom. He seems not to have\r\nbeen regarded with much favour by the king, for this grant was not\r\nrenewed, and in 1379 Henry St. Clair and Malise Sparre preferred their\r\nclaims to the earldom.\r\n\r\nAlexander de Ard had succeeded to the earldom of Caithness by the law\r\nand custom of Scotland, in right of his mother as heir to Earl Malise.\r\nIn 1375 he resigned the castle of Brathwell (Brawl), and all the lands\r\nin Caithness or any other part of Scotland which he inherited in right\r\nof his mother, Matilda de Stratherne, to King Robert II., who bestowed\r\nthem on his own son, David Stewart.\r\n\r\nEarl David Stewart appears in 1377-78 as Earl Palatine of Stratherne and\r\nCaithness. King Robert III. gave the earldom of Caithness to his\r\nbrother, Walter Stewart, of Brechin, who held it till about 1424. He\r\nthen resigned it to his son Alan, who was slain at Inverlochy in 1431.\r\nThe earldom reverted to his father, who in 1437 was forfeited for his\r\nshare in the murder of King James I. The earldom remained in possession\r\nof the crown till 1452, when it was granted by King James II. to Sir\r\nGeorge Crichtoun, Admiral of Scotland. On his death in 1455 King James\r\ngranted the earldom of Caithness to William St. Clair, then Earl of\r\nOrkney, in whose line it has continued till the present day.\r\n\r\n\r\n          VII. THE EARLDOM IN THE LINE OF ST. CLAIR—1379-1469.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe genealogical questions connected with the succession of the St.\r\nClairs of Roslin to the earldom of Orkney are involved in apparently\r\ninextricable confusion.\r\n\r\nSo early as 1321 we find a Henry St. Clair acting as the “ballivus” of\r\nKing Robert Bruce in Caithness,[85] and in 1364 we also find a Thomas\r\nSt. Clair installed at Kirkwall as the “ballivus” of the King of Norway,\r\nan Alexander St. Clair, and a Euphemia de Stratherne, styling herself\r\none of the heirs of the late Malise, Earl of Stratherne.[86]\r\n\r\nThe Diploma states explicitly that one of the four daughters of Malise,\r\nEarl of Stratherne,[87] by his wife Marjory, daughter of Hugh, Earl of\r\nRoss, was married to William St. Clair. This must be William St. Clair,\r\nson of the Sir William St. Clair who fell with the Douglas in Spain\r\nfighting against the Saracens in 1330.[88] The Diploma goes on to\r\nnarrate that Henry St. Clair, the son of William St. Clair and this\r\ndaughter of Malise, succeeded to the earldom of Orkney apparently in\r\nright of his mother. We know from the deed of investiture that his\r\naccession to the earldom took place in 1379.\r\n\r\nIn a charter of 1391 Earl Henry names his mother Isabella St. Clair. It\r\nis usually said that his father, William St. Clair, married Isabella,\r\ndaughter of Malise, Earl of Stratherne. But, as we have seen from the\r\ndeed of 1334, Isabella was married to William, Earl of Ross, not to\r\nWilliam, Earl of Roslin. Yet it appears from the deed of 1391 that\r\nHenry’s mother’s name was Isabella, and though he does not style her a\r\ndaughter of Malise, the terms of the document imply that she was heiress\r\nto lands in Orkney and Shetland. The Diploma only mentions one of the\r\nEarls Malise, and it may be that the Isabella whom William St. Clair\r\nmarried was the daughter of the elder and sister of the younger Malise\r\nof Stratherne.\r\n\r\nIf he had married one of the four daughters of the younger Malise it\r\nseems unaccountable why he did not claim his wife’s portion of the\r\nearldom. We find that the representatives of the other sisters were\r\nclaimants, and that one of them, Erngisl Suneson, actually received his\r\nwife’s share, and enjoyed the title of Earl of Orkney, while Alexander\r\nde Ard is said to have succeeded to the earldom of Caithness in virtue\r\nof a similar claim, and had his rights to the earldom of Orkney so far\r\nrecognised by the King of Norway on the forfeiture of Erngisl Suneson.\r\nThe Earl of Ross, as we have seen, also succeeded to the share falling\r\nto his wife Isabella. But no claim seems to have been made for the\r\nIsabella who is said to have been married to William St. Clair. If she\r\nhad been a daughter of the younger Malise it can scarcely be doubted\r\nthat such a claim would have been made, and if made, established as\r\nreadily as that of the other sisters. William St. Clair was alive in\r\n1358, five years after the claim of the sister married to Erngisl\r\nSuneson had been made good, and one year after Erngisl’s title to the\r\nearldom had been declared forfeited.\r\n\r\nBut a more fatal objection to the statement of the Diploma, that\r\nWilliam’s wife was a daughter of the younger Malise, arises from the\r\nfact that in the attestation by the Lawman and Canons of Orkney in\r\nfavour of James of Cragy (1422) it is expressly certified that Henry\r\nSinclair was himself married to a daughter of the younger Malise, styled\r\n“Elizabeth de Stratherne, daughter of the late reverend and venerable\r\nMalise, Earl of Orkney,” and that by her he had a daughter, Margaret,\r\nwho was married to James of Cragy. The Diploma, on the other hand,\r\nstates that Henry was married to Janet Haliburton, daughter of Walter\r\nHaliburton of Dirleton, and by her had a son Henry, who succeeded him.\r\nIt is quite possible, however, that both these statements might be true,\r\nthe attestation in favour of James of Cragy having no reason to mention\r\nthe second wife, and the Diploma having no special reason to mention the\r\nfirst wife in connection with the succession which it derives through\r\nthe mother, making her, moreover, such a remarkable instance of\r\nlongevity that she survived her husband, her son, and all her younger\r\nsisters, and all their sons and daughters, and became sole heiress to\r\nthe earldom after Earl Henry’s death, although he left a son who ought\r\nto have succeeded him, but who, according to the Diploma, succeeded to\r\nher, his grandmother.\r\n\r\nIn whatever way these apparently contradictory statements are to be\r\nreconciled, the statement of the Diploma that Henry St. Clair was the\r\nfirst of the line who enjoyed the title of Earl of Orkney is undoubtedly\r\nborne out by the records. In the summer of 1379 he passed over to Norway\r\nand received formal investiture from King Hakon of the earldom of Orkney\r\nand also of the lordship of Shetland,[89] which, since the time of its\r\nforfeiture to King Sverrir by Earl Harald Maddadson, had been in the\r\npossession of the crown of Norway. The conditions on which he accepted\r\nthe earldom are set forth at length in the deed of investiture, and\r\ncontrasting them with the semi-independence of the ancient earls a\r\nrecent writer has remarked that they left him little more than the lands\r\nof his fathers.[90] Although the Earls of Orkney had precedence of all\r\nthe titled nobility of Norway, and their signatures to the national\r\ndocuments stand always after the Archbishops, and before the Bishops and\r\nnobles, though the title was the only hereditary one permitted in Norway\r\nto a subject not of the blood royal, yet it was now declared to be\r\nsubject to the royal option of investiture. The earl was to govern the\r\nIslands and enjoy their revenues during the king’s pleasure, but he was\r\ntaken bound to serve the king beyond the bounds of the earldom, with a\r\nhundred men fully equipped, when called on by the king’s message; he was\r\nto build no castle or place of strength in the Islands, make no war,\r\nenter into no agreement with the bishop, nor sell or impignorate any of\r\nhis rights, without the king’s express consent; and moreover he was to\r\nbe answerable for his whole administration to the king’s court at\r\nBergen. At his death the earldom and all the Islands were to revert to\r\nthe King of Norway or his heirs, and if the earl left sons they could\r\nnot succeed to their father’s dignity and possessions without the royal\r\ninvestiture. At the following Martinmas he was taken bound to pay to the\r\nking 1000 English nobles.[91] It was part of the compact also that\r\nMalise Sperra, son of Guthorm Sperra, should depart from all his claims\r\nto the earldom in right of his mother;[92] and he left with King Hakon,\r\nas hostages for the due fulfilment of his share of the contract, the\r\nfollowing from among his friends and followers:— William Daniel, knight,\r\nMalise Sperra, and David Crichton.\r\n\r\nBut King Hakon died in the year after Earl Henry’s investiture, and the\r\nevents that took place in the Orkneys during the reign of King Olaf, his\r\nsuccessor, are entirely unknown to the Norwegian chroniclers. Earl Henry\r\nseems neither to have courted the favour of his suzerain nor to have\r\nstood in awe of his interference. He built the castle of Kirkwall in\r\ndefiance of the prohibition contained in the deed of his investiture,\r\nand seems to have felt himself sufficiently independent to rule his\r\nsea-girt earldom according to his own will and pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe fact that King Hakon’s investiture of Earl Henry took him bound not\r\nto enter into any league with the bishop nor to establish any friendship\r\nwith him without the king’s express consent, shows us that the bishop\r\nwas then acting in opposition to the king and the representatives of the\r\ncivil power. The likelihood is that Earl Henry found this opposition of\r\nthe bishop favourable to his own design of making himself practically\r\nindependent, and represented it as the excuse for the erection of the\r\ncastle of Kirkwall, contrary to the terms of his agreement with the\r\ncrown. Munch attributes the discord to the growing dislike of the\r\nNorwegian inhabitants of the Islands to Scotsmen, whose numbers had been\r\nlong increasing through the influence of the Scottish family connections\r\nof the later earls. Whatever may have been its origin, the end of it was\r\nthat in some popular commotion, of which we have no authentic account,\r\nthe bishop was slain in the year 1382.[93]\r\n\r\nMalise Sperra appears to have endeavoured to establish himself in\r\nShetland[94] in opposition to Earl Henry. He had seized, it is not\r\nstated upon what grounds, the possessions in Shetland which had belonged\r\nto Herdis Thorvaldsdatter, and of which Jón Hafthorson and Sigurd\r\nHafthorson were the lawful heirs. It seems as if a court had been about\r\nto be held by the earl to settle the legal rights of the parties\r\nconcerned. The court would be held at the old Thingstead, near\r\nScalloway, but a conflict took place, the dispute was terminated by the\r\nstrong hand, and Malise Sperra was slain.[95] As a number of his men\r\nwere slain with him, it seems probable that he had been the aggressor.\r\nAs both he and the earl are among those who were present at the assembly\r\nof nobles at Helsingborg, on the accession of King Eirik of Pomern in\r\nSeptember 1389, and the Iceland Annals place the death of Malise Sperra\r\nin this same year, it is probable that the earl landed in Shetland on\r\nhis way home from Norway for the express purpose of seeing justice done\r\nin the cause of the heirs of Thordis. In 1391, by a deed executed at\r\nKirkwall (and subsequently confirmed by King Robert III.), he dispones\r\nthe lands of Newburgh and Auchdale in Aberdeenshire,[96] to his brother\r\nDavid for his services rendered, and in exchange for any rights he may\r\nhave to lands in Orkney and Shetland, derived from his mother Isabella\r\nSt. Clair. In 1396 a deed was executed at Roslin by John de Drummond of\r\nCargyll, and Elizabeth, his wife, in favour of Henry, Earl of Orkney,\r\nLord Roslyn, “patri nostro,” by which they renounce in favour of the\r\nearl’s male issue, and for them and their heirs, all claims to the\r\nearl’s lands “infra regnum Norvagie.”[97]\r\n\r\nThe Diploma states that after the death of the first Henry St. Clair,\r\nhis mother, the daughter of Malise,[98] came to Orkney, and, outliving\r\nall her sisters and all their sons and daughters, became the only\r\nheiress of the earldom. It is added that of this thing there were\r\nfaithful witnesses still living who had seen and spoken with the mother\r\nof Henry the first.\r\n\r\nHer grandson Henry, son of the first Henry, succeeded to the earldom,\r\nbut there seems to be no record of his investiture by the Norwegian\r\nking. In 1404 he was entrusted with the guardianship of James I., and on\r\nhis way to France with the young prince, for whose safety it was judged\r\nnecessary that he should be removed from Scotland, he was captured by\r\nthe English off Flamborough Head, and retained some time in\r\ncaptivity.[99] In 1412 he went to France with Archibald Douglas to\r\nassist the French against the English.[100] In 1418 John St. Clair, his\r\nbrother, swears fealty to King Eirik at Helsingborg for the king’s land\r\nof Hjaltland, and becomes bound to administer the Norse laws according\r\nto the ancient usage, and it is stipulated that at his death Shetland\r\nshould again revert to the crown of Norway.[101] It seems from this that\r\nEarl Henry must have been dead in 1418, though Bower in his continuation\r\nof Fordun says that he died in 1420.[102] A dispensation was granted for\r\nhis widow’s marriage in 1418.[103]\r\n\r\nHenry was succeeded by his son William, the last of the Orkney earls\r\nunder Norwegian rule. But the investiture of the new earl did not take\r\nplace till 1434, and for a period of fourteen years the administration\r\nof the Islands was carried on by commissioners appointed by King Eirik.\r\n\r\nOn the death of Earl Henry, Bishop Thomas Tulloch was appointed\r\ncommissioner in 1420. He swore fealty to King Eirik in the church of\r\nVestenskov in Laland, undertaking the administration of the Islands\r\naccording to the Norsk law-book and the ancient usages.[104] On 10th\r\nJuly 1422 he received as a fief from the king “the palace of Kirkwall\r\nand pertinents, lying in Orkney, in Norway, together with the lands of\r\nOrkney and the government thereof.”[105]\r\n\r\nIn 1423 the administration of the Orkneys and Shetland was committed to\r\nDavid Menzies of Wemyss by King Eirik. In 1426 a complaint was sent to\r\nthe king by the inhabitants, setting forth that they had been subjected\r\nto oppression and wholesale spoliation during the period of his\r\nadministration.[106] Among the accusations preferred against him it was\r\nasserted that he diminished the value of the money by one-half, that he\r\nthrew the Lawman of the Islands into prison unjustly, and illegally\r\npossessed himself of the public seal and the law-book of the Islands,\r\nwhich the Lawman’s wife had deposited on the altar of the Church of St.\r\nMagnus for their security; that he exacted fines and services illegally\r\nand with personal violence, and was guilty of many other illegal acts of\r\ntyrannical oppression.\r\n\r\nThe government of the Islands seems to have been again entrusted to\r\nBishop Tulloch[107] until 1434, when the young earl received his formal\r\ninvestiture.[108]\r\n\r\nWilliam, the last of the Orkney earls under Norwegian rule, succeeded to\r\nhis father Henry, and received investiture on terms nearly similar to\r\nthose imposed upon his grandfather. Moreover, he was to hold for the\r\nking and his successors the castle of Kirkwall, which his grandfather\r\nhad built without the king’s consent. He had taken the title before he\r\nreceived investiture from King Eirik, for in 1426 he appears as Earl of\r\nOrkney on the assize at Stirling, for the trial of Murdoch, Duke of\r\nAlbany.[109] In 1435, as Lord High Admiral of Scotland, he had command\r\nof the fleet that conveyed the Princess Margaret to France. In 1446 he\r\nwas summoned by the Norwegian Rigsraad to appear at Bergen on next St.\r\nJohn’s Day,[110] to take the oath of allegiance to King Christopher, the\r\nsuccessor of Eirik of Pomern. In 1460 the king’s commissioners in\r\nKirkwall certify to King Christian I. that John of Ross, Lord of the\r\nIsles, has for a long time most cruelly endeavoured to depopulate the\r\nIslands of Orkney and Shetland by burning the dwellings and slaying the\r\ninhabitants, and that in these circumstances Lord William St. Clair, the\r\nEarl of Orkney and Caithness,[111] had been prevented from coming to the\r\nking.[112] On 28th June 1461 Bishop William of Orkney writes to the king\r\nfrom Kirkwall excusing the earl for not having come to take the oath of\r\nallegiance, because in the month of June of that year he had been\r\nappointed one of the regents of the Kingdom of Scotland on account of\r\nthe tender years of the prince (King James III.), and therefore was\r\npersonally resident in Scotland. The bishop also repeats the complaint\r\nagainst John of Ross, Lord of the Isles, and the bands of his Islesmen,\r\nIrish, and Scots from the woods, “who came in great multitudes in the\r\nmonth of June, with their ships and fleets in battle array, wasting the\r\nlands, plundering the farms, destroying habitations, and putting the\r\ninhabitants to the sword, without regard to age or sex.”[113] Tradition\r\nstill points in several parts of the Islands to “the Lewismen’s graves,”\r\nprobably those of the invaders who were killed in their plundering\r\nexpeditions through the Islands.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th September 1468 a contract of marriage was signed between\r\nJames III. of Scotland and Margaret, daughter of King Christian I. of\r\nDenmark, Sweden, and Norway, by which, after discharging the arrears of\r\nthe tribute due by Scotland for Man and the Hebrides,[114] King\r\nChristian engaged to pay a dowry of 60,000 florins with his daughter,\r\nstipulating for certain jointure lands (including the palace of\r\nLinlithgow and the castle of Doune), and her terce of the royal\r\npossessions in Scotland if left a widow. Of the dowry 10,000 florins\r\nwere to be paid before the princess’s departure, and the Islands of\r\nOrkney were pledged for the balance of 50,000 florins. Only 2000 florins\r\nof the 10,000 promised were paid, and the Islands of Shetland were\r\npledged for the remainder. The amount for which the whole of the Islands\r\nof Orkney and Shetland were thus impignorated was 58,000 florins of 100\r\npence each, or about £24,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1471 King James III. gave William, Earl of Orkney, the castle and\r\nlands of Ravenscraig in Fife in exchange for all his rights to the\r\nearldom of Orkney, and an Act of Parliament was passed on the 20th of\r\nFebruary of the same year annexing to the Scottish Crown “the Erledome\r\nof Orkney and Lordship of Schetland, nocht to be gevin away in time to\r\ncum to na persain or persainis, excep alenarily to ane of the king’s\r\nsonnis of lauchful bed.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                VIII. THE BISHOPRIC OF ORKNEY—1060-1469.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of the bishopric of Orkney is involved in obscurity. Its\r\nearly history is complicated by the fact that there were two if not\r\nthree distinct successions of bishops, only one of which is recognised\r\nby the Norse writers.\r\n\r\nThe Saga statement regarding the origin of the bishopric unfortunately\r\nis lacking in precision. It is stated that Earl Thorfinn built Christ’s\r\nKirk in Birsay, apparently after his return from his pilgrimage to Rome,\r\nand that the first bishop’s see in the Orkneys was established there.\r\nTaking this in connection with the statement that William the Old, who\r\nwas bishop in 1115, when St. Magnus was murdered, was the first bishop,\r\nthe inference would be that the bishopric was erected in his time. The\r\nstatement regarding his tenure of office for sixty-six years is scarcely\r\ncredible; but supposing it to be the fact, as he died in 1167, we obtain\r\n1102 as the date of the erection of the bishopric.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Adam of Bremen states[115] that Thorolf was the first\r\nBishop of Orkney, and that he was consecrated by Adalbert, Archbishop of\r\nHamburg, in the middle of the 11th century,[116] and that another bishop\r\nnamed Adalbert succeeded him. Now, as William the Old was not\r\nconsecrated before 1102, if there was a bishop in Earl Thorfinn’s time\r\n(the date of his death being 1064), it must have been this Thorolf. If\r\nThorolf was consecrated in the middle of the 11th century, it was\r\nprobably before Earl Thorfinn’s death in 1064. But it seems that the see\r\nwas vacant or unoccupied before 1093.\r\n\r\nIt appears from a letter of Lanfranc, Archbishop of Canterbury\r\n(1070-1089), that Earl Paul of Orkney had sent to him a cleric whom he\r\nwished to be consecrated a bishop, and Lanfranc orders Wulstan, Bishop\r\nof Worcester, and Peter, Bishop of Chester, to go to York and assist the\r\narchbishop there at the consecration. This must refer to the Earl Paul,\r\nson of Thorfinn, who with his brother Erlend was carried to Norway by\r\nKing Magnus on his second expedition to the west in 1098, and neither of\r\nthem ever returned. The name of this bishop is not given in Lanfranc’s\r\nletter. But the English writers[117] mention that in the end of the 11th\r\ncentury a cleric named Ralph was consecrated Bishop of Orkney by Thomas,\r\nArchbishop of York. Thomas was archbishop from A.D. 1070 to 1100. It is\r\nmentioned that when the right of the Archbishop of York to consecrate\r\nTurgot Bishop of St. Andrews was asserted in 1109, it was proposed that\r\nhe should do it by the assistance of the (English) Bishops of Scotland\r\nand of Orkney. Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury (1092-1107), wrote[118]\r\nto Earl Hakon Palson, exhorting him and his people to obey the bishop\r\n“whom now by the grace of God they had.”\r\n\r\nA second bishop, named Roger, was consecrated by Gerard, who was\r\nArchbishop of York in the beginning of the 12th century, from 1100 to\r\n1108.\r\n\r\nA third bishop, named Ralph, previously a presbyter of York, said to\r\nhave been elected by the people of Orkney, was consecrated by Archbishop\r\nThomas, the successor of Gerard. It is this Ralph who figures in the\r\naccounts of the battle of Northallerton, 1138. Pope Calixtus II. and\r\nPope Honorius II. addressed letters to the Norwegian Kings, Sigurd and\r\nEystein, in favour of Ralph.[119] In the letter of Pope Honorius it is\r\nexpressly stated that another bishop had been intruded in the place of\r\nRalph. This must refer to William the Old, whom the Sagas make bishop\r\nfrom the year 1102.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of all this seems to be that the Archbishops of Hamburg\r\nand York both tried in vain to secure the right of consecrating the\r\nBishops of Orkney; the former on the ground that as the successors of\r\nSt. Anschar they were primates of the Scandinavian churches, and the\r\nlatter on the same ground on which they claimed the right to consecrate\r\nthe Bishop of St. Andrews—viz. that their jurisdiction extended to the\r\nwhole of Scotland and the Isles. In the appendix to Florence of\r\nWorcester’s Chronicle,[120] written in the beginning of the 12th\r\ncentury, it is said that “the Archbishop of York had jurisdiction over\r\nall the bishops north of the Humber, and all the bishops of Scotland and\r\nthe Orkneys, as the Archbishop of Canterbury had over those of Ireland\r\nand Wales.” Meantime, however, the Norwegians made their own bishops,\r\nand these, having obtained possession of the see, were the real bishops\r\nof Orkney, though the others might enjoy the empty title.\r\n\r\nThus WILLIAM THE OLD was the first of the actual bishops of Orkney of\r\nwhom we have distinct record. As the Saga and the Saga of St. Magnus\r\nboth state explicitly that he held the bishopric for sixty-six years,\r\nand the Annals place his death in 1168, he must have been consecrated in\r\n1102. The see, which was first at Birsay, where Earl Thorfinn erected\r\nthe Christ’s Kirk,[121] was removed to Kirkwall on the erection of the\r\nCathedral, 1137-52. He went with Earl Rögnvald to the Holy Land in 1152.\r\nWhen Pope Anastasius erected the metropolitan see of Trondheim in 1154\r\nhe declared the Bishop of Orkney one of its suffragans, and Bishop\r\nWilliam’s canonical rights were thus implicitly recognised. He died in\r\n1168; and in 1848, when certain repairs were being executed on the\r\ncathedral, his bones were found enclosed in a stone cist thirty inches\r\nlong and fifteen inches wide, along with a bone object like the handle\r\nof a staff, and a leaden plate, inscribed in characters apparently of\r\nthe 13th century:—\r\n\r\n            HIC REQUIESCIT WILLIALMUS SENEX, FELICIS MEMORIÆ,\r\n            PRIMUS EPISCOPUS.\r\n\r\nThe position in which the bones were found in the choir seems to\r\nindicate that they must have been moved from their previous\r\nresting-place. Bishop William’s bones, and the cist which contained\r\nthem, were carted away with the rubbish when the church was re-seated in\r\n1856.[122] The leaden plate and bone object which were found in the cist\r\nare preserved in the Museum of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM II., the second bishop, is only known from the entry of his name\r\nin the list of bishops[123] (1325), and the entry of his death under the\r\nyear 1188 in the Icelandic Annals.\r\n\r\nBJARNI, son of Kolbein Hruga (who built the castle on the island of\r\nWeir), was the third bishop. His mother, Herborg, was a\r\ngreat-granddaughter of Earl Paul.[124] Bjarni himself was a famous poet,\r\nand to him is ascribed the _Jomsvikinga-drapa_—the Lay of the Jomsburg\r\nVikings.[125] A bull of Pope Innocent III., dated at the Vatican, 27th\r\nMay 1198,[126] is addressed to him in connection with the refusal of\r\nBishop John of Caithness to collect an annual tribute in his diocese, as\r\nnoticed hereafter.[127] It appears from a deed of his in the Chartulary\r\nof the monastery of Munkalif at Bergen that he possessed lands in\r\nNorway, as well as his patrimonial lands in Orkney and castle in the\r\nisland of Weir. By that deed he gives to the monastery, “for the souls\r\nof his father (Kolbein Hruga), his mother, his brother, his relations\r\nand friends,” the lands called _Holand_, near the Dalsfiord, north of\r\nBergen. It is curious thus to find in authentic records a mortification\r\nof lands to a church in Norway to provide masses for the soul of a man\r\nwho is now known in his own former home in Orkney only as _Cobbie Row_,\r\n“the giant,” or “goblin” of the castle, which he built and inhabited.\r\nBishop Bjarni was present with John, Earl of Orkney, at the great\r\nassembly of nobles at Bergen,[128] in 1223, and died shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nJOFREYR, the fourth bishop, was consecrated in 1223, according to the\r\nAnnals. There was a Jofreyr, Dean of Tunsberg, present at the same\r\nassembly in Bergen above referred to, and as the name is a very uncommon\r\none, it is probable that he is the same who was made Bishop of the\r\nOrkneys. He seems to have been long an invalid, for, by a bull dated at\r\nViterbo, 11th May 1237,[129] Pope Gregory IX. enjoins Sigurd, Archbishop\r\nof Nidaros (Drontheim), to move Bishop Jofreyr of Orkney, who had been\r\nparalytic and confined to bed for many years, to resign office, or, if\r\nhe was unwilling to resign, to provide him with a wise and prudent\r\nhelper. Jofreyr retained the see, however, for ten years after this. The\r\nAnnals place his death in 1247.\r\n\r\nHENRY (I.) was the fifth bishop. A papal dispensation for the defect of\r\nhis birth, by Pope Innocent IV., is dated 9th December 1247.[130] He was\r\nthen a canon in the Orkneys. He was with King Hakon’s expedition in\r\n1263, and died in 1269.\r\n\r\nPETER, the sixth bishop, was consecrated in 1270. A brief of his,[131]\r\ndated at Tunsberg, 3d September 1278, grants forty days’ indulgence to\r\nthose in his diocese who contribute in aid of the restoration of St.\r\nSwithin’s cathedral at Stavanger, which had been destroyed by fire. He\r\ndied in 1284.\r\n\r\nDOLGFINN, the seventh bishop, was consecrated in 1286. Nothing is known\r\nof him but the name. He died, according to the Annals, in 1309.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM (III.) was the eighth bishop. He was consecrated in 1310. At the\r\nProvincial Council held at Bergen, in 1320, there were several\r\ncomplaints made by the archbishop against William, Bishop of\r\nOrkney.[132] Kormak, an archdeacon of the Sudreys, and Grim Ormson,\r\nprebendary of Nidaros, had been sent by the archbishop on a visitation\r\nof the diocese of Orkney, and had reported that William had squandered\r\nthe property of the see, that he had bestowed the offices of the church\r\non foreigners and apostates, that he had compromised his dignity as a\r\nprelate of the church by participation in the boisterous pastime of\r\nhunting and other unseemly diversions, that he had been careless and\r\nlukewarm in the exercise of his spiritual office, and had not sought out\r\nthose who practised idolatry and witchcraft, or who were heretics or\r\nfollowed ungodly ways. Moreover, he had imprisoned Ingilbert Lyning, a\r\ncanon of Orkney, whom the archbishop had sent to make inquiry into the\r\ncollection of the Peter’s pence, and had deprived him of his prebendary\r\nand all his property. He had also clandestinely appropriated to himself\r\nduring fifteen years a portion of the church dues, amounting to the\r\nvalue of 53 marks sterling, and he had refused to permit the removal of\r\nthe corpse of a woman from Orkney, although her will had been that she\r\nshould be interred in the cathedral of Trondheim. He was suspended in\r\nthe following year (1321) by the archbishop, but in 1324 we find him\r\nassisting at the consecration of Laurentius, Bishop of Hole.[133] By a\r\ndeed,[134] dated at Bergen, 9th September 1327, he mortgages his dues of\r\nShetland to his metropolitan, Eilif, Archbishop of Nidaros, for the\r\npayment of 186 marks sterling, which he should have paid the archbishop\r\nfor six years’ teinds. By another document of the same year,[135] Bishop\r\nAudfinn of Bergen requests Bishop William of Orkney to assist his priest\r\nIvar in the collection of the _Sunnive-miel_—a contribution which the\r\ninhabitants of Shetland had paid from old time to the shrine of St.\r\nSunniva at Bergen. The date of this bishop’s death has not been\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM (IV.), ninth bishop, succeeded him, sometime after the year\r\n1328. There is extant an agreement between him and Hakon Jonsson, dated\r\nat Kirkwall, 25th May 1369.[136] The next mention we have of him is the\r\nentry in the Annals, under the date 1382—“Then was heard the mournful\r\ntidings that Bishop William was slain in the Orkneys.”\r\n\r\nWILLIAM (V.), tenth bishop, appears only in a record of the time of King\r\nRobert III. of Scotland. Munch supposes that he may have been the\r\nWilliam Johnson who appears as Archdeacon of Zetland, in a Norse deed\r\ndated at Sandwick in Shetland, March 4, 1360.\r\n\r\nHENRY (II.), eleventh bishop, according to Torfæus, appears in a record\r\nof 1394.\r\n\r\nJOHN, twelfth bishop, appears in the Union Treaty of Calmar in 1397.\r\n\r\nPATRICK, thirteenth bishop, appears in an Attestation by the Lawman of\r\nOrkney, two canons of the church of St. Magnus, and four burgesses of\r\nKirkwall, of the descent and good name of James of Cragy, laird of\r\nHupe.[137] He is otherwise unnoticed, but as he is there referred to by\r\nhis canonical title, and the many losses, injuries, and disquietudes\r\nwhich he endured at the hands of his adversaries, are specially alluded\r\nto, there seems to be no doubt that he held the bishopric between the\r\ndeath of John and the incumbency of Thomas de Tulloch.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS de Tulloch, fourteenth bishop, first appears in existing records\r\nin 1418. He seems to have been previously Bishop of Ross.[138] On 17th\r\nJune 1420, at the church of Vestenskov in Laland, he gives his pledge to\r\nKing Eirik and his successors, and undertakes that he will hold the\r\ncrown lands of Orkney committed to him, for the Kings of Norway,\r\npromising at the same time to give law and justice to the people of\r\nOrkney according to the Norsk law-book and the ancient usages.[139] In\r\n1422 he receives the palace and pertinents of Kirkwall—“thet slot oc\r\nfaeste Kirkqwaw liggende j Orknoy j Norghe meth landet Orknoy,” etc.—as\r\na fief from King Eirik. A record of the set of the threepenny lands of\r\nStanbuster, in the parish of St. Andrews, executed by him on 12th July\r\n1455, and confirmed by his successor in 1465, is preserved at Kirkwall.\r\nHis death took place before 28th June 1461, when we find his successor\r\nin office.[140]\r\n\r\nWILLIAM (VI.) de Tulloch, the last bishop during the dominion of Norway\r\nin the Orkneys, was bishop in June 1461, and tendered his oath of\r\nallegiance in 1462.\r\n\r\nA bull of Pope Sixtus IV., dated at the Vatican, 17th August 1472,\r\nplaced the see of the Orkneys under the metropolitan Bishop of St.\r\nAndrews.\r\n\r\n\r\n               IX. THE BISHOPRIC OF CAITHNESS—1150-1469.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bishopric of Caithness appears to have been co-extensive with the\r\nolder earldom, comprehending Caithness and Sutherland as far south as\r\nEkkialsbakki or the Kyle of Sutherland. In later times the cathedral\r\nchurch was at Dornoch.[141] But it would seem as if the episcopal see\r\nhad at one time been at Halkirk (called in the Saga _Há Kirkia_, or the\r\nHigh Kirk), near Thurso, where we find the bishops frequently residing.\r\nThe date of the erection of the bishopric is unknown.\r\n\r\nANDREW is the first bishop who appears in authentic records. About the\r\nyear 1153 King David granted to him the lands of Hoctor Comon,[142] and\r\nabout the same time he himself gave a grant of the Church of the Holy\r\nTrinity of Dunkeld to the monks of Dunfermline.[143] About the year 1165\r\nhe and Murethac, his clerk, are witnesses to a charter of Gregory,\r\nBishop of Dunkeld, confirming the said gift. About the year 1181 he is a\r\nwitness to the grant by Earl Harald Maddadson to the see of Rome of a\r\npenny annually from every inhabited house in Caithness, which brought\r\nhis successor, Bishop John, into such trouble.[144] He is also a witness\r\nto the remarkable document engrossed in the Book of Deer, by which King\r\nDavid I. declares the clerics of Deer to be free from all lay\r\ninterference and undue exaction, “as it is written in their book, and as\r\nthey pleaded at Banff and swore at Aberdeen.”[145] The Chronicle of\r\nMailros records his death at Dunfermline on 30th December 1185. He seems\r\nto have been a learned man, and was much about the court of David I. He\r\nis said to have been the author of part of the curious treatise “De Situ\r\nAlbaniæ,” attributed to Giraldus Cambrensis.\r\n\r\nJOHN, second bishop, succeeded him. He seems to have refused to exact\r\nfrom the inhabitants the papal contribution of one penny annually from\r\neach inhabited house in Caithness granted by Earl Harald, for in a\r\nbull[146] dated at the Vatican, 27th May 1198, Pope Innocent III.\r\nenjoins Bishop Bjarni of Orkney and Bishop Reginald of Ross to compel\r\nBishop John to give up his opposition to its collection on pain of the\r\ncensure of the Church. About this time also Caithness had been taken\r\nfrom Harald by King William the Lion, with whom he was involved in\r\nhostilities, and given over to Reginald Gudrodson, the petty king of the\r\nHebrides. Hence, on Harald’s recovery of his possessions in 1202, he was\r\nso exasperated that he took vengeance on the bishop[147] by blinding him\r\nand cutting out his tongue, and inflicted severe punishments on the\r\npeople, whom he held to have been guilty of rebellion. Bishop John\r\nappears to have survived his mutilation till 1213.\r\n\r\nADAM, third bishop, was consecrated in 1214 by Malvoisin, Bishop of St.\r\nAndrews. He was a foundling exposed at a church door, but he had been\r\nAbbot of Melrose previous to his appointment to the see of Caithness. In\r\n1218 he went with the Bishops of Glasgow and Moray on a pilgrimage to\r\nRome. He seems to have been of an opposite disposition to that of his\r\npredecessor, who suffered martyrdom in the cause of his people. It was\r\nan old custom in Caithness that the husbandmen paid the bishop a _spann_\r\nof butter for every twenty cows. Bishop Adam exacted the contribution\r\nfirst for every fifteen, and at length for every ten cows. Exasperated\r\nby these exactions, the people rose in a body and came to him at\r\nHalkirk, where in the tumult a monk of Newbottle named Serlo was killed\r\nand the bishop himself burned in his own kitchen. A letter of Pope\r\nHonorius III., dated in January 1222, and addressed to the Scottish\r\nbishops of the time, is extant in the archives of the Vatican,[148] in\r\nwhich, after commending King Alexander for his promptitude and zeal in\r\navenging Bishop Adam’s murder, he goes on to tell that, having learned\r\nfrom their letters what a horrible crime, what a detestable deed had\r\nbeen committed, his spirit quailed and his heart trembled and his ears\r\ntingled as he realised the daring atrocity of the deed. “Your letters,”\r\nhe says, “have informed us that a dispute having arisen between Adam,\r\nBishop of Caithness, of adorable memory, on the one part, and his\r\nparishioners on the other, concerning the tithes and other rights of the\r\nChurch, and these matters having been submitted to the king himself by\r\nthe mediation of certain ecclesiastics, with consent of the bishop, and\r\nthe king being absent in England, his parishioners, moved with anger\r\nagainst him because he upheld the cause of his Church against them, fell\r\non their pious pastor like ravening wolves, on their father like\r\ndegenerate sons, and on their Lord Christ like emissaries of the devil,\r\nstripped him of his clothing, stoned him, mortally wounded him with an\r\naxe, and finally killed and burned him in his own kitchen.” The letter\r\nconcludes with an injunction to excommunicate all concerned in the\r\nmurder. The bishop’s body was interred in the church at Skinnet, and is\r\nsaid to have been subsequently removed to Dornoch in 1239.[149] The Saga\r\nstates that the fearful vengeance taken by King Alexander II. for the\r\nmurder of the bishop was still fresh in memory in the writer’s time; and\r\nwe learn from the Annals that “the Scottish king caused the hands and\r\nfeet to be hewn from eighty men who had been present at the burning, so\r\nthat many of them died.”\r\n\r\nGILBERT de Moravia, fourth bishop, had been Archdeacon of Moray previous\r\nto his elevation to the see of Caithness in 1223. He built the cathedral\r\nat Dornoch, and his charter of constitution[150] is still extant in the\r\nrecord-room at Dunrobin Castle. For many years there had been an\r\nintimate connection between the diocese of Caithness and the abbey of\r\nScone,[151] and in the constitution of his cathedral Bishop Gilbert\r\nnamed the Abbot of Scone one of the canons. The fourteen churches\r\nassigned to the prebends were those of Clyne, Dornoch, Creich, Rogart,\r\nLairg, Farr, Kildonan, and Durness, in Sutherland; and Bower, Watten,\r\nSkinnet, Olrig, Dunnet, and Canisbay, in Caithness. Golspie and Loth,\r\nReay, Thurso, Wick, and Latheron, were reserved to the bishop.\r\n\r\nHe seems to have been a man of mark in his time. He built the “Bishop’s\r\nCastle” at Scrabster, and was made keeper of the king’s castles in the\r\nnorth.[152] He seems also to have been the first discoverer of gold in\r\nSutherlandshire, for Sir Robert Gordon states that he “found a mine of\r\ngold in Duriness, in the lands belonging to his bishoprick.” He died at\r\nScrabster in 1245, and was afterwards canonised. His relics were\r\npreserved in the cathedral church at Dornoch, and continued to be held\r\nin reverence down to the middle of the 16th century. In a record of the\r\nyear 1545 it is stated that the parties compearing before Earl John of\r\nSutherland in the chapter-house of the cathedral at Dornoch made oath by\r\ntouching the relics of the blessed Saint Gilbert. He is the only bishop\r\nof Caithness, except Bishop Adam, whose death is recorded in the\r\nIcelandic Annals. The entry is under the year 1244:—“Death of Gilibert,\r\nbishop in Scotland.”\r\n\r\nWILLIAM, fifth bishop, was his successor. In 1250 he appears among the\r\nother Scottish bishops in a document addressed to Alexander III.\r\nconcerning the liberties of the Church. He died in 1261 or 1262.\r\n\r\nWALTER de Baltrodin, a canon of Caithness, was chosen as his successor.\r\nPope Urban IV. in 1263 addressed a letter[153] to the bishops of\r\nDunkeld, Brechin, and Ross, setting forth that his election had not been\r\nproceeded with according to canonical form, but as it had been\r\nunanimous, and in consideration of the poverty of the Church, and the\r\nexpense of making such long journeys to distant places, he enjoins them\r\nto prefer the said Walter to the bishopric if they find that he is not\r\ndisqualified by defect of birth or otherwise. He died before 1274. On\r\nhis death, Nicolas, Abbot of Scone, was chosen as his successor, but\r\nrejected by the Pope.[154]\r\n\r\nARCHIBALD, Archdeacon of Moray, was chosen on the rejection by the Pope\r\nof Nicolas, Abbot of Scone. The Pope’s letter confirming his election\r\nmentions R., the Dean, Patrick, the treasurer, and Roger de Castello,\r\ncanon of Caithness, as the parties by whom he was nominated. In his time\r\nBoyamund de Vitia was commissioned by Pope Gregory X. to collect a\r\nspecial subsidy in aid of the crusade, and his accounts furnish us with\r\nthe names of a number of the churches in the diocese of Caithness and\r\nthe amounts contributed.[155]\r\n\r\nBishop Archibald must have been dead before 1279, for in that year the\r\nPope addressed a letter to the Bishops of St. Andrews and Aberdeen,[156]\r\nsetting forth that the see of Caithness being vacant, the chapter had\r\nproceeded to the election of R., the Dean of Caithness, and had\r\nconstituted Henry of Nottingan[157] (in Caithness) their procurator to\r\nobtain confirmation of the said election, and that the said Henry, in\r\nthe Pope’s presence, had confessed that the said dean had a son thirty\r\nyears old or more, and that he was said to have another, although he\r\n(Henry of Nottingan) did not believe it; and, moreover, that he had been\r\nstricken with paralysis, and was old and debilitated. The bishops are\r\nenjoined to use their influence to oblige him to resign.\r\n\r\nALAN de St. Edmund, eighth bishop, was an Englishman, elected by the\r\ninfluence of Edward I. of England. In 1290 he signs the letter addressed\r\nto that king, proposing a marriage between the Maid of Norway and the\r\nyoung Prince Edward. Alan was a favourite with King Edward, and was made\r\nChancellor of Scotland in 1291. In that year a writ[158] was addressed\r\nby the king to Alexander Comyn, keeper of the royal forest of Ternway,\r\nin Moray, ordering him to give Bishop Alan 40 oaks suitable for material\r\nfor the fabric of the cathedral church of Caithness, which the king had\r\ngranted for the souls of Alexander, King of Scotland, and Margaret, his\r\nqueen, the sister of King Edward. Bishop Alan died in 1291, and on his\r\ndeath King Edward ordered the Bishops of St. Andrews and Glasgow to\r\ncommit the vacant cure to some cleric in the king’s allegiance.[159] The\r\nfulfilment of this mandate is not on record, but we learn from the\r\nletter of Pope Boniface VIII.[160] addressed to Bishop Adam in 1296,\r\nthat on the death of Alan the chapter of Caithness had chosen the\r\nArchdeacon of Caithness, whose name is given as I(oannes?) to be his\r\nsuccessor, but because the election had not been in canonical form it\r\nwas not confirmed by the Pope, who preferred to the vacant diocese Adam,\r\nthen precentor of the church of Ross.\r\n\r\nADAM, ninth bishop, as we learn from the Pope’s letter above mentioned,\r\nwas not elected in the usual way, but preferred by the Pope and\r\nconsecrated by the Bishop of Ostia. The letter addressed by the\r\nPope[161] “to the chapter of Caithness, to the people of the district\r\nand diocese of Caithness, and to our dearest son in Christ the King of\r\nScots,” in 1296, announces his preferment, and the reasons that led to\r\nit. He died at Sienna very shortly after the date of this letter.[162]\r\n\r\nANDREW, abbot of the Cistercian monastery of Cupar,[163] was now\r\npreferred to the see of Caithness; and because, “on account of the wars\r\nthat are imminent in those parts, and the dangers of the way, which is\r\nlong and perilous, it is impossible for him to approach the apostolic\r\nseat for consecration,” a mandate was addressed to the Bishops of\r\nAberdeen, Glasgow, and Ross, to give him consecration.\r\n\r\nFERQUHARD, Bishop of Caithness, appears in 1310, among the other bishops\r\nof Scotland, acknowledging Robert Bruce as King of Scotland. In 1312,\r\nalong with Magnus, Earl of Caithness and Orkney, he attests the payment\r\nof 100 marks sterling (the annual tribute payable for the Hebrides) by\r\nKing Robert Bruce to the King of Norway, in St. Magnus’ Cathedral,\r\nKirkwall. He was dead and the see vacant in 1328.[164]\r\n\r\nNICOLAS, a deacon, was bishop-elect in 1332.[165]\r\n\r\nDAVID was the next bishop, but of him we have no record except that he\r\nwas dead before 1340.[166]\r\n\r\nALAN, Archdeacon of Aberdeen, was confirmed as Bishop of Caithness in\r\n1341 by Pope Benedict XII.[167] He died in 1342.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS de Fingask was elected on the death of Alan, and his confirmation\r\nby Pope Clement VI. is dated in November 1342.[168] He is witness to a\r\nwrit by William, Earl of Ross, in 1355, declaring the abbey of Ferne\r\nexempt from all the king’s taxes.[169] He appears as witness to a deed\r\nwith Ingelram of Caithness, Archdeacon of Dunkeld, in 1359.[170] He died\r\nat Elgin in 1360, and was buried in our Lady’s aisle of the chanonry\r\nchurch of Elgin, under the bishop’s seat.\r\n\r\nMALCOLM is the next bishop of whom we have any authentic account.[171]\r\nHis confirmation by Pope Urban V. is dated Feb. 21, 1369.[172] A bull of\r\nPope Gregory XI., dated at Avignon in March 1376, confirms to Dr.\r\nWilliam of Spynie the chanonry and prebendary of the church of Orkney,\r\nwhich had become vacant by the preferment of Malcolm to be Bishop of\r\nCaithness.[173]\r\n\r\nALEXANDER appears as Bishop of Caithness in 1389, when, along with\r\nAlexander, Bishop of Ross, and Adam, Abbot of Kinloss, he takes part in\r\nthe settlement of a dispute between the Earl and Bishop of Moray.[174]\r\nHe appears by proxy at the provincial synod held at Perth in 1420.[175]\r\n\r\nROBERT was bishop in 1434, and his successor WILLIAM, who appears as\r\nbishop in 1449, was still in office at the period of the transference of\r\nthe Orkneys from the Norwegian to Scottish rule, in 1469.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     X. ANCIENT CHURCHES OF ORKNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The Cathedral of St. Magnus,” says Worsaae, “is incontestably the most\r\nglorious monument of the time of the Norwegian dominion to be found in\r\nScotland.” “It is,” says Peterkin, “one of the two cathedral churches in\r\nScotland remaining entire, and is, therefore, a national monument,\r\ninteresting from its antiquity, its beauty, and the rarity of such\r\nrelics in this part of the empire.” Nothing conveys to the mind of the\r\nstranger visiting Kirkwall a more vivid impression of the ancient\r\nimportance of this quaint little town, which has been the capital of the\r\nOrkneys for at least 800 years, than the grandeur of its cathedral, and\r\nthe imposing aspect of the ruins of the palaces of the Bishops and Earls\r\nof Orkney.\r\n\r\nThe Saga tells how the erection of the cathedral was undertaken by Earl\r\nRögnvald II. (Kali Kolson), in fulfilment of a vow which he had made to\r\nbuild and endow a splendid stone minster in Kirkwall in honour of St.\r\nMagnus, his mother’s brother, from whom he derived his right to a share\r\nof the earldom of the Orkneys. He won the earldom in the year 1136, and\r\nthe erection of the cathedral was commenced under the superintendence of\r\nhis father Kol, in 1137, and carried on until the earl’s means failed.\r\nBy agreement with the odallers, a mark for each ploughland in the\r\nislands was contributed for the purpose of carrying on the work, and\r\nthis brought in money enough to enable the erection of the church to be\r\nproceeded with.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral, as it now stands, however, is by no means the work of\r\nEarl Rögnvald’s time, although the portion built by him is still clearly\r\ndistinguishable. “The church,” says Sir Henry Dryden,[176] “as designed\r\nand partly built in the time of Kol (father of Earl Rögnvald), was of\r\nthe same width as at present, but possibly one bay shorter at the west\r\nend. There can be little doubt that the choir terminated in an apse,\r\nwhich began about half-way along the great piers in front of the\r\nsubsequent altar steps, and extended as far as the line of those steps.\r\nThe builders, having laid out the whole church, carried up the choir and\r\nits two aisles and the transepts to the eaves, and built the piers of\r\nthe central tower.” The architectural history of the structure, however,\r\nis puzzling. “Though I spent eighteen weeks at the cathedral,” says Sir\r\nHenry in a letter to Mr. Worsaae, “and have thought over the thing many\r\ntimes, I cannot make out the history of the building to my own\r\nsatisfaction. There is no doubt that there is a great deal of copying in\r\nit, _i.e._ of building at one time in the style of another.”[177] The\r\nchief interest of the structure lies in the fact that it was built by a\r\nNorwegian earl, and designed and superintended by the Norwegian Kol, who\r\nhad the principal oversight of the whole work. It is significant of\r\ntheir community of origin that the oldest portions of St. Magnus show\r\ntraces of the same peculiarities of style which are found in the nearly\r\ncontemporary but somewhat older Norman churches in Normandy, the home of\r\nthe Christian descendants of the Vikings who followed Hrólf the\r\nConqueror, son of Rögnvald, Earl of Moeri.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: St. MAGNUS CATHEDRAL, KIRKWALL from the South east]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cathedral was erected for the express purpose of receiving the\r\nrelics of St. Magnus, but we have no record of their transference to the\r\nnew church. There is reason to believe that they had been brought to\r\nKirkwall before the erection of the cathedral was begun, and, though it\r\nis not so stated, it may be inferred that on their removal from Christ’s\r\nChurch in Birsay, they were deposited in the church of St. Olaf at\r\nKirkwall, and remained there for some years until the cathedral was\r\nready to receive them. It seems probable that it is to the church of St.\r\nOlaf that Kirkwall owes its name of _Kirkiu-vagr_, the Creek of the\r\nKirk. This name does not occur in the Saga before the time of Earl\r\nRögnvald Brusison, who is said to have resided there, and it is most\r\nlikely that the church of St. Olaf was built by him in memory of his\r\nfoster-father, King Olaf the Holy. Earl Rögnvald was in the battle of\r\nStiklestad (1030) in which the warrior saint of Norway fell, and being\r\nhis foster-son he was more likely than any of the subsequent earls to\r\ndedicate a church to his memory. We are told in the Saga[178] that the\r\nrelics of St. Magnus were exhumed by Bishop William twenty years after\r\nhis death and placed in a shrine at Christ’s Kirk. Shortly thereafter,\r\nsays the Saga, St. Magnus appeared in a dream to a man who lived in\r\nWestray, by name Gunni, and ordered him to tell Bishop William that he\r\n(St. Magnus) wished to go out of Birgishérad and east to Kirkwall. Gunni\r\nwas afraid to do so lest he should excite the wrath of Earl Paul, whose\r\nfather had been the murderer of St. Magnus. The following night St.\r\nMagnus again appeared to him, ordering him to disclose his dream\r\nwhatever the consequences might be, and threatening him with punishment\r\nin the life hereafter if he disobeyed. Struck with terror, Gunni went to\r\nthe Bishop and told him in the presence of Earl Paul and all the\r\ncongregation. Earl Paul, it is said, turned red with anger, but all the\r\nmen there united in requesting the bishop to proceed at once to carry\r\nthe wishes of St. Magnus into execution. So the bishop went east to\r\nKirkwall with the relics, accompanied by a great concourse of people,\r\nand “placed them in a shrine upon the altar of the church which then was\r\nthere,” and which could have been no other than St. Olaf’s,[179] seeing\r\nthat the building of the cathedral was not commenced until after Earl\r\nPaul had been carried off to Athole by Swein Asleifson. The Saga of St.\r\nMagnus adds that there were then few houses in the town, but that after\r\nthe relics of St. Magnus had been transferred thither the town rapidly\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EGILSHA S. MAGNUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEarl Rögnvald (II.) himself was buried[180] in the cathedral in 1158. In\r\nthe winter of 1263 the remains of King Hakon Hakonson were deposited in\r\nthe cathedral previous to their removal to Bergen. Worsaae states that\r\nthe remains of the Princess Margaret, the Maid of Norway, were interred\r\nin the cathedral in 1290, and the local tradition is to the same effect,\r\nbut there is no authority for the statement. The princess’s remains were\r\ntaken back to Norway and buried in the High Church of Bergen by King\r\nEirik, beside the remains of her mother.[181]\r\n\r\nEGILSEY CHURCH, on the little isle of Egilsey, is interesting from the\r\nsuggestions of its connection with the earlier Christianity of the\r\nislands previous to the Norse invasion.\r\n\r\nThe church stands on the highest ground of the island, on the west side,\r\nand is a conspicuous object in the landscape from all sides. It consists\r\nof chancel and nave, but differs from all the existing churches in the\r\nislands in having a round tower rising at the west end of the nave. It\r\nis of small size, the nave being 30 feet long by 15½ feet in breadth\r\ninside, and the chancel 15 feet long by 9½ feet in breadth. The chancel\r\nis vaulted, and the walls are about 3 feet thick. The tower, which seems\r\nto have been built with the nave, is 7 feet diameter inside, and is now\r\n48 feet high, the walls being about 3½ feet thick. It is stated that\r\nabout 15 feet were taken off the height to prevent its falling.[182] The\r\nonly two windows in the nave that are original are round-headed and 3\r\nfeet high, with jambs splaying inwards from 8½ to 33 inches wide, and\r\nhaving no external chamfer. Two windows in the chancel are exactly\r\nsimilar but smaller. Over the chancel vault there is a small chamber\r\nlighted by a flat-headed window 18 inches high.\r\n\r\nIts original dedication is unknown,[183] and there is nothing to fix the\r\ndate of its erection with absolute certainty.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EGILSEY CHURCH, from the South east (from a Photograph)]\r\n\r\n\r\n“The church of Egilsey,” says Munch, “is shown by its construction to\r\nhave been built before the Northmen arrived in Orkney, or, at all\r\nevents, to belong to the more ancient Christian Celtic population; both\r\nits exterior and its interior show so many resemblances to the old\r\nchurches in Ireland of the 7th and 8th centuries, that we are compelled\r\nto suppose it to have been erected at that time by Irish priests or\r\n_Papas_. As we find no remains of any similar churches on the\r\nislands,[184] we must suppose it to have been the first of the few on\r\nthe thinly inhabited isle-group. The island on which it stood might,\r\ntherefore, very justly be called ‘Church isle.’ But the Irish word\r\n_Ecclais_ (church), derived from the Latin _Ecclesia_, might easily be\r\nmistaken by our forefathers for Egils, the genitive of the man’s name\r\nEgil.”\r\n\r\nIf we could unhesitatingly adopt Munch’s view of the origin of the name\r\nEgilsey, it might be safely assumed that this was the church which gave\r\nits name to the island, as no other ecclesiastical site is known within\r\nits bounds. The Norsemen were heathens down to the time of the\r\nChristianising cruise of King Olaf Tryggvason in A.D. 1000, and not very\r\nhearty in their Christianity for a long time after that. The church\r\ncould not have been built, therefore, between 872 and the accession of\r\nEarl Thorfinn in 1014. Nor is it likely to have been erected during\r\nThorfinn’s minority, for he was only five years old when his father fell\r\nfighting under a heathen banner at Clontarf. The Saga tells that\r\nThorfinn built Christ’s Church in Birsay, and made it the first bishop’s\r\nsee in the Orkneys. If he, or any of his successors previous to the\r\ndeath of St. Magnus, had erected such a notable structure as that of\r\nEgilsey, it would probably have been recorded. There was a church in\r\nEgilsey in 1115 when St. Magnus was murdered, and the only question is\r\nwhether it was the present church. Its resemblances to the Irish\r\nchurches of the 7th and 8th centuries are not sufficiently definite and\r\ndeterminative to enable us to assign to it unhesitatingly an Irish\r\norigin; while, on the other hand, the resemblance to the round-towered\r\nchurches of Norfolk suggests that it may have been of Scandinavian\r\norigin. But there is nothing in the architecture of the building either\r\nto fix the date of its erection or to determine the questions of Celtic\r\nor Scandinavian origin with any degree of certainty.[185]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORPHIR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CHURCH OF ORPHIR is one of the few circular churches in Britain,\r\nbuilt in imitation of the church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. The\r\ncrusades were the means of importing this form into the ecclesiastical\r\narchitecture of the west. A few of these round churches remain in\r\nDenmark, and, like those of England, they are mostly of the 12th\r\ncentury.[186]\r\n\r\nAll that remains of this interesting structure is merely the\r\nsemicircular chancel and about 9 feet of the walls of the circular nave\r\non either side, as shown in the annexed ground-plan. It is described in\r\nthe Old Statistical Account as having been a rotundo, 18 feet in\r\ndiameter and 20 feet high, two-thirds of which were taken down to build\r\nthe present parish church. The curvature of the part of the walls still\r\nremaining would give a diameter of 18 to 19 feet. The semicircular\r\nchancel is 7 feet wide and a little more than 7 feet deep. The walls are\r\nwell built of yellow Orphir freestone. The only remaining window is a\r\nsmall one in the east end of the chancel, 30 inches high, having a\r\nsemicircular head, and the jambs splaying inwards from 10½ inches to 20\r\ninches wide. It has a groove for glass.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Alex. Pope of Reay, who visited Orphir in 1758, has given a\r\ndescription of “The Temple of Orphir, or Gerth House,” but there is\r\nlittle to be gathered from it, and the measurements as given[187] are\r\nevidently wrong. He states, however, that extensive remains, supposed to\r\nbe those of the Earls’ Palace at Orphir, had been discovered in\r\nexcavating the foundations of the neighbouring farm-buildings.\r\nIndications of these, and of an extensive refuse-heap, are still to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThe church of Orphir is first mentioned in the Saga in connection with\r\nEarl Paul Hakonson’s residence at Orphir. The church is there referred\r\nto as a splendid structure, and it is not spoken of as recently erected,\r\nor as having been built by Earl Paul. But Earl Hakon, his father, who\r\nhad made a pilgrimage to Rome and the Holy Land, is said in the Saga to\r\nhave brought back relics which he would doubtless deposit in the church\r\nat Orphir, where he seems to have resided. The probability is that the\r\nchurch was built by him after his return from his pilgrimage, perhaps as\r\nan expiatory offering for the murder of his cousin, St. Magnus. Earl\r\nHakon died in 1122, and three out of the six round churches in Britain\r\nhad been built before that time.\r\n\r\nCHRIST’S CHURCH in Birsay is the first church of which we have any\r\nrecord in the Saga, and, so far as we know, the first church erected in\r\nthe Orkneys after the conversion of the Norwegian inhabitants to\r\nChristianity. It was built by Earl Thorfinn some time about the middle\r\nof the 11th century. Earl Thorfinn made a pilgrimage to Rome about the\r\nyear 1050, and it is likely that Christ’s Church would be built after\r\nhis return to Orkney, or between 1050 and 1064, the date of his death.\r\nIt was the seat of the bishopric previous to the erection of the\r\ncathedral of St. Magnus, and William the Old, who was the first (actual)\r\nbishop, lived to see the bishopric transferred to Kirkwall some time\r\nafter 1137.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether any recognisable traces of the original Christ’s\r\nChurch now remain. Neale says, “The parish church, which contains some\r\nfragments of old work, seems to have been the famous Christ’s Church\r\nbuilt by Earl Thorfinn.” But it does not seem at all likely that any\r\nportion of the existing parish church can be as old as the middle of the\r\n11th century. There are remains of an older church, however, beside it,\r\nwhich are still known as the Christ’s Kirk, and Mr. George Petrie, who\r\nhas made a ground-plan of the structure (of which only part of the\r\nfoundation remains), has ascertained that it had an apse at the east\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WEIR]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CHURCH OF WEIR, on the island of the same name, consists of chancel\r\nand nave, the extreme length exteriorly being 36 feet, and the width 18½\r\nfeet. The nave is 19 feet by 13 feet inside, and the chancel little more\r\nthan 7 feet square. The door is in the west end, having parallel jambs\r\nwith no rebate. The doorway has a semicircular head, roughly arched with\r\nthin slaty stones set on edge, the arch being set a little back on the\r\nimposts.[188] There are two windows on the south side of the nave, only\r\none of which appears to be original. It is flat-headed, 22 inches high\r\nand 8 inches wide, the jambs splaying inwards to a width of 27 inches.\r\nThe chancel arch, of which a representation is given in the accompanying\r\nplate, is exactly like the doorway. There is one window in the south\r\nside, which seems to have been round-headed, 27 inches high by 11 inches\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nOf this chapel Mr. Muir says,[189] “Excepting that at Lybster, in\r\nCaithness, the entrance to the chancel is the most diminutive, not of\r\nprimitive date, I have ever seen, the total height being only 4 feet. In\r\nplan, size, and general expression, Weir and Lybster are remarkably\r\nalike, and in all probability both buildings are the work of the same\r\nperiod, though Lybster is perhaps fully the older of the two.” Sir Henry\r\nDryden also remarks the similarity of the chapels of Weir and Lybster,\r\nand adds “Probably Weir is of the 12th or 13th century, but the\r\ncharacteristics are not decisive enough to approximate more closely to\r\nits date.”\r\n\r\nIt is most probable that this chapel[190] was built by Bishop Bjarni,\r\nthe son of Kolbein Hruga, who built the castle on the island of Weir, as\r\nrecorded in the Saga. Bjarni was bishop from 1188 to 1223, and would\r\nprobably reside on his paternal estate in Weir when not required by the\r\nduties of the episcopate to be in Kirkwall. This period answers to the\r\nindications afforded by the architectural characteristics of the\r\nbuilding, and we have no record of any other person who was likely to\r\nhave erected a chapel on this little island. The fact that it is still\r\ncalled “Cobbie Row’s Chapel” points to its connection with Kolbein\r\nHruga’s family.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LYBSTER S. MARY]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CHURCH AT LYBSTER[191] (Reay), in Caithness, corresponds in style\r\nand plan so closely to the church of Weir that it may be described here\r\nbriefly. There is no other church in Caithness of any antiquity which\r\ndemands special notice. Ecclesiastical sites of early date are thickly\r\nscattered over the county, but the ruins of the buildings themselves\r\nhave suffered so much that there is scarcely an architectural feature\r\nleft to guide us to conclusions as to their date. The church at Lybster\r\nis fortunately an exception. It consists of chancel and nave, slightly\r\nlarger than Weir, and very rudely constructed. There is a doorway with\r\ninclined jambs in the west end, of which a representation is given in\r\nthe accompanying plate; but Mr. Muir notices as a singular feature of\r\nthe building that there are nowhere traces of windows, although all the\r\nelevations except the east one, which is broken down to a little below\r\nthe gable line, remain nearly entire. The entrance to the chancel is of\r\nthe same form as the doorway, having inclined jambs. “With regard to\r\neven the probable age of this building,” says Mr. Muir, “I would not\r\nlike to venture an opinion. The diversified shapes and sizes of the\r\nstones, and the primitive form and smallness of the entrances to the\r\nnave and chancel, would suggest extreme earliness of date; whilst, on\r\nthe other hand, the refined character of the ground-plan would indicate\r\na period of time not more remote than the 12th century.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chancel-Arch of Church at Weir.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Doorway in West end of Church at Lybster, Reay.]\r\n\r\n\r\nST. PETER’S CHURCH, on the Brough of Birsay, a holm of about 40 acres,\r\nseparated from the mainland by a channel about 150 yards wide, and dry\r\nat low water, consists of nave, chancel, and apse, all well defined, and\r\napparently built at the same time, the material being a grey whinstone.\r\nThe total length of the building is 57 feet. The nave is 28 feet by 15½\r\ninside, and the chancel about 10 feet square. There is but one doorway,\r\nin the west end of the church. It has parallel jambs without any rebate\r\nfor a door.[192] There are the remains of a window in the north wall, 3\r\nfeet high by 10½ inches wide, square-headed, and splaying both\r\ninternally and externally to a width of 22½ inches. Only the foundations\r\nof the apse remain. The floor was originally level to the end of the\r\napse, but subsequently there had been a reredos which blocked off the\r\napse, and then there were steps to the altar, some portion of which\r\nstill remains. A stone projection or “seat,” 14 inches high and the same\r\nin width, runs all round the nave. In the north-east and south-east\r\ncorners are two circular spaces, 5½ feet in diameter, in one of which\r\nare the remains of a spiral stone staircase. In all probability the\r\nchurch was twin-towered, like many of the Scandinavian churches dating\r\nfrom the 13th century. Barry states that this church was dedicated to\r\nSt. Peter, but the dedication seems to have been unknown in the\r\nlocality[193] in 1627.\r\n\r\nThere are the remains of a chapel similarly situated on the Brough of\r\nDeerness, at the east end of the Mainland. The Brough of Deerness is an\r\noutlying rock, nearly 100 feet high, and covered with green sward on the\r\ntop. The chapel stands near the centre of the area, and is surrounded by\r\na stone wall enclosing an area of about 60 feet by 45. The chapel, which\r\nis a smaller and ruder building than that on the Brough of Birsay, is a\r\nsimple parallelogram of not more than 17 feet by 10 inside, the walls\r\nbeing from 3 to 4 feet thick. The doorway is in the west end, and there\r\nare the remains of a window in the east end, but the heads of both are\r\ngone. Around the chapel there are the foundations of about a score of\r\nstone-built huts scattered irregularly over the area of the Brough. They\r\nare irregularly built, with a tendency towards the rectangular form, the\r\nwalls being from 2½ to 3 feet thick. Several of them are nearly as long\r\nas the church, but not so wide, the internal area measuring about 18\r\nfeet by 6. Low[194] states that in his time, notwithstanding the\r\ndifficulty and danger of the access to the Brough, “even old age\r\nscrambled its way through a road in many places not six inches broad,\r\nwhere certain death attended a slip.” Jo. Ben, in 1529, mentions that\r\npeople of all classes and conditions were in the habit of climbing up to\r\nthe top of the Brough on their hands and knees to visit the chapel\r\ncalled the “Bairns of Brugh;” and when they had reached the top, “on\r\ntheir bended knees and with hands joined they offered their\r\nsupplications with many incantations to the Bairns of Brugh, throwing\r\nstones and water behind their backs, and making the circuit of the\r\nchapel twice or thrice.” There is still a fine spring on the Brough,\r\nwhich doubtless had the reputation of a “holy well” in connection with\r\nthese superstitious practices. The Brough was fenced with a strong stone\r\nwall toward the land side in Low’s time, and from this and the remains\r\nof the huts he concludes that it had been a rock fort subsequently\r\nconverted into a sanctuary by the ecclesiastics.\r\n\r\nThe old parish church of Deerness, of which Low has preserved three\r\nsketches (one of which is engraved in Hibbert’s Shetland), had the\r\npeculiarity of being twin-towered, as the church on the Brough of Birsay\r\nseems also to have been, and as many of the Scandinavian churches dating\r\nfrom the 13th century were.[195] Low describes it as having a vaulted\r\nchancel at the east end, of which the twin towers rose from each corner.\r\nThe tower on the south-east corner of the chancel was entered by a\r\ndoorway opening from the chancel (in the same manner as the one at\r\nBrough of Birsay), and a spiral staircase led to a small apartment or\r\nvestry between the towers, on the second storey. From this apartment was\r\nthe entrance to the other tower.\r\n\r\nThere were three towered churches in Shetland—St. Laurence in West\r\nBurra, St. Magnus at Tingwall, and Ireland Head, but, like the old\r\nchurch of Deerness, they have long disappeared, and there is no\r\ndescription of them more precise than the casual notices of Low and\r\nBrand. It is not even quite clear whether they were single-towered or\r\ntwin-towered. If single-towered they may have been examples of the rare\r\nform of which Egilsey is now the only remaining instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 XI. MAESHOW AND THE STONES OF STENNIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaeshow, the Orkahaug of the Saga, is connected in such an interesting\r\nway with the Norse history of the Isles that it is necessary to notice\r\nbriefly its most peculiar features.\r\n\r\nIt stands about a mile to the north-east of the great stone ring of\r\nStennis. Its external appearance is that of a truncated conical mound of\r\nearth, about 300 feet in circumference at the base and 36 feet high,\r\nsurrounded by a trench 40 feet wide. Nothing was known of its internal\r\nstructure till the year 1861, when it was opened by Mr. Farrer,\r\nM.P.,[196] but the common tradition of the country represented it as the\r\nabode of a goblin, who was named “the Hogboy,”[197] though no one knew\r\nwhy. When excavated, the mound was found to cover a great cairn of\r\nstones, in the centre of which was a chamber about 15 feet square, the\r\nwalls of which still remained entire to a height of 13 feet. A long low\r\npassage led from the west side of the chamber to the exterior of the\r\nmound, a distance of about 54 feet, and on the other three sides of the\r\nchamber there were small cells or _loculi_ entered by openings in the\r\nwalls about 2½ feet square at a height of about 3 feet above the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan and Section of Maeshow.]\r\n\r\n\r\nStructurally, Maeshow belongs to a class of chambered sepulchral cairns\r\nof common occurrence in the north of Scotland, but to a special variety\r\nof that class which is peculiar to the Orkneys.[198] These chambered\r\ntombs occur in groups in certain places, thus suggesting the probability\r\nthat, as in the great royal cemeteries of early times in Ireland, they\r\nmay have been for centuries the gathering places of the tribes and the\r\nburying-places of their kings.\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting fact connected with Maeshow was the discovery\r\nthat a large number of Runic inscriptions had been scratched on the\r\nstones of the interior walls of the chamber. It was evident, from the\r\nheight at which the inscriptions occurred, as well as from indications\r\nof the weathering of the stones previous to their being inscribed, that\r\nwhen the runes were cut the chamber was roofless and partially filled up\r\nwith rubbish. The form of the letters of which the inscriptions are\r\ncomposed is that of the later class of Norse Runes, “which,” says\r\nProfessor Munch, “are never older than A.D. 1100 at least.” The majority\r\nof the inscriptions are such as men seeking the shelter or concealment\r\nof the “broken how” might scribble from mere idleness. One gives the\r\nRunic alphabet. A number of others are simple memoranda consisting of\r\nthe name of a man and the statement that he “hewed this” or “carved\r\nthese runes.” But one of the longer inscriptions supplies the important\r\ninformation that “the Jorsala-farers broke open the Orkahaug in the\r\nlifetime of the blessed earl.” This seems to imply that the inscription\r\nwas carved after the death of “the blessed earl” Rögnvald, or subsequent\r\nto 1158. The Jorsala-farers who accompanied him from Norway in 1152\r\nremained a considerable time in Orkney before the expedition was ready,\r\nand as we learn from the Saga their conduct during that time was such as\r\nwould naturally result from the enforced idleness of a numerous body of\r\nrough and uncontrolled adventurers. The “breaking of a how” in the hope\r\nof finding treasure was a common exploit among the Northmen. It seems to\r\nhave been done sometimes also as a proof of courage, for the bravest\r\nwere not altogether void of superstitious fears. From another part of\r\nthe inscription we gather that the Jorsala-farers who broke the Orkahaug\r\nwere disappointed in the hope of finding treasure, as it had been\r\npreviously carried away. In all probability they were not the first who\r\nhad been tempted by the magnitude of the monument to try the venture. On\r\none of the buttresses, long slabs inserted in the corners of the\r\nchamber, is carved a cross, and on another a dragon, similar in style to\r\nthat in the tomb of King Gorm the Old at Jellinge in Denmark, and\r\nbearing also some resemblance to one sculptured on the Runic stone dug\r\nup in St. Paul’s Churchyard, London, and to another at Hunestad in\r\nScania. The tomb of King Gorm is dated about the middle of the 10th\r\ncentury. Rafn assigns the stone dug up in London to about the middle of\r\nthe 11th century; while the Hunestad example is assigned to about 1150,\r\nwhich is close on the date of Earl Rögnvald’s expedition to the Holy\r\nLand, which brought the Jorsala-farers to Orkney.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View of Chamber in Maeshow.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUBBING FROM MAESHOW TUMULUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the names thus carved on the stones of Maeshow are those of\r\nIngibiorg, Ingigerd, Thorer, Helgi, Ingi, and Arnfinn. All these are\r\nnames of persons who are mentioned in the Saga as living in Earl\r\nRögnvald’s time, and several of whom were closely connected with him.\r\nIngigerd, his daughter, was married to Eric Slagbrellir, and they had a\r\ndaughter named Ingibiorg. Helgi was a particular friend of Earl\r\nRögnvald’s. Arnfinn was taken prisoner by Earl Harald the morning after\r\nhe and his men had spent the Yule-feast day at Orkahaug on his way to\r\nsurprise Earl Erlend.[199] There is nothing, however, to identify any of\r\nthese names with certainty as the names of the persons mentioned in the\r\nSaga. But the fact that the name Orkahaug, which only occurs once in the\r\nSaga, is not known to occur anywhere else except in the inscription\r\ncarved on the walls of Maeshow, referring to the breaking open of the\r\ntumulus, is interesting in more ways than one. It shows that the\r\nNorsemen were ignorant of the origin of the tumulus, which they knew\r\nonly as the Orka-haug[200] or “mighty how.” In one of the inscriptions\r\nthe writer assigns its construction to the sons of Lodbrok, which is\r\nequivalent to saying that its origin was quite unknown[201] to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ring of Brogar, from the south-west.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout a mile to the south-west of Maeshow, and scattered over the ness\r\nor tongue of land separating the loch of Stennis from the sea, is a\r\nremarkable group of stone circles and tumuli.[202] The largest of the\r\ncircles, the “Ring of Brogar,” having a diameter of 366 feet, encloses\r\nan area of 2½ acres. It is surrounded by a trench 29 feet broad and 6\r\nfeet deep. Within the enclosure thirteen stones of the great circle\r\nstill remain standing, the stumps of thirteen more are visible, and ten\r\nare lying prostrate. The original number of the stones, says Captain\r\nThomas, on the presumption that they were placed at nearly equal\r\ndistances apart, would have been sixty, so that twenty-four have been\r\nentirely obliterated. The highest stone stands almost 14 feet above the\r\nsurface of the ground, and the lowest is about 6 feet, the average being\r\nfrom 8 to 10 feet. It is difficult to realise the amount of laborious\r\neffort expended in the construction of a work like this, which does not\r\nappeal to the eye like the magnitude of the great mounds around it. But\r\nwhen one reflects on what is implied in the transportation and erection\r\nof these great stones, and the excavation of a ditch round them of 10\r\nyards wide, 2 yards deep, and 366 yards long, it loses none of its\r\nmagnificence in comparison with the more imposing monuments.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ring of Stennis and Cromlech, from the northward.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe smaller circle, called the “Ring of Stennis,” is more clearly\r\nmonumental than the Ring of Brogar, as it contains the remains of a\r\ncromlech within it. It seems to have consisted originally of twelve\r\nstones placed round the circumference of a circle of about 100 feet in\r\ndiameter, and surrounded by a deep and broad trench with a\r\ncircumscribing mound, now nearly obliterated. Only two stones of the\r\ncircle remain standing, and a third lies prostrate. Peterkin states that\r\nsome were thrown down and removed by the tenant of the adjoining lands\r\nin 1814. The cromlech is also thrown down, but one of the supports of\r\nthe massive capstone is still standing, and the capstone, which lies\r\nbeside it, is 9 feet long by 6 feet broad.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ring of Stennis, from the westward.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ring of Bookan is a circular space 136 feet in diameter, surrounded\r\nby a trench 44 feet broad and 6 feet deep. There are upwards of twenty\r\ntumuli, some of them very large, in the immediate vicinity.\r\n\r\nIn the Saga of Olaf, Tryggvi’s son, Stennis is mentioned as the place\r\nwhere Havard, eldest of the five sons of Earl Thorfinn Hausakliuf, was\r\nslain in battle with his sister’s son Einar. The Saga says:[203]—“Havard\r\nwas then at Stæinsnes in Hrossey. There it was they met, and there was a\r\nhard battle, and it was not long till the Earl fell. The place is now\r\ncalled Havard’s _teigr_.” Teigr is an individual’s share, or allotment,\r\nof the tun or town-land, and the expression might be taken to mean\r\nrather that Havard was buried by simple inhumation than that there was a\r\ncairn or tumulus raised over him, in which case it would have been known\r\nas Havard’s How. But the name of Havard was never connected with the\r\ngreat tumulus known as Maeshow, and if he was buried in a tumulus at\r\nall, it is more likely that his corpse was burnt with the customary\r\nceremonies of that heathen time and his ashes placed in a great stone\r\nurn. The grave-mounds of the Viking period in Norway prove this to have\r\nbeen then the common practice. Such a mound, enclosing such an urn, was\r\nopened at Stennis by Mr. Farrer, M.P., in 1853. This tumulus, if not\r\nHavard’s, was apparently Norse, and being the largest in the\r\nneighbourhood of Stennis, must have been that of a person of great\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Norsemen at this early period (about A.D. 970) called\r\nthis place Steins-ness, shows that it was known to them, only as it is\r\nto us, as the ness of the monumental stones. If they had had anything to\r\ndo with the erection of any of these monuments, in all probability we\r\nshould have had some incidental record of the fact in one or other of\r\nthe Sagas.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   XII. MOUSA AND THE PICTISH TOWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little island of Mousa (the Mosey of the Saga), lying off the\r\nMainland of Shetland, is interesting as containing the best preserved\r\nspecimen of the “towers of defence,” which were the strongholds of the\r\nnative inhabitants previous to the Norse invasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tower of Mousa, of which a view is here given, consists of a\r\ncircular dry-built wall, 15 feet thick at the base, enclosing an area or\r\ncircular court 30 feet in diameter, and open to the sky, so as to admit\r\nlight to the ranges of windows which open from the galleries towards the\r\ninterior. The doorway leading through the wall into this interior court\r\nis the only opening to the outside of the tower. From the court other\r\nopenings in the wall give access to small ovoid chambers in the\r\nthickness of the wall on the ground-floor, and to a stair which ascends\r\nto the upper galleries. Above the chambers on the ground-floor the wall\r\nis carried up hollow, or rather there are two concentric walls with a\r\nspace of about 3½ feet between them, which is divided into storeys or\r\ngalleries by horizontal courses of transverse slabs, which bind the two\r\nwalls together. Thus each of these courses of horizontal slabs forms the\r\nroof of the gallery beneath it, and serves as a floor to the one above\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThese singularly-constructed towers were once thickly planted over the\r\nwhole of the northern mainland of Scotland, as well as over the most of\r\nthe Northern and Western Isles.[204] A number of them have been\r\nexcavated of late years, and the results of these excavations[205]\r\nfurnish us with interesting evidences of the conditions of life among\r\nthe people who lived in them. The relics that have been obtained from\r\nthem have no connection as a class with those that are usually found in\r\nthe cisted graves and chambered tombs of earlier times.[206] But judging\r\nfrom the general character of their included remains, the people who\r\nlived in these towers were possessed of a considerable degree of\r\ncivilisation. There is abundant evidence that they were not only expert\r\nhunters and fishers, but that they kept flocks and herds, grew grain and\r\nground it by hand-mills,[207] practised the arts of spinning and\r\nweaving, had ornaments of gold of curious workmanship, and were not\r\nunskilled workers in bronze and iron. Their pottery was rude, but not\r\nruder than the pottery manufactured and used for common or domestic\r\npurposes in some of the islands of Scotland within the present century.\r\nIt is true that silver denarii of the Roman Emperors Antoninus, Trajan,\r\nand Vespasian, have been found in the outbuildings connected with the\r\nBroch or “Pictish Tower” of Lingrow at Scapa in Orkney; but it is to be\r\nnoticed that upwards of 4000 of these Roman denarii have been found in\r\nScandinavia, where the Romans never were, and found so often associated\r\nwith relics of the Viking period as to suggest that they were carried\r\nthither some centuries after their dates.\r\n\r\nThe Tower of Mousa, Moseyjar-borg, is twice mentioned by the Saga\r\nwriters. The earliest notice occurs in the Saga of Egill Skalagrimson,\r\nthe warrior-poet, and refers to a period about A.D. 900. It is there\r\nstated that Björn Brynulfson, fleeing from Norway with Thora Roald’s\r\ndaughter, because his father would not allow him to celebrate his\r\nmarriage with her, was shipwrecked on the island of Mousa, landed his\r\ncargo, and lived in the Borg through the winter, celebrating his\r\nmarriage in it, and afterwards sailed for Iceland. The second notice of\r\nMousa,[208] singularly enough, occurs on an occasion somewhat similar to\r\nthis, when Earl Erlend Ungi fled from Orkney with Margaret, the widow of\r\nMaddad, Earl of Athole, and was besieged in the Borg by Earl Harald\r\n(Maddadson), who was displeased at the prospect of having Erlend for a\r\nstep-father.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     XIII. REMAINS OF THE NORTHMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning from the pages of the Saga to the scenes of the events which it\r\nrecords, we find, both in the topography and traditions of the\r\nlocalities, and in the customs and characteristics of the people,\r\nabundant evidence of the substantial truth of the narrative.\r\n\r\nThe range of territory possessed and occupied by the Norsemen may still\r\nbe distinguished on the map of Scotland by the prevalence of Norse\r\nplace-names. In Shetland and Orkney the topography is altogether Norse.\r\nIn Caithness and Sutherland there is a core of Celtic topography in the\r\ncentral mountain districts, while the Norse names spread out through the\r\nvalleys, forming a broad fringe along the seaboard, and occupying the\r\nwhole angle of lowland Caithness. But south of Ekkialsbakki they rapidly\r\nthin out, and finally disappear, with a few outlying instances, in\r\nMoray. The permanent dominions of the Northmen in the mainland of\r\nScotland were limited to the earldom proper, the southern boundary of\r\nwhich was the Kyle of Sutherland. The Saga says they conquered the\r\ncountry as far south as Ekkialsbakki; and though they sometimes extended\r\ntheir power over parts of Ross and Moray, and even made a raid on one\r\noccasion as far south as Fife, they made no permanent lodgment south of\r\nthe Moray Firth, and their presence in Ross has but slightly affected\r\nthe topography between the Kyle of Sutherland and the Beauly Firth.\r\n\r\nIn the Hebrides the Norse names, though much disguised by contact with\r\nthe Celtic, still form a considerable if not a preponderating element in\r\nthe topography, and their old Norse name, “Sudreyar,” still survives in\r\nthe title of the Bishop of Sodor and Man. Along the western seaboard of\r\nthe Scottish mainland, from Cape Wrath to the Mull of Kintyre, the\r\nNorthmen have left their traces more sparsely, but very distinctly, upon\r\nthe topography. In Bute, Arran, and the Cumbraes, and on the shores of\r\nthe Solway Firth, the topography also shows the influence of the\r\nNorthern element, exerted during the existence of the Norse “Kingdom of\r\nMan and the Isles.”\r\n\r\nThere are many remnants of the older usages[209] in the peculiar local\r\ncustoms; and in the characteristics of the people of the Northern Isles\r\nthere are also, of necessity, many striking resemblances to those of the\r\nScandinavian race. The elucidation of these, however, would lead into a\r\nfield far too wide to be entered on here. The language of the early\r\ncolonists, which must have survived as long as the Islands were governed\r\n“according to the Norse law-book and the ancient usages,” seems to have\r\ndied out rapidly after they were transferred to Scottish rule. Yet Jo.\r\nBen found it existing in Rendal in Orkney in 1529; and it is stated[210]\r\nthat in 1593 a clergyman, named Magnus Norsk, who was ordained to a\r\nShetland parish, went to Norway to learn the Norse language, in order to\r\nqualify himself for his ministry, because the Shetlanders at that time\r\nunderstood no other tongue. Even so late as 1774, Low found people in\r\nFoula who could repeat the Lord’s Prayer in Norse, and he gives\r\nthirty-five stanzas of an old Norse ballad which he took down from oral\r\nrecitation. In the Faroe Isles a large number of these ballads and\r\nmetrical tales have been collected.[211] There can be no doubt that they\r\nwere equally common in the neighbouring island groups, but no literary\r\nantiquary possessed of the requisite knowledge seems to have visited\r\nShetland and Orkney in time to rescue them from oblivion.\r\n\r\nThe curious literary fragment, taken down phonetically by Low, who was\r\ncompletely ignorant of the language, is plainly akin to the old\r\nScandinavian _Kæmpeviser_. The story is based on the _Sörlathattr_, one\r\nof the scenes of which is laid in the island of Hoy. The main incidents\r\nof the older poem are as follow:—Hedin, a prince of Serkland, had sworn\r\nmutual brotherhood with Hogni, King of Denmark. Nothing occurred to\r\ndisturb their friendship until Hogni went on a war expedition. Hedin,\r\nwandering in the woods, fell in with a sorceress, from whom he received\r\na magic philtre to enable him to win the love of Hilda, Hogni’s\r\ndaughter. The result was that he ran off with her in a splendid ship\r\nbelonging to Hogni, and made for Serkland. When Hogni came home he set\r\noff in pursuit, and came up with them at the island of Hoy. There they\r\nboth landed with their men, and a furious battle commenced. Odin (who\r\nenjoyed a good fight) cast a spell upon the combatants, so that they\r\nwere obliged to fight on without ceasing, until a Christian should come\r\nwho should have the hardihood to mingle in the fray, of which Hilda was\r\ndoomed to be all the time an agonised spectator. At last Olaf Tryggvi’s\r\nson came to the Orkneys, and Ivar Liomi, one of his men who landed in\r\nHoy, went into the fight and broke the spell, killed Hedin and Hogni,\r\nand bore off the prize.[212]\r\n\r\nThe story of the Shetland ballad is that Hiluge, a young nobleman at the\r\ncourt of Norway, made love to the king’s daughter Hildina, and was\r\nrejected by her, though her father supported his pretensions to her\r\nhand. When the king and Hiluge were away at the wars, an Earl of Orkney\r\ncame to Norway, and found such favour with Hildina that she consented to\r\nfly with him to the Orkneys. When the king and Hiluge returned and\r\ndiscovered what had happened in their absence, they set sail, with a\r\ngreat host, in pursuit of the fugitives. Hildina persuaded the earl to\r\ngo unarmed to meet her father, and ask for his pardon and peace. The\r\nking was pleased to forgive him, and to grant his consent to their\r\nunion. But now Hiluge, by artfully working on the king’s mind, stirs up\r\nhis latent wrath against the earl, and induces him to revoke his\r\nconsent. The result is, that he decides that Hiluge and the earl shall\r\nmeet in single combat, and fight it out to the death of one or other.\r\nHiluge was victorious; and, not content with the death of his enemy, he\r\ncut off his head and cast it into Hildina’s lap with taunting words.\r\nHildina answered his taunts boldly, and conceived a bloody revenge. But\r\nshe must now follow him to Norway, where he renewed his courtship. Ere\r\nlong she seemed to relent, and gave him her promise, but besought her\r\nfather to grant her this boon, that she herself should fill out the\r\nfirst wine-cup at the bridal. Her request was granted. The guests came,\r\nthe feast was set, and Hildina filled up the wine-cups for them. The\r\nwine was drugged, and they were all cast into a deep sleep, from which\r\nnothing could awake them. Hildina now caused her father to be carried\r\nforth, and set fire to the house. Hiluge, awaking in the midst of the\r\nburning, cried out for mercy. Hildina replied that she would give him\r\nthe same mercy as he had given to her earl, and left him to perish in\r\nthe flames.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: sword]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dialect of the ballad resembles that which prevailed in Norway in\r\nthe middle of the 15th century, but presents several peculiarities of\r\nlocal origin. The allusions in it to St. Magnus show that it cannot be\r\nolder than the 12th century in its present form, although the story of\r\nHedin and Hogni, on which it appears to have been founded, belongs to\r\nthe heathen time.\r\n\r\nLooking at the number of Runic monuments in the island of Man,[213] and\r\nthe beauty of their workmanship, it certainly seems surprising that none\r\nof these characteristic works of northern art should have survived in\r\nthe Orkneys.[214] Previous to the discovery of the inscriptions in\r\nMaeshow, the only Rune-inscribed monument known within the bounds of the\r\nancient earldom was the stone in the churchyard of Crosskirk,\r\nNorthmavine, Shetland, described by Low, which reads (according to his\r\nimperfect copy) “Bid pray for the soul of ——,” and consequently belongs\r\nto the Christian time. That there were similar monuments in other\r\nplaces, however, is shown by the recent discovery of a Runic fragment at\r\nAithsvoe, Cunningsburgh, Shetland.[215] It is a mere fragment of the\r\nterminal part of a monumental inscription, incised on the edge of the\r\nstone, consisting of the letters KVIMIK, which Professor Stephens reads\r\nas the concluding part of the customary formula, “—— hewed me,” _i.e._\r\ncarved this stone.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most interesting and suggestive remains of the Northmen\r\nare those that have been from time to time recovered from the soil which\r\nthey made their own—the relics which were actually possessed by the men\r\nand women of the Saga time; the weapons they used, and the ornaments\r\nthey wore. In the grave-mounds of the heathen period, the warrior Viking\r\nstill lies as he was laid, with his shield at his shoulder, and his\r\nsword ready to his hand.\r\n\r\nThe sword here figured, which is of a distinctively Scandinavian type,\r\nwas dug up in making the railway near Gorton, in Morayshire, and is now\r\nin the museum of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland. It is 35 inches\r\nin length, of excellent workmanship, damascened along the centre of the\r\nblade, and the pommel and recurved guard are beautifully inlaid with\r\nsilver. A number of fragments of shield-bosses and broken swords, from\r\nOrkney graves, are also in the museum. The swords are chiefly of the\r\nolder form, with straight guard and massive square or triangular pommel.\r\nIn one of the interments at Westray the scabbard-tip here figured was\r\nfound, and in others the bones of the dog and horse were found along\r\nwith the human skeleton, indicating the continuance in Orkney of the\r\nsepulchral rites which prevailed in the heathen time in Norway.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scabbard-tip]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor at least a century and a half after the establishment of the Norse\r\nearldom in Orkney and Shetland, the heathen Norsemen practised the\r\nburial customs which they had brought with them from Norway. Sigurd,\r\nEystein’s son, the first Earl of Orkney, was buried in a cairn on\r\nEkkialsbakki, (and his grave-mound was known as Sigurd’s How\r\n(_Siwardhoch_) in the 12th century,[216]) and Torf Einar caused his men\r\nto rear a cairn over the remains of Halfdan Hálegg, the son of Harald\r\nHarfagri, whom he offered to Odin in Rinansey.\r\n\r\nA vivid picture of the ceremonies attending the burial of a Norse chief\r\nof the 10th century is preserved in the narrative of an eye-witness, in\r\nthe work of an Arab geographer;[217] and all its details are amply\r\nconfirmed by the contents of the grave-mounds of the period. Ahmed Ibn\r\nFozlan, being in the country on the upper part of the Volga (then\r\noccupied by the Norsemen), as ambassador from the Caliph Al Moktader\r\n(A.D. 907-932), resolved to see for himself whether what he had heard of\r\ntheir burial customs was true. A great chief among the Norsemen had just\r\ndied, and Ibn Fozlan describes, with curious minuteness of detail, the\r\nstrange things he witnessed on the occasion. He gives a most\r\ncharacteristic picture of the drinking habits of the Northmen. “This\r\nnation,” he says, “is much given to wine and drink, by day and night,\r\nand it is not uncommon for one or another of them to die with beakers in\r\ntheir hands. When a chieftain dies, his family ask his maids\r\n(concubines) and men-servants, ‘Which of you will die with him?’ One of\r\nthem will say, ‘I,’ and by this promise he is bound, and cannot revoke\r\nit. If he should desire to do so, he is not permitted.” It is mostly the\r\nmaids who are willing to be thus sacrificed, says Ibn Fozlan, and on\r\nthis occasion it was one of them who offered to die with her lord. She\r\nwas accordingly given in charge to the other servants, who were to\r\nindulge her in every wish till the day of her sacrifice; and he adds,\r\nthat “every day she drank, sang, was lively and merry.” Meantime the\r\ndead man had been laid in a temporary grave, and strong drink, fruits,\r\nand musical instruments placed beside him, as if to relieve the tedium\r\nof his confinement until the completion of the preparations for the\r\nfuneral rites. A splendid suit of clothing was prepared for him, his\r\nship was hauled up on the strand, and placed on four posts erected for\r\nthe purpose. A bed was prepared in the midst of the deck, with a\r\ntent-like canopy over it, and covered with gold-embroidered cloth. In\r\nthe preparation of this bed there comes on the scene an old hag, “whom\r\nthey called the dead man’s angel.” It was she who took charge of the\r\nmaking of the dead man’s clothing and all needful arrangements, and she\r\nit was also who was to put the girl to death. “I saw her,” says Ibn\r\nFozlan; “she was sallow and stern.” While the “dead man’s angel” was\r\narranging the bed, the multitude were away at the temporary grave,\r\ndisinterring the corpse. They clothed him in the rich garments provided\r\nfor the occasion, and then bore him to the ship, where he was laid in\r\nstate under the canopy. “So they laid him on the mattress, and stayed\r\nhim up with pillows, then brought the strong drink, the fruits, and\r\nodoriferous herbs, and set them by his side, placing bread, meat, and\r\nonions also before him. Then came a man forward with a dog, hewed it\r\ninto two portions, and cast them into the ship. So brought they all the\r\ndead man’s weapons and laid them by his side. Then they led forth two\r\nhorses, made them run till they were covered with sweat, then hewed them\r\nin pieces with the sword, and cast the flesh into the ship. So also they\r\nbrought forth two oxen, hewed them in pieces, and cast them into the\r\nship. Next they came with a cock and hen, slew them, and cast them also\r\ninto the ship.” In the meantime the woman who was to die kept going\r\nbackwards and forwards in and out of the tent. At last they led her away\r\nto an object which they had made in the form of the framework of a\r\ndoor—two posts, with a cross piece on the top, or, as is suggested, a\r\nsubstitute for a trilithon. “She set her feet on the palms of men’s\r\nhands, stepped up on the frame, and said some words in their tongue,\r\nafter which they made her stand down. Then they lifted her up a second\r\nand third time, and she went through the same ceremony. Now they handed\r\nher a hen, the head of which she cut off and cast away, but the body\r\nthey cast into the ship. I asked my interpreter what it was that the\r\nwoman had said. He answered, she said the first time, ‘Lo! I see my\r\nfather and my mother;’ the second time, ‘Lo! here I see seated all my\r\ndeceased relations;’ the third time, ‘Lo! here I see my master seated in\r\nparadise—paradise, beautiful and green, my master surrounded by his men\r\nand his menials; he calls for me; bring me to him.’ Thereupon they\r\nconveyed her to the ship. She took the bracelets from her arms, and gave\r\nthem to the crone whom they called ‘the dead man’s angel;’ and the rings\r\nfrom her ankles, and gave them to the two young girls who had attended\r\nher, and who were ‘the dead man’s angel’s daughters.’ Then came men with\r\nshields and staves, and brought her a beaker of strong drink. She sang a\r\nsong, and drank it out. Folk said to me that she thereby took leave of\r\nher friends. They reached her a second beaker. She took it, and sang a\r\nlong time. The old hag bade her hasten to empty it, and go into the tent\r\nwhere her dead master was. I watched her; she was out of herself. In\r\nattempting to go into the tent she stuck by the head in the space\r\nbetween the tent and the ship. The old hag caught hold of her by the\r\nhead and dragged her in with her, while the men commenced to beat their\r\nshields with the staves, that her shrieks might not be heard, and so\r\nfrighten other girls, and make them unwilling to die with their lords.”\r\nThe sequel is too horrible to be given as it stands in the old Arab’s\r\nplain-spoken narrative. A cord was finally wound round her neck, at the\r\nends of which two men pulled, while the “dead man’s angel” stabbed her\r\nto the heart with a broad-bladed knife. Then the relatives of the dead\r\nman set fire to the pile. A storm that was just beginning to rage fanned\r\nthe flames, and drove them aloft to a great height. A Norseman who was\r\nstanding by said to Ibn Fozlan “You Arabs are fools. You take the man\r\nwhom you most have loved and honoured, and put him down into the earth,\r\nwhere vermin and worms devour him. We, on the contrary, burn him up in a\r\ntwinkling, and he goes straight to paradise.” After the pile was\r\nconsumed to ashes they raised a great-mound over the spot, and set up on\r\nit a pillar made of a tree-trunk, on which they carved the names of the\r\ndead man and of their king.\r\n\r\nThe burial usages, however, were not always the same. Great men were\r\nburied with the pomp and ceremony befitting their rank, while meaner men\r\nwere simply reduced to ashes and inhumed in a clay urn, or in a stone\r\npot, not unfrequently in the stone cooking-kettle that had served them\r\nwhen in life.[218] This burial in stone urns, or in cooking vessels of\r\nsteatite, is of common occurrence in the grave-mounds of the Viking\r\nperiod in Norway, and is also not unfrequently found in Orkney and\r\nShetland.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bronze brooch]\r\n\r\n\r\nAssociated with such burials in Norway there are occasionally found the\r\npeculiar brooches which are characteristic of the later Pagan time.[219]\r\nAlthough they occur perhaps more frequently with unburnt burials, they\r\nlink on with the custom of cremation. Thus they afford a valuable index\r\nto the chronology of these remains in Scotland, because the Pagan period\r\nof the Scandinavian occupation may be said to be limited to the time\r\nbetween the expedition of Harald Harfagri and the battle of Clontarf\r\n(872-1014). These brooches are found in Scandinavian graves of this\r\nperiod, in Scotland, England, Ireland, Normandy, Russia, and Iceland—in\r\nshort, wherever the heathen Vikings effected a settlement. In Scotland\r\nthey have been found in various places—in Sutherland, in Caithness, in\r\nOrkney, in the Hebrides, and even in remote St. Kilda. The specimen here\r\nfigured, which is now in the Museum of the Society of Antiquaries of\r\nScotland is one of a pair found in a stone cist on a mound which covered\r\nthe remains of a “Pictish Tower” at Castletown in Caithness.[220] They\r\nare usually found in pairs, one near each shoulder of the skeleton. This\r\ncorresponds with the statement of an ancient Arab writer, that the Norse\r\nwomen used to wear such brooches in pairs on their breasts.[221]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Comb]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable discovery of these characteristic Scandinavian\r\ninterments that has hitherto occurred in Scotland was made in the island\r\nof Westray, Orkney, in 1849, by Mr. William Rendall.[222] A number of\r\ngraves were found in the sandy links near Pierowall (the Hofn of the\r\nSaga), in some of which were swords and shield-bosses, indicating that\r\nthe skeletons were those of men. But in one a pair of tortoise or\r\nshell-shaped brooches and a trefoil ornament were the only objects found\r\nwith the skeleton. In another, a pair of these brooches were found on\r\nthe breast, and a pair of combs, of the form here figured, lay on either\r\nside of the neck, apparently as they had fallen out of the hair. In a\r\nthird, a pair of brooches, a pair of combs, and a bronze pin, were\r\nfound. It appears from these examples that the brooches undoubtedly\r\nbelonged to women, and that the warriors were usually buried with sword\r\nand shield and “panoply of war;” and, as we read in Ibn Fozlan’s\r\naccount, the dog and the horse of the deceased appear also to have been\r\nsacrificed at the grave, and interred with him, in Orkney as well as on\r\nthe banks of the Volga.\r\n\r\nBut we meet with few memorials of the daily life of the Norsemen beyond\r\nthose which have been buried with them in the early period of their\r\noccupation of the Islands. Christianity abolished the custom of burying\r\nsuch relics with the dead, and for the remains of the Christian period\r\nwe must look to the yet unexcavated sites of the _skális_ and homesteads\r\nof which we read in the Saga. It would be equally interesting to the\r\narchæologist, and instructive to the historian, to be able to compare\r\nthe relics from such sites as those of Kolbein Hruga’s castle in Weir,\r\nthe castle of which Blán was the keeper in Damsey, or the _skáli_ of\r\nSwein Asleifson at Langskail in Gairsay, with the extensive collections\r\nobtained in recent years from the “Pictish Towers” of Orkney, which have\r\ngiven us such suggestive glimpses of the domestic life of the period\r\npreceding the Norse occupation.\r\n\r\nIt gives a curious feeling of reality to the ancient legends when we can\r\nthus handle the blades and bucklers of which we read such stirring\r\nstories, and remember that it was because the Norse sword was then the\r\nlongest, and the Norse arm the strongest, that we now read the earliest\r\nchapters of the history of northern Scotland in the guise of an Iceland\r\nSaga.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                          CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.D.\r\n\r\n795.

Hálfdán Hálegg[227] (high-legs)\r\nmade an expedition against Torf-Einar, and drove him from the Orkneys.\r\nEinar returned, and slew Hálfdán in Rinansey.[228] Thereupon King Harald\r\nbrought an army over to the Orkneys. Then Einar fled to Scotland. King\r\nHarald made the Orkneymen swear oaths of fealty to him for themselves\r\nand all their possessions. The Earl and King Harald were afterwards\r\nreconciled. He became the King’s man, and held the land as a fief from\r\nhim. He had, however, no tribute to pay, as there was much predatory\r\nwarfare then in the islands; but he paid the king sixty marks of\r\ngold[229] (once for all). After this, King Harald made a raid on\r\nScotland, as is told in the Glumdrapa.[230]\r\n\r\nAfter Torf-Einar, Arnkell, Erlend, and Thorfinn Hausakliuf\r\n(skull-splitter), his sons, succeeded him. In their days Eirik\r\nBlódöx[231] (bloody axe) came over from Norway, and the Earls were his\r\nvassals. Arnkell and Erlend fell in battle,[232] but Thorfinn governed\r\nthe land and became an old man. His sons were Arnfid, Hávard, Lödver,\r\nLjót, and Skúli; their mother was Grélaug, daughter of Earl Dungad\r\n(Duncan) in Caithness.[233] Her mother was Gróa, daughter of Thorstein\r\nthe Red.\r\n\r\nIn the days of Earl Thorfinn the sons of Eirik Blódöx arrived from\r\nNorway, when they had fled from Earl Hákon, and they did many deeds of\r\nviolence in the islands. Earl Thorfinn died on a sickbed, and his sons,\r\nof whom there are extensive histories, succeeded him. Lödver survived\r\nhis brothers, and ruled the land alone. His son was Earl Sigurd the\r\nStout; he was a powerful man, and a great warrior.\r\n\r\nIn his days Olaf, Tryggvi’s son, returning from a viking expedition to\r\nthe west, came to the Orkneys with his men, and seized Earl Sigurd in\r\nRörvág,[234] as he lay there with a single ship. King Olaf offered the\r\nEarl to ransom his life on condition that he should embrace the true\r\nfaith and be baptized; that he should become his man, and proclaim\r\nChristianity over all the Orkneys. He took his son Hundi or Hvelp\r\n(whelp) as a hostage, and left the Orkneys for Norway, where he became\r\nKing; and Hundi stayed with him some years, and died there.\r\n\r\nAfter that Earl Sigurd paid no allegiance to King Olaf. He married the\r\ndaughter of Malcolm, King of Scots,[235] and their son was Earl\r\nThorfinn; his elder sons [by a former marriage] were Sumarlidi, Brúsi,\r\nand Einar.\r\n\r\nFive years after the death of King Olaf, Tryggvi’s son,[236] Earl Sigurd\r\nwent to Ireland. He set his elder sons over his domains, and sent\r\nThorfinn to the King of Scots, his mother’s father. While on this\r\nexpedition Sigurd was killed in Brian’s battle;[237] and as soon as the\r\nnews came to the Orkneys his sons Sumarlidi, Brúsi, and Einar, were\r\naccepted as Earls, and they divided the islands among them, each taking\r\none third.\r\n\r\nThorfinn was five winters old when their father fell. When the King of\r\nScots heard of the Earl’s death he bestowed Caithness and Sutherland\r\nupon his grandson, with the title of Earl, and gave him men to rule the\r\ndomain along with him. Earl Thorfinn was very precocious in the maturity\r\nof all his powers. He was of large stature and strong, but ungainly. As\r\nhe grew up it soon became apparent that he was avaricious, harsh, and\r\ncruel, yet a very clever man.\r\n\r\nThe brothers Einar and Brúsi were different in their dispositions. Brúsi\r\nwas clever and fond of company, eloquent and beloved. Einar was stubborn\r\nand taciturn, disagreeable and avaricious, yet a great warrior.\r\nSumarlidi was like Brúsi in his disposition. He was the eldest, and the\r\nmost short-lived of the brothers. He died on a sickbed.\r\n\r\nAfter his death Thorfinn demanded his share of [Sumarlidi’s portion of]\r\nthe Orkneys, although he already had Caithness and Sutherland which had\r\nbelonged to his father Sigurd. This Einar considered to be much more\r\nthan a third of the Orkneys, and he would not give up any part of them\r\nto Thorfinn. Brúsi, however, consented to give up his share [of the\r\nportion belonging to Sumarlidi], saying that he did not covet more of\r\nthe land than his own proper third. Then Einar took possession of two\r\nshares of the islands. He became then a powerful man, and had a large\r\nnumber of retainers. In the summer he made war expeditions, calling out\r\ngreat levies of his men from their homes; but these expeditions were not\r\nalways successful, and the Bœndr[238] began to grow tired of them, but\r\nthe Earl exacted all his services with violence, and did not suffer any\r\none to speak against them. He was indeed a man of the greatest violence.\r\nThen there arose great scarcity in the islands on account of the labour\r\nand large expense to which the Bœndr were thus subjected. However, in\r\nthe parts belonging to Brúsi there were good seasons and easy life, and\r\nhe was greatly liked by the Bœndr.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                         OF AMUNDI AND THORKEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE was a powerful and wealthy man, by name Amundi, who lived in\r\nHrossey,[239] at Sandvik on Laufandaness. He had a son, by name Thorkel,\r\nwho was the most accomplished man in all the Orkneys.\r\n\r\nOne spring the Earl called out the Bœndr as usual, but they murmured\r\ngreatly, and brought their grievances before Amundi, and asked him to\r\nsay a good word for them to the Earl. He replied that the Earl was not\r\ndisposed to listen to advice, and it would be of no avail to ask him to\r\ndo this, as he and the Earl were such good friends; he further said\r\nthat, from what he knew of his own temper and that of the Earl, there\r\nwas great danger that they might become enemies, and he would have\r\nnothing to do with the matter. Then they asked Thorkel, and he was very\r\nreluctant, although at last he yielded to their solicitations, but\r\nAmundi thought he had been too rash to promise.\r\n\r\nWhen the Earl held a meeting (Thing)[240] Thorkel spoke on behalf of the\r\nBœndr. He begged the Earl to spare the people, and told him of their\r\ndistress. The Earl answered blandly, and said he would give great weight\r\nto Thorkel’s words. “I had intended,” he said, “to take out six ships,\r\nbut now I shall not take more than three; but thou, Thorkel, do not ask\r\nthis of me a second time.”\r\n\r\nThe Bœndr were very grateful to Thorkel for his assistance, and the Earl\r\nmade an expedition during the summer, and again in the autumn.\r\n\r\nNext spring the Earl again called out his men, and held a meeting with\r\nthe Bœndr. Thorkel spoke again on their behalf, and begged the Earl to\r\nspare them. The Earl became wroth, and said that for his speech the lot\r\nof the Bœndr should be far worse than before. Then he became so mad with\r\nrage, that he said that one or other of them should not leave the\r\nmeeting unhurt, and immediately dissolved the meeting.\r\n\r\nWhen Amundi heard what Thorkel and the Earl had said to each other, he\r\nbade his son go abroad, and Thorkel went to Earl Thorfinn in Caithness.\r\nHe stayed there a long time, and became foster-father to the Earl, who\r\nwas still young. From that time he was called Thorkel Fóstri, and became\r\na man of great repute. Other men of note and influence fled from the\r\nOrkneys on account of Earl Einar’s violence; some to Earl Thorfinn, some\r\nto Norway, and some to other countries.\r\n\r\nWhen Earl Thorfinn came to man’s estate, he sent to his brother Einar,\r\nand demanded from him what he considered his share of the Orkneys. Einar\r\nwas not inclined to divide his possessions: so, when Earl Thorfinn heard\r\nthis, he called out men from Caithness, and set out for the Orkneys.\r\nWhen Earl Einar had news of this, he collected an army, with the intent\r\nto defend his possessions. Earl Brúsi also collected an army, and went\r\nto meet them, and tried to reconcile them; and peace was made on\r\ncondition that Thorfinn should have one-third of the Orkneys as his own\r\nproper share.\r\n\r\nThen Brúsi and Einar joined their portions, on the footing that the\r\nlatter should rule them and defend them for both, and that he who\r\nsurvived the other should inherit his portion. But this compact was\r\nthought unfair, as Brúsi had a son, by name Rögnvald, and Einar had no\r\nson. Thorfinn appointed his own deputies to manage his possessions in\r\nthe islands, but he himself lived for the most part in Caithness.\r\n\r\nIn the summer Einar went on expeditions to Ireland, Scotland, and\r\nBretland (Wales). One summer, when ravaging Ireland, he fought in\r\nUlfreksfiord[241] with Konufögr,[242] an Irish king, and was defeated,\r\nwith a heavy loss of men. The next summer Eyvind Urarhorn[243] (bull’s\r\nhorn) came from Ireland on his way to Norway, and being overtaken by a\r\nviolent gale, he turned his ships into Asmundarvag,[244] and lay there\r\nfor a while. When Earl Einar heard this, he went thither with many men,\r\nseized Eyvind, and caused him to be killed, but gave quarter to most of\r\nhis followers. They went to Norway in the autumn, and when they met King\r\nOlaf,[245] they told him of Eyvind’s murder. He said little about it,\r\nbut it was afterwards found that he considered this a great loss and a\r\nserious offence against himself, though he never said much about things\r\nwith which he was displeased.\r\n\r\nEarl Thorfinn sent Thorkel Fóstri to collect his revenues, but Earl\r\nEinar regarded it as chiefly owing to Thorkel that Earl Thorfinn had\r\ncome into [his possessions in] the Islands. Thorkel left the islands\r\nsuddenly, and went to Ness (Caithness). He told Earl Thorfinn that he\r\nhad become aware that Earl Einar had intended to kill him, if his\r\nrelatives and friends had not given him warning. “And now,” he added, “I\r\nwill avoid the risk of having such a meeting with the Earl as shall\r\nbring matters to a crisis between us, and I will go farther away, where\r\nhis power does not reach me.”\r\n\r\nThorfinn persuaded him to go to King Olaf, in Norway, and spend the\r\nwinter with him in great friendship; “for you will,” he said, “be highly\r\nesteemed wherever you come among noble men; but I know your temper and\r\nthat of the Earl to be such that you will not long refrain from\r\nhostilities.”\r\n\r\nThorkel then prepared for his departure, and in the autumn he went to\r\nNorway to visit King Olaf, and spent the winter with him in great\r\nfriendship. The King often sought Thorkel’s advice, because he\r\nconsidered him a wise man and a weighty counsellor, and such was the\r\ntruth. In telling of the Earls, the King found that he was very partial,\r\na great friend of Thorfinn, and an enemy of Earl Einar. Early in the\r\nspring the King sent a ship with a message to Earl Thorfinn, asking him\r\nto come and see him; and the Earl did not put off the journey, for\r\nprotestations of friendship had accompanied the message.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                       THORKEL SLAYS EARL EINAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHORFINN went east to King Olaf in Norway, where he was well received,\r\nand spent the summer there; and when he prepared to go westward again,\r\nKing Olaf gave him a large and excellent war-ship, fully equipped.\r\nThorkel Fóstri went with the Earl, who gave him the ship in which he had\r\ncome from the west in the summer. The King and the Earl parted great\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn Earl Thorfinn came to the Orkneys. When Earl Einar heard\r\nof it, he stayed with many men in his ships. Brúsi went to meet the two\r\nbrothers, and tried to reconcile them; and once more they made peace and\r\nconfirmed it with oaths. Thorkel Fóstri should be pardoned, and be a\r\nfriend of Earl Einar, and each of them should give the other a banquet,\r\nand the Earl should first come to Thorkel at Sandvik.[246]\r\n\r\nWhen Einar came, he and his men were most sumptuously treated, yet the\r\nEarl was not cheerful. The banqueting hall was a large one, with doors\r\nat each end. When the Earl was going away, Thorkel was to accompany him,\r\nand he sent men to examine the way by which they were to go. When they\r\nreturned, they said they had discovered three divisions of armed men in\r\nambush, and were certain that foul play was intended. Upon hearing this,\r\nThorkel delayed starting, and called his men together. The Earl asked\r\nhim to make himself ready, and said it was now time to go. Thorkel\r\nreplied that he had many things to see to, and kept going out and in.\r\n\r\nThere were fires on the floor, and Thorkel walked about, and once when\r\nhe entered by one of the doors he was followed by an Icelander, by name\r\nHallvard, from the east of Iceland, who shut the door after him. As\r\nThorkel passed between the fire and where the Earl sat, the latter said:\r\n“Are you ready now?”\r\n\r\nThorkel replied: “I am ready now,” and struck the Earl a blow on the\r\nhead, so that he fell forward on the floor.\r\n\r\nHallvard said: “I never saw people with so little presence of mind as\r\nyou who are here. Why do you not take the Earl out of the fire?”\r\n\r\nWith his axe he again struck the Earl on the back of the head, and\r\npulled him towards the bench. Then Thorkel and his men walked out\r\nquickly by the door opposite to that by which he had entered, and there,\r\noutside the door, were the rest of his men fully armed.\r\n\r\nThe Earl’s men took hold of their master and found that he was dead.\r\nThey were too much stupified to take revenge, as the thing was done so\r\nsuddenly, and no one expected such a deed from Thorkel; besides, the\r\nEarl’s men were mostly without arms, and many of them were good friends\r\nof Thorkel’s before. Thus Thorkel had to thank his good fortune that he\r\nenjoyed a longer life.\r\n\r\nThe Earl’s men went away, and Thorkel to his ship. In a few days,\r\nshortly after the beginning of the winter, he left for the east, and\r\narrived safely in Norway. He went immediately to see King Olaf, who\r\nreceived him very graciously, and felt much pleasure at his deed; and\r\nwith him Thorkel spent the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                             OF EARL BRÚSI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER the death of Earl Einar, Earl Brúsi took possession of that\r\nportion of the domain which had belonged to his brother (Einar), for\r\nthere had been many witnesses to the compact which they had made.\r\nThorfinn thought it right that they should each have one-half of the\r\nIslands, yet Brúsi had two-thirds that year. Next year Thorfinn demanded\r\none-half, to which Brúsi did not consent, and they had many meetings\r\nabout it. Their friends tried to settle matters between them, but\r\nThorfinn would not take anything less than half of the Islands.\r\n\r\nBrúsi said: “I was satisfied with that third part which I inherited from\r\nmy father, and no one claimed it from me, and I have inherited a second\r\nthird after my brother according to a lawful agreement; and although I\r\nam unable to contend with you, brother, I will have recourse to other\r\nmeans than giving up my lands and title at present.”\r\n\r\nThus the meeting ended. But Brúsi saw that he had no strength to hold\r\nhis own against Thorfinn, because he had much larger possessions, and,\r\nbesides, some hope of assistance from his grandfather, the King of\r\nScots. He therefore resolved to go to Olaf, King of Norway, taking with\r\nhim his son Rögnvald, who was then ten years old. The King received him\r\nwell, and he told him his business and explained to him how matters\r\nstood between him and his brother, and begged his assistance to keep his\r\npossessions, offering in return his full friendship.\r\n\r\nThe King replied by stating that Harald the Fairhaired had reserved to\r\nhimself all odal rights[247] in the Orkneys, and that the Earls since\r\nthat time always held those lands as fiefs, and never as their own.\r\n\r\n“It is a proof of this,” he said, “that when Eirik Blódöx and his sons\r\nwere in the Orkneys, the Earls were their vassals; and when Olaf,\r\nTryggvi’s son, my kinsman, came there, your father, Earl Sigurd, became\r\nhis man. Now, I have succeeded to the entire heritage of Olaf, Tryggvi’s\r\nson. I will give you the islands as a fief, on condition that you become\r\nmy man, and then I will try whether my help will not be of more avail to\r\nyou than the aid and assistance of the King of Scots to your brother\r\nThorfinn. But if you will not accept these terms, I will try to recover\r\nthe possessions and dominion which my kinsmen have inherited and\r\npossessed there in the west.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl considered these words thoughtfully, and sought the advice of\r\nhis friends as to whether he should consent to King Olaf’s terms and\r\nbecome his man. “I do not see,” he said, “how matters will go with me at\r\nour parting if I refuse, because the King has made an unequivocal claim,\r\nand regards the Islands as his property. Now, considering his great\r\npower, and the circumstance that we are here, he will have no scruples\r\nin making my case such as he likes.”\r\n\r\nThus, although the Earl had objections to both alternatives, he resolved\r\nto give up all, himself and his dominions, into the King’s power. Then\r\nKing Olaf asserted his suzerainty over all his hereditary possessions,\r\nand the Earl became his man, and confirmed this compact with oaths.\r\n\r\nEarl Thorfinn heard that his brother Brúsi had gone east to King Olaf to\r\nsolicit his assistance; but as he had himself seen the King before, and\r\nsecured his friendship, he thought that his case had been well prepared\r\nthere, and he knew that many would advocate his cause. Nevertheless, he\r\nresolved to prepare to go to Norway as quickly as possible, intending\r\nthat he should arrive there very nearly at the same time with his\r\nbrother, so that he might see the King himself before his brother had\r\nconcluded his business. This, however, turned out otherwise than the\r\nEarl intended, for he did not see King Olaf until the treaty between\r\nEarl Brúsi and the King was fully concluded; and he did not know that\r\nEarl Brúsi had given up his dominions until he came to the King.\r\n\r\nAt their first interview the King made the same claim to the dominion of\r\nthe Orkneys which he had made before to Earl Brúsi; and he made the same\r\nrequest of Thorfinn—namely, that he should acknowledge the King’s\r\nsuzerainty over his portion of the islands.\r\n\r\nThe Earl gave a courteous answer to this demand, saying: “I consider\r\nyour friendship of great importance; and if you think you require my\r\nassistance against other chiefs, you have well deserved it; but I cannot\r\nwell pay you homage, as I am already an Earl of the King of Scots, and\r\nhis vassal.”\r\n\r\nBut when the King found from these words that the Earl wished to avoid\r\nthe claims which he had put forward, he said: “If you will not become my\r\nman, there is the other alternative—viz., that I place that man over the\r\nIslands whom I choose. But I wish you to promise me with oaths not to\r\nclaim those lands, and to leave him in peace whom I place over them.\r\nNow, if you will not accept any of those conditions, he who governs the\r\nland will say that hostilities may be expected from you, and in that\r\ncase you must not think it strange if a dale meets a hill.”[248]\r\n\r\nThe Earl answered by requesting time to consider these matters. The King\r\ngave him time, and permission to consult with his friends; but then the\r\nEarl asked the King for a further delay to the next summer, so that he\r\nmight go home; “for,” said he, “my counsellors are at home, and my\r\njudgment is not yet mature on account of my age.” The King told him to\r\nmake his choice.\r\n\r\nThorkel Fóstri was with the King at the time, and he sent a message to\r\nthe Earl secretly, telling him that whatever else his intentions were he\r\nshould not think of parting with the King without being reconciled to\r\nhim for the present, as he had got him in his power. Now the Earl\r\nthought there was no alternative but to let the King have his will,\r\nalthough he did not consider it by any means a desirable thing to\r\nrelinquish all hope of his patrimony, and to promise with oaths to leave\r\nthose in undisturbed possession of his dominions who had no hereditary\r\nright to them. But because he was not certain about his departure (if he\r\nrefused), he chose to submit to the King, and to become his man, as\r\nBrúsi his brother had previously done.\r\n\r\nThe King perceived that Thorfinn was a man of much stronger will than\r\nBrúsi, and distrusted him therefore more. He saw that Thorfinn would\r\nthink himself sufficiently powerful, with the aid of the King of Scots,\r\nthough he broke this treaty; and the King was sagacious enough to\r\nperceive that, while Brúsi agreed to everything sincerely, and made only\r\nsuch promises as he intended to keep, Thorfinn agreed cheerfully to\r\neverything, while at the same time he had resolved within himself what\r\ncourse he would take; and though he made no objections to anything which\r\nthe King proposed, yet the King suspected that he intended to act upon\r\ntheir agreements afterwards in his own way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                    OF THE EARLS BRÚSI AND THORFINN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN King Olaf had considered all these matters, he had a general\r\nmeeting summoned by the blowing of a trumpet, to which the Earls were\r\nalso called.\r\n\r\nThe King said: “I will now make publicly known the treaty between me and\r\nthe Earls of the Orkneys. They have acknowledged my suzerainty over all\r\nthe Orkneys and Hjaltland (Shetland), promising to become my men, and\r\nconfirming these their promises with oaths. In return, I will give to\r\nBrúsi one-third of the land, and to Thorfinn another third, which they\r\nhad before; but the last third, which belonged to Earl Einar, I adjudge\r\nto be forfeited to me, because he slew Eyvind Urarhorn, my henchman[249]\r\nand beloved comrade. Of this portion I will dispose as I shall think\r\nfit; and I make it a condition with you, my Earls, that you be\r\nreconciled to Thorkel Amundi’s son concerning your brother Einar’s\r\nslaying, and I wish to act as an arbitrator between you if you agree to\r\nthis.”\r\n\r\nThe Earls consented to this, as to everything else which the King\r\nproposed. Then Thorkel stepped forward and submitted his case to the\r\nKing’s decision, after which the meeting was dissolved. King Olaf\r\nawarded a weregild[250] for Earl Einar as for three Lendermen;\r\none-third, however, should be remitted in consideration of the Earl’s\r\nguilt.\r\n\r\nEarl Thorfinn asked permission to depart, and when he had obtained it,\r\nhe made himself ready in great haste. One day, when all was ready, and\r\nthe Earl was drinking on board his ship, Thorkel, Amundi’s son, came and\r\nlaid his head on the Earl’s knees, and asked him to do with it what he\r\nliked.\r\n\r\nThe Earl said: “Why do you do this? We are reconciled according to the\r\nKing’s arbitration; arise.”\r\n\r\nHe rose and said: “I will abide by the King’s arbitration concerning\r\ndifferences between me and Brúsi; but, as far as you are concerned, I\r\nleave everything to you. Although the King has reserved for me\r\npossessions and safety in the Orkneys, I am so well acquainted with your\r\ndisposition that I know it would be impossible for me to go there unless\r\nI have your confidence; and I will promise you never to go to the\r\nOrkneys, whatever the King says.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl replied slowly, and said: “Would you rather have me to adjust\r\nour affairs than abide by the King’s decision? If so, I make it the\r\nfirst condition that you shall go with me to the Orkneys, and remain\r\nwith me, and not leave me except with my permission; that you shall be\r\nin duty bound to defend my land, and to do everything I wish to have\r\ndone while we are both alive.”\r\n\r\nThorkel replied: “I leave this to you, like everything else that\r\nconcerns me.” Thereupon he submitted his case to the Earl’s decision.\r\n\r\nThe Earl said he would fix the money payment [for his brother’s death]\r\nafterwards, and received oaths from Thorkel according to their\r\nagreement; and Thorkel prepared to go with him. The Earl left as soon as\r\nhe was ready, and he and King Olaf never met afterwards.\r\n\r\nEarl Brúsi remained behind, and prepared for his departure more\r\nleisurely. Before he left, King Olaf had an interview with him, and\r\nsaid: “I think it advisable to make you my confidential agent in the\r\nwestern parts. I intend to give you two-thirds of the islands, which you\r\nhad before, because I do not wish you to have less power, now that you\r\nare my man, than you had before; and as a pledge of my good faith, I\r\nwill keep your son Rögnvald with me. I see that with two-thirds of the\r\nland and my assistance you may well hold your own against Earl\r\nThorfinn.”\r\n\r\nBrúsi was thankful for two-thirds of the land. He stayed a little while\r\nyet before he left, and came west to the Islands (the Orkneys) in the\r\nautumn. His son Rögnvald remained with King Olaf. These facts are\r\nmentioned by Ottar Svarti (the swarthy):\r\n\r\n                 Readily these noble people\r\n                 Will obey thee as thy subjects.\r\n                 Use your power with moderation;\r\n                 Hjaltlanders! your fame is well known.\r\n                 Till we had thee, fierce in battle,\r\n                 To these eastern shores, there was not\r\n                 Any prince on earth who conquered\r\n                 Those far distant western islands.\r\n\r\nWhen the brothers Thorfinn and Brúsi came west to the Islands, Brúsi\r\ntook possession of two-thirds of the domain, and Thorfinn of one, but he\r\nwas all the time in Caithness, in Scotland, and placed deputies over the\r\nislands. Brúsi alone had to defend them, for they were in those times\r\nvery much exposed to the ravages of Norwegians and Danes, who called\r\nthere on their viking expeditions to the west, and plundered in the\r\noutlying parts. Brúsi made complaints to his brother Thorfinn on account\r\nof his not contributing anything to the defence of the Orkneys or\r\nHjaltland (Shetland), although he received his full share of all the\r\nland-dues and revenues. Then Thorfinn proposed to Brúsi to take\r\ntwo-thirds of the Islands, undertaking the defence of the whole, and\r\nleave Brúsi one-third. Although this division did not take place\r\nimmediately, yet it is said in the History of the Earls that it did take\r\nplace, and that Thorfinn had two-thirds of the Islands, and Brúsi\r\none-third, when Canute the Great conquered Norway, after the flight of\r\nKing Olaf.\r\n\r\nKing Olaf, Harald’s son, received no homage from Earl Thorfinn after he\r\nmade the treaty with him and Brúsi.\r\n\r\nEarl Thorfinn now became a powerful chief. He was a man of very large\r\nstature, uncomely, sharp-featured, dark-haired, and sallow and swarthy\r\nin his complexion. Yet he was a most martial-looking man, and of great\r\nenergy; greedy of wealth and of renown; bold and successful in war, and\r\na great strategist. He was five years old when he received the title of\r\nEarl and the revenues of Caithness from King Malcolm,[251] his\r\ngrandfather, and fourteen when he went forth from his own territory on\r\nmaritime expeditions, and attacked the possessions of other chiefs. So\r\nsays Arnór Jarlaskáld (the Earls’ poet):\r\n\r\n                 By the prince in storm of helmets\r\n                 Was the sword’s edge deeply crimsoned.\r\n                 Scarcely fifteen, the great-hearted\r\n                 Sought renown on fields of battle,\r\n                 Ready to defend his own land,\r\n                 Or to ravage in another’s.\r\n                 Under heaven a braver leader\r\n                 Ne’er was found than Einar’s brother.\r\n\r\nEarl Thorfinn was greatly supported by the King of Scots. This\r\nassistance being so near, it much increased his power in the Orkneys.\r\n\r\nThe King of Scots died after the reconciliation of the brothers. Karl\r\nHundason[252] took the kingdom in Scotland. He considered Caithness to\r\nbelong to him, as to the former kings, and demanded tribute from it as\r\nfrom other places. Thorfinn, however, did not think his inheritance from\r\nhis mother’s father large, though he had Caithness; and besides,\r\naccording to his own opinion, it had been given to him first; he was\r\ntherefore unwilling to pay any tribute. Thus they became open enemies,\r\nand made war on each other. King Karl wished to appoint a chief, by name\r\nModdan, over Caithness; he was his sister’s son, and he gave him the\r\ntitle of Earl. Then Moddan went down from Scotland and collected forces\r\nin Sutherland.\r\n\r\nWhen Earl Thorfinn heard of this, he gathered together an army in\r\nCaithness. Thorkel Fóstri also came to Earl Thorfinn from the Orkneys\r\nwith many men, and their united forces were somewhat more numerous than\r\nthose of the Scots. When the Scots knew this they hesitated in their\r\ninvasion, and returned to Scotland. Earl Thorfinn subdued Sutherland and\r\nRoss, and plundered far and wide in Scotland, and returned again to\r\nCaithness, and Thorkel went back to the Islands; their men also returned\r\nhome. Earl Thorfinn stayed at Dungalsbæ, in Caithness, where he had five\r\nwar-ships and followers numerous enough to man them.\r\n\r\nModdan came to find King Karl (at Beruvik)[253] and informed him of his\r\nunsuccessful expedition. The King became very angry at his land being\r\nplundered, and started immediately with eleven war-ships and a numerous\r\narmy. He sailed northward along Scotland, after having despatched Moddan\r\nto Caithness a second time with many troops. Moddan went by land, and it\r\nwas intended that he should make the attack from that side, so that Earl\r\nThorfinn might be placed between the two armies.\r\n\r\nNow, it is to be told of King Karl that he did not stop until he arrived\r\nat Caithness, and he and Earl Thorfinn were not far from each other.\r\nThorfinn went on board his ships, and sailed out on the Pentland Firth,\r\nintending to go to the Orkneys; and so near were they that King Karl saw\r\ntheir sails as he sailed into the Firth from the east, and immediately\r\nsailed after them. Earl Thorfinn directed his course to the east of the\r\nOrkneys, intending to go to Sandvik.[254] He moored his ships on the\r\neast side of Dyrness, and immediately sent word to Thorkel to collect\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nEarl Thorfinn arrived at Dyrness late in the evening; but as soon as it\r\nwas daylight next morning, King Karl came upon them unawares with eleven\r\nwar-ships. There were only two alternatives—one to run on shore, and\r\nleave the ships with all their valuable contents to the enemy; the other\r\nwas to meet the King, and let fate decide between them. Earl Thorfinn\r\nexhorted his men, and ordered them to have their arms ready. He said he\r\nwould not flee, and told them to row briskly towards the enemy. Then\r\nboth parties fastened their ships together. Earl Thorfinn addressed his\r\nmen, advising them to be smart and to make the first attack fiercely,\r\nand saying that few of the Scotsmen would be able to make a stand. The\r\nfighting was long and fierce. Arnór Jarlaskáld says:\r\n\r\n                Once, off Dyrness, to the eastward,\r\n                Came King Kali in a mail-coat\r\n                Famous for its strength and brightness;\r\n                But the land was not defenceless,\r\n                For, with five ships, nothing daunted,\r\n                Scorning flight in warlike temper,\r\n                Valiantly the Prince went forward\r\n                ’Gainst the King’s eleven vessels.\r\n\r\n                Then the ships were lashed together—\r\n                Know ye how the men were falling?\r\n                All their swords and boards were swimming\r\n                In the life-blood of the Scotsmen;\r\n                Hearts were sinking—bowstrings screaming,\r\n                Darts were flying—spear-shafts bending;\r\n                Swords were biting, blood flowed freely,\r\n                And the Prince’s heart was merry.\r\n\r\nNow Earl Thorfinn incited his men to the utmost, and a fierce conflict\r\nensued. The Scots in the King’s ships made but a feeble resistance\r\nbefore the mast, whereupon Thorfinn jumped from the quarter-deck, and\r\nran to the foredeck, and fought fiercely. When he saw the crowd in the\r\nKing’s ships getting thinner, he urged his men to board them. King Karl,\r\nperceiving this, gave orders to his men to cut the ropes, and get the\r\nships away instantly; to take to their oars, and bear away. At the same\r\ntime Thorfinn and his men fastened grappling-hooks in the King’s ship.\r\nHe called for his banner to be borne before him, and a great number of\r\nhis men followed it. King Karl jumped from his ship into another vessel,\r\nwith those of his men who still held out; but the most part had fallen\r\nalready. He then ordered them to take to their oars; and the Scots took\r\nto flight—Thorfinn pursuing them. Thus says Arnór:\r\n\r\n                 Never was a battle shorter;\r\n                 Soon with spears it was decided.\r\n                 Though my lord had fewer numbers,\r\n                 Yet he chased them all before him;\r\n                 Hoarsely croaked the battle-gull, when\r\n                 Thickly fell the wounded king’s-men;\r\n                 South of Sandwick swords were reddened.\r\n\r\nKing Karl fled all the way south to Breidafiord,[255] where he went on\r\nshore, and collected an army anew. Earl Thorfinn went back after the\r\nbattle, when Thorkel Fóstri came to him with a numerous army. They then\r\nsailed south to Breidafiord in pursuit of King Karl, and when they came\r\nto Scotland they began to plunder. Then they were told that Earl Moddan\r\nwas at Thurso, in Caithness, with a large army. He had sent to Ireland\r\nfor men, because he had there many relatives and friends, and he was\r\nwaiting for these troops. Then it was thought advisable that Thorkel\r\nshould go to Caithness with a portion of the army; but Thorfinn remained\r\nin Scotland, and plundered there. Thorkel went secretly, because all the\r\ninhabitants of Caithness were true and faithful to him; and no news went\r\nof his journey till he came to Thurso by night, and surprised Earl\r\nModdan in a house, which they set on fire. Moddan was asleep in an upper\r\nstorey, and jumped out; but as he jumped down from the stair, Thorkel\r\nhewed at him with a sword, and it hit him on the neck, and took off his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nAfter this his men surrendered, but some escaped by flight. Many were\r\nslain, but some received quarter.\r\n\r\nThorkel did not stay there long, but went to Breidafiord, bringing with\r\nhim all the men he had been able to collect in Caithness, Sutherland,\r\nand Ross. He met Earl Thorfinn in Moray, and told him what he had done\r\nin his expedition, for which he received hearty thanks from the Earl,\r\nand there they both stayed for a while.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                           OF THE ORKNEYMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW it is to be told of King Karl that he went to Scotland after the\r\nbattle with Earl Thorfinn, and collected an army as well from the south\r\nas the west and east of Scotland, and all the way south from Satiri\r\n(Kintyre); the forces for which Earl Moddan had sent also came to him\r\nfrom Ireland. He sent far and near to the chieftains for men, and\r\nbrought all this army against Earl Thorfinn. They met at Torfnes,[256]\r\non the south side of Bæfiord. There was a fierce battle, and the Scots\r\nwere by far the most numerous. Earl Thorfinn was among the foremost of\r\nhis men; he had a gold-plated helmet on his head, a sword at his belt,\r\nand a spear in his hand, and he cut and thrust with both hands. It is\r\neven said that he was foremost of all his men. He first attacked the\r\nIrish division, and so fierce were he and his men, that the Irish were\r\nimmediately routed, and never regained their position. Then King Karl\r\nhad his standard brought forward against Earl Thorfinn, and there was\r\nthe fiercest struggle for a while; but it ended in the flight of the\r\nKing; and some say he was slain. Thus Arnór Jarlaskáld:\r\n\r\n                  Reddened were the wolf’s-bit’s edges\r\n                  At a place—men call it Torfness;—\r\n                  It was by a youthful ruler\r\n                  This was done, upon a Monday.\r\n                  Pliant swords were loudly ringing\r\n                  At this War-Thing, south of Ekkial,\r\n                  When the prince had joined in battle\r\n                  Bravely with the King of Scotland.\r\n\r\n                  High his helm the Lord of Hjaltland\r\n                  Bore amid the clang of weapons;\r\n                  In the battle ever foremost,\r\n                  Reddened he his gleaming spear-point\r\n                  In the wounds it gave the Irish.\r\n                  Thus my lord his mighty prowess\r\n                  Showed beneath his British buckler—\r\n                  Taking many warriors captive;\r\n                  Hlödver’s kinsman burnt the country.\r\n\r\nEarl Thorfinn drove the fugitives before him through Scotland, and\r\nsubdued the country wherever he went, and all the way south to Fife.\r\nThen he sent Thorkel Fóstri away with some of his men. When the Scots\r\nheard that the Earl had sent away some of his men, those that had\r\nsubmitted to him meant to attack him. As soon, however, as he was aware\r\nof their treachery, he called his men together and went to meet them;\r\nbut when they knew he was prepared, they hesitated to make the attack.\r\nEarl Thorfinn resolved to give battle to the Scots as soon as he met\r\nthem; but they had not the manliness to defend themselves, and ran away\r\ninto woods and deserted places; and when he had pursued the fugitives,\r\nhe called his men together, and said he would burn the whole district,\r\nand thus pay the Scots for their treachery. Then the Earl’s men went\r\nover hamlets and farms, and burnt everything, so that scarcely a hut was\r\nleft standing. Those of the men whom they found they killed, but the\r\nwomen and old people dragged themselves into woods and deserted places,\r\nwith wailings and lamentations. Some of them they drove before them, and\r\nmany were taken captives. Thus says Arnór Jarlaskáld:\r\n\r\n                Fast the flames devoured the homesteads;\r\n                Lives that day were in great peril;\r\n                Fire the Scottish kingdom ravaged—\r\n                All reduced to smoking ashes;\r\n                Great the mischief done that summer\r\n                By the mighty Slaughter-Teacher;\r\n                Three times were the luckless Scotsmen\r\n                By the Prince completely vanquished.\r\n\r\nAfter this Thorfinn went through Scotland to the north, till he reached\r\nhis ships, and subdued the country wherever he went, and did not stop\r\ntill he came to Caithness, where he spent the winter; but every season\r\nafter this he went out on expeditions, and plundered in the summer time\r\nwith all his men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                 OF THE FAMOUS DEEDS OF EARL THORFINN.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARL THORFINN made himself famous in the Orkneys by entertaining his own\r\nmen and many other men of note throughout the winter, so that no one had\r\nto go to inns—providing food and drink at his own charges, in the same\r\nmanner as chiefs in other countries, Kings, and Earls entertain their\r\nhenchmen and guests at Christmas time. About this time Earl Brúsi died,\r\nand Earl Thorfinn took possession of all the islands. But of Rögnvald,\r\nBrúsi’s son, it is said that he was in the battle of Stiklestad[257]\r\nwhen King Olaf was killed. Rögnvald escaped, with other fugitives, and\r\ncarried away King Olaf’s brother, Harald Sigurdson, who was dangerously\r\nwounded, and brought him to a small Bondi to be cured; but he himself\r\ncrossed the Kjöl,[258] and went to Jamtaland, and thence to Sweden to\r\nsee King Onund. Harald stayed with the Bondi until he had recovered from\r\nhis wounds. The Bondi then gave him his son as an attendant, and he went\r\nthrough Jamtaland to Sweden secretly. At their parting, which took place\r\nin a certain copse, Harald sang:\r\n\r\n                Though now thus here and there I’m hunted\r\n                Through the covert—small’s the honour,\r\n                Who knows but that far and wide yet\r\n                Some day shall my name be famous?\r\n\r\nHarald met Rögnvald in Sweden, and they went both of them east to\r\nGardariki (Russia), along with many others who had been with King Olaf.\r\nThey did not stop till they came east to King Jarizleif, in\r\nHólmgard;[259] and he received them most heartily for the sake of King\r\nOlaf the Holy. He took them both, as well as Erling, Rögnvald’s son,\r\ninto his service as defenders of his country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n              MAGNUS, OLAF’S SON, ACCEPTED KING OF NORWAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nRÖGNVALD, Brúsi’s son, remained in Gardariki (Russia) when Harald,\r\nSigurd’s son, went to Mikligard (Constantinople); he had the defence of\r\nthe frontier in summer, and spent the winters in Hólmgard. The King as\r\nwell as the people esteemed him highly. Rögnvald was a man of large\r\nstature and great strength, and one of the handsomest men in appearance,\r\nand his accomplishments were such that his equal was hardly to be found.\r\nArnór Jarlaskáld says that he fought ten battles in Gardar:\r\n\r\n                  So it happened that ten battles\r\n                  Fought the soldier fierce in Gardar.\r\n\r\nEinar Thambarskelfir and Kálf Arnason brought Magnus, Olaf’s son, from\r\nGardariki (Russia). Rögnvald met them in Aldeigiuborg.[260] He had\r\nnearly made an attack on Kálf before he had informed him of their\r\nbusiness. Einar said that Kálf repented of (his share in) the great\r\ncrime of having deprived King Olaf the Holy of his life and kingdom, and\r\nthat he now wished to make amends to his son Magnus. He further told\r\nRögnvald that Kálf wished to place Magnus on the throne, and support him\r\nagainst the Vikings in the pay of the Canutes. By this Rögnvald was\r\nsoftened, and now Einar Thambarskelfir asked him to go with them up to\r\nHólmgard, and introduce them and their business to King Jarizleif. He\r\nshould tell him that the Norwegians were so disgusted with the rule of\r\nthe Canutes, but most of all with Alfifa,[261] that they would prefer\r\nany hardships to serving them longer; and then he should ask King\r\nJarizleif to permit Magnus, Olaf’s son, to become their chief. When they\r\ncame there, Rögnvald, Queen Ingigerd,[262] and many of the noblemen,\r\npleaded their cause. King Jarizleif was unwilling to trust Magnus into\r\nthe hands of the Norwegians, because of their treatment of his father.\r\nAt last, however, they succeeded so far that twelve of the noblest men\r\nmade oaths to the effect that their offers were sincere; but King\r\nJarizleif trusted Rögnvald so much that he did not require him to swear.\r\nKálf promised King Magnus with an oath that he would accompany him both\r\nwithin his kingdom and out of it, and do everything to support his power\r\nand to secure his safety. Thereupon the Norwegians accepted Magnus as\r\ntheir King, and swore fealty to him.\r\n\r\nEinar and Kálf stayed in Hólmgard till after Christmas. Then they went\r\ndown to Aldeigiuborg (Ladoga), and procured ships. As soon as the sea\r\nwas open in the spring, Rögnvald, Brúsi’s son, made himself ready to go\r\nwith King Magnus. They went first to Sweden, then to Jamtaland, crossed\r\nthe Kjöl, and came to Veradal. When King Magnus came to Thrándheim, all\r\nthe population submitted to him. Then he went down to Nídarós,[263] and\r\nwas accepted King of the whole country at the Eyrar-Thing. After this\r\ncame the dealings of King Magnus and King Sveinn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n          RÖGNVALD ASKS MAGNUS FOR LEAVE TO GO TO THE ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Rögnvald, Brúsi’s son, came to Norway, he heard of the death of his\r\nfather Brúsi, and at the same time, that Earl Thorfinn had taken\r\npossession of the whole of the Islands. Then he wished to visit his odal\r\npossessions, and asked King Magnus to permit him to go. The King saw\r\nthat it was necessary for him to go, and willingly gave him permission.\r\nAt the same time, he gave him the title of Earl, and three war-ships\r\nwell equipped. He also gave him a grant of that third part of the\r\nOrkneys which King Olaf had possessed,[264] and had given to his father\r\nBrúsi. At last King Magnus promised his foster-brother his full\r\nfriendship, adding that his assistance should be at his service whenever\r\nhe required it. Thus they parted the best of friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                         OF ROGNVALD’S VOYAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARL RÖGNVALD sailed for the Orkneys, and went first to the estates\r\nwhich his father had possessed. Thence he sent messengers to his\r\nkinsman, Earl Thorfinn, and asked for that third part (of the Islands)\r\nwhich had belonged to his father. He also requested them to tell him\r\nthat he had obtained from King Magnus a grant of that third which had\r\nbelonged to King Olaf. He therefore demanded two-thirds, if it was the\r\npleasure of his kinsman Thorfinn. At this time Thorfinn had great\r\nquarrels with the Irish and the inhabitants of the Sudreyar (Hebrides),\r\nand felt himself greatly in want of assistance. He therefore gave\r\nRögnvald’s messengers the following reply:—That Rögnvald should take\r\npossession of that third which rightly belonged to him. “As for the\r\nthird which Magnus calls his own,” he said, “we gave that up to King\r\nOlaf the Holy because we were then in his power, but not because we\r\nthought it just. I and my kinsman Rögnvald will agree all the better the\r\nless we talk of that third, which has been long enough a cause of\r\ndispute. But if Rögnvald wishes to be my faithful friend, I consider\r\nthose possessions in good hands which he has for his pleasure and for\r\nthe good of us both. His assistance will soon be of greater value to me\r\nthan the revenues which I derive from them.”\r\n\r\nUpon this the messengers returned, and said he had yielded up to\r\nRögnvald two-thirds on condition that they should be allies, as it was\r\nright they should be, on account of their relationship. Rögnvald said,\r\nhowever, that he did not demand more than what he considered his own;\r\nbut as Thorfinn had so willingly given up the lands, he would indeed\r\nassist him, and be his firm friend, which was but natural, as they were\r\nso nearly related. Accordingly Rögnvald took possession of two-thirds of\r\nthe islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n            THE BATTLE OF THE KINSMEN THORFINN AND ROGNVALD.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY in the spring Thorfinn sent word to his kinsman Rögnvald, and\r\nasked him to go out with him on an expedition, bringing as many men as\r\nhe could. As soon as Rögnvald received this message, he collected\r\ntogether as many men and vessels as he could, and when he was ready he\r\nwent to meet Earl Thorfinn, who was also ready with his band. He\r\nreceived his kinsman Rögnvald very well; and they joined their forces.\r\nDuring the summer they plundered in the Sudreyar (Hebrides), and in\r\nIreland, and in Scotland’s Fiord;[265] and Thorfinn conquered the land\r\nwherever he went. They had a great battle at a place called\r\nVatnsfiord.[266] It began early in the morning, and the kinsmen gained\r\nthe victory. This is mentioned by Arnór Jarlaskáld:\r\n\r\n                 Know ye that place, Vatnsfiord?\r\n                 There was I in greatest danger;\r\n                 Marks are there of my Lord’s doings,\r\n                 He who tries the strength of warriors.\r\n                 Forth the people quickly carried\r\n                 From the ships the shields of many;\r\n                 Then was heard the dismal howling\r\n                 Of the gray wolf o’er the corpses.\r\n\r\nAfter this battle they returned to the Orkneys, and stayed at home\r\nduring the winter. Thus eight winters passed that Earl Rögnvald had\r\ntwo-thirds of the islands without any objection on the part of Earl\r\nThorfinn. Every summer they went out on war expeditions, sometimes both\r\ntogether, sometimes separately, as Arnór says:\r\n\r\n                   The chief beloved did many deeds.\r\n                   Everywhere there fell before him\r\n                   Irishmen, or British people;\r\n                   Fire devoured the Scottish kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe kinsmen agreed very well whenever they met; but when bad men went\r\nbetween them dissensions often arose. Earl Thorfinn dwelt for the most\r\npart in Caithness, at the place called Gaddgedlar,[267] where Scotland\r\nand England (?) meet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                      OF EARL THORFINN’S WARFARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE summer Earl Thorfinn made war in the Sudreyar (Hebrides) and in\r\nScotland. He had sent men into England to foray, and they carried away\r\nall the spoil they could find. But when the English became aware of the\r\npresence of the Vikings, they gathered together and attacked them. They\r\ntook from them all the cattle, and killed all the men that were of any\r\nnote, but sent back some of the reivers, and requested them to tell Earl\r\nThorfinn how they had made the Vikings tired of plunder and rapine, to\r\nwhich they added many insulting words. Thereupon the reivers went to\r\nEarl Thorfinn and told him of their mishaps. He was greatly annoyed at\r\nthe loss of his men, yet he said he could not then do anything, and that\r\nthey would have to refrain at this time; but he said he was quite able\r\nto repay the Englishmen for their mockery, and would do so if he were\r\nwell next summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n               OF EARL THORFINN’S EXPEDITION TO ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT that time Hardicanute was King of England and Denmark. Earl Thorfinn\r\nwent to the Orkneys and spent the winter there. Early in the spring he\r\ncalled out a levy from all his domains, and sent word to his kinsman\r\nRögnvald. Rögnvald assented, and called out men from all his\r\npossessions. Earl Thorfinn collected troops in Caithness and the\r\nOrkneys. He also had many from Scotland and Ireland, and from the\r\nSudreyar (Hebrides), and with all these forces he sailed to England as\r\nhe had promised. Hardicanute was in Denmark at the time. As soon as the\r\nEarls came into England they began to harry and plunder; but the chiefs\r\nwhose duty it was to defend the land went to meet them with an army.\r\nThere was a great and fierce battle, in which the Earls gained the\r\nvictory. After this they plundered far and wide in England, slaying men,\r\nand burning the dwellings of the people. This is mentioned by Arnór:\r\n\r\n                 Not forgotten was this battle\r\n                 By the English, or men ever.\r\n                 Hither came the rich ring-giver,\r\n                 With his warriors, nearly doubled;\r\n                 Swords cut keenly; under shield-boss\r\n                 Rushed all Rögnvald’s men together;\r\n                 Strong were all the old one’s people.\r\n                 South of Man did these things happen.\r\n\r\n                 On the native land of Britons\r\n                 Brought the Earl his banner forward;\r\n                 Reddened then his beak the eagle;\r\n                 Forward pressing hard his warriors,\r\n                 Battle waxed, and men diminished;\r\n                 Fugitives were chased by victors;\r\n                 Blazed the fire, with red rays gleaming\r\n                 Of the wood’s foe, leaping heavenward.\r\n\r\nEarl Thorfinn had two pitched battles in England. Besides, he had many\r\ncasual encounters, and slew many people. He stayed there throughout the\r\nsummer, and went back in autumn to the Orkneys for the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                       KALF FLEES TO THE ORKNEYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT this time Kálf Arnason was banished by King Magnus. He crossed the\r\nseas, and went to Earl Thorfinn, his brother-in-law. Thorfinn’s wife was\r\nthen Ingibiorg, the mother of the Earls (Paul and Erlend), and daughter\r\nof Earl Finn Arnason. There was great friendship between Kálf and Earl\r\nThorfinn. The Earl had a great many of his men about him, which became\r\nvery expensive to him. Then there were many who advised him not to leave\r\ntwo-thirds of the Islands to Rögnvald, since his own expenses were so\r\nlarge. Thereupon Earl Thorfinn sent men into the Islands to demand from\r\nRögnvald that third portion which had belonged to Earl Einar Rangmuth\r\n(wry-mouth).\r\n\r\nUpon receiving this message, the Earl (Rögnvald) consulted with his\r\nfriends. Then he called Earl Thorfinn’s messengers, and told them that\r\nhe had received that portion of the Islands which they claimed as a fief\r\nfrom King Magnus, and that the King called it his patrimony. “It was\r\ntherefore,” he said, “in the power of King Magnus to decide which of\r\nthem should have it; and he would not give it up if the King wished him\r\nto retain it.”\r\n\r\nThe messengers went away, and told these words to Earl Thorfinn, adding\r\nthat the third portion [which he had demanded] would certainly not be\r\ngot without trouble. On hearing this, Earl Thorfinn became very angry,\r\nand said that it was unfair if King Magnus should have the inheritance\r\nof his brother, adding that he had yielded to the demand more because he\r\nwas then in King Olaf’s power than because it was a just claim. “Now,”\r\nhe said, “I think Rögnvald does not return me well my good will in\r\nhaving left him in quiet possession for a time, if I am not to have the\r\ninheritance of my brother now except by fighting for it.” Now Earl\r\nThorfinn became so enraged that he straightway sent men to the Hebrides\r\nand to Scotland, and collected together an army, making it known that he\r\nwould march against Rögnvald, and demand that without abatement which he\r\nhad not got when he asked peacefully for it.\r\n\r\nWhen this was told to Earl Rögnvald, he called his friends together, and\r\ncomplained to them of his kinsman Thorfinn intending to come and make\r\nwar on him. He then asked what help they would offer him, saying that he\r\nwould not give up his own without a trial of strength. But when he asked\r\nthem to declare themselves, their opinions were very different. Some\r\nspoke in favour of Earl Rögnvald, and said that one could not be hard\r\nupon him for not being willing to part with his possessions; others\r\nagain said it was excusable on the part of Earl Thorfinn to desire to\r\nhave those possessions for a while which Rögnvald had had before, and\r\nwhich had belonged to Earl Einar. Further, they said it was the greatest\r\nfoolishness for Rögnvald to fight with such troops as he could get from\r\ntwo-thirds of the Islands against Thorfinn, who had one-third, with\r\nCaithness, a great deal of Scotland, and all the Hebrides besides. There\r\nwere also those who advised reconciliation. They asked Earl Rögnvald to\r\noffer Earl Thorfinn one-half of the Islands, so that they might still be\r\nfriends, as it was meet they should be, owing to their relationship. But\r\nwhen Rögnvald found that their opinions were divided, and that they all\r\ndissuaded him from resistance, he made known his determination that he\r\nwould not part with his possessions by any arrangement, but that he\r\nwould rather leave them for a time, and go to King Magnus, his\r\nfoster-brother, and see what assistance he would give him to retain\r\nthem. Then he made ready, and went to Norway, and did not rest until he\r\ncame to King Magnus, and told him how matters stood.\r\n\r\nThe King received Earl Rögnvald very well, and invited him to stay as\r\nlong as he liked, and to receive such lands from him as were sufficient\r\nto keep him and his men; but Earl Rögnvald said he wished assistance to\r\nrecover his possessions. King Magnus said he would certainly give him\r\nsuch aid as he stood in need of. Rögnvald stayed a short time in Norway,\r\nuntil he had made ready his expedition for the Orkneys. He had a\r\nnumerous and well-equipped army, which King Magnus had given him. The\r\nKing also sent word to Kálf Arnason that he should have his estates\r\nrestored to him, and be permitted to stay in Norway, if he took Earl\r\nRögnvald’s part in his dispute with Earl Thorfinn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                         BATTLE OF RAUDABIORG.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARL RÖGNVALD sailed from Norway for the Orkneys, and landed in\r\nHjaltland (Shetland), where he collected men, and went thence to the\r\nOrkneys. There he summoned his friends to meet him, and obtained\r\nreinforcements. Earl Thorfinn was in Caithness, and news soon reached\r\nhim of Earl Rögnvald’s proceedings. He collected forces from Scotland\r\nand the Sudreyar (Hebrides). Rögnvald immediately sent King Magnus’s\r\nmessage to Kálf Arnason, who apparently received very well all that the\r\nKing had said. Earl Rögnvald collected his army together in the Orkneys,\r\nintending to cross over to Caithness, and when he sailed into the\r\nPentland Firth he had thirty large ships. There he was met by Earl\r\nThorfinn, who had sixty ships, but most of them small. They met off\r\nRaudabiorg[268] (red cliff), and at once prepared for battle.\r\n\r\nKálf Arnason was there also; he had six ships, all of them large, but\r\ndid not take part in the fight.\r\n\r\nNow the battle began with the utmost fury, both Earls encouraging their\r\nmen. When the fighting had thus continued for a while, the loss of men\r\nbegan to be heaviest on Earl Thorfinn’s side, the chief cause being the\r\ngreat difference in the height of the ships. Thorfinn himself had a\r\nlarge ship, well equipped, in which he pressed forward with great\r\ndaring; but when the smaller vessels were cleared, the Earl’s ship was\r\nattacked from both sides, and they were placed in great danger. Many of\r\nthe Earl’s men were killed, and others dangerously wounded. Then Earl\r\nRögnvald commanded his men to leap on board; but when Thorfinn perceived\r\nthe imminent danger, he caused the ropes to be cut with which his ship\r\nwas fastened to the other, and rowed towards the shore. He had seventy\r\ndead bodies removed from his ship, and all those who were disabled by\r\nwounds went also on shore. Then Thorfinn ordered Arnór Jarlaskáld, who\r\nwas among the Earl’s men and high in his favour, to go on shore; and on\r\nlanding he sang these verses:—\r\n\r\n                This will I not hide from comrades,\r\n                Though ’tis right one’s chief to follow,\r\n                Yet am I myself unwilling\r\n                Thus to meet the son of Brúsi.\r\n                When these Earls so fierce in battle\r\n                Close in fight, then will our case be\r\n                Hard beyond the case of most men\r\n                In this trial of our friendship.\r\n\r\nEarl Thorfinn selected the ablest of his men to man his ship, and then\r\nhe went to see Kálf Arnason, and asked his assistance. He said that Kálf\r\nwould not be able to buy king Magnus’s friendship, since he had already\r\nbeen banished, and was therefore unable to keep the king’s favour, even\r\nwhen they were once reconciled. “You may be sure,” he added, “that if\r\nRögnvald overcomes me, and he and King Magnus become masters here in the\r\nwest, you will not be welcome in this quarter, but if I come off\r\nvictorious you shall lack nothing that it is in my power to give you. If\r\nwe two keep together we shall be a match for any one here in the west,\r\nand I hardly think you will allow yourself to lie crouching aside like a\r\ncat among stones while I am fighting for behoof of us both. Moreover our\r\nties are so close that it is more seemly for us to aid each other, since\r\nyou have no ties of blood or affinity with our enemies.”\r\n\r\nWhen Kálf heard Thorfinn’s persuasions he called his men and gave orders\r\nto fall to and fight on the side of Earl Thorfinn. Now Thorfinn and Kálf\r\nboth rowed back to the fight, and when they arrived Thorfinn’s men were\r\nready to fly, and many of them had been slain. The Earl pushed his ship\r\nforward against that of Earl Rögnvald, and a fierce fight ensued. As is\r\nsaid by Arnór Jarlaskáld—\r\n\r\n                Then I saw the two wealth-givers\r\n                Hewing down each other’s warriors.\r\n                Fierce the fight was in the Pentland,\r\n                As the sea swelled and the red rain\r\n                Crimsoned all the yielding timbers,\r\n                While from shield-rims sweat of hot blood\r\n                Dripping, stained the warriors’ garments.\r\n\r\nKálf attacked Rögnvald’s smaller ships, and speedily cleared them, as\r\nthere was a great difference in the height of the ships. When the hired\r\ntroops from Norway saw the vessels beside them cleared they cut away\r\ntheir ship and fled. Then only a few ships remained with Earl Rögnvald,\r\nand the victory began to lean the other way. So says Arnór Jarlaskáld:—\r\n\r\n                 Then the prince so fierce in battle,\r\n                 Valiant kinsman of the Vikings,\r\n                 All the old land might have conquered\r\n                 With assistance of the Islesmen.\r\n                 Fewer were his slaughtered heroes;\r\n                 But the chief’s strong men in helmets,\r\n                 All the way to northern Hjaltland,\r\n                 Chased the weak and flying remnant.\r\n\r\nAnd when the main portion of the troops had fled, Kálf and Earl Thorfinn\r\nattacked Earl Rögnvald’s ship together, and then a great number of his\r\nmen were slain. When he saw the imminent danger, and that he would not\r\nbe able to overcome Thorfinn and Kálf, he had the cables cut, and fled.\r\n\r\nIt was now late in the day, and darkness was coming on. Earl Rögnvald\r\nstood out to sea the same night, and sailed for Norway, and did not stop\r\ntill he found King Magnus, who received him well, as he had done before,\r\nand invited him to remain with him, and there he stayed some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                   EARL THORFINN SUBDUES THE ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW it is to be told of Earl Thorfinn that on the morning after the\r\nbattle he sent boats to all the islands to search for the fugitives.\r\nMany were killed, and some were pardoned. Earl Thorfinn subdued all the\r\nIslands, and made all the inhabitants his subjects, even those who had\r\nsworn allegiance to Earl Rögnvald. Thorfinn then fixed his residence in\r\nthe Orkneys, keeping a great number of men about him; he imported\r\nprovisions from Caithness, and sent Kálf Arnason to the Sudreyar\r\n(Hebrides), and ordered him to remain and maintain his authority there.\r\n\r\nWhen Earl Rögnvald had stayed with King Magnus for some time, he said to\r\nthe King that he wished to go back to the Islands. When the King heard\r\nthis he said it was not wise, and advised him to remain until the winter\r\nhad passed away and the sea was free from ice. Yet he said that he would\r\ngive him as many men as he wanted, and a sufficient number of ships.\r\nRögnvald in reply said that this time he would go without the King’s\r\nmen, adding that he could not lead an army against Earl Thorfinn without\r\na great loss of men, as he had such extensive dominions in the west.\r\n“This time,” he continued, “I intend to go to the west in a single ship,\r\nas well manned as possible; thus I expect there will be no news of us\r\nbeforehand; and if I get to the Islands I shall take them by surprise,\r\nand then we may speedily gain such a victory as could hardly, if at all,\r\nbe gained by a number of troops; but if they become aware of our\r\nmovements we can still let the sea take care of us.”\r\n\r\nKing Magnus said he might go as he pleased, and return to him when he\r\nwished.\r\n\r\nAfter this Rögnvald made his ship ready, and selected the crew\r\ncarefully. Several of King Magnus’s henchmen went with him, and\r\naltogether he had a picked crew in his vessel. When they were ready they\r\nsailed out to sea and had a fair wind. This was early in the winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                     RÖGNVALD COMES TO THE ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nRÖGNVALD first came off the coast of Hjaltland (Shetland), and heard\r\nthat Earl Thorfinn was in the Orkneys with few men, because he did not\r\nexpect any enemies in the depth of winter. Rögnvald went straightway to\r\nthe Orkneys. Earl Thorfinn was in Hrossey,[269] suspecting nothing. When\r\nRögnvald arrived in the Orkneys, he went where he had heard that Earl\r\nThorfinn was, and came upon him unawares, so that his presence was not\r\nknown until he had secured all the doors of the house in which the Earl\r\nand his men were. It was in the night time, and most of the men were\r\nasleep, but the Earl was still sitting over his drink. Rögnvald and his\r\nmen set fire to the house. When Earl Thorfinn became aware of the\r\npresence of enemies he sent men to the door to know who they were. They\r\nwere told that it was Earl Rögnvald. Then they all leaped to their\r\nweapons, but they were unable to do anything in the way of defence, as\r\nthey were all prevented from getting out. The house was soon in flames,\r\nand Earl Thorfinn said that permission should be asked for those to go\r\nout who were to receive quarter. When this was asked of Earl Rögnvald he\r\npermitted all the women and thralls to go out, but he said that most of\r\nThorfinn’s henchmen would be no better to him alive than dead. Those who\r\nwere spared were dragged out, and the house began to burn down. Earl\r\nThorfinn bethought him of a plan, and broke down part of the woodwork of\r\nthe house and leaped out there, carrying Ingibiorg, his wife, in his\r\narms. As the night was pitch dark he got away in the smoke unperceived\r\nby Earl Rögnvald’s men, and during the night he rowed alone in a boat\r\nover to Ness (Caithness). Earl Rögnvald burnt the house, with all who\r\nwere in it, and no one thought otherwise than that Earl Thorfinn had\r\nperished there.\r\n\r\nAfter this Rögnvald went over the Islands and took possession of them\r\nall. He also sent messages over to Ness (Caithness), and to the Sudreyar\r\n(Hebrides), to the effect that he intended to have all the dominions of\r\nThorfinn, and nobody spoke against him. Earl Thorfinn was then in\r\nCaithness in hiding with his friends, and no news went abroad of his\r\nescape from the burning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n                          EARL RÖGNVALD SLAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARL RÖGNVALD resided in Kirkiuvag (Kirkwall), and brought there all\r\nnecessaries for the winter; he had a great number of men, and\r\nentertained them liberally. A little before Christmas the Earl went with\r\na numerous following into little Papey[270] to fetch malt for the\r\nChristmas brewing. The evening which they stayed in the islands they sat\r\na long time round the fires to warm themselves, and he who had to keep\r\nup the fires said they were running short of fuel. Then the Earl made a\r\nslip of the tongue in speaking, and said: “We shall be old enough when\r\nthese fires are burnt out,” but he intended to have said that they would\r\nbe warm enough; and when he noticed his blunder he said: “I made a slip\r\nof the tongue in speaking just now; I do not remember that I ever did so\r\nbefore, and now I recollect what my foster-father King Olaf said at\r\nStiklestad when I noticed a slip of the tongue which he made—namely,\r\nthat if it ever so happened that I should make a slip in my speech I\r\nshould not expect to live long after it. It may be that my kinsman\r\nThorfinn is still alive.”\r\n\r\nAt that moment they heard that the house was surrounded by men. It was\r\nEarl Thorfinn and his men. They set the house on fire immediately, and\r\nheaped up a large pile before the door. Thorfinn permitted all others to\r\ncome out except Earl Rögnvald’s men, and when most of them had gone out\r\na man came to the door dressed in linen clothes only, and asked Earl\r\nThorfinn to lend a hand to the deacon; this man placed his hands on the\r\nwall and sprang over it and over the ring of men, and came down a great\r\nway off, and disappeared immediately in the darkness of the night. Earl\r\nThorfinn told his men to go after him, saying: “There went the Earl, for\r\nthat is his feat and no other man’s.” They went away, and divided into\r\nparties to search for him. Thorkel Fóstri with some others went along\r\nthe beach, and they heard the barking of a dog among the rocks by the\r\nsea. Earl Rögnvald had had his favourite dog with him. Thorkel had the\r\nEarl seized, and asked his men to kill him, offering them a reward in\r\nmoney. But no one would do it. So Thorkel Fóstri slew Earl Rögnvald\r\nhimself, as he knew that one of the two (Earls) must die. Then Earl\r\nThorfinn came up, and did not find fault with the deed. They spent the\r\nnight in the island, and all were killed who had accompanied Earl\r\nRögnvald thither.\r\n\r\nNext morning they took a barge and filled it with malt; then they went\r\non board and ranged the shields which had belonged to Earl Rögnvald and\r\nhis men along the bulwarks, neither had they more men in the barge than\r\nRögnvald had had. So they rowed to Kirkiuvag (Kirkwall); and when those\r\nof Rögnvald’s men who were there saw the vessel they thought it was Earl\r\nRögnvald and his men returning, and they went unarmed to meet them.\r\nThorfinn seized thirty of them and slew them; most of them were henchmen\r\nand friends of King Magnus. To one of the King’s henchmen the Earl gave\r\nquarter, and told him to go east to Norway and tell King Magnus the\r\ntidings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n                        EARL RÖGNVALD’S BURIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE body of Earl Rögnvald was brought to the larger Papey[271] and\r\nburied there. Men said that he was one of the most accomplished and\r\nbest-beloved of all the Earls of the Orkneys; and his death was greatly\r\nlamented by all the people.\r\n\r\nAfter this Earl Thorfinn took possession of the whole of the Islands,\r\nand no one spoke against him.\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring these tidings came east to Norway to King Magnus. He\r\nregarded the death of Rögnvald, his foster-brother, as a great loss, and\r\nsaid he would avenge him by and by, but just then he was at war with\r\nKing Swein, Ulf’s son.[272]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n                  EARL THORFINN COMES TO KING HARALD.\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT this time King Harald, Sigurd’s son,[273] King Magnus’s uncle,\r\narrived in Norway, and King Magnus gave him the half of the kingdom. One\r\nwinter they called out men from the whole of Norway, intending to go\r\nsouth to Denmark, but while they lay in Seley[274] two war ships rowed\r\ninto the harbour and up to King Magnus’s ship. A man in a white cloak\r\nwent from the [strange] ship, and along the [King’s] ship, and up to the\r\nquarterdeck. The King sat at meat; the man saluted him, and taking up a\r\nloaf he broke it and ate of it. The King received his salutation, and\r\nhanded the cup to him when he saw that he ate the bread. The King looked\r\nat him and said: “Who is this man?”\r\n\r\n“My name is Thorfinn,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Art thou Earl Thorfinn?” said the King.\r\n\r\n“So am I called in the west,” he said, “and I am here with two ships of\r\ntwenty benches, well manned considering our means, and I wish now to\r\njoin in this expedition with you, if you will accept my assistance; all\r\nmy men and I myself are in God’s power and yours, my lord, on account of\r\nmy great misdeeds by which I have offended you.”\r\n\r\nIn the meantime some men gathered together and listened to their\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“It is true, Earl Thorfinn” (said the King), “that I intended, in case\r\nwe should meet, that you should not have to tell of our parting, but now\r\nmatters stand so that it does not become my dignity to have you slain,\r\nand you shall go with me now, but the terms of our reconciliation I will\r\ndeclare when I am more at leisure.”\r\n\r\nEarl Thorfinn thanked the King and returned to his ship. The King stayed\r\na long time in Seley, and men gathered to him from Vík;[275] for he\r\nintended to sail to Jutland when he obtained a fair wind. Thorfinn was\r\noften in conversation with the King, who treated him in a friendly\r\nmanner, and had him frequently present at his councils.\r\n\r\nOne day the Earl went on board the King’s ship, and went up to the poop.\r\nThe King asked him to sit down. The Earl sat down, and they both drank\r\ntogether and were merry. A tall brave-looking man, dressed in a red\r\ntunic, came to the poop and saluted the King, who received his greeting\r\ngraciously. He was one of the King’s henchmen. He said: “I have come to\r\nsee you, Earl Thorfinn.”\r\n\r\n“What is your business with me?” said the Earl.\r\n\r\n“I wish to know what compensation you intend to give me for my brother\r\nwho was killed by your orders out west in Kirkiuvag (Kirkwall), along\r\nwith others of King Magnus’s henchmen.”\r\n\r\n“Have you never heard,” said the Earl, “that it is not my wont to pay\r\nmoney for the men whom I cause to be killed?”\r\n\r\n“I have nothing to do with how you have treated other people, if you pay\r\nthe manbote for him for whom it devolves on me to seek compensation. I\r\nalso lost some money there myself, and was shamefully treated. It is\r\nmore binding on me than any one else to seek redress for my brother and\r\nmyself, and therefore I now demand it. The King may remit offences\r\ncommitted against himself, even if he thinks it of no importance that\r\nhis henchmen are led out and slaughtered like sheep.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl answered: “I understand it to be to my advantage here that I am\r\nnot in your power. Are not you the man to whom I gave quarter there?”\r\n\r\n“True enough,” said he, “it was in your power to have killed me like the\r\nothers.”\r\n\r\nThen the Earl said: “Now the saying proves true—‘That often happens to\r\nmany which they least expect.’ I never thought I should be so placed\r\nthat it would be injurious to me to have been too generous to my\r\nenemies; but now I have to pay for having given you quarter; you would\r\nnot have denounced me to-day in the presence of chiefs if I had caused\r\nyou to be killed like your comrades.”\r\n\r\nThe King looked at the Earl and said: “There it comes out still, Earl\r\nThorfinn, that you think you have killed too few of my henchmen without\r\ncompensation.” While saying this the king turned blood-red [with anger].\r\nThe Earl started up and left the poop, and returned to his own ship, and\r\nall was quiet during the evening. In the morning, when the men awoke, a\r\nfair wind had sprung up, and they rowed away from the harbour. The King\r\nsailed south to Jutland with the whole fleet. In the earlier part of the\r\nday the Earl’s ship stood out farther to sea, and in the afternoon he\r\ntook a westerly course, and there is nothing to be told of him till he\r\narrived in the Orkneys, and resumed the government of his dominions.\r\n\r\nKing Magnus and Harald sailed to Denmark, and spent the summer there.\r\nKing Swein was unwilling to meet them, and stayed in Skàney[276] with\r\nhis army. That summer King Magnus was seized with an illness of which he\r\ndied; but he had previously declared that he gave the whole kingdom of\r\nNorway to his uncle Harald.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n           EARL THORFINN’S MESSAGE TO KING HARALD (HARDRADI).\r\n\r\n\r\nEARL THORFINN now ruled the Orkneys and all his dominions. Kálf Arnason\r\nwas frequently with him. Sometimes he made viking expeditions to the\r\nwest, and plundered in Scotland and Ireland. He was also in England, and\r\nat one time he was the chief of the Thingmen.\r\n\r\nWhen Earl Thorfinn heard of the death of King Magnus, he sent men to\r\nNorway to King Harald with a friendly message, saying that he wished to\r\nbecome his friend. When the messengers reached the King he received them\r\nwell, and promised the Earl his friendship. When the Earl received this\r\nmessage from the King he made himself ready, taking from the west two\r\nships of twenty benches, with more than a hundred men, all fine troops,\r\nand went east to Norway. He found the King in Hördaland, and he received\r\nhim exceedingly well, and at their parting the King gave him handsome\r\npresents. From thence the Earl went southwards along the coast to\r\nDenmark. He went through the country, and found King Svein in\r\nAlaborg;[277] he invited him to stay, and made a splendid feast for him.\r\nThen the Earl made it known that he was going to Rome;[278] but when he\r\ncame to Saxland he called on the Emperor Heinrek, who received him\r\nexceedingly well, and gave him many valuable presents. He also gave him\r\nmany horses, and the Earl rode south to Rome, and saw the Pope, from\r\nwhom he obtained absolution for all his sins.\r\n\r\nThen the Earl returned, and arrived safely home in his dominions. He\r\nleft off making war expeditions, and turned his mind to the government\r\nof his land and his people, and to the making of laws. He resided\r\nfrequently in Birgishérad (Birsay), and built there Christ’s Kirk, a\r\nsplendid church; and there was the first Bishop’s see in the Orkneys.\r\n\r\nThorfinn’s wife was Ingibiorg, [called] the mother of the Earls. They\r\nhad two sons who arrived at manhood; one was called Paul, the other\r\nErlend. They were men of large stature, fine-looking, wise, and gentle,\r\nmore resembling their mother’s relations. They were much loved by the\r\nEarl and all the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n                       OF EARL THORFINN’s DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARL THORFINN retained all his dominions to his dying day, and it is\r\ntruly said that he was the most powerful of all the Earls of the\r\nOrkneys. He obtained possession of eleven Earldoms in Scotland, all the\r\nSudreyar (Hebrides), and a large territory in Ireland. So says Arnór\r\nJarlaskáld—\r\n\r\n                Unto Thorfinn, ravens’ feeder,\r\n                Armies had to yield obedience\r\n                From Thussasker[279] right on to Dublin.\r\n                Truth I tell, as is recorded.\r\n\r\nEarl Thorfinn was five winters old when Malcolm[280] the King of Scots,\r\nhis mother’s father, gave him the title of Earl, and after that he was\r\nEarl for seventy winters. He died towards the end of Harald Sigurdson’s\r\nreign.[281] He is buried at Christ’s Kirk in Birgishérad (Birsay), which\r\nhe had built. He was much lamented in his hereditary dominions; but in\r\nthose parts which he had conquered by force of arms many considered it\r\nvery hard to be under his rule, and [after his death] many provinces\r\nwhich he had subdued turned away and sought help from the chiefs who\r\nwere odal-born to the government of them.[282] Then it soon became\r\napparent how great a loss Thorfinn’s death was to his dominions.\r\n\r\nThe following stanzas were made about the battle between Earl Rögnvald,\r\nBrùsi’s son, and Earl Thorfinn:—\r\n\r\n                 Since the Earls have broken friendship\r\n                 Peace I can enjoy no longer.\r\n                 Feasts of corpses to the ravens\r\n                 Each has in his turn provided.\r\n                 Off the Islands were the blue tents\r\n                 By the mighty rent asunder,\r\n                 Dabbled were the foul birds’ feathers\r\n                 In red blood ’neath lofty branches.\r\n\r\n                 Have ye heard how Kalfr followed\r\n                 Finnr’s son-in-law in battle?\r\n                 Quickly didst thou push thy vessels\r\n                 ’Gainst the Earl’s ships on the water.\r\n                 To destroy the son of Brúsi,\r\n                 Thou, courageous ship’s commander\r\n                 Wast unwilling, but of hatred\r\n                 Mindful, didst thou help Thorfinn.\r\n\r\n                 When the Earls had joined in battle\r\n                 Misery there was unbounded.\r\n                 Thick and fast the men were falling\r\n                 In the struggle; sad the hour when\r\n                 Nearer went the daring Eastmen\r\n                 To the unexampled fire-rain.\r\n                 In that battle off the Red Biorg\r\n                 Many a noble man was wounded.\r\n\r\n                 Swarthy shall become the bright sun,\r\n                 In the black sea shall the earth sink,\r\n                 Finished shall be Austri’s labour,\r\n                 And the wild sea hide the mountains,\r\n                 Ere there be in those fair Islands\r\n                 Born a chief to rule the people—\r\n                 May our God both help and keep them—\r\n                 Greater than the lost Earl Thorfinn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n             OF THE EARLS PAUL AND ERLEND, AND GENEALOGIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW the sons of Earl Thorfinn succeeded him. Paul was the elder of the\r\ntwo, and he ruled for both of them. They did not divide their\r\npossessions, yet they almost always agreed in their dealings.\r\n\r\nIngibiorg, the mother of the Earls, was married to Malcolm, King of\r\nScots,[283] who was called Langháls (Longneck), and their son was\r\nDuncan, King of Scots, the father of William the excellent man; his son\r\nwas called William Odling (the Noble), whom all the Scots wished to have\r\nfor their King.[284]\r\n\r\nEarl Paul, Thorfinn’s son, married the daughter of Earl Hákon, Ivar’s\r\nson, by whom he had many children. They had a son called Hákon, and a\r\ndaughter called Thóra, who was married in Norway to Haldór, son of\r\nBrynjúlf Ulfaldi (camel). Another son of theirs, named Brynjúlf, married\r\nGyrid, Dag’s daughter. A second daughter of Paul, called Ingirid, was\r\nmarried to Einar Vorsakrák. Herbiörg was the third daughter of Paul. She\r\nwas the mother of Ingibiorg Ragna, who was married to Sigurd of\r\nWestness; their sons were Hákon Pík, and Brynjúlf. Sigrid was a second\r\ndaughter of Herbiörg. She was the mother of Hakon Barn and of Herborg,\r\nwho was married to Kolbein Hruga. The fourth daughter of Earl Paul was\r\nRagnhild, who was the mother of Benidikt, the father of Ingibiorg, the\r\nmother of Erling Erkidiákn (archdeacon). Ragnhild had a daughter, by\r\nname Bergliót, who was married to Hávard, Gunnar’s son. Their sons were\r\nMagnus, Hákon Kló (claw), Dúfniál, and Thorstein. All those were the\r\nfamilies of Earls and chiefs in the Orkneys, and all of them will be\r\nmentioned in this Saga afterwards. The wife of Earl Erlend, Thorfinn’s\r\nson, was Thóra, the daughter of Sumarlidi, Ospak’s son; the mother of\r\nOspak was Thórdís, the daughter of Hall of Sída (in Iceland). Their sons\r\nwere Erling and Magnus, and their daughters Gunnhild, and Cecilia, who\r\nwas married to Isak, and their sons were Indridi and Kol. Erling had a\r\nnatural daughter called Játvör; her son was Berg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n       HERE IS TOLD OF THE DEATH OF KING HARALD AND HIS DAUGHTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the brothers Paul and Erlend had succeeded to the government of the\r\nOrkneys, King Harald Sigurdson (Hardradi) came from Norway with a large\r\narmy. He first touched Hjaltland; from thence he went to the Orkneys,\r\nand left there his Queen Ellisif, and their daughters Maria and\r\nIngigerd. From the Orkneys he had many troops; both the Earls went with\r\nhim on the expedition. He went from Orkney to England, and landed at a\r\nplace called Klifland (Cleaveland), and took Skardaborg (Scarborough).\r\nThen he touched at Hallarnes (Holderness), and had a battle there, in\r\nwhich he was victorious. The Wednesday next before Matthiasmas (20th\r\nSeptember) he had a battle at Jórvík (York) with the Earls Valthióf and\r\nMórukári. Mórukári was slain there.[285] Next Sunday the borg at\r\nStamfordbridge surrendered to him; and he went on shore to arrange the\r\ngovernment of the town; and there he left his son Olaf, the Earls Paul\r\nand Erlend, and his brother-in-law Eystein Orri. While he was on shore\r\nhe was met by Harald Gudinason (Godwinson) at the head of a numerous\r\narmy. In that battle King Harald Sigurdson fell. After the death of the\r\nKing, Eystein Orri and the Earls arrived from the ship, and made a stout\r\nresistance. There Eystein Orri fell, and almost the whole army of the\r\nNorthmen with him.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle King Harald (Godwinson) permitted Olaf, the son of King\r\nHarald Sigurdson, and the Earls to leave England, with all the troops\r\nthat had not fled. Olaf sailed in the autumn from Hrafnseyri[286] to the\r\nOrkneys. The same day and at the same hour as King Harald fell, his\r\ndaughter Maria died, and it is said that they had but one life.\r\n\r\nOlaf spent the winter in the Orkneys, and was very friendly to the\r\nEarls, his kinsmen. Thóra, the mother of King Olaf, and Ingibiorg, the\r\nmother of the Earls, were daughters of two brothers. In the spring Olaf\r\nwent to Norway, and was made King along with his brother Magnus.\r\n\r\nWhile the brothers (Paul and Erlend) ruled the Orkneys they agreed\r\nextremely well a long time; but when their sons came to manhood Erling\r\nand Hákon became very violent. Magnus was the quietest of them all. They\r\nwere all men of large stature, and strong, and accomplished in\r\neverything. Hákon, Paul’s son, wished to take the lead among his\r\nbrothers; he considered himself of higher birth than the sons of Erlend,\r\nas he was the daughter’s son of Earl Hákon Ivar’s son, and Ragnhild, the\r\ndaughter of King Magnus the Good. Hákon wished his friends to have the\r\nlion’s share of everything before those who leant to the sons of Erlend,\r\nbut Erlend did not like his sons to be inferior to any in the Islands.\r\nMatters went so far that the kinsmen could not be together without\r\ndanger. Then their fathers persuaded them to compose their differences.\r\nA meeting was appointed, but it soon became apparent that each [of the\r\nfathers] was inclined to take the part of his sons, and therefore they\r\ndid not agree. Thus dissensions arose between the brothers, and they\r\nparted without coming to an agreement, which was by many considered a\r\ngreat misfortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n                          A MEETING OF PEACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER this well-disposed men interfered and tried to reconcile them. A\r\nmeeting for reconciliation was appointed in Hrossey,[287] and at that\r\nmeeting they made peace on the understanding that the Islands should be\r\ndivided in two shares, as they had been between Thorfinn and Brúsi, and\r\nthus matters stood for a while.\r\n\r\nWhen Hákon had arrived at the age of manhood he was continually on war\r\nexpeditions. He became a very violent man, and greatly molested those\r\nwho adhered to Erlend and his sons; and this went so far that they came\r\nto open enmity a second time, and attacked each other with numerous\r\ntroops. Hávard, Gunnar’s son, and all the principal friends of the\r\nEarls, consulted once more and tried to make peace between them. This\r\ntime Erlend and his sons refused to make peace if Hákon remained in the\r\nIslands; and because their friends considered their quarrels so\r\ndangerous to themselves, they besought Hákon not to let the condition\r\nthat he should leave the Islands for a time stand in the way of peace.\r\nThen, by the advice of good men, they became reconciled.\r\n\r\nAfter this Hákon left the Islands, and first went east to Norway, and\r\nsaw there King Olaf Kyrri (the quiet), and stayed with him for a while.\r\nThis was towards the end of his reign. After that he went east to Sweden\r\nto King Ingi, Steinkel’s son, who received him well. He found friends\r\nand kinsmen there, and was highly honoured on account of the esteem in\r\nwhich Hákon, his mother’s father, was held. He had possessions from\r\nSteinkel, the King of the Swedes, ever since he was banished by King\r\nHarald, Sigurd’s son, and became greatly beloved both by the King and\r\nthe people. A second daughter’s son of Earl Hákon, Ivar’s son, was Hákon\r\nwho was called the Norwegian; he was the father of King Eirík Spaki (the\r\nwise), who was King of Denmark after Eirík Eymuni (the ever-remembered).\r\n\r\nHákon remained in Sweden for a while, and was well treated by King Ingi.\r\nBut when some time had passed in this way he felt so home-sick that he\r\nwanted to go west again to the Islands. Christianity then was young, and\r\nnewly planted in Sweden. Many men still dabbled in ancient lore, and\r\nwere persuaded that by such means they were able to ascertain future\r\nevents. King Ingi was a good Christian man, and loathed all those that\r\nmeddled in ancient [superstitious] lore, and made strenuous efforts to\r\nabolish the evil customs which for a long time had accompanied\r\nheathenism; but the chiefs and leading Bœndr murmured loudly if they\r\nwere reproved for their evil habits, and at last matters went so far\r\nthat the Bœndr elected another King, Swein, the brother of the Queen,\r\nwho permitted them to make sacrifices, and was therefore called\r\n“Sacrificing Swein.” King Ingi had to flee from him to Western Gautland\r\n(Gothland); but their dealings ended thus, that King Ingi caught Swein\r\nby surprise in a house, and burnt the house and him in it. After this he\r\nsubdued the whole country, and uprooted many wicked customs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n                     OF THE WORDS OF THE SPAE-MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Hákon, Paul’s son, was in Sweden he had heard of a man in that\r\ncountry who practised sorcery and spae-craft, whether he used for those\r\npurposes witchcraft or other magical arts. Hákon became very curious to\r\nsee this man, and anxious to know what he could ascertain about his\r\nfuture. So he went in search of the man, and at last he found him in a\r\nseaside district, where he went from one feast to another, and foretold\r\nthe seasons and other things to the country people. When Hákon had found\r\nthis man, he inquired of him whether he would succeed in regaining his\r\ndominions, or what other fortune awaited him. The spae-man asked him who\r\nhe was, and he told him his name and family—that he was the daughter’s\r\nson of Hákon, Ivar’s son.\r\n\r\nThe spae-man then said: “Why should you ask foresight or knowledge of\r\nthe future from me? You know well that your kinsmen have had little\r\nliking for such men as I am; and yet it might be necessary for you to\r\ntry to ascertain your fate from your friend, Olaf the Stout, in whom all\r\nyour faith is placed; but I suspect that he would not condescend to tell\r\nyou what you are anxious to know, or else he may not be so mighty as you\r\ncall him.”\r\n\r\nHákon answered: “I will not reproach him, and I should rather think I\r\nwas not worthy to learn wisdom from him, than that he was incapable; so\r\nthat I might learn from him for that matter. But I have come to you,\r\nbecause I thought that we had no reason to envy each other on account of\r\nvirtue or religion.”\r\n\r\nThe spae-man replied: “I am glad to find that you place your entire\r\ntrust in me, and not in that faith which you and your kinsmen profess.\r\nTruly they who apply themselves to such things are strange men. They\r\nkeep fasts and vigils, and believe that by such means they will be able\r\nto ascertain that which they desire to know; but the more they apply\r\nthemselves to these things, the less they ascertain of what they wish to\r\nknow when it is most important to them to know it. But we undergo no\r\nbodily pains, yet we always obtain knowledge of those things which it is\r\nof importance to our friends not to be ignorant of. Now matters will go\r\nbetween us in this way, that I shall help you because I understand that\r\nyou think you will rather obtain the truth from me than from the\r\npreachers of King Ingi, in whom he puts his entire trust. After three\r\nnights’ time you shall come to me, and then we shall try whether I may\r\nbe able to tell you any of the things you wish to know.”\r\n\r\nUpon this they parted, and Hákon stayed in the district. When three\r\nnights had passed, he went again to see the spae-man. He was in a\r\ncertain house alone, and groaned heavily as Hákon entered. He passed his\r\nhand across his forehead, and said that it had cost him much pain to\r\nobtain the knowledge which Hákon desired. Hákon then said he wished to\r\nhear his future.\r\n\r\nThe spae-man said: “If you wish your whole fate unfolded, it is long to\r\ntell, for there is a great future in store for you, and grand events\r\nwill happen at certain periods of your life. I foresee that you will at\r\nlast become the sole ruler of the Orkneys; but you will perhaps think\r\nyou have long to wait. I also see that your sons will rule there. Your\r\nnext journey to the Orkneys will be a very eventful one, when its\r\nconsequences appear. In your days you will also commit a crime,[288] for\r\nwhich you may or may not obtain pardon from the God in whom you believe.\r\nYour steps go farther out into the world than I am able to trace, yet I\r\nthink you will rest your bones in the northern parts. Now I have told\r\nyou what has been given me to tell you at this time, but what\r\nsatisfaction you may have derived from your visit rests with yourself.”\r\n\r\nHákon replied: “Great things you have foretold, if they turn out to be\r\ntrue; but I think my fate will prove itself better than you have said;\r\nand perhaps you have not seen the truth.”\r\n\r\nThe spae-man said he was free to believe what he liked of it, but that\r\nsuch events would not the less surely come to pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n                  OF THE SCHEMES OF HAKON, PAUL’S SON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER this Hákon went to see King Ingi, and stayed with him a short\r\nwhile. Then he obtained leave from the King to depart. He went first to\r\nNorway to see his kinsman, King Magnus, who received him very well.\r\nThere he heard that the government of the Orkneys was almost exclusively\r\nin the hands of Earl Erlend and his sons, and that they were greatly\r\nloved, but that his father Paul took little part in the government. He\r\nalso thought he could perceive from conversations with men from the\r\nOrkneys, who gave him a true account of the state of matters, that the\r\nOrkneymen had no desire for his return home. They were living in peace\r\nand quiet, and were afraid that Hákon’s return would give rise to\r\ndisturbance and strife. When Hákon was turning this over in his mind, he\r\nthought it likely that his kinsmen would try to keep him out of his\r\npossessions, and that it would be dangerous for him if he did not go\r\nwest with a numerous retinue. Then he devised a scheme to induce King\r\nMagnus to put him into his possessions in the Orkneys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n                  HAKON’S INTERVIEW WITH KING MAGNUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS was after King Magnus had put Steigar Thórir and Egil to death, and\r\nput down all opposition to his rule. Hákon was a sagacious man, and he\r\nthought he could understand from King Magnus’s conversation that he was\r\nambitious of grand undertakings, and covetous of the possessions of\r\nother rulers. Hákon began to tell the King that it would be a princely\r\nfeat to make an expedition to the west, and subdue the Islands, as\r\nHarald the Fairhaired had done. He also said that if he established his\r\npower in the Sudreyar (Hebrides), he might easily make forays into\r\nIreland and Scotland from them. Then, having subdued the western\r\ncountries, he might attack the English, with the help of the Northmen,\r\nand thus take revenge for his grandfather Harald, Sigurd’s son.\r\n\r\nWhen they were speaking about these things, it became evident that the\r\nKing was pleased with this proposal, and said it was spoken like a\r\nnobleman, and quite according to his own mind. “But I wish you not to be\r\nsurprised, Hákon,” said the King, “in case I shall be persuaded by your\r\nwords to carry an army into the west, if I put forward a strong claim to\r\nthe possessions there, without regard to the claims of any man.”\r\n\r\nWhen Hákon heard this suggestion, he was not so well pleased, because he\r\nsuspected the real meaning of the King’s words; and after this he no\r\nlonger persuaded the King to go; neither was it required, for after\r\ntheir conversation, the King sent messages throughout his dominions to\r\nmake known that he was soon to lead out an expedition, and then he made\r\nit known to the people that he was going to the west, whatever might be\r\nthe result. Preparations were made for the expedition throughout the\r\nwhole kingdom. King Magnus took with him his son Sigurd, who was eight\r\nwinters old, and a hopeful boy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n               THE WESTERN EXPEDITION OF MAGNUS BARELEGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN the brothers Paul and Erlend ruled the Orkneys, King Magnus came\r\nfrom Norway. He had a large army. Many of his vassals followed him,\r\namong whom were Vidkunn Jonsson, Sigurd Hrani’s son, Serk from Sogn, Dag\r\nEilif’s son, Skapti from Gizki, Ogmund, Finn and Thórd, Eyvind Olnbogi\r\n(the King’s High Steward), Kali, Snæbiörn’s son from Agdir, the son of\r\nThorleif Spaki (the wise) who was maimed by Hallfred, and Kol his son.\r\nKali was a very wise man, much esteemed by the king, and made verses\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nWhen King Magnus came to the Orkneys, he seized the Earls Paul and\r\nErlend, and sent them east to Norway, but placed his son Sigurd over the\r\nIsles, and gave him counsellors. King Magnus went to the Sudreyar\r\n(Hebrides), accompanied by Magnus and Erling, the sons of Earl Erlend,\r\nand Hákon, Paul’s son. But when King Magnus came to the Islands, he\r\nbegan hostilities first at Liódhús (Lewis), and gained a victory there.\r\nIn this expedition he subdued the whole of the Sudreyar, and seized\r\nLögman, the son of Gudröd, King of the Western Islands. Thence he went\r\nto Bretland (Wales), and fought a great battle in Anglesea Sound with\r\ntwo British chiefs[289]—Hugh the Stout and Hugh the Bold. When the men\r\ntook up their arms and buckled for the fight, Magnus, Erlend’s son, sat\r\ndown on the foredeck, and did not take his arms. The King asked why he\r\ndid not do so. He said he had nothing against any one there, and would\r\nnot therefore fight.\r\n\r\nThe King said: “Go down below, and do not lie among other people’s feet\r\nif you dare not fight, for I do not believe that you do this from\r\nreligious motives.”\r\n\r\nMagnus took a psalter and sang during the battle, and did not shelter\r\nhimself. The battle was long and fiercely contested, and both swords and\r\nmissiles were used. For a long time the result of the battle was\r\ndoubtful. King Magnus shot from a bow, and a man from Hálogaland[290]\r\nwas with him. Hugh the Bold fought valiantly. He had a suit of armour\r\nwhich covered him entirely, except his eyes. King Magnus ordered the man\r\nfrom Hálogaland to shoot at the same time as he did, and they shot both\r\nat once. One of the arrows struck the nose-piece of the helmet, and the\r\nother pierced the eye, and that was said to be the king’s arrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n                             KALI’S DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER Hugh’s death the British (Normans) fled, and King Magnus obtained\r\na great victory. He lost there many brave men, and many others were\r\nwounded. Kali had received many wounds, but none mortal. After the\r\nbattle King Magnus sailed from the south along the coasts of Bretland\r\nand Scotland, having conquered all the Sudreyar and Anglesea, which is\r\none-third of Bretland.\r\n\r\nKing Magnus had appointed Magnus, Erlend’s son, as one of the waiters at\r\nhis table, and he performed continually the duties of that office; but\r\nafter the battle in Anglesea Sound the king showed that Magnus had\r\nincurred his serious displeasure. He had not been wounded, although he\r\nhad not sheltered himself. During the night he stole away from the King,\r\nand hid himself for some time in the woods, while the King’s men made a\r\nsearch for him. Magnus made his way to the court of Malcolm,[291] the\r\nKing of Scots, and remained there a while. For some time he was with a\r\ncertain bishop in Bretland. He was also in England; but he did not come\r\nto the Orkneys while King Magnus was alive.\r\n\r\nKing Magnus held northward, along the coasts of Scotland, and messengers\r\ncame to him from Malcolm, the King of Scots, to ask for peace. They said\r\nthat the King of Scots was willing to give him all the islands lying\r\nwest of Scotland, between which and the mainland he could pass in a\r\nvessel with the rudder shipped. Thereupon King Magnus landed in Satiri\r\n(Kintyre), and had a boat drawn across the neck (isthmus) of\r\nSatiri,[292] he himself holding the helm, and thus he gained possession\r\nof the whole of Satiri, which is better than the best island of the\r\nSudreyar, Man excepted. It is in the west of Scotland, and on the land\r\nside there is a narrow isthmus, across which vessels are frequently\r\ndrawn. Thence King Magnus went to the Sudreyar, and sent his men into\r\nScotland’s Fiord.[293] They rowed in along one coast and out along\r\nanother, and thus took possession of all the islands west of Scotland.\r\n\r\nThen the King made it known that he was going to spend the winter in the\r\nSudreyar, but gave permission to those who had most urgent business to\r\ngo home. When the troops knew this, they all wished to go home, and\r\nmurmured greatly at being longer detained. The King then held a council\r\nwith his advisers, and looked at the wounds of his men. He saw Kali, and\r\nasked about his wounds. Kali said they did not heal well, and that he\r\ndid not know what the end would be. The King asked for his advice. Kali\r\nsaid: “Is it not so that your friends are now failing you?” The King\r\nsaid he did not think so. Kali asked him to hold a wapinschaw, and thus\r\nto ascertain the number of his troops. This the King did; then he missed\r\nmany men. This he told to Kali. Then Kali sang:\r\n\r\n                  How do thy great chiefs repay thee\r\n                  For the bounties lavished on them?\r\n                  Now, O King, of this make trial—\r\n                  On western currents ships are shaken.\r\n\r\nThe King replied:\r\n\r\n                  Surely it was in my folly\r\n                  That my wealth I gave to these men;\r\n                  Yet my long ships, swiftly speeding,\r\n                  Still shall climb the chilly billows.\r\n\r\nAfter this the King kept a watch to prevent men from deserting.\r\n\r\nWhen King Magnus was in the Sudreyar, he obtained the hand of Biadmonia,\r\nthe daughter of Mýrkiartan,[294] the son of Thiálbi, the King of the\r\nIrish in Kunnáttir (Connaught), for his son Sigurd, who was then nine\r\nwinters old, and she five. This winter Kali died from his wounds. Sigurd\r\nSneis (slice), Kali’s kinsman, a Lenderman from Agdir, had fallen in\r\nAnglesea Sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n                       BIRTH OF KALI, SON OF KOL.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY in the spring King Magnus left the Sudreyar, and went first to the\r\nOrkneys, where he heard of the death of the Earls. Erlend died in\r\nNidaros,[295] and was buried there; and Paul died in Biörgvin (Bergen).\r\nThen King Magnus married Gunnhild, the daughter of Earl Erlend, to Kol,\r\nKali’s son, in order to compensate him for (the loss of) his father. Her\r\ndowry consisted of possessions in the Orkneys, including a farm at\r\nPapul.[296] Some say that Erling, Erlend’s son, fell in Anglesea Sound,\r\nbut Snorri Sturluson says he fell in Uladstir[297] with King Magnus. At\r\nhis wedding Kol became King Magnus’s vassal. Afterwards he went to\r\nNorway with the King, and home to Agdir with his wife, and went to\r\nreside at his estates there. Kol and Gunnhild had two children; their\r\nson was called Kali, and their daughter Ingirid. They were both very\r\npromising children, and brought up with affectionate care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n                           SIGURD MADE KING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Magnus had been king nine winters, he went to the west, and made\r\nwar in Ireland, and spent the winter in Kunnáttir (Connaught). The next\r\nsummer, on St. Bartholomew’s Day, he fell in Uladstir (Ulster). When\r\nSigurd heard in the Orkneys of the death of his father, he went\r\nimmediately to Norway, and was made king, along with his brothers\r\nEystein and Olaf. He had left the daughter of the Irish king in the\r\nwest.\r\n\r\nOne winter or two after the death of King Magnus, Hákon, Paul’s son,\r\ncame from the west, and the kings gave him an earl’s title and\r\npossessions beseeming his birth. Then he returned to the west and took\r\npossession of the Orkneys. He had always accompanied King Magnus while\r\nhe was alive. He was with him in his expedition to Gautland, which is\r\nmentioned in the song made about Hákon, Paul’s son.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n            MAGNUS (ERLEND’S SON) OBTAINS THE TITLE OF EARL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Earl Hákon had ruled the Orkneys for some time, Magnus, the son of\r\nEarl Erlend, came from Scotland, and wished to take possession of his\r\npatrimony. The Bœndr were highly pleased with this, for he was beloved\r\namong them, and had many kinsmen and connections who wished to help him\r\nto his dominions. His mother was married to a man called Sigurd. Their\r\nson was named Hákon Karl (man). They had estates in Papul. When Earl\r\nHákon heard that Earl Magnus had come to the Orkneys, he collected men\r\ntogether, and refused to give up any part of the Islands. But their\r\nfriends tried to make peace between them, and at last they succeeded so\r\nfar that Hákon consented to give up half of his dominions if the Kings\r\nof Norway approved of it. Magnus went immediately to Norway to see King\r\nEystein, for King Sigurd had then gone to Jerusalem.[298] King Eystein\r\nreceived him exceedingly well, and gave up to him his patrimony,\r\none-half of the Orkneys, with the title of Earl. Thereupon Magnus went\r\nwest to his dominions, and his kinsmen and friends and all the people\r\nwere glad to see him back. Through the kind offices of mutual friends,\r\nMagnus and Hákon agreed very well. So long as their friendship continued\r\nthere were good times and peace in the Orkneys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n                     OF EARL MAGNUS (ERLEND’S SON).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE holy Magnus, Earl of the Islands, was a most excellent man. He was\r\nof large stature, a man of a noble presence and intellectual\r\ncountenance. He was of blameless life, victorious in battles, wise,\r\neloquent, strong-minded, liberal and magnanimous, sagacious in counsels,\r\nand more beloved than any other man. To wise men and good he was gentle\r\nand affable in his conversation; but severe and unsparing with robbers\r\nand vikings. Many of those who plundered the landowners and the\r\ninhabitants of the land he caused to be put to death. He also seized\r\nmurderers and thieves, and punished rich and poor impartially for\r\nrobberies and thefts and all crimes. He was just in his judgments, and\r\nhad more respect to divine justice than difference in the estates of\r\nmen. He gave large presents to chiefs and rich men, yet the greatest\r\nshare of his liberality was given to the poor. In all things he strictly\r\nobeyed the divine commands; and he chastened his body in many things,\r\nwhich in his glorious life were known to God, but hidden from men. Thus,\r\nhe made known his intention to espouse a maiden of a most excellent\r\nfamily in Scotland, and having celebrated his marriage, he lived with\r\nher for ten winters free from the defilement of carnal lusts, for he was\r\npure and spotless with regard to all such sins, and if he were tempted,\r\nhe bathed in cold water, and prayed for divine assistance. Many other\r\nglorious virtues he exhibited to God himself, but concealed from men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n                          OF MAGNUS AND HAKON.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNUS and Hákon ruled their lands and defended them for some time, the\r\ntwo agreeing very well. In a song made about them, it is said that they\r\nfought with a chief called Dúfniál, their third cousin, who fell before\r\nthem. They also slew a famous man named Thorbiörn, in Borgarfiord,[299]\r\nin Hjaltland. Other deeds of theirs are set forth in song, though not\r\nspecially narrated here. When they had ruled the land for some time, it\r\nhappened, as often is the case, that men of evil dispositions were found\r\nwho destroyed their good understanding. Hákon was more disposed to\r\nlisten to these miserable men, because he was very jealous of the\r\npopularity and greatness of his kinsman Magnus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n                            OF EARL MAGNUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO men with Earl Hákon are chiefly mentioned as being the worst in\r\ncreating enmity between the two kinsmen. These were Sigurd and Sighvat\r\nSokki (sock). Through the slander of wicked men this enmity went so far\r\nthat the Earls gathered troops together and went to meet each other.\r\nBoth went to Hrossey, where the Orkney Thingstead[300] was, and when\r\nthey arrived there, both drew up their troops in battle array, and\r\nprepared to fight. There were both the Earls and all the chief men, many\r\n(of whom) were friends of both, and did all they could to make peace\r\nbetween them, showing much goodwill and virtuous disposition. This\r\nmeeting was during Lent. But, as many well-disposed men joined\r\nthemselves together to avert hostilities between them, and to assist\r\nneither of them against the other, they confirmed their reconciliation\r\nwith oaths and shaking of hands.\r\n\r\nSome time after this, Earl Hákon, with hypocrisy and fair words,\r\nappointed a day of meeting with the blessed Earl Magnus, so that their\r\nfriendship and the newly-made peace should neither be disturbed nor\r\ndestroyed. This meeting, which was to confirm their peace and\r\nreconciliation, should take place in the spring, in the Pasch week, in\r\nEgilsey.[301] Earl Magnus was well pleased with this arrangement, as he\r\nthought it was meant to confirm a sincere peace, without any suspicions,\r\ntreachery, or covetousness. Each of them should have two ships and an\r\nequal number of men (at the conference). Both swore to keep the peace,\r\non conditions dictated by the wisest men.\r\n\r\nImmediately after Easter, preparations were made for the meeting. Earl\r\nMagnus summoned all those whom he knew to be best disposed to him, and\r\nmost likely to make matters smooth between them. He had two ships, and\r\nas many men as had been agreed upon, and when he was ready he went to\r\nEgilsey. As they were rowing in calm and smooth water a great wave rose\r\nunder the ship, which was steered by the Earl, and broke over it where\r\nhe sat. His men wondered very much at such an occurrence,—that a breaker\r\nshould rise in smooth water where no man could remember a breaker to\r\nhave arisen, and where the water was so deep. Then the Earl said: “No\r\nwonder that you are surprised at this. Indeed, I take this as a\r\nforeboding of my death. Perhaps it will come to pass as was prophesied\r\nabout Earl Hákon, and this may be to prepare us for Hákon, my kinsman,\r\nnot dealing honestly with me at this meeting.” The Earl’s men became\r\nvery sorrowful when he spoke of his death being near at hand, and begged\r\nhim to take care of his life, and not to trust himself to the good faith\r\nof Earl Hákon. Earl Magnus answered: “Let us go this time, and let all\r\nthat depends on our journey be in God’s will.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n                      EARL HAKON AND EARL MAGNUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW it is to be told of Earl Hákon that he gathered together a numerous\r\narmy, and had many ships equipped as if for battle. And when the troops\r\nwere assembled, he made known to his men that he intended that this\r\nmeeting should decide between him and Earl Magnus, so that both of them\r\nshould not rule over the Orkneys. Many of his men approved of this plan,\r\nadding many wicked suggestions to it, yet Sigurd and Sighvat Sokki\r\ncounselled the worst things.\r\n\r\nThen they began to row fast, and went along quickly. Hávard, Gunnar’s\r\nson, who was the friend and counsellor of the Earls, and equally\r\nfaithful to both, was on board the Earl’s ship. Hákon had concealed this\r\nwicked plan from him, in which he would by no means have had any part.\r\nAnd when he knew that the Earl was so resolute in this wicked purpose,\r\nhe jumped overboard, and swam to a certain uninhabited island.\r\n\r\nEarl Magnus arrived first with his men at Egilsey, and when they saw\r\nEarl Hákon coming they perceived that he had eight war-ships. Then Earl\r\nMagnus suspected that he intended to act treacherously towards him. So\r\nhe walked along the island with his men, and went into the church to\r\npray. His men offered to defend him. The Earl replied: “I will not put\r\nyour lives in danger for mine, and if peace cannot be established\r\nbetween us, let it be as God wills.” His men now recognised the truth of\r\nhis words, and as he foreknew the hours of his life—whether from his\r\nwisdom or from a divine revelation—he would neither fly nor avoid his\r\nenemies. He prayed devoutly, and had a mass sung for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n                       THE OFFERS OF EARL MAGNUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAKON and his men came up in the morning, and ran first to the church\r\nand ransacked it, but did not find the Earl. He had gone to another part\r\nof the island, to a certain hiding-place, accompanied by two men. But\r\nwhen the holy Earl Magnus saw that they searched for him, he called to\r\nthem, and thus made known to them where he was, and said they need\r\nsearch no farther. And when Hákon saw him, he and his men ran thither\r\nwith loud yelling and clangour of their weapons.\r\n\r\nEarl Magnus was praying when they came up to him, and when he had\r\nfinished his prayer he made the sign of the cross, and said firmly to\r\nEarl Hákon: “You did not act well, kinsman, when you broke your oaths,\r\nand it is highly probable that you were instigated to this more by the\r\nwickedness of others than your own. Now, I will make you three offers,\r\nthat you may rather accept one of them than break your oaths, and slay\r\nme who am innocent.”\r\n\r\nHákon’s men asked what these offers were.\r\n\r\n“The first is, that I shall go to Rome, or away to Jerusalem, and visit\r\nthe holy places, taking with me two ships from the Orkneys, with the\r\nnecessary equipment for the journey, and obtain benefits for the souls\r\nof us both. I shall swear never to return to the Orkneys.”\r\n\r\nThis offer was promptly rejected.\r\n\r\nThen said Earl Magnus: “Now, because my life is in your power, and I\r\nhave offended against Almighty God in many things, you shall send me to\r\nScotland, to our mutual friends, and keep me in custody there, with two\r\nmen for companionship. Make such provision that I shall not be able to\r\nescape from this custody.”\r\n\r\nThis too was promptly refused.\r\n\r\nMagnus then said: “There is yet one more offer which I will make, and\r\nGod knows that I think more of your soul than of my own life, for it\r\nwere better that you should do as I shall offer you than that you should\r\ntake my life. Let me be maimed as you like, or deprived of my eyes, and\r\nthrow me into a dark dungeon.”\r\n\r\nThen said Earl Hákon: “This offer I accept, and I ask for no more.”\r\n\r\nBut the chiefs started up and said to Earl Hákon: “One of you will we\r\nkill now, and from this day you shall not both rule the lands of the\r\nOrkneys.”\r\n\r\nEarl Hákon replied: “Slay him then, for I will rather have earldom and\r\nlands than instant death.”\r\n\r\nThus their conversation was related by Höldbodi, a truthful Bondi in the\r\nSudreyar, who was one of the two of Earl Magnus’s men who were with him\r\nwhen he was taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n                     THE BEHEADING OF EARL MAGNUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE worthy Earl Magnus was as cheerful as if he were invited to a\r\nbanquet, and spoke neither words of offence nor anger. After these words\r\nhad passed, he fell on his knees to pray, hiding his face in his hands,\r\nand shedding many tears before God. Then, when the holy Earl Magnus was\r\nthus doomed to death, Hákon ordered his banner-bearer, Ofeig, to slay\r\nthe Earl, but he refused, with the utmost wrath. Then forced he Lífólf,\r\nhis cook, to be the slayer of Magnus, but he began to weep aloud. “Weep\r\nnot thus,” said Earl Magnus, “for this is an honourable task. Be firm,\r\nand you shall have my clothing, according to the custom and laws of the\r\nmen of old. Be not afraid, for you do this against your will, and he who\r\nforces you sins more than you.”\r\n\r\nWhen he had said this, he took off his tunic and gave it to Lífólf. Then\r\nhe asked for permission to pray, which was granted to him. He fell upon\r\nthe earth, and gave himself to God, offering himself as a sacrifice. He\r\nprayed not only for his friends, but also for his enemies and murderers,\r\nand forgave them, with all his heart, their offences against himself. He\r\nconfessed his sins to God, and prayed that they might be washed from him\r\nin the shedding of his blood. He commended his spirit to God’s keeping,\r\nand prayed that His angels might come to meet his soul and carry it into\r\nthe rest of paradise. Some say that he took the sacrament when the mass\r\nwas sung. Then, when God’s friend was led to execution, he said to\r\nLífólf: “Stand before me, and hew me a mighty stroke on the head, for it\r\nis not fitting that high-born lords should be put to death like thieves.\r\nBe firm, poor man, for I have prayed to God for you, that he may have\r\nmercy upon you.” After that he signed the sign of the cross, and stooped\r\nunder the blow, and his spirit passed into heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n              THE SAINTSHIP OF EARL MAGNUS MADE MANIFEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE place where Earl Magnus was slain was previously covered with moss\r\nand stones, but shortly afterwards his merits before God became manifest\r\nin this wise, that it became green sward where he was beheaded. Thus God\r\nshowed that he had suffered for righteousness’ sake, and had obtained\r\nthe beauty and verdure of paradise, which is called the land of the\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nEarl Hákon did not permit his body to be brought to the church (for\r\nburial).\r\n\r\nThe day of Earl Magnus’s death was two days after Tiburtiusmas (14th\r\nApril). Then he had been seven winters Earl in the Orkneys along with\r\nEarl Hákon. Seventy-four winters had passed since the death of King\r\nOlaf. The Kings of Norway were at this time Sigurd, Eystein, and Olaf.\r\nIt was one thousand and ninety-one winters after the birth of\r\nChrist.[302]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\n                   THE EARL’S BODY BROUGHT TO CHURCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHORA, the mother of Earl Magnus, had invited both the Earls to a\r\nbanquet after their meeting, and Earl Hákon went there after the murder\r\nof the holy Earl Magnus. Thóra herself served at the banquet, and\r\nbrought the drink to the Earl and his men who had been present at the\r\nmurder of her son. And when the drink began to have effect on the Earl,\r\nthen went Thóra before him and said: “You came alone here, my lord, but\r\nI expected you both. Now, I hope you will gladden me in the sight of God\r\nand men. Be to me in stead of a son, and I shall be to you in stead of a\r\nmother. I stand greatly in need of your mercy now, and (I pray you to)\r\npermit me to bring my son to church. Hear this my supplication now, as\r\nyou wish God to look upon you at the day of doom.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl became silent, and considered her case, as she prayed so\r\nmeekly, and with tears, that her son might be brought to church. He\r\nlooked upon her, and the tears fell, and he said, “Bury your son where\r\nit pleases you.”\r\n\r\nThen the Earl’s body was brought to Hrossey, and buried at Christ’s Kirk\r\n(in Birsay), which had been built by Earl Thorfinn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXII\r\n\r\n               THE MIRACLE-WORKING OF MAGNUS THE MARTYR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOON after this a heavenly light was seen above his burial-place. Then\r\nmen who were placed in danger began to pray to him, and their prayers\r\nwere heard. A heavenly odour was frequently perceived above his\r\nburial-place, from which people suffering from illness received health.\r\nThen sufferers made pilgrimages thither both from the Orkneys and\r\nHjaltland, and kept vigils at his grave, and were cured of all their\r\nsufferings.[303] But people dared not make this known while Earl Hákon\r\nwas alive.\r\n\r\nIt is said of the men who were most guilty in the murder of the holy\r\nEarl Magnus that most of them met with a miserable death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\n       THE MIRACLES WROUGHT BY THE BLESSED FRIEND OF GOD, MAGNUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam was Bishop of the Orkneys at this time. He was the first bishop\r\nthere. The bishop’s seat was at Christ’s Kirk in Birgishérad (Birsay).\r\nWilliam was bishop for six winters of the seventh decade.[304] For a\r\nlong time he disbelieved in the sanctity of Earl Magnus, until his\r\nmerits became manifest to such a degree that God made his holiness grow\r\nthe more conspicuous the more it was tried, as is told in the book of\r\nhis miracles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\n                THE JOURNEY OF EARL HAKON TO THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER the murder of Earl Magnus, Hákon, Paul’s son, took possession of\r\nall the Orkneys, and exacted an oath of fealty from all men, and took\r\nsubmission from those who had served Earl Magnus. He became a great\r\nchief, and made heavy exactions from those of Earl Magnus’s friends who\r\nin his opinion had taken part against him.\r\n\r\nSome winters after this he prepared to leave the country, and went to\r\nRome. Then he also went to Jerusalem, according to the custom of the\r\npalmers, and brought away sacred relics, and bathed in the river Jordan.\r\nAfter that he returned to his dominions, and resumed the government of\r\nthe Orkneys. He became a good ruler, and established peace throughout\r\nhis dominions; he also made new laws for the Orkneys, which the\r\nlandowners liked better than the former ones. Then he became so popular\r\nthat the Orkneymen desired no other rulers than Hákon and his issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\n                             GENEALOGICAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Earl Hákon ruled over the Orkneys there lived a noble and wealthy\r\nman, by name Moddan, at Dal (Dale), in Caithness. His daughters were\r\nHelga and Frákork Thórleif. Helga, Moddan’s daughter, was the concubine\r\nof Earl Hákon, and their son was Harald, who was called Sléttmáli\r\n(smooth-talker), and their daughter was Ingibiorg, who was married to\r\nOlaf Bitling (little bit), the King of the Sudreyar. Their second\r\ndaughter was Margarét. Moddan’s daughter, Frákork, was married to a man\r\nwho was named Liót Níding (miscreant), in Sutherland, and their daughter\r\nwas Steinvör the Stout, who was married to Thorliót, at Rekavík.[305]\r\nTheir sons were Olvir Rosta (strife), Magnus Orm, and Moddan Eindridi,\r\nand their daughter Audhild. A second daughter of Frákork was Gudrún,\r\nmarried to Thorstein Höld, Fiaransmunn (open-mouth). Their son was\r\nThorbiörn Klerk (clerk).\r\n\r\nHákon, Paul’s son, had a son named Paul, who was called Umálgi\r\n(speechless); he was a reserved man, but popular. When the brothers grew\r\nup they never agreed. Hákon, Paul’s son, died on a sick-bed in the\r\nIslands, and his death was considered a great loss, for in the later\r\ndays of his reign there was unbroken peace, and the Islanders suspected\r\nthat the brothers would not agree well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\n                     THE SLAYING OF THORKEL FÓSTRI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER the death of Earl Hákon, his sons succeeded him; but they soon\r\ndisagreed, and divided the dominions between them. Then also dissensions\r\narose between the great men, and the vassals of each were divided into\r\nfactions. Earl Harald held Caithness from the King of the Scots, and he\r\nresided frequently there, but sometimes also in Scotland (Sutherland?),\r\nfor he had many friends and kinsmen there.\r\n\r\nWhen Earl Harald was staying in Sutherland there came to him a man\r\ncalled Sigurd Slembir,[306] who was said to be the son of the priest\r\nAdalbrekt. He came from Scotland, having been staying with King David,\r\nwho had held him in high esteem. Earl Harald received him extremely\r\nwell. Sigurd went into the Islands with Earl Harald and Frákork,\r\nModdan’s daughter, for her husband, Liót Níding, was dead. She and her\r\nsister took a large share in the government with Earl Harald. Sigurd\r\nSlembir was a great favourite with all of them. At that time Audhild,\r\nthe daughter of Thórleif, Moddan’s daughter, was his concubine.\r\nAfterwards she was married to Hákon Kló (claw). Before that time she had\r\nbeen married to Eirík Stræta; their son was Eirík Slagbrellir.\r\n\r\nWhen Sigurd and Frákork came to the Islands great dissensions arose, and\r\nboth of the Earls called together as many of their friends as they could\r\nget. The most attached to Earl Paul was Sigurd, at Westness,[307] who\r\nhad married Ingibiorg the Noble, a kinswoman of the Earls’, and Thorkel,\r\nSumarlidi’s son, who was always with Earl Paul, and was called his\r\nfoster-father. He was a kinsman of the holy Earl Magnus, and a most\r\npopular man. The friends of the Earl thought that no man would less\r\ndeplore their dissensions than Thorkel, because of the injury done him\r\nby their father Hákon. At last Earl Harald and Sigurd Slembir went to\r\nThorkel Fóstri,[308] and slew him. When Earl Paul heard this, he was\r\nvery much displeased, and gathered men together; but when their mutual\r\nfriends became aware of this, they went between them and tried to\r\nreconcile them; and all took part in making peace. Earl Paul was so\r\nwroth that he would not make peace, unless all those who were concerned\r\nin the manslaying were banished. But as the islanders thought their\r\ndissensions a great calamity, they all tried to pacify them; and the\r\nresult was that Sigurd and all those who, in Earl Paul’s opinion, were\r\nmost concerned in this crime, were banished from the Orkneys. Earl\r\nHarald paid the manbote (compensation) for the slaughter of Thorkel. The\r\nterms of this peace were that their friendship should be confirmed, and\r\nthat they should spend Christmas and all the chief festivals together.\r\n\r\nSigurd Slembir left the Orkneys, and went to Scotland, and stayed for a\r\nwhile with Malcolm, King of Scots, and was well entertained. He was\r\nthought a great man in all manly exercises. He remained for a time in\r\nScotland, until he went to Jerusalem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\n                     EARL HARALD SLAIN BY SORCERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nONCE the brothers were to be entertained at Orfjara (Orphir), one of\r\nEarl Harald’s estates, and he was to bear the expense of the\r\nentertainment for both of them that Christmas. He was very busy, and\r\nmade great preparations. The sisters Frákork and Helga were there with\r\nthe Earl, and sat sewing in a little room.[309] Earl Harald went into\r\nthe room where the sisters were sitting on a cross-bench, and saw a\r\nlinen garment, newly made, and white as snow, lying between them. The\r\nEarl took it up, and saw that it was embroidered with gold. He asked,\r\n“To whom does this splendid thing belong?”\r\n\r\nFrákork replied, “It is intended for your brother Paul.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you make such a fine garment for him? You do not take such pains\r\nin making my clothing.”\r\n\r\nHe had just come out of bed, and was dressed in a shirt and linen\r\ndrawers, and had thrown a mantle over his shoulders. He threw off the\r\nmantle, and spread out the dress. His mother took hold of it, and asked\r\nhim not to envy his brother of his fine clothing. The Earl pulled it\r\nfrom her, and prepared to put it on. Then Frákork snatched off her\r\nhead-gear, and tore her hair, and said that his life was at stake if he\r\nput it on, and both of the women wept grievously. The Earl put on the\r\ngarment nevertheless; but as soon as it touched his sides a shiver went\r\nthrough his body, which was soon followed by great pain, so that he had\r\nto take to his bed; and he was not long in bed until he died. His\r\nfriends considered his death a great loss.\r\n\r\nImmediately after his death his brother Paul took possession of his\r\ndominions, with the consent of the Bœndr. Earl Paul considered that the\r\nsplendid underclothing which Earl Harald had put on had been intended\r\nfor him, and therefore he did not like the sisters to stay in the\r\nOrkneys. So they left the Islands with all their attendants, and went\r\nfirst to Caithness, and then to Scotland to the estate which Frákork had\r\nthere. Her son Erlend was brought up there while he was young. Olvir\r\nRosta, the son of Thorliót, from Rekavík (Rackwick), and Steinný\r\n(Steinvor?), Frákork’s daughter, were also brought up there. Olvir was a\r\nman of great strength, a violent man and a great fighter. Thorbiörn\r\nKlerk, the son of Thorstein Höld, was brought up there, and also\r\nMargarét, the daughter of Earl Hákon and Helga, Moddan’s daughter, and\r\nEirík Slagbrellir. All these were men of great families, and\r\naccomplished, and thought they had claims to the Orkneys. The brothers\r\nof Frákork were Magnus Orfi (the liberal) and Earl Ottar, in Thórsey\r\n(Thurso), who was a noble man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\n                             OF EARL PAUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARL PAUL then ruled the Orkneys, and was very popular. He was somewhat\r\ntaciturn, spoke little at the Things, and gave others a large share in\r\nthe government with himself. He was a modest man, and gentle to the\r\npeople, liberal with his money, and spared nothing with his friends. He\r\nwas not warlike, and kept himself very quiet. At that time there were\r\nmany noble men descended from Earls in the Orkneys. Then there lived at\r\nWestness, in Hrólfsey (Rousay), a noble man, by name Sigurd, who had\r\nmarried Ingibiorg the Noble. Her mother Herborg was the daughter of Earl\r\nPaul, Thorfinn’s son. Their sons were Brynjúlf and Hákon Pík (peak). All\r\nthese were Earl Paul’s vassals; so were also the sons of Hávard, Gunni’s\r\nson—Hákon Kló, Thorstein, and Dûfniáll. Their mother was Bergliót, and\r\nher mother was Ragnhild, the daughter of Earl Paul. There was a man\r\nnamed Erling, who lived in Caithness. He had four sons, all of them\r\naccomplished men. A man named Olaf lived in Gáreksey (Gairsay), and had\r\nanother estate at Dungalsbæ, in Caithness. Olaf was a great man, and\r\nhighly honoured by Earl Paul. His wife was named Asleif, a wise woman,\r\naccomplished, and of a great family. Their sons—Valthióf, Swein, and\r\nGunni—were all accomplished men. Their sister was named Ingigerd.\r\nSigurd, the Earl’s brother-in-law, had married Thóra, the mother of Earl\r\nMagnus, and their son was Hákon Karl (man). Both Sigurd and his son were\r\ngreat chiefs. In Rínarsey (North Ronaldsay) there lived a woman, by name\r\nRagna, and her son was named Thorstein, a man of great strength. A\r\nfarmer named Kugi, a wise and wealthy man, lived at Gefsisness,[310] in\r\nWestrey. A farmer named Helgi lived at a hamlet in Westrey. Thorkel\r\nFlétta (a braid), a violent and powerful man, lived in Westrey.\r\nThorstein and Haflidi were unpopular men. At Swiney (Swona), in the\r\nPentland Firth, lived a poor man, and his sons were Asbiörn and Margad,\r\nsturdy fellows. In Fridarey (Fair Isle) lived a man by name Dagfinn. A\r\nman named Thorstein lived at Fluguness,[311] in Hrossey (the Mainland of\r\nOrkney), and his sons were Thorstein Krôkauga (crooked eye) and Blán,\r\nboth of them wild fellows. Játvör, the daughter of Earl Erlend, and her\r\nson Borgar, lived at Knarrarstadir;[312] they were rather unpopular. Jón\r\nVœng (wing) lived at Uppland, in Háey (Hoy). Rikgard lived at\r\nBrekkur,[313] in Straumsey. They were poor men, and relatives of Olaf\r\nHrólfsson. A man named Grímkell lived at Glettuness.[314] All these men\r\nwill be mentioned in the saga afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLIX\r\n\r\n                OF KALI, WHO AFTERWARDS BECAME AN EARL.\r\n\r\n\r\nKOL, who was a very wise man, resided on his estates at Agdir (in\r\nNorway), and did not go to the Orkneys. His son Kali grew up there, and\r\nwas a most promising man. He was of middle size, well proportioned, and\r\nvery handsomely shaped; his hair was of a light auburn colour. He was\r\nvery affable and popular, and highly accomplished. He made the following\r\nverses:—\r\n\r\n                   At the game-board I am skilful;\r\n                   Knowing in no less than nine arts;\r\n                   Runic lore I well remember;\r\n                   Books I like; with tools I’m handy;\r\n                   Expert am I on the snow-shoes,\r\n                   With the bow, and pull an oar well;\r\n                   And, besides, I am an adept\r\n                   At the harp, and making verses.\r\n\r\nKali was frequently with his kinsman Sölmund, the son of Sigurd Sneis.\r\nHe was treasurer at Túnsberg, and had estates at Austragdir. He was a\r\ngreat chief, and had a numerous retinue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER L\r\n\r\n                        OF KALI AND GILLICHRIST.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Kali was fifteen winters old, he went with some merchants to\r\nEngland, taking with him a good (cargo of) merchandise. They went to a\r\ntrading place called Grímsbœ (Grimsby). There was a great number of\r\npeople from Norway, as well as from the Orkneys, Scotland, and the\r\nSudreyar. Kali met there a man who was called Gillichrist. The latter\r\nasked Kali about many things in Norway, and spoke chiefly with him, so\r\nthat they became companions. Then he told Kali in confidence that his\r\nname was Harald,[315] that Magnus Barelegs was his father, and his\r\nmother was in the Sudreyar. He further asked him how he would be\r\nreceived in Norway if he came there. Kali said that he thought King\r\nSigurd would be likely to receive him well, if others did not set him\r\nagainst him. Gillichrist and Kali exchanged presents, and at parting\r\nthey promised each other mutual friendship wherever they might meet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER LI\r\n\r\n                            OF KALI AND JON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER that Kali went from the west in the same ship. They touched at\r\nAgdir, and from there they went to Biörgvin (Bergen). Then he made a\r\nstanza:—\r\n\r\n                   Unpleasantly we have been wading\r\n                   In the mud a weary five weeks.\r\n                   Dirt we had indeed in plenty,\r\n                   While we lay in Grimsby harbour;\r\n                   But now on the moor of sea-gulls\r\n                   Ride we o’er the crests of billows,\r\n                   Gaily as the elk of bowsprits\r\n                   Eastward ploughs its way to Bergen.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the town, there was a great number of people from the\r\nnorth and the south (of Norway), and from foreign lands, who had brought\r\nmuch merchandise. The crew of the ship went to some public places to\r\namuse themselves. Kali was a great dandy, and made a great display, as\r\nhe was newly arrived from England. He thought a great deal of himself,\r\nand many others thought a great deal of him too, because he was of a\r\ngood family, and highly accomplished. In the inn where he sat drinking\r\nthere was a man named Jón Pétrsson, the son of Serk, from Sogn. He was\r\nthe king’s vassal at the time. His mother was Helga, the daughter of\r\nHárek, from Setr. Jón was a great dandy too. The dame who kept the inn\r\nwhere they were drinking was Unn by name, a woman of good repute. Jón\r\nand Kali soon became companions, and parted great friends. Whereupon Jón\r\nwent home to his estates, and Kali went to his father, Kol, at Agdir.\r\nKali stayed frequently with his kinsman Sölmund. Thus some years passed,\r\nin which Kali made trading trips during the summer, and spent the\r\nwinters at home or with Sölmund.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LII\r\n\r\n                       KALI GOES INTO DOLLS CAVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE summer Kali went to Thrándheim; he was detained by weather in an\r\nisland called Dolls, and there was a cave called Dollshellir. It was\r\nsaid that money was hidden there. The merchants went into the cave, and\r\nfound it very difficult to penetrate into it. They came to a sheet of\r\nwater stretching across the cave, and no one dared to cross it except\r\nKali, and one of Sölmund’s domestics called Hávard. They swam across the\r\nlake, having a rope between them. Kali also carried firewood and\r\nfire-making gear between his shoulders. They came to the opposite shore,\r\nwhich was rugged and stony; the smell also was there very bad, so that\r\nthey could hardly make a light. Kali said they should not go any\r\nfarther, and piled up stones as a monument. Then Kali sang a song:\r\n\r\n                 Here I raise a mighty stone-pile,\r\n                 In remembrance of our daring,\r\n                 In this Dolls cave, dark and gloomy,\r\n                 Where we sought the goblins’ treasure.\r\n                 Yet I know not how the captain\r\n                 Of the ocean’s gliding snow-skates\r\n                 May re-cross the dismal water:\r\n                 Long and dreary is the journey.\r\n\r\nThen they returned, and came safe to their men, and it is not mentioned\r\nthat anything else happened during their journey. When they came to\r\nBiörgvin, Kali went to the same inn, to Dame Unn. Jón Pétrsson was\r\nthere, and one of his domestics, by name Brynjúlf. Many other men were\r\nalso there, although their names are not mentioned here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LIII\r\n\r\n                        OF HAVARD AND BRYNJULF.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE evening, when Jón and Kali had gone to bed, many remained drinking,\r\nand talked a great deal. The guests were getting drunk, and at last they\r\nbegan comparing men,[316] and disputing about who were the greatest of\r\nthe landed men of Norway. Brynjúlf said that Jón Pétrsson was the best\r\nman, and of the noblest family of all the young men south of Stád.\r\nHávard, the companion of Kali, spoke of Sölmund, and said that he was in\r\nnothing inferior to Jón, adding that the men of Vík would esteem him\r\nmore than Jón. Out of this a great quarrel arose, and as the ale spoke\r\nin them, they kept so little within bounds that Hávard jumped up, took a\r\npiece of wood, and struck Brynjúlf a blow on the head, so that he\r\nfainted. Those present took hold of Brynjúlf, and sent Hávard away to\r\nKali, who again sent him to a priest called Rikgard, in Alvidra. “And\r\ntell him from me,” said Kali, “to keep you till I come to the east.”\r\nKali sent a man with him, and they rowed to the south till they came to\r\nGrœningiasund. Then Hávard said to his fellow-traveller: “Now, as we are\r\nout of their reach, let us rest ourselves, and lie down to sleep.”\r\n\r\nWhen Brynjúlf recovered, he was conducted to Jón, and he told him all\r\nthat had happened, and also that the man had been sent away. Jón guessed\r\nthe truth about Hávard’s destination, and ordered ten men, led by\r\nBrynjúlf, to take a rowing boat, in which they rowed till they came to\r\nGrœningiasund, and by that time it was daylight. They saw a boat on the\r\nbeach. Brynjúlf said: “Perhaps these men may be able to tell us\r\nsomething of Hávard.” Then they went up and found them when they had\r\njust woke up. Brynjúlf and his men attacked them immediately with arms,\r\nand Hávard and his companion were both slain. After this they returned\r\nto the town and told the news to Jón, and then it was known to the whole\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nKali considered these slaughters a great offence against himself; and\r\nwhen mediators went between him and Jón, the latter said that he would\r\nleave to him to say what amends he wished for the offence, without\r\nprejudice to the right of the King and the parties to the suit. Kali\r\nagreed to this, yet they were no friends from this time. Kali went home\r\nafter this occurrence, and when he saw his father he told him the news\r\nand the result.\r\n\r\nThen Kol said: “I think your judgment was rather strange, in that you\r\nshould have agreed to any terms of reconciliation before Sölmund knew. I\r\nthink your position is difficult, and that you can do little else than\r\ntry to be reconciled. But Sölmund would not have acted like you if your\r\nman had been killed.”\r\n\r\nKali replied: “I suppose it is true, father, that I have judged rather\r\nhastily in this matter, and you were too far away to advise me. It will\r\noften appear that I am not so deeply wise as you. But I thought that\r\nSölmund had not a better chance of gaining honourable amends, though I\r\nrefused what was offered to me. And I consider it no dishonour for you\r\nand Sölmund if he offers to allow you to determine your compensation,\r\nthough I doubt whether such an offer will be made. But I consider myself\r\nunder no obligation to Brynjúlf, while I have made no award and no money\r\nhas been received.”\r\n\r\nFather and son had a long talk about this, and did not agree; then they\r\nsent men to tell Sölmund the news.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LIV\r\n\r\n                          OF JON AND SOLMUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER that, Kol and Kali had an interview with Sölmund. Kol wished to\r\nsend men to Jón to try to make peace between them; but Sölmund and\r\nHallvard, Hávard’s brother, refused everything but blood-revenge, and\r\nsaid it was not becoming to ask for settlement. Yet Kol’s advice was\r\ntaken, because he promised not to withdraw from the case until Sölmund\r\nhad received honourable amends; and Kol was to lay all the plans. When\r\nthe messengers returned, they said they had received a most unfavourable\r\nreply to their demands, and that Jón refused positively to make\r\ncompensation for a man who by his own act had forfeited his personal\r\nsecurity. Sölmund said that this had turned out just as he\r\nexpected—namely, that little honour would be gained by asking Jón for\r\nsettlement; and then he begged Kol to propose a plan that might be of\r\nsome avail.\r\n\r\nKol replied: “Is Hallvard willing to run any risk in order to avenge his\r\nbrother, even though it may come to little?”\r\n\r\nHallvard said he would not spare himself in order to take revenge, even\r\nif there were danger connected with it.\r\n\r\n“Then,” said Kol, “you shall go secretly to Sogn, to a man called Uni,\r\nwho lives not far from Jón. He is a wise man, but rather poor, for he\r\nhas been a long time oppressed by Jón; he is a great friend of mine, and\r\nconsiderably advanced in years. You shall take to him from me six marks\r\n(of silver) weighed, in order that he may give you advice how to take\r\nrevenge on Brynjúlf, or some other of Jón’s men, whom he considers not\r\nless a loss to him. And if this can be brought about, Uni shall send you\r\nto my kinsman Kyrpinga Orm, at Studla, and his sons Ogmund and Erling,\r\nand there I consider you will be as if you were at home. Tell Uni to\r\nsell his farm and come to me.”\r\n\r\nHallvard prepared to go, and we are not told of his journey or night\r\nquarters, until he came to Uni one evening. He did not tell his true\r\nname. They inquired of each other for current news; and in the evening,\r\nwhen they were sitting round the fire, the guest asked a great deal\r\nabout noble men in Sogn and Hördaland. Uni said that none of the landed\r\nmen were considered more powerful than Jón, on account of his family and\r\nhis violence; and he further asked whether they had no experience of it\r\nin the south. When he had said this, the guest became silent. Then the\r\npeople arose from the fire, and the two remained.\r\n\r\nThen Uni said: “Did not you say just now that your name was Hallvard?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said the guest; “I called myself Saxi this evening.”\r\n\r\nUni said: “Then I am out of all difficulties; but if my name were\r\nBrynjúlf, I should think yours was Hallvard; and now let us go to\r\nsleep.”\r\n\r\nThe guest took hold of him and said: “Let us not go yet.” Whereupon he\r\ndelivered the purse, and said: “Kol sends you his greeting and this\r\nsilver, in order that you may be willing to advise me how to avenge my\r\nbrother Havard on Brynjúlf.” Then he told him Kol’s plans.\r\n\r\nUni said: “Kol deserves well of me, but I cannot know what may be done\r\nabout the revenge on Brynjúlf; but he is expected here to-morrow to\r\nfetch his concubine’s clothes.”\r\n\r\nThereafter he went with Hallvard to a stable which stood opposite the\r\ndoor of the house, and concealed him in the manger. This was before the\r\npeople got up, but he had slept in the house during the night. When\r\nHallvard had been a little while in the stable, he saw a brisk man\r\ncoming to the house. He called into the house, and told the woman to\r\nmake herself ready. She took her clothes and brought them out. Then\r\nHallvard thought he knew who the man was, and walked out. Brynjúlf had\r\nput down his weapons while he was tying the clothes; and when Hallvard\r\nmet him he dealt him a deadly blow, and returned to the stable and hid\r\nhimself. While the slaughter was being committed the woman had gone into\r\nthe house to take leave of the inmates, but when she came out she saw\r\nwhat had occurred, and ran in crying and frightened to such a degree\r\nthat she was nearly fainting, and told the news. Farmer Uni ran out, and\r\nsaid that the man had probably been an assassin. He despatched a man to\r\ntell Jón the news, and urged his men with great eagerness to search for\r\nthe murderer; therefore no one suspected him. Hallvard remained in the\r\nstable until the search had slackened. Then he went, with Uni’s advice,\r\nto Orm and his sons at Studla, and they sent men with him to the east.\r\nKol and Sölmund received him well, and were then well satisfied with\r\ntheir case. After a while the truth came out, and Jón was very much\r\ngrieved. Thus that year passed.\r\n\r\nNext winter, towards Yuletide, Jón left his home with thirty men, saying\r\nthat he was going to pay his uncle Olaf a visit. This he did, and was\r\nvery well received. Jón told his uncle that he was going to Agdir to see\r\nSölmund. Olaf dissuaded him from it, and said that he had held his own\r\nthough they parted as matters stood then. But Jón said he was not\r\nsatisfied to let Brynjúlf remain unavenged. Olaf said he thought he\r\nwould gain very little by trying; yet he had from there thirty men, and\r\nthus he went with half a hundred men across the hills, intending to take\r\nSölmund and Kol by surprise. When Jón had just gone from the north, Uni\r\nwent in haste to Orm and his sons at Studla, and they sent men with him\r\nto Kol. He arrived there at Yule, and told them that Jón was going to\r\nattack them. Kol despatched scouts immediately to all parts where Jón\r\nwas expected; and he himself went to see Sölmund, and they and their\r\nkinsmen waited with a great number of men about them. They had news of\r\nJón’s movements, and started immediately to meet him. They met at a\r\ncertain wood, and the fight began immediately. Kol’s men were much more\r\nnumerous, and came off victorious. Jón lost many men, and fled into the\r\nwood. He was wounded in the leg, and this wound healed so badly that he\r\nwas lame ever after, and was called Jón Fót (leg). He came to the north\r\nduring Lent, and his expedition was considered rather ignominious. The\r\nwinter thus passed, but the next summer Jón caused two of Kol’s kinsmen\r\nto be killed, Gunnar and Aslák.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER LV\r\n\r\n                  THE RECONCILIATION OF THE ORKNEYMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHORTLY afterwards King Sigurd came to the town, and these difficulties\r\nwere laid before him. Then the King summoned both to appear before him,\r\nand they came accompanied by their kinsmen and friends. An attempt was\r\nmade to reconcile them, and the result was, that the King should judge\r\nall their differences, which both parties confirmed by shaking of hands.\r\nKing Sigurd, assisted by the advice of the wisest men, then made peace\r\nbetween them. One part of the agreement was, that Jón Pétrsson should\r\nmarry Ingirid, Kol’s daughter, and their friendship should be confirmed\r\nby the connection. The killed were set off against each other. The\r\nattack on Kol, and Jón’s wound, were set off against the loss of men in\r\nthe east. Further wounds were matched, and the difference made up. Each\r\nshould assist the other, both at home and abroad. As a result of this\r\nreconciliation, King Sigurd gave Kali, Kol’s son, the half of the\r\nOrkneys, jointly with Paul, Hákon’s son, and made him an Earl at the\r\nsame time. He also gave him the name of Earl Rögnvald, Brúsi’s son,\r\nbecause his mother, Gunnhild, said that Rögnvald was the most\r\naccomplished of all the Orkney Earls, and thought the name would bring\r\ngood fortune. This part of the Orkneys had belonged to Earl Magnus,\r\nKali’s mother’s brother. After this reconciliation, they who were\r\nenemies before parted good friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LVI\r\n\r\n                          KING SIGURD’S DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS winter King Sigurd resided in Osló.[317] During Lent he was taken\r\nill, and died one night after Lady-day. His son Magnus was in the town,\r\nand held a Thing, and was accepted king throughout the land, agreeably\r\nto the oaths which the inhabitants had sworn to King Sigurd. He also\r\ntook possession of all the royal treasures.\r\n\r\nHarald Gilli was at Túnsberg when he heard of the death of King Sigurd.\r\nHe had meetings with his friends, and sent for Rögnvald and his father,\r\nbecause they had always been friends since they met in England. Rögnvald\r\nand his father had also done most to help Harald to prove his paternity\r\nto Sigurd. In this they were assisted by many barons; among others\r\nIngimar, Swein’s son, and Thióstólf, Ali’s son. Harald and his party\r\nresolved to hold the Hauga-Thing[318] at Túnsberg, and there Harald was\r\naccepted king of one-half of the land. The oaths with which he had given\r\nup his patrimony in order to be permitted to prove his paternity by an\r\nordeal[319] were said to have been given under compulsion. Then people\r\nflocked to him, and gave in their allegiance, and soon he had many men\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\nMessages went between him and King Magnus, but it was not until four\r\nwinters had passed that they were reconciled, on the terms that each of\r\nthem should have one-half of the kingdom; but King Magnus had the long\r\nships, and the table-service, and all the treasures (of his father), yet\r\nhe was dissatisfied with his portion, and showed enmity to all the\r\nfriends of King Harald. King Magnus would not hold valid King Sigurd’s\r\ngift of the Orkneys and the earldom to Rögnvald, because he was the\r\nfirmest partisan of King Harald, until all their dealings were\r\nconcluded. Magnus and Harald were three winters Kings of Norway, and\r\nnominally at peace, but the fourth summer they fought at Fyrileif,[320]\r\nwhere King Magnus had nearly 6000, but Harald only 1500 men. These\r\nchiefs were with King Harald: his brother Kriströd, Earl Rögnvald,\r\nIngimar from Ask, Thióstólf Ali’s son, and Sölmund. King Magnus gained\r\nthe victory, and Harald fled. Kriströd and Ingimar were killed. Ingimar\r\nmade the following stanza:—\r\n\r\n                   Fiends me drove to Fyrileif;[321]\r\n                   Not with my will did I fight there.\r\n                   Bit by arrows from the elmbow,\r\n                   Ne’er to Ask shall I return.\r\n\r\nKing Harald fled to his ships in Vík,[322] and went to Denmark to King\r\nEirik Eymuni,[323] who gave him Halland for his maintenance, and eight\r\nlong ships without rigging. Thióstólf, Ali’s son, sold his lands, bought\r\nships and arms, and went in autumn to King Harald, in Denmark. At\r\nYuletide King Harald came to Biörgvin, and lay in Flóruvagár till after\r\nYule. Then they attacked the town, and met with little resistance. King\r\nMagnus was seized on board his own ship, and maimed. King Harald then\r\ntook possession of the whole kingdom, and the next spring he renewed the\r\ngift of the Islands and the title of Earl to Rögnvald.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LVII\r\n\r\n                             KOL’S SCHEMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nKOL resolved to send men to the Orkneys to ask Earl Paul to give up half\r\nthe Islands which King Harald had given to Rögnvald, and they should be\r\nfriends and good kinsmen. But if Earl Paul refused, the same men should\r\ngo to Frákork and Olvir Rosta, and offer them one-half of the land,\r\njointly with Earl Rögnvald, if they were willing to take it from Earl\r\nPaul by force of arms. When they came to Earl Paul in the Orkneys, and\r\ndelivered the message, he replied: “I understand this claim; it has been\r\nplanned advisedly, and with long forethought; they sought the help of\r\nthe Kings of Norway to obtain my possessions. Now, I will not repay this\r\nperfidy by giving away my possessions to a man who is not nearer to me\r\nthan Rögnvald is, and refusing them to my brother’s son or sister’s son.\r\nThere is no need to talk any more of this, for with the assistance of my\r\nfriends and kinsmen I shall defend the Orkneys as long as God grants me\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\nThen the messengers saw what would be the result of their message to\r\nEarl Paul, and went away across the Pentland Firth to Caithness, and\r\nsouth into the country to Frákork, and delivered their message, to the\r\neffect that Kol and Rögnvald offered her and Olvir half the Islands if\r\nthey were willing to conquer them from Earl Paul.\r\n\r\nFrákork replied: “It is true that Kol is a very clever man, and it was\r\nwisely planned to seek assistance here, as we have a great many\r\nrelatives and connections. I have now married Margaret, Hákon’s\r\ndaughter, to Moddan, Earl of Atjöklar (Athole), who is of the noblest\r\nfamily of all the Scottish chiefs. His father, Malcolm, is the brother\r\n(uncle?) of King Malcolm, the father of David, who is now King of Scots.\r\nWe have many and just claims on the Orkneys. We ourselves have also some\r\npower. We are said also to be rather far-seeing, and during hostilities\r\nall things do not come on us unawares; yet we will be glad to enter into\r\nalliance with Kol and his son for many reasons. Tell them from me that I\r\nand Olvir shall bring an army to the Orkneys against Earl Paul about the\r\nmiddle of the next summer. Let Earl Rögnvald meet us then, and come to a\r\ndecisive battle with Earl Paul; and I will collect forces together\r\nduring the winter from my kinsmen, friends, and connections in Scotland\r\nand the Sudreyar (Hebrides).”\r\n\r\nThe messengers returned to Norway, and related how matters stood. Next\r\nwinter Earl Rögnvald prepared to go west, and the chiefs Sölmund and Jón\r\nwith him. They went the next summer, and had a fine body of troops,\r\nthough not numerous, and five or six ships. They arrived at Hjaltland\r\n(Shetland) about the middle of the summer, but heard nothing of Frákork.\r\nStrong and contrary winds sprung up, and they brought their ships to\r\nAlasund,[324] and went a-feasting over the country, for the Bœndr\r\nreceived them well.\r\n\r\nBut of Frákork it is to be told that in the spring she went to the\r\nSudreyar, where she and Olvir gathered troops and ships together. They\r\ngot twelve ships, all of them small and somewhat badly manned; and about\r\nthe middle of the summer they directed their course to the Orkneys,\r\nintending to meet Earl Rögnvald, according to their agreement. The wind\r\nwas rather unfavourable. Olvir Rosta was the commander of these troops,\r\nand he was to obtain an earldom in the Orkneys if they gained the\r\nvictory. Frákork was there also with many of her retainers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LVIII\r\n\r\n              THE FIGHT BETWEEN EARL PAUL AND OLVIR ROSTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARL PAUL was then at a feast with Sigurd at Westness, in Hrólfsey\r\n(Rousay), and when he heard that Earl Rögnvald had arrived in Hjaltland,\r\nand at the same time that an army which was going to attack him was\r\ngathering in the Sudreyar, he sent word to Kugi, in Westrey, and Thorkel\r\nFlettir, who were wise men, and many others of his chief men he called\r\ntogether. At this meeting Earl Paul sought advice from his friends, but\r\nthey differed in their opinions. Some wished him to share his\r\npossessions with one of the two parties, so as not to have both as\r\nenemies. Others advised him to go over to his friends in Ness\r\n(Caithness), and see what assistance he could get there.\r\n\r\nEarl Paul replied, “I will not offer them my possessions now, since I\r\nrefused peremptorily when they asked civilly. Besides, I think it would\r\nbe unworthy of a chief to flee from my lands without a trial of\r\nstrength. My counsel is to send men to-night to collect troops\r\nthroughout all the Islands. Let us then go to meet Earl Rögnvald, and\r\nhave matters decided between us before the Sudreymen come.” Earl Paul’s\r\nplan was adopted.\r\n\r\nWith Earl Paul there was a man by name Swein, called Brióstreip\r\n(breast-rope), who was his henchman, and highly esteemed by him. In the\r\nsummer he was always on viking-raids, but in the winter [he stayed] with\r\nthe Earl. Swein was a man of large stature and great strength, swarthy\r\nand ill-favoured. He was greatly skilled in ancient lore, and had\r\nfrequently been engaged in outsittings.[325] His place was in the\r\nforecastle of the Earl’s ship.\r\n\r\nDuring the night the following chiefs came to Earl Paul:—Eyvind,\r\nMelbrigdi’s son, in a ship fully manned; Olaf, Rólf’s son, from Gáreksey\r\n(Gairsay), had another; Thorkel Flettir the third; Sigurd the fourth;\r\nand the Earl himself the fifth. With these five vessels they went to\r\nHrólfsey (Rousay), and arrived there in the evening about sunset. Troops\r\ngathered to him during the night, but more ships were not to be had. The\r\nnext day they were going to sail to Hjaltland to meet Earl Rögnvald; but\r\nin the morning, shortly after sunrise, some men came to Earl Paul, who\r\nsaid they had seen longships coming from the Pentland Firth; whether ten\r\nor twelve they did not know. The Earl and his men were convinced that\r\nthis was Frákork’s party, and the Earl ordered his men to row against\r\nthem as fast as possible. Olaf and Sigurd advised them to go leisurely,\r\nsaying that their troops might arrive at any moment.\r\n\r\nWhen they were east of Tannskáruness (Tankerness), the longships, twelve\r\ntogether, sailed to the west from Múli.[326] The Earl and his men\r\nfastened their ships together; then the Bondi, Erling from\r\nTannskáruness, and his sons, came to the Earl and offered him their\r\nassistance; and then their ships were so crowded that they thought they\r\ncould not use more men. The Earl asked Erling and his men to bring\r\nstones to them, until they were prevented by the fighting. When they had\r\nprepared themselves, Olvir came up and made the attack with a superior\r\nforce, but his ships were smaller. Olvir (himself) had a large ship,\r\nwhich he placed beside the Earl’s ship, and there was the severest\r\nfighting. Olaf, Rólf’s son, attacked the smallest ships of Olvir, and\r\ncleared three of them in a short time. Olvir attacked the Earl’s ships\r\nso fiercely that all the forecastle men were driven abaft the mast. Then\r\nOlvir urged his men strongly to board, and jumped himself from the\r\nquarterdeck to the forepart of the ship, and was the first to board.\r\n\r\nSwein Brióstreip was the foremost of all the Earl’s men, and fought\r\nbravely. When the Earl saw that Olvir had boarded his ship, he urged his\r\nmen forward, and jumped himself from the quarterdeck to the forepart of\r\nthe ship. When Olvir perceived this, he grasped a spear, and hurled it\r\nat the Earl, who received it with his shield, but fell down on the deck.\r\nThen there was a great shout; but in the same moment Swein Brióstreip\r\nseized a huge stone,[327] and threw it at Olvir. It hit him in the chest\r\nwith such force that he was thrown overboard, and sank; but his men were\r\nable to drag him up into one of their ships, and it was not known\r\nwhether he was dead or alive. Then some cut the cables, and wanted to\r\nflee. All Olvir’s men were also driven down off the Earl’s ship, and\r\nbegan to withdraw. At that moment Olvir recovered, and asked them not to\r\nflee; but all pretended not to hear what he said. The Earl pursued the\r\nfugitives along the east of Hrossey and Rögnvaldsey, and into the\r\nPentland Firth, where they parted. Then he returned, and five of Olvir’s\r\nships remained where they had fought. The Earl took them, and manned\r\nthem with his troops. The battle took place on Friday, but in the night\r\nthe Earl had the ships made ready, and many troops and two longships\r\ncame to him, so that in the morning he had twelve ships all well manned.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday he sailed to Hjaltland, and took by surprise those that had\r\ncharge of Earl Rögnvald’s ships. He killed the men, and seized the ships\r\nwith all their contents. In the morning Earl Rögnvald had news of this,\r\nand his men gathered together, and a great many of the Bœndr. Then they\r\nwent down to the beach, and challenged Earl Paul and his men to come on\r\nshore and fight. Earl Paul did not put much faith in the Hjaltlanders,\r\nand would not go on shore; but he told them to take ships, and then they\r\nmight fight. Earl Rögnvald saw, however, that they could get no ships in\r\nHjaltland, such as would give them any chance, and they parted thus as\r\nmatters stood. Earl Paul and his men went back to the Orkneys, but Earl\r\nRögnvald and his men remained in Hjaltland during the summer. In the\r\nautumn they went back to Norway with some merchants, and it was thought\r\ntheir expedition had come to a most ridiculous end.\r\n\r\nWhen Earl Rögnvald came to the east, he saw his father Kol, who asked\r\nhim whether he was dissatisfied with his expedition. He replied that the\r\nresult had brought little honour to himself.\r\n\r\nKol replied: “I do not think so; I think a great deal has been done,\r\nsince the Hjaltlanders are your friends, and the journey was better than\r\nstaying at home.”\r\n\r\nRögnvald replied: “If you praise this journey, then you are either more\r\nindifferent about my case than I thought, or you see something in it\r\nwhich I do not perceive. I should wish very much to have your counsels,\r\nand that you would go with us yourself.”\r\n\r\nKol replied: “I shall not do both—call everything easy for you, and come\r\nnowhere near myself; but I think I shall hold fast to my own plans, so\r\nthat there is no prejudice to your honour.”\r\n\r\nRögnvald replied: “I will gladly follow your counsels.”\r\n\r\nKol replied: “First, I advise you to send word to King Harald and other\r\nfriends of yours, and ask them to give you men and ships to go to the\r\nwest in the spring; but during the winter we ourselves will collect all\r\nthe forces we can, and then try a second time whether we can gain\r\npossession of the Islands, or find our graves there.”\r\n\r\n“I have made up my mind,” said Earl Rögnvald, “not to make another\r\njourney like that we made just now, and I think that most of us who went\r\nare of the same mind.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LIX\r\n\r\n                         EARL RÖGNVALD’S PLANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARL PAUL went back to the Orkneys, after having taken the ships of Earl\r\nRögnvald. He had gained a great victory, and feasted all his friends and\r\nvassals.\r\n\r\nIt was now resolved to make a beacon in Fridarey (Fair Isle), which\r\nshould be lighted if enemies were seen coming from Hjaltland. Another\r\nbeacon was made in Rínarsey (North Ronaldsay), and others in some other\r\nislands also, so that they might be seen all over the Islands.\r\nThorstein, the son of Hávard, Gunni’s son, was to have charge of that on\r\nRínarsey; his brother Magnus of the one in Sandey; Kugi of that in\r\nWestrey; and Sigurd, at Westness, of the one in Rólfsey. Olaf, Rólf’s\r\nson, went to Dungalsbæ, in Caithness, and was to have the emoluments of\r\nthat place. His son Valthióf lived at that time in Straumsey (Stroma).\r\n\r\nEarl Paul gave presents to his men, and all promised him their unfailing\r\nfriendship. He had many men about him in the autumn, until he heard that\r\nRögnvald and his men had left Hjaltland. Nothing happened in the Islands\r\nuntil Yule. Earl Paul had a grand Yule feast, which he prepared at his\r\nestate in Jórfiara (Orphir), and invited many guests. Valthióf, Olaf’s\r\nson, from Straumsey (Stroma), was invited. He went with his men in a\r\nten-oared boat, and they perished all of them in the West Firth on Yule\r\nEve. That was thought sad news, as Valthióf was a most accomplished man.\r\nHis father, Olaf, had a large party in Caithness. There were his sons\r\nSwein and Gunni, and the sons of Grím of Swiney,[328] Asbiörn and\r\nMargad, brave-looking fellows, who always followed Swein. Three nights\r\nbefore Yule, Swein, Olaf’s son, Asbiörn, and Margad, had put out to\r\nsea-fishing, and Asleif and her son, and Gunni, Olaf’s son, had gone a\r\nshort distance to visit their friends. The night after that Olvir Rosta\r\narrived at Dungalsbæ with the party that had been out with him on a\r\nviking-raid during the summer. He surprised Olaf in the house, and set\r\nit on fire immediately. There he was burnt with five others, but the\r\nrest were permitted to escape. Olvir and his men took all the movable\r\nproperty, and then went away.\r\n\r\nAfter this Swein was called Asleif’s son. He came home on Yule Eve, and\r\nwent immediately out north, on the Pentland Firth. At midnight they came\r\nto Grím, the father of Asbiörn and Margad, in Swefney (Swona); he went\r\ninto the boat to them, and they brought Swein to Knarrarstadir\r\n(Knarstane), in Skálpeid (Scapa). A man, by name Arnkel, lived there.\r\nHis sons were Hánef and Sigurd. Grím and his sons returned, and Swein\r\ngave him a finger-ring of gold. Hánef and Sigurd accompanied Swein to\r\nJórfiara (Orphir), where he was well received; and he was conducted to\r\nhis kinsman Eyvind Melbrigdi’s son. Eyvind conducted him to Earl Paul,\r\nwho received him well, and asked his news. He told him of his father’s\r\ndeath, at which the Earl was much grieved, and said it had in a great\r\nmeasure happened through him. He invited Swein to stay with him, and he\r\naccepted the invitation with thinks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER LX\r\n\r\n                           SWEIN SLAYS SWEIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEN they went to evensong. There was a large homestead there (at\r\nOrphir); it stood on the hill-side, and there was a height behind the\r\nhouses. From the top of the hill Aurridafiörd[329] may be seen on the\r\nother side; in it lies Damisey. In this island there was a castle; the\r\nkeeper of it was a man by name Blán, the son of Thorstein, at\r\nFlydruness.[330] In Jórfiara there was a large drinking-hall;[331] the\r\ndoor was near the east gable on the southern wall, and a magnificent\r\nchurch was in front of the door; and one had to go down to the church\r\nfrom the hall. On entering the hall one saw a large flat stone[332] on\r\nthe left hand; farther in there were many large ale vessels; but\r\nopposite the outer door was the stofa.\r\n\r\nWhen the guests came from evensong, they were placed in their seats. The\r\nEarl had Swein, Asleif’s son, next to him. On the other side, next to\r\nthe Earl, was Swein Brióstreip, and then Jón his kinsman. When the\r\ntables were removed, there came in men with the tidings of Valthióf’s\r\ndrowning. This the Earl considered sad news. He said that no one should\r\ntell it to Swein while the Yule feast lasted, adding that he had cares\r\nenow already. In the evening, when they had finished drinking, the Earl\r\nwent to bed, and so did most of his guests. Swein Brióstreip went out\r\nand sat out all night, as was his wont. In the night (at midnight?) the\r\nguests arose and heard mass, and after high mass they sat down to the\r\ntable. Eyvind Melbrigdi’s son, shared the management of the feast with\r\nthe Earl, and did not sit down to the table. Table-boys and candle-boys\r\nwere standing before the Earl’s table,[333] but Eyvind handed\r\ndrinking-cups to each of the Sweins. Swein Brióstreip thought Eyvind\r\npoured more into his cup than Swein, Asleif’s son’s, and that he took\r\nthe cup away from the latter before he had emptied it, so he called\r\nSwein, Asleif’s son, a sluggard at his drink. There had long been a\r\ncoldness between Swein Brióstreip and Olaf, Hrólf’s son, and also\r\nbetween him and Swein, Asleif’s son, since he grew up. When they had\r\nbeen drinking for a while, the guests went to nones’ service. When they\r\ncame in again, memorial toasts[334] were proposed, and they drank out of\r\nhorns. Then Swein Brióstreip wished to exchange horns with his namesake,\r\nsaying his was a small one. Eyvind, however, put a big horn into Swein\r\nAsleif’s son’s hand, and this he offered to his namesake. Then Swein\r\nBrióstreip became angry, and was overheard by the Earl and some of the\r\nmen muttering to himself, “Swein will be the death of Swein, and Swein\r\nshall be the death of Swein.” But nothing was said about it. The\r\ndrinking went on until evensong; and when the Earl went out, Swein,\r\nAsleif’s son, walked before him; but Swein Brióstreip remained behind\r\ndrinking. When they came out to the ale-room, Eyvind followed them, and\r\ncraved a word alone with Swein, Asleif’s son.\r\n\r\nHe said, “Did you not hear what your namesake said when you offered him\r\nthe horn?”\r\n\r\n“No,” he replied.\r\n\r\nThen Eyvind repeated his words, and said that it was surely the devil\r\nthat had spoken through his mouth in the night. “He intends to kill\r\nyou,” he added, “but you should forestall him, and slay him.”\r\n\r\nEyvind put an axe into his hand, and told him to stand in the shadow\r\nbeside the flat stone; he should strike him in front if Jón preceded\r\nhim; but from behind if Jón followed him.\r\n\r\nThe Earl went to the church, and no one took heed of Eyvind and Swein;\r\nbut when Swein Brióstreip and Jón walked out shortly after, the latter\r\nhad a sword in his hand, as was his habit, though the others were\r\nunarmed. Jón walked in front. Some light came through the outer door,\r\nbut outside the sky was cloudy. When Swein Brióstreip came into the\r\ndoorway, Swein, Asleif’s son, struck him on the forehead, so that he\r\nstumbled, but did not fall; and when he regained his footing, he saw a\r\nman in the door, and thought it was he who had wounded him. Then he drew\r\nhis sword, and struck at his head, splitting it down to the shoulders.\r\nThis, however, was Jón, his kinsman, and they fell there both. Eyvind\r\ncame up at the same moment, and led Swein, Asleif’s son, into the stofa,\r\nopposite the door, and he was dragged out through a window. There\r\nMagnus, Eyvind’s son, had a horse ready for him, and accompanied him\r\naway behind the house, and into Aurrida Firth. There he took a boat, and\r\nbrought Swein to the castle in Damisey; and the next morning Blán\r\naccompanied him to Bishop William, in Egilsey. When they arrived there\r\nthe Bishop was at mass, and after the mass Swein was conducted to him\r\nsecretly. Swein told the Bishop the news—the death of his father and\r\nbrother Valthióf, and the slaughter of Swein and Jón; then he besought\r\nthe Bishop’s assistance. The Bishop thanked him for the slaughter of\r\nSwein Brióstreip, and said it was a good riddance.[335] He kept Swein,\r\nAsleif’s son, during the Yule-tide, and after that he sent him to a man\r\ncalled Höldbodi, Hundi’s son, in Tyrvist (Tiree), in the Sudreyar\r\n(Hebrides). Höldbodi was a great chief, and received Swein very well,\r\nand there he spent the winter highly esteemed of all the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXI\r\n\r\n                             OF EARL PAUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SHORT time after the slaughters had been committed in Jórfiara, the\r\nmen ran from the church, and carried Swein into the house, for he was\r\nnot yet dead, but insensible, and he died during the night. The Earl\r\ncommanded every one to take his seat, as he wished to know for certain\r\nwho had committed the manslaughters. Then Swein, Asleif’s son, was\r\nmissed, and it was thought clear that he had done the deed.\r\n\r\nThen Eyvind came and said that it was plainly seen that Swein Brióstreip\r\nmust have killed Jón.\r\n\r\nThe Earl said that no one should touch a hair of Swein Asleif’s son’s\r\nhead, as this had not been done without provocation. “But if he avoids\r\nmeeting with me,” he said, “he will harm himself by so doing.”\r\n\r\nIt was thought most probable that Swein had gone to Hákon Karl in\r\nPapuli,[336] the brother of Earl Magnus the holy. He was a great chief,\r\na quiet man and moderate. The Earl did not hear of Swein that winter,\r\nand then he outlawed him. In the spring the Earl visited many of the\r\nnorthern islands, to collect his land-dues. He made great friends of the\r\nchiefs, and bestowed presents with both hands. The Earl visited\r\nStraumsey (Stroma), and gave Thorkel Flettir the farm which Valthióf\r\nhad, till such time as he should know where Swein was.\r\n\r\nThorkel said: “Here the saying does not prove true, that ‘the King has\r\nmany ears.’ Although you are an Earl, I think it strange that you have\r\nnot heard of Swein, for I knew immediately that Bishop William had sent\r\nhim to Höldbodi, Hundi’s son, in the Sudreyar, and there he has been all\r\nwinter.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl replied: “What shall I do with a Bishop who has acted thus?”\r\n\r\nThorkel replied: “The Bishop should not be blamed for this in critical\r\ntimes like these; and you will need all your friends if Rögnvald and his\r\nmen come from the east.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl said that was true.\r\n\r\nFrom Straumsey he went to Rínarsey, and received an entertainment from\r\nRagna and her son Thorstein. Ragna was a wise woman. They (she and her\r\nson) had another farm in Papey. The Earl spent three nights there, as he\r\nwas prevented by weather from going to Kugi, in Westrey. The Earl and\r\nRagna spoke of many things.\r\n\r\nShe said to him: “There was no great loss in Swein Brióstreip, although\r\nhe was a brave warrior, for he brought on you the hatred of many. I\r\nshould therefore advise you, in presence of the difficulties that face\r\nyou, to make as many friends as possible, and be slow to resent\r\noffences. I could wish that you would not attach blame to Bishop William\r\nand other kinsmen of Swein, Asleif’s son, but rather take the Bishop\r\ninto favour, and send word to the Sudreyar after Swein to pardon him and\r\nrestore him his possessions, in order that he may be to you such as his\r\nfather was. It has long been the custom of the noblest men to do a great\r\ndeal for their friends, and thus to secure support and popularity.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl replied: “You are a wise woman, Ragna, but you have not yet\r\nbeen made Earl of the Orkneys, and you shall not rule the land here. Is\r\nit come to this, that I must give Swein money in order to be reconciled\r\nto him, thinking that it would be to my advantage?” Then he became\r\nwroth, and continued: “Let God decide between me and my kinsman\r\nRögnvald, and may He let it happen to each of us according to his deeds.\r\nIf I have offended against Rögnvald, I now make offer of reparation; but\r\nif he will invade my dominions, I will think him my greatest friend who\r\nassists me to defend them. I have never seen Rögnvald; and, so far from\r\nhaving ever offended him with my knowledge, it is known that I had no\r\npart in what my kinsmen did.”\r\n\r\nMany replied that to try to deprive him of his possessions by force of\r\narms would be a most unprovoked assault; and no one spoke against this.\r\n\r\nWhen the spring advanced, Earl Paul had beacons kept up in Fridarey\r\n(Fair Isle) and Rínarsey (North Ronaldsay), and almost all the Islands,\r\nso that each could be seen from the other. A man named Dagfinn,\r\nHlödver’s son, an active fellow who had a farm in Fridarey, was to keep\r\nthat beacon, and light it if an army were seen coming from Hjaltland.\r\n\r\nEarl Rögnvald spent the winter at home at Agdir (in Norway), where he\r\nand his father had farms, and sent messages to his kinsmen and friends.\r\nSome of them he visited himself, and asked them to assist him with\r\ntroops and ships to go to the west, and most of them were willing to\r\nhelp him in his need.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of Gói,[337] Kol sent away two transport vessels; one\r\nwest to England to buy provisions and arms. Sölmund took the other south\r\nto Denmark, to buy such things as Kol told him, because he had all the\r\nmanagement of their equipment. It was intended that these vessels should\r\nreturn about Easter, and they had arranged to start in the week after\r\nEaster. Kol and Rögnvald had one war-ship each, and Sölmund a third;\r\nthey had also a transport ship with provisions. When they came to\r\nBiörgvin, King Harald was there, and he gave Rögnvald a war-ship fully\r\nmanned. Jón Fót (leg) had a war-ship also. Aslák, the son of Erlend,\r\nfrom Hernur, and the daughter’s son of Steigar Thórir, had the sixth; he\r\nhad also a barge with provisions. Thus they had six large ships, five\r\nboats, and three transports. When they were waiting for fair wind at\r\nHernur, a ship came from the west, and they asked for news from the\r\nOrkneys, and also what preparations Earl Paul would have if Earl\r\nRögnvald came to the west.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXII\r\n\r\n                            KOL’S COUNSELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHILE they were lying at Hernur, Earl Rögnvald called together a meeting\r\nof his men, and spoke of Earl Paul’s preparations, and also of the great\r\nenmity the Orkneymen showed against himself, since they were going to\r\nprevent him taking possession of his patrimonial inheritance, which had\r\nbeen justly given him by the Kings of Norway. He made a long and\r\neloquent speech, the conclusion of which was that he intended to go to\r\nthe Orkneys and gain them or die there. His speech was approved of by\r\nall, and every one promised him faithful support.\r\n\r\nThen Kol arose and said: “We have heard from the Orkneys that all the\r\nislanders will rise with Earl Paul against you to keep you out of your\r\ninheritance. They are slow to lay aside the enmity which they have\r\nconceived against you, kinsman. Now it is my counsel to seek for help\r\nwhere it is likely to be had effectually, and to pray that he may permit\r\nyou to enjoy these possessions, to whom they rightly belong—namely, the\r\nHoly Saint Magnus, your mother’s brother. It is my wish that you should\r\nmake a vow to him, that he may grant you your patrimony and his\r\ninheritance. You should promise one thing—that if you obtain those\r\ndominions you will build a stone minster at Kirkiuvag (Kirkwall) in the\r\nOrkneys, more magnificent than any other in these lands, dedicating it\r\nto your kinsman, Earl Magnus the Holy, endowing it with money, so that\r\nit may be fitly established, and that his relics and the Bishop’s see\r\nmay be brought there.”\r\n\r\nEvery one thought this good advice, and the vow was made and confirmed.\r\nThen they stood out to sea, and had a fair wind. They landed in\r\nHjaltland, and the inhabitants there, as well as the Norwegians, were\r\nglad to see each other. The Hjaltlanders were able to tell them much\r\nfrom the Orkneys, and there they stayed for some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXIII\r\n\r\n                            OF KOL AND UNI.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNI, who has been mentioned before, and who was an accomplice in the\r\nslaughter of Brynjúlf, was now advanced in years.\r\n\r\nOnce Kol said to him: “What plan would you propose, Uni, in order to get\r\nthe beacon in Fridarey discontinued, or how would you manage to prevent\r\nit from being lighted a second time? I put this question to you, because\r\nI know you are more ready-witted than most others here present, although\r\nhere are men of more distinction.”\r\n\r\nUni replied: “I am not a man of invention, and I do not wish the\r\nexpedition to be made according to my plans; I would rather choose to\r\ncome afterwards, for then I should follow my own devices.”\r\n\r\nShortly after, Kol had many small boats made ready, and directed their\r\ncourse to the Orkneys. No chiefs took part in this expedition except\r\nKol. When they had gone so far that they thought they could be seen from\r\nFridarey, Kol had the sails spread on all the boats, but ordered his men\r\nto row backwards, in order that their speed might be as slow as\r\npossible, although the wind was right astern. The sails were at first\r\nhauled to the middle of the masts only, but afterwards higher, as if\r\nthey were coming nearer to the island.\r\n\r\nKol said: “These manœuvres will be seen from Fridarey as if the boats\r\nwere approaching nearer. They will then perhaps light the beacon, but\r\nthey will go themselves to Earl Paul to tell him the news.”\r\n\r\nSo when the beacon in Fridarey was seen, Thorstein, Ragna’s son, lighted\r\nthe beacon in Rínarsey; then the beacons were lighted one after another\r\nin all the Islands, and all the Bœndr went to the Earl, and there was a\r\ngreat gathering of men.\r\n\r\nWhen Kol saw the beacon burning, he ordered his men to turn back, saying\r\nthat this would now cause dissensions among their enemies. This done,\r\nKol went back to Hjaltland, and said to Uni that he should now carry out\r\nhis scheme.\r\n\r\nUni took with him three Hjaltlanders, and they took a six-oared boat,\r\nsome provisions, and fishing tackle. They went to Fridarey. Uni said he\r\nwas a Norwegian, but had been married in Hjaltland, and had sons there.\r\nHe further said that he had been robbed by Earl Rögnvald’s men, and\r\nspoke very ill of them. He took a house there, but his sons went out\r\nfishing, and he stayed at home himself and took care of the fish they\r\ncaught. He entered into conversation with the men of the island, and\r\nbecame familiar with them, and was well liked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXIV\r\n\r\n                           OF THE ORKNEYMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Dagfinn had lighted the beacon, he went to Paul, as has been\r\nmentioned before. All the Earl’s leading men came to him also. A watch\r\nwas kept for Rögnvald’s movements, and it was thought strange that he\r\nnowhere appeared. Still the troops were kept together for three days.\r\nThen the Islanders began to murmur, saying that it was great foolishness\r\nto light beacons when fishermen were seen in their boats.\r\n\r\nThorstein, Ragna’s son, was blamed for having lighted the beacon in\r\nRínarsey. He replied that he could do nothing but light his beacon when\r\nhe saw the blaze in Fridarey, and said that this had all happened\r\nthrough Dagfinn.\r\n\r\nDagfinn replied: “People come more frequently to harm through you when\r\nyou cannot blame me for it.”\r\n\r\nThorstein told him to be silent, and leapt up with an axe and dealt him\r\na heavy blow. Then each man seized his weapons, and there was a fray.\r\nThis was in Hrossey, not far from Kirkiuvag. Sigurd from Westness, and\r\nhis son Hákon Kló, and Brynjúlf, took part with Hlödver, Dagfinn’s\r\nfather, but Thorstein was aided by his kinsmen. Then the Earl was\r\ninformed of what was going on, and it was a long time until he could\r\npart them.\r\n\r\nKugi of Westrey made a long speech, and said: “Do not disgrace the Earl\r\nby fighting among yourselves. Ere long you will need all your men; let\r\nus take care then not to be disabled or at enmity among ourselves. This\r\nhas probably happened according to the designs of our enemies, and has\r\nbeen a device of theirs to destroy the beacons in this way. Now they may\r\nbe expected every day, and let us make our plans accordingly.”\r\n\r\nDagfinn said: “No one has had any evil intention in this, but we have\r\nacted with more thoughtlessness than we ought to have done.”\r\n\r\nKugi guessed the whole truth, and spoke many wise words about it. At\r\nlast they both agreed that the Earl should judge between them; and it\r\nwas resolved to disperse the gathering, and the people went home.\r\n\r\nA man by name Eirik was now appointed to take charge of the beacon in\r\nFridarey. When Uni had stopped there a short time, he came to Eirik, and\r\nsaid: “Would you like me to take care of the beacon; I have nothing else\r\nto do, and can give it my undivided attention.” Eirik accepted his\r\noffer, and when no one was near Uni poured water over it, and made it so\r\nwet that it could not be lighted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXV\r\n\r\n                 THE BEACONS OF THE ORKNEYS DESTROYED.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARL RÖGNVALD and his men said they would wait until the tidal currents\r\nwere met by an east wind, for then it is hardly possible to go from\r\nWestrey to Hrossey, but with east wind one can sail from Hjaltland to\r\nWestrey. For this Rögnvald and his men waited, and came one Friday\r\nevening to Höfn,[338] in Westrey, to Helgi, who dwelt there.\r\n\r\nNo beacons could be lighted, for when the sails were seen from Fridarey,\r\nEirik prepared to go to Earl Paul, and sent a man to Uni to light the\r\nbeacon, but when he came there Uni was away. When the man tried to light\r\nthe beacon himself, it was so wet that it would not burn. When Eirik\r\nheard this, he knew what was the matter, and went to Earl Paul and told\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhen Earl Rögnvald had arrived in Westrey, the islanders ran together.\r\nHelgi and Kugi put themselves at their head, and their first plan was to\r\ntry to make peace with the Earl; and their dealings ended in such a way\r\nthat the Westreymen submitted to Earl Rögnvald, and swore him oaths of\r\nfealty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXVI\r\n\r\n                      ROGNVALD RULES THE ORKNEYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nON Sunday Earl Rögnvald had mass celebrated there in the village.[339]\r\nAs they were standing outside the church, they saw sixteen men\r\napproaching unarmed, and with their hair close cut. The Earl’s men\r\nthought their dress singular, and spoke among themselves of who they\r\nmight be. Then the Earl made a ditty:\r\n\r\n                Sixteen have I seen together,\r\n                With a small tuft on their foreheads;\r\n                Surely these are women coming,\r\n                All without their golden trinkets.\r\n                Now may we of this bear witness.\r\n                In the west here all the maidens\r\n                Wear their hair short—that isle Elon[340]\r\n                Lies out in the stormy ocean.\r\n\r\nAfter Sunday, Earl Rögnvald’s men visited the neighbouring districts,\r\nand all the people gave in their submission to the Earl. One night in\r\nWestrey the Earl’s men became aware that the islanders were holding a\r\nsecret meeting to devise some treachery against Earl Rögnvald. When the\r\nEarl heard of it, he rose and went to the place of meeting. When he came\r\nthere, his men had beaten many of the islanders, and had taken Farmer\r\nKugi and put him in fetters, saying that he was the author of all these\r\nproceedings. Kugi pled his cause eloquently, and many put in a word for\r\nhim, and protested his innocence with him. Then the Earl sang:\r\n\r\n                  I can see the crooked irons\r\n                  Fastened round the legs of Kugi;\r\n                  Stray thou canst not in thy fetters,\r\n                  Old man! fond of making night trips;\r\n                  Now you must not hold night meetings,\r\n                  And must keep the peace established;\r\n                  Kugi! all your tricks are hinder’d,\r\n                  And your oaths you must keep sacred.\r\n\r\nThe Earl pardoned them all, and they renewed their compact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXVII\r\n\r\n                       OF EARL ROGNVALD AND PAUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER Earl Rögnvald’s arrival in the Orkneys, and when many had\r\nsubmitted to him, Earl Paul held a meeting in Hrossey with his men for\r\nconsultation. The Earl asked their opinion of what was to be done in\r\nthese difficulties. There were considerable differences of opinion. Some\r\nadvised Earl Paul to share his dominions with Earl Rögnvald. But most of\r\nthe more powerful men and Bœndr wished to buy Rögnvald away with money,\r\nand offered their means for that purpose. Others were for fighting, as\r\nthey said that this had been the successful way before.\r\n\r\nEarl Rögnvald had spies at the meeting, and when they came to him, the\r\nEarl asked a certain skald, who had been there, for news. He sang:—\r\n\r\n                Of our foes I gain’d this knowledge\r\n                That o’er secrets they are brooding.\r\n                From the meeting of the Bœndr\r\n                Has the great chief heard the tidings\r\n                That among the powerful feeders\r\n                Of the wolves, the wish prevails that\r\n                All your ships should leave the islands\r\n                And that Paul should rule the land here.\r\n\r\nThen Earl Rögnvald sent men to see the Bishop, and asked for his\r\nintervention. He also sent for Thorstein, Ragna’s son, and Thorstein,\r\nHávard’s son, in Sandey, and requested them to try to make peace between\r\nhim and his kinsman. The Bishop procured a fortnight’s truce, in order\r\nthat they might endeavour to establish a more lasting peace. Then the\r\nislands were allocated that should maintain each of them in the\r\nmeantime.[341] Earl Rögnvald went to Hrossey (Mainland), and Earl Paul\r\nto Hrólfsey (Rousay).\r\n\r\nAt this time it happened that the kinsmen Swein, Asleif’s son, Jón Væng\r\nof Uppland in Háey, and Rikgard of Brekkur in Stiórnsey (Stronsay),\r\nattacked Thorkel Flettir on the estate which had belonged to Valthióf,\r\nand burnt him in the house, with nine others. After that they went to\r\nEarl Rögnvald, and told him that they would go to Earl Paul with the\r\nwhole body of their kinsmen, if he would not receive them; but he did\r\nnot turn them away.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Haflidi, Thorkel’s son, heard of his father’s burning, he\r\nwent to Earl Paul, who received him well.\r\n\r\nAfter this Jón and his men bound themselves to serve Earl Rögnvald, who\r\nhad now many followers in the Islands, and had become popular. Earl\r\nRögnvald gave leave to Jón, Sölmund, and Aslák, and many others of his\r\npartizans, to go home, but they said they preferred to wait until\r\nmatters should be definitely settled. Earl Rögnvald replied: “If it is\r\nthe will of God that I should gain possession of the Orkneys, I think He\r\nand the Holy Earl Magnus, my kinsman, will give me strength to hold\r\nthem, even if you go home to your estates.”\r\n\r\nThen they went home to Norway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXVIII\r\n\r\n                     SWEIN TAKES EARL PAUL CAPTIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY in the spring, Swein, Asleif’s son, left the Sudreyar (Hebrides),\r\nand went to Scotland to see his friends. He stayed a long time at\r\nAtjöklar (Athole) with Earl Maddad and Margaret, Hákon’s daughter, and\r\nhad many secret consultations with them. Swein heard that there were\r\ndisturbances in the Orkneys, and became desirous of going there to see\r\nhis kinsmen. He went first to Thórsey (Thurso), in Caithness,\r\naccompanied by a nobleman by name Liótólf. Swein had stayed with him a\r\nlong time in the spring. They came to Earl Ottar, at Thórsey, the\r\nbrother of Frákork. Liótólf tried to make them compose the matters that\r\nhad been done by Frákork’s orders, and Earl Ottar made compensation for\r\nhis part. He promised his friendship to Swein, and he promised to Ottar,\r\nin return, to help Erlend, the son of Harald Sléttmáli (smooth-talker),\r\nto obtain his patrimony in the Orkneys when he should wish to claim it.\r\n\r\nSwein changed ships there, and took a barge manned by thirty men. He\r\ncrossed the Pentland Firth with a north-westerly wind, and so along the\r\nwest side of Hrossey, on to Efjusund,[342] and along the sound to\r\nHrólfsey (Rousay). At one end of the island there is a large headland\r\nand a vast heap of stones beneath it. Otters often resorted to this\r\nstone-heap. As they were rowing along the sound, Swein said, “There are\r\nmen on the headland, let us land and ask them for news; let us change\r\nour dress, untie our hammocks,[343] and twenty of us lie down there, and\r\nten keep on rowing: let us go leisurely.” When they came near the\r\nheadland the men in the island called to them to row to Westness, and\r\nbring Earl Paul what was in their vessel, thinking they were speaking to\r\nmerchants. Earl Paul had spent the night at a feast with Sigurd, at\r\nWestness. He had been early up in the morning, and twenty men had gone\r\nsouth on the island to catch otters, which were in the stone-heap\r\nbeneath the headland. They were going home to get a morning draught. The\r\nmen in the barge rowed near the land; they asked the men on shore about\r\nall the news, and were asked what news they brought, and whence they\r\ncame. Swein’s men also asked where the Earl was, and the others said he\r\nwas on the stone-heap there. This was heard by Swein and those that lay\r\nhid with him in the skin-bags. Swein told them to row to land, where\r\nthey could not be seen from the headland. Then he told his men to get\r\ntheir weapons, and slay the Earl’s men wherever they found them, and so\r\nthey did. Swein’s party killed nineteen men, and lost six. They seized\r\nEarl Paul with violence, and brought him on board their ship, and stood\r\nout to sea, returning by the same way, by the west side of Hrólfsey, and\r\nthrough the channel between Háey and Grimsey, and then by the east of\r\nSvelgr,[344] thence to Breidafiord (the Moray Firth), until they came to\r\nEkkialsbakki.[345] There he left his ship with twenty men, and continued\r\nhis journey until he came to Earl Maddad[346] and Margaret, Earl Paul’s\r\nsister, at Atjöklar (Athole). There they were well received. Earl Maddad\r\nplaced Earl Paul in his high seat, and when they were seated, Margaret\r\nentered with a long train of ladies, and advanced to her brother. Then\r\nmen were procured to amuse them; but Earl Paul was moody, and it was no\r\nwonder, for he had many cares.\r\n\r\nIt is not recorded what passed between Earl Paul and Swein while they\r\nwere on the journey together. Earl Maddad, Margaret, and Swein, had a\r\nconsultation together; but in the evening, when the drinking was\r\nfinished, Swein’s followers were conducted to a sleeping-room by\r\nthemselves, and the key turned upon them. This was done every evening\r\nwhile they were there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXIX\r\n\r\n            OF SWEIN, ASLEIF’S SON’S, RETURN TO THE ORKNEYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE day Margaret announced that Swein, Asleif’s son, should go to the\r\nOrkneys to see Earl Rögnvald, and ask him whom he preferred to share in\r\nthe dominion of the Orkneys with him—Earl Paul, or Harald, the son of\r\n(her husband) Maddad, who was then three winters old.\r\n\r\nWhen Earl Paul heard this, he said: “So far as my mind is concerned, I\r\nwill say that I have left my dominions in such a way as has never been\r\nheard of before, I think; and I shall never return to the Orkneys any\r\nmore. I see that this must be God’s vengeance for the theft which I and\r\nmy kinsmen committed. But if God thinks the dominion mine, then will I\r\ngive it to Harald, if he may enjoy it; but I wish some money given to\r\nme, so that I may establish myself in some monastery, and you can take\r\ncare that I do not escape. And you, Swein, shall go out to the Orkneys,\r\nand say that I have been blinded, or still more mutilated, because my\r\nfriends will fetch me if I am an unmaimed man. In that case I may not be\r\nable to refuse to return to my dominions with them, for I suspect that\r\nthey will consider our parting a greater loss than it is.”\r\n\r\nWhat more the Earl said has not been placed on record.\r\n\r\nThen Swein, Asleif’s son, went to the Orkneys, and Earl Paul remained\r\nbehind in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThis is how Swein related these matters. But some men tell the story in\r\na way by no means so creditable (to those concerned)—namely, that\r\nMargaret induced Swein, Asleif’s son, to blind her brother Earl Paul,\r\nthen threw him into a dungeon, and subsequently induced another man to\r\nput him to death. We do not know which of these two statements is the\r\nmore correct; but it is well known that Earl Paul came never again to\r\nthe Orkneys, and that he had no dominions in Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXX\r\n\r\n               OF EARL ROGNVALD AND SWEIN, ASLEIF’S SON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT happened at Westness, when the Earl did not come home, that Sigurd\r\nsent men to search for him. When they came to the stone-heap they saw\r\nthe slain, and then they thought the Earl had been killed. They went\r\nhome and told the news. Sigurd went immediately to examine the bodies,\r\nand they recognised nineteen as the Earl’s men; but six they did not\r\nknow. Then Sigurd sent men to Egilsey, to the Bishop, to tell him the\r\nnews. He went immediately to Sigurd. When they were talking about what\r\nhad happened, Sigurd hinted that it had been done at the instigation of\r\nEarl Rögnvald; but the Bishop replied that it would be proved that Earl\r\nRögnvald had not acted treacherously towards his kinsman Earl Paul. “It\r\nis my opinion,” he said, “that some others have committed this crime.”\r\n\r\nBorgar, the son of Játvör, Erlend’s daughter, who lived at\r\nGeitaberg,[347] had seen the barge coming from the south, and returning.\r\nWhen this was heard, it was believed to have been done at the\r\ninstigation of Frákork and Olvir.\r\n\r\nWhen the news spread in the Islands that Earl Paul had disappeared, and\r\nno one knew what had become of him, the Islanders had a consultation,\r\nand most of them went to Earl Rögnvald, and swore fealty to him; but\r\nSigurd, of Westness, and his sons, Brynjúlf and Hákon Kló, said they\r\nwould not swear oaths of fealty to any man while they did not know\r\nanything of Earl Paul, or whether he might he expected to return or not.\r\nThere were others also who refused to swear oaths to Earl Rögnvald.\r\nOthers again fixed an hour or a day when they would become Earl\r\nRögnvald’s men, if Earl Paul had not then been heard of. But when Earl\r\nRögnvald saw that he had to do with many powerful men, he did not refuse\r\nperemptorily anything which the people asked; and, as the time passed,\r\nhe had frequent meetings with the inhabitants, and at each of them some\r\nsubmitted to him.\r\n\r\nOne day it happened in Kirkiuvag (Kirkwall) when Earl Rögnvald was\r\nholding a Thing meeting with the Bœndr, that nine armed men were seen\r\nwalking from Skálpeid (Scapa) to the meeting. When they came near,\r\nSwein, Asleif’s son, was recognised, and all were curious to know what\r\nnews he had to tell. He had come in a ship to Skálpeid, and left it\r\nthere, while he and his men walked to Kirkiuvag. When Swein came to the\r\nmeeting, his kinsmen and friends turned to him, and asked him for news,\r\nbut he did not say much. Swein sent for the Bishop, who welcomed him\r\nheartily, because they had long been friends. They went aside to talk,\r\nand Swein told the Bishop the whole truth about what he had done, and\r\nasked for his advice in these difficult circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop said: “Those are weighty tidings you have brought, Swein, and\r\nwe shall probably not be by ourselves sufficient in this matter. I wish\r\nyou to wait here for me; but I shall plead your cause before the people\r\nand Earl Rögnvald.”\r\n\r\nThen the Bishop went to the meeting, and asked for silence. When silence\r\nwas obtained, the Bishop pleaded Swein’s cause, explaining for what\r\nreason he had left the Orkneys, and what penalties Earl Paul had\r\ninflicted on him for the slaying of Swein Brióstreip, a most wicked man.\r\nThe Bishop concluded by asking Earl Rögnvald and all the people to grant\r\nsecurity to Swein.\r\n\r\nEarl Rögnvald replied: “For my part, I promise Swein three nights’\r\nsecurity; but I think I can see from your countenance, Sir Bishop, that\r\nyou and Swein know some great news which you have not yet made known. I\r\nwish you to take Swein into your keeping, and to be responsible for him,\r\nand I will speak to him to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“I will,” said the Bishop; “and he will be very glad to speak to you as\r\nsoon as possible; for he wishes to become your man, if you are willing\r\nto receive him.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl replied: “I do not think my friends are too many in these\r\nlands, yet I shall have some farther talk before I consent to this.”\r\n\r\nThen these four—Earl Rögnvald, his father Kol, the Bishop, and Swein,\r\nAsleif’s son—had a private interview. Swein repeated everything, good\r\nand bad, that had happened between him and Earl Paul, and they came to\r\nthe conclusion to send away the bulk of the people at the meeting. The\r\nEarl arose next morning and gave the people permission to go home; but\r\nwhen the multitude had gone away, he called together all those that\r\nremained, and made them all renew their promise of security to Swein,\r\nwhile he told the news.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, Magnus[348] Karl, the brother of the Holy Earl Magnus,\r\nwas persuaded to tell Sigurd of Westness and his sons of Earl Paul’s\r\nabduction, that he was not to be expected back to his dominions, and\r\nthat he had been maimed.\r\n\r\nSigurd said: “Great news do I think this, about the carrying away of the\r\nEarl; yet to me the saddest of all is that he should have been maimed,\r\nfor he would not be anywhere where I would not go to him.” Afterwards he\r\ntold his friends that Hákon would not have left him unharmed, if he had\r\nhad a sufficient force with him when he told him these tidings, so\r\ngreatly was he moved by them.\r\n\r\nWhen the news became generally known, all the Orkneymen submitted to\r\nEarl Rögnvald, and he became the sole ruler of Earl Paul’s dominions.\r\n\r\nNot long after this the foundations of St. Magnus’ Church[349] were\r\nmarked out, and craftsmen procured, so that more was done during that\r\nyear than in the ensuing four or five. Kol took great interest in the\r\nerection of the building, and had the principal oversight of the whole;\r\nbut as it proceeded, it became very expensive to the Earl, and his means\r\nwere nearly exhausted. Then he consulted his father, and he advised him\r\nto pass a law declaring that the Earls should be considered to have\r\ninherited all the odal possessions from the owners, but that they were\r\nto be redeemable by the heirs.[350] This was considered a great\r\nhardship. Then Earl Rögnvald called a Thing meeting, and proposed to the\r\nBœndr that they should purchase the odal possessions, so that it would\r\nnot be necessary to redeem them afterwards, and an agreement was made\r\nwith which all parties were satisfied. It was to this effect, that they\r\nshould pay the Earl one mark (eight oz. of silver) for each plough’s\r\nland all over the Islands. From that time there was no want of money to\r\nbuild the church; and it was made a magnificent structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXXI\r\n\r\n                   BISHOP JÓN ARRIVES FROM SCOTLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Earl Rögnvald had ruled the Orkneys two winters he had a Yule-feast\r\nat his estate called Knarrarstadir.[351] The sixth day of Yule a ship\r\nwas seen crossing the Pentland Firth from the south. It was a fine day,\r\nand the Earl was outside the house, with many men, looking at the ship.\r\nThere was also a man named Hrólf, the Earl’s court priest. When the\r\nstrangers landed, they left the ship, and the Earl’s men calculated\r\ntheir number to be fifteen or sixteen.[352] In front of them walked a\r\nman in a blue cloak, with his hair tucked up under the cap; the lower\r\npart of the chin was shaved,[353] but the lips unshaved, and the long\r\nbeard was hanging down (from them). They thought this man somewhat\r\nstrange, but Hrólf said it was Bishop Jón from Atjöklar (Athole), in\r\nScotland. Then the Earl went to meet them, and gave the Bishop a\r\ngracious welcome. He placed him in his high seat, but served at the\r\ntable himself like a waiter.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning the Bishop held a service, and went to Egilsey to see\r\nBishop William. This was the tenth day of Yule. Then both the Bishops\r\nwent with a noble suite to visit Earl Rögnvald, and told him their\r\nbusiness, explaining the agreement between Swein, Asleif’s son, and Earl\r\nMaddad—namely, that their son Harald should bear the title of Earl, and\r\nhave half the Orkneys jointly with Earl Rögnvald, but Earl Rögnvald\r\nshould have the government in his hands, even when Harald grew up; and\r\nif a difference arose between them, Earl Rögnvald should have his own\r\nway.\r\n\r\nSwein was present, and confirmed the Bishop’s statement. It was resolved\r\nto hold a meeting during Lent in Caithness, and there they agreed upon\r\nthe terms above mentioned, and their agreement was confirmed by the\r\noaths of the best men of the Orkneys and Scotland. Then Harald, Maddad’s\r\nson, went to the Orkneys with Earl Rögnvald, and was invested with the\r\ntitle of Earl.\r\n\r\nHarald was accompanied to the islands by Thorbiörn Klerk, the son of\r\nThorstein Höld, and Gudrún, the daughter of Frákork. He was a wise and a\r\ngreat man. He was foster-father to Harald at that time, and had great\r\ninfluence with him. Thorbiörn married in the Orkneys Ingirid, Olaf’s\r\ndaughter, sister to Swein, Asleif’s son. He was sometimes in the\r\nOrkneys, and sometimes in Scotland. He was a most valiant man, but\r\noverbearing in most things.\r\n\r\nSwein, Asleif’s son, took possession of all the estates that belonged to\r\nhis father Olaf and his brother Valthióf; he became a great chief, and\r\nhad always many men with him. He was a wise man, and far-seeing in many\r\nthings; but overbearing and rash. No two men in the west were considered\r\nat that time greater than the brothers-in-law Swein and Thorbiörn, and\r\nthere was a warm friendship between them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXII\r\n\r\n                        THE BURNING OF FRAKORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nON one occasion Swein, Asleif’s son, asked Earl Rögnvald to give him\r\ntroops and ships to take vengeance on Olvir and Frákork for the burning\r\nof his father Olaf.\r\n\r\nThe Earl said: “Do you not think, Swein, that Olvir and that old hag\r\nFrákork, who is good for nothing, will scarcely be able to do us any\r\nharm now?”\r\n\r\nSwein replied: “They will always be mischievous while they live; and I\r\nexpected something else when I did great things for you, than that you\r\nwould refuse me this.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl replied: “What will you be satisfied with?”\r\n\r\nSwein said: “Two ships well equipped.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl said he should have what he wished.\r\n\r\nThen he made preparations for going. When he was ready he sailed south\r\nto Borgarfiord,[354] and had a northwest wind to Dúfeyrar,[355] which is\r\na trading-place in Scotland. From there he passed Moray to\r\nEkkialsbakki,[356] and from there he went to Earl Maddad at Atjöklar\r\n(Athole). He gave Swein guides who knew the way across mountains and\r\nforests wherever Swein wished to go; and he went through the interior of\r\nthe country, over mountains and through woods, away from all\r\nhabitations, and came down in Hjálmundal,[357] near the middle of\r\nSutherland. Olvir and Frákork had had spies wherever they thought they\r\nmight expect enemies from the Orkneys, but this way they did not expect\r\nany. They did not, therefore, perceive the enemy till Swein and his men\r\nwere in a certain slope behind the house. Olvir Rosta met them there\r\nwith sixty men, and the fight began immediately. There was little\r\nresistance on the part of Olvir’s men, and they retreated towards the\r\nhouses, because they could not reach the wood. A great many were killed,\r\nand Olvir ran to Hjálmundal’s river, and then up on the mountains. After\r\nthat he went to Scotland’s Firth (on the west coast), and from there to\r\nthe Sudreyar (Hebrides), and he is not mentioned further in this Saga.\r\n\r\nWhen Olvir escaped, Swein and his men approached the houses, and\r\nplundered everything. Then they burnt the houses, with all the inmates,\r\nand there Frákork perished. Swein and his men committed many ravages in\r\nSutherland before they went to their ships. After that they were out on\r\nraids during the summer, and ravaged in Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn Swein came to Earl Rögnvald in the Orkneys, and was well\r\nreceived. Then he crossed over to Ness (Caithness), and spent the winter\r\nin Dungalsbæ. At this time Swein received a message from Höldbodi, in\r\nthe Sudreyar, that he should come and help him, because Höld from\r\nBretland had been there, driven him from his estates, and taken much\r\nbooty. The messenger was named Hródbjart (Robert), of English descent.\r\nWhen Swein received the message, he quickly left for the Orkneys, and\r\ncalled on Earl Rögnvald, and requested him to give him troops and ships.\r\nThe Earl asked Swein what he was going to do then. He said that he had\r\nreceived a message from a man whom he ought least of all to refuse, and\r\nwho had proved his best friend in his greatest need, and when most\r\nothers were his enemies.\r\n\r\nThe Earl said: “It is well if you part good friends, but most of those\r\nSudreyarmen are treacherous. You must, however, act a manly part, and I\r\nwill give you two ships fully manned.”\r\n\r\nSwein was well pleased with this, and went to the Sudreyar, but did not\r\nfind Höldbodi till he came to the Isle of Man, because the latter had\r\nfled thither. When Swein came to the Isle of Man, Höldbodi was very glad\r\nto see him. The British Höld had plundered and killed men, to a large\r\nextent in the Isle of Man as well as in the Sudreyar. He had killed a\r\nnobleman named Andrew, who left a widow by name Ingirid, and a son by\r\nname Sigurd. Ingirid was wealthy, and had large estates. Höldbodi\r\nadvised Swein to woo her; and when he proposed marriage, she made it a\r\ncondition of her acceptance that he should avenge her late husband\r\nAndrew.\r\n\r\nSwein replied: “I may inflict some loss on the British, but we cannot\r\nknow how we may succeed in manslaying.”\r\n\r\nThen Swein and Höldbodi went out on an expedition with five ships. They\r\nplundered in Bretland, landing at a place called Jarlsness,[358] and\r\ncommitting great ravages. One morning they went into a certain village,\r\nand met with a little resistance. The inhabitants fled from the village,\r\nand Swein and his men plundered everything, and burnt six homesteads\r\nbefore dinner. An Icelander, named Eirík was with Swein, and sang the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n                 Half-a-dozen homesteads burning,\r\n                 Half-a-dozen households plundered:\r\n                 This was Swein’s work of a morning—\r\n                 This his vengeance; coals he lent them.\r\n\r\nAfter this they went to their ships. They were out reiving all the\r\nsummer, and obtained much booty, but Höld fled into an island called\r\nLund,[359] where there was a strong place. Swein besieged it for some\r\ntime, to no purpose. In the autumn they went back to the Isle of Man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER LXXIII.\r\n\r\n                     OF SWEIN AND HOLDBÖDI’S RAIDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS winter Swein married Ingirid, and remained there, greatly honoured.\r\nIn the spring he gathered men together, and went to see Höldbodi, and\r\nasked for his assistance, but he excused himself, saying that many of\r\nhis men were occupied, and some on trading trips; so Swein got none\r\nthere. But the truth was, that he had secretly made peace with Höld, and\r\nconfirmed their alliance by exchanging presents. Swein went out,\r\nnevertheless, with three ships, but made little booty in the earlier\r\npart of the summer. Later they went south, under Ireland, and seized a\r\nbarge belonging to some monks in Syllingar,[360] and plundered it. He\r\nmade inroads in Ireland in many places, obtained a large booty, and\r\nreturned to the Isle of Man in autumn.\r\n\r\nWhen Swein had been a short time at home, he heard a report to the\r\neffect that Höldbodi was not faithful to him, but Swein shrank from\r\nbelieving it. One night in the spring Swein’s watchmen came to him and\r\nsaid that enemies were approaching them. Swein and his men seized their\r\narms, and ran out, and saw a great number of men carrying fire to the\r\nhomestead. Then Swein and his men ran to a hill, and defended themselves\r\nfrom it. They had a horn[361] which they sounded. The neighbourhood was\r\nthickly inhabited, and men came flocking to help Swein, so that the\r\nassailants at last gave way. Swein and his men pursued them, and killed\r\nmany in the flight, but many of both sides were wounded before they\r\nparted. The chief of the attacking band was Höldbodi. He escaped in the\r\nflight, and did not stop till he came to Lundey (Lundy Isle). Höld\r\nreceived him well, and they remained together. Swein went home, and kept\r\na large number of his men about him, maintaining a strict watch, because\r\nhe distrusted the Sudreyarmen. Late in the winter he sold his lands, and\r\nwent early in the spring to Liódhús (Lewis). During this expedition he\r\nhad committed many ravages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXIV\r\n\r\n                      OF EARL ROGNVALD AND SWEIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHILE Swein was in the Sudreyar, Earl Rögnvald went over to Caithness,\r\nand was entertained at Vík (Wick) by a man named Harald. His son was\r\nnamed Swein, an active fellow. While the Earl was there, Thorbiörn Klerk\r\ncame up from Scotland, and said that his father, Thorstein Höld, had\r\nbeen killed by a certain Earl. People talked of how frequently Earl\r\nRögnvald and Thorbiörn spoke together, because the Earl scarcely took\r\nleisure to discharge his duties for that reason. Thorbiörn went with the\r\nEarl out to the Islands (Orkneys), and Swein, Harald’s son, became the\r\nEarl’s tableboy Thorbiörn had been in Scotland for some time. He had\r\nslain two men who had been with Swein, Asleif’s son, at the burning of\r\nFrákork.\r\n\r\nWhen Swein came from the Sudreyar, he went home to his farm in Gáreksey\r\n(Gairsay), and not to Earl Rögnvald, as he used to do when he came from\r\nhis expeditions. So when the Earl heard that Swein had come home from\r\nthe Sudreyar in the summer, he asked Thorbiörn for what reason he\r\nthought Swein did not come to him.\r\n\r\nThorbiörn replied: “I suppose Swein is offended with me because I had\r\nthose men slain who were with him at the burning of Frákork.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl said: “I do not like you to be enemies.”\r\n\r\nThen Earl Rögnvald went to Gáreksey, and tried to reconcile them, which\r\nwas easy, because they both wished the Earl to judge between them. Then\r\nhe made peace between them, and it lasted for a long time after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXXV\r\n\r\n                     EARL ROGNVALD’S PLEASANTRIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT this time there came a certain Icelandic ship to the Orkneys, in\r\nwhich was a man by name Hall, the son of Thórarinn Breidmagi (broad\r\nwaist). He went to Rínarsey (North Ronaldsay), to stay with Thorstein\r\nand Ragna. He became tired of staying there, and asked Thorstein to\r\nbring him to Earl Rögnvald. They went to see him, but the Earl would not\r\nreceive Hall. When they came home, Ragna asked how they had succeeded,\r\nand Hall replied by a ditty:\r\n\r\n                  It was to thy own son, Ragna,\r\n                  (Let truth be known among the people)\r\n                  I gave the noble task of asking\r\n                  My reception ’mong the courtiers;\r\n                  But the generous ring-giver,\r\n                  Who enjoys the highest honour,\r\n                  Has declined my clownish service,\r\n                  Having plenty of the bravest.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards Ragna went to see Earl Rögnvald on this errand\r\nherself. She was so dressed that she had a red head-gear of horse’s\r\nhair; and when the Earl saw her he sang:\r\n\r\n                 Never did I know before this\r\n                 How the ladies of the cross-bench\r\n                 Deck their heads with finest kerchiefs.\r\n                 If I use the proper language,\r\n                 Seems to me that this gold-wearer\r\n                 Hides the tresses of her hind-head\r\n                 With a chestnut filly’s tail-locks,\r\n                 And her head-dress shows her temper.\r\n\r\nRagna said: “Now the saying comes true, ‘that few are so wise that they\r\nsee everything as it is,’ for this [hair] is of a horse, and not of a\r\nmare.”\r\n\r\nThen she took a silken kerchief and wrapped it round her head,\r\ncontinuing, nevertheless, her business with the Earl. He gave her a\r\nrather cold answer at first, but became more pleasant as they spoke\r\nlonger, and she obtained what she wanted—namely, to procure for Hall a\r\nplace at the (Earl’s) court. He remained a long time with Earl Rögnvald.\r\nThey made jointly the “Old Metrekey,”[362] with five verses for each\r\ndifferent metre. Afterwards that was thought too much, and now two\r\nverses only are made for each different metre.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXVI\r\n\r\n               OF EARL ROGNVALD AND SWEIN, ASLEIF’S SON.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEIN, Asleif’s son, is said to have heard that Höldbodi had arrived in\r\nthe Sudreyar. Then he asked Earl Rögnvald to give him troops to avenge\r\nhimself. The Earl gave him five ships, and Thorbiörn Klerk was the\r\ncommander of one of them; Haflidi, the son of Thorkel Flettir, of\r\nanother; Dúfniál, the son of Hávard, Gunni’s son, the third; Rikgard\r\n(Richard), Thorleif’s son, the fourth; and Swein, Asleif’s son, the\r\nfifth. When Höldbodi heard of Swein, he fled from the Sudreyar. Swein\r\nand his men killed many people in the Sudreyar, and ravaged and burnt\r\nfar and wide. They obtained great booty, but could not catch Höldbodi,\r\nand he never came to the Sudreyar after that. Swein wished to remain in\r\nthe Sudreyar during the winter, but Thorbiörn and the others wished to\r\ngo home, and went in the autumn to Caithness, and arrived at Dungalsbæ.\r\nWhen they were going to divide their booty, Swein said they should all\r\nshare equally, but that he himself should have a chief’s share besides,\r\nsaying that he had been the chief, and that the Earl had sent the others\r\nto his assistance. Besides, he added further that he alone had the\r\nquarrel with the Sudreyarmen, while the others had none. Thorbiörn,\r\nhowever, said he did not deserve less than Swein, and had not been less\r\na leader than he. They also wished that all the ships’ commanders should\r\nhave equal shares; but they had to submit to Swein, because his men were\r\nby far the most numerous there on the Ness (in Caithness).\r\n\r\nThorbiörn went out to the Orkneys and told Earl Rögnvald how matters had\r\ngone between him and Swein, and that they were very much displeased to\r\nhave been deprived by him of their just proportion of the spoil.\r\n\r\nThe Earl said it would not be only once that Swein had turned out not to\r\nbe an equitable man, yet he would in the end receive retribution for his\r\ninjustice; but, he added: “You shall not quarrel about this. I shall\r\ngive you as much money of my own as you have lost through him, and it is\r\nmy will that you do not claim it of him. It will be a good thing if this\r\ndoes not lead to greater difficulties with him.”\r\n\r\nThorbiörn replied: “May God reward you, my lord, for the honour you do\r\nus, and we shall not quarrel with Swein about this; but I shall never be\r\nhis friend any more, and I shall do him some despite in return.” And\r\nafter that Thorbiörn divorced himself from Ingirid, Swein’s sister, and\r\nsent her to him over to Ness (Caithness). Swein received her well, but\r\nconsidered Thorbiörn’s conduct a great insult to himself. There was then\r\nfierce enmity between them. Then the saying proved true that monsters\r\nare best matched together.\r\n\r\nWhen Swein was in the Sudreyar, he had placed Margad, Grím’s son, over\r\nhis affairs at Dungalsbæ, and transferred to him the office (of deputy\r\nor factor) which he held from Earl Rögnvald, but Margad was resentful\r\nand overbearing, and became unpopular on account of his violence. Those\r\nwho were the first objects of his oppression ran to Hróald (at Wick),\r\nand remained there. From this enmity arose between the two. Shortly\r\nafter Margad went south to Vík (Wick) on business with nineteen men, and\r\nbefore he left he attacked Hróald, and killed him and several others.\r\nThen he went to Dungalsbæ to see Swein. The latter gathered men\r\ntogether, and went to Lambaborg,[363] where he fortified himself. It was\r\na strong place, and there he remained, with sixty men, and brought\r\nthither provisions and other necessaries. The borg (castle) was situated\r\non a sea-girt rock, and on the landward side there was a well-built\r\nstone wall. The crags ran a long way along the sea on either side. Swein\r\nand his men committed many violent robberies in Caithness, and brought\r\neverything into the stronghold, and became greatly hated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXVII\r\n\r\n                  OF SWEIN, ASLEIF’S SON’S MOVEMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS news came to the ears of Earl Rögnvald, and Swein, Hróald’s son,\r\nand he asked the Earl to help him to obtain redress in this cause; and\r\nmany supported Swein’s request. At last Earl Rögnvald crossed over to\r\nNess (Caithness), and the following chiefs with him:—Thorbiörn; Haflidi,\r\nThorkel’s son; and Dúfniál, Hávard’s son. These counselled the most\r\nsevere measures against Swein. They went to Dungalsbæ, but Swein was not\r\nthere. They heard that he was in Lambaborg, and then the Earl went\r\nthither. When they came to the borg, Swein asked who their leader was,\r\nand he was told that it was Earl Rögnvald. Swein asked him what he\r\nwanted. The Earl said he wished him to deliver Margad up to them. Swein\r\nasked whether he was to receive quarter. The Earl said he would not\r\npromise. Then Swein said: “I have not the heart to deliver Margad into\r\nthe power of Swein, Hróald’s son, or of my other enemies who are with\r\nyou, but I should wish very much to be at peace with you, my lord.”\r\n\r\nThen Thorbiörn Klerk said: “Hear what the traitor says, that he would\r\nwillingly be at peace with his lord after he has plundered his land, and\r\nbetaken himself to the highways like a thief. You make a bad return to\r\nthe Earl for all the honour he has done you, and so you will do to all\r\nyou can.”\r\n\r\nSwein replied: “You need not say much in this case, Thorbiörn, for no\r\nrespect will be paid to your words. But it is my foreboding that you\r\nwill repay him worse for all the honour he has done to you, before you\r\npart, for nobody will gain good fortune from any dealings with you.”\r\n\r\nThen Earl Rögnvald said that men should not rail at each other.\r\n\r\nThen they besieged the borg, and cut off all communication, and a long\r\ntime passed, as they could not make an assault. And when the provisions\r\nwere exhausted, Swein called his men together, and consulted with them.\r\nBut they all said, as with one mouth, that they wished to follow his\r\nguidance as long as they were able.\r\n\r\nThen Swein said: “I think it most disgraceful to starve here, and\r\nafterwards to surrender to our enemies. It has turned out, as was\r\nlikely, that our skill and good fortune should fail against Earl\r\nRögnvald. We have tried to obtain peace and security for life, but\r\nneither was to be had for my companion Margad. Though I know that the\r\nothers will be able to obtain quarter, yet I have not the heart to\r\ndeliver him under the axe. Still, it is not right that so many here\r\nshould suffer for his difficulties, although I am unwilling to part from\r\nhim for a time.”\r\n\r\nThen he tied together ropes which they had, and during the night they\r\nlet Swein and Margad down from the borg into the sea. They swam along\r\nthe cliffs till they came to the end of them, then they got on shore and\r\nwent to Sutherland, thence to Moray, and then to Dúfeyrar.[364] There\r\nthey met with some Orkneymen in a trading vessel. Hallvard and Thorkel\r\nwere the commanders, and they were ten altogether. Swein and Margad went\r\non board with them, when they were twelve together, and then they sailed\r\nsouth off Scotland, until they came to Máeyar (the Isle of May). There\r\nwas a monastery, the head of which was an abbot, by name Baldwin.[365]\r\nSwein and his men were detained there seven nights by stress of weather.\r\nThey said they had been sent by Earl Rögnvald to the King of Scots. The\r\nmonks suspected their tale, and thinking they were pirates, sent to the\r\nmainland for men. When Swein and his comrades became aware of this, they\r\nwent hastily on board their ship, after having plundered much treasure\r\nfrom the monastery. They went in along Myrkvifiörd (the Firth of Forth),\r\nand found David, the King of Scots, in Edinburgh. He received Swein\r\nwell, and requested him to stay with him. He told the King explicitly\r\nthe reason of his visit, how matters had gone between him and Earl\r\nRögnvald before they parted, and also that they had plundered in Máeyar.\r\nSwein and Margad stayed for a while with the King of Scots, and were\r\nwell treated. King David sent men to those who had been robbed by Swein,\r\nand told them to estimate their loss themselves, and then of his own\r\nmoney he made good to every one his loss.\r\n\r\nKing David proposed to Swein to bring his wife from the Orkneys, and to\r\nbestow upon him such honours in Scotland as he might be well satisfied\r\nwith. Swein declared all his wishes to the King. He said it was his wish\r\nthat Margad should remain with him, and that the King should send word\r\nto Earl Rögnvald to be reconciled to him; but he said he would himself\r\nleave his case entirely to the decision of Rögnvald, adding that he was\r\nalways well pleased when there was friendship between them, but ill at\r\nease when they were at enmity.\r\n\r\nKing David replied: “I suppose this Earl is a good man, and you value\r\nnothing except what comes from him, since you prefer the risk of\r\nsurrendering yourself to his good faith, and refuse my offers.”\r\n\r\nSwein said he would never give up his friendship, yet he asked the King\r\nto grant him this, and the King said it should be as he wished.\r\n\r\nKing David sent men to the Orkneys with presents, and a message\r\nrequesting that the Earl would make peace with Swein. Then Swein went\r\nnorth to the Islands, and Margad remained behind with the King. King\r\nDavid’s messengers went to Earl Rögnvald, who received them well, and\r\nalso the presents, promising peace to Swein. Then he was fully\r\nreconciled to Swein, who now returned to his estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER LXXVIII.\r\n\r\n                         EARL VALTHIÓF’S DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Swein and Margad had left Lambaborg,[366] those that were in the\r\nfort resolved to surrender it to Earl Rögnvald. He asked them what they\r\nknew last of Swein and Margad, and they told the truth.\r\n\r\nWhen the Earl heard it, he said: “To tell the truth, Swein has no equal\r\namong those that are now with us, and such feats are both brave and\r\nhardy; but I will not abuse my power over you, although you were\r\ninvolved in these troubles with Swein. Every one of you shall go home in\r\npeace as far as I am concerned.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl went home to the Orkneys, and sent Thorbiörn Klerk in a ship\r\nwith forty men south to Breidafiord (the Moray Firth), to search for\r\nSwein; but he heard nothing of him.\r\n\r\nThorbiörn then said to his men: “Our journey is a strange one; we are\r\nall this time wandering after Swein, but I have heard that Earl\r\nValthióf, who slew my father,[367] is not far off, with but a few men;\r\nand if you will attack him with me, I will promise you that I shall not\r\nact as Swein did—namely, to deprive you of your share if we get any\r\nbooty, for you shall have all we get, except what you wish to give me,\r\nbecause I think glory is better than booty.”\r\n\r\nThen they went to the place where Earl Valthióf was at a banquet, and\r\nsurprised them in the house, and set it on fire immediately. Valthióf\r\nand his men ran to the door, and asked who was the raiser of the fire.\r\nThorbiörn told his name. Valthióf offered compensation for Thorstein’s\r\nslaying, but Thorbiörn said it was useless to ask for peace. They\r\ndefended themselves bravely for a time; but when the fire pressed them\r\nthey ran out; after that their defence was short, because the fire had\r\novercome them. Earl Valthióf fell, and thirty men with him. Thorbiörn\r\nand his men got a great deal of booty, and he kept all his promises to\r\nthem faithfully. Then they went to the Orkneys to Earl Rögnvald, who was\r\nwell satisfied with what they had done. Then there was peace and quiet\r\nin the Islands.\r\n\r\nAt that time a young man lived in the Islands,[368] by name Kolbein\r\nHruga (heap), a very overbearing man; he built a fine stone castle,[369]\r\nwhich was a strong defence. Kolbein’s wife was Herbiörg, the sister of\r\nHákon Barn (child), but their mother was the daughter of Herborg, Paul’s\r\ndaughter. Their children were Kolbein Karl, Bjarni Skáld, Sumarlidi,\r\nAslák, and Frída; they were all well mannered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXIX\r\n\r\n                     OF EINDRIDI UNGI (THE YOUNG).\r\n\r\n\r\nAT that time the sons of Harald Gilli[370] ruled over Norway. Eystein\r\nwas the oldest of them, but Ingi was a legitimate son, and he was most\r\nhonoured by the Lendermen, because he let them have their way in all\r\nthings as they liked. At this time the following Lendermen (Barons)\r\nassisted him in the government:—Ogmund and Erling, the son of Kyrpinga\r\nOrm. They advised King Ingi to send word to Earl Rögnvald, and give him\r\nan honourable invitation, saying truly that he had been a great friend\r\nof his father, and desired him to become as intimate with the Earl as he\r\ncould, so that he might be a dearer friend of his than of his brother,\r\nwhatever might happen between them. The Earl was related to the\r\nbrothers, and a great friend of theirs; and when he received this\r\nmessage, he quickly prepared to go, because he felt a desire to go to\r\nNorway to see his friends and kinsmen. Earl Harald asked to be permitted\r\nto go with him, out of curiosity and to amuse himself; he was then\r\nnineteen winters old.\r\n\r\nWhen the Earls were ready, they started from the west with some\r\nmerchants, having a noble retinue, and arrived in Norway early in the\r\nspring. They found King Ingi in Biörgvin (Bergen), and he received them\r\nvery well. Earl Rögnvald saw many of his friends and kinsmen, and spent\r\na great deal of the summer there. Eindridi Ungi (the young) arrived from\r\nMikligard (Constantinople) that summer; he had been long in service[371]\r\nthere, and was able to tell many things from there; and it was thought\r\ngood entertainment to inquire from him about things in that part of the\r\nworld. The Earl conversed frequently with him.\r\n\r\nOnce when they were talking, Eindridi said: “It seems strange to me that\r\nyou do not think of going out to Jórsalaheim (Jerusalem), and that you\r\nshould be satisfied with being told of the things that are there; it\r\nwould best suit such men as you are to be there on account of your great\r\naccomplishments, and you will be honoured above all others wherever you\r\ncome among noble men.”\r\n\r\nWhen Eindridi had said this, many spoke in favour of it, and exhorted\r\nthe Earl to become the leader of such an expedition. Erling made a long\r\nspeech in support of the proposal, and said he would join the party\r\nhimself, if the Earl would consent to be their chief. And as many men of\r\nnote seemed eager for the journey, he promised to go. And when he and\r\nErling were settling matters between them, many noble men joined the\r\nparty. These Lendermen (Barons) were among them: Eindridi Ungi, who was\r\nto be their guide, Jón Pétrsson, Aslák Erlendsson, Guttorm Möl, and Kol\r\nfrom Halland. It was resolved that none of them should have a larger\r\nship than with thirty benches, except the Earl, and no one should have\r\nan ornamented vessel but he. This was done in order that no one should\r\nenvy another because he had finer men or a better ship than he. Jón Fót\r\n(leg) was to build a ship for the Earl, and to have it as finely fitted\r\nout as possible. Earl Rögnvald went home in the autumn, and intended to\r\nstay at home two winters. King Ingi gave the Earl two long ships—small,\r\nbut very beautiful, and specially built for rowing; they were,\r\ntherefore, of all the ships the swiftest. Earl Rögnvald gave Harald one\r\nof them, called Fífa; the other was called Hjálp. In these ships the\r\nEarls went to sea, holding westward. Earl Rögnvald had received large\r\npresents from his friends. It was Tuesday evening when the Earls put out\r\nto sea, and they had a fair wind during the night. On Wednesday there\r\nwas a great storm, and in the evening they saw land. It was very dark,\r\nand they saw signs of breakers surrounding them on all sides. Up to this\r\ntime they had kept together. There was nothing to be done except to run\r\nthe vessels on shore, and this they did.[372] The beach before them was\r\nstony and narrow, enclosed behind by crags. All the men were saved, but\r\nthey lost a large quantity of their stores. Some of the things were\r\nthrown up by the sea during the night. As usual, Earl Rögnvald bore\r\nhimself as the bravest of all the men there. He was so merry that he\r\nplayed with his fingers, and spoke nearly all his sayings in rhyme. He\r\ntook a golden ring from his hand, and sang this ditty:\r\n\r\n                   Thus I hang the hammer-beaten\r\n                   Hand-ring from my rounded fingers;\r\n                   Thus I put my fingers through it:\r\n                   So the nymph of crashing waters\r\n                   Threw me, joyful, in a rock-rift\r\n                   There to play me with my fingers.\r\n\r\nWhen they had carried their things up from the sea, they went farther\r\ninland to search for habitations, because they thought they knew they\r\nhad landed in Hjaltland. They soon found farms, and distributed\r\nthemselves among them. The people were glad to see the Earl, and when he\r\nwas asked about his voyage, he sang:\r\n\r\n                  Both my ships on beach went crashing;\r\n                  When the surges swept my men off,\r\n                  Sore afflicted by the billows\r\n                  Were the friends of Hjalp and Fífa.\r\n                  Certainly this misadventure\r\n                  Of the danger-seeking rovers\r\n                  Will not soon be quite forgotten\r\n                  By those who got such a wetting.\r\n\r\nThe mistress of the house brought a fur cloak to the Earl, who,\r\nstretching his hands forward to receive it, and laughing, sang this\r\nditty:\r\n\r\n                 Here I shake a shrunken fur coat;\r\n                 Surely ’tis not ornamental.\r\n                 All our clothes are in the ship-field,\r\n                 And it is too wide to seek them.\r\n                 Lately, all the young sea-horses\r\n                 Left we dressed in splendid garments,\r\n                 As we drove the steeds of mast-heads\r\n                 To the crags, across the surges.\r\n\r\nLarge fires were made, and there they warmed themselves. A female\r\nservant entered shivering all over, and her words were unintelligible on\r\naccount of her shiver. The Earl said he understood her:\r\n\r\n                     Asa! you seem quite exhausted.\r\n                     Atatata! ’tis the water.\r\n                     Hutututu! where shall I sit?\r\n                     By the fire—’tis rather chilly.\r\n\r\nThe Earl sent twelve of his men to Einar in Gullberuvík, but he said he\r\nwould not receive them unless the Earl came himself. When Earl Rögnvald\r\nheard this, he sang:\r\n\r\n                    Einar said he would give food to\r\n                    None of all the lads of Rögnvald,\r\n                    He himself alone excepted—\r\n                    (Empty words I now am talking),\r\n                    For I know that he, the friendly,\r\n                    Never failed to keep his promise.\r\n                    Go we in then where the fires are\r\n                    Burning brightly all the evening.\r\n\r\nThe Earl stayed a long time in Hjaltland, and in the autumn he went\r\nsouth to the Orkneys, and resided in his dominions. That autumn two\r\nHjaltlanders[373] came to him. One was named Armód, a poet; the other\r\nwas Oddi the little, the son of Glúm: he made verses well. The Earl\r\nreceived them both as his men. The Earl had a grand Yule feast, to which\r\nhe invited guests, and gave his men presents. He handed a spear, inlaid\r\nwith gold, to the poet Armód, shook it at him, and told him to make a\r\nsong on the spur of the moment:\r\n\r\n                   Princely gifts the battle-fanner\r\n                   With no niggard hand distributes:\r\n                   Scaldic honours are not measured\r\n                   By the gifts bestowed on others.\r\n                   The defender of his country,\r\n                   And the best of all commanders,\r\n                   With his own hand brings to Armód\r\n                   This blood-candle, golden pointed.\r\n\r\nOne day during Yule the guests were looking at the tapestry. The Earl\r\nsaid to Oddi the little: “Make a song about the workman’s handicraft on\r\nthe tapestry, and have it made by the time that I have finished my\r\nstanza, and use none of the same words that are in mine.” The Earl sang:\r\n\r\n                  The old one on the hangings standing,\r\n                  Has a sheath-rod on his shoulder,\r\n                  But, in spite of all his anger,\r\n                  He will not get one step farther.\r\n\r\nOddi sang:\r\n\r\n                   For a stroke himself prepares the\r\n                   Warrior in stooping posture,\r\n                   Where the tapestry is parted;\r\n                   Yet his danger will be greatest.\r\n                   Time it is for ships’ commanders\r\n                   Peace to make ere harm does happen.\r\n\r\nDuring Yule-tide, the Earl entertained Bishop William and many of his\r\nchiefs. Then he made known his intention to go to Jórsalaheim\r\n(Jerusalem), and requested the Bishop to go with him, because he was a\r\ngood Parisian scholar,[374] and the Earl wished him to be their\r\ninterpreter. The Bishop agreed to the Earl’s request, and promised to\r\ngo. The following chiefs went with Earl Rögnvald:—Magnus, the son of\r\nHávard, Gunni’s son; Swein, Hróald’s son; and the following men of\r\nlesser note:—Thorgeir Skotakoll, Oddi the little, Thorberg Svarti, Armód\r\nthe scald, Thorkel Krókauga, Grímkell of Flettuness, and Bjarni his son.\r\nWhen the two winters appointed for their preparations were passed, Earl\r\nRögnvald went early in the spring from the Orkneys east to Norway, to\r\nsee how far the Lendermen (Barons) had progressed with their\r\npreparations; and when he came to Biörgvin, he found there Erling, Jón,\r\nhis brother-in-law, and Aslák, but Guttorm arrived shortly after. To\r\nBiörgvin came also the ship which Jón Fót had caused to be built for the\r\nEarl. It was a most exquisite piece of workmanship, and all ornamented.\r\nThe whole of the carved work on the prow, the vanes, and many other\r\nparts of the ship, were gilt. Altogether, it was a most splendid ship.\r\nEindridi came frequently to town during the summer, and said he should\r\nbe ready in a week. The Earl’s men murmured greatly at having to wait so\r\nlong, and some proposed not to wait for him, saying that such voyages as\r\nthis had been made without Eindridi. A short time after Eindridi came to\r\ntown and said he was ready. Then the Earl commanded his men to set sail\r\nwhen they thought there was favourable wind; and when the day came when\r\nthey thought they might expect a favourable wind, they left the town,\r\nand set sail. The breeze was faint, and the Earl’s ship moved slowly,\r\nbecause it required strong wind. The other chiefs lowered their sails,\r\nand would not leave the Earl. When they were outside the Islands, the\r\nbreeze increased to such a degree that in the smaller vessels they had\r\nto take in sail, but the Earl’s ship now went at a great speed. They saw\r\ntwo large ships coming after them, and soon they passed them. One of\r\nthese two ships was highly finished. It was a dragon; both its head and\r\nstem were richly gilded; it was white on the bows, and painted\r\neverywhere above the sea where it was thought it would look well. The\r\nEarl’s men said that was very likely Eindridi’s, adding: “He has not\r\nkept well the agreement that no one should have an ornamented ship\r\nexcept you, sire.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl replied: “Eindridi’s pride is great, and he may be excused for\r\nnot liking to be on the same level with us, as we are so much his\r\ninferiors; but it is difficult to see whether his good fortune runs\r\nbefore him or goes along with him. But let us not direct our movements\r\naccording to his hotheadedness.”\r\n\r\nEindridi soon passed them in the larger vessel, but the Earl kept all\r\nhis ships together, and had a successful voyage. They arrived all safe\r\nin the Orkneys in the autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER LXXX\r\n\r\n                  OF EARL ROGNVALD AND THE ORKNEYMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was resolved that they should spend the winter there. Some lived at\r\ntheir own expense, others were quartered with the Bœndr, and many were\r\nwith the Earl. There was a great turmoil in the Islands; the Orkneymen\r\nand the Eastmen quarrelled frequently about bargains, and women, and\r\nother things. The Earl had a very difficult task to keep peace among\r\nthem, for both parties considered that he deserved well of them and they\r\nof him.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRAGON SHIP OF THE VIKING PERIOD\r\n(from Holmberg’s Nordbon i Hednatiden.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Eindridi it is to be told that when they came to Hjaltland (Shetland)\r\nhis fine ship was totally wrecked, and he lost a great quantity of\r\ngoods, but the smaller ship was saved. He spent the winter in Hjaltland,\r\nand sent men to Norway to have another ship built for the voyage to the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nOne of Eindridi’s crew was called Arni Spítulegg (stick-leg). He went to\r\nthe Orkneys during the winter with nine men. Arni was a very violent\r\nman, daring and turbulent. He and his comrades lived at their own\r\nexpense during the winter. He bought malt and meat of a tenant of Swein,\r\nAsleif’s son, and when he demanded payment Arni delayed to pay. When he\r\ndemanded it a second time, he was overwhelmed with abuse; and before\r\nthey parted Arni struck him with the back of his axe, saying, “Go and\r\ntell your champion, Swein, whom you are always praising, to obtain\r\nredress for you; you will need no more.” The man went and told Swein,\r\nrequesting him to obtain redress. He gave him a cold answer, and said he\r\nwould promise nothing. One day in the spring Swein went to collect his\r\nrents. They were four together in a ten-oared boat. They had to pass the\r\nisland in which Arni was staying, and Swein said he would land there. It\r\nwas ebbing tide. Swein went on shore alone, carrying an axe with a short\r\nhandle, and no other weapon. He told his men to keep the boat from\r\ngetting aground. Arni Spítulegg and his comrades were lying in an\r\nouthouse not far from the sea. Swein walked up, and found them indoors.\r\nThey greeted him. He acknowledged their greeting, and spoke to Arni,\r\nsaying that he should settle the farmer’s account. Arni replied that\r\nthere was plenty of time for that. Swein asked him to do it for his\r\nintercession, but still Arni refused. Then Swein said he would not ask\r\nany further, and at the same time he drove the axe into Arni’s skull, so\r\nthat the iron was buried in it, and he lost hold of the handle. Swein\r\nran out, and Arni’s companions after him, to the beach. As they ran fast\r\nalong the muddy shore, one of them, who was the swiftest, came to close\r\nquarters with him. There were large roots of seaweed lying in the mud.\r\nSwein seized one of them, and thrust it into the face of the man who had\r\ncome up with him, and he grasped at his eyes to clear the mud away, but\r\nSwein escaped to his boat, and went home to Gáreksey. Shortly after he\r\nwent on his own business over to Caithness, and sent word to Earl\r\nRögnvald to settle the matter about Arni Spítulegg’s slaying. And when\r\nthe Earl received the message, he summoned together those who were\r\nentitled to compensation for Arni, and settled the matter to their\r\nsatisfaction, he himself paying the compensation money. Many other acts\r\nof violence perpetrated by the Eastmen and the Orkneymen during the\r\nwinter the Earl made good out of his own [funds].\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring he called a Thing meeting in Hrossey (Mainland), to\r\nwhich came all the chiefs residing in his dominions. He then made it\r\nknown to them that he intended to leave the Orkneys and to go to\r\nJórsalaheim (Jerusalem), saying that he would leave the government in\r\nthe hands of his kinsman Harald, and praying all his friends to obey\r\nhim, and help him faithfully in whatever he required while he was\r\nobliged to be away himself. Earl Harald was then nearly twenty, tall and\r\nstrong, but ugly; yet he was a wise man, and the people thought he would\r\nbe a good chief.\r\n\r\nIn the summer Earl Rögnvald prepared to leave the Orkneys; but the\r\nsummer was far advanced before he was ready, because he had to wait a\r\nlong time for Eindridi until his ship came from Norway. When they were\r\nready, they left the Orkneys in fifteen large ships. The following were\r\ncommanders of ships:—Earl Rögnvald; Erling Skakki; Bishop William;\r\nAslák, Erlend’s son; Guttorm; Magnus, Hávard’s son; Swein, Hróald’s son;\r\nEindridi Ungi; and the others who were with him are not named. From the\r\nOrkneys they sailed to Scotland, and then to England, and when they\r\nsailed to Nordymbraland (Northumberland), off the mouth of Hvera (the\r\nWear), Armód sang:\r\n\r\n                 High the crests were of the billows\r\n                 As we passed the mouth of Hvera;\r\n                 Masts were bending, and the low land\r\n                 Met the waves in long sand reaches;\r\n                 Blind our eyes were with the salt spray\r\n                 While the youths at home remaining,\r\n                 From the Thing-field fare on horseback.\r\n\r\nThen they sailed till they were south off England, and so on to\r\nValland.[375] There is no account of their voyage until they came to a\r\nseaport called Verbon (Nerbon).[376] There they learned that the Earl\r\nwho had governed the city, and whose name was Geirbiörn, had lately\r\ndied; but left a young and beautiful daughter, by name Ermingerd. She\r\nhad charge of her patrimony, under the guardianship of her noblest\r\nkinsmen. They advised the Queen to invite Earl Rögnvald to a splendid\r\nbanquet, saying that her fame would spread far if she gave a fitting\r\nreception to noblemen arrived from such a distance. The Queen left it to\r\nthem; and when this had been resolved upon, men were sent to the Earl to\r\ntell him that the Queen invited him to a banquet, with as many men as he\r\nhimself wished to accompany him. The Earl received her invitation\r\ngratefully, selecting the best of his men to go with him. And when they\r\ncame to the banquet there was good cheer, and nothing was spared by\r\nwhich the Earl might consider himself specially honoured. One day, while\r\nthe Earl sat at the feast, the Queen entered the hall, attended by many\r\nladies. She had in her hand a golden cup, and was arrayed in the finest\r\nrobes. She wore her hair loose, according to the custom of maidens, and\r\na golden diadem round her forehead. She poured out for the Earl, and the\r\nmaidens played for them. The Earl took her hand along with the cup, and\r\nplaced her beside him. They conversed during the day. The Earl sang:\r\n\r\n                  Lady fair! thy form surpasses\r\n                  All the loveliness of maidens,\r\n                  Though arrayed in costly garments,\r\n                  And adorned with precious jewels:\r\n                  Silken curls in radiant splendour\r\n                  Fall upon the beauteous shoulders\r\n                  Of the goddess of the gold-rings.\r\n                  The greedy eagle’s claws I redden’d.\r\n\r\nThe Earl stayed there a long time, and was well entertained. The\r\ninhabitants of the city solicited him to take up his residence there,\r\nsaying that they were in favour of giving the Queen to him in marriage.\r\nThe Earl said he wished to complete his intended journey, but that he\r\nwould come there on his return, and then they might do what they thought\r\nfit. Then the Earl left with his retinue, and sailed round Thrasness.\r\nThey had a fair wind, and sat and drank, and made themselves merry. The\r\nEarl sang this song:\r\n\r\n                  Long in the Prince’s memory\r\n                  Ermingerda’s soft words shall linger;\r\n                  It is her desire that we shall\r\n                  Ride the waters out to Jordan;\r\n                  But the riders of sea-horses,\r\n                  From the southern climes returning,\r\n                  Soon shall plough their way to Verbon\r\n                  O’er the whale-pond in the autumn.\r\n\r\nThen Armód sang:\r\n\r\n                  Ne’er shall I see Ermingerda\r\n                  More, from this time, if it be not\r\n                  That my fate shall be propitious;\r\n                  Many now are grieving for her.\r\n                  Happy were I if I could but\r\n                  Be beside her just for one day;\r\n                  That, indeed, would be good fortune,\r\n                  Once again to see her fair face.\r\n\r\nThen Oddi sang:\r\n\r\n                  Truth to tell, we two are scarcely\r\n                  Worthy of fair Ermingerda;\r\n                  For this wise and lovely Princess\r\n                  May be called the Queen of Maidens:\r\n                  This the title that beseemeth\r\n                  Best the splendour of her beauty.\r\n                  While she lives beneath the sun-ray,\r\n                  May her lot be ever happy.\r\n\r\nThey went on till they came west to Galicialand,[377] five nights before\r\nYule-tide, and intended to spend it there. They asked the inhabitants\r\nwhether they were willing to sell them provisions; but food is scarce in\r\nthat country, and they thought it a great hardship to have to feed such\r\na numerous host. It so happened that the country was under the rule of a\r\nforeigner, who resided in the castle, and oppressed the inhabitants\r\ngreatly. He made war on them if they did not do everything he wished,\r\nand menaced them with violence and oppression. When the Earl asked the\r\ninhabitants to sell him victuals, they consented to do so until Lent,\r\nbut made certain proposals on their part—to wit, that Earl Rögnvald\r\nshould attack their enemies, and should have all the money which he\r\nmight obtain from them. The Earl communicated this to his men, and asked\r\nthem what they would be inclined to do. Most of them were willing to\r\nattack the castle, thinking that it was a very likely place to obtain\r\nbooty. Therefore Earl Rögnvald and his men agreed to the terms of the\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nWhen the Yule-tide was close at hand the Earl called his men together,\r\nand said: “We have been resting for a while, and have not disturbed the\r\nmen of the castle, and the inhabitants are getting tired of supplying\r\nus. I suppose they will think our promise will come to nothing; and it\r\nis not manly in us not to try to do what we promised. Now, I wish to\r\nhear your advice as to how we are to take the castle, as I know you here\r\nare men of great discretion; therefore I ask every one here present to\r\nstate what plan he thinks most likely to succeed.”\r\n\r\nErling replied to the Earl, and said: “I will not be silent since you\r\ncommand us to speak, although I am not a man of sage counsels; and those\r\nought rather to be asked who have seen more and are more experienced in\r\nsuch undertakings, as Eindridi Ungi. But I suppose we must do here as\r\nthe saying is, ‘Shoot at the bird before we catch it.’ I may try to give\r\nsome advice, whatever may be its value. If you and the other\r\nship-commanders do not think it a bad plan, we shall to-day go all of us\r\nto the wood, and carry three bundles of faggots each to the castle,\r\nbecause it appears to me that the lime would not stand well if much heat\r\nwere applied to it. Let us do this for the next three days, and see what\r\nhappens.”\r\n\r\nThey did as Erling advised, and when they had finished their work Yule\r\nwas close at hand. The Bishop would not permit the inhabitants of the\r\ncastle to be attacked during the Yule-tide.\r\n\r\nThe chief inhabiting the castle was named Gudifrey. He was a wise man,\r\nand somewhat advanced in years. He was a good scholar, had travelled\r\nmuch, and knew many languages. He was a covetous man, and overbearing.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw what the strangers were doing, he called his men together,\r\nand said: “The plan adopted by the Northmen seems to me a wise one, and\r\nlikely to do us great harm. We shall see, when fire is applied to the\r\nstone wall round the castle, that it is not strong. Moreover, the\r\nNorthmen are valiant, and men of great strength, and we may expect a\r\nfierce attack from them if they get an opportunity. Now, I wish to hear\r\nyour advice about the difficult position in which we are placed.”\r\n\r\nBut all his men asked him to do what he thought best.\r\n\r\nThen he said: “My first plan is to tie ropes together, and you shall let\r\nme down over the castle wall. I will dress myself in rags, and go to the\r\ncamp of the Northmen, and see what I can ascertain.”\r\n\r\nThey did as he told them, and he came to Earl Rögnvald pretending to be\r\na beggar, and speaking Valska, as they understood a little of it. He\r\nwalked throughout the camp and begged food. He perceived that there was\r\nmuch jealousy among the Northmen, and that they were divided into two\r\nfactions. Eindridi Ungi was the leader of one, and the Earl of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nGudifrey went to Eindridi and spoke to him. He said that the chief of\r\nthe castle had sent him there, wishing to form an alliance with him. “He\r\nexpects that you will give him quarter if the castle is taken; and he is\r\nmore willing to let you have his treasure, if you will do this in\r\nreturn, than those who wish to have him a dead man.”\r\n\r\nSuch things they spoke, and many others, but it was concealed from the\r\nEarl, as at first they observed profound secrecy. When Gudifrey had been\r\nsome time with the Earl’s men, he returned to his castle. But they did\r\nnot remove their property from it, because they did not know whether the\r\nattack would be successful, and they could not put faith in the\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXXI\r\n\r\n                     EARL ROGNVALD TAKES A CASTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE tenth day of Yule-tide was a fine day, and Earl Rögnvald arose and\r\ncommanded his men to arm themselves, and summoned them with trumpets to\r\nthe attack of the castle. They dragged the wood close to it, and heaped\r\nup large piles round the walls. Then the Earl gave orders where each\r\nshould make the attack. He himself with the Orkneymen had the attack\r\nfrom the south, Erling and Aslák from the west, Jón and Guttorm from the\r\neast, and Eindridi Ungi from the north. When they were ready for the\r\nattack, they set fire to the wood, and the Earl sang:\r\n\r\n                 Maids in lace and snow-white linen\r\n                 Bring us here the white wine sparkling.\r\n                 Fair to see was Ermingerda,\r\n                 When we met her in our travels.\r\n                 Fare we now to try the castle\r\n                 With our flaming oaken firebrands;\r\n                 Quickly leaping from the scabbard\r\n                 Gleams the sharp-edged smiter. Forward!\r\n\r\nNow they began to attack the castle vigorously, both with weapons and\r\nwith fire. They shot missiles into it, for that was the only way of\r\nattack. The besieged did not stand firm on the walls, because they had\r\nto guard themselves against the missiles. They poured down burning pitch\r\nand brimstone, which, however, did very little harm to the Earl’s men.\r\nWhat Erling had foretold came to pass; the lime could not stand the\r\nfire, and the wall fell down, leaving large breaches open.\r\n\r\nA man named Sigmund Ongul (fish-hook), the Earl’s stepson, was one of\r\nthe keenest in the attack, and frequently went in front of the Earl,\r\nalthough he was then hardly a full-grown man. When the attack had lasted\r\nfor a while, all the besieged were driven from the wall. The wind blew\r\nfrom the south, and drove all the smoke towards Eindridi, and when the\r\nfire began to spread rapidly the Earl had water poured on it to cool the\r\nburnt stones, and then there was a short pause in the attack. The Earl\r\nsang a song:\r\n\r\n                Now I mind me of the Yule-tide\r\n                Which I spent with friends and brave men\r\n                On the east of Agdir’s mountains,\r\n                With the valiant warrior Sölmund;\r\n                Now, again, another Yule-tide\r\n                Am I in the same way busy\r\n                At the south side of this castle,\r\n                Adding to the din of weapons.\r\n\r\nFurther he sang:\r\n\r\n                  Glad I was when that fair lady\r\n                  Listened to my love-tale’s telling;\r\n                  Hopelessly was I led captive\r\n                  By a Valland maid in autumn.\r\n                  Still I love the noble lady,\r\n                  And I spread the feast for eagles.\r\n                  Stone and lime, well bound together,\r\n                  Now before me fall asunder.\r\n\r\nThen Sigmund Ongul sang:\r\n\r\n                 When, in spring-time, o’er the waters\r\n                 Ye go homeward to the Orkneys,\r\n                 Tell the lady whom I most love—\r\n                 Lady of the splendid garments—\r\n                 That, beneath the castle ramparts,\r\n                 There was none who stepped more boldly\r\n                 ’Mong the young men than her lover.\r\n\r\nThen the Earl and Sigmund prepared to force their way into the castle,\r\nand meeting with little resistance, they entered it, and many were\r\nkilled; but those that surrendered to the Earl received quarter. They\r\nobtained a great deal of property, but did not find the chief, and\r\nalmost no treasure. There was a great discussion about the escape of\r\nGudifrey, and how he had effected it; and they soon suspected Eindridi\r\nUngi that he had given him the means of escaping, and that he had\r\nfollowed the smoke, and thus gained the forest.\r\n\r\nAfter this Earl Rögnvald and his men stayed a short time in Galicialand,\r\nand directed their course along the west of Spain. They plundered far\r\nand wide in heathen Spainland,[378] and obtained great booty. They went\r\ninto a certain village, but the villagers ran together and offered\r\nfight. They made a stout resistance, but fled at last, when many of them\r\nhad been killed. The Earl sang:\r\n\r\n                 When in Spainland I went fighting,\r\n                 Quickly we o’erthrew the foemen,\r\n                 For, when tired of our hard hewing,\r\n                 Home they ran to see their sweethearts:\r\n                 All the land was strewed with corpses.\r\n                 Our deeds in song shall now be famous;\r\n                 And my hope is, to be worthy\r\n                 Of the lovely Ermingerda.\r\n\r\nThen they sailed along the west of Spain, and were overtaken by a gale.\r\nThere they lay at anchor three days, and great waves broke over them, so\r\nthat the vessels nearly foundered. Then the Earl sang:\r\n\r\n                 Here I’m storm-tossed, but undaunted,\r\n                 While the cables hold together,\r\n                 And the tackle of the vessel\r\n                 Breaks not, as she breasts the billows;\r\n                 I am promised to the fair one\r\n                 Whom we left out in the North-land;\r\n                 Now again there comes a fair wind;\r\n                 Speed we on into the channel.\r\n\r\nThen they set sail, and ran into Njörfasund[379] with a fair wind, and\r\nOddi sang:\r\n\r\n                 When the faithful friend of heroes,\r\n                 In the guest-hall sweet mead quaffing,\r\n                 Sat beside the fair ring-giver,\r\n                 That was a week to be remembered.\r\n                 Now the splendid steeds of billows\r\n                 Bear the noble-minded Rögnvald\r\n                 And his warriors, wearing bucklers,\r\n                 Quickly through the Sound of Njörfi.\r\n\r\nWhen they were tacking into the Sound, the Earl sang:\r\n\r\n                   By an east wind, breathing softly,\r\n                   As from lips of Valland lady,\r\n                   Are our ships now wafted onward,\r\n                   As we push the yards out farther;\r\n                   Though we had to tie the canvas\r\n                   Tighter than we had expected\r\n                   To the middle of the sailyard,\r\n                   South off Spain—we bear away now.\r\n\r\nThey sailed through Njörfasund, and then the gale began to abate; and\r\nwhen they had cleared the Sound, Eindridi Ungi parted from the Earl with\r\nsix ships, and sailed across the sea to Marselia (Marseilles), but Earl\r\nRögnvald and his men remained at the Sound. It was said that Eindridi\r\nnow himself proved that he had allowed Gudifrey to escape. The Earl’s\r\nmen sailed out to sea, and stood southwards to Serkland.[380] Then Earl\r\nRögnvald sang:\r\n\r\n                 Now our good ship, land forsaking,\r\n                 Laves her breast in limpid waters.\r\n                 Long ere he who sings these verses,\r\n                 Sees again the northern islands;\r\n                 With the sharp prow I the yielding\r\n                 Earth-surrounding sea am carving,\r\n                 Far off Spain-land, sweeping southward.\r\n\r\nMore is not said of the Earl’s progress till they came south off\r\nSerkland, and lay near Sardinia, not knowing where the land was. It was\r\nvery calm, and a thick fog spread over the water, so that they could\r\nhardly see anything from the ships, and they sailed therefore slowly.\r\nOne morning the mist disappeared, and the crew arose and looked around\r\nand saw two islets. When they looked for them the second time, there was\r\nbut one islet. This they told to the Earl. Then he said: “This cannot\r\nhave been islets which you have seen; it must be ships such as they have\r\nin this part of the world, and which they call Drómundar.[381] From a\r\ndistance they look as big as holms. But where the other Drómund lay, a\r\npuff of wind has probably swept over the water, and she has sailed away;\r\nbut they are likely some rovers.”\r\n\r\nThen he summoned the Bishop and all the ship-commanders, and said: “I\r\nask of you my Lord Bishop, and Erling my kinsman, whether you see any\r\nchance or device by which we may overcome those in the Drómund.”\r\n\r\nThe Bishop replied: “I think you will find it difficult to attack the\r\nDrómund in your long-ships, for you will hardly be able to reach their\r\nbulwarks with a boarding-pike, and they have probably brimstone and\r\nboiling pitch to pour under your feet and over your heads. You may see,\r\nEarl Rögnvald, wise as you are, that it would be the greatest rashness\r\nto place yourself and your men in such jeopardy.”\r\n\r\nThen Erling said: “My Lord Bishop, it may be that you are right in\r\nthinking that we shall not obtain the victory by rowing at them; yet I\r\ncannot help thinking that if we try to push close to the Drómund, their\r\nmissiles will fall beyond our ships lying close alongside; but if this\r\nbe not the case, we can push away quickly, for they will not be able to\r\nchase us in the Drómund.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl said: “That is bravely spoken, and very much to my own mind. I\r\nwill now make it known to the ships’ commanders and all the men, that\r\nevery one may arm and prepare himself, each in his own place, as well as\r\nhe can. Then let us attack them, and if they are Christian merchants, we\r\ncan make peace with them; but if they are heathens, which I think they\r\nare, by the favour of Almighty God we shall be able to overcome them,\r\nbut of the booty we obtain we shall give every fiftieth penny to the\r\npoor.”\r\n\r\nThen they unfastened their arms, prepared the bulwarks of their ships\r\nfor battle, and made themselves ready in other ways as their\r\ncircumstances permitted. The Earl assigned to each vessel its place in\r\nthe attack; then they pulled vigorously onwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXXII\r\n\r\n                     RÖGNVALD CONQUERS THE DRÓMUND.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN the men in the Drómund saw the ships pulling towards them, to\r\nattack them, they spread fine clothing and costly stuffs out on the\r\nbulwarks, and made a great shouting, which the Earl’s men took as a\r\nchallenge. Earl Rögnvald brought his ship close under the stem of the\r\nDrómund, on the starboard side. Erling did the same on the larboard\r\nside. Jón and Aslák brought theirs under her bows, and the others\r\namidships on either side, all sticking as close to her as possible. But\r\nwhen they came close under the Drómund, she was so high in the side that\r\nthe Northmen were unable to use their weapons, and the others poured\r\nblazing brimstone and burning pitch over them; but most of it fell\r\noutside the ships, as Erling had foreseen, and they had no need to\r\nshield themselves from it. However, when the attack did not succeed, the\r\nBishop moved away his ship and two others, and they told off their\r\nbowmen to go in them. After having got to a convenient distance for\r\nshooting, they shot their arrows into the Drómund, and this was the most\r\neffective mode of attack. The men in the Drómund protected themselves\r\nwith their shields, and paid little heed to what those were doing who\r\nwere in the ships close under the Drómund.\r\n\r\nEarl Rögnvald then ordered his men to take their axes, and cut the\r\nplanks of the Drómund, where the iron fastenings were fewest; and when\r\nthe men in the other ships saw what the Earl’s men were doing, they did\r\nthe same. Now, where Erling had stationed himself, there was a large\r\nanchor hanging from the Drómund, which had its fluke hooked over the\r\ngunwale, but the shank hung down towards Erling’s ship. One of his\r\nforecastle men was named Andun Raudi (red); he was lifted up on the\r\nanchor-stock, and then he pulled up others. Standing there as close as\r\nthey could, they hacked away at the planks with all their might; and\r\nthis was far higher than the others could reach. When they had made an\r\nopening large enough to admit them, they prepared to board the Drómund.\r\nThe Earl and his men entered on the lower deck, and Erling and his men\r\non the upper; and when they both got in, there began to be severe\r\nfighting. Those in the Drómund were Saracens, whom we call Mahometan\r\ninfidels. There were also many black men, who withstood them most\r\nfiercely. Erling received a severe wound in the neck, near the shoulder,\r\nwhen he jumped on board; it healed so badly that he carried his head to\r\na side ever after, and therefore he was called crick-neck (Skakki).\r\n\r\nWhen Earl Rögnvald and Erling joined each other, the Saracens were\r\ndriven to the forepart of the ship; and the Earl’s men boarded one after\r\nanother until they were more numerous, and then they pressed the enemy\r\nhard. In the Drómund they saw one man far superior to the others in\r\nappearance and stature, and they were persuaded that he must be their\r\nchief. Earl Rögnvald ordered his men not to wound him, if they could\r\nseize him in any other way. Then they surrounded him, and pressed him\r\nwith their shields, and thus caught him. He and a few others with him\r\nwere sent to the Bishop’s ship. All the rest they killed, and obtained\r\ngreat booty and many precious things. When they had finished the hardest\r\npart of their work, they sat down and rested, and the Earl sang:\r\n\r\n               At the spreading of the banner,\r\n               Erling, mighty tree of battle,\r\n               Went to victory and honour\r\n               Foremost when we fought the Drómund;\r\n               Then we felled the black-skinned fighters;\r\n               Everywhere the blood ran streaming,\r\n               And the keen-edged swords were reddened\r\n               As we hewed among the heathen.\r\n\r\n               We have had our fill of slaughter,\r\n               Round us lie the heaps of corpses;\r\n               Gory swords have been red-painting\r\n               At the Drómund all this morning;\r\n               Soon the news will spread to northward\r\n               Of this furious sword-tempest;\r\n               It will soon be known at Verbon,\r\n               How we dealt death-blows this morning.\r\n\r\nThere was much talk about what had been done; every one told what he had\r\nseen. Then they talked of who had been the first to board, but were not\r\nall of one opinion. Some said it would not be creditable to them if they\r\ndid not all relate this great exploit in the same way. At last they all\r\nagreed to let Earl Rögnvald decide, and every one should afterwards tell\r\nthe story in the same way as he did. Then the Earl sang:\r\n\r\n                Audun Raudi was the man who\r\n                First, with energy and valour,\r\n                Scaled the black sides of the Drómund;\r\n                Soon the brave one seized his booty.\r\n                By the help of God’s good favour\r\n                Have we overcome the heathen;\r\n                Steeped our swords are all in red blood;\r\n                Round us lie the sable corpses.\r\n\r\nWhen they had cleared the Drómund, they set it on fire. When the big man\r\nwhom they had taken prisoner saw this, he changed colour and became\r\npale, and could not keep himself still. But though they tried to make\r\nhim speak, he did not say a word, neither did he make any kind of sign;\r\nhe was immovable to fair promises and menaces alike. But when the\r\nDrómund began to blaze up, they saw a glowing stream, as it were, run\r\ninto the sea. At this the captive man was greatly moved. They concluded\r\nthat they had not made a careful search for the money, and now the\r\nmetal, whether gold or silver, had melted in the fire.\r\n\r\nThen Earl Rögnvald and his men sailed south, under Serkland, and lay off\r\na certain town of Serkland, and had seven nights’ truce with the men of\r\nthe town, and sold them silver and other valuables. No one would buy the\r\nbig man; and then the Earl gave him leave to go away with four men. He\r\ncame back on the morning after, with his men, and told them that he was\r\na nobleman of Serkland, and that he had been ransomed from there with\r\nthe Drómund and all its contents. “It grieved me most,” he said, “that\r\nyou should burn it, and thus destroy so much treasure, without any one’s\r\nhaving the benefit of it. Now you are in my power, but it counts for\r\nyour benefit with me that you spared my life, and did me such honour as\r\nyou could. But I would gladly never see you again, and now may you live\r\nhale and well.” Then he rode away into the country.\r\n\r\nEarl Rögnvald sailed to Crete, and anchored in a strong gale. When Armod\r\nkept watch during the night, he sang:\r\n\r\n                   Lie we now, where stormy billows\r\n                   Break above the sturdy bulwarks;\r\n                   My lot is to keep the watch well,\r\n                   On this wave-surmounting seahorse;\r\n                   While the lads are snugly sleeping,\r\n                   I, to Crete, look o’er my shoulder.\r\n\r\nThey lay off Crete until they had fair wind to Jórsalir (Jerusalem), and\r\narrived early on a Friday morning at Akursborg (Acre). They went on\r\nshore with great pomp and splendour, such as seldom had been seen there.\r\nThorbiörn Svarti sang:\r\n\r\n                    Oft have I, with comrades hardy,\r\n                    Been in battle, in the Orkneys,\r\n                    When the feeder of the people\r\n                    Led his forces to the combat.\r\n                    Now our trusty Earl we follow,\r\n                    As we carry up our bucklers\r\n                    Gaily to the gates of Acre\r\n                    On this joyful Friday morning.\r\n\r\nThey stayed in Akursborg for a while, and a disease broke out among\r\ntheir men, of which many died. Thorbiörn Svarti died there. Oddi Litli\r\nsang:\r\n\r\n               Bravely bore the Baron’s vessels\r\n               Thorbiörn Svarti, scald and comrade,\r\n               As he trod the sea-king’s highway,\r\n               Round by Thrasness, south to Acre.\r\n               There I saw them heap the grave-mould\r\n               Of the High Church o’er the King’s friend.\r\n               Earth and stones now lies he under\r\n               In that southern land of sunshine.\r\n\r\nEarl Rögnvald and his men left Akursborg, and visited all the holiest\r\nplaces of Jorsalaland. They went all to Jordan and bathed. Earl Rögnvald\r\nand Sigmund Ongul swam across the river, and went to some shrubs and\r\ntied large knots.[382] The Earl sang:\r\n\r\n                 Long the way is I have travelled\r\n                 To this heath, enclosed by deserts,\r\n                 And the wise maid will remember,\r\n                 Too, my crossing over Jordan.\r\n                 Seems to me, that those who tarry\r\n                 At their homesteads, will not find it\r\n                 A short journey here to travel.\r\n                 Warm the blood falls on the wide plain.\r\n\r\nThen Sigmund sang:\r\n\r\n                  This day I have tied a strong knot\r\n                  For the churlish clown that’s sitting\r\n                  By the home-hearth; ’tis no falsehood\r\n                  That we play him now a fine trick.\r\n\r\nThe Earl sang:\r\n\r\n                  On this feast-day of St. Lawrence,\r\n                  Tie we knots for this fine fellow.\r\n                  Tired I came to this nice corner,\r\n                  Where the shrubs grow close together.\r\n\r\nAnd when they were going from Jorsalaland Earl Rögnvald sang:\r\n\r\n               From the scald’s neck hangs the cross now,\r\n               In his hand a palm he carries.\r\n               Now should cease unkindly feelings:\r\n               From the heights my men rush downwards.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer Earl Rögnvald and his men left Jorsalaland, and were\r\ngoing to Mikligard. In the autumn they came to a town called\r\nImbolum,[383] and stayed there a long time. When two persons met where\r\nthe street was crowded, and one of them thought it necessary to go to\r\none side, he cried out to the other, “Midway, midway!” One evening the\r\nEarl’s men, among whom was Erling Skakki, walked from the town, and on\r\nthe bridge leading to the ship, some inhabitants of the town met them,\r\nand cried out, “Midway, midway!” Erling was very drunk, and pretended\r\nnot to hear it; and when they met, he jumped from the bridge into the\r\nmud; his men ran to his assistance, and dragged him out, and had to\r\nundress him completely. Next morning, when the Earl saw him, and was\r\ntold what had happened, he smiled and sang:\r\n\r\n                  Bad the luck my friend has met with;\r\n                  In the mud he tumbled, splashing;\r\n                  As he would not cry out “Midway!”\r\n                  Loudly, like the foreign people.\r\n                  I suppose the prince’s brother,\r\n                  When upset, looked rather rueful.\r\n                  Black the mud that on the ground is\r\n                  In Imbol, as Erling knoweth.\r\n\r\nSome time after, it happened that they came from the town very drunk,\r\nand Jón Fót was missed by his men, and no one else was missing. They\r\nsent immediately to the other ships to search for him, but he was not\r\nfound. They could not search for him on shore during the night; but in\r\nthe morning, when it was daylight, they found him murdered under the\r\nwall of the town; but it was never known who had slain him. They buried\r\nhim honourably at a holy church, and then they went away, and came north\r\nto Ægisness,[384] and there they waited some nights for a fair wind to\r\nsail to Mikligard. They made their ships look splendidly, and sailed\r\nwith great pomp, as they knew Sigurd Jorsalafari had done. While they\r\nwere crossing the sea northward the Earl sang this song:\r\n\r\n                  Let us ride the sea-king’s horses,\r\n                  Leave the plough in field untouched.\r\n                  As we drive the wet prows onward\r\n                  All the way to Mikligard.\r\n                  There we’ll take the royal bounty,\r\n                  Paid for wielding well our weapons,\r\n                  While we fill the wolf’s red palate,\r\n                  And on battlefields win honour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER LXXXIII.\r\n\r\n                           OF EARL RÖGNVALD.\r\n\r\n\r\nRÖGNVALD and his men came to Mikligard, and were well received by the\r\nEmperor and the Væringiar.[385] At this time Menelaus, whom we call\r\nManuli,[386] was the Emperor of Mikligard. He gave them a great deal of\r\nmoney, and offered them pay if they would stay there permanently. They\r\nspent there a great part of the winter. Eindridi Ungi was there when\r\nthey came, and was highly honoured by the Emperor. He had little to do\r\nwith the Earl and his men, but rather spoke slightingly of them to\r\nothers. Rögnvald commenced his journey from Mikligard during the winter,\r\nand went first to Dýraksborg[387] in Bólgaraland. From there they sailed\r\nwest to Púll.[388] Earl Rögnvald, Erling, Bishop William, and most\r\nothers of their noblest men left their ships there, procured horses, and\r\nrode first to Rómaborg (Rome), and then from Róm until they came to\r\nDenmark. From there they went to Norway, where the people were glad to\r\nsee them. This journey became very famous, and all those who had made it\r\nwere considered greater men afterwards than before.\r\n\r\nOgmund Dreng, Erling Skakki’s brother, had died while they were away;\r\nwhile both were alive, he was considered the greater of the two. After\r\nthe death of King Ingi, Magnus, the son of Erling and Kristín, the\r\ndaughter of Sigurd Jorsalafari, was made King, but the government of\r\nNorway was in the hands of Erling alone. Valdimar, King of the Danes,\r\ngave him the title of Earl, and he became a great chief. Eindridi came\r\nfrom the south some winters after Earl Rögnvald, and went to King\r\nEystein, because he would not have anything to do with Erling. But after\r\nKing Eystein’s death Eindridi and Sigurd, the son of Hávard Höld of\r\nReyr, raised a party, and made Hákon Herdabreid,[389] the son of King\r\nSigurd, son of Harald Gilli, their king. They slew Gregorius Dag’s son\r\nand King Ingi. Eindridi and Hákon fought with Erling, under Sekkr,[390]\r\nwhere Hákon was killed; but Eindridi fled. Earl Erling had Eindridi Ungi\r\nkilled some time after in Vik.[391]\r\n\r\nEarl Rögnvald spent the summer in Hördaland, in Norway, and heard many\r\ntidings from the Orkneys. There were great disturbances there, and most\r\nof the chiefs were divided into two factions, few remaining neutral.\r\nEarl Harald was at the head of one of these factions, and Earl Erlend\r\nand Swein, Asleif’s son, of the other. When the Earl heard this, he\r\nsang:\r\n\r\n                   Though the most part of my nobles\r\n                   Have forgot the oaths they sware me\r\n                   (Such the wickedness of men is),\r\n                   Yet will their designs be thwarted.\r\n                   Traitors plotting in my absence,\r\n                   Will not by it grow more loyal;\r\n                   Slow but sure shall be my motto\r\n                   While a beard on chin I carry.\r\n\r\nThe Earl had no ships, but he asked his kinsmen and friends to build\r\nsome long-ships for him during the winter. They gave a favourable\r\nanswer, and consented to everything he proposed, and built the ships.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXXIV\r\n\r\n                   EARL RÖGNVALD GOES TO THE ORKNEYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the summer the Earl made himself ready to go west to his dominions in\r\nthe Orkneys, but it was late before he was ready, because many things\r\nkept him back. He went to the west in a merchant-vessel belonging to\r\nThórhall, Asgrím’s son, an Icelander of a noble family, who had a farm\r\nsouth in Biskupstungur.[392] The Earl had a numerous train of noblemen\r\non board the vessel. When they came to Scotland the winter was far\r\nadvanced, and they lay at Torfnes.[393] The Earl arrived in his\r\ndominions shortly before Yule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXXV\r\n\r\n                KING EYSTEIN TAKES EARL HARALD PRISONER.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW we have to tell what happened in the Orkneys while Earl Rögnvald was\r\naway. The same summer that the Earl went on his journey, King Eystein,\r\nson of Harald Gilli, arrived from Norway with a numerous army, which he\r\nhad landed at Rínarsey.[394] He heard that Earl Harald had gone over to\r\nCaithness in a ship of twenty benches, with eighty men, and lay then at\r\nThórsá. When King Eystein heard of him, he manned three boats, and\r\ncrossed the Pentland Firth, going westward, and on to Thórsá. When he\r\narrived there the Earl and his men did not know anything of them until\r\nthe King’s men boarded the ship, and took the Earl prisoner. He was\r\nbrought before the King, and the result was that the Earl ransomed\r\nhimself with three marks of gold, and surrendered his dominions to King\r\nEystein, so that he should hold them from him in the future. Then he\r\nbecame King Eystein’s man, and confirmed their compact with oaths. From\r\nthere King Eystein went to Scotland, and ravaged there during the\r\nsummer. During this expedition he plundered in many parts of England,\r\nconsidering that he was taking revenge for King Harald, Sigurd’s\r\nson.[395]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXXVI\r\n\r\n                            OF KING EYSTEIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEN King Eystein returned to his kingdom, and his expedition was\r\nvariously thought of. Earl Harald remained in his dominions in the\r\nOrkneys, and most of the inhabitants were satisfied with his rule. At\r\nthis time his father, Earl Maddad, was dead; but his mother, Margarét,\r\nhad gone to the Orkneys. She was a handsome woman,[396] but a virago. At\r\nthis time David, the King of Scots, died, and his son Malcolm[397] was\r\nmade king. He was quite a child when he succeeded his father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER LXXXVII.\r\n\r\n                            OF EARL HARALD.\r\n\r\n\r\nERLEND, the son of Harald Sléttmáli, spent most of his time in Thórsá.\r\nSometimes he was in the Sudreyar, or on war expeditions, after the death\r\nof Earl Ottar. He was a very promising man, and accomplished in most\r\nthings, liberal in money, gentle, open to advice, and greatly loved by\r\nhis men. He had a large following.\r\n\r\nThere was a man named Anakol, who had fostered Erlend, and to his\r\ncounsels he chiefly listened. He was of a noble family, and hardy. He\r\nwas Earl Erlend’s right-hand man.\r\n\r\nWhen Earl Rögnvald had left his dominions to go to Jórsalaheim, Erlend\r\nwent to Malcolm,[398] the King of Scots, and requested him to give him\r\nan Earl’s title, and Caithness for his support, as his father Earl\r\nErlend had. And because Erlend had many friends, and Malcolm was a child\r\nin years, it was brought about that he bestowed the title of Earl on\r\nErlend, and gave him the half of Caithness jointly with his kinsman\r\nHarald. Then Erlend went to Caithness to see his friends.\r\n\r\nAfter that he gathered troops together, went out to the Orkneys, and\r\nsought to be accepted by the inhabitants. When Earl Harald, Maddad’s\r\nson, heard this, he gathered troops together, and had many men. Some\r\nparties went between the kinsmen and tried to make peace between them.\r\nErlend asked for half of the Islands jointly with Earl Harald, but Earl\r\nHarald refused to give them up. Truce was, however, made between them\r\nfor that year; and it was resolved that Erlend should go to the east and\r\nsee the King of Norway, and ask for that half which belonged to Earl\r\nRögnvald, which Earl Harald said he would surrender. Then Erlend went\r\neast to Norway, but Anakol and some of his party remained behind.\r\n\r\nGunni, Olaf’s son, the brother of Swein, Asleif’s son, had children by\r\nMargarét, Earl Harald’s mother, but Earl Harald had banished him, and\r\ntherefore enmity arose between him and Swein. The latter sent his\r\nbrother Gunni south to Liódhús (Lewis) to his friend Liótólf, with whom\r\nhe had been staying himself. Fugl, the son of Liótólf, was with Earl\r\nHarald, and there was therefore coldness between him and Swein. When\r\nEarl Erlend went east to Norway, Earl Harald went over to Caithness, and\r\nresided at Vík (Wick) during the winter. Swein, Asleif’s son, was then\r\nat Thrasvík (Freswick), in Caithness, and took care of the estate which\r\nhis stepsons had there, for his former wife was Ragnhild, Ingimund’s\r\ndaughter, though they lived but a short time together. Their son was\r\nOlaf. After that he married Ingirid, Thorkel’s daughter. Their son was\r\nAndreas.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday in Passion week Swein went with some others to Lambaborg.\r\nThey saw a transport vessel coming from the north across the Pentland\r\nFirth, and Swein concluded that they were Earl Harald’s men whom he had\r\nsent to collect his revenues (scat) in Hjaltland. Swein ordered his men\r\nto take a boat and attack the barge, which they did. They seized all its\r\ncargo, and put Earl Harald’s men on shore, and they went to Vík (Wick)\r\nand told him. Earl Harald did not say much to this, yet he said: “Swein\r\nand I shall have our turns.” He distributed his men to be entertained\r\nduring Easter. The Caithnessmen called this—that the Earl was in\r\nguest-quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CHAPTER LXXXVIII.\r\n\r\n                        OF SWEIN, ASLEIF’S SON.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMMEDIATELY after Easter week, Swein, Asleif’s son, went with a barge\r\nand a boat rowed by oars to the Orkneys; and when they came to Skálpeid\r\n(Scapa), they took there a ship from Fugl, Liótólf’s son. He was coming\r\nfrom his father at Liódhús (Lewis), and was going to Earl Harald. During\r\nthe same trip they took twelve ounces of gold from Sigurd Klaufi, a\r\nhousecarl of Earl Harald’s. This money had been left at the homestead,\r\nbut the owners were in Kirkiuvag (Kirkwall). Then Swein went over to\r\nNess (Caithness), and up through Scotland. He found Malcolm,[399] King\r\nof Scots, who was then nine winters old, in Apardion (Aberdeen). Swein\r\nspent a month there, and was well entertained. The King of Scots\r\ninsisted upon his enjoying all those emoluments of Caithness which he\r\nhad before he became Earl Harald’s enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER LXXXIX\r\n\r\n                          OF SWEIN AND ANAKOL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER this Swein prepared to go away, and the King of Scots and he\r\nparted very good friends. Then Swein went to his ships, and sailed from\r\nthe south to the Orkneys. Anakol was at Dýrness when Swein sailed from\r\nthe south, and they saw them sailing east off Múli.[400] They sent\r\nGauti, a bondi of Skeggbjarnarstadir,[401] to Swein, and Anakol\r\nrequested him to come to terms with Fugl about the seizure of the ship,\r\nbecause Anakol and Fugl were related to each other. When Gauti found\r\nSwein, and told him Anakol’s message, he sent a messenger back to\r\nAnakol, asking him to go to Sandey, that they might meet there, because\r\nhe (Swein) had to be there himself. They had a peaceful meeting there,\r\nand came to terms; and the result was that Swein should make the award\r\nas he liked himself. After that Anakol formed an alliance with Swein,\r\nand bound himself to make peace between Swein and Earl Erlend, when he\r\ncame from the east—for they were bitter enemies on account of the\r\nburning of Frákork. Swein and Anakol went to Striónsey, and lay off\r\nHofsness[402] some nights. At this time Thorfinn Bessason lived at\r\nStriónsey. His wife was Ingigerd, Swein’s sister, who had been deserted\r\nby Thorbiörn Klerk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XC\r\n\r\n              THE RECONCILIATION OF EARL ERLEND AND SWEIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Swein and Anakol were lying off Hofsness, Earl Erlend arrived there\r\nfrom Norway. Anakol and Thorfinn endeavoured to reconcile him to Swein,\r\nbut he gave an unfavourable answer, saying that Swein had always been\r\nopposed to his kinsmen, and had not kept the agreement between him and\r\nEarl Ottar, that he should help him to the dominion. Then Swein offered\r\nthe Earl his support, and they were negotiating the whole day; yet the\r\nEarl would not be reconciled until Anakol and Thorfinn declared that\r\nthey would follow Swein from Orkney if the Earl would not make peace\r\nwith him. Earl Erlend then told the message from King Eystein, that he\r\nshould have that part of the Orkneys which had formerly been held by\r\nEarl Harald.\r\n\r\nWhen they had made peace, Swein gave the advice that they should go to\r\nEarl Harald before he heard this from others, and ask him to surrender\r\nthe dominion. Swein’s advice was acted upon. They found Earl Harald on\r\nboard his ship, off Kjárekstadir.[403]\r\n\r\nIt was in the evening of Michaelsmas that Harald and his men saw\r\nlong-ships approaching, and suspecting them to be enemies, they ran from\r\nthe ships into the castle. There was a man named Arni, Rafn’s son, who\r\nran from Earl Harald’s ship to Kirkiuvag. He was so frightened that he\r\nforgot that he had his shield at his shoulder until it stuck fast in the\r\ndoor. Earl Erlend and Swein ran from their ships, and pursued Earl\r\nHarald to the castle, and attacked them both with arms and fire. The\r\nassailed defended themselves bravely, until night parted them. Many were\r\nwounded on both sides, and Harald and his men would soon have been\r\nexhausted if the attack had lasted longer. The next morning the Bœndr\r\nand their mutual friends arrived, and tried to make peace between them.\r\nEarl Erlend and Swein were very reluctant to make peace. In the end,\r\nhowever, they agreed, on condition that Harald should swear to let Earl\r\nErlend have his part of the Islands, and never demand it from him. These\r\noaths were made in the presence of the best men in the Islands.\r\n\r\nAfter that Earl Harald went over to Ness (Caithness), and to his friends\r\nin Scotland, accompanied by only a few men from the Orkneys.\r\n\r\nEarl Erlend and Swein called together a Thing-meeting with the Bœndr in\r\nKirkiuvag, and they arrived from all the Islands. Earl Erlend pleaded\r\nhis cause, saying that King Eystein had given him that part of the\r\nOrkneys of which Earl Harald had charge, and he requested the Bœndr to\r\nreceive him, showing them King Eystein’s letters, which proved his\r\nwords. Swein, and many others of his friends and kinsmen, spoke in\r\nfavour of the Earl; and at last the Bœndr promised obedience to Earl\r\nErlend. Then he took possession of all the islands, and became ruler\r\nover them. It was an agreement between Earl Erlend and the Bœndr that he\r\nshould not hinder Earl Rögnvald from taking possession of that part of\r\nthe islands which belonged to him, if it should be granted him to come\r\nback; but if Earl Rögnvald should demand more than one-half of the\r\nislands, they should help Earl Erlend to resist his claims. Swein,\r\nAsleif’s son, was frequently with Earl Erlend, and asked him to be on\r\nhis guard, and not to trust Earl Harald or the Scots. The most part of\r\nthe winter they were on board their ships, and had scouts on the\r\nlook-out. Towards Yule-tide the weather began to grow boisterous, and\r\nSwein went home to his estate in Gáreksey, and asked the Earl not to\r\nrelax his vigilance though they parted, and the Earl did so. He remained\r\non board his ships, and had nowhere a Yule feast prepared for him in the\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XCI\r\n\r\n             EARL HARALD COMES UNPERCEIVED TO THE ORKNEYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE eleventh day of Yule-tide, it happened in Gáreksey that Swein was\r\nsitting at his drink with his men. Rubbing his nose, he said: “I think\r\nEarl Harald is now on his way to the Islands.”\r\n\r\nHis men replied that this was unlikely, on account of the strong gales\r\nprevailing at that time.\r\n\r\nHe replied: “I know such is your opinion, and I shall not therefore send\r\nintelligence to the Earl now, merely on the strength of my presentiment;\r\nyet I suspect it is necessary.” Then the subject was dropped, and they\r\nwent on drinking as before.\r\n\r\nEarl Harald commenced his voyage to the Orkneys during Yule-tide. He had\r\nfour ships, and a hundred men. Two nights he lay under Gáreksey\r\n(Grimsey?). They landed in Hafnarvag,[404] in Hrossey, and the\r\nthirteenth day of Yule-tide they walked to Fiörd (Firth). They spent the\r\nYule-holiday at Orkahaug.[405] There two of their men were seized with\r\nmadness, which retarded their journey. It was near day when they came to\r\nFiörd (Firth). There they learned that Earl Erlend was on board his\r\nship, but that he had been drinking during that day at a house on shore.\r\nThere Harald and his men killed two men—one was named Ketill, the name\r\nof the other is not mentioned—and made four prisoners: Arnfinn, Anakol’s\r\nbrother, another man called Liótólf, and two others. Harald and\r\nThorbiörn Klerk returned to Thórsá; the brothers Benedict and Eirík went\r\nto Lambaborg, taking Arnfinn with them.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Earl Erlend became aware of the enemy, he sent men during the\r\nnight to Gáreksey to tell Swein. He pushed out his boats immediately,\r\nand went to see Earl Erlend, according to the message, and they stayed\r\non board the ships a great part of the winter. Benedict and his brother\r\nsent word that Arnfinn would not be liberated unless Earl Erlend sent\r\nthem back their ship which had been seized off Kjárekstadir. The Earl\r\nwas willing to give up the ship, but Anakol dissuaded him from it,\r\nsaying that Arnfinn would get away without this sacrifice.\r\n\r\nOn the Wednesday before Lent, Anakol and Thorstein, Ragna’s son, went\r\nover by night to Ness (Caithness) in a boat with twenty men. They hauled\r\nthe boat ashore under a cliff in a hidden creek. Then they went up and\r\nhid themselves in some copsewood a short distance from Thrasvík\r\n(Freswick). They had fitted up the boat in such a way that the men\r\nseemed to be each in his place. Some men had come past the boat in the\r\nmorning, and had not suspected anything.\r\n\r\nAnakol and his men saw some men rowing from the borg[406] and landing at\r\nthe river-mouth.[407] Then they saw a man riding from the borg, and\r\nanother walking, whom they recognised to be Eirík. Then they divided\r\nthemselves into two parties. Ten went along the river down to the sea,\r\nto prevent them from getting to the boat; other ten went to the hamlet.\r\nEirík came a short time before them to the hamlet, and walked towards\r\nthe drinking-hall. Then he heard armed men moving about, and ran into\r\nthe hall, and out through another door, and down to his boat; but there\r\nhe came upon men who seized him, and brought him out to the Islands to\r\nEarl Erlend. Then messengers were sent to Earl Harald to tell him that\r\nEirík would not be liberated until Arnfinn and his companions came safe\r\nto Erlend. And the wishes of both were complied with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XCII\r\n\r\n           THE RECONCILIATION OF THE EARLS HARALD AND ERLEND.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the spring Earl Harald prepared to go from Caithness north to\r\nHjaltland. His intention was to take the life of Erlend Ungi, who had\r\nwooed his mother Margarét, although the Earl (Harald) had refused him.\r\nThen Erlend gathered men together, and carried her off from the Orkneys,\r\nand took her north to Hjaltland, took up his residence in\r\nMoseyarborg,[408] and made great preparations (for defence). When the\r\nEarl (Harald) came to Hjaltland, he besieged the borg, and cut off all\r\ncommunication; but it was difficult to take it by assault, and men went\r\nbetween them and tried to reconcile them. Erlend asked the Earl to give\r\nhim the woman in marriage, and in return he offered to assist the Earl,\r\nsaying it was of greater consequence for him to recover his dominions\r\nthan this, and it would be advisable for him to make as many friends as\r\nhe could. Many spoke in favour of Erlend’s proposal; and the result was\r\nthat they made peace, and Erlend married Margarét. Then he became an\r\nally of Earl Harald, and during the summer they both went east to\r\nNorway.\r\n\r\nWhen these tidings came to Orkney, Earl Erlend and his men laid their\r\nplans. Swein counselled to go on a harrying raid to obtain booty. This\r\nthey did, and went south to Breidafiord,[409] and made inroads on the\r\neast of Scotland. They went south to Beruvík (Berwick-on-Tweed). There\r\nwas a man named Knút the wealthy, who was a merchant, and always resided\r\nin Beruvík. Swein and Erlend seized a large and fine vessel belonging to\r\nKnút. On board was a valuable cargo, and Knút’s wife. Then they sailed\r\nsouth to Bl['y]hólmar.[410] Knút was at Beruvík when he heard of the\r\nplunder. He induced the Beruvík men for a hundred marks of silver to try\r\nto recover the goods. Of those who went in pursuit most were merchants.\r\nThey went in fourteen ships to search for them. When Earl Erlend and\r\nSwein were lying under Bl['y]hólmar, Swein said in the night that they\r\nshould sleep without awnings, saying that he expected that the Beruvík\r\nmen might come upon them during the night in great numbers. A gale was\r\nblowing, and no heed was paid to Swein’s words, and they slept under the\r\nawnings, except in Swein’s ship, where there was no awning abaft the\r\nmast. Swein was sitting on a chest in a fur coat, saying that he wished\r\nto be ready during the night.\r\n\r\nOne of Swein’s crew was called Einar Skeif. He said that Swein’s bravery\r\nwas much talked of, that he was called a bolder man than others, but now\r\nhe dared not have awnings on board his ship. Watchmen were on shore in\r\nthe island. Swein, hearing that they did not agree about what they saw,\r\nwent up to them and asked what they were disputing about? They said they\r\nwere not sure what it was that they saw. Swein had keener sight than any\r\nof his men, and when he looked he saw fourteen ships approaching them\r\nfrom the north. Then he went on board his ship again, and told his men\r\nto wake up and take down the awnings, and then a great outcry arose,\r\nevery one asking Swein what they should do. He told them to be silent,\r\nand said that his advice was to moor the ships between the island and\r\nthe mainland, adding: “We shall see whether they do not pass by us, and\r\nif they do we shall part; but if they attack us, we shall row against\r\nthem as vigorously as possible, and let us make a stout resistance if we\r\nmeet.”\r\n\r\nOthers spoke against this plan, saying the only way was to sail from\r\nthem, and so they did.\r\n\r\nSwein said: “If you wish to sail away, then stand out to sea.” Swein was\r\nnot so soon ready as the others, but Anakol waited for him. Swein’s ship\r\nwas, however, a swifter sailer, and he took in sail and waited for\r\nAnakol, not wishing him to be left behind in a single ship. When they\r\nstood off, with all sail set, Einar Skeif said: “Swein, does our ship\r\nstand still?”\r\n\r\nSwein replied: “I do not think so; but I advise you not to question my\r\ncourage any more, since through your fright you cannot tell whether the\r\nship moves or stands still, yet it is one of the swiftest sailers.”\r\n\r\nThey put in under Mosey,[411] and Swein sent men to Eidinaborg to tell\r\nthe King of Scots of his plunder; but before they came to the town they\r\nmet twelve men on horseback who had saddle-bags filled with silver, and\r\nwhen they met they inquired after Swein, Asleif’s son. The others told\r\nwhere he was, and asked what they wanted with him. The Scots said they\r\nhad been told that Swein was taken prisoner, and the King of Scots had\r\nsent them to ransom him. Thus they told their errand.\r\n\r\nThe King did not make much of Knút’s loss, but sent a costly shield to\r\nSwein, and other presents besides.\r\n\r\nEarl Erlend and Swein arrived rather late in the Orkneys in the autumn.\r\nThis summer Earl Harald went east to Norway. At the same time, Earl\r\nRögnvald and Erling Skakki came to Norway from Mikligard, and he arrived\r\nat his dominions in the Orkneys shortly before Yule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XCIII\r\n\r\n              PEACE BETWEEN EARL RÖGNVALD AND EARL ERLEND.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEN there went men immediately between Earl Erlend and Earl Rögnvald,\r\nand tried to make peace between them, the Bœndr pleading the agreement\r\nthey had come to with Earl Erlend, that he should not prevent Earl\r\nRögnvald from taking possession of his part of the Islands. A conference\r\ntook place between the Earls at Kirkiuvag (Kirkwall), and at that\r\nconference they confirmed their peace with oaths. It was two nights\r\nbefore Yule when they made peace, and the terms were, that they should\r\neach have one-half of the Islands, and both should defend them against\r\nEarl Harald or any other if he claimed them. Earl Rögnvald had no ships\r\ntill his own came from the east in the summer. This winter all was\r\nquiet, but in the spring the Earls prepared their plans in case Earl\r\nHarald should come from the east. Earl Erlend went to Hjaltland to\r\nintercept him if he should come there. Earl Rögnvald went over to\r\nThórsá, because Earl Harald was expected to go there if he came from the\r\neast, as he had there many friends and kinsmen. Earl Erlend and Swein\r\nwere in Hjaltland during the summer, and kept back all ships, so that\r\nnone went to Norway.\r\n\r\nIn summer Earl Harald left Norway with seven ships, and landed in the\r\nOrkneys. Three of the ships, however, were driven by stress of weather\r\nto Hjaltland, and these were seized by Swein and Earl Erlend. When Earl\r\nHarald came to the Orkneys he heard of the agreement of Earl Rögnvald\r\nand Earl Erlend, that each of them should have one-half of the Islands;\r\nand then he saw that no territory was intended for him. He resolved to\r\ngo over to Ness (Caithness) to Earl Rögnvald before Earl Erlend and\r\nSwein came from the east. They were in Hjaltland, when they heard that\r\nEarl Harald had arrived in the Orkneys with five long-ships, and\r\nprepared to go thither immediately. In Dynröst[412] they had strong\r\ncurrents and severe gales, and there they parted. Swein was driven back\r\nto Fridarey (Fair Isle), with twelve ships, and they thought the Earl\r\nhad perished. From Fridarey they went to Sandey, where they found Earl\r\nErlend with three ships. It was a joyful meeting for them. Then they\r\nwent to Hrossey (Mainland), and inquired about Earl Harald’s movements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XCIV\r\n\r\n                          PEACE IS TALKED OF.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW it is to be told that Earl Harald came to Thórsá with six ships.\r\nEarl Rögnvald was in Sutherland, at the wedding of his daughter Ingirid,\r\nwhom he married to Eirík Slagbrellir. He heard immediately that Earl\r\nHarald had arrived at Thórsá, and rode from Beruvík[413] to Thórsá,\r\nattended by many men. Eirík was related to Earl Harald; and with many\r\nothers he tried to make peace between them, saying that it was absurd\r\nfor them to be at enmity, because of their relationship, their\r\nup-bringing, and their long alliance. At last matters came so far that a\r\nmeeting was appointed, and truce made. They should meet in a certain\r\ncastle at Thórsá,[414] and talk together alone; but an equal number of\r\ntheir men should be outside the castle. They talked a long time, and\r\nagreed very well. They had not seen each other since Rögnvald returned.\r\nLate in the day information was given to Earl Rögnvald that Earl\r\nHarald’s men were coming there armed. Earl Harald said that no harm\r\nwould be done. Then they heard heavy blows outside, and ran out.\r\nThorbiörn Klerk had arrived there with a large party, and attacked\r\nRögnvald’s men immediately. The Earls called to them that they should\r\nnot fight. Then the inhabitants of the town came running to the spot to\r\nseparate them. Thirteen of Earl Rögnvald’s men were killed, and he\r\nhimself was wounded in the face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XCV\r\n\r\n                             SWEIN’S PLANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER this their friends made an effort to establish peace between them,\r\nand the result was that they made peace, which they confirmed by oaths.\r\nThey renewed their alliance, pledging their faith and shaking hands; and\r\nit was resolved that they should go that very night out to the Orkneys\r\nto attack Earl Erlend. They went out on the Pentland Firth with ten\r\nships, taking the course to Rínarsey.[415] They landed in Vidivag,[416]\r\nand went on shore. Erlend and his men lay on board their ships in\r\nBardvik,[417] and from there they saw a crowd on Rögnvaldsey, and sent\r\nout spies. When they heard of the reconciliation of the Earls, it was\r\nalso said that Earl Erlend would not be permitted to plunder on shore,\r\nor to obtain provisions in any other way; and their intention was to\r\nprevent them from getting any food in the island. Earl Erlend held a\r\nmeeting and consulted his men, and they agreed to leave it to Swein to\r\nsay what should be done. Swein replied that they should sail that very\r\nnight over to Caithness, saying that they had no strength to contend\r\nwith both the Earls there in the Islands. He gave out that they intended\r\nto go to the Sudreyar (Hebrides), and winter there.\r\n\r\nIt was Michaelmas-eve when they sailed out on the Firth, but when they\r\ncame over to Ness (Caithness), they ran up into the country, and drove\r\ndown a great number of cattle, which they brought on board their ships.\r\nThere were strong currents and bad weather, so that the Firth was\r\nfrequently impassable; but when favourable weather came, Swein sent a\r\nman in a boat from Ness, to give information that Earl Erlend had made a\r\ngreat strand-hewing[418] in Caithness, and was ready to sail to the\r\nSudreyar when there was a favourable wind. When this came to the ears of\r\nEarl Rögnvald, he called his men together and made a speech to them,\r\ntelling them to be on their guard, to be wary, and sleep every night on\r\nboard their ships; “For now,” he said, “Swein may be expected every hour\r\nin the Islands; the more certainly the more he talks of going away.”\r\n\r\nEarly in the winter Earl Erlend and Swein left Thórsá, and took their\r\ncourse by the west of Scotland. They had six large long-ships, all well\r\nmanned. They had to row, and when they had gone some distance from\r\nCaithness, Earl Rögnvald’s spies went out to the Islands, and told him\r\nthe news. Then the Earls moved their ships to Skálpeid (Scapa), and Earl\r\nRögnvald wished them to stay a while on board.\r\n\r\nWhen Swein and Erlend came west off Staur,[419] the former said that\r\nthey should not distress themselves by rowing any farther, and asked his\r\nmen to put the ships about and set the sails. This action on the part of\r\nSwein was thought foolish, yet his men did as he desired them. When they\r\nhad been sailing for a while the ships began to speed, because there was\r\na fine breeze, and nothing is said of their voyage until they came to\r\nVagaland,[420] in Orkney. There they heard that the Earls were lying at\r\nSkálpeid, off Knarrarstadir,[421] with thirteen ships. There were Erlend\r\nUngi, Eirík Slagbrellir, and many other men of note. Thorbiörn Klerk had\r\ngone out to Papuley,[422] to Hákon Karl, his brother-in-law. It was four\r\nnights before Simon’s-mas when Swein, Asleif’s son, decided to attack\r\nthe Earls during the night, but it was thought rather hazardous, as\r\ntheir followers were so much more numerous. Yet Swein insisted on having\r\nhis own way; and so he did, because the Earl wished to follow his\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XCVI\r\n\r\n                    BATTLE BETWEEN THE THREE EARLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDURING the night there fell a shower of sleet, and Earl Rögnvald left\r\nhis ship with six men, intending to go to his residence at Jórfiara\r\n(Orphir), because he expected no danger. During the shower they came to\r\nKnarrarstadir. An Icelander, by name Bótólf Begla, an excellent skald,\r\nlived there. He pressed Earl Rögnvald with many invitations to stay\r\nthere during the night. Earl Rögnvald and his men entered the house;\r\ntheir clothes were pulled off them, and they went to sleep; but Bótólf\r\nwas to keep watch. This same night Earl Erlend and Swein attacked Earl\r\nHarald and his men, and took them by surprise, and they knew of nothing\r\ntill they heard the battle-cry. They flew to arms, and defended\r\nthemselves bravely. Many were killed, and the attack ended in this\r\nway—that Earl Harald leaped on shore when there were only five men left\r\nin his ship. Bjarni, brother of Erlend Ungi, a noble man, fell there,\r\nand a hundred men with him; and a great number were wounded. All the\r\nEarl’s men jumped from the ships to reach the shore, and fled. Few of\r\nEarl Erlend’s men were killed, and they took fourteen ships belonging to\r\nthe Earls, with all the valuables they contained. When the most part of\r\ntheir work was done, they heard that Earl Rögnvald had left his ship the\r\nevening before, and walked first to Knarrarstadir, and thither they\r\nwent. Bondi Bótólf was outside the door when they came, and greeted them\r\nwell. They asked whether Earl Rögnvald was there. Bótólf said he had\r\nbeen there during the night. They became very violent, and demanded\r\nwhere the Earl was then, saying that he no doubt knew where he was. He\r\npointed with his hand behind the farm-yard, and sang:\r\n\r\n                 This way went the Prince a-fowling;\r\n                 Skilful are his men with arrows.\r\n                 Now is many a heathcock meeting\r\n                 Death beside the verdant hillocks,\r\n                 Where the elmbow of the hunter,\r\n                 Keenly bent, as if by magic,\r\n                 Makes the moorfowl quickly perish.\r\n                 The Prince’s sword the land defendeth.\r\n\r\nThe Earl’s men ran away from the homestead, and he who could run fastest\r\nconsidered himself luckiest, as he would be the first to catch Earl\r\nRögnvald. Bótólf went into the house, awoke the Earl, and told him what\r\nhad happened during the night, and also what the Earl’s men were doing.\r\nRögnvald and his men started up instantly, and put on their clothes;\r\nthen they went away to the Earl’s residence at Jórfiara; and when they\r\ncame there they found Earl Harald in hiding. The Earls [Harald and\r\nRögnvald] went immediately over to Ness each in a separate boat; one had\r\ntwo men, the other three. All their men went over to Ness, wherever they\r\ncould get a boat.\r\n\r\nEarl Erlend and Swein took the ships belonging to the Earl, and a great\r\nquantity of other property. Swein took for his share all Earl Rögnvald’s\r\ntreasures that were in his ship, and sent them to him over to Ness.\r\nSwein advised Earl Erlend to move his ships out to Vagaland (Walls), and\r\nto lie in the Firth, where they could see ships coming from Ness, as he\r\nthought it would be convenient to run out upon them if there was\r\nopportunity. But Earl Erlend yielded to the persuasions of his men that\r\nthey should go north to Daminsey (Damsey), and in a large castle there\r\nthey drank all day, but fastened the ships together every night, and\r\nslept on board. Thus time passed on till the Yule-feast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XCVII\r\n\r\n                          EARL ERLEND’S DEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE nights before Christmas, Swein, Asleif’s son, went east to\r\nSandvik,[423] to his kinswoman Sigríd, because he had to make peace\r\nbetween her and her neighbour by name Björn. Before he went away he told\r\nEarl Erlend to sleep on board by night, and not to be less on his guard\r\nthat he himself was absent. Swein spent one night with his kinswoman\r\nSigríd. A tenant and dear friend of Sigríd’s, by name Gisl, asked Swein\r\nto stay with him, as he had been brewing ale, and wished to entertain\r\nhim. When they came to Gisl they were told that Earl Erlend had not gone\r\non board that night; and as soon as Swein heard it, he sent Margad,\r\nGrim’s son, and two other men to the Earl, and asked him to pay heed to\r\nhis advice, although he had not done so the preceding night, and then he\r\nadded: “I suspect that I shall not have long to provide for this Earl.”\r\n\r\nMargad and his companions found Earl Erlend, and told him Swein’s words.\r\nThe Earl’s men said: “He is a strange man; sometimes he is afraid of\r\nnothing, at other times he is so frightened that he does not know where\r\nto look for shelter to himself or others.” They said they would sleep\r\nquietly on shore, and not go on board. The Earl said they should do as\r\nSwein advised them, and he went on board with four-and-twenty men; the\r\nothers slept at a house. Margad went to another creek, not far away.\r\nThis very night the Earls Rögnvald and Harald surprised Earl Erlend, and\r\nneither the watchmen who kept guard on the island nor those on board the\r\nship perceived them until they were climbing on board. A man named Orm\r\nand another Ufi were in the forepart of the Earl’s ship. Ufi jumped up\r\nand tried to rouse the Earl, but could not, for he was dead-drunk. Then\r\nhe took him in his arms, and jumped overboard with him into a boat\r\nalongside the ship, and Orm jumped overboard on the other side, and\r\nescaped on shore. There Earl Erlend was slain, and most of those on\r\nboard. Margad and his men were awakened during the night by the\r\nbattle-cry, and took to their oars, and rowed round the headland. It was\r\nclear moonlight, and they saw when the Earls went away; and they felt\r\nsure that fate had decided between them. They rowed away first to\r\nRennadal (Rendale), and sent men to Swein, Asleif’s son, to tell him\r\nwhat they had seen. Earl Harald wished to give Earl Erlend’s men peace,\r\nbut Earl Rögnvald wished to wait, in order to know whether the Earl’s\r\nbody would be found or not. The body was found two nights before Yule. A\r\nspear was seen standing in a heap of seaweed; and that spear was fast in\r\nEarl Erlend’s body.[424] Then it was brought to church, and peace was\r\ngiven to the Earl’s men, as well as to four of Swein’s men who had been\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nA man named Jón Vœng was a sister’s son of that Jón Vœng who was\r\nmentioned before.[425] He had been with Hákon Karl, and had a child by\r\nhis sister; then he ran away, and was with Anakol on piratical\r\nexpeditions; but now he was with Erlend, yet he was not in the battle.\r\nAll Erlend’s men went to Kirkiuvag, and took refuge in St. Magnus’s\r\nchurch. The Earls went there, and a meeting for peace-making was held in\r\nthe church. The Earls would not pardon Jón until he promised to marry\r\nthe woman. All the men swore oaths of fealty to the Earls, and Jón Vœng\r\nbecame Earl Harald’s steward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XCVIII\r\n\r\n                          SWEIN SLAYS ERLEND.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER Earl Erlend’s death Swein, Asleif’s son, went to Rennadal\r\n(Rendale), and there he saw Margad, who was able to give him all the\r\ntidings of what happened in Daminsey. Then Swein went to Hrólfsey\r\n(Rousay), and arrived there at high-water. He and his men brought all\r\nthe tackle of the ships on shore, and placed it in safety. They divided\r\nthemselves among the farms, and kept watch on the movements of the Earls\r\nand other chiefs. Swein, Asleif’s son, mounted the hill with five men,\r\nand went down to the sea on the other side; they hid themselves at the\r\nhomestead in the darkness, and heard a great talking. There were\r\nThorfinn, his son Ogmund, and their brother-in-law Erlend.[426] He\r\nboasted of having given Earl Erlend the death-blow, and all of them were\r\ndeclaring they had done right well. When Swein heard this, he and his\r\ncompanions went in upon them. Swein was quickest, and immediately dealt\r\nErlend a death-blow. They took Thorfinn prisoner, and brought him away;\r\nbut Ogmund was wounded. Swein went to Thingavöll,[427] to his father’s\r\nbrother Helgi; and there they spent the first days of Yule in hiding.\r\nEarl Rögnvald went to Daminsey, but Earl Harald was at Kirkiuvag during\r\nYule-tide. Earl Rögnvald sent men to Thingavöll, to Helgi, and asked him\r\nto tell his kinsman Swein, if he knew anything of his whereabouts, that\r\nEarl Rögnvald invited him to spend the Yule with him, and he would try\r\nto make peace between him and Earl Harald. When Swein received this\r\nmessage, he went to Earl Rögnvald, and remained with him during the rest\r\nof the Yule-tide, and was well treated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XCIX\r\n\r\n                OF EARL HARALD AND SWEIN, ASLEIF’S SON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER Christmas a meeting was appointed to make peace between the Earls\r\nand Swein, when they should finally settle all matters about which\r\nreconciliation had been made. When they met, Earl Rögnvald took great\r\npains to make peace between them. Others, however, who were not Swein’s\r\nfriends or kinsmen, spoke against him, saying that he would always be\r\ncausing disturbances if he were not expelled from the Islands. At last,\r\nhowever, they agreed upon this—that Swein should pay a mark of gold to\r\neach of the Earls, and should keep one-half of his estates and a good\r\nlong-ship.\r\n\r\nWhen Swein heard the award, he replied: “Our agreement will be good only\r\nin case I am not oppressed.”\r\n\r\nEarl Rögnvald would not accept the payment from Swein, saying that he\r\nwould in no way oppress him, as he considered his faithfulness and\r\nfriendship worth more than money.\r\n\r\nAfter the peace-meeting, Earl Harald went to Gáreksey, and used Swein’s\r\ncorn and other property rather wastefully. When Swein heard this he\r\ncomplained of his loss to Earl Rögnvald, and said, that “this was a\r\nbreach of their agreement, and that he would go home to look after his\r\nproperty.”\r\n\r\nEarl Rögnvald said: “Stay with me, Swein: I shall send a message to Earl\r\nHarald, for he will be more than a match for you to deal with, strong\r\nand brave as you are.”\r\n\r\nSwein was not to be dissuaded, and went with ten men in a boat to\r\nGáreksey, and arrived there late in the evening. They went behind the\r\nhouses, and Swein wished to set fire to the hall, and burn down the\r\nhomestead, and the Earl within it. A man named Swein, Blákári’s son, the\r\nmost notable of Swein’s companions, dissuaded him from doing so, saying\r\nthat the Earl was not perhaps in the homestead; and if he was there, he\r\nwould neither permit Swein’s wife nor his daughter to go out, and it was\r\nnever to be thought of to burn them. Then they went up to the door, and\r\ninto the entry. Those who were inside the hall jumped up and closed the\r\ndoor, and then Swein and his men became aware that the Earl was not in\r\nthe house. Those who were within soon ceased resisting, surrendered\r\ntheir weapons to Swein, and went out unarmed. Swein gave quarter to all\r\nEarl Harald’s men. He poured out all his beer, and took away his wife\r\nand daughter. He asked his wife Ingirid where Earl Harald was, but she\r\nwould not tell him. He then said: “Say nothing then, but point to where\r\nhe is.” She would not do that either, because she was related to the\r\nEarl. Swein gave up some of the arms, when they came on board the ships.\r\nBut the effect of this was that their agreement of peace was at an end.\r\n\r\nEarl Harald had gone out to a certain island to hunt hares.[428] Swein\r\nwent to Hellisey.[429] It rises abruptly from the sea, and there is a\r\nlarge cave in the cliffs, the mouth of which is flooded at high-water.\r\nWhen the Earl’s men got their weapons from Swein, they went to Earl\r\nHarald and informed him of these doings of Swein’s. The Earl had his\r\nship set afloat, and ordered his men to row after him. He said: “This\r\ntime our meeting with Swein shall be decisive.” Then they rowed in\r\npursuit of him, and soon they saw and recognised each other.\r\n\r\nWhen Swein saw that they gained on him, he said: “We must devise some\r\nscheme, because I do not care to meet the Earl with so great odds\r\nagainst me as I suspect there are. Let us go to the cave and see how we\r\nfare.”\r\n\r\nWhen Swein came to the cave it was ebb tide. They hauled up the boat\r\ninto the cave, which ran into the cliff, and the water rose before the\r\nmouth of the cave. During the day Earl Harald and his men searched for\r\nSwein throughout the island, and did not find him, neither did they see\r\nany boat leave the island. They wondered very much at this, as they\r\nthought it unlikely that Swein’s boat had gone down. They rowed round\r\nthe island in search of the boat, but did not find it. Then they\r\nconcluded that he must have gone to some of the other islands, and they\r\nwent where they thought it most likely. It so happened that, when the\r\nEarl rowed away, the tide was back from the mouth of the cave. Swein had\r\noverheard the talk between the Earl and his men. He left his own boat in\r\nthe cave, and took a small boat which the monks[430] had, and went to\r\nSandey. There they landed, and pushed off the small boat, which drifted\r\nabout till it was wrecked. They came to a homestead called\r\nVöluness,[431] where a man lived by name Bárd, who was Swein’s kinsman.\r\nThey made themselves known to him secretly, and Swein said he wished to\r\nstay there. Bárd said he might do as he liked, but that he dared not\r\nkeep him here unless in hiding. They went in, and sat by themselves in a\r\npart of the house separated from the other inmates by a partition-wall.\r\nThere was a secret door to it, filled up with loose stones. That evening\r\nJón Vœng, Earl Harald’s steward, arrived there with six men, and Bárd\r\nreceived them well. Large fires were made, at which they warmed\r\nthemselves. Jón was excited, and spoke of the dealings of Swein and the\r\nEarls. He blamed Swein very much, said he was a truce-breaker, and\r\nfaithful to no one. He had lately made peace with Earl Harald, and yet\r\nhe went to attack him and burn him in the house, adding that there would\r\nnever be peace in the land till Swein was banished from it. Bárd and\r\nJón’s companions put in some words in Swein’s defence. Then Jón began to\r\nblame Earl Erlend, saying there was no loss in his death, as he was a\r\nviolent man, and nobody could live in safety for him. When Swein heard\r\nthis, he could not restrain himself, but seized his weapons, and ran to\r\nthe secret door. He pushed the stones down, thus making a great noise.\r\nSwein’s design was to leap before the hall-door. Jón was sitting in his\r\nshirt and linen breeches, and when he heard Swein coming he tied on his\r\nshoes and sprang out from the fire and away from the house. The night\r\nwas pitch dark, and it was hard frost. During the night he came to\r\nanother farm. His feet were very much frost-bitten, and some of his toes\r\nfell off. Through the intercession of Bárd, Swein gave peace to Jón’s\r\ncompanions. He remained there during the night, but in the morning he\r\nand his men went away in a boat belonging to Bárd, which he gave to him.\r\nThey went south to Bardsvík,[432] and stayed in a certain cave.\r\nSometimes Swein took his meals at a house during the day, but slept\r\nduring the night down by his boat, and thus he guarded himself against\r\nhis enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER C\r\n\r\n                         OF ROGNVALD AND SWEIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE morning early Swein and his men saw a large long-ship coming from\r\nHrólfsey (Hrossey?) to Rögnvaldsey,[433] and Swein recognised it\r\nimmediately as Earl Rögnvald’s ship, which he used to command himself.\r\nThey put in at Rögnvaldsey, where Swein’s boat was lying, and five of\r\nthem went on shore. Swein and his men were on a certain headland, and\r\nthrew stones at the Earl’s men. When those on board saw this, they drew\r\nforth their arms; and when that was seen by Swein, they ran down to the\r\nbeach, and pushed their boat afloat, and jumped into it. The long-ship\r\nstuck fast on the beach. When they rowed past it, Swein was standing up\r\nwith a spear in his hand. When Earl Rögnvald perceived it, he took a\r\nshield and held it before him, but Swein did not throw the spear. When\r\nthe Earl saw that they would get away from them, he ordered a\r\ntruce-shield to be held aloft, and asked Swein to go on shore. When\r\nSwein saw this, he told his men to put to land, saying that it was his\r\ngreatest satisfaction to be at peace with Earl Rögnvald.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER CI\r\n\r\n                       OF EARL HARALD AND SWEIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEN Earl Rögnvald and Swein went on shore, and had a long conversation\r\nby themselves, and agreed very well. While they were talking, they saw\r\nEarl Harald sailing from Caithness to Vagaland (Walls), and when the\r\nship approached the island, Swein asked what was to be done. The Earl\r\nsaid Swein should go over to Ness immediately. This was during Lent.\r\nThey left Rögnvaldsey at the same time. The Earl went to Hrossey,[434]\r\nbut Swein went west to Straumsey (Stroma). Earl Harald saw the boat, and\r\nthought he recognised it as Swein’s, and went immediately into the Firth\r\nin pursuit. When Swein saw the pursuit, they left the boat, and hid\r\nthemselves. When Earl Harald came to Straumsey (Stroma) he saw the boat,\r\nand suspected that the men were somewhere near, and would not therefore\r\ngo on shore. A man named Amundi, the son of Hnefi, who was Earl Harald’s\r\nfriend, and father’s brother to Swein, Asleif’s son’s stepchildren, went\r\nbetween them, and succeeded so far that they agreed to keep the\r\nagreement of peace which they had made the previous winter. A gale\r\narose, and they were both obliged to remain there during the night, and\r\nAmundi put Earl Harald and Swein in the same bed, and many of their men\r\nslept in the same house.\r\n\r\nAfter this Swein went over to Ness (Caithness), and Earl Harald to the\r\nOrkneys. Swein heard that the Earl had said that their agreement to be\r\nat peace had been rather loose. He paid little heed to this, however,\r\nand went south to Dalir, and spent the Easter there with his friend\r\nSumarlidi; but Earl Harald went north to Hjaltland, and was there a long\r\ntime during the spring.\r\n\r\nAfter Easter Swein went from the south, and met on his way two of Jón\r\nVœng’s brothers—one was called Bunu-Pétr, the other Blán. Swein and his\r\nmen seized them, and took from them all their goods, and brought them to\r\nland. A gallows was erected for them, and when everything was ready\r\nSwein said they should be allowed to run up the country, adding that\r\nthey were greater shame to their brother Jón alive than dead. They were\r\na long time out on the hills, and when they came to some habitations\r\nthey were very much frost-bitten.\r\n\r\nFrom thence Swein went to Liódhús, in the Sudreyar, and stayed there\r\nsome time. When Jón Vœng heard that Swein had taken his brothers\r\nprisoners, and not knowing what he had done with them, he went to Eyin\r\nHelga (Enhallow), and took Olaf, the son of Swein, Asleif’s son, and\r\nKolbein Hruga’s foster-son, and brought him to Westrey. They met Earl\r\nRögnvald at Hreppisnes,[435] and when he saw Olaf, he said: “Why are you\r\nhere, Olaf?”\r\n\r\nHe said: “It is the work of Jón Vœng.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl looked to Jón, and said: “Why did you bring Olaf here?”\r\n\r\nHe replied: “Swein took my brothers, and I don’t know but he may have\r\nkilled them.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl said: “Take him back again as quickly as you can, and do not\r\ndare to do him any harm, whatever may have become of your brothers, for\r\nif you do, you will not be safe in the Islands from either Swein or\r\nKolbein.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER CII\r\n\r\n                           OF EARL RÖGNVALD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER Easter Swein commenced a journey to the Sudreyar, taking with him\r\nsixty men. He went to the Orkneys, and landed first in Hrólfsey\r\n(Rousay). There they took a man, by name Hákon Karl,[436] who had been\r\nwith Earl Harald when Earl Erlend was slain. Hákon ransomed himself with\r\nthree marks of gold, and thus saved himself from Swein. In Hrólfsey\r\nSwein found the ship which the Earls had taken from him, and two of the\r\nplanks were cut, which had been done by Earl Rögnvald’s order, because\r\nSwein had refused to buy it or to accept it as a gift from the Earls.\r\nSwein went from there to Hrossey, and met Earl Rögnvald at Birgishérad\r\n(Birsay). The Earl received him well, and Swein spent the spring with\r\nhim. Earl Rögnvald said that he had ordered the planks of the ship to be\r\ncut, because he did not wish him to row about rashly among the Islands\r\nwhen he came from the Sudreyar. Earl Harald came from Hjaltland in the\r\nspring during the Whitsuntide, and when he came to the Orkneys Earl\r\nRögnvald sent men to him to say that he wished the compact of peace\r\nbetween him and Swein to be renewed, and a peace meeting was appointed\r\nin St. Magnus’s church on Friday during the holy week. Earl Rögnvald\r\ncarried a broad axe to the meeting, and Swein went with him. Then the\r\npeace compact which had been made in the winter was confirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER CIII\r\n\r\n                        OF SWEIN, ASLEIF’S SON.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEN Earl Rögnvald gave Earl Harald the ship which had belonged to\r\nSwein, but all other things which had been awarded him from Swein he\r\nreturned to him. Earl Rögnvald and Swein were standing at the\r\nchurch-door while the sail, which had been lying in St. Magnus’s church,\r\nwas carried out, and Swein looked rather gloomy. The following Saturday,\r\nafter noontide service, Earl Harald’s men came to Swein, Asleif’s son,\r\nand said the Earl wished him to come to speak with him. Swein consulted\r\nEarl Rögnvald, but he did not say much in favour of his going, and added\r\nthat one did not know whom to trust. Swein went, nevertheless, with five\r\nmen. The Earl was sitting on a cross bench in a small room, and\r\nThorbiörn Klerk beside him. A few other men were with the Earl, and they\r\nsat for a while and drank. Then Thorbiörn left the room, and Swein’s\r\ncompanions said to him that they distrusted the Earl’s conduct very\r\nmuch. Thorbiörn returned shortly after, and presented Swein with a\r\nscarlet tunic and a cloak, saying that he did not know whether he would\r\ncall it a gift, because these things had been taken from Swein in the\r\nwinter. Swein accepted the gifts. Earl Harald restored to him the\r\nlong-ship which had belonged to him, and the half of his property and\r\nestates. He asked him to stay with him, and said their friendship should\r\nnever be dissolved. Swein accepted all this gladly, and went immediately\r\nthe same night and told Earl Rögnvald how matters had turned out between\r\nhim and Earl Harald. Earl Rögnvald said he was much pleased with this,\r\nand told Swein to take care that they did not become enemies again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER CIV\r\n\r\n                             OF THE EARLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA SHORT time after, the three chiefs—Swein, Thorbiörn, and Eirik—went\r\nout on a plundering expedition. They went first to the Sudreyar, and all\r\nalong the west to the Syllingar, where they gained a great victory in\r\nMaríuhöfn[437] on Columba’s-mas (9th June), and took much booty. Then\r\nthey returned to the Orkneys.\r\n\r\nWhen the Earls Harald and Rögnvald had made peace with Swein, Asleif’s\r\nson, they were always together, and Earl Rögnvald governed, but they\r\nagreed very well. When they came home from the Syllingar, Thorbiörn\r\nKlerk went to Earl Harald, and became his counsellor. Swein went home to\r\nGáreksey, and resided there during the winter with many men, living upon\r\nhis booty, and other stores which he possessed there in the Islands. He\r\nwas most attached to Earl Rögnvald. Every summer he was out on marauding\r\nexpeditions. It was said that Thorbiörn did not improve the harmony\r\nbetween Earl Harald and Earl Rögnvald.\r\n\r\nThórarinn Killinef was one of Earl Rögnvald’s men, a great friend of\r\nhis, and was always with the Earl. A man named Thorkel was one of\r\nThorbiörn Klerk’s followers, and a friend of his. Thórarinn and Thorkel\r\nquarrelled over their drink at Kirkiuvag, and Thorkel wounded Thórarinn,\r\nand then escaped to Thorbiörn. Thórarinn’s companions pursued Thorkel,\r\nbut Thorbiörn and his men defended themselves in a loft. The Earls were\r\ninformed of this, and they went to part them. Thorbiörn refused to leave\r\nthe decision of this case to Earl Rögnvald, as it was his men that were\r\nconcerned in the pursuit. When Thórarinn had recovered from his wounds,\r\nhe slew Thorkel as he was going to church. He ran into the church, but\r\nThorbiörn and his men pursued him. Earl Rögnvald was told what was\r\nhappening, and he went there with his men, and asked Thorbiörn whether\r\nhe was going to break the church open. Thorbiörn said the church ought\r\nnot to shelter him who was within. Earl Rögnvald said there should be no\r\nviolation of the church at this time, and Thorbiörn was pushed away from\r\nit. No agreement was come to about this case.\r\n\r\nThorbiörn went over to Caithness, and was there for a while. Then many\r\nthings happened to estrange them, for Thorbiörn was often guilty of\r\nviolence to women, and of manslaying. He went secretly out to the\r\nOrkneys in a boat with thirty men, and landed at Skálpeid, and walked to\r\nKirkiuvag with three men. In the evening he went alone into an inn where\r\nThórarinn was drinking, and struck him a death-blow immediately. Then he\r\nran out into the darkness and far away. For this the Earl made him an\r\noutlaw in every part of his dominions. Thorbiörn went over to Ness, and\r\nremained in hiding with his brother-in-law, Hösvir, who was called the\r\nstrong. He had married Thorbiörn’s sister, Ragnhild, and their son was\r\nStefán Rádgiafi (counsellor), Thorbiörn’s follower. Shortly afterwards\r\nThorbiörn went to Malcolm, King of Scots, and remained there a while, in\r\nhigh favour with the King. There was a man called Gillaodran with the\r\nKing of Scots. He was of a great family, but a violent man. He had\r\nincurred the displeasure of the King of Scots for violent acts and\r\nmanslaughters which he had committed in his kingdom. He fled to the\r\nOrkneys, and the Earls received him. Then he went to Caithness, and\r\nacted as a steward for the Earls. There was a noble Bondi in Caithness,\r\nby name Helgi, a friend of Earl Rögnvald’s. Gillaodran quarrelled with\r\nhim about the stewardship, and Gillaodran attacked and killed him. After\r\nthe slaughter he went west to Scotland’s Fiord, and was received by a\r\nchief named Sumarlidi Höld,[438] who had possessions in Dalir, on\r\nScotland’s Fiord. His wife was Ragnhild, the daughter of Olaf Bitling\r\n(little bit), King of the Sudreyar. Their sons were King Dufgall,\r\nRögnvald, and Engull.[439] They were called the Dalverja family.\r\n\r\nEarl Rögnvald sent for Swein, Asleif’s son, before he went out on his\r\nexpedition. When they met, Earl Rögnvald asked him to have an eye on\r\nGillaodran if he had an opportunity. Swein said he did not know how far\r\nhe might succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER CV\r\n\r\n                         SWEIN SLAYS SUMARLIDI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEN Swein went on a marauding expedition, having five long-ships. When\r\nhe came west to Scotland’s Fiord, he heard that Sumarlidi Höld had gone\r\non board a ship, and was about to set out on an expedition. He had seven\r\nships, and Gillaodran commanded one. He had gone into the firths to\r\nbring up some troops that had not arrived. When Swein heard of\r\nSumarlidi, he gave him battle, and it was a fierce fight. Sumarlidi Höld\r\nwas killed in that fight, and many men with him. When Swein became aware\r\nthat Gillaodran was not there, he went in search of him, and slew him in\r\nMyrkvifiörd,[440] and fifty men with him. Then he went on his\r\nexpedition, and returned home in the autumn, as his custom was. He went\r\nto see Earl Rögnvald soon after his return, and he was much pleased with\r\nthese deeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER CVI\r\n\r\n                   OF EARL RÖGNVALD AND EARL HARALD.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVERY summer the Earls were wont to go over to Caithness, and up into\r\nthe forests to hunt the red-deer or the reindeer.[441] Thorbiörn Klerk\r\nwas with the King of Scots, and sometimes he went to Caithness and\r\nstayed in hiding with his friends. He had three friends in Caithness\r\nwhom he trusted most. One was his brother-in-law, Hösvir; the second,\r\nLiótólf, who lived in Thórsdal; and the third was Hallvard, Dúfa’s son,\r\nin Kálfadal (Calder), at a certain promontory off Thórsdal. All these\r\nwere his intimate friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER CVII\r\n\r\n                     THE SLAYING OF EARL RÖGNVALD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Earl Rögnvald had been an Earl two-and-twenty winters from the time\r\nthat Earl Paul was taken prisoner, the Earls went over to Caithness\r\nduring the latter part of the summer as usual, and when they came to\r\nThórsá they heard a rumour to the effect that Thorbiörn was there in\r\nhiding with not a few men, and that he intended to attack them if he had\r\nan opportunity. Then the Earls called men together, and went with a\r\nhundred men, twenty of whom were on horseback and the rest on foot. In\r\nthe evening they went up into the valley,[442] and took up their\r\nquarters for the night. When they were sitting by the fire in the\r\nevening, Earl Rögnvald sneezed very much. Earl Harald said: “That was a\r\nloud sneeze, kinsman.” In the morning they went along the valley.\r\n\r\nDuring the day Earl Rögnvald rode always ahead of his men, and a man\r\nwith him called Asólf, and another by name Jómar, his kinsman. They rode\r\nfive together along Kálfadal; and when they came to the farm, farmer\r\nHöskuld was on the top of a corn-stack piling up the corn, which his\r\nservants brought to him. Earl Harald was some distance behind. When\r\nHöskuld recognised Earl Rögnvald, he saluted him by name, and asked for\r\nnews, speaking very loud, so that he could be heard far away. This was a\r\nshort distance from the sitting-room of the house. The homestead stood\r\non an eminence, and one had to go through narrow and very steep passages\r\nup to it. Thorbiörn was at this farm, and was sitting indoors drinking.\r\nThe passages led to the end of the house close to the gable, which had a\r\ndoor filled loosely with stones. Thorbiörn and his men, hearing the\r\nwords of Höskuld when he saluted Earl Rögnvald, seized their weapons,\r\npushed the stones from the concealed door, and ran out. Thorbiörn ran\r\nround the gable, and on to the wall of the passage. The Earl was then\r\nclose to the door. Thorbiörn struck at him, and Asólf warded off the\r\nblow with his hand, and it was cut off; and then the sword touched the\r\nEarl’s chin, inflicting a great wound.\r\n\r\nOn receiving the blow Asólf said: “Let them serve the Earl better who\r\nhave to thank him for greater gifts.” He was then eighteen winters old,\r\nand had lately entered the Earl’s service.\r\n\r\nEarl Rögnvald was going to jump off his horse, and his foot stuck fast\r\nin the stirrup. At that moment Stefán arrived and stabbed him with a\r\nspear; and Thorbiörn wounded him again; but Jómar stabbed Thorbiörn in\r\nthe thigh, the spear entering the bowels. Then Thorbiörn and his men ran\r\nbehind the homestead, and down a steep bank, into a wet morass. Then\r\nEarl Harald and his men arrived and met Thorbiörn. They recognised each\r\nother, and the Earl’s men, when they knew his intentions, advised to\r\npursue him; but Earl Harald dissuaded them from it, saying that he\r\nwished to wait for Earl Rögnvald’s opinion, “Because,” said he, “I am\r\nvery intimately connected with Thorbiörn, as you know, both through\r\nrelationship and other ties.”\r\n\r\nThose who were with Earl Rögnvald stood sorrowing over his dead body,\r\nand some time passed before Earl Harald heard the news. Thorbiörn and\r\nhis men had got out on the bog, and across the moss-hag running along\r\nit. But through the urgency of the Earl’s followers, he and his men ran\r\ndown to the bog, and they met at the moss-hag—the two parties standing\r\none on either side. Thorbiörn’s party defended themselves from the bank,\r\nand his followers ran to his assistance from the neighbouring\r\nhomesteads, until they were fifty in number. They defended themselves\r\nbravely, for they had a strong position. The moss-hag was both deep and\r\nbroad, and the bog was soft; so they could only hurl spears at each\r\nother. Thorbiörn told his men to throw none back; and when the Earl’s\r\nparty had exhausted their missiles they spoke to each other, and\r\nThorbiörn called to Earl Harald, saying, “Kinsman! I wish to ask you to\r\ngive me quarter, and I am willing to leave the decision of this case\r\nentirely in your hands. I will reserve nothing which may contribute to\r\nyour honour. I also think, kinsman, you must remember that there have\r\nbeen quarrels in which you would not have made such a difference between\r\nEarl Rögnvald and me that you would have killed me for having done this\r\ndeed, when he had you under his thumb, and left you no more power than\r\nif you had been his page; but I gave you the best gifts, and endeavoured\r\nto further your honour in every way I could. The deed which I have\r\ncommitted is indeed a great crime, and weighs heavily upon me, but the\r\nwhole of his dominions revert to you. You may also know that Earl\r\nRögnvald intended for me the same fate which he met at my hands. And I\r\nsuspect, kinsman, that if it had so happened that I were dead, and Earl\r\nRögnvald alive, you would not have quarrelled with him; and yet you wish\r\nto take away my life.”\r\n\r\nThorbiörn urged his case with many fair words, and many pleaded for him,\r\nand begged that quarter might be given him. And at last, when so many\r\npleaded, the Earl began to listen to them.\r\n\r\nThen Magnus, the son of Gunni, Hávard’s son, a chief and a kinsman of\r\nthe Earl’s, and the noblest born of Earl Harald’s followers, took speech\r\nas follows:—“We are not able to counsel you, Earl, after these great\r\ndeeds, but I shall tell you what will be said if quarter is given to\r\nThorbiörn when he has done such a deed, and even dared to say to your\r\nface, almost in so many words, that he has done this wickedness in your\r\ninterest, or for your honour; and it will be an everlasting shame and\r\ndishonour to you and to all the Earl’s kinsmen if he is not avenged. I\r\nthink Earl Rögnvald’s friends will believe it to be the truth that for a\r\nlong time you have been planning his death, and that it is your plan\r\nwhich has now been accomplished. Do you think he will acquit you from\r\ncomplicity in his guilt when he has to defend himself; since no one says\r\na word for you when he tells you to your face that he has committed this\r\ncrime in your interest? And how can you better confirm this suspicion\r\nthan by now granting him peace? I have resolved, for my part, never to\r\ngive him quarter, if any doughty men are willing to follow me, whether\r\nyou like it or not.”\r\n\r\nHis brother Thorstein, and Hákon, and Swein, Hróald’s son, spoke to the\r\nsame effect. Then they left the Earl and went along by the moss-hag,\r\ntrying to find a place where they might cross.\r\n\r\nWhen Thorbiörn saw Magnus and his followers walking along the moss-hag,\r\nhe said: “Now, I suppose, they must have disagreed in their counsels;\r\nthe Earl has wished to give me peace, and Magnus has spoken against it.”\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus talking, Thorbiörn and his men went farther away\r\nfrom the moss-hag.\r\n\r\nHarald’s party stood on the brink, and when he saw that no quarter would\r\nbe given, he leapt across in full armour, though it was nine ells[443]\r\nbroad. His followers leapt after him, but none of them were able to leap\r\nso far; and most of them caught the bank and crawled up out of the mud.\r\n\r\nThorbiörn’s men urged him to advance against Magnus and his men, and\r\ndecide the matter with them; but he said: “I think the best plan is,\r\nthat each of you do what he thinks likely to be best, but I shall go to\r\nEarl Harald.”\r\n\r\nMost of his men dissuaded him from this, and begged him rather to flee\r\nto the woods and save himself. He did not, however, accept that advice.\r\nThen his followers left him, and tried to save themselves in various\r\nways, and at last there were eight men only with Thorbiörn. When he saw\r\nthat Earl Harald had crossed the ditch, he went to him and fell on his\r\nknees, saying that he brought his head to him. Many of the Earl’s men\r\nasked that peace might be given him; and the Earl said: “Save yourself,\r\nThorbiörn; I have not the heart to kill you.”\r\n\r\nWhile they were talking, they moved down the valley along\r\nKalfadalsá,[444] and Magnus’s party pursued them. When the Earl saw it,\r\nhe said: “Save yourself, Thorbiörn, I will not fight for you against my\r\nmen.” Then Thorbiörn and his men left the Earl’s party, and went to some\r\ndeserted shielings called Asgrím’s ærgin.[445] Magnus’s party pursued\r\nthem, and set the buildings on fire immediately. Thorbiörn and his men\r\ndefended themselves bravely; and when the buildings began to fall down\r\nwith the burning, they went out and were attacked by the other party\r\nwith their weapons, as soon as they could reach them. They were already\r\nvery much exhausted by the fire, and fell there all nine. When\r\nThorbiörn’s wounds were examined, it was found that the intestines\r\nprotruded through the wound inflicted by Jómar. Earl Harald led his men\r\ndown the valley, but those who were with Magnus went to Fors (Forss),\r\nwrapped up Earl Rögnvald’s body, and brought it down to Thórsá.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER CVIII\r\n\r\n                  THE REMOVAL OF EARL RÖGNVALD’S BODY.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARL RÖGNVALD KALI died five nights after the summer Marymas.[446] Earl\r\nHarald brought the body with a splendid following to the Orkneys, and it\r\nwas buried at the Magnus Kirk; and there it rested until God manifested\r\nRögnvald’s merits by many and great miracles. Then Bishop Bjarni had his\r\nholy remains exhumed with the permission of the Pope.[447] Where the\r\nblood of the Earl fell on the stones when he died, it may be seen to\r\nthis day as fresh as if it had just come from the wounds.\r\n\r\nEarl Rögnvald’s death was much lamented, because he was very popular in\r\nthe Islands and in many other parts. He had been helpful to many, was\r\nliberal with his money, gentle, and a true friend, highly accomplished,\r\nand a good scald. He left a daughter, Ingigerd, an only child, who was\r\nmarried to Eirík Slagbrellir. Their children were Harald Ungi, Magnus\r\nMangi, Rögnvald, Ingibiorg, Elín, and Ragnhild.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER CIX\r\n\r\n                          OF HARALD AND SWEIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER Earl Rögnvald’s death, Earl Harald took possession of the whole of\r\nthe Islands, and became their sole ruler. He was a mighty chief, and a\r\nman of large stature and great strength. His wife was Afreka, and their\r\nchildren were—Heinrek, Hákon, Helena, and Margarét. When Hákon was only\r\na few winters old, Swein, Asleif’s son, offered to foster him, and when\r\nhe was able to take his part with other men, Swein took him out on\r\nmarauding expeditions every summer, and honoured him in everything.\r\nSwein used to reside at home in Gáreksey, in winter, keeping there\r\neighty men at his own expense. He had such a large drinking-hall that\r\nthere was none equal to it anywhere else in the Orkneys. In the spring\r\nhe was very busy sowing a large breadth of seed, and he usually did a\r\ngreat part of the work himself. When this work was finished, he went\r\nevery spring on marauding expeditions. He plundered in the Sudreyar and\r\nIreland, and returned home after midsummer. This he called\r\nspring-viking. Then he stayed at home till the fields were reaped and\r\nthe corn brought in. Then he went out again, and did not return until\r\none month of winter had passed. This he called autumn-viking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER CX\r\n\r\n                         SWEIN GOES TO IRELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nONCE it happened that Swein went out on a spring expedition, taking with\r\nhim Hákon, the son of Earl Harald. They had five rowing ships, all\r\nlarge. They plundered in the Sudreyar. All the inhabitants were so\r\nafraid of him that they hid all their movable property in the ground or\r\nin heaps of loose stones. Swein went all the way south to Man, and\r\nobtained very little booty. Then they went to Ireland and plundered\r\nthere, but when they were approaching Dýflin (Dublin) two merchant-ships\r\ncame from England, laden with English cloth and other merchandise; they\r\nwere going to Dýflin. Swein made for the vessels, and offered them\r\nbattle. There was little resistance by the English, and Swein’s party\r\ntook every penny in the vessels, leaving to the Englishmen only what\r\nthey stood in, and a small quantity of provisions. They sailed away in\r\nthe vessels, but Swein’s party went to the Sudreyar, and divided their\r\nbooty. They sailed from the west with great pomp. When they were lying\r\nin harbours, they covered their ships with the English cloth, to make a\r\nshow; and when they sailed to the Orkneys, they sewed the cloth upon\r\ntheir sails, and then it looked as if the sails were made entirely of\r\nthe fine stuffs. This they named the Skrud-viking.[448]\r\n\r\nSwein went home to his estate in Gáreksey. He had taken a large quantity\r\nof wine and English mead from the vessels. When he had been at home a\r\nshort time he invited Earl Harald, and prepared a splendid feast for\r\nhim. When Earl Harald was at the feast a great deal was said of Swein’s\r\nmagnificence. The Earl said: “I wish, Swein, you would now leave off\r\nyour marauding expeditions; it is good now to drive home a whole waggon.\r\nYou know that your plundering has fed you and your men a long time, but\r\nto most men of violence it happens that they perish in their raiding, if\r\nthey do not leave it off in time.”\r\n\r\nSwein looked to the Earl and said, smiling: “This is well said, my Lord;\r\nyou have spoken like a friend, and it is good to take sound advice from\r\nyou; but some complain that you are not an over just man yourself.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl replied: “I must be responsible for my own acts, but I spoke as\r\nit occurred to me.”\r\n\r\nSwein replied: “Your intention is no doubt good, my Lord; and it shall\r\nbe so, that I will discontinue my marauding expeditions, for I am\r\ngetting old, and my strength is wasting away in the wet work and the\r\nfighting. I am now going to make an autumn expedition, and I wish it to\r\nbe not less glorious than the spring one. Then I shall leave off\r\nwar-going.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl replied: “It is difficult to know, comrade, which comes\r\nfirst—death or lasting fame.”\r\n\r\nThen their conversation ceased. When Earl Harald left the feast\r\nhonourable gifts were presented to him, and he and Swein parted very\r\ngood friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER CXI\r\n\r\n                SWEIN, ASLEIF’S SON’S (LAST) EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHORTLY after this Swein prepared to go on a marauding expedition with\r\nseven long-ships, all of them large. Hákon, the son of Earl Harald, went\r\nwith him. They went first to the Sudreyar, and found there little booty.\r\nThen they went to Ireland, and plundered there in many places. They went\r\nall the way south to Dýflin (Dublin), and took the inhabitants by\r\nsurprise, so that they did not know till they were in the town. They\r\ntook a great deal of plunder, and took captive the rulers of the city,\r\nand their negotiations ended in the surrender of the town to Swein, and\r\nthey promised to pay as much money as he might levy on them. He was to\r\nquarter his men on the town, and have the command of it, and the Dýflin\r\nmen confirmed this arrangement with oaths. Swein and his men went down\r\nto their ships in the evening, but in the morning they were to come into\r\nthe town and receive hostages from the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nNow it is to be told what was going on in the town during the night. The\r\nrulers of the town had a meeting, and considered the difficulties in\r\nwhich they were placed. They thought it a grievous hardship that they\r\nshould have to surrender their town to the Orkneymen, especially to him\r\nwhom they knew to be the most exacting man in the whole West; and they\r\ncame to the determination to play him false if they could. They resolved\r\nto dig large pits inside of the city gates, and in many other places\r\nbetween the houses, where it was intended that Swein’s men should come\r\nin, and armed men were hidden in the houses close by. They placed such\r\ncoverings over the pits as were sure to fall in when the weight of the\r\nmen came upon them. Then they covered all over with straw, so that the\r\npits could not be seen, and waited till morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER CXII\r\n\r\n                      SWEIN, ASLEIF’S SON’S FALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEXT morning Swein and his men arose and armed themselves, and went to\r\nthe town; and when they came near the gates the Dýflin men ranged\r\nthemselves on both sides from the gates along by the pits. Swein and his\r\nmen, not being on their guard, fell into them. Some of the townsmen ran\r\nimmediately to the gates, and others to the pits, and attacked Swein’s\r\nmen with weapons. It was difficult for them to defend themselves, and\r\nSwein perished there in the pit, with all those who had entered the\r\ntown. It was said that Swein was the last man who died there, and that\r\nhe spake these words before his fall: “Know all men, whether I die\r\nto-day or not, that I am the holy Earl Rögnvald’s henchman, and my\r\nconfidence is where he is with God.” Swein’s surviving followers went\r\nthen to their ships, and put out to sea; and nothing is said of their\r\nvoyage until they came to the Orkneys. Here is the end of Swein’s\r\nhistory; and it has been said that he was the greatest man in the\r\nWestern lands, either in old times or at the present day, of those who\r\nhad not a higher title than he had. After his death his sons Olaf and\r\nAndrés divided their patrimony. The next summer after his death they\r\nraised the end walls of the large drinking-hall which he had in\r\nGáreksey. Andrés, the son of Swein, married Frída, the daughter of\r\nKolbein Hruga, and sister to Bishop Bjarni.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER CXIII\r\n\r\n                      OF EARL HARALD AND HIS SONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW Earl Harald ruled the Orkneys, and was a great chief.\r\nAfterwards[449] he married Hvarflod,[450] the daughter of Earl\r\nMalcolm,[451] of Mærhæfi (Moray). Their children were Thorfinn,[452]\r\nDavid, Jón, Gunnhild, Herborga, and Langlíf.\r\n\r\nWhen Bishop William the Second was dead, Bjarni, the son of Kolbein\r\nHruga, was made bishop after him. He was a very great man, and a dear\r\nfriend of Earl Harald. Bishop Bjarni had a large party of kinsmen in the\r\nIslands. The sons of Eirík Slagbrellir were Harald Ungi, Magnus Mangi,\r\nand Rögnvald. The brothers went east to Norway to see King Magnus,\r\nErling’s son, and he gave Harald the title of Earl, and one half of the\r\nIslands, which had belonged to the holy Earl Rögnvald, his mother’s\r\nfather. Earl Harald Ungi went to the west, and with him Sigurd Murt, the\r\nson of Ivar Galli. The mother of Ivar, who fell at Akr with Erling\r\nSkakki, was the daughter of Hávard, Gunni’s son. Sigurd Murt was young,\r\nhandsome, and a great dandy. Magnus Mangi remained with the King, and\r\nfell with him in Sogn.\r\n\r\nHarald (Ungi) and his followers came first to Hjaltland. Then they went\r\nover to Caithness, and then into Scotland, to William, King of\r\nScots.[453] Earl Harald requested King William to give him the half of\r\nCaithness which Earl Rögnvald had held. The King granted him this; and\r\nEarl Harald went then down to Caithness, and gathered troops. Then\r\nLífólf Skalli, his brother-in-law, came to him. He had many noble\r\nkinsmen there. Lífólf had married Ragnhild, the sister of Earl Harald.\r\nHe was called Earl Harald Ungi (the younger); but Harald, Maddad’s son,\r\nthe elder. Lífólf had the command of the Earl’s troops. They sent men to\r\nthe Orkneys, to Earl Harald the elder, requesting him to give up one\r\nhalf of the Islands, since the King had given them to Earl Harald Ungi.\r\nWhen the Earl received this message, he refused absolutely to divide his\r\ndominions on any condition. Lífólf Skalli was the messenger, and the\r\nEarl upbraided him greatly before he left. After this, Earl Harald the\r\nelder collected troops, and obtained a great many. Earl Harald Ungi’s\r\nparty were in Caithness, and had some gathering too. When they heard\r\nthat Harald the elder was collecting troops, they sent Lífólf a second\r\ntime across the Pentland Firth to gather information about the enemy’s\r\nforces. He landed east in Rögnvaldsey, and ascended a hill, where he\r\nfound three of Harald’s watchmen. Two of them he killed, and one of them\r\nhe took with him for information. Then Lífólf saw the Earl’s fleet,\r\nwhich consisted of many ships, most of them large. Then he went down\r\nfrom the hill to his boat, and told his companions what he had\r\nascertained. He said Earl Harald had so large an army that it was quite\r\nhopeless for them to fight with him. “I would advise,” said Lífólf,\r\n“that we should go to-day to Thórsá, and there many troops will come to\r\nus at once. If you wish to offer battle to Earl Harald now, it is most\r\nimprudent, whatever the result may be.”\r\n\r\nThen said Sigurd Murt: “Ill has the Earl’s brother-in-law fared across\r\nthe Pentland Firth if he has left his heart behind him;” adding,\r\nfurther, that their prospects were not bright if all should lose heart\r\nwhen they saw Earl Harald’s army.\r\n\r\nLífólf replied: “It is difficult to see, Sigurd, where each one carries\r\nhis heart when courage is required; and I believe you men of mark will\r\nthink it a serious matter to remain behind when I run from Harald Ungi.”\r\n\r\nThey did not go to Thórsá; but shortly after they saw Earl Harald’s\r\nfleet coming from Rögnvaldsey, and then they prepared for battle. Earl\r\nHarald went on shore, and placed his men in battle array. They far\r\nexceeded the others in number. Sigurd Murt and Lífólf arranged the\r\ntroops of Earl Ungi. The former was dressed in a scarlet tunic, and\r\ntucked the skirt under his belt. Some said that the same should be done\r\nbehind, but he told them not to do it, “for,” said he, “I shall not go\r\nbackwards to-day.” Lífólf and Sigurd led one wing each, and when they\r\nhad arrayed their men the battle began with great fury. Among the troops\r\nof Earl Harald the elder there were many hardy, fierce, and well-armed\r\nmen, the Bishop’s kinsmen, and many others of the Earl’s champions. When\r\nthe battle had lasted for a while, Sigurd Murt fell, having borne\r\nhimself well and bravely. Lífólf behaved the most valiantly of them all.\r\nThe Caithnessmen say he broke three times through the ranks of Earl\r\nHarald’s men, yet he fell in this fight, after having earned great fame.\r\nWhen both were dead—Lífólf and Sigurd Murt—Earl Ungi’s men fled. Earl\r\nHarald Ungi fell at some turf-pits,[454] and that very night a great\r\nlight was seen where his blood fell on the ground. People said he was\r\ntruly a saint, and there is now a church where he fell. He is buried in\r\nNess (Caithness). Innumerable miracles are by God granted through his\r\nmerits, which testify that he wished to go to Orkney to his kinsmen Earl\r\nMagnus and Earl Rögnvald. After the battle Earl Harald subdued the whole\r\nof Caithness, and went back triumphant to the Orkneys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER CXIV\r\n\r\n                           OF THE ORKNEYMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIAM, King of Scots, heard that Earl Harald (Ungi) had been killed,\r\nand also that Earl Harald, Maddad’s son, had subdued the whole of\r\nCaithness without asking his leave. He became enraged at this, and sent\r\nmen to the Sudreyar to Rögnvald, Gudröd’s son, the King of the Sudreyar.\r\nGudröd’s mother was Ingibiorg, daughter of Earl Hákon, Paul’s son. King\r\nRögnvald was the greatest warrior then in the western lands. Three\r\nwinters he had been out in war-ships without coming under a sooty\r\nrafter. When this message came to Rögnvald, he collected an army from\r\nall the kingdom of the Sudreyar and from Satiri (Kintyre). He had also a\r\nlarge army from Ireland. Then he went north to Caithness, took\r\npossession of the whole of the territory, and remained there some time.\r\nEarl Harald kept in the Orkneys, and took no heed of the King’s\r\nmovements. Towards winter King Rögnvald prepared to go home to his\r\ndominions in the Sudreyar. He left three stewards (sýslumenn) over\r\nCaithness. One was Máni, Olaf’s son; the second Rafn, the lawman; and\r\nthe third, Hlífólf Alli. Some time after, King Rögnvald returned to the\r\nSudreyar. Earl Harald sent a man over to Ness (Caithness), saying that\r\nhe would consider his journey a lucky one if he could kill any of the\r\nstewards or all of them. This man was brought across the Pentland Firth,\r\nand he went on till he came to Lawman Rafn. Rafn asked him where he was\r\ngoing, and he had little to say in reply. Rafn said: “I can see in you\r\nthat Earl Harald has sent you over here for some evil purpose, but I\r\nhave not the heart to slay you, because you are my kinsman.” Thus they\r\nparted, and he went away to Hlífólf, and their intercourse ended in\r\nHlífólf’s murder. Then he fled to the Orkneys to Earl Harald, and told\r\nhim what he had done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER CXV\r\n\r\n                      HARALD TORTURES THE BISHOP.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW Earl Harald prepared to leave the Orkneys, and when he was quite\r\nready he went first to Thórsá, and landed from his ships there. The\r\nBishop was in the borg at Skárabólstad (Scrabster). When the\r\nCaithnessmen saw Earl Harald’s army, they perceived it was so numerous\r\nthat they had no chance to withstand them. They were told also that the\r\nEarl was in such an evil temper that there was no knowing what he might\r\ndo. Then the Bishop took speech, and said: “If our dealings turn out\r\nwell, he will give you peace.”[455] They did as the Bishop told them.\r\nThe Earl’s men rushed from the ships up to the borg. The Bishop went to\r\nmeet the Earl, and saluted him with bland words, but their dealing\r\nturned out in this way, that Earl Harald had the Bishop seized, his\r\ntongue cut out, and then he caused a knife to be thrust into his eyes,\r\nand blinded him. Bishop Jón prayed to the holy virgin Tröllhæna during\r\nhis torture, and then he went on a certain bank, when they let him go.\r\nThere was a woman on the bank, and the Bishop asked her to help him. She\r\nsaw that blood was flowing from his face, and said: “Be silent, my lord,\r\nand I shall willingly help you.” The Bishop was brought to the\r\nresting-place of the holy Tröllhæna,[456] and there he recovered both\r\nhis speech and sight.\r\n\r\nEarl Harald went up to the borg, and it was immediately surrendered to\r\nhim.[457] He proceeded at once to punish the inhabitants severely, and\r\nimposed heavy fines on those whom he considered most guilty of treachery\r\nto him; and he made all the Caithnessmen acknowledge him by oath as\r\ntheir lord, whether they liked it or not. Then he took possession of all\r\nthe property belonging to the stewards, who had fled to the King of\r\nScots. Then Earl Harald resided in Caithness with many men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER CXVI\r\n\r\n                            OF THE STEWARDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW it is to be told of the stewards (sýslumenn) that they went six\r\ntogether to Scotland, and saw the King during Advent. They were able to\r\ngive particular intelligence of everything that had happened in\r\nCaithness during Earl Harald’s stay there. The King was highly enraged\r\nat hearing the news, but he said he would pay back double to those who\r\nhad lost their own. The first day they stayed with the King twenty-five\r\nells of cloth and an English mark in ready money was given to each of\r\nthem. They spent the Yule-tide with the King, and were well treated.\r\n\r\nAfter Yule-tide the King sent word to all the chiefs in his kingdom, and\r\ncollected a large army throughout the country, and with all these troops\r\nhe went down to Caithness against Earl Harald. With this great army he\r\npursued his journey till he came to Eysteinsdal,[458] where Caithness\r\nand Sutherland meet. The camp of the King of Scots stretched far along\r\nthe valleys.\r\n\r\nEarl Harald was in Caithness when he heard the news, and he drew troops\r\ntogether immediately. It is said he obtained six thousand men, and yet\r\nhe had no chance to withstand the King of Scots. Then he sent men to him\r\nto sue for peace. When this request was brought before the King, he said\r\nit was no use asking for peace unless he had every fourth penny that was\r\nto be found in all the land of Caithness.\r\n\r\nWhen the Earl received this message, he called together the inhabitants\r\nand chiefs, and consulted with them. As, however, they had no means of\r\nresisting, it was agreed that the Caithnessmen should pay one-fourth of\r\nall their property to the King of Scots, except those men who had gone\r\nto see the King in winter. Earl Harald went out to the Orkneys, and was\r\nto have Caithness as he had it before it was given to Earl Harald Ungi\r\nby the King of Scots. Thorfinn, the son of Earl Harald, who was a\r\nhostage with the King of Scots, was blinded during these hostilities.\r\n\r\nWhen peace had been made, the King returned to Scotland. Earl Harald was\r\nnow the sole ruler of the Orkneys. In the later part of the days of Earl\r\nHarald, his brother-in-law, Olaf, and Jón, Hallkell’s son, raised a\r\nparty in the Orkneys, and went east to Norway against King Sverrir. They\r\nmade Sigurd, the son of King Magnus, Erling’s son, their King. Many men\r\nof noble birth in the Orkneys joined this party, and it was very strong.\r\nThey were for a while called Eyjarskeggiar (Islanders) or Gullbeinir\r\n(goldenlegs). They fought with King Sverrir in Flóruvogar, and were\r\nbeaten.[459] Both Jón and Olaf were killed, as also their King, and most\r\nof their men. After this King Sverrir became a great enemy of Earl\r\nHarald, laying it to his charge that he was the cause of the party being\r\nraised. At last Earl Harald went from the west, and Bishop Bjarni went\r\nalong with him. The Earl left his case without reservation to the\r\ndecision of King Sverrir. Then King Sverrir took all Hjaltland from Earl\r\nHarald, with its taxes (scat) and dues, as a fine; and the Earls of\r\nOrkney have never had it since.[460]\r\n\r\nEarl Harald was five winters old when he was made Earl, and for twenty\r\nwinters he and Earl Rögnvald were together Earls of Orkney. After Earl\r\nRögnvald’s death, he was forty-eight winters Earl of Orkney, and he died\r\nin the second year of the reign of King Ingi, Bard’s son.[461] Earl\r\nHarald’s sons, Jón and David, succeeded him; and Heinrek, his son, had\r\nRoss in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe following have been the most powerful of the Earls of Orkney,\r\naccording to the relation of those who have made histories of\r\nthem:—Sigurd, Eystein’s son; Earl Thorfinn, Sigurd’s son; and Earl\r\nHarald, Maddad’s son.\r\n\r\nThe brothers Jón and David ruled the land after their father, until\r\nDavid died from disease, the same year as Hákon Galinn died in\r\nNorway.[462] After that Jón took the title of Earl of all the Orkneys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER CXVII\r\n\r\n                      THE BURNING OF BISHOP ADAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN Bishop Jón, he who was maimed by the order of Earl Harald, died in\r\nCaithness, a man who was called Adam was made Bishop in his stead. None\r\nknew his family, because when a child he was found at the door of a\r\ncertain church. The Caithnessmen found him rather exacting in his\r\noffice, and blamed a certain monk who was with him chiefly for that. It\r\nwas an ancient custom that the Bishop should receive a spann[463] of\r\nbutter of every twenty cows. Every Bondi in Caithness had to pay this—he\r\nmore who had more cows, and he who had fewer less, and so in proportion.\r\nBishop Adam wished to increase the impost, and demanded a spann of every\r\nfifteen cows; and when that was obtained, he demanded it of twelve; and\r\nwhen this too was conceded, he demanded it of ten. But this was thought\r\nby all men most unreasonable.\r\n\r\nThen the Caithnessmen went to see Earl Jón, who was then in Caithness,\r\nand they complained of this before the Earl. He said he would have\r\nnothing to do with it, adding that the case was not a difficult one.\r\nThere were two alternatives: this was not to be endured, yet he would\r\nnot say what the other might be.\r\n\r\nBishop Adam was at Há Kirkia,[464] in Thorsdal, and Earl Jón was a short\r\ndistance off. The Caithnessmen held a meeting on a hill above the\r\nvillage where the Bishop was. Lawman Rafn was with the Bishop, and\r\nbegged him to spare the inhabitants, saying that otherwise he feared the\r\nconsequences. The Bishop asked him to be of good cheer, saying that the\r\nBœndr (farmers) would become quiet of their own accord. Then a man was\r\nsent to Earl Jón, requesting him to make peace between them and the\r\nBishop. But the Earl would not meddle with the matter at all. Then the\r\nBœndr ran down from the hill in great excitement, and when Lawman Rafn\r\nsaw it he warned the Bishop to take care of himself. The Bishop and his\r\nfriends were drinking in a loft there, and when the Bœndr arrived the\r\nmonk went to the door, and he was immediately hewn across the face, and\r\nfell back into the room dead. When the Bishop heard it, he said: “This\r\ndid not happen sooner than might have been expected, for his\r\ninterference in our transactions has generally been unfortunate.” Then\r\nRafn asked the Bishop to tell the Bœndr that he was willing to come to\r\nan agreement with them; and when they heard it, all the wiser men among\r\nthem were very glad. Then the Bishop went out to make an arrangement\r\nwith them; but when he was seen by the more wicked ones, who were most\r\nfurious, they seized the Bishop, brought him into a small house, and set\r\nfire to it, and the house burnt so quickly that those who wished to save\r\nthe Bishop could not do anything. Bishop Adam perished there.[465] His\r\nbody was not much burnt when it was found. Then the body was buried\r\nsuitably and honourably; but those who had been the best friends of the\r\nBishop sent men to the King of Scots. Alexander, son of the holy King\r\nWilliam, was then King of Scotland. When he heard the tidings, he became\r\nso enraged that the punishments inflicted by him for the burning of the\r\nBishop, by mutilation and death, confiscation and outlawry from the\r\nland, are still in fresh memory.\r\n\r\nAnd now we cannot relate more distinctly than we have here done the\r\nevents concerning the Earls of Orkney.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n                                -------\r\n\r\n                      SAGA OF OLAF, TRYGGVI’S SON.\r\n\r\n                       (_From the Flateyjarbók._)\r\n\r\n\r\n            THE DOMINIONS OF KING HARALD AND EARL RÖGNVALD.\r\n\r\n\r\n179. Earl Rögnvald assisted Harald Harfagri (fair-haired) to conquer the\r\ncountry (Norway), and he gave him the revenues of both Mœri and\r\nRaumsdal. Rögnvald had married Ragnhild, the daughter of Hrólf Nefia\r\n(nose). They had a son named Hrólf, who conquered Normandy. Hrólf was so\r\nbig that no horse could carry him, and he was therefore called\r\nGönguhrólf (Hrólf the walker). From him the Earls of Rúda (Rouen) and\r\nthe Kings of England are descended. They had two other sons, Ivar and\r\nEarl Thórir Thegiandi (the silent). Rögnvald had also sons by his\r\nconcubines. They were Hallad, Hrollaug, and Einar, who was the youngest.\r\nOne summer Harald Harfagri went to the west across the sea to punish the\r\nVikings, as he was weary of their devastations. They plundered in Norway\r\nduring the summer, and spent the winters in Hjaltland or the Orkneys.\r\nHarald subdued Hjaltland, the Orkneys, and the Sudreyar (Hebrides). He\r\nwent west as far as the Isle of Man, and destroyed all the dwellings in\r\nMan. He fought many battles there, and extended his dominion so far to\r\nthe west that none of the Kings of Norway since his time has had wider\r\ndominions. In one of these battles, Ivar, the son of Earl Rögnvald,\r\nfell. So when King Harald sailed from the west he gave Hjaltland and the\r\nOrkneys to Earl Rögnvald as a compensation for [the loss of] his son;\r\nbut Earl Rögnvald gave the Islands to his brother Sigurd, who was King\r\nHarald’s forecastleman; and the King gave him the title of Earl before\r\nhe left the west. Sigurd remained out in the west.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     EARL MELBRIGD SLAIN BY SIGURD.\r\n\r\n\r\n180. Earl Sigurd became a great chief. He formed an alliance with\r\nThorstein the Red, son of Olaf the White, and Aud Djúpaudga (the very\r\nwealthy), and together they conquered all Caithness and much more of\r\nScotland—Mærhæfui (Moray) and Ross. He built a borg on the southern\r\nborder of Mærhæfui. Melbrigd Tönn (tooth), an Earl of the Scots, and\r\nEarl Sigurd, made an arrangement to meet in a certain place, with forty\r\nmen each, in order to come to an agreement concerning their differences.\r\nWhen the appointed day arrived Earl Sigurd was suspicious of treachery\r\non the part of the Scots. He therefore caused eighty men to be mounted\r\non forty horses. When Earl Melbrigd saw this, he said to his men:—“Now\r\nwe have been treacherously dealt with by Earl Sigurd, for I see two\r\nmen’s legs on one side of each horse, and the men, I believe, are thus\r\ntwice as many as the beasts. But let us be brave, and kill each his man\r\nbefore we die.” Then they made themselves ready. When Sigurd saw it, he\r\nalso decided on his plan, and said to his men:—“Now, let one-half of our\r\nnumber dismount and attack them from behind, when the troops meet, while\r\nwe shall ride at them with all our speed to break their battle array.”\r\nThere was hard fighting immediately, and it was not long till Earl\r\nMelbrigd fell, and all his men with him. Earl Sigurd and his men\r\nfastened the heads [of the slain] to their saddle-straps, in bravado,\r\nand so they rode home triumphing in their victory. As they were\r\nproceeding, Earl Sigurd, intending to kick at his horse with his foot,\r\nstruck the calf of his leg against a tooth protruding from Earl\r\nMelbrigd’s head, which scratched him slightly; but it soon became\r\nswollen and painful, and he died of it. Sigurd the powerful was buried\r\nin a mound at Ekkialsbakki.[466]\r\n\r\nSigurd’s son was named Guthorm. He reigned one winter, and died\r\nchildless.\r\n\r\nWhen Earl Rögnvald heard of the death of Earl Sigurd and his son, he\r\nsent his son Hallad out to the west, and King Harald gave him the title\r\nof Earl. Hallad came out to the west, and took up his residence in\r\nHrossey,[467] but Vikings went prowling about the islands and outlying\r\nheadlands, slaying men and seizing booty. The Bœndr complained of their\r\nlosses to Earl Hallad, but they thought he did not get them much redress\r\nfor their wrongs. Then Hallad grew tired of the dignity, and resigned\r\nthe earldom, took up his odal rights, and returned to Norway, and his\r\njourney was regarded as a very ignominious one.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      EINAR COMES TO THE ISLANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n181. Two Danish Vikings took up their quarters in the Islands; one of\r\nthem was called Thórir Tréskegg (wooden beard), the other Kálf Skurfa\r\n(scurf). When Earl Rögnvald heard this he became very angry, and called\r\nhis sons Thórir and Hrollaug. Hrólf was at that time on a war\r\nexpedition. Rögnvald asked which of them would go to the Islands. Thórir\r\nsaid he would follow his advice.\r\n\r\nThe Earl replied: “I foresee that your power will be greatest here; and\r\nyour ways do not lead from home.”\r\n\r\nHrollaug said: “Father, would you like me to go?”\r\n\r\nThe Earl replied: “It will never be your fortune to become an Earl. Your\r\nway lies towards Iceland. There you will increase your family, and it\r\nwill be a noble one.”\r\n\r\nThen Einar, his youngest son, came forward and said: “Would you like me\r\nto go to the Islands? One thing I will promise, which will be very\r\nacceptable to you—viz. that I shall never more come into your presence;\r\nlittle honour do I enjoy at home, and it is hardly likely that my\r\nsuccess will be less elsewhere than it is here.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl said: “You are not likely to become a chief, on account of your\r\nbirth, for all your kin on the mother’s side are thrall-born; but it is\r\ntrue that the sooner you go and the longer you stay the more agreeable\r\nit will be to me.” Earl Rögnvald gave him a fully-equipped vessel, with\r\ntwenty benches, and King Harald gave him the title of Earl.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE VIKINGS SLAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n182. Einar sailed to Hjaltland, and there many men gathered round him.\r\nThen he went to the Orkneys to meet Kálf Skurfa and Thórir Tréskegg.\r\nThere was a great battle, and both the Vikings were killed. This was\r\nsaid about it:\r\n\r\n                     Tré-skegg gave he to the Trows:\r\n                     Skurfa fell before Torf-Einar.\r\n\r\nThen Einar took possession of the lands, and soon became a great chief.\r\nHe was the man who first cut turf (peat) from the ground for fuel at\r\nTorfnes in Scotland, for fuel was scarce in the Islands. Einar was a\r\ntall man, ugly, and with one eye, yet he was very keen-sighted.\r\n\r\n\r\n             BATTLE BETWEEN EARL EINAR AND PRINCE HALFDAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n183. When the sons of Harald Harfagri grew up they became men of great\r\nviolence and turbulence, as has been told before. The sons of Snæfríd,\r\nHálfdán Hálegg (high legs) and Gudröd Liomi (splendour) killed Rögnvald,\r\nEarl of Mœri. King Harald became very angry at this, and Hálfdán had to\r\nflee over seas to the west, but Gudröd became reconciled to his father.\r\nWhen Hálfdán Hálegg came to the Orkneys, Earl Einar fled from the\r\nIslands to Scotland, and Hálfdán became King over the Islands. Earl\r\nEinar came back during the same year, and when they met there was a\r\ngreat battle, in which Einar had the victory, and Hálfdán fled away.\r\nEinar sang this song:\r\n\r\n                 Why are not the spear-shafts flying,\r\n                 From the hands of Hrólf and Hrollaug,\r\n                 Thickly ’gainst the press of warriors?\r\n                 Now, my father! I avenge thee.\r\n                 While we here are closed in battle,\r\n                 Sits Earl Thórir all the evening,\r\n                 Silent o’er his cheerless drink.\r\n\r\nNext morning they found Hálfdán Hálegg on Rinar’s Hill. The Earl made a\r\nblood eagle be cut on his back with the sword, and had his ribs severed\r\nfrom the back-bone, and his lungs pulled out. Thus he gave him to Odinn\r\nas an offering for victory, and sang this song:\r\n\r\n                 Oft it is that bearded men\r\n                 Are guilty deemed for taking sheep;\r\n                 But my offence is that I slew\r\n                 The young son of the Islands’ king.\r\n                 Men may say that danger waits me\r\n                 From the great king’s speedy vengeance;\r\n                 But his wrath shall never daunt me,\r\n                 In whose shield I’ve made a dint.\r\n\r\nThen he had a cairn raised over him, and sang this song:\r\n\r\n                  Vengeance for my father’s death\r\n                  I have ta’en for my fourth share.\r\n                  In him the people’s champion fell;\r\n                  But it was the Norns’ decree.\r\n                  Heap we now a cairn o’er High-leg,\r\n                  Thus the hard skatt we shall pay him\r\n                  Which as victors we are due him.\r\n                  Let the wise to me now listen.\r\n\r\nWhen this was heard in Norway his brothers became greatly enraged, and\r\nthreatened an expedition to the Islands to avenge him, but Harald\r\ndelayed their journey. When Earl Einar heard of their threats, he sang:\r\n\r\n                 Men of no ignoble birth\r\n                 Are they who, from my native land,\r\n                 Seek my life for vengeance’ sake;\r\n                 But the truth is, that they know not,\r\n                 Till their swords have surely slain me,\r\n                 Whom the eagles’ claws shall rend.\r\n\r\nSome time afterwards King Harald set out for the western seas, and came\r\nto the Islands. Einar fled from the Islands to Caithness. Then men went\r\nbetween them, and they made peace. King Harald imposed a fine upon the\r\nIslands, adjudging them to pay sixty marks of gold. Earl Einar offered\r\n[to the Bœndr] to pay the money himself, on condition that he should\r\nbecome proprietor of all their freeholds. The Bœndr accepted this,\r\nbecause the wealthy men thought they might redeem their freeholds, and\r\nthe poorer men had no money. Einar paid the whole sum, and for a long\r\ntime afterwards the Earls held all the odal lands, until Earl Sigurd\r\ngave back their odal possessions to the Orkneymen. King Harald went back\r\nto Norway, but Earl Einar ruled over the Orkneys a long time, and died\r\non a sick-bed. He had three sons: one was named Arnkell, the second\r\nErlend, and the third Thorfinn Hausakliuf (skull-splitter).\r\n\r\nWhen Harald Harfagri died, Eirík Blódöx (bloody-axe) was King for two\r\nwinters. Then Hakon, Athelstan’s foster son, came to the land, and Eirík\r\nfled. Arnkell and Erlend, the sons of Torf Einar, fell with Eirík Blódöx\r\nin England. Gunnhild and her sons then went to the Orkneys, and took\r\npossession of them, and stayed there for a time. From thence they went\r\nto Denmark, but before they went away they married Ragnhild, the\r\ndaughter of Gunnhild and Eirík, to Arnfinn, the son of Earl Thorfinn\r\n[Hausakliuf], and Earl Thorfinn took up his residence in the Islands: he\r\nwas a great and warlike chief. He died on a sick-bed, and was buried in\r\na mound on Hauga Heath,[468] in Rögnvaldsey, and was considered to have\r\nbeen a great man.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE MURDER OF HAVARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n184. Thorfinn had five sons. One was named Hávard Arsæli (blessed with\r\ngood seasons), the second Hlödver, the third Liót, the fourth Skúli, and\r\nthe fifth Arnfinn. Ragnhild, the daughter of Eirík, killed her husband\r\nArnfinn at Myrkhol (Murkle), in Caithness, and then she married Hávard\r\nArsæli, his brother. He became Earl, and was a good chief, and blessed\r\nwith good seasons. There was a man named Einar Klíning (buttered bread),\r\nthe son of Hávard’s sister. He was a great chief, and had many men, and\r\nwent usually on war expeditions during the summer. He accepted an\r\ninvitation from Hávard, and at that feast he and Ragnhild talked much\r\ntogether. She said that it was more suitable that such a man as he\r\nshould be chief and Earl than Hávard his kinsman, adding that the woman\r\nwas well married who had him for a husband. Einar told her not to speak\r\nof such things, saying that Hávard was the noblest man in the Islands,\r\nand that she was well matched. Ragnhild replied: “Hávard and I shall not\r\nbe long together after this. But it is true that men will be found in\r\nthe Islands who will not stick at trifles if you grudge me the dignity.”\r\nBy her persuasion Einar was moved to covetousness and treachery against\r\nhis kinsman. They agreed that he should kill the Earl, and that she\r\nshould marry him. Some time after Einar prepared to take out his men,\r\nbut a certain spaeman who was with him said: “Do not engage in this\r\nbusiness to-day; wait till to-morrow, or else family murders will be\r\nfrequent in your family.” Einar pretended not to hear this. At this time\r\nHávard was at Steinsness,[469] in Hrossey. There they met, and there was\r\nhard fighting, and it was not long till the Earl fell. The place is now\r\ncalled Hávard’s teigar.[470] When this became known, Einar was\r\nconsidered a great nithing[471] for the deed. Ragnhild would have\r\nnothing to do with him, saying it was a mere lie that she had given him\r\nany promises. Then she sent for Einar Hardkiöpt (hard mouth), who was\r\nthe son of another sister of Hávard. And when they met, she said it was\r\na great shame to Hávard’s kinsmen that they did not avenge him, adding\r\nthat she would do anything that the Earl might be avenged. “It is\r\nevident,” she said, “that he who avenges the Earl will be most esteemed\r\nby good people, and will most deserve his dominions.” Einar replied: “It\r\nis said that you sometimes speak differently from what you think. But he\r\nwho does this deed will expect in return that you will help him to the\r\ndominions, as well as to other things which he will consider not less\r\nimportant.” This was the end of their talk. After this Einar Hardkiöpt\r\nwent to Einar Klíning and killed him. But Ragnhild sent for their\r\nbrother Liót, and married him. Liót became Earl, and was a great chief.\r\nNow Einar Hardkiöpt had killed his kinsman, and was not any nearer the\r\nearldom than before. He was highly dissatisfied, and wished to collect\r\nmen together and subdue the Islands by force. He had great difficulty in\r\ngetting men, for the Orkneymen wished to serve the sons of Thorfinn\r\nHausakliuf. Some time afterwards the Earl had Einar Hardkiöpt slain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     BATTLE BETWEEN LIOT AND SKULI.\r\n\r\n\r\n185. Skúli, the brother of Liót, went to Scotland, and had an Earl’s\r\ntitle given him by the King of Scots. Then he went down to Caithness,\r\nand collected forces together; from thence he went to the Islands, and\r\nfought with his brother for the dominion of them. Liót collected a\r\nnumerous army, and went against Skúli. When they met, Skúli would\r\nnothing but fight. There was a severely contested battle. Liót gained\r\nthe victory, and Skúli fled over to Ness (Caithness). Liót pursued him,\r\nstayed there for a while, and got many men together. Then Skúli came\r\ndown from Scotland with a large army, and met Liót at Dalir (Dale), in\r\nCaithness, and a great battle ensued. Skúli had a large army given him\r\nby the King of Scots and Earl Magbiód.[472] In the beginning of the\r\nbattle the Scots fought hotly. Earl Liót told his men to act on the\r\ndefensive, and to stand firm; and when the Scots could not make any\r\nimpression on them, Liót incited his men, and fought very fiercely\r\nhimself. When this had been going on for some time, the array of the\r\nScots was broken, and then they fled; but Skúli continued the battle,\r\nand was ultimately killed. Liót took possession of Caithness, and he and\r\nthe Scots were at war, because they were vexed at their defeat. When\r\nEarl Liót was in Caithness, Earl Magbiód came down from Scotland with a\r\nlarge army, and they met at Skida-mire (Skitten), in Caithness. Although\r\nEarl Liót’s forces were not equal to those of the Scots, he fought so\r\nbravely that the Scots gave way, and the battle had not continued long\r\nwhen those of the Scots who were left alive fled, and many of them were\r\nwounded. Liót returned from the pursuit victorious, but with many men\r\nwounded, and he himself had received wounds, of which he died.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BATTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n186. Hlödver was Earl after Liót, and became a great chief. He married\r\nAudna, the daughter of Kiarval, the King of the Ivar.[473] Their son was\r\nSigurd the stout. Hlödver died on a sick-bed, and was buried at Hofn\r\n(Huna), in Caithness. His son Sigurd succeeded him, and became a great\r\nchief, with extensive possessions. He kept Caithness by main force from\r\nthe Scots, and went every summer on war expeditions to the Sudreyar\r\n(Hebrides), Scotland, and Ireland. One summer Finnleik, an Earl of the\r\nScots, challenged Sigurd to meet him at Skida-mire on a certain day; but\r\nSigurd went to consult his mother, who was a wise woman. The Earl told\r\nher that the difference in numbers would not be less than seven to one.\r\nShe replied: “I should have reared thee up long in my wool-bag if I had\r\nknown that thou wouldst wish to live for ever. It is fate that rules\r\nlife, and not the place where a man may go. It is better to die with\r\nhonour than live with shame. Take thou here this banner which I have\r\nmade with all my skill, and I ween that it will bring victory to him\r\nbefore whom it is borne, but death to its bearer.” The banner was\r\nwrought with cunningly executed handiwork and elaborate art. It was made\r\nin the shape of a raven, and when floating in the wind it resembled the\r\nraven flying. Earl Sigurd was very wroth at his mother’s words. He\r\nrestored their odal rights to the Orkneymen to induce them to assist\r\nhim, and went to meet Earl Finnleik at Skida-mire, where they both\r\nplaced their men in battle array. When the forces met, Earl Sigurd’s\r\nstandard-bearer was killed by an arrow. The Earl ordered another to bear\r\nthe banner, and when they had fought for a while he also fell. Three\r\nstandard-bearers were killed, but the Earl gained the victory, and the\r\nOrkneymen regained their freeholds.\r\n\r\n\r\n           MEETING BETWEEN OLAF (TRYGGVI’S SON) AND THE EARL.\r\n\r\n\r\n187. Olaf, Tryggvi’s son, sailed west to the Orkneys, as has been\r\nmentioned before. But as the Pentland Firth was not to be passed at the\r\ntime, he moored his ships in Asmundarvag (Osmondwall) opposite\r\nRögnvaldsey. Earl Sigurd, Hlödver’s son, was there before him with three\r\nships, for he was going on a war expedition. When King Olaf became aware\r\nthat the Earl was there, he called him into his presence. But when the\r\nEarl came to the King’s ship, the King spoke as follows:—\r\n\r\n“You know, Earl Sigurd, that Harald Harfagri came here to the west with\r\nan army when he had obtained possession of all Norway. King Harald\r\nconquered the Orkneys and Hjaltland, and many other lands here in the\r\nwest. The King gave the Islands to Rögnvald the Powerful as a\r\ncompensation for his son, but Rögnvald gave them to his brother Sigurd,\r\nand he became the Earl of King Harald. King Harald went a second time\r\nagainst Earl Einar with a large army; but well-disposed men mediated\r\nbetween them, and they agreed to the following terms:—The King claimed\r\nall the Orkneys and Hjaltland as his own; and the result of their\r\nnegotiations was that the Earl paid the King sixty marks of gold for the\r\nmurder of his son, Halfdan Hálegg, and Earl Einar then held the lands\r\nfrom King Harald. Shortly afterwards, King Eirík, Harald’s son, came\r\nfrom Norway. Then also the Earls, the sons of Torfeinar, were his\r\nvassals. This appears from the fact that they gave him many men for his\r\nwar expeditions. When King Eirík came to the Islands a second time, he\r\ntook away with him the two Earls, Arnkell and Erlend, and appointed\r\ntheir brother Thorfinn to rule over the land. They were both killed in\r\nEngland with King Eirík. Then the sons of Eirík came from England and\r\nruled over the Islands, and when they departed they appointed Arnfinn,\r\ntheir brother-in-law, ruler of the Islands. Havard first succeeded his\r\nbrother (Arnfinn), then Liót, and lastly your father, Hlödver. Now you,\r\nSigurd, are Earl over these lands which I claim as my possessions, with\r\nall other lands possessed by Harald Harfagri and his kinsmen, and\r\ndescending from them to me by inheritance from generation to generation.\r\nYou know that most of the sons of Eirík and Gunnhild have now been\r\nkilled. And although their sister Ragnhild is still alive, it seems to\r\nme that she has been guilty of such wickedness in the Orkneys that she\r\nought not to have dignity or power anywhere; indeed, my view is that she\r\nhas completely forfeited both property and life if it be true that she\r\nhas done all the shameful deeds that are reported of her, and generally\r\nbelieved. Now, since it has so happened, Earl Sigurd, that you have come\r\ninto my power, you have to choose between two very unequal alternatives.\r\nOne is, that you embrace the true faith, become my man, and be baptized\r\nwith all your subjects. In that case you may have certain hope of honour\r\nfrom me. You shall hold in full liberty as my subject, and with the\r\ndignity of an Earl, all the dominions which you have had before. And\r\nbesides, you will gain what is much more important—namely, to reign in\r\neternal joy in the kingdom of Heaven with the Almighty God. Of this you\r\nmay be sure if you keep his commandments. The other alternative is a\r\nvery hard one, and quite unlike the former—viz. that you shall be slain\r\non the spot, and after your death I will send fire and sword throughout\r\nthe Orkneys, burning homesteads and men, unless this people is willing\r\nto accept immunity by believing in the true God. And if you and your\r\nsubjects choose the latter alternative, you and they, who put your trust\r\nin idols, shall speedily die, and shall thereafter be tormented in\r\nhell-fire, with wicked devils, without end.”\r\n\r\nWhen Earl Sigurd had listened to King Olaf’s long and eloquent harangue,\r\nhe hardened his mind against him, and said: “I will tell you, King Olaf,\r\nthat I have absolutely resolved that I will not, and I dare not,\r\nrenounce the faith which my kinsmen and forefathers had before me,\r\nbecause I do not know better counsels than they, and I do not know that\r\nthe faith which you preach is better than that which we have had and\r\nhave held all our lives.”\r\n\r\nWhen the King saw that the Earl persisted obstinately in his error, he\r\ncaught hold of his young son, who was with him, and who had been brought\r\nup in the Islands. The King carried this son of the Earl to the forepart\r\nof the ship. There he drew his sword, and made ready to hew the boy\r\ndown, saying at the same time: “Now I will show you, Earl Sigurd, that I\r\nshall spare no man who will not serve Almighty God, or listen to my\r\npreaching of the blessed message. Therefore I shall kill your son before\r\nyour eyes this instant, with the sword now in my hand, unless you and\r\nyour men will serve my God. For I shall not leave these Islands until I\r\nhave completely fulfilled his blessed commission, and you have been\r\nbaptized along with this son of yours whom I now hold.”\r\n\r\nAnd because the Earl was situated as he was, he chose the better\r\nalternative of doing as the King desired, and so he embraced the true\r\nfaith. Then the Earl was baptized, and so were all the people of the\r\nOrkneys. Then Earl Sigurd became the Earl of King Olaf according to this\r\nworld’s dignity, and held from him lands and dominions, and gave him as\r\na hostage his son who has already been mentioned. His name was Hvelp or\r\nHundi (whelp or hound). King Olaf had him baptized by the name of\r\nHlödver, and took him with him to Norway. Earl Sigurd confirmed all\r\ntheir agreement with oaths. After this King Olaf sailed from the\r\nOrkneys, leaving priests to instruct the people in the holy faith. King\r\nOlaf and Earl Sigurd parted friends. Hlödver lived but a short time, and\r\nafter his death Earl Sigurd paid no homage to King Olaf.

We have no estimate of the\r\n  number in Shetland, but there also they are very numerous. Not less\r\n  remarkable is the number of the early “dwellings of strength,” of\r\n  which Mousa is the type—huge edifices, constructed with amazing labour\r\n  and wonderful skill. (See under Maeshow and Mousa.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  The Frisic Sea is supposed to mean the Firth of Forth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  The “Historia Britonum” of Nennius (whoever he may have been) is\r\n  believed, on what seems reliable evidence, to have been written about\r\n  A.D. 858. (See the Irish Nennius, Irish Archæological Society, p. 18.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Ireland was then called Scotia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  St. Ninian was commemorated at Dunrossness in Shetland (Sibbald’s\r\n  Description, 1711, p. 15); at Stove in South Ronaldsay, Orkney\r\n  (Peterkin’s Rentals, No. III.); at the north head of the bay of Wick\r\n  in Caithness; and at Navidale in Sutherland. St. Columba’s three\r\n  chapels in South Ronaldsay were at Grymness, Hopay, and Loch of\r\n  Burwick (Peterkin’s Rentals, No. III. p. 86). There were also\r\n  dedications to St. Columba in the islands of Sanday and Hoy in Orkney,\r\n  at Olrig and Dirlet in Caithness, on Island Comb, at Tongue, and at\r\n  Kilcalmkill in Sutherlandshire (Bishop Forbes’s Calendar of Scottish\r\n  Saints). St. Triduana, whose name has been corrupted into St. Tredwell\r\n  and St. Trudlin (the Tröllhæna of the Saga), had dedications in Papa\r\n  Westray in Orkney (Martin’s and Brand’s Descriptions), and at\r\n  Kintradwell in Sutherlandshire. It seems also, from the narrative of\r\n  Bishop John’s mutilation in the Saga, that there was a dedication to\r\n  her near Thurso. St. Brigid had chapels in Stronsay and Papa Stronsay\r\n  in Orkney. But it is impossible to tell how many of these early\r\n  religious sites had similar dedications, as scarcely a tithe of those\r\n  that are known have preserved their names. Brand and Sibbald both\r\n  mention the fact that in their time there were still recognisable the\r\n  sites of 24 chapels in the island of Unst, 21 in the island of Yell,\r\n  10 or 11 in the island of Fetlar: 55 religious foundations in the\r\n  three most northerly islands of the Shetland group. The Christian\r\n  period of the Norse occupation is marked by dedications showing the\r\n  influence of the Crusades or of the national religious feeling. The\r\n  dedications to the Holy Cross, St. Mary, St. Peter, St. Lawrence, St.\r\n  Olaf, and St. Magnus, are probably all of this period.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  Unfortunately, the readings of these inscriptions which have been\r\n  attempted are far from satisfactory. The Shetland and Orkney specimens\r\n  are in different styles of the Ogham writing, and the whole subject of\r\n  the reading and interpretation of the inscriptions in this character\r\n  is beset with difficulties of no ordinary kind. One rendering of the\r\n  Bressay inscription makes it “the cross of Natdod’s daughter here,”\r\n  and on the other edge of the stone, “Benres of the sons of the Druids\r\n  here;” while the language is supposed to be a mixture of Celtic and\r\n  Icelandic. (Sculptured Stones of Scotland, vol. i. p. 30.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  Sculptured Stones of Scotland (Spalding Club), by John Stuart, LL.D.,\r\n  _passim_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  Sir James Simpson’s reading of the inscription, given in the\r\n  Sculptured Stones of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 71.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  In Orkney we have the islands of Papa Westray and Papa Stronsay (the\r\n  _Papey meiri_ and _Papey minni_, or greater and lesser Papa of the\r\n  Saga), Paplay in South Ronaldsay, Paplay in the parish of Holm, and\r\n  Papdale, near Kirkwall, in the Mainland. In Shetland we have the isles\r\n  of Papa—Papa Stour (_Papey stora_) and Papa Little (_Papey litla_),\r\n  and Papill in the islands of Unst and Yell. Papa Stronsay, Papa\r\n  Westray, and Paplay, in the Mainland of Orkney, are mentioned in the\r\n  Saga. Papa Stour occurs in a deed of A.D. 1229 (Diplom. Norveg. i.\r\n  89), Papill in Unst in a deed of A.D. 1360 (Ibid. iii. 310), and a\r\n  “Sigurdr of Pappley” is mentioned in the agreement between Bishop\r\n  William of Orkney and Hakon Jonson, May 25, 1369 (Ibid. i. 404).\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  There is a cairn in Sanday called Ivar’s Knowe, which may be his\r\n  burial mound.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  Olaf Tryggvason’s Saga, Flateyjarbók, chap. 180, in the Appendix; and\r\n  Ynglinga Saga, Heimskringla, chap. 22. Earl Sigurd’s grave-mound, on\r\n  the estuary of the Oykel (Ekkialsbakki), was known in the 12th century\r\n  as _Siwardhoch_, or Sigurd’s How, and is still identifiable in the\r\n  modern Cyderhall.

In this emergency he made a vow as\r\n  follows:—“Thy dog, Apostle Peter, hath run twice to Rome, and he would\r\n  run the third time if thou gavest him leave.” The Irish Chronicle\r\n  states that the full tide in Dublin Bay on the day of the battle\r\n  coincided with sunrise, and that the returning tide in the evening\r\n  aided in the destruction of the defeated foreigners. The date assigned\r\n  by the Chronicle for the battle is Good Friday, 23d April 1014.

So we find in 1312-1319, that King Hakon\r\n  Magnusson grants to the Mary-Kirk in Oslo (Christiania), for the\r\n  completion of the fabric of the kirk, “all our incomes of Hjaltland\r\n  and the Faroes, so that those who have charge of the kirk’s building\r\n  and fabric every year shall render account thereof to our heirs, and\r\n  when the fabric is altogether completed, then shall the foresaid\r\n  revenues of Hjaltland and the Faroes revert to the crown.”\r\n  (Nicolaysen, Norske Fornlevninger, p. 426.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  Chronica Rogeri de Hoveden (Rolls Ed.), iv. pp, 10, 12.\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  In the Chronicle of Melrose, under the date 1175, it is stated that\r\n  “Laurentius, Abbot in Orkney, was made Abbot of Melrose.” But as his\r\n  death is recorded in the year 1178, the priest here mentioned by\r\n  Hoveden must have been a different person, though of the same name. At\r\n  the same time, as this passage shows that Earl Harald had a\r\n  hird-priest named Laurentius, it is not improbable that the so-called\r\n  Orkney abbot, who was made abbot of Melrose, may also have been\r\n  Harald’s family or court priest. Being himself the son of a Scottish\r\n  earl, and allied by marriage first with the family of the Earl of\r\n  Fife, and subsequently with the MacHeths, and having, moreover, such\r\n  close relations with the abbey of Scone, it is not unlikely that he\r\n  may have had Scottish priests about his family in preference to those\r\n  of Norwegian extraction.\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  So says the Saga. Fordun says that the use of his tongue and of one\r\n  eye was in some measure left him. The letter of Pope Innocent,\r\n  addressed to the Bishop of Orkney, prescribing the penance to be\r\n  performed by the man who mutilated the bishop, only mentions the\r\n  cutting out of the tongue. It is as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “We have learnt by your letters that Lomberd, a layman, the bearer of\r\n  these presents, accompanied his earl on an expedition into Caithness;\r\n  that there the Earl’s army stormed a castle, killed almost all who\r\n  were in it, and took prisoner the Bishop of Caithness; and that this\r\n  Lomberd, as he says, was compelled by some of the earl’s soldiery to\r\n  cut out the bishop’s tongue. Now because the sin is great and\r\n  grievous, in absolving him, according to the form of the church, we\r\n  have prescribed this penance for satisfaction of his offence, and to\r\n  the terror of others:—That he shall hasten home, and bare-footed, and\r\n  naked, except breeches, and a short woollen vest without sleeves,\r\n  having his tongue tied by a string, and drawn out so as to project\r\n  beyond his lips, and the ends of the string bound round his neck, with\r\n  rods in his hand, in sight of all men, walk for fifteen days\r\n  successively through his own native district, the district of the\r\n  mutilated bishop, and the neighbouring country; he shall go to the\r\n  door of the church without entering, and there, prostrate on the\r\n  earth, undergo discipline with the rods he is to carry; he is thus to\r\n  spend each day in silence and fasting until evening, when he shall\r\n  support nature with bread and water only; after these fifteen days are\r\n  passed he shall prepare within a month to set out for Jerusalem, and\r\n  there labour in the service of the Cross for three years; he shall\r\n  never more bear arms against Christians; for two years he shall fast\r\n  every Friday on bread and water, unless by the indulgence of some\r\n  discreet bishop, or on account of bodily infirmity, this abstinence be\r\n  mitigated. Do you then receive him returning in this manner, and see\r\n  that he observe the penance enjoined him.” (Epist. Innoc. III. Lib.\r\n  iii. No. 77; Diplom. Norvegicum, vii. 3.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  Chron. de Mailros, p. 114; see also p. lxxxi. _infra_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  Magnus, son of the Earl of Angus, appears among those present at the\r\n  perambulation of the boundaries of the lands of the Abbey of\r\n  Aberbrothock on 16th January 1222 (Regist. Vet. de Aberbrothock, p.\r\n  163); but he seems to have been Earl of Angus as well as of Caithness\r\n  at the date after mentioned. A charter of King Alexander II. to the\r\n  chapel of St. Nicholas at Spey, dated 2d October 1232, is witnessed by\r\n  M. Earl of Angus and Kataness (Regist. Moraviense, p. 123).\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  The title prefixed to the translation of this document by Dean Gule,\r\n  made for William Sinclair of Roslin, in 1554, calls it:—“A Diploma or\r\n  Deduction concerning the Genealogies of the ancient Earls of Orkney,\r\n  drawn up from the most authentic records, by Thomas, Bishop of Orkney,\r\n  with the assistance of his clergy and others, in consequence of an\r\n  order from King Eirik of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, to investigate\r\n  the rights of William Sinclair to the earldom.” But in the document\r\n  itself King Eirik is spoken of as “our former lord of illustrious\r\n  memory,” and the date is evidently erroneous. It is probably to be\r\n  assigned to about 1443. It was first printed by Wallace in 1699, and\r\n  subsequently by Jonæus in the appendix to the Orkneyinga Saga in 1780;\r\n  by Barry in his History of the Orkneys in 1805; in the Bannatyne\r\n  Miscellany, 1848; and by Munch in his Symbolæ, Christiania, 1850.\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n  Among the documents found in the King’s Treasury at Edinburgh in 1282,\r\n  were the letters addressed by the King of Norway (presumably Hakon) to\r\n  the inhabitants of Caithness. The inhabitants of Caithness seem to\r\n  have been also obliged by the Scottish King to give hostages for their\r\n  fealty to him. In the accounts of Laurence Grant, Sheriff of\r\n  Inverness, for the year 1263, there is a charge of £15:6:3 for the\r\n  expenses of twenty-one hostages from Caithness, at the rate of one\r\n  denarius (penny) for each per day for twenty-five weeks, “and then\r\n  they were set at liberty.” (Compota Camerarium Scotiæ, i. p. 31.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 51:\r\n\r\n  Acta Parl.

Club, pp. 110, 282.) Wyntoun says she\r\n  was “put to dede by martyry,” and assigns as the reason that the\r\n  Norwegians would not have one who was of another nation and a female\r\n  to be heir to the throne of Norway, though their laws allowed it. He\r\n  had probably heard the story of the “false Margaret.” (See p. lii.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  In the Wardrobe Rolls of King Edward I. (1290) the following payments\r\n  occur:—“Sept. 1.—To Lord Eli de Hamville going by the king’s orders\r\n  with the Lord Bishop of Durham towards Scotland to meet the messengers\r\n  of the King of Norway and the princess, and was to return with the\r\n  news to the king. To John Tyndale, the messenger from the Bishop of\r\n  St. Andrews, who brought letters from his master to the king\r\n  concerning the rumours of the arrival of the Princess of Scotland in\r\n  Orkney—by gift of the king, xxsh. To William Playfair, messenger of\r\n  the Earl of Orkney, who brought letters to our Lord the King, on the\r\n  part of Lord John Comyn, concerning the reported arrival of the\r\n  Scottish Princess in Orkney—by gift of the king, xiiish. 4d.” There is\r\n  also a detailed account of the expenses of two messengers who left\r\n  Newcastle on the 15th September, were at Haberdene on the 23d, at the\r\n  Meikle Ferry in Sutherland on the 30th, where they met the messengers\r\n  from Scotland, then proceeded by Helmsdale and Spittal to Wick, which\r\n  they reached on the 4th October. They left Wick on the 6th October,\r\n  and arrived at Norham on the 21st November. On the 13th May of the\r\n  following year (1291) Earl John of Orkney had a safe conduct to come\r\n  to King Edward till the 24th June, when the earl would doubtless\r\n  communicate to the king all that he knew of the princess’s death.\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  This letter was dated 1st February 1320, and the substance of it is\r\n  given by Suhm, vol. xii. p. 29. It does not seem to be known from the\r\n  original document however, but from a later “paraphrase,” as Munch\r\n  calls it, preserved in the Royal Library at Stockholm. (Det Norske\r\n  Folks Historie, vol. iv. part 2, p. 348.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  Under the date 1293 the following entry occurs in the Chronicle of\r\n  Lanercost:—“Dominica etiam post festum Sancti Martini (Nov. 15)\r\n  desponsata est filia Roberti de Carrick regi Norwagiae Magno.” (Chron.\r\n  de Lanercost, p. 155.)

The Iceland Annals, recording his death in\r\n  1319, recount the story as if this were the real Margaret (whose death\r\n  they record in 1290), and add that “to this Haflidi himself bore\r\n  witness when he heard that this same Margaret had been burnt at\r\n  Nordness.” (See Wyntoun’s Statement, p. 1, note 1.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\n  On the 2d April 1320 Bishop Audfinn writes to the Archbishop that on\r\n  the 1st February he had issued a prohibition against the bad custom of\r\n  making pilgrimages to Nordness, and offering invocations to the woman\r\n  who had been burnt many years ago for giving herself out as King\r\n  Eirik’s daughter. He also complains to the archbishop that opposition\r\n  had been offered to the reading out of the prohibition in the Church\r\n  of the Apostles of Bergen. (Munch, Det Norske Folks Historie, iv. part\r\n  2, p. 348.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\n  This noble document was signed by eight earls and thirty-one barons of\r\n  Scotland, at the abbey of Aberbrothock on the 6th April 1320. After\r\n  asserting the legitimate claims of King Robert the Bruce, and\r\n  narrating his struggles in the cause of Scottish independence, it goes\r\n  on to say that “If he were to desist from what he has begun, wishing\r\n  to subject us or our kingdom to the King of England or the English, we\r\n  would immediately endeavour to expel him as our enemy, and the\r\n  subverter of his own rights and ours, and make another king who should\r\n  be able to defend us. For so long as a hundred remain alive, we never\r\n  will in any degree be subject to the dominion of the English. Since\r\n  not for glory, riches, nor honour, we fight, but for liberty alone,\r\n  which no good man loses but with his life.” The duplicate, preserved\r\n  in the General Register House, is printed in facsimile in the National\r\n  Manuscripts of Scotland, published under the superintendence of the\r\n  Lord Clerk Register.\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:\r\n\r\n  The lands are those of Stufum, Kuikobba, Klaet, Thordar, Borgh, Leika,\r\n  Lidh, Haughs-æth and Petland-Sker. (Diplom. Norvegicum, ii. 146.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  Munch, in his Genealogical Table of the Earls of Orkney, makes\r\n  Katharina to be the daughter of Earl John (following Douglas’ Peerage\r\n  of Scotland), and Magnus to be a son of Malcolm of Caithness, whom he\r\n  conjectures to have been a son of the first Magnus. But in a note on\r\n  this subject in the second series of his History, he acknowledges the\r\n  mistake, referring to this document in proof of Magnus’ descent from\r\n  Earl John.

Sir Robert Gordon, in his\r\n  Genealogy of the Earls of Sutherland (p. 49), gives the purport of the\r\n  document in precisely similar terms, but says that it is dated 28th\r\n  May 1344. Sir James Balfour, in his Catalogue of the Scottish\r\n  Nobility, also gives 1344. The confirmation of this contract by David\r\n  II. is recorded as a “confirmation of a contract of marriage betwixt\r\n  Malisius, Earl of Stratherne, Caithness, and Orkney, and William, Earl\r\n  of Ross.” (Robertson’s Index of Missing Charters, p. 51.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  There is also on record a confirmation by Robert I. of a charter of\r\n  the lands of Kingkell, Brechin, to Maria (Marjorie?) de Stratherne,\r\n  spouse of Malise of Stratherne.

(Theiner’s Monumenta, p.\r\n  275.) Maurice fell at the battle of Durham in 1346. Johanna, Countess\r\n  of Stratherne, in her widowhood executed a charter in favour of Robert\r\n  of Erskine and his wife, Christian of Keith, her cousin, which is\r\n  confirmed by Robert, Steward of Scotland and Earl of Stratherne in\r\n  1361.

That the second Malise of Robert Stewart’s deed is the last\r\n  Malise who was Earl of Stratherne seems to be shown by another deed of\r\n  Robert Stewart, dated in 1361, in which, as Seneschal of Scotland and\r\n  Earl of Stratherne, he grants to James Douglas the lands of Kellor in\r\n  Stratherne, “which the late Malise gave.” In the confirmation of this\r\n  grant by Eufamia, Countess of Moray and Stratherne, he is styled “the\r\n  late Malise of good memory.” (Regist.

Such was not\r\n  the opinion of Father Hay, the panegyrist of the St. Clairs of Roslyn.\r\n  He says that “Henry, prince of Orknay, was more honoured than any of\r\n  his ancestres, for he had power to cause stamp coine within his\r\n  dominions, to make laws, to remitt crimes;—he had his sword of honour\r\n  carried before him wheresoever he went; he had a crowne in his armes,\r\n  bore a crowne on his head when he constituted laws; and, in a word,\r\n  was subject to none, save only he held his lands of the King of\r\n  Danemark, Sweden, and Noraway, and entred with them, to whom also it\r\n  did belong to crowne any of those three kings, so that in all those\r\n  parts he was esteemed a second person to the king.” (Genealogie of the\r\n  St. Clairs, p. 17.) Father Hay’s romances receive no countenance\r\n  whatever from the deed of investiture.\r\n\r\nFootnote 91:\r\n\r\n  About £333 sterling.\r\n\r\nFootnote 92:\r\n\r\n  Father Hay states (Genealogie of the St. Clairs, p. 17) that Henry St.\r\n  Clair “married Elisabeth Sparres, daughter of Malesius Sparres, Prince\r\n  of Orkney, Earl of Caithness and Stratherne, through which marriage he\r\n  became Prince of Orkney.” But Malise Sperra never had any connection\r\n  with the earldoms of Caithness or Stratherne. In another place, p. 33,\r\n  he says that Sir William Sinclair (who fell fighting with the Saracens\r\n  in Spain in 1330) “was married to Elizabeth Sparre, daughter to the\r\n  Earle of Orkney, and so by her became the first Earl of Orkney of the\r\n  Saintclairs. His name was Julius Sparre. He is also reputed Earl of\r\n  Stratherne and Caithness.” But this is manifestly a tissue of\r\n  impossibilities. He seems to have copied the last statement from the\r\n  Drummond MS. (1681), where the additional statement is made that\r\n  Elizabeth’s mother was Lucia, daughter of the Earl of Ross.\r\n  (Genealogie of the House of Drummond: Edinburgh, 1831, p. 237.) Both\r\n  writers seem to have confounded Malise, Earl of Stratherne, with his\r\n  daughter’s son, Malise Sperra.\r\n\r\nFootnote 93:\r\n\r\n  Iceland Annals, _sub anno_.

The “double”\r\n  of this deed is said by William Drummond (1681) to have been given to\r\n  him by a friend, and the substance of it is given by him as\r\n  follows:—“Sir John Drummond and his lady Elisabeth Sinclair oblige\r\n  themselves to a noble and potent Lord, Henry, Earle of Orkney, Lord\r\n  Roslin, their father, that they nor their aires shall never claime any\r\n  interest or right of propertie to any lands or possessions belonging\r\n  to the said earle or his aires lying within the kingdome of Norroway,\r\n  so long as he or any air-male of his shall be on lyfe to inherit the\r\n  same; bot if it happen (which God forbid) the said earle to die\r\n  without any air-male to succeed to him, then it shall be lawful for\r\n  them to claim such a portion of the aforesaid lands as is known by the\r\n  Norwegian laws to appertain to a sister of the family.

Owing to the death of\r\n  the archbishop the report was not made, and the remit was renewed by\r\n  the successor of Pope Innocent VI. to the Bishop of Lismore. It is not\r\n  clear whether this was a preferment to the see of Caithness following\r\n  on the death of Thomas de Fingask, or a series of mistakes.

The veneration of\r\n  St. Olaf extended both to Scotland and England. There was a church\r\n  dedicated to him at Cruden, and among the articles enumerated in an\r\n  inventory of the treasury of the cathedral of Aberdeen in 1518, there\r\n  is “a small image of St. Olaf of silver decorated with precious\r\n  stones.”—(Regist. Episc.

The Saga, on the\r\n  other hand, states expressly that his remains were taken to Kirkwall,\r\n  and interred in the cathedral. It is not likely that the founder of\r\n  the cathedral would have been interred anywhere else.\r\n\r\nFootnote 181:\r\n\r\n  See p. liii, _antea_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 182:\r\n\r\n  In the engraving given of this church by Hibbert, the church and tower\r\n  are both represented as covered by a stone roof, that of the tower\r\n  being a conical cap resembling the usual termination of the Irish\r\n  Round Towers.\r\n\r\nFootnote 183:\r\n\r\n  In Jo. Ben’s description of the islands (1529) it is said that the\r\n  church of Egilsey was dedicated to St. Magnus. But as he adds that St.\r\n  Magnus was born in Egilsey, and brought up there from his infancy, and\r\n  that he gave a piece of ground to his nurse, on which she made an\r\n  underground house with all its furniture of stone, it is plain that he\r\n  is merely repeating the absurd traditions of the time.\r\n\r\nFootnote 184:\r\n\r\n  There were three towered churches in Shetland (see p. ci.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 185:\r\n\r\n  “Its style of architecture,” says Sir Henry Dryden, “discarding\r\n  certain indications of an earlier date, prevents our assigning to it a\r\n  date later than the beginning of the 12th century. When we contrast it\r\n  with the Kirkwall Cathedral begun in 1137, we are forced to give an\r\n  earlier date than that to Egilsey, and this opinion is corroborated by\r\n  the churches at Orphir and Brough of Birsay.”—(Ruined Churches in\r\n  Orkney and Shetland, in the _Orcadian_ of 1867.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 186:\r\n\r\n  Those in Britain are Cambridge, consecrated in 1101; Northampton,\r\n  about 1115; Maplestead, 1118; the Temple Church, London, 1185; the\r\n  small Norman church in Ludlow Castle, and the Earls’ Church at Orphir\r\n  in Orkney—the only example in Scotland. “The round churches at\r\n  Cambridge, Northampton, and London,” says Ferguson, “were certainly\r\n  sepulchral, or erected in imitation of the church at Jerusalem”\r\n  (History of Architecture, ii. p. 60). Wilson, on the other hand,\r\n  supposes that the early dry-built beehive houses of the Western\r\n  Islands may have served as a model for some of the earliest Christian\r\n  oratories, of which that at Orphir, he remarks, is an interesting\r\n  example (Prehistoric Annals, ii. p. 369). But there is no analogy\r\n  whatever between the architectural features of Orphir and those of the\r\n  beehive houses, nor has it any resemblance to the earlier oratories\r\n  and chapels of the Western Isles.\r\n\r\nFootnote 187:\r\n\r\n  Pope’s Translation of Torfæus (Wick, 1866), p. 108.\r\n\r\nFootnote 188:\r\n\r\n  Sir H. Dryden says this mode of putting on the arch was probably\r\n  resorted to in order to give a support to the centre on which the arch\r\n  was built. This seems highly probable, and in some cases it would seem\r\n  as if the original supports still remain in the shape of two long thin\r\n  slabs resting on the imposts on either side and meeting in the centre\r\n  of the arch.

The “veil of the Temple,”\r\n  covering the entrance to the Holy of Holies, is a familiar\r\n  illustration of this ancient custom among the Jews.\r\n\r\nFootnote 193:\r\n\r\n  The minister of Birsay in 1627 says:—“There is likewise ane litill\r\n  holm within the sea callit the Brughe of Birsay, quhilk is thocht be\r\n  the elder sort to have belongit to the reid friaris, for there is the\r\n  foundation of ane kirk and kirkyard there as yet to be\r\n  seen.”—Peterkin’s Rentals, No. III., p. 98.\r\n\r\nFootnote 194:\r\n\r\n  Low’s Tour through Orkney and Zetland, MS. in the possession of David\r\n  Laing, Esq.\r\n\r\nFootnote 195:\r\n\r\n  See the article on “The Twin-towered Churches of Denmark,” by J.\r\n  Kornerup, in the Aarboger for Nordisk Oldkindighed for 1869, p. 13.\r\n\r\nFootnote 196:\r\n\r\n  Detailed accounts of the excavation, with translations and facsimiles\r\n  of the inscriptions of Maeshow, have been given in a privately-printed\r\n  work by Mr. Farrer, and in a work published by the late Mr. John\r\n  Mitchell.

St. Ninian is often\r\n  called St. Ringan, and Ringansey seems quite a probable derivation of\r\n  Rinansey.\r\n\r\nFootnote 229:\r\n\r\n  This is represented in the Saga of King Harald as a fine exacted by\r\n  Harald for the death of his son, and paid by the Earl for the _bœndr_\r\n  or freeholders who surrendered their odal lands to him in\r\n  consideration of being freed from this payment (see Appendix).\r\n\r\nFootnote 230:\r\n\r\n  A poem by Thorbiörn Hornklofe, quoted in the Saga of Harald Harfagri.\r\n\r\nFootnote 231:\r\n\r\n  Son and successor of Harald Harfagri.\r\n\r\nFootnote 232:\r\n\r\n  They fell in battle in England, with King Eric Bloodyaxe, and “five\r\n  kings,” as told in the Saga of Hakon the Good. The place where this\r\n  battle was fought has not been satisfactorily identified.\r\n\r\nFootnote 233:\r\n\r\n  Dungad, called also Dungal, was a native chieftain, Maormor, or\r\n  “Jarl,” in the north-east corner of Caithness, who seems to have\r\n  considered the policy of conciliation preferable to that of\r\n  resistance, judging from the intimate relations he formed with the\r\n  foreigners, marrying the daughter of one, and giving his daughter in\r\n  marriage to another, of the chiefs of the invaders. His _bœ_ or hamlet\r\n  of residence became on this account so well known to the Norsemen,\r\n  that they named the district of Dungalsbae (now Duncansbay) by it, and\r\n  spoke of the headland (now Duncansbay Head) on which it was situated,\r\n  as Dungalsness, or Duncan’s cape. The supposed remains of his castle\r\n  were seen by Pennant in 1796, and are described by him as the ruins of\r\n  a circular building, in all probability one of the “burghs” or\r\n  circular towers so common in the north of Scotland, which seem to have\r\n  been the defensive habitations of the native Celtic or Pictish\r\n  population of the period between the 6th and 9th or 10th centuries. It\r\n  is now a green mound. From the Session Records of the parish it\r\n  appears that the district retained its ancient name of “Dungasby” down\r\n  to the beginning of the last century, when it first appears as\r\n  Duncansbay, and to this day it is called “Dungsby” by the older\r\n  inhabitants. The name of the adjacent district of Canisbay, now\r\n  applied to the whole parish, is similarly derived from _Conan’s bæ_.\r\n  It appears between 1223 and 1245 as Canenesbi (Sutherland Charters),\r\n  and in Blaeu’s Atlas, the MS. maps of which were drawn (_circa_ 1620),\r\n  by Mr. Timothy Pont, the minister of the adjacent parish of Dunnet, it\r\n  is marked Conansbay. These two, Duncan and Conan, are the only native\r\n  chieftains of Caithness at the time of the Norse invasion whose names\r\n  have come down to us, probably because they were the only ones who\r\n  held friendly relations with the invaders.\r\n\r\nFootnote 234:\r\n\r\n  In the Saga of Olaf, Tryggvi’s son, it is said that Earl Sigurd lay at\r\n  Asmundarvag, now Osmundwall, in the south end of the island of Hoy.\r\n  There is a place called Roray on the west side of the island, which\r\n  might be the ancient Rörvag.\r\n\r\nFootnote 235:\r\n\r\n  Munch (Chronicon Manniæ, p. 46) alludes to the mistake so common among\r\n  the historians of Scotland to confound the _two_ Malcolms, and to make\r\n  one of them, as if one Malcolm only (Malcolm II.) reigned from 1004 to\r\n  1034. Though this theory has been ingeniously supported from a Norse\r\n  point of view, it is at variance with the concurrent testimony of the\r\n  early Scottish Chronicles. The Saga is the only authority for this\r\n  marriage; but admitting its testimony on this point to be unassailable\r\n  scarcely necessitates the repudiation of the authority of the Scottish\r\n  Chronicles on the question of the succession. (Compare Skene’s\r\n  Highlanders, chap. 5; Robertson’s Scotland under her Early Kings, vol.\r\n  ii. p. 447; and Fordun (Skene’s edition), text and notes.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 236:\r\n\r\n  Olaf, Tryggvi’s son, fell at the battle of Svöldr, A.D. 1000.\r\n\r\nFootnote 237:\r\n\r\n  The battle of Clontarf, A.D. 1014 (see the Introduction). The Iceland\r\n  Annals say that he held the earldom for sixty-two years, so that he\r\n  must have become Earl in A.D. 952; but Munch makes his true period to\r\n  be 980-1014.\r\n\r\nFootnote 238:\r\n\r\n  The word _Bóndi_ (pl. _Bœndr_), literally “a resident” or “dweller,”\r\n  has no English equivalent, although the form remains in the words\r\n  “husband” and “husbandman,” (hus-bondi, house-dweller or\r\n  house-master). The Bœndr were freeholders by odal tenure, proprietors\r\n  of the lands which they had inherited by succession from the original\r\n  “land-takers.” “In the primitive form of Scandinavian society,” says\r\n  Balfour, in his Odal Rights and Feudal Wrongs, “land was the only\r\n  wealth, its ownership the sole foundation of power, privilege, or\r\n  dignity. As no man could win or hold possession without the strong arm\r\n  to defend it, every landowner was a warrior, every warrior a\r\n  husbandman. King Sigurd Syr tended his own hay harvest, and Sweyn of\r\n  Gairsay and Thorkel Fóstri swept the coasts of Britain or Ireland\r\n  while the crops which they and their rovers had sown grew ready for\r\n  their reaping.” The use of the ancient term survived in Orkney till\r\n  1529, as we learn from the description by Jo. Ben, that in the parish\r\n  of Rendale the people saluted each other with “Goand da boundæ” (i.e.\r\n  _godan dag bondi!_) instead of the “Guid day, gudeman,” of the\r\n  Scottish vernacular. Among the documents found in the king’s treasury\r\n  at Edinburgh in 1282, was one entitled “A quit-claiming of the lands\r\n  of the _bondi_ of Caithness for the slaughter of the Bishop,”—viz.\r\n  Bishop Adam, who was burned at Halkirk in 1222 by the “_bondi_,”\r\n  exasperated by his exactions. Although the word is Icelandic, it has\r\n  been retained in the translation as a convenient term to designate the\r\n  class, in preference to such periphrastic renderings as\r\n  “farmer-lairds,” “peasant proprietors,” or “peasant nobles,” as are\r\n  usually employed.\r\n\r\nFootnote 239:\r\n\r\n  Hrossey (Horse Isle) was the name given by the Norsemen to the\r\n  mainland of the Orkney group. The Sandvik here mentioned as the\r\n  residence of Amundi and Thorkel can only be the Sandvik (now Sandwick)\r\n  on Deerness. When Thorfinn drew his vessels in under Deerness before\r\n  he was attacked by Kali Hundason (chap. v.), he sent to Thorkel asking\r\n  him to collect men and come to his assistance. Thorkel’s residence\r\n  could not therefore have been far from Deerness, although the mention\r\n  of Laufandaness is somewhat suggestive of Lopness in Sanday.\r\n\r\nFootnote 240:\r\n\r\n  The Things were local or general assemblies for determining by public\r\n  agreement the course that should be pursued with reference to matters\r\n  affecting the common weal or the public peace. All odal-born freemen\r\n  (not under outlawry) had an equal voice, and king, earl, or common\r\n  bondi, met on the thingstead on equal terms, as thingmen.\r\n\r\nFootnote 241:\r\n\r\n  Ulfreksfiord seems to have been the Norse name of Lough Larne, which\r\n  in a document of the reign of the Irish King John (A.D. 1210) is\r\n  styled _Wulvricheford_ (Worsaae’s Danes and Northmen, p. 311). It is\r\n  suggestive of the identification of this Lough as the scene of Earl\r\n  Einar’s defeat, that Norse burials have been discovered at Larne. One\r\n  of these is described in the Crania Britannica, pl. 56. The form of\r\n  the iron sword found buried with the skeleton, having a short guard\r\n  and triangular pommel, establishes its Norwegian character.\r\n\r\nFootnote 242:\r\n\r\n  Konufögr is plainly the Norse form of the Irish Conchobhar. Several\r\n  Irish kings of this name are mentioned in the Annals.\r\n\r\nFootnote 243:\r\n\r\n  Eyvind Urarhorn was a Lenderman (or Baron) of King Olaf Haraldson. He\r\n  had gone to Ireland to King Conchobhar previous to Einar’s expedition,\r\n  and had assisted the Irish against the Orkneymen. The Saga of Olaf\r\n  Haraldson says that Earl Einar was much displeased with the Northmen\r\n  who had been in the battle on the side of the Irish king, and seized\r\n  this opportunity of wreaking his vengeance on Eyvind, their leader.\r\n\r\nFootnote 244:\r\n\r\n  Asmundarvag, now Osmundwall, in the south end of the island of Hoy.\r\n  The termination _vágr_ usually becomes _wall_, as Kirkiuvagr, which in\r\n  the modern form is Kirkwall.\r\n\r\nFootnote 245:\r\n\r\n  Olaf Haraldson, surnamed “the Holy,” and afterwards known as St. Olaf,\r\n  who became king in the year 1015.\r\n\r\nFootnote 246:\r\n\r\n  Now Sandwick, in Deerness.\r\n\r\nFootnote 247:\r\n\r\n  In the Saga of Harald Harfagri it is stated (chap. vi.) that “King\r\n  Harald made this law over all the lands he conquered, that all the\r\n  odal possessions should be his, and that the Bœndr, both great and\r\n  small, should pay him land-dues for their possessions.” Thus he put an\r\n  end to odal right, in its pure and simple form at least, wherever he\r\n  extended his authority; and the Bœndr, thus taxed and deprived of\r\n  their odal rights, complained, with justice, that they were changed\r\n  from a class of proprietary nobles into a class of tributary tenantry.\r\n  Having assumed the ownership of the earldom of Orkney as his own by\r\n  conquest, his heirs became the odal-born lords of Orkney, while the\r\n  Earls were theoretically the liegemen of the Kings of Norway, though\r\n  having also an odal right to the earldom which the royal prerogative\r\n  could not set aside.\r\n\r\nFootnote 248:\r\n\r\n  If like meets like, or if you be met in the same spirit as you come.\r\n\r\nFootnote 249:\r\n\r\n  The word is _hirdman_. The hirdmen were the King’s body-guard.\r\n\r\nFootnote 250:\r\n\r\n  The _manbote_ (or fine for manslaughter) for every Norwegian Lenderman\r\n  or Baron was fixed at 6 marks of silver, by the Older Gula-thing.\r\n\r\nFootnote 251:\r\n\r\n  Malcolm II., King of Scotland.\r\n\r\nFootnote 252:\r\n\r\n  The identity of Karl or Kali Hundason is one of the historical puzzles\r\n  which exercise the ingenuity of modern historians. Supposing the Saga\r\n  name of this individual to be a Norse corruption of the name of a\r\n  Scottish king, it resembles none more nearly than that of Culen\r\n  Induffson, the Culen Mac Induff of the _Chronica Pictorum_. But if\r\n  Kali Hundason be intended for Culen Induffson, the dates do not agree\r\n  by more than sixty years. On the other hand, supposing the events here\r\n  narrated to be of the period assigned to them by the Saga, Kali\r\n  Hundason ought to be Duncan, son of Crinan, Abbot of Dunkeld, who was\r\n  the grandson and successor of King Malcolm Mac Kenneth. But Fordun\r\n  states that Duncan’s succession was a peaceful one. It is not to be\r\n  overlooked, however, that Earl Thorfinn was also a grandson of Malcolm\r\n  Mac Kenneth; and if we could account for the discrepancy as to the\r\n  name given by the Saga, the war between the two grandsons of the\r\n  deceased monarch might readily be accounted for. For full details of\r\n  the speculations regarding the identity of Kali Hundason, see Skene’s\r\n  Highlanders of Scotland, chap. v.; the Irish version of “Nennius”\r\n  (Irish Archæological Society), Appendix, p. 78; Robertson’s Scotland\r\n  under her Early Kings, vol. ii. p. 477; and Munch’s Norske Folks\r\n  Historie, vol. i. pt. 2, p. 854.\r\n\r\nFootnote 253:\r\n\r\n  The words “at Beruvik” in Jonæus’s edition are not in the\r\n  Flateyjarbók. Two places of this name are mentioned in the Saga. One\r\n  of these is plainly Berwick-on-Tweed (chap. xcii.) The locality of the\r\n  other (which must be the “Beruvik” of this passage) is fixed by the\r\n  statement in chap. xciv., where it is said that Earl Rögnvald was then\r\n  in Sutherland celebrating the marriage of his daughter with Eirik\r\n  Slagbrellir; and when word was brought to him that Harald had come to\r\n  Thurso, he rode with a number of his followers “from Beruvik to\r\n  Thurso.” It has been conjectured that the place here indicated was\r\n  _Caistal a Bharruick_, an old square tower situated on an eminence\r\n  near Kirkiboll, on the east side of the shore of the Kyle of Tongue\r\n  (_Orig. Parochiales_, vol. ii. p. 717). Judging from the context,\r\n  however, it seems more likely that it may have been the _vik_ or inlet\r\n  at the mouth of the water of Berriedale (Berudal), on the southern\r\n  border of Caithness, where there are also the ruins of an old square\r\n  tower—the Castle of Berriedale. This agrees with the statement that\r\n  King Kali, sailing _northward_ from Beruvik, saw the sails of\r\n  Thorfinn’s ships going towards Deerness, as he sailed into the mouth\r\n  of the Firth from the east. Had Kali come from the Kyle of Tongue, he\r\n  would have sailed _east_, and Thorfinn would have seen and intercepted\r\n  him from Duncansbay.\r\n\r\nFootnote 254:\r\n\r\n  Now Sandwick, in Deerness, Orkney.\r\n\r\nFootnote 255:\r\n\r\n  Broad Firth—the Moray Firth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 256:\r\n\r\n  Torfness, the scene of the final conflict between Earl Thorfinn and\r\n  Kali Hundason, is here described as on the south side of Bæfiord, and\r\n  by Arnor, the Earls’ skald, as south of Ekkial, the river Oikel, which\r\n  gave its name to Ekkiálsbakká, or the district along the banks of the\r\n  Oikel and its estuary—the Kyle of Sutherland—which formed the march\r\n  between the territory of the Norse earls and Scotland. Torfness may\r\n  thus be conjectured to be Tarbatness, although we have nothing to fix\r\n  the locality more definitely. Bæfiord, in this case, would be the\r\n  wider portion of the Dornoch Firth. Munch suggests that the seemingly\r\n  French name of Beaufort Castle may be a corruption of Bæfiord (which\r\n  in that case would be the Beauly Frith); but in all probability the\r\n  name Beaufort is what it seems to be, and much more modern.\r\n\r\nFootnote 257:\r\n\r\n  In which King Olaf Haraldson (the Holy) was killed, A.D. 1030.\r\n\r\nFootnote 258:\r\n\r\n  The Kjölen mountains, part of the range separating Norway from Sweden.\r\n\r\nFootnote 259:\r\n\r\n  Hólmgard, now Novgorod, formerly Cholmogori, in Russia, which the\r\n  Northmen called Gardariki.\r\n\r\nFootnote 260:\r\n\r\n  The town of Ladoga, which Rurik, the first King of Russia, made his\r\n  capital in the 9th century.

Munch (_Chronicon Manniæ_, p. 46) says that, considering\r\n  the situation of Caithness, and how well the author of the saga must\r\n  have known it, it becomes evident that between “Caithness” and “at the\r\n  place” an _and_ must have been dropped by the subsequent writer, who,\r\n  living about A.D. 1380, and in Iceland (this part of the saga existing\r\n  only in the _Codex Flateyensis_), might easily have dropped an _ok_\r\n  (or the abbreviation thereof), not conscious of the great blunder he\r\n  committed. He further adds that Gaddgedlar is evidently the Norse\r\n  corruption of “Galwydia,” Galloway. This explanation is open to the\r\n  objections that, besides the improbability of Thorfinn having dwelt\r\n  for the most part in Caithness and in Galloway, the latter place does\r\n  not fit the description that there Scotland and England meet. The word\r\n  _eingland_, signifying meadow, or strath land, may possibly have been\r\n  used as a general term for “The Dales of Caithness,” if it may not be\r\n  supposed to be a mis-transcription of the word _eignarland_, meaning\r\n  Thorfinn’s own territory. Gaddgedlar might be the Norse pronunciation\r\n  of the native word Gall-gael, applied to the mixed population of the\r\n  districts where the Norse element had not entirely displaced the\r\n  Celtic, or the border districts between the Norse earldom and the\r\n  purely Celtic territory “where Scotland and his (Thorfinn’s) own land\r\n  meet.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 268:\r\n\r\n  Raudabiorg, or Red Headland, must be looked for in the neighbourhood\r\n  of Dunnet Head, where the red beds of the Old Red Sandstone form the\r\n  distinctive feature of the coast. A little to the east of Dunnet Head\r\n  there is an outlying crag named Brough of Rattar, or Rattar Brough—in\r\n  all probability a corrupted form of the old name Raudabiorg. Still\r\n  farther to the eastward, where the burn of Rattar enters the Firth,\r\n  are the ruins of an old “Pictish tower,” or broch—in old Norse,\r\n  _borg_. In its immediate vicinity is a little promontory called Kirk\r\n  o’ Taing (_Kirkiu Tunga_, the Tongue, or Ness of the Kirk), on which\r\n  are the ruins of one of the small rudely-built chapels of the early\r\n  Christian time. On the north side of the chapel the edges of a number\r\n  of stone cists are visible through the turf; and from two of these,\r\n  which were dug up in cutting a drain in the spring of 1872, eight\r\n  silver armlets of the ancient penannular form were obtained. These\r\n  correspond exactly with the armlets which formed part of the great\r\n  hoard exhumed at Skaill, in Orkney, on the opposite side of the Firth,\r\n  with Cufic and Anglo-Saxon coins of the tenth century—in all\r\n  probability a hoard deposited by some of the vikings on their return\r\n  from a plundering expedition. As Earl Thorfinn and his men were\r\n  Christians, it seems probable that, if the chapel was then in\r\n  existence, the bodies of the seventy slain in the fight off\r\n  Raudabiorg, which were landed here, would be buried in the consecrated\r\n  ground attached to this chapel.\r\n\r\nFootnote 269:\r\n\r\n  The Mainland of Orkney.\r\n\r\nFootnote 270:\r\n\r\n  The two Papeys, the great and the little (anciently Papey meiri and\r\n  Papey minni), now Papa Westray and Papa Stronsay, are both mentioned\r\n  in the Saga. Fordun, in his enumeration of the islands, has a “Papeay\r\n  tertia,” which is not now known. There are three islands in Shetland\r\n  called Papey, and both in Orkney and Shetland there are several\r\n  districts named Paplay or Papplay, doubtless the same as the Papyli of\r\n  Iceland. Munch considers that these names betray a Kelto-Christian\r\n  origin. They probably indicate the settlements of Irish ecclesiastics\r\n  in the islands previous to the arrival of the Northmen. The recent\r\n  discoveries in Orkney of ecclesiastical bells of the early square\r\n  form, and of stone monuments with Ogham inscriptions (in one case\r\n  associated with a figure of the cross of an early form), seem to point\r\n  to the settlement of ecclesiastical communities in the islands at a\r\n  very early period.

King Magnus died in A.D. 1047, and some time must have\r\n  elapsed before Thorfinn heard of his death. Then his messengers went\r\n  to Norway, and returned; and his own expedition was thereafter\r\n  prepared. After visiting King Harald Hardradi in Norway, he stayed\r\n  some time with Svend Estridson, the King of Denmark. Then he visited\r\n  Henry III., Emperor of Germany, and would probably reach Rome soon\r\n  after the accession of Pope Leo IX., who occupied the Papal throne\r\n  from 1049 to 1055. As Macbeth, the only Scottish sovereign who ever\r\n  visited the city of Rome, made his pilgrimage thither in the year\r\n  1050, and Thorfinn and he were close friends and allies, it is\r\n  probable that they went together. (Compare Saga of King Harald\r\n  Hardradi; Wyntoun, vol. ii. pp. 468, 469; Marianus Scotus, in Mon.\r\n  Hist.

Doubtless the extent of these is considerably\r\n  exaggerated.

Duncan is said by the Scottish\r\n  historians to have been a bastard, while the Sagas make him the\r\n  legitimate offspring of Malcolm and Ingibiorg, who must by this time\r\n  have been old enough to be Malcolm’s mother. She was married to Earl\r\n  Thorfinn before Kálf Arnason was banished by King Magnus (chap. xiv.),\r\n  which was some time between 1036 and 1041. Earl Thorfinn died in 1064,\r\n  seven years after King Malcolm was crowned at Scone, in 1057.\r\n  Malcolm’s marriage with the Princess Margaret of England took place in\r\n  1067, or less than three years after Ingibiorg became a widow. Munch\r\n  supposes that Ingibiorg must have died in childbed with Duncan, and\r\n  suggests that the fact that Duncan claimed the crown before Edgar, the\r\n  son of Malcolm by Margaret, may be taken as showing that he must have\r\n  been the offspring of a previous marriage. Macpherson (Wyntoun, vol.\r\n  ii. p. 472), while accepting the statement of the Saga, accounts for\r\n  Duncan being called a bastard from the circumstance that Malcolm’s\r\n  marriage with Ingibiorg was within the degrees of propinquity\r\n  forbidden by the canon law.\r\n\r\nFootnote 284:\r\n\r\n  This William Odling (the Noble) is William of Egremont (the boy of\r\n  Egremont), son of William Fitz Duncan, and consequently grandson of\r\n  Duncan. The reference here to him as the person whom all the Scots\r\n  wished to have for their king is explained by the fact that, on the\r\n  death of David I., by the old Celtic law of succession, he became in\r\n  the eyes of the Celtic population the rightful heir to the throne; and\r\n  his claims were supported by no fewer than seven Earls, among whom\r\n  were those of Strathern, Ross, and Orkney. The insurrection was\r\n  speedily put down, but the claim was subsequently revived by Donald\r\n  Bane Macwilliam, who, on the same principle, obtained the support of\r\n  the northern chiefs. (See Skene’s Highlanders of Scotland for a full\r\n  account of the conflict between the feudal and the Celtic systems of\r\n  succession.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 285:\r\n\r\n  This is a mistake. Morkere was present at the battle of Hastings, and\r\n  he and Waltheof went afterwards to Normandy with William the\r\n  Conqueror.\r\n\r\nFootnote 286:\r\n\r\n  Fordun (v. chap. i.) records the landing of Macduff “at Ravynsore in\r\n  England.” Camden mentions a place on Holderness, at the mouth of the\r\n  Humber, formerly called Ravensere. It no longer exists, having been\r\n  destroyed by the encroachments of the sea.\r\n\r\nFootnote 287:\r\n\r\n  Now called the Mainland of Orkney.\r\n\r\nFootnote 288:\r\n\r\n  The reference here must be supposed to be to the murder of St. Magnus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 289:\r\n\r\n  “Hugh the Stout” was Hugh, Earl of Chester; and “Hugh the Bold,” Hugh\r\n  of Montgomery, Earl of Salop. According to Odericus Vitalis, King\r\n  Magnus came into the Menai Straits with only six ships, carrying a red\r\n  shield on the mast as a sign of peace and commercial intercourse. The\r\n  Welsh King Griffith was at that time engaged in war with the Norman\r\n  Earls above mentioned, who had invaded his territories, and advanced\r\n  as far as the Straits, when the arrival of King Magnus gave an\r\n  unexpected turn to the course of events, in the death of the Earl of\r\n  Montgomery, as here narrated.\r\n\r\nFootnote 290:\r\n\r\n  Hálogaland, the most northern part of Norway.\r\n\r\nFootnote 291:\r\n\r\n  The Saga writer (says Munch) has been here misled by the Scottish\r\n  denomination of the reigning monarch, Edgar MacMalcolm. Malcolm\r\n  Canmore died in 1093, the year of King Magnus’s first expedition to\r\n  the west. The second expedition, which was in 1098, was the one in\r\n  which he fought with the two Norman Earls in Anglesea Sound. The\r\n  events of the two expeditions are here mixed up together, and the\r\n  references to Malcolm Canmore do not synchronise with either. It is\r\n  possible that the offer of the islands (as here mentioned) may have\r\n  come to King Magnus from Donald Bane, the brother of King Malcolm, to\r\n  secure the support of King Magnus in his attempt to retain the throne\r\n  against Edgar, although the incident of the drawing of the boat across\r\n  the isthmus may have taken place in the reign of Edgar. The\r\n  “Fagrskinna” (p. 156) adds that King Malcolm of Scotland, sent his\r\n  daughter out to the Orkneys to be married to Magnus’s son Sigurd, he\r\n  being then nine and she five years of age, and that he left her in the\r\n  Orkneys when he went to Norway. The author has confounded Malcolm with\r\n  Mýrkiartan.\r\n\r\nFootnote 292:\r\n\r\n  Pennant mentions (1772) that not long previously it was customary for\r\n  vessels of nine or ten tons to be drawn across the isthmus by horses,\r\n  in order to avoid the dangerous and circuitous passage round the Mull.\r\n\r\nFootnote 293:\r\n\r\n  Scotland’s Firth—the channel between the west coast of Scotland and\r\n  the Hebrides.\r\n\r\nFootnote 294:\r\n\r\n  Muircearteach, grandson of Brian Boroimhe, King of Munster.\r\n\r\nFootnote 295:\r\n\r\n  Now Drontheim, so called because situated at the mouth of the Nid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 296:\r\n\r\n  See note at p. 38.\r\n\r\nFootnote 297:\r\n\r\n  Ulster, in Ireland.\r\n\r\nFootnote 298:\r\n\r\n  King Sigurd, the Jorsala-farer, set out on his pilgrimage to Jerusalem\r\n  in 1107.\r\n\r\nFootnote 299:\r\n\r\n  Borgarfiord, the “fiord of the Borg,” now Burra Firth, on the west\r\n  side of the Mainland of Shetland, so named by the Norsemen on account\r\n  of the “borg,” or “Pictish tower,” which still stands on the little\r\n  holm of Hebrista, though greatly ruined. It is probable that the\r\n  reason of Thorbiörn’s connection with Borgarfiord was its affording\r\n  him and his followers a shelter and defensive position in the borg.\r\n  The old name Borgarfiord occurs in a document in the Norse language\r\n  dated 1299. It is a record drawn up in the Lagthing of certain charges\r\n  made against Herr Thorvald Thoresson, by a woman named Ragnhild\r\n  Simonsdatter, who accuses him of malversation of the land-rents of\r\n  Brekasettr. (_Diplom. Norvegicum_, vol. i. p. 81.) Harald of\r\n  Borgarfiord in Shetland witnesses a document in 1498.\r\n\r\nFootnote 300:\r\n\r\n  The place where the Orkney Things were held is nowhere more\r\n  particularly indicated. Stennis has been suggested, on the supposition\r\n  that the great stone circle there would have been thus utilised by the\r\n  Northmen. It does not appear, however, that the occasion on which\r\n  Havard, son of Thorfinn Hausakliuf, was killed at “Steinsness” was a\r\n  Thing meeting there, and this is the only occasion on which Stennis is\r\n  mentioned in the whole of the Flateyjarbók. “Tingwale,” in the parish\r\n  of Rendale, occurs in the Orkney Land List of 1502. This seems to be\r\n  the only trace of the old Thing-völl in Hrossey.\r\n\r\nFootnote 301:\r\n\r\n  Egilsey, in Jo. Ben’s description of the Orkneys (1529) called\r\n  “Insularum Ecclesia,” is regarded by Munch as deriving its name not\r\n  from the Norse proper name _Egil_, but from the Irish _Eaglais_, a\r\n  church. “To this day,” he says, “Egilsey contains a church shown by\r\n  its construction to have been built before the Northmen arrived in\r\n  Orkney, or at all events to belong to the more ancient Christian\r\n  Celtic population. (See under “Egilsey” in the Introduction).\r\n\r\nFootnote 302:\r\n\r\n  These dates are self-contradictory, and utterly irreconcilable. King\r\n  Magnus Barelegs fell in Ireland in the year 1103; and it is stated in\r\n  the Saga of Sigurd, the Jorsala-farer, that Hákon, Paul’s son, came to\r\n  Norway to King Sigurd “a year or two after King Magnus’s fall.” The\r\n  King gave him the earldom and government of the Orkneys, and he went\r\n  back immediately to Orkney. Then it is added that four years after the\r\n  fall of King Magnus—that is, in 1107—King Sigurd set out on his\r\n  pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Now, it is mentioned in this Saga (chap.\r\n  xxxiii.) that Earl Magnus went to Norway to see King Eystein, “for\r\n  King Sigurd had then gone to Jerusalem.” This must have been after\r\n  1107. King Eystein gave him his patrimony, one-half of the Orkneys. If\r\n  his visit to Norway was in the year after King Sigurd’s departure, as\r\n  seems likely from the narrative, or in 1108, and “he had been seven\r\n  winters Earl in the Orkneys along with Earl Hákon,” this would bring\r\n  the date of his death exactly to the year assigned in the Iceland\r\n  Annals appended to the Flateyjarbók, or to 1115. The entry in the\r\n  “Annalar” for that year is: “Pindr enn heilagi Magnus jarl i\r\n  Orkneyium.” Torfæus dates this event in 1110. The Saga of St. Magnus\r\n  says he had been twelve winters Earl of the Orkneys jointly with\r\n  Hákon, counting evidently from the vacancy of earldom in 1103 by the\r\n  accession of Sigurd, Magnus’ son, then Earl of the Orkneys, to the\r\n  throne of Norway. This also gives the date 1115.\r\n\r\nFootnote 303:\r\n\r\n  A curious catalogue of cases in which diseased and infirm people were\r\n  miraculously restored to health and vigour, after paying their vows at\r\n  the shrine of St. Magnus, is given in the Magnus Saga. These pilgrims\r\n  mostly came from Shetland. Two of the cases are interesting as\r\n  affording the earliest notices of leprosy (_líkthrá_) in Shetland—a\r\n  disease which seems to have continued in the Islands till towards the\r\n  close of the last century.—(Sir James Simpson’s Archæological\r\n  Essays—Leprosy and Leper Hospitals in Britain.) These cases appear to\r\n  have been overlooked by Sir James. Schröder has published a curious\r\n  Swedish version of the story of St. Magnus, in which the account of\r\n  his miracles is considerably varied.\r\n\r\nFootnote 304:\r\n\r\n  That is for sixty-six years. As William died, according to the\r\n  Icelandic Annals, in 1168, and was bishop in the year of St. Magnus’s\r\n  death, 1115, he was undoubtedly bishop for fifty-three years. That he\r\n  was bishop for the long period of sixty-six years, as this passage\r\n  seems to imply, may be open to some doubt. Munch supposes that the\r\n  “seventh decade” may be an error for “sixth.” This would place his\r\n  consecration to the see of Orkney in 1112; but the Saga of St. Magnus\r\n  says he was bishop sixty-six years.\r\n\r\nFootnote 305:\r\n\r\n  Rekavík is either the modern Rackwick, on the northern point of the\r\n  Island of Westray, in Orkney, or Rackwick, in the Island of Hoy; more\r\n  probably the latter.\r\n\r\nFootnote 306:\r\n\r\n  Sigurd Slembir or Slembidiakn had a most romantic history. In his\r\n  youth he was considered the son of a priest, Adalbrekt by name, and\r\n  was brought up for the church. His tastes appear to have lain in quite\r\n  another direction, however; and he soon broke loose from the\r\n  restraints of ecclesiastical life. He gave himself out as an\r\n  illegitimate son of King Magnus Barelegs, and commenced a life of\r\n  roving and adventure, visiting the Holy Land, and turning an honest\r\n  penny occasionally by trading expeditions to Scotland, the Orkneys,\r\n  Ireland, and Denmark. In the latter country he proved his paternity by\r\n  the ordeal of hot iron, as King Harald Gilli had done. He then went to\r\n  King Harald, and asked him to recognise him; but instead of this he\r\n  was placed on his trial for the slaying of Thorkel Fóstri, Sumarlidi’s\r\n  son. He managed to make his escape by jumping overboard with two of\r\n  his guards in his arms, and soon after returned and killed King Harald\r\n  Gilli in his bed in Bergen. Then he tried to place Magnus the Blind on\r\n  the throne by assistance from Denmark; but the expedition was met on\r\n  the south coast of Norway by the sons of King Harald, and totally\r\n  defeated. Magnus was slain, and Sigurd Slembir was taken, and put to\r\n  death with almost incredible tortures. (See the account of him in the\r\n  Sagas of Magnus the Blind and the sons of Harald in the Heimskringla.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 307:\r\n\r\n  Westness, in Rousay (Hrólfsey), see p. 73.\r\n\r\nFootnote 308:\r\n\r\n  Thorkel Fóstri Sumarlidi’s son, foster-father to Earl Paul, not to be\r\n  confounded with Thorkel Fóstri, Amundi’s son, previously noticed as\r\n  foster-father to Earl Thorfinn Sigurdson.\r\n\r\nFootnote 309:\r\n\r\n  Stofa.

No place answering to this name can now be traced in\r\n  Westray, but a various reading of the passage has Reppisness; and\r\n  there is a place on the south-east side of the island still called\r\n  Rapness, probably the place here indicated.\r\n\r\nFootnote 311:\r\n\r\n  Fluguness does not again occur in the saga, and has not been\r\n  identified. It is the same as the Flydruness of p. 92.\r\n\r\nFootnote 312:\r\n\r\n  Knarrarstadir seems to signify the district at the head of Scapa Bay,\r\n  south of Kirkwall. Munch derives the name from _knörr_, a\r\n  merchant-ship. It is said at p. 110 that Játvör and her son Borgar\r\n  lived at Geitaberg, which seems to be the place now called Gatnip, on\r\n  the east side of Scapa, anciently Scalpeid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 313:\r\n\r\n  Brekkur in Straumsey may have been the name of a homestead in the\r\n  island of Stroma. There is some confusion as to the locality, however.\r\n  It is said in chap. lxvii. to have been in Stronsay. The name is not\r\n  now recognisable in either of the islands.\r\n\r\nFootnote 314:\r\n\r\n  Glaitness, near Kirkwall, is probably the modern representative of the\r\n  ancient Glettuness. In the testament of Sir David Synclair of\r\n  Swynbrocht (Sumburgh, in Shetland), in the year 1506, there is a\r\n  bequest “to Thorrald of Brucht, and to his wife and his airis, ten\r\n  merks land in Glaitness, and fifteen merks land in Linggo, with all\r\n  guids there contenit, and twenty-two merks in Pappale, ten merks in\r\n  Brucht.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 315:\r\n\r\n  Harald Gillichrist, who subsequently became King of Norway, under the\r\n  name of King Harald Gilli.

Its site is now\r\n  included in that of Christiania.\r\n\r\nFootnote 318:\r\n\r\n  Hauga-Thing, so called apparently because the place of meeting was a\r\n  _haug_, or barrow. Whether this was a local name at Túnsberg, or\r\n  whether it refers to a special assembly held at the burial-place of\r\n  the King, is not clear.\r\n\r\nFootnote 319:\r\n\r\n  Harald Gillichrist, illegitimate son of King Magnus Barelegs, was of\r\n  Celtic extraction, his mother being a native of the Hebrides. He and\r\n  his mother were brought over to Norway from the Southern Hebrides in a\r\n  ship belonging to a Norwegian merchant named Halkel Húk. When the\r\n  story of Harald’s parentage was told to King Sigurd, he consented to\r\n  allow Harald to prove his paternity by the ordeal of hot iron, but on\r\n  condition, that if he succeeded in proving his descent according to\r\n  his claim, he should not desire the kingdom in the lifetime either of\r\n  King Sigurd or of his son, King Magnus, and to this Harald bound\r\n  himself by oath. This seems to be the oath referred to as given under\r\n  compulsion. “The ordeal,” it is added in the Saga of King Sigurd, “was\r\n  the greatest ever made in Norway, for nine glowing ploughshares were\r\n  laid down, and Harald walked over them with bare feet, attended by two\r\n  bishops, and invoking the holy St. Columba”—another testimony to his\r\n  Celtic birth. His feet were then bound up, and he was laid in bed.\r\n  After the customary three days had elapsed, his feet were examined,\r\n  or, as the Saga has it, “the ordeal was taken to proof, and his feet\r\n  were found unburnt.” His claims were therefore held to have been\r\n  proven, and made good. It is curious to find that among the privileges\r\n  granted by the Scottish King David to the monks of Holyrood, they were\r\n  specially empowered to make trials by the ordeal of hot iron.\r\n\r\nFootnote 320:\r\n\r\n  In Vík, in the south of Norway.\r\n\r\nFootnote 321:\r\n\r\n  Now Ferlof, in Sogn, Norway.\r\n\r\nFootnote 322:\r\n\r\n  Vík meant properly the bay of Oslo, the upper part of which is now\r\n  called the Christiania Fiord, but it was also applied to the district\r\n  bordering on the bay.\r\n\r\nFootnote 323:\r\n\r\n  Harald and Eric, Kings of Denmark, had sworn mutual brotherhood.\r\n\r\nFootnote 324:\r\n\r\n  Alasund is now Yell Sound, the ancient name for the island of Yell\r\n  being Jala. In the latest known Hjaltland document, written in Norse,\r\n  and dated in 1586, the name of the island appears as “Yella.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 325:\r\n\r\n  Outsittings, a peculiar kind of sorcery resorted to in order to obtain\r\n  foreknowledge of the future, in which the person sat out at night\r\n  under the open sky, and by certain magical rites or incantations\r\n  summoned the dead from their graves to consult them. A curious\r\n  instance is given in the 40th chapter of the Færeyinga Saga, in which\r\n  Sigmund Brestisson is brought from the dead, with his head in his\r\n  hand, to show who was his murderer.\r\n\r\nFootnote 326:\r\n\r\n  The Moul Head of Deerness.\r\n\r\nFootnote 327:\r\n\r\n  The Norsemen were in the habit of carrying stones on board their\r\n  warships to be used as missiles. It is told in the Færeyinga Saga of\r\n  Sigmund Brestisson that when about to attack the ships of another\r\n  Viking lying on the opposite side of an island on the coast of Sweden,\r\n  he spent the whole night in landing the goods and plunder from his\r\n  vessels, and breaking up stones, and loading his vessel with them to\r\n  serve as missiles in the attack. The same thing had been done by the\r\n  Earl’s men in this case before the commencement of the fight.\r\n\r\nFootnote 328:\r\n\r\n  Probably at the place now called Swiney, in Caithness, near Lybster.\r\n  Though the context here seems to imply that Swiney, in Caithness, is\r\n  meant, it seems that Grim was in the island of Swona (the small island\r\n  between Hoy and South Ronaldsay), when Swein, Asleif’s son, visited\r\n  him (see p. 92). Perhaps Swiney, in Caithness, was so named from its\r\n  being the property of Grim of Swona.\r\n\r\nFootnote 329:\r\n\r\n  Aurrida Firth, or Salmon-trout Firth, now the Bay of Firth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 330:\r\n\r\n  Flydruness seems to be the same as Fluguness, in Hrossey (Mainland),\r\n  mentioned as the residence of Blan and his father Thorstein, at p. 74.\r\n\r\nFootnote 331:\r\n\r\n  The Earl’s seat at Orphir appears to have consisted of a cluster of\r\n  buildings, of which the main hall or skáli answered to the public room\r\n  of the residence. The descriptions given of the Orkney skális are\r\n  wanting in that minuteness which is necessary to enable us to\r\n  understand the details of their construction. No doubt they were\r\n  similar to those of Iceland, the larger of which were constructed\r\n  partly of stone and partly of timber, the middle division of the hall\r\n  being higher in the roof than the “aisles” on either side of it, and\r\n  separated from them by a row of pillars running parallel to each of\r\n  the side walls. The walls of the aisles and the spaces between the\r\n  pillars were covered with wainscoting, sometimes with carved work, and\r\n  on high days hung with tapestry. Shields and weapons were hung along\r\n  the sides of the hall, above the benches, and the fires were lit on\r\n  hearths in the middle of the floor. The benches were ranged along both\r\n  sides of the hall; the “high seat” of the Earl, or owner of the skáli,\r\n  was in the centre of the south side, and the seats of highest honour\r\n  were those next to him on either side.\r\n\r\nFootnote 332:\r\n\r\n  Probably a large flagstone set on end to serve as a partition-wall.\r\n  This is a common feature of the ancient structures in Caithness and\r\n  Orkney. It was in the shadow of this flagstone that Swein, Asleif’s\r\n  son, stood when he killed Swein Brióstreip (see p. 95).\r\n\r\nFootnote 333:\r\n\r\n  Serving the table, and holding lights. The light-bearers or\r\n  candle-holders were a distinct class of servants at the King’s court.\r\n  This custom is said to have been first introduced by King Olaf Kyrre\r\n  in the latter half of the eleventh century.\r\n\r\nFootnote 334:\r\n\r\n  The emptying of horns of ale to the memory of departed heroes and\r\n  comrades, with the accompaniment of speeches setting forth their\r\n  famous deeds, was a recognised custom at the festivals of the\r\n  Northmen.\r\n\r\nFootnote 335:\r\n\r\n  Besides his evil repute as a turbulent fellow, Swein was suspected of\r\n  sorcery, and thus obnoxious to the church (see p. 88).\r\n\r\nFootnote 336:\r\n\r\n  This must either he Paplay in South Ronaldsay, or Paplay on the\r\n  Mainland. Munch says that the circumstance that the name of the island\r\n  is always carefully added in the Saga when a Mainland district is not\r\n  the one alluded to favours the supposition that it is the latter which\r\n  is here meant.\r\n\r\nFootnote 337:\r\n\r\n  Gói, the fourth month of the year, corresponding to our February and\r\n  part of March. The ancient mode of reckoning among the Northmen was by\r\n  “winters,” the year commencing on the 23d November. Gói was sometimes\r\n  called “horning-month”—the month in which the deer shed their horns;\r\n  and it was also the month in which, in heathen times, the great annual\r\n  sacrifice took place at Upsala, as mentioned in the Saga of King Olaf\r\n  the Holy.\r\n\r\nFootnote 338:\r\n\r\n  _Höfn_, the haven, in Westray, is probably the modern Pierowall, the\r\n  only safe natural harbour in the island, and the only place entitled\r\n  to the name of “the haven.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 339:\r\n\r\n  The _thorp_ or village of Höfn here mentioned most likely stood on the\r\n  shore by the landing-place at Pierowall. The fact that there are a\r\n  number of graves on the links here, in which have been found the\r\n  swords peculiar to the Norse viking period, shield-bosses, bronze\r\n  tortoise brooches (a distinctively Scandinavian form), and other\r\n  relics unquestionably of Norse origin, shows that the neighbourhood\r\n  must have been largely frequented by the Northmen, and perhaps made a\r\n  permanent settlement long before this time. The Church of Westray is\r\n  mentioned among those vacant in 1327-28 by the Papal Nuncio, who\r\n  collected the tithes for these years.\r\n\r\nFootnote 340:\r\n\r\n  Although there is a curious similarity between this incident and that\r\n  related in chap. lxxi. on the occasion of the visit of Bishop John to\r\n  the Orkneys, yet the fact of Earl Rögnvald turning the procession into\r\n  ridicule, whereas Bishop John’s party appear to have been received\r\n  with all due respect, suggests that the two narratives can scarcely\r\n  refer to the same incident. The reference here to the “isle Elon,”\r\n  taken in connection with the statement in chap. xcix. that there were\r\n  monks on Eller Holm (named “Helene-holm” by Fordun), may mean that\r\n  there was a colony of clerics on the little island, whose dress and\r\n  tonsure may thus have tickled the fancy of the rhyming Earl. In the\r\n  rental of Shapinsay (1642), Elgin-holme is set in feu to Sir John\r\n  Buchanan for payment of 12s. annually. In 1529 Jo. Ben mentions that\r\n  there were foundations of houses and even of a chapel on Eloerholme,\r\n  though it was then waste and uninhabited (see chap. xcix). Neale\r\n  notices “the ruins of a very small chapel” on Ellerholm\r\n  (Ecclesiological Notes, p. 111).\r\n\r\nFootnote 341:\r\n\r\n  The Iceland Annals place Earl Rögnvald’s winning the Orkneys in the\r\n  year 1136.\r\n\r\nFootnote 342:\r\n\r\n  Evie Sound; from _Efja_, now Evie.\r\n\r\nFootnote 343:\r\n\r\n  _Húdfat_—skin-bags, or sleeping haps, made of hides sewed together, so\r\n  as to envelope the sleeper as in a sack.\r\n\r\nFootnote 344:\r\n\r\n  Still known as the Swelkie, a dangerous whirlpool in certain states of\r\n  the tide, off the island of Stroma, fabled to be caused by the waters\r\n  being sucked down through the eye of the quern “Grotti,” which once\r\n  belonged to King Fródi. Grotti was found in Denmark, and was the\r\n  largest quern that had ever been known. It would grind for King Fródi\r\n  gold or peace, which he pleased. But the sea-king M['y]sing took\r\n  Grotti, and caused white salt to be ground in his ships till they sank\r\n  in Pentland’s Firth. This is why the Swelkie has been there ever\r\n  since. As the waters fall through the eye of the quern, the sea roars\r\n  as the quern grinds; and, moreover, this is how the sea first became\r\n  salt.—(Elder Edda, Grottasöng.) Traces of this legend still linger in\r\n  the locality.\r\n\r\nFootnote 345:\r\n\r\n  Ekkialsbakki is three times mentioned in the Flateyjarbók, and Ekkial\r\n  once by Arnór Jarlaskáld (see p. 22). Earl Sigurd, Eystein’s son, who\r\n  killed Malbrigd (Maormor of Mar according to Skene), was “hoy-laid”\r\n  (buried in a how or barrow, _haugr_), on Ekkialsbakki. “There cannot\r\n  be the least doubt,” says Worsaae, in his ‘Danes and Northmen,’ “that\r\n  Ekkial is the river Oykill (Oykel), which still forms the southern\r\n  boundary of Sutherland. But nobody is able to point out the barrow of\r\n  Sigurd Jarl. The tradition relating to it has vanished with the\r\n  Norwegian population.” But, fortunately, there are records more\r\n  permanent and reliable than popular tradition, by which the truth of\r\n  the Saga narrative may be verified, and the locality of Sigurd’s\r\n  grave-mound indisputably fixed. There is a place near the Ferry on the\r\n  north bank of the Dornoch Firth (into which the Oykel runs) which is\r\n  now somewhat inappropriately called Cyder Hall. In Blaeu’s Atlas\r\n  (1640) it appears as Siddera. In older charters it is conjoined with\r\n  Skebo, and called Sythera. In a deed of the year 1275 the Bishop of\r\n  Caithness claims right to “six davochs of Schythebolle and Sytheraw,\r\n  with the ferry.” In the deed of constitution of the Cathedral Chapter\r\n  of Caithness, executed between 1223 and 1245, there are assigned to\r\n  the treasurer the rectorial tithes of Scytheboll and _Siwardhoch_, its\r\n  conjunction with Scytheboll showing it to be the same place which is\r\n  called at subsequent periods Sytheraw, Siddera, and Cyder Hall. This\r\n  place, named Siward’s Hoch (_Sigurd’s haug_) at that early date, could\r\n  be no other than the traditional site of Earl Sigurd’s grave-mound,\r\n  and the Ekkialsbakki on which he was buried must thus have been the\r\n  north bank of the Oykel’s estuary. But the Ekkialsbakki twice\r\n  mentioned in connection with Swein Asleifson’s journey to Athole can\r\n  scarcely be the same with that of the earlier narrative. It seems\r\n  probable that in Swein Asleifson’s narrative the word may have been\r\n  originally Atjoklsbakki—the coast on the side of the Breidafiord\r\n  (Moray Firth) next to Atjöklar (Athole). The word _bakki_ is sometimes\r\n  used for a “coast.” The Saga writer may have been misled by the\r\n  similarity of sound to substitute Ekkialsbakki for Atjoklsbakki. (See\r\n  p. 115.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 346:\r\n\r\n  The name of Maddad, Earl of Athole, appears in contemporary documents\r\n  as Maddoc, Madach, and Madeth. In the foundation-charter of Scone by\r\n  King Alexander I. and his queen Sibilla, “Madach Comes” is a witness.\r\n  “Maddoc” and “Madeth Comes” also witness charters of King David I.\r\n  From a charter by King Malcolm the Maiden, granting aid for the\r\n  restoration of the Abbey of Scone, we learn that the style of the\r\n  Earls of Athole was “Comes de Ethocl,” the Atjokl of the\r\n  Saga.—(Regist. de Dunferm. Regist. de Scone.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 347:\r\n\r\n  Geitaberg is probably the place now known as Gatnip, on the east side\r\n  of Scapa Bay, near Kirkwall. It is formerly stated that Játvör and her\r\n  son Borgar lived at Knarrarstad, which is evidently the name for the\r\n  district, while Geitaberg was the name of Borgar’s homestead. Gatnip\r\n  is the highest point on that side of the bay, and thus Borgar was able\r\n  to notice the barge rowed by Swein’s men as it passed up and down the\r\n  Firth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 348:\r\n\r\n  Magnus, in the text here, is clearly a mistake for Hákon.\r\n\r\nFootnote 349:\r\n\r\n  The erection of St. Magnus’ Church was commenced apparently between\r\n  the years 1136 and 1138. The remains of St. Magnus appear to have been\r\n  transferred to it from Christ’s Church, in Birsay, previous to the\r\n  departure of Earl Rögnvald to the Holy Land in 1152. After Earl\r\n  Rögnvald’s death, in 1158, the building of the cathedral was carried\r\n  on by Bishop William, until his death in 1168, after which we have no\r\n  record of its progress.\r\n\r\nFootnote 350:\r\n\r\n  The odal tenure of the lands in the islands was first modified by\r\n  Harald Harfagri in the time of the Earl Torf Einar. Earl Sigurd\r\n  Hlödverson restored the odal rights in return for the assistance of\r\n  the Bœndr at the battle of Skida Myre (see Appendix). This arrangement\r\n  subsisted till the imposition of the succession-dues by Earl Rögnvald,\r\n  which were subsequently bought up, as here narrated.\r\n\r\nFootnote 351:\r\n\r\n  Knarrarstad, as has been formerly explained, was applied to the\r\n  district at the head of the Bay of Scapa. It was so called because it\r\n  was the place where the merchant-ships lay—from _Knarrar_, genitive of\r\n  _knörr_, a merchant-ship; and _stadr_, a stance or stead. The name is\r\n  preserved in old estate-lists as _Knarstane_. In the near\r\n  neighbourhood there is an ancient “broch” or “Pictish tower,” recently\r\n  excavated by Mr. George Petrie. Remains of very extensive buildings\r\n  have been found within and around it, evidently belonging to a\r\n  secondary occupation of the tower, of later date than that of its\r\n  original construction. Among the relics found in these secondary\r\n  buildings there are some which correspond with relics of the later\r\n  Viking period found in Scandinavia. This gives a certain amount of\r\n  probability to the supposition that the ruins of this “Pictish tower”\r\n  may have been occupied and utilised by Earl Rögnvald’s men, as we know\r\n  that the similar tower of Mousa, in Shetland, was on different\r\n  occasions, one of which is narrated in chap. xcii. of this same Saga.\r\n\r\nFootnote 352:\r\n\r\n  This incident bears a remarkable similarity to that related in chap.\r\n  lxvi.\r\n\r\nFootnote 353:\r\n\r\n  It is curious that Cæsar has described the ancient Britons as\r\n  observing in his time the same custom of shaving the lower part of the\r\n  chin, and wearing the hair long on the upper lip.\r\n\r\nFootnote 354:\r\n\r\n  Borgarfiord seems here to be a misreading for Breidafiord (the Moray\r\n  Firth), unless we suppose that there was another Borgarfiord besides\r\n  the one in Shetland. Jonæus has _nordr_ instead of _sudr_, thus making\r\n  Swein sail north to Borgarfiord, which in this case would be in\r\n  Shetland. But it is hardly probable that he would have taken Shetland\r\n  in his route from Orkney to the coast of Moray.\r\n\r\nFootnote 355:\r\n\r\n  Dúfeyrar must have been situated on the sandy shore of the parish of\r\n  Duffus, on the Moray coast, _eyri_ signifying a spit of sand. It has\r\n  been supposed, with some degree of probability, that Burghead is the\r\n  place here meant.\r\n\r\nFootnote 356:\r\n\r\n  Ekkialsbakki, probably for Atjoklsbakki. (See note on p. 107.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 357:\r\n\r\n  Hjalmundal, Strath Helmsdale, or Strath Ulli, which runs up along the\r\n  south side of the Ord, the mountain chain separating Caithness from\r\n  Sutherland. The expression “near the middle of Sutherland” must mean\r\n  that Swein came up through the central or inland region of the\r\n  country, and thus came down into Strath Helmsdale, a long way from the\r\n  coast, or “near the middle of the land.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 358:\r\n\r\n  _Ines_ in Jonæus; it has not been identified.\r\n\r\nFootnote 359:\r\n\r\n  Probably Lundy Island, in the Bristol Channel.\r\n\r\nFootnote 360:\r\n\r\n  Syllingar, the Scilly Islands. There was an ecclesiastical settlement\r\n  there in Olaf Tryggvason’s time. It was in the Scilly Islands that he\r\n  was baptized, and embraced the faith which he afterwards propagated\r\n  with the strong hand both in his own kingdom and in Orkney.\r\n\r\nFootnote 361:\r\n\r\n  _Lúdr._—This same signal was used by the army of the Bœndr at the\r\n  battle of Stiklestad (Flateyjarbók, ii. 352). The signal-horn used at\r\n  the present day by the Shetland fishermen still retains the ancient\r\n  name, “the ludr-horn.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 362:\r\n\r\n  _Clavis Rhythmica_, apparently a kind of rhyming dictionary or\r\n  repertory of versification. Torfæus states that this joint production\r\n  of Earl Rögnvald and Hall, Ragna’s son, is still extant in the library\r\n  at Upsala.\r\n\r\nFootnote 363:\r\n\r\n  From the description of Lambaborg, and its situation with regard to\r\n  the coast and the river at Freswick, it seems to have been the\r\n  fortalice now called Bucholly Castle, from a Mowat of Bucholly who\r\n  possessed it in the 17th century, and by whom it was partially\r\n  rebuilt.\r\n\r\nFootnote 364:\r\n\r\n  Probably now represented by Duffus in Moray.\r\n\r\nFootnote 365:\r\n\r\n  This passage supplies the name of a prior of the monastery of May, not\r\n  otherwise on record. (See records of the Priory of the Isle of May,\r\n  issued by the Soc. Antiq. Scot. 1868).\r\n\r\nFootnote 366:\r\n\r\n  See p. 123.\r\n\r\nFootnote 367:\r\n\r\n  See chap. lxxiv.\r\n\r\nFootnote 368:\r\n\r\n  The Stockholm translation of the Saga has “in Vigr,” instead of “in\r\n  the Islands.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 369:\r\n\r\n  In the Saga of Hakon Hakonson it is stated that Kolbein Hruga’s castle\r\n  was on the island of Vigr, now Weir. It was to this stronghold that\r\n  Snækoll Gunnason fled when he had slain Earl John (son of Harald\r\n  Maddadson), the last of the Norse Earls of Orkney, in A.D. 1232; and\r\n  the Saga states that the castle was so strong that it resisted all the\r\n  efforts of the Earl’s friends to take it. In 1529 we learn from Jo.\r\n  Ben that the ruins were still visible. Barry describes it as a small\r\n  square tower, 15 feet square inside, and the walls 7 feet thick,\r\n  strongly built with large stones, well cemented with lime. It is now a\r\n  green mound, like the older Pictish towers; but to this day among the\r\n  peasantry of the locality the mound bears the name of _Cobbie Row’s_\r\n  (Kolbein Hruga’s) Castle.\r\n\r\nFootnote 370:\r\n\r\n  See note on p. 84.\r\n\r\nFootnote 371:\r\n\r\n  Probably in the body-guard of the Greek Emperor, which, the Byzantine\r\n  historians of the period inform us, was composed of natives of the\r\n  remote north, whom they call Varangians. The name Varangi first\r\n  appears with them in the year 935, but they are said to have served of\r\n  old in the body-guard, and to have come partly from Thule and partly\r\n  from England. In the Saga of Harald Hardradi his exploits during his\r\n  sojourn in the East are minutely detailed, and it is recorded that he\r\n  became chief of the Værings, who were at that time in the Imperial\r\n  service. For several centuries these mercenaries in the pay of the\r\n  Emperors were renowned for their bravery, discipline, and fidelity.\r\n  After the Norman conquest of England, a body of Anglo-Saxon youth,\r\n  under Siward of Gloucester, choosing exile rather than the ignominy of\r\n  submission to the conquerors, went to Constantinople, and enrolled\r\n  themselves among the Værings. So many followed them that a mixture of\r\n  Danish and Saxon became the official language of the guards of the\r\n  Imperial Palace. Hoards of Eastern coins and ornaments are almost\r\n  annually discovered in Norway and Sweden, and occasionally in Orkney\r\n  and the North of Scotland. The museum of Stockholm possesses a\r\n  collection of more than 20,000 Cufic coins found in Sweden, dating\r\n  from the close of the 8th to the end of the 10th century, and vast\r\n  quantities of those silver ornaments of peculiar forms and style of\r\n  workmanship, which are also believed to have been brought from the\r\n  East, partly by trade and partly by the returning Værings.\r\n\r\nFootnote 372:\r\n\r\n  The scene of the shipwreck seems to have been near Gulberwick.\r\n\r\nFootnote 373:\r\n\r\n  The MS. translation at Stockholm reads “two Icelanders.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 374:\r\n\r\n  Having studied probably at the University of Paris.

The Saga of Sigurd the Jorsala-farer says that when he\r\n  visited Lisbon, four years after the fall of King Magnus Barelegs\r\n  (circa A.D. 1107), “there lies the division between Christian Spain\r\n  and heathen Spain, and all the districts that lie west of the city are\r\n  occupied by heathens”—meaning Moslems.\r\n\r\nFootnote 379:\r\n\r\n  Njörfasund, the Straits of Gibraltar.\r\n\r\nFootnote 380:\r\n\r\n  Serkland, or Saracen land—the north coast of Africa.\r\n\r\nFootnote 381:\r\n\r\n  _Dromones_, originally used for long and swift ships, was in later\r\n  times applied to the larger ships of war (Du Cange _sub voce_). In the\r\n  early French romances it appears as “Dromons,” and “Dromont.” Matthew\r\n  Paris, in his account of the crusading expedition of Richard I. of\r\n  England (A.D. 1191) notices the capture of a Saracen ship—“navis\r\n  permaxima quam Drómundam appellant.”—_Hist. Angl._ vol. ii. p. 23,\r\n  Rolls Ed.\r\n\r\nFootnote 382:\r\n\r\n  The tying of knots at the Jordan is also alluded to in the saga of\r\n  Sigurd the Jorsala-farer. King Sigurd and his brother Eystein are\r\n  “comparing each other’s exploits,” and Sigurd says:—“I went to\r\n  Palestine, and I came to Apulia, but I did not see you there, brother.\r\n  I went all the way to Jordan, where our Lord was baptized, and swam\r\n  across the river; but I did not see thee there. On the edge of the\r\n  river-bank there was a bush of willows, and there I twisted a knot of\r\n  willows, which is waiting thee there; for I said this knot thou\r\n  shouldst untie, and fulfil the vow, brother, that is bound up in it.”\r\n  The tying of knots seems also to have had another meaning covertly\r\n  alluded to in the stanzas.—(See the story of Gunnhild and Hrut in the\r\n  Njáls Saga, p. 18.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 383:\r\n\r\n  This seems to be no place-name, but a name formed, as the Turks formed\r\n  the name Istambol, from hearing the Greeks constantly talking of going\r\n  “εις την πολιν”—“to the city,” meaning Constantinople.\r\n\r\nFootnote 384:\r\n\r\n  Probably the promontory of Sigeum, at the mouth of the Dardanelles. It\r\n  might be called Ægisness, from its being at the entrance to the Ægean\r\n  Sea. It is called Engilsness in the saga of “King Sigurd the\r\n  Jorsala-farer,” and it is stated that Sigurd’s fleet also lay here for\r\n  a fortnight waiting a side-wind, that they might show off their sails\r\n  (which they had stitched over with silks) as they passed up to\r\n  Constantinople. There was, however, a town called Ægos, at the mouth\r\n  of a stream of the same name, near the northern end of the\r\n  Dardanelles, a little below the modern Gallipoli.\r\n\r\nFootnote 385:\r\n\r\n  See note at p. 127.\r\n\r\nFootnote 386:\r\n\r\n  Manuel I., successor of John Comnenus, who reigned from 1143 to 1180.\r\n\r\nFootnote 387:\r\n\r\n  Dýraksborg must be Durazzo, the ancient Dyrachium, a seaport in\r\n  Albania, on the Adriatic, opposite to Brundusium in Italy.\r\n\r\nFootnote 388:\r\n\r\n  Pull, the ancient Apulia or Puglia, in Italy, on the opposite shore of\r\n  the Adriatic from Dyrachium. Apulia had been under the dominion of its\r\n  Norman dukes from the middle of the eleventh century, and this may\r\n  have been the reason why the route homewards through Apulia was chosen\r\n  both by Sigurd the Jorsala-farer and Earl Rögnvald.\r\n\r\nFootnote 389:\r\n\r\n  Hákon Herdabreid (the broad-shouldered) became King in 1161. (For an\r\n  account of his death, and that of King Ingi and Gregorius Dagson, see\r\n  the sagas of the sons of Harald Gilli and Hákon Herdabreid, in the\r\n  Heimskringla.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 390:\r\n\r\n  Near Bergen.\r\n\r\nFootnote 391:\r\n\r\n  Viken, in the south of Norway.\r\n\r\nFootnote 392:\r\n\r\n  Bishop’s-tongues, a district lying between three rivers in the south\r\n  of Iceland, also mentioned in the Njáls Saga.\r\n\r\nFootnote 393:\r\n\r\n  See note on p. 21.\r\n\r\nFootnote 394:\r\n\r\n  One of the MS. copies of the saga has “Rögnvaldzeyiar.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 395:\r\n\r\n  Harald Hardradi, son of Sigurd Syr, who was slain in the battle of\r\n  Stamford Bridge.

But this would make Arni,\r\n  Rafn’s son, run a good ten miles without once remembering that he had\r\n  his shield on his shoulder until it stuck in the door at Kirkwall. If\r\n  this Kjarekstad be not the same with Knarrarstad at Scapa, which was\r\n  Earl Rögnvald’s homestead (see p. 113), and might be the castle here\r\n  spoken of, there is a Carness near Kirkwall (in old maps Carisness)\r\n  which may be more readily supposed to be the Kjarekstad from which\r\n  Arni ran than Careston near Stromness.\r\n\r\nFootnote 404:\r\n\r\n  Munch says of this passage that the text reads, very improperly,\r\n  “Gáreksey” for “Grimsey.” Hafnarvag he identifies with the Medalland’s\r\n  hofn of Hakon Hakonson’s saga, which is the “Midland Harbour” lying\r\n  between the Holm of Houston and the Mainland on the south side of\r\n  Orphir. The name Hafnarvag, however, simply signifies a landing-place\r\n  in a voe or inlet, and might more appropriately be applied to some\r\n  place near the head of the inlet immediately opposite Grimsey, which\r\n  goes up to the Loch of Stennis. If Harald and his men landed at\r\n  “Midland Harbour,” they took the longest land route to walk to Firth;\r\n  if they landed near the head of the inlet above mentioned, they chose\r\n  the shortest land route.\r\n\r\nFootnote 405:\r\n\r\n  The word Orkahaug is only known to occur twice—once here, and once in\r\n  one of the Runic inscriptions on the walls of the chamber of Maeshow.\r\n  Here it is given merely as the name of the place where Earl Harald and\r\n  his men had a Yule-tide carouse, which disabled two of them from\r\n  proceeding on their journey, so that they failed in surprising Earl\r\n  Erlend at his Yule feast. In the inscription in the chamber of Maeshow\r\n  it appears as the name of the burial-mound which was broken into by\r\n  the Jorsala-farers in search of treasure. There seems to be little\r\n  doubt that this name “Orkahaug” was the name by which the Maeshow was\r\n  then known. The Orkahaug of the text must either mean the actual “how”\r\n  itself, or a homestead near it which was named from it. There is an\r\n  Orkhill (Orquill) not very far from Maeshow, and there was another\r\n  Orkhill near Knarstane, Scapa, which is called Orquile in “the coppie\r\n  of my Lord Sinclairis Rentale that deit at Flowdin.” No other\r\n  Orkahaug, however, is known. (See under Maeshow in the Introduction.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 406:\r\n\r\n  The castle at Freswick, elsewhere called Lambaborg (see p. 122).\r\n\r\nFootnote 407:\r\n\r\n  The mouth of the burn of Freswick.\r\n\r\nFootnote 408:\r\n\r\n  Moseyjar-borg, the burg or castle on the little island of Mousa, in\r\n  Shetland. This curious structure is the best preserved example of the\r\n  old Celtic strongholds, or “Pictish towers,” which were so thickly\r\n  planted over the northern and western districts of Scotland, and\r\n  specially in those districts exposed to the ravages of the Northmen.\r\n  We learn from the Saga of Egill Skalagrimson that fully two centuries\r\n  before the event here narrated Mousa had been occupied in a precisely\r\n  similar manner by a couple who fled from Norway, and after celebrating\r\n  their marriage in the deserted burg, lived in it for a whole winter.\r\n  (See under Mousa in the Introduction.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 409:\r\n\r\n  The Moray Firth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 410:\r\n\r\n  Bly-holmar (lead islands) must refer to a group of islands not far to\r\n  the south of Berwick, probably the Fern Islands.\r\n\r\nFootnote 411:\r\n\r\n  Mosey, the Isle of May.\r\n\r\nFootnote 412:\r\n\r\n  Off Sumburgh Head, now called Sumburgh Roost.\r\n\r\nFootnote 413:\r\n\r\n  Beruvik, probably the inlet at the mouth of the Berriedale water, on\r\n  the north side of the Ord of Caithness, where there is an old tower\r\n  called Berriedale Castle. (See note at p. 18.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 414:\r\n\r\n  This was probably the castle which was destroyed by King William the\r\n  Lion in the end of the twelfth century, when he sent his troops\r\n  against Earl Harald “to Turseha,” and destroyed the Earl’s residence\r\n  there.\r\n\r\nFootnote 415:\r\n\r\n  This is evidently a mistake in the text for Rögnvaldsey, or South\r\n  Ronaldsay. In the MS. the contraction R.ey is used both for Rínarsey\r\n  and Rögnvaldsey.\r\n\r\nFootnote 416:\r\n\r\n  Vidivag, the voe or creek of the beacon; now Widewall, in South\r\n  Ronaldsay.\r\n\r\nFootnote 417:\r\n\r\n  Bardvik, the bay beside Barth Head; now Burswick, in South Ronaldsay.\r\n\r\nFootnote 418:\r\n\r\n  Strandhögg, strand-hewing, or victualling the ships of a viking\r\n  squadron, by driving cattle to the shore, and killing them there.\r\n\r\nFootnote 419:\r\n\r\n  Ru Stoer in Assynt, on the west coast of Sutherlandshire.\r\n\r\nFootnote 420:\r\n\r\n  Walls, in the Island of Hoy, Orkney.\r\n\r\nFootnote 421:\r\n\r\n  Knarston, at Scapa, in the Mainland of Orkney. (See note at p. 113.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 422:\r\n\r\n  Paplay, in Mainland, where Hákon Karl, the brother of Earl Magnus the\r\n  Holy, had his residence. (See p. 96.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 423:\r\n\r\n  Sandwick, in Deerness.\r\n\r\nFootnote 424:\r\n\r\n  The Iceland Annals place the fall of Earl Erlend in A.D. 1154.\r\n\r\nFootnote 425:\r\n\r\n  See p. 74.\r\n\r\nFootnote 426:\r\n\r\n  None of these men are again mentioned in the Saga.\r\n\r\nFootnote 427:\r\n\r\n  In the “Coppie of my Lord Sinclaire’s Rentale, that deit at Flowdin,”\r\n  dating between 1497 and 1503, there is a Tyngwale in Rendale, set to\r\n  John Selatter. The name still remains, but there is no other trace of\r\n  an Orkney thing-stead in the Islands. (See p. 61.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 428:\r\n\r\n  Mackaile and Sir Robert Sibbald both notice the existence of white\r\n  hares in the hill of Hoy. Low, in his “Fauna Orcadensis,” states that\r\n  they did not exist in his day; and he adds, “nor is there a hare of\r\n  any kind to be found in the Orkneys.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 429:\r\n\r\n  Cave Isle—now Eller Holm, a small island between Shapinsay and the\r\n  Mainland of Orkney.\r\n\r\nFootnote 430:\r\n\r\n  This seems to indicate that there was an ecclesiastical settlement on\r\n  Eller Holm. Possibly it may have been the “isle Elon” referred to in\r\n  the stanza made by Earl Rögnvald on the occasion of the singular\r\n  apparition of the sixteen shaven crowns described in chap. lxvi. It is\r\n  suggestive of this that Fordun gives the name of this island as\r\n  Helene-holm instead of Eller Holm. (See note, chap. lxvi.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 431:\r\n\r\n  Völuness has not been identified.\r\n\r\nFootnote 432:\r\n\r\n  This must be Barswick, near Barthhead, in South Ronaldsay, as it is\r\n  afterwards stated that from this headland Rögnvald and Swein saw Earl\r\n  Harald’s ship coming across the Firth from Caithness to Walls.\r\n\r\nFootnote 433:\r\n\r\n  In the text it is “Hrólfsey to R(inans)ey”—Rousay to North Ronaldsay,\r\n  but Munch’s reading of the passage seems to be the true one. (See the\r\n  next chapter.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 434:\r\n\r\n  The Mainland of Orkney. This shows that in all likelihood it is\r\n  Hrossey that is meant where the text has Hrólfsey at the beginning of\r\n  the previous chapter.\r\n\r\nFootnote 435:\r\n\r\n  Probably Rapness, in the south-east of the island of Westray.\r\n\r\nFootnote 436:\r\n\r\n  It does not appear whether this is the Hákon Karl who lived at Papuli\r\n  or not.\r\n\r\nFootnote 437:\r\n\r\n  St. Mary’s, the largest of the Scilly Isles, called Syllingar in the\r\n  Sagas.\r\n\r\nFootnote 438:\r\n\r\n  This was the famous Somerled, styled by the Chronicle of Man “Regulus\r\n  Herergaidel”—ruler of Argyle. This chronicle also adds the information\r\n  that his marriage with Ragnhild was the cause of the ruin of the\r\n  monarchy of the Isles. Although the Saga here makes Swein, Asleif’s\r\n  son, kill Somerled about the year A.D. 1159, we learn from the more\r\n  trustworthy sources of Fordun and the Chron. de Mailros that Somerled\r\n  was killed at Renfrew on the 1st January 1164, having landed there\r\n  with a fleet of 160 galleys in the attempt to make a conquest of\r\n  Scotland. He had given his sister in marriage to Wimund, ex-bishop,\r\n  _alias_ Malcolm M’Heth, whom the Saga calls Earl of Moray. After the\r\n  unsuccessful termination of Malcolm M’Heth’s attempt to gain\r\n  possession of the crown of Scotland, his brother-in-law, Somerled,\r\n  seems to have continued the hostilities against King David, and to\r\n  have joined the party against Malcolm IV. when the attempt was made to\r\n  place the “Boy of Egremont” on the throne. (See Fordun Skene’s ed.)\r\n  II. 250, and Munch, _Chron. Man._ p. 80.\r\n\r\nFootnote 439:\r\n\r\n  Dugald, Reginald, and Angus; from Reginald sprang the Macrories,\r\n  Macdougalls, and Macdonalds of the Isles.\r\n\r\nFootnote 440:\r\n\r\n  This is the Firth of Forth in chapter lxxvii. Here it evidently refers\r\n  to one of the sea-lochs on the west coast, and may probably be Loch\r\n  Gleann Dubh, the inner portion of Kyle Scow. At least the Norse name\r\n  “Dark Fiord,” and the Gaelic “Loch of the Dark Glen,” are suggestively\r\n  similar, and both equally descriptive of the upper part of the Kyle.\r\n\r\nFootnote 441:\r\n\r\n  In reference to this passage, Jonæus, in his edition of the Saga\r\n  (Hafniæ, 1780), says, that what is of the greatest moment is the fact\r\n  which it points out, that at this date (circa 1158) there were\r\n  reindeer in Scotland. In his Latin version of the original he\r\n  translates the phrase “_at veida rauddyri edr hreina_” as “_feras\r\n  rubras et rangiferos venari_,” and has no doubt or hesitancy about the\r\n  matter. It is established by geological evidence that the reindeer was\r\n  widely distributed in Great Britain in post-glacial times, although\r\n  the instances of its occurrence within the human period, and in\r\n  association with the remains of man, have been comparatively rare.\r\n  Recently, however, evidence has been supplied by excavations in the\r\n  ruins of the brochs, or “Pictish towers,” of the north of Scotland,\r\n  which fully corroborates the statement of the Saga that the reindeer\r\n  was actually hunted and eaten by the later occupants of these\r\n  structures, their latest occupation on record being an occasional one\r\n  by the Norsemen. In the refuse-heaps of several of these towers, the\r\n  horns of the reindeer have been found, in some instances cut and sawn\r\n  as if to be utilised for artificial purposes; while in other cases it\r\n  is evident that the animals must have been killed when the horns were\r\n  in the velvet. It is also significant that the reindeer moss\r\n  (_Cladonia rangiferina_) still grows abundantly in Caithness. The\r\n  question is very fully and ably discussed in a paper on “The Reindeer\r\n  in Scotland,” by Dr. J. A. Smith, in the eighth volume of the\r\n  Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.\r\n\r\nFootnote 442:\r\n\r\n  It is plain from the original that some words are here omitted from\r\n  the text. One of the MS. copies of the Saga has had the additional\r\n  words, which are thus rendered in the Danish translation preserved at\r\n  Stockholm, “_Der som vaar noget_ erg, _det kalde vi setter_,” etc.\r\n  “There were there some shielings (erg), which we call setter; and\r\n  there they took up their quarters for the night.” What is remarkable\r\n  about this passage is that the Gaelic word for a shieling, _Airidh_,\r\n  given phonetically by the old Norse saga-writer as “erg,” is glossed\r\n  in the Danish translation by the word “setter”—summer pasturing-place,\r\n  where rude huts were erected for temporary occupation. The word\r\n  setter, which is common in the place-names of Caithness and the\r\n  Northern Isles, is to this day understood by the inhabitants in the\r\n  same sense, although the custom of sending the cattle to the\r\n  hill-pastures in summer, and living in “shielings,” has now ceased, on\r\n  the mainland at least. (See also the note on “Asgrim’s ærgin,” p.\r\n  187.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 443:\r\n\r\n  A Norwegian ell is half a yard. The leap was thus four yards and a\r\n  half.\r\n\r\nFootnote 444:\r\n\r\n  Kalfadalsá, the Kalfadal’s stream, is the Burn of Calder, which,\r\n  issuing from the Loch of Calder, falls into the Thurso water. The\r\n  situation of Kalfadal, a valley running up from the valley of the\r\n  Thurso water towards Forss, is exactly that of the valley of Calder.\r\n\r\nFootnote 445:\r\n\r\n  The word _ærgin_ is not Norse. It is, however, a Norse corruption of\r\n  the Gaelic word for a shieling—_airidh_, plur. _aridhean_, which\r\n  enters into the composition of many of the place-names in\r\n  Caithness—_e.g._ Halsary, Dorrery, Shurrery, Blingery, etc. Asgrim’s\r\n  _ærgin_ is still recognisable in the modern Askary or Assary, near the\r\n  north end of the Loch of Calder. It is curious to find thus\r\n  incidentally in the Saga an indication of the blending of the\r\n  folk-speech of the time, and to find also in the modern names of Norn\r\n  Calder and Scotscalder a record (preserved on the spot) of the time\r\n  when one portion of the dale was possessed by the Norsemen and another\r\n  by the natives. Passing from Calder towards the coast the place-names\r\n  are mostly Norse; and passing from Calder in the opposite direction\r\n  towards the uplands, the place-names are almost entirely Gaelic.\r\n\r\nFootnote 446:\r\n\r\n  The feast of the Assumption of St. Mary, or the 15th August. The\r\n  Iceland Annals give 1158 as the year of Rögnvald’s death.\r\n\r\nFootnote 447:\r\n\r\n  Earl Rögnvald was canonised A.D. 1192.\r\n\r\nFootnote 448:\r\n\r\n  Skrud, a general term for fine cloth and costly stuffs.\r\n\r\nFootnote 449:\r\n\r\n  After the divorce of his first wife Afreka. (See chap. cix.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 450:\r\n\r\n  The Celtic form of her name is Gormlath.\r\n\r\nFootnote 451:\r\n\r\n  This “Malcolm, Earl of Moray,” has a curious history. He appears first\r\n  as Wimund, a monk of Savigny, and priest in the Isle of Skye.\r\n  Afterwards he became Bishop of Man, and subsequently appeared in the\r\n  character of a pretender to the Scottish crown, giving himself out to\r\n  be Malcolm MacHeth, son of that Angus MacHeth who was defeated by King\r\n  David, and slain at Strickathro A.D. 1130. Assisted by Somerled of\r\n  Argyle and by this alliance with the Earl of Orkney, he ravaged the\r\n  western coasts of Scotland, until he was captured by King David, and\r\n  confined in the Castle of Roxburgh in 1134. He was released by Malcolm\r\n  the Maiden after the death of King David, and received from the young\r\n  king the sovereignty of a portion of the ancient kingdom of Cumbria.\r\n  His tyranny was such that his subjects revolted, took him prisoner,\r\n  put out his eyes, and confined him in the monastery of Bellaland\r\n  (Byland), in Yorkshire. (Munch, _Chron. Man._ p. 80.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 452:\r\n\r\n  Thorfinn, the son of Earl Harald, appears on record about the year\r\n  A.D. 1165. In the Chartulary of Scone there is a document by “Harald,\r\n  Earl of Orkney, Hetland, and Cataness,” granting to the monks of Scone\r\n  a mark of silver to be paid annually by himself, his son Turphin, and\r\n  their heirs.—_Lib. Eccles. de Scone_, p. 37. Thorfinn died in prison\r\n  in Roxburgh Castle, after being mutilated by King William the Lion, to\r\n  whom he had been given as a hostage for his father.\r\n\r\nFootnote 453:\r\n\r\n  William the Lion.\r\n\r\nFootnote 454:\r\n\r\n  The “Fagrskinna” has (p. 148) “er fell i Vik”—he fell at Wick; but\r\n  there is nothing to fix the locality of this battle more definitely.\r\n  The tradition of the district points to Clairdon Hill, between Murkle\r\n  and Thurso, as the scene of the encounter. The church which is here\r\n  said to have been erected on the spot where Harald fell, and which is\r\n  spoken of as standing there when the Saga was written, is not now in\r\n  existence. The ruins of a chapel, which was traditionally believed to\r\n  mark the spot, were removed when the ground was brought under\r\n  cultivation by the late Sir John Sinclair. A remonstrance by the late\r\n  Rev. Mr. Pope, of Reay, seems to have had the effect of causing the\r\n  erection of an edifice (now used as the tomb of the Sinclair family)\r\n  over the place where an old chapel stood. It is now known locally as\r\n  “Harold’s Tower.” Large quantities of human bones, and several of the\r\n  peculiarly-shaped Norse swords which Mr. Pope describes as “odd\r\n  machines resembling ploughshares, all iron,” have been dug up in the\r\n  neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nFootnote 455:\r\n\r\n  The Bishop advised the people to allow him first to speak with the\r\n  Earl, in the hope that he would be able to mollify him.\r\n\r\nFootnote 456:\r\n\r\n  This seems to imply that it was at the grave of the holy Tröllhæna\r\n  that the Bishop received his sight. Tröllhæna seems to be the Celtic\r\n  St. Triduana or St. Tredwell, who, according to her legendary history,\r\n  came from Achaia with St. Regulus in the fourth century. Being of\r\n  extraordinary beauty, she was solicited by a Gallic prince, and to put\r\n  an end to his solicitations she cut out both her eyes, and sent them\r\n  to him skewered on a twig. Sir David Lindsay alludes to this:—\r\n\r\n                 “Sanct Tredwall, als, there may be sene,\r\n                  Quhilk on ane prick hes baith her ene.”\r\n\r\n  She died at Restalrig, near Edinburgh, and her tomb there continued,\r\n  so late as Lindsay’s time, to be a resort of pilgrims who came to\r\n  “mend their ene.” There is a chapel dedicated to St. Tredwell in the\r\n  island of Papa Westray, which Munch considers likely to have been\r\n  erected by Celtic ecclesiastics previous to the Norse invasion. There\r\n  was another chapel dedicated to her at Kintradwell, in\r\n  Sutherlandshire, where she is known as St. Trullen; but there is now\r\n  no trace of a St. Tredwell’s chapel in Caithness.\r\n\r\nFootnote 457:\r\n\r\n  The letter of Pope Innocent to the Bishop of Orkney, prescribing the\r\n  penance to be performed by the man Lomberd, who cut out the Bishop’s\r\n  tongue, gives the additional information that when the Earl’s men took\r\n  the “borg” they killed almost all that were in it. (See the\r\n  Introduction.) The “borg,” or castle, at Scrabster, may have been an\r\n  earlier building on the site of the “Bishop’s Castle,” an old\r\n  fortalice on the cliff near the present hamlet of Scrabster, or it may\r\n  have been the ruins of one of the still older Pictish towers, not far\r\n  off, which the Caithnessmen may have occupied for the occasion as a\r\n  defensible position.\r\n\r\nFootnote 458:\r\n\r\n  Eysteinsdal is not now represented in the topography of the district.\r\n\r\nFootnote 459:\r\n\r\n  The battle of Floruvogar took place in 1194, according to the Iceland\r\n  Annals appended to the Flateyjarbók.\r\n\r\nFootnote 460:\r\n\r\n  Shetland then passed into the immediate possession of the Crown of\r\n  Norway. Its revenues were granted by King Hakon Magnusson, in 1312-19,\r\n  to the Mary-kirk in Osloe (Christiania) for the completion of the\r\n  fabric, with the proviso that then they should revert to the crown.\r\n\r\nFootnote 461:\r\n\r\n  According to the Iceland Annals of the Flateyjarbók, King Ingi Bardson\r\n  “took the kingdom” in 1204, and Harald Maddadson died in 1206.\r\n\r\nFootnote 462:\r\n\r\n  The death of Hakon Galinn took place in the year 1214, according to\r\n  the Annals appended to the Flateyjarbók.\r\n\r\nFootnote 463:\r\n\r\n  A spann = 24 marks, or 12 lbs. Scottish.—_Balfour’s Odal Rights_, p.\r\n  99.\r\n\r\nFootnote 464:\r\n\r\n  Halkirk, in the Thurso valley.\r\n\r\nFootnote 465:\r\n\r\n  The Icelandic Annals place the burning of Bishop Adam in the year\r\n  1222, and add that the King of Scots caused the hands and feet to be\r\n  hewn off eighty men who had been concerned in the Bishop’s burning.\r\n  Among the documents found in the King’s treasury at Edinburgh in 1282\r\n  (and subsequently lost) was one entitled: “A quit-claiming of the\r\n  lands of the Bondi of Caithness for the slaughter of the Bishop.” A\r\n  bull of Pope Honorius, dated 23d January 1223, and addressed to the\r\n  Bishops of St. Andrews, Glasgow, Dunkeld, and Dunblane, speaks in\r\n  terms of high commendation of King Alexander’s zealous desire to\r\n  avenge such an unheard-of crime as the burning of a bishop, and\r\n  thoroughly corroborates the Saga account of the manner of Adam’s\r\n  death, stating that these “wolves” and “demons,” having stripped their\r\n  Bishop of his garments, stoned him, mortally wounded him with an axe,\r\n  and finally burned him in his own kitchen. (Theiner’s _Vetera\r\n  Monumenta_, p. 21.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 466:\r\n\r\n  See note at p. 107.\r\n\r\nFootnote 467:\r\n\r\n  The Mainland of Orkney.\r\n\r\nFootnote 468:\r\n\r\n  Haugaheith, now Hoxa, a peninsula on the north-west side of South\r\n  Ronaldsay, on which there are still several ancient grave-mounds, and\r\n  one mound larger than the rest, which has been ascertained to cover\r\n  the ruins of a Pictish tower. The grave-mound of Earl Thorfinn has not\r\n  been identified, but Low mentions that in his time there was a\r\n  tradition that the son of a King of Norway had been buried in the How\r\n  (_haug_) of Hoxa (_Haugs-heith_).\r\n\r\nFootnote 469:\r\n\r\n  Steinsness, in Hrossey, is the “ness” or promontory at the Loch of\r\n  Stennis on the Mainland of Orkney, now so well known as the site of\r\n  the “standing stones of Stennis.” The Norsemen evidently named it\r\n  Steinsness from the stone circles and monoliths which stood on it when\r\n  they first knew it. (See the Introduction, under “Stennis.”)\r\n\r\nFootnote 470:\r\n\r\n  There is a place at Stennis called Havard’s-teigr by the country\r\n  people to the present day; _teigr_ meaning an individual’s share of\r\n  the tún-land.\r\n\r\nFootnote 471:\r\n\r\n  Nithing—cowardly miscreant.\r\n\r\nFootnote 472:\r\n\r\n  The name Magbiód is suggestive of Macbeth, but the date is too early\r\n  for Macbeth Mac-Finlay.\r\n\r\nFootnote 473:\r\n\r\n  Audna is probably the Irish name _Eithne_. Kiarval, her father, is the\r\n  Cearbhal or Carrol of the Irish Annals, who was King of Dublin\r\n  872-887. He is mentioned in the opening chapter of the Landnamabók as\r\n  King of Dublin when Harald Harfagri ruled in Norway and Sigurd was\r\n  Earl of the Orkneys. The two branches of the Hy Ivar, Kings of Dublin\r\n  and Limerick, were the descendants of Ivar the Boneless, son of Ragnar\r\n  Lodbrok.

These Colloquies are reported by the Rev.\r\n    William Knight, who seems to be admirably adapted for the task he\r\n    has undertaken.

The reader who shall give\r\n    himself the benefit and gratification of studying this short volume\r\n    (it will suggest more to him than many of ten times its size) will\r\n    find that I have not been bribed to speak well of it by any praise\r\n    which Dr. Duncan has bestowed on me. The only excuse for alluding to\r\n    it is, that it contains the severest censure on my writings which\r\n    they have ever incurred, though they have not been so unfortunate as\r\n    to escape censure....

And it is no doubt a\r\n  most favourable symptom of the healthiness of Christian thought among\r\n  us, that we are so often able to begin a notice with these words.\r\n\r\n  “We cannot help wishing that such notice more frequently introduced to\r\n  our readers a volume of Church of England sermons. Still, looking\r\n  beyond our pale, we rejoice notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n  “Mr. Ker has dug boldly and diligently into the vein which Robertson\r\n  opened; but the result, as compared with that of the first miner, is\r\n  as the product of skilled machinery set against that of the vigorous\r\n  unaided arm. There is no roughness, no sense of labour; all comes\r\n  smoothly and regularly on the page—one thought evoked out of another.\r\n  As Robertson strikes the rock with his tool, unlooked-for sparkles\r\n  tempt him on; the workman exults in his discovery; behind each\r\n  beautiful, strange thought, there is yet another more strange and\r\n  beautiful still. Whereas, in this work, every beautiful thought has\r\n  its way prepared, and every strange thought loses its power of\r\n  starting by the exquisite harmony of its setting. Robertson’s is the\r\n  glitter of the ore on the bank; Ker’s is the uniform shining of the\r\n  wrought metal. We have not seen a volume of sermons for many a day\r\n  which will so thoroughly repay both purchase and perusal and\r\n  re-perusal. And not the least merit of these sermons is, that they are\r\n  eminently suggestive.”—Contemporary Review.\r\n\r\n  “The sermons before us are indeed of no common order; among a host of\r\n  competitors they occupy a high class—we were about to say the highest\r\n  class—whether viewed in point of composition, or thought, or\r\n  treatment.\r\n\r\n  “He has gone down in the diving-bell of a sound Christian philosophy,\r\n  to the very depth of his theme, and has brought up treasures of the\r\n  richest and most recherché character, practically showing the truth of\r\n  his own remarks in the preface, ‘that there is no department of\r\n  thought or action which cannot be touched by that gospel which is the\r\n  manifold wisdom of God.’ These subjects he has exhibited in a style\r\n  corresponding to their brilliancy and profoundness—terse and telling,\r\n  elegant and captivating, yet totally unlike the tinsel ornaments laid\r\n  upon the subject by an elaborate process of manipulation—a style which\r\n  is the outcome of the sentiment and feelings within, shaping itself in\r\n  appropriate drapery.”—British and Foreign Evangelical Review.\r\n\r\nStudies for Sunday Evening; or, Readings in Holy Writ.\r\n\r\nBy LORD KINLOCH.

Imagine the delight of a little girl who, through\r\n  the munificence of mamma or godmamma, finds herself possessor of Aunt\r\n  Fanny’s tastefully-decorated box. Conceive the exultation with which,\r\n  on raising the lid, she discovers that it contains six whole and\r\n  separate volumes, and then say, you grown-up folk, whose pockets are\r\n  bursting with florins, whether you do not think that a few of your\r\n  pieces of white money would be well laid out in purchasing such\r\n  pleasure for the tiny damsels of your acquaintance, who like to be\r\n  sent to bed with the fancies of a pleasant story-teller clothing their\r\n  sleepy heads with nightcaps of dreamy contentment. The only objection\r\n  we can make to the quality and fashion of Aunt Fanny’s Nightcaps is,\r\n  that some of their joyous notions are more calculated to keep\r\n  infantile wearers awake all night than to dispose them to slumber.
