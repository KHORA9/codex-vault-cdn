They were filled with\r\nAmerican soldiers for duties overseas. They were well camouflaged and\r\nwell convoyed. The previous afternoon they had pulled away from a\r\nJersey City pier, where they had taken on their human cargoes, and\r\nthey were undoubtedly under sealed orders. They had slipped away\r\nquietly from the piers without attracting undue attention, and while\r\nthey moved to the location where they anchored for the night, not a\r\nsoldier's uniform could have been detected from shore even after the\r\nmost scrutinizing search with the best binoculars obtainable. The\r\ndeparture was made without a word of warning and not a fond good-bye.\r\nIt was accomplished with a methodical silence that called for\r\nadmiration. It is the way Uncle Sam does things during war times.\r\n\r\nJust before 9 o'clock on that beautiful June morning, simultaneously\r\nbut without communicating with each other, each of those transports\r\nbegan to weigh anchor, and except for the click, click, click of the\r\nmachinery all was silent. Precisely at 9:05, without the blast of a\r\nwhistle, the sound of a gong, or the hoisting of a signal flag on the\r\nmast, but like so many automatic machines, these vessels turned their\r\nprows to the sea and began their long voyage.\r\n\r\nAmong those who sailed on one of the vessels of this transport fleet\r\nwere the members of the Twenty-ninth Engineers, A. E. F., of which I\r\nwas a member, being attached to Company C. Our departure was an\r\noccasion never to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nAs we glided out of the great harbor and saw first the Statue of\r\nLiberty, then all trace of our native land disappear from sight, and\r\nwe realized that we were on our way to fight the most savage, inhuman\r\nand despicable foe that has ever drawn a lance, a feeling of solemn\r\nthoughtfulness came over most of the boys. Many of them were so\r\naffected, as they knew a certain percentage of us must inevitably fall\r\nin battle, that they went below to spend a few hours by themselves in\r\nserious thought. I am not ashamed to say that I was one of those who\r\nsought solace for my feelings in thoughtful solitude.\r\n\r\nThe vessel upon which we sailed was an Italian transport, by name, the\r\n\"King of Italy.\" It was accompanied by a French and a former German\r\nliner and was convoyed by a destroyer and a cruiser. On the second day\r\nout we picked up four more transports, making seven in all in our\r\nfleet.\r\n\r\nThere were 1,500 American soldiers on our transport and approximately\r\nthe same on four of the other transports. Two of them, however,\r\ncarried more than 3,500 men, making a total of about 15,000 men on\r\nthat one fleet bound for duty overseas. Of the 1,500 men on the King\r\nof Italy, 500 were white and 1,000 colored troops. No trouble was\r\ncaused by this mixture of races because of good management. The white\r\nand colored boys were kept on different parts of the boat and all\r\nguard duty was in the hands of the white troops.\r\n\r\nFor the first few hours after sailing, thoughts of home lingered in\r\nthe minds of most of the boys, but these were hastily banished when we\r\nhad our first life drill. This took place at 2 o'clock on our first\r\nday out. The drill was a thorough one, and it soon became apparent to\r\nmost of the boys that even if we should be torpedoed by a submarine\r\nwhile going across, our troops would have no difficulty in getting\r\naway from the boat before it took its final plunge toward the bottom\r\nof the sea. In the life drill, every man had his place. He was\r\nassigned to a certain boat and could take no other. The lower decks\r\nwere emptied first, and then those above, one at a time. I was bunked\r\non the fifth deck, hence, as the liner had six decks, would have been\r\namong the last to leave the ship, in case of disaster.\r\n\r\nThe object of the life drill, of course, was to make it possible to\r\nempty the boat of troops quickly and in military order in the event\r\nthat the boat became a submarine victim. Every man was instructed at\r\nthe sound of the alarm to go to his bunk and stand there until given\r\nfurther orders. In the meantime, he was to put on his life belt. The\r\nboys marched out to the life boats only when they received orders from\r\ntheir superiors to do so. After a few drills, we mastered the\r\nmanoeuver and it would have been possible for us to have emptied that\r\nboat of 1,500 soldiers in twelve minutes, if such action had been\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nWe had life drills two or three times a day all the way across. The\r\nsignal for the drill was four siren blasts, and when we heard those\r\nblasts, there was a lively time on deck for a few minutes, until the\r\nship, in theory, had been abandoned.\r\n\r\nAmerican people, who believe in giving their soldiers the right kind\r\nof treatment, and particularly wholesome food, would have been\r\nrighteously indignant, if they could have known how poorly we were fed\r\nwhile on that transport. Those at home were buying Liberty Bonds and\r\npaying heavy war taxes so that the boys in the fighting forces would\r\nbe well fed and clothed, and yet, it is hard to imagine how men could\r\nhave been treated worse, so far as food is concerned than were the men\r\nof this boat. I am going to be just as frank as I know how in\r\ndescribing food conditions with the hope that by calling public\r\nattention to this petty graft, such practices will be stopped, so far\r\nas American fighting men are concerned. To any who have weak stomachs,\r\nI suggest that they skip over the next two or three pages, as the\r\ndetails may nauseate them.\r\n\r\nThe kitchens and mess rooms of the transport were on the top deck.\r\nMeal tickets were issued to the men, and when they went to mess, the\r\ntickets were punched. This is the way the Government kept track of the\r\nnumber of meals served, as these tickets were collected when we left\r\nthe boat. The white men were fed first, and the colored troopers\r\nafterwards. This was done so as to keep free of any possibility of\r\nracial trouble, and apparently it worked well.\r\n\r\nAfter the second day out, our \"chow,\" which is the soldier's name for\r\nfood of all kinds, was vile. It consisted largely of spoiled beef and\r\nsuch foods as spoiled rabbits. When I say spoiled, I mean just what\r\nthe word implies. These rabbits were positively in a state of decay.\r\nThey had been in cold storage for a long time, evidently a very long\r\ntime. They had been carried in the ice boxes without being drawn, and\r\nwhen exposed to the air the odor of decay was so strong that they were\r\npositively nauseating. I saw strong men turn exceedingly sick just\r\nfrom the stench, and I do not believe it is an exaggeration to say\r\nthat there was more upset stomachs on that trip from the decaying\r\nrabbits that were given us to eat than from the action of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe beef that we were given consisted of only the poorest and toughest\r\nparts. The good cuts went to the mess for the army officers and for\r\nthe officers and crew of the ship. The potatoes that we were fed were\r\nthe poorest that I have ever seen. They were served about half cooked,\r\nand were small, wet, soggy and unpalatable. It was seldom that a\r\npotato fit to eat was given to the men. We received rice several\r\ntimes, but it was only about half cooked. During one meal we were\r\ngiven bologne sausage, and after some of the boys had eaten their\r\nallotment, the discovery was made that the sausage was full of\r\nmaggots. The soup was like water with neither flavor nor body. The\r\nbread served was Italian-French bread made with sour dough, and not at\r\nall palatable to an American, who has been accustomed to sweet and\r\nwholesome bread. The coffee was of the poorest quality--probably\r\nmostly chickory--and we were given neither milk nor sugar for it. The\r\nresult was that most of the boys did not touch their coffee at all.\r\nThe only seasoning given our food was an insufficiency of salt.\r\nEverything served was tasteless, unpalatable and unwholesome.\r\n\r\nThat there was better food on the boat, we knew, for we could see it\r\ngoing to the officers' tables. They were served chicken two or three\r\ntimes a week--the men never. Officers were given fresh fruit at every\r\nmeal--the men not at all. Officers were given palatable, sweet bread;\r\nthe men only when they would pay for it out of their own pockets and\r\nthen at a big price.\r\n\r\nIt is my opinion that the owners of the boat on which I sailed made an\r\nenormous profit off those meals served to the soldiers. Certainly the\r\nGovernment would not have given the soldiers such unfit food. The\r\nGovernment is to blame to this extent, however, in not seeing that the\r\nship owners lived up to their contract to feed the men properly. There\r\nwas a man on board who was supposed to see that the men were given\r\nwholesome and nourishing food, but he failed absolutely to perform his\r\nduty. Whether he was in the company's pay or simply negligent, I\r\ncannot say, for I do not know. But it is a fact that he did not\r\nperform his duty and 1,500 men were fed spoiled and unnourishing food\r\nas a result. Men who indulge in \"graft\" of this kind are no better\r\nthan traitors, and should be treated as such by the Government.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the uneatable diet we were given, numerous complaints\r\nwere made. We were not long in being told that we could purchase\r\nsomething in the way of wholesome food for ourselves, if we had the\r\nmoney. This was done on the sly. We could purchase a palatable steak\r\nfor $1.50 or $2, or we could get chops for about the same price. A\r\nchicken would cost about $4. All the boys who had money were forced to\r\nbuy food this way or go hungry. Many of the boys ate only enough to\r\nkeep them alive. Often two would go in together and buy a steak or a\r\nchicken, each putting up half of the money. Even then, we could not\r\nget the food we wanted, as only a limited quantity could be \"sneaked\"\r\nout.\r\n\r\nWe could buy sweet bread in the canteen on the boat for 25 cents a\r\nloaf, and a small loaf at that. That was the only way we could get it.\r\nSweet rolls, the kind that sell four for a nickle at home, cost two\r\nfor a nickle. Oranges, apples, bananas and other kinds of fruit cost\r\n25 cents each. Unable to eat the food in the mess room, most of the\r\nboys had to pay the exorbitant prices asked at the canteen or go\r\nhungry.\r\n\r\nWe had no sugar at all. The Government must have provided a sugar\r\nration for us, so my conclusion is that it was stolen by someone in\r\nconnection with the boat management and used in some form of graft.\r\nBecause it was necessary for them to buy so much of their food, all\r\nthe boys who had money with which they expected to buy things when\r\nthey landed on the other side, were without a penny when the boat\r\ndocked.\r\n\r\nEvery afternoon between 2 and 3 o'clock, the Y. M. C. A. workers who\r\nwere on the transport came on deck and held song services. Many\r\nfamiliar hymns were sung. These meetings were very popular at first,\r\nbut gradually the fascination for them wore off, and toward the latter\r\npart of the voyage they were but lightly attended.\r\n\r\nThe \"Y\" workers did promote one form of entertainment, however, that\r\nthe boys thoroughly enjoyed. This was boxing. Every afternoon several\r\nbouts would be held. Nearly every company had a fighter and he was\r\nmatched with the best man of some other company. Lively bouts of about\r\nthree or four rounds were fought. The colored soldiers took to this\r\nsport keenly and they furnished some good contests among themselves.\r\nWhite men, however, were not permitted to box the colored soldiers, as\r\nsuch a bout might have led to a racial difference. Members of the\r\nship's crew also wanted to partake in the sport and they furnished\r\nseveral bouts. The sailors, however, were somewhat awkward at first,\r\nbut they were game and they afforded us many a good laugh. Those who\r\nhad charge of the boxing never let a bout go to a knockout. When one\r\nman was apparently getting the worst of it or was clearly outboxed,\r\nthe bout would be stopped.\r\n\r\nVery strict rules were issued on the boat with regard to lights at\r\nnight. Every porthole was closed, and every precaution taken so that\r\nnot a gleam of light could be seen. The men were warned that anyone\r\nwho attempted to make a light would be shot on the spot. The fleet\r\nmoved along in the darkness at full speed ahead. That it did not meet\r\nwith accident was due to excellent management on the part of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAll the boats in our fleet were camouflaged. The King of Italy had\r\ngreat irregular streaks of black and white painted across it. One of\r\nthe boats in our fleet had a really remarkable picture of a sinking\r\nship painted on its side. Another had two ships painted on its side\r\nand was camouflaged to look like two vessels instead of one. While the\r\ncamouflaged ships appeared strange at first, we soon were used to the\r\nunusual appearance, and thought nothing of them. A camouflaged vessel\r\nis visible to the naked eye, almost as plain as one that has not been\r\ndaubed with paint, but it is through the mirrors of a periscope that\r\nthe camouflage is effective. In reflecting the picture on the horizon,\r\nthe mirrors lose some of the rays of light, so officers explained to\r\nme, hence the eyes of the periscope are unable to detect the\r\ncamouflage.\r\n\r\nOur voyage passed pleasantly with smooth seas until the eleventh day,\r\nwhen the water was a little choppy, and then for the first time some\r\nof the boys were a little sea sick.\r\n\r\nIt was my fortune to see our first and only brush with a submarine. It\r\nhappened about 4 o'clock in the morning on the twelfth day out. The\r\nsea was choppy and the night very dark and cold. I was on guard duty\r\non the sixth deck of our vessel, and I noticed unusual activity on the\r\npart of the destroyers that were convoying our fleet. Our transport\r\nstopped dead still. In a moment four shots were fired from the\r\ndestroyer. I could see the fire from the gun plainly. It was an\r\nexciting moment and the first real guns of war that I had ever heard.\r\nDepth bombs were also dropped, then all was still again. All this\r\nhappened without disturbing the men asleep on our boat, and in the\r\nmorning they were told that the transport had been attacked by\r\nsubmarines. It was the belief that the destroyer had sunk one of the\r\nU-boats.\r\n\r\nWe were given orders on the twelfth day to sleep in our clothes with\r\nour life belts on during the rest of the trip. This was issued so that\r\nthere would be no delay in getting off the boat if we were hit by a\r\ntorpedo. That night, being unused to sleeping with clothes on, was a\r\nrestless one for most of us. The following night, however,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that we were fully dressed, we slept well.\r\n\r\nWe were also joined on that day by a flotilla of destroyers. The sight\r\nof these boats was hailed with joy, for we knew we were nearing land.\r\nWe had not been informed, however, in what country nor at what port we\r\nwould land, but we had hoped that it would be France, and we soon\r\nlearned that our destination was France.\r\n\r\nThe torpedo boat flotilla that accompanied us during the last two days\r\nwas made up mostly of American and British destroyers, though there\r\nwere two French boats among them. They made a lively scene, and surely\r\ngave us great protection. If a speck would appear on the horizon, two\r\nboats would be off to investigate it, and would return later to join\r\nthe fleet. We were also accompanied on the last day of the voyage by\r\ntwo airplanes as a further protection against submarines.\r\n\r\nWe sighted land on the thirteenth day, and it was a welcome view.\r\nEverybody was happy and eager to disembark. It was quite a contrast\r\nfrom the feeling that existed just after we left New York harbor. We\r\nwere a merry crowd as we entered the harbor of Brest and we were glad\r\nto see a large city again. We disembarked at 3 o'clock in the\r\nafternoon. Before leaving the boat, we were given \"leaving rations,\"\r\nwhich consisted of a loaf of sour bread, a can of bully beef and a\r\nsmall piece of cheese. This was given to us because we had a long\r\nmarch ahead and our kitchens would not be in place for several hours.\r\nWe were taken off the transport on barges built especially for that\r\npurpose. We were then marched to the Napoleon Barracks, built by the\r\nEmperor Napoleon, eight miles from Brest, and were glad to put our\r\nfeet on land again, even though the march was a long one after a\r\nthirteen day sea voyage. We had only a passing glimpse of Brest, but\r\ndid not mind that as we knew we would have opportunity to visit the\r\ncity later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nOur First Glimpse of France\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Brest, the American soldiers got their first idea of the magnitude\r\nof the work that the American Government was doing in the prosecution\r\nof the war. Prior to our arrival there we had heard a great deal about\r\nthe construction work in French ports that the Americans had\r\nundertaken, but our ideas of just what this work was, were more or\r\nless vague. At Brest we saw just what it was. We saw miles of concrete\r\npiers that had been built in record-breaking time with American skill,\r\nAmerican speed and American thoroughness. This work was a revelation\r\nto all France, and the magnitude of the task, together with the\r\nremarkably short time in which it was completed, stamp it as one of\r\nthe wonders of the war and as a lasting tribute to American ingenuity\r\nand efficiency. These piers and warehouses of American construction\r\nplayed a great part in ending the war, for they enabled the American\r\nGovernment not only to land millions of troops in France, but to\r\nprovide adequate food, ammunition, guns and other necessary supplies\r\nfor these men. Nothing like it had ever been done before in the\r\nhistory of the world.\r\n\r\nSoon after we left the boat at Brest, the men were lined up on the\r\npier and given a sensible and appreciated address by the Commanding\r\nOfficer. He told us that now more than ever before, since we were upon\r\nforeign soil, orders were to be obeyed to the letter. We were told to\r\nbe careful in all that we did because by our actions the French people\r\nwould judge the American nation. He advised us to do everything\r\ncommanded of us by our officers with snap and thoroughness, so as to\r\nshow the French people that we were not raw recruits; that we were\r\nreal soldiers; that we could do as well at any task, if not better,\r\nthan the soldiers of Europe. The boys, to a man, lived up to those\r\ninstructions, and it was not long before the world knew that the\r\nAmerican soldier was the equal of any on earth.\r\n\r\nAfter this interesting advice was received we swung into squad right\r\nand our first march on French territory began. We first marched more\r\nthan a mile through the railroad yards in Brest. These were all of\r\nAmerican construction. We saw miles of warehouses, filled with various\r\nkinds of material of war and great quantities of food, not only for\r\nthe American soldiers, but for the civilians of France as well. These\r\nwarehouses were of wooden construction, and so different in design and\r\nmaterial from other buildings in Brest that we recognized at once that\r\nthey were built by Yankees. For this reason, we greeted them as\r\nfriends; it was like looking upon a familiar scene.\r\n\r\nMost everything else, however, that met our eyes had a decidedly\r\nforeign look. The railroad trains in the yards were French, and\r\nentirely different from those of this country. The freight cars have a\r\ndiminutive look. They are only about half the size of American cars\r\nand they rest upon single trucks. The locomotives are much smaller\r\nthan ours and have brass boilers. We did not see anything of the\r\nfamiliar dark red American box car and the giant American locomotives\r\nuntil we got into the interior of France.\r\n\r\nWe passed many peasant women and children while we were marching\r\nthrough the railroad yards. Some of them were offering cakes and nuts\r\nfor sale, others were begging white bread from us. It was here that we\r\nfirst heard those two French words that became so familiar to us\r\nbefore we left France, \"Donnez moi.\" It was \"donnez moi\" this and\r\n\"donnez moi\" that, especially from the children who begged cigarettes,\r\npennies, and anything else that the American boys might have to give\r\naway.\r\n\r\nBrest is built on hills, some of which rise abruptly and give a\r\npicturesque look to the old city. As we marched through the residence\r\npart of the city, the women from the windows gave us a hearty welcome,\r\nwaving flags and calling \"Vive les Amerique.\" Our march took us over a\r\nwinding roadway through the district where the poorer classes lived\r\nand we did not get a view of the more attractive parts of the city on\r\nour arrival. The street we marched along was paved with broken rock\r\nand was in excellent condition; it was crossed several times by\r\noverhead railroad tracks built on massive arches of masonry.\r\n\r\nOur first impressions are rather difficult to describe because\r\neverything had such different appearance from familiar things in\r\nAmerica. One noticeable feature was the character of the construction.\r\nThe buildings are of stone or some other such inflammable material,\r\nwith roofs of slate or tile. There are no frame buildings, except\r\nthose that have been constructed by Americans since April, 1917.\r\n\r\nThe dress and the habits of the people differ materially from those of\r\nAmerica. Most of the lower classes wear sabots, or wooden shoes. Some\r\nwear sabots with leather tops. But few, if any, all leather shoes are\r\nin use among the lower classes. While all shades and colors of clothes\r\nwere worn by children, we noticed that the women were nearly all\r\ndressed in black. This, we believed to be because they had lost\r\nrelatives in the war, and we later found that our conclusion was the\r\ncorrect one. Among the poorer classes the men wear large loosely\r\nfitting trousers and tight jackets. They wear a peculiar hat, with a\r\ntightly fitting crown, a broad round brim, and two streamers of black\r\nribbon about eighteen inches long hanging down in back. The middle\r\nclasses dress more like Americans, though not with as well made\r\nclothes as one is accustomed to see in this country.\r\n\r\nAfter marching about five miles, we were given a rest in an open field\r\nin the outskirts of Brest. Here we were again addressed by an officer\r\nand cautioned to be careful about coming in contact with the French\r\npeople, and particularly with the women and children of the lower\r\nclasses. We were informed that the lower classes of women and the\r\npeasant children are nearly all syphylitic, especially in seaport\r\ntowns. This sent a shudder through us, for we had already been\r\nfondling some of the French children, before we realized the necessity\r\nfor caution. The warning was heeded and thereafter the boys kept the\r\npeasants at a distance.\r\n\r\nAs we resumed our march, we began to get into a cultivated district.\r\nThe rolling land along the roadway was cut up into small farms ranging\r\nin size from a half acre to about two and a half acres. The boundary\r\nlines of these farms were hedges; there were no fences, such as we\r\nhave in America. The land was planted to truck gardens, berries, fruit\r\ntrees, etc., and at the time that we saw them, they were in good\r\ncondition and apparently quite productive.\r\n\r\nIt was about 6 o'clock in the evening and after a long and hard march\r\nthat we arrived at the Napoleon Barracks, where we were to have a few\r\ndays' rest before going into the interior. These barracks are quite\r\nextensive. They are built of stone and are surrounded by a stone wall.\r\nThe wall is about three feet thick and twenty feet high, and it would\r\nbe a difficult matter for anyone to scale it. To keep soldiers from\r\ntrying to get out, broken glass is cemented into it for the entire\r\nlength on top. The purpose of this was to make it so dangerous that\r\nno soldier would attempt to climb it. There are two arched gateways\r\nleading to the interior. These archways are fitted with heavy gates,\r\nwhich were originally designed as defense gates in case of attack. The\r\nmain buildings within the enclosure are of two stories and are built\r\nof stone. We were not long in being assigned to the bunks that we were\r\nto occupy during our stay. These were two decked affairs with a\r\nmattress of slats about two inches apart to sleep on. They were about\r\nas uncomfortable as anyone can imagine and most of the boys preferred\r\nto sleep on the floor. These barracks had been occupied by many\r\nAmerican boys who had gone before us. We saw thousands of American\r\nnames written on the walls, and occasionally we would run across one\r\nthat we knew. And, like the other, we too wrote our names, for the\r\nboys who followed to read and comment upon.\r\n\r\nOur meal for the first night at the barracks consisted of the rations\r\nwe had been given upon leaving the ship--bully beef, sour bread and\r\ncheese. Our cooks got their fires started and gave us some coffee,\r\nwhich stimulated us after our long and tiresome march.\r\n\r\nAfter eating, we were permitted to write to our folks at home, and all\r\nof us spent the evening in correspondence. We were not permitted to\r\nwrite while on board ship, so most of us had several letters to send.\r\nI wrote until 11 o'clock that night. I was surprised to find that it\r\nwas not yet dark. The long and appreciated twilight is due to the fact\r\nthat Brest is a great distance farther north than Sacramento, and this\r\nwas in the middle of summer, when the evenings are longest.\r\n\r\nNot all of the buildings within the walls at the barracks are of\r\nancient construction. Several were recently built, such as a hospital,\r\na bath house for the accommodation of our men, the Y. M. C. A. hut,\r\netc. At this particular place the \"Y\" hut was appreciated by us\r\nbecause it afforded us amusement, we could buy fruit, cakes, tobacco\r\nand other articles there, and we could attend to our correspondence\r\nthere. We were assembled there on one occasion to hear two addresses\r\non the ways and habits of the French people, which were to benefit us.\r\nWe also exchanged our American money at the hut for French money. For\r\na dollar we received five francs and seventy centimes, and it was\r\namusing to see the boys studying over the French money system, as it\r\nwas difficult to understand at first. Some of the boys, not knowing\r\nthe value of the French franc, paid enormous prices for fruits,\r\ncandies, etc., to French women and girls, who peddled these articles.\r\n\r\nWhile at the Napoleon Barracks we saw the first American wounded. They\r\nwere soldiers who had participated in the defense against the German\r\ndrive which began in March, 1918. It was from them that we first\r\nlearned the real horrors of war. Some had only one arm; others had\r\nlost a leg; still others were suffering from shell shock. Those who\r\nwere suffering from shell shock were the most pitiful, as the least\r\nunusual noise startled them.\r\n\r\nI had the good fortune to be placed on a motor truck detail during\r\nthree days of our brief stay at Brest. This gave me an opportunity of\r\nseeing most of the city. It has about 120,000 inhabitants, is one of\r\nthe chief ports of France and has a harbor that is protected by nature\r\nas well as by strong fortifications. Lying as it does, among the\r\nhills, there is much natural beauty in the city and its surroundings.\r\nThe streets are about as wide as those of the average American city,\r\nalthough there are a number of very narrow streets that cut into the\r\nmain thoroughfares at angles and these reminded me somewhat of the\r\nnarrow streets of Boston. The city is kept clean and there are\r\nnumerous parks and public squares. The latter are frequented mostly by\r\nwomen and children, though it is not uncommon to see French soldiers,\r\nhome from the front on leave, lounging in them. The warm blooded\r\nFrench people have ideas that differ widely from those of Americans in\r\nmany respects, and it is nothing unusual to see a French couple making\r\nlove in broad daylight with persons passing by on all sides, in one of\r\nthese public parks. Occasionally one would see an American soldier\r\nsitting with a French Mademoiselle. French troops were often drilling\r\nin these squares--not troops that had participated in the war, but\r\ncompanies of younger men who were being trained for war. It was\r\ninteresting to watch them and to contrast their manoeuvers with ours.\r\n\r\nThere are no skyscrapers in Brest, that is to say, there are no tall\r\noffice buildings there, although the city is an important business\r\npoint. The only tall structures are the churches and an old castle,\r\ndating from the thirteenth century. The business buildings are all of\r\ntwo or three stories. The stores are not as up to date as the retail\r\nestablishments in America, and the methods of doing business are\r\nentirely different from ours. Goods are not on display in the open as\r\nthey are in American stores, but are kept in show cases. If you are\r\ninterested in a certain piece of goods, the clerk takes it out of the\r\nshow case and exhibits it to you. If you do not buy it, the article is\r\nplaced right back in the show case. The clerks are mostly girls. They\r\nare plainly dressed but always neat. Most of them wear black. They are\r\nby no means as well dressed as American girls who work in stores. The\r\nFrench store employes are very poorly paid, the average wage for a\r\nclerk being two and a half francs, or about 50 cents in American money\r\na day.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, Brest was very much of a cosmopolitan city. On the\r\nstreets most any day could be seen the uniforms of the soldiers and\r\nsailors of all the Allied nations--French, British, Italian,\r\nPortuguese, American and others. The uniforms of the different nations\r\nare of different hues and they gave a tinge of color to the crowds on\r\nthe streets. They ranged from spotless white to faded blues. The\r\nuniforms of the Italian soldiers, in my opinion, were the most\r\nattractive. They were a pretty gray, well made and attractive in\r\ndesign. The uniform of the American soldier, while not the prettiest,\r\nis the most serviceable. For war use it is no doubt the best. The\r\nBritish wear uniforms very much like ours, although a little different\r\nin shade and design. They are serviceable and neat but not attractive.\r\nThe coat has a small lapel and large brass buttons that are always\r\nwell shined. The home guards of the French army wore flashy coats and\r\ntrousers. The trousers were either blue with a broad red stripe or red\r\nwith a blue stripe.\r\n\r\nI regret that our brief stay in Brest did not give me a better\r\nopportunity to see the mediaeval churches and castles in the vicinity.\r\nBut war is serious business with no time for sightseeing and on the\r\nthird night after our arrival, we received our orders to march at 4\r\no'clock the following morning. It was a restless night for we knew\r\nthat every day from now on would take us nearer to the front and to\r\nthe fight. At 3:30 o'clock on the morning of our departure we were all\r\nup and dressed and were packing our belongings. We came to company\r\nfront promptly at 4 o'clock, just as the dawn was breaking; in a very\r\nfew minutes we were marching out of the historic Napoleon Barracks\r\nnever to see them again. The morning was cool and crisp; it was\r\nconducive to lively marching and we stepped along at a fast clip,\r\npassing three companies of infantry on the way to Brest. The march was\r\nan eight mile \"hike\" and we made it without a stop until we reached\r\nthe railroad yards at Brest. We were then assigned to compartments in\r\nFrench railroad coaches. Most of them were second and third class\r\ncoaches, although there were a few first class cars for the officers.\r\nThere were five compartments to a car and eight men were assigned to\r\neach compartment; as we also had to make room for our luggage, we were\r\ncrowded and uncomfortable. However, we made the best of the unpleasant\r\nconditions, and patiently awaited the starting of the train, which was\r\nto take us through a country new and strange to us, and nearer to the\r\nwar zone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nFrom Brest to Langres\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore our train pulled out of Brest we were ordered out of our\r\ncrowded compartments in the French railroad coaches for the purpose of\r\nbringing in traveling rations. These consisted of canned bully beef,\r\ncanned jam, canned beans and bread. The bread that was given to us\r\nhere was made into enormous loaves--the largest that any of us had\r\never seen. The loaves were sixteen or eighteen inches wide, from two\r\nand a half to three feet long and eight or nine inches high. They were\r\nAmerican-made and were white and wholesome. The outside crust was hard\r\nbut palatable and the inside was soft and flaky like home-made bread.\r\nWe afterwards learned that these loaves had been baked weeks in\r\nadvance and that they were kept fresh and palatable by the use of a\r\nchemical. Each compartment of eight men was given three of these large\r\nloaves which, together with a number of cans of beans, bully beef and\r\njam, were to keep us supplied with food until we reached Langres, in\r\neastern France, which was our destination. We had previously\r\nlearned--on our trip overseas--to conserve food, and none of this\r\nsupply was wasted. We stored it away in our cramped quarters and saw\r\nthat it got proper care.\r\n\r\nAs we sat in the train waiting for it to start, we looked out upon the\r\nbay of Brest and saw numerous tugs busy along the waterfront. They\r\nwere all engaged in war work of some kind. We also saw more American\r\ntroops being landed at the wharf, just as we were landed a few days\r\nprevious, and we knew their thoughts and feelings. In the air there\r\nwere several airplanes and dirigible balloons giving needed protection\r\nto the ships that were entering the harbor.\r\n\r\nWhile we were still in the yards of Brest, we also saw for the first\r\ntime in France, numerous Chinese coolies, who were doing with their\r\nlabor their part toward winning the war. They worked on the railroad\r\ntracks in large gangs. To the Eastern boys who were not acquainted\r\nwith this class of Chinese laborers, they were quite a curiosity, but\r\nto the Western boys, the sight was nothing unusual. The coolies,\r\nhowever, were not dressed in the customary Chinese clothes, as in\r\nCalifornia, but were in a garb more like that which American laborers\r\nwear. They had on overalls, loose blouses or jumpers, heavy leather\r\nshoes and straw hats.\r\n\r\nWe pulled out of Brest about 10 o'clock in the morning. The train was\r\nmade up of about twenty-five or thirty of those small and\r\nuncomfortable French coaches, and it moved very slowly. To one used to\r\nthe fast first-class American trains, this French train seemed\r\nexceedingly slow, unaccommodating and tiresome. We first climbed\r\ngradually up the hills, overlooking the bay, and were furnished with a\r\nwonderful view. We could see far out to sea, and were in part\r\ncompensated for the lack of comforts to which an American is\r\naccustomed when traveling, by the beauty of the scenery, and the many\r\nstrange and interesting sights that were constantly meeting our eyes.\r\n\r\nSoon after we left the ocean we came to a fertile farming section, in\r\nwhich crops of various kinds, such as grains, fruits, garden truck,\r\netc., were grown. We had known that the farms in European countries\r\nare small, especially those of France, as compared with farms in\r\nAmerica, but it was necessary for us to see the actual size of these\r\nsmall farms to realize how diminutive they are. As in the vicinity of\r\nBrest, mentioned in a previous chapter, the cultivated areas ranged in\r\nsize from a half acre to two and a half acres. Rarely we would see a\r\nplace as large as five acres, but that was the exception. No fences\r\nseparated these farms, but the boundaries were marked by hedges and\r\noccasionally a low stone wall. In these small fields cultivation is\r\nnot practiced as in this country, but the land is tilled in narrow\r\nstrips. The numerous different textures of the soil, accounted for the\r\nlarge number of strips. Each strip was planted to a crop to which it\r\nwas best suited.\r\n\r\nThe highways through this farming section are kept in excellent\r\ncondition. They are built of rock and give the impression from the\r\ntrain window that a motor trip through France would be a delight. Rows\r\nof trees are planted along all the highways, the poplar tree\r\npredominating, but other trees being used frequently as well. The\r\nby-roads are of dirt but appear to be kept in good condition. They\r\nalso have trees planted along them; this seems to be a characteristic\r\nof France, and readers will recall that in all war pictures where\r\nthese roads have been shown, the rows of trees are always there. This\r\nis an excellent feature and one that California with its rapidly\r\nincreasing mileage of concrete roads, might well follow.\r\n\r\nVery few automobiles were seen on these highways, except those engaged\r\nin war transportation. Of course at the time that I made my\r\nobservations, the country was engaged in war, and in peace times no\r\ndoubt more automobiles belonging to civilians are in use. It is a\r\nfact, however, there are comparatively few automobiles among the civil\r\npopulation of France. Only the very rich own them. The masses of the\r\npeople do not possess them, as in America. The civil population either\r\nwalk along these highways or travel in horse-drawn carts and wagons.\r\nThe carts are different from any that we see in America. Frequently\r\nthey are heavily constructed with wheels of from six to eight feet in\r\ndiameter. They are fitted with brakes, which are used on the grades.\r\nThey have a long body, that is, long for a cart, and this is laden\r\nwith the varied products of the small farms which are in this way\r\ntaken to market. Most frequently these carts are drawn by one horse,\r\nthough it is not unusual to see two or three horses hitched to one\r\nwhen the load is heavy. When more than one horse is used, the animals\r\nare not hitched abreast, but tandem. The wheel horse is hitched\r\nbetween two long heavy shafts and his duty seems to be largely that of\r\nsteering the unwieldy conveyance, while the front horse or horses do\r\nmost of the pulling. The harness is heavy and the rear horse is\r\nprotected from sores that might be caused by rubbing, by a heavy and\r\nwell padded saddle and a heavy girth. It was a common sight to see a\r\nwoman driving one of these carts and guiding the wheel horse and\r\nhandling the brakes, while boys were either driving or leading the\r\nleaders. These strange and cumbersome rigs, so different from any that\r\nwe had ever seen before, interested and amused us.\r\n\r\nThe crops in the section through which we passed on our first day out\r\nof Brest appeared to be good. They gave me, a Californian with\r\nconsiderable farming experience, the impression that agriculture has\r\nbeen very carefully studied by the French. Occasionally we would see\r\nsmall tracts lying fallow, apparently to give the land a needed rest,\r\nwhile other tracts were being cultivated. On some of the small farms\r\nit was haying season. We were surprised as we noted the methods of the\r\nFrench farmer in this particular branch of husbandry. The hay was cut\r\nmostly by women and children with scythes. An American mower probably\r\nhad never been seen there. It seemed like a tremendous waste of human\r\nenergy to see these women and children doing such hard manual labor in\r\nthe field, when a modern mower would cut the entire field in a very\r\nshort time. It seems to me there should be a field for the sale of\r\nAmerican mowers and other modern American farm machinery in the rural\r\ndistricts of France. While the farms are so small that the individual\r\nfarmer could not, perhaps, afford to buy a mower, still, several\r\nfarmers could go in together and buy one, or the community as a whole\r\ncould buy one, for the common use of all who needed it. Here is\r\nsomething that the French and American Governments might get together\r\non, for surely the French want to conserve the energy of their women\r\nand children who now do this hard work, and the Americans want a wider\r\nmarket for their modern farm equipment. It must be said, however, that\r\nthe women of the French peasantry who were doing this hard work,\r\nappeared strong and healthful, and were enured to this difficult\r\nlabor, no doubt, through many generations of this hard farm life.\r\n\r\nWe noticed as we got away from the coast, that there was a change in\r\nthe style of dress of the peasants. We no longer saw the round hats\r\nwith the ribbon streamers hanging down behind, so familiar in the\r\nrural districts around Brest. The dress of the peasants, farther in\r\nthe interior, was more like that of the laboring classes of America.\r\nThe men and women both wore serviceable clothes of dark material, but\r\nfew of them wore anything on their heads. Sabots were worn instead of\r\nleather shoes. The women wore a sort of an Arctic sock over the\r\nstockings; the men frequently wore no socks at all. Occasionally the\r\nsabots would be several sizes too large for the wearer, but were made\r\nto fit by stuffing straw in them. This must have been rather\r\nuncomfortable, but the French peasantry seemed not to mind it at all.\r\n\r\nWhile the horse is the principal draft animal in France, oxen are\r\nalso used by some farmers. Most Western boys have seen teams of oxen,\r\nas they are still in use in some of the mountain districts of\r\nCalifornia, or at least they were still in use up to a few years ago;\r\nbut to the Eastern boys an ox team was a new and interesting sight,\r\nand there was much comment upon it.\r\n\r\nThe first large city at which we stopped after leaving Brest was\r\nNantes. This is a popular and ancient city, famous for the edict of\r\nNantes, and more famous still, perhaps, because of the revocation of\r\nthat edict by Louis XIV, which led to disastrous religious wars.\r\nNantes is also famous as the birthplace of Jules Verne, whose \"Twenty\r\nThousand Leagues Under the Sea,\" became an actuality during the world\r\nwar. It is a city of about 150,000 and is an important industrial\r\ncenter, having extensive shipyards, factories, wharves, etc. It is on\r\nthe right bank of the Loire River, about thirty-five miles from its\r\nmouth and is one of the chief ports of entry of France.\r\n\r\nNantes has a very interesting history and it contains many ancient and\r\nfamous edifices. It was not our privilege, however, to see any more of\r\nthe city than the views afforded from the train, for we stopped here\r\nbut a short time. It was there that we got our first taste of French\r\ncoffee, which is very different from that made and served in America.\r\nIt was furnished to us by the French Government. At first it was\r\ndistasteful to us, but after drinking it a few times we became used to\r\nit and later on we really liked it.\r\n\r\nWe were now in the rich valley of the Loire, one of the most\r\nproductive and one of the most famous in France. It is not nearly so\r\nlarge as the Sacramento Valley, in California, nor as fertile, yet its\r\nfame extends around the world. It is drained by the Loire River, which\r\nis the longest river in France, being more than 600 miles in length,\r\nand being navigable for ships as far as Nantes and for river boats\r\nfor more than five hundred miles of its length.\r\n\r\nIn the valley of the Loire we began to see the beautiful vineyards of\r\nFrance. In this district the farms as a rule were a little larger than\r\nthose we saw on our way from Brest to Nantes, and consequently the\r\nhedges were less numerous. It was an exceedingly picturesque scene\r\nthat met our eyes as we rolled along in the slow train. One noticeable\r\nfact was that each little vineyard was of a different shade of green\r\nfrom that of its nearest neighbors, due perhaps, to a different\r\nvariety of plant, or to a variation of soil. There seemed to be no two\r\nof just the same shade. It was also in the Valley of the Loire that we\r\nsaw considerable fruit production. Orchards were more numerous here\r\nthan on the coast. They were planted to most of the deciduous trees\r\nwith which we of California are familiar, although prunes seemed to\r\npredominate.\r\n\r\nWhile we were traveling through this valley we were greeted with some\r\nfamiliar sights and sounds. These were the American box car and\r\nlocomotive and the sound of the whistle of a U. S. A. train. We\r\ngreeted the American rolling stock as companions, and were truely glad\r\nto see them. We could easily distinguish between the sound of the\r\nwhistle of an American locomotive and that of a French engine, the\r\nAmerican whistle being deep and the French shrill. It may seem strange\r\nto think that I comment upon such a small matter as a locomotive\r\nwhistle, but when one is in a foreign land, amid foreign scenes and\r\nsounds, a familiar sound is good to hear, even though it is as\r\nunmusical as a deep blast of an American-made locomotive.\r\n\r\nOur next stop at a place of importance was at Tours--historic Tours.\r\nThis is a city of more than 100,000 inhabitants and is one of the most\r\ninteresting cities in France.\r\n\r\nI spent several weeks here in a hospital after being gassed on the\r\nMetz front and I will speak in more detail of this city in a later\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nAt Tours we were given more freedom than at any previous stop, and\r\nhere our officers bought chocolates, tobacco and fruit and distributed\r\nthem among the men. These dainties were the first we had since leaving\r\nBrest and were surely appreciated.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Tours we continued to wind through the Valley of the\r\nLoire along the Loire River, and I must say that the vineyards and\r\norchards between Tours and Orleans, our next stop, were the prettiest\r\nthat I saw in all of France. In this particular part of the valley the\r\ntrees and vines are exceedingly prolific, as compared with trees and\r\nvines in other parts of France. They are not, however, as prolific as\r\nthose of California. The trees do not attain as large a growth as\r\nthose of this State and the vines are less vigorous. The fruit is\r\nneither as large nor does it have the quality of ours. The 1918 fruit\r\ncrop was a large one, as measured by French standards, but yield per\r\nacre, I am sure, would be small as compared with the yield per acre of\r\na first class Sacramento river orchard. The difference of the quality\r\nand the yield as compared with our fruits, is undoubtedly due to the\r\nfact that for centuries the lands of the Loire have been cultivated,\r\nwhile our lands are new and contain all their natural richness. The\r\nvineyards are planted differently from ours. The vines are four feet\r\napart one way and eight feet apart another, while ours are usually\r\nplanted eight or ten feet apart each way. Having been reared on a\r\nCalifornia vineyard, I was naturally very much interested in the\r\nvineyards of France, and I examined those that I had the opportunity\r\nof visiting very carefully. I inspected some of the grapes that were\r\npronounced first class by French vineyardists, and found them to be\r\nvery inferior to California grapes. The berries were smaller and they\r\ncontained less juice.\r\n\r\nThe farther we traveled into the interior of France, the more\r\ninterested the people became in us. In other words, the nearer we came\r\nto the scene of action, the greater was the enthusiasm of the French\r\npeople over our arrival. While we excited but small interest in the\r\nsmall towns on the coast, as we got closer to the front, there were\r\ndelegations of women and children at the station waving to us at every\r\nsmall or large town through which we passed. Cries of \"Vive\r\nL'Amerique\" were more frequent, and we had hopes that the persistent\r\n\"donnez moi\" would be heard less frequently, but it was not. We never\r\nceased hearing it as long as there were French children around.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Orleans late in the evening of the third day of our\r\ntrip, and here we received a very hearty welcome from the American Red\r\nCross, as we did at Tours. The station at Orleans was more like an\r\nAmerican station than any that we had yet seen in France. It was large\r\nand equipped with several tracks, as are most American stations.\r\nOrleans is full of interest, but we were not permitted to stop there\r\nlong. We continued on our journey all night and the next day were out\r\nof the Valley of the Loire and into a hilly section. While the scenery\r\nwas attractive, there were fewer cultivated areas and the soil was\r\nless productive. We now began to see more of the American war\r\nactivities in France. We saw tented cities that had been built for\r\ntroops in record time; we saw camps where American soldiers were being\r\ndrilled; and we saw great quantities of American implements of war\r\nsuch as airplanes, ammunition, light and heavy artillery, etc. In this\r\nregion we also passed three hospital trains coming from the front with\r\nAmerican soldiers who had been wounded, and we knew we were getting\r\nvery near the fighting. We also noticed a decided difference in the\r\nFrench inhabitants. We detected a deeper interest in the war among\r\nthese people who were so near the battle line than in those farther\r\naway, and we noted that not a young man was to be seen among the\r\ncivilians in eastern France--they were all at the front fighting to\r\nsave their homes from the ruthless Hun.\r\n\r\nAt 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the fourth day after we had left\r\nBrest, we arrived at Langres, which was our destination, so far as\r\ntrain travel was concerned. It was a great relief to leave those\r\ncrowded compartments in that uncomfortable train. The distance from\r\nBrest to Langres by the route we traveled probably does not exceed six\r\nhundred miles, yet it took us four days and three nights to make the\r\ndistance. A first class American train would cover the same distance\r\nin about sixteen hours. At times our train moved so slowly that a man\r\ncould get out and keep up with it by running along the side. There\r\nwere no conveniences on the train, such as American travelers are\r\naccustomed to. For instance, there were no toilets, and the train\r\nwould stop every three or four hours at some small station where\r\nlatrines were provided for our use. No one knows how miserable we were\r\non this trip, and the only thing that kept the boys from complaining\r\nwas the fact that the country was new to us and strange sights and\r\nscenes made us forget our discomfort. Still, we did not have things as\r\nbad as some of the American boys, who were compelled to travel across\r\nFrance in box cars.\r\n\r\nWe were all glad to stretch our legs at Langres, and after we were\r\ngiven a little refreshing exercise, we were loaded on motor trucks and\r\ntaken to our barracks, located in a stone building formerly used as a\r\nconvent.\r\n\r\nThe city of Langres is beautifully situated. It is on a hill that\r\nrises from a plateau. It is a city of great antiquity, dating from the\r\ntime of the Romans. There can be no doubt but that its original\r\nlocation was selected because of its strategic position, as it is on\r\nthe summit of a ridge and commands the situation in every direction.\r\nIn mediaeval times it was a stronghold for the feudal lords and in\r\nmodern times it is still of importance as a fortress. The city is\r\nsurrounded by a defense wall, built hundreds of years ago, and around\r\nthe outside of the wall was a moat, wide and deep. In feudal days this\r\nmoat was part of the defense works and it was kept filled with water.\r\nIt was dry when we visited and has been so for many years, as a moat\r\nwould be but as slight obstructure in modern warfare. But it made the\r\ncity well nigh impregnable in the mediaeval days before gunpowder was\r\ninvented and when most fighting was of the hand to hand kind. We\r\nentered the city through an arched gate and crossed the moat on a\r\nbridge which could be drawn up in case of attack. At present the gate\r\nis always kept lowered, but it could be drawn up if necessary. It was\r\neasy to picture in the mind's eye as we looked at these relics of\r\nformer days, the feudal barons of the age of chivalry, sallying forth\r\nfrom this ancient stronghold on their steeds to make war or to plunder\r\nand prepared to retreat behind this moat and wall where they would be\r\nsafe in the event that they were opposed by superior forces. I could\r\nnot but think, as I stood upon this historic ground, that we ourselves\r\nwere making history and that the fight that we were then preparing to\r\nmake, while less romantic than the skirmishes of the feudal barons,\r\nwas vastly more important to the welfare of the world.\r\n\r\nSituated as it is upon an eminence, a view that is beyond description\r\nis to be obtained from Langres. From the ramparts one may see the\r\nupper valley of the Marne with its checkerboard of farms of various\r\nhues; the Vosges; and on a clear day the white peak of Mont Blanc, one\r\nhundred and sixty miles distant.\r\n\r\nIn strong contrast with the way in which ancient warriors entered\r\nLangres, we were loaded onto motor trucks and taken up the steep and\r\nwinding way that led to the gates of the city by means of the most\r\nmodern way of transportation. Our eyes were fastened on the oddities\r\nof this strangely interesting city as we wound through the streets,\r\nsome of which were narrow, others wide, past well kept parks and\r\nbuildings older than most of the modern governments, and we were\r\nfilled with a sort of reverence for this historic spot as we took our\r\nplaces in the barracks made ready for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nNearing the Front\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter we were installed in the barracks at Langres and had our\r\npersonal belongings straightened out, we were given the day to\r\nourselves. This was the first freedom that we had had since our\r\narrival in France. The boys, of course, all went to the business\r\nsection of the city, where many of them were given their first glimpse\r\nof French customs and French methods of merchandising. As I had been\r\nfortunate in getting into the business section of Brest while we were\r\nthere, this was not new to me, but to most of the boys it was a novel\r\nexperience. They spent their time and much of their money in the\r\nFrench stores, buying small articles of various kinds. One oddity of\r\nthe freedom that we were given here was the fact that the American\r\nsoldiers, although forbidden to buy alcoholic liquors in America, were\r\npermitted to buy them without restrictions in France, and it is only\r\ntelling the plain truth to say that many of them sampled the French\r\nbeers, wines and cognac.\r\n\r\nI had an experience in a French barber shop that may be of interest,\r\nas it shows the difference between French and American barbers. The\r\nFrench barber does his work very rapidly, in fact so rapidly when he\r\nis shaving that the patron wonders whether or not he is going to get\r\nout of the chair uninjured. I ordered a haircut, a shave, a shampoo\r\nand a face massage. I had much difficulty at first in making my wants\r\nunderstood, particularly as to the manner in which I wanted my hair\r\ncut. This finally made clear, I sat in the chair and the barber went\r\nto work on me with his sharp shears. His hands moved like lightning\r\nand it seemed like no more than two minutes that he had the job done.\r\nIt was the fastest hair cutting I ever witnessed and a good job, too.\r\nHe then proceeded to shave me, and for speed he exceeded his already\r\nphenomenal record as a hair cutter. He put a thin lather on my face\r\nand then with a thin razor--the thinnest I ever saw--he slashed off a\r\nfour days' growth with six strokes--one down the right cheek, one down\r\nthe left cheek, one across the entire upper lip, one--a fancy curved\r\nstroke--across the chin, then up one side of the neck and a final\r\nstroke up the other. In less time than it takes to tell, the job was\r\ndone, and it was a clean smooth shave too. But while he was slashing\r\nthat razor around I was uneasy. It was my first and last experience\r\nwith a French barber; thereafter, it was safety first. The massage was\r\nexcellent, but what impressed me about the shampoo was the small\r\namount of water used. Water must be costly in Langres from the way\r\nthat barber conserved it, but with no more than a handful of water, he\r\ndid his work well. The face waters used by French barbers are all\r\nhighly perfumed, in fact, too much so for the rough Westerner. When a\r\nman leaves a barber shop he carries a sickening sweet aroma with him\r\nand his friends know where he has been when he is as much as a hundred\r\nyards away. It may be of interest to note that the shave, hair cut,\r\nshampoo and massage cost me two and a half francs, or a little less\r\nthan 50 cents American money. The price of the same service in the\r\naverage American shop at the present time (August, 1919) would be\r\nabout $1.65.\r\n\r\nThe following day the men in our detachment were assigned to various\r\nkinds of work at Langres. I was given a motor truck to drive. It was\r\nin very poor condition and my first duty was to get it in working\r\norder. I spent three days overhauling it and had it in fair\r\nserviceable shape. But after putting all this work on it, I had the\r\npleasure of running it only about three days, for I received orders,\r\nalong with 208 others, to pack and get ready for a special course in a\r\nmilitary school. I had only half an hour's time to get ready, but at\r\nthe appointed time I was prepared to go, and with the boys chosen for\r\nthe schooling, was loaded onto a motor truck and taken to Fort St.\r\nMenge, one of the numerous protecting forts around Langres. This was\r\nan old fort, apparently built many years ago. It was situated on the\r\nsummit of a mountain and was surrounded by a moat, which, however, was\r\ndry. It was substantially built and exceedingly interesting. The\r\nbarracks were built underground and of stone. They were sealed and\r\nwere water-tight. Soil from ten to fifteen feet in depth covered these\r\nstone compartments and they were proof from the bombs of other days,\r\nbut would have but feebly resisted the modern high explosives. There\r\nwere also several tunnels leading from various parts of the interior\r\nto the outer walls, so that men could be taken to any part of the fort\r\nthat might be attacked without being exposed to the enemy's fire.\r\nAbout a thousand men could be billeted there.\r\n\r\nWater for this fort was supplied from two deep wells and raised by a\r\npeculiar lift pump, different from any that I ever saw before. It was\r\na sort of combination of a lift and pressure pump and was of European\r\ndesign and manufacture. The wells were deep and the water good, for\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nOn the day after our arrival there we commenced our work. We were\r\ngiven a stiff drilling for three weeks, with scarcely a minute's rest.\r\nWe often worked until two or three o'clock in the morning. Our daily\r\nroutine was as follows: Arise at 5 o'clock; breakfast at 6;\r\ncalisthenics and manual of arms drill from 6:30 to 7:30; instruction\r\nfrom 8 to 12; lunch from 12 to 1; instruction from 1 to 5; evening\r\ninstruction from 7 to 10, and often until 1, 2 or 3 o'clock the next\r\nmorning. It was here that we received advanced learning in\r\nintelligence lines for our work in the war.\r\n\r\nWe studied with French and American instruments such as were then\r\nbeing used by the Allied armies on the western front. I cannot\r\ndescribe these instruments in detail or tell much about our\r\ninstruction because I have given my oath never to reveal any of the\r\ndetails of this work. I am permitted, however, to name some of these\r\ninstruments, such as the subterranean microphone, sizorscope,\r\nhoroscope, perpendicular and horizontal range finder, elongated\r\nthree-power French binocular, instruments for determining the height\r\nof airplanes, etc. We had to acquire a practical knowledge in the use\r\nof all these instruments, as they were to be our future implements of\r\nwarfare, and in matters of this kind, accuracy is of vast importance.\r\nWe also had to learn the signals of the French, British, Italian and\r\nAmerican aviators; the international Morse code; to send and receive\r\nmessages perfectly under all conditions; to have a practical knowledge\r\nof the use of telephone and telegraph instruments; their attention and\r\nrepair; and how to keep the lines of communication in working order at\r\nall times and under any and all conditions.\r\n\r\nFrom this brief summary, it can be readily understood that the\r\nGovernment crowded plenty of work upon us during those three weeks. At\r\nthe completion of the courses examinations were given, and only 86 of\r\nus out of a class of 208 succeeded in reaching the required\r\npercentage. Of the others most remained to take the course for\r\nanother three weeks, while a few were released from the work as not\r\nqualified for that particular kind of service.\r\n\r\nAll the time that we were studying we were drilled just as though we\r\nwere actually at war. We were compelled to dig in, to find the range\r\non certain objects and to direct imaginary artillery fire upon them.\r\nWe had to find the range of airplanes that passed over us, just as\r\nthough they were enemy planes. This drilling was as near like actual\r\nwarfare as it was possible to make it and because of this, we grasped\r\nthe meaning of our work and the details very quickly.\r\n\r\nWe were also drilled thoroughly in the art of camouflage. To be\r\nsuccessful in camouflage, one must learn to imitate nature and that is\r\nwhat we had to study, and one's tracks must always be covered. A\r\nsuccessful bit of camouflage not only deceives the eyes of the enemy\r\naerial observers, but it also deceives the lens of the enemy camera.\r\nTo make this perfectly clear, it should be said that the lens of\r\ncameras used in warfare are exceedingly delicate and frequently when\r\nthe plate of an aerial photograph is developed, it reveals a spot that\r\nmeans some extraordinary work on the part of the enemy, which the eyes\r\nof the aviator did not detect. It can be readily understood,\r\ntherefore, that unless the camera is also deceived, the camouflage has\r\nnot been well done, for enemy planes, having located the spot by means\r\nof their photograph, could plan to bomb it, but if the plate did not\r\nshow anything, then the camouflage is successful.\r\n\r\nWhile we were at Fort St. Menge we received our gas masks and we were\r\ncompelled to go through many gas mask drills. This was done so we\r\nwould become efficient in putting them on when we got to the front\r\nline. With a little practice we got so we could adjust them in a\r\nremarkably short time. We were also given our steel helmets while\r\nhere, and we realized fully that we were getting nearer and nearer to\r\nthe scene of action, and that our sham warfare would soon give way to\r\nactual fighting. We were also drilled in rifle shooting and by the\r\ntime we were ready to leave, we were in every way fit to participate\r\nin the great struggle in which we were soon to take part.\r\n\r\nAs soon as our schooling was completed, we were told to get ready to\r\nleave for Langres, so we packed up and we were compelled to \"hike\"\r\nback to that city. At Langres we spent two days in getting ready for\r\nthe front. We were ordered to leave fully equipped with the best of\r\nthose things that we had to have. This meant that new articles were\r\nissued to many of us. For instance, if a man had a pair of shoes that\r\nwas partly worn, he was given a new pair, and some of our old clothes\r\nwere turned in for new garments. These were two busy days and our time\r\nwas entirely occupied in getting ready. We were limited as to the\r\nthings we could take with us. We were given our barrack bags and told\r\nto put in these bags all the things that we had to leave and that\r\nthose of us who returned would receive their bags when they got back.\r\nMy bag contained a number of toilet articles, clothes and other\r\narticles that I took with me from the United States. I never saw that\r\nbag again, as I was gassed and wounded and never went back to Langres,\r\nbut I suppose that it has long since become the property of some one\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nWhen we were ready to leave Langres we marched with full equipment to\r\na station three miles from the barracks we were leaving, where we were\r\nbilleted in wooden billets. Here we spent the night. We had to get up\r\nat 4 o'clock in the morning to take an early train. It was a bitter\r\ncold morning, but we did not notice this much, as we were on our way\r\nto the scene of action and our thoughts were on the future. A cup of\r\ncoffee, a couple of doughnuts and a bun was the only breakfast that we\r\nhad, but it was all we wished. We carried traveling rations, of which\r\nwe made good use later on. We boarded the train at 4:30 o'clock and\r\nrode on a fast passenger train until 11 o'clock, when we arrived at\r\nToul. We traveled in second and third class passenger coaches. At Toul\r\nwe were well received by the Red Cross, which furnished us with some\r\nfood, and this, together with our traveling rations, provided us with\r\na hearty meal.\r\n\r\nWe left Toul at 1 o'clock and marched toward the front. We were soon\r\nwithin the sound of the heavy guns. We continued on the road for\r\nseveral hours, and then, as we were getting into the zone where shells\r\nfell occasionally, we were told to thin out our ranks so that if a\r\nshell fell among us our casualties would be light. From then on, we\r\nmarched about eight or ten feet apart in single file on each side of\r\nthe road. We were ordered to wear our steel helmets as a protection\r\nagainst shrapnel. Some did not see the need of doing this, but most of\r\nus were glad to take the precaution. We crossed several narrow gauge\r\ntracks on our march, and saw trains carrying supplies of all kinds to\r\nthe battle front. They were pulled by gasoline engines. We also saw\r\nour first barbed wire entanglements. These were built back of the\r\nlines as a protection to the French in case the Germans should break\r\nthrough on that front. They were about twenty-five feet in width and\r\nextended north and south as far as the eye could see. Later on we saw\r\nbarbed wire entanglements as much as 250 feet in width, put up as a\r\nbarrier to the Boche, should they break through.\r\n\r\nAirplanes were now very numerous. They were darting back and forth at\r\nvarious heights. We were anxious to see an airplane battle, but none\r\ntook place on that front on that day. We could see observation\r\nballoons in the distance. Those in the very far distance we knew to be\r\nenemy observers.\r\n\r\nWe marched until 7 o'clock, when we reached a woods, where we were\r\npermitted to stop. We were given our evening meal, which consisted of\r\nbully beef and hard tack. The woods was our sheltering place for the\r\nnight. Some of the boys said they slept well that night, but I will be\r\nabsolutely truthful and say that I did not. The knowledge that we were\r\nunder shell fire and the unforeseen events that the immediate future\r\nheld in store for me so weighed upon my mind that I could scarcely\r\nclose my eyes. I really do not understand how any of the boys slept.\r\nWe could hear the screech of the shells as they whizzed by, but,\r\nfortunately, none of them hit near us. Only a few days before several\r\nhundred American boys were gassed in this same woods, and our gas\r\nguard kept a close watch for gas shells.\r\n\r\nThe next day we proceeded on toward the Verdun front. We marched all\r\nday long, with only occasional stops. We were not in the open,\r\nhowever, going from one woods to another; when we marched in the open,\r\nonly small bodies of men would move at a time. At 11 p.m. we stopped\r\nmarching and made our camp for the night. Most of the boys were so\r\nweary from their long \"hike\" that they wrapped up in their overcoats,\r\nlay down on the ground and went right to sleep. We remained three days\r\nhere waiting for orders. We were near the front, could hear the guns\r\nall the time and the occasional rattle of a machine gun. When our\r\norders did finally come, we were told to march back over part of the\r\nsame route we had come and we finally stopped close to Novient. It was\r\nhere that we saw our first action and it was here that we finished our\r\neducation in the work that we were to do under the supervision of the\r\nFrench, who held this front before it was taken over by the\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPreparation for Battle\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were billeted at Novient for three days in wrecks of buildings that\r\nhad been ruined by Hun shells. At first we did not do much work\r\nbecause it was not definitely known whether or not we were to remain\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAlthough we were in the war zone and under shell fire at all times, we\r\nwere amazed when we learned that there were still a few French\r\npeasants in the vicinity. These were mostly old men and old women, and\r\na few, but very few, children. These peasants would not leave their\r\nold homes, though requested to do so by the French Government. They\r\npreferred to remain there and be killed by a Hun Shell, if that was to\r\nbe their fate, than to leave the spot that they so dearly loved. The\r\nyoung men of these towns were all fighting at the front and the young\r\nwomen had gone to the larger cities, farther from the front, where\r\nthey found employment at good wages.\r\n\r\nMost of these old peasants kept a cow or two and a few chickens and\r\nthey sold milk and eggs to the American soldiers, thus realizing a\r\nsmall profit for their great hazard. We paid seven francs or about\r\n$1.35 for a dozen eggs and four francs or about 70 cents for a gallon\r\nof milk. We were indeed glad to get these luxuries, even at these\r\nprices and considered ourselves fortunate. In Novient two beer shops\r\nwere also conducted and sold the soldiers light wines and beers, the\r\nprices being one franc or nearly 20 cents for a small bottle of beer,\r\nfive francs for a bottle of red wine and from seven to ten francs for\r\na bottle of white wine.\r\n\r\nAfter three days at Novient, we moved forward toward the trenches,\r\nwhere we were to complete our training for work in the Flash Service.\r\nAt this time we were divided into small detachments, there being\r\nfourteen men in the detachment to which I was assigned. We were taken\r\nto a woods about a mile and a half from Novient, and there had our\r\nfirst introduction to the French S. R. O. T., or service similar to\r\nour Flash Service.\r\n\r\nIn this woods we were billeted underground, where we were protected\r\nfrom shell fire. Each detachment was billeted with an equal number of\r\nFrench, and it was from the fourteen French in our detachment that we\r\nwere to complete our education for the special work for which we were\r\npreparing. In other words, we were to learn the practical application\r\nfrom the French of the knowledge that we had learned in the school at\r\nFort St. Menge.\r\n\r\nOur first experience in actual war work was in an observation tower in\r\nthis woods. This tower was 65 feet in height. It was cylindrical in\r\nform and built of steel about half an inch in thickness. The interior\r\nwas about five feet in diameter. In the tank (so-called) was a lookout\r\npost for observation work. It had small slits on all sides that could\r\nbe readily opened and shut, through which we were to take our\r\nobservations. We entered the tower through a trap door in the bottom,\r\nand the men working at the post locked the door while they were at\r\ntheir duty. The tower was erected in a thick growth of tall trees, and\r\nwas well camouflaged. It was securely hidden from Hun eyes, yet gave\r\nus a full view of the Hun trenches in that vicinity. It was from this\r\ntower that I first saw the enemy, and got my first glimpse of the Hun\r\nlines and got my first full view of a modern battlefield.\r\n\r\nThe French outer trench was only one-quarter of a mile from this\r\ntower. The German trenches were just a little way beyond those of the\r\nFrench, the distance varying from fifty yards to a quarter of a mile,\r\naccording to the terrain. With our strong glasses, we could get an\r\nexcellent view of everything that Fritz did in this part of the line.\r\n\r\nIn this tower the French taught us their secrets of observation in\r\nmodern warfare. They showed us how to locate German batteries, machine\r\ngun nests, railroads, troop movements, supply trains, aerial activity,\r\nobservation balloons, etc. We paid particular attention to watching\r\nhow often Hun airplanes arose, where they crossed our lines, whether\r\nor not they were fired on by our anti-aircraft guns, the number of Hun\r\nplanes in the air, the purpose of their flights, etc. It was\r\nparticularly important to get the point where the German aviators\r\ncrossed the Allied lines. Their planes followed a system in this so as\r\nto try to avoid our anti-aircraft guns. They would cross at a certain\r\npoint for one or two days, then, believing that if they attempted to\r\ncross there again they would meet with a warm reception, they would\r\nchange the location, thus keeping the Allies guessing all the time.\r\nThe French remained with us about ten days, during which time we\r\nacquired sufficient knowledge to take up the work ourselves, and the\r\nAmerican troops then took over this section of the line.\r\n\r\nOur conveniences while here were not good, but they were as good as we\r\nexpected. We accepted our lot without protest. All our provisions had\r\nto be carried in at night on our backs, as it would have been\r\ndangerous for a supply train to attempt to bring anything in during\r\nthe day. There was no water at all in our immediate vicinity. That\r\nwhich we used for cooking and drinking purposes had to be carried from\r\na spring about three-quarters of a mile distant. While going to this\r\nspring on one occasion, we located a blackberry patch, which gave us a\r\nlittle diversion. We conserved our flour for several days, and then\r\npicked enough blackberries for pie. On two occasions we had blackberry\r\npie and it is no exaggeration to say that it was absolutely the best\r\nmorsel of food that any of us had ever tasted. It was a luxury, I\r\nventure to say, that but few soldiers in the extreme front line\r\ntrenches were privileged to enjoy.\r\n\r\nA few days after the French left this front to us, we became aware\r\nthat we were preparing for some big military manoeuver. What it was,\r\nof course, we were not told; we knew, however, that it was to be on a\r\ngigantic scale. It subsequently developed that we were preparing for\r\nthe great St. Mihiel drive, that wonderful independent plunge into\r\nGerman lines by American troops, which straightened out the St. Mihiel\r\nsalient and showed definitely to the Germans that ultimately they were\r\nto be defeated.\r\n\r\nA brief description of this preparation may be of interest. Our first\r\nintimation of this manoeuver was the bringing up of great quantities\r\nof ammunition. This was placed in the woods and well camouflaged.\r\nNext, heavy artillery came up in greater quantities than we had any\r\nidea that the American army had in France. Then light artillery was\r\nbrought up in numbers proportional to the heavy guns. Then thousands\r\nof fresh troops were marched up and placed under the cover of the\r\nwoods. These men marched up at night, so as not to be seen by Hun\r\nairplanes. It should be stated here that during this preparation\r\nAllied air machines had complete mastery of the aerial situation and\r\nas soon as a Hun plane appeared on the horizon, it was pursued until\r\nit either was brought down, or it escaped back to its lines.\r\n\r\nWhile the infantry was stationed in these woods, no time was lost. The\r\nmen were given their final instructions in fighting Bosch. They were\r\ndrilled hard every day and they became particularly efficient in the\r\nuse of the bayonet, a weapon that in the hands of a Yank the Germans\r\nfear worse than anything else that I know of. Rifle practice, of\r\ncourse, could not be indulged in while in these woods, because the\r\nnoise might attract German attention, but bayonet drills never\r\nceased. Thorough drilling was also given in the use of machine guns.\r\nMen were instructed how to repair guns, were told what to do in case\r\ncertain parts of the gun were injured, were shown how to take guns\r\napart and put them together again, and before the end of the drilling,\r\nthese men became as efficient in machine gun work as Fritz himself.\r\n\r\nThe last step of the preparation was the bringing up of the tanks.\r\nThese came up at night in great numbers. There were tanks of all\r\nkinds, from the huge British machines to the \"petite\" or little French\r\ntank. These were also camouflaged and concealed in the woods. After\r\nthe tanks were brought up, their gunners were given a final thorough\r\ndrilling in the use of their guns, their machines, etc. We had never\r\nbefore seen such a vast equipment of war material.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to express my feelings during the final days of this\r\npreparation. I knew that something of a gigantic nature had been\r\nplanned and that the time was close at hand. I also knew that whatever\r\nit was it would surely succeed, for nothing could resist the combined\r\nforce of all that preparation when the final word was given. I cannot\r\nbut admit that enormous quantity of ammunition, the vast number of\r\nlight and heavy guns, the thousands of men ready for the fray, caused\r\nme to feel a certain indescribable sadness, for I knew, that although\r\nsuccess was sure to follow our drive, some of these brave boys were to\r\npay the price with their lives. On September 11th, the boys were\r\ndrilled for the last time. We were then required to strip our bodies\r\nof all our clothes and to smear ourselves with a salve. This was a\r\npreparation that was designed to protect the body from burns in case\r\nwe encountered the deadly mustard gas.\r\n\r\nAfter dark and all during the night there was a steady stream of men\r\ngoing to their positions in the trenches. They knew that the time for\r\nthe manoeuver to start was near, but whether it was to be 24 or 48\r\nhours, they did not know. But we of the Flash Service did; we knew\r\nthat at one minute past midnight on the morning of September 12th, the\r\nzero hour, the Germans were to be given their great surprise party,\r\nand we counted the minutes as they were ticked off the watch until\r\nthat time arrived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nThe Great St. Mihiel Drive\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was exactly at 12:01 o'clock on the morning of September 12th, when\r\nthe great St. Mihiel drive began, and when all the preparation of\r\nwhich I told in the preceding chapter was brought into play in the\r\nfirst great independent movement of American troops, which was to give\r\nthe Germans a warning of what they were to expect from the army from\r\nacross the seas, of which they had so sneeringly spoken. The drive\r\nopened with a demoralizing barrage, the greatest of the kind that, up\r\nto that time, had ever been laid down by artillery. It greatly\r\nexceeded in the number of guns brought into action and in amount of\r\nammunition used, any barrage that either the Germans or the Allies\r\nhad, prior to that time, attempted. It was like letting hell loose\r\nupon the Germans in the salient at all points within the range of our\r\nguns. Language is inadequate to describe this barrage and none except\r\nthose who were actual participants in the drive will be able to\r\nvisualize in the mind the terror that General Pershing's guns belched\r\nforth on that momentous occasion. Those who have imaginative minds may\r\nbe able to form some faint conception of what this great battle was\r\nlike, if they can picture thousands of guns--heavy, medium and\r\nlight--belching forth their fire with ceaseless regularity for six\r\nlong hours. It was pitch dark when the first guns opened with their\r\nroar, but it was not long before the heavens were lighted with a\r\nbrilliant pyrotechnic display, something like elaborate Fourth of July\r\nfireworks, but multiplied by millions in intensity. The heavy\r\nartillery spit forth long flames as they were discharged. The long\r\nflash, the rapidity with which it is dashed from the gun muzzle, and\r\nits sudden disappearance, reminded me of a serpent's tongue. And\r\nserpents' tongues they were, indeed, to German hopes, for as sure as\r\nthese are facts, the St. Mihiel drive sealed the doom of the despised\r\nHuns. As far as the eye could see, these flashes were being repeated\r\nat stated intervals, and in front of them were the smaller and more\r\nrapid flashes of the medium artillery; and adding their flame, smoke\r\nand noise to the din far out in front was the famous light artillery,\r\nwhich did such effective work throughout the war.\r\n\r\nIt was not long after the barrage began before the Germans began to\r\nthrow star shells. These were for the purpose of lighting up No Man's\r\nLand. They are thrown to a height of several hundred feet, and as they\r\nslowly descend, they burn a brilliant white light. These added to the\r\nbrilliancy of the fireworks. The object of the Germans in throwing\r\nthese star shells was to keep No Man's Land lighted so as to be ready\r\nto repel our attack. They knew, of course, that our barrage was to be\r\nfollowed up with a charge, but they did not know at what hour it was\r\nto be launched. The star shells were thrown so that they could not be\r\ntaken unawares in the dark.\r\n\r\nFar behind the line in Fritz' territory we could see our shells\r\nbursting. The telltale flash meant that the Huns were getting a dose\r\nof severe medicine, though we could at that moment only guess at the\r\ndestruction that was being wrought. Later we were to see the havoc\r\nworked by our accurate artillerymen.\r\n\r\nThe object of this demoralizing barrage was to break up the morale of\r\nthe Germans and in general to pave the way for our infantry charge\r\nthat was to follow. It shattered the German trenches, plowed through\r\ntheir barbed wire entanglements and kept those who survived in a state\r\nof great nervous tension, because they knew a great charge was to\r\nfollow. Our guns were also trained on such objects as headquarters,\r\nrailroads, heavy artillery emplacements, cross roads, ammunition\r\ndumps, aviation hangars, etc., from information that had previously\r\nbeen obtained by the Flash and Sound Ranging sections. The heavy\r\nartillery did great damage far in the rear. The medium artillery, not\r\nhaving the range of the heavy guns, did not reach so far back with its\r\nfire, but demoralized things generally wherever its shells hit. It\r\nalso had for its purpose the breaking up of any attack that might be\r\nplanned as a counter offensive. The light artillery is of smaller\r\ncaliber and fires more rapidly. This did wonderful execution and was a\r\ngreat help in winning the war.\r\n\r\nIt was exactly 6 o'clock when the demoralizing barrage stopped, and it\r\nwas followed by a protecting barrage. There is quite a difference\r\nbetween a demoralizing barrage and a protecting barrage. A\r\ndemoralizing barrage is just what its name signifies, a demoralizing\r\nrain of shells upon the enemy. A protecting barrage is for the purpose\r\nof protecting the infantry as it charges into the enemy's lines and it\r\nis raised slowly as the infantry advances so as to keep over the heads\r\nof the marching soldiers. As soon as the protecting barrage was fired\r\nin this drive, the first waves of infantry went over the top.\r\n\r\nMost people have a misconception of what going over the top is. The\r\nprevailing idea is that a great mass of troops rush over the top and\r\ninto the German trenches. What really occurs is this: The men climb\r\nout of the trenches at an ordinary pace in a thin line from six to ten\r\nfeet apart. This is followed in a few seconds by another thin line\r\nabout the same distance apart, and then another, and so on until there\r\nare thousands of men advancing over No Man's Land, but they are\r\nscattered over a large area. The object in scattering them is to\r\nreduce losses in case an enemy shell falls among them. I have seen a\r\nshell fall among men advancing this way without hitting any of them,\r\nand I have also seen several fall from a single shell. Another reason\r\nfor these thin waves is the fact that when advancing in this formation\r\nthe men offer a poorer target to the machine guns of the enemy, while\r\nin mass formation, a machine gun could mow down in a short time a\r\nwhole company.\r\n\r\nJust ahead of the waves of infantry in this drive, wiggled the tanks.\r\nThese cumbersome, awkward, ugly but efficient machines were of great\r\nhelp to the foot soldiers. They not only made a path through the\r\nbarbed wire entanglements that the artillery had not destroyed, but\r\nthey hunted out and destroyed German machine gun nests, which were so\r\ndangerous to the infantry. The tanks had a very difficult task and\r\nthey performed it well. Too much credit cannot be given to the tank\r\ncrews. They were brave, skillful and good fighters. It is true they\r\nwere in a measure protected behind the steel walls of the machine,\r\nbut, on the other hand, they were exposed to heavy fire, it was hot\r\nand disagreeable within and in case of being struck by a shell or\r\nrunning onto a mine, the horrors were worse than those to which other\r\nfighters were exposed. The greatest danger was that of being trapped\r\nwithin and burned to death in case a shell hits the gasoline tank; a\r\nnumber were destroyed in that manner. So I give full credit to the\r\ntank men for their heroic services--they braced the greatest dangers\r\nwithout knowing such a word as \"fear.\"\r\n\r\nAs our boys went over the top they were given the protection of an\r\naerial squadron. Only those who were advancing toward the Hun lines on\r\nthat day, with full realization of their duties and their dangers,\r\nknow what a feeling of protection these hovering planes gave us. They\r\nflew low, frequently just over the heads of the men, and poured their\r\ndeadly machine gun fire into such of the Hun trenches as the artillery\r\nhad not destroyed--and, no matter how thoroughly the artillery does\r\nits work, there is always plenty left for the other branches of the\r\narmy to do. These daring airmen also dropped fishtail bombs on the\r\nHuns. These men were the bravest of the brave. They had the courage,\r\ngrit and combative qualities of the lion. They are constantly in great\r\ndanger. They are fired upon from below by enemy anti-aircraft guns,\r\nand frequently from above by enemy planes. They are also exposed, when\r\nthey fly low, to rifle fire and machine guns and machines are\r\nfrequently brought down by such fire. During a drive of this kind they\r\nalso face the danger of running into their own barrage and are\r\nrestricted as to the area in which they may manoeuver. We cannot give\r\nthese fearless men of the flying corps too much praise for their work.\r\nWhile men in all branches of the American army were brave and all did\r\ntheir duty, I think the airmen, like the tank men, deserve a special\r\nmeed of praise for their daring, and when I say this, I intend in no\r\nway to detract from the bravery of the men in any other branch of the\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThe Flash Service, to which I belonged, was not a fighting unit. While\r\nwe were heavily armed, so that we could defend ourselves and fight if\r\nnecessary, we were not, in the strict sense of the word, combatants.\r\nIt was more important for us to keep the lines of communication in\r\nworking order, to give the artillery the range on certain objects, to\r\nlocate machine gun nests and direct fire upon them so they could be\r\ndestroyed, than to fight, for there were sufficient numbers in other\r\nbranches of the army for that purpose. But we did not overlook an\r\nopportunity to help our cause, and it is with a great deal of pleasure\r\nthat I tell of a machine gun nest of thirteen men captured by three of\r\nthe men of our detachment, though of a different post from mine. It\r\nwas during the early morning of the first day of the drive. It should\r\nbe stated that the American infantry advanced so rapidly that it\r\nfrequently went right by carefully concealed machine gun nests. This\r\nwas just what the Germans wanted them to do, because they opened fire\r\nfrom the rear and rained bullets on our men from two sides. The three\r\nmen that captured the nest of which I am telling were just in back of\r\nthe second wave of infantry that went over the top, following it up\r\nfor the purpose of establishing our line of communication from front\r\nto rear. They came upon this nest as the Huns were preparing to fire\r\nat our advancing men. When they first located the nest the Americans\r\nhad their revolvers carefully wrapped in greased coils and in their\r\nholsters, not expecting to use them--the greased coils being to keep\r\nthe weapons from rusting from the dampness of the trenches. These\r\nresourceful American boys lost no time, however, in getting their\r\nweapons ready for use, and by a quick and intrepid manoeuver, they\r\napproached the Huns, covered them with their revolvers, and compelled\r\nthem to surrender without so much as firing a shot. The Huns were\r\ntaken to the rear, and their gun, a Vicker, became a trophy of war.\r\n\r\nIt was about 9 o'clock in the morning while we were advancing that I\r\ncame upon a petite French tank, which had run upon a Hun mine and had\r\nbeen completely destroyed. The machine was reduced to a pile of junk,\r\nand it was hardly believable that a mine would work such destruction.\r\nThe heavy iron was torn in shreds, and while we knew it was a tank and\r\nwe knew what had happened to it, it was now nothing but scrap iron.\r\n\r\nJust about that time the infantry was capturing thousands of Hun\r\nprisoners--men who had occupied the front German trenches and who were\r\novercome by our boys. As I was advancing, I saw 3,700 German prisoners\r\nmarching to the rear, and as it was still early in the day, you may\r\nknow with what thoroughness our boys were doing their work. Among\r\nthese prisoners was a German officer who knew the location of the\r\nmines that had been planted to destroy tanks, bridges, roads, etc. The\r\nAmericans were not long in learning this and they compelled him to\r\npoint out these locations. Under his guidance, 52 mines were\r\ndestroyed. These might have done great damage to American tanks and\r\nsoldiers if they had not been set off. As it was, they opened a\r\npathway through which our tanks passed without danger.\r\n\r\nAs we went forward into the territory that had been held by the Huns,\r\nwe could see the results of our own work, that is to say, we could see\r\nobjects upon which we had given the range to the artillery, completely\r\ndestroyed. It was gratifying to note that our work and the work of the\r\nartillery had been so accurate. Objects, such as headquarters,\r\nrailroad tracks, cross roads, that we had located through our strong\r\nglasses before the drive, and upon which we had given the distance to\r\nthe gunners, had been shattered by direct hits, speaking wonders for\r\nthe marksmanship of the American gunners. At some places we saw scores\r\nof men and animals that had been killed by shell fire; at others we\r\nsaw trenches that had been as completely wiped out as though they\r\nnever existed; we also saw ammunition dumps that had been hit and set\r\nafire and which burned steadily for several days. These were\r\nexceedingly dangerous places, and we kept a good distance from them\r\nuntil they burned completely out, as the exploding shells threw flying\r\nmetal for a distance of a hundred yards or more. We also came across\r\nrailroad trains that had been hit as they were proceeding, and so\r\nbadly crippled that they had to be abandoned by the enemy, later to be\r\ncaptured by us.\r\n\r\nWe advanced about ten kilometers the first day, and then our men were\r\ndirected to dig in. Here we met with our first real resistance. The\r\nenemy counter attacked during the night, but his charges were finally\r\nbroken up by our accurate fire.\r\n\r\nOur advance that day had been rapid and had penetrated deeply into the\r\nenemy line. This had been possible because of the rapidity with which\r\nour supplies had been brought up. The roads for the most part were not\r\nbadly cut up, and those that were damaged were quickly repaired by our\r\nengineers. Bridges had been hastily built, obstructions removed from\r\nhighways, and shell holes filled in so that traffic could go on almost\r\nuninterruptedly. This made it possible for all necessary munitions to\r\nmove forward.\r\n\r\nOne thing that was annoying to our advance was the German \"pill boxes\"\r\nin which machine gunners were placed. These pill boxes were of\r\nconcrete. They were round and flat, a few square, and took their name\r\nbecause of their resemblance to a pill box. They had slits about six\r\ninches wide and eighteen inches long in the concrete through which the\r\nHuns fired their machine guns at our troops. Our most effective weapon\r\nagainst these pill boxes was our one pounders. They fired a small\r\nshell directly at the box and continued to fire until they got the\r\nrange of the slit. The shells would then penetrate the slit and hit\r\nthe other side of the box, exploding when they did so, and killing or\r\nwounding the occupants. Once the range was obtained, our gunners kept\r\npouring in these shells until there was no longer any fear that the\r\nFritz soldiers in that box would harm any more Americans. Our boys put\r\nmany of these pill boxes out of commission with big loss to the enemy.\r\nThey made duty in a pill box certain death for the Huns when any\r\nAmericans were around.\r\n\r\nWe spent a rather restless night after our first day's advance. Though\r\nwe had marched many miles and were mentally and physically fatigued,\r\nit was not easy to sleep. We were in constant danger of counter attack\r\nand of being shelled by the enemy, and the sensation was not pleasant.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of September 13th, the second day of the drive,\r\nwe advanced again in the gray of the early dawn. It was between 8 and\r\n9 o'clock on this morning that I saw a great aerial fight in which\r\nprobably thirty-five and perhaps forty machines participated. We had\r\nadvanced so far the first day that the Germans sent their aircraft out\r\nin numbers on the second day to look at the territory that had been\r\nlost. Our men were ready for them. It was the most thrilling sight I\r\never witnessed, and I cannot imagine anything more sensational. At\r\nfirst these machines were very high in the air, perhaps ten thousand\r\nfeet, for they were mere specks in the sky to the natural vision. It\r\nwas wonderful to see them manoeuvering for positions of advantage.\r\nThey twisted, turned, looped and dove. At times two or three would be\r\nvery close together and then again they would separate. Little white\r\npuffs of smoke told the tale that the machine guns were in action.\r\nThey reminded me of bees swarming, as they buzzed and circled around\r\neach other in the air. As they fought they descended, coming nearer to\r\nearth and thus plainer to our vision. Suddenly one dropped out of the\r\nranks, a struck machine. We knew it was permanently out of commission\r\nthe minute it started to fall, for it dropped like a dead bird. It was\r\na Hun machine and it dropped close to where I was located, so close in\r\nfact that within a few minutes I was inspecting it and taking small\r\nsouvenirs to send home from its collapsed wings. Then another dropped,\r\nbut it fell far from where we were located and its descent was so\r\nswift that we could not see its insignia and were unable to tell\r\nwhether or not it was a Hun machine. Then one came down wounded, but\r\nstill able to fly. It was an American machine, for it sought refuge in\r\nback of our lines. And so the fight continued for a few minutes--it\r\ndid not last long--until a total of eight machines dropped and several\r\nothers flew away wounded. Just what percentage of Hun and Allied\r\nplanes fell, I was never able to ascertain, but the best evidence that\r\nthe majority of them were Hun machines was the fact that the remaining\r\nenemy planes soon departed from the aerial battle field, leaving the\r\nAllied planes in complete control. The Allied fleet of planes in this\r\nfight was composed mostly of Americans, though our airmen were aided\r\nby a couple of British and a couple of French machines.\r\n\r\nWe continued our advance throughout the second day, though we did not\r\nproceed as rapidly as on the first day. This was because the roads\r\nwere in poorer condition and supplies could not be so rapidly moved\r\nforward and for the further reason that the country was more wooded\r\nand offered Fritz a better opportunity for defense. Our boys were\r\ncounter-attacked on several occasions, but each time they sent the\r\nHuns flying to the rear with heavy losses. In hand to hand fighting,\r\nsuch as often resulted when counter attacks were lodged, the Germans\r\nwere no match for the Americans, who seemed to excel in close work\r\nwhich required bravery, skill and dash. In fact, it was in this kind\r\nof work that our boys showed Fritz what we mean in America by \"punch.\"\r\n\r\nOn the third day we advanced as far as Thiacourt, which was our\r\nobjective. On this day we also met with stubborn resistance. It was\r\nhere that we encountered many pill boxes and it required considerable\r\ndifficult and accurate work to put them out of business.\r\n\r\nIt was on the night of September 15th that we saw our hardest\r\nfighting, and were given a taste of how hard Germans could fight when\r\npressed. It was on this night that our losses were the heaviest of the\r\ndrive.\r\n\r\nMy post was dug in on a ridge that was occupied by a detachment of\r\nincomparable fighters--the Marines. The ridge was only about 500 yards\r\nin length. The roads being in bad condition, we were unable to get the\r\nprotection of any artillery. All that we had to keep Fritz at bay on\r\nthis ridge was about forty machine guns, which were no match for the\r\nheavy shells that the Huns were pouring on us, having our range to a\r\nnicety. We were in what is known as \"graves,\" or shallow trenches, not\r\nhaving had time to dig deep trenches or to strengthen our positions as\r\nwe were constantly under fire. But these Marines laid down a machine\r\ngun barrage, the first that I had ever seen. They kept up the fire all\r\nnight and thus held Fritz away. It was a tense period. Hun shells were\r\ndropping all around us and frequently right among us, but the machine\r\nguns never ceased their excellent defensive work. When day broke, and\r\nthe Hun ceased firing, only seventeen of these machine guns and their\r\ncrews were in condition to fight. Twenty-three of them had been\r\ndestroyed by the German artillery. It was a sad sight that met our\r\neyes the morning when we saw the losses that we had suffered during\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nIt was on the night of the fourth day of the drive that fresh men were\r\nbrought up, and those of us who had been out in front during the drive\r\nwere relieved. It was, indeed, a great relief. It permitted us to\r\nrelax our bodies and minds after four days of steady strain, with no\r\nmore food than was sufficient to sustain us and without rest during\r\nthe entire time. We were grateful to be away for a short time from the\r\ndevastating fire that the Huns were pouring into our front line\r\ntrenches in an endeavor to check a further penetration into their\r\nlines, but we were still under shell fire.\r\n\r\nWe were taken a short distance to the rear, where we were billeted in\r\nGerman dugouts. The day before these had been occupied by German\r\nofficers. They were elaborately fitted up with all things necessary\r\nfor luxury and comfort, such as beds, bathtubs, electric lights, etc.\r\n\r\nIt was here, seemingly as a reward for my small services in the great\r\nfight, that I met my friend and companion, McKinley Johnston, of\r\nSacramento. Nothing could have pleased me more for McKinley Johnston\r\nis like a brother to me, having been my companion since boyhood. It\r\nwas with him that I had talked of enlisting long before I volunteered,\r\nand it was he who enlisted with me. Though we became soldiers together\r\nand entered the same company, the fortunes of war separated us in\r\nFrance, and united us at a moment that was most gratifying to us both.\r\nWe sat down together and related our experiences. He was driving a\r\ntruck, and from him I learned of remarkable escapes that he had had\r\nfrom death during the four days of the drive. On one occasion a Hun\r\nshell, sufficient in size to have blown him to atoms, lodged in his\r\ntruck among supplies and failed to explode. I saw the shell myself,\r\nalso saw the hole in the top of the truck through which it passed and\r\ncan vouch for the truthfulness of the story. On another occasion a\r\nshrapnel shell exploded on the road just to the right of his truck.\r\nWhen it burst, it sent small pieces of metal flying in all directions.\r\nAbout twenty-five or thirty of these passed through his truck, but not\r\none struck him. I saw the holes they made. The motor of the truck was\r\nnot as fortunate as the driver. A number of the pieces passed through\r\nthe hood and lodged in the engine. It was damaged considerably, but it\r\nstill ran and McKinley was able to complete his trip. I marveled at\r\nthese stories because they concerned a young man of whom I am very\r\nfond, but escapes of this kind were numerous in these days and almost\r\nevery soldier who passed through the drive can truthfully tell of\r\nsimilar escapes. We were facing death all the time and the remarkable\r\nthing is that so many of us did pass through the drive and come out\r\nalive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nGassed\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the happiest days that I experienced during the period that I\r\nwas at war was on Friday, September 20, 1918. On this day, after\r\nhaving made several visits to our new posts in the front line, I came\r\nback to our billet, where, to my delight and surprise, I found eight\r\nletters from home awaiting me. No one knows the joy that a letter from\r\nhome gives to a soldier on the firing line. It is like taking him out\r\nof hell and placing him back on earth again. For several days we had\r\nbeen in the very thickest of the fight, facing death at every minute,\r\nseeing our companions fall around us, doing everything we possibly\r\ncould to help our side win, and willing to go back and do it all over\r\nagain without complaint--and then to get these welcome letters from\r\ndear ones 9,000 miles away right in the midst of it all. Is it any\r\nwonder that on such occasions we frequently gave way to our emotions?\r\n\r\nThe letters that I received were enjoyed not only by me, but by my\r\ncompanion, McKinley Johnston, as well, as he knew all of my people and\r\nwas as familiar as I was with the things that they wrote about. It is\r\na peculiar circumstance, but it is a fact, nevertheless, that all of\r\nthe boys, even those who did not know my folks and who came from other\r\nStates than California, were interested in these letters. They were\r\nnews from home and that is what all the boys were craving. They wanted\r\nto read anything that came from America. So, after reading the\r\nletters, I passed them all around and every boy in the camp read them.\r\nAfter getting the letters back, I read them over several times.\r\nSeveral of them contained photographs of familiar scenes and faces,\r\nand it seemed good to look upon them again, for no one knew but that\r\nit might be the last time we would see them. I thought it would be a\r\nnice thing to sit right down and write, after reading these letters,\r\nbut when I attempted it, I was so overcome with emotion caused by\r\nthoughts of those who were near and dear to me, that I was unable to\r\ngive expression to my thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe position of the American troops at this time was not favorable.\r\nThe enemy held the commanding ground, and was concealed in woods,\r\nwhile our troops were out in the open. The Boche could see what we\r\nwere doing while we were unable to detect his moves. This\r\ndisadvantage, you might well know, would not long be tolerated by\r\nAmericans. We wanted the commanding ground and we wanted to put Fritz\r\nin the open. So on Monday, September 23rd, we gave Fritz a three-hour\r\nbarrage and it was a hot one. By the time the barrage started, all our\r\nlight artillery had been brought up and put in place, and we were able\r\nto rain shells from the famous 75's upon the enemy in torrents. This\r\nbarrage was for the purpose of breaking up the morale of the Germans.\r\nWe were counter-barraged by the Huns, and for a time they made it hot\r\nfor us. But our superiority began to show after about an hour's\r\nfiring. The men in the Flash Division worked hard to give our gunners\r\nthe correct location of the German batteries. We worked hard and fast\r\nand the accuracy of our effort was shown by the silencing of the\r\nGerman guns. One by one they ceased firing, as the American artillery,\r\nwith the data we supplied them, dropped shells on the Hun batteries.\r\n\r\nIt was just about 5:45 in the morning when our artillery ceased firing\r\nand our boys advanced again. This time our objectives were only about\r\ntwo kilometers in back of the German front trenches. We met with\r\nstubborn resistance at first, but with the usual American\r\ndetermination and pluck, we soon forced the Boche back.\r\n\r\nIt was here that I first saw the German minnewafers and trench mortars\r\nat work. The shells thrown from the minnewafers are as much feared as\r\nany German weapon of war. They are thrown from a large gun with a\r\nsmooth bore and short barrel. The projectile is shaped like a rolling\r\npin, though it is much larger. In each end, or handle of the shell, is\r\na cap, which explodes as the handle strikes the ground. As the\r\nprojectile somersaults as it travels, one handle or the other is sure\r\nto hit the earth, so there are no \"duds\" that I saw among these\r\nshells. They explode with a terrific racket and tear up the earth for\r\na great distance around the spot where they land. They are not thrown\r\nvery high in the air, and are intended for use in close fighting, that\r\nis to say, two or three hundred yards. As the shells whirl through the\r\nair, you can plainly hear them whistling, and if you look sharply you\r\ncan occasionally see them coming. These minnewafers and mortars are of\r\nvarious ranges--from three and four inches up to twelve and fourteen\r\ninches. Aside from these trench guns, the Germans in this fight also\r\nresisted heavily with machine gun nests and one pounders.\r\n\r\nIn going over the top this time, we did not have the protection that\r\nwe did when the St. Mihiel drive started. In other words, we did not\r\nhave any tanks or any aerial protection, but had to advance with only\r\nsuch help as the artillery could give us.\r\n\r\nThe Germans were well protected and it took clever work to outwit\r\nthem. Their machine gun nests were always cleverly concealed. Many of\r\nthem were concealed in trees, and it was a common sight to see our\r\ninfantrymen advance unseen by the machine gunners, and then with their\r\nrifles, shoot them out of the trees. I had seen machine gun nests in\r\ntrees before, but never so many as this time. Not only were they\r\nnumerous, but they were so well provided with ammunition that they\r\ncould fire thousands of rounds of shells, if necessary. I have seen\r\nlong belts of cartridges hanging to limbs of trees, all ready for use\r\non the part of the gunners. I have also seen many of these belts\r\nattached together so as to provide an almost endless chain of\r\ncartridges for the gun. Under one tree where there had been a nest, I\r\nsaw empty cartridge shells eight inches deep, which was some shooting\r\nfor a short fight such as this was. That machine gun had certainly\r\ndone all that could be expected of it.\r\n\r\nWe gained our objectives at 4 o'clock of the afternoon of the day the\r\ndrive started. We were then in the best possible position, so far as\r\nground is concerned, as it was possible for us to occupy. We had taken\r\nthe commanding ground from Fritz, and we began digging in so as to be\r\nready for a counter attack. All during that night we dug our trenches,\r\nmaking them deep and as safe as possible. Between 3 and 5 o'clock the\r\nnext morning, the expected attack came. We experienced a heavy\r\nshelling from the German artillery. Of course, our light artillery\r\nthat had been hastily brought up was not slow in returning the fire.\r\nOur barrage was very accurate and eventually the Huns were silenced.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that I was called upon to witness the greatest\r\nhorror of war--that of seeing some of my dearest friends fall from the\r\nenemy's fire before my very eyes. I was working in a post with three\r\nother men. We had been constantly together since the drive began and\r\nour hardships that we had undergone resulted in a bond of friendship\r\nthat held us together like brothers. All three of these men were\r\nkilled during this barrage. Two of them were instantly killed and the\r\nthird lived but a short time after being hit, dying about 6 o'clock in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\nWhen you consider that we were working in a post that was not more\r\nthan twelve feet in diameter, you may well imagine my feelings as I\r\nsaw these boys fall. I fully expected that my turn would come at any\r\nminute, but I kept at work so as to keep my mind off the gruesome\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nThe next twenty-four hours were about the worst that I experienced\r\nthroughout the war. My post was right out in front, and I was the only\r\nman left in it. Our communication lines had been badly cut up by\r\nGerman shells, and I was unable to make a report of the disaster that\r\nour post had suffered to headquarters. I could not leave the post,\r\nbecause I could not leave the instruments. They were too valuable to\r\nbe left there with no one guarding them, and it would not do to leave\r\nany chance of their falling into the hands of the enemy. So I remained\r\nat the post all day. About 7 o'clock in the evening, men from\r\nheadquarters fixed the communicating lines and I made my report of the\r\nloss of three men. Help was immediately dispatched to me, but,\r\nbecause we were heavily shelled again that night by the Huns, it was\r\nimpossible for aid to reach me. It was not until 4 o'clock the next\r\nmorning that a detachment reached the post and I was relieved.\r\n\r\nA detachment was also sent from headquarters for the purpose of\r\nremoving the bodies of my three dead companions. They were taken back\r\nof the lines to a beautiful spot in the woods, and there they were\r\nburied. Because of the fondness of the men of our detachment for these\r\nand for the further reason that fighting had slackened up some, we\r\nwere able to give these men a little better burial than is accorded\r\nmost soldiers who fall on the field of battle. In most cases a grave\r\nis dug, the body wrapped in a blanket and deposited without a casket\r\nand without ceremony. But for these boys, some of the men in our\r\ndetachment made boxes to serve as coffins out of material that we had\r\ncaptured from an engineering dump. One big grave was dug and the\r\nbodies were laid in it side by side. One of the boys said a prayer and\r\nthe graves of these brave lads, way out there in the woods in France,\r\nwere covered over. This is one of the incidents of the war that will\r\nnever leave my mind, as two of the boys were among my dearest friends.\r\n\r\nI realize that my escape from death while at that post was by a narrow\r\nmargin. It seemed to be the beginning of a number of miraculous\r\nescapes, such as many soldiers experience. Mine came in such rapid\r\nsuccession that I began to have a feeling that Fritz would get me yet.\r\nAbout 11 o'clock at night on the 30th of September I was aroused from\r\nmy bed in a dugout to repair the communication lines, it being part of\r\nthe duty of our detachment to keep the lines in working order when not\r\nobserving. It wasn't very pleasant, of course, to get out of bed in\r\nthe middle of the night, but this was the luckiest call that I had\r\never had. I had not been out more than five minutes when Fritz scored\r\na direct hit with a big shell upon that billet, destroying everything\r\nit in. If I had not been called out, I would have been killed.\r\nFortunately for our post, all the other members were on duty at the\r\ntime, so we all escaped. But while I escaped with my life, the shell\r\ndestroyed all of my personal belongings. This resulted in my\r\ndiscomfiture for many days, as I will relate. I had previously\r\ncaptured a pair of German officer's boots, which I would put on when\r\ncalled out at night, rather than my regulation army shoes and leggins.\r\nOn this night I slipped on these boots, and my army shoes were torn to\r\nshreds. Therefore, I was compelled to wear the German boots, and they\r\nwere the most uncomfortable things that I had ever had on my feet.\r\nThough they were my size, I could not get used to them, and they\r\nburned and blistered my heels so that I could hardly walk. As we were\r\nway out in front, it was not easy to get new shoes from headquarters.\r\nMy foot troubles became so serious that my officer granted me a day\r\noff duty for the purpose of trying to find a pair of shoes that would\r\nfit me. I spent the entire time in a fruitless search. I found several\r\npairs of shoes that belonged to boys who had been killed, but they\r\nwould not fit me, so finally I had to give it up. I wore those Boche\r\nboots sixteen days, and I had to keep going all the time with sore and\r\nblistered feet. I suffered more from those German boots than from\r\nanything else in the war.\r\n\r\nOn October 4th I had another interesting experience and narrow escape,\r\nwhich was as close as any that I ever want to experience. I was one of\r\na detail that was sent after water. We had to go from our dugouts a\r\ndistance of about two kilometers. On our way there we were walking in\r\na gully. Fritz had probably used that gully for the same purpose\r\nhimself when he held that ground, and he probably knew that we would\r\nbe using it too. At any rate, he had the range to a nicety. On our way\r\nhe first dropped a number of gas shells around us. We hastily put on\r\nour masks and escaped injury. But the gas shells were followed by a\r\nfew high explosives. A flying fragment severed the air tube of my gas\r\nmask. This meant immediate death, unless there was quick action. I had\r\nthe presence of mind to take hold of the tube, so as to prevent any\r\ngas from entering my lungs, and then I ran to high ground. The reason\r\nI sought high ground is because the chlorine gas is heavy and settles\r\nin low places and is not likely to be as thick if high ground can be\r\nreached. I was accompanied by one of the buddies, who saw my plight\r\nand ran to assist me. By a stroke of luck that seems almost\r\nunbelievable, we ran across a salvage dump on the ridge to which we\r\nran, and there we found a good gas mask, which I hurriedly slipped on,\r\nand used until a new one was issued to me. As if to add insult to\r\ninjury, while I was having trouble with the mask, I was struck on the\r\nshoulder by a piece of shrapnel. The fragment, however, had about\r\nspent its force, and while I was knocked down by the force of the blow\r\nand suffered from a bruised shoulder for several days, the skin was\r\nnot broken and my injury did not reach the dignity of a wound.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded on and got our water, and on our way back we were shelled\r\nagain when we were in approximately the same place. This time one of\r\nthe men received a small scratch from a piece of flying shell. It just\r\nbroke the skin between the knee and the thigh, but was so small that\r\nit did not cause any inconvenience. Shortly after this, another bit of\r\nshrapnel hit my helmet and knocked it off my head. I gave the boys\r\ncause for a hearty laugh as I scrambled on all fours after my \"tin\r\nderby,\" and no doubt I cut an amusing figure. Fritz seemed to be\r\npicking on me all day, but I was glad that I got off so lightly after\r\nbeing exposed to so much danger.\r\n\r\nThere is no room for sentiment in the army. Birthdays usually don't\r\nmean much. It just happened, however, that I had a day off of post on\r\nOctober 6th, and, that being my birthday, the occasion was made doubly\r\npleasant. But the thing that made the day a perfect one for me was the\r\nfact that when I reached headquarters I found fourteen letters from\r\nhome. I have already told how happy I felt when I received eight\r\nletters--well, fourteen made me feel just twice that happy. They were\r\nfrom relatives and friends and no gift could have made my birthday\r\nmore pleasant.\r\n\r\nOctober 16th was another red letter day for me. On that date I had a\r\ndetail to pack in supplies, and I had the great fortune to find a new\r\npair of shoes, just my size. What a relief to get rid of those\r\nuncomfortable ill-fitting, detestable German boots. If there was one\r\nthing that made me hate Germans worse than anything else, it was those\r\nhorrid German boots. The boys said they were a hoodoo and that if I\r\ncontinued to wear them Fritz would get me sure. However that may be, I\r\ndid not cease to have close calls. The very next day I got a small\r\nsniff of chlorination gas. It happened while I was fixing\r\ncommunication lines. I did not get enough to hurt me, but it made me\r\ndeathly sick. I was unable to do much for a couple of days, and was\r\ntaken to headquarters, where I was assigned to the duty of fixing\r\ncommunication lines, which were constantly in danger of being broken.\r\nOn October 24th two of us were sent to repair a break, which we\r\nlocated at 5 o'clock in the morning. Dawn was just breaking and the\r\nplace where we found the break was in the woods. The Germans had\r\nduring the night thrown a lot of chlorine gas shells into this woods,\r\nso we donned our masks. The break in the line was a difficult one to\r\nrepair. We soon found that we could not do it with our gas masks\r\non--one or the other must take his mask off. We could not return\r\nwithout making the repair. To a soldier there is no such word as fail.\r\nIt is either do or die. The buddy who was with me was a married man\r\nwith a baby at home. I, being unmarried, could certainly not ask him\r\nto take off his mask, while I kept mine on. So I stripped mine off,\r\nmade the repair, and while doing so was gassed severely. With the aid\r\nof the buddy, I was able to reach our billet. There I was put on a\r\nstretcher and taken to a field dressing station. As the old saying\r\ngoes, it never rains but it pours; gassing was not the only trouble I\r\nwas destined to experience on that day. As I was being carried to\r\nheadquarters a shell exploded nearby and I was struck in the leg by a\r\npiece of shrapnel. It was a small but painful wound just below the\r\nleft knee. I tried to accept it with a smile, and I was really glad\r\nthat I was struck instead of one of the other men, as I was already\r\nout of the fight, while if one of them had been wounded, it would have\r\nbeen two out of commission instead of one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nHospital Experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter being gassed and wounded, I was taken immediately to a dressing\r\nstation, where the wound in my leg was carefully, but hurriedly\r\ndressed and my throat was swabbed with a preparation used in all\r\nhospitals to relieve the severe burning in the throat caused by gas.\r\nOf all the unpleasant experiences that I had at war, this throat\r\nswabbing was the worst. It seemed to me like the surgeon who performed\r\nthis act had found in my throat a bottomless pit, and as the swab went\r\nup and down my burning esophagus, I suffered great agony. Although I\r\nknew this treatment was necessary, if I was to recover speedily from\r\nthe gas burns, I could scarcely endure it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the wound in my leg was dressed and my throat doctored, I\r\nwas examined as to my physical condition by a Major, who labeled me\r\nwith a tag upon which was written, \"tuberculosis.\" This, of course,\r\nwas very annoying and caused me considerable worry. It was certainly\r\nnot a pleasant word for one to receive when lying in the condition\r\nthat I then was. But I afterwards learned, much to the relief of my\r\nmind, that this tag had been put on me by the Major as a warning to\r\nthe next surgeon into whose hands I should fall, against tuberculosis.\r\nIn other words, in my condition, it was necessary to take precautions\r\nagainst the white plague.\r\n\r\nI experienced great pains in my throat and lungs from the gas and\r\nseemed to be choking. My strength was entirely gone, and I was about\r\nas miserable as one could be. I could not utter a sound and any\r\nattempt to speak only increased my pain. I relate these facts about\r\nthe agony that I suffered simply to show what a terrible weapon of war\r\nthis deadly phosgene gas is, and to emphasize the villainy of the Hun\r\ngovernment in using it after having agreed with other nations years\r\nbefore not to do so.\r\n\r\nI was placed on a cot and made as comfortable as possible under the\r\ncircumstances and was awaiting a motor truck to take me to a base\r\nhospital. On all sides of me were other wounded and gassed boys. Some\r\nof them were exceedingly jolly and talkative, notwithstanding their\r\npitiable condition. I remember one boy in particular, who was about my\r\nown age. He was going over on a raid and was shot through the temple.\r\nThe bullet entered on one side an inch or two above the eye, and went\r\nstraight through, passing out the other side at about the same\r\ndistance above the eye. It passed through apparently, without striking\r\nthe brain, and the boy was fully conscious while the wound was\r\ndressed and seemed to be quite jolly. I watched the surgeon shave both\r\nsides of his head around the wound to prevent infection, and then\r\ncarefully dress his head, without administering any anesthetic. I\r\nmarveled at the boy's condition, with such a nasty wound, but what\r\nsurprised me still more was several months later when I was on board\r\nship on my way home, there was this same boy with his wound entirely\r\nhealed. Two little white scars, one on each temple, were the only\r\nmarks that told of his awful experience.\r\n\r\nFrom the dressing station I was taken to a field hospital, about\r\nfifteen kilometers to the rear, and there placed in a ward in a tent.\r\nThe purpose of the field hospital is to treat soldiers who are too\r\nseverely wounded to be taken to base hospitals. My wound was again\r\nexamined, cleaned and dressed and again the terrible swab went its\r\ndepth. About 4 o'clock that afternoon I was loaded into another\r\nstretcher on an ambulance and taken to Base Hospital 51 at Toul. The\r\ndistance from the field hospital to Toul was about twenty-five\r\nkilometers and we did not reach there until about 9 o'clock that\r\nnight. The trip was a rough one, and I suffered greatly. I positively\r\nbelieve my recovery would have been much faster, had I not been\r\ntransferred so hastily to this hospital. I was placed in a ward in a\r\nlarge hospital built of stone. In this hospital the wounded men were\r\nclassified in accordance with the nature of their wounds. I was not\r\nlong in this hospital when a nurse took charge of me, and again, I\r\nreceived that awful swab. Each time it seemed worse than before and\r\nhow I dreaded the time when it was to be given again! But much to my\r\nsurprise and pleasure, my treatment was changed at this hospital. My\r\nchest and throat were massaged by the nurse with an oil that brought\r\nme immediate relief. This nurse continued this treatment several times\r\na day and night and I began to feel a little better. All this time,\r\nhowever, I was unable to utter a word, and I began to wonder whether\r\nor not my speech was permanently injured. In my predicament, however,\r\nI soon learned the sign language. It is remarkable how well a man can\r\nmake himself understood merely by the use of his hands. I had no\r\ntrouble at all in making my wants known. I was in the base hospital at\r\nToul for fourteen days and all of that time I coughed up great chunks\r\nof solid matter and mouthfuls of blood, as the result of the burning\r\nthat I had received. After the seventh day, the nurse stopped the use\r\nof the swab, much to my delight, but continued the more appreciated\r\nmassage.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of my fifteenth day at this hospital, I was able to\r\nmake my wants known by a faint whisper, and on that day I was\r\ntransferred to another hospital. I was placed in a motor car and taken\r\nto the railroad station, about half a mile distant and there loaded on\r\nto a French hospital train, our destination being Tours. Before the\r\ntrain pulled out of the station, American Red Cross workers, always in\r\nevidence in every city in France, came and made us as comfortable as\r\npossible. They gave us coffee and doughnuts, hot chocolate and\r\ncigarettes, and their kindness was greatly appreciated by all the\r\nwounded on that train.\r\n\r\nAll the members of the crew of the train were French, and there was\r\nalso several French surgeons aboard. They all showed much interest in\r\nthe American troops. They asked us many questions about America and\r\nthe American people. The fighting qualities of our boys were highly\r\npraised by them. The members of the crew in particular were interested\r\nabout working conditions in America, and were anxious to know whether\r\nor not they would have any difficulty in getting work if they came to\r\nthis country. They showed plainly that they had been so favorably\r\nimpressed by Americans in France that they had a longing to become a\r\npart of this great nation.\r\n\r\nIt took us a day and a night to reach Tours. The journey was a\r\ntiresome one and we were glad when the train finally stopped at Tours.\r\nAgain we were put on motor ambulances and taken to Base Hospital 7, in\r\nthe suburbs of the city. We were immediately given a physical\r\nexamination, and all our personal effects, including our clothes, were\r\ntaken from us, except a few toilet articles. We were then given a bath\r\nrobe, a towel and soap and taken to a warm shower. It was with great\r\ndelight that we got under that shower and enjoyed a thorough bath. The\r\nshowers were of American make and were built large enough so that\r\ntwenty-five or thirty men could take a bath at a time. After the\r\nshower we were given a solution to rub on our bodies for the purpose\r\nof killing the cooties. The time had come, I am glad to say, when we\r\nand the cooties, must forever part. But the cootie in the front line\r\ntrenches was not altogether an enemy. That may sound strange, but the\r\nfact is, when we were fighting the cooties and chasing them out of our\r\ndug-outs, our minds were not on our more serious troubles and we were\r\nunmindful of the dangers that surrounded us. So there were times when\r\nthe cooties were really friends and they kept our minds and hands\r\noccupied.\r\n\r\nAfter the bath, we were taken back to the ward and were not allowed to\r\nhave any clothes for three days. This was probably so there would be\r\nno chance of a stray cootie getting into our new outfit. When three\r\ndays had elapsed, however, we were given slips, which we filled out in\r\naccordance with our needs. When I got back into a uniform, life at the\r\nhospital was more pleasant. With the aid of crutches I was able to\r\nmove around a little and to enjoy the company of other boys. The time\r\nwas spent in playing cards, light conversation, and other amusements.\r\nWe kept our minds off our rough experiences at the front.\r\n\r\nI had an unusually pleasant experience soon after I was at Tours. A\r\nRed Cross nurse came to our ward to take orders for our small wants,\r\nsuch as candy, cigarettes, tobacco, writing paper and such articles.\r\nShe spoke a few words to me and then passed on. It was the first time\r\nI had spoken to an American girl since leaving the United States. A\r\nfew minutes later one of the boys told me she was from the West and\r\nthen one said he thought she was from California. I could not wait\r\nuntil she came to bring our supplies, but immediately started out to\r\nlook her up, so anxious was I to see and talk with a Californian. I\r\nfound her and told her I was from California and that I had heard that\r\nshe was from that State, too. To my great pleasure and surprise, I\r\nlearned that she was from Sacramento, my home town, and that she was\r\nacquainted with my folks and knew of me. Her name is Miss Mae Forbes,\r\nand after her patriotic work in France, she is home again in\r\nSacramento. One must experience the delight of meeting a charming\r\nyoung woman from his own town, in far-off France, and under the\r\ncircumstances that I did, to appreciate my feelings at this time. It\r\nis an experience that I will always remember as one of the most happy\r\nof my life. It was only a few days later that I made my way, without\r\nthe aid of crutches this time, to the American Red Cross station where\r\nI again met Miss Forbes and had a long and pleasant chat with her\r\nabout California. Miss Forbes introduced me to the other members of\r\nthe station, and from that time until I left Tours, it was like my\r\nhome. I spent many a pleasant hour there and its memories will always\r\nbe dear to me.\r\n\r\nI was in the hospital at Tours on November 11th, when the armistice\r\nwas signed. There was a great commotion in my ward when we first\r\nlearned the news. Most of the boys were glad that the war was over and\r\nthat the lives of so many boys still at the front had been spared.\r\nOthers said they hoped the end had not come so suddenly, as they were\r\nanxious to recover and get back into the front line to take another\r\ncrack at the despicable Huns.\r\n\r\nAt this time I was gaining strength rapidly and was able to get around\r\nfairly well. I was given a pass out of the hospital, and with two\r\nother boys who were fairly strong, we went into the business district\r\nof Tours to witness the celebration. It was like a great city gone\r\nmad. The streets were crowded with civilians, and everybody was waving\r\nflags. Most people had a French flag in one hand, and the flag of one\r\nof the Allied nations in the other. The American flag predominated\r\nabove all other Allied flags; in fact, the people of Tours seemed to\r\nbe very partial to America. \"Vive l'Amerique\" they shouted, \"La guerre\r\nest fini.\" They are very emotional and demonstrative. They lined the\r\nsidewalks of the business streets, waving their flags and shouting in\r\ntheir native tongue, while an American Marine Band playing patriotic\r\nmusic, marched up one street and down another. It was a general\r\nholiday and no business was done that day, and but very little for\r\nseveral days thereafter. All American soldiers in the city were\r\nlionized. When a group of enthusiastic Frenchmen would get hold of a\r\nbuddy, they would insist on taking him to a cafe and buying the most\r\nexpensive of wines. If we could have conserved all the liquor the\r\nFrench were willing to buy for us that day, dry America would not\r\nworry us.\r\n\r\nI was seated on a bench in one of the parks watching the demonstration\r\nand contrasting it with the probable demonstrations in American cities\r\non that day, when two flags, one French and the other American,\r\ndropped over my shoulders. I straightened up and the next thing I knew\r\nI was strongly clasped in the arms of a beautiful young French girl,\r\nelegantly dressed and bewitchingly charming. She kissed me fervently\r\non each cheek. The sensation was pleasant, but it was rather\r\nembarrassing inasmuch as it was in full view of hundreds of people\r\nwho were celebrating. If the shades of evening had been falling, the\r\nspot more secluded and the number reduced to two, it would have been\r\nmore to my American tastes. However, I arose, conscious that I was\r\nblushing, and offered the beauty my hand. She could scarcely speak a\r\nword of English and I scarcely a word of French, but we managed to\r\nmake each other understand that it was a pleasurable greeting. She was\r\nsoon on her way joyfully waving her flags, and I--well, I charged\r\nmyself up with a lost opportunity for not being more proficient in the\r\npolite use of the French language.\r\n\r\nWe remained in the city until 9:30 that evening, and the people were\r\nstill celebrating. And they kept it up for several days and several\r\nnights, so great was their joy in knowing that the war was over and\r\nthat the enemy had been crushed.\r\n\r\nMy stay in Tours gave me some opportunity of seeing this ancient city.\r\nTours lies in the heart of the Loire Valley, which is the garden of\r\nFrance. It is 145 miles southwest of Paris by rail and is on the left\r\nbank of the Loire River. It is an exceedingly old city and has an\r\ninteresting history. There are numerous castles and chateaux in the\r\nvicinity, which in peace times are visited annually by thousands of\r\ntourists. It contains a number of ancient buildings of interest. In\r\nnormal times it is no doubt one of the most interesting cities in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe hospital in which I was treated was a very large one, in fact, it\r\nwas a great institution of many buildings. It contained forty-five\r\nwards of fifty cots each. It covered a large area and had every\r\ncomfort for the men, such as a motion picture house, library, reading\r\nroom, etc.\r\n\r\nAfter I had been there about five weeks and had regained much of my\r\nphysical strength, the authorities in charge began to classify the\r\nboys, either for further duty, or for shipment home. All were anxious\r\nto be put in class D, which meant the United States--God's country.\r\nNobody wanted class A, which meant further duty with the army of\r\noccupation, and another year at least in Europe. It seemed very much\r\nlike a lottery, as the boys who were able to do so, walked up and\r\nreceived their classification. I was exceedingly happy when I was\r\ngiven class D, which meant that nothing would stop me from seeing\r\n\"home and mother.\"\r\n\r\nAfter being classified, we were notified to make ourselves ready for a\r\ntrip to the coast. Although we were not told that we were going home,\r\nwe knew that the good old U. S. A. was our ultimate destination. So I\r\nreceived a pass and made my last visit to the business district of\r\nTours for the purpose of purchasing some souvenirs of France for the\r\nwomen folks at home. The men I had already remembered with rings, made\r\nduring my convalescing days at the hospital out of French two-franc\r\npieces. I might add that ring making was a favorite occupation of the\r\npatients and we spent many pleasant moments working them out sitting\r\non our cots, while a group of interested buddies would sit around and\r\nwatch and comment.\r\n\r\nI found it no easy matter to make my purchases. In the first place,\r\nthe French merchants, knowing that many of the American boys had money\r\nto spend, asked about four prices for everything, and, secondly, the\r\nFrench methods of doing business are quite different from our own. But\r\nby spending practically the entire day, by attempting Hebraic methods\r\nin purchasing, and by pretending that I had only a few francs to\r\nspend, I managed to spend about $25 in buying the few things that I\r\nwanted to bring home.\r\n\r\nI was then ready to leave, whenever Uncle Sam was willing to take me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nHome Again\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of December 11th a number of the boys at the hospital\r\nat Tours received orders to prepare for a trip to the coast. This was\r\nthe most welcome news that we could have heard and we hastily got our\r\npersonal belongings together. It was about 10 o'clock when we were\r\nplaced in ambulances and taken from the hospital. We were driven to\r\nthe railroad station about a mile distant, and there assigned to\r\nquarters in an American hospital train.\r\n\r\nThis was the first American train I had been on since I arrived in\r\nFrance, and it certainly was a great relief to me to know that we were\r\nnot to be crowded into one of those uncomfortable, stuffy and tiresome\r\nFrench trains. The American hospital train furnished an excellent\r\nexample of American efficiency, and when contrasted with the French\r\ntrains. I could not but think how much more progressive our people are\r\nthan Europeans. We had everything that we needed, and plenty of it. We\r\nenjoyed good beds, good food, and sufficient room to move around\r\nwithout encroaching upon the rights and the good natures of others. We\r\npulled out of Tours with no regrets on what was our most enjoyable\r\ntrain trip while in France. It was enjoyable for two reasons--first,\r\nwe were traveling in comfort and as an American is used to traveling,\r\nand secondly, we were traveling toward home.\r\n\r\nThe trip down the Loire Valley followed practically the same route\r\nthat we took on our way from Brest to Tours. The scenes, of course,\r\nwere very much the same, except that the country now wore its winter\r\ncoat, while it was mid-summer on my previous trip.\r\n\r\nWe arrived in Brest on December 13th, and to our surprise, we learned\r\nthat President Wilson had just previously landed there, and the city\r\nhad gone wild with enthusiasm over him. A tremendous crowd gathered\r\nat the station to greet him. Bands were playing and the occasion was a\r\ngala one. Our train stopped about a quarter of a mile away from the\r\nstation, where the President greeted a mass of French people and\r\nAmerican soldiers. I regret very much that I was unable to get a view\r\nof the President while he was at Brest; that was not my fortune. We\r\ndid, however, see his train pull out on its journey to Paris.\r\n\r\nSoon after we arrived at Brest we were told that we would be taken\r\nback on the \"George Washington,\" the liner upon which President Wilson\r\ncrossed the Atlantic, and great was our joy. However, we were soon\r\ndoomed to disappointment, for orders were changed, and we were taken\r\nto the Carry On Hospital, just out of Brest. The ride to the hospital\r\nwas a disagreeable one, as it had been raining and the streets were\r\nmuddy and wet. The ambulance rocked more like a boat than a motor car.\r\nWe were assigned quarters and given food. We met a number of boys in\r\nthe various wards who were awaiting their time of departure. We asked\r\nthem about how long it was after arriving at Brest before soldiers\r\nwere embarked for home, and they said the time varied all the way from\r\nthree to thirty days. That was not very encouraging and we were hoping\r\nthat in our case it would be three days. The very next morning,\r\nhowever, a number of our boys received orders to get ready to depart.\r\nI was not included among them, to my sorrow, and had no idea how long\r\nI might be kept at Brest. It was only a day or two later when we were\r\nmade happy by the news that our time to depart had come. It was joyful\r\nnews and made our hearts beat with the joy that only a returning\r\nsoldier knows.\r\n\r\nWe were loaded on the hospital ship \"La France,\" which is a beautiful,\r\nfour-funnel French liner, 796 feet in length. It was the third largest\r\nliner in use in transporting troops at that time. We took our places\r\non the boat about noon, but the big ship laid in the harbor all\r\nafternoon, and it was not until about sundown that she started to pull\r\nout and we bade \"good-bye\" to \"la belle France.\" One might think that\r\nthere was a lot of cheering when the boat pulled out on the eventful\r\nafternoon of December 17, 1918, but there was not. Some of the boys,\r\nit is true, cheered heartily. Most of us, however, were too full of\r\nemotion to become wildly demonstrative. Our thoughts were on home, the\r\nfolks that are dear to us, and our beloved native land, and our\r\nemotions were too strained for expression in cheers.\r\n\r\nThe vessel was manned by French, who treated us splendidly for the\r\nfirst two days out. After that, however, they began to skimp on our\r\nfood and to give us things of poor quality. For instance, we were\r\ngiven coffee without sugar or milk, cereals of poor quality without\r\neven salt in them, and no fruit, though it was understood that fruit\r\nwas to be a part of our diet. The boys complained bitterly at this\r\ntreatment, and finally our officers, knowing that we were not being\r\nproperly fed, made an examination of the ship. They found several\r\nhundred boxes of apples that were supposed to be for us, stowed away\r\nin the hold. It had been the intention of the French in charge of this\r\nboat to steal that fruit, evidently to sell it, at the expense of the\r\nwounded American soldiers on this hospital ship, who had fought and\r\nsaved their country from the Hunnish hordes. We had been cheated and\r\novercharged for everything we purchased in France, and we knew it, but\r\nit surely did hurt when we were thus treated by men whose homes we had\r\nsaved at the cost of our blood. I will say this: We did not hold this\r\nkind of treatment against the French people as a whole, but to\r\nindividuals who are so unprincipled and so greedy that they are\r\nwilling to sacrifice the fair name of their people for a paltry gain.\r\nI might add here that it was the smallness of some of the individual\r\n\"Y\" workers that brought the Y. M. C. A. into such disrepute among\r\nthe American soldiers in France. This simply shows how important it is\r\nfor an individual to sustain the reputation of his country, or his\r\nassociation, as the case may be, by honorable conduct.\r\n\r\nAfter our officers uncached the horde of stolen apples in the ship's\r\nhold, we were well fed and on the last two days of the journey had no\r\ncomplaint to make on this score.\r\n\r\nOn December 24th at 10 a.m. some far sighted individual shouted \"Land\"\r\nand what a welcome word it was. Columbus, watching from the deck of\r\nthe Santa Maria, was not more happy when he first set eyes upon the\r\nfaint outline of the new world than we were as the dim blue shoreline\r\nbegan to rise upon the horizon. There was a mad rush to the deck and\r\neverybody who could get out was soon watching over the rail. It was\r\nnot long before the Statue of Liberty came into full view and there\r\nwas joy in our hearts for we knew that at last we were home.\r\n\r\nIn a very few minutes our ship stopped and a pilot was taken aboard to\r\nguide the great vessel safely into the harbor. Next we were greeted by\r\na yacht that steamed out beside us carrying a great sign, \"Welcome\r\nHome.\" It was the 24th of December, and this boat carried a large\r\nChristmas tree, typical of the season.\r\n\r\nAs we entered the harbor, we were given a wonderful welcome. It seemed\r\nas though every whistle in the great city of New York had been brought\r\ninto action to make noise on our account. Certainly every boat in the\r\nharbor from the smallest tug to the trans-Atlantic liners was blowing\r\na blast; and the noise, though of an entirely different character, was\r\nas deafening as that of a battle. Every window of all the great\r\nbuildings that make up that wonderful skyline of New York was filled\r\nwith patriotic citizens waving a welcome to us. It was a great sight\r\nand one that the boys will never forget. It seemed so good to see our\r\nown people again--our pretty girls, our fond fathers, our dear\r\nmothers, our elderly folks, and even our street gamins. It gave us a\r\nfeeling that we would like to take them all in our arms, for they were\r\nours and we were theirs. I knew, of course, that there would be none\r\nof my folks to meet me, as my home is in California, but it did me\r\ngood to see the other boys meet and greet their mothers, fathers,\r\nsisters and sweethearts.\r\n\r\nWe started disembarking at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. I was on the\r\ntop deck and did not get off until 9 o'clock, being among the last to\r\nleave the ship. We were taken on a ferry to Jersey City, where we were\r\nentertained and given food. Later in the evening we were taken to Camp\r\nMerritt, New Jersey, by train. It did seem good to ride on a real\r\nAmerican train, on American soil, and among our countrymen. We arrived\r\nat Camp Merritt at 11 o'clock at night and I was taken to the\r\nhospital. I was assigned to a ward and after getting comfortably fixed\r\nwas given a real American meal, and you may be sure that it was\r\nthoroughly enjoyable. We had to stay in the barracks the next day to\r\nundergo a physical examination and for the further purpose of taking\r\nprecautions against the persistent cooties--some of the boys having\r\nencountered them on the boat.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of Christmas was everywhere manifest, and certainly I could\r\nhave had no Christmas present better than to arrive in America on\r\nChristmas eve. The Red Cross brought us boxes of good things to eat\r\nand Christmas presents, and the people entertained us wonderfully.\r\nThey took us on automobile rides in their private cars, to dinners, to\r\ntheaters, etc. Their hospitality was of the real American sort and it\r\nwas deeply appreciated by the boys.\r\n\r\nAt the very first opportunity after reaching camp, I sent a telegram\r\nto my parents in Sacramento, telling them that I had arrived safely. I\r\nreceived an answer saying that all at home were well, that same day,\r\nand it was a welcome message. It was the first word I had heard from\r\nhome since I had been gassed and wounded in October. I had been\r\ntransferred from place to place so frequently that my mail never quite\r\ncaught up with me. It kept following me around, and I did not get all\r\nmy letters until some weeks after I arrived home.\r\n\r\nI was in Camp Merritt for a month and five days, and during that time\r\nI had an excellent opportunity of seeing New York. I made several\r\ntrips to the metropolis and enjoyed seeing the points of interest of\r\nthat great city.\r\n\r\nWhile at the camp I met Harry Nauman, a Sacramento boy, and greatly\r\nenjoyed the pleasure of his company. From my folks I heard that James\r\nBrenton, my room mate at college, was also there. I looked him up and\r\nwas fortunate in finding him. We spent three or four pleasant days\r\ntogether before we departed for California.\r\n\r\nOn the first day of February, I left the camp and was sent to the\r\nLetterman Hospital in San Francisco. The trip across the continent was\r\nuneventful, except for the last one hundred miles of the journey. At\r\nSacramento I again saw my folks after a year in the service and my\r\nfather and mother accompanied me to San Francisco, making the ride\r\nmost enjoyable as Dad related all the local happenings during the long\r\ntime that I was away. I spent several days in the Letterman Hospital\r\nand was then honorably discharged from the service.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to relate in a general way many of my experiences. I\r\nhave not told all. Some of the more gruesome occurrences I have left\r\nuntold, not believing that any good would come of their repetition.\r\n\r\nI can honestly say that I am glad that I went to war and that I fought\r\nfor my country. The experience was of untold value to me, as it gave\r\nme a broader and more serious view of life. Notwithstanding all the\r\nhorrors of war, if called upon again, I would willingly go. I am ready\r\nto serve my country any time it calls. We have a wonderful country\r\nand a wonderful people. I realize that now more than I did before we\r\nwent to war. My rather limited observations lead me to believe that we\r\nare far ahead of any European country. If Americans live for America,\r\nif they put country above self, if they obey the laws and become\r\nacquainted with all the wonders of their own land, this nation will\r\nmake even greater progress in the future than it has in the past. The\r\nwar brought out a wonderful spirit; let our spirit in times of peace\r\nbe just as patriotic.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n    | Typographical errors corrected in text:                   |\r\n    |                                                           |\r\n    | Page  2: dispicable replaced with despicable              |\r\n    | Page 16: manoevuers replaced with manoeuvers              |\r\n    | Page 16: Madamoiselle replaced with Mademoiselle          |\r\n    | Page 58: greusome replaced with gruesome                  |\r\n    |                                                           |\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *",
