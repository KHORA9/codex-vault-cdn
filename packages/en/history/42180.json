MS., EGERTON 2019, f. 142.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  PARISH PRIESTS AND THEIR PEOPLE\r\n  IN THE MIDDLE AGES IN ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BY THE REV. EDWARD L. CUTTS, D.D.,\r\n  AUTHOR OF “TURNING POINTS OF ENGLISH CHURCH HISTORY,”\r\n  “A DICTIONARY OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND,”\r\n  “A HANDY BOOK OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND,” ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PUBLISHED UNDER THE DIRECTION OE THE TRACT COMMITTEE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LONDON:\r\n  SOCIETY FOR PROMOTING CHRISTIAN KNOWLEDGE.\r\n  NORTHUMBERLAND AVENUE, W.C.\r\n  43, QUEEN VICTORIA STREET, E.C.\r\n  BRIGHTON: 129, NORTH STREET.\r\n  NEW YORK: E & J. B. YOUNG AND CO.\r\n  1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great mass of material has of late years been brought within reach of\r\nthe student, bearing upon the history of the religious life and customs of\r\nthe English people during the period from their conversion, in the sixth\r\nand seventh centuries, down to the Reformation of the Church of England in\r\nthe sixteenth century; but this material is still to be found only in\r\ngreat libraries, and is therefore hardly within reach of the general\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nThe following chapters contain the results of some study of the subject\r\namong the treasures of the library of the British Museum; much of those\r\nresults, it is believed, will be new, and all, it is hoped, useful, to the\r\nlarge number of general readers who happily, in these days, take an\r\nintelligent interest in English Church history.\r\n\r\nThe book might have been made shorter and lighter by giving fewer extracts\r\nfrom the original documents; but much of the history is new, and it\r\nseemed desirable to support it by sufficient evidence. The extracts have\r\nbeen, as far as possible, so chosen that each shall give some additional\r\nincidental touch to the filling up of the general picture.\r\n\r\nThe photographic reproductions of illuminations from MSS. of various\r\ndates, illustrating ecclesiastical ceremonies and clerical costumes, are\r\nenough in themselves to give a certain value to the book which contains\r\nand describes them.\r\n\r\nThe writer is bound to make grateful acknowledgment of his obligations to\r\nthe Bishop of Oxford, who, amidst his incessant occupations, was so kind\r\nto an old friend as to read through the rough proof of the book, pointing\r\nout some _corrigenda_, making some suggestions, and indicating some\r\nadditional sources of information; all which, while it leaves the book the\r\nbetter for what the bishop has done for it, does not make him responsible\r\nfor its remaining imperfections.\r\n\r\nThe writer has also to express his thanks to the Rev. Professor Skeat,\r\nProfessor of Anglo-Saxon at Cambridge, and to the Rev. Dr. Cunningham,\r\nformerly Professor of Economic Science, K.C.L., for their kind replies to\r\ninquiries on matters on which they are authorities; and to some others who\r\nkindly looked over portions of the book dealing with matters of which they\r\nhave special knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.

Begin with the two pictures introduced into the broad\r\n    ornamental border at the bottom of the page. On the left are a pope,\r\n    an emperor, a king, and queen; on the right Death, on a black horse,\r\n    hurling his dart at them.\r\n\r\n    Go on to the initial D of the Psalm _Dilexi quoniam exaudiet Dominus\r\n    vocem_: “I am well pleased that the Lord hath heard the voice of my\r\n    complaint.” It represents a canon in surplice and canon’s fur hood,\r\n    giving absolution to a penitent who has been confessing to him (note\r\n    the pattern of the hanging at the back of the canon’s seat). Next\r\n    consider the picture in the middle of the border on the right. It\r\n    represents the priest in surplice and stole, with his clerk in albe\r\n    kneeling behind him and making the responses, administering the last\r\n    Sacrament to the dying person lying on the bed. Next turn to the\r\n    picture in the left-hand top corner of a woman in mourning, with an\r\n    apron tied about her, arranging the grave-clothes about the corpse,\r\n    and about to envelope it in its shroud. In the opposite corner, three\r\n    clerks in surplice and cope stand at a lectern singing the Psalms for\r\n    the departed; the pall which covers the coffin may be indistinctly\r\n    made out, and the great candlesticks with lighted candles on each side\r\n    of it. All these scenes lead us up to the principal subject, which is\r\n    the burial. The scene is a graveyard (note the grave crosses)\r\n    surrounded by a cloister, entered by a gate tower; the gables,\r\n    chimneys, and towers of a town are seen over the cloister roof; note\r\n    the skulls over the cloister arches, as though the space between the\r\n    groining and the timber roof were used as a charnel house. The priest\r\n    is asperging the corpse with holy water as the rude sextons lower the\r\n    body into the grave. Note that it is not enclosed in a coffin--that\r\n    was not used until comparatively recent times. He is assisted by two\r\n    other priests, all three vested in surplices and black copes with a\r\n    red-and-gold border; the clerk holds the holy-water vessel. Three\r\n    mourners in black cloak and hood stand behind. The story is not yet\r\n    finished. Above is seen our Lord in an opening through a radiant cloud\r\n    which sheds its beams of light over the scene; the departed soul\r\n    [de--parted = separated from the body] is mounting towards its Lord\r\n    with an attitude and look of rapture; Michael the Archangel is driving\r\n    back with the spear of the cross the evil angel disappointed of his\r\n    prey. Lastly, study the beautiful border. Is it fanciful to think that\r\n    the artist intended the vase of flowers standing upon the green earth\r\n    as a symbol of resurrection, and the exquisite scrolls and twining\r\n    foliage and many-coloured blossoms which surround the sad scenes of\r\n    death, to symbolize the beauty and glory which surround those whom\r\n    angels shall wait upon in death, and carry them to Paradise?\r\n\r\n                                                            _To face page_\r\n\r\n  ORDINATION OF A PRIEST, LATE 12TH CENTURY                             94\r\n\r\n    Gives the Eucharistic vestments of bishop and priest, a priest in cope\r\n    and others in albes, the altar and its coverings, and two forms of\r\n    chalice.\r\n\r\n  ORDINATION OF A DEACON, A.D. 1520                                    146\r\n\r\n    Gives the vestments of that period. The man in the group behind the\r\n    bishop, who is in surplice and hood and “biretta,” is probably the\r\n    archdeacon. Note the one candle on the altar, the bishop’s chair, the\r\n    piscina with its cruet, and the triptych.\r\n\r\n  (1) AN ARCHDEACON LECTURING A GROUP OF CLERGYMEN ON THEIR SECULAR\r\n  HABITS AND WEAPONS, 14TH CENTURY                                     174\r\n\r\n    He is habited in a red tunic and cap, the clergy in blue tunic and red\r\n    hose and red tunic and blue hose.\r\n\r\n  (2) AN ARCHDEACON’S VISITATION                                       174\r\n\r\n  A CLERICAL PROCESSION                                                190\r\n\r\n    The illustration is taken from a French Pontifical of the 14th century\r\n    in the British Museum [Tiberius, B. viii.], and represents part of the\r\n    ceremonial of the anointing and crowning of a king of France. We\r\n    choose it because it gives in one view several varieties of clerical\r\n    costume. There was very little difference between French and English\r\n    vestments, _e.g._ the only French characteristic here is that the\r\n    bishop’s cope is embroidered with fleur-de-lys. On the left of the\r\n    picture is the king, and behind him officers of state and courtiers.\r\n    An ecclesiastical procession has met him at the door of the Cathedral\r\n    of Rheims, and the archbishop, in albe, cope, and mitre, is sprinkling\r\n    him with holy water; the clerk bearing the holy-water pot, and the\r\n    cross-bearer, and the thurifer swinging his censer, are immediately\r\n    behind him. Then come a group of canons. One is clearly shown, and\r\n    easily recognized by the peculiar horned hood with its fringe of\r\n    “clocks.” Lastly are a group of bishops, the most conspicuous bearing\r\n    in his hands the ampulla, which contains the holy oil for the\r\n    anointing.\r\n\r\n    The photograph fails here as in other cases to give the colours which\r\n    define the costumes clearly and give brilliancy to the picture. The\r\n    king’s tunic is crimson, and that of the nobleman behind him blue.

This is the result, we tell them, of two thousand\r\nyears of cultivation by an ever-increasing population.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we are helped to understand what the land was like at\r\nthe time of the settlement in it of our Saxon forefathers, by the\r\ndescriptions which our Colonial friends give us of their surroundings in\r\nAustralia or Africa, where the general face of the country is still in its\r\nprimeval state, the settlements of men are dotted sparsely here and there,\r\nthe flocks and herds roam over “bush” or “veldt,” and only just so much of\r\nthe land about the settlements is roughly cultivated as suffices the wants\r\nof the settlers.\r\n\r\nFor in England, in those remote times of which we have first to speak, the\r\nland was, for the most part, unreclaimed. If we call to mind that the\r\nEnglish population about the end of the sixth century could only have been\r\nabout a million souls--200,000 families--we shall realize how small a\r\nportion of the land they could possibly have occupied. A large proportion\r\nof the country was still primeval forest, there were extensive tracts of\r\nmoorland, the low-lying districts were mere and marsh, the mountainous\r\ndistricts wild and desolate. The country harboured wolf and bear, wild\r\ncattle and swine, beaver and badger, wild cat, fox, and marten, eagle,\r\nhawk, and heron, and other creatures, most of which have entirely\r\ndisappeared, though some linger on, interesting survivals, in remote\r\ncorners of the land.\r\n\r\nTheir possession of the country by the English was the result of recent,\r\nslow and desultory conquest. Independent parties of adventurers from the\r\ncountry round about the mouth of the Elbe had crossed the German Ocean in\r\ntheir keels, landed on the coast, or rowed up the rivers, and pushed\r\ntheir way slowly against a tenacious resistance. Then, when a party of the\r\ninvaders had made good their conquest, came its division among the\r\nconquerors.\r\n\r\nOur own history tells us so little of the details of the Anglo-Saxon\r\nconquest, that we have to call in what we know of the manners of their\r\nTeutonic neighbours and Scandinavian relatives to help us to understand\r\nit. The late Sir W. Dasent, in his “Burnt Njal,” says that the Norse\r\nViking, making an invasion with a view not to a mere raid, but to a\r\npermanent settlement, would lay claim to the whole valley drained by the\r\nriver up which he had rowed his victorious keels; or, landing on the\r\ncoast, would climb some neighbouring height, point out the headlands which\r\nhe arbitrarily assigned as his boundaries on the coast, and claim all the\r\nhinterland which he should be able to subdue. The chief would allot\r\nextensive tracts to the subordinate leaders; and the freemen would be\r\nsettled, after their native custom of village communities, upon the most\r\nfertile portions of the soil which their swords had helped to win. In the\r\nbroad alluvial lands of the river valleys there would be ample space for\r\nseveral neighbouring townships; in forest clearings or fertile dales the\r\ntownships would be scattered at more or less wide intervals. The\r\nunallotted lands belonged to the general community; it was Folk land, and\r\nits allotment from time to time, probably, in theory needed confirmation\r\nby a Folk-mote, but was practically made by the supreme chief.\r\n\r\nEvery township possessed a tract of arable land, which was divided by lot\r\nyearly among the families of the freemen; a tract of meadow, which was\r\nreserved for hay, cultivated and harvested by the common labour; a wide\r\nexpanse of pasture, into which each family had the right to turn a fixed\r\nnumber of cattle and sheep; and into the forest, a fixed number of swine\r\nto feed on the acorns, mast, and roots.[1] The people were rude\r\nagriculturists, not manufacturers, not traders, not civilized enough to\r\nprofit by the civilization which the Romans had established in the\r\ncountry; they stormed and sacked the towns, and left them deserted, and\r\nselected only the most fertile spots for occupation.\r\n\r\nIt is a subject of dispute among our most learned historians to what\r\nextent the native Britons were slain or retired before the invaders, or to\r\nwhat extent they were taken as captives, or reappeared from their\r\nfastnesses after the slaughter was over, to be the slaves of the\r\nconquerors. When we first get glimpses of the situation of things after\r\nthe conquest, we find that the British language and religion have\r\ndisappeared from the Saxon half of the country; and this implies the\r\ndisappearance of the great body of the people. The fact of the continuance\r\nof some ancient place-names, chiefly of great natural features, as hills\r\nand rivers, and of a few British words for things for which the Teutons\r\nhad no names, would be sufficiently accounted for by the survival of a\r\nvery small remnant.\r\n\r\nIn their native seats the social condition of these Angle and Saxon\r\nfreemen was patriarchal and primitive; they venerated their chiefs as\r\nWoden-born; they elected one of them as their leader in battle; but they\r\ndid not obey them as their subjects. On questions of general importance\r\nthe chiefs and wise men advised the Folk-mote, and the people said “Aye”\r\nor “No.” But their circumstances in their new conquests led to changes. It\r\nwas necessary to maintain some sort of permanent military organization not\r\nonly for the defence of their new possessions, and the extension of their\r\nconquests against the old inhabitants of the island, but also against the\r\nencroachments of rival tribes of their own countrymen. And a supreme\r\nchief, to whom all paid a kind of religious veneration, who exercised\r\npermanent military authority over lesser chiefs and people, soon became a\r\nking; limited, however, in power by the ancient institutions of the\r\nCouncil of the wise men, and the assent or dissent of the Folk-mote.\r\n\r\nThe several parties of invaders gradually extended their conquests until\r\nthey met, and then made treaties or fought battles with one another,\r\nuntil, finally, by the end of the sixth century, they had organized\r\nthemselves into seven independent kingdoms.\r\n\r\nThe freemen of each Township managed their own affairs in a town meeting;\r\na number of neighbouring townships were grouped into what was called by\r\nthe Saxons south of the Humber a Hundred, by the Angles north of the\r\nHumber a Wapentake; and each township sent four or five of its freemen to\r\nrepresent it in the Hundred-mote every three months. Three times a year,\r\nin summer, autumn, and midwinter, a general meeting of the freemen was\r\nheld--a Folk-mote--at some central place; to which every township was\r\nrequired to send so many footmen armed with sword, spear, and shield, and\r\nso many horsemen properly equipped. At these Folk-motes affairs of general\r\ninterest were determined, justice was administered by the chief and\r\npriests,[2] and probably it was at these meetings that the great acts of\r\nnational worship were celebrated. Except for these periodical meetings,\r\nthe scattered townships existed in great isolation. A striking\r\nillustration of this isolation is afforded by laws of Wihtred of Kent and\r\nof Ine of the West Saxons, which enact--or perhaps merely record an\r\nancient unwritten law--that if any stranger approached a township off the\r\nhighway without shouting or sounding a horn to announce his coming, he\r\nmight be slain as a thief, and his relatives have no redress. A subsequent\r\nlaw of Edgar[3] enacts that if he have with him an ox or a dog, with a\r\nbell hanging to his neck, and sounding at every step, that should be taken\r\nas sufficient warning, otherwise he must sound his horn. The local\r\nexclusiveness produced by this isolation, the suspicion and dislike of\r\nstrangers, survive to this day in secluded villages in the wilder parts of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese Teutonic tribes were heathen at the time of their coming into the\r\nland. Of their religion and its observances our own historians have given\r\nno detailed account, and few incidental notices. Our names for the days of\r\nthe week, Sun-day, Moon-day, Tuisco’s-day, Woden’s-day, Thor’s-day,\r\nFrya’s-day, Saeter’s-day, make it certain that our Anglo-Saxon ancestors\r\nworshipped the same gods as their Scandinavian neighbours, and probable\r\nthat their religion as a whole was similar. Their supreme god was Odin or\r\nWoden, with whom were associated the twelve Æsir and their goddess-wives,\r\nand a multitude of other supernatural beings. In their belief in an\r\nAll-father, superior to all the gods and goddesses--we recognize a relic\r\nof an earlier monotheism. They had structural temples, and in connection\r\nwith their temples they had idols, priests, altars, and sacrifices. They\r\nbelieved in the immortality of the soul, in an intermediate state, and a\r\nfinal heaven and hell. The souls of the brave and good, they believed,\r\nwent to Asgard, the abode of the Æsir; there the warriors all day enjoyed\r\nthe fierce delight of combat, and in the evening all their wounds healed,\r\nand they spent the night in feasting in Valhalla, the hall of the gods;\r\nthe wicked went to Niflheim, a place of pain and terror. But the time\r\nwould come when the earth, and sun, and stars, and Valhalla, and the gods,\r\nand giants, and elves, should be consumed in a great and general\r\nconflagration, and then Gimli and Nastrond, the eternal heaven and hell,\r\nshould be revealed. Gimli--a new earth adorned with green meadows, where\r\nthe fields bring forth without culture, and calamities are unknown; where\r\nthere is a palace more shining than the sun, and where religious and\r\nwell-minded men shall abide for ever; Nastrond--a place full of serpents\r\nwho vomit forth venom, in which shall wade evil men and women, and\r\nmurderers and adulterers.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of their religious customs would help us to judge what\r\nhindrance they opposed to the reception of the system of the Christian\r\nChurch; or, on the other hand, what facilities they offered for the\r\nsubstitution of one for the other; but it is only from the assumption that\r\nthe religious customs of our English ancestors were similar to those of\r\nthe Norsemen that we are able to form to ourselves any conception on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nIn Iceland, conformably to the constitution of its government, each\r\nseveral district (the island was divided into four districts) had its\r\npriest who not only presided over the religious rites of the people, but\r\nalso directed the deliberations of the people when their laws were made,\r\nand presided over the administration of justice (Neander, “Church Hist.,”\r\nv. 418).\r\n\r\nSir W. Dasent says that after the Norse conqueror had marked out his\r\nboundaries and settled his people on their holdings, and chosen a site for\r\nhis own rude timber hall, he erected in its neighbourhood a temple in\r\nwhich his followers might worship the gods of their forefathers, and that\r\nthis was one means of maintaining their habitual attachment to his\r\nleadership.[4] The evidence leads to the conclusion that both\r\nScandinavians and Teutons had very few structural temples, perhaps only\r\none to each tribe or nation; and perhaps only three great annual occasions\r\nof tribal or national worship. We get a glimpse of one of these structural\r\ntemples in the story of the conversion of Norway.[5] The great temple at\r\nMære, in the Drontheim district, contained wooden images of the gods; the\r\npeople assembled there thrice a year at midwinter, spring, and harvest;\r\nthe people feasted on horseflesh slain in sacrifice, and wine blessed in\r\nthe name and in honour of the gods; and human victims were sometimes\r\noffered.\r\n\r\nThe English townships, generally, it is probable, had no structural\r\ntemples, but sacred places of resort, as an open space in the forest, or a\r\nhilltop, or a striking mass of rock, or a notable tree or well. The\r\nreligious observances at such places would probably not be a regular\r\nworship of the gods, but such superstitions as the passing of children\r\nthrough clefts in rocks and trees, dropping pins into wells, and others;\r\nthese superstitions survived for centuries, for they are forbidden by a\r\nlaw of Canute,[6] and one of them, the consultation of wells, so late as\r\nby a canon of Archbishop Anselm;[7] and, in spite of laws, and canons, and\r\ncivilization, and a thousand years of Christianity, some of them survive\r\namong the peasantry of remote districts to this very day.\r\n\r\nIn the “Ecclesiastical History” of Bede, we find notices of only three\r\nstructural heathen temples in England. The first is that at Godmundingham,\r\nwhich Coifi, the chief of the king’s priests, with the assent of King\r\nEdwin and his counsellors and thanes, defiled and destroyed on the\r\nacceptance of Christianity at the preaching of Paulinus. Of this we read\r\nthat it had a _fanum_, enclosed with _septis_, which contained _idola_ and\r\n_aras_;[8] and since the temple was set on fire and thus destroyed, it\r\nseems likely that the fanum was of timber. The second temple named is the\r\nbuilding east of Canterbury, in which King Ethelbert was accustomed to\r\nworship while yet a heathen, which, on the king’s conversion, was\r\nconsecrated as a church and dedicated to St. Pancras, and was soon\r\nafterwards incorporated into the monastery of SS. Peter and Paul built on\r\nthe site. This was probably a stone building, and recent researches have\r\nbrought to light what are possibly remains of it. The third temple is that\r\nin which Redwald, King of the East Anglians, after his conversion at the\r\nCourt of Ethelbert, worshipped Christ at one altar, while his queen\r\ncontinued the old heathen worship at another altar in the same building.\r\nIt will be observed that all these were the temples of kings, and this\r\naccords with the supposition that such structural temples existed only in\r\nthe chief places for worship of tribes and nations; just as the twelve\r\ntribes of Israel had only one great national temple, while they had\r\nnumerous altars on the “high places” all over the country.[9]\r\n\r\nAgain, there is a remarkable absence all through the history of any\r\nmention of, or allusion to, the existence of a priesthood ministering\r\namong the people. The only priest clearly mentioned is the worldly-minded\r\nCoifi spoken of above, but as he is mentioned as “the chief of the king’s\r\npriests,” we assume that there was a staff of them, probably attached to\r\nthe king’s temple at Godmundingham. We suppose that Ethelbert of Kent, and\r\nRedwald of East Anglia, would also have a priest or priests attached to\r\ntheir temples; but we find no trace or indication of any others.\r\n\r\nThis all tends to confirm our belief that there were few structural\r\ntemples, one for each kingdom, or perhaps one for each of the great tribes\r\nwhich had coalesced into a kingdom; and that the priests were only a small\r\nstaff attached to each of these temples; while all the rest of the temples\r\nwere open-air places to which the neighbouring inhabitants resorted for\r\nminor observances, without the assistance of any formal priesthood.\r\n\r\nAnother possible source of information on the subject is the ancient\r\nplace-names. Godmundingham naturally invites consideration, and looks\r\npromising at first sight; but analyzed and interpreted it means the home\r\nof the sons of Godmund, and Godmund merely means “protection of God” as a\r\n_name_.[10]\r\n\r\nThe Saxon word Hearh[11] means either a temple or an idol.[12] Hearga is\r\nthe word by which the _fanum_ at Godmundingham and Redwald’s _fanum_ is\r\ntranslated in Alfred’s version of Bede. It seems possible that this word\r\nmay be the root of such place-names as Harrow-on-the-Hill, Harrowgate,\r\nYorks, and Harrowden, Northants. Such place-names as Wednesbury,\r\nWedensfield, Satterthwaite, Satterleigh, Baldersby, Balderstone,\r\nBulderton, and those of which Thor or Thur is the first syllable, may\r\npossibly indicate places where a temple or an idol or well has existed of\r\nWoden, or Saeter, or Baldur, or Thor; as Thrus Kell (Thor’s Well) in\r\nCraven.[13]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE CONVERSION OF THE ENGLISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the conversion of our heathen forefathers has happily been\r\ntold so often in recent times that it is not necessary to repeat it here.\r\nIt is sufficient for our purpose to recall to mind how when Augustine and\r\nhis Italian company came to Kent, they addressed themselves to King\r\nEthelbert, who had married a Christian princess of the House of Clovis,\r\nand were permitted by him to settle and preach in his kingdom; how King\r\nOswald, on his recovery of his ancestral kingdom of Northumbria, sent to\r\nthe Fathers of Iona, among whom he had learnt Christianity during his\r\nexile, for missionaries to convert his people; how Sigebert, King of the\r\nEast Saxons, and Peada, sub-King of the Middle Angles in Mercia, obtained\r\nmissionaries from Northumbria; how Sigebert, King of the East Angles,\r\ninvited Bishop Felix to give to his people the religion and civilization\r\nwhich he had learnt in exile in Burgundy; how the Italian Bishop Birinus\r\ncame to the Court of King Cynegils, and converted him, and taught among\r\nthe men of Wessex; and, finally, how Wilfrid of York began the conversion\r\nof the South Saxons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Ruined Cathedral, Iona.]\r\n\r\nIn the Apostolic Age, the conversion of people in a condition of ancient\r\ncivilization began among the lower classes of the people, and ascended\r\nslowly man by man through the higher classes, and it was three hundred\r\nyears before the conversion of the Emperor Constantine made Christianity\r\nthe religion of the empire. In the conversion of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms,\r\nthe work began in every case with the kings and the higher classes of the\r\npeople; and the people under their leadership abandoned their old religion\r\nand accepted Christianity as the national religion, and put themselves\r\nunder the teaching of the missionaries, as a general measure of national\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this probably is that their Teutonic kinsmen, Goths,\r\nBurgundians, and Franks, who had carved for themselves kingdoms out of the\r\nbody of the Roman empire, having accepted the religion and the\r\ncivilization of the people they had conquered, were growing rapidly in\r\nprosperity and the arts of civilized life. Christianity was the religion\r\nof the new Teutonic civilization, and heathenism was a part of the old\r\nstate of barbarism. The Angles and Saxons, when they fastened upon this\r\nderelict province of the empire, were too barbarous to appreciate\r\ncivilization, and destroyed it; but by the time that they had been settled\r\nfor some generations in their new seats they had outgrown their old wild\r\nheathenism; and their kings had become sufficiently politic to desire to\r\nlearn how to raise the new kingdoms which they governed to an equality\r\nwith those of the kindred Continental nations. Hence, some of the\r\nheptarchic kings sought for Christian teachers to help them, and others\r\nwere willing to receive them when they offered themselves.\r\n\r\nOur previous study of the organization, religion, and customs of the\r\npeople will help us to understand the process of the revolution. The\r\nkings, when converted, put the matter before the constitutional council of\r\nchiefs and wise men, and with their assent, and perhaps after a reference\r\nof the question to a folk-mote, formally adopted the new religion. The\r\nhistory which Bede gives of the first acceptance of Christianity in\r\nNorthumbria, under the teaching of Paulinus, affords a profoundly\r\ninteresting example of the process--the long hesitation of the king, the\r\ndiscussion in the witan, the general acceptance of the new faith, the zeal\r\nof the chief priest in destroying the national temple, the flocking of the\r\npeople to the preaching of Paulinus, and their baptism in multitudes in\r\nthe neighbouring rivers.\r\n\r\nIn no instance were the missionaries persecuted; in no instance did the\r\nkings coerce their people into the acceptance of the new religion.[14] In\r\nsuch a wholesale transition from one religion to another, it is not\r\nsurprising that there occurred partial and temporary relapses, as in Kent\r\nand Essex, on the death of King Ethelbert, 616, in Wessex on the death of\r\nCynegils, 643, and again in Essex, after the plague of 664; still less\r\nsurprising that old superstitions retained their hold of the minds of a\r\nrude and ignorant people for centuries.[15]\r\n\r\nIf we are right in our conjectures that every kingdom had a national\r\ntemple at the principal residence of the king with a small staff of\r\npriests, and a few smaller temples with their priests under the patronage\r\nof some of the subordinate chiefs, and that these temples were resorted to\r\nby the people for special acts of common worship at the great festivals\r\nthree or four times in the course of the year, then it would not be\r\ndifficult for the new religion to supply to the people all that they had\r\nbeen accustomed to of religious observances. Churches on the sites of the\r\nold temples, with their clergy, and services on the great festivals of the\r\nChristian year, would satisfy the customs of the people; and, in fact, the\r\ncircumstances of the Christian missionaries led in the first instance to\r\narrangements of this nature.\r\n\r\nIn every kingdom the king, who had been the patron of the old religion,\r\ntook the new teachers under his protection, and made provision for their\r\nmaintenance by the donation of an estate in land with farmers and slaves\r\nupon it; thus Ethelbert gave to Augustine a church and house in\r\nCanterbury, and land outside the city for a site for his monastery, and\r\nestates at Reculver and elsewhere for maintenance; Oswald gave to Aidan\r\nthe isle of Lindisfarne, under the shadow of his principal residence at\r\nBamborough; Ethelwalch gave Wilfred eighty-seven hides at Selsey, and\r\nWilfrid began his work, as probably the other missionary bishops did, by\r\nemancipating his slaves and baptizing them; Cynegils, on his baptism, gave\r\nBirinus lands round Winchester, and his son Coinwalch endowed the church\r\nthere with three manors; a little later, Wulfhere of Mercia gave Chad a\r\nwild tract of a hundred thousand acres between Lichfield and Ecclesfield.\r\nThis was the “establishment” and beginning of the “endowment” of the\r\nChurch in England.\r\n\r\nThe bishop in every kingdom first built a church and set up Divine\r\nservice, then simultaneously set up a school, and invited the king and\r\nchiefs to send their sons to be educated. Aidan took twelve youths of\r\nnoble birth as his pupils, and added slaves whom he purchased. The young\r\nmen of noble families showed themselves eager to avail themselves of the\r\nteaching and training of the missionaries, and readily offered themselves\r\nto training for Holy Orders. The ladies at first, before there were\r\nmonasteries for women in England, went to the monasteries at Brie and\r\nChelles near Paris, and at Andelys near Rouen, which were under the\r\ngovernment of members of the Frankish royal families. From his central\r\nstation the bishop went out and sent his priests on missionary journeys to\r\nthe neighbouring townships, to teach and baptize.\r\n\r\nWe know that all the first missionary bishops, except Felix and Birinus,\r\nand perhaps they also, and most of their clergy, had been trained in the\r\nmonastic life of that time, so that it was natural to them to live in\r\ncommunity, under the rule of a superior, a very simple and regular life,\r\nwith frequent offices of prayer, and duties carefully defined, and\r\nscrupulously fulfilled; a beautiful object-lesson on the Christian life\r\nfor the study of the king and his household, and the people round about\r\nthe bishop’s town.\r\n\r\nBede gives some interesting stories which illustrate this early phase of\r\nthe English conversion. He tells us how Paulinus preached all day long to\r\nthe people at Yeverin and Catterick[16] in Northumbria, and at\r\nSouthwell[17] in Lindsey, and baptized the people by hundreds in the\r\nneighbouring rivers. He tells us how Aidan preached to Oswald’s Court and\r\npeople, and the King interpreted for him;[18] how Aidan travelled through\r\nthe country on foot, accompanied by a group of monks and laymen,\r\nmeditating on the scriptures, or singing psalms as they went;[19] not that\r\nhe needed to travel on foot, for King Oswin had given him a fine horse\r\nwhich he might use in crossing rivers, or upon any urgent necessity; but a\r\nshort time after, a poor man meeting him, and asking alms, the good bishop\r\nbestowed upon him the horse with its royal trappings.[20] We learn from\r\nthe same authority that the company which attended a missionary bishop in\r\nhis progress through the country were not always singing psalms as they\r\nwent. Herebald, a pupil of St. John of Beverley, relates how one day as\r\nthat bishop and his clergy and pupils were journeying, they came to a\r\npiece of open ground well adapted for galloping their horses, and the\r\nyoung men importuned the bishop for permission to try their speed, which\r\nhe reluctantly granted; and so they ran races till Herebald was thrown,\r\nand, striking his head against a stone, lay insensible; whereupon they\r\npitched a tent over him.[21]\r\n\r\nAn “interior” picture is afforded by a sentence in the life of\r\nBoniface,[22] who was afterwards to be the Apostle of Germany. When the\r\nitinerant teachers used to come to the township in which Winfrid’s father\r\nwas the principal proprietor, they were hospitably entertained at his\r\nfather’s house; and the child would presently talk with them as well as he\r\ncould, at such an early age (six or seven years), about heavenly things,\r\nand inquire what might hereafter profit himself and his weakness (A.D.\r\n680).\r\n\r\nFinally Bede sums up the work of this period. “The religious habit was at\r\nthat period in great veneration; so that wheresoever any clergyman or monk\r\nhappened to come, he was joyfully received by all persons as God’s\r\nservant; and if they chanced to meet him on the way, they ran to him, and,\r\nbowing, were glad to be signed with his hand, or blessed with his mouth.\r\nOn Sundays they flocked eagerly to the Church or the monasteries, not to\r\nfeed their bodies, but to hear the Word of God; and if any priest happened\r\nto come into a village, the inhabitants flocked together to hear the word\r\nof life; for the priests and clergymen went into the village on no other\r\naccount than to preach, baptize, visit the sick, and, in short, to take\r\ncare of souls.”[23]\r\n\r\nSo Cuthbert, a little later, not only afforded counsels and an example of\r\nregular life to his monastery, “but often went out of the monastery,\r\nsometimes on horseback, but oftener on foot, and repaired to the\r\nneighbouring towns, where he preached the way to such as were gone astray;\r\nwhich had been also done by his predecessor Boisil in his time. He was\r\nwont chiefly to visit the villages seated high among the rocky uncouth\r\nmountains, whose poverty and barbarity made them inaccessible to other\r\nteachers. He would sometimes stay away from the monastery one, two, three\r\nweeks, and even a whole month among the mountains, to allure the rustic\r\npeople by his eloquent preaching to heavenly employments.”[24]\r\n\r\nIt seems likely that the itinerating missionaries, on arriving at a\r\ntownship, would seek out the chief man, first to ask hospitality from him,\r\nand next to engage his interest with the people to assemble together at\r\nsome convenient place to hear his preaching. When the people were\r\nconverted, he would make arrangements for periodical visits to them for\r\nDivine service, and the “convenient place” would become their outdoor\r\nchurch; and there is good reason to believe that in many cases a cross of\r\nstone or wood, whichever was the most accessible material, was erected to\r\nmark and hallow the place.[25]\r\n\r\nEven after a priest was permanently settled, and a church built at the\r\nville of the lord of the land, the scattered hamlets on the estate would\r\nstill, perhaps for centuries, have only open-air stations for prayer. It\r\nis very possible that some of these were the places where the people,\r\nwhile unconverted, had been used to assemble for their ancient religious\r\nceremonies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Saxon Cross at Ruthwell, c. 680 A.D. (For its history and\r\ndescription, see “Theodore and Wilfrid,” by the Bishop of Bristol.)]\r\n\r\nSome of the Saxon churchyard crosses which still remain, as at Whalley,\r\nBakewell, Eyam, etc., possibly were station crosses. Possibly the well\r\nwhich exists in some churches and churchyards, and the yew tree of vast\r\nantiquity found in many churchyards, would carry us back, if we knew their\r\nstory, to pre-Christian times and heathen ceremonials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Churchyard Cross, Eyam, Derbyshire.]\r\n\r\nIn time a church or chapel was built in this accustomed place of assembly,\r\nas we shall find in a later chapter. But here we have to throw out a\r\nconjecture as to an intermediate state of things between the open-air\r\nstation and the structural church. We have before us the curious fact that\r\nusually the rector of a church is liable for the repair of the chancel,\r\nand the people for the repair of the nave. This seems to point to the fact\r\nthat the forerunner of the rector built the first chancel, and left the\r\npeople to build the nave; and we suggest the following explanation; at\r\nfirst in the worship of these stations, a temporary table was placed on\r\ntrestles, and a “portable altar” upon that, and so the holy mysteries were\r\ncelebrated. But in rainy weather this was inconvenient and unseemly; and\r\nthe rector of the parish provided a kind of little chapel for the\r\nprotection of the altar and ministrant; indeed, there is an ancient\r\nforeign canon which requires rectors to do so. Then the parishioners, for\r\ntheir own shelter from the weather, built a nave on to the chancel,\r\ncommunicating with it by an arch through which the congregation could\r\nconveniently see and hear the service.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Base of Acca’s Cross, c. 740 A.D., from “Theodore and\r\nWilfrid,” by the Bishop of Bristol. S.P.C.K.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE MONASTIC PHASE OF THE CHURCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the bishops who introduced the Christian Faith into the\r\nheptarchic kingdoms established themselves and their clergy as religious\r\ncommunities, on the lands, and with the means which the kings gave them,\r\nbuilt their churches and schools, and made them the centres of their\r\nevangelizing work. The next stage in the work was the multiplication of\r\nsimilar centres. The princes and ealdormen who were in subordinate\r\nauthority over subdivisions of a kingdom would have two motives for\r\ndesiring to have such establishments beside them. First they had very\r\nlikely in some cases been the patrons of a temple or an idol, and a\r\npriest, near their principal residence, and would desire to maintain their\r\ninfluence over their dependents and neighbours by keeping up a similar\r\nplace of religious worship for them. Secondly, as enlightened men and\r\nzealous converts, they would be glad to have near them some of these new\r\nteachers of religion and civilization, and to establish one of these\r\ncentres of light and leading to the neighbouring country. The bishops also\r\nobtained grants of land from the king in suitable places, in order to\r\nfound on them new centres of evangelization.\r\n\r\nThus in Kent, Ethelbert founded the monastery of SS. Peter and Paul, which\r\nis better known to us as St. Augustine’s (A.D. 603), and his son Eadbald\r\nfounded an offshoot from it at Dover (630). In 633 the latter king founded\r\na nunnery at Folkestone as a provision for his daughter Eanswitha, who\r\nbecame its first abbess. And when, in the same year, his sister Ethelburga\r\narrived as a refugee from Northumbria, he made provision for her by the\r\ngift of an estate at Lyminge, where the widowed queen founded a monastery.\r\nOn the death of Earconbert, 664, Sexburga, his widow, built for herself a\r\nnunnery in the Isle of Sheppy. Sexburga was succeeded at Sheppy by her\r\ndaughter Eormenhilda, and she by her daughter Werburga. Eormenburga,\r\ngranddaughter of King Eadbald, built a nunnery, of which she was the first\r\nabbess, in the Isle of Thanet; and was succeeded by her daughter St.\r\nMildred. Lastly, King Egbert, in 669, gave Reculver to his mass-priest,\r\nBass, that he might build a minster thereon.\r\n\r\nIn Northumbria, King Edwin built a church at York. Oswald gave Aidan the\r\nIsle of Lindisfarne as the site of a religious house to be a centre of\r\nmissionary work in Northumbria. Aidan encouraged Hieu, the first nun of\r\nthe Northumbrian race, to organize a small nunnery on the north bank of\r\nthe Wear, and to remove thence to Hartlepool; there she was succeeded by\r\nHilda, the grand-niece of King Edwin, who subsequently removed to Whitby.\r\nBesides organizing that famous double house, Hilda founded Hackness and\r\nseveral other cells on estates of the abbey. The nunnery at Coldingham was\r\nfounded by Ebba, sister of King Oswald, who was herself the first abbess.\r\nKing Oswy, on the eve of battle with Penda (655), vowed, in case of\r\nvictory, to dedicate his infant daughter Elfleda to God, and to give\r\ntwelve estates to build monasteries. In fulfilment of his vow, he gave\r\nElfleda into the charge of Hilda, at Hartlepool (655), and gave six\r\nestates in Bernicia and six in Deira, each of ten families (= hides of\r\nland), of which probably Whitby was one, and perhaps Ripon and Hexham were\r\nothers. Benedict Biscop, a man of noble if not royal descent, received\r\ngrants of land from King Egfrid to found his famous monastery at Wearmouth\r\nin 674, and eleven years later (685) at Jarrow. King Oswy built a\r\nmonastery at Gilling to atone for the crime of the slaughter of his\r\nbrother there (642), that prayer might be daily offered up for the souls\r\nof both the slain and the slayer. King Ethelwald, son of Oswald and\r\nsub-king of Deira, gave Bishop Cedd of the East Saxons a site for a\r\nmonastery at Lastingham, Yorkshire, that he might himself sometimes resort\r\nto it for prayer, and might be buried there. Cedd left the monastery, on\r\nhis death, to his brother Chadd, afterwards Bishop of Lichfield.\r\nWulfhere, King of Mercia, gave Chadd fifty hides of land for the endowment\r\nof his abbey at Barton-on-Humber.\r\n\r\nIn the fen country of the Girvii, between Mercia and East Anglia, the two\r\nkings, Peada of Mercia, and Oswy of the East Angles, concurred in the\r\nfoundation of a monastery at Medeshamsted (Peterborough, 655), and this\r\nwas followed by the foundation of Croyland (716) and Thorney (682). When\r\nEtheldreda, the daughter of Anna, King of the East Angles, and virgin wife\r\nof Egfrid of Northumbria, at length obtained her husband’s leave to enter\r\nupon the religious life, she built herself a double monastery on her own\r\nestate in the Isle of Ely (673). On her death, she was succeeded as abbess\r\nby her sisters Sexburga, Eormenhilda and Werburga, each of whom had\r\npreviously been abbesses at Sheppy.\r\n\r\nAmong the West Saxons, a small community of Irish monks, at Malmesbury\r\n(675), was enlarged by Aldhelm, a man of royal extraction, into a great\r\ncentre of religion and learning; and he and Bishop Daniel founded a number\r\nof small monasteries, as Nutcelle (700) and Bradfield, up and down that\r\nkingdom.[26]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Saxon Church at Bradford-on-Avon. (Probably one of Bishop\r\nAldhelm’s churches.)]\r\n\r\nThe four priests whom Peada, the son of Penda, on his conversion, took\r\nback with him from Northumbria to his Princedom of the Middle Angles,\r\nlived together in community for some years, till, by the death of Penda,\r\nhis son attained the Kingship of Mercia, and then Diuma was consecrated\r\nBishop of the Mercians, and established his see at Lichfield. Earconwald\r\n(who was afterwards Bishop of London, 674), a man of noble birth, built a\r\nmonastery for himself at Chertsey in Surrey, and a nunnery at Barking in\r\nEssex, for his sister Ethelberga. “The vales of Worcestershire and\r\nGloucestershire were famous for the multitude and grandeur of their\r\nmonastic institutions.” A monastic cell is said to have been founded at\r\nTewkesbury in 675, and one at Deerhurst, by Ethelmund the ealdorman, at a\r\nstill earlier date. Osric, the Prince of Wiccii, was probably the founder\r\nof St. Peter’s Nunnery, Gloucester, and of Bath Abbey. Apparently his\r\nbrother Oswald founded Pershore Abbey; and their sister Cyneburga was the\r\nfirst Abbess of Gloucester. Saxulph, Bishop of Lichfield, founded a little\r\nreligious house of St. Peter, at Worcester, which became the see of the\r\nfirst Bishop of Worcester, when that diocese was founded by Archbishop\r\nTheodore (680). Egwine, Bishop of Worcester, founded a monastery at\r\nEvesham (702), and laying down his bishopric, retired thither to spend the\r\nremainder of his life as its abbot.[27]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following names will nearly complete the list of religious houses up\r\nto the end of the eighth century: Abingdon, 675; Acle, seventh century;\r\nAmesbury, 600; Bardney, seventh century; Bedrichsworth (St. Edmunds), 630;\r\nBosham, 681; Bredon, 761; Caistor, 650; Carlisle, 686; Clive, 790;\r\nCnobheresbury (Burgh Castle), 637; Congresbury, 474; Dacor, seventh\r\ncentury; Derauuda, 714; Dereham, 650; Finchale, seventh century; Fladbury,\r\n691; Gateshead, seventh century; Glastonbury, fifth century; Ikanho\r\n(Boston), 654; Ithanacester, 630; Kempsey, 799; Kidderminster, 736;\r\nLeominster, 660; Oundle, 711; Oxford St. Frideswide, 735; Partney, seventh\r\ncentury; Petrocstow, sixth century; Peykirk, eighth century; Redbridge,\r\nHants.

St. Augustine’s monastery at Canterbury was the earliest of them.\r\nBenedict Biscop’s monasteries at Wearmouth and Jarrow, and Wilfrid’s at\r\nRipon and Hexham, and others, were of this type.\r\n\r\nThe life of these greater monasteries was led according to a strict and\r\nascetic rule. St. Augustine would certainly adopt at Canterbury the rule\r\nwhich his master, Gregory, had drawn up for his own house of St. Andrew on\r\nthe Cœlian Hill. Benedict Biscop built his houses and framed his rule\r\nafter repeated visits to Italy and France and a careful study of the most\r\nfamous of their religious communities; Wilfrid would certainly introduce a\r\nsimilar rule into the monasteries over which he presided; these would\r\nfollow the main lines of the Benedictine rule; though that, in its\r\nentirety, was not introduced till the reformation of the monasteries in\r\nthe time of King Egbert and Archbishop Dunstan. The monastery at\r\nLindisfarne would naturally follow the customs of Iona and the less rigid\r\nlife of the Scottish religious houses; and is to be regarded rather as a\r\ncitadel of Christian learning, and a centre of evangelization, than as a\r\nplace devoted to seclusion and contemplation. The other religious houses\r\nwhich owed their existence to the missionaries from Lindisfarne would be\r\nlikely to follow its customs.\r\n\r\nSome of the smaller religious houses were conducted on the same lines of\r\nstrict ascetic discipline as the greater monasteries; but in many of them\r\nthe life was little more “regular” or ascetic than that of an ordinary\r\nhousehold--say that of a church dignitary--scrupulous in the attendance of\r\nall its members at the daily services in the oratory, and in the strict\r\ndecorum of their daily life. This opened an easy door to abuse, and in a\r\nshort time the discipline of many of the monasteries had become very lax.\r\n\r\nOne remarkable feature of these early monasteries is that many of them\r\nwere hereditary properties, and the rule over them often descended from\r\nfather to son and from mother to daughter. We have seen the successions in\r\nthe Kentish monasteries and at Ely from sister to sister and from mother\r\nto daughter. Cedd bequeathed his monastery of Lastingham to his brother\r\nChad. Benedict Biscop saw the danger of the custom, and declared that he\r\nwould not transfer his monasteries to his own brother unless he was a fit\r\nperson to be abbot. Whitgils built a small church and monastery at\r\nSpurnhead in Holderness, and left them to his heirs; they came at last, by\r\nlegitimate succession, to no less distinguished a person than Alcuin; who\r\nwas, therefore, not only Abbot of Tours, with its vast territory on which\r\nthere were 200,000 serfs, but also of this little monastery in his native\r\ncountry. Hedda, who styles himself mass-priest, in 790 bequeathed his\r\npatrimonial inheritance, consisting of two large parcels of land, with a\r\nminster on one of them, limiting the succession of the latter to clergymen\r\nof his family considered capable of ruling a minster according to\r\necclesiastical law, and in default of such heir, it was to go to Worcester\r\nCathedral, where he had been bred and schooled (“Cod. Dipl.,” i.\r\n206).[29]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand how it was that in process of time many of these\r\nsemi-secular religious houses passed easily into the status of parochial\r\nrectories; and, on the other hand, how a rectory, which often had a number\r\nof chaplains and clerks to assist the rector in ministering to the mother\r\nchurch and its outlying chapels, came to be called a “minster.”\r\n\r\nIn the Danish invasions and occupations, most of these religious houses\r\nwere plundered and ruined, the greater houses were not at once reoccupied\r\non the restoration of order, and most of the smaller houses disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the revival of religion in the reign of Edgar under the\r\ninfluence of Dunstan, it was the boast of the king and his ecclesiastical\r\nadvisers that they had restored not less than forty of the old\r\nmonasteries, and brought them to the discipline of the Benedictine rule. A\r\nfew monasteries were restored or founded after that time, notably by\r\nCanute at Bury St. Edmunds, and at Hulme in Norfolk, and by Edward the\r\nConfessor at Westminster; but at the time of the Conquest there were\r\nprobably not more than about fifty monasteries in the country of any\r\naccount; and in the latter part of the period the monastic zeal of\r\nDunstan’s revival had cooled down to a level of average religiousness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nDIOCESAN AND PAROCHIAL ORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe English Conversion forms a remarkable chapter in the general history\r\nof Christian missions; the piety, simplicity, zeal, and unselfishness of\r\nthe missionaries are beyond praise; not less remarkable is the earnestness\r\nwith which the English embraced the new faith and the civilization which\r\ncame together with it. The fact bears witness to the intellectual and\r\nmoral qualities of the people that in the very first generation of\r\nconverts there were men of learning and character like Wilfrid and\r\nBenedict Biscop, like the pupils of Hilda of Whitby, like Ithamar and\r\nDeusdedit in Kent, worthy of taking place among the bishops and abbots of\r\ntheir time.\r\n\r\nThe royal and noble ladies who played so important a part, in the\r\ninfluence they exercised in affairs, or in the foundation and rule of\r\nreligious houses which trained bishops and priests, present a spectacle,\r\nalmost unparalleled in history, of which their descendants may well be\r\nproud.\r\n\r\nThe English kings and nobles put themselves frankly under the guidance of\r\ntheir teachers not only in religion and literature, but in the arts of\r\ncivilization. The three codes of law which have remained to us--the first\r\nwritten laws of the English race--carry proof on the face of them that\r\nthey were compiled under the influence of the Christian teachers. The\r\nprinces sought their counsel in the Witenagemot, and put them beside the\r\nsecular judges in the administration of justice at the hundred and folk\r\nmotes. “In a single century England became known to Christendom as a\r\nfountain of light, as a land of learned men, of devout and unwearied\r\nmissions, of strong, rich, and pious kings.”[30]\r\n\r\nBy the third quarter of the seventh century the first fervour of the\r\nEnglish conversion had cooled down, and circumstances produced a kind of\r\ncrisis. One of those plagues which at intervals ravaged mediæval\r\nEurope--it was called the Yellow Pest--during the summer of 664 swept over\r\nEngland from south to north. Earconbert, King of Kent, and Deusdedit, the\r\nfirst native bishop of the Kentish men, died on the same day; Damian,\r\nBishop of Rochester, probably died a little before his brother of\r\nCanterbury. In the north, Tuda, recently appointed Bishop of Northumbria,\r\ndied, and Cedd, Bishop of the East Saxons, then staying at his monastery\r\nof Lastingham. The half of the East Saxons who were under the rule of the\r\nsub-king Sighere, thinking the pest a result of the anger of the ancient\r\ngods, apostatized from the faith. The differences between the two “schools\r\nof thought,” the Continental in the south of the country, and the Scotic\r\nin the north, were causing friction and inconvenience, so much so that the\r\nbishops elect of the Continental school hesitated to receive consecration\r\nfrom the bishops of the Celtic school; Wilfrid of York had at this very\r\ntime gone to seek consecration from the Frankish bishops. In this crisis,\r\nOswy, King of Northumbria, agreed with Egbert, who succeeded Earconbert in\r\nKent, to send a priest acceptable to both schools to Rome, to study things\r\nin that centre of Western Christendom, to get consecration from the Bishop\r\nof Rome, and then to return and reduce the ecclesiastical affairs of\r\nEngland to a common order. Wighard, a Kentish priest, sent in pursuance of\r\nthis wise plan, died in Rome; and, to save time, at the request of the\r\nEnglish Churches, Vitalian, the Bishop of Rome, selected Theodore of\r\nTarsus, a learned priest of the Greek Church, consecrated him, and sent\r\nhim to be archbishop of the English.\r\n\r\nWith Theodore (668-690) begins a new chapter in our history. His\r\nantecedents, as a member of the Eastern Church, eminently qualified him to\r\nlook impartially upon the two schools, the Italian and the Scotic, into\r\nwhich the religious world of England was divided, and to address himself\r\nwith broad views of ecclesiastical polity to the task of organizing the\r\nHeptarchic Churches into a harmonious province of the Catholic Church.\r\n\r\nIn 673, at the instance of Theodore, and under the presidency of Hlothere,\r\nKing of Kent, a synod was held at Hertford, attended by all the English\r\nbishops but one, and by the kings and many of the principal nobles and\r\nclergy, at which the independent national Churches agreed to unite in an\r\nEcclesiastical Province, with the Bishop of Canterbury as its\r\nmetropolitan; it was further agreed that the bishops and clergy should\r\nmeet in synod twice a year, once always in August at Clovesho, the other\r\nwas probably left to the convenience of the moment as to time and place,\r\nbut was usually held at Cealchyth. Augustine and his successors at\r\nCanterbury had never been practically more than bishops of the Kentish\r\nmen, with the titular distinction of archbishop which Gregory gave them.\r\nTheodore, says Bede, was the first archbishop whom the Churches of the\r\nEnglish obeyed. This gave Theodore the authority necessary for the\r\ncarrying out of his plans for the peace and progress of the Church.\r\n\r\nOne feature of Theodore’s policy was the breaking up of some of the larger\r\nsees. This was not done without opposition. There was much to be said in\r\nfavour of the idea of “one king one bishop;” it fell in with the political\r\norganization and it had the prestige of ancient use. But Theodore, looking\r\nat the subject from his point of view, as the ruler of an ecclesiastical\r\nprovince, saw the desirableness of breaking it up into dioceses of more\r\nmanageable size. He was opposed by Wilfrid of York, who resented the\r\ndiminution of his great position as Bishop of the Northumbrian kingdom,\r\nby the division of the diocese into four, York, Lindisfarne, Hexham, and\r\nWhithern; but his opposition was overborne by the firmness of the King of\r\nNorthumbria and the archbishop. Wilfrid carried his complaint to Rome,\r\nwhich is the first example of an appeal from the English to the Roman\r\nCourt, and raises the question of the relations of the English Church to\r\nthe Bishop of Rome. It is sufficient to say here in reference to the Roman\r\ndecision in Wilfrid’s favour on this and subsequent occasions, that\r\nneither Archbishop Theodore, nor the clergy, nor the king and thanes of\r\nthe Witan, showed any disposition to accept the intervention of the Bishop\r\nof Rome, or to defer to his judgment in the matter; and that Wilfrid was\r\npunished by the king with imprisonment and exile for his contumacy.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Mercia, backed by the king, resisted the subdivision of that\r\nvast diocese; and it was not until after Theodore’s death that his plan\r\nwas carried into effect of dividing it into four, Lichfield, Hereford,\r\nWorcester, Leicester, with Sidnacester for Lindsey, recently reconquered\r\nfrom Northumbria. It was not till 705 that the great diocese of Wessex was\r\ndivided into two, Winchester and Sherburn, and further subdivided in the\r\ntime of Alfred the Great by the erection of sees for Somerset, Wilts, and\r\nDevon. A new English see in Cornwall, on its conquest by Athelstan,\r\ncompleted the list of Saxon bishoprics.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of the Churches in synods was a very important\r\nconsequence of their organization into a province. Kings and their\r\ncouncillors and great thanes came to the synods, as well as bishops and\r\nclergy. It is probable that the laymen had no formal voice in the\r\necclesiastical legislation, but their attestation and assent would add to\r\nthe authority of the acts of the councils in the estimation of the people.\r\nThe general synods would promote the regular holding of diocesan\r\nsynods.[31] One direct result of these frequent assemblies would be to\r\ngive a stimulus to the work of the Church all over the land. Another\r\nincidental result would be to afford a stable centre of affairs, and to\r\npromote the growth of a sentiment of nationality. Political affairs were\r\nin a state of great disturbance. In some of the kingdoms rival pretenders\r\nwaged civil war, and now one, now another won the throne, while the bishop\r\nmaintained his position undisturbed. Nations warred against one another,\r\nnow Mercia reduced other kingdoms to dependence, and again Wessex asserted\r\na supremacy over others; but the synods continued to unite the bishops and\r\nclergy of the kingdoms south of the Thames in frequent consultation for\r\nthe common good.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTheodore’s idea in setting himself to divide the national bishoprics was\r\nto multiply episcopal centres of orderly Church life, adequate to the\r\nneeds of the Christian flock. The settling of priests among the scattered\r\npeople to take pastoral charge of them was a natural sequel to the former\r\nmovement. The practical way of effecting it was to induce the landowners\r\nto accept and make provision for a resident priest who should have the\r\npastoral care of their households and people.\r\n\r\nIt is not historically true that Theodore invented this idea of parochial\r\norganization, because it already existed in countries where the church had\r\nbeen longer established. Rome was virtually divided into forty parishes\r\nbefore the end of the third century. The system of appointing a priest to\r\ntake charge of all the souls within a definite district existed in the\r\ncity of Alexandria in the time of Athanasius, and in some country\r\ndistricts of Asia Minor at a very early period; it was a natural outcome\r\nof the Christian idea of the pastoral office of the ministry. The Emperor\r\nJustinian[32] had encouraged the system, by a law of 541, which decreed\r\nthat a man who should build an oratory and furnish a competent livelihood\r\nfor a priest, might present a clerk thereto, by himself and his heirs, and\r\nthe bishop finding him worthy should ordain him. To come nearer home, a\r\nSynod of Orleans, in A.D. 541, ordained that, if any one desired to have a\r\n“diocese” on his estate, he should first allot sufficient lands for the\r\nmaintenance of the church and of the clerks who should fulfil their\r\noffices there.[33] In Italy parishes were beginning to be founded in the\r\ntime of Gregory the Great. From one of his letters it appears that Anio\r\n“Comes Castri Aprutiensis,” having built a church in his castellum,\r\nwished to have it consecrated;[34] and the Bishop of Fermo had referred to\r\nGregory on the question. He allows it to be done on condition that the\r\ncount shall provide a proper endowment for a resident priest. His\r\nbusiness-like statement of what the endowment is to consist of, gives a\r\nkind of standard of what, in the circumstances of that time and in the\r\njudgment of a wise and practical bishop, was a proper endowment of a\r\ncountry parish. It was to consist of a farm with its homestead and a bed,\r\na yoke of oxen, two cows, and fifteen head of sheep, and the proper\r\nimplements of a farm, and four pounds of silver as the working capital. In\r\nanother letter Gregory bids Felix, Bishop of Messina, to consecrate a\r\nchurch built by Subdeacon Januarus in the city, on the condition that it\r\nbe properly endowed; and in this case he expressly denies the founder any\r\nrights (_e.g._ of patronage), except admission to Divine service.\r\n\r\nThe canons of the Council of Toledo, a little earlier than this, and a\r\ncapitulary in 823 of Charlemagne,[35] a little later, show that it was\r\nabout this period that country parishes, with their separate endowments\r\nand legal rights, were being founded throughout Europe.[36] Theodore knew\r\nwhat had been done in the East, and he is said to have encouraged the\r\ngreat landowners to adopt the system here. We may accept it as highly\r\nprobable that we owe to Theodore the diocesan and parochial organization\r\nof the Church of England, which provides a pastor to look after every soul\r\nin his own home, as against the previous system of monastic centres from\r\nwhich missionaries went forth for occasional ministrations, and to which\r\nthe people resorted in their spiritual needs.\r\n\r\nThe kings would be likely to set the example. They were accustomed to\r\ndivide their time among their principal estates. Aidan’s head-quarters\r\nwere at Lindisfarne, but he had also a church and chamber at Bamborough,\r\nthe chief residence of the Northumbrian kings; and, if we rightly\r\nunderstand Bede’s words,[37] he had a church and chamber at other of the\r\nprincipal houses, where the king and his court used to live for months\r\ntogether. It would be natural that the king should provide for the\r\npermanent residence of a priest to serve each of these royal chapels, for\r\nthe well-being of the people on the several royal estates; and the\r\nsubsequent history of royal free chapels confirms the conjecture that he\r\ndid so. The great landowners would be among the first to follow the king’s\r\nexample; and we find some evidence of it in an incidental notice by\r\nBede[38] of the consecration by St. John of Beverley (705-718), then\r\nBishop of Hexham, of a church at South Burton, in Yorkshire, for the\r\nEaldorman Puch, and another at North Burton, in the same county, for\r\nAddi the Ealdorman. What Puch and Addi were doing on their estates,\r\nprobably others of the great Thanes were also doing, though no marvel\r\noccurred at the consecration of these other churches to lead the historian\r\nto mention them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: House of a Saxon nobleman. The hall in the middle, the\r\nchurch on the right hand. The nobleman and his wife are distributing alms\r\nto the poor. From Harl. MS. 603.]\r\n\r\nNot only kings and nobles, but the bishops themselves, and the great\r\nmonasteries with outlying estates, would naturally make provision for the\r\nreligious interests of the people dependent upon them. In the south we\r\ngather from the canons of Clovesho, in 747, that the collegiate and\r\nconventual bodies had erected churches on their outlying estates, and that\r\nthe lands of the lay proprietors had been divided into districts by the\r\nbishops, and committed to the care of resident priests.\r\n\r\nA letter written by Bede, the most learned and most revered Churchman of\r\nthe time, to Egbert, on his consecration to the See of York, is a very\r\nvaluable piece of evidence as to the condition of the Church in the north\r\nat that point of time (734). We learn first that the discipline of the\r\nmonasteries had become lax. Many reeves had obtained land under pretext of\r\nfounding a monastery, and under that pretext claimed freedom for their\r\nland from state burdens, and called themselves abbots, but were living\r\nwith their wives and families, and servants, very much like other lay\r\nfolk, and handing down their abbeys as hereditary fees. He says that there\r\nare towns and hamlets in the most inaccessible places which are taxed for\r\nthe support of a bishop--an early notice of the general payment of\r\ntithe--but never see one, and are moreover without any resident teacher\r\nor minister--which implies that towns and hamlets in more accessible\r\nplaces have a resident minister, and are visited by a bishop for\r\nconfirmation. The venerable old man gives advice to the youthful prelate\r\nfor the mitigation of the evils which he points out. He advises him to\r\nobtain the fulfilment of the original plan of Gregory the Great, viz. the\r\nformation of the churches north of the Humber into a northern province,\r\nwith York as the metropolitan see, and to obtain the king’s leave to\r\nsubdivide the northern dioceses to the number of twelve in all, using some\r\nof the monasteries of whose decadence he complains for the new episcopal\r\nsees; he exhorts him to ordain more priests to preach and administer the\r\nsacraments in every village; and, lastly, he suggests the translation of\r\nthe Creed and Our Father out of Latin into English for the instruction of\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nEgbert followed Bede’s advice so far as to obtain his recognition as\r\narchbishop of the second province which embraced the country north of the\r\nHumber, with York as its metropolitan see; but he did not procure the\r\nsubdivision of the existing dioceses. He did, however, accomplish a great\r\nwork by raising the schools of York to such an eminence in learning and\r\nreligion that they were famous throughout Europe. The schools of Wessex,\r\nunder Aldhelm, rivalled those of Northumbria; the clergy generally could\r\nhardly fail to be influenced by the spirit of these great centres.\r\n\r\nMeantime churches were being built, and rectors of them settled upon the\r\nestates of the landowners. The seventh canon of Graetley, 928, in the\r\nreign of Athelstan, dealing with the question of penance for perjury,\r\ndirects that the parish priest, _sacerdos loci illius_, is to certify the\r\nbishop as to the penitent’s behaviour; which implies that local priests\r\nwere sufficiently widely scattered to keep in view every member of the\r\nsmall population.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Parish Priest was not merely one who ministered in spiritual things to\r\nthose who chose to accept his ministrations, he had ecclesiastical\r\njurisdiction over a definite territory and over all who dwelt within it.\r\nJust as the jurisdiction of the heptarchic bishops extended over the\r\nkingdoms, so in the parish the jurisdiction of the priest was conterminous\r\nwith the estate of the lord or thane who invited the priest to minister to\r\nhimself and his people.\r\n\r\nSome of these estates were very extensive, comprising vast tracts of\r\nforest and waste around the cultivated land, and therefore some of the\r\nparishes were of great extent. Probably the parish priest, in addition to\r\nhis work in the principal village, would also partially adopt the old\r\nsystem of itinerant mission work by visiting remote hamlets within his\r\njurisdiction at certain times for the preaching of the Word and\r\ncelebration of Divine worship. It is certain that at a very early period\r\nin the history of parishes the rector was assisted by chaplains in the\r\nmaintenance of the frequent services of the mother church and in the\r\nvisitation of the people.\r\n\r\nThus there gradually arose another class of Churches. As population\r\nincreased and forest was assarted and waste brought into cultivation, new\r\ncentres of population grew up at a distance from the original village. The\r\nSaxon laws encouraged the enterprise of the people by assigning to them a\r\nhigher rank in proportion to their possessions,[39] which involved not\r\nonly social dignity but also legal privileges; a law of Athelstan enacted\r\nthat “if a ‘ceorl’ throve so that he had fully four hides of his own land,\r\nchurch and kitchen, ‘bur geat settl,’ and special service in the king’s\r\nhall (‘sunder note’ or ‘sundor note’) then was he thenceforth of\r\nthane-right worthy.”[40]\r\n\r\nIt is in the nature of things that many of these successful ceorls would\r\nbe energetic and enterprising men who had looked out a tract of good soil\r\nin some neighbouring dale or amidst the surrounding waste, and brought it\r\nunder cultivation, and created what was virtually a new township. The\r\noccasional visits of the parish priest or his chaplain would hardly\r\nsatisfy the inhabitants of the new settlement for long. The new\r\nproprietor, in imitation of his betters, would be ambitious of having a\r\nchurch on his ground, and the law of Athelstan encouraged his laudable\r\nambition. But the customary jurisdiction and revenues of the mother\r\nChurch extending over the whole district were jealously guarded against\r\nencroachment on the part of these new foundations. A “canon of Edgar”\r\nenacts (1) that tithe be paid to the Old Minster to which the district\r\nbelongs; (2) if a thane has on his boc-land a church at which there is not\r\na burial-place, then of the nine parts let him give to his priest what he\r\nwill; and let every church scot and plough-alms go to the Old Minster. A\r\nlater law of King Canute enacts that if a thane has erected on his own\r\nboc-land (freehold or charter land) a church having a legerstowe--a\r\nburial-place--he may subtract one-third part of his tithes from the mother\r\nChurch, and bestow them upon his own clerk.[41]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Saxon Church of timber, at Greenstead, Essex.]\r\n\r\nA law of Canute incidentally describes four different classes of churches\r\nwhich, “though divinely they have like consecration,” hold a different\r\nrank and have a different penalty attached to the violation of their\r\nright of sanctuary. The classes are called: (1) the heafod mynster, chief\r\nminster; (2) the medemra mynster, translated _ecclesia mediocris_; (3) the\r\nlæssa mynster, translated _ecclesia minor_; (4) the feld-cirice, literally\r\nfield-church, where there was no burial-place. These are probably (1)\r\ncathedral or mother churches; (2) churches of ancient date with wide\r\njurisdiction; (3) smaller parish churches; (4) district or mission\r\nchapels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: West end of Greenstead Church, Essex.]\r\n\r\nThe continual increase of the population and the consequent bringing of\r\nmore land into cultivation, and the gathering of this population upon the\r\nnewly cultivated lands, caused the constant growth of new lordships or\r\ntownships, or, in later times, manors, and the constant building of new\r\nchurches to supply their spiritual wants. The jurisdiction and rights of\r\nthe mother Church had to be dealt with in all these cases; but in many\r\ncases, by agreement with the mother Church, or by the assumption of a lord\r\nof the land too powerful for its priest to withstand, or by long usage,\r\nmany of these new churches acquired the status of independent parishes;\r\nand at length, in the time of Edward the Confessor, the legal status of\r\nparish churches was given to all which by ancient custom had the right of\r\nadministration of baptism, marriage, and burial.\r\n\r\nThe Domesday Survey gives, so far as it deals with the matter, a view of\r\nthe condition of the Church and clergy at the close of the Saxon\r\nperiod--_tempore regis Edwardi_. It is to be borne in mind that its object\r\nwas not to make a complete terrier and census of the kingdom, but to\r\nascertain the rights and revenues due to the Crown. The commissioners who\r\nmade the survey in the different counties took somewhat different lines in\r\nmaking their returns, particularly in those details which are of special\r\ninterest in the present inquiry. In most of the counties churches and\r\nclergy seem to be named only where they were liable to some payment to the\r\nCrown. In some counties all the churches seem to be named; in others all\r\nthe presbyters; in others there is no mention of one or the other. Thus,\r\nin Lincolnshire 222 churches are named, in Norfolk 243, in Suffolk, 364;\r\nin Leicestershire 41 presbyters, in Rochester diocese about 65,[42] in\r\nSussex 42, of which seven are described as _ecclesiolæ_ chapels. In the\r\nreturns for the counties of Cambridge, Middlesex, Lancaster, and Cornwall,\r\nneither church nor presbyter occurs. In the whole there are only 1700\r\nchurches named. But there seems no reason why Lincolnshire, Norfolk, and\r\nSuffolk should have had a larger proportion of churches to population at\r\nthat time than the other counties; and if the other counties were\r\nproportionately subdivided into parishes and equipped with churches, we\r\narrive at the conclusion that there were nearly as many churches\r\n(including chapels) and clergy before the Norman Conquest, when the\r\npopulation was about two millions, as there were at the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century, when the population had increased to nearly nine\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Saxon tower, Sompting Church, Sussex.]\r\n\r\nFrom the same source we learn that the usual quantity of land assigned to\r\na church was from five to fifty acres; in some cases the glebe was larger.\r\nBosham, in Sussex, was one of the largest; in the time of Edward the\r\nConfessor it had 112 hides. Barsham, in Norfolk, had 100 acres;\r\nBerchingas, in Suffolk, 83; Wellingrove, in Lincolnshire, 129 acres of\r\nmeadow and 14 of other land.\r\n\r\nThe private origin of ecclesiastical benefices, together with the feudal\r\nideas of the tenure of property, produced in the minds of the owners of\r\nadvowsons a certain sense of property in the benefices which shows itself\r\nin various ways: in the bargaining with the presentee for some advantage\r\nto the lord, as a present, or a pension, or the tenancy of part of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe advowson descended with the manor, and was often subdivided among the\r\nheirs.[43] In later times we not infrequently find a rectory held in\r\nmedieties, but in Domesday Book we find a benefice divided into any number\r\nof fractions up to one-twelfth.[44]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE SAXON CLERGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sources from which we obtain the fullest details of the religious life\r\nof the Saxon priests and people are the laws of their kings and the canons\r\nof their synods; and perhaps the most convenient way of presenting the\r\ninformation which these contain will be partly to give a series of\r\nquotations from them in chronological order, with such explanations as may\r\nseem necessary; partly to group them according to their subject; using one\r\nmethod or the other as may seem best to serve our purpose.\r\n\r\nOf the earlier part of the period three codes of law have come down to\r\nus--that of Ethelbert of Kent, between 597 and 604; of Ine King of the\r\nWest Saxons, probably 690; and of Wihtred of Kent, 696. We must bear in\r\nmind that the bishops and chief clergy of the kingdom were present at the\r\nWitan of the Saxon kings, as well as the chiefs and wise men; and that the\r\nkings and chief laymen were often present at the ecclesiastical synods;\r\nso that both laws and canons express the mind of the whole people.\r\n\r\nThe laws of Ethelbert are the earliest written code of the English race.\r\nThey begin with the enactment, “If the property of God (_i.e._ of the\r\nChurch) be stolen, twelve-fold compensation shall be made; for a bishop’s\r\nproperty, eleven-fold; a priest’s, nine-fold; a deacon’s, six-fold; a\r\nclerk’s, three-fold; church frith, two-fold; minster frith, two-fold.” A\r\nlaw of Earconbert of Kent (640) commanded the destruction of the temples\r\nand idols in that kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe laws of Ine, King of the West Saxons (688-725), are said in the\r\npreamble to be made “by the consent and advice of Ceadwalla, his father,\r\nand of Heddi, his bishop, and of Earconwald, his bishop, and with all his\r\nealdormen, and the distinguished Witan of his people, and also with a\r\nlarge assembly of God’s servants (the clergy).” The first of his laws is\r\n(1) that God’s servants rightly hold their lawful rule. Then it goes on to\r\nenact (2) that children be baptized within thirty days, under a penalty of\r\n30_s._, and if one die unbaptized the father shall make bôt[45] for it\r\nwith all that he has. Then come enactments (3, 4, 5), against doing any\r\nwork on the Sunday, on the payments to be made to the clergy, and on the\r\nprivilege of sanctuary, which will be more conveniently grouped with\r\nsimilar enactments later on; (6) if a man fight in a king’s house he shall\r\nforfeit all his property; if in a minster, he shall make bôt of 120_s._;\r\n(7) if a man before a bishop belie his testimony he shall forfeit 120_s._;\r\n(61) church scot shall be paid according to where a man’s roof and hearth\r\nare at midwinter; (76) inflicts a special fine for slaying a godson or\r\ngodfather--if it be a bishop’s son,[46] it is to be half the amount.\r\n\r\nThe preamble to the laws of Wihtred of Kent, in 696, states that they were\r\nmade at “a deliberative convention of the great men,” the Archbishop\r\nBirhtwald and Bishop Gebmund of Rochester being present, “and every degree\r\nof the Church of that province spoke in unison with the obedient people.”\r\nThe first law (1) gives the Church freedom in jurisdiction and revenue;\r\n(6) a priest guilty of misconduct or negligence to be suspended till the\r\ndoom of the bishop; (9, 10, 11) on the observance of Sunday, are the same\r\nas in the laws of King Ine, quoted p. 79; (12, 13) seek to suppress the\r\nold heathenism by imposing on a man forfeiture of all his substance for\r\nmaking offerings to devils, and the same on his wife if she shared in his\r\noffence; a theowe for the same offence is to forfeit 6_s._ or “pay with\r\nhis skin;”[47] (14, 15) impose penalties for not abstaining from flesh on\r\nfasting days; (16, 17) relate to the value of the oaths of various classes\r\nof people, and are dealt with at p. 77. One of the most important laws of\r\nWihtred is that which is called “the privilege of Wihtred,” given at a\r\nWitan held at Bapchild, attended by the king and nobles, as well as by the\r\ntwo bishops and clergy, which released the lands of monasteries from gabel\r\nor land-tax, and obliged the tenants only to attend the king in war and to\r\npay burgh bôt and brig bôt, _i.e._ payments levied for the repair of\r\ntown-walls and bridges. This privilege was confirmed in the first year of\r\nKing Ethelbald of Mercia at the Council of Clovesho (716). It was granted\r\nby other Saxon kings also in their charters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe decrees of a council at Clovesho, in 747, require a few words of\r\npreface. In 745 Boniface, “the Apostle of Germany,” had presided at a\r\nsynod of Frank bishops, at Augsburg,[48] which had made canons for the\r\nreform of abuses, and had formally accepted the supremacy of Rome.\r\nBoniface sent a copy of these canons to his friend Cuthbert, Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, clearly wishing him to take like measures.\r\n\r\nThe first canon of this Synod enacted that metropolitans should be obliged\r\nto apply to Rome for their pall, and obey the orders of St. Peter in\r\neverything according to the canons. Another canon to the same end decreed\r\nthat if the people refuse to submit to the discipline of the Church, the\r\nbishops shall appeal to the archbishop of the province, and the archbishop\r\nto the Pope.\r\n\r\nTwo years afterwards Zacharias, Bishop of Rome, sent letters by the hands\r\nof two legates “to the English inhabitants of Britain,” in which he\r\nadmonishes them to reform their lives, and holds out threats of\r\nexcommunication against those who neglect to do so.[49]\r\n\r\nThe Pope’s action was clearly intended to induce the English Church to\r\nimitate the submission of the Frankish Church. A synod was assembled at\r\nClovesho, A.D. 747, attended by twelve English bishops of the dioceses\r\nsouth of the Humber and a number of their clergy, and by Ethelbald, King\r\nof the Mercians, who was over lord of all the English kingdoms south of\r\nthe Humber. The Pope’s letter was read in Latin and English, and then the\r\nsynod proceeded to draw up a number of canons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Saxon bishop and priest. (From Cotton MS., Claudius, B.\r\niv.)]\r\n\r\nThe omissions, compared with the canons of the German Council, are the\r\nmost important part of the document. The first canon decreed that every\r\nbishop should be careful to support his character (_i.e._ his status as a\r\nbishop), execute every part of his office, and maintain the canons and\r\nconstitutions of the Church against encroachment; and the second that the\r\nbishops and clergy should be careful to keep a good correspondence with\r\neach other, without any flattering applications to any person, considering\r\nthat they are the servants of one master, and entrusted with the same\r\ncommission; and, therefore, though they are divided by distance of place\r\nand country, they ought to be united by affection and pray for each other\r\nthat every one may discharge his office with integrity and conscience.\r\nThen there follow disciplinary canons: (3) that the clergy should call\r\ntogether the people of all ranks and degrees in each place, preach to them\r\nthe word of God, and forbid them to follow the heathen customs; (2) that\r\nthe bishops should visit their dioceses every year; (4, 5, and 7) relate\r\nto monasteries; (6) bishops not to ordain priests without examination as\r\nto learning and morals; (8) priests to abstract themselves from worldly\r\naffairs and give themselves to reading, prayer, etc.; (9) to preach,\r\nbaptize, and inspect the morals of the people in those precincts and\r\ndistricts assigned to them by their bishops--which implies the existence\r\nof subdivisions of dioceses into various jurisdictions, and the existence\r\nof parishes; (10) priests to be thoroughly acquainted with the doctrines\r\nand services of the church, to teach the Creed and Lord’s Prayer, and\r\nexplain the sacraments; (11) to be uniform in their preaching and\r\nministration; (12) regulates church music and ceremonies, canons not to\r\nintrude upon things which belong to the bishop; (13, 14, 15, 16, 18) on\r\nthe observance of Sundays, holy days, the seven hours of prayer,\r\nrogations, and ember days; (17) appoints that the days on which St.\r\nGregory and St. Augustine died shall be kept as holy days, and their names\r\nbe included in the litanies.\r\n\r\nCanons (21) and (22) enjoin on the clergy sobriety and propriety of\r\nconduct, and ever-fitness for celebration and reception of Holy Communion.\r\n(26) enjoins the bishops to convene their clergy and abbots, and\r\ncommunicate to them the decisions of the council, and command their\r\nobservance; and if there is any disorder too strong for the bishop’s\r\ncorrection, he is to report it to the archbishop at the next meeting of\r\nthe synod--but not a word of a reference beyond him to the Pope. (27) is\r\non the singing of the psalms with recollection and pious dispositions and\r\nposture of respect, and of prayers--and among them of prayers for the\r\ndeparted;[50] and those who do not understand Latin are to pray in the\r\nvulgar tongue.\r\n\r\n(26) and (27) are specially notable as directed against what seem to have\r\nbeen growing errors; they explain that alms are not to be given to commute\r\npenance and dispense with the discipline of the Church, and so procure a\r\nliberty of sinning; that those who think that God can be bribed thus, make\r\ntheir alms useless to them, and add to their guilt. Also that it is folly\r\nand presumption to think that a man condemned to penance may procure\r\nothers to fast, say psalms, and distribute charity on his behalf; that if\r\na man may thus buy his punishment and get others to repent for him, a rich\r\nman would be sure of salvation, and only the poor be in danger. The last\r\ncanon enjoins that kings and princes and the whole body of the people be\r\npublicly prayed for in church.[51]\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that the Northumbrian king was not present with his\r\nnobles and bishops at this synod; for eleven years previously (in 736) the\r\nBishop of York had obtained the dignity of an archbishop with the\r\nNorthumbrian churches as his province. The Papal legates visited the\r\nnorth, but we have no account of their doings there.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe laws of King Alfred are prefaced by a recapitulation of the early\r\nhistory of the Church, and recite the decree of the apostles at the Synod\r\nof Jerusalem. Then the king goes on to say that many synods were assembled\r\nin the old times, among the English race, after they had received the\r\nFaith of Christ, and ordained a “tort” for many misdeeds. Out of those\r\nlaws which he had met with, either of the days of Ine his kinsman, of\r\nOffa, King of the Mercians, or of Ethelbryht who first among the English\r\nrace received baptism, the things which seemed to him most right he had\r\ngathered together and rejected others. He had then showed them to the\r\nwitan, and they declared that it seemed good to them all that they should\r\nbe observed. We conclude that the codes of Ethelbert, Ine, and Offa (which\r\nlast has not come down to us) were the principal codes then known. We\r\nselect several of the laws of Alfred which deal with new matter.\r\n\r\n1. If a man pledge himself and break his pledge, he is to surrender his\r\nweapons and goods to the keeping of his friends, and be in prison forty\r\ndays in a bishop’s town, and suffer there whatever the bishop may\r\nprescribe; his friends to find him food; if he have none, then the king’s\r\nreeve to do it; if he escape, to be excommunicated of all Christ’s\r\nchurches. If a man seek a church and confess an offence not before known,\r\nlet it be half forgiven--_i.e._ let him pay half the penalty.\r\n\r\nOne of the laws agreed upon between King Alfred and Guthrum was, if any\r\nman wrong an ecclesiastic or a foreigner as to money or life, the king or\r\nearl and the bishop shall be to the injured in the place of kinsman and\r\nprotector.\r\n\r\nAmong the laws of Athelstan (925-940), (3) directs that there be sung,\r\nevery Friday at every monastery, a fifty (of psalms) for the king, and for\r\nall who will what he wills, and for others as they may merit; (7)\r\ndescribes the ordeal by fire and by water.[52]\r\n\r\nAmong the laws of King Edmund (940-946) made at the Synod of London,\r\n“Odda, archbishop, and Wulfstan, archbishop, and many other bishops being\r\npresent,” it was ordered (1) that those in holy orders who have to teach\r\nGod’s people by their life’s example keep their chastity according to\r\ntheir degree; (5) that every bishop repair the houses of God in his\r\n[district (?)], and also remind the king that all God’s churches be well\r\nconditioned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe “Canons of Edgar” (A.D. 959-975)[53] were made under the reforming\r\ninfluence of Archbishop Dunstan, and were intended as a standard of life\r\nand duty for the clergy. They begin with the recognition, which is\r\namplified and emphasized in the laws of subsequent reigns, that the great\r\nduty which the order of the clergy perform in the service of the nation is\r\nto celebrate the worship of Almighty God, and offer up prayers on behalf\r\nof the king and people. We give the substance of the canons as briefly as\r\npossible, but without any material omission, so that the reader may feel\r\nassured that he has the whole body of the legislation before him.\r\n\r\nThey decree that the ministers of God devoutly serve and minister to God,\r\nand intercede for all Christian folk; be faithful and obedient to their\r\nseniors (bishops, abbots, etc.); ready to help others, both Godward and\r\nmanward; and be to their earthly lords true and faithful; that they honour\r\none another, the juniors diligently hearing and loving their seniors, and\r\nthe seniors diligently teaching the juniors.\r\n\r\nThat every one come to the synod yearly, attended by his clerk, and an\r\norderly man as his servant; that he bring his books and vestments,[54] and\r\nink and parchment for the constitutions;[55] and food for three days. That\r\nthe priest report to the synod if any one has done him any serious injury,\r\nand that all should regard it as done to themselves, and obtain\r\ncompensation according as the bishop shall determine. He shall also report\r\nif any one in his parish lives openly against God, or has done mortal\r\nsin, whom he cannot move to amendment, or dare not for fear.\r\n\r\nThat no dispute between priests shall be brought before secular judges,\r\nbut reconciled by their fellows or referred to the bishop; no priest shall\r\ndesert the church to which he was ordained, but hold to it as his lawful\r\nspouse. That he do not deprive another of anything which belongs to him\r\neither in his church or parish or gildship; he shall not take another’s\r\nscholar without his leave; that in addition to lore, he diligently learn a\r\nhandicraft; that the learned priest do not throw scorn on the half\r\nlearned, but correct him; that the well-born priest do not despise the\r\nlow-born, for if he will consider all men are of one birth; that he\r\nadminister baptism as soon as asked, and bid every one to bring his\r\nchildren to be baptized within thirty-seven days[56] of their birth and\r\nnot defer too long to have them confirmed by the bishop.\r\n\r\nThat he diligently promote Christianity, and banish heathenism, and forbid\r\nwell-worship, necromancy, augury, man-worship, incantations, and many\r\nthings which they practise with various spells, and “frithsplottum,”[57]\r\nand wich-elms and various trees and stones, and other phantasms by which\r\nmany are deceived, and that devil’s craft whereby children are drawn\r\nthrough the earth, and the merriment that men make on the night of the\r\nyear (New Year’s Eve).\r\n\r\nThat every Christian diligently train his child and teach him the\r\nPaternoster and Credo;[58] that on festivals men abstain from profane\r\nsongs and devil’s games, and on Sundays from trading and folk motes; that\r\nmen cease from lies and foolish talking and blasphemy; and from\r\nconcubinage, and have lawful wives; that every man learn the Paternoster\r\nand Credo if he desire to lie in holy ground [at his burial], and be\r\nconsidered housel-worthy [fit to receive Holy Communion], because he is\r\nnot a good Christian who is not willing to learn these, nor may rightly be\r\na sponsor at baptism nor at confirmation; that there be no contentions on\r\nfestival or fasting days, nor oaths, nor ordeals.\r\n\r\nThat the priests keep the churches with all reverence for the Divine\r\nministry and pure worship, and for nothing else; nor do anything\r\nunbecoming there nor in the vicinity; nor allow idle talking, idle deeds,\r\nunbecoming drinkings, nor any other idle practices; nor allow dogs in the\r\nchurchyard, nor more swine than a man is able to manage [or no dog nor\r\nswine so far as a man can prevent it], that nothing unbecoming be placed\r\nin the church; that at the church-wake men keep sober and pray diligently,\r\nnor practise drinking, nor anything else unbecoming; that no one be buried\r\nin church unless he was known when living to be so well pleasing to God as\r\nto be worthy of it.\r\n\r\nThat the priest do not celebrate the Eucharist in any house, but only in\r\nthe church, except in case of extreme sickness, and do not consecrate\r\nexcept upon a consecrated altar,[59] and not without book and the canon of\r\nthe mass before his eyes, that he make no mistakes, and that he have a\r\ncorporal when he celebrates, and a _subuculum_[60] under his albe, and all\r\nnecessary things rightly appointed, and have a good and correct book, and\r\nnot without some one to make the responses; that every one receive fasting\r\nexcept in case of extreme sickness; that the priest reserve the host ready\r\nfor any that need; that he celebrate with pure wine and pure water; that\r\nno priest celebrate mass without partaking, or hallow it unless he is\r\nholy. That the chalice be of molten material, never of wood; that all\r\nthings which approach the altar or belong to the church be purely and\r\nworthily appointed, and that there be always lights in the church at mass;\r\nthat there be no negligence about anything consecrated, holy water, salt,\r\nincense, bread, nor anything holy; that no woman come near the altar while\r\nthe priest celebrates.\r\n\r\nThat at the right times the bell be rung, and the priest say his hours in\r\nchurch, or there pray and intercede for all men.[61] That no priest come\r\ninto the church or into his stall without his upper garment, or minister\r\nwithout his vestment. That no man in orders conceal his tonsure, or leave\r\nit badly shaven, or wear his beard long; that priests be not ignorant of\r\nfasts or festivals, lest they lead the people wrong.[62]\r\n\r\nThat every one accompany his fasts with almsgiving; that “priests in\r\necclesiastical ministries be all on one equality, and in a year’s space,\r\nbe like-worthy in all ecclesiastical ministries;”[63] that they diligently\r\nteach the young handicrafts, that the Church may be helped thereby.\r\n\r\nThat priests preach every Sunday, and well explain. That no Christian eat\r\nblood of any kind. That they teach the people to pay their dues to God,\r\nplough-alms fifteen days after Easter, the tithe of young at Pentecost,\r\nfruits of the earth at All Saints, Peter’s penny on St. Peter’s day, and\r\nchurch scot at Martinmas. That priests so distribute people’s alms as to\r\nplease God, and dispose the people to almsgiving; they shall sing psalms\r\nwhen they distribute alms, and bid the poor pray for the people. That\r\npriests avoid drunkenness, and warn the people against it; that they\r\neschew unbecoming occupations, as ale-scop or glee man, but behave\r\ndiscreetly and worthily; abstain from oaths and forbid them; not consort\r\ntoo much with women, but love their own spouse, that is, their church; not\r\nbear false witness, or be the confidant of thieves; that the priest have\r\nnot to do with ordeals or oaths, or be compurgator with a thane, unless\r\nthe thane take the first oath; be not a hunter, or hawker, or dicer, but\r\noccupy himself with his books, as becomes his order.\r\n\r\nThat every priest hear confession and give penance, and carry the\r\nEucharist to the sick, and anoint him if he desire it, and after death not\r\nallow any idle customs about the body, but bury it decently in the fear of\r\nGod. That every priest have oil for baptism, and also for anointing the\r\nsick. Let him promote Christianity in every way, as well by preaching as\r\nby good example, and he shall be rewarded by God Almighty; and let him\r\nremember when he fetches the chrism [at the yearly synod] to say the\r\nprayers for the king and the bishop.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe laws of King Ethelred (979-1016), made with the counsel of both the\r\necclesiastical and lay witan, are conceived in a very Christian spirit,\r\nand expressed with considerable eloquence. We think it worth while to give\r\nin full some of them which relate to the general desire of the authorities\r\nin Church and State to promote religion. (1) This, then, is first, that we\r\nall love and worship one God, and zealously hold one Christianity, and\r\nevery heathenship totally cast out, that every man be regarded as entitled\r\nto right, and peace and friendship be lawfully observed. (2) That\r\nChristian men and uncondemned be not sold out of the country, and\r\nespecially into a heathen nation, that those souls perish not that Christ\r\nbought with His own life. (3) That Christian men be not condemned to death\r\nfor all too little, and in general let light punishments be decreed, and\r\nlet not for a little God’s handiwork and His own purchase which He dearly\r\nbought be destroyed. (4) That every man of every order readily submit to\r\nthe law which belongs to him; above all, let the servants of God, bishops\r\nand abbots, monks and mynchens, priests and nuns,[64] live according to\r\ntheir rule, and fervently intercede for all Christian people. (5, 6) Monks\r\nare not to live out of minster, but to observe specially three things:\r\ntheir chastity and monkish customs, and the service of the Lord. (7)\r\nCanons, where their benefice is, so that they have a refectory and\r\ndormitory, are to keep their minster rightly; and mass-priests to keep\r\nthemselves from the anger of God. (9) Full well they know that they have\r\nnot rightly, through concubinage, intercourse with women; he who will\r\nabstain from this and serve God rightly, shall be worthy of thane-wēr, and\r\nthane-right both in life and in the grave; he who will not, let his honour\r\nwane before God and before the world. (10) Let every church be in grith\r\n(protection) of God and the king, and of all Christian people; let no man\r\nhenceforth reduce a church to servitude, nor unlawfully make\r\nchurch-mongering, nor turn out a church minister without the bishop’s\r\ncounsel. (11) God’s dues are to be willingly paid, plough-alms, tithe of\r\nyoung, earth fruits, Rome fee, and light scot thrice a year,[65] and soul\r\nscot at the open grave, or, if buried elsewhere, to be paid to the minster\r\nto which it belongs. (13-19) Sundays and holy days are defined as in\r\nprevious laws, and at those holy tides let there be to all men peace and\r\nconcord, and be every strife appeased. (22) Let every Christian man\r\nstrictly keep his Christianity, and go frequently to shrift and housel.\r\n(23) Let every injustice and wrong-doing be carefully cast out of the\r\ncountry, and (26) God’s laws be zealously loved by word and deed, then\r\nwill God soon be merciful to this nation.[66] Lastly (34), it is the duty\r\nof us all to love and worship one God and strictly hold one Christianity,\r\nand totally cast out every kind of heathenism; and (35) let us faithfully\r\nsupport one royal lord, and all defend life and land together as best we\r\nmay, and to God Almighty pray with inward heart.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe canons which go under the name of Elfric, and are of the end of the\r\ntenth century, add a little to the knowledge we have already gleaned. The\r\n10th canon gives a list of the seven orders of the clergy under the degree\r\nof bishop, viz. ostiarius, lector, exorcist, acolyte, subdeacon, deacon,\r\nand priest, and defines their several offices. (17) reckons a priest and a\r\nbishop to be of the same order. (19) requires the priests and inferior\r\nclergy to be at church at the seven canonical hours: _Uhtsang_ (Prime)\r\nabout 4 a.m., _Primsang_ (Matins) 6 a.m., _Undersang_ (Terce) at 9,\r\n_Middaysang_ (Sext) at noon, _Nonsang_ (Nones) at 3 p.m., _Æfensang_\r\n(Vespers), and _Nightsang_ (Nocturns). (21) Every priest before ordination\r\nto be furnished with correct copies of the Psalter, Book of Epistles and\r\nGospels, Missal, Hymnary, Penitential, and Lectionary. (23) The parish\r\npriest, every Sunday and holy day, is to explain to the people in English\r\nthe Lord’s Prayer, the Creed, and the Gospel for the day. (25) Not to\r\ncelebrate in a house except one be sick. (27) No priest is to take money\r\nfor baptism or other office. (28) Priests are not to remove from one\r\nparish to another for the sake of advantage, but to remain in the cure to\r\nwhich they were ordained. (29) Not to turn merchant, soldier, or lawyer.\r\n(30) To have always two oils, one for children, the other for the sick.\r\n(33) Orders the canons of the first four councils to be regarded like the\r\nfour Gospels; “there have been many councils held in later ages, but these\r\nfour are of the greatest authority.” (36) “The housel is Christ’s body,\r\nnot bodily but spiritually, not the body in which He suffered, but the\r\nbody about which He spake, when He blessed bread and wine for housel....\r\nUnderstand now that the Lord who could before His passion change the bread\r\nto His body and the wine to His blood spiritually, that the same daily\r\nblesses, by the hands of His priests, the bread and wine to His spiritual\r\nbody and blood.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn important feature in the administration of criminal law was the\r\nrecognition of the right of _Sanctuary_ to the house of the king and the\r\nchurches, which had probably been introduced from the imperial law by the\r\ninfluence of the missionaries. The laws of Ine recognize the right of\r\nsanctuary to a church; a murderer taking sanctuary is to have his life\r\nbut to make bôt, according to law, a theowe who has incurred scourging\r\nshall be excused the penalty.\r\n\r\nThe laws of Alfred allow three days’ sanctuary in the “mynsterham,” which\r\nis free from the king’s farm, or any other free community, with a bôt of\r\n120_s._ for its violation, to be paid to the brotherhood; and seven days\r\nin every church hallowed by the bishop, with the penalty of the king’s\r\n“mund and byrd” and the church’s “frith” for its violation. The Church\r\nealdor is to take care that no one give food to the refugee. If he be\r\nwilling to give up his weapons to his foes, then let them keep him thirty\r\ndays, and give notice to his kinsmen (that they may arrange the legal\r\nbôt[67]). King Athelstan’s laws further modify the right of sanctuary; a\r\nthief or robber fleeing to the king or to any church, or to the bishop, is\r\nto have a term of nine days; if he flee to an ealdorman, or an abbot, or a\r\nthane, three days; and he who harbours him longer is to be worthy of the\r\nsame penalty as the thief. The king’s grith (protection) is to extend from\r\nhis burhgate where he is dwelling, on its four sides three miles three\r\nfurlongs and three acres breadth, and nine feet nine palms and nine\r\nbarley-corns. A law of Canute already quoted (p. 53) assigns different\r\nvalues of grith (protection) to the different kinds of churches, the grith\r\nbryce (penalty for violation of grith) of a chief minster is £5; of a\r\nminster of the middle class, 120_s._, and of one yet less where there is a\r\nsmall parish (lytel þeoþðom, in the laws of Henry I.), provided there be a\r\nburial-place, 60_s._, and of a field-church, where there is no\r\nburial-place, 30_s._\r\n\r\nAkin to this privilege of sanctuary is the penalty for acts of violence in\r\ncertain places and before certain persons. By the laws of King Ine, if any\r\nman fight in a king’s house he shall forfeit all his property; if in a\r\nminster, make bôt of 120_s._ By the laws of King Alfred, if a man fight or\r\ndraw his weapon before an archbishop he shall make bôt of 150_s._; if\r\nbefore a bishop or an ealdorman, 100_s._ The laws of Alfred enact that if\r\nany man steal from a church he shall restore it and lose his hand, or\r\nredeem his hand at the amount of his “wergild;” it is to be remembered\r\nthat churches were used as places of deposit for valuables, and the law\r\nprobably is intended to protect these as well as the movables belonging to\r\nthe church itself.\r\n\r\nThe laws of Wihtred of Kent make the word of a king or a bishop\r\nincontrovertible without an oath; a priest, like a king’s thane, is to\r\nclear himself with his own oath at the altar; he is to stand before the\r\naltar in his vestments, and laying his hand upon the altar, to say,\r\n“_Veritatem dico in Christo, non mentior_;”[68] the superior of a\r\nmonastery is to make oath like a priest; a clerk, like a “ceorlish man,”\r\nto make like oath at the altar, but to have four compurgators. The rank of\r\na priest as equal to that of a thane is frequently recognized.[69] The\r\nlaws of Ine (15 and 19), make the oath of a man who is a communicant worth\r\ntwice as much as that of a man who is not.\r\n\r\nIt is convenient to gather into one view what the laws say about the\r\n_Tithe and other Payments_ which the people made to the church. The laws\r\ndid not then for the first time enact these payments. The first\r\nmissionaries had no doubt taught the people that it was the duty of\r\nChristian men to maintain the church and the clergy by tithes and\r\nofferings. If the assertion be true that the people had been accustomed to\r\npay tithe to their heathen priests, and there is evidence in favour of the\r\nprobability, then it came the easier to them.[70] The kings and their\r\nwitans, in this as in many other matters, recognized and gave the sanction\r\nof law to existing custom. The payment of tithe was recognized as\r\nobligatory in the Legatine Council of Cealchythe in 785, which being\r\nattended and confirmed by the Kings of Kent, Mercia, Wessex, and\r\nNorthumbria, and their ealdormen, had the authority of a Witenagemot, just\r\nat the time that similar measures were being taken in the Frank dominions.\r\nFrom that time the payment was frequently mentioned in the laws. The laws\r\nof King Alfred define the tithe as of “moving and growing things.” The\r\nlaws of King Edmund enact that every man pay tithe, church scot, Rome fee,\r\nand plough-alms on pain of excommunication. The laws of Edgar define to\r\nwhom the payment shall be made, viz. to the old minster to which the\r\ndistrict belongs; a thane who has a church at which there is a\r\nburial-place, may pay a third of his tithe to his own priest; if the\r\nthane’s church is without a burial-place, he is to pay his tithe to the\r\nminster, and church scot and plough-alms are also to be paid to the\r\nminster, and the thane may pay to his priest what he will. They also\r\nrecite the times at which these payments are to be made on penalty of the\r\nfull “wite” (fine to the king) which the Doom-book specifies. They also\r\nprescribe a process for the recovery of tithe; the king’s reeve and the\r\nbishop’s reeve, with the priest of the minster to whom it is due, are to\r\ntake the tithe by force, and the rest is to be forfeited half to the king\r\nand half to the bishop, whether the defaulter be a king’s man or a\r\nthane’s. The payment of the “hearth penny” (St. Peter’s penny) is to be\r\nenforced by a very curious process: the defaulter is to be taken to\r\nRome--perhaps it means to the house of the pope’s agent, for the\r\ncollection of Peter pence--and, in addition to what is due, is to pay\r\n30_d._, and bring a certificate of the payment, and then is to forfeit\r\n120_s._ to the king; if he refuse, he is to be taken again to Rome, and on\r\nhis return to forfeit 200_s._; and if he still refuse, he is to forfeit\r\nall that he has. The severity of the enactment suggests the question\r\nwhether there was at that time on the part of some persons a special\r\nunwillingness to pay the “penny of St. Peter.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _religious observance of Sunday_ was the subject of frequent\r\nenactments. The third of the laws of Ine enacts that if a theow work on\r\nSunday by his lord’s command, the theow shall be exempt from penalty, but\r\nhis lord shall pay 30_s._; if the theow work of his own accord (since he\r\nhas no money), he shall “pay with his skin,” _i.e._ shall be scourged. If\r\na free man work on that day without his lord’s command, he shall forfeit\r\nhis freedom or pay 60_s._; a priest offending shall be liable to a double\r\npenalty. The laws of Wihtred of Kent contain enactments to the same\r\neffect. The laws of Alfred encourage the observance of other holy days by\r\nthe enactment that “to all free men these days be given” (_i.e._ free men\r\nare not to be required by their lords to work on these days): twelve days\r\nat the Nativity, Good Friday--“the day on which Christ conquered the\r\ndevil,” St. Gregory’s day, seven days before Easter and seven days after,\r\nSt. Peter’s day and St. Paul’s day, in autumn a full week before the\r\nfestival of St. Brice (Nov. 13), one day before All Saints, and the four\r\nWednesdays in the four fasting (Ember) weeks. The law does not free\r\ntheowes from work on these days, but suggests to their masters to give\r\nthem, in God’s name, such relaxation from work on such of these days as\r\nthey shall deserve. The laws of Edgar define that Sunday is to be kept\r\nfrom noontide of Saturday till dawn of Monday. At the Council of Eynsham\r\n(1009), it was further enjoined that there be no markets or folk motes\r\n(the laws of Canute also forbid hunting) on Sundays; that all St. Mary’s\r\nfeast tides be honoured with those of every apostle, and Fridays be kept\r\nas a fast. Festivals of English saints were from time to time added to the\r\nKalendar. We have seen that the Council of Clovesho (747), decreed the\r\nobservance of days in honour of St. Gregory and St. Augustine. In the\r\ndecrees of the Council of Enysham we find: “The witan have chosen that St.\r\nEdward’s mass day shall be celebrated all over England on the XV. Kal.\r\nApr.” (March 18). The laws of Canute repeat the obligation of the previous\r\nholy days, and after mention of the witan’s appointment of a festival of\r\nSt. Edward, add a festival of St. Dunstan on XIV. Kal. Junias (May 19).\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Slavery_ was a recognized institution of the society of those times. The\r\nclass of “theowmen” was probably made up partly of conquered Britons and\r\ntheir descendants, partly of captives taken in the mutual wars of the\r\nheptarchic kingdoms, partly of freemen who had been condemned to this\r\npenalty for their crimes or incurred it by poverty. A prominent feature of\r\nthe influence of Christianity was the encouragement it gave to masters to\r\ntreat their theowes with kindness, and its success in promoting their\r\nmanumission as an action well-pleasing to God. Several of the codes of law\r\ndeal with the subject. We have seen already how the legislation on the\r\nobservance of Sundays and holy days did not go so far as to interfere with\r\nthe right of the masters, but did invite them, for the love of God, to\r\ngive their theowes some relaxation of labour on the great festivals of the\r\nChurch. A law of Wihtred, King of Kent, defines that if any one give\r\nfreedom to his man at the altar, he shall be folk-free, though it retains\r\nto the freedom-giver the heritage and wergild and mund of his family. A\r\nlaw of Ine enacts that he who sells over sea his own countryman, bond or\r\nfree, though he be guilty, shall pay according to his wēr.\r\n\r\nA law of Alfred enacts that if any man buy a Christian slave, he shall\r\nserve for six years, and on the seventh he shall go out as he came in,\r\nwith the same clothes, etc.; if he came in with a wife he shall go out\r\nwith her, but if the lord have given him a wife, she and her children\r\nshall still belong to the lord. A law of Ethelred (978-1016) enacts that a\r\nslave (uncondemned) shall not be sold out of the country.\r\n\r\nThe Church set the example of the manumission of its slaves.[71] At the\r\nCouncil of Cealchithe (816) it was unanimously agreed that each prelate at\r\nhis death should bequeath one-tenth of his personal property to the poor,\r\nand set at liberty all bondsmen of English descent whom his Church had\r\nacquired during his administration, and that each bishop and abbot who\r\nsurvived him should manumit three of his slaves, and give 3_s._ to each.\r\nThe laity followed the example. In the English wills published by\r\nThorpe[72] a considerable number occur in which the testator gives freedom\r\nto serfs, _e.g._ Queen Æthelflæd sets free half of her men in every vill;\r\nWynflæd gives a long list of serfs by name who are to be freed, and the\r\nfreedom of penal serfs is given in nine other wills.\r\n\r\nStill the institution continued. At the end of the Saxon period, a\r\nthriving trade in the export of English slaves was carried on at Bristol,\r\ntill Bishop Wulstan put an end to it. The Twenty-ninth Canon of the Synod\r\nof Westminster, held under Anselm in 1102, enacted that there should be no\r\nbuying and selling of men in England as heretofore, as if they were kine\r\nor oxen. But this did not put a stop to it. Slaves were bought and sold by\r\nChurch dignitaries as late as the fourteenth century, as we shall see in a\r\nlater chapter, and the status of serfdom continued to the sixteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coronation of Harold by Archbishop Stigand. Bayeux\r\ntapestry.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE NORMAN CONQUEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne immediate result of the Norman conquest was that Archbishop Stigand\r\nand several other bishops and abbots were ejected, and foreign\r\necclesiastics put in their place. It is not necessary to suppose that\r\nWilliam acted solely on the desire to put men devoted to his interests\r\ninto these positions of power and influence, for Edward the Confessor had\r\nalready appointed some foreign bishops with the object of raising the tone\r\nof learning and religion in the English Church; and all William’s nominees\r\nwere men of character, learning and practical ability. The removal of some\r\nof the sees from unimportant villages to the principal town of the diocese\r\nwas a wise measure. It is said that some of the Norman bishops desired to\r\nmake the further improvement of replacing the monks, where they existed,\r\nin their cathedrals, by canons, but were thwarted by Lanfranc.[73]\r\n\r\nThe parochial clergy seem to have been left undisturbed in their\r\nbenefices; only, as the benefices fell vacant in the usual course of\r\nthings, the new Norman lords of the manor, who had in so many cases\r\nsupplanted the old Saxon thanes, not unnaturally appointed relatives or\r\ncountrymen of their own to at least the more valuable of the parochial\r\nbenefices in their gift.\r\n\r\nThe Norman conquest of England opened up this country more fully to the\r\ninfluence of the political and religious life of the Continent. The\r\npatriarchal authority of the Roman see had long since been acknowledged by\r\nthe Saxon Church, but hitherto had very rarely intervened and as seldom\r\nbeen appealed to; henceforward it was to become a much more important\r\nfactor both in the political and ecclesiastical life of this country. The\r\nforeign bishops appointed by Edward the Confessor and William, and the\r\nforeign parsons introduced by the new lords into their parishes, brought\r\nwith them the Hildebrandine theories of the relations of the Pope to the\r\nChurch and to the State. William sought to limit the exercise of the Papal\r\nauthority in his new kingdom by a decree that the Pope should send no\r\nlegates and no bulls without the consent of the Crown, and that his own\r\nsubjects should make no appeal to Rome without the Crown’s permission.\r\nBut, in fact, a considerable change gradually took place in the practical\r\nrelations of the English Church to the Roman see. The Saxon Church had\r\nbeen isolated, the bishops and clergy had been eminently a national\r\nclergy, with practically no one above them and no one between them and\r\ntheir flocks. The appearance of two legates at the synod of Winchester\r\n(1070), which deprived Stigand the archbishop, and, by consequence,\r\nseveral bishops of his consecration, was the beginning of a series of very\r\nimportant interventions of the Pope for good and for evil, which, together\r\nwith the multiplication of appeals to Rome, modified very much the\r\nprevious practically autonomous condition of the English Church. Another\r\nimportant change was made by the separation of the civil and\r\necclesiastical Courts determined upon by William “in the common council,\r\nand by the advice of all the bishops and abbots, and all the princes of\r\nhis kingdom.” It abrogated the old Saxon custom set forth in the laws of\r\nCanute (1016-1035),[74] that the bishop should sit with the sheriff in the\r\nshire mote, and assist in the administration of justice and the\r\ndetermination of causes; and enacted that, for the future, civil causes\r\nshould be determined by the secular judge; while, on the other hand, no\r\nlay judge should interfere in the laws which belong to the bishop, or in\r\nany causes which belong to the cure of souls. The results went further\r\nthan perhaps William had foreseen. One result was the setting up of\r\nindependent courts of ecclesiastical jurisdiction over all clerical\r\npersons, down to the lowest of the men in minor orders, and in all\r\nreligious cases, including matrimonial and testamentary causes and\r\nquestions of oaths. This made the whole body of the clergy a privileged\r\nclass under a law and judges of their own, and this privilege the Church\r\nmaintained successfully against the endeavour of Henry II. to bring the\r\nclergy under the jurisdiction of the King’s Courts, and continued down to\r\nthe “submission of the clergy” in the reign of Henry VIII. With this brief\r\ngeneral review of the constitutional changes effected at the time of the\r\nNorman Conquest we proceed to our more humble task of noting the history\r\nof the parochial clergy and of their flocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Durham Cathedral.]\r\n\r\nThe new men, military adventurers though they were, among whom the Norman\r\nconqueror had divided the lands of England, did not, like the Anglo-Saxon\r\nconquerors, trample out Christianity under their feet; nor, like the Danes\r\nin their turn, plunder the monasteries and churches; on the contrary, the\r\nNormans behaved like Christian men who, having come into power in a\r\ncountry which was in a backward religious condition, set themselves to\r\neffect religious improvements in their newly acquired possessions. Every\r\nbishop set to work to rebuild his cathedral church, or to build a new one\r\nin the place to which his see had been removed. This leads to the\r\ninference that the old Saxon cathedrals were comparatively small, in an\r\ninferior style of architecture, and perhaps out of repair. Many of the\r\nlords of manors seem to have rebuilt the parish churches, and to have\r\nbuilt new churches in remote parts of their estates.[75] The bishops also\r\nmade provision for the spiritual wants of the people more especially\r\ndependent upon them; Lanfranc, for example, built two churches and two\r\nhospitals in Canterbury, and erected several churches in the manors\r\nbelonging to the archbishopric.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the way in which the landed property of the kingdom was\r\nresettled after the Conquest, each great tenant of the Crown subdividing\r\nhis vast estates among the lesser lords who had fought under his banner,\r\nwe shall see the likelihood that each of these new lords of manors, as\r\nsoon as the country had settled down in tranquillity, would set himself to\r\nmake the best of his new acquisitions; to add to their value by breaking\r\nup new waste land; to consult his dignity and comfort by improving upon\r\nthe rude old hall of his Saxon predecessor, or building himself a new\r\nmanor house. If his manor had only a chapel with imperfect privileges, he\r\nwould not be content without obtaining for it the status of an\r\nindependent parish; and the Norman taste for building would lead him to\r\nreplace the rude timber chapel by a stone church in the improved style of\r\narchitecture which had lately been introduced. In some cases the new lord\r\nbuilt himself a manor house on a new site at a distance from the old one,\r\nand a church near to it, and adopted the new church as the parish church,\r\nleaving the old one to serve as a chapel to those who lived near it.[76] A\r\ngreat number of village churches in nearly all parts of England still\r\nremain, in whole or in part, whose architectural characteristics show that\r\nthey are of about this period. Ordericus Vitalis, the historian of the\r\nconqueror’s sons, says[77] that especially in the reign of Henry I.,[78]\r\nby the fervent devotion of the faithful, the houses and temples built by\r\nEdgar and Edward, and other Christian kings, were taken down to be\r\nreplaced with others of greater magnitude and more elegant workmanship, to\r\nthe glory of the Creator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old Shoreham Church, Sussex.]\r\n\r\nThe life of Orderic himself supplies an example. His father was a priest,\r\na man of some learning, who had come over at the Norman Conquest in the\r\ntrain of Roger of Montgomery, afterwards created Earl of Shrewsbury, and\r\nreceived from his lord lands on the Meole, three miles east of Shrewsbury.\r\nHe found on this estate of Atcham, a chapel built of timber dedicated to\r\nS. Eata, and replaced it by one of stone. He had his son Orderic baptized\r\nby the Saxon priest of the parish, who also stood as his sponsor, and gave\r\nhis own name (sometimes spelt Ulricus) to the child. At the age of five\r\nyears, he entrusted the child to the care of a priest named Siward, to be\r\ntaught the first rudiments of learning; and five years afterwards, on the\r\ndeath of his noble patron, he devoted both himself and his son to the\r\nmonastic life in the monastery at Shrewsbury, which the earl had lately\r\nfounded.[79]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe greatest ecclesiastical work of the Normans was, however, the revival\r\nof the monastic system, and the filling of the country with noble and\r\nwealthy monasteries. The ascetic spirit had been revived in Italy and\r\nFrance by Odo of Clugny, and St. Bernard of Clairvaux, and others, who\r\nhad founded new orders of the Benedictine and Augustinian rules. The\r\nNorman nobles brought this new enthusiasm with them; and just as in the\r\nearly Saxon period every thane thought it incumbent upon him to build a\r\nparish church on his estate, so now it became almost a fashion for every\r\ngreat noble to found a monastery upon his lordship. The nobles, while\r\nthinking first of the glory of God, and the spiritual advantages of the\r\nprayers of a holy community for the founder, his family and descendants,\r\nwere conscious also of the dignity which a monastery reflected upon the\r\nfamily which founded and patronized it, and not insensible to the temporal\r\nadvantages of the establishment of a centre of civilization and religion\r\nin the midst of their dependents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Norman bishops and abbots. (From the twelfth century MS.)]\r\n\r\nWilliam led the way by his foundation of a great Benedictine abbey on the\r\nfield of his victory at Hastings, to which was given the name of Battle\r\nAbbey. William of Warrenne built a priory at Lewes (1077), into which he\r\nintroduced the new Cluniac Order. The canons regular of St. Augustine were\r\nintroduced into England at Colchester c. 1100; the Cistercians at Waverley\r\nin Surrey, in 1128; the Carthusians at Witham in Somerset in 1180; and by\r\nthe end of the twelfth century religious houses of various orders had been\r\nfounded in every part of the country. We have seen that at the end of the\r\nSaxon period there were only about fifty religious houses in England;\r\nunder William and his two successors upwards of 300 new ones were founded.\r\n\r\nThe religious fervour of the monks, who abandoned the world and practised\r\nself-denial as a means to spiritual perfection and closer communion with\r\nGod, naturally excited awed admiration; the picturesque surroundings of\r\ntheir profession, the frock and hood, the shaven head and mortified\r\ncountenance, the hard life of the cloister and the manifold services in\r\nthe church, impressed the imagination; and consequently the popularity of\r\nthe monks threw the secular clergy into the shade. The great churches of\r\nthe monasteries rivalled the cathedrals in magnitude and splendour; the\r\ngreat abbots--relieved by the pope from the jurisdiction of their bishops,\r\nexercising themselves jurisdiction over their own estates, summoned to\r\nparliament, wealthy and learned--were the rivals of the bishops; and the\r\n“lord monks” held a higher rank in public estimation than the parish\r\nrectors. The importance of the political part they played in the life of\r\nthe Middle Ages was hardly, perhaps, commensurate with the space they\r\noccupied in it. The Benedictines cultivated learning, and the Cistercians\r\nwere enterprising agriculturists; the Augustinian orders were useful as\r\npreachers in the towns, and managers of hospitals; the nunneries of\r\nvarious orders were schools for the daughters of the gentry; they were all\r\ncitadels of religion and learning over the length and breadth of the land;\r\nbut from the point of view of public utility, abbots and monks seldom took\r\nany important part in the political events which made history, or were\r\nemployed in the administration of the government, or made their mark as\r\nmen of learning, as the bishops and secular clergy did in every\r\ngeneration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe principal relation between the monasteries and the parish priests is\r\na sinister one; when the popularity of the monks waned, and the secular\r\nclergy in the thirteenth century regained the confidence of the people,\r\nthe mischief was already done which has never been undone. Nearly half the\r\nparishes of England had been stripped of the best part of their\r\nendowments, in order to found and enrich the monasteries; but a small\r\nportion was rescued from their hands by the bishops on the reaction of the\r\nthirteenth century; the rest the monks retained till the Reformation of\r\nthe sixteenth century; and then it was swallowed up by the king and his\r\nnew nobility. But the history of the impropriation of benefices, and the\r\nsubsequent foundation of perpetual vicarages, requires a chapter to\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORDINATION OF A PRIEST. FROM THE LATE XII. CENT. DRAWING,\r\nHARL. ROLL, Y 6.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE FOUNDATION OF VICARAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Norman founders of monasteries not only gave to them lands and moneys,\r\nbut also the parish churches, of which they had the advowson. It can\r\nhardly be said that in so doing they gave what was not theirs to give, for\r\nthe idea was still prominent in men’s minds that the church which a\r\nlandlord or his antecessor had built for himself and his people was, in a\r\nsense, his church, and that he was at liberty (as he is to this day) to\r\ngive his rights in it to some one else; moreover, the ancient custom of\r\nassigning the tithe of his lands to various religious uses, at the owner’s\r\ndiscretion, was still not obsolete,[80] so that the assignment of part of\r\nthe tithe away from the parish in which it was raised to a religious\r\ncommunity at a distance shocked no one’s conscience. Already before the\r\nConquest, in France, the admirers of the new monastic orders had largely\r\nadopted the practice of endowing the new religious houses which they\r\nfounded with the parochial benefices in their patronage; and the practice\r\nhad found some imitators in England.[81] The Norman lords, between their\r\nthank offerings of English benefices to their monasteries at home, in\r\nNormandy and elsewhere, and their zeal in founding monasteries on their\r\nnew English estates and endowing them with their parish churches, in a\r\nvery short time bestowed a great number of parochial benefices upon the\r\nreligious houses.\r\n\r\nSometimes a manor was given to a monastery with the appendant advowson of\r\nthe rectory, which merely put the religious house in the position of any\r\nother patron; but in such cases the community usually, either at once or\r\nbefore very long, obtained some share of the income of the benefice, and\r\nultimately, in most cases, its absolute appropriation.[82]\r\n\r\nBut in the more usual case the benefice was given to the religious house\r\nin such a way that the community became the “rector” of the parish, with,\r\non one hand, all the responsibility of the cure of souls and the\r\nmaintenance of the charities and hospitalities of the parish, and, on the\r\nother hand, with possession of all the endowments, fees, rights, and\r\nprivileges of the rector. It is only charitable to suppose that the lords\r\nof manors, who thus gave over their advowsons, thought that they were\r\ndoing two good things: first, putting the spiritual interests of the\r\nparishioners into the hands of men of superior unworldliness and\r\nspirituality, who would do better for them than the old squire-rectors and\r\ntheir hired chaplains; and secondly, devoting the surplus revenues of the\r\nbenefices to the maintenance of religious organizations, which would use\r\nthem to the glory of God and the spiritual profit of the people in many\r\nways. These benefices were called appropriate benefices, from the\r\ncustomary phrase used in their conveyance, _ad proprios usus_ of the abbot\r\nand the community.\r\n\r\nThe spiritual duties of the parish were sometimes served by one of the\r\ncommunity in holy orders, or by a cleric attached to the house; sometimes\r\nby a stipendiary priest who was paid according to private agreement, and\r\ndismissed at pleasure.\r\n\r\nA short experience showed that the monks told off to take charge of these\r\nappropriate parishes did not generally make very efficient parish\r\npriests--how, indeed, should they? The pastoral work of a parish requires\r\nother qualities, ideas, sympathies, than those which are proper to the\r\ncloister. And, on the other hand, it was soon found that where clerks were\r\nemployed to fulfil the parochial duties, the parishes were under the\r\ndisadvantages--with which some of us are well acquainted in these days--of\r\none supplied during a vacancy by temporary help; the clerk had no status\r\nin the parish, and no permanent interest in it. In both cases it was found\r\nthat the duties were often perfunctorily performed, and that the spiritual\r\nlife of the parish languished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abbot presenting clerk for ordination. (Harl. MS., 1527.)]\r\n\r\nAt the great national synod of Westminster, held by Anselm in 1102, which\r\nwas attended by some of the lay nobles, an attempt was made to mitigate\r\nthe evil. It was decreed (canon 21) that monks should not possess\r\nthemselves of parish churches without the sanction of the bishop, and that\r\nthey should not take so much of the profits of appropriate parishes as to\r\nimpoverish the priests officiating therein. But the evil continued and\r\nincreased until the Court of Rome took up the question and lent its\r\nauthority to the movement. A decree of the Lateran Council in 1179 forbade\r\nthe religious to receive tithes from the laity without the consent of the\r\nbishops, and empowered the bishops to make proper provision for the\r\nspiritual work of the appropriate parishes. The English bishops,\r\nstrengthened by the Papal authority, set themselves to provide a remedy.\r\nThis took the form of the foundation of Perpetual Vicarages in the\r\nappropriated parishes. The bishop required that the convent, instead of\r\nserving the parochial cure by one of the brethren, or by a clerk living in\r\nthe monastery, or by a chaplain resident in the parish on such a stipend\r\nas the convent chose to give, and removable at pleasure, should nominate a\r\ncompetent parish priest, to the satisfaction of the bishop, who was to\r\ninstitute him as perpetual vicar. His title of “Vicarius” implied that he\r\nwas the representative of the rector; his tenure was permanent and\r\nindependent; he was answerable to the bishop, and to him only, for the\r\nproper fulfilment of his duties; and the bishop required that out of the\r\nrevenues of the parish a house and such a portion should be assigned for a\r\nperpetual endowment as would enable the vicar of the parish to maintain\r\nhis position in decent comfort.[83]\r\n\r\nThe pecuniary arrangement usually made was that the small tithes--“_i.e._\r\nthe tithes of every kind except of corn--and the customary offerings and\r\nfees, were assigned to the vicar; while the religious house took the\r\n‘great tithes,’ _i.e._ the tithe of corn.” Sometimes the vicar took the\r\nwhole revenue of the parish of all kinds, and paid a fixed yearly sum of\r\nmoney to the appropriators. Sometimes the community took the revenue, and\r\ngave the vicar a fixed sum.[84] There was an appeal open to both sides if\r\nit turned out that the original agreement seemed, on experience of its\r\nworking, to be inequitable; and there are many cases in which vicars did\r\nappeal, and obtained an augmentation of their incomes.\r\n\r\nA canon of Otho, 1237, required that a man instituted into a vicarage\r\nshould be a deacon at least, and proceed to take priest’s orders in the\r\ncourse of his first year.\r\n\r\nThe details of a few special cases will illustrate these general\r\nstatements, and will help to admit us into the inner life of the mediæval\r\nparishes from a new point of view, and so increase the knowledge we are\r\nseeking of the day-by-day religious life of the parish priests and their\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThurstan, son of Wini, in the time of King Edward the Confessor, gave the\r\nManor of Harlow to the great monastery of St. Edmund, recently restored by\r\nCanute; with the manor the church appendant to it; the convent nominated\r\nto the rectory as any other patron would do, until Pope Boniface IX.--for\r\nthe monastery claimed exemption from episcopal jurisdiction, and regarded\r\nno one but the Pope himself as its superior--gave the abbot licence to\r\nappropriate the church, and to provide for the cure of the parish either\r\nby one of the monks or by a secular priest as the abbot should think fit.\r\n\r\nIn 1398 the abbot, in obedience to the canons, was willing to have a\r\nvicarage appointed for the well-being of the parishioners; the vicar was\r\nto have the _mansum_ of the rectory for his residence, and the tithe of\r\nall sorts of things, except the tithe of corn. It is worth while to give\r\nthe list of the tithes allotted to the vicar, as an example once for all\r\nof what was included under the comprehensive name of small tithes, viz. of\r\nwool, lambs, calves, pigs, and geese; pears, apples, and other fruits of\r\ntrees and orchards; flax, hemp, fallen wood, wax, honey and cheese;\r\nbesides the tithes of a mill and a pigeon-house, and a money payment of\r\n4_s._ 8¼_d._ a year, which probably was an existing composition for\r\npayment in kind or some small endowment for lights or what not. Then come\r\nsome further stipulations. Seeing that the substitution of a poor vicar\r\nfor a wealthy rector might affect the customary charities, the abbot was\r\nto pay 10_s._ a year to the parishioners to be distributed to the\r\npoor,[85] in compensation for any damage to them by means of the\r\nappropriation. Also the vicar was to pay a marc (13_s._ 4_d._) to the\r\nBishop of London in lieu of certain profits which the see would lose by\r\nthe new arrangement.[86]\r\n\r\nSt. Hugh of Lincoln is said to have settled the vicarage of Swynford,\r\nLincolnshire, in 1200, an early example. His successor, William of Blois\r\n(1203-1209), as one of the earliest acts of his episcopate, required the\r\nCanons of Dunstable to endow a vicarage for their church of Pullokeshull\r\nwith the altar dues, ten acres of land, and a third of the tithes. From\r\nthe register of his successor, Hugh of Wells (1209-1235), it appears that\r\nthree hundred vicarages were ordained in his long episcopate. In 1220 he\r\nmade a visitation of Dunstable Priory, and made the monks settle vicarages\r\nin five of their churches. The Pope gave his successor, Bishop Grostete\r\n(1235-1254), authority to visit the exempt[87] orders, and to make them\r\nendow vicarages for their churches.\r\n\r\nAnd what the Bishops of Lincoln were doing in their vast diocese, other\r\nbishops were also doing all up and down the country; the episcopal\r\nregisters abound in records of these “taxations,” as they were called.[88]\r\nWe take two or three examples from the register of Walter de Gray,\r\nArchbishop of York, 1215-1256.\r\n\r\nThe name of Kirkby Malamdale shows that it was an ancient parish. A\r\ncharter of King John confirmed the gift of it by Adam Fitz Adam to the\r\ncanons of West Dereham in Norfolk, _quod suos in usus convertant proprios,\r\nsalvâ tamen decenti et honorifica administratione ejus ecclesiæ_. The\r\nabbot and canons appear, however, to have failed to fulfil the provisions\r\nstipulated for in the charter, for Archbishop Walter de Gray, in 1250,\r\nperemptorily summoned them “to appear before him on the morrow of the\r\nLord’s Day on which is sung _Lætare Jerusalem_ (fourth in Lent), wherever\r\nin his diocese he should happen to be, to show how the vicarage was\r\nendowed and under what authority, taking notice that whether they were\r\npresent or not, if it should appear to be insufficient, he should proceed\r\nto augment it both by the apostolic authority (_i.e._ of the Apostolic\r\nSee) and by his own.”[89]\r\n\r\nThese arrangements were (as has been said) universally subject to future\r\nmodification. For example, in settling the Vicarage of Gerneby (Granby),\r\nwhich was in the presentation of the Prior and Convent of Thurgarton,\r\nNotts, the archbishop describes what the vicar is to have, and concludes\r\nthat the Prior and Convent are to have the residue, “unless it should\r\nappear that an augmentation is needed.”[90] Appeals from vicars for an\r\naugmentation are not infrequent; for example, “Magister Orlandus, the\r\nperpetual vicar of Cunigbur (Conisborough), having urged against the prior\r\nand Convent of Lewes that his vicarage be taxed (= surveyed and valued and\r\ndealt with), we do so. The corn tithe, demesne lands and meadow of the\r\nchurch, and the tenants’ rents to belong to the prior and convent; the\r\nlesser tithes, etc., with two tofts, which we have assigned for a manse,\r\nto belong to the vicar.”[91]\r\n\r\nIn the ordination of the churches of Dalton, Urswick, Millum and Kirkby\r\nIreleth belonging to Furness Abbey, the archbishop orders that Dalton\r\nshall be a vicarage of 15 marks, Urswick shall continue as it is, the\r\nmediety of Millum the abbot and convent shall retain _ad proprios usus_,\r\nand the other mediety of Millum and Kirkby and its chapels shall be at his\r\nown disposition; and that each mediety of Millum shall have a vicarage of\r\n15 marks.\r\n\r\nIn the ordination of the churches belonging to the prior and canons of St.\r\nOswald of Nostell, he says, that in consideration of the poverty and\r\nreligious and honourable life of the prior and canons, he gives, grants,\r\nand confirms to them in pure and perpetual alms a pension of 20 marks of\r\nsilver a year from the church of South Kirkby, which is in their advowson;\r\nand a pension of 15 marks from Tikhill, which is in their advowson. A\r\nlittle later, making a new ordination of the churches of Tikhill, South\r\nKirkby, Rowell (Rothwell), Bouelton (Bolton), Wyverthorpe, and the mediety\r\nof Mekesburgh (Mexborough), he orders, that in the chapel of Slayneton (in\r\nthe parish of Tikhill), since it has a baptistery and a cemetery on\r\naccount of its distance from the mother church, there shall be a perpetual\r\nvicar, who for the maintenance of himself and of the lights and other\r\nnecessaries of the chapel, shall have the whole altarage of Slayneton,\r\nwith the lands belonging to the said chapel. The Vicar of South Kirkby\r\nshall have with him a fellow-priest (_socium sacerdotum_). The Vicar of\r\nRothwell, for the maintenance of himself and a fellow-priest, shall have\r\nall the altarage with a competent manse. He assigns to the Church of York\r\nfor ever the Church of Wyverthorpe (with the reservation of competent\r\nvicars), and both the mother church and the chapel of Helperthorpe; and he\r\nappoints that in the mother church of Wyverthorpe there shall be a\r\nperpetual resident priest vicar, with 24 marks a year, and in the chapel\r\nof Helperthorpe, on account of its distance from the mother church, there\r\nshall be a resident priest vicar, who for his sustenance and that of his\r\nclerks, that he may the more fully and honourably serve the said chapel,\r\nshall have 10 marks yearly.\r\n\r\nIn the ordination of the churches of Sherburn, Fenton, and St. Maurice, in\r\nYork, which were appropriate to one of the prebendaries of York, he\r\ndecrees that each shall have a perpetual vicar with cure of souls, who\r\nshall sustain the burden of their churches and their chapels; the Vicar of\r\nSherburn to have the altarage of the church and its chapels, and pay to\r\nthe canon 35 marks sterling a year; the Vicar of Fenton shall have all the\r\naltarage, paying 6 marks to the canon; and the Vicar of St. Maurice in\r\nMonkgate, York, shall pay 4 marks.\r\n\r\nIn the register of Bishop Bronscombe of Exeter (1258-1280) there are\r\nfrequent records of the assignment of vicarages; in the majority of cases,\r\nthe vicar is given a house and the small tithes, and is required to\r\nsustain all due and customary charges.\r\n\r\nThe ordination of a vicarage in a parish in which assistant-chaplains had\r\nbeen used to be employed, often stipulated for their continued employment\r\nand maintenance by the vicar, and often made other conditions as to the\r\nefficient service of the church and parish. For example, in settling the\r\nvicarage of the prebendal church of Sutton, Lincolnshire, 1276, it was\r\nordained that the vicar should be assisted in the service of the church by\r\na deacon and a clerk; and that he should maintain six candles and a lamp\r\nin the chancel at his own cost.[92]\r\n\r\n    In ordaining a vicarage in St. Mary’s Church in 1269, Bishop\r\n    Bronscombe, of Exeter, requires that the vicar shall keep with him, at\r\n    his own cost, two chaplains who shall serve the chapels in the\r\n    parish.[93] Again, in 1283, in constituting a vicarage at Glasney, the\r\n    same bishop requires that the vicar, by himself and by two chaplains\r\n    maintained at his own cost, shall serve the mother church and its\r\n    chapels as has been accustomed to be done.[94] In the following year\r\n    the same bishop calls upon the Vicar of Harpford to maintain a\r\n    chaplain to serve the Chapel of Fenotery.[95] Bishop Quivil, in 1283,\r\n    requires the Vicar of St. Crantoch and St. Columb Minor to maintain a\r\n    chaplain for the chapel at his own cost (Quivil’s “Register,” p. 371).\r\n\r\nIn 1327, Walter, Vicar of Yatton, Somerset, one of the prebends of the\r\nCathedral of Bath and Wells, complained to Bishop Drokensford that he had\r\nnot enough for the maintenance of himself and two chaplains. The prebend\r\nwas worth a hundred marks and the vicarage ten. The bishop accordingly\r\nassigned to the vicarage a portion of the tithe.[96] Other bishops’\r\nregisters, no doubt all of them, contain similar cases.[97]\r\n\r\nIn 1439, Archbishop Chichele remarks on the poverty of some vicarages, and\r\nthe difficulty the vicars have in obtaining an augmentation of them from\r\nthe rectors and proprietors of churches, and orders ordinaries to allow\r\nsuch vicars to sue _in formâ pauperis_, and to take care that they have\r\nnot less than twelve marks a year, if the whole value of the living will\r\nextend to so much.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there were sometimes appeals from the appropriators to\r\nthe bishop to diminish the sum assigned to the vicar. For example, the\r\nRectory of Kettlewell, co. York, was given to Covenham Abbey, and a\r\nvicarage ordained in 1344, on the unusual condition of the assignment to\r\nthe vicar of the rectory house, and an annual payment of seven marks; in\r\n1359 a new “taxation” of the vicarage was made, and the money payment\r\nreduced to five marks. The Rectory of Whalley was given to the Abbey of\r\nStanlaw in 1284, and a vicarage ordained at the same time; in 1340, on the\r\nrepresentation that the endowment of the vicarage was excessive, and that\r\nthe religious community were involved in the costly work of building\r\ntheir new house and church at Whalley, the Bishop of Lichfield\r\nconsiderably reduced the endowment.\r\n\r\nThe monasteries did not always fulfil their obligations. Sometimes they\r\nseem, when a vacancy occurred in the vicarage, to have left it vacant, and\r\nserved the parish by one of their own members, or in some cheaper way. To\r\nthis abuse a constitution of Othobon was directed, in 1268, which orders\r\nthat the religious should present a vicar with competent endowment within\r\nsix months, and, if not, the bishop should fill up the vacancy. The monks\r\nof Whalley transgressed in this way from the year c. 1356 onwards by\r\nserving the parish church by one of their number. The abuse, however,\r\ncontinued, and at length provoked the interference of the Legislature. In\r\n4 Henry IV. the Commons petitioned the king that curates non-resident,\r\nshould incur the penalties of præmunire (Rot. Parl.). In the same year a\r\nstatute was made providing, _inter alia_, “that henceforth in every church\r\nappropried a secular person be ordained vicar, and that no religious be in\r\nany wise made vicar in any church so appropried.” But, unfortunately, no\r\npenalty was attached to a neglect of the law, and therefore it had little\r\nor no effect. Again, in the 10th Henry VI., a bill was proposed by the two\r\nHouses of Parliament requiring that “in every church appropried a secular\r\nperson be ordained perpetual vicar, and that if any religious henceforth\r\nsuffer a vicarage to be for six months without a resident vicar, the said\r\nchurch shall be disappropried and disamortized for ever;” but, unhappily,\r\nthe king refused his assent to it, and the evil continued.[98]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe institution of vicarages, like everything else, was liable to abuses.\r\nOne of the abuses was where a rector instituted a vicarage in his own\r\nrectory, thus reserving the greater part of the income of the benefice to\r\nhimself as a sinecure, and devolving the labour and responsibility upon\r\nanother who received the lesser share. Thus, in the Lichfield Register, in\r\n1328, the Rector of Walton was allowed to have a curate (vicar) on\r\ncondition of setting aside for him a house in the parish, the oblations at\r\nthe altar and at marriages and churchings, the tithes of a hamlet, and\r\nherbage of church and chapel yards; the curate was to find chaplains for\r\nthe chapels, and a deacon at 20_s._ a year for the church.[99]\r\n\r\nAnother abuse, forbidden by the Synod of Oxford, in 1223, was for the\r\nparson of a parish to change himself into a vicar, and dispose of the\r\nrectory to another. This synod also ordained that vicars should serve the\r\ncure in person, should be in priests’ orders or proceed to them\r\nimmediately, and that every presentee should make oath that he had not\r\ngiven or promised anything or entered into any agreement on account of his\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nPAROCHIAL CHAPELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a rather early period, so the evidence leads us to conclude, all the\r\ngreat Saxon landowners had founded a religious house or a rectory on their\r\nestates, and these had, first by custom and then by legal recognition of\r\nthe custom, obtained certain rights; on one hand, the sole right of\r\nspiritual ministration and pastoral jurisdiction among the people on those\r\nestates; and, on the other hand, to certain payments from them. Many of\r\nthese estates were very large in area, embracing what at first were tracts\r\nof uninhabited and uncultivated country. But as population increased, and\r\nnew lands were brought under cultivation, the spiritual needs of the new\r\nhalls and new hamlets which came into being were supplied by chapels;\r\nthese were built sometimes by the munificence of the lord of the whole\r\nestate, sometimes by the pious zeal of the rector who felt himself\r\nresponsible for these new parishioners; sometimes by the mesne lord to\r\nwhom the land of the new clearing had been granted; sometimes by the\r\ngroup of farmers whose labour had cleared the forest or broken up the\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\nThe old Saxon parish priests frequently had one or more chaplains and\r\nclerks living with them and assisting them in their duties;[100] and this\r\ncontinued to be the case down to the Reformation, the bishops taking such\r\nsteps as they could to perpetuate the maintenance of these chaplains.\r\n\r\nWhen these _chapels_ were erected, care was taken of the rights of the\r\nmother church. Constitutions of Egbert, Archbishop of York in 750, decree\r\nthat the mother church shall not be deprived of tithes or other rights by\r\nallotment of them to new chapels. The same is ordered in a council under\r\nKing Ethelred, by the advice of his two archbishops, Alfege and Wulfstan.\r\n\r\nClun, Shropshire, is an example of the great Saxon parishes. In the time\r\nof Richard I., Isabel de Saye gave the church and its chapels to Wenlock\r\nPriory for the safety of her soul and the souls of her husband and son,\r\nher father and mother, and all her ancestors and successors. The chapels\r\nenumerated are at the vill of St. Thomas de Waterdene, de Clumbire, de\r\nCluntune, de Oppetune, and the chapels de Eggedune and Sebbidune, and all\r\nother chapels and belongings. The donor, however, reserves her free\r\nchapels, viz. the chapel of her castle, and any others.[101]\r\n\r\nShawbury was a Saxon foundation mentioned in Domesday. A certificate of\r\nBishop Roger de Clinton (1130-1148) shows that there were then four\r\nvilles, viz. of Aston Reynald, Moreton Corbet, Grenvill, and Great\r\nWithyford, and that the bishop consecrated chapels in three of them, there\r\nbeing one already existing. The bishop decided that such lands and\r\nendowment as the lords of the fees had offered when he consecrated the new\r\ncemeteries were offered to the mother church. The church, with its\r\nchapels, was appropriated to Haughmond Abbey; the canons of Haughmond\r\nbeing required to present fit chaplains to the Church and assign them a\r\nproper sustenance, the residue they might appropriate to their own uses\r\nand the entertainment of guests.[102]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clun Church, Shropshire.]\r\n\r\nAt length the multiplication of chapels was regulated by legislation. The\r\nsynod of Westminster (1102), under Anselm, decreed that no more should be\r\nerected without the bishop’s leave.\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the endowment of many of these\r\nchapels, the concession to them of the right of baptism, marriage, and\r\nburial, the assignment of a district within which the priest had pastoral\r\njurisdiction, and the concession to the mesne lord of the patronage of the\r\nchapel which he had built and endowed, amounted to the practical elevation\r\nof such chapels to the status of parish churches. The natural tendency of\r\nthings was in this direction. A landholder who had built a church for\r\nhimself and his people would naturally desire that it should possess the\r\ndignity of a parish church, and was thus induced to provide a sufficient\r\nendowment for it. The people would naturally desire the convenience of\r\nhaving all the means of grace at their own church instead of having to\r\ncarry their children to a distance for baptism and their dead for burial,\r\nand in some cases the more well-to-do freeholders would be willing to\r\ncontribute to the cost of it. The quotation of some actual examples will\r\nbe the most interesting way of illustrating the general history of this\r\ndevelopment.[103]\r\n\r\n    Domesday speaks of one church in the Hundred of Alnodestreu and County\r\n    of Salop, viz. that of St. Gregory. When Bishop Robert de Betun (about\r\n    1138) granted this church to the Abbey of Shrewsbury, St. Gregory’s\r\n    became the priory church of Momerfeuld, or Morville, and it had three\r\n    dependent chapels, which were also appropriated to the priory, viz. at\r\n    Billingsley which had as its endowment half the corn tithes of the\r\n    said ville and paid 6_s._ 8_d._ to the mother church, at Olbury which\r\n    paid 5_s._ and at Tasley which paid 6_s._ 8_d._[104]\r\n\r\n    Within a year or two Robert Fitz Aer[105] founded another chapel at\r\n    Aston Aer, endowing it with sixty acres and a house and all tithes of\r\n    the domain. Within ten years two other such chapels were built, viz.\r\n    at Aldenham and Underdon with separate endowments. By the\r\n    appropriation deed, which gives St. Gregory and its chapels to the\r\n    convent, it is ordained that these chapels shall be subject to the\r\n    mother church of Morville, so that on great festivals the people shall\r\n    attend there, and the priest of Morville shall, if he pleases, have\r\n    the dead carried thither for burial. Again, the same bishop\r\n    consecrated a new chapel at Astley Abbots, endowed by the Abbot of\r\n    Salop himself with thirty acres, a house, and a parcel of land worth\r\n    4_s._ per ann.\r\n\r\nThese seven chapels in one parish, nearly all consecrated by one bishop,\r\nseem to mark a time of active extension. It is curious that, whereas\r\nOrderic Vitalis says that there was much building of monasteries and\r\nchurches in the reign of Henry I., because the country had settled down,\r\nafter the troubles of the Conquest, into peace and security,[106] Bishop\r\nde Betun says that he has consented to consecrate so many chapels as a\r\nprotection for the poor, and out of regard to the warlike troubles of the\r\ntime--for it was during the stormy reign of Stephen.[107]\r\n\r\n    In many cases the owners of the estates on which the chapels were\r\n    situated, or the tenants, or both together, made an agreement with the\r\n    rector to augment the stipend of a chaplain so that he might give\r\n    additional services and pastoral care in their ville. Thus, when\r\n    Gilbert Norman (1130?) gave the church of Kingston-on-Thames to Merton\r\n    Priory, the parish had already four chapelries, Thames Ditton, East\r\n    Moulsey, Petersham, and Shene (now Richmond). In 1211 the inhabitants\r\n    of Petersham complained of the paucity of services in their chapel,\r\n    and the matter came before the Ecclesiastical Courts. It would appear\r\n    that lack of funds was at the bottom of the deficiency of service. The\r\n    prior and convent, “of their great piety, and for the good of the\r\n    souls of their parishioners,” granted to the vicar and his successors\r\n    two quarters of corn, one of barley, and one of oats; and the Abbot\r\n    and Convent of Chertsey, who were considerable landowners there, also\r\n    of their good will granted a quarter of corn from their lands there,\r\n    for the sustentation of a chaplain who should celebrate in the chapel\r\n    thrice a week, viz. on Sunday, Wednesday, and Friday.[108] A like\r\n    complaint was made again in 1266, when the appropriators increased\r\n    their grant to four quarters of wheat, one of barley, and one of oats;\r\n    and seventeen of the parishioners for themselves and heirs granted a\r\n    payment of one bushel of wheat for every ten acres of their land,\r\n    making twenty-four and a half bushels. Other cases in which the people\r\n    themselves contributed to the support of their priest will be found in\r\n    the chapter on Chantries.\r\n\r\nClearly the thing to be desired was to get resident chaplains appointed to\r\nall the villes with a considerable population, and to that end to get\r\nendowments for them, and much was done in this direction in the thirteenth\r\ncentury. We shall find ample illustrations of various features of the work\r\nin the forty years’ episcopate of Archbishop Walter Gray. The archbishop\r\nwrote to the Pope, Gregory IX., on the subject, desiring, no doubt, to get\r\nthe support of the Papal sanction for the measures which he desired to\r\ntake. We gather from the pope’s reply that the archbishop had represented\r\nto him that “many parishes in his diocese were so widely spread that the\r\nparishioners were at a great distance from their church, and were not\r\nable, without much inconvenience, to come to the Divine services; and that\r\nit often happened, when the priest was summoned by the sick, that before\r\nhe could arrive they had died without confession and the viaticum;” and\r\nno doubt the archbishop had suggested what he desired to do; whereupon the\r\npope grants to him leave that, after due consideration of the distance of\r\nplaces, the difficulties of the roads, and the number of the increasing\r\npopulation, in parishes of this sort, he should build oratories and\r\ninstitute priests in them.[109]\r\n\r\nThe way in which the archbishop set to work (1233) to strengthen the\r\nexisting machinery is admirably illustrated in the ordinance which he drew\r\nup with the concurrence of the dean for the vicarages with their chapels\r\nbelonging to the deanery. There were three vicarages, Pocklington,\r\nPickering, and Kellum. Pocklington had six chapels, Pickering four, and it\r\ndoes not appear that Kellum had any. First he strengthened the mother\r\nchurches by the requirement that each of the vicars should, “besides all\r\nother necessary ministers,” have a chaplain--an assistant priest--always\r\nwith him. Then he consolidated the six chapels of Pocklington and the four\r\nof Pickering, two and two, into five vicarages, _i.e._ two neighbouring\r\nchapels were formed into a vicarage, the incumbent of which was to have\r\n_in nomine vicaragiæ_ certain endowments, and the vicar was to find the\r\nnecessary ministers for both chapels; but the dignity of the mother\r\nchurches was reserved by the provision that the new vicars were to pay a\r\nsmall annual sum to their mother churches _nomine subjectionis_.[110]\r\nAnother illustration of the way in which the improved condition of things\r\nwas brought about is in the case of Roundelay. Sir John de Roundelay and\r\nhis heirs and the men of that ville had licence (A.D. 1231) to establish a\r\nperpetual chantry in their chapel every day in the year save Christmas,\r\nPurification, Easter (“Parasceues”), and All Saints, and if they had\r\nservice on Palm Sunday, it was to be without procession and the blessing\r\nof the Palms; neither were they to have the celebration of baptism,\r\nmarriage, or churching; on all these occasions they were to repair to the\r\nmother church, and the chaplain and people were to swear obedience to the\r\nmother church and its rectors. Sir John provided an endowment for the new\r\nincumbent, and the vicar of the mother church was to give him half a mark\r\na year (6_s._ 8_d._), in consideration, no doubt, that it had hitherto\r\nbeen a charge upon him to that extent or more to make provision for the\r\npartial services at the chapel.[111]\r\n\r\nAgain, Berneston Chapel, Notts, had been accustomed to have only three\r\nservices a week. The people had the archbishop’s licence to give an\r\nendowment to provide for having full services in their chapel _pro habendo\r\nplenario servitio_ by a chaplain and clerk residing there.[112]\r\n\r\nThere are many other examples in the Archbishop’s Register of similar\r\nextensions of the usefulness of the existing ecclesiastical machinery, but\r\nthese are enough to show the way in which it was done. There can be no\r\ndoubt that the work was done in the same way where it was needed in the\r\nother dioceses of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious instance at Stokesay, in Shropshire. Before the\r\nConquest, the parish church of that estate had been at Aldon, which is\r\nmentioned in Domesday. After the Conquest, the status of parish church had\r\nbeen given to a new church at Stokesay, on the same estate, and Aldon\r\nChurch had been left in the status of a chapel. In 1367, the chief\r\nparishioners of Aldon took proceedings against the vicar, Walter of\r\nGreneburg, for neglecting them, and he was required by the bishop to find\r\na chaplain to celebrate three days a week--Sunday, Wednesday, and\r\nFriday--except on great festivals.[113]\r\n\r\nThe following seems to be an instance of the transition of dependent\r\nchapels into independent parish churches, and an illustration of the way\r\nin which sometimes it came about. At Newnham, Gloucestershire, in 1260, an\r\ninquisition _post mortem_ found that the Rector of Westbury held the\r\nchapels of Newnham and Munstreworth as pertaining to the Church of\r\nWestbury. In 1309, in the Pleas before the King, the jurors declared on\r\noath that the churches of Newnham and Munstreworth were mother churches\r\nwith cure of souls before the time of King Henry III., and in the\r\npresentation of the king.\r\n\r\nHere is an example at Whalley of the way in which great landed proprietors\r\nbrought new tracts of their forest and waste under cultivation, and\r\ncreated new manors.\r\n\r\n    In a suit in the reign of Edward III., the jurors found that in the\r\n    time of King John there was not in the aforesaid place of Brandwode\r\n    any manor or manses, but it was waste, neither built upon nor\r\n    cultivated, and was parcel of the aforesaid forest of Penhul [Pendle],\r\n    and it is said that in the time of Henry, the ancestor [proavus] of\r\n    the present king, the then abbot [of Whalley] built houses on the\r\n    aforesaid waste of Brandwode, and caused a great part of the waste to\r\n    be enclosed, which is now called the Manor of Brandwode.[114]\r\n\r\nAnd here is a late example of the people reclaiming waste, and building a\r\nchapel for themselves:--\r\n\r\n    In the end of the fifteenth century the forest of Rossendale was\r\n    inhabited only, or chiefly, by foresters and the keepers of the deer.\r\n    Upon representation to King Henry VII., and afterwards to Henry VIII.,\r\n    that if the deer were taken away, the forest was likely to come to\r\n    some good purpose, it was disafforested, and let forth in divers\r\n    sorts, some for a term of years, some by copy of Court Roll; so that\r\n    where there was nothing else but deer and other savage and wild\r\n    beasts, by the industry of the inhabitants, there is since grown to be\r\n    very fertile ground well replenished with people. And inasmuch as the\r\n    Castle Church of Clitheroe, being their parish church, was distant\r\n    twelve miles, and the ways very foul, painful, and perilous, and the\r\n    country in the winter season so extremely and vehemently cold, that\r\n    infants borne to the church are in great peril of their lives, and the\r\n    aged and impotent people and women great with child not able to travel\r\n    so far to hear the Word of God, and the dead corpses like to remain\r\n    unburied till such time as great annoyance to grow thereby, the\r\n    inhabitants about 1512, at their proper costs, made a chapel-of-ease\r\n    in the said forest; since the disafforesting of the said forest from\r\n    eighty persons there are grown to be a thousand young and old. At the\r\n    same time, one Lettice Jackson, a widow, vested in feoffees certain\r\n    lands for the use of the new church of our Saviour in Rossendale. The\r\n    population seems to have continued to increase, for, thirty years\r\n    afterwards, the people founded and edified a chapel in Morell Height\r\n    in honour of God, our Blessed Lady and All Saints.[115]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the law carefully safeguarded the rights of the mother\r\nchurches, as against the new chapels which sprang up. The Church also was\r\ncareful to maintain their dignity in a way which calls for some remark.\r\nThe curate of a chapel, on his institution, made a vow of reverence and\r\nobedience to his rector. Very generally some small payment was required\r\nfrom the chapelry to the rector _in nomine subjectionis_, as an\r\nacknowledgment of dependence. The people of the chapelries were required\r\non several of the great festivals of the Church to communicate at the\r\nmother church, and on one or more of these festivals to visit the mother\r\nchurch in procession with flags flying.\r\n\r\nThere was another custom, very like this, on a larger scale, viz. the\r\ncustom for the parishioners of all the parishes of a diocese to visit the\r\ncathedral church in procession on a given day in the year. This seems to\r\nhave been a very old custom, for which Sir R. Phillimore quotes the\r\nCouncil of Agde and the Decretum of Gratian,[116] and suggests that it\r\nwas probably introduced into England at the Norman Conquest. We find it\r\nenjoined in the canons of several Diocesan Councils; and it is tolerably\r\ncertain that it was a general custom.\r\n\r\nWe suggest that the idea at the back of these customs was not merely that\r\nthe offerings of the people of the chapelries should not be lost to the\r\nrector of the mother church on the three great days of offering; and that\r\nthe cathedral should receive a yearly tribute from every subject of the\r\nbishop. We suggest that the purpose of the custom was to maintain the idea\r\nof the unity of the Church. The chapels had received their Christianity\r\nfrom the mother church, and all the “houseling people” in recognition of\r\nit worshipped there three times a year. The mother churches received their\r\nChristianity from the bishop’s see, and were his spiritual subjects, and\r\nonce a year went up in procession to worship at the cathedral as an act of\r\nhomage. And these reunions would, in fact, promote the idea of brotherly\r\ncommunion and Christian unity, as the attendance of the Israelites on the\r\nthree great festivals at their one temple in Jerusalem tended to maintain\r\nthe national unity of the people as the people of God.\r\n\r\nNothing is free from abuse. We learn from the Register of Bishop Storey,\r\nof Chichester, that in 1478 the people who came yearly to visit the shrine\r\nof St. Richard on his commemoration day (April 3), had been accustomed to\r\ncarry long painted wands, and in struggles for precedence had used these\r\nwands upon one another’s heads and shoulders; wherefore the bishop\r\ndirects that in future they shall, instead of wands, carry banners and\r\ncrosses, that the several parishes shall march up reverently from the west\r\ndoor of the cathedral in a prescribed order, of which notice should be\r\ngiven by the incumbents in their churches on the Sunday preceding the\r\nfestival.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRoyal chapels were, on no sound ecclesiastical principle, but by an\r\nexercise of the royal prerogative, from an early period held to be outside\r\nany episcopal jurisdiction.[117] For example, a series of churches along\r\nthe old Mercian border, Stone, Stafford, and Gnosall, Penkridge and\r\nWolverhampton, Tettenhall, as having been built by King Wulfhere, or by\r\nElfleda, the Lady of Mercia, claimed exemption from all control. Clinton\r\nBishop of Lichfield (1129-48) tried to bring them under his rule by\r\npurchasing them of the king, and annexing them bodily to the possessions\r\nof his see but that did not hinder them from still claiming their ancient\r\nprivileges.\r\n\r\nThe lawyers[118] say that the king may by charter license a subject to\r\nbuild a free chapel similarly free from the jurisdiction of the ordinary,\r\nbut they are not able to quote any instances of it. Some barons, however,\r\ndid claim freedom from jurisdiction for the chapels of certain castles;\r\nperhaps on the ground that the castles were royal castles, and that they\r\nheld or had received them from the crown with all their privileges and\r\nexemptions. For example, the chapel of St. Mary, in the castle at\r\nHastings, enlarged, if not founded, soon after the Conquest, by the Count\r\nof Eu, for a dean and ten prebendaries, was claimed by successive lords of\r\nthe castle to be a free chapel; and in spite of repeated attempts by the\r\nbishops of Chichester to assert their rights, the privilege was\r\nsuccessfully maintained till the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nA number of chapels were called free chapels, apparently because they were\r\nfree from subjection to the mother church of the parish. We have already\r\nseen that the free chapels, built for the convenience of outlying groups\r\nof population, were at first served by chaplains from the mother church;\r\nthen the chaplains nominated by the rector resided at the chapelries; and\r\nwhen the chapels were endowed and assigned districts, and obtained the\r\nrights of baptism, marriage, and burial, still the patronage to the\r\nchapelries was in the rector, and the sentiment of subjection to the\r\nmother church was carefully kept up by the payment of a pension from the\r\none to the other, and the custom of a procession to the service of the\r\nmother church on one or more great occasions. But in some cases a chapel\r\nbecame freed from this subjection by the action of the neighbouring\r\nsquire, who, by purchase or agreement, obtained special rights over it; or\r\nsome private patron built and endowed a new chapel with the stipulation\r\nfor certain rights. We have seen that, when Isabel de Saye gave the\r\nparish of Clun and all its chapels to Wenlock Priory, the donor reserved\r\nher free chapels.\r\n\r\nHere is an instance of a chapel which is called a free chapel, but was\r\ntechnically a chantry, and clearly intended to serve also as a\r\nchapel-of-ease to the town in which it was situated.\r\n\r\n    In 1309, Edward Lovekyn, of Kingston-on-Thames, had leave to build a\r\n    chapel there, and endow it with lands and rent. Robert Lovekyn, his\r\n    brother and successor, withheld some of the income, and was compelled\r\n    to restore it by threat of excommunication with bell and candle. In\r\n    1352, John Lovekyn rebuilt the chapel and increased the endowment for\r\n    the sustentation of one or more additional chaplains, one to be warden\r\n    (it does not appear that there ever were more than the warden and one\r\n    brother), who had a manse. The rules and ordinances are given at\r\n    length in the book from which we quote. They were to live together in\r\n    the manse, with separate sleeping rooms, and a common table. The\r\n    warden was to provide suitable provision, and give to each brother a\r\n    gown of the same kind which he wore, and forty silver shillings a year\r\n    for his other necessaries. The warden was also to provide a clerk to\r\n    serve mass and wait upon the chaplains in their rooms; and to provide\r\n    honest surplices and amyces furred with black fur to wear in chapel.\r\n    The warden to be always in residence, and not to take any other cure;\r\n    not to give or sell any corrody; the warden might have guests at\r\n    table; if any other had a guest, he was to pay 3_d._ for his dinner\r\n    and 2_d._ for any other meal.[119] Masses to be said for the founder\r\n    and his family, and also to grace after dinner was to be added, “May\r\n    the souls of John Edward and Robert Lovekyn, our founders, and of the\r\n    Lord William, Bishop of Winchester, and all faithful deceased, rest in\r\n    peace through the mercy of God.” On the four principal feasts the\r\n    chaplains were to attend the parish church and make their offerings\r\n    like other parishioners. In consideration that John Lovekyn gave a\r\n    manse to the vicarage, his chapel was to have all oblations which came\r\n    to it.[120]\r\n\r\n    The calendar of the chapels, chantries, etc., at the time of the\r\n    Reformation, mentions 432 chapels, of which 198 are called “free\r\n    chapels.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE PARISH PRIEST--HIS BIRTH AND EDUCATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early Saxon bishops were very often men of royal and noble families.\r\nThe religious houses, which were the centres of evangelization in the\r\nearly missionary phase of the history, were often founded by royal and\r\nnoble persons, who were not seldom themselves the first abbots and\r\nabbesses, and handed down their houses and offices as hereditary\r\npossessions. The parish churches were founded by the lords of the land,\r\nwho made the advowson appendant to the manor, and very usually brought up\r\na younger son to be the spiritual rector of the family estate. The natural\r\nresult of all this would be that a large proportion of the Saxon clergy\r\nwould be men of good family; not by any means exclusively, for we have\r\nseen that even slaves[121] were sometimes admitted to Holy Orders, and we\r\nhave read[122] a kindly warning to priests of noble birth not to despise\r\ntheir brethren of humbler origin; and the law assigned to every\r\npriest--_qua_ priest--the rank of thane (p. 77).\r\n\r\nWe know that the founders of the English churches established schools, and\r\nfinding their converts apt pupils, soon raised up a learned native clergy.\r\nThe young men intended for the pastoral office were taught the learning\r\nand trained in the ascetic discipline of these monastic schools.[123]\r\n\r\nThe natural result would be that the Saxon clergy would not only be\r\ngenerally of good birth and breeding, but also religious, learned, and\r\ncapable men; the natural spiritual rulers, teachers, and protectors of the\r\npopulation of freemen, villeins, and serfs who peopled the estate of which\r\nthe civil lord and ruler was often the rector’s father or brother.\r\n\r\nThe Norman Conquest introduced confusion for a time into both monasteries\r\nand parishes. Norman abbots intruded into the religious houses, sometimes\r\nquarrelled with the Saxon monks, and the first inhabitants of the\r\nnewly-founded monasteries were usually imported from abroad; as the\r\nrectories fell vacant, they would be filled with the sons of the new\r\nNorman lords of manors, and there could be little sympathy between the\r\nNorman rector and the Saxon flock. But things soon settled down upon a new\r\ncourse. In a very few generations Normans and Saxons amalgamated. The old\r\nmonasteries, revived and reformed, and the new ones added to them, were\r\nfilled with zealous English communities; and in the parishes an English\r\nlord of the manor and an English rector ruled an English people. With the\r\nthirteenth century we begin a new period of parish history, continuing\r\ndown to the sixteenth century, and extending all over the country, of\r\nwhich the general features are very uniform; so that it is only necessary\r\noccasionally to point out new institutions and phases of character.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most striking social feature of these centuries is the way in\r\nwhich the Church opened up a career to all ranks and classes of the\r\npeople. The great landed families still maintained friendly relations with\r\nthe monasteries which their forbears had founded, and sometimes\r\ncontributed one of their cadets to the cloister, and perhaps in time\r\nsecured his nomination to the abbacy; the lords of the manors continued to\r\npresent their younger sons to the rectories; so that there was always a\r\nstrong aristocratic element among the clergy. The vicars were for the most\r\npart the nominees of the religious houses, and the conjecture that abbots\r\nand priors, and abbesses, and prioresses, and dignitaries of the houses,\r\nnot infrequently presented their relatives, and sometimes clerks in the\r\nservice of the house, is supported by some actual examples.\r\n\r\nThe middle classes supplied a great number of the clergy who filled the\r\noffices of parish chaplain (= assistant-curates), chantry priest, guild\r\npriest, and the like; and many of these, by force of learning, character,\r\nand good service, rose to higher offices. Even young men of the servile\r\nclass were not excluded from the ranks of the clergy. The slaves whom\r\nGregory and Aidan, and others, redeemed and trained as priests, may have\r\nbeen young men of good family taken captive in war; but in the thirteenth\r\nand subsequent centuries young men born and bred serfs were not\r\ninfrequently educated and ordained, and given fair chance of promotion. It\r\nis true they were under special legal disabilities. A serf could not be\r\nhimself ordained, or send his children to school without his lord’s leave,\r\nfor they were _adscripti glæbe_, bound to the soil, and their labour and\r\ntheir children’s labour (or a portion of it, carefully defined by law and\r\ncustom) was an important part of the property of their lord; the canons of\r\nthe Church, moreover, from a very early period, had made servile birth a\r\ndisqualification for Holy Orders;[124] but in the thirteenth, and\r\nespecially in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, there are numerous\r\nexamples in which a serf gave a fine to his lord for leave to send his son\r\nto school, and kindly lords not infrequently gave the right gratis to a\r\npromising youth, and his ultimate freedom; and the Church frequently,\r\nprobably usually, as a matter of course, gave a dispensation _de defectu\r\nnatalium_.\r\n\r\nFrom the single manor of Woolrichston, in Warwickshire, we get these\r\nillustrations of the text:--In 1361, Walter Martin paid 5_s._ for the\r\nprivilege of putting his son _ad scholas_. In 1371, William Potter fined\r\nin 13_s._ 4_d._, that his eldest son may go _ad scholas_ and take Orders.\r\nStephen Sprot fined in 3_s._ 4_d._, that he might send his son Richard _ad\r\nscholas_. William Henekyn fined in 5_s._, to marry his daughter Alice. In\r\n1335, William at Water paid for licence for his younger son William _ad\r\nsacrum ordinem promovendum_.[125]\r\n\r\nHere is another example. In 1312, the Bishop of Durham gave license to his\r\n_nativus_, Walter de Hoghington, clerk, to receive all Divine orders, and\r\nrenounced his _jus domini_.[126]\r\n\r\nAnd this liberal sentiment was based upon the profoundest principle. When\r\nthe King’s School at Canterbury was reorganized, at the time of the\r\nReformation, some of the commissioners to whom the work was committed\r\nwished to limit the school to the children of gentlemen. It was for the\r\nploughman’s son, they argued, to go to plough, and the artificer’s son to\r\napply to the trade of his parents’ vocation; and the gentleman’s children\r\nare used to have the knowledge of government and rule of the commonwealth.\r\n“I grant,” replied Archbishop Cranmer, who was one of the commissioners,\r\n“much of your meaning herein as needful in a commonwealth; but yet utterly\r\nto exclude the ploughman’s son and the poor man’s son from the benefit of\r\nlearning, as though they were unworthy to have the gifts of the Holy Ghost\r\nbestowed upon them as well as upon others, was as much as to say that\r\nAlmighty God should not be at liberty to bestow His great gifts of grace\r\nupon any person but as we and other men shall appoint them to be employed\r\naccording to our fancy, and not according to His most goodly will and\r\npleasure, who giveth His gifts of learning and other perfections in all\r\nsciences unto all kinds and states of people indifferently.”[127]\r\n\r\nThere were always some who took the less liberal view which the archbishop\r\nthus nobly rebuked. Even in the twelfth century, Walter Map (one of the\r\nclerks in the civil service of Henry II., holding various ecclesiastical\r\npreferments; he died in 1209) complains that villeins were attempting to\r\neducate their “ignoble and degenerate offspring” in the liberal arts.\r\n\r\nThe author of the “Vision of Piers Plowman” gives utterance to the same\r\nilliberal prejudices as the noble colleagues of Cranmer. He thinks that\r\n“Bondmen and beggars’ children belong to labour, and should serve lords’\r\nsons, and lords’ sons should serve God, as belongeth to their degree;” and\r\ncomplains that “bondmen’s bairns should be made bishops, and that popes\r\nand patrons should refuse gentle blood and take Symond’s son to keep\r\nsanctuary.”[128]\r\n\r\nIn another place the same writer says, in the same strain--\r\n\r\n  Now might each sowter[129] his son setten to schole\r\n  And each beggar’s brat in the book learne,\r\n  And worth to a writer and with a lorde dwelle,\r\n  Or falsely to a frere the fiend for to serven.\r\n  So of that beggar’s brat a Bishop that worthen,\r\n  Among the peers of the land prese to sytten;\r\n  And lorde’s sons lowly to the lordes loute\r\n  Knyghtes crooketh hem to, and crowcheth ful lowe;\r\n  And his sire a sowter[129] y-soiled with grees,\r\n  His teeth with toyling of leather battered as a saw.\r\n\r\nThe writer of “Symon’s Lesson of Wisdom for Children,” in a much more\r\ngenial spirit, jestingly encourages the children to be diligent in their\r\nlessons by holding out the prize of succession to the see:\r\n\r\n  And lerne as faste as thou can,\r\n  For our byshop is an old man,\r\n  And therfor thou must lerne faste\r\n  If thou wilt be byshop when he is past.[130]\r\n\r\nThe better spirit prevailed. The lower classes had the inevitable\r\ndisadvantages of their origin to contend with, but every cathedral and\r\nreligious house had its schools, which were ready enough to admit boys who\r\nwere seen to possess those “gifts of the Holy Ghost” which might, if duly\r\ncultivated, make them useful in Church and State; and it was regarded as\r\nthe duty of ecclesiastical persons to look out for such boys, and support\r\nthem in their career. Richard II. rejected a proposal to forbid villeins\r\nto send their children to school “to learn clergee;” and the triumph of\r\nthe more liberal sentiment was legally secured by the Statute of\r\nArtificers passed by Parliament in 1406, which enacted that “every man or\r\nwoman, of what state or condition he be, shall be free to set their son or\r\ndaughter to take learning at any school that pleaseth them within the\r\nrealm.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe career which was thus thrown open to all classes of the people was a\r\nmuch larger one than appears at first sight. Not only all the offices and\r\ndignities of the Church, from that of stipendiary chaplain to that of\r\nbishop or even of Pope, were open to all comers, but also all the offices\r\nof the State which required learning as a qualification were open to every\r\nclerk. For the kings took the officials of the civil departments of the\r\nGovernment very largely from the ranks of the clergy; and, by a great\r\nabuse of their patronage, paid them for their services to the State by\r\npromotion to the emoluments and dignities of the Church.[131]\r\n\r\nSome of the satirists found fault with this state of things, but, in fact,\r\nthe man of humble birth, who had risen to high rank in the Church by force\r\nof his own learning and character, had little to fear from illiberal\r\nreflections upon the lowliness of his origin. The men who had risen from\r\nthe grammar school of some village or obscure town to rank and wealth were\r\nso far from trying to hide the obscurity of their origin, that it was the\r\ngeneral custom of dignified ecclesiastics to drop their patronymic and\r\ntake the name of their birthplace instead. Thus, he whom we familiarly\r\ncall Thomas-à-Becket was known to his contemporaries as Thomas of London;\r\nthe family name of Thomas of Rotherham, Archbishop of York, was Scot; the\r\nfamily name of the illustrious bishop and statesman, William of Wyckham,\r\nwas Longe; and that of William of Wayneflete was Barlow.[132] Another good\r\ncustom was that such men frequently raised for themselves a lasting\r\nmonument in their native place by founding a free school in the village,\r\nor a college or hospital in the town.[133]\r\n\r\nFrom the school of the cathedral or monastery, or of the parish priest,\r\nthe ambitious student whose means permitted it went to some more famous\r\ncentre of learning: in Saxon times, to the schools of Canterbury or York\r\nor Winchester; in later times, to the universities which were organized\r\nunder the auspices of the Church in the various countries of Europe in the\r\ntwelfth and thirteenth centuries. Bologna was famous as a School of Law;\r\nParis took the lead in Theology; Salerno in Medicine. Here, in England,\r\nOxford and Cambridge were centres of learning at the close of the twelfth\r\ncentury, and organized universities early in the thirteenth. Oxford in the\r\nthirteenth century had a European reputation second only to that of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe period from the awakening of new religious and scientific thought in\r\nthe eleventh century through the two following centuries, was one of great\r\nintellectual activity throughout Europe. The isolated Saxon Church had\r\nbeen little affected by the new learning; but the first Norman archbishop,\r\nLanfranc, was one of the foremost scholars of the time, and Anselm, his\r\nsuccessor, was more than that, being one of the greatest thinkers of\r\nChristian Europe; and from their time onward Englishmen held a place among\r\nthe most learned men of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn those days, as in these--and indeed in all days--men had different\r\nnatural temperaments--some a contemplative and spiritual disposition, some\r\nan inquiring scientific turn of mind, others a rationalizing and practical\r\nbias; some leaned upon authority, others were speculative and\r\nself-confident. Great freedom of thought was permitted, and of the\r\nexpression of thought, and yet England was very little troubled by\r\nheresies. From the beginning of the English Church to the beginning of the\r\nReformation of the sixteenth century, the excessive doctrines of\r\nLollardism in the fourteenth century--when they seemed to threaten the\r\nvery bases of social order both in Church and State--alone called forth\r\nany serious action on the part of the ecclesiastical authorities against\r\nthe open expression of religious opinion. These ages, therefore, had their\r\nvarious “schools of thought.”\r\n\r\nThe most prominent feature of this awakened, religious, and scientific\r\nthought throughout Europe was the endeavour to give a rational exposition\r\nof the doctrines of the Faith, and to organize them into a scientific\r\nsystem; it pervaded more or less all the other schools of thought of these\r\nages. It will be enough to mention here the two great representatives of\r\nthe school. Peter Lombard, in the latter part of the twelfth century,\r\nwrote “Quatuor Libri Sententiarum” (Four Books of Sentences), in which he\r\narranged under their various heads the opinions of some of the older\r\nteachers, especially Augustine and Gregory the Great,[134] and of the\r\nnewer teachers, and sought to reconcile them by accurate distinctions into\r\na body of doctrine; he gathered together in compact brevity so rich a\r\nstore of matter, and treated it with so much sobriety and moderation, that\r\nhis work became a standard manual, adopted by the most distinguished\r\nteachers, who were content to teach and write commentaries on the\r\n“Sentences.” “England alone is said to have produced no less than one\r\nhundred and sixty-four writers, who illustrated this famous text-book.”\r\nThe English Franciscan friar, Alexander of Hales (died 1245), was among\r\nthe most important representatives of the scholastic theology. The\r\ngreatest master of the school, however, was Thomas Aquinas, an Italian\r\nDominican friar, who wrote in the third quarter of the thirteenth century.\r\nHis “Summa Theologica” is the greatest work of its class, and served as a\r\ntext-book to the students of Europe throughout the subsequent ages.[135]\r\n\r\nAnother school--of which Hugh, Canon of St. Victor in Paris (died 1141),\r\nwas an eminent leader--included frequently men of great intellectual\r\npower, and skilled in the scholastic theology of their time; but the bent\r\nof the school was towards spiritual contemplation and practical piety.\r\nThey drew their doctrines rather from the Bible itself and the older\r\nChurch teachers; they dwelt on the Divine perfections and on the relations\r\nof the soul to God; their religion was of the affections rather than the\r\nintellect. The college of St. Victor was for a long period a centre of\r\nthis school. Robert Pullein was an eminent representative of its teaching\r\nat Oxford. Richard the Hermit, of Hampole, popularized its teachings in\r\nthe fourteenth century in numerous tractates written in English; and its\r\ninfluence is easily recognized in many of the religious works of that and\r\nthe subsequent century. “The Imitation of Christ,” by Thomas à Kempis, a\r\ngood example of the school, is at this day the favourite devotional book\r\nof tens of thousands of our devout people.[136]\r\n\r\nOther Englishmen, who were among the most famous of the learned men of\r\nEurope, were John Duns Scotus, a Franciscan friar, who, at the end of the\r\nthirteenth century, displayed a great genius for mathematical science; and\r\nRoger Bacon (died 1292), another Franciscan, who possessed an\r\nextraordinary genius for physical science, and Occham. These, and\r\nsuch-like, were the men who ruled the thought of the time, and their\r\nteachings were eagerly studied and reproduced in the cathedral and\r\nmonastic schools, and imbibed and assimilated by the scholars; and their\r\ngeneral principles at least tinctured the teaching of the parish priests\r\nin their town parishes and country villages.\r\n\r\nThe course of reading in the Schools was four years in grammar (_i.e._\r\nLatin language and literature), rhetoric, and logic, before the student\r\ncould be admitted a Bachelor; three years in science, viz. arithmetic,\r\nmusic, geometry, and astronomy, before inception as a Master; seven years’\r\nstudy before, as a Bachelor of Theology, he could lecture on the\r\n“Sentences;”[137] and, lastly, he must study the Bible for three years,\r\nand lecture on one of the Canonical Books, before he could take his degree\r\nas a Doctor of Theology.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStudents went up to the universities at an early age (fourteen or\r\nfifteen), and they went in great numbers. In the thirteenth century there\r\nwere three thousand of them at Oxford. At first they lodged where they\r\npleased, and were under no special oversight and discipline; but soon the\r\nuniversity required that every student should be under the care of a\r\nrecognized tutor; and before long bishops and lay benefactors began to\r\nbuild hostelries or halls, and to provide stipends for students; and out\r\nof these arose the mediæval colleges, which provided a home and discipline\r\nand tutors, and pecuniary help to poor students; Merton College, at\r\nOxford, was the earliest, founded by Walter of Merton, Bishop of Rochester\r\n(1264). The friars, at an early date after their institution, sent their\r\nmore promising members to the universities; and they cultivated the study\r\nof theology, philosophy, and natural science with so much success that\r\nwithin a short time their teachers were famous in all the universities of\r\nEurope, and members of their orders were promoted to the highest offices\r\nin the Church. Among Archbishops of Canterbury, Richard of Kilwardby, a\r\nDominican, was succeeded by John of Peckham, a Franciscan.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStudents of all nations flocked to the most famous seats of learning.\r\nLatin was the language in which all instruction was given, and was the\r\n_lingua franca_ of all who pretended to learning; the students from the\r\nsame country formed themselves into national clubs for mutual society and\r\nprotection. The phrase, “The Republic of Letters,” in those days signified\r\na more real cosmopolitanism than in our days, when men go to their\r\nnational universities, and meet only their own countrymen there, and when\r\neven learned men have not the habit of colloquial Latin.\r\n\r\nOur readers may remember Bishop Latimer’s naïve piece of autobiography in\r\na sermon before the king, which affords us an example of the farmer who\r\nsent his clever son to the schools. “My father,” he says, “was a yeoman,\r\nand had no lands of his own; only he had a farm of three or four pounds by\r\nthe year at the uttermost, and hereupon he tilled so much as kept half a\r\ndozen men. He had walk for a hundred sheep, and my mother milked thirty\r\nkine. He was able, and did find the king a harness and his horse. I\r\nremember that I buckled on his harness when he went to Blackheath field.\r\nHe kept me to school, or else I had not been able to have preached before\r\nthe king’s majesty now. He married my sisters with five pounds, or twenty\r\nnobles, each, having brought them up in godliness and fear of God. He kept\r\nhospitality for his poor neighbours, and some alms he gave to the poor;\r\nand all this he did of the said farm” (“Sermons,” p. 101).\r\n\r\nBesides the youths whose fathers could afford to “keep them to school” out\r\nof their own means, the system produced a great host of poor scholars,\r\nmany of whom out of term-time returned to their homes and supported\r\nthemselves by their labour; others, with or without a special licence\r\npermitting them, travelled round the country, alone or in groups, asking\r\nfor contributions to help them to maintain themselves and complete their\r\neducation. Longfellow’s “Spanish Student” and “Hyperion” help their\r\nreaders to realize the groups of students, some thoughtful and ambitious,\r\nsome full of the gaiety of youth, wandering from town to castle, from\r\nmonastery to manor house, asking alms with a laugh and jest; and the\r\nknight and his lady gladly gave them supper and a shakedown in the hall,\r\nfor the sake of their hopeful youth; and the prior or rector gave them a\r\ndonation and a kind wish, with a wistful recollection of his own bygone\r\nstudent days; and people of all classes gave a trifle, for it was a\r\nrecognized act of piety to help poor scholars.\r\n\r\nThere are survivals to our own day. The clever Irish boys who used to be\r\npicked out by their priests and sent to St. Omer’s, where they were made\r\ninto scholars and Irish-French gentlemen--a charming type--some of whom\r\nrose to high station in their church, is a thing of the recent past. In\r\nScotland, the schoolmaster is still on the outlook for those among his\r\npeasant laddies who possess the natural qualities of a scholar; and the\r\nminister is ready to give them the higher teaching where the dominie\r\nhalts; and not only the parents are filled with ambition that the boy\r\nshould succeed, but the whole village is proud of the honour reflected\r\nupon his birthplace.\r\n\r\nAmong this crowd of ambitious youths of all classes there were sure to be\r\nsome whose career would be wrecked, by failure in intelligence, industry,\r\nand character, and these formed a rather numerous class of sham scholars\r\nand worthless clerics of whom we get glimpses from time to time.\r\n\r\n    In the Norwich Corporation records of 1521, is a copy of the\r\n    examination of Sir William Green, in whose sketch of his own life we\r\n    have a curiously detailed relation of the way in which many a poor\r\n    man’s son became a scholar and a priest. He was the son of a labouring\r\n    man, Stephen-at-Grene, at Wantlet, in Lincolnshire, and learned\r\n    grammar for two years at the village school, and then went to day\r\n    labour with his father. Afterwards he removed to Boston, where he\r\n    lived with his aunt, labouring for his living and going to school as\r\n    he had opportunity. Being evidently a clerkly lad, he was admitted to\r\n    minor orders, up to that of acolyte, by “Friar Graunt,” who was a\r\n    suffragan bishop in the diocese of Lincoln. After that, he went to\r\n    Cambridge, where he maintained himself partly by his labour, partly on\r\n    alms, and availed himself of the opportunities of learning which the\r\n    university afforded. At length he found an opportunity of going to\r\n    Rome with two monks of Whalley Abbey, probably as one of their\r\n    attendants; and there he endeavoured to obtain the order of\r\n    priesthood, which seems to have been bestowed rather indiscriminately\r\n    at Rome, and without a title; but in this he was unsuccessful. On his\r\n    return to England, he was for a short time thrown again on his labour\r\n    for his living; but, going to Cambridge, he obtained from the\r\n    vice-chancellor, Mr. Coney, a licence under seal to collect\r\n    subscriptions for one year towards an exhibition, to enable him to\r\n    complete his education and take his degree. Had he obtained money\r\n    enough, completed his education, and obtained ordination in due\r\n    course, it would have finished the story of a poor scholar in the\r\n    regular way; but he fell into bad hands, forged a new poor scholar’s\r\n    letter, using the seal of the old letter, then letters of orders with\r\n    a forged seal, and then went about begging alms as a destitute\r\n    priest;[138] and we find him in the hands of the magistrates of\r\n    Norwich under the charge of being a spy.\r\n\r\nIn the register of Lincoln diocese, in 1457, we find a record of one Hugh\r\nBernewell, an Irishman, who went about pretending to be a priest, and\r\nundertaking to make a pilgrimage to Rome, and say prayers at the _Scala\r\nCœli_, for any who would pay him. He was found to be an impostor, and was\r\nput in the pillory.[139]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next step in the career of the parish priest was his ordination. We\r\nhave seen that he might receive the minor orders with little difficulty\r\nwhile still a youth pursuing his studies; but when it came to the sacred\r\norders, he had to obtain a “title,” _i.e._ a definite place in which to\r\nexercise his ministry, and a competent maintenance to prevent the disgrace\r\nwhich pauper clergymen would bring upon the Church. The bishop who\r\nordained a man without a title was liable to maintain him out of his own\r\npurse, and there are instances of the enforcement of the liability. A\r\ncurious instance of it is recorded in the Register of Archbishop\r\nWinchelsea of Canterbury, 1297, in a decree that the executors of a\r\nbishop, who had ordained a priest without title, should provide for his\r\nmaintenance when afterwards he became, without his own fault, mutilated\r\nso that he could no longer fulfil the office of priest.\r\n\r\nBut a title was not always a cure of souls; any kind of ecclesiastical\r\nbenefice which afforded a prospect of maintenance was sufficient; for\r\nexample, membership of a convent or a hermitage. No doubt there were many\r\nyoung men of good families who desired ordination, not with a view to cure\r\nof souls, but with a view to being capable of holding ecclesiastical\r\nbenefices as the rewards of the career which they proposed to pursue in\r\nthe civil service of the Crown, or of great men. This partly accounts for\r\nthe ordinations _ad titulum patrimonii sui quo respondet se esse\r\ncontentum_ which are not uncommonly found in the Episcopal Registers, and\r\nthe similar ones _ad titulum_, of lands and of a ville of five marks of\r\nannual rent, and of sixty shillings of annual pension, and the like.[140]\r\nA great many poor men’s sons also got little pensions as titles, and then\r\ntook chantry priest’s places.\r\n\r\nThe Rules of Examination for Orders were precise and the same in all\r\ndioceses. The number of men ordained was very large, and went on rapidly\r\nincreasing through the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; for there were\r\nfour Orders to be ordained, Acolytes, Sub-deacons, Deacons, and Priests;\r\nnot only the parishes had to be supplied, but a proportion of the\r\ninhabitants of religious houses were also ordained by the bishop on the\r\npresentation of the abbot, the candidate’s position in the house being a\r\nsufficient title.[141] In these ordinations there were frequent\r\ndispensations from canonical obstacles; servile condition, illegitimate\r\nbirth, personal blemish,[142] and insufficient learning.\r\n\r\nSome of the newly-ordained were at once instituted to benefices, and\r\nlicence of non-residence was given to a large proportion of the new\r\nrectors, that they might go to school or university to acquire the\r\nlearning which they did not yet possess.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORDINATION OF A DEACON. FROM A PRINTED PONTIFICAL (471 f.\r\n2), A.D. 1520.]\r\n\r\nIn Bishop Langton’s “Lichfield Registers” we find, in the single month of\r\nFebruary, 1300, licences were given on institution for one year’s\r\nstudy, to Alexander de Verdon, Rector of Biddulph, Roger Bagod, Rector of\r\nAlvechurch, Nicholas de Aylesbury, Rector of Pattingham, Roger\r\nFitzherbert, Rector of Norbury, and Richard Birchal, Vicar of Tattenhill.\r\nIn the same month Richard Touchet, Rector of Middlewick, and Simon\r\nTouchet, of Mackworth, were sent to college for two years, and Walter de\r\nFordinghay, Rector of Mackworth, for three years. In 1309, William de\r\nDraco, a youth of fifteen, was, at the Pope’s instance, licensed to hold a\r\nbenefice, and Conrad Homerschilt, a German, Rector of Filingley, got five\r\nyears’ leave of studious absence.[143]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe will assume that the typical parish priest--whose parentage and\r\neducation at school and university we have seen, and whose fortunes we are\r\nfollowing--passed with credit the bishop’s examination, was ordained\r\nwithout having need to put in a dispensation for canonical impediments,\r\nwas instituted by the bishop without any wish for licence of\r\nnon-residence, then went off to his living, and was inducted into\r\npossession of his church by the archdeacon, with a solemn sense of the\r\nresponsibilities he undertook, and an earnest desire to fulfil his duty.\r\nIt will be convenient to us here to divide our study of his life in the\r\nparish under several headings: his house and furniture; dress and daily\r\nlife; and his duties as a parish priest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nPARSONAGE HOUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no reason to suppose that the houses of the parochial clergy\r\ndiffered from those of lay people of corresponding income and social\r\nposition, except in the one circumstance that they sometimes had to\r\nprovide for the hospitality to travellers to which we will give special\r\nconsideration hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe house of a rector, from Saxon times downwards, would be very like that\r\nof a lay lord of a small estate, but it is very difficult for us, with our\r\nideas of absolutely necessary domestic accommodation, to realize how rude\r\nand simple were then the houses of people of comparative wealth and social\r\nposition. The house consisted mainly of one room. This room, the hall, was\r\noblong in plan, constructed, except in districts where timber was scarce\r\nand stone easily obtained, of timber framework, filled in with wattle and\r\nclay, with a lofty unceiled roof. The windows were few and high up in the\r\nside walls, not glazed until comparatively modern times, but closed on\r\noccasion with shutters; a stone hearth stood in the middle of the hall,\r\nwith iron fire-dogs on which the burning logs rested. In the better class\r\nof houses there was a raised daïs at the end furthest from the door, with\r\na long rude oak table on it, and a single chair for the master of the\r\nhouse behind it; there were other tables of boards and trestles put up\r\nwhen needed, and taken away again when done with, and a couple of rude\r\nbenches and a few stools; there was a cupboard near the “dormant table,”\r\nas Chaucer calls it, on which were displayed the pewter dishes, and horn\r\ndrinking-vessels, and in better houses, perhaps, a silver salt-holder, and\r\na couple of silver drinking-cups. When there was some pretension to\r\nrefinement, the roof-timbers would be moulded, the lower part of the walls\r\nhung with tapestry, and rushes strewn on the floor by way of carpet; a low\r\nscreen of wood across the lower end of the hall at the same time made a\r\npassage (“the screens”) through the house by which people might pass to\r\nthe back premises without disturbing the company in the hall, and warded\r\noff the draught from the ever-open door. Any one of the hundreds of old\r\nhalls which remain in all parts of the country may serve as an\r\nillustration of this general plan.\r\n\r\nA separate building attached at right angles to the lower end of the hall,\r\nand opening into the screens just mentioned, contained the cellar,\r\nbuttery, and kitchen, and might be prolonged to contain other offices, as\r\na brew-house, etc. Another separate building was attached at right angles\r\nto the upper end of the hall, usually of two stories, with its gable to\r\nthe front; the lower story was often a storehouse, sometimes a “parlour,”\r\nthe upper story “the great chamber”--the special apartment of the lady of\r\nthe house, and the one retiring room from the promiscuous company in the\r\nhall. This room had perhaps a bay window in its gable, and would be\r\nfurnished with tapestry, and a few stools, a spinning-wheel, a couple of\r\ncarved oak chests, and cushions in the window-seats.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, at the end of the thirteenth century, and in the\r\nsucceeding centuries, a greater refinement of domestic customs was\r\nintroduced, and other apartments were added.[144] In the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries, the walls of the hall were built a little higher, and\r\nan upper floor put in so as to convert the roof into a sleeping loft,\r\nlighted by a couple of dormer windows; and this plan of a central hall\r\nwith a loft over, its longer side to the front, flanked by a two-story\r\nbuilding at one end with its gable to the front flush with the hall, and\r\nanother building at the other end of the hall containing the offices, was\r\nthe general plan of the houses of the middle classes of the people.\r\nThousands of them, more or less disguised by later additions, still remain\r\nall over the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of Rectory House, West Dean, Sussex.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rectory House, West Dean.]\r\n\r\nFew of the old rectory houses are left in their original condition. There\r\nis a good example of the hall at Weston Turville, Bucks.[145] The\r\nparsonage house at West Dean, Sussex, of the thirteenth century, is\r\ndescribed and figured in Turner’s “Domestic Architecture.” It is built of\r\nstone; in plan a hall with a story over it, and the soler at the upper\r\nend, approached by a stone newel stair built in a projecting buttress on\r\nthe north side. The windows of the story over the hall are lancets, those\r\nof the hall have a curious kind of tracery. The upper chamber or soler has\r\na good fireplace and chimney-piece of stone, with deeply splayed windows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pre-reformation Clergy House, Alfriston. (By kind\r\npermission of the publishers of the _Builder_.)]\r\n\r\nThere is a parsonage house at Alfriston, within three miles of Dean,\r\nSussex, of the fourteenth century, so unchanged and well preserved that it\r\nhas been made over to the National Trust for Preserving Places of Historic\r\nInterest. It has the usual hall, constructed of oak framing, the\r\ninterstices being filled with “wattle and dab,” open to the roof with\r\nlarge cambered tie-beams and moulded king-posts. At the upper end of the\r\nhall is the soler, of two stories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pre-reformation Clergy House, Alfriston. (By kind\r\npermission of the publishers of the _Builder_.)]\r\n\r\nThere are others of stone at Congresbury (Somerset), King’s Stanley\r\n(Gloucester), Wonstone (Hants.), Notgrove (Gloucester); of timber at\r\nHelmsley (Yorkshire); and many others. And, just as many farmhouses which\r\nwere once small manor houses still retain their ancient mediæval features\r\ndisguised by modern alterations, so there are many parsonage houses in\r\nwhich the original house of the fourteenth or fifteenth century still\r\nremains, and may be traced by a skilful eye amidst the subsequent\r\nadditions.\r\n\r\nWe derive our fullest information about the old parsonage houses, however,\r\nfrom literary sources, from the settlements of vicarages which describe\r\nthe old rectory house, or dictate how the new vicarage house shall be\r\nbuilt; from the old terriers which describe the then existing houses, and\r\nfrom the inventories of wills which go from room to room, naming the\r\nrooms, and detailing the furniture in them.\r\n\r\nThus a deed of 1356 describes the rectory house of Kelvedon, in Essex,\r\nexisting at that date--and how long before that date we do not know--which\r\nthe Abbot and Convent of Westminster, in the settlement of a vicarage\r\nthere, assigned to the vicar as his residence. The deed describes it as--\r\n\r\n    One hall situate in the manor of the said abbot and convent near the\r\n    said church, with a soler and chamber at one end of the hall, and with\r\n    a buttery and cellar at the other. Also one other house[146] in three\r\n    parts, namely, a kitchen with a convenient chamber in the end of the\r\n    said house for guests, and a bakehouse. Also one other house in two\r\n    parts next the gate at the entrance of the manor for a stable and\r\n    cow-house. He (the vicar) shall also have a convenient grange, to be\r\n    built within a year at the expense of the prior and convent. He shall\r\n    also have the curtilage with the garden adjoining the hall on the\r\n    north side enclosed as it is with hedges and ditches.[147]\r\n\r\nThe present vicarage house occupies the old site, and its offices,\r\ngardens, and surroundings help to illustrate this description.\r\n\r\nIn a deed of Richard of Thornely, Chaplain of Wasseford, it is stated that\r\nwhen he was presented by the Prior and Convent of Hatfield to the vicarage\r\nof Silverley, he bound himself by his own free will to build a house\r\nthere, with a hall, a chamber, and a kitchen.[148]\r\n\r\nIn 1352, the Bishop of Winchester decreed that the Prior and Convent of\r\nMerton, the impropriators of the benefice of Kingston-on-Thames, should\r\nprovide\r\n\r\n    a competent manse for the vicar, viz. a hall with two rooms, one at\r\n    one end of the hall, and the other at the other end, with a drain to\r\n    each, and a suitable kitchen with fireplace and oven, and a stable for\r\n    six horses, all covered with tiles, and completed within one year,\r\n    such place to remain to the use of the said vicar and his\r\n    successors.[149]\r\n\r\nThe deed of settlement of the vicarage of Bulmer, Essex, in 1425,\r\ndescribes the vicarage house as consisting of--\r\n\r\n    one hall with two chambers annexed, bakehouse, kitchen, and\r\n    larder-house, one chamber for the vicar’s servant, and a hay-soller\r\n    (soler = loft), with a competent garden.[150]\r\n\r\nIngrave Rectory house is described in the terrier of 1610 as--\r\n\r\n    a house containing a hall, a parlour, a buttery, two lofts, and a\r\n    study, also a kitchen, a milk-house, and a house for poultry, a barn,\r\n    a stable, and a hay-house.[151]\r\n\r\nIngatestone Rectory house, in the terrier of 1610, is described as--\r\n\r\n    a dwelling house with a hall, a parlour, and a chamber within it; a\r\n    study newly built by the then parson; a chamber over the parlour, and\r\n    another within that with a closet; without the dwelling-house a\r\n    kitchen, and two little rooms adjoining it, and a chamber over them;\r\n    two little butteries over against the hall, and next them a chamber,\r\n    and one other chamber over the same; without the kitchen there is a\r\n    dove-house, and another house built by the then parson; a barn and a\r\n    stable very ruinous.[152]\r\n\r\nHere we have an old house with hall in the middle, parlour and chamber at\r\none end, and butteries and kitchen at the other, in the middle of later\r\nadditions.\r\n\r\nMr. Froude gives an inventory, dated 1534, of the goods of the Rector of\r\nAllington, Kent, from which we take only the incidental description of the\r\nhouse which contained them.[153]\r\n\r\n    It consisted of hall, parlour, and chamber over the parlour,\r\n    stairs-head beside the parson’s bed-chamber, parson’s lodging-chamber,\r\n    study, chamber behind the chimney, chamber next adjoining westward,\r\n    buttery, priest’s chamber [perhaps for the rector’s chaplain[154]],\r\n    servants’ chamber, kitchen, mill-house, boulting house, larder,\r\n    entries, women’s chamber; gate-house, still beside the gate; barn next\r\n    the gate; cartlage, barn next the church, garden-house, court.\r\n\r\nHere, again, we recognize the hall in the middle, the parlour and chamber\r\nover it at one end, with an adjoining study on the ground floor, and a\r\nchamber over it, as at Ingatestone, and at the other end the buttery,\r\nkitchen, larder, mill, boulting houses, with a priest’s chamber, and a\r\nservants’ chamber over it, women’s chamber over the kitchen, etc.; and we\r\nobserve that the additional chambers for the master of the house and his\r\nfamily are grouped about the parlour and great chamber, while the chambers\r\nfor guests and servants are added to the kitchen and offices at the lower\r\nend of the hall. These two projections backward would partially enclose a\r\ncourtyard at the back of the hall.\r\n\r\nThe rectory at Little Bromley, Essex, is described (1610) as--\r\n\r\n    a large parsonage house compass’d with a mote, a gate-house, with a\r\n    large chamber, and a substantial bridge of timber adjoining it; a\r\n    little yard, an orchard and a little garden all within the mote,\r\n    which, together with the circuit of the house, contains about half an\r\n    acre of ground; and without the mote there is a yard in which there is\r\n    another gate-house, and a stable, and a hay-house adjoining, also a\r\n    barn of twenty-five yards long, and nine yards wide, and about\r\n    seventy-nine and a half acres of glebe land.[155]\r\n\r\nNorth Benfleet Rectory is described as consisting of--\r\n\r\n    a hall with a loft over it, two cross ends, with lofts and chambers, a\r\n    kitchen with a hen-house, a barn and a little stable at the end of it,\r\n    built in ancient time, a garden made, an orchard planned, a milk-house\r\n    and a dove-house.[156]\r\n\r\nWest Hanningfield is described as--\r\n\r\n    one dwelling-house tiled, having in it a hall with a loft over it for\r\n    corn, a closet in the hall, two butteries, with a loft over them for\r\n    servants’ lodging, an entry, a large parlour, with two lodging\r\n    chambers over it for servants, a study new built, also a kitchen\r\n    tiled, with a corn-loft over it, a boulting-house with a cheese-loft\r\n    over it, a brew-house newly set up, with a fair corn-lift over it, and\r\n    a garret over that, and a hen-house tiled at the end of it, a barn\r\n    newly built, and a porch thatched, a hay-house at the end of it, a\r\n    hogs’-coat boarded, a stable, a quern-house, two small cotes to fat\r\n    fowl in, a cow-house newly built, with a cart-house at the end of it;\r\n    another cart-house newly built with a room over it to hold hay; one\r\n    large hay-house with a cart-house at the end of it; another cart-house\r\n    newly built; a gate-house, wherein is a milk-house, with a loft over\r\n    it for cheese and fish; the site of the house and yards with two\r\n    gardens contains two roods.[157]\r\n\r\nWe easily recognize the normal plan of the house; the large accommodation\r\noutside--some of it new--for carts and hay, and for the storing of corn\r\ninside the house, indicates that the rector was farming on rather a large\r\nscale.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the foregoing description of the vicarage house at\r\nKelvedon, Essex, that a special chamber was provided for the\r\nentertainment of guests, and at Kingston-on-Thames a stable for six horses\r\nwas attached to the vicarage house. This was no doubt needed because the\r\none was on the high-road from London into Essex, and the other on the\r\nhigh-road from London into Surrey, and so westward, and the accommodation\r\nwas needed for travellers. In those times there were no inns at convenient\r\ndistances along the main roads of the country, nor even in the towns,\r\nexcept in some of the largest. Few people travelled except on business, so\r\nthat hospitality was little liable to abuse; and travellers sought\r\nentertainment for man and horse at the monasteries and the parsonage\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\nIt was regarded as a duty of the clergy to “entertain strangers,” and to\r\nbe “given to hospitality;” and the duty was fulfilled ungrudgingly,\r\nwithout fee or reward, and entailed a heavy charge upon the income of the\r\nclergy. One of the common reasons which a monastery[158] alleges for\r\nasking the bishop to allow them to impropriate an additional benefice is\r\nthat their expenditure on the entertainment of travellers is beyond their\r\nmeans; the country rectors, also, in their remonstrance against the\r\nexactions of the popes, complain that they will be left without means to\r\nfulfil their duty of hospitality;[159] and the matter is very frequently\r\nalluded to and illustrated by examples in mediæval history. Off the great\r\nroads, the rector would put an extra pewter platter and horn drinking-cup\r\non the board for an accidental passenger who claimed hospitality--he\r\nbrought his own knife, and there were no forks--and gave him a liberal\r\n“shakedown” of clean straw, or at best a flock mattress, in a corner of\r\nthe hall. But, just as in the monasteries it was necessary to have a\r\nspecial guest-house for travellers, so that they should not interfere with\r\nthe seclusion of the religious, so it would seem at the rectories along\r\nthe great roads it was necessary that there should be special provision\r\nmade for the frequent influx of guests. This is the explanation of the\r\nchamber for guests at Kelvedon, and for the vicar’s six-stall stable at\r\nKingston.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is clear that some of the rectory houses thus described were like some\r\nof the smaller manor houses, enclosed by moat or wall, and the entrance\r\nprotected by a gate-house, and that the house contained all the\r\naccommodation needed by a small squire.[160] But there were smaller\r\nhouses more suited to the means of a poor vicar or a parish chaplain.[161]\r\nThus, on the settlement of the Vicarage of Great Bentley, Essex, in 1323,\r\nit was required that a competent house should be built for the vicar, with\r\na sufficient curtilage, where the parish chaplain has been used to abide.\r\nAt the settlement of the Vicarage of St. Peter’s, Colchester, the\r\nimpropriators, the Convent of St. Botolph, were required to prepare a\r\ncompetent house for the vicar in the ground of the churchyard, where a\r\nhouse was built for the parish chaplain. At Radwinter, Essex, in 1610,\r\nthere were two houses attached to the benefice, on the south side of the\r\nchurch towards the west end, one called “the Great Vicarage, and in\r\nancient time the _Domus Capellanorum_, and the other the Less Vicarage,”\r\nwhich latter “formerly served for the ease of the parson; and, as appears\r\nby evidence, first given to the end that if any of the parish were sick,\r\nthe party might be sure to find the parson or his curate near the church,\r\nready to go and visit him.” There are little houses in some churchyards\r\nwhich may have been houses for the parish chaplain. At Laindon, Essex, a\r\nsmall timber-house is built on to the west end of the church.[162] The\r\nChapel of our Lady at Great Horkesley, Essex, has the west end walled off\r\nand divided into two stories for a priest’s residence.[163]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Laindon Church, Essex.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe question of dilapidations of the parsonage house and its dependent\r\nbuildings is not a matter of much general interest, but it was then, as it\r\nis now, of much practical importance to the beneficed clergy, and it is\r\nworth while to say a few words about it. We find examples in the episcopal\r\nregisters which we assume represent the universal practice.\r\n\r\nIn the register of John de Grandisson, Bishop of Exeter, June 21, 1328, a\r\ncommission was issued to inquire into the defects in the church and its\r\nfurniture and the manse of the Rectory of Lydeford, by the carelessness\r\nand neglect of Stephen Waleys, late deceased. The commissioners were\r\nlaudably prompt in action, for, on the 4th July, they made their return of\r\ndefects, etc., to the amount of 42_s._; and the bishop at once issued his\r\nmandate that the amount should be paid out of the goods of the defunct\r\nrector.[164] There was a similar process in the same year at Didesham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nFURNITURE AND DRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a continual fight going on all through the Middle Ages between\r\nthe rulers of the Church and the rest of their brethren on the subject of\r\nthe ordinary costume of the clergy. It seems to have been a part of the\r\nHildebrandine plan of making the secular clergy a kind of semi-monastic\r\norder. Wherever there is a strong canon on enforcing celibacy, there we\r\nare sure to find another canon enjoining a well-marked tonsure, and\r\nforbidding long hair, and worldly fashions of dress and ornaments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Consecration of Archbishop Thomas Becket. (MS., Royal 2 B.,\r\nvii.)]\r\n\r\nIt is not worth while to trouble the reader with a long series of laws and\r\ncanons; it will be enough to quote one which condescends to be\r\nargumentative and persuasive as well as minatory. It is from the\r\n“Injunctions of John Stratford, Archbishop of Canterbury,” made at St.\r\nPaul’s Cathedral, in A.D. 1342.\r\n\r\n    The external costume often shows the internal character and condition\r\n    of persons; and although the behaviour of clerks ought to be an\r\n    example and pattern of lay people, yet the abuses of clerks, which\r\n    have prevailed more than usual in these days, in tonsure, clothing,\r\n    horse trappings, and other things, have created an abominable scandal\r\n    among the people; because persons holding ecclesiastical dignities,\r\n    rectories, honourable prebends, and benefices with cure of souls, even\r\n    men in Holy Orders, scorn to wear the tonsure, which is the crown of\r\n    the kingdom of heaven and of perfection, and distinguish themselves by\r\n    hair spreading to the shoulders in an effeminate manner, and walk\r\n    about clad in a military rather than a clerical dress, with an outer\r\n    habit very short and tight-fitting, but excessively wide, with long\r\n    sleeves which do not touch the elbow; their hair curled and perfumed\r\n    (?), their hoods with lappets of wonderful length; with long beards,\r\n    rings on their fingers, and girded belts studded with precious stones\r\n    of wonderful size, their purses enamelled and gilt with various\r\n    devices, and knives openly hanging at them like swords, their boots of\r\n    red and green peaked and cut in many ways; with housings to their\r\n    saddles, and horns hanging from their necks; their capes and cloaks so\r\n    furred, in rash disregard of the canons, that there appears little or\r\n    no distinction between clergymen and laymen; whereby they render\r\n    themselves unworthy through their demerits of the privilege of their\r\n    order and profession. Wherefore we decree that they who hold\r\n    ecclesiastical benefices in our province, especially if ordained to\r\n    Holy Orders, do wear the garments and tonsure proper to their\r\n    condition, but if they offend by using any of the foresaid abuses, too\r\n    wide sleeves or too short outer coats, or long hair, or untonsured\r\n    head, or long beard, and do not when admonished desist within six\r\n    months, they shall incur suspension from their office until absolved\r\n    by the bishop--to whom their absolution is reserved--when they shall\r\n    forfeit a sixth of one year’s income from their ecclesiastical\r\n    benefices to the poor of their benefices; and if while the suspension\r\n    lasts, they perform any act of their office they shall be deprived.\r\n    [On the other hand] unbeneficed clerks publicly and habitually\r\n    carrying themselves like clerks, if they exceed in these things, and\r\n    do not, when admonished, correct themselves within four months, shall\r\n    not be capable of holding a benefice. If living in universities, and\r\n    bearing themselves as clerks, they offend in these respects, they\r\n    shall be incapable of ecclesiastical degrees or honours. Yet we intend\r\n    not to abridge clerks of open wide surcoats called table-coats with\r\n    fitting sleeves to be worn at seasonable times and places, nor of\r\n    short and close garments while travelling in the country at their own\r\n    discretion. Ordinaries are commanded to make inquiry by themselves or\r\n    by others every year, and to see that this canon is observed.[165]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARCHDEACON, CLERGY IN SECULAR COSTUME. XIV. CENT. MS., 6 E\r\nVII., f. 197.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARCHDEACON AND CLERGY. XIV. CENT. MS., 6 E VI., f. 132.]\r\n\r\nWe shall see hereinafter that by ages of worrying legislation the canons\r\nsucceeded in compelling the clergy to keep their wives _in petto_; but the\r\nsumptuary canons were a dead failure.\r\n\r\nThe authorities made attempts to get them observed. It is related that at\r\na certain Visitation, the bishop ordered the canon to be read and then had\r\nthe hair of the clergy cut short on the spot. Grostete of Lincoln refused\r\nto institute to a cure of souls a deacon who came to him untonsured,\r\ndressed in scarlet, and wearing rings, in the habit and carriage of a\r\nlayman, or rather of a knight, and almost illiterate.[166] Some of the\r\nvicars of York Cathedral[167] were presented to the bishop in 1362 “for\r\nbeing in the habit of going through the city in short tunics ornamentally\r\ntrimmed, with knives and basilards hanging at their girdles.” Similarly,\r\nin the diocese of Bath and Wells, from an inquiry made by Bishop\r\nBeckington (1443-1465), we learn that the vicars of the cathedral affected\r\nthe dress of the laity: they had the collars of their doublets high and\r\nstanding up like lawyers, and the collars of their gowns and cloaks very\r\nshort and low; against which practices the bishop made ordinances.\r\n\r\nMany of the clergy, however, persisted in wearing the same sort of clothes\r\nas their neighbours of similar position in society, very much as they do\r\nnow, with little differences which were enough to mark their clerical\r\ncharacter. They wore the tonsure--the complaint was they would not make\r\nit larger, like the monks; they wore a special head-covering--or some of\r\nthem did--which is mentioned in their Wills as a “priest’s bonnet;”[168]\r\nbut they persisted in wearing their hair cut like other people’s, and\r\nshort-skirted coats when it was convenient; their ordinary dress was of\r\nred or blue, or half a dozen other colours, instead of grey or black; and\r\nnothing could prevent them from wearing “zones” ornamented with silver,\r\nand a basilard--a hanger, or short sword--hanging at their silver zone,\r\ninstead of a girdle of leather and a pair of beads. The mention of\r\ncoloured gowns (togas) and of silver zones and basilards[168] in the wills\r\nof the clergy is so general as to produce the conviction that the wearing\r\nof them by the more well-to-do of the secular clergy was almost universal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the illuminated MSS. of all ages there are to be found representations\r\nof the secular clergy not only in their official robes, but also in their\r\nordinary dress. The best and clearest examples of these which we have met\r\nwith are in the Catalogue[169] of Benefactors of the Abbey of St. Albans,\r\nalready quoted, and we are able to give engravings[170] of some of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sir Richard de Threton.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sir Bartholomew de Wendon.]\r\n\r\nOn fol. 100 v. is a portrait of one Lawrence, a clerk, who is dressed in a\r\nbrown gown (toga); another clerk, William by name, is in a scarlet gown\r\nand hood. On fol. 93 v. Leofric, a deacon, is in a blue gown and hood. The\r\nfirst of the accompanying engravings from fol. 105 represents Dom.\r\nRicardus de Threton, sacerdos--Sir Richard Threton, priest--who was\r\nexecutor of Sir Robert de Thorp, knight, formerly chancellor of the king,\r\nwho gave twenty marks to the convent. In the illumination, the gown and\r\nhood are of full bright blue, lined with white; the under sleeves which\r\nappear at the wrists are of the same colour; and the shoes are red. The\r\nnext illustration from fol. 106 v. represents Dom. Bartholomeus de\r\nWendone, rector of the church of Thakreston, and the character of the face\r\nleads to the conclusion that it is a portrait, and to the conjecture that\r\nall the others were intended to be so. His gown, hood, and sleeves are\r\nscarlet, with black shoes. Another rector, on fol. 105, Dom. Johannes\r\nRodland, rector of the church of Todyngton, has a green gown and scarlet\r\nhood. Still another rector of the church of Little Waltham is represented\r\nat half length in pink gown and purple hood. On fol. 108 v. is the\r\nfull-length portrait of Dom. Rogerus, chaplain of the chapel of the Earl\r\nof Warwick at Flamsted; over a scarlet gown, of the same fashion as those\r\nin the preceding pictures, he wears a pink cloak lined with blue; the hood\r\nis scarlet of the same suit as the gown; the buttons at the shoulder of\r\nthe cloak are white (perhaps silver), the shoes red. It will be observed\r\nthat they all wear the moustache and beard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sir Roger, Chaplain.]\r\n\r\nThe priest on horseback represents John Ball, who was concerned in Wat\r\nTyler’s rebellion. He is in a churchyard, preaching from the pulpit of his\r\nsaddle to a crowd of people on the left side of the picture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe subject receives some illustration from literary sources; the\r\n“Instructions to Parish Priests” enjoins--\r\n\r\n  In honeste clothes thow muste gon\r\n  Basdard ne bawdryke were thou non.\r\n\r\nBut “Piers Plowman” notes their contrary practice. It would be better, he\r\nsays--\r\n\r\n  If many a priest bare for their baselards and their brooches\r\n  A pair of beads in their hand and a book under their arm.\r\n  Sire John and Sire Geffrey hath a girdle of silver,\r\n  A baselard and a knife, with botons over gilt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Ball, priest. (From MS. of Froissart’s “Chronicle.”)]\r\n\r\nA little later he speaks of proud priests habited in patlocks (a short\r\njacket worn by laymen), with peaked shoes and large knives or daggers.\r\n\r\nIn the poems of John Audelay, in the fifteenth century, a parish priest is\r\ndescribed in--\r\n\r\n  His girdle harneshed with silver, his baselard hangs by.\r\n\r\nExamples will be found in the Wills and Inventories, which we have placed\r\nat the end of this chapter (p. 173, etc.). We may add here that the silver\r\nornaments of these zones were probably plates more or less ornamented with\r\nrepoussé work and sometimes with enamel and precious stones; that the\r\nplates must have been of considerable substance is indicated by the\r\nfollowing--\r\n\r\n    Thomas Sufwyk, Rector of Burton Noveray (not dated--c. 1390), leaves\r\n    to his parish church his great missal and best vestment, and also his\r\n    best silver zone to make a chalice.[171]\r\n\r\nSometimes a clergyman had not only a basilard habitually hanging at his\r\ngirdle, but also a sword for use on occasion. Chaucer says--\r\n\r\n  Bucklers brode and swerdes long\r\n  Baudrike with baselardes kene\r\n  Sech toles about her necke they hong:\r\n  With Antichrist seche prestes been.\r\n\r\nRobert Newby, Rector of Whyttchurche, and official of the Archdeacon of\r\nOxford, in his will made in 1412, leaves to his brother his best sword,\r\nand to his niece his scarlet gown;[172] and in the wills subsequently\r\ngiven it will be seen that the Vicar of Gaynford, in 1412, leaves his best\r\nsuit of armour and all his arrows; the Rector of Scrayningham, in 1414,\r\nleaves a suit of armour; and the dean of the collegiate church at Auckland\r\nleaves his best sword and a complete suit of armour.[173]\r\n\r\nThere are some quaint illustrations of these offending clergymen in the\r\nMSS. so often quoted here, Royal 6 E. VI., and 6 E. VII. _Clerici\r\npugnantes in duello_ at 6 E. VI., f. 302 _verso_; _Clericus venator_ at f.\r\n303 _verso_. Under the title _De habitu Clericorum_, in 6 E. VII. f. 197,\r\nthere are three clerics on the left properly habited in red tunic and blue\r\ncloak and blue tunic and red cloak, and on the right three startling\r\nexamples of the costume against which the Canons wage war, of short tunics\r\nand belted swords. See Plate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHere are some brief extracts from various wills[174] which bear upon the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n    In the Bury St. Edmunds Wills, Adam de Stanton, a chaplain, A.D. 1370,\r\n    bequeaths one girdle with purse and knife valued at 5_s._, a\r\n    considerable sum in those days. In the York wills, John Wyndhill,\r\n    Rector of Arnecliffe, A.D. 1431, leaves an amber pair of beads, such\r\n    as Piers Plowman says a priest ought “to bear in his hand, and a book\r\n    under his arm;” and, curiously enough, in the next sentence, he leaves\r\n    an English book of “Piers Plowman;” but he does not seem to have been\r\n    much influenced by the popular poet’s invectives, for he goes on to\r\n    bequeath two green gowns, and one of murrey, and one of sanguine\r\n    colour, besides two of black, all trimmed with various furs; also one\r\n    girdle of sanguine silk ornamented with silver gilded; and another\r\n    zone of green and white, ornamented with silver gilded; and he also\r\n    leaves his best silver girdle and a baselard with ivory and silver\r\n    handle. John Gilby, Rector of Knesale, A.D. 1434-35, leaves a red toga\r\n    furred with bryce, a black zone of silk with gilt bars, and a zone\r\n    ornamented with silver. J. Bagale, Rector of All Saints, York, A.D.\r\n    1438, leaves a little basilard with a zone harnessed with silver to\r\n    Sir T. Astell, a chaplain. W. Duffield, a chantry priest at York, A.D.\r\n    1443, leaves a black zone silvered, a purse called a “gypsire,” and a\r\n    white purse of “burdeux.” W. Swerd, chaplain, leaves to H. Hobshot a\r\n    hawk-bag, and to W. Day, parochial chaplain of Calton, a pair of\r\n    hawk-bag rings, and to J. Sarle, chaplain, “my ruby zone silvered, and\r\n    my toga furred with bevers;” and to the wife of J. Bridlington a ruby\r\n    purse of satin. R. Rollerton, provost of the church of Beverley, A.D.\r\n    1450, leaves a “toga lunata” with a red hood, a toga and hood of\r\n    violet, a long toga and hood of black trimmed with martrons, and a\r\n    toga and hood of violet. J. Clyft, chaplain, A.D. 1455, leaves a zone\r\n    of silk ornamented with silver.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts from wills of clergymen are full of points of\r\ninterest, which want of space compels us to leave, without note or\r\ncomment, to the reader’s discrimination:--\r\n\r\n    Roger de Kyrby, Perpetual Vicar of Gaynford, 1412, leaves his body to\r\n    be buried in the choir of his parish church, near the altar, on the\r\n    south side [where it still lies, with an inscription on a brass plate\r\n    on the stone which covers his grave]. To a priest to celebrate for his\r\n    soul and the souls of all the faithful departed for three years after\r\n    his burial, £15.

He leaves to the chapel of Castle Barnard a\r\n    “Legenda Aurea” to Sir John Drawlace, junior chaplain, a book which is\r\n    called “Gemma Ecclesiæ,” and all his other books he gives and\r\n    bequeaths to William de Kirkby, son of Ada de Kyrkby, my late brother,\r\n    “and this if it so happen that he shall have been made a presbyter,\r\n    but if not they shall be sold and the price of them given for my\r\n    soul,” as his executor shall think best. He leaves to Sir Thomas of\r\n    Langton, chaplain, a toga of sanguine color furred; a chalice worth\r\n    40_s._, or 40_s._ of English money (_monetæ Angliæ_), to keep up the\r\n    altar light of the blessed Mary of Castle Barnard. He leaves to\r\n    William, his brother, a horse, viz. Bay, and 20_s._; to Thomas de\r\n    Kyrkby, his cousin (_cognatus_), 6 stone of wool and 2 marks; to\r\n    Richard de Kyrkby, his _cognatus_, a cow, viz. the best, and a bed\r\n    suited to his condition, and 4 stone of wool, with 20_s._; to\r\n    Elizabeth, his _cognata_, a younger cow, a basin and ewer and a bed\r\n    suited to her, and 2 stone of wool, with 13_s._ 4_d._ To Thomas of\r\n    Gedworth, his chamberlain, a grey horse, a cow, a red bed, and all his\r\n    arrows, a best hauberk, a “brestplate,” and a pair of vambraces and\r\n    also of rerebraces, a pair of “Whysshewes Grenyce,” a basinet with\r\n    aventale, and a pair of gauntlets of plate, and 20_s._ He leaves to\r\n    Henry Smyth 9 matrices (ewes?), with 5 lambs, or the price of them,\r\n    and two pair of sheets, and 6_s._ 8_d._ He leaves to Thomas de Kyrkby,\r\n    clerk, a green toga and 6_s._ 8_d._ To Alice Kyrkby, his brother’s\r\n    widow, 12 best silver spoons worth 36_s._, and a covered piece of\r\n    silver (_unam peciam coopertam argenteam_) ... and a best bed, with 4\r\n    marks of lawful money (_monetæ legalis_). He leaves to John Drawlace,\r\n    junior, chaplain, a silver piece not covered, and 6 silver spoons, and\r\n    a best toga. To Thomas Sowrale, chaplain, another toga, viz. of\r\n    Sendry, and a piece not covered, and 6 silver spoons. The rest of all\r\n    my goods he gives and bequeaths to the foresaid John Drawlace and\r\n    Thomas Sowrale, chaplains.

He leaves, among other things, a ring of gold with a\r\n    dark ruby in it, and another gold ring with a red seal of an image;\r\n    180 ounces of plate at 5_s._ the ounce, and in money and gold, £116.\r\n\r\n    John Honynghym, Rector of Waldegrave, 1417, leaves 100_s._ for the\r\n    making of a vestment for use at the high altar of the church of St.\r\n    Peter, in Walgraf, London. He leaves his “best bible,” which begins In\r\n    S{o} filio dei in actibus [_sic_], also his portiforium of the Use of\r\n    York. He leaves to William Bryht, Rector of S. Michael’s, Cornhill, a\r\n    gilt zone, which is in his hospitium in London, as recompense for\r\n    having kept a book of his called “Gorham Copwood”; and leaves his\r\n    sword to Nicholas Dixon. He leaves a book called “Speculum Curatorum,”\r\n    a book of sermons which the late Prior of Bartholomew’s composed,\r\n    Gorham super Mattheum, Bartholomeus de Casibus, his great missal, and\r\n    great new portiforium.\r\n\r\n    Robert Newby, Rector of Whyttchurche, and official of the Archdeacon\r\n    of Oxford, 1412, leaves to his brother his sword, etc., and to his\r\n    daughter his scarlet gown.\r\n\r\n    Thomas de la Mare, Canon of York, A.D. 1258, bequeaths 2 falcons to\r\n    his brother and cousin. He mentions his falconer among his servants,\r\n    and leaves him a “laner” and 20_s._ He had several horses, the names\r\n    of some being given; one was “Turnebull,” another, “Bayard de\r\n    Wirethorp,” and a third, “Morell de Welwick.”\r\n\r\n    Says the author of “Dives and Pauper,” “These men of holy church that\r\n    buckle their shoes of silver and use great silver harness in their\r\n    girdles and knives, and men of religion--monks and canons and such\r\n    like--that use great ouches of silver and gold on their capes to\r\n    fasten their hoods against the wind, and ride on high horses with\r\n    saddles harnessed with gold and silver more pompously than lords, are\r\n    strong thieves and do great sacrilege, so spending the goods of holy\r\n    church on vanity and pride, in lust of the flesh, by which things the\r\n    poor should live.”\r\n\r\nSome of these clergymen, it will be noticed, had one black toga, not for\r\nusual wear in Divine service, for we shall see elsewhere that the clergy\r\nwore their albes over the red and blue gowns of ordinary use, but perhaps\r\nfor mourning occasions. Thus, in the presentations of York Cathedral, in\r\n1519, “we thynke it were convenient that whene we fetche a corse to the\r\nchurche, that we shulde be in our blak abbettes mornyngly (habits\r\nmourningly) w{t} our hodes of the same of our hedes, as is used in many\r\nother places.”\r\n\r\nThe use by the clergy of clothes of a dark colour was probably coming in\r\nin the latter part of the fifteenth century. Holinshed, the chronicler of\r\nElizabeth, attributes this change to the influence of the universities:\r\n\r\n    Before the universities bound their graduates to a stable attire,\r\n    afterwards usurped also even by the blind Sir Johns, “the clergy wore\r\n    garments of a light hue, as yellow, red, green, etc., with their shoes\r\n    piked, their hair crisped, their girdles armed with silver, their\r\n    shoes, spurs, bridles, etc., buckled with like metal, their apparel\r\n    (for the most part) of silk, and richly furred, their caps laced and\r\n    buttoned with gold.”[182]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nFABRIC AND FURNITURE OF CHURCHES, AND OFFICIAL COSTUME OF PRIESTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to describe the churches of mediæval England, for\r\nhappily they still exist of all periods and styles, from the rude Saxon\r\nchurch built of split oak or chestnut trunks, at Greenstead, in Essex,\r\ndown to the noble perpendicular churches of the close of the fifteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nWe may, however, make two remarks upon them. First, the comparative\r\nmagnitude and sublimity of the churches was far greater in the times when\r\nthey were built. The contrast between the village church and the cots of\r\nthe peasantry around it, and even the small, lowly, half-timber manor\r\nhouse in its neighbourhood; the contrast between the town churches and the\r\nnarrow streets of timber houses; still more the contrast between the great\r\ncathedrals and monastic churches and all the habitations of men; fills us\r\nwith admiration of the splendid genius of the men who designed them, and\r\nthe large-minded devotion of the men who caused them to be built.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Saffron Walden Church, Essex.]\r\n\r\nThe second remark which we have to make is that, though we have the old\r\nchurches, they are, for the most part, stripped of all their ancient\r\ndecorations and furnishing; and that it requires some ecclesiological\r\nknowledge and some power of imagination to realize their ancient beauty.\r\nIf we want to replace before the mind’s eye the sort of church in which a\r\nfourteenth or fifteenth century rector or vicar said the Divine service\r\ncontinually, we shall have the advantage of finding the church still\r\nexisting, perhaps with very little alteration in its general architectural\r\noutline; but we shall have to imagine the walls covered with fresco\r\npainting of Old and New Testament story; the windows filled with gem-like\r\nglass; the chancel screens and the rood loft with its sacred figures; the\r\nchantry chapels; the altar tombs with effigies of knight and lady; the\r\nlights twinkling before altar, rood and statue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Market Harborough Church, Leicestershire.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chapel of Edward the Confessor, Westminster Abbey.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe shall see from the Constitution of Archbishop Gray, quoted below, that\r\nthe parishioners were, by ancient custom, liable for the maintenance and\r\nrepair of the body and tower of their church; the fifth of the\r\n“extravagants” of Stratford, Archbishop of York (1342),[183] records that\r\nthis was done by means of a proportionate tax on the estates and farms of\r\nthe parish. From the records of bishops’ Visitations, we learn, further,\r\nthat the bishops exercised greater power in the matter of church building\r\nin old times than they do now. They had not only the power to require that\r\nthe church should be kept in good repair, but that, where necessary, it\r\nshould be enlarged. Thus, Bishop Stapledon (1309) orders the parishioners\r\nof Ilfracombe, since the church is not capable of holding all the\r\nparishioners, to enlarge it by lengthening the body of the church by 24\r\nfeet at least, and adding two aisles, within two years, under a penalty of\r\n£40.[184]\r\n\r\nAt a Visitation of Sturton parish church, in 1314, in the time of the same\r\nbishop, it was returned that, in addition to defects in the furniture, the\r\nchurch is too small (_strictus_) and dark; the nave of the church\r\nlikewise. Therefore, “the lord bishop enjoins the rectors, vicar, and\r\nparishioners, that they cause the said defects to be made good, according\r\nto what belongs to them severally, before the next feast of St. Michael,\r\nunder penalty of £20 to the fabric of the [cathedral] Church of Exeter;\r\nexcept the construction of the new chancel and the enlargement of the\r\nchurch, and they to be done before St. Michael day twelve-month.”[185]\r\n\r\nFrom the thirteenth century we have full information of the furniture and\r\nutensils, vestments, and books which the canons required to be provided in\r\nevery church for the performance of Divine service and the ministration of\r\nthe offices of the Church. Walter Gray, Archbishop of York, c. 1250, made\r\na constitution which we subjoin; and similar lists occur from time to\r\ntime, for both provinces, in visitation inquiries, inventories and\r\nconstitutions;[186] _e.g._ in the Constitutions of Robert of Winchelsea,\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, 1305.\r\n\r\n    Since much altercation has arisen between some of the rectors and\r\n    vicars and their parishioners about the various ecclesiastical\r\n    ornaments as to what it belonged to the rectors or their vicars to\r\n    provide and maintain and what to the parishioners, we ordain and\r\n    appoint that the parishioners provide a chalice, missal, the principal\r\n    vestment of the church, viz. a chasuble, white albe, amice, stole,\r\n    maniple, zone, with three towels, a corporal, and other decent\r\n    vestments for the deacon and sub-deacon, according to the means of the\r\n    parishioners and of the church, together with a principal silk cope\r\n    for chief festivals, and with two others for the rulers of the choir\r\n    in the foresaid festivals, a processional cross and another smaller\r\n    cross for the dead, and a bier for the dead, a vase for holy water, an\r\n    osculatory, a candlestick for the Paschal candle, a thurible, a\r\n    lantern with a bell, a Lent veil, two candlesticks for the taper\r\n    bearers; of books, a Legendary, Antiphonary, Gradual, Psalter,\r\n    Topiary, Ordinale, Missal, Manual; a frontal to the great altar, three\r\n    surplices, a suitable pyx for the “Corpus Christi,” a banner for the\r\n    Rogations, great bells with their ropes, a holy font with fastening, a\r\n    chrismatory, images in the church, and the principal image in the\r\n    church of the person to whom the church is dedicated, the repair of\r\n    books and vestments so often as they require repair; and in addition\r\n    to all the aforesaid things a light in the church, the repair of the\r\n    nave of the church, with its bell-tower, internally and externally,\r\n    viz. with glass windows, with the enclosure of the cemetery, with\r\n    other things belonging to the nave of the church, and other things\r\n    which by custom belong to the parishioners. To the rectors or vicars\r\n    belong all other things according to various ordinances, viz. the\r\n    principal chancel with its repairs both in walls and roofs and glass\r\n    windows belonging to the same, with desks and forms and other\r\n    ornaments suitable, so that with the prophet they may be able to sing,\r\n    “Lord, I have loved the honour of Thy house,” etc. As to the manse of\r\n    the rectory and its repair, and other things which are not written in\r\n    this book, let the rectors or vicars know that they may be compelled\r\n    by the ordinary of the place, to do according to this constitution and\r\n    others in this case provided.[187]\r\n\r\nThis is the formal catalogue of the minimum which the law required the\r\nparson and the parishioners to provide and maintain. But people were not\r\nsatisfied with doing only what they were obliged to do. A considerable\r\nnumber of inventories exist of the treasures which had gradually\r\naccumulated as the gifts of pious benefactors to the cathedrals and\r\nchurches: shrines, reliquaries, statues, crosses, mitres, pastoral staves,\r\nlamps and candlesticks, chalices, patens, pyxes, paxes, censers,\r\nprocessional crosses of gold and silver, often set with precious stones;\r\naltar cloths, hangings, palls,[188] vestments of the costliest fabrics,\r\nmany of them embroidered, and often ornamented with precious stones. When\r\nwe add the paintings of stained and sculptured marble, and carved woodwork\r\nof the fabric, and the monuments with their recumbent statues, and call to\r\nmind that the best art of the period was devoted to these works, we\r\nrecognize that the churches of the country were treasures of art. Even the\r\nhumblest village churches often possessed noble tombs of the local lords,\r\nand their gifts of ornaments of costly material and fine workmanship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROCESSION OF BISHOPS WITH CROSS BEARER, THURIFER, HOLY\r\nWATER BEARER, PRIESTS, CANONS AND BISHOPS. FROM THE XV. CENT. MS.,\r\nTIBERIUS, B VIII., f. 43.]\r\n\r\nIf we wish to see our priests as they ministered in church, it will be\r\nnecessary to describe the vestments which were worn by them in those\r\ndays.[189]\r\n\r\nIt is a little doubtful what they wore at the very beginning of our\r\nEnglish Church history. The British bishops, no doubt, from early times\r\ndown to the sixth century, wore the white tunic with long sleeves, which\r\nfrom its general colour was called the albe. The bishops and priests of\r\nthe Celtic school who clung to the old usages were probably still wearing\r\nthe pallium when Augustine came to Kent. But about that time the pallium\r\nwas being superseded by a newer vestment called the planeta or chasuble, a\r\ncircle of linen or other material with a hole in the middle through which\r\nthe head was passed, so that the garment fell in folds all round the\r\nperson. Very likely Augustine and the Continental school of clergy wore\r\nthis new garment, and it would be adopted by the Celtic school when they\r\naccepted the Continental usages. The chasuble continued to be worn at the\r\naltar down to the end of the Middle Ages with a slight modification in\r\nshape; the voluminous folds in which it was gathered over the arms, when\r\nthe hands were in use, were practically inconvenient, and so the circle\r\ncame to be contracted into an oval, and then the ends of the oval were\r\nshaped to a point.\r\n\r\nThe orarium, which afterwards came to be called the stole, was originally\r\na prayer-veil worn over the head by the priests and people of heathen Rome\r\nwhen they attended a sacrifice. It had an embroidered border which fell\r\nround the neck and shoulders. In course of time the veil was narrowed to\r\nits embroidered border, and was lengthened into a kind of scarf, worn over\r\nthe shoulders and hanging down in front. A deacon wore the stole over one\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\nIn early times the priest and deacon bore a napkin, called the fanon or\r\nmaniple, over the left arm, with which to wipe the edge of the chalice;\r\nbut this also was in time reduced to a strip of embroidered material.\r\n\r\nThe amice was a linen hood worn with the chasuble, placed over the head\r\nwhile the chasuble was put on, and then thrown back; so that it was seen\r\nonly like a loose fold of linen round the neck.\r\n\r\nThe dalmatic was another upper garment, in form like a wide short tunic\r\nslit up at the sides, with short wide sleeves; and about the tenth\r\ncentury it became the distinctive upper vestment of the deacon. A little\r\nlater the sub-deacon wore a tunicle, which was a scantier dalmatic.\r\n\r\nWe often find “a suit of vestments” mentioned in inventories and wills,\r\nand in several places it is defined in detail as a chasuble, two tunicles,\r\nthree albes, and three amices, the vestments needed by the celebrant, his\r\ndeacon, and sub-deacon; the chasuble and tunicles would be of the same\r\nmaterial, colour, and style of ornamentation.\r\n\r\nThe cope was simply a cloak. The shape in which we first find it as an\r\necclesiastical vestment was an exact semicircle, usually with an\r\nornamented border along the straight side, which, when worn, fell down in\r\ntwo lines of embroidery in front. It was originally a protection from the\r\nweather, as indicated by its name “Pluviale,” and by the hood, which is so\r\nintegral a part of the original idea of the garment, that for centuries a\r\nflat triangular piece of ornamental work was sewn at the back of the cope,\r\nto represent this hood. It first appears as a clerical vestment about the\r\nend of the ninth century, and was worn in processions and in choir.\r\n\r\nThe surplice is the most modern of the clerical vestments. The fashion,\r\nintroduced about the eleventh century, of having the tunic lined with fur,\r\nwas found very comfortable by the clergy in their long services in cold\r\nchurches; but the strait, girded albe looked ungraceful over it, and so\r\nthe albe was enlarged into a surplice, to be worn in all minor offices\r\nover the furred robe, as its name, _superpelliceum_, indicates, while the\r\nalbe continued to be used in the Eucharistic Service.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bishop and Canons, from Richard II.’s “Book of Hours,”\r\nBritish Museum.]\r\n\r\nThe shape of the surplice differs much in different examples. We give some\r\nillustrations in which it will be seen that the surplice of a canon is\r\nlong and ample, while that of a clerk is little wider than an albe, but\r\nhas wide sleeves and is not girded. In an inventory of the goods of St.\r\nPeter, Cornhill, at the time of the Reformation, we find “gathered\r\nsurplices” for the “curate,” and “plain surplices” for the choir.[190]\r\n\r\nCanons in choir wore over the surplice a short furred cope or cape, called\r\nan amyss, with a fur-lined hood attached, of curious shape, as shown in\r\nseveral of our illustrations. Bishops wore the whole series of vestments\r\nwith the addition of mitre, jewelled gloves and shoes, and carried a\r\npastoral staff.\r\n\r\nThe furniture of the churches and the vestments of its ministers were of\r\nvery different degrees of beauty and cost--from altar vessels of simple\r\nsilver of rude country make up to vessels of gold fashioned by great\r\nartists and enriched with jewels; from a simple linen chasuble up to copes\r\nand chasubles of cloth of gold, enriched with embroidery of high artistic\r\nmerit and adorned with gems.\r\n\r\nAfter these dry technicalities, we have only to illustrate the vestments\r\nas they appeared in actual use by some pictures from illuminated\r\nmanuscripts and other sources, with a few explanatory notes where they\r\nseem to be necessary. Once granted that some distinctive dress is becoming\r\nand desirable for the clergy in their ministrations, and the rest is mere\r\nmatter of taste. There is nothing mysterious about the mediæval vestments.\r\nThey were all at first (except the Orarium) ordinary articles of everyday\r\napparel, worn by clergy and laity alike. But it has always been thought\r\nright that the clergy should not be in too great haste to follow new\r\nfashions, and so they went on wearing fashions till they were obsolete;\r\nmoreover, some of these copes and planetas were costly vestments given by\r\nkings and great men expressly to be worn in Divine service, and had been\r\nworn by saints, and had come to have venerable associations, and no one\r\nwished to discard them; and so they came to be distinctive and venerable.\r\n\r\nImaginative people soon invented a symbolical meaning for the various\r\nvestments, and other imaginative people varied the symbolism from time to\r\ntime. St. Isidore of Seville, in the sixth century, saw in the white\r\ncolour of the albe a symbol of the purity which becomes the clerical\r\ncharacter, and that was so obvious and simple, that it continued to be the\r\nrecognized meaning all through the ages. Of the chasuble, St. Germanus of\r\nConstantinople, in the eighth century, says it is a symbol of our Lord’s\r\nhumility; Amalarius of Metz, in the ninth century, says it means good\r\nworks; and Alcuin, in the tenth century, takes it to signify charity,\r\nbecause it covers all the other vestments as charity excels all other\r\nvirtues. Later writers made the dalmatic, because it is in the shape of a\r\ncross, signify the Passion of our Lord; the stole, the yoke of Christ; and\r\nso forth.[191]\r\n\r\nThere is a fashion in clerical vestments as well as in the clothes of the\r\nlaity; the forms of the cope, chasuble, etc., at different times are\r\nsufficiently shown in our illustrations to make description unnecessary.\r\nWe may make the one remark, that whereas the cope and chasuble of the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries are of pliant material and skilful\r\nfashion, and fall in graceful folds, the like vestments in the sixteenth\r\ncentury came to be made of stiff material unskilfully shaped; in the\r\nseventeenth century the chasuble has its sides entirely cut away, of\r\nnecessity, because the arms were unable to act under the weight and\r\nrigidity of the material, while the back and front hang down like boards\r\ncut into the shape of a violoncello.[192]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Goodrich, Bishop of Ely. (From his monumental brass.)]\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to introduce here, from the monumental brass of\r\nBishop Goodrich, 1554 A.D., an example of late date, in which the\r\nvestments are very clearly drawn, and briefly to enumerate them. The albe\r\nreaches to the feet, the piece of embroidery upon it being one of five\r\nsuch pieces, in front and back at the feet, on the wrists, and on the\r\nbreast, symbolizing the “five wounds” of our Lord. Over that may be seen\r\nthe lower part of the sub-deacon’s tunicle; over that the ends of the\r\nstole; then the dalmatic; and over all the chasuble. The embroidered\r\nvestment round the shoulders is probably the “rationale,” an ornament rich\r\nwith gold and jewels, worn by some bishops in this country. The plain\r\nfillet round the neck is the linen amice. The jewelled mitre and the\r\npastoral staff need no description. The hands are covered with gloves of\r\ngauntlet shape, and the tassel with which the wrist terminates will be\r\nevident to careful observation. The maniple will be seen hanging over the\r\nleft wrist. The book held in the right hand is probably the Bible, and the\r\nseal dependent from the same hand is the badge of this bishop’s civil\r\noffice of Lord Chancellor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abbot Delamere. St. Albans.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLIC SERVICES IN CHURCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe public services on Sunday in a parish church were Matins, Mass, and\r\nEvensong. We do not propose more than to take an outside view of them; the\r\nreader who cares to do so may without difficulty obtain a missal and\r\nbreviary, and study their contents. We may, however, make two remarks\r\nbearing upon the important general question of the popular religion of\r\nthese Middle Ages. The first is that there is a widespread error on the\r\nsubject of the “Mass” in the minds of those who have never opened a\r\nmissal. It is taken for granted that it was the most corrupt and\r\nidolatrous feature of all the Roman corruptions; on the contrary, the\r\nEucharistic service of the Mediæval English Church was very little altered\r\nin substance from that of the sixth century, and is so sound that it is\r\ninconsistent with some of the modern Roman corruptions in doctrine and\r\npractice. The Matins and Evensong of those times consisted of an\r\naccumulation of several of the “Hour” offices; and the Morning and\r\nEvening Prayer of our Prayer-book consists of a condensation of those same\r\n“Hours;” so that the regular popular services were far more free from\r\ncorruptions and superstitions than is commonly supposed. These were to be\r\nfound chiefly in glosses on the services, and additions to them.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the Sunday services were attended with fair regularity\r\nby the majority of the people.[193] Not only did the clergy exercise more\r\nauthoritative oversight over their people than they do in these times, but\r\nit was the duty of churchwardens to present people who were flagrantly\r\nnegligent of their religious duties, and of the Ecclesiastical Courts to\r\npunish them.[194]\r\n\r\nThe times of service varied in different times and places, but they were\r\nearlier than our present usage.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that matins always preceded the Divine service,[195] and it\r\nis probable that the normal time for the latter was nine o’clock;[196] it\r\nwas not considered right to celebrate it after twelve o’clock.\r\n\r\nIf not every Sunday, at least at certain times a sermon was preached,\r\nabout which we shall have to speak more at large presently. All the people\r\nwho were of age and not excommunicate were communicants, but the vast\r\nmajority only communicated once a year, at Easter, some pious people a\r\nlittle more frequently, but the most devout not oftener than twelve times\r\na year.[197] But at every celebration a loaf of bread, the “holy loaf,”\r\nwas blessed, and broken or cut in pieces, and given to the people. Here\r\ncomes in a question whether the laity attended mass fasting. It would seem\r\nthat it was not necessary, since they did not communicate, but that they\r\nmay have done so out of reverence is suggested by a note in Blunt’s\r\nAnnotated Prayer-book, that those who had not come fasting to the service,\r\ndid not eat their portion of the “holy loaf,” but gave it to another, or\r\nreserved it for future consumption. People dined no doubt immediately\r\nthey reached their homes after service.\r\n\r\nProbably the evensong at about three in the afternoon was not so well\r\nattended as the morning service; people who have some distance to go in\r\nall weathers from their homes to the church do not usually go twice a day.\r\nIt was probably the general custom to catechize the children in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nAll this is illustrated by some extracts from the author of “Piers\r\nPlowman”:--\r\n\r\n  For holy church exhorteth All manner of people\r\n  Under obedience to be, And buxom to the Law.\r\n  First religious of Religion their Rule to hold,\r\n  And under obedience to be by days and by nights;\r\n  Lewd[198] men to labour, lords to hunt\r\n  In friths and forests for fox and other beasts,\r\n  That in wild woods be, And in waste places,\r\n  As wolves that worry men, Women and children;\r\n  And upon Sunday to cease, God’s service to hear,\r\n  Both Matins and Masse, And after meat in churches\r\n  To hear their Evensong Every man ought.\r\n  Thus it belongeth to Lord, to learned, and to lewd,\r\n  Each holy day to hear Wholly the service,\r\n  Vigils and fasting days Further to know.[199]\r\n\r\nSloth said, in a fit of repentance--\r\n\r\n  Shall no Sunday be this seven years, Except sickness hinder,\r\n  That I shall not go before day To the dear church,\r\n  And hear Matins and Masse, As if I a monk were;\r\n  Shall no ale after meat Hold me thence\r\n  Till I have Evensong heard, I swear to the Rood.[200]\r\n\r\nThis confirms our statement that on Sundays people generally went to\r\nmatins and mass, and afterwards to dinner; and in the afternoon to\r\nevensong. Sloth is boasting when he says that in future he will go to\r\nchurch before day like a monk; ordinary lay people did not do so; and he\r\nadmits the fault of sitting over the ale after dinner, instead of going to\r\nevensong.\r\n\r\nThere seems to have been a certain laxity of practice in those days as in\r\nthese. We all know that it was the custom in many country churches in\r\nmodern times--and very likely still is so in some--not to begin the\r\nservice until the squire came; we are shocked to find that it was so in\r\nthose earlier times, and that the squire was sometimes very late. This is\r\nillustrated by two of the very curious stories in the “Book of the Knight\r\nof La Tour Landry.”[201]\r\n\r\n    I have herde of a knight and of a lady that in her (their) youthe\r\n    delited hem to rise late. And so they used longe tille many tymes that\r\n    thei lost her masse, and made other of her paryshe to lese it, for the\r\n    knight was lord and patron of the churche, and therefor the priest\r\n    durst not disobeye hym. And so it happed that the knight sent unto the\r\n    chirche that thei shulde abide hym. And whane he come it was passed\r\n    none, wherefor thei might not that day have no masse, for every man\r\n    saide it was passed tyme of the day, and therefore thei durst not\r\n    singe.\r\n\r\nThe other story is of\r\n\r\n    a ladi that dwelled faste by the chirche, that toke every day so long\r\n    time to make her redy, that it made every Sunday the parson of the\r\n    chirche and the parisseners to abide after her. And she happed to\r\n    abide so longe on a Sunday that it was fer dayes, and every man said\r\n    to other, “This day we trow shall not this lady be kemed and arraied.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELEVATION AT MASS. FROM THE LATE XV. CENT. MS. 25698, f.\r\n2.]\r\n\r\nWe read also of instances on fast days, when men might not eat till after\r\nevensong, of evensong being said at noon.\r\n\r\nAfter mass on Sunday, it was not very uncommon for a pedlar to take the\r\nopportunity of the assembling of the people to display his wares in the\r\nchurchyard, in spite of injunctions to the contrary. And after evensong,\r\nthe young people took advantage of their holiday to play at games,\r\nsometimes in the churchyard.[202]\r\n\r\nAn inquiry[203] by Cardinal Pole, in 1557, whether taverns and ale houses\r\nopened their doors on Sundays and holy days in time of mass, matins, and\r\nevensong, indicates that the law required them to be closed at those\r\ntimes, but permitted them to be open at other times on Sundays and holy\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe churchgoing habits of clergy and people on other days than Sundays and\r\nholy days are not so easily arrived at. There is no proof that a daily\r\ncelebration was ordered in the Saxon Church; after the Norman Conquest, a\r\nweekly celebration was ordered.[204] There is no canon of the English\r\nChurch which imposes a daily celebration on the clergy; by a Constitution\r\nof Peckham,[205] they are required to say mass once a week, and that, if\r\npossible, on a Sunday; at a later period it became the general practice\r\nfor a priest to say his daily mass. Where the services of the church were\r\nregularly performed, it is probable that the parish priest said the Divine\r\nservice every day, either in the parish church or in one of its chapels,\r\nif it had any; and that he also said matins and evensong; but it is not\r\nunlikely that in many country parishes there was an amount of laxity. We\r\nhave seen that the inhabitants of hamlets who were solicitous about the\r\nservices in their chapel were content with it on three days a week, viz.\r\nSunday, Wednesday, and Friday; and we should not be surprised to be told\r\nthat in many of the rural parish churches it was not said more frequently,\r\nor indeed more frequently than on Sundays and holy days.\r\n\r\nAs for the attendance of the laity on daily service, we have given reasons\r\nin the chapter on domestic chapels for believing that it was the custom of\r\nthe nobility and those of the higher classes who had domestic chapels and\r\nchaplains to have a daily celebration of mass, matins, and evensong.\r\n\r\nThere is a passage in the “Vision of Piers Plowman” (Passus V.) which\r\nseems to indicate that this was the case in churches also--\r\n\r\n  The king and his knights to the church wenten,\r\n  To hear matins and mass, and to the meal after.\r\n\r\nBut the services were likely to be duly performed in any church which “the\r\nking and his knights” were likely to attend, and in the principal churches\r\nin towns, and in well-served churches everywhere; we only doubt it in many\r\nof the churches and chapels in rustic parishes where devotion was cold and\r\ndiscipline slack, or the number of the clergy insufficient.\r\n\r\nAt the ordinary daily services in parish churches it is very likely that\r\nthere was some congregation; for attendance on the Divine service was\r\nhighly regarded as a pious exercise, and pious people who had the\r\nleisure--women especially--would be likely to attend it; the custom of\r\ngathering poor people into almshouses in which they formed a kind of\r\nreligious community with their chaplain, chapel, and daily prayers, would\r\nbe likely to have its counterpart in the attendance of the pensioners of\r\nthe parish church at the daily service in it; but it is unlikely that it\r\nwas ever customary for the middle class, still less the lower class of\r\nlaymen, engaged in the active business of life, to attend daily mass, or\r\nmatins, or evensong, as a habit of their religious life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Bidding Prayer, being in English, was a popular part of the service.\r\nIt was usually, from the eleventh century onward, said from the pulpit\r\nbefore the sermon. It differed somewhat in various places and at\r\ndifferent periods; but the following example, taken from “The York\r\nManual,” is a fair example of the class:\r\n\r\n    _Prayers to be used on Sundays._[206]\r\n\r\n    To God Almighty and the glorious Virgin Mother, our lady S. Mary, and\r\n    all the glorious company of heaven.\r\n\r\n    For the Pope and his Cardinals, for the Patriarch of Jerusalem, and\r\n    for the holy cross, that God bring it out of the heathen men’s hands\r\n    into Christian men’s keeping.\r\n\r\n    For the Archbishop of this see, and the Bishops, etc.\r\n\r\n    For the Parson of this church [and others] that hath the cure of men’s\r\n    souls, that God give them grace well to teach their subjects, and the\r\n    subjects well to work after heleful teaching, that both the teachers\r\n    and subjects may come to everlasting bliss.\r\n\r\n    For all priests and clerks who sing in this church, and any other,\r\n    etc.\r\n\r\n    For the King and Queen, the peers and lords, and all the good\r\n    Commoners of this land, and especially for those that hath the good\r\n    council of the land to govern, that God give them grace such counsel\r\n    to take and ordain, and so for to work thereafter that it may be\r\n    loving to God Almighty, and profit and welfare to the royalme, and\r\n    gainsaying and reproving of our enemy’s power and malice.\r\n\r\n    For all that worship in this church, or any other, with book, bell,\r\n    vestment, chalice, altar-cloth, or towell, or any other ornament, etc.\r\n\r\n    For all that give or leave in testament any good to the right\r\n    maintenance and upholding of the work of this Church, and for all them\r\n    that find any Light in this Church as in torch, taper, land, in\r\n    worshipping of God or of our Lady or of any of His Saints.\r\n\r\n    For all our good parishioners wheresoever they be, on water or on\r\n    land, that God of His goodness save them from all manner of perils,\r\n    and bring them safe where they would be in health of body and soul and\r\n    also of goods.\r\n\r\n    For all that are in debt or deadly sin, that God for His great mercy\r\n    bring them soon thereof; and for all those that are in good living,\r\n    that God maintain them and give them good perseverance in their\r\n    goodness; and that these prayers may be heard and sped the sooner\r\n    through your prayers, every man and woman that here is, help them\r\n    heartily with a _Pater Noster_ and an _Ave Maria_, etc.\r\n\r\n        Deus misereatur [the whole Psalm].\r\n        Gloria Patri.\r\n        Kyrie Eleyson, etc.\r\n        Pater noster ... et ne nos ... sed libera.\r\n        Sacerdotes tui induantur justitia.\r\n                   Et sancti tui exultent, etc.\r\n                   Et clamor meus ad te veniat.\r\n        Dominus vobiscum. Et cum spiritu tuo.\r\n        Oremus [three Latin prayers].\r\n\r\n    Ye shall kneel down devoutly and pray for the brethren and sisters of\r\n    St. Peter of York, St. John of Beverley, St. Wilfred of Ripon, and St.\r\n    Mary of Southwell; and specially for all those that be sick in this\r\n    parish or any other, that God in His goodness release them from their\r\n    pains in their sickness, and turn them to the way that is most to\r\n    God’s pleasure and welfare of their souls.\r\n\r\n    We shall pray for all those that duly pay their tendes [tithes] and\r\n    their offerings to God and to the holy Church, that God do them meed\r\n    in the bliss of heaven that ever shall last, and they that do not so\r\n    that God of His mercy bring them soon to amendment.\r\n\r\n    We shall pray for all true pilgrims and palmers wheresoever they be,\r\n    on water or on land, that God of His goodness grant them part of our\r\n    good prayers and us part of their good pilgrimages.\r\n\r\n    We shall also pray for all land tylland [under cultivation], that God\r\n    for His goodness and for His grace and through our good prayers\r\n    maintain them that they may be saved from all evil winds and wethers\r\n    and from all dreadful storms, that God send us corn and cattle for to\r\n    live upon to God’s pleasure and the welfare of our souls.\r\n\r\n    We shall pray also for all women that be with child in this parish or\r\n    any other, that God comfort them, and send the child Christendom, and\r\n    the mother Purification of holy Church, and releasing of pain in her\r\n    travailing.\r\n\r\n    We shall pray specially for them that this day gave bread to this\r\n    Church for to be made holy bread of; for them that it begun and\r\n    longest uphold, for them and for us and for all them that need hath of\r\n    good prayers.\r\n\r\n    In worship of our lady Saint Mary and her v joys, every man and woman\r\n    say in the honor of her v times _Ave Maria_.\r\n\r\n        _Antiphona._--Ave, regina cælorum,\r\n                      Mater regis angelorum;\r\n                      O Maria flos virginum,\r\n                      Velut rosa vel lilium,\r\n                      Funde preces ad Filium\r\n                      Pro salute fidelium.\r\n        V. Post partum virgo inviolata.\r\n        Gratiam tuam, etc.\r\n\r\n    Oremus.--We beseech thee, O Lord, pour Thy grace into our hearts, that\r\n    we who have known Thy Incarnation by the message of an angel, by His\r\n    Cross and Passion may come to the glory of His Resurrection, through\r\n    the same Christ our Lord. Amen.\r\n\r\n    Ye shall make a special prayer for your fathers’ souls and for your\r\n    mothers’ souls, godfathers’ souls and godmothers’ souls, brothers’\r\n    souls and sisters’ souls, and for all your elders’ souls, and for all\r\n    the souls that you and I be bound to pray for, and specially for all\r\n    the souls whose bones are buried in this church or in this churchyard\r\n    or in any other holy place; and in especial for all the souls that\r\n    bide the great mercy of Almighty God in the bitter pains of Purgatory,\r\n    that God for His great mercy release them of their pain if it be His\r\n    blessed will. And that our prayers may somewhat stand them in stead,\r\n    every man and woman of your church help them with a _Pater noster_ and\r\n    an _Ave Maria_.\r\n\r\n        Psalmus: De profundis.\r\n        Kyrie Eleyson, etc.\r\n        Pater noster ... et ne nos ...\r\n        Requiem eternam.\r\n        Credo vivere.\r\n        A porta inferi.\r\n        Dominus vobiscum. Et cum spiritu tuo.\r\n        Oremus.\r\n        Fidelium Deus omnium Conditor, etc.\r\n        Fidelium animæ per misericordiam Dei in pace requiescant. Amen.\r\n\r\nOne of the features connected with this part of the service, which must\r\nhave had a striking effect, was the Bede Roll, the reading out the names\r\nof those who had recently died in the parish, and the commendation of them\r\nto the prayers of the congregation. There are examples of the payment of a\r\nfee for placing a name on the list, and of people leaving money to the\r\npriest for naming them from year to year on their anniversary, and of\r\nendowments for the maintenance of the Bede Roll.[207]\r\n\r\nThe Procession, or Litany, was also a very popular service; its petitions\r\nand responses, though in Latin, were intelligible enough to the people;\r\nand the procession of priest and clerks round the church with cross and\r\ncenser, while the petitions were chanted by a single voice, _Sancte\r\nKatherine_; etc., _ora pro nobis_, and the responses sung in chorus,\r\n“_Ora, ora, ora pro nobis!_” made up a very picturesque and solemn\r\nservice. It was probably usually said in the afternoon. A painful, but no\r\ndoubt very attractive, addition was sometimes made to it, when a miserable\r\npenitent condemned to the penance preceded the procession in white sheet,\r\nbearing a taper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn churches in which there were one or more chantries the private masses\r\nwould be said at the convenience of the cantarists, with this one\r\nregulation: that they might not on Sundays and festivals begin till after\r\nthe gospel of the principal service. People might attend these chantry\r\nservices if they pleased, and perhaps the relatives of persons\r\ncommemorated usually or frequently did so; and, if said at a different\r\nhour from the principal service, they would practically add to the number\r\nof services, and meet the convenience of some of the people.\r\n\r\nWe shall see hereafter that chantry and special services were often\r\nprovided in towns by the corporation, or one of the gilds, or by some\r\ngroup of persons, expressly to add to the number of services, first for\r\nthe greater honour of Almighty God, and secondly to meet the wishes and\r\ncircumstances of different people.\r\n\r\nIn most great churches, with the normal services, and the chantry services\r\nbesides, services must have been going on all the morning long; sometimes\r\nthe great celebration at the high altar, and, at the same time, chantry\r\ncelebrations at a dozen altars besides in the surrounding chapels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nPREACHING AND TEACHING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a chain of evidences that the rulers of the Church not only\r\nenjoined the diligent teaching of the people by their parish priests in\r\nsermon[208] and otherwise, but also gave the clergy the assistance of\r\nmanuals of teaching and sermon helps; and, further, took pains at their\r\nvisitations to ascertain that the duty was efficiently performed.\r\n\r\nSo early as the beginning of the eighth century, Aldhelm, Bishop of\r\nSherborne, published a poem in four hundred and fifty-eight Latin\r\nhexameters, “De Octo[209] Principalibus Vitiis.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREACHING. FROM THE XIII. CENT. MS., EGERTON, p. 745, f.\r\n46.]\r\n\r\nÆlfric’s address to the clergy (c. 1030) at the distribution of the chrism\r\nseems to have been written for his Bishop Wulfsine to deliver to a\r\nsynodical assembly of the clergy of the Diocese of Sherborne. It is an\r\ninstruction to the clergy on the duties of their office; dealing first\r\nminutely with their duty in baptism, unction, the eucharist, etc.; then it\r\nbids them to know by heart and explain to the people the Ten Commandments,\r\nand gives a brief explanation of each; then it goes on to explain the\r\neight[210] capital vices. It is the first which has been preserved to us\r\nof a long series of synodal instructions.\r\n\r\nThe Synod of Oxford, in 1223, enjoins the clergy “not to be dumb dogs, but\r\nwith salutary bark to drive away the disease of spiritual wolves from the\r\nflock.” A canon of Alexander of Stavenby, Bishop of Coventry (1224-1240),\r\nrequires all clergy to address to their people assembled on the Lord’s Day\r\nor other festival the following words:--the words constitute a rhetorical\r\nsermon on the seven deadly sins. Another canon gives directions as to the\r\nmode of receiving penitents, and dealing with souls. Grostete (1235-1254)\r\ngave directions to his clergy to preach on Sundays, and gave them the\r\nheads of their teaching. In Exeter, Bishop Quivil (1280-1292) drew up a\r\nsimilar book for the clergy, of which he required every parish to have a\r\ncopy under penalty of a fine. Bishop Brentingham, of Exeter (1370-1395),\r\nissued a mandate against intruding priests who would say low masses in\r\nparish churches on Sundays and holy days, which parishioners attended\r\ninstead of the _Magna Missa_, and so lost the benefit of the sermon: this\r\nassumes that a sermon is preached in all parish churches on Sundays and\r\nholy days. Other diocesan bishops adopted similar methods.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Peckham, in the Constitutions of 1281, put forth a manual of\r\nteaching on the Articles of Faith, the Ten Commandments, the Seven[211]\r\nDeadly Sins, the Seven Principal Virtues, and the Seven Sacraments, so\r\nfully and ably done that it continued to form a standard of teaching, and\r\nis constantly referred to in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. It\r\nseems worth while to give it _in extenso_ as an authentic record of the\r\nteaching of the Mediæval Church. It appears as Canon X. of the Provincial\r\nSynod of Lambeth, 1281, and begins with this preamble--\r\n\r\n    The ignorance of priests precipitates the people into the pit of\r\n    error, and the foolishness or rudeness of clerks, who ought to\r\n    instruct the minds of the faithful in the Catholic faith, sometimes\r\n    tends rather to error than to doctrine. Also some blind preachers[212]\r\n    do not always visit the places which most need the light of truth, as\r\n    the prophet witnesses, who says, “The children seek for bread, and\r\n    there is no one to break it to them;” and another prophet cries, “The\r\n    poor and needy ask for water, and their tongue is parched.” For the\r\n    remedy of such mischiefs we ordain that every priest who presides over\r\n    a people do four times a year, that is, once in each quarter of the\r\n    year, on one or more festival days, either by himself or by another,\r\n    expound to the people in popular language without any fanciful\r\n    subtlety, the 14 Articles of Faith, the 10 Commandments of the Lord,\r\n    the 2 Evangelical Precepts of Charity, the 7 Works of Mercy, the 7\r\n    Deadly Sins with their progeny, the 7 Principal Virtues, and the 7\r\n    Sacraments of Grace. And in order that no one may excuse himself from\r\n    this on account of ignorance, though all ministers of the Church ought\r\n    to know them, we have here with great brevity summed them up.\r\n\r\n    _Of the Articles of Faith._--Seven of them concern the mystery of the\r\n    Trinity; four of these belong to the essence of the Godhead, and the\r\n    other three relate to His works. The first is the unity of the Divine\r\n    Essence in three Persons of the Indivisible Trinity agreeably to this\r\n    part of the Creed, “_I believe in one God._” The second is to believe\r\n    God the Father, begotten of none. The third is to believe the Son the\r\n    only begotten, and God. The fourth is to believe the Holy Ghost to be\r\n    God, neither begotten nor unbegotten, but proceeding both from the\r\n    Father and the Son. The fifth article is to believe in the creation of\r\n    Heaven and Earth (that is, of every visible and invisible creature) by\r\n    the whole and undivided Trinity.\r\n\r\n    The sixth is the Sanctification of the Church by the Holy Ghost, and\r\n    by the Sacraments of Grace, and by all those things in which the\r\n    Christian Church communicates. By which is understood that the Church,\r\n    with its Sacraments and discipline, is, through the Holy Ghost,\r\n    sufficient for the salvation of every sinner; and that outside the\r\n    Church there is no salvation. The seventh article is the consummation\r\n    of the Church in eternal glory by a true resurrection of body and\r\n    soul; and on the contrary is understood the eternal damnation of the\r\n    lost.\r\n\r\n    _Of the Seven Articles relating to the Humanity of Christ._--The first\r\n    is His Incarnation, or His true assumption of human flesh of the\r\n    Blessed Virgin, by the Holy Ghost. The second is the real birth of\r\n    God Incarnate from the immaculate Virgin. The third is the true\r\n    passion of Christ and His death upon the Cross under Pontius Pilate.\r\n    The fourth is the descent of Christ in the Spirit into hell, while His\r\n    body remained in the grave, for the despoiling of Tartarus. The fifth\r\n    is the true Resurrection of Christ. The sixth is His Ascension to\r\n    heaven. And the seventh is the most confident expectation of His\r\n    coming to judgment.\r\n\r\n    _Of the Ten Commandments._--Of the ten commandments of the Old\r\n    Testament three relate to God, and constitute the first table; the\r\n    remaining seven concern our neighbour, and are called the Commandments\r\n    of the Second Table. The First Commandment is,[213] _Thou shalt have\r\n    no other gods before Me_; by which all idolatrous worship is\r\n    forbidden; and by inference all lots and incantations and\r\n    superstitions[214] of letters, and such-like figments are forbidden.\r\n    In the Second, where it is said, _Thou shalt not take the Name of the\r\n    Lord thy God in vain_, all heresy is principally condemned; and, in a\r\n    secondary sense, all blasphemy, irreverent mention of the Name of God,\r\n    and especially perjury. The Third Commandment, where it is said,\r\n    _Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath day_, commands Christian\r\n    worship, to which clergy and laity are alike bound. But we are to\r\n    understand that the obligation of rest upon the Jewish Sabbath came to\r\n    an end together with the other legal ceremonies; and that under the\r\n    New Testament came in the practice of Divine worship on the Lord’s day\r\n    and other holy days appointed by the authority of the Church, and the\r\n    manner of keeping those days is to be governed by the laws of the\r\n    Church, and not by any Jewish usage.\r\n\r\n    The First Commandment of the Second Table is, _Honour thy Father and\r\n    Mother_, in which we are explicitly commanded to honour our parents,\r\n    both in temporal and in spiritual matters; but implicitly, and in a\r\n    secondary sense, every man is by this commandment to be honoured\r\n    according to his proper degree; not only our natural father and mother\r\n    are intended, but our spiritual parents, the Bishop of the Diocese and\r\n    the Priest of the Parish, may be said to be our fathers; and the\r\n    Church is our Mother, who is the Mother of all the faithful. The\r\n    Second precept in this division is, _Thou shalt not kill_; by which\r\n    the unauthorized taking away any person’s life, either by consent,\r\n    act, word, or encouragement, is explicitly forbidden, and implicitly\r\n    every unrighteous injury to the person. They likewise who do not\r\n    support the poor, they who murder a man’s reputation, are guilty of\r\n    the breach of this Commandment; and so are all such as harass and\r\n    distress the innocent. The Third Commandment says, _Thou shalt not\r\n    commit adultery_. Adultery is explicitly condemned, and implicitly\r\n    fornication, which is likewise explicitly forbidden in Deuteronomy\r\n    xxiii., where it is said, “There shall be no whore of the daughters of\r\n    Israel.” But, further, the command extends by way of reduction to all\r\n    instances of impurity. The Fourth Commandment declares _Thou shall not\r\n    steal_, which explicitly condemns the clandestine conveying away\r\n    another man’s property without his consent, implicitly it forbids\r\n    taking what belongs to our neighbour either by fraud or violence. The\r\n    Fifth Commandment is, _Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy\r\n    neighbour_. This precept explicitly forbids false testimony to the\r\n    damage of our neighbour; and in a secondary sense it disallows undue\r\n    commendation in order to the promotion of an unworthy person. Lastly,\r\n    under this command, all sort of lies, but especially those which are\r\n    injurious, are condemned. The Sixth Commandment is, _Thou shalt not\r\n    covet thy neighbour’s house_--i.e. to his injury. By this command we\r\n    are implicitly forbidden to desire the _real_ estate of our neighbour,\r\n    and especially if he is a Catholic. The Seventh and last Commandment\r\n    of the Table is, _Thou shalt not covet his wife, nor his servant, nor\r\n    his maid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is his_, where\r\n    the coveting of our neighbour’s stock or _personal_ estate is\r\n    forbidden.\r\n\r\n    But to these Ten Commandments the Gospel superadds two, viz. _The Love\r\n    of God and of our neighbour_. He loves God who obeys the aforesaid\r\n    Commandments more out of love than out of fear of punishment; and\r\n    every one ought to love his neighbour as himself; where the particle\r\n    “_as_” does not signify equality but similarity. So that, for example,\r\n    you may love your neighbour to the same extent as you love yourself,\r\n    that is for good and not for evil; and in the same way that is\r\n    spiritually and not carnally; and as much as yourself, in regard to\r\n    time, that is in prosperity and adversity, in health and sickness; as\r\n    also as much as yourself in respect of degree, insomuch as you love\r\n    each and every man more than riches; also insomuch as you love the\r\n    soul of your neighbour, or his eternal salvation, more than your own\r\n    earthly life, as you ought to put the life of your soul before the\r\n    life of your body; also in the same kind as yourself, so that you\r\n    succour all others in need as you wish to be helped in like necessity.\r\n    All these things are meant when it is said “Thou shalt love thy\r\n    neighbour as thyself.”\r\n\r\n    _Of the Seven Works of Mercy._--Six of the Seven Works of Mercy may be\r\n    learned from St. Matthew’s Gospel: _To feed the hungry; to give drink\r\n    to the thirsty; to entertain the stranger; to clothe the naked; to\r\n    visit the sick; to comfort those in prison_; the seventh is gathered\r\n    from Tobit--_to bury the dead_.\r\n\r\n    The Seven Deadly or Capital Sins are Pride, Envy, Anger or Hatred,\r\n    Sloth, Avarice or Covetousness, Gluttony, Intemperance. Pride is the\r\n    love of one’s own superiority (_amor propriæ excellentiæ_), from\r\n    whence spring boasting, ostentation, hypocrisy, schism (_sasinata_),\r\n    and such like. Envy is hatred of another’s good: whence come\r\n    detraction, strife, complainings, dissension, perverse judgements, and\r\n    such like. Anger is the desire of revenge, of doing hurt to any\r\n    person, when it continues upon the mind it settles into hatred; whence\r\n    proceed outrage in words and acts, quarrels, murders, and such like.\r\n    Sloth (_accidia_)[215] is a strong indisposition for spiritual good,\r\n    so that a man has no delight in God or in His praises; out of it come\r\n    idleness, cowardice, despair, and the like. Avarice is an immoderate\r\n    love of riches, either by unlawful gathering or unlawful hoarding; out\r\n    of it spring fraud, theft, sacrilege, simony, and every sort of base\r\n    gain. Gluttony is an immoderate love of gratifying the palate in food\r\n    and drink, and it sins in many ways; first, in regard to time, when a\r\n    man eats too early or too late or too often; second, in respect to\r\n    quality, when he is too nice in the choice of his diet; third, in\r\n    respect of quantity, when he eats and drinks too much, which is the\r\n    most degrading form of gluttony; also in respect of avidity and\r\n    voracity, and lastly, in too nice a preparation of food so as to\r\n    excite the appetite; all which are contained in this verse--\r\n\r\n        “_Præ, propere, laute, nimis, ardenter, studiose_.”\r\n\r\n    Lastly, as for Luxuria, it is not needful to explain it, for its\r\n    infamy poisons the whole atmosphere.\r\n\r\n    The Seven Principal Virtues are Faith, Hope, and Charity, which,\r\n    having God for their object, are called the Theological Virtues; and\r\n    the others, Prudence, Temperance, Justice, and Fortitude, which relate\r\n    to ourselves and our neighbours. The action of Prudence is to make a\r\n    proper choice; of Justice to do what is good and right; of Temperance\r\n    not to be hampered by pleasures; Fortitude is not to desert our duty\r\n    for any pain or hardship. These are called the seven cardinal or\r\n    principal virtues, because from these seven many others are deduced;\r\n    concerning which, since we work chiefly for the benefit of the plainer\r\n    sort of people, we shall at present add no more.\r\n\r\n    There are Seven Sacraments of the Church, the power of administering\r\n    which is committed to the clergy. Five of these Sacraments ought to be\r\n    received by all Christians in general; that is, Baptism, Confirmation,\r\n    Penance, the Holy Eucharist, and Extreme Unction, which last is only\r\n    for one who seems to be in danger of death; it should be given, if it\r\n    may be, before a man is so far spent as to lose the use of his reason;\r\n    but if he happens to be seized by a frenzy, or suffer from any\r\n    alienation of mind, this Sacrament ought nevertheless to be\r\n    administered to him, provided he gave signs of a religious disposition\r\n    before his mind was disturbed. Under such qualifications Extreme\r\n    Unction is believed to be beneficial to the sick person provided he is\r\n    predestinated (_predestinationis filius_), and either procures him a\r\n    lucid interval or some spiritual advantage. The other two Sacraments\r\n    are Order and Matrimony. The first belongs to the perfect, but the\r\n    second in the time of the New Testament belongs to the imperfect only,\r\n    and yet we believe that, by the virtue of the sacrament, it conveys\r\n    grace, if it is contracted with a sincere mind.\r\n\r\nThoresby, Archbishop of York in 1357, commissioned John Graytrigg, a monk\r\nof York, to write in English verse an exposition of these six things: The\r\nFourteen Points of the Creed, the Ten Commandments, the Seven Sacraments,\r\nthe Seven Works of Mercy, the Seven Virtues, the Seven Deadly Sins; and\r\nthis he sent to all his priests, and bade them teach them often to their\r\npeople, and urge them to teach their children; and to examine them as to\r\ntheir knowledge when they come to confession in Lent. At a synod held at\r\nEly in 1364, priests were enjoined frequently to preach, to expound the\r\nTen Commandments, etc., to study the sacred Scriptures, to see that\r\nchildren are taught prayers, and to examine adults when they come to\r\nconfession as to their religious knowledge. When Arundel, in 1408, forbade\r\npreaching without a licence, he expressly excepted the parish priests, who\r\nwere bound to instruct their people in simple language.\r\n\r\nA provincial synod at York, under Archbishop Nevil, in 1465, orders\r\nsystematic teaching quarterly in simple language on points which the canon\r\nelaborately sets forth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were numerous helps to preachers. Ælfric, towards the end of the\r\nSaxon period, freely translated forty homilies from Augustine, Jerome,\r\nBede, Gregory, and other great ancient writers, which were put forth for\r\nthe use of the clergy under the authority of Archbishop Siric; he\r\nafterwards added forty others of a more legendary character; and there are\r\nmany other Saxon sermons still extant, printed by Wanley, Sharon Turner,\r\nThorpe, the Early English Text Society, etc. Of a later period there are\r\nseries of sermons by Grostete of Lincoln, FitzRalph of Armagh, and\r\nliterally hundreds of other writers, some for all the Sundays of the year,\r\nsome for the great festivals only. A series of sermons for Sundays and\r\nfeast days, by John Felton, Vicar of St. Mary Magdalene, Oxford, c. 1450,\r\nseems to have been popular, since many manuscripts of it remain. The\r\n“Liber Festivalis” of John Myrk, Canon of Lillieshall, was also popular;\r\nCaxton’s printed “Liber Festivalis” was founded upon it. The “Summa\r\nPredicantium” is a book of sermon notes for preachers; the “Alphabetum\r\nExemplarium” is a collection of illustrations and anecdotes from which the\r\npreacher might cull examples.\r\n\r\nThe “Speculum Christiani,” by John Watton, in the fourteenth century, was\r\nintended, as is stated in the preface, to help the parish priests to carry\r\nout Peckham’s injunctions. A great part of it is in English, and it\r\ncontains rhymed versions of the Commandments to help the memory. Several\r\neditions of it (one in 1480, at the cost of a London merchant) are among\r\nthe earliest printed books. The “Flos Florum” was another book of the same\r\nclass explaining the Lord’s Prayer, Virtues, and Vices, etc. There were\r\nalso many private manuals instructing the clergy in all their duties: as\r\nthe “Pars Oculi Sacerdotis” of W. Parker, about 1350 A.D.; and the revised\r\nedition of it, under the title of “The Pupilla Oculi” of Burgh, in 1385.\r\n\r\nThese series of authoritative instructions are open to the criticism that\r\nthey are dry and formal, lacking evangelical tone and unction, manuals of\r\ntheology are apt to be dry and formal; the treatment of sins and virtues\r\nis perhaps pedantic and fanciful, but it proves a searching analysis of\r\nthe human heart and conduct, and contains much which is striking and true.\r\n\r\nBut there was another class of English books, like “The Prick of\r\nConscience” and other works of Richard the Hermit of Hampole[216] (died in\r\n1349), and the “Speculum” of Archbishop St. Edmund Rich, in which we find\r\na vein of pious meditation, intended in the first instance for the use of\r\nthe clergy; but the pious thoughts of the clergy are not long in finding\r\ntheir way to their tongues, and so to the ears and hearts of their people.\r\nThe religious poem of William of Massington, an advocate of the Court of\r\nYork, “On the Works of God and the Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ,”\r\netc., and a number of short poems, which have been printed in various\r\ncollections, give examples of the existence of the emotional element in\r\nthe popular religion in strains of considerable poetical and religious\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\nIt is a very curious circumstance that many of these books are cast into a\r\npoetical mould--Dom Johan Graytrigg’s work is in the alliterative poetry\r\nof Saxon and early English literature, and John Myrk’s “Instructions” and\r\nthe “Lay Folks’ Mass-book” are in rhyme, no doubt with the twofold purpose\r\nof making them more attractive and more easily remembered.\r\n\r\nA remarkable feature of the moral teaching of the Middle Ages was its\r\nminute analysis of sin. It divided sin into the Seven Deadly Sins: Pride,\r\nEnvy, Anger, Sloth, Covetousness, Gluttony, Luxury; the list of them is\r\nsometimes slightly varied. Then it divided each sin into its various\r\nbranches. It will be enough to quote from the “Argenbite of Inwit” the\r\nanalysis of the first of them--Pride.\r\n\r\n_Pride_ has seven boughs: Untruth, Contempt, Presumption, Ambition,\r\nVainglory, Hypocrisy, Wicked Dread.\r\n\r\n_Untruth_ has three twigs: Ingratitude, Foolishness, Apostasy.\r\n\r\n_Contempt_ is of three sorts: not praising others as they deserve; not\r\ngiving reverence where one ought; not obeying those who are over us.\r\n\r\n_Presumption_ has six twigs: Singularity, Extravagance, and also Strife,\r\nBoasting, Scorn, Opposition.\r\n\r\n_Vainglory_ has three small twigs: God’s gifts of Nature, Fortune, and\r\nGrace.\r\n\r\n_Hypocrisy_ is of three kinds: Foul, Foolish, Subtle.\r\n\r\nThe seventh bough of Pride is Wicked Fear and Shame.\r\n\r\nAnd so with the rest of the deadly sins.\r\n\r\n_Envy_ poisons the heart, mouth, and head.\r\n\r\n_Hatred_ has seven twigs: Chiding, Wrath, Hate, Strife, Vengeance, Murder,\r\nWar.\r\n\r\n_Sloth_ means yielding to our natural disinclination to good and proneness\r\nto evil, and has six divisions: Disobedience, Impatience, Murmuring,\r\nSorrow, Desire of Death, Despair.\r\n\r\n_Avarice_ has ten divisions: Usury, Theft, Robbery, False Claim,\r\nSacrilege, Simony, Fraud, Chaffer, Craft, Wicked Gains.\r\n\r\n_Gluttony_ has five kinds; _Lechery_ fourteen. It is very pedantic in\r\nform; but there is a keen insight into human frailty, and there are many\r\nshrewd hits and pithy sayings, and it is lightened by anecdotes and\r\nillustrations. Men nowadays would not have the patience to read it; but if\r\nthey did read and digest it, they might gain a great amount of\r\nself-knowledge.\r\n\r\nSome similar treatises at the end of every deadly sin give its remedy,\r\nalso minutely analyzed.[217] Other subjects are treated by the same\r\nmethod--the Seven Virtues, the Ten Commandments, the Lord’s Prayer, etc.\r\nIt is all dry reading, but it gives the patient reader valuable knowledge\r\nof the attitude of men’s minds in those days towards Christian faith and\r\npractice. An evidence of the popularity of these treatises is given by the\r\nfact that “The Parson’s Tale” in Chaucer’s “Canterbury Tales” is nothing\r\nmore or less than such a treatise on penitence, divided into three parts,\r\nviz. Contrition, Confession, and Satisfaction; in the course of which the\r\nSeven Deadly Sins, with their remedies, are dealt with in the usual\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nPeople bestowed a great deal of ingenuity in representing these systems of\r\nteaching by diagrams. A MS. Psalter of the thirteenth century (Arundel,\r\n83) gives a number of them;[218] at f. 129 _verso_ is the _Arbor\r\nVitiorum_, a tree with seven principal branches, viz. the Seven Deadly\r\nSins, and their subordinate boughs and twigs as above. At f. 120 is the\r\n_Arbor Virtutum_, treated in a similar way. At f. 130 the Seven Petitions\r\nof the Lord’s Prayer, the Seven Sacraments, the Seven Vices, and the Seven\r\nVirtues, are arranged in a device so as to give their relations to one\r\nanother; and there are similar devices on f. 2 _verso_, and the two\r\nfollowing pages. Such devices were sometimes painted on the walls of\r\nchurches.\r\n\r\n                                 GRATIA.\r\n        Pax.                       ||                   Contricio.\r\n

VICIORVM.\r\n\r\nThe pictorial representation of type and antitype seems to have had an\r\ninterest for them. So early as the seventh century, Benedict Biscop\r\nbrought pictures from Gaul and Italy to adorn his monasteries on the Tyne,\r\nand among them were one pair of Isaac bearing the wood for the sacrifice,\r\nand our Lord carrying His cross; another pair the brazen serpent and our\r\nLord upon the cross. In the King’s MS. 5 are a series of pictures arranged\r\nin three columns; in the middle a subject from the history of our Lord,\r\nand on each side two Old Testament types. The “Biblia Pauperum” of the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries consisted of a similar arrangement of\r\ngospel histories, with Old Testament types.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR PARISH PRIESTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA flood of light is thrown upon the subject of a priest’s duties in his\r\nparish by the handbooks which seem to have been as common in the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries as they are in the nineteenth;\r\ninstructing, advising, exhorting the clergy as to their duties, and the\r\nbest way of fulfilling them. The Early English Text Society has printed\r\none of these entitled, “Instructions for Parish Priests,” written by John\r\nMyrk, a canon of Lilleshall, in Shropshire, not the same man who wrote the\r\n“Liber Festivalis.” The oldest MS. of it belongs to the first half of the\r\nfifteenth century. It will answer our purpose to give a rather complete\r\nanalysis of the book, spelling some words in modern fashion, in order to\r\nmake it more intelligible, without much altering the substance.\r\n\r\nIt begins:--\r\n\r\n  Whenne the blynde ledeth the blynde,\r\n  Into the dyche they fallen both.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAPTISM BY AFFUSION. FROM THE XV. CENT. MS. EGERTON, 2019\r\nf. 135.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAPTISM BY IMMERSION. FROM THE XIV. CENT. MS., ROYAL 6 E.\r\nVI., f. 171.]\r\n\r\nSo, our author says, ignorant priests lead their people into sin;\r\ntherefore, if you are not a great clerk, you will do well to read this\r\nbook, where you will find--\r\n\r\n  How thou schalt thy parische teche\r\n  And what thou must thyself be.\r\n  For lytel is worth thy prechynge,\r\n  If thou be of evil lyvynge.\r\n\r\nWhich is certainly a very wholesome exordium.\r\n\r\nThen he begins his instructions--\r\n\r\n  Preste; thy self thou moste be chaste,\r\n  And say thy service withouten haste,\r\n  That mouthe and heart accord i fere,[219]\r\n  If thou wilt that God thee hear.\r\n\r\nAnd so he goes on: He must be true in heart and hand, eschew oaths, be\r\nmild to all, put away drunkenness, gluttony, pride, sloth, and envy. He\r\nmust not frequent taverns, or make merchandise, or indulge in wrestling,\r\nshooting, hawking, hunting, dancing; wear cutted (slashed) clothes, or\r\npiked shoes; not frequent markets or fairs. He must wear proper clothes,\r\nmust not wear basilard or baldrick, must keep his beard and crown shaven;\r\nbe free of meat and drink to rich and poor; forsake women, avoid foolish\r\njesting, despise the world, and cultivate virtue. We recognize that the\r\nauthor is giving a summary of all the canons on the subject of the life of\r\nthe clergy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Confession. (From Chaucer’s “Romaunt of the Rose,” Harl.\r\n4425, f. 143.)]\r\n\r\nHe goes on to the priest’s duties. He is not to let men go on in sin, but\r\nurge them to speedy confession lest they forget before Lent. He is to bid\r\nwomen with child to come to confession and holy communion,\r\n\r\n  For dread of peril that may befall\r\n  In their travailing that come shall.\r\n\r\nIf a child is in danger of death, the midwife or the father or mother is\r\nto baptize it; and he is to teach people what is the proper form, “I\r\nfolowe (baptize) thee, or, I christen thee, in the name of, etc.” All\r\nchildren born within eight days of Easter or of Whitsunday, are to be\r\nbrought to baptism at those seasons, unless they are in danger of death.\r\nHe is to instruct godparents to teach their god-children the Our Father\r\nand Creed; and to bring them to be bishoped within their fifth year; but\r\nthe sponsors at the baptism are not to hold the child at the\r\nconfirming.[220] Relatives by spiritual ties as well as by blood, are not\r\nto marry, and he defines these spiritual relationships. Irregular\r\nmarriages are cursed. Banns are to be asked on three holy days, and then\r\nthe parties are to be openly wedded at the church door. He is to bid all\r\nwho are of years of discretion to come to church to confession, and to\r\nreceive communion on Easter Day all together:[221]\r\n\r\n        Teach them then with good intent\r\n        To beleve in that sacrament\r\n        What they receive in form of bread\r\n        It is God’s body that suffered dead[222]\r\n        Upon the holy rood tree,\r\n        To buy our sins and make us free.\r\n\r\n    Every Sunday a “holy loaf”[223] provided by the charity of some one of\r\n    the laity was cut in pieces, and a piece given to all who came up to\r\n    receive it: the authority for this practice was no doubt the\r\n    primitive love-feast. But when it was not the custom for the laity to\r\n    communicate, this was given as a sort of representation of and\r\n    substitute for the consecrated bread, and it was attended by a good\r\n    deal of superstition. A question in the “Lay Folks’ Mass-book” seems\r\n    to indicate that it was required that people should receive it and eat\r\n    it, fasting, every Sunday--\r\n\r\n        Hast thou eaten any Sonday\r\n        Withouten holy bred? Say yea or nay;\r\n\r\n    and a return by the vicar of Leominster of the sources of his income,\r\n    seems to indicate that a payment for this holy bread was customary in\r\n    some places (see p. 404).\r\n\r\nHe is to teach that, after receiving the Consecrated Bread at Easter, what\r\nis given them afterwards in the chalice is only wine and water to assist\r\nin the swallowing it completely:\r\n\r\n  But teach them all to ’lieve sudde[224]\r\n  That it which is on the altar made\r\n  It is very God’s blood\r\n  That He shed on the rood.\r\n\r\nTeach the people when they go to church to leave behind idle speech and\r\njests, and light behaviour, and say their paternoster and creed. Not to\r\nstand or lean against pillar or wall, but set themselves on their knees on\r\nthe floor, and pray to God with meek heart to give them grace and mercy.\r\nWhen the gospel is read, they are to stand and bless Him as well as they\r\ncan, and when _gloria tibi_ is done, they are to kneel down again; and\r\nwhen the sacring-bell rings, they are to hold both hands up and say\r\nsoftly, without noise--\r\n\r\n  Jesu, Lord, welcome thou be,\r\n  In forme of bred as I Thee see;\r\n  Jesu for thy holy name\r\n  Shield me to-day from sin and shame.\r\n  Shrift and housel, Lord, thou grant me bo[225]\r\n  Ere that I shall hennes[226] go,\r\n  And true contrycion of my sin\r\n  That I Lord never die therein.\r\n  And as thou wert of a may[227] y’bore,\r\n  Suffer me never to be forelore;\r\n  But when that I shall hennes wend\r\n  Graunt me thi blysse withouten ende. Amen.\r\n\r\n  Teche them thus or some othere thynge,\r\n  To say at the holy sakerynge.\r\n\r\n[In the “Lay Folks’ Mass-book” the following short verse is given to be\r\nsaid in this place--\r\n\r\n  Welcome, Lord, in form of bread,\r\n  For me thou suffered hard deed?\r\n  As thou didst bear the crown of thorn\r\n  Suffer me not to be forlorn.]\r\n\r\nHe is to teach them when they walk in the way, and see the priest bearing\r\n“God’s body” to the sick, to kneel down, whether the way be fair or\r\nfoul.[228] And then comes a gross bit of superstition which he fathers on\r\nSt. Augustine:\r\n\r\n  So mickle good doth that syht,\r\n  As Saint Austen teacheth wryht,\r\n\r\nthat on that day the devout beholder shall have meat and drink, God will\r\nforgive idle oaths and words, and he need not fear sudden death nor loss\r\nof sight. Within the church and “seyntuary”[229] people are not to sing\r\nor cry; not to cast the axtre or stone, or play bull and bears in the\r\nchurchyard. Courts and such-like contentions are not to be held in church.\r\nTeach them duly to pay their tithe--but, he breaks off jestingly, it is\r\nnot necessary to teach a priest how to ask for his tithe. Witchcraft and\r\nusury are forbidden, and so is selling at too high a price.\r\n\r\nNext he gives metrical paraphrases of the Lord’s Prayer, Ave and Creed,\r\nwith a brief explanation of the Creed, and a curious illustration of the\r\ndoctrine of the Trinity:--\r\n\r\n  Water and ice and eke snowe,\r\n  Here be thre things as ye may see,\r\n  And yet the three all water be.\r\n\r\nThen he gives a long instruction on the right administration of baptism,\r\nand on confirmation:--\r\n\r\n    Which in lewde men’s menyng,\r\n    Is y-called the bishoping.\r\n\r\n  The bishop confirmeth and maketh sad[230]\r\n  That that the priest before hath made,[231]\r\n  Wherefore the name that is then y-spoke\r\n  Must stand firm as it were loke,[232]\r\n\r\nwhich is an interesting allusion to the right of altering the Christian\r\nname at Confirmation.\r\n\r\nThen comes a general sentence of excommunication[233] to be said two or\r\nthree times a year when the parish is met together, with cross and\r\ncandle and bell tolling. It declares that all persons are accursed who\r\nbreak the peace of the church, or rob it, or withhold tithes; all\r\nslanderers, fire raisers, thieves, heretics, usurers, etc., etc. Then the\r\ncandle is to be thrown down, and the priest is to spit on the ground, and\r\nthe bells to ring. This general sentence of excommunication is clearly the\r\norigin of the form of Commination still said on Ash Wednesday.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONFIRMATION. FROM A PRINTED PONTIFICAL, A.D. 1520 (471, f.\r\n2).]\r\n\r\nThen comes an instruction on the mode of hearing confessions, and some\r\npractical advice on the kind of penances to give, _e.g._ if the penitent\r\ndoes not know the Pater, Ave, and Creed, he is to have such a penance set\r\nas will make him learn them; and he is to be examined as to his belief.\r\n\r\nNext, as part of the instruction in the art of confession, comes a\r\npractical exposition of the ten commandments one by one; and in the same\r\nway an exposition of the seven deadly sins and of the venial sins; and of\r\nthe sins of the senses; in all which we recognize a digest of Archbishop\r\nPeckham’s famous canon of instruction for preaching; then come counsels as\r\nto the remedies for the seven deadly sins. Then an instruction on the\r\nadministration of Extreme Unction, with a kind of Office for the\r\nVisitation of the Sick.\r\n\r\n  When thou shalt to sick gone\r\n  A clean surplice cast thee on,\r\n  Take thy stole with thee right,\r\n  And pull thy hood over thy sight.\r\n  Bear thy Host anont[234] thy breast\r\n  In a box that is honest.\r\n  Make thy clerk before thee gynge[235]\r\n  To bear light and bell ring.[236]\r\n\r\nThis is the prayer of the sick before the unction--\r\n\r\n    My God, my God, my mercy and my refuge, Thee I desire, to Thee I flee,\r\n    to Thee I hasten to come. Despise me not, placed in this tremendous\r\n    crisis, be merciful to me in these my great necessities. I cannot\r\n    redeem myself by my own works; but do Thou my God redeem me, and have\r\n    mercy on me. I trust not in my merits, but I confide rather in Thy\r\n    mercies, and I trust more in Thy mercies than I distrust my evil\r\n    deeds. My faults, my great faults. Now I come to Thee because Thou\r\n    failest none, I desire to depart and be with Thee. Into Thy hands, O\r\n    Lord, I commend my spirit, Thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth.\r\n    Amen. And grant to me, my God, that I may sleep and rest in peace, who\r\n    in perfect Trinity livest and reignest God, world without end. Amen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PARISH PRIEST TAKING THE LAST SACRAMENT TO THE SICK. XIV.\r\nCENT. MS., 6 E. VI., f. 427 verso.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PARISH PRIEST ADMINISTERING LAST SACRAMENT. XIV. CENT. MS.,\r\n6 E. VII., f. 70.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nPOPULAR RELIGION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Saxon times, the Creed, Lord’s Prayer, and Ten Commandments were taught\r\nto the people in their own tongue, sometimes in metrical paraphrases, that\r\nthey might the more easily be remembered, and every parent was required to\r\nteach them to his children.\r\n\r\nA canon of the Synod of Clovesho, in 747, required the priest to explain\r\neverything in the Divine service to the people, and the Gospel for the day\r\nwas read to them in the vernacular. The poem of Cædmon, which paraphrased\r\nlarge portions of the Old Testament history, was not the only use of the\r\nnative poetry for the purpose of popularizing the truths of religion; we\r\ncall to mind how Aldhelm used to sit on the parapet of the bridge over\r\nwhich the country-people must needs pass into Malmesbury, and sing to them\r\nreligious poems, to the accompaniment of his harp. King Alfred translated\r\nthe psalms, and there were various other versions of the psalms and other\r\nportions of Scripture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEducation was much more common among the laity of the Middle Ages than is\r\nsometimes supposed. The French books of piety and of romance in the\r\nthirteenth century presuppose people capable of reading them. Grostete’s\r\n“Castle of Love” was a religious allegory, in which, under the ideas of\r\nchivalry, the fundamental articles of Christian belief are represented. By\r\nthe middle of the fourteenth century, English had become a literary\r\nlanguage, and works of all kinds were written in it. Wiclif did not\r\ntranslate the Bible from Latin into English for the clergy; they would\r\nrightly prefer to continue to read it in the Latin of the Vulgate; he\r\nwrote it for the laity, and we know that it was largely circulated among\r\nthem. The poems of Lydgate and Gower, “Piers Plowman,” and the Canterbury\r\nTales, the numerous romances, and the religious tracts of Wiclif and\r\nRobert of Hampole, had numerous readers; and for those readers books of\r\ndevotion were largely provided.\r\n\r\nRobert de Brunne’s “Handlyng of Synne,” in 1303, was a translation of the\r\nFrench “Manuel des Pechiez” of the previous century. The “Meditacyuns of\r\nthe Soper of oure Lorde Ihesu,” in 1303, was a translation of the\r\n“Meditationes Vitæ Christi” of Cardinal Bonaventure.\r\n\r\n“The Pricke of Conscience,” by Richard Rolle, the Hermit of Hampole, and\r\n“The Ayenbite of Inwit” (Remorse of Conscience), completed in 1340,[237]\r\nare translations of “Le Somme des Vices et des Vertus,” composed in 1279.\r\nThe “Parson’s Tale” in Chaucer’s “Canterbury Pilgrims,” is in part a\r\ntranslation from the same book. The “Lay Folks’ Mass-book,” or manner of\r\nhearing mass, with rubrics and devotions for the people, and offices in\r\nEnglish according to the Use of York, is an evidence that pains was taken\r\nto enable the people to enter intelligently into the Latin service. It was\r\nwritten in French by Dan Jeremy, Canon of Rouen, afterwards Archdeacon of\r\nCleveland, in about the year 1170, and was translated into English towards\r\nthe close of the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe “Lay Folks’ Mass-book” is well worth more space than we can afford it\r\nhere, as a curious illustration of the popular religion. It explains the\r\nmeaning of the service, and of the ritual, tells the worshipper when to\r\nstand and kneel, and puts private devotions into his mouth in rhyme, for\r\ntheir better remembrance. There are numerous MSS. of these books still\r\nexisting, and when the art of printing was discovered, they were among the\r\nbooks early printed, so that we have reason to believe that they were in\r\ngeneral demand and use among the laity.\r\n\r\nWe learn that it was the custom for the parish priest to vest at the\r\naltar--the old parish churches seldom had vestries:\r\n\r\n  When the altar is all dight,\r\n  And the priest is washed right,\r\n  Then he takes in both his hands\r\n  A chesepull[238] cloth on the altar hangs,\r\n  And comes aback a little down,\r\n  And does it upon him all aboune.\r\n  All men kneeling, but he stands,\r\n  And holds to God up both his handes.\r\n\r\nWhen the priest and clerks confess to one another, the worshipper is\r\ndirected also to make his confession in a form given.\r\n\r\nAfter the confession the people stand, and the priest begins the service;\r\nthe worshipper is told to pray for him, and the hearers, and their\r\nfriends, and for “peace and rest that lastes ay to Christian souls passed\r\naway,” and to all men. Next is given a rhyming English version of the\r\n_Gloria in Excelsis_, to be said while the priest is saying it in Latin.\r\nThe people kneel and say _Pater nosters_ through the Collect and Epistle;\r\nwhen the priest crosses to the south corner of the altar to read the\r\nGospel, then the people are to stand and make a cross, and take good heed,\r\nand say this prayer--\r\n\r\n  In the Name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost,\r\n  One steadfast God of might most,\r\n  Be God’s word welcome to me,\r\n  Joy and love, Lord, be to Thee.\r\n\r\nAgain at the end of the Gospel make another cross and kiss it. While the\r\nMass (Nicene) Creed is being said, say the Apostles’ Creed, as given in a\r\nrhymed version--\r\n\r\n  I trow[239] in God, father of might\r\n    That all has wrought,\r\n  Heaven and earth, day and night,\r\n    And all of nought, etc.\r\n\r\nAt the end is a very curious perversion of the clause of the Communion of\r\nSaints: _Communio Sanctorum_ is translated as if it were _Concomitantia\r\nSanctorum_--\r\n\r\n  And so I trow that housel is\r\n  Both flesh and blood.\r\n\r\nAfter that comes the offertory; offer or not, as you please;[240] but in\r\neither case say the following prayer--\r\n\r\n  Jesu, that wast in Bethlem bore,\r\n  Three kings once kneeled Thee before,\r\n  And offered gold, myrrh, and incense;\r\n  Thou disdained not their presents,\r\n  But didst guide them all the three\r\n  Home again to their country.\r\n  So our offerings that we offer,\r\n  And our prayers that we proffer,\r\n  Take them, Lord, to Thy praise,\r\n  And be our help through all our days.\r\n\r\nThen when the priest turns to the people and asks their prayers, kneel and\r\npray for him. When the priest comes to the middle of the altar and says\r\n_sursum corda_, then lift up your heart and body, and praise God with the\r\nangels--\r\n\r\n  Sweet Jesu grant me now this\r\n  That I may come to Thy bliss,\r\n  There with angels for to sing,\r\n  The sweet song of Thy loving,\r\n  Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus,\r\n  God Grant that it be thus.\r\n\r\nKneel when the canon of the mass begins, and offer thanksgivings for\r\ntalents of nature, right mind, grace in perils, etc.; pray for pardon,\r\ngrace, strength for the future; make intercessions for church, king,\r\nnobility, kinsmen, friends, servants, for the afflicted, sick, captive,\r\npoor, banished, dispossessed; pray for God’s ordering of the world, for\r\ngood weather, that He will\r\n\r\n  The fruits of the earth make plenteous;\r\n  All Thou seest best ordain for us,\r\n  Such grace to us Thou send,\r\n  That in our last end,\r\n  When this world and we shall sever,\r\n  Bring us to joy that lasts for ever. Amen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADMINISTERING HOLY COMMUNION WITH HOUSEL CLOTH. EARLY XIV.\r\nCENT. MS., ROYAL, 2 B VII., f. 260 v.]\r\n\r\nAt the sacring bell do reverence to Jesus Christ’s presence, holding up\r\nboth hands, and looking upon the elevation;[241] and if you have nothing\r\nbetter prepared to say, say this which follows--\r\n\r\n    Loved be Thou, king,\r\n    And blessed be Thou, king,\r\n      Of all thy giftes good;\r\n    And thanked be Thou, king,\r\n    Jesu, all my joying,\r\n      That for me spilt Thy blood.\r\n      And died upon the rood.\r\n    Thou give me grace to sing,\r\n    The song of thy loving.\r\n\r\n  Pater noster. Ave maria. Credo.\r\n\r\nAfter the sacring, pray for the dead, that they may have part in this\r\nmass:--\r\n\r\n  When the priest the elevation has made\r\n  He will spread his arms on-brade,[242]\r\n  Then is the time to pray for the dead,\r\n  Father’s soul, mother’s soul, brother dear,\r\n  Sister’s souls, sibmen, and other sere,[243]\r\n  That us good would, or us good did,\r\n  Or any kindness unto us kyd.\r\n  And to all in purgatory pine\r\n  This mass be mede and medicine;\r\n  To all Christian souls holy\r\n  Grant Thy grace and Thy mercy;\r\n  Forgive them all their trespass,\r\n  Loose their bonds and let them pass\r\n  From all pine and care,\r\n  Into the joy lasting evermore. Amen.\r\n\r\nListen for the priest to begin _Pater noster_, and be ready to answer at\r\n_temptationem_, _Sed libera nos a malo. Amen._ And then say the Lord’s\r\nPrayer to yourself as here given--\r\n\r\n  Fader our, that is in heaven,\r\n  Blessed be Thy name to neven.[244]\r\n  Come to us Thy kingdom.\r\n  In heaven and earth Thy will be done.\r\n  Our ilk-day bread grant us to-day,\r\n  And our misdeeds forgive us aye,\r\n  As we do them that trespass us\r\n  Right so have mercy upon us,\r\n  And lead us in no founding,\r\n  But shield us from all wicked thing. Amen.\r\n\r\nAt the _Pax_ pray for peace and charity. Lastly, he is to pray for the\r\ngrace of having heard the mass, making it a kind of spiritual communion--\r\n\r\n  Jesu my King, I pray to Thee,\r\n  Bow down thine ears of pity,\r\n  And hear my prayer in this place.\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  We pray this mass us stand in stead\r\n  Of shrift and als[245] of housel bread.\r\n  And Jesu, for Thy woundes five,\r\n  Teach us the way of right-wise live. Amen.\r\n\r\nAfter all is over, he is to utter a final thanksgiving:--\r\n\r\n  God be thanked of all his works,\r\n  God be thanked for priests and clerks,\r\n  God be thanked for ilk a man.\r\n  And I thank God all I can, etc.\r\n\r\nThen there follows an example of the superstition with which sound\r\ndoctrine was vitiated. Every step, this book teaches, that a man makes to\r\nattendance at mass is noted by the guardian angel, that day a man does not\r\nage nor become blind, he has God’s pardon if he goes to confession, and\r\nif he die it avails him as the viaticum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Primers were books for the private devotion of the laity. They began\r\nat an early period, and from the fourteenth century onward they were often\r\nwholly or in part translated into English. The latest of them put forth by\r\nthe king’s authority, in 1545, contained “the Kalendre, the king’s\r\nhighnesse Injunction, the Salutation of the Angel, the Crede or Articles\r\nof the Faith, the Ten Commandments, certain graces, the matyns, the\r\nevensong, the complen, the seven [penitential] psalmes, the commendations,\r\nthe psalmes of the passion, the passion of our Lorde, certeine godly\r\nprayers for sundry purposes.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe “Myrroure of our Ladye,” written for the nuns of Sion, is a\r\ntranslation of their services into English, with an explanation of their\r\nmeaning. It became a favourite book of devotion to the laity, and was\r\nprinted at an early period. The writer explains that he has thought it\r\nnecessary to translate only a few of the psalms, because they may be found\r\nin Hampole’s Version, or in the English Bibles, a passing testimony to the\r\naccessibility of these books. The tone of the book may be indicated by one\r\nextract. “There is neither reading nor singing that may please God of\r\nitself, but after the disposition of the reader or singer, thereafter it\r\npleaseth or displeaseth.”\r\n\r\n“Dives and Pauper” was another of the popular English books, written\r\nprobably about the middle of the fifteenth century, and early printed. It\r\nis in the form of a dialogue between a rich man and a poor man, in which\r\nthe poor man occupies the place of teacher. It begins with an essay on\r\nHoly Poverty, and then goes on to an excursive exposition of the Ten\r\nCommandments; for example, under the first commandment, the author shows\r\nhow imagery is lawful, and how images were ordained for three causes. 1.\r\nTo stir men’s minds to think on Christ and the saints. 2. To stir their\r\naffections; and 3. To be a book for the unlearned. He explains that\r\n“worship to God and the Lamb, done before images, should properly not be\r\ndone to such images.” “Christ is the cross that men creep to on Good\r\nFriday.” “For this reason,” he says, “be crosses by the way that when folk\r\npassing see the crosses they should think on Him that died on the cross,\r\nand worship Him above all thing.” And, similarly, he gives the rationale\r\nof a number of practices.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-Saxon poems attributed to Cædmon are said by the critics to be,\r\nin their present form, probably not of earlier date than the eleventh\r\ncentury. In any case, they are very remarkable productions of a school of\r\nnative poetry; and we think it worth while to give some examples of them.\r\nThe first is taken from the account of the Creation--\r\n\r\n  Here the eternal Lord, Head of Creation\r\n  In the beginning shaped the universe,\r\n  The sky upreared, and this fair spacious earth\r\n  By His strong might was stablished evermore.\r\n  As yet no verdure decked the new-born world;\r\n  The ocean far and wide in deepest night\r\n  Concealed the universe. Then o’er the deep\r\n  Was swiftly borne on bright and radiant wing,\r\n  The spirit of the Lord. The mighty King\r\n  Bade Light come forth far o’er the spacious deep,\r\n  And instantly His high behest was done,\r\n  And holy Light shone brightly o’er the waste,\r\n  Fulfilling His command. In triumph then\r\n  He severed light from darkness, and to both\r\n  The Lord of Life gave names; and holy light\r\n  Firstborn of all created things, beauteous\r\n  And bright, above all creatures fair,\r\n  He called the Day ...\r\n  Then time past o’er the quivering face of earth,\r\n  And Even, first at God’s command dispelled\r\n  The radiant Day, till onward rolled the dark\r\n  And murky cloud which God Himself called Night,\r\n  Chasing away the Even’s twilight gleam.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext we take the poet’s conception of Satan and his fall--\r\n\r\n                            Of old\r\n  The King eternal by His sovereign might\r\n  Ordained ten Angel tribes, of equal rank,\r\n  With beauty, power and wisdom richly dowered;\r\n  And in the host Angelic, whom, in love,\r\n  He moulded in His own similitude,\r\n  He evermore reposed a holy trust\r\n  To work His will in loving loyalty,\r\n  And added by His grace, celestial wit\r\n  And bliss unspeakable.\r\n\r\n                        One of the host\r\n  Angelic He endowed with peerless might\r\n  And arch intelligence. To him alone\r\n  The Lord of Hosts gave undisputed sway\r\n  O’er all the Angel tribes, exalted high,\r\n  Above all Principalities and Powers,\r\n  That next to God omnipotent he stood\r\n  O’er all created things, lone and supreme.\r\n  So heavenly fair and beauteous was his form,\r\n  Fashioned by God Himself, that by compare,\r\n  Less glorious spirits grew dim; e’en as the stars\r\n  In God’s fixed belt, pale in the glowing light\r\n  Of nine resplendent spheres.\r\n\r\n                        Long had he reigned,\r\n  August Vicegerent of the Heavenly King,\r\n  But for presumptuous pride which filled the heart\r\n  With dire ingratitude and hostile thoughts\r\n  Against the eternal throne.\r\n  Nor was it hid from God’s omniscient eye\r\n  That this archangel, though beloved still,\r\n  Began to harbour dark presumptuous thoughts,\r\n  And in rebellion rise against his God\r\n  With words of pride and hate.\r\n\r\n                        For thus he spake\r\n  Within his traitorous heart:\r\n\r\n                        “No longer I,\r\n  With radiant form endowed and heavenly mien,\r\n  Will brook subjection to a tyrant God,\r\n  Or be His willing slave. Such power is mine,\r\n  Such goodly fellowship, I well believe\r\n  ’Tis greater e’en than God’s own following.”\r\n  With many a word of bold defiance spake\r\n  The Angel of Presumption; for he hoped\r\n  In heaven to rear a more exalted throne\r\n  And stronger, than the seats he now possessed.\r\n  Then moved by traitorous guile he built in thought\r\n  Vast palaces within the northern realm,\r\n  And richer western plains of Paradise,\r\n  And evermore he dwelled in doubtful mood\r\n  Whether ’twere better in acknowledged war\r\n  To risk his high estate, or prostrate fall\r\n  Mock-loyal as his God’s inferior.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  When the All-Powerful in secret knew\r\n  The great presumption of His Angel-chief,\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Heavenly Justice hurled him from his throne,\r\n  And cast him headlong down the burning gulf\r\n  Which leads to deepest hell.\r\n\r\n                        For three long days\r\n  And three successive nights the apostate falls\r\n  Forgotten with his lone rebellious tribe.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Then Satan sorrowing spake--\r\n                            “This straitened place,\r\n  O how unlike those heavenly seats where once\r\n  In heaven’s high kingdom we as princes reigned.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                        ’Tis this most grieves\r\n  My anxious heart, that earthborn man should hold\r\n  My glorious seat and dwell in endless joy,\r\n  While we in Hell’s avenging horrors pine.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                        Here then lies\r\n  Our only hope of adequate revenge--\r\n  To ruin, if we may, this new-born man,\r\n  And on his race eternal woe entail.”\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNext a brief fragment from the account of Satan’s invasion of Paradise--\r\n\r\n  Without delay the Apostate Angel donned\r\n  His glistening arms, and lightly on his head\r\n  His helmet bound, secured with many a clasp,\r\n  And started toward his fatal enterprise.\r\n  High toward the fiery concave first he shot,\r\n  A spiry column, bright with lurid flame,\r\n  Showed where he took his flight. The gates of Hell\r\n  Were quickly left behind as lion-like\r\n  In strength, and desperate in fiendish mood\r\n  He dashed the fire aside.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Onward he took his way, and soon descried\r\n  Far off the trembling light of this fair world.\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                            Ere long amid the shade\r\n  Of Eden’s fair wide-spreading foliage\r\n  He saw the Parents of Mankind; the man\r\n  Whose comely form bespoke a wise design,\r\n  And by his side, radiant with guileless youth,\r\n  His God-created spouse. Above them spread\r\n  Two trees rich laden with immortal fruit.[246]\r\n\r\nThe parallelism with the “Paradise Lost” is, in many places, so striking\r\nthat we should conclude that Milton knew the work of his predecessor by so\r\nmany centuries, if we were not assured that the work was unknown in\r\nMilton’s day.\r\n\r\nThe publications of the Early English Text Society have made known a\r\nconsiderable number of religious treatises, tracts, poems, and short\r\npieces in the English language, which throw light upon the popular\r\nreligion of the three centuries from the thirteenth to the fifteenth.\r\n\r\nLegendary histories of saints and apocryphal stories indicate the general\r\nacceptance of the marvellous; addresses to the Blessed Virgin Mary, or by\r\nher to the soul, bear witness to the existence of a general veneration for\r\nthe virgin mother, but the tone of them is more calm and chastened than\r\nthe addresses in some of the popular Italian devotions; there are others\r\nwhich give sound teaching; and others which reveal the existence of a\r\nstrain of profound and pathetic religious sentiment in the heart of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nHere from a MS. of the fifteenth century[247] is a poem of six stanzas,\r\nevery stanza ending with the line, “Why art thou froward since I am\r\nmerciable?” It begins--\r\n\r\n  Upon a cross nailed I was for thee,\r\n  I suffered death to pay thy raunison;[248]\r\n  Forsake thy synne for the love of Me,\r\n  Be repentant, make plain confession.\r\n  To contrite hearts I give remission;\r\n  Be not despaired, for I am not vengeable;\r\n  ’Gainst ghostly enemies, think on my Passion;\r\n  Why art thou froward since I am merciable?\r\n\r\nAnother fifteenth-century poem, whose theme is taken from Solomon’s Song,\r\nthe love of Christ for man’s soul, concludes every eight-line stanza with\r\nthe text, _Quia amore langueo_.[249] Here are two stanzas--\r\n\r\n  Upon this mount I found a tree,\r\n  Under this tree a man sitting;\r\n  From head to foot wounded was he.\r\n  His heart’s blood I saw bleeding;\r\n  A seemly man to be a king,\r\n  A gracious face to look unto;\r\n  I asked him how he had paining,[250]\r\n  He said _Quia amore langueo_.\r\n\r\n  I am true-love that false was never,\r\n  My sister, man’s soul, I loved her thus,\r\n  Because I would not from her dissever\r\n  I left my kingdom glorious;\r\n  I provide for her a palace precious;\r\n  She fleeth, I follow, I sought her so.\r\n  I suffered the pain piteous,\r\n  _Quia amore langueo_.\r\n\r\n  I crowned her with bliss, and she me with scorn,\r\n  I led her to chamber, and she me to die;\r\n  I brought her to worship, and she me to scorn,\r\n  I did her reverence, and she me villainy, etc.\r\n\r\nAnother favourite theme was a pathetic “Complaint of Christ,” in which He\r\nsets before man all that He has done for him, in creation, in providence,\r\nin redemption, and appeals against his unkindness. The refrain of every\r\nstanza is, “Why art thou to thy friend unkind?” Here is a stanza of it--\r\n\r\n  Man, I love thee! Whom lovest thou?\r\n  I am thy friend, why wilt thou feign?\r\n  I forgave, and thou Me slew;\r\n  Who hath de-parted our love in twain?\r\n  Turne to Me! Bethink thee how\r\n  Thou hast gone amiss! Come home again!\r\n  And thou shalt be as welcome now\r\n  As he that synne never did stain.\r\n  Man! bethink thee what thou art;\r\n  From whence thou come, and whither thou move,\r\n  For though thou to-day be in health and quarte,[251]\r\n  To-morrow I may put thee adown.\r\n  I forgave, and thou sayest nay,\r\n  Why art thou to thy friend unkind?\r\n  I have bought thy love full dear,\r\n  Unkind! why forsakest thou mine?\r\n  I gave thee mine heart and blood in fere,\r\n  Unkind! why wilt thou not give Me thine?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE CELIBACY OF THE CLERGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enforcement of celibacy upon the clergy was an important feature in\r\nthe plan of the Hildebrandine reformers of the eleventh century. The idea\r\nwhich inspired the enthusiasm of the foremost Churchmen of the time was,\r\nno doubt, a grand one. It was to bring the national churches into\r\npractical co-operation by a world-wide ecclesiastical organization, and to\r\nplace the spiritual authority of the whole Church in the hand of one man,\r\nin order to control the world-power of kings and princes, and check the\r\nmanifold abuses which at that time especially threatened to corrupt and\r\nsecularize the Church. The clergy were intended in the Hildebrandine\r\nscheme to be the Pope’s local agents in the administration of this\r\necclesiastical monarchy; and in order to detach them from secular and\r\nlocal ties it was proposed to make the secular clergy a kind of Religious\r\nOrder--an anticipation, in some respects, of the organization of the\r\nsubsequent Orders of Friars.\r\n\r\nWe must do the authors of the scheme the justice to remember that they\r\nhonestly believed that the celibate state--not the mere accident of being\r\nunmarried, but the chosen and vowed state--was a higher condition of life;\r\nand it was easy to apply St. Paul’s advice to those who could accept it,\r\nto the special condition of the clergy:--“The unmarried (priest) careth\r\nfor the things of the Lord, that (he) may be holy both in body and spirit,\r\nbut the married (priest) careth for the things of the world.” It was easy\r\nto draw a contrast between the parish priest with a wife and family, bound\r\nby a thousand ties to the ordinary interests and anxieties of the world,\r\nand the celibate priest, who wants nothing beyond the priest’s chamber and\r\nhis humble fare, and who gives his whole mind and soul to his daily\r\ndevotions and his spiritual ministrations among his flock; his rusty\r\ncassock a uniform as honourable as the soldier’s war-stained coat, his\r\nascetic life ensuring the reverence which even the worldly-minded pay to\r\nthose who despise worldly things.\r\n\r\nTo the fulfilment of this idea the great body of the secular clergy in\r\nGermany, Italy, and France, as well as England, offered for centuries a\r\nstubborn resistance. They stood on the irrefragable ground that the\r\npriests and Levites of the Old Dispensation were married men; that our\r\nLord and His apostles gave no such commandment to the Church; that, as a\r\nmatter of history, some of the apostles were married men; and that for ten\r\ncenturies bishops and priests of the Church all over the world had\r\nmarried. It was obvious to reply to the supposed advantages of a\r\npriesthood disentangled from worldly anxieties, that, on the contrary, it\r\nwas desirable for the pastors in immediate habitual intercourse with the\r\npeople to be men who had property and families, because then they could\r\ndeal with men on the ground of common interests and sympathies; and that\r\nto impose compulsory celibacy on the secular clergy was a measure full of\r\nthe gravest dangers.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the clergy probably were influenced by the broad common\r\nsense which pronounced the ultramontane idea to be unscriptural,\r\ntranscendental, novel, and, therefore, questionable; and, lastly, a burden\r\nwhich no one had the right to impose upon the unwilling. Some of them\r\ntauntingly desired the pope to see if he could get the spirits from above\r\nto leave their stations and come and rule the Churches under his Holiness,\r\nsince men were not good enough for him.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to introduce celibacy among the secular clergy had been begun\r\nin the latter part of the Saxon period. We have seen that kings made laws\r\nand bishops made canons against the married clergy. We cannot have better\r\nevidence than that of Ælfric’s famous pastoral address, that the Saxon\r\nclergy generally had ignored these laws and canons, and that it had not\r\nbeen found practicable to enforce them. Ælfric declares that--\r\n\r\n    The Four General Councils forbade all marriages to ministers of the\r\n    altar, and especially to mass-priests [which is a misstatement], and\r\n    that the canons command that no bishop nor priest shall have in his\r\n    house any woman except his mother or other person who is above\r\n    suspicion. “This, to you priests,” he says, “will seem grievous,\r\n    because ye have your misdeeds in custom” [you are accustomed to\r\n    married priests], “so that it seems to yourselves that ye have no sin\r\n    in living in female intercourse as laymen do, and say that Peter the\r\n    Apostle had a wife and children. So he and others had before their\r\n    conversion, but then forsook their wives and all earthly things”\r\n    [which is, to say the least, a doubtful assumption]. “Beloved,” he\r\n    goes on, “we cannot now forcibly compel you to chastity, but we\r\n    admonish you nevertheless that ye observe chastity as Christ’s\r\n    ministers ought in good reputation to the pleasure of God.”\r\n\r\nGregory VII., in the Fourth Lateran Council, in 1074, took a step in\r\nadvance of previous legislation on the subject. He peremptorily forbade\r\nmarriage to the clergy, pronounced sentence of excommunication against\r\nthose who refused to put away their wives, and forbade the laity to be\r\npresent at mass when they officiated.\r\n\r\nIn adopting this legislation in England, Lanfranc considerably modified\r\nit. In the Synod of Winchester, in 1076, it was decreed that no canon\r\nshould be married; the married parochial clergy were not required to put\r\naway their wives, but those who were not married were forbidden to take\r\nany; and bishops were required not to ordain deacons or priests unless\r\nthey declare that they have not wives. But this legislation seems to have\r\nbeen largely ignored, and the disobedience winked at.\r\n\r\nIn 1102, a national synod, held at Westminster, under Anselm of\r\nCanterbury and Gerard of York, sought to draw the line more strictly. It\r\nenacted that no canon, and no one above the order of sub-deacon, might\r\nmarry; required those who were married to put away their wives; forbade a\r\nmarried priest to say mass, and the people to hear him. It added another\r\nedict, to which we shall have to refer hereafter--that sons of priests\r\nwere not to succeed to their fathers’ benefices.\r\n\r\nIt was soon found that it was not possible to enforce these decrees, and\r\nthe Pope was appealed to on the question. He was so convinced of the\r\ndifficulty, that he dispensed with the canons, and in a letter (1107) to\r\nAnselm gave reasons for so doing, which contain valuable evidence of the\r\ncondition of things. He founded the dispensation on the particular\r\ncircumstances of the English Church, where, he observes, the greater and\r\nmore valuable part of the clergy were the sons of priests, and therefore\r\nhe gives Anselm a commission to promote such persons in the Church. He\r\nlikewise empowers him to dispense with the canons in other cases where the\r\nuntractableness of the English and the interest of religion should make it\r\nnecessary. Anselm’s canons were repeated by William of Canterbury and\r\nThurstan of York in 1126 and 1127, but were met with a stubborn\r\nresistance.[252]\r\n\r\nAfter a short time bishops and great dignitaries ceased to be married men,\r\nand sought to enforce the canons on celibacy which they helped to make.\r\nCathedral dignitaries also generally paid outward respect to the canons,\r\nbut some of them had unacknowledged wives.[253]\r\n\r\nIn 1128, at a national synod held in London, the synod resigned the\r\ndealing with the recalcitrant clergy into the king’s hands. The king\r\n(Henry I.) disappointed the archbishops by abstaining from any attempt to\r\nenforce celibacy on the clergy, but he ingeniously took advantage of the\r\nopportunity to raise a revenue out of them by permitting the clergy to\r\nretain their wives on payment of a fee for the licence to do so. The king\r\nwas said to have raised a great sum of money by this device, which implies\r\nthat a great number of the clergy were married and retained their wives.\r\nKing John, on the publication of the Interdict, seized the wives of the\r\nclergy, and only released them on payment of heavy ransom.\r\n\r\nSynod after synod continued to legislate against them.[254]\r\n\r\n    In 1222, a synod held at Oxford, under Archbishop Stephen Langton,\r\n    enacted that if beneficed men or men in sacred orders should presume\r\n    to retain their partners publicly in their dwelling-houses\r\n    (_hospitiis_), or should elsewhere have public access to them to the\r\n    public scandal, they should be coerced by the withdrawal of their\r\n    benefice; and that the clergy might not leave such partners (_i.e._\r\n    wives) anything in their wills. It also attacked the poor wives,\r\n    enacting that if they did not leave their partners they should be\r\n    excluded from the church and the sacraments; if that did not suffice,\r\n    they should be stricken with the sword of excommunication; and,\r\n    lastly, the secular arm should be invoked against them.[255]\r\n\r\n    Archbishop Richard of Wethershead, in 1229 or 1230 repeated the decree\r\n    that men of the order of sub-deacon and upwards who had married should\r\n    put away their wives, though they were unwilling and refused to\r\n    consent,[256] and if they persisted in having publicly a female\r\n    partner, should, after a first, second, and third warning, be deprived\r\n    of every benefice and office.\r\n\r\n    St. Edmund the Canonized Archbishop, in 1234 or 1235, enacted that if\r\n    any clerics who had been suspended for incontinency should presume to\r\n    continue to exercise their office they should be deprived of their\r\n    benefices, and for their double fault _perpetuo damnentur_. He tries\r\n    to make the rectors inform against the clerics in their parishes,\r\n    threatening that if a case comes to his knowledge by common report\r\n    before the rector has given in his accusation against his brother, the\r\n    rector shall be taken to have known of it, and shall be punished as a\r\n    partaker in the sin. Lastly, he decrees that prelates (archdeacons,\r\n    officials, and rural deans) who presume to support such persons in\r\n    their iniquity, especially for the offer of money or of any other\r\n    temporal advantage, shall be subject to the same penalty.\r\n\r\n    In 1237, Cardinal Otho came from Rome at the request of the king\r\n    (Henry III.), unknown to the nobles, and summoned a national council\r\n    at St. Paul’s. It was understood that he was going to make strong\r\n    decrees against the abuses of the clergy, and especially against the\r\n    pluralists and the illegitimates, and feeling ran so high among the\r\n    clergy that the legate obtained from the king an attendance of some\r\n    nobles, and a guard of some armed knights and about two hundred\r\n    soldiers, who were placed in ambush for his protection. The decree\r\n    against the pluralists was so vehemently opposed that the cardinal\r\n    postponed this question till the Pope could be appealed to.\r\n\r\n    The canon against the married clergy declared that unless clerks,\r\n    especially those in holy orders, who publicly keep concubines in their\r\n    houses, or in those of others’, dismiss them therefrom within a month,\r\n    they shall be suspended from every office and benefice, and if they\r\n    persist, shall be deprived. And “we strictly order that archbishops\r\n    and bishops shall make diligent inquiries throughout all their\r\n    deaneries, and that what we have decreed shall be observed.”\r\n\r\n    The canon on sons of priests forbade the prelates from presuming\r\n    henceforth under any pretext, or by any fraud, to appoint or admit any\r\n    to benefices which their fathers held by any kind of title, either to\r\n    the whole or to part, and that they who already hold such benefices\r\n    shall be deprived.\r\n\r\n    In 1265, Cardinal Othobon presided over a national council at London,\r\n    which was of great authority, and was regarded subsequently as a rule\r\n    of discipline for the English Church, in which the preceding\r\n    legislation was again repeated.\r\n\r\n    The Council of Reading, under Archbishop Peckham, in 1279, refers to\r\n    the canon of Othobon _contra concubinarios_, and orders that\r\n    archdeacons shall read it at their visitations and see that it is read\r\n    by the rural deans at their chapters (the laity being excluded), and\r\n    in case of neglect they shall fast on bread and water on the six week\r\n    days (unless infirmity hinder them) until they have read or caused it\r\n    to be read at the next chapter.\r\n\r\nWere the laity excluded to screen the infirmities of their pastors, or\r\nbecause the expression of lay dissent would have encouraged the clergy in\r\ntheir contumacy? May we conjecture that, in spite of the urgent commands\r\nof the archbishop, the reading of the canon was often omitted, and that\r\nthe archdeacons and rural deans excused themselves from the consequent\r\npenance under favour of the saving clause?[257]\r\n\r\nThe legislation is itself a witness to the existence of the practices\r\nwhich it tries to suppress. We need no further proof that in the\r\nthirteenth century many of the clergy were married men, that in some cases\r\nthey lived openly with their wives in their dwelling-houses, or, in other\r\ncases, they visited them openly in separate houses provided for them; that\r\nthey refused to give them up in spite of repeated synodical decrees; that\r\nclerics who were not themselves married countenanced their married\r\nbrethren; that even the dignified officials whose business it was to take\r\nproceedings against them, hung back from doing so.\r\n\r\nAfter the middle of the fourteenth century this subject disappears from\r\nthe acts of the synods; not because the clergy had come universally to\r\nobey the former canons, but because the question had found a solution,\r\nwhich we proceed to describe. Celibacy was confessedly not a Divine\r\nordinance, but an ecclesiastical regulation, and so long as the two evils\r\nwere avoided (1) of the parochial benefices being overburdened by the\r\ndemands of an avowed family; and (2) of the hereditary descent of\r\nbenefices by the absence of lawful heirs; the ecclesiastical authorities\r\nmight be satisfied with the obedience of a large proportion of the clergy,\r\nand willing to connive at the solution of the question to which the rest\r\nresorted.\r\n\r\nThe solution was as follows: The secular cleric was not bound by any\r\nDivine ordinance to celibacy, and did not, like the monks, take any vow of\r\ncelibacy on admission to Orders. It was only an ecclesiastical regulation;\r\nand he took leave to evade the canon. If he married, the marriage was not\r\nvoid in itself, it was only voidable if brought before the Ecclesiastical\r\nCourt during the lifetime of the parties; but he had taken his precautions\r\nin view of that contingency; the marriage was irregularly performed in\r\nsome particular, or performed in such circumstances that it was incapable\r\nof legal proof. It was something like the morganatic marriages of German\r\nprinces, illegal, derogatory, not conferring on wife and children the\r\nstatus and rights of legal wife and children, but still not in fact, or in\r\nthe estimation of society, immoral and disreputable.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious that in the fifteenth century there were many\r\necclesiastics, from the popes downwards, who had wives, but not living in\r\ntheir houses, and not presented to the world as wives,[258] and they had\r\nchildren who were presented to the world as nephews and nieces. Warham,\r\nthe last Archbishop of Canterbury before the Reformation, is said (by\r\nErasmus[259]) to have had a wife who was not secluded from the knowledge\r\nand society of his friends; Cranmer certainly married his second wife, the\r\nniece of Osiander, before he was archbishop, and did not sever his ties\r\nwith her after he became archbishop. And it is clear that these relations\r\nwere not regarded as immoral and disgraceful; in fact, the common sense of\r\nmankind gives easy absolution for the breach of inequitable laws.[260]\r\n\r\nBut there is no doubt that the ambiguity of such relations, at the best,\r\nlaid open those who entered into them to just censure, and must have\r\nlowered their own moral tone and that of those thus connected with them.\r\nNeither is it to be denied that enforced celibacy, and the loose notions\r\nencouraged by such connections as those here described, led to a certain\r\namount of profligacy which admits of no excuse or palliation.\r\n\r\nSo the ultramontane policy at length won a victory--of a sort. It\r\nsucceeded in preventing the clergy from having wives by conniving at their\r\nconcubines; it left no legitimate sons of rectors to claim the heritage of\r\ntheir fathers’ benefices, and gave dispensations to their illegitimate\r\nsons; it established a celibate priesthood, with all the scandals and\r\nsuspicions associated with it; it withdrew its clergy from the ordinary\r\naffairs of life, and at the same time from the leadership of the current\r\npractical life of the people. In a biting phrase of the time of Matthew\r\nParis, “The pope deprived the clergy of sons, and the devil sent them\r\nnephews.”\r\n\r\nWe have given a--perhaps disproportionately--long chapter to a not very\r\nagreeable subject; but it seemed desirable to take the pains necessary to\r\nput the matter in its proper light, and not to allow the Englishmen of the\r\ngreat period, from the twelfth to the sixteenth century, to lie under the\r\nsuspicion of being so ungodly that the clergy generally lived in open\r\nimmorality, and the laity thought little the worse of them for it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAn entry in a MS. Book of Ecclesiastical Causes reveals the possible\r\ncomplications which might arise out of these marriages. Marriages of the\r\nclergy were not null and void, they were only voidable by proceedings\r\nwhich must be taken in the lifetime of the parties. So that it was always\r\npossible that the children of such a marriage might after their father’s\r\ndeath claim as heirs to his estate, and might have the means of proving\r\ntheir parents’ marriage; in which case they would inherit to the exclusion\r\nof those who had thought themselves the heirs. For example, Sir John de\r\nSudley, knight, and Elizabeth, wife of Sir Baldwyn de Frevyle, knight,\r\nrelatives and heirs of Peter, the uncle of the said Sir John, a\r\nsub-deacon, alleged that marriage had been contracted by the said\r\nsub-deacon, to their exclusion from the heirship, and prayed that the\r\nmarriage might be pronounced null, lest the children of the said\r\nsub-deacon should claim his heirship. Sir Peter de Montford seems to be\r\nthe name of the sub-deacon aforesaid, and Margaret Furnivale that of his\r\nwife.[261]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChaucer, in “The Miller’s Tale,” seems incidentally to show what was the\r\npopular view of the children of a cleric. The Miller, a Yeoman, a man of\r\ncomparative wealth and consideration in his village, had married a\r\nparson’s daughter:--\r\n\r\n  A wife he hadde commen of noble kin,\r\n  The parson of the town her father was.\r\n\r\nHer “noble kin” points perhaps to the fact that the parson of the town was\r\nof the family of the lord of the manor. She had received the education of\r\na lady--\r\n\r\n  She was yfostered in a nonnerie.\r\n\r\nAs to her personal character--\r\n\r\n  She was proud and pert as is a pie.\r\n\r\nNext the poet puts upon his stage the daughter of this worthy pair--\r\n\r\n  A daughter hadden they betwixt them two;\r\n\r\nand it is what he says about this young lady which proves most clearly\r\nthat neither mother nor daughter suffered in the estimation of society\r\nfrom the condition of their birth:\r\n\r\n  The parson of the town, for she was faire,\r\n  In purpose was to maken her his heire\r\n  Both of his catel and of his messuage,\r\n  And strange he made it of her marriage;\r\n  His purpose was for to bestow her hie\r\n  Into some worthie blood of ancestrie.\r\n\r\nGeoffrey of Childewick, a knight, married Clarissa, the daughter of a\r\ncountry priest, but she was the sister of the famous John Mansell, the\r\nminister of Henry III.\r\n\r\nA man was called priest’s son, not as a nickname, but as a surname\r\nrecognized in formal legal documents, as in the “Pleas of the Crown,” c.\r\n1220, Hugo Clark appeals _Paganus filius Sacerdotis_ and others of having\r\nbeaten him and broken his teeth, etc.[262]\r\n\r\nThe subject is rather fully illustrated in the MS. _Omne Bonum_ (Royal 6\r\nE. VI.) of the fourteenth century in the British Museum. At f. 295, under\r\nthe title _Clericorum et mulierum cohabitatio_, is a quaint picture of a\r\nbishop parting a group of clergy from a group of women. At f. 296 _verso_,\r\nunder the title _De clericis conjugatio_, is represented a group of clergy\r\non the left, a group of women on the right, and a cradle containing a baby\r\nbetween the two groups; the text is on the penalties against clerical\r\nmarriages, but it calls the women _uxores_--wives. Again, in the second\r\nvolume of the work (Royal 6 E. VII.), at f. 138, under the title _Filii\r\nPresbyterum_, the picture shows three priests on the left, and women on\r\nthe right, with three children kneeling between them; the text is on the\r\ndisabilities of sons of priests.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother branch of the same subject is the determination of the rulers of\r\nthe Church that the sons of clerics should not be allowed to succeed to\r\ntheir fathers’ benefices. The hereditary succession of the semi-secular\r\nSaxon monasteries afforded a venerable precedent for doing so. The\r\ntendency of the feudal system was to make all offices hereditary, and the\r\npractice was growing up of making church benefices hereditary, and\r\ntreating them like lay fiefs; _e.g._ dividing them between two or more\r\nsons, as if they were an ordinary estate; demanding a fine from a new\r\nrector as the lord of the manor did from a new tenant; making the\r\ncondition that the presentee should give up this or that ancient\r\npossession of the benefice, or should pay an annual pension to the patron.\r\nThe end of this would have been that the benefices of the church would\r\nhave become hereditary, impaired, and secularized.\r\n\r\nHow far the mischief had already gone is illustrated by two or three\r\nexamples which we are able to quote.[263] In York, immediately after the\r\nConquest, there was something very like a succession to the\r\narchbishopric. The provostship of Hexham descended from father to son, all\r\nof them being priests. The Deans of Whalley and Kettelwell, ecclesiastics\r\nof great jurisdiction and influence, were married, and their offices\r\ndescended from father to son for generations. In the episcopal registers\r\nwe find from time to time sons succeeding their fathers well on in the\r\nthirteenth century, notwithstanding the canons and synods which prohibited\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe great act of defence against this danger which threatened was the\r\ncanon which forbade the son of a parson to succeed to his father’s\r\nbenefice. The canon was re-enacted from time to time, but not without\r\noccasional instances of strenuous resistance. Thus, in 1235, Alexander,\r\nBishop of Coventry, complained to Pope Gregory IX., that certain rectors,\r\nsons of priests, presumed to occupy their fathers’ benefices by force of\r\narms; and in some cases where fit incumbents had been placed, the priest’s\r\nsons had threatened them with injury to members and life, so that they\r\nfeared to dwell there; and he asks the pope’s protection.[264] The pope\r\ntells him to deprive them of all their benefices.[265]\r\n\r\nSome of the results of the state of things above described appear very\r\nfrequently in the bishops’ registers. Illegitimacy, we have seen, was one\r\nof the defects which stood in the way of a man’s ordination, and the son\r\nof a priest was regarded by the canons as illegitimate; but the bishop\r\ncould, if he pleased, give a dispensation which removed the barrier, and\r\nthere are many records of such dispensations.[266] Sometimes the\r\ndispensation only admits the grantee to take minor orders, sometimes “to\r\ntake all the sacred orders, and to hold ecclesiastical benefices even with\r\ncure of souls.” In the Register of Bishop Quivil, of Exeter, 1282, is a\r\nrecord of a _Dispensatio super defectu natalium_ granted to J. de\r\nAxemuthe, the defect being that he was _de presbytero genitus et soluta_.\r\nSo, in the Exeter Register of Bishop Stapledon, J. de Hurbestone, clerk,\r\nin 1308, had a dispensation, being _de presbytero genitus et soluta_.\r\n_Soluta_ means single woman, but in the eye of the canon law and of the\r\nbishop, the wife of a priest would be _soluta_, so that these may be cases\r\nnot of immorality, but of married priests. In the Register of Montacute,\r\nBishop of Ely, is a record of a dispensation (1338) to the son of Ada\r\nBray, of Canterbury, _qui patre de presbytero genitus_, to be promoted to\r\nall minor orders.[267] In a great number of cases the nature of the\r\nillegitimacy is _soluto genitus et soluta_--born of a single man and\r\nsingle woman; it is very possible that a number of sons of the clergy may\r\nbe included in this formal legal description also.\r\n\r\nSometimes a man, refused perhaps by his own bishop, went to Rome for a\r\ndispensation, and obtained it.[268] Sometimes the Papal Court gave a\r\npriest’s son license to be promoted to any dignity _short of a\r\nbishopric_.[269]\r\n\r\nIf a man, being thus disqualified, neglected to obtain a proper\r\ndispensation, he might find the neglect a serious difficulty in\r\nafter-life, or if he failed to have at hand the proof of his dispensation;\r\nthus, in 1234, it was objected to Thomas de Melsonby, prior of Durham,\r\nthat he was the son of a rector of Melsonby, and born while his father was\r\nin holy orders.[270] Similarly on Feb. 20, 1308-9, Stapledon, bishop of\r\nExeter, in the chapter-house of Launceston Priory, admonished the prior on\r\npain of deprivation to exhibit, within two years, to himself or his\r\nsuccessors, his “_Privilegium_” by virtue of which he retained the\r\ndignity, being illegitimate. He appeared within the term and satisfied the\r\nbishop, and was discharged.[271]\r\n\r\nIt appears that those who were thrust out on this ground were treated with\r\nsome consideration. In 1126, Wm. de Ruley was deprived of the Church of\r\nRuley, on the ground that he was the son of the last minister; but the\r\narchbishop assigned to him the tithes of a chapelry in the parish for his\r\nsupport during his life.[272] The mandate for the removal of Peter of\r\nWivertorp from the Church of Wivertorp, for the same reason, concludes\r\nwith the note, _salva pensione_, from which we infer that all incumbents\r\nremoved for this cause were entitled to, or at least were usually granted,\r\na pension. But Peter of Wivertorp did not rest content with his\r\ndeprivation. He made friends at the Court of Rome, representing that his\r\nfather was married when in minor orders, and that he himself had held the\r\nbenefice for ten years; and obtained a letter from Pope Honorius\r\ninterceding for him, that he should be allowed to retain Wivertorp till\r\nthe archbishop gave him some other competent living.[273]\r\n\r\nThe curt, formal entries in these musty records sometimes seem to give us\r\na glimpse into men’s hearts and lives: John Curteys, Vicar of Hobeche, in\r\nhis will, made in 1418, leaves all his lands in Holbeach and Quappelode,\r\nto William Curteys for life, on condition that he shall become a priest as\r\nsoon as possible after obtaining his legitimation, to celebrate for the\r\nsouls of his parents; the remainder for pious uses.[274] We venture to\r\nconjecture that John Curteys, the vicar, in view of his approaching end,\r\nwas uneasy in his conscience about the uncanonical marriage of which\r\nWilliam was the offspring; therefore he thus appeals to his son to obtain\r\nas rapidly as may be a dispensation, and ordination to the priesthood;\r\nand then to use continually during his future life his priestly office in\r\npraying for the souls of his erring parents.\r\n\r\nThe author of “Piers Plowman’s Vision” includes these dispensations to\r\npriests’ sons, and sons of serfs, among the abuses of his time, in lines\r\nwhich are worth quoting--\r\n\r\n  For should no clerk be crowned,[275] But if he come were\r\n  Of franklins and freemen, And of folk wedded.\r\n  Bondmen[276] and bastards, And beggars’ children,[276]\r\n  These belong to labour, And lord’s children should serve\r\n  Both God and good men As their degree askith.\r\n  Some to sing masses, Others to sit and write,\r\n  Reade and receive, What Reason ought to spend.\r\n  And since bondmen’s bairns Have been made bishops,\r\n  And bastard bairns Have been archdeacons,\r\n  And cobblers and their sons For silver have been knights,\r\n  And monks and monials, That mendicants should feed,[277]\r\n  Have made their kin knights, And knights’ fees purchased,\r\n  Popes and Patrons Poor gentle blood refuse,\r\n  And take Simond’s son, Sanctuary to keep.\r\n  Life holiness and love Have been long hence,\r\n  And will, till it be weared out Or otherwise ychanged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nVISITATION ARTICLES AND RETURNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe visitation of the parishes by the Ordinary--the ecclesiastical person\r\nwho exercised spiritual jurisdiction over them[278]--was an important\r\nfeature of ecclesiastical administration.[279] We have seen that a canon\r\nof the famous Council of Clovesho, in 747, directed bishops to make an\r\nannual visitation of their dioceses. As time went on the duty, burdensome\r\nalike to the bishops and clergy, fell into disuse, and seems to have been\r\nresumed again in the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nThe Lateran Council of 1179 made a canon to check the costs of\r\nvisitations: it decreed that an archbishop visiting churches should be\r\ncontent with forty or fifty horses; a bishop with twenty or thirty; an\r\narchdeacon with five or seven; and a dean was not to exceed two.[280] The\r\nPontificals contain the “Order of Visiting Parishes:”[281] the bishop is\r\nto be met by the clergy in procession outside the gates; Mass is to be\r\nsaid; the bishop is to tell the people the purpose of his coming, viz. (1)\r\nto absolve the souls of the departed; (2) to see how the Church is\r\ngoverned, the condition of its vestments, the lives of the clergy, etc.;\r\n(3) to inquire into the sins of the laity; (4) to take cognizance of\r\nmatters which belong to the bishop; (5) to confirm children; also he is to\r\npreach a sermon on the sacraments, etc.[282]\r\n\r\nFrom these visitations we obtain full and reliable information as to the\r\npersonal character and conduct of the parish clergy and their fulfilment\r\nof their duties. Five or six of the parishioners, called _testes\r\nsynodales_,[283] or questmen, were sworn to give, besides a return of the\r\ncondition of the church and its furniture, a true answer to certain\r\nquestions about their clergy, viz. the rector or vicar, the chaplains, and\r\nthe clerk.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHugh of Wells, Bishop of Lincoln (c. 1232), issued a paper of twenty-nine\r\nquestions to his clergy, which is perhaps the earliest of Visitation\r\nArticles (“Lincoln,” p. 134, S.P.C.K.). Grostete issued Articles of\r\nInquiry about 1250; and similar articles were issued by Roger Weseham,\r\nBishop of Lichfield, in 1252. In the year 1253 these following inquiries\r\nwere made “in each and every diocese of the whole kingdom of England”\r\nconcerning the life and conversation of both clerks and laymen:--[284]\r\n\r\n    1, 2, 3, 4 are about sensual sins on the part of the laity. 5. Whether\r\n    any laymen are drunkards, or habitually frequent taverns, or practise\r\n    usury of any kind. 6. Receive the free land of any church to farm. 7.\r\n    Or receive in their fee the tithes of any church. 8. Whether rents\r\n    assigned to lights or other specified uses of the church are converted\r\n    to the use of the rector or vicar. 9. Whether any layman is compelled\r\n    to communicate and offer after mass on Easter Day.[285] 10. Whether\r\n    any layman or other of whatever condition or reputation (_famæ_)\r\n    _perierit conscio rectore vel vicario loci_. 11. Whether any layman is\r\n    notably proud, or envious, or avaricious, or slothful, or malicious,\r\n    or gluttonous, or luxurious [the seven deadly sins]. 12. Whether any\r\n    layman causes markets, or plays or pleas (_placita peculiaria_) to be\r\n    held in sacred places, and whether these things have been prohibited\r\n    on the part of the bishop. 13. Whether any laymen have played at\r\n    “Rams” (_elevaverint arietes_[286]), or caused scotales to be held,\r\n    or have contended for precedence with their banners in their\r\n    visitation of the mother church. 14.

Whether markets are held by any\r\n    one on the Lord’s day.\r\n\r\nThe answers show that the _testes synodales_ did not scruple to find fault\r\nwhen they had cause, and perhaps sometimes when they had not much cause.\r\nWe gather a few of the returns from the diocese of Exeter at Bishop\r\nStapledon’s Visitation in 1301,[289] as examples--\r\n\r\n_Sidbury._--Walter the Vicar, _optime se habet in omnibus, bene predicans,\r\net officium sácrum sacerdotale laudabiliter exercens. Similiter et Clerici\r\nhonestè se gerunt._\r\n\r\n_Branscombe._--Thomas the Vicar conducts himself well in all things, and\r\npreaches willingly (_libenter_), and diligently does all things which\r\nbelong to the office of a priest.\r\n\r\nThe returns from many parishes are equally satisfactory. We take more\r\ninterest, perhaps, in those in which the failings of the clergy are\r\npointed out. Here are some of them--\r\n\r\n_Culmstock._--William the Vicar is a man of good life and honest\r\nconversation, and his clerk likewise, and well instructs his parishioners.\r\nIn the visitation of the sick and baptizing the children, and in all\r\nthings which belong to his office, they know nothing to be found fault\r\nwith in him, with the exception that he makes too little pause between the\r\nmatins and mass on festival days.[290]\r\n\r\n_Colyton._--Sir Robert the Vicar is a good man (_probus homo_), and\r\npreaches to them so far as he knows (_quatenus novit_), but not\r\n_sufficienter_, as it seems to them. They say also that his predecessors\r\nwere accustomed to call the friars to instruct them about their souls’\r\nsalvation, but he does not care for them; and if by chance they come he\r\ndoes not receive them, nor give them entertainment (_viatica_); whereof\r\nthey pray that he may be admonished. Item, all the chaplains and clerks of\r\nthe church live _honestè et continentes_.[291]\r\n\r\nAt a later visitation, in 1330, the synodsmen of Colyton complain that\r\ntheir vicar had been struck with leprosy, but continued to come to\r\ncommunion with the parishioners at the risk of contaminating the whole\r\nflock, which was a scandal. They report that they used to have one\r\nsufficient vicar, one fit parochial chaplain, one deacon, and two clerks\r\nserving in the said church of the alms of the parishioners, and that the\r\nvicar used to find that number, out of whom they have now only one\r\nchaplain and one clerk, and that the said vicar refuses to supply more.\r\nThey complain that the vicar chooses his parish clerk at his own pleasure,\r\nand will not _manucipere pro eodem_. They say that the clerks of the\r\nchurch used by custom to ring the curfew, and at the elevation of the\r\n_corpus domini_.\r\n\r\nThey complain that John Prouz (lord of the manor of Gatcombe, in the\r\nparish) is not willing to contribute with the other parishioners to the\r\nchurch, nor to do other things which belong to him. They say that Sir Hugo\r\nProuz, father of the said John, knight, deceased, left 10 marks sterling\r\nto the fabric of the church of Colyton, which the heirs refuse to\r\npay.[292]\r\n\r\n_Colebrook._--Hugh de Coppelestone and other trustworthy men of the\r\nparish, lawfully requisitioned and examined, say that Sir William the\r\nVicar preaches after his own fashion (_suo modo_); also he expounds to\r\nthem the Gospels on the Lord’s Days so far as he knows (_quatenus novit_);\r\nbut concerning the Articles of the Faith, the Commandments of the\r\nDecalogue, and the mortal sins, he does not teach them much. And he does\r\nnot say his matins with note on the more solemn days, and only celebrates\r\non the week days every other day. He is defamed of incontinency with Lucia\r\nde la Stubbe, a married woman (_conjugata_). All his houses, except the\r\nhall and chamber, which were in a good state at his coming, are now\r\nfalling to pieces and threatening to come down, and could not be made good\r\nfor a hundred shillings. Also his gate is so far from the hall, which he\r\nhas lately lengthened, that one calling without is not heard in the hall,\r\nwhich is dangerous for the sick parishioners.[293]\r\n\r\n_St. Mary Church._--The parishioners have some complaints to make about\r\nbusiness matters between themselves and the vicar, but finally testify\r\nthat he preaches well and exercises his office laudably in all things when\r\nhe is present; but that he is often absent, and stays at Moreton sometimes\r\nfor fifteen days, sometimes for eight, so that they have not a chaplain,\r\nunless when Sir Walter, the chaplain of the archdeacon, is present, or\r\nsome one can by chance be obtained from some other place.\r\n\r\n_Dawlash._--In Bishop Stapledon’s Visitation, in 1301, the _synodales_ say\r\nthat the vicar, who has the reputation of being a good man, does not\r\nreside in person, but has in his place Sir Adam, a chaplain, who conducts\r\nhimself _bene et honeste_, and teaches them excellently in spiritual\r\nmatters. But Randulphus the chaplain has had his concubine for ten years\r\nor more, and, often corrected for it (_sæpius inde correptus_), remains\r\nincorrigible. The clerk of the church is _continens et honestus_.\r\n\r\nAn important testimony to the estimation in which the clergy were\r\ngenerally held by their parishioners, is afforded by the fact that it was\r\nvery usual for the people to seek their assistance in making their wills,\r\nand also to appoint them as executors, to see to the due carrying out of\r\ntheir testamentary arrangements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nPROVISION FOR OLD AGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have followed our parish priest through various phases of his life and\r\nwork; there remains one more--before that last one through which all\r\npriests and people must pass--on which the records throw a considerable\r\namount of light. Parish priests grow old--sometimes old and infirm and\r\nincapable of fulfilling the duties of their position. What to do with\r\nthem, in fairness to them and in fairness to the parishioners, is a\r\nproblem which perplexes us at this moment. Then, as now, if the income of\r\nthe benefice, or the private income of the incumbent, enabled him to\r\nobtain the help of a competent chaplain, that was accepted as on the whole\r\nthe best solution. It permitted the old pastor to end his days among his\r\npeople, and still to be the friend and counsellor of those who cared to\r\nseek him. The difficulty then, as now, is in the case of a benefice which\r\nis too poor both to give a competent maintenance to the old incumbent and\r\nto engage the services of a competent _locum tenens_. We find from not\r\ninfrequent records of such cases in the bishops’ registers that, to begin\r\nwith, the bishop sequestrated the benefice, usually appointing a\r\nneighbouring clergyman as sequestrator. Then, in the arrangement of\r\nmatters, it seems to have been thought right always to leave the old\r\nincumbent to end his days among his own people and in his own house, with\r\na sufficient maintenance out of the income of the benefice. On the other\r\nhand, in justice to the parish, a chaplain was appointed who took\r\nindependent charge of the parish. It would seem that this coadjutor\r\nusually lived in the parsonage house, or part of it, not as the guest of\r\nthe old incumbent, but rather as his host, except where the premises were\r\nformally divided into two tenements for the independent accommodation of\r\nboth. It will be borne in mind that the celibate condition of the clergy\r\nwould make the arrangement of such cases much more easy in those times\r\nthan in these.\r\n\r\nThe unwillingness of an infirm vicar to be disturbed was met in the way\r\nillustrated by this individual case: In 1322 the patron of the parish of\r\nLetton, Herefordshire, complained to the bishop that the rector, Milo by\r\nname, had, from old age and ill health, been absent from his church during\r\nmany years without licence of non-residence, though often admonished to\r\nreside. The bishop issued a commission, consisting of neighbouring\r\nincumbents, to inquire. They replied that Milo had not resided for ten\r\nyears, that the services had been very badly done by numerous chaplains,\r\nand the parishioners grossly neglected, and that the rectory house and\r\nbuildings were falling into decay. A coadjutor was appointed by the bishop\r\nto assist him in the cure of his parish.[294]\r\n\r\nHere are some illustrative cases of a more satisfactory kind. Philip de\r\nHarwodelme, Rector of Bigby--it is recorded in the Register of Bishop\r\nQuivil, of Exeter,[295] in 1286--being so cast down by disease and broken\r\nby old age as to feel himself entirely unequal to the care of the souls of\r\nthe parishioners, had a retiring pension assigned to him of twenty marks,\r\nout of the great tithes of the parish. This is a very simple solution of\r\nthe difficulty, since the pension, equal to £13, was an ample one, and, it\r\nis to be assumed, the benefice large enough to spare it.[296]\r\n\r\nIn 1309, William de Tres ... Vicar of Perran Zabulo, being very old and\r\ninfirm, Bishop Stapledon grants a sequestration of the living to Sir Wm.\r\nde Mileborne, Rector of Lanhorne; and an arrangement is made by which\r\nMichael de Newroneck is appointed coadjutor to the old vicar, and is to\r\npay him two shillings a-week for his sustenance; and out of the rest of\r\nthe benefice is to live himself and maintain hospitality, and pay all\r\ncharges on the living.\r\n\r\nIn 1316, the bishop appointed Thomas de Dylington, Rector of Cumbfflorie,\r\nas coadjutor to the Rector of Lidiard St. Lawrence, who is blind, old,\r\nand broken in health; the appointment is made subject to revocation at\r\nthe bishop’s pleasure.\r\n\r\nIn appointing a coadjutor to Sir Wm., Vicar of St. Colan, on account of\r\nhis great infirmity, it is stated in Bishop Stapledon’s Register that the\r\ncoadjutor is to take charge of the goods, etc., of the vicarage. And so in\r\nthe case of Sir Henry, Vicar of Constantine, a coadjutor is appointed by\r\nthe same bishop, who is to take an inventory of the vicar’s goods, and to\r\nhave the vicar and his goods in his care, and to provide honourably for\r\nthe vicar and his family.\r\n\r\nIn the Registers of Lichfield Diocese, we find the incumbents of\r\nStoke-on-Terne, Uttoxeter, St. Peter’s, Derby, etc., resigning on a\r\npension secured by the oath of their successors; and chaplains assigned to\r\nthe Vicar of Lapley, who is old and blind, and the Rector of Maxstoke,\r\nbecause he is infirm; and so in other dioceses.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement between the vicar and his successor does not always work\r\nquite smoothly. This seems to be the explanation of the action of Bishop\r\nStapledon, of Exeter, who, in 1326, admonishes Barthol de More, Vicar of\r\nKynstock by the resignation of John Mon, who is decrepit, to continual\r\nresidence, and to take oath to maintain the said John as long as he lives.\r\nBut soon after a more definite arrangement is made that “lest, in process\r\nof time, to the scandal of the clergy, the said John should be compelled\r\nmiserably to beg, he shall receive a payment of six marks of silver, viz.\r\n40_s._ at St. Michael, and 40_s._ at Easter.”\r\n\r\nCases difficult to deal with sometimes occurred. Considering the\r\nprevalence of leprosy from the twelfth to the fifteenth centuries, it is\r\nnot wonderful to find the vicar of a parish among the victims of the\r\ndreadful disease. We have met with one case in the preceding chapter of a\r\nVicar of Colyton, in Exeter diocese, in 1330. We are not told what steps\r\nthe bishop took in that case; but in a similar case at St. Neot’s, in the\r\nsame diocese, the vicar being struck with leprosy, Bishop Stapledon\r\nappointed Ralph de Roydene, chaplain, to be his coadjutor, and gave the\r\nvicar and the living into the custody of the coadjutor. The bishop orders\r\nthat since the vicar cannot, without danger, have intercourse with the\r\nwhole people as he has been accustomed, the vicar shall have the better\r\nchamber (_meliorem cameram_) with the houses adjoining it, except the\r\nhall, to live, and eat, and drink in; and that the entrance should be\r\nclosed between the said chamber and the hall, and a new entrance made to\r\nthe said chamber externally in a suitable place, by which the vicar, when\r\nneed is, can have ingress and egress; and a _cloaca_, likewise, to the\r\nsaid chamber, in a fitting place. The said Sir Ralph shall pay to the said\r\nvicar every week for his maintenance in food, drink, and firing, and other\r\nsmall necessaries, 2_s._ sterling, and yearly on the feast of St. Michael,\r\nor thereabout, 20_s._ for his robe; also he shall keep in repair the\r\nhouses of the said vicarage, both those which the vicar inhabits, and all\r\nthe other buildings of the vicarage, and shall undertake and see after all\r\nother burdens belonging to the said vicarage.[297]\r\n\r\nThere is a case in the Chichester Register in which the master and\r\nbrethren of the college of the Holy Trinity, Arundel, petition the bishop\r\nto give a pension to Wm. Rateford, resigning the Vicarage of Kurdford,\r\nlest he come to beggary, to the scandal of the clergy.\r\n\r\nIn another Chichester case, Thomas Bolle, Rector of Aldrington, Sussex,\r\nhaving resigned his living in 1402, applied to the bishop, Robert Rede,\r\nfor leave to build a cell against the wall of the church, in which he\r\nmight be shut up--as a recluse--for the rest of his life. The license was\r\ngranted, and the Reclusorium remains to this day in the shape of a room 29\r\nft. by 25 ft., with ingress to the chapel of the Blessed Virgin on the\r\nnorth side of the church.[298]\r\n\r\nIn 1422, Spofford, Bishop of Hereford, instituted a vicar to the parish of\r\nDilwyn, in the place of Walter Robins, to whom, as having discharged his\r\nduties in a laudable manner, a pension of 40_s._ is assigned, to prevent\r\nhis falling into beggary, and so becoming a scandal to the Church. His\r\npension is to begin fifteen days after his resignation, and to be paid\r\nquarterly. He is to have a chamber in the vicarage house on the ground\r\nfloor (_bassam cameram_), with a fireplace in it, and near the entrance\r\ndoor (_hostium actuale_), with free ingress and egress, and power of\r\nredress in case of failure in punctuality of payment.[299]\r\n\r\nIn the adjoining parish of Webley, a vicar retiring in 1440 is to receive\r\neight marks, a room on the ground floor, the use of the vicarage kitchen,\r\nwell, and garden; and the incoming incumbent is to assure these benefits\r\nby oath.\r\n\r\nBeneficed clergymen had a freehold in their benefices, and therefore a\r\nlegal claim for provision in old age, not so with unbeneficed men; but we\r\nmeet with a few examples of kindly care for them. For example: In 1237 the\r\nBishop of Durham obtained the papal licence to place certain clerks of his\r\ndiocese who have become old, weak, and blind in a house together, and\r\nassign the tithe of his wills for their support;[300] Thomas Ricard, in\r\n1433, leaves, “to John Wright, chaplain, because he is blind and poor, a\r\nmark per annum for life.”[301]\r\n\r\nWilliam Malham, of Elslack, absentee rector--being a master in\r\nChancery--of the parish of Marton, Yorks, in the beginning of the reign of\r\nHenry VIII., writes to his brother: “I will Sir W. Martindale be Parish\r\nPriest at Marton, and to have like wages as Sir W. Hodgson had, and Sir W.\r\nHodgson to have six marks yearly, during his life, to tarry at Marton, and\r\npraye for me and my mother’s and father’s sawles. They both to begin their\r\nservice at midsomer next coming.” This seems to be a kindly way of\r\npensioning off an old parish chaplain.[302]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf the reader wishes to follow our parish priest to the grave, and join\r\nin his obsequies, he may turn to pp. 452 and 457, where he will find\r\nsufficient suggestions to enable him to reproduce the funeral and the\r\nfuneral service, and the month’s-mind and obit. The wills of priests\r\nsometimes give directions for their monuments; for example, in 1384,\r\nMichael Northburgh, Canon of Chichester, and Rector of Hampstap, willed to\r\nbe buried in Chichester Cathedral, in a spot which he minutely describes:\r\n“A marble stone to be placed over my grave with a half statue like that of\r\nMgr. William Blythe, with this inscription: Hic jacet Michael\r\nNorthborough, quondam Canonicus Ecclie Cicestren. et Rector Ecclie de\r\nHampstap, cuius Aīē P’picietur Deus. Amen. And the statue to hold a scroll\r\nin its hands with the words, Miseremini mei, Miseremini mei, saltem bos\r\nAmici, quia Manus Domini tetigit me.”[303]\r\n\r\nWilliam of Duffield, Chaplain of St. Martin’s, in Coney Street, York (A.D.\r\n1361), left 20_s._ to buy a gravestone for himself, and 3_s._ 4_d._ for\r\nworkmanship and sculpturing a chalice thereon.[304]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE PARISH CLERK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parish clerk seems to have existed about as long as the parish priest,\r\nif we are right in assuming that the man of sober life whom the parish\r\npriest was required by the “canons of King Edgar” to bring with him to the\r\ndiocesan synods (see p. 67) was the prototype of that useful official. At\r\nleast, from a very early time every parish had its clerk to attend upon\r\nthe priest in his office, and to perform a number of useful services on\r\nbehalf of the parishioners. An Injunction of Bishop Grostete says, “In\r\nevery church which hath sufficient means there shall be a deacon and\r\nsub-deacon, but in the rest at least a fitting and honest clerk to serve\r\nthe priest in a comely habit.”[305] A Canon of a Synod of Ely (1528)\r\nenjoins all parish clerks to serve their priests at high mass reverently\r\nand devoutly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coronation procession of Charles V. of France. (From MS. of\r\nFroissart’s Chronicle.)]\r\n\r\nThe general custom was for the incumbent to choose and appoint the clerk,\r\nand for the parishioners to pay him; but in some parishes the parishioners\r\nhad a prescriptive right to choose; and there are indications that in some\r\nparishes it was the custom for the rector or vicar to pay him.[306] Having\r\nbeen duly chosen and appointed, the clerk was licensed by the Ordinary,\r\nand held his office as a freehold, being removable by the Ordinary, and by\r\nhim only for misconduct. His duties were to attend on the parish priest,\r\nand assist in the services of the church; to ring the bell for services,\r\nprepare the altar, lead the people in the responses; precede the\r\nprocession with holy water; precede the priest with bell and taper in\r\ngoing to visit the sick, and such-like things.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Parish Clerk sprinkling Holy Water. (Early 14th cent. MS.\r\nBritish Museum, Royal, 10 E. IV.)]\r\n\r\nOne curious custom of his office was to go round the parish on Sundays and\r\ngreat festivals, and to enter the houses in order to asperse the people\r\nwith holy water, sometimes, perhaps on some special festivals, it would be\r\nto cense them, for Absolon, the parish clerk in Chaucer’s “Canterbury\r\nTales” (Miller’s Tale)--\r\n\r\n  Goth with a censer on the holy day,\r\n  Censing the wives of the parish faste.\r\n\r\nA MS. in the British Museum of early fourteenth century date (Royal, 10 E.\r\nIV.) contains a story which turns on the adventures of a parish priest, as\r\nhe goes through the parish on this errand. Our illustration, taken from\r\nf. 108 _verso_, shows how, after going into the kitchen to sprinkle the\r\ncook, he then goes to the hall to sprinkle the lord and lady as they sit\r\nat dinner. In the Harl. MS., 2278, f. 76, is a picture of a parish clerk\r\nabout to asperse the dead body of a child, the mother withdrawing the\r\nwinding-sheet for the purpose.[307] It was from this duty that the parish\r\nclerk took the name of “Aquabajalus.”\r\n\r\nHis stipend was made up of customary fees, especially for his services at\r\nmarriages and burials, which differed in various parishes, and voluntary\r\ndonations. A custom of this kind is good (says Lyndwode), that every\r\nmaster of a family on every Lord’s day give the clerk bearing the holy\r\nwater, somewhat according to the exigency of his condition; and that on\r\nChristmas Day he have of every house one loaf of bread, and a certain\r\nnumber of eggs at Easter, and in the autumn certain sheaves. Also that may\r\nbe called a laudable custom where such clerk every quarter of the year\r\nreceives something in certain money for his sustenance, which ought to be\r\ncollected and levied in the whole parish.\r\n\r\nA great number of the mediæval wills contain small bequests to the parish\r\nclerk, and to clerks attending the funeral of the testator.\r\n\r\nA story told by Matthew Paris[308] makes us acquainted with the average\r\nincome thus derived. “It happened that an agent of the pope met a jolly\r\nclerk of a village carrying water in a little vessel with a sprinkler, and\r\nsome bits of bread given him for having sprinkled some holy water, and to\r\nhim the deceitful Roman thus addressed himself: ‘How much does the profit\r\nyielded to you by this church amount to in a year?’ To which the clerk,\r\nignorant of the Roman’s cunning, replied, ‘To twenty shillings, I think.’\r\nWhereupon the agent demanded the percentage the pope had just demanded on\r\nall ecclesiastical benefices. And to pay that small sum the poor man was\r\ncompelled to hold school for many days, and, by selling his books in the\r\nprecincts, to drag on a half-starved life.”\r\n\r\nBoniface, Archbishop of Canterbury, in his Constitutions of 1260, says--\r\n\r\n    We have often heard from our elders that the benefices of holy water\r\n    were originally instituted from a motive of charity, in order that one\r\n    of their proper poor clerks might have exhibitions to the schools, and\r\n    so advance in learning, that they might be fit for higher preferment.\r\n\r\nHe therefore desires that in churches which are not distant more than ten\r\nmiles from the cities and castles of the province of Canterbury, the\r\nrectors and vicars should endeavour to find such clerks, and appoint them\r\nto the office. And if the parishioners withhold the customary alms to\r\nthem, let them be urgently admonished, and, if need be, compelled to give\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWe are not surprised to find that parish clerks of this kind often kept\r\nthe village schools.\r\n\r\n    Peckham, Archbishop in 1280, ordered in the church of Bauquell and the\r\n    chapels annexed to it, that there should be _duos clericos\r\n    scholasticos_, carefully chosen by the parishioners, from whose alms\r\n    they would have to live, who should carry holy water round in the\r\n    parish and chapels on Lord’s days and festivals, and minister _in\r\n    divinis officiis_, and on week days should keep school.[309]\r\n    Alexander, Bishop of Coventry, 1237, ordered parish clerks who should\r\n    be schoolmasters in country villages.[310]\r\n\r\nThe custom of putting young scholars into the office of parish clerk to\r\nhelp them to proceed to holy orders, explains some kindly bequests which\r\nwe meet with in wills:\r\n\r\n    Robert de Weston, Rector of Marum, 1389, leaves “to John Penne, my\r\n    clerk, a missal of the new Use of Sarum, if he wishes to be a priest,\r\n    otherwise I give him 20_s._ My servant Thomas Thornawe, 20_s._ The\r\n    residue of my goods to be solde as quickly as possible, _communi\r\n    pretio_, so that the purchasers may be bound to pray for my\r\n    soul.”[311]\r\n\r\n    Giles de Gadlesmere, in 1337, left to Wm. Ockam, clerk, C_s._, unless\r\n    he be promoted before my death.[312]\r\n\r\nThe parish clerks of a town or neighbourhood sometimes formed themselves\r\ninto a gild, as in London, Lincoln, etc.,[313] and it would seem that\r\nthese gilds in some places entertained their neighbours, and no doubt\r\naugmented their own funds, by the exhibition of miracle plays. The parish\r\nclerks of London used to exhibit, on the anniversary of their gild, on the\r\ngreen in the parish of St. James, Clerkenwell. In 1391, Stow says that\r\nthey performed before the king and queen and the whole court for three\r\ndays successively, and that, in 1409, they performed a play of the\r\n“Creation of the World,” the representation of which occupied eight\r\nsuccessive days.\r\n\r\nChaucer gives a portrait of a parish clerk in the Miller’s Tale of his\r\n“Canterbury Pilgrims”--\r\n\r\n  Now was there of that churche a parish clerke\r\n  The which that was y-cleped Absolon.\r\n  Crulle[314] was his here and as the gold it shon,\r\n  And strouted[315] as a fanne large and brode;\r\n  Ful streight and even lay his jolly shode.[316]\r\n  His rode[317] was red, his eyen grey as goos,\r\n  With Poules windowes carved on his shoos,\r\n  In hosen red he went ful fetisly[318]\r\n  Yclad he was ful smal and proprely\r\n  All in a kirtle of a light wajet[319]\r\n  Ful faire and thicke ben the pointès set.\r\n  And therupon he had a gay surplise\r\n  As white as is the blossome upon the rise.[320]\r\n  A mery child he was so God me save,\r\n  Well could he leten blod and clippe and shave\r\n  And make a charte of lond and a quitance.\r\n  In twenty manner could he trip and daunce\r\n  (After the schole of Oxenfordè tho)\r\n  And playen songès on a smal ribible[321]\r\n  Therto he sang, sometime a loud quinible[321]\r\n  And as wel could he play on a giterne.[321]\r\n  In all the town n’as brewhouse ne taverne\r\n  That he ne visited with his solas,\r\n  Theras that any galliard tapstere was.\r\n  This Absolon that jolly was and gay\r\n  Goth with a censor on the holy day\r\n  Censing the wivès of the parish faste\r\n  And many a lovely loke he on hem caste.\r\n\r\n      *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Sometime to shew his lightness and maistrie\r\n  He plaieth Herod on a skaffold hie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nCUSTOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt remains to mention a great variety of observances and customs, some of\r\nthem superstitious, some innocent enough, many of them picturesque and\r\npoetical and giving colour and variety to the popular religious life. It\r\nwould need another volume as large as this to do justice to the subject\r\nwhich we find ourselves compelled to deal with in a single chapter.\r\n\r\nThe right of Sanctuary, the immunity from violence even of the criminal\r\nwho had put himself under the protection of present Deity, which was\r\nprovided for in the Levitical cities of refuge, which attached to the\r\ntemples of the gods of Greece and Rome, was, when the empire became\r\nChristian, readily accorded to churches and their precincts. We have had\r\noccasion to mention its existence in Saxon times;[322] it seems desirable\r\nto say that it continued to be an important feature in the life of the\r\ntimes of which we are now speaking. There were special\r\nsanctuaries--cities of refuge--with special privileges, as at Durham,\r\nRipon, Hexham, Beverley, Battle, Beaulieu, Westminster, St. Martin’s le\r\nGrand, the Savoy, Whitefriars, and the Mint in London, and other places.\r\nEvery church and every churchyard shared in the privilege, and it was no\r\nvery unusual incident to find it made use of.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of its efficacy, we may point to the story that after\r\nthe battle of Tewkesbury, King Edward IV., with some of his knights, was\r\nabout to enter the church, sword in hand, in pursuit of some of the\r\ndefeated Lancastrians who had taken refuge there, when the priest met them\r\nat the door bearing the consecrated host, and refused them entrance till\r\nthe king had promised pardon to several of the refugees. We frequently\r\nmeet with examples of people in danger to life or liberty taking refuge in\r\nthe nearest church.\r\n\r\nThe church was also a sanctuary for property. It was very usual to deposit\r\nmoney and valuables there for safe custody. We give some examples of it in\r\na footnote.[323] Jews were not allowed to deposit their money and\r\nvaluables in churches.\r\n\r\nThe churchyard also gave a certain protection.[324] Ordericus Vitalis\r\nrelates that the villagers in time of war sometimes removed themselves and\r\ntheir goods thither, and built themselves huts within the precincts, and\r\nwere left unmolested. From a canon of the Synod of Westminster, 1142, we\r\nlearn that ploughs and other agricultural implements placed in the\r\nchurchyard had certain immunities, probably freedom from seizure for debt.\r\nThe canon decreed that the ploughs in the fields, with the husbandmen,\r\nshould have the same immunity.[325]\r\n\r\nA similar privilege attached to the persons of bishops; Bishop St. Hugh of\r\nLincoln meeting the sheriff and his men taking a man to execution, claimed\r\nthe criminal, and carried him off. The Abbot of Battle on one occasion\r\nclaimed and exercised the same episcopal privilege.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPilgrimage was a popular act of devotion from Saxon times downwards, and\r\nafforded a relief to the stay-at-home habits of the people. The pilgrimage\r\nto the Holy Land was the most highly esteemed, after that, to the\r\nthresholds of the apostles at Rome, and to Compostella, and great numbers\r\nwent thither. The most famous native pilgrimages were to St. Thomas of\r\nCanterbury and Our Lady of Walsingham, but every cathedral had its shrine,\r\nand many monasteries and many churches their relics. It would occupy pages\r\neven to give a list of the known places of pilgrimage in every county. Let\r\nit suffice to mention the shrines of St. Cuthbert at Durham, St. William\r\nat York, and little St. William at Norwich, St. Hugh at Lincoln, St.\r\nEdward Confessor at Westminster, St. Erkenwald at London, St. Wulstan at\r\nWorcester, St. Swithun at Winchester, St. Edmund at Bury, SS. Etheldreda\r\nand Withburga at Ely, St. Thomas at Hereford, St. Frideswide at Oxford,\r\nSt. Werburgh at Chester, St. Wulfstan at Worcester, St. Wilfrid at Ripon,\r\nSt. Richard at Chichester, St. Osmund at Salisbury, St. Paulinus at\r\nRochester. There were famous roods, as that near the north door of St.\r\nPaul’s, London, and the roods of Chester and Bromholme; and statues, as\r\nthat of Our Lady of Wilsden, and of Bexley, and of other places. There\r\nwere scores of sacred wells; that of St. Winifred at Holywell, near\r\nChester, with its exquisite architectural enclosure and canopy, is still\r\nalmost perfect, and still resorted to for its supposed healing virtues.\r\n\r\nBefore a man went on any of the greater pilgrimages, he obtained a licence\r\nfrom his parish priest, and first went to church and received the Church’s\r\nblessing on his pious enterprise, and her prayers for his good success and\r\nsafe return, and was formally invested with his staff, scrip, and bottle\r\n(water-bottle). The office for blessing pilgrims may be found in the old\r\nservice books. While he was away he was mentioned every Sunday, as we have\r\nseen, in the Bidding Prayer, in his parish church. On the road, and at the\r\nend of his journey, he found hospitals founded by pious people on purpose\r\nto entertain pilgrims, and on the exhibition of his formal licence he\r\nreceived kindly hospitality. At every great place of pilgrimage “signs”\r\nwere sold to the pilgrims, the palm at Jerusalem, scallop shells at St.\r\nJames of Compostella, and the like. In many places water, in which had\r\nbeen dipped one of the relics, was sold, to be used in case of sickness,\r\nenclosed in a leaden ampul, and was worn suspended by a cord from the\r\nneck. Fragments of the pilgrim roads may still be traced in narrow deep\r\novergrown lanes on the hillsides between Guildford and Reigate, between\r\nWesterham and Seven Oaks, leading towards Canterbury, and in green lanes\r\nthrough Norfolk leading towards Walsingham. On his return the pilgrim went\r\nto church to return thanks, and hung up his signs over his bed as\r\ntreasured mementoes of his adventurous journey. Sometimes the palmer’s\r\nstaff, or the scallop shells, were, on his death, hung on the church wall,\r\nas the knight’s gauntlets, sword, and helmet were.[326]\r\n\r\nThe whole body of the people had an opportunity of a short pilgrimage on\r\nthe occasion of the annual procession of the parishes to the cathedral\r\nchurch, or if that were too far, to some other central church with\r\nspecial attractions, with banners waving and most likely music playing,\r\nthere to meet the processions from other parishes, as has been already\r\ndescribed at p. 121.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVery frequently at the great Festivals there was some picturesque addition\r\nto the services in church; as the grotto and cradle at Christmas, the\r\nsprinkling of ashes on Ash Wednesday, the veiling of the rood during Lent,\r\nthe procession bearing palms round the churchyard on Palm Sunday, the\r\ncreeping to the cross on Good Friday, the Easter sepulchre, on Whitsunday\r\nthe white dresses of the baptizands, the blessing of the fields on\r\nRogation days, the festival of the Dedication of the parish church which\r\nwas held on its saint’s day, and was a great day of social feasting. Every\r\nSunday the procession (Litany) round the church, sometimes preceded by a\r\nmiserable figure in white, bearing a taper, doing penance. At funerals\r\nthere was a great display of mournful pageantry; and month’s-minds, and\r\nobits, frequently occurring, added a feature to the service in which\r\neverybody took a personal interest; for the good people then, when the\r\nbanns of a marriage were published, kindly responded with a “God speed\r\nthem well”; and when the names of the departed were proclaimed, prayed\r\n“God rest their souls.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages, all the services of the church, attended by the\r\npeople, were celebrated by daylight, except, perhaps, the first evensong\r\non the eves of saint days, and very early celebrations, and then the\r\nattendants probably brought a taper or a coil of wax-light for themselves,\r\nso that there was no need of provision for the lighting up of the whole\r\ninterior of churches, such as is customary in these days; but lights in\r\nchurches were a conspicuous part of their furniture, and the provision of\r\nthem was a source of general interest to the people.\r\n\r\nFirst there were the altar lights. A law of Edmund directs that the priest\r\nshall not celebrate without a light; not for use, but as a symbol. At low\r\nmass one candle on the gospel side of the altar was sufficient, _e.g._ one\r\nwas habitually used in Lincoln Cathedral at low mass. In poor churches,\r\nsometimes only one was used. Myrc, in his “Instructions to Parish\r\nPriests,” says--\r\n\r\n  Look that thy candle of wax it be,\r\n  And set it so that thou it see,\r\n  On the left half of thine altere,\r\n  And look always that it burn clere.\r\n\r\nIn pictures of the celebration of the Eucharist in illuminated MSS., we\r\nsometimes find only one candle on the altar, _e.g._ in Nero E. II.\r\n(fourteenth cent.) _passim_. More usually in later times two wax candles\r\nwere placed on the altar, which were understood to symbolize the presence\r\nin the sacrament of Christ the Light of the World, and their number to\r\nallude to the two natures in our Lord.\r\n\r\nIt was required that an oil-lamp should hang before the high altar, always\r\nalight, in honour of the reserved sacrament in its Pyx. It was an ancient\r\ncustom to have a great ornamented wax-light at Easter, called the Paschal\r\nCandle, in honour of the Resurrection of our Lord. Lights were placed on\r\nthe rood-loft, and tapers were burned in front of the images of the\r\nsaints, here and there in the church and its chapels. “The lighting of\r\ncandles is not to dispel darkness, but to show that the saints are\r\nlightened by the light of heaven from God, as when they were alive, and\r\nthe light of Faith, Grace, and Doctrine shone in them in this life.” “The\r\nChurch Light before the rood, the relics, or images of saints burneth to\r\nthe honour of God.”[327]\r\n\r\nThe number of these lights before saints was sometimes considerable. For\r\nexample, the churchwardens’ accounts of All Saints’, Derby, for 1466-67,\r\ngive entries with respect to the lights in that church, which tell us the\r\nnumber of images of saints, the number of tapers before each image, and\r\nthe way in which they were provided:--\r\n\r\n    St. Catherine’s lights contained 20 serges, maintained by the\r\n    collection of the Candle lighter.\r\n\r\n    St. Nicholas’ light contained 12 serges, maintained by the gathering\r\n    of the Parish Clerk on St. Nicholas’ night.\r\n\r\n    Four other serges were burnt before St. Nicholas, which were provided\r\n    by the Schoolmaster’s gathering from his scholars, St. Nicholas being\r\n    the patron saint of School boys.\r\n\r\n    St. Eloy’s (Elgius) light had 6 serges, maintained by the Gild of the\r\n    Farriers.\r\n\r\n    St. Clement’s light had 5 serges, maintained by the Gild of Bakers.\r\n\r\n    Our Lady’s light contained 5 serges, maintained by the Shoemakers.\r\n\r\n    Before the Rood 5 serges were maintained by 5 several benefactors.\r\n\r\n    Before the Mary of Pity 5 serges were maintained by the wife of Ralph\r\n    Mayre.\r\n\r\n    In the Lady Chapel before our Lady 3 serges, maintained by 3 several\r\n    benefactors.\r\n\r\n    In the same chapel before the Image of St. John Baptist several serges\r\n    maintained by one benefactor.\r\n\r\n    Before St. Christopher 5 serges by 5 individuals.\r\n\r\n    3 serges which Anc{r} Geyr found, one before our Lady, another before\r\n    St. Catherine, and the third before the Trinity Altar.\r\n\r\n    Before St. Edmund 2 serges by the gathering of the Clerk on St.\r\n    Edmund’s night, gathering as they do on St. Nicholas’ night.[328]\r\n\r\nDr. Cox says that these lights were probably all lighted at high mass; but\r\nthose of saints only on their saint days, and that only the altar-lamp was\r\nleft alight all night.\r\n\r\nAt the Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a temporary\r\nwooden chandelier, called a trindle, bearing many lights, was set up in\r\nchurch, and the attendants at the service brought tapers with them; the\r\ngeneral illumination gave to the festival the name of Candle-Mass.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of these lights is shown in many ways--gilds maintained\r\nthem, the public generally subscribed to them, and testators frequently\r\nleft money to them.\r\n\r\nA taper seems sometimes to have been symbolical of a person, as when the\r\npeople who followed a procession carried them and presented them at the\r\naltar; when a nun to be professed and an anchoress to be enclosed, thus\r\ncarried and offered them; when a penitent carried them; and, when in\r\nexcommunication, “by bell, book, and candle,” the candle was extinguished.\r\nPerhaps, in giving to the lights before the rood and the images of saints,\r\nthere was some notion in the donors’ minds that they were keeping\r\nthemselves in the recollection of Christ and the saints.\r\n\r\nBesides these ritual lights, it was customary at a funeral to set up a\r\nwooden herse in church around the coffin, and to place two or more large\r\nwax candles, often called torches, about the herse. People often made\r\nprovision in their wills for such lights, not only on the day of the\r\nfuneral, but on the week-day, month’s-mind, and yearly obit, and sometimes\r\nat a perpetual obit. Perhaps what was intended to be symbolized was that,\r\nthough their bodies were buried in darkness, their souls were in the land\r\nof light.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe dramatic representation of Scripture subjects--the Three Kings at\r\nChristmas, the Passion of our Lord in Lent, and others at other times--was\r\ncommon in the cathedrals, monasteries, large towns, and perhaps villages.\r\nBishop Poor, in his “Ancren Riewle,” suggests that female recluses, who\r\nsometimes lived in a cell beside the church, may have to mention among\r\nother subjects of confession, “I went to the play in the churchyard; I\r\nlooked on at the wrestling, or other foolish sports.” The Passion play at\r\nOber Ammergau has proved that such performances may be made dignified and\r\ndevotional.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe custom of using the churchyard for purposes of business and pleasure\r\nwas very common and very persistent. As early as the fourth century St.\r\nBasil protested against the holding of markets in the precincts of\r\nchurches, under pretext of making better provision for the festivals; but\r\nthe custom held its own, and we have a catena of synodical declarations\r\nagainst holding secular pleas, markets and fairs, and indulging in sports,\r\nin church and churchyard, and a series of complaints by the synodsmen in\r\ntheir annual presentation to their bishops of the breach of the canons.\r\n\r\nCardinal Ottobon, at the Synod of London, 1268, made a constitution\r\nprohibiting this kind of use of the sacred building and its enclosure; and\r\nstrictly enjoining all bishops and other prelates to cause it to be\r\ninviolably observed on pain of ecclesiastical censure; and here are a few\r\nexamples of the way in which it was disregarded down to so late a period\r\nas the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries:\r\n\r\nThe parishioners of St. Michael le Belfry, York, in 1416, complain that a\r\ncommon market is held in their churchyard on Sundays and holidays.[329] In\r\nthe explanation of the Second Commandment, c. xvi., in “Dives and\r\nPauper,” in allusion to the abuse, which adds a little to our information,\r\n“no markette sholde be holden by vytaylers or other chapmen on Sondaye in\r\nthe churche or in the churchyarde or at the church gate ne in sentuary\r\n(churchyard) ne out.” In another place (Sixth Commandment, c. i.) we learn\r\nthat the chapmen and their families sometimes slept in the church or\r\nchurchyard.\r\n\r\nOne of the canons of the Synod of Exeter, 1287, strictly enjoins on parish\r\npriests that they publicly proclaim in their churches that no one presume\r\nto carry on combats, dances, or other improper sports in the churchyards,\r\nespecially on the even and feasts of saints, or stage plays or farces\r\n(_ludos theatrales et ludebriorum spectacula_).[330] Yet in 1472, at\r\nSallay, in Yorkshire, it is found necessary to make an order that no one\r\nuse improper and prohibited sports within the churchyard, as, for example,\r\n_pilopedali vel manuale_, tutts and handball, or wrestling.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA custom which is still more opposed to our sense of propriety was that of\r\nholding church ales in the sacred building. A church ale was the old form\r\nof parish tea. It was connected with works of piety or charity, or of\r\nChristian fellowship, and in the eyes of the people of those times perhaps\r\npartook of the nature of the primitive love-feasts. They made a collection\r\nfor the poor of the parish at a Whitsun Ale, started a young couple with a\r\nlittle sum by a Bride Ale, or got a man out of difficulties by a Bid Ale\r\n(from _biddan_, to pray or beg). So persistent was the custom, that in our\r\nlatest English canons of 1603 it is thought necessary to prohibit any\r\nholding of feasts, banquets, suppers, or church ale drinkings in\r\nchurch.[331]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nABUSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven a book like this, which professes to deal with the humbler details of\r\nparochial life, rather than with the greater matters of ecclesiastical\r\nhistory, would be defective if it failed to take some note of the\r\nadministrative abuses against which all Europe complained for centuries,\r\nand tried in vain to get them amended in the three great Councils at Pisa,\r\nConstance, and Basle. We shall treat of them very briefly, and chiefly in\r\ntheir relation to our special subject.\r\n\r\nIt was soon found that the new relations of the Church of England to the\r\npatriarchal authority of the See of Rome, which had been a consequence of\r\nthe Norman Conquest, had opened the door to a flood of evils which had not\r\nbeen foreseen. We can only enumerate them without going into their\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe claim of the popes to present to all ecclesiastical benefices was\r\nopposed by the king with respect to the rights of the Crown to the\r\nnomination to bishoprics and abbacies, and on the part of the nobles and\r\ngentry with respect to their patronage; but by partial encroachments the\r\npopes did in fact, from time to time, nominate to many bishoprics, and\r\ndignities, and to a considerable number of parochial benefices. Curiously\r\nenough, the most important of these invasions of the rights of others are\r\nthe most capable of extenuation. The kings, as we shall presently have\r\noccasion to say, at length used their power of practical nomination to\r\nbishoprics, not to give the Church the best Churchmen as bishops, but to\r\npay for the services of their ministers of State with the rank and\r\nrevenues of bishoprics. Their nomination at all was an infringement of the\r\nconstitutional liberties of the Church, and their use of their power of\r\npractical nomination in this way was a grievous wrong. In the reigns of\r\nJohn and Henry III., when the popes took upon themselves to nominate to\r\nsees, they were careful to select Churchmen of learning and character, who\r\ncontrasted favourably in the eyes of the nation with the king’s nominees\r\nthus superseded. In the reign of Edward I., the king and the pope played\r\ninto one another’s hands, the king did not oppose the Papal nomination,\r\nbut the pope readily nominated men whom the king recommended. Later kings\r\nsuccessfully maintained their right of nomination against the popes, but\r\nthe pious and feeble Henry VI. again yielded to papal encroachments.\r\n\r\nThe _intrusion_ by the pope _of foreigners_, chiefly Italians, into\r\nEnglish benefices was a great practical grievance while it lasted, _i.e._\r\nduring part of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Bishop Grostete\r\nestimated that the revenues of the alien clerks, whom Innocent IV. had\r\nplanted in England, equalled seventy thousand marks, while the king’s\r\nrevenue was not more than a third of that sum. This abuse was so unpopular\r\nthat it provoked a serious resistance. About 1230, a secret association,\r\ncountenanced, it was said, by men of position, wrote to bishops and\r\nchapters, warning them not to encourage these encroachments, and to the\r\nmonks, who farmed the benefices of the aliens, not to pay them their rent.\r\nThe tithe barns of the alien rectors were plundered, and the contents sold\r\nor given to the poor, and some of the men themselves were seized and put\r\nto ransom. In the reign of Richard II. (1379), an Act of Parliament\r\nforbade any to farm the benefice of an alien, or to send money out of the\r\nrealm for such farm, under the penalties of the Statute of Provisors. But\r\nthe evil was checked by the Acts of Provisors (1350) and Premunire (1353),\r\nand these encroachments of the Roman See were extinguished by the end of\r\nthe fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA great grievance inflicted by the Crown upon the Church was _the use of\r\nChurch patronage_ for the payment of the political, diplomatic, judicial,\r\nand other officers of the civil administration. The result was that a\r\nlarge number of the greatest offices of the Church were served by deputy;\r\nthe details of diocesan work were done by suffragans, archdeacons\r\nperformed their duties by officials, rectors by parish chaplains. It was\r\ninevitable that the work should be imperfectly done; rank and wealth are\r\nattached to Church benefices in order to enhance the dignity and influence\r\nof the holders and their power of fulfilling the duties of their office,\r\nand a _locum tenens_, though he were intrinsically as able a man, can\r\nnever fulfil the place or do the work of the real holder of the office.\r\n\r\nIt was Henry II. who adopted it as a normal practice, and not without\r\nprotest. When this king asked Bishop St. Hugh of Lincoln for a prebend for\r\none of his courtiers, the bishop replied: “Ecclesiastical benefices are\r\nnot for courtiers, but for ecclesiastics. Those who hold them must serve\r\nnot the palace or the treasury, but the altar. The king has wherewithal to\r\ncompensate those who work for him and fight his battles. Let him allow\r\nthose who serve the King of kings to enjoy their fitting remuneration, and\r\nnot to be deprived of it.” When King Richard, through the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, desired Bishop Hugh to send him a list of twelve of his canons\r\nto be employed in his affairs, Hugh replied that “he had often prohibited\r\nhis clerks from intermeddling in secular affairs, and he certainly was not\r\ngoing to encourage such a thing now. It was quite enough to have\r\narchbishops forgetting their sacred calling.” All the canons had not the\r\ncourage of their bishop, or were ambitious of court appointments, for some\r\nof them went off to the king at Fontevrault without the bishop’s leave;\r\nbut all were relieved from their difficulty by the king’s death.[332]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA kindred evil was that of _pluralities_, since the holder of several\r\nbenefices must needs put a _locum tenens_ into all of them save one, with\r\nthe disadvantages just mentioned. John Mansel, Henry III.’s chancellor, is\r\nsaid by Matthew Paris to have held the revenues of seven hundred\r\nbenefices, amounting to four thousand marks.\r\n\r\nThe popes in the thirteenth century exerted their authority to put an end\r\nto the abuse, but met with a strenuous resistance. At the Council of\r\nLondon, 1237, under Otho, when the Canon against pluralists of the recent\r\nLateran Council was proposed to be adopted, Walter de Cantilupe, Bishop of\r\nWorcester, warned the Legate that the attempt to impose it on the English\r\nclergy would be resisted by force by the young men who were bold and\r\ndaring, and not without the approbation of some of their elders;[333] and\r\nthe question was postponed. But the popes exercised pressure by refusing\r\nto confirm the elections to bishoprics of men who were pluralists, and the\r\nArchbishops[334] gave their authority to the cause of reform. In time the\r\nevil was lessened; there were fewer benefices held in plurality, and those\r\nwho held them were required to obtain a dispensation, and to provide in\r\nthe benefices on which they did not reside proper substitutes with a\r\nsufficient provision for themselves, and for the hospitalities and\r\ncharities of the benefices.\r\n\r\nWe have had occasion to make several allusions to the _farming of\r\nbenefices_; this was another abuse which may require a few words of\r\nexplanation. The incumbent for a definite annual payment put the\r\nemoluments of his benefice into the hands of another to make what he could\r\nout of it. The monks at one time were great farmers of benefices. The evil\r\nof it was that the farmer, having no responsibility towards or interest in\r\nthe people, was tempted to be strict in exacting his dues, and deaf to\r\nclaims of charity. For example, in 1532 the Convent of Merton granted a\r\nlease of the rectory of Kingston-on-Thames with all the profits and the\r\npresentation to the vicarage for twenty-one years.[335]\r\n\r\nA danger connected with this farming of benefices for a long term of\r\nyears, which is not apparent at first sight, is indicated in the following\r\ninstance. In 1267, Bishop Richard of Gravesend made Dunstable Priory give\r\nup the Church of Lidlington; they had farmed it from an absentee rector,\r\nand on his death they seem to have assumed the rectorial rights.[336]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAmong the greatest and most widespread abuses, was that of admitting to\r\nbenefices men who were not qualified to fulfil the duties of the office.\r\nThis was the case more or less with ecclesiastical benefices from\r\nbishoprics downwards; but it was specially the case with rectories.\r\n\r\nThis abuse, of course, arose from the fact that in the majority of cases\r\nthe patronage of the rectory was in the hands of the lord of the manor,\r\nthe descendant, or at least the representative, of the original donor of\r\nthe benefice, and was usually regarded as a natural provision for one of\r\nthe younger sons of the family. It was, perhaps, not in theory so bad an\r\narrangement as some people think it. In those feudal times the lord of the\r\nmanor was the petty king of all the people, and if one of his sons had the\r\npersonal qualifications, perhaps no other priest could fulfil the duties\r\nof rector of the parish with equal advantages. The relations of squire and\r\nparson in a country village are a little difficult, and a son of the\r\nruling family could exercise an influence in the parish which a stranger\r\ncould not; he could mediate between the lord and the people with greater\r\ninfluence on both sides than a stranger; and the people would generally\r\npay a loyal regard to him which they would not to any other priest.\r\n\r\nThe great abuse was that so many of these rectors remained in minor\r\norders, exercising perhaps a good influence, fulfilling the hospitalities\r\nand charities of their office, but leaving its spiritual duties to be\r\nperformed by a parish chaplain. This did not seem so objectionable to them\r\nas it does to us, because they were under the influence of the feudal\r\nideas, which tended to make all offices hereditary, and to consider that\r\nthe holders of office did all that was required of them if they provided\r\nthat the duties of the office were satisfactorily performed by\r\nsubordinates.\r\n\r\nThe law made a man who had received the lowest of the minor orders capable\r\nof holding a benefice;[337] the bishops, therefore, could not refuse the\r\npatron’s nomination in such cases, and the bishops’ registers contain\r\nrecords of the institution of young men, who were sometimes only acolytes,\r\nor even clerks; they had to do the best they could for the well-being of\r\nboth the young rectors and their parishes, with some consideration for the\r\nrights of patrons and the opinion of the age. In very many cases the newly\r\ninstituted rector received at once a licence of non-residence for a year,\r\nthat he might study, generally, or in Oxford or Paris specifically. The\r\nleave of non-residence is sometimes extended to two or three years, or\r\nrenewed from time to time. Sometimes it is stipulated that the rector\r\nshall take orders as sub-deacon within the year, or that he shall pass\r\nthrough all the orders up to priest’s within the time of non-residence\r\nallowed. There is frequently further licence given to put the benefice to\r\nfarm, with a stipulation for a donation to the poor of the parish, or the\r\nfabric of the church, or the like.[338]\r\n\r\nWilliam, the son of Gilbert FitzStephen, presented to the parish of\r\nKentisbury, was refused by Bishop Stapledon on the ground that he was too\r\nilliterate for such a charge. The influence of powerful friends was\r\nbrought to bear upon the bishop, and he conceded thus far--that the young\r\nman should go to school (_scolas grammaticales_), and if, after awhile, he\r\ncould admit him with a good conscience, he would do so, and would not, in\r\nthe mean time, take advantage of the law which made the nomination lapse\r\nto himself at the end of six months. But it does not appear in the\r\nRegister that William FitzStephen was ever instituted; and the institution\r\nof John de Wyke, priest, in the following year, by the patron, indicates\r\nthat the illiterate young man abandoned the idea of becoming Rector of\r\nKentisbury, and perhaps did service, such as he was qualified to perform\r\nsatisfactorily, under his father’s banner in the field. Sometimes the\r\nbishop dealt with a case more peremptorily. Bishop Grostete refused a\r\npresentee whom he described as “a boy still in his Ovid.” The same bishop\r\nrefused to admit to a benefice a man presented by the Chancellor of York,\r\non the ground that he was almost illiterate; and sends the young man’s\r\nexamination papers that the chancellor may judge for himself. He refused\r\nto institute W. de Grana on the presentation of W. Raleigh, the treasurer\r\nof Exeter, because of his youth and ignorance; but that Raleigh may not\r\nthink him ungrateful, he promises to give his nominee a pension of ten\r\nmarks a year till he gets a better benefice. In answer to a request of the\r\nLegate Otho to institute Thomas, a son of Earl Ferrers, to a benefice, he\r\nbegs to be excused; but if the matter is pressed, he begs that a vicar may\r\nbe appointed to the parish, and that Thomas may have some provision out of\r\nthe living without cure of souls.[339] In 1530, Bishop Holbeach of Lincoln\r\nrejected a Canon of Ronton nominated to the Vicarage of Seighford as\r\n_indoctus et indignus_. Richard Swinfield, Bishop of Hereford (1283-1316),\r\nrefused to institute a boy of sixteen, of the name of Baskerville, to the\r\nVicarage of Weobley, on the presentation of the Prior and Canons of\r\nLlanthony, though pressed by a powerful relative of the boy.\r\n\r\n    In 1283, in the time of Bishop Quivil of Exeter, Barthol le Seneschal,\r\n    who had been presented to the Rectory of St. Erme, was found to be not\r\n    in Holy Orders, and not old enough to be ordained; but both\r\n    difficulties were evaded, for, though not at once instituted as\r\n    rector, “the sequestration and custody of the church were committed to\r\n    him,” and so he was enabled to act as rector in the management of\r\n    affairs, and to receive the income, and to appoint a vicar or chaplain\r\n    to do the spiritual work of the parish.[340]\r\n\r\n    Robert de Umfrenville, clerk, was instituted in 1317 by Bishop\r\n    Stapledon of Exeter, on the presentation of Henry de Umfrenville--very\r\n    likely his father--to the rectory of Lapford; but the bishop required,\r\n    under a penalty of a hundred shillings, that he should go to Grammar\r\n    School, and should come to the bishop at least once a-year, that the\r\n    bishop might know what progress he was making. The young man would\r\n    seem not to have given himself to study, and, at the end of three\r\n    years, to have found the position untenable, for he sent in his\r\n    resignation by letter, dated June, 1320.\r\n\r\n    In 1317, a rector of Bath and Wells diocese, on his institution, was\r\n    bidden to keep a good chaplain to teach him, since he was but\r\n    indifferently learned. As he was the presentee of the king, the bishop\r\n    had special inducement to be lenient.[341]\r\n\r\nBut the refusals of the bishops to admit men in minor orders were very\r\nexceptional. A large proportion of the rectories were occupied by such\r\nmen. The canons of the diocesan synods show that the ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities were continually urging them to proceed to priest’s orders;\r\nbut the bishops had no power to compel them to do so;[342] and the\r\nparochial lists of incumbents bear witness that some of the rectories were\r\noccupied by men in minor orders in almost unbroken succession.\r\n\r\nAnother kindred evil was that of simple _absenteeism_, not because the\r\nrector was engaged in other occupations elsewhere, or that he was a\r\npluralist, and could not be everywhere, but simply because he preferred to\r\nbe somewhere else than in his parish. He put his benefice to farm,\r\nappointed a parish chaplain, and departed. He needed a licence of\r\nnon-residence, if absent for any lengthy period. We have glimpses of the\r\nreasons for which licences of non-residence were sometimes given. The\r\ncommonest is for leisure to attend schools, which we shall have to speak\r\nof at length presently. Another reason is that the licensee may go on\r\npilgrimage; for example, in 1225, Archbishop Gray gives a licence to\r\nGodfred, vicar of St. Felix, who has taken the cross, to put his benefice\r\nto farm for three years during his visit to the Holy Land. Bishop\r\nGrandisson of Exeter gives a licence of non-residence to Sir Ralph\r\nKerneyke, Rector of St. Erme, till 2 February 1331-2, to visit the\r\nthresholds of St. James in Galicia and the Court of Rome, and then without\r\nany delay to return to his church. In 1329, Ady de Tavistock, Rector of\r\nSt. Gerundus, Cornwall, had a licence to make a pilgrimage to Rome;[343]\r\nand similar cases occur in other bishops’ registers. Frequently the\r\nabsence is said to be granted at the request of so-and-so,[344] very\r\nlikely the patron of the parish, who thus confirms the reasons which the\r\nincumbent has alleged, and signifies his consent to his parson’s absence.\r\nThe patron had sometimes a personal reason for his action in the\r\nmatter.[345] For example, Gerard Myghell (or Mychell), Rector of Theydon\r\nGarnon, Essex, in 1507 put his rectory to farm for three years to Sir\r\nWilliam Hyll, chaplain, and Francis Hamden, esquire, in order to become\r\ntutor to John Hamden during his travels on the Continent of Europe. It\r\nappears that Francis Hamden was the squire of the parish, and John was his\r\nson, and probably Sir William Hyll, chaplain, was the priest who was to\r\ntake charge of the parish during the rector’s absence, which seems a very\r\ngood choice of trustees. The rector lets to farm, all his church and\r\nparsonage with all manor of tithes, fruits, profits, rights, commodities,\r\nand emoluments, whatsoever, with all the lands, pastures, leases, for £8 a\r\nyear; but he reserves all the whole “lochynge” [lodging] at the gate (of\r\nthe churchyard), viz. a parlour with a chimney and a larder at the end of\r\nthe said parlour, and two chambers over a study, and a wyddraughte [?\r\ndrain], perhaps to lodge his old housekeeper in during his absence. There\r\nis still an ancient house in the churchyard which may possibly be the\r\nlodging here mentioned. There is a letter from the rector, from Rouen,\r\nrelating how he and his pupil are getting on, and very naturally asking\r\nfor supplies of money and clothing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe had occasion to deal with the subject of _slavery_ in the Saxon period,\r\nconcluding with the estimate of Sharon Turner,[346] that, of the\r\npopulation of England at the end of that time, as calculated from Domesday\r\nBook, three-quarters of the population of two millions were in a state of\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nWe may introduce here the statement that, although the Church all along\r\nthe ages used its influence in favour of the just treatment of the serf\r\npopulation, in the spirit of St. Paul; and encouraged manumission, and set\r\nthe example; and freely gave dispensations to sons of serfs to enter into\r\nHoly Orders and hold church benefices; yet the status of serfage was\r\nsuffered to continue among the tenants of the Church after it had almost\r\ndisappeared elsewhere.[347]\r\n\r\nWe add a few notes on the subject in mediæval times. Here is one which\r\ntells us the value of a serf. Gregory, Abbot of Whalley, in 1309, sells\r\nhis _nativus, cum tota sequela sua, et omnibus rebus suis habitis et\r\nhabendis_, for 100_s._ sterling.[348]\r\n\r\nIn the Register of Walter Stapledon, Bishop of Exeter, is an entry under\r\ndate 1315--\r\n\r\n    Be it known to all present and future, that we, Walter, etc., have\r\n    given and granted “Magistro de la Gale, clerico, Richardum de la Gale,\r\n    filium Edwardi de la Gale, nativum nostrum, cum tota sequela sua et\r\n    omnibus catallis suis,” so that neither we nor our successors may be\r\n    able to make any claim for service from the said Richard.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be the case of granting to a clerk the freedom of a relative\r\nwho was a _nativus_ (serf).\r\n\r\nSo late as 1536, the Registers of Chichester supply an example of\r\nmanumission by Bishop Sherburne. The deed of manumission begins, as is\r\nusual in deeds of manumission of that time, with a quotation from the\r\nInstitutes of Justinian, “Whereas at the beginning nature brought forth\r\nall men free, and afterwards the law of nations placed certain of them\r\nunder the yoke of servitude; we believe that it is pious and meritorious\r\ntowards God to manumit them, and restore them to the benefit of pristine\r\nliberty;” therefore the bishop emancipates Nicholas Holden, a “native and\r\nserf,” who for many years had served him on his manor of Woodmancote and\r\nelsewhere, from every chain, servitude, and servile condition by which he\r\nwas bound to the bishop and his cathedral, and, so far as he can, to make\r\nhim a free man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to give a complete view of the position and work of the parochial\r\nclergy in town and country, it is necessary to indicate, however briefly,\r\nboth their connection with the cathedral and their relations with the\r\nmonasteries. In this chapter we attempt the former subject; the latter in\r\na following chapter.\r\n\r\nWe must glance back at our history and recall the time when the cathedral\r\nwas the mother church of the diocese, and the bishop and his clergy lived\r\ntogether as one family. Some of them remained always at head-quarters to\r\nkeep up the Divine service with as full a choir as their circumstances\r\npermitted, and to carry on the schools, which formed so important a branch\r\nof their work of Christian civilization; while others were itinerating\r\nhither and thither through the diocese preaching the gospel to the people.\r\nThen, we remember, came the gradual organization of the parochial system,\r\nby which the great majority of the clergy were scattered over the\r\ndiocese, each residing permanently in his own rectory-house, and\r\nministering constantly to his own people.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONFESSION IN LENT. LATE XV. CENT. MS., 25698, f. 9.]\r\n\r\nThe bishop, however, still retained a strong staff about him at the\r\ncathedral, for the honour of the Divine service and for general diocesan\r\nwork; and the old tradition of an ascetic common life would naturally be\r\nmaintained there, when it was no longer practicable in the scattered\r\nrectories. This staff would need organization. One man would be put in\r\ngeneral command during the absences of the bishop on his visitations of\r\nthe diocese; another would be in permanent charge of the schools; another\r\nwould have special charge of the services; another would be the treasurer\r\nof the bishop’s common fund; and thus naturally arose the four dignities\r\nof all the old cathedrals--the dean, the chancellor, the precentor, and\r\nthe treasurer. Chrodegang, Bishop of Metz, the great chancellor of Charles\r\nMartel, organized the clergy of his cathedral into a community, adapting\r\nthe rule of St. Benedict (which was then being pressed upon all the\r\nmonasteries) to the circumstances of a body of secular clergy. After the\r\nNorman Conquest some of our bishops attempted to introduce the same\r\norganization into England, at Exeter, and Wells, and, with some\r\nmodifications, at York; but the innovation did not flourish here.\r\n\r\nThe development of a more settled constitution of our English cathedral\r\nbodies of secular canons took the course of giving the cathedral clergy a\r\nmore independent corporate life. The first great step towards it was the\r\ndivision of the common property into two portions, one at the disposal of\r\nthe bishop, the other the endowment of the chapter. The property allotted\r\nto the canons was then subdivided, estates being attached to the four\r\ngreat dignities; and, lastly, distinct endowments, called prebends, were\r\nassigned to the individual members of the general corporate body; still\r\nretaining a common dean and chapter fund divisible annually among the\r\ncanons, or some of them. The concession to the chapter of the privilege of\r\nelecting its own dean, completed the work, and made the dean and chapter\r\nan independent ecclesiastical corporation. The chapter thus definitely\r\nconstituted soon acquired new rights and privileges. Already in the eighth\r\ncentury they had obtained the right of being the bishop’s council; then\r\nthey gained the right, to the exclusion of the rest of the clergy, of\r\nelecting the bishop; then, that of representing the bishop’s authority\r\nduring a vacancy. Lastly, the dean, originally intended to represent the\r\nbishop during his absence, asserted his independence of the bishop as\r\nruler of the chapter; and it cost Grostete, Bishop of Lincoln, a long and\r\nbitter contest to establish his right to “visit” the chapter of his\r\ncathedral, a contest in which he said that he was contending for the\r\ndropped rights of all the bishops of England.\r\n\r\nWe have been speaking of the cathedrals which were served by bodies of\r\nsecular clergy. But some of the cathedral bodies had adopted the\r\nBenedictine rule, and were monasteries in which the bishop occupied in\r\nsome respects, the place of abbot, but the prior was the actual ruler.\r\nThese were Canterbury, Durham, Norwich, Rochester, Winchester, and\r\nWorcester, and the two post-Norman sees, one placed in the great\r\nBenedictine House of Ely, the other in the House of Austin Canons at\r\nCarlisle.\r\n\r\nThe bishops soon found it desirable to secure the services of one or more\r\narchdeacons to help them in maintaining an oversight of their scattered\r\nclergy; soon after the Conquest, the archdeacons had their courts of\r\njurisdiction, in which most of the minor cases of ecclesiastical\r\ndiscipline were dealt with.\r\n\r\nThe practical oversight of the parochial clergy was maintained partly by\r\nsynods, partly by visitations. The bishop held an annual synod, to which\r\nall the clergy of the diocese were bound to come in person or by proxy.\r\nThe bishop also went the round of his diocese at intervals, usually of\r\nthree years. He could not visit every parish, but the clergy met him at\r\nseveral convenient centres, with some of their chief parishioners, and the\r\nsynodsmen gave in written replies to a set of questions--with which we\r\nhave already dealt--which constituted a very searching--not to say\r\ninquisitorial--scrutiny into the life and conduct not only of the clergy,\r\nbut of the laity also.\r\n\r\n    A Constitution of Archbishop Boniface, 1260, directed every bishop to\r\n    have in his diocese one or two prisons for confining clerics\r\n    flagitious in crime, or convicted by canonical censure, and “we decree\r\n    that any cleric who shall be incorrigible in his wickedness and\r\n    habituated to committing crime to such a degree that if he were a\r\n    layman he would, according to the secular law, suffer the extreme\r\n    penalty, such cleric shall be adjudged to perpetual imprisonment.”\r\n\r\nThe archdeacons held their visitations, making inquiry specially into the\r\nstate of the fabrics and furniture of the churches and parsonage houses;\r\nthe rural deans also played a minor part in extending this oversight into\r\nevery corner of the land.\r\n\r\nAfter this general introduction, it will best serve our purpose of giving\r\na popular idea of the part which a cathedral took in the religious life of\r\nthe clergy and people, to select an individual example, and treat it a\r\nlittle more in detail.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Remigius, anticipating the policy of the Council of London,\r\ntransferred his see from Sidnacester (Stowe) to Lincoln, he found the\r\nking’s new castle already occupying the south-west quarter of the area\r\nwithin the Roman walls of the old Colonia; and purchased the south-east\r\nquarter for the site of his new cathedral; a wide open space only\r\nseparated the castle-gate from the humbler gate of the cathedral close.\r\nThe old inhabitants, reinforced by the new military and ecclesiastical\r\npopulations, found the northern half of the city too strait for them, and\r\na new walled town sprang up at the foot of the hill, and soon stretched\r\nout a long, narrow suburb southward, along the high-road, defended by\r\nparallel dykes. The situation was a fine one. The long tableland to the\r\nnorth here falls steeply to the level of the river Witham, and overlooks\r\nanother long level stretching southward. From the north, the castle keep\r\nand the minster towers (when they were built) could be seen from every\r\nyard of the twelve miles of perfectly straight Roman road which ran\r\nnorthwards towards the Humber. Seen from the south, the view of the city\r\nwas a glorious one. The new buildings of the castle and minster extended\r\nin a long line on the brow of the hill; an irregular line of steep street\r\nconnected the old city with the new town at its feet; the river, enlarged\r\nand made navigable by the Romans, protected the approach from the south,\r\nand wound through low ground past the monastery of Bardney, and, in later\r\ndays, the castle and collegiate church of Tatteshall, to the port of\r\nBoston at its embouchere. Durham only of English cathedrals occupies so\r\nadvantageous a site, and, together with its palatine castle, presents as\r\nnoble an architectural effect. The church grew century after century,\r\nafter the manner of cathedrals. A portion of the west front of Remigius\r\nstill remains surrounded by the later work of Alexander; St. Hugh of\r\nAvalon added the magnificent choir; Grostete added the central tower and\r\nthe parts adjacent; and so at last the Church attained the magnificent\r\nproportions which still excite our admiration. The bishop’s palace was\r\nbuilt on a levelled space of the hillside south of the cathedral; the\r\nruins of the “early English” halls and towers founded by St. Hugh,\r\nfinished by Hugh of Wells, and the chapel added by Alnwick, still remain;\r\nand the pleasant hanging gardens above and below the buildings. The\r\ncathedral close was inclosed[349] by a wall, and its entrances at the\r\nnorth-east, south-east, and west were defended by gates; the “exchequer\r\ngate” at the west had a gate-house with a large chamber in the upper\r\nstory. The principal residentiary buildings of a monastery were grouped in\r\na customary order round the cloister court; but the houses of the\r\ndignitaries of a cathedral were arranged as convenience suggested. The\r\ndeanery[350] stands north, and the sub-deanery south of the church; on\r\nthe east side of the close still remain two old stone houses with\r\npicturesque oriels, which were--and are--the official residences of the\r\nchancellor and the precentor; the chancery has a private chapel in it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lincoln, from the Fens.]\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth century it became the custom, for their greater\r\nconvenience and better discipline, to incorporate the[351] vicars choral,\r\nand to place them in a court of their own. The vicar’s court remains at\r\nWells, Hereford, Chichester, and York. That at Wells, for fourteen\r\npriests, is a long inclosure with a row of seven small stone houses on\r\neach side, a chapel, with a library over it at the further end, and a hall\r\nover the entrance gate, from which there is a picturesque covered way over\r\nthe public road into the north transept of the church, by which the vicars\r\ncould go in comfort to their daily duties--like the pope’s covered way\r\nfrom the Vatican to the Castle of St. Angelo. There are only some remains\r\nof the vicar’s court at Lincoln, on the east side of the palace grounds,\r\nthe old Roman wall dividing them. Every cathedral had a number of\r\nchantries, one of the very earliest was that to Bishop Hugh of Wells, in\r\nthis cathedral. The Burghersh chantry, founded by Bartholomew Burghersh,\r\nhad five priests, who, with the six choristers and their schoolmaster,\r\nformed a corporate body, and all lived together in the chantry-house,\r\nwhich still remains in very perfect condition on the south side of the\r\nclose. Among the interesting features of Lincoln, the treasurer had charge\r\nof a dispensary, which contained his stock of medicines; walls of an\r\napartment in the cathedral are still surrounded by the niches.[352]\r\n\r\nThe chapter-house of a cathedral, served by seculars, was a very important\r\nfeature. In monasteries it was always quadrangular, but in secular\r\ncathedrals, for some unknown reason, it was always polygonal.[353] It had\r\nalways a central pillar, from which the groining spread on all sides, like\r\nthe leaves of a palm-tree; externally it was covered with a tall conical\r\nroof. Here the dean and chapter met for the transaction of their capitular\r\naffairs, and here the bishop held his synods.\r\n\r\nThe _camera communis_ (common room) of the canons intervened between the\r\nnorth transept and the chapter-house; over the vestibule was the office of\r\nthe master of the works. Near by, north-east of the chapter-house, is a\r\nwell, covered with a little stone octagonal building with conical roof.\r\nWhen we call to mind that there are wells within several cathedral\r\nchurches--at York, in which King Edwin was baptized by Paulinus, at\r\nWinchester, and elsewhere--we are led to conjecture that the water of\r\nthese wells may have been used for various ritual purposes.\r\n\r\nThe date of the incorporation of the Dean and Chapter of Lincoln is 1086,\r\nand the bishop gave it statutes which seem to have been derived from\r\nRouen.[354] The historian, Henry of Huntingdon, gives a charming\r\ndescription of the members of the original chapter, who were personally\r\nknown to him, for he was the son of one of them.[355]\r\n\r\n    “Ralph the Dean, a venerable priest. Rayner the Treasurer, full of\r\n    religion, had prepared a tomb against the day of his death, and oft\r\n    sate by it singing of psalms and praying long whiles, to use himself\r\n    to his eternal home. Hugh the Chancellor, worthy of all memory, the\r\n    mainstay and, as it were, the foundation of the Church. Osbert,\r\n    Archdeacon of Bedford, afterward Chancellor, a man wholly sweet and\r\n    loveable. William, a young Canon of great genius. Albin (my own tutor)\r\n    and Albin’s brothers, most honourable men, my dearest friends, men of\r\n    profoundest science, brightest purity, utter innocence, and yet by\r\n    God’s inscrutable judgement they were smitten with leprosy; but death\r\n    hath made them clean. Nicolas, Archdeacon of Cambridge, Huntingdon,\r\n    and Hertford--none more beautiful in person, in character beautiful no\r\n    less, ‘Stella Cleri,’ so styled in his Epitaph [Henry’s father].\r\n    Walter, prince of orators. Gislebert, elegant in prose, in verse, in\r\n    dress. With many other honoured names with which I may not tax your\r\n    patience.”[356]\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons which Bishop Alnwick gave for assigning large salaries\r\nto the holders of stalls was the way in which they “devote themselves to\r\nthe public service, in self-imposed tasks over and above their daily\r\nexpositions and constant toils and numerous burdens.”[357]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the help of the “Valor Ecclesiasticus” of Henry VIII., we are able to\r\npeople the cathedral, and palace, and residentiary houses, and vicar’s\r\ncourt, and chantries, with the men who lived and served there at the time\r\nof the Reformation, and even to pry into their account-books and tell\r\ntheir several incomes, to the third part of a farthing.\r\n\r\nThe Right Rev. John Longland,[358] who was the bishop in those troublous\r\ntimes, lived in St. Hugh’s stately halls and towers on the sunny slope\r\nunder the shelter of the minster; and to maintain his dignity, and\r\nhousehold, and hospitalities, and various expenses, the annual value of\r\n“all the domains, manors, castles, parks, rectories, lands, tenements, and\r\nother temporal possessions,” of this see was £Mccclxxviij, viij, vq’,\r\n_i.e._ to say, £1378 8_s._ 5¼_d._; and “all the spiritualities of the said\r\nLord John” amounted, one year with another, to Diiij{xx}iiij, viij, xjq’,\r\n_i.e._ £584 8_s._ 11¼_d._; making together an income of mdcccclxij, xvij,\r\niiijob, or £1962 17_s._ 4½_d._, equivalent in our money to about £23,554\r\n8_s._ 6_d._[359]\r\n\r\nIf the reader does not know what the “spiritualities” here mentioned are,\r\nhe is not more ignorant than some great statesmen have been. For, on one\r\noccasion, the late Earl Russell asserted that the bishops received their\r\nspiritual authority from the Crown, on the ground that by one of the\r\ndocuments issued from a Crown office to a newly-elected bishop, restored\r\nthe “spiritualities” as well as the “temporalities” to the new occupant of\r\nthe see. The “Valor” tells us of what these spiritualities consisted:\r\nPortions and pensions from benefices, fees for procurations and synodals,\r\ninstitutions and inductions, faculties, probate of wills, and such-like.\r\nTemporalities, in short, are real property, and spiritualities are fees\r\nand perquisites.\r\n\r\nThe dean and chapter had, as a common fund, the profits of twenty\r\nappropriate rectories; and from these and other sources they derived an\r\nannual income; for part of which they were only trustees, and had to pay\r\nout of it for the maintenance of the choristers, and the stipends of\r\nvarious chantry priests and others; leaving a balance of £Dvj xiij iiij\r\nob’q di q’, which means £506 13_s._ 4½_d._ ¼ and half ¼. This balance was\r\ndivided among the six residentiary canons, making £83 11_s._ 1_d._ to\r\neach, with a remainder of ij ob’ di’q’, or 2½_d._ and half a farthing. The\r\nresidentiary canons in question were the dignitaries, Mr. George Hennage,\r\nthe Dean; James Mallet, the precentor; Christopher Massingberd, the\r\nchancellor; John Pryn, the sub-dean; and the others were, John\r\nTalbot[360] and Simon Green, _alias_ Foderby.\r\n\r\nThe dean and chapter were also trustees of a fabric fund derived from land\r\nand rents; out of which they had first to pay the stipends of several\r\nchantry priests, three and a chapel clerk serving the altar of the Blessed\r\nVirgin Mary, and one each at the Welburn and Crosby Chantries; then they\r\nhad to pay certain workmen constantly retained, a carpenter,\r\n“lathonius,”[361] plumber, glazier, smith, cleaner of brass vessels and\r\ncandelabra, surveyor of the fabric, organist[362] at the mass of the\r\nBlessed Virgin Mary, and lastly the bailiff of lands and tenements. The\r\nbalance after these payments was £575 7_s._ 2½_d._ ¼ and half ¼; and this\r\nbalance was divided among the six residentiary canons aforesaid, giving\r\n£95 17_s._ 10½_d._ to each; it must be borne in mind that they were liable\r\nfor occasional heavy expenditure on the repairs of fabric, which had to\r\ncome out of their purses. Each dignity had its own special endowments; the\r\nseparate estates of the deanery[363] produced an income of £196 10_s._\r\n8_d._; of the precentory £8 2_s._ 4_d._, of the chancery £54 1_s._ 5_d._,\r\nof the treasury £10 13_s._ 4_d._; of the sub-deanery £35 8_s._\r\n\r\nThen, again, every dignitary held a prebend of more or less value, which\r\nshall be set forth presently in a general statement.\r\n\r\nA little research reveals the fact that each of the dignitaries also held\r\none or more parochial benefices; for example, Mr. George Hennage[364] was\r\nMaster of the Collegiate Church of Tatteshall; he was also Rector of\r\nGedney, Washingburghe, Howby, Benningworth, and Flyxburgh.\r\n\r\nThe precentor also held the Rectory of Longleddenham. The chancellor was\r\nalso Vicar of Byker, Rector of Highkame, and Rector of Foletby. Mr. Pryn,\r\nthe sub-dean, seems to have held nothing besides his dignity and his\r\nprebendal stall, except the Singing Schools (under the precentor). There\r\nwere Prebendal Schools under the oversight of the prebendaries themselves,\r\nand others “which are maintained by local managers for the instruction of\r\ntheir parishioners in faith and letters.”\r\n\r\nIt may seem a little invidious, perhaps, to add these several sums\r\ntogether and bring out the totals; but it is a part of the work which we\r\nhave undertaken, and we do not feel at liberty to decline it; it will, at\r\nleast, remind us that we have in modern times made some economic changes\r\nin the administration of cathedral affairs; not altogether satisfactory\r\nones, for, with the usual want of moderation in the minds of reformers,\r\ninstead of judicious pruning, the cruel knife has left little beyond a\r\nbare stem.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then--\r\n\r\n    Mr. George Hennage, the dean, had £196 10_s._ 8_d._ of his deanery;\r\n    £83 11_s._ 1_d._ of the Dean and Chapter Fund; £95 17_s._ 10_d._ of\r\n    the Fabric Fund; £42 7_s._ 4_d._ of his Prebend of Biggleswade;[365]\r\n    £20 as Master of Tatteshall College;[366] £23 11_s._ as Rector of\r\n    Gedney;[367] £27 3_s._ 4_d._ as Rector of Washingborough;[368] £22\r\n    8_s._ 5¼_d._ as Rector of Howby;[369] £23 8_s._ 6_d._ as Rector of\r\n    Benningworth;[370] and £13 10_s._ as Rector of Flyxboro’;[371] making\r\n    a total of £548 8_s._ 3_d._\r\n\r\n    Mr. James Mallett, the precentor, had only £8 2_s._ 4_d._ of his\r\n    precentory; £83 11_s._ 1_d._ his share of the Dean and Chapter Fund;\r\n    £95 17_s._ 10_d._ of the Fabric Fund; he was Prebendary of\r\n    Empyngham,[372] which brought him £35 6_s._ 5_d._, and Rector of\r\n    Longleddenham,[373] £29 12_s._ 8_d._ Total, £252 10_s._ 4_d._\r\n\r\n    Mr. Christopher Massingberd, the chancellor, had £54 1_s._ 5_d._ of\r\n    his chancellorship; £83 11_s._ 1_d._ of the Dean and Chapter Fund; and\r\n    £95 17_s._ 10_d._ of the Fabric Fund; as Vicar of Byker,[374] £15; as\r\n    Rector of High Kame,[375] £19 16_s._ 2_d._; as Rector of Foletby,[376]\r\n    £21 2_s._ 8_d._ Total, £289 9_s._ 2_d._\r\n\r\n    The treasurership, vacant at that moment, was worth £10 13_s._ 4_d._;\r\n    with £83 11_s._ 1_d._ of the Dean and Chapter Fund, and £95 17_s._\r\n    10_d._ of the Fabric Fund. Total, £190 2_s._ 3_d._\r\n\r\n    Mr. John Pryn, the sub-dean, had £35 8_s._ of his dignity; £83 11_s._\r\n    1_d._ of the Dean and Chapter Fund; £95 17_s._ 10_d._ of the Fabric\r\n    Fund; and of his Prebend of Keton,[377] £29 10_s._ 2_d._ Total, £244\r\n    7_s._ 1_d._\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that these were great dignitaries of one of the\r\ngreatest and wealthiest dioceses, and had to maintain a certain degree of\r\nstate in their household and expenditure. Each dignitary had also to find\r\nat his own cost everything which belonged to his office; the precentor\r\neverything which belonged to Divine services, vestments, service books,\r\netc. The chancellor had to maintain the divinity school of the\r\ncathedral--at one time a very famous one, the cathedral grammar school,\r\nand was responsible for all the schools in the city and county.\r\n\r\nShould any reader have recognized among these dignitaries of Lincoln\r\nCathedral the names of well-known families of the diocese, he must not be\r\nsatisfied with a passing thought on the effect of family influence in the\r\ndistribution of Church patronage, which may be true enough; he must add\r\nthe reflection that in those times it was thought fitting not only to give\r\nthe grandest architecture, the most costly material, and the best art to\r\nthe material church, but also to dedicate the best blood of the people to\r\nits ministry; much as in old times the greatest and proudest nobles held\r\ndomestic offices--dapifer and the like--at the court of the king, and no\r\none who was not of gentle birth was thought worthy to attend him.\r\n\r\nWe shall entirely fail to understand the whole spirit and meaning of a\r\nmediæval cathedral if we have not fully grasped the idea that it was not\r\nintended to be merely a centre of busy diocesan work; the magnificent\r\nbuilding and its sumptuous furniture, the numerous and complex\r\norganization of its staff of ministers richly endowed, were all directed\r\nto the honour and worship of Almighty God. It was the embodiment in this\r\ndispensation of the ideal of worship which God Himself sanctioned in the\r\nold dispensation, when His Temple at Jerusalem was “exceeding\r\nmagnifical,”[378] and the high priest wore jewels of untold price on his\r\nmystic breastplate, and a whole tribe--a twelfth of the people--were set\r\napart for the ministry, and the well-endowed priests came up in the turn\r\nof their twenty-four courses to the honour of officiating for a fortnight\r\nin a year before the Presence in the Holy of Holies.\r\n\r\nThere were fifty-two prebendaries, whose canopied oak stalls form the most\r\nstriking feature of the choir of the cathedral. A prebend was sometimes a\r\nmanor, more frequently a rectory, rarely a sum of money, which formed an\r\nendowment for a canon.[379] For the most part the prebendaries were\r\nsupposed to reside upon their prebends, to maintain Divine service, and a\r\nschool, and hospitality there. Every prebendary was required to maintain a\r\nvicar choral at the cathedral; he himself came into residence for one\r\nweek in the year, and during that week took the principal position in the\r\ncathedral services. On his Sunday of duty he was expected to entertain\r\nnineteen of the under officers at dinner, and to receive others at\r\ndifferent meals during the week. The dean was required about thirty times\r\na year to give an “honorificus pastus” to all the choir and vicars, “to\r\nmake life and work more pleasant to them.”[380] One fact is enough to show\r\nthat the prebendaries of Lincoln were a very distinguished body of\r\nmen:--of the fifty-two stalls, all but one--some of them more than\r\nonce--has given a bishop to Lincoln, and from among them every English see\r\nhas been filled, and many of them twice.\r\n\r\nOne of the statutory duties of the prebendaries is very little known, and\r\nis so curious and interesting as to deserve mention here, even though it\r\nrequires a few words of preface to make the spirit of it quite\r\nintelligible. Among other remarkable designs which entered into pious\r\nminds in those mediæval communities was that of maintaining a ceaseless\r\nservice of praise--_laus perennis_--or a daily recitation of the whole\r\nPsalter. The former was a conventual devotion, and was done in this way:\r\nthere were always two priests before the altar, night and day, relieved at\r\nregular intervals, singing the Psalms. The latter was a cathedral\r\ndevotion, where it was a rule that the dean and prebendaries as a body\r\nshould say the whole Psalter every day to the glory of God. The same\r\ndevotion was maintained at Salisbury, Wells, and St. Paul’s. The task was\r\nnot a hard one, for the Psalter was divided among them; one prebend said\r\nthe first, second, third, fourth Psalms, another the fifth, sixth,\r\nseventh, and so on; the 119th Psalm was divided between several of them;\r\neach made it a matter of conscience to say the Psalms allotted to him; and\r\nthus, from the time of Bishop St. Hugh, the prebendaries of Lincoln,\r\nwherever they were scattered, were brought together in spirit by this\r\ninteresting observance, and said the whole Psalter daily to the glory of\r\nGod. It will perhaps surprise some of our readers to learn that they keep\r\nup the observance to this day.[381]\r\n\r\n    We shall not trouble the reader with more than a few notes on the\r\n    value of the fifty-two prebends. Some of them were very valuable,\r\n    _e.g._ Leighton Manor, Leighton Buzzard, Cropredy, and Sutton, each\r\n    brought in to their fortunate holders £40, but the majority were\r\n    between £5 and £10. There are several noticeable ones--the Prebend\r\n    Sexaginta Solidorum, and the Prebend Centum Solidorum, and the Prebend\r\n    Decem Librarum, _i.e._ the prebends of Sixty Shillings, a Hundred\r\n    Shillings, and Ten Pounds. The custos of St. Peter’s altar received\r\n    for commons and wine[382] as a canon £20 a year.\r\n\r\nSome of these prebends, as we have seen, were held by the dignitaries;\r\nsome, as we shall presently see, by the archdeacons. Some of them afforded\r\na comfortable maintenance alone. It is to be hoped that the holders of\r\nothers--especially of one whose value is returned as “nihil”--had other\r\nbenefices to help out their incomes. They were not by any means all given\r\nto priests in the diocese. A prebend was a very comfortable benefice,\r\nwhich might be held by anybody, and they were given to all sorts of\r\npeople; _e.g._ two of them seem to have been held by the Dean and\r\nPrecentor of Chichester.[383]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo assist the bishop in the spiritual oversight of this vast diocese,\r\nwhich embraced 8 counties, and extended from the Humber to the Thames, the\r\nbishop had 8 archdeacons, whose incomes and the sources of them are\r\nreported in the “Valor.”[384]\r\n\r\n    The Archdeacon of Lincoln received for procurations, £171 17_s._\r\n    10_d._, for synodals at Pentecost, £29 14_s._ 3_d._, and at\r\n    Michaelmas, £16 14_s._ 3_d._, and pensions, £5 17_s._, making a total\r\n    of £234 2_s._ 4_d._ But out of that he had to pay the Prebendary of\r\n    Ten Pounds £10, and 50_s._ to the Prebendary of Carleton, to his\r\n    Receiver-General £8 13_s._ 4_d._, and 58_s._ to the three vergers of\r\n    the Cathedral, leaving him a net income from this source of £179\r\n    19_s._ Archdeacon Richard Pate was also Prebendary of Sutton and\r\n    Buckingham, from which he received £110 3_s._ 6_d._; he was also\r\n    Rector of Kybworth, which was worth £39 14_s._ 11_d._; so that his\r\n    total income was £329 17_s._ 5_d._\r\n\r\n    The Archdeaconry of Stow was worth £24 2_s._ 8½_d._, and Archdeacon\r\n    Darley does not appear to have held other preferment, at least in\r\n    Lincoln Diocese.\r\n\r\n    The Archdeaconry of Huntingdon was worth £57 4_s._ 2_d._, and\r\n    Archdeacon Knight was also Prebendary of Farundon, worth £30 11_s._\r\n    2_d._\r\n\r\n    The Archdeaconry of Bedford was worth £57 2_s._ 3_d._, and Dr. Chamber\r\n    the Archdeacon was Prebendary of Leighton Buzzard, worth £40, Rector\r\n    of Leighton, worth £6 17_s._ 7¼_d._, and of Bowden Magna, worth £53\r\n    8_s._ 10½_d._\r\n\r\n    The Archdeaconry of Leicester was worth £80 12_s._ 4_d._ Dr. Foxe[385]\r\n    was the archdeacon.\r\n\r\n    The Archdeaconry of Northampton was worth £107 7_s._ Gilbert Smith,\r\n    the Archdeacon, was Prebendary of Leighton Bromeswold, worth £57\r\n    15_s._ 1_d._[386]\r\n\r\n    The Archdeaconry of Buckingham was worth £82 14_s._ 5_d._, and Richard\r\n    Leighton the archdeacon seems to have had no other preferment in the\r\n    Diocese of Lincoln.\r\n\r\n    The Archdeaconry of Oxford was worth £71 6_s._ Richard Coren, the\r\n    archdeacon, held also the Prebendary of Welton Paynshall, worth £5\r\n    11_s._ 11_d._\r\n\r\nThere were--or should have been--twenty-five _Vicars Choral_, who were\r\npaid a stipend, each by his own Prebendary, of £2. The Corporate Body of\r\nVicars also had property which yielded a net annual income of £145 11_s._\r\n2_d._, which divided between the twenty-five vicars gave to each £5 16_s._\r\n5_d._, “leaving a remainder of 9_d._ to be divided into twenty-five\r\nparts;” and fifteen of them had chantries assigned to them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the time of the “Taxatio” there appears to have been only one chantry\r\nin the cathedral, for the soul of Bishop Hugh of Wells; by the time of\r\nthe “Valor” the chantries had grown in number to thirty-six.\r\n\r\n    One vicar was cantarist of the Chantry of William Winchcome, which,\r\n    after giving 20_s._ to the poor and other payments, was worth £6 5_s._\r\n    4_d._ The same vicar received £2 for playing the organ at the Mass of\r\n    the Blessed Virgin Mary, and also £1 6_s._ 8_d._ for playing at the\r\n    Jesus Mass. Other vicars served the following chantries: of Hervey de\r\n    Luda, worth 9_s._ 4_d._; of Simon Barton, 9_s._; of William Thornake,\r\n    £4. 2_s._ 4_d._; of Henry Benyngworth, 8_s._ 8_d._; of Robert and John\r\n    Lacy, 8_s._; of William Hemyngburge and others, 8_s._; of William\r\n    FitzFulke, £4; of King Edward II., 12_s._, and the same clerk filled\r\n    the office of succentor, for which he received from the precentor\r\n    50_s._, and 6_s._ 6_d._ for wines at the Feast of the Assumption of\r\n    the Blessed Virgin Mary, and from the Chapter, 7_s._ 6_d._; for wines\r\n    at the end of the year _p’pastu chori_, 18_s._ 9_d._; making £4 12_s._\r\n    9_d._ The cantarist of Roger Benetson received £5 12_s._; of Walter\r\n    Stanreth, £4; of Oliver Sutton, 8_s._; of Geoffrey Pollard and others,\r\n    9_s._ 4_d._; of Gilbert Umfraville, £4 6_s._ 8_d._, the same clerk\r\n    occupied the office called Clerk of the Hospital, for which he\r\n    received from the Prior and Convent of St. Katharine juxta Lincoln,\r\n    24_s._ 2_d._; and from the Chapter for a gown, 9_s._, and other sums\r\n    amounting to £1 14_s._ 10_d._; of Hugh of Wells, after paying for 2\r\n    vicar chaplains, and to the vicars of the second form, and to the\r\n    servants of the Church, and in alms at the obit of the founder,\r\n    received £6, the same clerk filled the office of sacrist, for which he\r\n    received from the Treasurer and in perquisites, £6 17_s._ 6_d._ The 6\r\n    clerks who said the daily mass at the altar of the Blessed Virgin Mary\r\n    received each 13_s._ 5_d._ There were 4 vacancies in the body of\r\n    vicars choral, and the 4 shares were divided among the remaining 21\r\n    vicars.\r\n\r\n    Besides the chantries in the presentation of the dean and chapter, and\r\n    divided by them among the vicars choral, there were other chantries,\r\n    of which a separate account is given. Some of them with more than one\r\n    chaplain. The chantry of Nicholas de Cantelupe had 2 cantarists, who\r\n    received £19 10_s._ 2_d._ between them; that of Bishop Henry Lexington\r\n    had 2 cantarists, each of whom received 8_s._ 8_d._; 14 other\r\n    chantries were worth various sums, from 8_s._ 4_d._ to £13. The\r\n    chantry of Bartholomew Burghersh had 5 chaplains, who received £7\r\n    9_s._ 0½¼_d._ each, it also maintained 6 poor boys and their master at\r\n    a cost of £12 7_s._ 4_d._\r\n\r\nThe choristers had a special fund in the trusteeship of the dean and\r\nchapter, out of which were entirely maintained twelve boys and the master\r\nwho instructed them in singing, playing the organ, and grammar, at an\r\nannual cost of £34 13_s._ 5½_d._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo these ministers of the church must be added a number of officials of\r\nanother kind, the bailiffs, receivers, and auditors of the various\r\nproperties; the inferior servants of the church; the constable of the\r\nclose; the porters of the gates of the close; the searchers of the church\r\nor night watch, who had a timber chamber in the choir transept; and the\r\ndomestic servants of the residents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet the reader, who has perhaps wandered through the empty cathedral to\r\nadmire its wonderful proportions and beautiful architecture, and who has,\r\nwhile so doing, felt the moral chill of its emptiness, try to refurnish it\r\nwith the shrines, chapels, and tombs, the loft for the nightly watchers of\r\nthe shrine, the cell of the recluse priest, all inclosed within the vast\r\nground plan and towering height of the main building, reminding us of the\r\nmany mansions in the House of the Heavenly Father. Or let him place\r\nhimself in imagination in the choir on the day on which the mediæval\r\nbishop was holding his synod. The stalls at the west end are occupied by\r\nthe dean and the four dignitaries in their copes, who face eastward and\r\noverlook the whole assembly. The canopied stalls on the sides are filled\r\nby their prebendaries in surplice and furred cope; the vicars choral and\r\nthe choristers are in their places in the subsellæ on each side; the long\r\nrows of benches in front of the stalls are filled by the clergy of the\r\ndiocese, so many as can find room; the bishop in cope and mitre occupies\r\nhis lofty canopied throne at the east end of the south line of stalls; the\r\ngreat nave beyond is crowded with the rest of the clergy and their\r\nsynodsmen, and the citizens, and the people from the country round,\r\nattracted to the imposing spectacle. It is the whole people of a diocese\r\nstretching from the Humber to the Thames, which by representation has\r\nassembled in the mother church to listen to their bishop’s fatherly\r\nexhortations, and to join with him in a united service of worship of\r\nAlmighty God.\r\n\r\nLet us adjourn to the chapter-house, which seems so empty and so useless\r\nto the modern visitor. See it filled now, with the bishop on the stone\r\nthrone opposite the entrance, and the dignitaries of the cathedral and the\r\narchdeacons seated to right and left of him, and the whole area crowded\r\nwith the clergy and synodsmen; it is the people of his diocese--the\r\nclergy in person, the laity by their representatives--come to report\r\nthemselves to their bishop, to submit themselves to his jurisdiction, to\r\nreceive his admonitions and counsels. The House of Lords is a rather\r\ndepressing spectacle to the visitor who gazes on its empty grandeur; but\r\nsee it filled on some great day, _e.g._ when the Sovereign opens\r\nParliament in person, and it is not too grand for the meeting-place of the\r\nSovereign and Peers of Britain and for the transaction of the business of\r\nan Empire. In the chapter-house it was the spiritual business of the King\r\nof kings which was transacted--business which concerned the eternal\r\ninterests of those present; so the grand and beautiful building, with its\r\nsoaring central pillar and its overshadowing groining, was not too grand\r\nfor the spiritual significance of the multitude which its walls encircled.\r\n\r\nSo the broad lawns which surround the building were not left only to\r\nenable the spectator to obtain a good view of the building. Their use was\r\nseen on St. Hugh’s Day, when the people of the town and villages came\r\ntrooping in at every gate, with crosses and banners and painted wands, and\r\nneeded space in which to arrange the long procession which wound slowly\r\nround the close and entered by the western door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe magnitude and importance of the dioceses differed greatly, and so did\r\nthe emoluments of the bishops and of the cathedral establishments. We\r\nhave given Lincoln as an example of the greater dioceses; we may take the\r\nDiocese of the South Saxons, with its See at Chichester, as an example of\r\nthe smaller.\r\n\r\nWhen the bishop-stool of the South Saxons was removed after the Norman\r\nConquest from Selsey to Chichester, Earl Roger of Montgomery gave the\r\nsouth-west quarter of the city, including a portion of the old Roman walls\r\nwhich protected it, for a site for the cathedral. A nunnery with a church\r\ndedicated to St. Peter already existed on the site; the nuns were\r\ntransferred elsewhere, and the church used as the germ of the cathedral\r\nchurch.[387] Bishop Stigand built a new church of timber, which was soon\r\nreplaced. The able and energetic Bishop Ralph Luffa was the real founder\r\nof the present cathedral. His church was of the normal Norman plan, a\r\ncross church with a low central tower and two west towers, all of massive\r\nconstruction, plain almost to sternness. It was in the thirteenth century\r\nthat, among other great additions to the church, the central tower was\r\nraised by the addition of another story; and not till the fifteenth\r\ncentury that the lofty and graceful spire was added which was the peculiar\r\nglory of Chichester.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the cathedral was in the main the same as at Lincoln,\r\nthe bishop, dean, precentor, chancellor, and treasurer, with twenty-eight\r\nprebendaries, twelve vicars choral, etc., and two archdeacons.\r\n\r\nThe information given us in the “Taxatio” of the finances of the diocese\r\nin 1291 is scanty:--\r\n\r\n    The temporalities[388] of the bishop were valued at £462 4_s._ 6¾_d._\r\n\r\n    The dean and chapter had estates, appropriate rectories, portions,\r\n    pensions, etc., which brought in a clear income of £310 14_s._ 6½_d._\r\n\r\n    The dignities of the cathedral are given as follows:--\r\n\r\n    The deanery with a prebend, £53 6_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\n    The chantry, £53 6_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\n    The chancellor with the Rectory of Chiddingly, £53 6_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\n    The treasurer, _per se_ £46 13_s._ 4_d._\r\n\r\n    Then came twenty-eight other prebends, ranging from £4 13_s._ 4_d._ to\r\n    £40, making up the total income of the dignitaries and prebendaries to\r\n    £706 13_s._ 4_d._\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the “Valor” (vol. i. p. 293), we find fuller details of\r\nthe condition of things at the end of the fifteenth century. “The annual\r\nvalue of all and singular, the houses, castles, domains, manors, lands,\r\nand tenements, and other temporal possessions whatsoever, and also of the\r\ntithes, oblations, pensions, portions, and other spiritual profits\r\nwhatsoever, of the Reverend Father in Christ, Robert, Bishop of\r\nChichester,” amounted to spiritualities, £138 17_s._ 9_d._;\r\ntemporalities,[389] £589 10_s._ 2_d._; or, after certain allowed\r\ndeductions, to a clear total of £677 1_s._ 3_d._\r\n\r\nThe income of the dean and chapter has grown to £310 14_s._ 6½_d._; we\r\nhave no note of the way in which it was disposed of.\r\n\r\n    The income of the dean, William Fleshmonger, was £58 9_s._ 4_d._ We\r\n    have no reason to doubt that he was identical with the William\r\n    Fleshmonger who was Rector of Selsey,[390] worth £11 3_s._ 4_d._; with\r\n    the Dr. William Fleshmonger who was Rector of Storyngton,[391] £18;\r\n    and with the William Fleshmonger who was Rector of Hertfield,[392] £7.\r\n    No doubt it was the dean who was the tenant by indenture for a term of\r\n    years from Battle Abbey, at a rent of £15 6_s._ 8_d._, of the Manor of\r\n    Apultram[393] near Chichester, and in all probability he is identical\r\n    with the William Fleshmonger who held the Prebend of Carlton cum\r\n    Dalby[394] of the Church of Lincoln.\r\n\r\n    The Dignity of the Precentory had endowment to the amount of £35 0_s._\r\n    5½_d._, and Charles William Horsey seems to have had no other\r\n    preferment in Chichester Diocese. But among the Prebendaries of\r\n    Lincoln there is also a William Horsey, Prebendary of Scamelsby,[395]\r\n    who may very possibly have been identical with our Precentor.\r\n\r\n    The Dignity of Chancellor was endowed with a clear £27 7_s._, and we\r\n    find that Mr. George Croft was also Prebendary of Middleton,[396]\r\n    worth £2 3_s._ 4_d._ There was also a George Croft, Rector of\r\n    Wynford,[397] £21 12_s._ 10_d._, in the diocese of Bath and Wells, who\r\n    may have been our chancellor.\r\n\r\n    The treasurer, Hugho Rolfe, after paying two servants and other dues,\r\n    had a clear £62 6_s._ 8_d._ from the dignity, and held besides the\r\n    Prebend of Braklesham,[398] £11 17_s._ 3½_d._, and apparently the\r\n    vicarage of Henfield,[399] £16 9_s._ 9½_d._\r\n\r\n           *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The dignity of the Archdeaconry of Chichester was worth £38 3_s._\r\n    4_d._, and the Archdeacon John Worthial also held the Prebend of Huve\r\n    Town,[400] £10; he seems also to have held the benefice of Sutton, £15\r\n    0_s._ 6_d._;[401] but we hesitate to identify the venerable archdeacon\r\n    with the William Worthiall who held the two Chantries of Eastangmering\r\n    and Fyrring,[402] though no doubt his friends would often jestingly\r\n    assure him that if he had half a dozen more sinecures he would still\r\n    have been “worthy all.” The Archdeaconry of Lewes was worth £39 14_s._\r\n    10_d._, and Archdeacon More was also Prebendary of Coleworth,[403] £18\r\n    13_s._ 4_d._, and is probably identical with the Edward More who was\r\n    Vicar of Bexhill,[404] worth £23 10_s._ 2_d._ There were altogether\r\n    thirty-one prebends ranging in value from £10 to £20; four of these\r\n    were added by Bishop Sherborne a little before the Reformation,\r\n    restricted to men of Winchester and New Colleges, who were required to\r\n    serve in their own persons without deputies.\r\n\r\nResidentiaries on first appointment to office were bound to attend every\r\nservice without a single omission for a year, and in case of an omission\r\nto recommence their course.\r\n\r\n    There were twelve vicars choral who received £2 12_s._ 8_d._ each, and\r\n    fourteen chantries which were served by the vicars choral, the profits\r\n    of each ranging between £3 and £13. There were also eight choristers\r\n    and four thuribulers.[405]\r\n\r\n“Bishop Sherborne, just before the Reformation, having ruled\r\nmagnificently, laid down his staff and mitre weary with the weight of\r\nninety years and more, and left his statutes chained to his throne;\r\nbegging the kindly thoughts of all sorts and conditions of men; with a\r\nbequest of crown soleil, and bread and good wine to be offered to the\r\nbishop at his ‘jocund coming’ on a visitation; ypocras and choice fruits\r\nfor the crowned king and primate; wine to be drunk round the city cross\r\nfor the young; ample doles for the aged; marriage portions out of the\r\nannual residue for poor girls; egg flip with milk and sugar, coloured with\r\nsaffron, for the choristers; and a dinner to the chapter on his\r\nanniversary.”[406]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are some examples in England of that annexation of temporal rule to\r\ncertain episcopal sees, of which the independent prince bishops of Germany\r\nare instances still more illustrious, and the Bishop of Rome the most\r\nremarkable. The _Bishops of Durham_ were the temporal rulers of the\r\ndistrict of country between the Tees and the Tyne, and almost independent\r\nof the king; while the men of “the bishopric,” as it was called in a\r\nspecial sense, were the servants of St. Cuthbert, and subject to none but\r\nCuthbert’s successor. This privilege arose from a gift of the district to\r\nSt. Cuthbert and his successors by King Guthred in the year 883. The\r\n_Bishops of Winchester_ were anciently reputed to be Earls of Southampton,\r\nand possessed a certain temporal authority, the origin of which is not\r\nknown to the writer. The _Bishop of Ely_ was in ancient times supreme in\r\nthe Isle, which was, if not a county palatine, at least a royal franchise,\r\nwith courts and exclusive jurisdiction of its own; of which traces remain\r\nin the existing arrangements, in that it has no Lord-Lieutenant, and is in\r\nevery way distinct from the rest of the county in which it is situated. It\r\nis reasonable to suppose that the bishop (created in 1108) derived this\r\nauthority as the successor of the abbots, who received it as the\r\nrepresentatives of Queen Etheldreda, the founder, in continuance of\r\nprivileges conferred on the queen when King Tondbert gave the Isle to her\r\nin dower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nMONKS AND FRIARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have only to deal here with the relations of the religious houses with\r\nthe clergy, and their influence upon the general religious life of clergy\r\nand people.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the monasteries kept before the minds both of parish priests\r\nand of their people the ideal of an unambitious, self-denying, studious,\r\nmeditative, religious life. No doubt many of the monks and nuns fell short\r\nof their own ideal, and there were occasional scandals; we find notices in\r\nthe registers of the bishops of their intervention in such cases. But the\r\nlives of the majority were sufficiently respectable to maintain the credit\r\nof the institution, and there were always some whose lives were exemplary.\r\nWe may produce an evidence of the general feeling on the subject from the\r\nreport of the commissioners of Henry VIII., who were sent to inquire into\r\nthe state of the smaller monasteries, with a view to their suppression.\r\nThe report stated that there were all sorts of abuses and scandals in the\r\nsmaller houses, and recommended that they should be suppressed, and that\r\ntheir inhabitants should be transferred to “the great solemn monasteries\r\nof this realm, wherein--thanks be to God--religion is right well kept and\r\nobserved.” As to their report against the smaller houses; they had been\r\nemployed on purpose to make out a case against them, and the world has\r\nlong since come to the conclusion that their adverse testimony is not to\r\nbe believed.\r\n\r\nIf we are right in these enlightened days in thinking that fine public\r\nbuildings for the housing of parliaments, municipal corporations, and the\r\nlike civil institutions of the nation tend to give dignity to the national\r\nlife; and that galleries of sculpture and painting, and museums of art,\r\nexercise an elevating influence on the popular mind; it can hardly be\r\ndenied that the religious houses, with their stately groups of buildings,\r\ntheir sublime churches, and the numerous beautiful works of sculpture,\r\npainting, embroidery, and goldsmiths’ work which they contained, must have\r\nhad a similar influence upon the religious sentiment and the æsthetic\r\neducation of the people. A mediæval town was greatly the richer,\r\nreligiously and intellectually, for having a great monastery in its\r\nsuburb. The half-dozen religious houses--great and small--in a rural\r\ncounty had a religious, civilizing, elevating influence over the whole\r\ncountry-side. Even their empty ruins have not lost all their influence.\r\nThe stately relics of the Yorkshire abbeys give added interest and dignity\r\nto the great northern county. What would the Isle of Ely be without the\r\nsolemn grandeur of its cathedral church?\r\n\r\nThere is not enough left of any one of our own monasteries to enable the\r\nvisitor to its mournful ruins to realize how each was a little town,\r\nprotected by its walls and gate towers; with the roofs and chimneys of its\r\nnumerous domestic buildings, and the trees of its gardens and orchards\r\nappearing over the walls; and the towers of its great church forming the\r\ncentre of the architectural group, as it was the centre of the life of the\r\ninhabitants. We have, therefore, borrowed an illustration from Clugny, the\r\nparent and prototype of the houses of the Reformed Benedictine Orders.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe “Religious” and the upper classes of society were more in touch than\r\nat first sight appears. The great families kept up friendly relations[407]\r\nwith the houses which their ancestors had founded, of which they were\r\nstill the patrons, and from time to time benefactors. People of the upper\r\nclasses, in travelling, usually sought hospitality at the religious\r\nhouses, and were entertained by the abbot, while their people were cared\r\nfor in the guest house. The monks and nuns were largely taken from these\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abbey of Cluny, as it was.]\r\n\r\nThroughout the Middle Ages the monks--especially the\r\nBenedictines--continued to cultivate learning, both secular and religious.\r\nThe chroniclers of the greater monasteries were the only historians of the\r\ntime, and their collections of books were the libraries of the nation.\r\nSome of the great monasteries served the purpose of the great public\r\nschools of modern times, and the nunneries especially were--as they are\r\nstill in Continental countries--the schools of the daughters of the\r\ngentry.\r\n\r\nLong after they had ceased to be the pioneers leading the way in reducing\r\nthe waste lands under cultivation, the monks continued to set an example\r\nto the lay gentry and landowners in enterprising scientific agriculture\r\nand horticulture; and in the refinement of domestic economy they were ages\r\nahead of the rest of the community; they utilized streams for water power,\r\nfor irrigation, and for sanitation; they sought out pure water for\r\ndomestic use, and brought it long distances by conduits. The Church,\r\nregular and secular, was a liberal landlord. Not a few of its tenants,\r\nseated generation after generation on its manors, grew into knightly and\r\nnoble families.\r\n\r\nThe monasteries exercised a most important direct influence upon the\r\nparochial clergy and their people owing to the fact that they were the\r\npatrons of a large proportion of the parishes; and nominated the vicars\r\nwho were to teach and minister to the people of those parishes. In many\r\ncases where a monastery adjoined a town, the convent had the patronage of\r\nall the vicarages in the town in its hands; and their bias would lead them\r\nto appoint men of a “religious” tone of character.\r\n\r\nThat the monks were not unpopular is proved by two facts. First, that the\r\nHouse of Commons only passed the first Act of Suppression of the smaller\r\nhouses under the coercion of the king’s personal threats; and, secondly,\r\nthat the suppression was so resented by the people that in several parts\r\nof the country the people rose in armed rebellion against it.\r\n\r\nBut we must be content to indicate thus briefly that the monastic\r\ninstitution in many ways exercised a powerful influence upon the national\r\nlife and religion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Mendicant Orders require a more lengthened consideration, for they\r\nwere founded as an auxiliary to the ancient diocesan and parochial\r\ninstitution, in direct pastoral ministrations to the people, and played an\r\nimportant part in the religious life of the nation.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century--as again in our day--the increasing population\r\nhad grown too great for the agricultural needs of the country, and the\r\nsurplus population had flocked into the towns. The result then, as now,\r\nwas overcrowding, the building of unhealthy houses in the suburbs,\r\npoverty, dirt, and disease; and, as a consequence, ignorance and\r\nirreligion. Leprosy, brought probably from the East by the returning\r\nCrusaders, had become permanent and widely spread among all ranks and\r\nclasses.[408] At the same time a wave of wild opinions, political and\r\nreligious, was sweeping across Europe which reached this island almost a\r\ncentury later under the name of Lollardism, and created disaffection in\r\nChurch and State.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual disorder excited the zeal of the Spanish canon, Dominic,\r\nwho organized an order of preaching friars, to go about teaching the truth\r\nand contending against dangerous error. About the same time the heart of\r\nFrancis, a citizen of Amalfi, was fired with compassion for the misery of\r\nthe poor and sick, and he organized an order of brothers, whose duty it\r\nwas to minister to suffering humanity. Both orders speedily became very\r\npopular, and spread over Europe. The Dominicans introduced themselves into\r\nEngland at Oxford, in 1221, and were patronized by Archbishop Stephen\r\nLangton. The first Franciscans came three years afterwards to Canterbury;\r\nand both orders spread as rapidly here as in the other countries of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Semi-choir of Franciscan Friars. (Fourteenth century MS.\r\nin British Museum. Domitian, A. 17.)]\r\n\r\nThe organization of both orders ran on the same lines. Each was an\r\necclesiastical army. Each had a general of the order residing in Rome,\r\nunder the special protection and correction of one of the cardinals. Under\r\nthe general was a provincial in each country into which the order\r\nextended. The houses of the order in each country were gathered into\r\ngroups, called by the Dominicans, “Visitations,” and by the Franciscans,\r\n“Custodies.” The English province of the Franciscans was divided into\r\nseven custodies or wardenships, each including eight or nine\r\nconvents,[409] and comprising most of the great towns. The Dominicans had\r\nfifty-eight convents here; the Franciscans 75. The officers were all\r\nelected at a chapter, were required to resign at the ensuing chapter, and\r\nmight be removed at any time for insufficiency or misconduct.\r\n\r\nThe Carmelite Friars had their origin in the East, and were introduced\r\ninto England by Sir John de Vesey, on his return from the Crusade in the\r\nearly part of the thirteenth century. It had ultimately about five houses\r\nin England. The Austin Friars, founded about the middle of the century,\r\nhad about forty-five houses here. These make up the four orders, Black,\r\nGrey, White, and Austin. All smaller foundations were suppressed or\r\nincluded in the Austins, by the Council of Lyons, in 1370.\r\n\r\nThe great difference between the monks and the friars was that the ideal\r\nof the monastic life was seclusion from the world for prayer and\r\nmeditation with a view to the cultivation of one’s own soul; that of the\r\nfriar’s life was devotion to active work. The great economical difference\r\nwas that the monks were individually vowed to poverty, but as communities\r\nthey were wealthy, while the friars were vowed to have no property\r\nindividually or collectively, and to live of the alms of the people.\r\n\r\nAt first the friars were very successful in England, as elsewhere. Bishops\r\nlike Stephen Langton and Grostete patronized them. Before long members of\r\nthe mendicant orders became themselves bishops and archbishops. They sent\r\ntheir young men to the universities, and cultivated learning so\r\nsuccessfully that they soon became the most famous teachers in the\r\nuniversities of Europe. Among the people generally they effected a great\r\nrevival of religion, which Sir J. Stephen compares with the revival in\r\nmore modern times effected by the preaching of Wesley and Whitefield.\r\n\r\nThe friaries were always founded in, or in the suburbs of, the larger\r\ntowns, for their mission was to the masses of the people. But they had a\r\nsystem of itineration, which seems to have divided the country into\r\ndistricts, and sent the friars two and two, visiting not only the villages\r\nbut the houses of the gentry and farmers. This brought the friars into\r\nrivalry with the parish priests. In the towns the Dominicans often built a\r\nlarge church, planned so as to form an auditorium, and attracted large\r\ncongregations by their popular preaching. The friars laid themselves out\r\nalso for special services, which would attract the sluggish and popularize\r\nreligion, such as miracle plays and the observance of special festivals.\r\nIn the villages the itinerant friar preached in the church or churchyard,\r\nand heard the confessions of those who chose to come to him; and there\r\nwere many who preferred to confess their misdoings to a comparative\r\nstranger, who did not live among them, rather than to their parish priest.\r\n\r\nSo says Chaucer--\r\n\r\n  He had power of confession,\r\n  As said himself, more than a curate,\r\n  For of his order he was licentiate.\r\n  Full sweetly heard he confession,\r\n  And pleasant was his absolution.\r\n  He was an easy man to give penance\r\n  There as he wist to have a good pittance,\r\n  For unto a poor order for to give\r\n  Is sign that a man is well yshrive.\r\n              “Prologue to the Canterbury Tales.”\r\n\r\nBoth in town and country they offered the fraternity of their convent to\r\nbenefactors, with its prayers for their good estate while living, and\r\nsought to have masses for the dead entrusted to them on the ground that a\r\nconvent of friars would pray them out of purgatory ten times as soon as a\r\nsingle parish priest.\r\n\r\n  “Thomas, Thomas, so might I ride or go,\r\n  And by that lord that cleped is St. Ive,\r\n  N’ere[410] thou our brother shouldest thou not thrive.\r\n  In our chapter pray we day and night\r\n  To Christ that he here send hele and might[411]\r\n  Thy body for to welden hastilee.”\r\n\r\nThe rustic roughly answers--\r\n\r\n  “God wot, quoth he, I nothing thereof feel,\r\n  So help me Christ as I in fewe years\r\n  Have spended upon divers manner freres\r\n  Full many a pound, yet fare I never the bet.”\r\n  “Ye sayn me thus how that I am your brother.\r\n  Ye, certes, quod the friar, trusteth wee,\r\n  I took our dame the letter under our sel.”[412]\r\n                Chaucer, “The Sompnour’s Tale.”\r\n\r\nSo “Piers Plowman” says--\r\n\r\n  “I am Wrath, quod he, I was sum tyme a frere\r\n  And the convent’s gardyner for to graff impes\r\n  On limitours and lesyngs I imped\r\n  Till they bere leaves of low speech lordes to please,\r\n  And sithen they blossomed abrode in bower to hear shrifts.\r\n  And now is fallen thereof a fruite, that folk have well liever\r\n  Shewen ther shriftes to hem than shryve them to their parsons.\r\n  And now parsons have percyved that freres part with them,\r\n  These possessioners preache and deprave freres,\r\n  And freres find them in default, as folk beareth witness.”\r\n\r\nBonaventure, when General of the Franciscans, in a letter to one of his\r\nprovincials, expresses great dissatisfaction with those of the brethren\r\nwho, contrary to the rule of Francis, assault the clergy in their sermons\r\nbefore the laity, and only sow scandal, strife, and hatred, and with those\r\nwho injure the parish priests by monopolizing to themselves the burial of\r\nthe dead and the drawing up of wills, thereby making the whole Order\r\ndetested by the clergy. But he complains of the injustice done by accusing\r\nthe whole of what was the fault only of a few--“the scum floats on the\r\nsurface, and is noticed by every one.”[413] It was rather hard, perhaps,\r\non the parish priest, that he should not only be obliged to submit to the\r\nintrusion of the friar, but should be expected to offer hospitality to the\r\nintruder, and make much of him, as a constitution of Archbishop Peckham\r\ndesires him to do.[414]\r\n\r\nIt is the popular belief that the friars, after having in the first burst\r\nof their enthusiasm effected a great revival of religion, very soon\r\ndeparted from the principles of their founders, became useless, if not\r\nmischievous, and fell into universal disfavour. There is no denying that\r\nthe splendid enthusiasm of their first institution cooled down, and the\r\nwonderful revival of popular religion which it brought about seemed to die\r\nout; it is the inevitable course of all such revivals; but it left good\r\nperennial results behind.\r\n\r\nThe burgesses of the towns in which the friaries were situated seem to\r\nhave regarded them as useful workers among the poor. In many of the towns\r\nthe civic authorities consented to hold the site and buildings of the\r\nfriaries in trust, in order to evade the rule which forbade the orders\r\nthemselves to hold property. The friars continued to live, and their\r\ncontinuance depended upon the daily voluntary alms of the townspeople. The\r\nchurches of the friars were favourite places for civic functions and\r\nmiracle plays; the people sought burial in their precincts; and down to\r\nthe very eve of their dissolution a great number of wills, both of clergy\r\nand laity, contain small bequests to the friars. Perhaps the most striking\r\nevidence in their favour at the very end of their existence in England is\r\nthat Edward IV. was a great patron of the Observants (the strictest\r\nsection of the Franciscans); Henry VII. founded six convents of them; and\r\nHenry VIII. took one of them as his confessor. It is a fact which tells in\r\ntheir favour that they had not grown wealthy. When the dissolution came,\r\nthe jackals of Henry VIII. found nothing but the houses and their\r\nprecincts, usually in a poor neighbourhood, and their churches. Their\r\nincome is commonly returned at 20_s._ to 40_s._, and the total value of\r\nthe property, when the prior’s house and the garden and orchard and the\r\nwhole convent was let out on rent, was seldom over £10 a year.[415]\r\n\r\nThe truth seems to be that the friars continued to be the most popular\r\npreachers, and to carry on a steady work among the poor of the towns. But,\r\nstrongly papal in sentiment, their constitution made them an organized\r\npropaganda of any ideas which the cardinal protectors and generals of the\r\norders residing in Rome suggested to the provincials in the several\r\nnations, they to the wardens of the districts, they to the priors of the\r\nhouses, they to their individual friars, and they through the streets of\r\nthe city and the length and breadth of the land. It was, perhaps, their\r\npolitical opposition to Henry VIII. more than any other cause of offence\r\nor dereliction of duty, which provoked their overthrow.\r\n\r\nThe two chief faults of the system were the principle of mendicancy and\r\nthe exemption from episcopal control. It is worth while to study the\r\ninstitution carefully, for something of the same kind--brotherhoods of\r\neducated and trained men, who are content to abandon the world’s\r\nambitions, to live among the poor, to preach the gospel in a popular way,\r\nand to minister to the temporal sufferings of the people--is exactly what\r\nis wanted to produce a new revival among the masses of the people; and we\r\nneed to ascertain the secrets of the friars’ strength and of their\r\nweakness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nTHE “TAXATIO” OF POPE NICHOLAS IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century the popes assumed the right, as feudal lords\r\nover the Church, to demand from every church benefice a fine of its first\r\nyear’s income from every new incumbent, and an annual tax of one-tenth of\r\nits income. The Saxon kings had made the Church lands exempt from state\r\nimposts;[416] but now kings very naturally began to think that the\r\nnecessities of the State had as good a claim as those of the pope; and\r\nthere ensued a certain amount of friction. The popes, with very astute\r\npolicy, reconciled the kings to the tax by sometimes ceding the proceeds\r\nof it to them. Thus in 1253, Pope Innocent IV. gave the tenths to King\r\nHenry III. for three years, which occasioned a taxation or valuation to be\r\nmade in the following year, sometimes called the Norwich Taxation,\r\nsometimes Pope Innocent’s Valor.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1288, Pope Nicholas IV. gave the tenths to King Edward I. for\r\nsix years, towards an expedition to the Holy Land; that they might be\r\nfully collected a new taxation was made by the king’s precept, which was\r\nbegun in that year and finished in the province of Canterbury in 1291, and\r\nin the province of York in 1292.[417] This taxation continued to be the\r\nbasis of all assessments upon the Church down to the time of the\r\nReformation.\r\n\r\nThe survey takes each diocese by itself, each archdeaconry of the diocese,\r\neach rural deanery, and, finally, each benefice.

Where it is followed\r\nby _Vicaria ejusdem_--the vicarage of the same--it implies that the\r\nrectory had been appropriated to some religious house, which had founded a\r\nvicarage therein; in this particular deanery there is only one vicarage;\r\nbut it is very possible, for anything which appears, that some of the\r\nEcclesiæ may have been appropriated to a religious house, which was\r\ntechnically the rector possessing all spiritual and temporal rights in the\r\nchurch and parish, and serving the cure by one of its own members, or by a\r\nstipendiary priest.\r\n\r\nEven where the benefice had not been appropriated to a religious house, it\r\noften happened that some “portion” of the profits of the benefice--_e.g._\r\nof the tithe or of some part of the land--had been appropriated; or that a\r\ndefinite annual payment, “pension,” had been assigned out of the\r\nbenefice. Thus, under “Ecclesia de Oresith,” the rectory of Orsett,\r\nappears quite a list of “portions,” viz. of the Chancellor of St. Paul’s,\r\nof Mr. John of St. Clair, of the Prior of Prittlewell, of the Abbot of\r\nWestminster, of the Dean of St. Martin, London; the Abbot of Bileigh had a\r\n“pension” out of the rectory of Stanford, the Prior of Oakburn out of\r\nDunton, the Abbot of Battle out of Hutton. There are two ways of\r\nexplaining this. One is the way of the enemy of the religious houses,\r\nwhose cynical explanation is that the monks had their spoon in everybody’s\r\nporridge--the Rector of Orsett had half a dozen spoons clattering together\r\nin his dish. The other explanation is that of the friend of the religious\r\nhouses: that they were held in such general admiration, that lords of\r\nmanors and patrons of parochial benefices who could not do more, at least\r\nmade small appropriations to them out of their patronage, in token of good\r\nwill, and in order to secure a permanent interest in the friendship and\r\nprayers of the Religious. With these explanations of the list of benefices\r\nof the deanery of Barstaple, we leave it for the present, proposing to\r\nmake it the text of further exposition hereafter.[419]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn studying this mediæval clergy-list, the first thought which occurs to\r\nevery one is to count the parishes and ascertain the total. Allowing for\r\ndifficulties which tend to a few omissions, or the counting of a few\r\nnames over again, it may be depended upon that the number of parishes was\r\nabout 8085; that out of those which had been appropriated to religious\r\nbodies vicarages had been endowed in about 1487, the 457 chapels had\r\nprobably some endowment, besides the chapels-of-ease, dependent on the\r\nincumbent of the parish. Adding the parish churches and chapels together,\r\nwe get a total of 8542 endowed places of public worship and centres of\r\npastoral care.[420]\r\n\r\n                                  Vicarages          Ecclesiæ not\r\n                                 founded in            exceeding  Vicarages\r\n                       Ecclesiæ.    them.

The general idea is that the mediæval clergy were richly\r\nendowed. The truth which is revealed by the figures of this official\r\ndocument is that, when we take away the livings assigned by their patrons\r\nas the prebends of cathedrals, and those appropriated to religious houses,\r\nthe benefices of the “working clergy,” the rectors and vicars, were mostly\r\nof small value.\r\n\r\nBefore we go into a detailed examination of them, it is desirable to make\r\ntwo preliminary remarks. The first is as to the value of money at that\r\nperiod. The question will be more fully considered in the next chapter in\r\nconnection with the new valuation which was made in the time of Henry\r\nVIII., but it will be convenient to anticipate here the estimate there\r\naccepted that the purchasing power of money at the end of the thirteenth\r\ncentury was about twenty-four times as great as now, so that a pound was\r\nthen equivalent to about £24 now. The other remark is in reply to the\r\nquestion which will naturally arise in every reader’s mind: were not the\r\nbenefices much undervalued? On the contrary, it was the object of pope and\r\nking to estimate them as highly as possible, so as to increase the amount\r\nof the tenth to be demanded from them. Every source of income was taken\r\ninto the account; and the general complaint at the time was that they were\r\noverestimated.\r\n\r\nTurning now to a little study of the value of the ordinary parochial\r\nbenefices, the writer has shrunk from the laborious task of anything like\r\na complete analysis; for a few general facts are sufficient for the\r\npresent purpose. First of all, many of the benefices were so small that\r\nboth pope and king[421] were ashamed to demand a tenth of their poor\r\nincome; a limit of ten marks (= £6 13_s._ 4_d._) was fixed, and all\r\nlivings not over that sum were exempted. No wonder, when we reckon that\r\nthe present value of a benefice of ten marks would be about £160 a year.\r\nBut there were 2711 rectories and 1129 vicarages, making a total of 3840,\r\nnearly half the number of parochial benefices under the limit of ten\r\nmarks.\r\n\r\nLooking at the better-endowed benefices: Canterbury was an exceptionally\r\nrich diocese; out of its 279 benefices, there are 82 of ten marks and\r\nunder, only 80 above £20, and the richest living, a rare exception, is\r\n£133. In Rochester, with 139 benefices, 46 are less than ten marks, only\r\n34 of £20 and upwards, and there are two “golden livings” of £60 each. In\r\nExeter diocese, out of 668 benefices, there are 189 of ten marks and\r\nunder, 15 of £20 and over, only one so large as £50. In Bath and Wells,\r\nout of 304 parishes, there are 124 under ten marks; three of £50 and over,\r\nand the highest is one of £60. In Carlisle, out of 24 parishes, there are\r\n18 of ten marks and under; 42 of £20 and over; one of £90, and one of\r\n£120. The usual income of a vicarage was £5, a little more or less; there\r\nare very few of greater value, up to £8 and £10.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion is forced upon us by these official figures, that the\r\nmediæval parish clergy were scantily endowed; one would wonder how, in\r\nmany cases, with such endowments, they could live, and maintain\r\nhospitality to travellers, and help their poor, if one did not call to\r\nmind that the majority of the clergy had not a wife and family to\r\nmaintain; that the rectors were mostly of the families of the gentry, and\r\nmany of the vicars probably of the middle class, and that--then, as\r\nnow--the majority of the beneficed clergy probably had some resources of\r\ntheir own, and perhaps--then, as now--brought as much into the church of\r\ntheir own as they took out of it in their annual profits.\r\n\r\nA contemporary copy of the taxation of the Diocese of Exeter gives on the\r\nend page a summary of the tenths for the whole kingdom--\r\n\r\n                                                       £    _s._  _d._\r\n  Sum of the tenth of the Province of Canterbury    16,258   18     4\r\n  Sum of the tenth of the Province of York           4,155   10     7\r\n                                                   -------------------\r\n\r\n  Sum total of both provinces                       20,414    8    11\r\n                                                   -------------------\r\n  Which, multiplied by ten, will give the total\r\n    value taxed                                    204,144    9     2\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Oxford, “as the result of a painful calculation from the\r\n‘Taxatio,’” arrives at the following conclusion:--\r\n\r\nSpirituals, £135,665; temporals, £74,978; total, £210,644; and the\r\ntemporals of the bishops included in the total amount of temporals was\r\n£16,826.\r\n\r\nOf the number of the clergy nearly a century later we have an exact\r\nofficial return. In the year 1377 a poll-tax was levied on the whole body\r\nof the clergy of England and Wales, excepting those of the counties\r\nPalatine of Durham and Chester, of twelve-pence on “every beneficed\r\necclesiastic, exempt and not exempt, privileged and not privileged, and\r\nall abbots, priors, abbesses, prioresses, monks, canons, canonesses, and\r\nother regulars of whatever order, sex, and condition, the four orders of\r\nmendicants alone excepted;” and fourpence on “every priest, deacon,\r\nsub-deacon, accolite, and those obtaining the first tonsure exceeding the\r\nage of fourteen years.”\r\n\r\nThe total number of men given in the returns is 15,238 beneficed, and\r\n13,943 unbeneficed. If we suppose the number in the excepted counties of\r\nDurham and Chester to have been in the same proportion, we should have a\r\ntotal for the whole of England (Wales is not included in the return) of\r\nabout 15,800 beneficed, and 14,000 unbeneficed, and a total of about\r\n29,800. From the same return we gather that the whole population of the\r\ncountry at that time was about 2,065,000.[422]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE “VALOR ECCLESIASTICUS” OF HENRY VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is convenient to take into consideration here another survey of the\r\nChurch which was taken about two centuries later.\r\n\r\nWhen Crown, Parliament, and Church, in the sixteenth century, determined\r\nto throw off the patriarchal supremacy of Rome, for which its monstrous\r\npecuniary exactions in one shape and another was one prominent motive, the\r\nclergy no doubt fondly expected that they would get rid for ever of the\r\nburden of first-fruits and tenths, but found themselves grievously\r\ndisappointed. One of the political motives of the king in the complex\r\nseries of events which we sum up under the general name of the\r\nReformation, was the diminution of the power and wealth of the Church. The\r\nproperty of the monasteries, which he confiscated, the manors of the sees,\r\nwhich he compelled the bishops to surrender, did not suffice him. A\r\nsubservient Parliament, passing one Act in 1532 and another in 1534, put\r\nthe first-fruits and tenths into his hands. It was a considerable\r\naddition to the royal revenue, and the king took measures to secure the\r\nfull advantage of it. A commission was appointed to make a new survey of\r\nthe income of the Church. The commissioners by themselves and their agents\r\nwent carefully through every diocese, archdeaconry, rural deanery and\r\nparish, and required every person to state on oath what was the income\r\nwhich he derived from his benefice from every source. The returns were\r\nsent in by 1534.\r\n\r\nThe result, so far as it concerns us here, was a return of the condition\r\nof the Church at the close of the mediæval period of great historical\r\nvalue. The returns are not given with the same fulness from every diocese,\r\nbut where they are given fully they give not only the general return of\r\nthe value of each benefice, but also the names of the clergy and in\r\nseveral dioceses a schedule of the sources of their income.[423]\r\n\r\nThe first thing to which attention is naturally directed is the number of\r\nparishes, and a comparison with the number in the “Taxatio” two centuries\r\nbefore. The enumeration is not free from difficulties, but the figures\r\ngiven may be taken as approximately correct.\r\n\r\nWe make out that the totals are as follows:--Total number of parishes,\r\n8838; of vicarages, 3307; of chapels, 536; of chantries, 1733.[424]\r\n\r\nComparing these figures with those of the “Taxatio,” it will be seen that\r\nthe total number of parishes had increased very little in the interval,\r\nthough the population of the country had increased from about 2,200,000 to\r\nabout 4,350,000 souls.\r\n\r\nThis may be accounted for partly by the fact that the growth of population\r\nhad caused the creation of few new centres of population, but only the\r\nincrease of the populations of the existing centres. There were very few,\r\nif any, new towns or new parishes in the towns, but the old towns had\r\ngrown larger; there were few new rural parishes, but the villages had a\r\nlarger population; so that there was little increase in the number of\r\nparish priests, but each priest ministered to a larger flock; where new\r\ncentres of population had sprung up, their wants were supplied by a chapel\r\nand its chaplain. The increase in the means of supplying the spiritual\r\nwants of the increased population had taken the form of the employment of\r\nDomestic Chaplains and Gild Chaplains, and the foundation of Chantries,\r\nwhich we shall have to deal with in subsequent chapters.\r\n\r\nThe next question to which we turn is the income of the Church as a whole,\r\nand of the parochial benefices in particular, and a comparison in this\r\nrespect also between the “Taxatio” and the “Valor.”\r\n\r\nThe ostentation of minute accuracy on the part of the taxers is almost\r\nludicrous, the princely income of the Bishop of Lincoln is returned at\r\n£1962 17_s._ 4½_d._ In dividing a sum of money among the minor canons of\r\nthat cathedral, the accountant points out that a farthing remained over,\r\nwhich was indivisible; and in dividing the gross income of the benefices\r\nby ten, it was constantly recorded that there was a remainder of so much,\r\nwhich was “undecimable.”\r\n\r\nVery few new religious houses were founded after the thirteenth century;\r\nthe cause was not so much that the Statute of Mortmain interposed a check\r\nto the free action of pious munificence, as that there was a general\r\nrecognition that enough had been done in this direction. The two thousand\r\nchantries which had been founded in the two centuries probably did not\r\naverage £5 a year income, and did not swell the general income by so much\r\nas £10,000 a year. The parochial benefices are seen, by actual comparison\r\nof the figures, to have increased in nominal amount of income, but the\r\npurchasing value of money had decreased, so that the real value of the\r\nbenefices was probably somewhat less. The produce of the annual tenths\r\nwould seem to indicate that the income of the Church had largely\r\ndiminished, for whereas we have seen that by the “Taxatio” of 1291 it\r\namounted to £20,000, we learn, from a letter of Henry VII., to the Bishop\r\nof Chichester, that it had fallen by that time to £10,000; the Bishop of\r\nOxford[425] attributes this to the multiplication of exemptions,\r\nespecially of livings under ten marks.\r\n\r\nOne valuable feature of the “Valor” is the schedules of incomings and\r\noutgoings of the livings, and the incidental notices contained in them,\r\nwhich give glimpses of the economy of the parishes.\r\n\r\nWe give first one example, which is expressed in English, at full length,\r\nas a clue to the meaning of the more abbreviated form in which some others\r\nare given.\r\n\r\nFrom the “Valor Ecclesiasticus,” vol. vi. p. 2:--\r\n\r\n    Compotus of Wm.

We find the\r\ncustomary offerings at the four seasons and at Easter, as enjoined in\r\nSaxon times (see p. 71); only in some places, instead of the “oblationes\r\nquatuor festorum,” we find that the times had been reduced to three, as in\r\nthe rural deanery of Irchingfield, in the diocese of Hereford (“Valor,”\r\niii. p. 19), where we find “oblationes ibidem III bus temporibus anni\r\nusualibus”; or to two, as at Leeds, in the diocese of York, “oblationes\r\nduo’ dierum ibid’ consuet’.” The Easter offering was the more important;\r\nit is spoken of in various ways, “Decima privata in Festo Paschæ,” “Decimæ\r\npersonaliæ vocatæ Lenten Booke,” “Decimæ personaliæ voc’ le Estre Booke,”\r\n“In libro Paschali,” “In Rotulo Paschali,” “In Rotulo\r\nQuadragesimali,”[427] “Lent Decimæ,” and “Oblationes in Pasch’.”\r\n\r\nIn settling the vicarages these fees were usually assigned to the vicar,\r\nand in town parishes the appropriators often left the vicar very little\r\nbesides to live upon. We give a few examples taken at random in\r\nillustration of these remarks:--\r\n\r\n    The Vicarage of Leeds, a house and garden valued at 15_s._ 8_d._;\r\n    tithes of lambs and wool, £13; Lent tithes and oblations in Pasch’,\r\n    £26; oblations of two days _ibid’ consuet’_, £4 10_s._; oblations\r\n    within the church, £4 6_s._ 8_d._; oblations of a chapel of the\r\n    Blessed Virgin Mary, 3_s._ 4_d._; total, £48 15_s._ 8_d._[428]\r\n\r\n    The Vicarage of Sheffield, a house and garden valued at 10_s._; tithe\r\n    of wool and lambs, 36_s._; oblations, £6 18_s._; Easter Book, £4;\r\n    small tithe, 2_s._ 8_d._; total, £13 6_s._ 8_d._[429]\r\n\r\n    The Vicarage of Huddersfield, house and garden, 3_s._ 4_d._; tithes of\r\n    wool, 60_s._; of lambs, 64_s._; oblations, £4 11_s._ 8_d._; small and\r\n    private tithe, £9 18_s._ 0½_d._; total, £20 17_s._ 0½_d._[430]\r\n\r\n    The Church of Doncaster, at the end of the thirteenth century,[431]\r\n    was a rectory, held in two medieties; but in the course of the\r\n    following centuries both medieties had been appropriated to the Abbey\r\n    of St. Mary at York, which appointed a vicar.

Total, £21 5_s._\r\n    1_d._”[438]\r\n\r\nSome special sources of income which occur here and there are worth\r\nnotice:--\r\n\r\n    The Vicar of Leominster has the herbage of the cemeteries of the\r\n    church and chapels; the tithes of the bakers and taverners within the\r\n    borough. Mass pennies and candle oblations, and oblations for the\r\n    blessed bread on the Lord’s days.[439]\r\n\r\nThe case of Lenton, Notts, has also features of special interest. It was\r\nappropriated to the Prior of Lenton:--[440]\r\n\r\n    Richard Matthew, vicar there. Is worth for his house there, and with\r\n    an acre of land, by the year, 6_s._ 8_d._; for Easter tithes, 54_s._;\r\n    for offerings on the three days, 12_s._; for offerings at marriages,\r\n    churchings, and burials, one year with another, 5_s._; for oblations\r\n    on Sundays, 1¼_d._, amounting to 7_s._ 4_d._ a year; for a corrody of\r\n    bread and ale at the Priory of Lenton, every week 1_s._ 6_d._,\r\n    amounting to 78_s._ a year; and every day for food from the cook of\r\n    the said prior to the value of 1_d._, amounting to 30_s._ 5_d._ a\r\n    year; for tithe of wool and lambs, one year with another, 12_s._; for\r\n    pigs, geese, and fowls, 10_s._; for tithe of flax and hemp, 3_s._; for\r\n    tithe of fruits, one year with another, 12_s._; for grass and hay for\r\n    one horse, found by the said prior, 3_s._ 4_d._ a year; in the whole\r\n    £10 11_s._ 1¼_d._ Thence is paid annually to the said prior and his\r\n    successors for a certain pension, 28_s._ 8_d._ And there remains £9\r\n    2_s._ 6¼_d._\r\n\r\nWe began with a return from a curate in sole charge of the parish of an\r\nabsentee rector. Here is the case of a non-resident rector who lets his\r\nbenefice to farm:--\r\n\r\n    Tunstall, Kent. The certificate of Sir Symon Jenyns, parson there,\r\n    made by Symon Spacherst, his farmer:--\r\n\r\n    First, the same Symon Spacherst payeth to the said parson yearly £8.\r\n    Item paid to the priest for his wages, £6 13_s._ 4_d._, making £14\r\n    13_s._ 4_d._ Whereof deducted for proxies[441] yearly 5_s._, leaving\r\n    clear annual value, £14 8_s._ 4_d._\r\n\r\nWe take up now the question which was postponed from the preceding\r\nchapter, of the value of money at various periods during the Middle Ages\r\ncompared with its value in our times, and especially at the period of the\r\n“Taxatio,” A.D. 1292, and at the period of the “Valor,” A.D. 1534. The\r\ncomparative value of a given income at the two periods depends upon two\r\nthings: first, upon the purchasing power of a pound at the end of the\r\nthirteenth century, and again at the middle of the sixteenth century\r\ncompared with the present day; and, second, upon the style of living at\r\nthe several periods.\r\n\r\nFirst, as to the comparative purchasing power, it is not an easy question\r\nto determine. The late Mr. Thorold Rogers has given an immense mass of\r\ndata[442] for its determination, but he has not conferred upon students\r\nthe advantage of a table of comparative values for certain dates. In\r\ndefault of this, we fall back upon other conclusions drawn from similar\r\ncollections of materials. Hallam, in his “History of Europe,” arrives at\r\nthe conclusion that “we can hardly take a less multiple than about thirty\r\nfor animal food, and eighteen or twenty for corn, in order to bring the\r\nprices of the thirteenth century to a level with those of the present\r\nday. Combining the two, and setting the comparative dearness of cloth\r\nagainst the cheapness of fuel and many other articles, we may perhaps\r\nconsider any given sum under Henry III. and Edward I. as equivalent in\r\ngeneral command over commodities to about twenty-four or twenty-five times\r\nits normal value at present;” and again, “In the time of Edward I., an\r\nincome of £10 or £20 a year was reckoned a competent estate for a\r\ngentleman; at least the lord of a single manor would seldom have enjoyed\r\nmore.” The same writer says, “Sixteen will be a proper multiple, when we\r\nwould bring the general standard value of money in the reign of Henry VI.\r\nto our present standard.” Dean Milman, speaking of payments in 1344, says,\r\nwithout giving reason or quoting authority, “Multiply by fifteen to bring\r\nto present value.”[443] Froude says, “A penny in terms of the labourer’s\r\nnecessities must have been equal in the reign of Henry VIII. to the\r\npresent shilling;” and adopts “the relative estimate of twelve to one,” as\r\ngenerally representing the comparative value of money at that period. The\r\nRev. Dr. Cunningham, formerly professor of Economic Science, K.C.L.,\r\nkindly replying to a question on the subject, says, “For 1535, I should\r\nsay that a penny was worth at least a shilling in the present day. I could\r\nnot give a guess of any value as to the change between 1291 and 1535. At\r\nthe former date I fancy the values were estimates, and that the actual\r\nreceipts were chiefly in kind.” We have ventured to take, as approximate\r\nmultiples, twelve times for the date of the “Taxatio” (A.D. 1291), and\r\ntwenty-four times for the “Valor” (A.D. 1535).\r\n\r\nBut the comparative position of the parochial clergy, as of all other\r\nclasses of society, at these two periods, and at the present day, depends\r\nnot only on the amount of money which they received yearly, and on the\r\nquantity of things which it would purchase, but also on the style of\r\nliving at the periods compared. In those times the houses of the smaller\r\ngentry were rudely but substantially built of timber, and did not involve\r\nfrequent repairs. A little carving on the roof timbers of the hall--the\r\none living room--was a permanent decoration, which never needed renewing;\r\na high table of oak, with a great chair for the master, boards and\r\ntrestles for the other tables, benches to sit upon, and a few stools, were\r\nthe sufficient furniture; a little tapestry on the walls, a few bankers\r\n(cushions on the benches), made quite a luxurious furnishing; and green\r\nrushes strewed upon the floor supplied the place of carpets. The furniture\r\nof the rest of the house was rude and substantial. Clothing, among all the\r\nmiddle classes, was durable, and was worn for years; one or two better\r\ngarments, worn only on great occasions, lasted for a lifetime. The whole\r\nmode of life of the middle classes was simple and homely to a degree which\r\nwe can hardly believe. They were early to rise, and lived an outdoor life,\r\nthe labouring men in field-work, the farmers not only overlooking the\r\nwork, but putting their hands to it; the squires looking sharply after\r\ntheir own estates, and spending their leisure in field sports. The food\r\nwas simple but abundant; air and exercise gave hearty appetites for homely\r\nfare, and early to bed saved light and firing.\r\n\r\nThe result was that a much smaller income enabled a man to hold his\r\nposition in society.[444] In 1253, Henry III. issued an edict that whoever\r\nhad estates of £15 yearly value should be made knights.[445] In the second\r\nyear of Henry V. (1415), an Act of Parliament fixed £20 a-year as the\r\nincome which qualified a man to be a Justice of the Peace.\r\n\r\nA country rector, therefore, could hold his position in relation to his\r\nfarmers, and his squire, and his country neighbours, on an income which\r\nseems to us wonderfully small; and the vicar and parish chaplain with £5\r\na-year did not seem to his neighbours of any degree to be in a condition\r\nof degrading poverty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC CHAPELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Byzantine emperors first set up a private chapel in their houses;\r\nkings followed their example, and the nobles followed the example of their\r\nkings; and there was a danger of the clergy of these chapels, supported by\r\ntheir lords, making themselves independent of the oversight of the\r\nbishops, and of the worship of the rich being separated from the worship\r\nof the poor.[446] In 692, the second Trullan Council decreed that no\r\nclergyman should perform the rite of baptism or celebrate the Eucharist in\r\nsuch a chapel without the bishop’s permission. Gregory the Great gives\r\nlicence for the consecration of an oratory which Firmilian, a notary, has\r\nbuilt on his farm outside the city of Fermo, on condition that there shall\r\nnot be a baptistery or _cardinalem presbyterum_, a titled parish\r\npriest.[447] The Council of Clermont, 535, decreed that on Sundays and\r\nfestivals all should come to church, and not invite priests to their\r\nhouses to say mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Conisborough Castle. 10. The Chapel.]\r\n\r\nThe great Saxon nobles had chapels in their houses and private chaplains.\r\nTheir chaplains are sometimes named in their wills, _e.g._ Queen\r\nEthelfleda, c. 972, leaves “4 hides of land to her reeve, 2 to her page,\r\nand 2 to each of her priests.” Lotgiva gives legacies “to Ailric my\r\nhousehold priest, and to Ailric my page.”[448] Some of them Roger of\r\nWendover accuses of hearing in bed the daily mass said by their\r\nchaplains.[449] With the Norman nobles the custom was universal; of the\r\nnumerous castles of the Norman period which remain to us, we do not call\r\nto mind one which has not a chapel in the keep-tower. They differ in size,\r\nfrom an oratory contained within the thickness of the wall, as at\r\nConisboro’ and at Brougham, to a church forming a prominent feature of the\r\nplan and elevation, as at the White Tower, London, and at Colchester.\r\n\r\nThe chapel in the White Tower is the largest of the series. It is situated\r\non the principal (first) floor, and under it on the ground floor is a\r\nkind of crypt. It has a nave with aisles, and a chancel with circular\r\napse. Gundulph of Rochester, who was its architect, gave great importance\r\nto the chapel by projecting its round apse beyond the line of the east\r\nwall like a great semicircular bastion, the only break in the massive\r\nquadrangular plan. The keep of Colchester Castle, no doubt by the same\r\narchitect, is exactly on the same plan, only that the chapel is without\r\naisles.\r\n\r\nIn the keeps of Rochester, Newcastle, Hedingham, Middleham, and others, a\r\ncommodious chapel, with handsome ornamentation of zigzag arch mouldings\r\nand vaulted roof, is contained in the annex to the keep, which defends the\r\ngreat stone stair leading to the principal floor. It is very probable that\r\nwhere the keep had only a small oratory there was always a larger chapel\r\nin the castle bailey[450] for the general inhabitants of the castle, for\r\nin later times we commonly find an oratory for the lord and another for\r\nthe lady, and a chapel besides.\r\n\r\nIn the Edwardian castles, the chapel is a constant feature. Conway affords\r\na good example; there it is on the south side of the outer court, and the\r\nchaplain’s room is in the adjoining tower. There are also, in the inner\r\ncourt adjoining the state apartments, two small elegant oratories, one\r\ncalled the king’s and the other the queen’s. There are other examples at\r\nBeaumaris, Kidwelly, etc. Usually a small vestry and a priest’s chamber\r\ncommunicate directly with the chapel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARRIAGE OF COUNT WALERAN DE ST. POL WITH THE SISTER OF\r\nRICHARD, KING OF ENGLAND. ROYAL 14, E. IV., f. 30.]\r\n\r\nIn the great houses of the nobles down to the end of the mediæval period,\r\nthe chapel is as universal a feature as the hall or the great\r\nchamber.[451] The chapels at Ightham Mote, Kent; at Bodiam, Sussex; at the\r\nVyne, Hampshire; and at Wolsey’s Palace at Hampton Court, are fine\r\nexamples. The still perfect chapel of Haddon Hall is in all respects like\r\nan ordinary village church, with font and pulpit. The College Chapels of\r\nOxford and Cambridge, of Eton and Winchester, and of all the other\r\nmediæval colleges and schools, the chapels of the Episcopal Palaces at\r\nWinchester, Farnham, Lambeth, etc., are all normal examples of the\r\narchitectural features and furniture of the domestic chapels, and their\r\nservices are examples of the manners and customs of the chapel services of\r\nthe greater mediæval houses.\r\n\r\nThe western end of the chapel is sometimes divided into two stories, both\r\nopening upon the sacrarium; the upper story was usually intended for the\r\nfamily, and the lower for the domestics. Sometimes the chapel on the\r\nprincipal floor has, besides its internal approaches, an external stone\r\nstair by which people from other parts of the house could enter the chapel\r\nwithout passing through the house, as at the fourteenth-century houses of\r\nInceworth (?) and Earth, both in Cornwall.\r\n\r\nThe principal residence of a great noble needed a chapel of considerable\r\nsize to accommodate the number of people, as numerous as the population of\r\na country parish or a small town, who were gathered into the castle during\r\nthe residence of its lord:--the lord’s household of knights and squires,\r\nyeomen and pages; his lady’s separate household of ladies, bower-women,\r\nand women in various kinds of service; the garrison of the castle, with\r\nits commanders of knightly degree, their squires, men-at-arms, yeomen, and\r\ngrooms; the several staffs which looked after the various departments of\r\nthe service, the chambers, kitchens, stables, kennels, and mews; besides a\r\nconstant flow of visitors, with their complex trains of guards and\r\nattendants.\r\n\r\nIn England only the chief royal houses have maintained the mediæval\r\ndignity of their ecclesiastical domestic establishments. Windsor Castle,\r\nbesides its oratory, has its noble chapel dedicated to St. George the\r\nPatron Saint of England,[452] and its establishment of dean and canons,\r\nsinging men and boys, housed in a picturesque group of collegiate\r\nbuildings arranged round several cloistered courts. The Tower of London,\r\nbesides its chapel in the White Tower, has its church of St. Peter ad\r\nVincula in the courtyard.\r\n\r\nMany of the great nobles, who maintained a state little inferior to that\r\nof royalty, had their chapel establishment of proportionate dignity. In\r\nthe opinion of that time, a man of great rank and estate owed it to the\r\nglory of God that the worship of his household should be offered with\r\ncircumstances of solemn splendour; he owed it to the well-being of the\r\nnumerous people who depended upon him; and to the still more numerous\r\npeople of all estates, who looked to him for an example.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Buckingham’s house at Thornbury had a chaplain, eighteen\r\nclerks of the chapel, and nine boys.[453]\r\n\r\nThe household book of Henry Algernon, the fifth Earl of Northumberland,\r\nwho was born in 1477, and died in 1527, gives us very full details of the\r\norganization of the chapel staff of a great nobleman, their duties, and\r\ntheir emoluments in money and kind. They consisted of a dean, who was to\r\nbe a D.D., or LL.D., or B.D., and ten other priests, eleven gentlemen, and\r\nsix children who composed the choir.[454] The secular duties which were\r\nassigned to some of them will perhaps be better understood by a reference\r\nto the past. The clergy had always been the advisers of the English kings\r\nand nobles in the ordinary affairs of life: the Archbishop of Canterbury\r\nwas the king’s official chief counsellor till long after the Norman\r\nConquest. Every ealdorman and great thane probably had a learned clerk in\r\nhis house, not only as a chaplain, but as an adviser in general affairs.\r\nHenry II. organized his domestic religious establishment into a Department\r\nof State, and used Churchmen in the civil administration as ministers,\r\nambassadors, and judges--there were none others so capable. The nobles\r\nwere following on the same lines, when they made one chaplain steward,\r\nanother secretary, and another tutor, in addition to their not burdensome\r\nduties in the maintenance of Divine worship. So the people resorted to\r\ntheir parish priest to advise them in their domestic difficulties and\r\nextraordinary matters of business, to arbitrate in their differences, and\r\nmake their wills, for the simple natural reason of his wider knowledge of\r\naffairs, his greater experience of mankind, his disinterestedness, and,\r\nnot least, his sacred character.\r\n\r\nIn the castles of less noble and wealthy persons it is not uncommon to\r\nfind that there were several chaplains organized into a college of secular\r\npriests, as at Colchester, Exeter, Hastings, Pontefract, etc., and not\r\ninfrequently endowed out of the rectories in the lord’s gift. In some\r\ninstances the lord of numerous estates endowed the chapel of his principal\r\ncastle with the churches upon all his estates, as at Colchester,\r\nClitheroe, etc. The intention probably was not so much to enrich the\r\nchaplain or form an endowment for the collegiate staff of the chapel, as\r\nto make the castle chapel the mother church of the village churches on the\r\nsurrounding estates; just as the seneschal of the castle was the superior\r\nofficer of the bailiffs of the various manors; and so to concentrate the\r\necclesiastical administration of all the estates, as well as their civil\r\nadministration, under the eye of the lord and his most trusted agents.\r\n\r\nSometimes, on the other hand, the lord gave the service of the castle\r\nchapel into the hands of some neighbouring monastery (probably of his own\r\nfounding), as at Colchester to the Abbey of St. John, at Brecon to the\r\nPriory of Brecon. When Robert de Haia, in 1120, founded the Priory of\r\nBoxgrove, Sussex, he stipulated that he should choose one of the canons to\r\nofficiate in the chapel of his neighbouring manor house of Holnaker. So\r\nSir Ralph de Eccleshall, _temp._ Edward I., gave his mill, etc., to the\r\nmonks of Beauchief, who covenanted in return to find him a priest for his\r\nchapel at Eccleshall. They stipulated, however, that in floods or snow\r\nthey shall be excused from sending one of their canons to Eccleshall, but\r\nmay say the due masses in their own church at Beauchief. So the chapel of\r\nthe De Lovelot’s castle at Sheffield was served by the canons of their\r\nPriory of Worksop.\r\n\r\nThe Collegiate Church of St. George within the royal castle of Windsor\r\nhad, and still has, an establishment consisting of a dean, twelve canons,\r\neight minor canons, eight vicars choral, and eight chorister boys.[455]\r\nThe Chapel of Wallingford Castle[456] was served by a dean, five\r\nprebendaries, and a deacon. Tickhill had four prebendaries;[457] three was\r\na common number, as at Exeter, etc.; Pontefract had two. The chapel of\r\nBridgenorth Castle had a college of secular priests, and in later times\r\nserved as a parish church to the people of the borough. The castle chapels\r\nat Nottingham and Skipton were rectories. The Castle Chapel at Kirby\r\nRavensworth had a chantry of two priests.\r\n\r\nThe chapels of Skipton, Tutbury, and Stafford Castles are called “free\r\nchapels.” Of Skipton Castle Chapel certain liberties and duties of the\r\nparson or chaplain were written in two mass-books, one new, the other old,\r\nin one of which the earl granted that the said chaplain should have meat\r\nand drink sufficient within the hall of the lord of the castle for him and\r\none garçon[458] with him. And if the lord be absent, and no house kept, he\r\nand his successors shall have for every ten weeks one quarter of wheat and\r\nvi_s._ viii_d._; and vi_d._ in money and one robe or gown yerely at ye\r\nNativity of o’r Lord, or xiii_s._ iv_d._ in monie. An inquisition of\r\nEdward III. adds as part of the endowment one _cameram fenestratam_ (a\r\nchamber with a window) and pasture for viii oxen, vi cows, and two horses,\r\nand sufficient timber for repairing his house and chamber, and dry wood\r\nfor firing. At the dissolution of chantries and free chapels, it became a\r\nquestion whether this was not a parsonage.[459] In other cases, the\r\nchaplain had a definite endowment, which seems to have been calculated\r\nupon the not very large income of a parish chaplain. The four chaplains of\r\nTickhill were endowed with £5 each; the chaplain of Nottingham Castle with\r\n£5; the chaplain at Pleshey Castle, Essex, with £5;[460] the chaplain at\r\nDenbeigh with £8, the foundation of the king; at Southampton with £10,\r\npayable by Royal Letters out of the customs of that port. Probably in many\r\ncases there was no endowment; the chapel was practically a “free chapel,”\r\nand the emoluments such as were agreed upon between the patron and his\r\nnominee; these would naturally tend to become a customary payment and\r\nperquisites; the Skipton agreement gives an instance of what was probably\r\ncustomary: viz. a corrody for himself and a boy, and a small sum in money.\r\n\r\nThe priest of the Chapel of Skelton Castle, Yorkshire, was, at the time of\r\nthe Suppression, only partly paid by Lady Conyers, 23_s._; and his stipend\r\nwas made up of payments from half a dozen other persons, from the 18_s._\r\nof R. Robinson, down to the 3_s._ 10_d._ of John Gyll, making a total of\r\n£4 2_s._ 10_d._[461]\r\n\r\nThe domestic chapels of the nobility and great men were always\r\nconsecrated, and had a perpetual licence for Divine service.\r\n\r\nVery probably, where there were several chaplains, they all served their\r\nlord in various clerkly capacities. So Piers Plowman:--\r\n\r\n  Somme serven the Kyng, and the silver tellen\r\n  In chequer and chauncerie, challengen his dettes\r\n  Of wardes, and of wardemotes, weyes and theyves;\r\n  And some serven as servants lordes and ladies,\r\n  And in stede of stewardes sitten and demen.\r\n\r\nThe domestic chaplain is frequently named in wills as a witness or an\r\nexecutor, and not infrequently as a legatee; _e.g._ Giles de Gadlesmere,\r\nknight, 1337, leaves to Wm. Ocham, clerk, 100 shillings, unless he be\r\npromoted before my death; Wm. de Ocham is one of the witnesses to the\r\nwill.[462]\r\n\r\nWe find in the “Valor Eccl.” a considerable number of chantries recorded\r\nas founded in the chapels of castles. There is doubt in some cases whether\r\nthese were the ordinary endowments of the chaplain, made under the name of\r\na Chantry, for reasons of legal convenience, or whether, in addition to\r\nthe ordinary chaplain, a special endowment had been made for mortuary\r\nmasses, and, if so, whether the ordinary chaplain was also the Cantarist\r\nand received the chantry endowment in addition to his normal stipend. The\r\nchaplain celebrating in the chapel of the Castle of Downhead received from\r\nthe grant of King Stephen £5 a year, and chaplain for celebrating mass\r\ntwice every week at Penhill, for the soul of the founder, £2 13_s._\r\n4_d._[463] There were chantries in the chapels of the castles of Chester,\r\nSherifhoton, Pickering, Malton, Pontefract, Penrith, Sandall, Skelton,\r\nWhorleton, Kermerdenin in Wales, Durham, Barnard Castle, Tutbury,\r\nStafford, Wilton, Norham, Alnwick, etc. The lord of Bridgenorth Castle\r\narranged with the Dean and Canons of Windsor to supply a priest to\r\ncelebrate three days a week for the founder and King John.\r\n\r\nAny one might build an oratory in his house,[464] but Divine service, that\r\nis the Holy Communion, might not be celebrated in it without the bishop’s\r\npermission. Towards the close of the thirteenth century, the lesser gentry\r\nbegan to include a chapel in the plan of their manor houses, and the\r\ncustom seems to have become almost universal in the following centuries.\r\nWe may take it as an indication of a growing desire to maintain the\r\nregular daily practice of religious worship in a seemly solemn way for\r\ntheir families and households.\r\n\r\nIn the valuable digest of the Exeter Registers, for which historical\r\nstudents are much indebted to Canon Hingeston-Randolph, the licences\r\nissued during the twenty-four years of Edmund Stafford’s Episcopacy\r\n(1395-1419) are arranged under the family names of the persons to whom\r\nthey were granted, and there are two hundred and seventy-two names. In\r\nmany cases the licence extends to all their mansions and manors in the\r\nDiocese of Exeter; which gives a rough estimate of about three hundred\r\ndomestic chapels in the manor houses of the two counties of Devon and\r\nCornwall; if we multiply that figure by twenty-six, we get a rough\r\nestimate of over seven thousand domestic chapels in England and Wales.\r\n\r\nAll these domestic chapels, except those of royal houses[465] and of some\r\nfree chapels, were under the jurisdiction of the bishop, and a constant\r\nand perhaps jealous oversight was maintained lest they should detract from\r\nthe general assembly of all the parishioners for united worship in the\r\nparish church, or interfere with the pastoral position and rights of the\r\nrectors of the parishes. People with interest at Rome sometimes obtain\r\ntheir licence direct from the pope. There is an example of the king’s\r\nambassador obtaining a batch of them in 1343, but they are granted with\r\nstrict limitations.\r\n\r\nAmong the Constitutions of Archbishop Stratford, made at the Council of\r\nLondon (1342), is one which even restricts the power of the bishops to\r\ngrant licences: it decrees that “all licences granted by the bishops for\r\ncelebrating mass in places not consecrated other than to noble men and\r\ngreat men of the realm, and to persons living at a considerable distance\r\nfrom the church, or notoriously weak or infirm, shall be void.” The decree\r\ngoes on to say that “whosoever, against the prohibition of the canon,\r\nshall celebrate mass in oratories, chapels, houses, or other places, not\r\nconsecrated, without having obtained the licence of the diocesan, shall be\r\nsuspended from the celebration of Divine service for the space of a\r\nmonth.”[466]\r\n\r\n    Robert Fitz Aer, the second of the name (c. 1190-1195), gave to the\r\n    Convent of Haughmond certain lands on condition that they would have\r\n    Divine service performed in his Chapel of Withyford three days a week,\r\n    when he or his wife or their heirs were resident in the manor. All\r\n    festivals were excluded from the agreement, and the parishioners were\r\n    not to attend these services to the injury of the mother church.[467]\r\n\r\nHere is an early example of the foundation of a domestic chapel under the\r\nguise of a chantry:--\r\n\r\n    Sir G. de Breaute, in right of Joane his wife, had liberty given him\r\n    by Robert Dean of St. Paul’s, with the consent of Walter Niger, Vicar\r\n    of Navestock, Essex, to found a chapel and chantry in his court at\r\n    Navestock, provided he and his heirs maintained a chaplain at his own\r\n    charge, sworn to preserve the liberty of the mother church, and to pay\r\n    the vicar all the profits he should receive there, and admit none of\r\n    the parishioners to confession or other offices there under pain of\r\n    being suspended by the vicar. The founder also and the heirs of the\r\n    said Joane his wife, and whoever else had the said chapel in his\r\n    lordship, were also to be sworn to preserve the rights of the mother\r\n    church under like pain. In which chapel the chaplain was to administer\r\n    the mass only with Bread and Holy Water, forbearing all other holy\r\n    offices, saving that at Easter the founder and his wife and heirs,\r\n    together with his free servants and guests, were to be admitted to the\r\n    sacrament of the altar; but all his servants were to go to the mother\r\n    church throughout the year.[468] And for this grant the founder and\r\n    his wife and heirs were to give to the mother church two wax candles,\r\n    each weighing a pound, to be offered, one at the Purification, the\r\n    other at the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, before\r\n    vespers.[469]\r\n\r\nAnother similar example is the chapel at the Vyne, Hampshire.\r\n\r\n    In the twelfth century, Robert, Dean of Sherburn, granted to William\r\n    FitzAdam and his heirs to build a chapel in the parish of St. Andrew,\r\n    Sherborne, for the use of himself, his wife, and his household. The\r\n    said Robert to provide the chaplain, who shall eat at William’s table,\r\n    and receive a stipend for his services from Robert; saving the rights\r\n    of the mother church; and William FitzAdam and his wife to attend\r\n    worship, and receive communion at the parish church on Christmas,\r\n    Easter, Purification, Whitsunday, and St. Andrew’s Day.\r\n\r\nThe present chapel at the Vyne is a late perpendicular building, in a\r\nperfect state of repair; with its ancient screens and stalls. It has an\r\nanti-chapel over which was my lord’s oratory; the two chambers for the\r\nchaplain on the south side have been converted into mortuary chapels of\r\nthe time of Charles II.[470]\r\n\r\nFrom the time that the Bishop’s Registers began, _i.e._ from the close of\r\nthe thirteenth century, down to the time of the Reformation, they abound\r\nin entries of the granting of licences for oratories in private houses.\r\nThey run in a customary form,[471] setting forth that the licence is given\r\nto a particular person by name, his wife and children, servants, and\r\nguests, to have Divine offices said in the oratory of his house of\r\nso-and-so; there is usually a clause that on Sundays and other festivals,\r\nthey shall go to their parish church, there to hear the Divine service;\r\nand a further clause requiring that all fees and offerings shall be paid\r\nto the priest. A licence was not given once for all; very much to the\r\ncontrary. Sometimes it was given during the pleasure of the bishop;\r\nsometimes for one year; for two years; for three years; renewable from\r\ntime to time; sometimes for the period of the grantee’s life. In the\r\nEpiscopal Registers of Exeter, a number of licences are registered to the\r\nfamily of Bottreaux, which, when put together, give a glimpse of family\r\nhistory, and illustrate the principles on which the licences were granted.\r\nLicence to hold service in the chapel of St. Mary Magdalen, at Boswithguy\r\n(the oratories are frequently named under the invocation of some saint),\r\nappears in the second year of Bishop Stafford’s Register, 1396, to\r\nElizabeth Bottreaux; and is renewed in 1398. In 1399, a general licence is\r\ngiven to William, son of Sir William Bottreaux, Knight, and to Sir Ralph\r\nBottreaux, Knight, and to John and Anna, children of the said Sir William.\r\nAgain, in 1410, a general licence is given to William, “lord of\r\nBottreaux,” his wife, and their sons and daughters. We conjecture that\r\nthis William died in the following year, and was succeeded by his son\r\nJohn, for again, in 1411, a licence is given to John Bottreaux, and\r\nElizabeth his wife, for all their manors and mansions in the diocese.[472]\r\n\r\nSometimes, perhaps it was when the manor house was at very inconvenient\r\ndistance from the parish church, the licence was given “omissa clausula\r\nVolumus, etc.,” _i.e._ without the restricting clause about Sundays and\r\nother festivals.\r\n\r\nThe Registry of Archbishop Walter Gray records grants in 1229 to Alberic\r\nde Percy, to have a chaplain to celebrate Divine offices in the chapel of\r\nSutton so long as he lives; to Alexander de Vilers and his heirs to have\r\nDivine offices in his chapel of Newbottle for his family and guests for\r\never;[473] to Robert le Vavasour and his heirs, at his chapel of\r\nHindishal; in 1254, to S. de Heddon and his heirs in the chapel of his\r\ncourt of Headdon.[474]\r\n\r\nIn 1343, Thomas de Peckam obtained a bull from Pope Alexander, licensing\r\nhim, since in winter he cannot get to his parish church because of the\r\nfloods, that he may have Divine service in his chapel at Wyke.[475]\r\n\r\nTemporary licences were sometimes granted in special cases of temporary\r\nsickness or chronic infirmity; Bishop Stapledon, in 1312, permits Dame\r\nIsabella de Fishacre to have Divine service at home, not only on week days\r\nbut also on festivals when, through the inclemency of the weather or\r\nbodily infirmity, she cannot conveniently attend the parish church. In\r\n1317, in consideration of Sir Peter Fishacre’s impotency, he is allowed to\r\nhave Divine service celebrated in his own chamber in his house of Lupton.\r\nIn 1310, Oliver de Halap, who is broken with age, and has lost the sight\r\nof his eyes, _senio fractus et luminibus occulorum privatus_, is\r\ncompassionately allowed by the same considerate bishop to have Divine\r\nservice celebrated in his manor house of Hertleghe.\r\n\r\nThe custom of having a domestic chaplain extended, in the latter part of\r\nthe period with which we have to do, not only to the majority of the\r\ncountry gentry, but to wealthy yeomen and well-to-do citizens. Mere\r\ncountry gentlemen sometimes maintained a considerable chapel\r\nestablishment. Henry Machyn, in his diary,[476] says, in noticing the\r\ndeath, in 1552, of Sir Thomas Jarmyn, of Rushbrook Hall, that “he was the\r\nbest housekeeper in the county of Suffolk, and kept a goodly chapel of\r\nsinging men.”\r\n\r\nRichard Burre, a wealthy yeoman and farmer of the parsonage of Souwntyng,\r\nin 1529, directs in his will that “Sir Robert Beckton,” my chaplain, syng\r\nffor my sowle by the space of ix. yers.[477]\r\n\r\nWhen Alderman Monmouth took Tyndale into his house, and “did promys him x\r\npounds sterling to praye for his father, mother, their soules and all\r\nchristen soules,”[478] he clearly engaged that greatest of the translators\r\nof the Bible as his domestic chaplain. It was very natural, and no doubt\r\nusual, that special services for the deceased members of the family should\r\nbe celebrated in the chapel of the house, and by the chaplain of the\r\nfamily. Not infrequently a chantry was founded in domestic chapels; _e.g._\r\n“Thomas de Ross, lord of Hamelak and Belvoir, 1412, leaves 400{li} for ten\r\nchaplains to say mass, etc., in his chapel of Belvoir for eight\r\nyears.”[479]\r\n\r\nSome further examples of it will be found in the chapter on chantries and\r\nchantry-priests.\r\n\r\nMr. Christopher Pickering, in his will, dated 1542, leaves “to my sarvands\r\nJohn Dobson and Frances, xx_s._ a-piece, besydes ther wages; allso I give\r\nunto Sir James Edwarde, my sarvand,” etc.[480] One of the witnesses to the\r\nwill is “Sir James Edwarde, preste,” so that the person whom Mr. Pickering\r\ndescribes as his servant seems to have been his domestic chaplain. Sir\r\nThomas More says “every man has a priest to wait upon his wife;” so\r\nNicholas Blackburn, a wealthy citizen of York, and twice Lord Mayor,\r\nleaves in 1431-2 a special bequest to his wife, “to find her a\r\ngentlewoman, and a priest, and a servant.”[481]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the lord of the house usually selected his own chaplain,\r\nand made his own arrangements with him on the subject of remuneration,\r\nwhich most likely consisted of his lodging in the chaplain’s chamber and\r\nhis board at the lord’s table, and a fixed sum of money, as at Skipton.\r\nBut there were cases in which the chaplain was nominated by some outside\r\nauthority, as the rector or vicar of the parish, as in the case of the\r\nVyne, as if to lessen the likelihood of friction between the parish priest\r\nand the chaplain of the manor house.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe frequent occurrence of licences to solemnize the marriage of specified\r\npersons in the chapel of the bride’s home shows that then, as now, a\r\nspecial licence was required for such occasions.\r\n\r\n    7 Sep., 1363. Licence for a marriage between Sir Andrew Lutterel,\r\n    Knt., and Hawise Despencer, to be solemnized by Thos. Abbot of Bourne\r\n    and the Vicar of Bourne, in the chapel of Lady Blanche Wake of Lidell,\r\n    within her castle of Bourne.[482]\r\n\r\n    4 Aug., 1417. Licence to Eliz. de Beaumont, for marriage between Wm.\r\n    Lord Deyncourt and Elizabeth, daughter of the said Elizabeth, to be\r\n    celebrated in the chapel of Beaumanoir, in the parish of Barowe.[483]\r\n\r\n    1457. Henry, son of Humphrey Duke of Buckingham, was licensed, by the\r\n    Bishop of Lichfield, to be married in the chapel of Maxstoke Castle to\r\n    his cousin Margaret, Countess of Richmond.[484]\r\n\r\n    A licence to solemnize a marriage in the chapel of the manor house of\r\n    Homesid House, Durham, was given in 1500, on account of bad weather\r\n    and the infirmity of the parents of the bride.[485]\r\n\r\nIn the following case a license was not asked for, because the marriage\r\nwas uncanonical:--\r\n\r\n    In 1434, process was issued against Thomas Grene of Norton by\r\n    Toucester, Knight, for clandestine marriage with Marnia Belers,\r\n    _co’matre sue_ (co-sponsors), in the private chapel within the house\r\n    of Ric. Knyghtley at Ffarvesley, in the presence of Ric. Knyghtley and\r\n    his son and other witnesses.[486]\r\n\r\nThe clergy[487] sometimes had a domestic chapel in their houses, but even\r\nthey were carefully restricted as to the when, and where, and how they\r\nmight celebrate the Divine service in them.\r\n\r\n    In the life of J. de Grandisson, Bishop of Exeter, 1327, we read that\r\n    in the earlier part of his career, while still Archdeacon of\r\n    Nottingham, in 1326, he was sent as nuncio by the pope into France and\r\n    England. He writes to the pope that he is so overwhelmed with business\r\n    that he prays for leave for himself and his people to have mass said\r\n    before daylight. The pope grants it, but desires that the permission\r\n    be rarely used, because since the Son of God _qui candor est lucis\r\n    æternæ_ is immolated in the service of the mass, such a sacrament\r\n    ought not to be celebrated in the darkness, but in the light.[488]\r\n\r\n    In the register of Bishop Grandisson, in 1328, is the record of a\r\n    licence, only “during pleasure,” to the Rector of Southpole (?), for\r\n    an oratory _infra mansum rectoriæ tuæ_.[489]\r\n\r\n    1404. Licence to the Rector of Wodemancote to have service in his\r\n    house for one year, on account of infirmity.[490]\r\n\r\nThese domestic chapels were thoroughly furnished with every usual ornament\r\nand appliance in a style of sumptuousness proportionate to the rank and\r\nmeans of the master of the house. From the Household Book of the Earl of\r\nNorthumberland we gather that his chapel had three altars, and that my\r\nlord and my lady had each a closet, _i.e._ an oratory, in which were\r\nother altars. The chapel was furnished with hangings, and had a pair of\r\norgans. The service books were so famous for their beauty that, on the\r\nearl’s death, Cardinal Wolsey intimated his wish to have them. There is\r\nmention, too, of suits of vestments, and single vestments, copes and\r\nsurplices, and altar cloths for the five altars. All these things were\r\nunder the care of the yeoman of the vestry, and were carried about with\r\nthe earl at his removals from one to another of his houses.\r\n\r\nCatalogues of the furniture of the smaller domestic chapels are numerous\r\nin the inventories attached to ancient wills; two may be given here as\r\nexamples--\r\n\r\n    Lady Alice West, of Hinton Marcel, Hants, 1395, bequeaths to her son\r\n    Thomas, “a pair of matins bookes and a pair of bedas,” and to her\r\n    daughter Iohane, a masse book and all the books that I have of Latin,\r\n    English, and French, out-take the foresaid mattins books bequeathed to\r\n    Thomas. Also all my vestments of my chappel with the towels belonging\r\n    to the altar, and my tapites white and red paled,[491] and blue and\r\n    red paled, with all my green tapites that belong to my chappel\r\n    aforesaid, and with the frontals of the aforesaid altar, and with all\r\n    the curtains and trussing coffers, and all other apparele that belong\r\n    to my chapel. Also a chalice and paxbrede and holy-water pot with the\r\n    sprinklers; two cruets, two chandeliers, two silver basins for the\r\n    altar with scutcheons of my ancestors’ arms, and a sacring bell, and\r\n    all of silver. Also a table depainted of three (a triptych).[492]\r\n\r\nIn the inventories of the will of John Smith, Esq., of Blackmore, Essex,\r\nin 1543--\r\n\r\n    In the chapel chamber, a long setle joyned. In the chapel, one aulter\r\n    of joyner’s work. Item, a table with two leaves of the passion gilt [a\r\n    panelled diptych]. Item, a long setle of wainscott. Item, a bell\r\n    hanging over the chapel. Chapel stuff, copes and vestments three.\r\n    Aulter fronts four, corporal case one, and dyvers peces of silk\r\n    necessary for cusshyons v.\r\n\r\nThe altar vessels are not specially mentioned; they were probably included\r\nwith the other silver, and the altar candlesticks among the “xiiiij latyn\r\ncandlestics of dyvers sorts,” mentioned elsewhere.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a very pleasant feature in the daily life of the manor house of\r\nmediæval England which is brought home to us by these studies of ancient\r\ndomestic architecture and these dry extracts from Episcopal Registers. By\r\nthe latter part of the fourteenth century it would seem that nearly every\r\nmanor house had a chapel, and a resident chaplain. Divine services--Matins\r\nand mass before breakfast, and evensong before dinner--were said every\r\nday; and when the solemn worship of Almighty God held so conspicuous a\r\nplace in the daily family life, it is not possible that it should not have\r\nexercised an influence upon the character and habits of the people; for\r\nthe family and household really attended the service as a part of the\r\nroutine of daily duty. There are numerous incidental allusions in the\r\ncourse of historical narratives which prove it. Robert of Gloucester says\r\nof William the Conqueror--\r\n\r\n  In church he was devout enow, for him none day abide\r\n  That he heard not Mass and Matins, and Evensong and each tide.\r\n\r\nThe story that William Rufus, before he succeeded to the throne, was first\r\nattracted to William of Corboil by the rapidity with which he got through\r\nthe mass, indicates that even that graceless prince submitted to the\r\nirksome restraint of the universal custom. And the stories about Hunting\r\nMasses, in which chaplains omitted everything but the essentials of the\r\nDivine service, afford the same sort of confirmation.[493]\r\n\r\nThe Romance of King Arthur is not often quoted as an historical authority,\r\nbut romances are a picture of contemporary manners and customs, and may be\r\nso far depended upon; and this daily service in the castles and manor\r\nhouses of the Middle Ages is one of the facts of the life of the time\r\nwhich is abundantly illustrated in them. Allusions such as the following\r\nare frequent: “And so they went home and unarmed them, and so to evensong\r\nand supper. And on the morrow they heard mass, and after went to dinner\r\nand to their counsel, and made many arguments what were best to do.”[494]\r\n\r\nAnd in the “Vision of Piers Plowman” we read (Passus v)--\r\n\r\n  The king and his knights to the church wenten,\r\n  To hear matins and mass, and to the meat after.\r\n\r\nThe imagination rests with pleasure on the ordinary orderly life of a\r\nmediæval squire’s manor house, sweetened by this domestic religion; on the\r\nkindly influence of a pious, sensible chaplain over the whole household,\r\nthe adviser of the lord, the tutor of the children, the monitor of the\r\ndomestics. We linger upon the idea of the comfort of it to the widowed\r\nLady Bottreaux, and to the infirm old Sir Peter Fishacre, and to poor old\r\nOliver de Halap, “broken with age, and deprived of the sight of his eyes.”\r\n\r\nWe may add an illustrative note, which, though of later date, is true to\r\nthe habits of this earlier period.\r\n\r\n“For many years together I was seldom or never absent from Divine service\r\n(in church) at five o’clock in the morning in summer, and six o’clock in\r\nthe winter.” And, again, “at Naworth, the house of Sir Charles Howard,\r\nafterwards Earl of Carlisle, there was a chaplain in the house, an\r\nexcellent preacher, who had service twice every Sunday in the chapel, and\r\ndaily prayers morning and evening, and was had in such veneration by all\r\nas if hee had been their tutelar angel” [which did not prevent him from\r\nmaking love to the eldest daughter of the house, and making mischief for\r\nthe autobiographer].[495]\r\n\r\n    By the statute 21 Hen. VIII. c. 13, a limit was set to the number of\r\n    domestic chaplains. An archbishop might have 8 chaplains; a duke, 6;\r\n    marquis and earl, 5; viscount, 4; bishop, 6; chancellor, baron, and\r\n    knight of the garter, 3; duchess, marchioness, countess, and baroness,\r\n    being widows, 2; treasurer and controller of the king’s house, the\r\n    king’s secretary, the dean of the chapel, the king’s almoner, the\r\n    master of the rolls, 2; the chief justice of the king’s bench, and\r\n    warden of the cinque ports, 1. Proviso, that the king’s chaplains may\r\n    hold as many livings as the king shall give.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE CHANTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe characteristic feature of the Church work of the seventh century was\r\nthe conversion of the Teutonic heathen people who had conquered the\r\neastern half of England, and the foundation of a bishopric in every one of\r\nthe heptarchic kingdoms; of the eighth century, the multiplication of\r\nmonastic centres of evangelization; of that and the succeeding centuries\r\nthe spread of the parochial system of a priest for each manor; of the\r\ntwelfth century, the foundation of monasteries; of the thirteenth century,\r\nthe foundation of vicarages in the appropriated parishes, and the\r\ninstitution of the new Order of friars; of the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies, the foundation of chantries: during these two centuries about\r\ntwo thousand chantries were founded.\r\n\r\nA chantry is a foundation for the maintenance of one or more priests, to\r\noffer up prayers for the soul of the founder, his family and ancestors,\r\nand usually of all Christian souls; and this was the motive of the\r\nfounders of the majority of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.\r\n\r\nIn the Religious Foundations of earlier times the condition of prayers for\r\nthe donors was incidental. A man did not build a church for his _ville_ or\r\nfound a monastery on his estate, with the sole or principal view of\r\nsecuring perpetual prayers for himself; but in accordance with the\r\nreligious views of those times when a man did found any pious work, from a\r\ngreat monastery intended to be a nursery of saints to an almshouse for\r\ntwelve poor people, he asked--he stipulated in the terms of his foundation\r\ndeed--for the prayers of the members of his foundation. It would have\r\nlooked like a want of proper religious feeling had he neglected to seek\r\nthe benefit of their intercessory prayers. The desire for the prayers of\r\nthe Church by those who could not found monasteries or build churches,\r\nfound its satisfaction in benefactions to religious foundations, which\r\nsecured for the donors the privileges of confraternity, and among these,\r\nthe prayers of the community.[496] Every religious house had its catalogue\r\nof benefactors, or its list of confraters; and the grateful convent\r\noffered prayers for their good estate while living and the repose of their\r\nsouls after death.[497] At Durham there lay on the altar a book very\r\nrichly covered with gold and silver containing the names of all the\r\nbenefactors of the cathedral church collected out of ancient MSS. about\r\nthe time of the Suppression.[498] But far more interesting is the\r\n“Catalogus Benefactorum” of the great monastery of St. Alban, preserved in\r\nthe British Museum Library; in it the name of every benefactor is entered,\r\nwith a note of his gift--of an estate, or house, or sum of money, or\r\nsacred vessel; and in many cases a picture of the donor and of his gift is\r\ngiven, the house being shown in the background of the picture, the flagon\r\nor purse of gold held in his hand.\r\n\r\nError came in when a man founded a Divine service the sole object of which\r\nwas to obtain prayers for himself; it was mitigated by the association of\r\nfamily, benefactors, and friends, and the usual addition of all faithful\r\nsouls. After all, a saint of old was glad that his name should be enrolled\r\nin the diptych of his Church, and remembered in her prayers. But a saint\r\nwould have been content to be included in the general sentence with which\r\nthe roll concluded--“and all those whose names, O God, Thou knowest.” We,\r\nat least, may be satisfied with the commemoration by our Church of “all\r\nthose who have departed in Thy faith and fear,” without being too ready to\r\nfind fault with those whose eschatology differed somewhat from ours, and\r\nwas less scriptural; but whose simple desire, after all, was for God’s\r\nmercy on themselves, and who, in anxiety for themselves, did not forget\r\n“all faithful souls.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn some cases it is probable that the common human desire to be remembered\r\nafter death took this shape; a chantry was a monument; and a monument of\r\nliving men keeping a name in remembrance has very respectable countenance.\r\nThis is the explanation of a good number of English titles of nobility,\r\nwith grants of suitable estates to maintain the title. The Dukedoms of\r\nMarlborough and of Wellington, the Earldoms of St. Vincent and of Nelson,\r\nwere intended by the sovereign who granted the titles, and the\r\nParliaments which granted the estates, to keep in memory those great men\r\nand their services to the country, and have well served their purpose. So,\r\nmany a chantry kept the name of the founder fresh in the recollection of\r\nhis descendants, and of the people of his neighbourhood, which would\r\notherwise have been forgotten. The desire to have one’s name kept alive on\r\nthe lips of prayer was not an unworthy one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the two thousand chantries founded between the thirteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries were not all of this exclusively personal kind. Many\r\nincluded objects of general utility, which under the name of a chantry\r\ncould be founded and endowed in a legal way, evading many legal\r\ndifficulties. Some of the chantries were really chapels-of-ease for an\r\noutlying population; some were additions to the working clerical staff of\r\na town; some were grammar schools, the chantry priest being really the\r\nschoolmaster.\r\n\r\nChantries began to be founded late in the thirteenth century. The\r\n“Taxatio” records only two: one of Hugh of Wells, Bishop of Lincoln, who\r\ndied 1225, the other at Hatherton, in the Archdeaconry of Coventry.[499]\r\nThe number of them increased more and more, and the greater proportion\r\nwere founded in the fifteenth century.[500] They were distributed very\r\nunequally over the country. Some of the cathedrals served by canons had a\r\nconsiderable number, perhaps because founders of chantries who were great\r\nnoblemen and ecclesiastics preferred to be commemorated in the mother\r\nchurch of their diocese. Thus, St. Paul’s, London,[501] had 37; York, 3;\r\nLichfield, 87; Lincoln, 36; Chichester, 12; Exeter, 11; Hereford, 11;\r\nSarum, 11; none in Wells; none in Bath Abbey Church, but 18 in the\r\nadjoining college of Delamond Roy. The cathedrals served by monks seem not\r\nto have encouraged the founding of chantries; thus there are none in\r\nDurham, Ely, Norwich, Worcester, Winchester, and only, exceptionally, 4 in\r\nCanterbury, 2 in Rochester; 4 in the Church of Austin Canons, which was\r\nthe Cathedral of Carlisle. They were numerous in the great town churches,\r\nfounded by the wealthy citizens; there were over 180 in the city and\r\nsuburbs of London; 42 in the city of York; 23 in Newcastle; 4 in the city\r\nof Lincoln; 10 in the city of Hereford; 13 in the town of Newark; 7 in\r\nDoncaster; 5 in Rotherham, etc. They were unequally distributed over the\r\ncountry parishes; in Norwich diocese, there are very few outside the\r\ntowns; in Yorkshire they are very numerous; in Wales there are almost\r\nnone.\r\n\r\nWe give at length the history of a chantry at Ipswich, as an illustration\r\nof these personal chantries.\r\n\r\n    Edmund Daundy, merchant of Ipswich, in 1514, founded a perpetual\r\n    chantry for a chantry priest at the altar of St. Thomas the Martyr, in\r\n    the parish church of St. Lawrence, in Ipswich, for the prosperous\r\n    state of King Henry VIII. and Katharine his queen, of himself, Edmund\r\n    Daundy, Thomas Wulcy (Cardinal Wolsey), clarke, dean of the cathedral\r\n    church of Lincoln, and of Wm. Daundy, his son, for the term of their\r\n    life, and for their souls after their decease; and also for the souls\r\n    of Anne, his late wife, Robert Wulcy and Jane, his wife, father and\r\n    mother of the same Thomas Wulcy, etc.\r\n\r\n    The presentation is to be in the hands of the wardens of the parish\r\n    and six men nominated by the bailiffs, who shall elect and nominate a\r\n    man to the Prior of Holy Trinity, who shall present him to the\r\n    Ordinary for admittance; and if the parish priest refuse to induct\r\n    him, he may induct himself. He is to take oath to keep the statutes of\r\n    the foundation, perform the duties personally, not be absent for more\r\n    than twenty days, except from infirmity, not take any other benefice,\r\n    office, stipend, trental, nor yearly service, but the £11 6_s._\r\n    8_d._[502] granted by the founder; he shall abstain from all unlawful\r\n    games and sports.\r\n\r\n    His duties are, to say twice in the week _dirge_ and _commendations_,\r\n    and once in the week mass of _requiem_, with the collect, _Almighty\r\n    and Everlasting God, who governest both the quick and dead, etc._,\r\n    with its ... and post communion thereto pertaining; and each day the\r\n    same priest, singing his mass, and going to the altar’s end before he\r\n    washes his hands at the lavatory, shall say this psalm, _De\r\n    profundis_, with the collect _Fidelium_, etc., at the end whereof he\r\n    shall say, “May the soul of Edmund Daundy, founder of this chantry,\r\n    and the souls of his parents and kinsfolk and benefactors, and all\r\n    Christian souls, rest in peace and quietness. Amen.”\r\n\r\n    Also the priest is to be present in the choir of the parish church of\r\n    St. Lawrence, having on his surplice, at mattins, processions, mass,\r\n    and evensong, singing the psalmodies with the other priests and clarks\r\n    every Sunday and Doublefeast and other convenient times, in augmenting\r\n    of the Divine service, except any lawful case do let him.\r\n\r\n    Further on, he orders that the names of the persons to be prayed for,\r\n    viz. the king and queen, Edmund Daundy, Thomas Wulcy, and Wm. Daundy,\r\n    among the quick during their lives, and also the names of Anne,\r\n    Robert, and Jane among the dead, shall be written on a table, and the\r\n    said table by the said priest shall be set openly upon the altar of\r\n    St. Thomas the Martyr, etc., to the intent that every day the said\r\n    priest, in his mass, shall pray for the prosperity of our said\r\n    sovereign lord the king, and the said Edmund the founder, etc., etc.\r\n\r\n    He assigns for the residence of the priest his messuage lately built,\r\n    with a garden and a certain lane, and all its appurtenances, lately\r\n    built in the parish of St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\n    He has provided for the chantry a mass-book, two complete vestments,\r\n    and a book called a Coucher; and he directs that the vestments, books,\r\n    chalices, and other ornaments of the altar given, or to be given, by\r\n    him or any other patron, after mass shall be properly put away in a\r\n    chest and locked up.[503] He also wills that the priest shall deposit\r\n    yearly 2_s._ 4_d._ in a box, with two keys, one to be kept by himself\r\n    and the other by the churchwardens, for the maintenance of the house,\r\n    chantry, furniture, etc. Also, that every priest shall leave to his\r\n    successor 40_s._, for the costs and charges of his successor about his\r\n    presentation, admission, institution, and induction.\r\n\r\n    He makes elaborate arrangements for his year-day, with the whole\r\n    service ordained for the dead, for ever. The chantry priest is on that\r\n    day to distribute to the parish priest of St. Lawrence ministering\r\n    about the same anniversary, 12_s._; to the twelve priests, masses and\r\n    other divine services there doing, 6_s._; to the parish clerk, 12_d._;\r\n    to the other six clerks there singing and serving God, 12_d._, equally\r\n    among them; to twelve children there singing and serving God, 12_d._;\r\n    to the sexton and ringing of the bells, 6_d._; to twelve poor indigent\r\n    persons of the said parish to pray for his soul and the souls above\r\n    said, 2_s._; and to the two bailiffs of Ipswich, 13_s._ 4_d._--that is\r\n    to say, to every one of them to offer at the said anniversary, 12_d._,\r\n    and to control the said anniversary, 6_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\n    “And because it is not in man but in God to foresee and provide all\r\n    things, and oftentime it fortuneth that what in the beginning was\r\n    thought to be profitable, afterwards is found not to be so,” therefore\r\n    he reserves to himself only the power to alter these statutes.[504]\r\n\r\nThe Pudsay Chantry at Bolton-by-Bowland, Yorkshire, was founded for a\r\npriest to pray for the soul of the founder, etc., and all Christian souls,\r\nand also to say mass at the manor house of Bolton when he shall be\r\nrequired by the said founder or his heirs.[505]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrequently a chantry was endowed for more than one priest; that of the\r\nBlack Prince in Canterbury Cathedral was for two priests, whose stipends\r\nat the end of the fifteenth century amounted to £12 each. The endowment\r\nof the early Chantry of Hugh of Wells, at Lincoln, was held by the sacrist\r\nwho, out of its £21 6_s._ 8_d._ a year, had to find two chaplains and to\r\npay alms to the poor at the obit. The Burghersh Chantry, at Lincoln\r\nCathedral, was for five chaplains and six boys who lived together in the\r\nchantry house in the Cathedral Close; the endowment, after paying for the\r\nmaintenance and schooling of the boys, left £7 9_s._ a piece to each of\r\nthe cantarists. There was a chantry of six priests at Harwood, Yorkshire.\r\nThere were many others with two and three priests. Richard III. commenced\r\nthe foundation of a chantry of a hundred chaplains in York Minster; six\r\naltars were erected, and the chantry house begun, when the king’s death on\r\nBosworth Field put an end to the magnificent design.[506] The foundation\r\nof his fortunate rival, though not so extravagant, was of regal splendour.\r\nHenry VII.’s chapel at Westminster is the sumptuous chantry chapel in\r\nwhich his monument, with its bronze effigy, protected by the bronze herse,\r\nstill remain uninjured. The title deed of the endowment which he made for\r\nthe perpetuation of his memory still remains in the form of a handsome\r\nvolume, whose pages are adorned with miniature pictures, and the great\r\nseals are still attached to it, in their silver cases. First, he provided\r\nfor three additional monks to say masses for him, who were to be called\r\nthe king’s chantry monks. On every anniversary, the greatest bell of the\r\nmonastery was to be rung for an hour, and the bells rung as at the most\r\nsolemn anniversaries. A hundred wax tapers, each 12 lbs. in weight and 9\r\nfeet long, were to be set upon and about the herse, and there continually\r\nto burn during all the time of the service of the _Placebo_, the _Dirge_,\r\nwith lessons, lauds, and mass of _Requiem_, and all the orations,\r\nobservances, and ceremonies belonging thereto. Also 24 new torches were to\r\nbe held about the herse all the time of the service. Twenty pounds were to\r\nbe given in alms, viz. 25 marks among the blind, lame, impotent, and most\r\nneedy people, 2_d._ to each man and woman, and 1_d._ to each child so far\r\nas it will go; and 5 marks to be given to the 13 bedesmen and 3 bedeswomen\r\nprovided in the said monastery (of whom one was to be a priest, and all\r\nunder the government of a monk), 12_d._ to each. A weekly obit was to be\r\nheld, at which the bells were to be rung; and alms given to the 13\r\nbedesmen and 2 bedeswomen and 124 others, 1_d._ to each. Thirty tapers\r\nwere to burn at the weekly obit, to be renewed when they had burnt down to\r\n5 feet long; to burn also during high mass and first and latter evensong,\r\nand at every principal feast; and at the coming of the king and queen for\r\nthe time being into the Church of the said monastery, and of any of royal\r\nblood, dukes, and earls. Four of the torches to be held about the herse at\r\nweekly obits, to be renewed when wasted to 7 feet long. Four tapers, one\r\nat each side and one at each end, were to burn perpetually night and day,\r\nbesides the 100 aforesaid, to be renewed when wasted to 6 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abbot, monks, and bedesmen of Westminster Abbey.]\r\n\r\nEvery year, on some day before the anniversary, the abstract of the grant\r\nwas to be read in the chapter house, and the Chief Justice or King’s\r\nAttorney or Recorder of London to be present, and to receive 20_s._ for\r\nthe attendance, and after the reading to go straight to the herse and say\r\ncertain psalms. The woodcut, taken from one of the illuminations of this\r\ntitle deed, represents the abbot and several monks and the bedesmen above\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nParochial benefices were sometimes appropriated to the maintenance of\r\nchantries; in some cases what was done amounted to this: that the parish\r\nchurch was converted into a chantry for the lord of the manor and his\r\nfamily. Thus, in 1319, Sir John de Trejagu, Knt., founded a chantry for\r\nfour chaplains in the Church of St. Michael Penkvil for prayers for\r\nhimself and family. The proposal was approved by the bishop, who made the\r\nchurch collegiate, and the chief of the four clergymen who were to serve\r\nit an archpriest, with the care of the parishioners.\r\n\r\nSo, in 1334, Eresby Church was appropriated to the Chantry Chapel of\r\nSpillesby by the bishop, on the petition of Sir Rob. de Willughby, Knt.,\r\nand a master and twelve chaplains of the chantry were founded there by Sir\r\nJohn de W. and Lady Johan his wife.[507] In 1395, Elizabeth de Willughby,\r\nConsort of Sir Robert, lord of Eresby, left her body to be buried in the\r\nabove chantry, and bequeathed to the chantry a crucifix of gold in which\r\nis a piece of the cross of our Lord, and set with two rubies and two\r\nemeralds, with a circle of pearls on the head, to remain there for ever\r\nwithout being alienated.[508]\r\n\r\nIsabel, widow of Sir Fulke de Penbridge (1410), purchased the advowson of\r\nTonge Church, Shropshire, from Shrewsbury Abbey, rebuilt the church in its\r\npresent beauty, and endowed it with £50, to support a warden, five\r\nchaplains, and thirteen old men. The chaplains were not to take other\r\npreferment. If any of the poor men were sick or bedridden, they were to be\r\nvisited three times a week by one of the chaplains. If any stranger dined\r\nin hall, the chaplain who introduced him was to pay for his dinner, 3_s._\r\nif at the high table, 1_s._ 4_d._ if at the low.[509]\r\n\r\nSometimes a man founded more than one chantry, perhaps, in churches on his\r\nseveral estates; thus, Ralph Basset, of Drayton, Knight, in 1389 leaves\r\n£200 to found two chantries, “one in St. Mary’s Chapel in Olney\r\nChurchyard, and one in the new chapel built by me at Colston\r\nBasset.”[510] Sir William de Molynes, Knight, in 4 Richard II., leaves\r\nbequests “to every chaplain of my three chantries.”[511]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe founder of a chantry usually kept the right to nominate the cantarist\r\nin his own family. Thus, the founder of a chantry of three priests, who\r\nwere to dwell together in a house vulgarly called Muston, in the parish of\r\nLeverton and Leake, left the right of presentation to her daughters.[512]\r\nSometimes the presentation was left to the parish priest, as at\r\nEdmonton;[513] sometimes it was even vested in the parishioners, as at\r\nHarlow.[513]\r\n\r\nChantries continued to be founded up to the very eve of their general\r\ndestruction: _e.g._ one at Bishopstone Church, Hereford, in 1532; in\r\nLugwardine Church, in 1541; and in Welsh Newton, in a doubtful way, as\r\nlate as 1547.[514]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while to say that the clergy were as much given to making\r\narrangements for posthumous prayers for themselves and their families as\r\nthe laity. A large proportion of the chantry chapels in cathedrals were\r\nfounded for themselves by bishops. One of the earliest is that of Bishop\r\nHugh of Wells, of Lincoln in A.D. 1235; Bishop Stavenby of Lichfield, who\r\ndied 1238, set the example there; and so in other cathedrals. There is a\r\npleasing touch of sentiment in Bishop Weseham’s foundation of a chantry in\r\nLichfield Cathedral for himself and his friend, Bishop Grostete of\r\nLincoln, of which cathedral he had himself been dean before his promotion\r\nto the episcopate.[515]\r\n\r\nNot many parish priests founded chantries, because they were seldom rich\r\nenough to undertake anything so costly; but the numerous instances in\r\ntheir wills of provision made for trentals, month’s minds, and obits,\r\nattest their belief and feeling on the subject.[516] There is a quaint\r\ntouch of professional experience in the condition of the bequest of John\r\nCotes, Canon of Lincoln in 1433, to the resident canons, vicars,\r\nchaplains, poor clerks, and choristers attending his funeral, “and present\r\nat the whole office, not to those going like vagabonds through the middle\r\nof the church at the time of the said office.”[517]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe majority of the chantries were founded at an existing altar of a\r\ncathedral, monastic, or parish church; but chantry chapels were specially\r\nprovided for many of these services, and were the occasion of the\r\nintroduction of a great deal of architectural variety and interest in\r\nexisting churches. In the cathedrals, little chapels were screened off in\r\nvarious places. A very favourite locality for the burial of a bishop was\r\nbetween the great pillars of the nave or choir; the space between the\r\npillars was converted into a little chapel by stone screens which enclosed\r\nthe tomb and altar, and left space for a priest to minister and an acolyte\r\nto serve, while those attending the service stood or knelt outside, and\r\ncould see or hear through the open-work of the screen. Without going\r\nfurther than Winchester Cathedral, we shall find illustrations of\r\nvarieties of plan and elevation of these chantry chapels.\r\n\r\nThose of Wykeham and Edyngdon on the south side of the nave have the space\r\nbetween two pillars screened off with elaborate tabernacle work of stone,\r\nand are groined above. Those of Fox and Gardiner are on the south and\r\nnorth sides of the choir; each has a small chamber adjoining the chapel.\r\nThose of Cardinal Beaufort and Waynflete are on the south and north sides\r\nof the retro-choir. On each side of the Lady Chapel is a space enclosed\r\nfor a chantry chapel by wooden screens; that on the south (to Bishop\r\nLangton) has benches round the three sides, panelled at the back and\r\ncanopied by a tester, for people attending the service.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tewkesbury Abbey. The Warwick Chantry Chapel.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cuckfield Church, Sussex--before restoration.]\r\n\r\nIn a parish church, the place provided for a memorial service was\r\nsometimes a chapel added to the choir of the church and opening into it,\r\nbut partitioned by stone, or, more frequently, wooden screens; these\r\nchapels were sometimes architecturally beautiful, and added to the\r\nspaciousness and dignity of the church. But often, instead of being an\r\naddition to the spaciousness of the church, they were a practical\r\ninfringement upon its space; for the most frequent provision for a chantry\r\nwas made by screening off the east end of an aisle, either of the chancel\r\nor nave. There were rare examples of the chantry chapel being a detached\r\nbuilding in the churchyard. At Winchester there is an example both of a\r\nchantry at the side of the College chapel and also of another, with a\r\npriest’s chamber over it,[518] in the middle of the cloister court.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Screen of Chantry Chapel, Dennington, Suffolk.]\r\n\r\nIt seems desirable to repeat here that some of the domestic chapels were\r\nfounded as chantry chapels, or had a chantry subsequently founded within\r\nthem; as the domestic chapel at the Vyne, Hants. There were two chantries\r\nin the chapel of Pontefract Castle; one in the chapel of the manor house\r\nat Topcliff, Yorkshire, and at Cransford, Dorset, and in the Bishop of\r\nDurham’s manor house at Darlington. Very probably the service in a\r\ndomestic chapel always included some commemoration of the departed members\r\nof the family.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was only well-to-do people who could afford to found and endow a\r\nperpetual chantry; there were many less costly ways in which men showed\r\ntheir solicitude for their own well-being, and their affection for their\r\nbelongings, by making such provision for mortuary prayers and masses as\r\ntheir means allowed. Sometimes provision is made for a chantry to last for\r\na limited number of years. Thus--\r\n\r\n    John Cotes, of Tevelby, Canon of Lincoln in 1433, left for a chaplain\r\n    to sing every day for twenty years, “to have £4 13_s._ 4_d._ per ann.,\r\n    and 3_s._ 4_d._ for wine, wax, and candles, and to engage in no other\r\n    duty, spiritual or temporal, under pain of my anathema.”\r\n\r\n    Robert Astbroke, of Chepyng Wycombe, 1533, leaves money for “a priest\r\n    to sing for my soul in Wicomb Church, at Ihus altar for x years, and I\r\n    desire that there be no prieste admytted to the said servys but that\r\n    can sing at least his playn song substancyally.”[519]\r\n\r\n    Thomas Booth, in Eccles Church in Lancashire, leaves 100 marks to two\r\n    chaplains for ten years in two chapels--five marks a year each.[520]\r\n\r\n    Robert Johnson,[520] Alderman of York, leaves, “to the exhibition of\r\n    an honest prest to synge at the alter of Our Lady daily by the space\r\n    of vij yeres xxxv{li.} And I will that what prest that shall serve it\r\n    every day, when that he hath saide masse, shall stand affore my grave\r\n    [which was ‘affore the mydste of the alter’] in his albe, and ther to\r\n    say the psalme of _De Profundis_, with the collettes, and then caste\r\n    holy water upon my grave.”[521]\r\n\r\nSo, we have bequests of money to provide one or two chaplains for two\r\nyears; still more frequently one or two chaplains for one year; frequently\r\nfor a trental of masses, and an obit, that is for masses for thirty days\r\nafter death, and after that a mass on the anniversary of death; most\r\nfrequently of all, for mass on the first, third, seventh, and thirtieth\r\nday, and on the years’ day.[522] In most cases there was a sum left for\r\nwax tapers and other funeral expenses, and for a donation to every clerk,\r\nor layman, attending the funeral mass and the obit. In the case of the\r\npoorest, the parish priest said a mass for the dead, and committed the\r\nbody, with the proper prayers, to the grave.[523]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIGILIÆ MORTUORUM. XV. CENT. MS., EGERTON, 1070, f. 54 v.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRalph Lord Cromwell, making his will in 1457, desired that his body should\r\nbe buried in Tattershall Church, which he had rebuilt and made\r\nCollegiate,[524] and that three thousand masses should be said for his\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\n    John Prestecote, 1411-1412 [seems to be a clergyman], leaves stock to\r\n    churchwardens of several parishes to maintain his anniversary for\r\n    ever, and anniversaries of others; leaves his best silver-covered cup\r\n    to the Prioress of Polslo Convent, to remain in that house for ever,\r\n    and be called by his name “Prestcote” in his memory.[525]\r\n\r\n    1503. Agnes Walworth leaves to the Church of St. Peter a cup of silver\r\n    gilt, and to be prayed for in the Bead Roll for one whole year.[526]\r\n\r\n    1508. Wm. Harcote leaves his body to be buried in St. Peter’s\r\n    Churchyard, and money to purchase a cross, according to the cross of\r\n    St. Nicholas in the churchyard, to stand over his grave.[527]\r\n\r\n    1509. Wm. Plesyngton orders his body to be buried in St. Peter’s\r\n    Churchyard; a barrel of beer, with bread,[528] to be given in the\r\n    church at his cost to the poor of the parish; Sir Jeffrey, his ghostly\r\n    father, to say a trental of masses for his soul in St. Peter’s Church,\r\n    and to be paid 5_s._[529]\r\n\r\nHere are some curiosities on the subject--\r\n\r\n    Dame Eliz. Bourchier, in 1499, leaves “_xx marcs for a yearly obit_,\r\n    at St. Dunstan’s in the East, if the parson and parishioners will\r\n    have it; if not, at some other church; and each of her servants, men\r\n    and women, dwelling with her at the _time of death, to have a\r\n    convenient black gown_ to pray for her soul.”[530]\r\n\r\n    In 1452, Thomas of Beckington, Bishop of Bath and Wells, consecrated a\r\n    tomb which he had made for himself, and said mass, in full\r\n    pontificals, for his own soul, for the souls of his parents, and all\r\n    the faithful departed, in the presence of a vast congregation.[531]\r\n\r\n    The Commonalty of Oxford was required to found an anniversary for the\r\n    souls of the clerks and others, about forty in number, killed in a\r\n    Town and Gown riot on St. Scholastica’s Day, 1354, and to make an\r\n    offering, to be distributed 1_d._ to each of forty poor scholars, and\r\n    the rest to St. Mary’s Church. It was continued down to the\r\n    Reformation.[532]\r\n\r\n    Roger Wylkynson, of Swyneshead, yeoman, 1499, leaves to his godson his\r\n    principal messuage and lands, “to him and his heirs in tail, they\r\n    keeping my anniversary in Swyneshed Church.”[533]\r\n\r\n    Thomas Normanton, of Tynwell, 1533, leaves his lands to his eldest son\r\n    Richard in tail, “he and his heirs to keep my anniversary in Ketton\r\n    Church for ever.”[534] The “for ever” lasted sixteen years.\r\n\r\n    John Toynton, of Lincoln, chaplain, 1431, directs his anniversary to\r\n    be kept ten years for the following alms:--“In the offering at mass,\r\n    6_d._; in the tolling of the bells to the clerks, 2_d._; in candles at\r\n    the mass, 2_d._; in bread at the dirge, 1_s._ 4_d._; six chaplains\r\n    saying dirge and mass, 12_d._--that is, to each 2_d._; to poor and\r\n    needy, 7_d._; to the parochial chaplain saying my name in his roll on\r\n    Sundays at prayers, 4_d._; to the chantry priest, Robert Dalderby, of\r\n    Lincoln [chaplain], a new vestment of ruby satin, with golden letters\r\n    upon it, and a new vestment of Borde to Alexander the chaplain, for\r\n    masses.”[535]\r\n\r\n    Robert Appulby of Lincoln leaves a bequest to the Guild of Clerks at\r\n    Lincoln that his name may be recited among the names of the departed,\r\n    and the antiphon _Alma Redemptoris Mater_.[536]\r\n\r\nWe gather with some certainty the amount of remuneration which was usually\r\ngiven to a chantry priest for his services. John Coates, we have seen, in\r\n1433, directs that a chaplain shall say mass for him every day for twenty\r\nyears, and shall have four pounds thirteen shillings and fourpence per\r\nannum, besides three shillings and fourpence for wine and wax candles, and\r\nshall engage in no other service, spiritual or temporal, on pain of his\r\nanathema.[537]\r\n\r\n    Richard de Croxton, 1383, leaves £50 for masses for ten years; this\r\n    would be at the rate of £5 a year. Thomas de Roos, lord of Hamlak and\r\n    Belvoir, in 1412, leaves £400 for ten chaplains to say mass in his\r\n    chapel of Belvoir, for eight years, which, again, amounts to £5 a year\r\n    to each. J. de Haddon, Canon of Lincoln, 1374, leaves £21 for two\r\n    chaplains for two years. Beatrix Hanlay, 1389, leaves 20 marks and a\r\n    silver cup to Thornton Abbey for masses, and £30 of silver to six\r\n    priests to celebrate for a year. So that it is abundantly evident that\r\n    £5 a year was the usual stipend for a chantry priest. Elizabeth Davy,\r\n    1412, leaves cc{l.} for masses, which is to be kept in some secret\r\n    place in Lincoln Cathedral, and distributed annually to the chaplains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Nicholas Sturgeon, priest in 1454, bequeaths to the Church of St.\r\n    Andrew, Asperton, Herefordshire, a vestment of black for priest,\r\n    deacon, and sub-deacon of the price of £10 or within; his exequies and\r\n    obit day to be kept solemnly there during the term of seven years, for\r\n    the expenses of which he bequeaths 46_s._, that is, for every year\r\n    6_s._ 4_d._\r\n\r\nHere is a very curious example of a nun being paid to say prayers for\r\npeople living and dead: John of Leek, Rector of Houghton, 1459, leaves--\r\n\r\n    to Isabella Chawelton, sister of St. Katharine’s, Lincoln, 40_s._ to\r\n    pray for the soul of her sister Grace, and my soul.[538]\r\n\r\nWhen we refer to the returns of the “Valor,” we are confirmed in the\r\nconclusion that £5 was the normal stipend of a chantry priest; but a few,\r\nthrough the liberality of the endowment, received more, like the two\r\nchaplains of the Black Prince’s chantry with their £12 a year; and many\r\nreceived less, as may be seen in the volumes of the “Valor” _passim_.\r\n\r\n    William Rayne (of Coltisbroke, 1535), leaves to his nephew, if he\r\n    shall be ordained “a priest, to have £5 a year to sing for me for five\r\n    years, except he be at my wyf’s bording and bedding, and if he soo be,\r\n    then four marks a yere.”[539]\r\n\r\nSo that a priest’s board and lodging was worth £5 - 4 × 13_s._ 4_d._ = £2\r\n13_s._ 4_d._ The lodging with the widow would be consistent with the idea\r\nthat a chantry priest or annueller was a kind of chaplain to the family.\r\nThis conjecture is supported by the statute of 36 Ed. III., c. 8, which,\r\nin consequence of the dearth of parish priests after the Black Plague,\r\ndesired to lessen the number engaged in mortuary services; it forbade any\r\nlayman to pay a priest more than 5 marks, and if retained to abide at his\r\ntable, that was to be reckoned as equal to 40_s._[540] As part of the same\r\npolicy, a constitution of Archbishop Islop, in 1362, fixed the stipend of\r\na chantry priest at 5 marks.[541]\r\n\r\nArchbishop Islip, 1362,[542] says, “We are certainly informed by common\r\nfame and experience that modern priests, through covetousness and love of\r\nease, not content with reasonable salaries, demand excessive pay for their\r\nlabours, and receive it; and do so despise labour and study that they\r\nwholly refuse as parish priests to serve in churches or chapels, or to\r\nattend the cure of souls, though fitting salaries are offered them, and\r\nprefer to live in a leisurely manner by celebrating annuals for the quick\r\nand dead; and so parish churches and chapels remain unofficiated,\r\ndestitute of parochial chaplains, and even proper curates, to the grievous\r\ndanger of souls; whereupon he goes on to decree that all unbeneficed\r\nchaplains fitted for cure of souls shall be required to put aside any\r\nprivate obsequies, and officiate wherever the ordinary shall appoint them,\r\nand at six marks of annual stipend, while priests without cure of souls\r\nshall be content with five marks.”\r\n\r\nThese services for the dead made work for a considerable number of\r\nclerics. Sometimes, no doubt, the parish priest celebrated the month’s\r\nmind and the obit, and perhaps the trental also; but when a competent\r\nprovision had been made for the purpose it is probable that it was usual\r\nto employ a distinct person to fulfil the stipulated services. The\r\nbeneficed clergy are indeed accused of sometimes running away from their\r\nown poor benefices to take engagements of this sort. “Piers Ploughman”\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n  Parsons and parish preistes pleyned hem to the bisshope,\r\n  That hire parishes weren povere sith the pestilence tyme,[543]\r\n  To have a licence and leve at London to dwelle,\r\n  And syngen ther for symonie, for silver is swete.\r\n\r\nChaucer says of his poor parson--\r\n\r\n  He sett not his benefice to hire,\r\n  And lefte his sheep accombred in the mire,\r\n  And ran unto London unto Sainte Poules,[544]\r\n  To seeken him a chanterie for souls,\r\n  Or with a Brotherhode to be withold,\r\n  But dwelt at home and kepte well his fold.\r\n\r\nBut that some poor parsons did so, and that their bishops allowed it, we\r\nhave the evidence of the Episcopal Registers.[545]\r\n\r\nOne result of these occasional engagements for a month, or a year, or a\r\nfew years, was that a considerable number of priests made a precarious\r\nliving in this easy way, and in many cases were not very useful members of\r\nsociety or very respectable members of the clerical body.[546]\r\n\r\nChaucer has introduced into his “Shipman’s Tale” one of these priests\r\n“living in a leisurely manner by celebrating annuals for the quick and\r\ndead”:--\r\n\r\n  In London was a priest, an annueller,\r\n  That therein dwelled hadde many a year,\r\n  Which was so pleasant and so serviceable\r\n  Unto the wife thereas he was at table,\r\n  That she would suffer him no thing to pay\r\n  For board ne lodging, went he never so gay\r\n  And spending silver had he ryht ynoil.[547]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary chantry priest was under no canonical obligation to help the\r\nparish priest in his general duties; but in some cases the foundation deed\r\nof the chantry required that the cantarist should assist at Divine worship\r\non Sundays and festivals for the greater honour of the service; and in\r\nsome cases the priest is expressly required by his foundation deed to help\r\nthe vicar in the cure of souls, as in the parish churches of Helmsley,\r\nMiddleton, etc.\r\n\r\n    Our Lady’s chantry priest in Rothwell Church (1494), to celebrate mass\r\n    daily in chantry and other Divine service, and be in the high quire\r\n    all festival days at mattins, mass, and evensong; and to help to\r\n    minister sacraments in the parish.\r\n\r\n    Margaret Blade, widow, endowed the chantry of our Lady in Kildewick\r\n    Parish, in 1505, for a priest to help Divine service in the quire, to\r\n    help the curate in time of necessity, and also to sing mass of our\r\n    Lady on Saturday and Sunday, “if he have convenient help.”[548]\r\n\r\nSometimes the chantry priest was required to say Divine service at an\r\nunusual hour for the convenience of portions of the people; thus, at St.\r\nAgnes, York, the chantry service had been between eleven and twelve,\r\nunusually late, and was altered by the advice of the parishioners to an\r\nequally abnormal early hour, viz. between four and five in the morning, as\r\nwell for their accommodation as for travelling people, who desired to hear\r\nmass before setting out on their journey.[549] Many churches had such an\r\nearly service, called the “Morrow Mass.”\r\n\r\n  If thou have eny wey to wende,\r\n  I rede thou here a masse to ende,\r\n  In the morennynge if thou may,\r\n  Thou shalt not leose of thi travayle,\r\n  Not half a foote of wey.[550]\r\n\r\nSome of the chantry chapels were practically chapels-of-ease at a distance\r\nfrom the parish church. For parishes having once been established, the\r\nrights of the patrons, incumbents, parishioners, and others interested\r\nwere so safely secured by the law that it was difficult for any one to\r\nmake an alteration in the existing arrangements. Even down to the passing\r\nof the general Church Building Acts in the present century, a private Act\r\nof Parliament was necessary to legalize the subdivision of a parish. When\r\nthe growth of new groups of population at a distance from the parish\r\nchurch made it desirable to provide the means of Divine worship and\r\npastoral oversight there, if the incumbent desired to make the provision,\r\nhe could do it by building chapels, and supplying them with chaplains at\r\nhis own cost, and under his own control. If a lay proprietor desired to\r\nmake the provision for the people about him, he could do it by getting the\r\nbishop’s leave to found a chantry, and the king’s licence to endow it\r\nnotwithstanding the Mortmain Act. Accordingly, a number of chapels were\r\nfounded, which were technically chantry chapels, but really\r\nchapels-of-ease for an outlying population; _e.g._ the chantries at\r\nBrentwood, in the parish of Southweald; Billericay, in the parish of Great\r\nBurstead; Foulness island, in the parish of Wakering; in the street of\r\nGreat Dunmow, half a mile from the parish church, all in Essex; of\r\nWoodstock; of Quarrindon, in the parish of Barrow; of St. Giles, in the\r\nparish of Stretton, both in Notts, were all built at a distance of a mile\r\nor more from their parish churches. At Macclesfield, the Savage Chantry,\r\nfounded by the Archbishop of York of that name, who died 1506, was a\r\nchapel-of-ease two miles distant from the parish church. There were a\r\nconsiderable number of these outlying chantries in the extensive parishes\r\nof Yorkshire, at distances of from half a mile to two or three miles from\r\nthe parish church, and in some cases divided from the parish church by\r\nwaters liable to be flooded; in some parishes there were two or three such\r\nchantries; as two at Topcliff, two in Sherifholm, two in Strenshall, two\r\nin Wath, three in Northallerton, besides a chapel seven miles off served\r\nby the vicar’s chaplain; one in each of the parishes of Helmsley, Kirby\r\nMisperton, Malton, etc.\r\n\r\nIn some of these chapels there was no endowment for a priest, or it was\r\ninsufficient, and the inhabitants of the villages taxed themselves\r\nvoluntarily to make up a stipend; thus, at Ayton, the rate of payment was\r\nfor a husbandman (? tenant farmer) 8_d._, a cottager with land 4_d._, a\r\ncottager without land 2_d._ a quarter.\r\n\r\nHere is another similar case which presents us with quite a picture:--In\r\n1472, the people of Haxby complain to the archdeacon that “they inhabit so\r\nunreasonable fer from ther parisch chirche that the substance [majority]\r\nof the said inhabitauntes for impotenseye and feblenes, farrenes of the\r\nlong way, and also for grete abundance of waters and perlouse passages at\r\nsmall brigges for people in age and unweldye, bethurn these and ther nex\r\nparische chirche, they may not come with ese or in seasonable tyme at\r\ntheir saide parishe chirche, as Cristen peple should, and as they wold,\r\nso they pray for leave and help for a chaplain of their own.”[551]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA grammar school was often provided for a parish under the convenient\r\nconditions of a chantry; the schoolmaster being a priest, it was no great\r\naddition to his duties to require him to add to his mass prayer for his\r\nfounders; it was very natural that the boys who profited by the foundation\r\nshould also be required to join in the commemoration services for their\r\nbenefactor.[552]\r\n\r\nWe quote the whole scheme of the foundation at Blackburn as an example of\r\nits kind.\r\n\r\n    In 1514, fifth year of Henry VIII., Thomas, Earl of Derby, and the\r\n    parishioners of Blackburn, each contributed lands, etc., to be held by\r\n    certain trustees for the foundation of a chantry in the church there,\r\n    in the chapel of our blessed Lady, in the south aisle there. The\r\n    chantry priest was to be “an honest seculer prest, and no reguler,\r\n    sufficiently lerned in gramer and playn song, y{f} any such can be\r\n    gotten, that shall kepe continually a fre gramer schole, and maintaine\r\n    and kepe the one syde of the quire, as one man may, in his surplice,\r\n    every holiday throughout the year.” And if no secular priest can be\r\n    found that is able and sufficiently “lerned in gramer and plain song,”\r\n    then they were to find “an able secular priest, who is expert, and can\r\n    sing both pricke song and plain song, and hath a sight in descant, who\r\n    shall teach a free song school in Blackburn.” In all his masses he was\r\n    to pray for the good estate of the then Earl and Lady of Derby, and\r\n    their ancestors, and all benefactors to the chantry, quick or dead,\r\n    and for all Christian souls. And every Sunday and holiday in the\r\n    year, after his mass, he was to turn him to the people, and exhort\r\n    them to prayer for all the said persons, and to say “the salme _De\r\n    profundis_, with a _Paternoster_ and an _Ave Maria_, with special\r\n    suffrages after, and funeral collect, as well for the quick as for the\r\n    dead. And every Saturday and holiday he shall sing the masse of Our\r\n    Lady to note, and every quarter day he and his scholars shall sing a\r\n    solemn dirge for the souls aforesaid. And if the chantry priest shall\r\n    take any money or profit to say any trental, or otherwise to pray for\r\n    souls other than those specified in the present foundation, he shall\r\n    give half the profit towards the reparation or ornament of the said\r\n    chantry; and if he shall make default in any of his duties, he shall\r\n    pay 4_d._ for each such default, to be bestowed on the reparation and\r\n    ornamentation of the chantry.” In summer he was to say his masses at 8\r\n    a.m., and in winter at 10 a.m.[553]\r\n\r\n    So, in 1468, Richard Hammerton endowed a chantry in the chapel of Our\r\n    Lady and St. Anne, in the church of Long Preston, co. York, “that the\r\n    incumbent should pray for the soul of the founder, help to perform\r\n    divine service in the choir in time of necessity, teach a grammar and\r\n    song school to the children of the parish, make a special obit yearly\r\n    for the soul of the founder, distribute at the same time six shillings\r\n    to the poor in bread, and make a sermon by himself or deputy once a\r\n    year.”[554]\r\n\r\n    There were four chantries in Burnley Church, and belonging to the\r\n    Townley Chantry a _parva aula_, on the west side of the\r\n    churchyard,[555] occupied as a grammar school till 1695, when another\r\n    was erected in a more convenient situation.[556]\r\n\r\n    At Giggleswick, in Yorkshire, and at Tutthill, in the same county,\r\n    the rood chantry priest was required to be “sufficiently seen” in\r\n    plain song and grammar, and therefore, no doubt, was intended to teach\r\n    them.[557]\r\n\r\n    The gild priest of the Jesus Gild, Prittlewell, Essex, celebrated\r\n    daily at the altar of St. Mary, in the parish church, and had also\r\n    charge of the education of the youth of the parish.\r\n\r\n    Skipton Grammar School was founded in 1548. The appointment vested in\r\n    the vicar and churchwardens, for the time being. The master was to\r\n    teach certain Latin authors, to attend in the choir of the parish\r\n    church on all Sundays and festivals, and when service is performed by\r\n    prick song, unless hindered by some reasonable excuse; to celebrate\r\n    before seven in the morning on such days, and three other days in the\r\n    week; to be vested in a surplice, and sing or read as shall seem meet\r\n    to the vicar.[558]\r\n\r\n    In 1529 an act passed forbidding any one after Michaelmas to receive\r\n    any stipend for singing masses for the dead; some of the patrons\r\n    proceeded to seize upon the chantry lands and furniture. Another act\r\n    on the accession of Ed. VI., put all the colleges, chantries, free\r\n    chapels, and other miscellaneous “endowments for superstitious uses”\r\n    into the hands of the king, and commissioners were appointed to search\r\n    them out and take possession of them. Some few of the chapels which\r\n    had served outlying populations continued to exist and serve their\r\n    purpose, the endowments were ruthlessly confiscated, but the\r\n    inhabitants purchased the building of the crown or the grantee, and\r\n    subscribed among themselves to provide a scanty stipend for a\r\n    curate.[559]\r\n\r\n    Many of the grammar schools which were suppressed were refounded and\r\n    endowed as King Edward VI. Grammar Schools.\r\n\r\n    The Returns of the Commissioners are in the Record Office, and there\r\n    is an index to them arranged under counties. The Harleian MS., 605, in\r\n    the British Museum, is also a catalogue of gilds and chantries.\r\n\r\n    Here follow some notes, from these sources, of curious endowments--\r\n\r\n    Fernditch and at Ordell, Beds., for “a Lamp and a Drinking” in the\r\n    church.\r\n\r\n    Emberton, Bucks., “for a Drinking.”\r\n\r\n    Great Horkesley, Essex; Cranfield and Steventon, Beds.; for “a Drink\r\n    for the Poor.”\r\n\r\n    Uppingham, Rutland, for “a Drinking on Rogation Day.”\r\n\r\n    Wynge, Bucks., “for Bride Ale, Child Ale, Marriages, and Dirges, with\r\n    lawful games.”\r\n\r\n    Coventry, “for a preacher.”\r\n\r\n    Townley, Suffolk, for “a Lamp and watching the Sepulchre.”\r\n\r\n    Hempstead, Essex, “for discharging the Tax of the poor who may not\r\n    have to dispend yearly above 40_s._”\r\n\r\n    “For the Bead Roll,” at Barford, Beds., Chulgrave, Polloxhill,\r\n    Richmond, Sondon, Wichhampstead, Eston, Dorlaston.\r\n\r\n    “For finding a Conduit,” at St. Mary Aldermary.\r\n\r\n    “For repairing Roads and Bridges,” in several places.\r\n\r\n    “For the Poor,” in several places.\r\n\r\n    At Hendry and at Wingfield, Suffolk, “for setting out Soldiers.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nGILDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe voluntary societies or fraternities called “gilds,” which were\r\nnumerous all over Christian Europe in the Middle Ages, were established\r\nfor mutual help and comfort in the various exigencies of life--in\r\nsickness, old age, poverty (if not the result of misconduct), in wrongful\r\nimprisonment, in losses by fire, water, or shipwreck.[560] So far it was\r\na benefit club. But the gild had always a religious basis. It usually put\r\nitself under the name and protection of the Holy Trinity or of some saint.\r\nOnce a year, at least, it took measures to have a special service held on\r\nits behalf in church, which all the members attended, habited in the\r\nlivery of the gild; thence it proceeded to its hall or meeting-place for\r\nthe annual business meeting; and afterwards held its annual feast. The\r\nmutual help and comfort embraced the spiritual side of life, and included\r\nmutual prayers for the living and the dead. Especially, the gild made much\r\nof the burial of its members, which was conducted with great solemnity;\r\nall the members were bound to attend the funeral; and provision was made\r\nfor the continual offering of masses for the welfare of the living, and\r\nthe repose of their departed brothers and sisters.[561]\r\n\r\nThe trade gilds had for their chief aim the regulation and protection of\r\ntheir particular trade; their laws included the regulation of freemen,\r\napprentices, etc.; the quality, etc., of their goods; and constituted a\r\ntrade monopoly. But the trade gild always embraced the usual social and\r\nreligious features above mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe great trade gilds were often powerful and wealthy corporations; their\r\nmembers made bequests to them of lands and tenements; they used their\r\ncommercial talent and ready money in making purchases of other property\r\nwhich added to their corporate wealth. They built handsome gild halls as\r\nthe visible manifestation of their importance; all the members wore gowns\r\nof the same material, colour, and fashion; their officers, masters, and\r\nwardens were distinguished by great silver-gilt maces borne before them,\r\nand by chains and badges round their shoulders; they took pride in the\r\nsplendour of their pageantry in the public processions and functions. They\r\nprided themselves also on the value of their plate, mostly gifts from\r\ntheir own members, or gifts from great persons; on the sumptuousness of\r\ntheir hospitality; and also on the useful institutions which they\r\nmaintained--hospitals, schools, almshouses; on their gifts to the poor;\r\nand on their liberal contributions on great occasions of public need.\r\nSome of them had their own chapel, or at least constant special services\r\nin church, conducted by their own chaplain or chaplains.\r\n\r\n    Some of the gilds were organizations not so much for mutual benefit or\r\n    the regulation of trade as for the foundation and conduct of\r\n    enterprises for the benefit of the whole community; for promoting the\r\n    glory of God, and increasing the number of services and the means of\r\n    grace, for the population of the town; for founding a hospital or\r\n    grammar school; for building and repairing bridges and highways, and\r\n    the like.\r\n\r\n    The Gild at Ludlow had seven chaplains, and maintained also two\r\n    deacons and four choristers to sing divine service in the parish\r\n    church. It supported a grammar school, an almshouse for thirty-two\r\n    poor people, and bestowed liberal gifts on the poor.\r\n\r\n    The Kalendar Gild of Bristol dated from before the Norman Conquest. In\r\n    answer to inquiries made in 1387, the gild stated that in the twelfth\r\n    century it had founded a school for Jews and others, to be brought up\r\n    in Christianity, under the care of the said fraternity, which school\r\n    it still maintained.[562]\r\n\r\n    At York there was a Gild of the Lord’s Prayer. It arose in this way:\r\n    at some date unknown, but before the year 1387, a Miracle Play of the\r\n    Lord’s Prayer had been performed in York, in which all manner of vices\r\n    and sins were held up to scorn, and the virtues held up to praise. The\r\n    play met with so great favour that a gild was founded for the purpose\r\n    of keeping up the annual performance of the play. The gild had the\r\n    usual charitable and religious features; but, besides, the members\r\n    were bound to illustrate in their lives the scorn of vice and the\r\n    praise of virtue, which were the objects of the play, and to shun\r\n    company and business which were unworthy. The gild maintained a\r\n    candelabrum of seven lights to hang in York Minster, to be lighted on\r\n    all Sundays and feast days, in token of the seven supplications of the\r\n    Lord’s Prayer, to the honour and glory of Almighty God, the Maker of\r\n    that Prayer. And they maintained a tablet, showing the whole meaning\r\n    and use of the Lord’s Prayer, hanging against a pillar of the minster,\r\n    near the aforesaid candelabrum. Whenever the play was performed in\r\n    York, the gild were to ride with the players through the principal\r\n    streets, clad in one suit, and to keep order during the play.\r\n\r\n    The Corpus Christi Gild at York seems to have been founded by some of\r\n    the clergy specially for the purpose of organizing a great annual\r\n    function in honour of the Eucharist. On the day from which the gild\r\n    took its name, a great procession was made through the streets of the\r\n    city, headed by priests in surplices, and the six masters of the gild\r\n    bearing white wands; the craft gilds of the city followed, exhibiting\r\n    pageants. In 1415, ninety-six crafts took part in the procession, of\r\n    which fifty-four exhibited pageants of subjects from the Bible, and\r\n    ten carried torches. A great folio volume, now in the British Museum,\r\n    contains the roll of its brethren and sisters, of all ranks, about\r\n    14,850 in number. The two gilds of St. Christopher and St. George,\r\n    York, had a “Guylde Hall,” and maintained and repaired certain stone\r\n    bridges and highways, and gave relief to certain poor people, but “had\r\n    no spiritual promotion whereby the King should have firstfruits and\r\n    tenths.”[563] The Earl and Countess of Northumberland were brother\r\n    and sister of this gild, and their annual payment to it was 6_s._\r\n    8_d._ each, and 6_s._ 8_d._ more for their livery.[564]\r\n\r\n    St. George’s Gild at Norwich, founded in 1385, in close connection\r\n    with the corporation of the city, was another famous gild, numbering\r\n    thousands of brethren and sisters, among them some of the East Anglian\r\n    nobility. They had a stately equestrian procession, with pageants, on\r\n    St. George’s Day.\r\n\r\nChaucer has not overlooked this feature of the social life of his period.\r\nAmong the “Canterbury Pilgrims”--\r\n\r\n  An Haberdasher and a Carpenter,\r\n  A Webber, a Dyer, and a Tapeser,\r\n  Were all yclothed in o liverie\r\n  Of a solempne, and grete fraternity.\r\n\r\n    In 1404 the Gild of the Holy Trinity was established in Worcester by\r\n    Henry IV. The chantry which had been founded in the reign of Edward\r\n    III. was slightly altered from its original purpose; a perpetual\r\n    chantry of three monks was appointed to sing masses for the soul of\r\n    Henry, while the priest of the original foundation was required to\r\n    assist the parson and curator of the parish church, “because it doth\r\n    abound in houseling people,” as well as to sing mass at his own\r\n    altar.[565]\r\n\r\n    The bailiffs and commonalty of Birmingham in 1392, on the basis of a\r\n    chantry originally founded in the time of Henry II., founded the Gild\r\n    of the Holy Cross, with chaplains to celebrate Divine service in the\r\n    Church of St. Martin, for the town contained two thousand houseling\r\n    people; to keep in repair two great stone bridges and divers foul and\r\n    dangerous ways; to maintain almshouses for twelve poor persons, and\r\n    other charities. It built a great public hall, which was called\r\n    indifferently the Town Hall or the Gild Hall.[566]\r\n\r\nWe find in the “Calendar of Chantries,” etc., and also in the “Valor\r\nEcclesiasticus,” a number of endowed “services,” under the same kind of\r\nsaintly designation as the chantries, _e.g._ our Lady’s Service, St.\r\nAnne’s, St. Catherine’s, St. John’s, the Rood, Trinity, etc.; sometimes,\r\nalso, like some of the chantries, they are recorded under a surname, which\r\nit seems probable was that of the founder, as _e.g._ at Bristol, William’s\r\nService, Foster’s, Pollard’s, Jones’s, Henry’s, Forthey’s.\r\n\r\nThe payment for these services seems usually to have come through the\r\nhands of a warden or of feoffees, and we suppose that they were usually\r\nmaintained by a gild or fraternity.\r\n\r\n    At Our Lady’s altar in Rotherham Church, “divers well-disposed\r\n    persons” founded a chaplaincy to sing “mass of Our Lady every Saturday\r\n    at eight o’clock.” The Rood Chantry in Skipton Church was founded for\r\n    a priest to say mass “every day when he is disposed” (does not that\r\n    mean when he is not, as we say, indisposed, _i.e._ when he is not\r\n    hindered by sickness?), “at six in summer and seven in winter, for the\r\n    purpose that as well the inhabitants of the town as Kendal men and\r\n    strangers should hear the same.”\r\n\r\n    The mayor and his brethren at Pontefract provided a chaplain to survey\r\n    the amending of the highways, and to say the “morrow mass,” which was\r\n    over by 5 a.m. Also a chaplain of Our Lady to say mass at 8 a.m., and\r\n    another in the chantry of Our Lady in St. Giles’s Chapel-of-ease\r\n    there, to sing mass daily “for the ease of the inhabitants.” There was\r\n    also a “Rushworth chaplain” at St. Thomas’s Chantry, in the parish\r\n    church.\r\n\r\n    In Wakefield Church the parishioners ordained a “morrow mass” at 5\r\n    a.m. for all servants and labourers in the parish.\r\n\r\nThere was a strong likeness between chantries and services; but while the\r\nchief object of a chantry was to obtain prayers for the departed, and it\r\nwas only incidentally that it supplied additional opportunities of Divine\r\nworship, the service seems to have been intended specially to maintain an\r\nadditional and probably a grander public service for the glory of God and\r\nthe help of the spiritual life of the inhabitants of a parish or town,\r\nwhile prayers for the founders and benefactors were only a minor incident\r\nof the foundation. Here are a few notes on the stipends of the chaplains,\r\nthe hire of chapels for the services, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the “Calendar of Chantries,” etc., there are recorded 107 services, of\r\nwhich 64 are in Gloucestershire, 12 in Herefordshire, 7 in Chester, 5 in\r\nYorkshire, 4 in Shropshire, 3 in Derbyshire, 2 in Staffordshire, and 2 in\r\nSomerset, 1 each in Dorset, Durham, Essex, and Wilts, and 4 in Wales.\r\nThere are a few entries of “Stipendiaries of our Lady,” who were probably\r\npriests serving “Services of our Lady.”\r\n\r\nThere was a service in the parish church of St. Ellen, Worcester; the\r\nchaplain “_exercens_” the “_servicium_” of the Blessed Virgin there\r\nreceived by the hands of the wardens of the said “_servicium_,” 45_s._,\r\nand he received 75_s._ more from the benevolence and charity of the\r\nparishioners there. In the same church was a Service of St. Katharine, for\r\n“_exercens_” which the chaplain received from the wardens a clear stipend\r\nof £5 1_s._ 11½_d._[567]\r\n\r\nThe Vicar of Cirencester received payments from the Feoffees of the\r\nservice of the Name of Jesus for the use of a chapel, £6; from the wardens\r\nof the service of St. Christopher, for the use of a chapel, £6 0_s._\r\n5_d._; from the Feoffees of the Fraternity of St. Katharine, 9_s._ 9_d._;\r\nand from the Feoffees of the Fraternity of St. John Baptist, 17_s._ We\r\nhave already seen in the chapter on Chantries,[568] that in villages the\r\npeople sometimes provided services for themselves, which might be classed\r\nwith these.\r\n\r\nIn the fifteenth century every market town had one or more gilds,[569] not\r\nnecessarily with the costly adjuncts of a hall for their meetings, and a\r\nchaplain and services of their own in church, but each with its charities,\r\nand social customs, and always with its annual service and festival. Even\r\nin many villages and rural parishes a gild helped to draw neighbours\r\ntogether into friendly association, organized their charities, and\r\nstimulated their village festivities. Even the humblest of them had its\r\nlittle fund, formed by the annual subscriptions of the members, and\r\nperhaps a little “stock”[570] of a few cows or sheep fed on the common\r\npasture, the profit of which swelled the common fund of the gild, out of\r\nwhich they helped a member in a strait, and gave alms to their poor. They\r\nmade much of the funerals of their departed members, following them in a\r\nlong procession. The humblest had a few cooking utensils, and pots, and\r\npans, and pewter dishes and plates[571] for their convivial meetings, and\r\nperhaps a mazer with a silver rim as the loving cup, out of which they\r\ndrank to one another’s health and prosperity; and on their annual feast\r\nday the vicar said a special mass for them, and preached them a sermon.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of all these gilds on the pretext of their prayers for\r\ntheir deceased members, and the confiscation of their property (except in\r\nLondon, whose great Trading Gilds were too powerful to be meddled with),\r\nwas the very meanest and most inexcusable of the plunderings which threw\r\ndiscredit upon the Reformation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have some general reflections to make on these three chapters on\r\nDomestic Chaplains, Chantries, and Gilds.\r\n\r\nThe appropriation of so many parochial benefices to the religious houses\r\nin the twelfth century had greatly reduced the provision for the parochial\r\nclergy on whom the burden of the parochial care of the people rested. The\r\ninstitution during the thirteenth century of vicars in the appropriated\r\nparishes, with perpetuity of tenure, fixed endowment, and responsibility\r\nto the bishop, had done something to alleviate the evil. The institution\r\nof the orders of friars in the same thirteenth century had effected a\r\ngreat revival of religion; and when the work of the new order had settled\r\ndown to its normal level it still supplied a valuable auxiliary of\r\nreligion among the lower classes of the population. By the end of the\r\nthirteenth century things had settled down. Very few new monasteries were\r\nfounded after the twelfth century; very few friaries after the thirteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nOf the rural benefices many were in the hands of rectors in minor orders\r\nwho employed chaplains at such stipends as they could agree with them to\r\naccept. Many in the hands of absentee and pluralist rectors were similarly\r\nserved by parish chaplains. The remainder were served by vicars whose\r\nendowments we have seen were small. The natural result of such a state of\r\nthings must have been that a great proportion of the rural parishes were\r\ntaught and tended by vicars and parish chaplains who might be good men,\r\ndoing their duty to the best of their ability, but not always men of the\r\nbreeding and learning which would make them very suitable pastors for the\r\ncountry gentry and their families. It seems probable that, in the fashion\r\nwhich sprung up among the country gentry at the close of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and continued through the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, of\r\nfounding chantries, and entertaining domestic chaplains, the gentry were\r\nseeking to provide for themselves and their families additional and\r\nsometimes more acceptable spiritual teachers and guides. A wealthy lord\r\nsometimes met the difficulty by converting the parish church into a\r\ncollegiate church, with a considerable clerical staff adequately endowed.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient towns, we have seen the parishes were small and their\r\nendowments miserable. In the more modern towns, which had grown into great\r\ntowns, with the general increase of the population and its tendency then,\r\nas now, to gravitate into the towns, the one vicar of the one parish\r\nchurch was often quite unable to cope with the spiritual needs of a large\r\nand difficult flock; and the townspeople themselves sometimes made better\r\nprovision for their own spiritual needs. The gilds, which provided two or\r\nthree or half a dozen chaplains with singing boys to conduct service in\r\nthe parish church, were clearly providing for a more dignified service for\r\nthe honour of God than the vicar and his clerk could offer; the _Servicia_\r\ncalled by the name of this and that saint, seem to have been intended to\r\nmultiply the number of services for the greater convenience of the people.\r\nThe gild chaplains would certainly be expected to undertake special\r\npersonal ministrations--without infringing on the legal rights of the\r\nvicar--to the brothers and sisters of their gild. It is very interesting\r\nto see that the people thus set themselves to supplement the deficiencies\r\nof the ecclesiastical organization, by providing for their own spiritual\r\nneeds. It reminds us of the way in which, in more modern times, earnest\r\npeople supplied the deficiencies in the supply of their spiritual cravings\r\nby holding “prophecyings” in the time of Elizabeth, and by the foundation\r\nof lectureships in the parish churches in the time of the Georges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nTHE MEDIÆVAL TOWNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA typical mediæval town must have been wonderfully picturesque. As the\r\ntraveller came in sight of it at a little distance its grey embattled\r\nwalls, rising sheer out of the surrounding green meadows, were diversified\r\nin elevation and sky-line by projecting wall towers; and numerous spires\r\nand towers of churches appeared over the walls.[572]\r\n\r\nAs he rode nearer, the great gate tower, with its outwork the barbican,\r\nformed a picturesque architectural group, and spoke of the strength of the\r\ndefences of the town and the security of its inhabitants. He entered over\r\nsounding drawbridge, through the echoing vault of the gate; and so into\r\nnarrow streets of gabled timber houses, with overhanging upper stories,\r\ninterlacing beams, and quaint carvings and finials; past frequent\r\nchurches, hospitals, gild-halls; to the cross in the middle of the\r\nmarket-place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Micklegate Bar, York.]\r\n\r\nThe people he saw in the streets were in picturesque costumes of all\r\ncolours and fashions: a cavalcade of a knight, in flashing armour, with a\r\nsquire carrying his helm and spear and two or three yeomen in buff-coats\r\nand helmets behind him; a monk in his flowing black benedictine robe; a\r\ncouple of Franciscan Friars in their grey gowns rope-girdled; a parish\r\npriest or cantarist returning from his service; the citizens in dress\r\nwhich indicated their quality--some in their burgess gowns, others in the\r\nlivery of their gild; the shopmen at their open booths at work at their\r\ncraft and soliciting the passers-by, “What d’ye lack? What d’ye lack? Buy,\r\nbuy, buy, buy!” In the central market-place the traveller found crowds of\r\nthe country-people grouped round the market cross with their panniers of\r\ncountry produce, and the housekeepers of the town busily cheapening their\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen we apply ourselves to the consideration of the ecclesiastical history\r\nof the towns, we have to bear in mind their various origins. Nearly all\r\nthe towns which the Romans left when they evacuated the Province of\r\nBritain were stormed and sacked by the Teutonic invaders, and left ruined\r\nand empty. But as the Saxon settlers grew in numbers, wealth, and\r\ncivilization, the force of circumstances must have led to the reoccupation\r\nof a number of these towns; for some were at the natural harbours, some at\r\nconvenient points on the lines of internal traffic; and so new towns of\r\ntimber houses arose within the old Roman walls. Other towns of later\r\norigin grew up about the chief residence of a Saxon king, or, later still,\r\nof a Norman noble; or about a cathedral or great monastery; later still,\r\nat the convenient centre of the trade of a fertile district, or where\r\nnatural advantages encouraged the growth of a manufacture.\r\n\r\nThe parochial history of the towns is very obscure. The facts point to the\r\nconclusion that the origin of parishes here was the same as in the\r\ncountry. There the lord of an estate built a church and provided a\r\nmaintenance for a priest to minister to his family and dependents; and the\r\npriest’s spiritual authority was conterminous with the area of his\r\npatron’s civil jurisdiction; _i.e._ the estates were the parishes. The\r\nancient towns, it is found, were frequently divided between several\r\nprincipal proprietors, who had rights of jurisdiction over their own land\r\nand the people living on it. The facts seem to indicate that the lords of\r\nthese sokes, or peculiar jurisdictions, usually--like a country thane in\r\nhis manor--built a church, and provided a maintenance for a priest to\r\nminister to his own family and people; and that these sokes became the\r\nparishes of the town.\r\n\r\nThe great landowners of Saxon or Norman times very frequently had a\r\nresidence in the chief town of the county in which their principal estates\r\nwere situated; a custom which continued so long that it is not yet\r\nforgotten how the great county families used to have their houses in their\r\ncounty town. But the residence of a great Saxon or Norman lord was the\r\nhome of a numerous household, and the lord’s dignity required that he\r\nshould have a chapel and a priest of his own. This perhaps is the\r\nexplanation of the fact that there were numerous chapels in many of the\r\noldest towns.\r\n\r\nIn borough towns the community of burgesses, it is probable, usually made\r\nprovision for the religious wants of that part of the population which was\r\nnot in any of the peculiar jurisdictions above mentioned, or within the\r\nwalls of the residences of the nobles; and we find groups of burgesses,\r\nand individual burgesses, possessing a church, in the sense of having the\r\nrights and responsibilities of patrons. The result of this origin of town\r\nparishes was that many of the older towns had a number of parish churches\r\nwhich seems to us out of all proportion to the number of their population;\r\nit was never a question of how many churches were needed for a town of\r\nsuch-and-such a population; the question was how many lords there were who\r\nfelt bound, in their own opinion and that of the time, to provide for\r\nDivine worship and pastoral care for their own people.[573]\r\n\r\nA few actual examples will illustrate these general observations.\r\n\r\nNORWICH, at the end of the Saxon period, was one of the greatest towns in\r\nthe kingdom, containing 1320 burgesses. The king, Archbishop Stigand in\r\nprivate property, and Earl Harold were the principal lords. The king’s\r\nburgesses had two churches in the burgh and one-sixth of a third church;\r\nthe earl’s tenants had the Church of All Saints; and Stigand had two\r\nchurches, St. Michael’s and St. Martin’s. The burgesses held fifteen\r\nchurches; and twelve burgesses held Holy Trinity Church (the Conqueror\r\nafterwards gave it to the Bishop of the Diocese); the Abbot of St. Edmund\r\nhad a house and the mediety of the Church of St. Lawrence. The Church of\r\nSS. Simon and Jude was held successively by Aylmer, the last Saxon bishop,\r\nand by Herbert, the first Norman bishop, and by Bishop William, who came\r\nafter him, and must therefore have belonged to the see. The Domesday\r\nSurvey also enters forty-three chapels as belonging to the burgesses at\r\nthe time of the Survey, of the existence of which, in King Edward’s time,\r\nthere is no mention; and yet Norwich had suffered much in the political\r\nchanges of the time, the number of its burgesses being reduced to half\r\ntheir number in the time of King Edward.\r\n\r\nIt seems clear that each owner of a separate jurisdiction or soke, king,\r\nearl, Stigand, bishop, and abbot, had a church for his own people; that\r\nthe burgesses as a community had provided fifteen other churches in the\r\ntown, that another church was held by a group of twelve burgesses,\r\nassociated, perhaps, in a gild, and making provision for their own\r\nspiritual needs. There were, thus, at least twenty-five churches in Saxon\r\ntimes; in the Conqueror’s time Domesday Book enumerates fifty-four\r\nchurches and chapels; at the end of the thirteenth century, the “Taxatio”\r\nrecords forty-five; and just before the Reformation, the “Valor” names the\r\ncathedral, the collegiate church of St. Mary in the Fields, the two\r\nhospitals of St. Giles, Tombland, the rectory of SS. Edward, Julian, and\r\nClement, thirty-seven vicarages, and one free chapel of St.\r\nKatharine.[574]\r\n\r\nOf the parochial history of LONDON very little is known. At the end of the\r\nSaxon period the Church of St. Paul seems to have been surrounded by a few\r\nchapels under the jurisdiction of the Cathedral body, and served by\r\nChaplains. St. Peter, Cornhill, seems to have been the church of the\r\nbishop’s soke. A number of churches seem to have been built in the twelfth\r\ncentury by owners of property, of whom several were priests:--“There can\r\nbe little doubt that St. Martin Orgars, and St. Botolph, Bishopsgate,\r\nwere built by Orgar, a wealthy alderman; and that St. John Zachary,\r\nSt. Andrew Hubbard, St. Katharine Colman, St. Benet Fink, St. Lawrence\r\nPountney, and other names affixed to churches, commemorate founders,\r\nbuilders, or restorers, chiefly of the early part of the twelfth century.\r\nIn the time of Henry I., the chapter assigned a parish to the Church of\r\nSt. Mary Magdalene, Milk Street, of which one Geoffrey, a priest, was the\r\nowner, and his son Bartholomew his successor.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NORWICH, FROM G.

A.D. 1573.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Environs of London, reproduced from a fragmentary tapestry\r\nmap executed at Weston, Warwickshire, circ. 1570.]\r\n\r\n“Many of those parish churches were of very modest dimensions, some of\r\nthem only chapels to the great house by whose lord they were built. The\r\nsteeple and chancel of All Hallows the Less stood over the gateway of Cold\r\nHarbour, the parish being, in fact, the estate of the Pountney family, and\r\ndivided by them from All Hallows the Great. St. Mary Cole Church was over\r\nthe gateway of the hospital of St. Thomas of Acon in Cheap. St. Mildred\r\nPoultry, and St. John, were both built on arches over the Wallbrook.”[575]\r\n\r\nOf several other churches the founders are known: the canons of St. Martin\r\nbuilt St. Leonard and St. Vedast; the Grey Friars of Newgate Street built\r\nSt. Ewen and St. Nicholas; Robert the son of Ralph the son of Herluin\r\nbuilt St. Michael le Querne; Alfune, the friend of Rahere, founder of St.\r\nBartholomew’s, built St. Giles, and Aelmund the priest, with his son Hugh,\r\ngave it to St. Paul’s.\r\n\r\nThere are indications of the subdivision of parishes, probably as a\r\nconsequence of the subdivision of properties by inheritance or sale. Thus\r\nSt. Mary Aldermary seems to have been the original church of a parish\r\nwhich was afterwards subdivided, the original dedication being retained in\r\nthe new churches, but with some distinctive affix, as St. Mary le Bow, St.\r\nMary Abchurch, St. Mary Woolnoth, St. Mary Woolchurch, St. Mary Bothaw,\r\nSt. Mary Colechurch, St. Mary Aldermanbury, and St. Mary Staining; All\r\nHallows the Great and the Less already mentioned; St. Nicholas Olave, and\r\nSt. Nicholas Cole Abbey; St. Katharine Colman, and St. Katharine Cree.\r\n\r\nThere is a church dedicated to St. Botolph at each of four of the city\r\ngates: Aldersgate, Bishopsgate, Aldgate, and Billingsgate.\r\n\r\nWm. FitzStephen, in his biography of Becket, states that, in his time,\r\nLondon possessed 13 conventual, and 126 parish churches.\r\n\r\nFabyan’s “Chronicle,” A.D. 1516, gives the sum of the parish churches\r\nwithin London as 113; houses of religion and others being not parish\r\nchurches, 27; in Westminster and other places around the city, including\r\nSouthwark, without the walls, 28; the sum of all the Divine houses within\r\nthe city and without, 168.\r\n\r\nLastly, we get valuable suggestions as to the source of the incomes of the\r\ntown clergy. In London, the parochial clergy had no tithe and glebe land;\r\ntheir incomes were derived from customary payments, called donations,\r\nwhich had been paid time out of mind from the houses and shops in\r\nproportion to their rent. In consequence of some disputes, they were\r\ninquired into and confirmed by Bishop Roger, about A.D. 1230, and amounted\r\nto about 3_s._ 6_d._ in the pound of the rent. The clergy received,\r\nbesides, fees for services on many occasions; what these were we learn\r\nfrom some proceedings in the Star Chamber in 1534--\r\n\r\n    For _Weddings_: Laid on the book, 8_d._; three tapers, 3_d._; and the\r\n    whole offering at mass. If married before high mass, 20_d._, or\r\n    40_d._, or 60_d._, or more. For a certificate when the man dwelt in\r\n    another parish, 12_d._, or 20_d._, or 40_d._, according to ability.\r\n\r\n    For _Burials_: 12_d._ or more, and every priest in the church, 8_d._\r\n    or more, or they do not sing him to his burial. At every month’s mind,\r\n    year’s mind, or obit, the curate has 8_d._ or 12_d._, all the wax\r\n    tapers and wax branches used at the funeral; for privy tithes, 20_d._,\r\n    or 40_d._, or 5_s._, or 20_s._, or 40_s._, or more. To the high altar\r\n    as much for personal tithe. If buried out of his parish, the corpse\r\n    must first be presented in his own church with dirge and mass. For\r\n    burial in the chancel or high quire, 10_s._ to 40_s._, or more.\r\n\r\n    For _Churchings_: For every Sunday when the woman lieth in for saying\r\n    a gospel, 1_d._ or 2_d._; at purification the taper, 1_d._, with the\r\n    chrisome, and the whole offering by all the women at mass, 2_d._\r\n\r\n    _Beadroll_: If any will have his friends prayed for in the beadroll,\r\n    the curate hath by year 4_d._, or 8_d._, or more.\r\n\r\n    _At Easter_: Of men’s wives, children, and apprentices, for their\r\n    communion at Easter, for every head, 2_d._\r\n\r\n    _Tithes of Servants’ Wages_: The tenth part and for their housel at\r\n    Easter, 1_d._ At all principal feasts divers offer, some wax, some\r\n    money, which comes to the parson’s use.\r\n\r\n    Where a Saint’s image stands without the quire to which a Brotherhood\r\n    belongeth, the wardens of the brotherhood compound some for 3_s._\r\n    4_d._, 5_s._, 6_s._ 8_d._, or more, per annum, to have the Brotherhood\r\n    kept in the Church (see p. 482).\r\n\r\n    The lords reduced the tithes on houses to 2_s._ 9_d._ in the pound,\r\n    but confirmed the above customary fees and payments.[576]\r\n\r\nThe ancient city of EXETER became the see of the Devonshire Bishopric in\r\n1049-50, when Bishop Leofric moved thither from Crediton; and seems at the\r\ntime of the Norman Conquest to have had its cathedral church and a number\r\nof chapels. A religious foundation of Gytha was granted by the Conqueror\r\nto Battle Abbey; it received additional endowments, and grew into a\r\nconsiderable priory, still receiving its priors from the parent house, and\r\npaying a pension to it. A second small alien Priory of St. James was\r\nfounded without the walls. The Castle Chapel was a detached building with\r\nnave and aisle, and was served by three prebends with no dean or head, and\r\nthe patronage was attached to the Barony of Okehampton. The bishops had an\r\nalmshouse perhaps from the days of Leofric; in 1170 a citizen founded a\r\nhospital of St. Alexius; and the two were in 1225 merged in the hospital\r\nof St. John by the East Gate. A leper hospital was founded outside the\r\nSouth Gate, and its inmates were forbidden to enter the city. A convent of\r\nFranciscans was founded between 1220 and 1240, and a convent of Dominicans\r\nabout the same time.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the thirteenth century there seems to have been some\r\narrangement of the parochial organization of the city. For in the reign\r\nof King John, we learn from the will of Peter de Paterna and Isabel his\r\nwife, who bequeathed 1_d._ to each of them, that there were twenty-eight\r\nchapels in the city of Exeter. In the year 1222 there was a settlement of\r\nthe parish churches which were fixed at the number of 19.[577] The names\r\nof all these parish churches are found in the list of chapels previously\r\nexisting, and some of the chapels are not included among the parish\r\nchurches.[578]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXETER, FROM G. BRAUN’S URBIUM PRAECIPUARUM MUNDI THEATRUM,\r\nLIB. 5, pl. 1. A.D. 1573.]\r\n\r\nBRISTOL affords us an example of a town whose ecclesiastical organization\r\ngrew with the gradual increase of the town, in a way which can be more or\r\nless clearly made out. Bristol was a member of the Royal Manor of Barton.\r\nAt an early date, probably in Heptarchic times, a town grew up on the\r\npeninsula between the river Avon and its tributary the Frome; the\r\nexistence of silver pennies of Ethelred the Unready, which were coined\r\nhere, shows that it was at that time a burgh with the usual privilege of a\r\nmint. The reader will remember that it was the principal seaport of the\r\nwestern coast, and the principal emporium of the slave-trade in Saxon men,\r\nwomen, and children until Bishop Wulstan succeeded with difficulty in\r\nsuppressing the nefarious traffic.\r\n\r\nThe Church of St. Peter is said by tradition to have been the earliest\r\nchurch in Bristol; and there are reasons for thinking that it actually was\r\nthe church provided by the Crown as lord of the manor for the use of its\r\ntenants there. The dedication of St. Werburg indicates that this church\r\nwas also of Saxon date. The burgh was divided by two main streets,\r\ncrossing at right angles in the middle of the town; the churches of St.\r\nEwan, All Saints, and Holy Trinity (or Christ Church), stand in the angles\r\nmade by the Carfax, and their parishes meet at this point, as though there\r\nhad been a considerable addition to the population of the burgh, and the\r\ncross roads had been made, the parishes marked out, and the three churches\r\nbuilt simultaneously.\r\n\r\nThe Conquest was followed by an age of church-building in Bristol; the\r\nBishop of Coutances built a castle with a chapel, outside the town on the\r\neast; new Norman lords rebuilt some of the parish churches. The new church\r\nof St. Mary le Port was built by William, Earl of Gloucester, before 1176.\r\nRobert, Earl of Gloucester, founded a Benedictine Priory outside the town,\r\non the north. A little later Robert Fitz-Harding founded a Convent of\r\nAugustinian Canons on the other side of the River Frome, west of the town.\r\nA small nunnery was founded in 1173 by Eva, wife of W. Fitz-Harding, who\r\nbecame the first abbess. The first part of the thirteenth century was a\r\ntime of great religious activity, and now and henceforth the work was done\r\nnot by royal and noble founders, but by the zeal of the people themselves.\r\nA Dominican Friary[579] was founded in 1230, just outside the suburb east\r\nof the castle; the Carmelites were planted in “the fairest of the houses\r\nof the friars” (Leland), where Colston’s Hall now stands; the Franciscans\r\nin the suburb beyond the Frome on the north-west; and there was a hospital\r\nof Bonhommes, now the mayor’s chapel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRISTOL, FROM G. BRAUN’S URBIUM PRAECIPUARUM TOTIUS MUNDI,\r\nLIB. III, pl. 2. A.D. 1573.]\r\n\r\nIn course of time some of these foundations attracted groups of people\r\nabout them, whose houses grew into suburbs of the town. One suburb grew up\r\naround the castle on the south-east, and the spiritual wants of its people\r\nwere supplied by the building among them of the new church of SS.\r\nPhilip and James.[580] Another group of people settled about the priory,\r\non the north, and attended service in the nave of the priory church, until\r\nat length the monks separated off the nave from the choir, and abandoned\r\nit to the people as their parish church, which still exists. The Austin\r\nCanons attracted still another group who formed a suburb on the\r\nsouth-west; and after a while the canons built the Church of St. Augustine\r\nthe Less for their tenants.[581]\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Henry III. the townspeople enlarged their limits by\r\nenclosing a tract on the south within a new wall. The new space was\r\ngradually filled with streets of houses, and St. Stephen’s Church seems to\r\nhave been built for the use of this new quarter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bristol Cathedral.]\r\n\r\nBristol grew not only by the enlargement of its own borders, but by the\r\nannexation of adjoining districts, which already had their own civil\r\njurisdictions and ecclesiastical organizations. On the other side of the\r\nAvon were two districts which had been growing in population and\r\ncommercial importance. One of these was the estate which Robert, Earl of\r\nGloucester, had given in 1145 to the Knights of the Temple; its parish\r\nchurch was dedicated to the Holy Cross; and there was a house of Austin\r\nFriars within the parish. Adjoining the Temple Fee lay the Manor of\r\nRedcliff, in Bedminster, belonging to the Fitz-Hardings, with its chapel\r\nof St. Thomas, first mentioned in 1232. By the end of the twelfth century\r\nBristol had, after a sort, spread itself over both Temple and Redcliffe,\r\nand a charter of 1188 included them in the privileges granted to Bristol.\r\nIn 1240 a stone bridge was built which connected the two sides of the\r\nriver; and a new wall and ditch from one angle of the river to the other\r\n(see the plan) enclosed the two districts on the southern side, and bound\r\nthem by a series of fortifications, continuous with those of the northern\r\nside, into one great town. The necessary legal measures incorporated the\r\ngroups into one borough.\r\n\r\nThe Bristol merchants were wealthy and magnificent. The great merchant\r\nCanynges rebuilt the greater part of the noble Church of St. Mary\r\nRedcliffe; others adorned the town, and added to its religious\r\nopportunities by founding chapels for special services; others built\r\nhospitals and almshouses; others founded chantries in various churches.\r\nThus the vill of the Saxon kings, with its one church, grew at last into\r\nthe great city which at the time of the Reformation possessed the list of\r\necclesiastical foundations named below with references to the plan.[582]\r\n\r\nYORK may well be taken as a typical cathedral town. The high altar of the\r\ngreat Minster Church stood directly over the well in which Edwin the first\r\nChristian King of the Northumbrians and his thanes were baptized. The\r\nfirst Norman archbishop rebuilt the church and reorganized its chapter\r\nwith a dean, precentor, chancellor, and treasurer, 36 prebendaries, and 36\r\nvicars choral. By the end of the fifteenth century the chantries numbered\r\nabout 60; and 36 chantry priests were incorporated into a community, and\r\nlived in St. William’s College, which was originally the prebendal house\r\nof the Prior of Hexham.\r\n\r\nThe Benedictine Abbey of St. Mary was founded near the cathedral between\r\n1080 and 1090, and there were two other Benedictine foundations in the\r\ncity early in the twelfth century, the Priory of Holy Trinity in\r\nMicklegate, and the little nunnery of Clementhorpe, and also the\r\nPremonstratensian House of St. Andrew.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: York Minster--south-west view.]\r\n\r\nSt. Leonard’s Hospital was a grand foundation by Athelstan, after his\r\ngreat northern victory in 936, to enable the cathedral clergy to relieve\r\nthe needy and maintain hospitality. In 1280 it had an income of nearly\r\n£11,000 (perhaps equal to £200,000 of modern money), and had in its\r\ninfirmary 229 men and women, and in its orphanage 23 boys. In 1293 it gave\r\naway every week at the gate 232 loaves and 256 herrings; it distributed\r\nevery Sunday 33 dinners and 14 gallons of beer, and 8 dinners for lepers,\r\nand to every prisoner in the castle (at that time 310) a small loaf. It\r\nmaintained 26 obits in commemoration of benefactors.\r\n\r\nAnother hospital, St. Mary Magdalene, was founded by the Dean of York,\r\n1330, for a master, two chaplains, and six infirm or aged priests. There\r\nwas a hospital for lepers at St. Nicholas, on the Hull Road. All the\r\nguilds had small almshouses attached. At the gate of every religious house\r\na daily distribution of gifts to the poor was made. There were many\r\nbeggars, who were put under charge of four headmen.\r\n\r\nIt was the principal and most populous city of the north, and in 1377 its\r\npopulation was about 11,000. In the reign of Henry V. there were forty-one\r\nparish churches, none of any considerable size, and a large number of\r\nchapels. The number of its clergy, regular and secular, was not less than\r\n500.[583]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the mediæval period we learn from the “Valor” that few of\r\nthe incumbents of the parishes of the city of York had any income besides\r\npersonal tithes (_i.e._ the Easter dues), and the oblations of the “three\r\ndays” then customary, and casual oblations; out of which some of them had\r\nto pay pensions to the Convent of St. Mary.\r\n\r\n    _E.g._ the Rector of St. Michael by Ouse Bridge had personal tithe\r\n    £10, and casual oblations 20_s._ = £11; out of which he had to pay a\r\n    pension to St. Mary’s Abbey of 36_s._, for synodals to the archbishop\r\n    5_s._ 4_d._, to the archdeacon for procuration 6_s._ 8_d._, leaving\r\n    him net £8 12_s._ The Rector of St. Cross, Fossgate, had personal\r\n    tithe in Lent time £7 8_s._, casual oblations 6_s._ 8_d._, oblations\r\n    on the two days customary there, 22_s._--total £8 16_s._ 8_d._, out of\r\n    which he had to pay 20_s._ to St. Mary’s Abbey, 3_s._ 6_d._ synodals,\r\n    and 6_s._ 8_d._ procuration, leaving clear income of £7 6_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\nIPSWICH in King Edward’s time had 538 burgesses; the Church of Holy\r\nTrinity, two dedicated to St. Mary, and the Churches of St. Michael, St.\r\nBotolph, St. Lawrence, St. Peter, and St. Stephen are mentioned in\r\nDomesday; three of these belonged to priests, and others were in lay\r\npatronage; Culling, a burgess, had one of the St. Maries; Lefflet, a\r\nfreewoman, had St. Lawrence; Roger de Ramis held a church dedicated to St.\r\nGeorge, with four burgesses and six wasted mansions; Aluric, the son of\r\nRolf, a burgess (and also a vavasor, holding lands in Suffolk), had the\r\nChurch of St. Julian; five burgesses belonged to the Church of St. Peter;\r\nWalter the Deacon held five houses and three waste mansions.[584]\r\n\r\n    In the “Taxatio” the following is the value of the\r\n    benefices:--Caldwell, £4 13_s._ 4_d._; St. Clement, £6 13_s._ 4_d._;\r\n    St. Margaret, £4 13_s._ 4_d._; St. Mary at the Tower, £3 6_s._ 8_d._;\r\n    St. Lawrence, £3 6_s._ 8_d._; St. Mary Hulme, £1; St. Nichl.\r\n    (Michael?), £1 10_s._; St. Peter, £4; Stoke, £10. The Priory had at\r\n    the Reformation an income of £88 6_s._ 9_d._; St. Ellen was worth £8\r\n    13_s._ 7_d._; St. Stephen, £4 12_s._ 8_d._; Stoke, £12; St. Matthew,\r\n    £5; the Daundy chantry[585] in St. Lawrence worth £6 10_s._ 8_d._\r\n\r\nIn 1177 a convent of Austin Canons was founded in the Church of Holy\r\nTrinity, and shortly afterwards another convent of the same order in the\r\nChurch of St. Peter; and in course of time all the parishes of the town,\r\nexcept Stoke, which was on the other side of the river, were appropriated\r\nto one or other of these two convents. Only one new parish church of St.\r\nMatthew sprang up between the Conquest and the Reformation. A Convent of\r\nDominican Friars was founded here in 1270, and gained so much acceptance\r\namong the better classes that most of the great people of the town were\r\nburied in its cemetery. The Franciscan Friars were established here in\r\n1297.[586] There were also three leper hospitals in the town, and an\r\nalmshouse, and one chantry in the Church of St. Lawrence.[587]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn not a few cases a great abbey was the origin of the existence of a\r\ntown. Peterborough, St. Edmund’s Bury, and St. Alban’s, carry the fact in\r\ntheir names; and there are many others, as Burton, Wenlock, etc., etc. The\r\nabbey employed labourers and artificers, who settled in a convenient site\r\nunder its shadow. If near a high-road, there was a frequent coming and\r\ngoing of travellers of various ranks, who halted for the night, and\r\nperhaps remained for a day or two. The abbey would be sure to obtain for\r\nits rising town the grant of a weekly market and annual fair. The abbey\r\nwas the landlord of the ground on which the town was gradually growing;\r\nand a wise abbot would encourage the settlement of people in his burgh,\r\nbuild houses, make roads, maintain bridges, build churches, and provide\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nThen there came a time when the citizens of the towns of England sought to\r\nobtain release from feudal claims and jurisdictions, and the right of\r\nself-government; the kings encouraged the rising municipalities, seeing in\r\nthem allies for the Crown against the nobles, and gave them charters\r\nfreely; and the citizens in many cases bought out the manorial rights of\r\nprivate owners. But bishops and monasteries, while not unwilling to give\r\ntheir tenants the right of association into gilds for the regulation of\r\ntheir trades, were unwilling to resign the rights and jurisdiction which\r\nthey had exercised from the beginning in their lordship. We add two or\r\nthree illustrations of the ecclesiastical life of towns founded by bishops\r\nand abbots.\r\n\r\nThe Benedictine Abbey of Burton was founded by Ulfric Spot, Earl of\r\nMercia, about 1002, and endowed with so many manors that it was as great\r\nas a barony. Abbot Bernard (1160-1175) built a church for the use of the\r\npeople who had settled outside the abbey. Abbot Nicholas, who died in\r\n1187, founded BURTON BURGH, and built the first street there. Abbot\r\nMelburne, who died in 1210, enlarged the town from the great bridge of\r\nBurton (over the Trent), to the new bridge (over the Dove) towards\r\nHorninglowe, and gave the citizens a charter, and established a fair and\r\nmarket. Abbot Lawrence (1228-1260), in a time of fire and flood, took no\r\nrent from the people. Abbot John, of Stafford, who died 1280, made the\r\nBurgh from Bradwaie to Berele Crosse, built the Monks’ Bridge over the\r\nDove, and made (_seldas in foro_) shops in the market-place. Abbot Bernard\r\nbuilt the great bridge of thirty-six arches over the Trent, with a chapel\r\nat one end of it. It was one of the longest bridges in England--five\r\nhundred and fifteen yards long.[588] And during a great famine in 1286,\r\nAbbot Thomas Pakington found the people employment and wages in building a\r\nnew quarter from Cattestrete through the middle of Siwarmore to\r\nHikanelstrete; and built a Chapel of St. Modwen adjoining the abbey,\r\nwhich, after the Reformation, became the parish church. In the time of\r\nAbbot William Matthew, who died 1430, the high town was paved with a\r\ngutter in the middle, and the _novus vicus_ in front of the abbey gates.\r\n\r\nThe provision which the abbey made for the tenants of its burgh were the\r\nparish church and the Chapel of St. Modwen; and these seem to have been\r\nalways served from the monastery; for, in the “Valor” there seems to be no\r\nVicar of Burton, but the convent received from the parish church, in\r\ntithes and oblations, £32[589] a year, and from offerings at the Chapel of\r\nSt. Modwenne, 40_s._\r\n\r\nThe “Valor” speaks of a suburb appropriated to the serfs of the abbey,\r\n“Vicus Nativorum.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Abbey Gateway, Bury St Edmund’s.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe church and religious house which King Sigebert of the East Angles\r\nbuilt at Bedericsworth was of little importance till the royal martyr, St.\r\nEdmund, was buried there; and a great monastery was built by Canute on the\r\nspot in honour of the royal saint of East Anglia. In its most flourishing\r\ntime the monastery is said to have had 80 Benedictine monks, 15 chaplains\r\nof the abbot and chief officials, 111 servants, and 40 priests of chapels,\r\nchantries, and monastic appendages in the town. The town which gradually\r\ngrew up beside the abbey came to be known as the BURY OF ST. EDMUND. Its\r\nprincipal streets are straight and at right angles with one another like a\r\ntown planned and built by the proprietor of the whole site. The abbey\r\nbuildings had swallowed up the original Saxon church, and the people\r\nattended service in the nave of the abbey church, till Abbot Anselm,\r\nwishing, it is said, to be rid of the townspeople out of the abbey church,\r\nbuilt the Church of St. James for them in 1125. Soon after a second Church\r\nof St. Mary was built by the sacrist at the south-west corner of the abbey\r\ncemetery. The abbey appointed the parish priests, and built a college for\r\nthe parochial clergy. It derived from its rectorial rights at the time of\r\nthe Reformation, as given in the “Valor,” from St. Mary’s £16 10_s._\r\n9½_d._, and from St. James’s £18.\r\n\r\nAs the monastery had created the town, so it ruled it without opposition\r\ntill the desire for civil liberties which stirred the minds of the people\r\nled some of the younger townsmen to unite themselves under colour of a\r\ngild, the Gild of Bachelors, or young men, to endeavour to obtain\r\nmunicipal rights for the town. In 1264 they closed the town gates against\r\nan official of the abbey, and engaged in riotous proceedings, when the\r\nabbot appealed to the Crown. The more prudent burghers got frightened, and\r\nsuppressed the Bachelors’ Gild. They kept up, however, a chronic quarrel,\r\nwhich culminated in open rebellion; in 1327 the townspeople broke into the\r\nabbey, and compelled the abbot to concede the liberties they sought. But\r\nthe king strengthened the armed force at the command of the abbot, and the\r\ntownsmen were obliged five years after to renounce their claim, and sue\r\nfor pardon.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that where a great monastery was the lord of the town\r\nthere was no possibility of a rival monastery, and the monks did not\r\nwelcome the friars into their neighbourhood.[590] The abbot supplied\r\nhospitals and such-like things as they were needed; here, at St. Edmund’s,\r\nthere were four hospitals at its four gates, founded by different abbots,\r\nfor the entertainment of poor pilgrims. During a vacancy in the abbacy\r\nhere some Franciscans took the opportunity to establish themselves in a\r\nhouse in the north part of the town; but the new abbot got rid of them in\r\nthe peremptory way in which a landlord gets rid of a contumacious\r\ntenant--he pulled the house down over their heads. The friars appealed to\r\nRome; the pope directed the archbishop, and the archbishop sent his\r\ncommissaries, to conduct them into a new habitation in the west quarter of\r\nthe town; but the monks drove out both the Episcopal Commissaries and\r\ntheir clients. The king sent down the chief justice to give them\r\npossession of a new site, but the monks did not submit to the chief\r\njustice, and made good their opposition. At length a compromise was\r\narrived at, and the friars were allowed to settle “outside the Four\r\nCrosses,” which marked the Liberties of St. Edmund for a mile in every\r\ndirection.[591]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOffa, the great King of the Mercians, in the eighth century, is said to\r\nhave “discovered” the relics of St. Alban, the Proto-Martyr of Britain,\r\nand built a monastery to contain them on the site of the martyrdom. A\r\npopulation gathered around the monastery. The founding of ST. ALBAN’S TOWN\r\nis ascribed to Usinus, the sixth abbot, in the tenth century. He is said\r\nto have built three parish churches for the people: St. Michael’s, St.\r\nPeter’s, and St. Stephen’s, on the north, south, and west sides of the\r\nabbey, and established a market for them. From Domesday it appears that\r\nthe town was then part of the possessions of the abbey, and was held by\r\nthe abbey in demesne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: St. Albans.]\r\n\r\nEarly in the fourteenth century, the inhabitants tried to relieve\r\nthemselves from this hereditary jurisdiction, and wrested from Abbot\r\nEversden (1308-1326) the right to elect two of their number to represent\r\nthem in Parliament; but a little later Abbot Richard of Wallingford\r\n(1326-1334) successfully disputed his predecessor’s concessions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLastly, we have the case of the towns which grew up from small towns to\r\ngreat ones, in the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. In\r\nthis case the town often was, and continued to be, a manor, the lord\r\nexercising the old feudal jurisdiction and maintaining his manorial\r\nrights; the affairs of the people being regulated by the manorial courts.\r\nIn these cases there was usually only one parish church, and we have to\r\nsee the way in which, as the town grew, additional provision was made for\r\nthe increasing population. One method was by the conversion of the parish\r\nchurch into a collegiate foundation with a staff of three or four\r\nclergymen, and choir men and boys, for the maintenance of a dignified\r\nservice--this was usually done by some one pious benefactor, as at\r\nManchester, Wingham, and Wye.[592] Another method was for the parishioners\r\nto provide the vicar with a staff of chaplains, and to endow special\r\nservices, as at Sheffield and Newark. Each of these methods may be\r\nillustrated by a brief history of the examples named.\r\n\r\nDomesday Survey records the existence of two churches in MANCHESTER of\r\nwhich it is probable that one, St. Mary’s, was the parish church of the\r\ntown; and the other, St. Michael’s, a dependent church at\r\nAshton-under-Lyne. In the fourteenth century it was one of the most\r\nwealthy and populous towns in the county of Lancaster; and since the\r\npriest of the place is sometimes called the Dean of Manchester, it was\r\nperhaps the head of an extensive deanery. Its church was of timber, as\r\nthat of Marston, in Cheshire, is to this day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Manchester Cathedral.]\r\n\r\nThomas la Ware, second son of Roger Lord la Ware, was rector in 1398, when\r\nby the death of his elder brother he succeeded to the Barony of la Ware,\r\nwhich included the manor. Desiring to make better provision for the\r\ninhabitants of the town, he obtained a licence from King Henry V., in\r\n1421, to convert the parish church into a collegiate church, with a warden\r\nand so many fellows as should seem good to the body of feoffees who held\r\nthe advowson and to the founder. All the powers ecclesiastical and civil\r\nhaving given their consent, the churchwardens and parishioners, including\r\nvarious influential knights, esquires, and gentlemen, were called together\r\nby the tolling of the church bell, and then and there expressed their full\r\nconsent by petition to the bishop. The staff was composed of a warden,\r\neight fellows, four clerks, and six choristers; the bishop gave them a\r\nbody of statutes which occupy a large space in his extant register; and\r\nLord la Ware built a college for their residence adjoining the church. The\r\nfirst warden, John Huntingdon, began the erection of a new and larger\r\nchurch.\r\n\r\nThe college was confiscated by Edward VI. and turned into a vicarage, but\r\nre-established by Queen Mary. Queen Elizabeth renewed the charter of\r\nfoundation for a warden and four fellows, two chaplains, four laymen, and\r\nfour children skilled in music. Charles I. again renewed it. In 1847, the\r\ndiocese of Manchester was created, and the collegiate foundation afforded\r\na suitable cathedral church with a dean and four canons already endowed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs another example of the way in which a single benefactor sometimes made\r\nextra provision for the spiritual wants of a town, we take the case of the\r\nlittle town of ROTHERHAM, in Yorkshire. It had a church at the time of the\r\nConquest. In subsequent times, two great families, the Vescis and Tillis,\r\nshared the manor and the church between them.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the “Taxatio” (1291) the rectory had been divided into\r\nmoieties; one moiety had been appropriated to the Abbot of Clairvaux, who\r\nreceived £16 13_s._ 4_d._ from it, besides a stipend of £5, which he paid\r\nto the vicar of that moiety; Sir Roger was the rector of the other moiety,\r\nwho received £21 13_s._ 4_d._, and he also was represented by a vicar;\r\nmoreover, the prior of Lewes had a pension of £1 6_s._ 8_d._ out of the\r\nrectory.[593] The earlier church gave place, in the reign of Edward IV.,\r\nto a more spacious and handsome building, but its clerical staff still\r\nconsisted of two vicars and several chantry priests.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of York, for the last twenty years of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, was known by the name of Thomas of Rotherham. His family name was\r\nScott, but having been born at Rotherham, he took the name of his native\r\nplace, as we have seen was the custom of Churchmen in the Middle Ages.\r\nBefore his death, he adopted another good custom of the time, by raising\r\nfor himself a memorial in his native place, and conferring a benefit upon\r\nit in the shape of a perpetual foundation. His will is still in existence,\r\nand the following particulars are chiefly taken from it. He was, he says,\r\nborn of people of the yeoman class in the town of Rotherham, and baptized\r\nin the parish church, “in the sacred fountain flowing from the side of\r\nJesus. O that I loved this Name as I ought and would!” So, lest he should\r\nseem ungratefully forgetful of these things, he founded a perpetual\r\ncollege in the Name of Jesus in the said town. This was to take the place\r\nof an earlier foundation of the twenty-second year of Edward IV., in which\r\nhe had received his own education under a teacher of grammar so skilful\r\nthat other of his scholars as well as he had been enabled to rise to\r\nhigher fortunes. His first purpose was to establish a learned teacher of\r\ngrammar there for all time, who should teach gratis all who came to him.\r\nThen, having seen how the chantry priests of the town lived, some in one\r\nplace, some in another, with the laity, to the scandal of one and the ruin\r\nof the others,[594] he determined to erect a college where the first\r\nshould teach grammar, and the others might live and lodge. Thirdly, since\r\nhe had observed that there are many parishioners attending the church, and\r\nthat many rustic people of the neighbourhood flock to it that they may the\r\nbetter love the Christian religion, he establishes a second perpetual\r\nfellow to teach singing gratis, and to have for his food and clothing £6\r\n13_s._ 4_d._; and six chorister boys, that they may celebrate the Divine\r\noffice there more honourably, and each of them to have 40_s._ a year for\r\nfood and clothing. Fourthly, since there are many very intelligent youths\r\nwho do not all wish to attain the clerical dignity, but are adapted for\r\nmechanical arts and other occupations, he provides a third Socius, who\r\nshall teach the arts of writing and reckoning gratis. But since the arts\r\nof writing, music, and grammar are subordinate, and servants of the Divine\r\nlaw and the gospel, he ordains that there shall be a theologian placed\r\nabove the three fellows in the rule and government of the house, with the\r\nname of provost, who shall be a B.D. at least, and shall be required to\r\npreach the word of God through the whole of the founder’s province of\r\nYork; he is to have for food and clothing £13 6_s._ 8_d._ “Thus I have\r\nincorporated in my college one provost, three fellows, and six choristers,\r\nthat where I have offended God in His ten commandments, these ten may pray\r\nfor me.” As to the chantry priests, he gave them their chambers in the\r\ncollege; they were to dine at the college-table, paying for their food,\r\nbut having the services of the cook, washerwoman, and barber gratis. The\r\nprovost and fellows were to attend Divine service on festivals in the\r\nparish church in their surplices; at other times in the college chapel;\r\nand to celebrate his obit. There were five chantry priests living in the\r\ncollege at the time when the foundation, by which good Thomas of Rotherham\r\nmade a monument for himself, and conferred a great benefit on his native\r\ntown, was dissolved and swept away at the Reformation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe neighbouring town of SHEFFIELD will afford an example of the way in\r\nwhich the inhabitants of a town sometimes made extra spiritual provision\r\nfor themselves. At the Conquest, all this part of Yorkshire was a wild and\r\nthinly-peopled region. The Countess Judith, niece of the Conqueror, and\r\nwife of Waltheof, placed a colony of monks from Fontenelle near Havre, at\r\nEcclesfield near Sheffield. The whole district of Hallamshire descended\r\nfrom the countess to William de Lovelot, who had his principal castle at\r\nSheffield, and no doubt was the founder of the church here. Subsequently\r\nhe founded a Priory of Austin Canons at Worksop, and among other property\r\ngave to them the church and one-third of the tithe of Sheffield.[595]\r\n\r\nThe canons always presented to the vicarage of Sheffield one of their\r\nnumber, who was not thereby cut off from the convent; for one of them,\r\nUpton, was recalled from Sheffield to be the prior of the house at\r\nWorksop.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the fifteenth century we learn that there were\r\nendowments for a Light or Gild of the Blessed Virgin Mary, and for a\r\nChantry or Service of St. Catherine, in the church.\r\n\r\nIn 1498, William Hine left certain tenements in trust for the four church\r\ngreves or church masters to receive the rents, and thereof “to pay yearly\r\nto the priest of St. Catherine singing mass in the said church, 7_s._ at\r\nWhitsuntide for the better support and augmentation of the service thereof\r\ncalled St. Catherine’s Service, the church maisters to have 12_d._ for\r\nattending at his obit.” If the conditions of the will were not fulfilled,\r\nthe feoffees were to pay the profits to the burgesses for the repair of\r\nbridges, causeways, and highways within a mile of the town. The history of\r\nthe matter is a little obscure, but it appears that the inhabitants of the\r\ntown had by voluntary contributions supplied the vicar with stipends for\r\nthree chaplains to assist him in ministering to the town and the scattered\r\nhamlets; that about fourteen years before the Statute of Chantries, _i.e._\r\nin the year 1533, the Guardians of the endowed chantry began to\r\ncontribute £17 a year towards the maintenance of these three chaplains in\r\nsums of £7, £5, and £5. The Commissioners of Chantries returned it as “a\r\nservice or perpetual stipend of three priests in the church there,” and it\r\nwas confiscated with other chantries. On the accession of Queen Mary, at\r\nthe petition of the men of Sheffield, the charity was refounded and put\r\ninto the hands of twelve church burgesses to hold the property of the\r\nancient endowment and devote it to the support of three chaplains to\r\nassist the vicar as well in the visitation of the people as in Divine\r\nservice and the other sacraments in church, and to apply the surplus to\r\nthe repair of bridges and ways.[596]\r\n\r\nWe find, then, that in a town which was all one parish with one great\r\nchurch, though the person in charge of the souls of the people was only a\r\nsolitary vicar with a small income, there were often really a considerable\r\nnumber of clergy grouped around him, and that the services of the Church\r\nwere better maintained than we should perhaps have expected. On a Sunday\r\nmorning there would be several celebrations of Holy Communion at different\r\nhours in the chantry chapels, and some, if not all the priests of the\r\nchantries and special services were bound to be in choir at matins, high\r\nmass, and evensong, and take part in the service. Nearly every such town\r\nwould have its grammar school, taught by a Clerk in Holy Orders; and we\r\nmay be tolerably sure that the school would furnish choristers for choral\r\nmatins and evensong. We have learnt that the lay people were solicitous\r\nfor the honour of Divine service in their parish church, and may be sure\r\nthat the vicar had little difficulty in obtaining funds for the purchase\r\nof “a pair of organs” and the stipend of an organist, and for all other\r\nexpenses of Divine worship. On week-days the vicar would provide at least\r\ndaily mass, matins and evensong, and the chantries and special services\r\nwould supply other masses.\r\n\r\nIn the pastoral care of the people, too, the vicar of a great parish was\r\nnot left single-handed. Probably (as has been already said) each chantry\r\npriest, and, still more, each priest of a gild or service had a group of\r\npersons--the relatives of their founder, or brothers and sisters of their\r\nfraternity--who looked to them for spiritual ministrations; but besides\r\nthese, the vicar sometimes had chaplains who were assistant-curates. The\r\ncalendar of chantries, etc., refers to a number of endowments for\r\n“stipendiaries,” of which some are named in conjunction with chantries and\r\ngilds as if they were cantarists, but others in conjunction with parishes\r\nas if they were simply parish chaplains.\r\n\r\nLet us take NEWARK as our last example.\r\n\r\nLeofric, the great Earl of Mercia, and Godiva his wife, gave this manor to\r\nthe monastery of Stow. Remigius, the first Norman Bishop of Lincoln, held\r\nit in demesne; and then, according to Domesday, it had ten churches and\r\neight priests; the churches and priests were probably in the place itself\r\nand in the sixteen sokes under its jurisdiction, the names of which we\r\nrecognize in the names of the neighbouring villages for some miles round\r\non the left bank of the Trent. Alexander, the next bishop, built a\r\ncastle[597] here on the bank of the Trent; and the town seems to have\r\ngrown up into importance, owing partly to its situation on the Fossway and\r\nthe Trent, and partly to the protection and fostering care of the\r\nbishops. When Henry II. founded the Priory (of Sempringham nuns) of St.\r\nKatherine, near Lincoln, he endowed it, among other properties, with the\r\nChurch of Newark. A convent of Austin Friars was planted here and another\r\nof Observants (Franciscans), and the Knights of the Temple had a\r\npreceptory here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Newark Church, Nottinghamshire.]\r\n\r\nThe town, as one of the halting-places of the funeral progress of Queen\r\nEleanor, was ornamented with one of the crosses with which the king marked\r\nevery step of that great pageant.\r\n\r\nTo come to more recent times, and to the particulars with which we are\r\nmost concerned, the borough was one parish[598] under the care of a vicar;\r\nand its parish church,[599] rebuilt in the reign of Henry VI., is a very\r\nlarge and noble structure, with its chancel screen and carved stalls, and\r\nsome fine carving, still remaining uninjured. We have already had occasion\r\nto give the particulars of the income of the vicar,[600] which amounted at\r\nthe time of the “Valor” to £21, and of the outgoings, which included a\r\nstipend of £5 for a chaplain,[601] we have to add here the services and\r\npriests which helped to complete the religious arrangements of the town.\r\n\r\nThe Calendar of Chantries, etc., so often quoted, gives the following list\r\nof them--\r\n\r\n    St. Nicholas’ Chantry, a chantry at the altar of St. James;\r\n    Sawcendine’s Chantry; “Morrow Mass” Chantry; St. Catherine’s Chantry;\r\n    Corpus Christi Chantry, founded by Fleming;[602] Corpus Christi\r\n    Chantry, founded by Isabell Caldwell; Newark Chantry; Trinity Chantry;\r\n    All Saints’ Chantry; Foster’s Chantry; Trinity Gild[603] Chantry;\r\n    Trinity Chantry, founded by John Leeke.\r\n\r\nThere are thirteen chantries in all. One we note was for a “Morrow Mass,”\r\n_i.e._ a very early celebration of Holy Communion; the rest would be\r\narranged at various hours. The Trinity Gild was the great gild of the\r\ntown, which here, as in many other towns, supplied, to some extent, the\r\nplace of a municipal corporation.\r\n\r\nSome solidarity was given to this group of cantarists by the fact that\r\nthey lived together in a mansion which a benefactor had provided for them.\r\nThe internal economy of the mansion would require some regulation which\r\nwould not improbably be borrowed from the rules which were customary in a\r\ncollege of priest-vicars, or chantry house of several priests. The rules\r\nfor the chantry priests lodging in Archbishop Rotherham’s College,[604]\r\nand those for the chapel at Kingston-on-Thames,[605] will indicate their\r\ngeneral character.\r\n\r\nThomas Magnus, Archdeacon of the East Riding of York, a native of the town\r\njust before the Reformation (1532), founded at the north-west point of the\r\nchurchyard a free school for a priest sufficiently learned to teach\r\ngrammar, who was to be paid £10; together with a song school for a\r\npriest[606] sufficiently learned to teach plain song and play the organ,\r\nwho was to have £8; and six children to be taught music, and to play upon\r\nthe organs, who were to have 26_s._ 8_d._ each. The founder also founded\r\nan obit of 40_s._, and 40_s._ to be given to the alderman [of the Holy\r\nTrinity Gild] for the time being.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral-like choir of the church would then be well filled on\r\nSundays and holy days by the vicar and his chaplain and the thirteen\r\ncantarists and the children of the song school, and the Divine service\r\nhonourably rendered, and the long nave would doubtless be filled with the\r\ndevout people. The whole clerical staff of the town consisted of the\r\nvicar, his chaplain and clerk, the brethren of the two friaries, perhaps a\r\ndozen in each, the thirteen cantarists in their chantry house: nearly\r\nforty men, besides the military monks in the preceptory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBesides monks and friars, rectors and vicars, cantarists, and chaplains of\r\nvarious kinds, there was still another kind of religious persons to be\r\nfound in many towns, viz. Recluses. The first recluses were enclosed in\r\nthe Egyptian deserts in a narrow cell; but in process of time a churchyard\r\nwas taken to be a sufficiently solitary place, and the cell sometimes\r\nconsisted of two or more fairly comfortable rooms built against the\r\nchancel wall of the church. There lived an old hermit or priest, or a\r\nreligious woman, supported partly by an endowment, partly by the offerings\r\nand bequests of the people. Their picturesque asceticism attracted the\r\ninterest and veneration of impressible people, who would consult them in\r\nthe affairs of their souls, and no doubt in their social difficulties\r\nalso, and receive more or less good council according to the character of\r\nthe recluse.[607]\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIDGE-CHAPELS.\r\n\r\nThere is still another feature wanting to complete (in many cases) this\r\nsurvey of the ecclesiastical aspect of a mediæval town. A good hard road\r\nthrough a wild boggy tract, or a raised causeway across the often flooded\r\nvalley in which the town was situated, or a stone bridge in place of a\r\ndangerous ford or inconvenient ferry, conferred a very real benefit upon\r\nthe whole community, from the king in his royal progresses through the\r\ncountry to the peasantry who brought their produce to the weekly market.\r\nMen wisely included road-making and bridge-building among meritorious acts\r\nof charity, and the calendar of chantries, etc., contains a number of\r\nendowments which were given or bequeathed for these purposes. Very\r\nfrequently the pious builder of a bridge added a religious foundation to\r\nit in the shape of a little chapel; sometimes the chapel was built at one\r\nend of the bridge; more commonly, perhaps, the central pier on one side of\r\nthe bridge was enlarged, and the chapel picturesquely erected upon it. The\r\nchapel was endowed with a stipend for a perpetual chantry priest to say\r\nprayers there for the family of the bridge-builder, and for all Christian\r\npeople; and no doubt the founder hoped for himself the prayers of all the\r\nChristian people who used his bridge. Those of us who, lounging about the\r\nchurches of other countries as sight-seers, have seen the market women\r\ncome in, set down their baskets on the floor, and kneel down for a few\r\nmoments for silent prayer, will easily understand the practical religious\r\nuses of these bridge-chapels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bridge and Chapel, Wakefield.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the chapel built on the new stone London Bridge of 1176 was one of\r\nthe earliest and the most important of them. It was built over a crypt on\r\nthe central pier on the eastern side of the bridge, and dedicated to St.\r\nThomas the Martyr, who had been canonized three years before. It had a\r\nmaster and fraternity, and several chantries were founded in it. Bideford\r\nBridge, one of the longest at that time in the kingdom, was built in 1350,\r\non the initiative of the parish priest, Sir R. Gurney, who had a vision of\r\nan angel showing him where to build. The lord of the manor, Sir Theodore\r\nGranville, Knight, gave the undertaking his countenance and aid;\r\nGrandisson, the Bishop of Exeter, gave his licence to collect money backed\r\nby the promise of indulgences, and the bridge was made with its 23 arches,\r\n177 yards long. In later times, the estates of the Bridge Gild were under\r\nthe management of a warden and brethren, who not only kept the bridge in\r\nrepair, but also built a hall for their meetings and a school beside it,\r\nfounded charities, gave dinners, and kept to that end--Charles Kingsley in\r\n“Westward Ho!” is our authority for saying it--the best stocked cellar in\r\nall Devon. There is a good example of a bridge-chapel still remaining on\r\nthe centre pier of Rotherham bridge, and another at Wakefield, served by\r\ntwo chaplains. We have remains or notes of others: two at Nottingham, one,\r\n_super altem pontem_, dedicated to St. James, the other, _ad finem\r\npontis_, dedicated to St. Mary; at Newcastle, dedicated to St. Thomas; at\r\nCamelford, dedicated to St. Thomas, built by the burgesses of the town; at\r\nExeter, founded by the mayor and bailiffs of the city; at Stamford,\r\ndedicated to St. Thomas; at Elvet, dedicated to St. James; two at York,\r\nSt. Anne’s on Fossbridge and St. William’s on Ouse bridge; Burton, at one\r\nend of the long bridge over the Trent; at Doncaster, where the bridge had\r\na stone gateway with a chapel of “Our Lady” beside it at one end, and a\r\nstone cross beside the entrance to the bridge at the other end; and at\r\nmany other places, as Durham, Manchester, Rochester, Bidenham, Totton,\r\nGronethe, dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary; at Sheffield, Darfield,\r\netc. Sometimes a hospital for the entertainment of poor travellers was\r\nbuilt at the end of a bridge, as at Burton and at Nottingham;[608] at\r\nBrandford there was a chapel-house and hospital _juxta pontem_.[609]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nDISCIPLINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe average Englishman of the present day has hardly an idea of what is\r\nmeant by ecclesiastical discipline, and is quite ignorant of the large\r\npart which it played in the practical religious life of people in ancient\r\ntimes. Yet its principles are laid down in the New Testament; the right\r\nand duty of the Church to hear and determine causes between Christian men\r\nis contained in our Lord’s command, “If thy brother trespass against thee\r\n... tell it to the Church; and if he neglect to hear the Church, let him\r\nbe unto thee as a heathen man and a publican” (Matt. xviii. 17). The\r\ngeneral recognition and exercise of this jurisdiction is alluded to in the\r\napostolic writings (1 Cor. vi. 4; x. 32); and St. Paul gives several\r\nactual examples of its enforcement (1 Cor. v. 5; 1 Tim. i. 20). The Church\r\nin all times and places has maintained this power of spiritual discipline\r\nto be one of its fundamental principles.\r\n\r\nThe special jurisdiction which the decree of William the Conqueror gave to\r\nthe Ecclesiastical Courts over ecclesiastical persons, and over lay\r\npersons in ecclesiastical cases, was perhaps an encroachment upon the\r\nprovince of the civil law, but the spiritual jurisdiction involved in our\r\nLord’s Command is independent of the sanction of the civil magistrate.\r\n\r\nThis spiritual discipline is an important aid to the power of the civil\r\nmagistrate in the Christian community. Where the magistrate’s power stops,\r\nthat of the pastorate steps in. The magistrate can only take cognizance of\r\ncrimes, and punish a man for offences against another; the Church takes\r\ncognizance of sins, and deals with a man _pro salute animæ_. If the sin\r\nhas not caused scandal, the penance inflicted may be of a private nature;\r\nbut if it has caused scandal, the punishment is public, “that others may\r\nlearn not to offend.”\r\n\r\nThe penitential system in the Saxon Church, as we learn it from the\r\npenitential known by the name of Archbishop Theodore, was a very elaborate\r\nsystem, classifying sins and assigning penalties to them; it was confirmed\r\nin some particulars by the ecclesiastical enactments of kings. In greater\r\nmatters the case came before the sheriff and bishop at the Shiremote or\r\nHundredmote, and the sentence was enforced by the same power which\r\nexecuted the civil sentences of the same court. In the Ecclesiastical\r\nCourts after the Norman Conquest, the bishop, and in some matters the\r\narchdeacons under his authority, tried the cause, and in case of\r\nresistance to the sentence applied for a royal writ to be sent to the\r\nsheriff to enforce it. In most cases the knowledge that the Bishop’s Court\r\nhad the civil power at its back was enough to lead men to submit to its\r\nauthority. In the last resort the spiritual authority had the sentence of\r\nexcommunication to fall back upon.[610]\r\n\r\nThe discipline of the clergy was specially in the hands of the bishop and\r\nhis archdeacons, who dealt with moral offences and ecclesiastical\r\nirregularities in their courts. The famous Constitutions of Otho (1237),\r\nfollowed up by those of Archbishop Stephen Langton, enacted, that in every\r\nrural deanery one rector should be appointed to hear the confessions of\r\nthe clergy. Archbishop Peckham, in 1281, complains that it had not been\r\ndone, and renews the ordinance. This was not to prevent the clergy from\r\ngoing to other penitentiaries appointed by the bishop.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Greenfield of York (1310) issued an injunction, engrossed by a\r\npublic notary, ordering a certain Ralph de Grave, Canon of Worksop, who\r\nhad proved contumacious, to betake himself within three days to the\r\nmonastery of Bridlington, and there to do penance for his rebellious\r\nbehaviour.[611]\r\n\r\nAmong Grostete’s letters is one to a cleric, in which he rebukes his\r\nluxurious and licentious life, and tells him roundly that he is “a blot on\r\nthe clergy, a shame to theologians, a delight to the enemies of religion,\r\na derision and song and story to the vulgar.”[612]\r\n\r\n    Robert Coton, for a sermon preached at Atcham, near Shrewsbury,\r\n    containing heretical teaching, was sentenced to carry a faggot in\r\n    procession round the cathedral, and afterwards round Atcham\r\n    Church.[613]\r\n\r\n    Robert Segefeld, chaplain, in 1455, confessing immorality, is\r\n    sentenced to public penance in his chapel and in the cathedral, and to\r\n    pay 6_s._ 8_d._ to St. Cuthbert’s shrine. This penance consisted in\r\n    walking barefoot, in linen vestments (_pannis lineis_), carrying a\r\n    candle before the procession, on a Sunday.[614]\r\n\r\n    Thomas Ferby, December 7, 1456, prayed to be released from the\r\n    excommunication he had incurred for procuring the celebration of a\r\n    clandestine marriage in St. Paul’s Cray Church. As a penance, he was\r\n    ordered to visit the shrine of St. Thomas of Canterbury on Easter Day,\r\n    and there offer a wax taper of one pound weight. The like offering was\r\n    to be made to St. Blaize at Bromley and in Chislehurst Church. In\r\n    addition, he was to allow exhibitions to two scholars at Oxford for\r\n    two years. Ferby afterwards came to an understanding with his\r\n    diocesan, and was dismissed from the suit. In the next February, John,\r\n    chaplain of Paul’s Cray, doubtless the priest who had officiated on\r\n    the occasion, swore before the bishop, in the cathedral, not to offend\r\n    again, and was absolved.[615] He redeemed his penance by taking an\r\n    oath to pay a mark at Lady Day in that and the two ensuing years.[616]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIX KNIGHTS DOING PENANCE AT THE SHRINE OF ST. EDMUND. XV.\r\nCENT. MS., 2278 f., 108 v., HARL.]\r\n\r\nThe bishops had to deal, not only with the moral offences of the clergy,\r\nbut also with the occasional crimes committed by members of this\r\nprivileged class. Degradation from Orders, and imprisonment with\r\npenitential discipline, seems to have been the usual mode of punishment.\r\nWe have seen that a Constitution of Archbishop Boniface, 1260, directed\r\nevery bishop to have in his diocese one or two prisons for confining\r\nclerics flagitious in crime, or convicted by canonical censure, and that\r\nany cleric committing a crime such that if he were a layman he would,\r\naccording to the secular law, suffer the extreme penalty, should be\r\nadjudged to perpetual imprisonment.\r\n\r\n    This spiritual power was strong enough to cope with the most powerful\r\n    offenders. We all remember how Henry II., able and powerful king as he\r\n    was, submitted to discipline at the hands of the monks of Canterbury\r\n    Cathedral, before the shrine of St. Thomas.\r\n\r\n    The turbulent Fulke de Breauté, in the reign of Henry III., had\r\n    plundered St. Alban’s Abbey and taken some refugees out of its\r\n    sanctuary. Being warned by the saint in a dream, he offered himself at\r\n    the monastery to suffer penance; and there despoiled of his clothes,\r\n    with his knights similarly stripped, bearing in hand a rod, “which is\r\n    vulgarly called baleis,” and confessing his fault, he received the\r\n    discipline from each of the brothers on his naked flesh.[617] He\r\n    refused, however, to make restitution.\r\n\r\n    When Thomas of Cantilupe was Bishop of Hereford (1275-1283), Lord\r\n    Clifford plundered his cattle and ill-treated his tenants. When\r\n    summoned by the bishop to make amends for his misconduct, he offered\r\n    to do so by a money payment; but the bishop compelled him to walk\r\n    barefoot as a penitent to the altar, while the bishop himself\r\n    inflicted chastisement upon him as he walked.[618]\r\n\r\n    John Langton, Bishop of Chichester, c. 1314, excommunicated Earl\r\n    Warren for adultery. The earl came to Chichester and endeavoured to\r\n    seize the bishop; but Langton and his servants not only repelled the\r\n    attack, but captured the earl and his retinue and put them all in\r\n    prison.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying plate is from Lydgate’s “Life of Edmund VI.” (Harl. 2278,\r\nf. 108 and f. 108 v.). Preceding it is a picture of five knights issuing\r\nfrom the gate of the abbey laden with plunder, and keeping the monks at\r\nbay at the sword’s point; next this picture of the knights stripped to\r\ntheir drawers, making their submission to the abbot and his clerks at the\r\nshrine of the saint. Between the two pictures the story is told thus:\r\n\r\n  Knightes of yoe of malice and ravyne,\r\n  Agen the fredom of Edmund ful confiable,\r\n  Habergowned and in platis fyne,\r\n  Entered his court, took hors out yf his stable,\r\n  With swerdes drawe to shewe hemself vengable,\r\n  Lyst any man wolde make resistence,\r\n  Hadde forth the pray beytort violence.\r\n\r\n  But sodenly thus with hem it stood,\r\n  Or they passyd the boūdes of the gate,\r\n  Travayled with furye and echon was wood,\r\n  Repented, after offered up mayl and plate,\r\n  Confessed, assoiled, in cronycle set the date,\r\n  Ever after off hool affeccion,\r\n  Hadde to the martyr gret devocion.\r\n\r\nWe must bear in mind that these were the days when civil penalties\r\nincluded the stocks and the pillory and whipping through the streets at a\r\ncart’s tail.\r\n\r\n    In 1344, a sheriff’s officer, who slew a rector, resisting the attempt\r\n    to arrest him, was, with his followers, condemned to walk, stripped to\r\n    their breeches, like the knights at St. Edmund’s, round the principal\r\n    churches of the district, and to be whipped at the door of each\r\n    church.[619] And such instances might be indefinitely multiplied.\r\n\r\n    About 1284, Archbishop Peckham made a provincial visitation, in which\r\n    he exercised severe discipline on both clergy and laity. For example,\r\n    in Lichfield Diocese, the bishop being a foreigner and non-resident,\r\n    the archbishop sent a public summons to him to reside, on penalty of\r\n    deprivation, telling him that since he could not preach to his people,\r\n    he was the rather bound to reside among them, and to spend his revenue\r\n    in hospitality and relieving the poor. In Chichester Diocese, he\r\n    inflicted upon one John Ham, a priest, convicted of immorality, a\r\n    three years’ penance of fasting, prayers, and pilgrimage, during which\r\n    time the profits of his living were sequestrated to the poor. In\r\n    Wilts, being informed that Sir Osborn Gyfford had carried off two nuns\r\n    from the Monastery of Wilton, he proceeded to excommunication against\r\n    him, and only consented to remit the censure on these conditions: that\r\n    he should be stripped to the waist on three Sundays in Wilton Parish\r\n    Church and beaten with rods; the discipline to be publicly repeated\r\n    both in the market-place and parish church of Shaftesbury; should fast\r\n    for three months, and go on a three years’ pilgrimage to Jerusalem;\r\n    should not wear a sword, or appear in the habit of a gentleman.\r\n\r\n    Grostete, Bishop of Lincoln, instituted an inquiry into the morals of\r\n    the laity as well as clergy in his diocese, but the king, Henry III.,\r\n    interposed, and obliged him to desist.\r\n\r\nBut to come to a different class of offenders, and to various kinds of\r\nmisdoing. It will be enough to select a few examples.\r\n\r\n    1253. Hugo de Berewyk found surety of ten marks to behave properly to\r\n    his wife, and he was sentenced, for “that he had long been\r\n    excommunicate, that without shoes or girdle or [sword ?] he should\r\n    receive the discipline in the porch of the Church of Gysele, before\r\n    the whole procession, once on the day of the Holy Trinity, a second\r\n    time on the day of St. John Baptist, and the third time on the day of\r\n    SS. Peter and Paul.”[620]\r\n\r\n    When Bishop Ralph, of Bath and Wells, in 1348, visited Ilchester, the\r\n    people of the place made a riot, attacked the bishop and his people,\r\n    and shut them up in the church for some hours, till they were rescued\r\n    by the well-affected. The riot was punished by excommunication of the\r\n    offenders, and interdict of the Church. One of the ringleaders, Roger\r\n    Warmville, was tried at Taunton by the Commissary, and sentenced to\r\n    penance. He was to walk on three several occasions, bareheaded and\r\n    barefoot, round Ilchester Church, in front of the procession made on\r\n    Sundays and feast days, holding a candle, which he was to present at\r\n    the altar during mass, while a chaplain declared his sin to the\r\n    congregation in the vulgar tongue. Moreover, he was to be flogged\r\n    thrice on market days at Ilchester, Wells, Bath, Glastonbury, and\r\n    Somerton; he was to pay a fine of £20, and make a pilgrimage to\r\n    Canterbury in honour of St. Thomas the Martyr.[621]\r\n\r\n    In 1474, a case of homicide between the Lamberts and the Knolls, by\r\n    the award of Wm. Blackburn, Canon of Bolton, it was awarded and\r\n    ordained that Thomas, Henry, Richard, Stephen and Thomas Knoll of\r\n    Floder, “come to the parish church of Preston, and there in tyme of\r\n    service, kneling on their knees, loose gerded, ask God forgivenes of\r\n    ye dethe of Henrie Lambert, and ask forgivenes of his fader John\r\n    Lambert, and pay xl marks to ye behofe of Jo. Lambert and his\r\n    children, unto Ric. Pilkinton, Esq., on the awter of St. Nicholas, in\r\n    the parish church of Skypton.”[622]\r\n\r\n    All kinds of offences were dealt with by similar penalties. Richard\r\n    Ram confessing that he had not paid the tithe of his corn to his\r\n    rector of Cliffe, in 1363, was sentenced to carry a sheaf of corn on\r\n    his shoulder to the altar of Cliffe Church, and there to offer it and\r\n    the value of the tithe withheld.[623]\r\n\r\n    Among the cases recorded in the “Proceedings of the Courts of Durham,”\r\n    p. 26, we find, in a case of immorality, the man sentenced to receive\r\n    four “fustigations” round the church, and the woman two.\r\n\r\n    For non-attendance at church on Sundays, we have already quoted\r\n    several cases (p. 201).\r\n\r\n    In 1480, nine parishioners of Halling and Snodland[624] were summoned\r\n    to the court for playing tennis on Thursday in Whitsun-week in time of\r\n    matins and mass. They pleaded guilty, and took an oath to perform\r\n    whatever penance the bishop might impose. The sentence was that those\r\n    of Snodland should walk barefoot after the procession on the following\r\n    Sunday, each carrying a taper worth a halfpenny, which they should\r\n    offer at the Holy Cross. The Halling men were to do the like, with\r\n    this difference, that they were each to offer two tapers at the high\r\n    altar and two at the altar of St. John.\r\n\r\n    William Bek, of Cooling, was cited into the court of John Alcock\r\n    (1476-1486), Bishop of Rochester, in consequence of having been\r\n    detected by his wife and neighbours in eating meat on Fridays and\r\n    other fasts. Bek confessed his guilt, though he doubted if he had\r\n    offended in Lent, but pleaded that he was not responsible for his\r\n    actions, since his mind had been so much disturbed for three years\r\n    that he only knew Sunday because his wife on that day offered him the\r\n    consecrated bread. The plea did not avail. It was ordered that as a\r\n    penance he should be thrice whipped round Cooling Church, before the\r\n    procession, clad in a white cloth, with bare head and feet, and\r\n    carrying a taper of the value of one penny. Further, that on Friday he\r\n    should be whipped in Rochester market in like manner, and should offer\r\n    a taper at the shrine of St. William.[625]\r\n\r\n    Margaret Reed, in 1469, is brought before the Court for using ill\r\n    language to Martha Howkett, in that she told her she was a “horse\r\n    godmother and waterwitch.” So, in 1560, Wm. Lee is reported to have\r\n    said to Bayle, who was reported to be a deacon at Durham, “Methenketh\r\n    ye goeth not lyk a man of the church, but lyk a ruffing.” To whom the\r\n    said Bayle answered, “What hast thou to do with my apparell or my\r\n    going? Thou art a slave and a knave to find fault with me.”[626]\r\n\r\nThere are many other instances of defamation, at p. 90, etc. Here is an\r\nexample of a little later date than our period, which shows exactly what\r\nwas the way of making amends for the offence of defamation:--\r\n\r\n    A confession to be made by Charles Shawe for slandering Bar. Mitforth\r\n    in St. Nicoles Church, in lynen apparell, after the reading of the\r\n    third chapter of St. James’ Epistle--\r\n\r\n    “Beloved neighbours, I am now comen hither to shewe myself sory for\r\n    slannderinge one Bartram Midforde, namely in that I called him openly\r\n    ‘beggerly harlot and cutthrote,’ saying that he ‘was a covitous\r\n    snowge, and such as he by Godd’s worde aught to be weded out of the\r\n    Coomenwelthe.’ I acknowledge that thus to slannder my Xtian brother is\r\n    an heynouse offence, first towardes God, who hathe straightly\r\n    forbydden it in his holy lawes, accountyng it to be a kind of\r\n    murderinge my neighbour, and threatninge to punyshe it with hell fire\r\n    and the losse of the kyngdome of heavene. Also the Queen’s lawes,\r\n    against which I have stubbornely stande, doth grevously punyshe all\r\n    slannderers, backbiters, and sowers of discorde, debate, hatred, and\r\n    disquietnes, to the shame of the offenders and feare of others.\r\n    Agayne, my unruly tongue, if it were not punished, it wolde not only\r\n    set mo of you on fire, but also it wolde bolden others to do the like.\r\n    Wherefore, as I am now called back frome myne inordinate doinges by\r\n    this correction, with my coste and shame, so I beseche yow all to be\r\n    witnesses with me that I am sory frome the verrey bottome of my harte\r\n    for this and my other like offences against God, the Quene’s majestie,\r\n    and the said Bertram Mydforde; promysinge before God and you here\r\n    present, that I fully intende to amende my outerageous tonge and\r\n    wilfull behaviour, as maye please Almightie God, satisfye the Quene’s\r\n    lawes, and towrne to yur good example and myne owne sowle’s health;\r\n    for the obteyninge and performinge thereof I humbly beseche yow all,\r\n    with me and for me, to pray unto God as our Saviour Jesus Xt. himself,\r\n    beinge on earth, taught us, sayinge ‘Our Father,’ etc. A.D.\r\n    1570.”[627]\r\n\r\n    A suit was begun in 1458 against John Andrew of Cobham and Margery\r\n    Allyn, late of Shorne, for having clandestinely married while a\r\n    matrimonial cause was pending between her and Richard Coke. They were\r\n    sentenced, December 20, to be whipped “after the manner of penitents”\r\n    once in Rochester market and thrice round their parish church. Walter\r\n    Crepehogg, who had promoted the marriage, was thought the worst\r\n    offender, for besides _six_ whippings he was condemned to carry a\r\n    torch worth 6_s._ 8_d._ to the altar of the cathedral, and to make a\r\n    similar offering to St. Blaize at Bromley.[628]\r\n\r\nOccasionally a contumacious person resisted the sentence. For example--\r\n\r\n    In 1315, Lady Plokenet [Plucknet] directed by will that she should be\r\n    buried in Sherborne Church. Her son, Sir Alan, probably to save\r\n    expense, buried her “in a less dignified place.” The bishop sent him\r\n    orders by the Rector of Dowlish Wake, who was the Rural Dean of\r\n    Crewkerne, to obey his mother’s request. Falling into a rage at this,\r\n    the knight rushed on the dean, caught him by the throat, and choaked\r\n    him by twisting his hood, and even caused him to bleed. The dean got\r\n    away, and fled. At Haslebury, however, Sir Alan and his men caught\r\n    him, and there the knight made him eat the bishop’s letter, and chew\r\n    and swallow the wax seals. For this he was excommunicated, but made\r\n    due submission.[629]\r\n\r\nIn the “Proceedings of the Durham Court” we read that--\r\n\r\n    John Doffenby, being a person excommunicate, did come into Mitfourth\r\n    Church in tyme of service, and being admonished to depart thrice,\r\n    would not, but gave evil language, saying that he cared not for the\r\n    commissary and his laws, nor for the curate, and bade them come who\r\n    durst and carry him out of the church; whereupon the curate was driven\r\n    to leave off service at the gospel. It does not appear what was the\r\n    end of the case.\r\n\r\n    Agnes Hebburne, 1454, having been sentenced to do penance in _pannis\r\n    lineis_, impudently pleaded that she had not a fit smock, and was not\r\n    able to buy one; whereupon the judge ordered her to do her penance in\r\n    a “tunica habens unam vestem vocatur le napron.”\r\n\r\nThere are some pictorial illustrations of the subject in the illuminated\r\nMSS. The scourging of Henry II. before the shrine of Becket is often\r\nportrayed. In the Omne Bonum (Royal, 6 Ed. VI., f. 218 v.) is a very\r\ncurious picture of a priest giving the discipline to a penitent kneeling\r\nbefore him;[630] and at f. 443 (6 E. VII.), a man scourging himself on the\r\nbare back in his bedroom. In a Pontifical printed at Venice, 1520, f. 155,\r\npenitents in their shirts are kneeling before the bishop; a man kneeling\r\nto a priest who lays the rod of absolution on his shoulder, at 203 v., and\r\nReconciliation of Penitents at the end of Lent, f. 177.\r\n\r\nThere are two sides to most questions, and what a man will say upon any\r\nquestion depends upon his point of view. What we are told of clergy and\r\nlaity of those ages by courts of discipline which dealt exclusively with\r\ntheir peccadilloes, and by the satirists whose motive was the scourging of\r\nthe peccators, gives us one side of the subject. Nobody took the trouble\r\nto tell the obvious, uninteresting story of the ruck of parsons of\r\nrespectable character who were doing their daily round of duty, Sunday and\r\nworkaday, fairly well, except Chaucer, and he--great student of human life\r\nand manners that he was--while scourging with a whip of scorpions the\r\nfaults of monks and friars, and pardoners and “sompnours,” completes his\r\ngallery of ecclesiastical characters with the loveliest portrait of the\r\ntypical parish priest.\r\n\r\nThe inquisitorial meddling of the courts of spiritual discipline, their\r\npecuniary exactions and shameful penances, were by no means the least of\r\nthe abuses which made men cry out for a reformation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn connection with this system of discipline was the custom of pronouncing\r\na general sentence of excommunication in church several times a year which\r\nis mentioned by John Myrc (p. 238). We may add here that it was not at all\r\nuncommon to try to bring an unknown thief to make restitution by the\r\nthreat of a sentence of excommunication; thus Bishop Thomas, in 1376, at\r\nthe request of Philip de Nevile, directs all the clergy to give notice\r\nthat some persons unknown have knowingly detained a very valuable hawk,\r\nand they are to restore it within ten days on pain of the greater\r\nexcommunication.[631] Two years afterwards (1378), the same bishop\r\nexcommunicates certain persons who have stolen some “merlions” from his\r\nforest of Wesdale, and destroyed their nests.[632] On the other hand, the\r\nold Saxon system of purgation of oath still continued, _e.g._ in 1458,\r\nWilliam Godthank, accused of theft, appeared in Gnosall Church, Lichfield,\r\nwith eight of his neighbours, and standing before the altar he swore that\r\nhe was innocent, and his neighbours that they believed him, whereupon the\r\nbishop threatened excommunication against any one who should in future\r\nslander him.[633]\r\n\r\nArchbishop Peckham’s third constitution at Reading (1279) orders the\r\nGeneral Excommunications to be explained to the people on the Sundays\r\nafter every Rural Chapter, and the archdeacons to see that it is\r\ndone.[634]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS OPINIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of the religious condition of the parish priests and their\r\npeople in the Middle Ages--their belief and life--brings us into a\r\npolemical atmosphere. There are some admirers of those times who look upon\r\nthem as “the Ages of Faith;” there are others who think that in those\r\ntimes of false doctrines and manifold superstitions priests and people\r\nwere generally degraded and vicious.\r\n\r\nThe truth lies somewhere between the two. We do not propose to enter into\r\npolemical discussion. Our business, as it seems to us, is to try to put\r\nourselves into the midst of the people, to enter into their minds, to\r\nstudy their lives, and to represent as fairly as we can what manner of men\r\npriests and people were, what they believed, and how they lived.\r\n\r\nWe seem to see on the whole that there were two “schools of thought” in\r\nthe Middle Ages. One consisted of learned men of a speculative turn of\r\nmind, who explained and developed ancient doctrines and practices into new\r\nand erroneous meanings; followed by a crowd of devout people who adopted\r\ntheir views, and sometimes degraded philosophical speculations and pious\r\nopinions, which they hardly understood, into gross misapprehensions and\r\nsuperstitions. On the other hand, there were people of competent learning,\r\nwho read the Scriptures and the ancient Fathers, and in substance adhered\r\nto their teaching; and with them remained a crowd of people whose\r\nChristian common sense kept them fairly free of extravagances. We must be\r\ncareful in judging people who have been brought up in a faulty system. We\r\nmust not take for granted that everybody believed in every error and in\r\nthe conclusions logically involved in it, or approved of every\r\nsuperstitious custom. On the contrary, the soul, like the stomach, seems\r\nto discriminate what it lives on, and to have a power of assimilating what\r\nis good, and rejecting more or less what is noxious. Why should we doubt\r\nthat God watches over His people, and helps the ignorant, well-intentioned\r\nChristian man unconsciously to refuse the evil and choose the good?\r\n\r\nIf we look at the general character of the centuries we have been\r\nstudying, there is no denying that there was a great deal which was good\r\nin them. The people in the twelfth century had a great zeal for religion\r\nof an ascetic type, and amidst the violence and oppression of the times\r\nthere was a great deal of religious feeling of an exalted character, and\r\nmany a saintly life. It was the great age of the Latin hymns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Early English architecture. North-west transept of Beverley\r\nMinster.]\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century, the enthusiasm for the ascetic life had cooled\r\ndown, having been to some extent disappointed; the monks were not so\r\nhighly thought of, and the more sober type of religion represented by the\r\nbishop and secular clergy came to the front. It was a great century of\r\nintense vitality; the spirit of freedom was moving the middle classes of\r\nthe people, and the Church was in hearty sympathy with them. It was the\r\nage of organization of civil institutions. Very few monasteries were\r\nbuilt, but every cathedral was enlarged, and churches were rebuilt; there\r\nwas never so active an architectural period. The new religious spirit of\r\nthe age showed itself in that rare event, the introduction of a new style\r\nof architecture, bold engineering skill in its construction, with pointed\r\narches soaring heavenwards, ornamentations of acanthus leaves just\r\nunfolding in the vigour of the spring-time of a new year.\r\n\r\nIn the fourteenth century, the history of the Lollard movement is enough\r\nto show the strong religious feeling of the people and its tendency\r\ntowards sounder views of religion. The saying that, “Where you saw three\r\npeople talking together, two of them were Lollards,” was said by a\r\nLollard, and may be an exaggeration; but there is no question that (while\r\nsome went to extremes, as always in an age of great intellectual movement\r\nand strong feeling) the mass of the people was leavened by what there\r\nwas--and there was much--that was true in the new ideas.[635]\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested by ingenious critics that Chaucer, being connected\r\nby marriage and sympathy with the leader of the party which favoured the\r\nopinion of the school of Wiclif, his famous description of “a poure parson\r\nof a town” is only the ideal of what a parish priest ought to be according\r\nto the view of that school. It may be maintained, on the other hand, that\r\nChaucer’s sketches of the clergy of all orders are conceived in a spirit\r\nof genial satire; and that if the parish priests had been generally\r\nworldly-minded and negligent of their duties, unclerical in attire and\r\nweapons, attendants on field-sports and haunters of taverns, the great\r\nartist would have put a man of that type among his inimitable gallery of\r\ncontemporary character sketches. We have no fear of being mistaken when we\r\ntake it that his “poure parson of a town” (which does not necessarily mean\r\na town but quite possibly a village rector[636]) had many prototypes among\r\nthe parochial clergy of the fourteenth century.\r\n\r\n  A good man there was of religioun,\r\n  That was a poure parson of a toun;\r\n  But riche was of holy thought and werk.\r\n  He was also a lerned man, a clerk,\r\n  That Christe’s Gospel treweley would preche.\r\n  His parishens devoutly wolde he teche.\r\n  Benigne he was, and wonder diligent,\r\n  And in adversity ful patient;\r\n  And such he was y proved often sithes,\r\n  Ful loth were he to cursen for his tithes,\r\n  But rather would he given, out of doubte,\r\n  Unto his poure parishens about,\r\n  Of his offering, and eke of his substance.\r\n  He could in litel thing have suffisance.\r\n  Wide was his parish, and houses fer asunder,\r\n  But he ne left nought, for no rain ne thunder,\r\n  In siknesse and in mischief to visite\r\n  The farthest in his parish much and lite,\r\n  Upon his fete, and in his hand a staff.\r\n  This noble example to his sheep he gaf,\r\n  That first he wrought and afterward he taught\r\n  Out of the gospel he the wordes caught,\r\n  And this figure he added yet thereto,\r\n  That if gold ruste what should iron do,\r\n  For if a priest be foul on whom we trust,\r\n  No wonder is a leude man to rust;\r\n  And shame it is if that a priest take kepe,\r\n  To see a filthy shepherd and clene shepe.\r\n  Well ought a priest example for to give\r\n  By his clenenesse how his shepe shulde live.\r\n  He sette not his benefice to hire,\r\n  And left his shepe accumbered in the mire,\r\n  And ran unto London unto Saint Poule’s\r\n  To seeken him a chanterie for souls,\r\n  Or with a brotherhede to be withold,\r\n  But dwelt at home and kepte well his fold,\r\n  So that the wolfe made him not miscarry.\r\n  He was a shepherd and no mercenarie,\r\n  And though he holy were and virtuous,\r\n  He was to sinful men not despitous,\r\n  Ne of his speche dangerous ne digne,[637]\r\n  But in his teaching discrete and benigne.\r\n  To drawen folk to heaven with fairenesse\r\n  By good ensample was his businesse.\r\n  But if it were any persone obstinat,\r\n  What so he were of highe or low estate,\r\n  Him wolde he snibben[638] sharply for the nones.\r\n  A better priest I trow nowhere non is.\r\n  He waited after no pomp ne reverence,\r\n  Ne maked him no spiced[639] conscience,\r\n  But Christes love and His apostles twelve,\r\n  He taught, but first he followed it himselve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: King’s College Chapel, Cambridge, 15th century.]\r\n\r\nThe fifteenth century is generally believed to have been especially\r\nreligiously dead. There are two ways of looking at it; we may talk, not\r\nwithout some reason, of the stagnation of the fag end of mediævalism, of\r\nthe wealth and worldliness and neglect of the prelates, of the\r\nsuperstition of the people, and so forth; but one fact, which still exists\r\nall over the country, is enough by itself to work instant conviction that\r\nthere is another side to the question--the church building of the century.\r\nOur forefathers in the fifteenth century had enough of life and\r\noriginality to develop here in England a new variety of Gothic art\r\ndistinctly different from the development of the art on the Continent of\r\nEurope; a reaction against the luxuriant beauty of the Decorated; with a\r\nmasculine strength in its lines, and a practical modification of plan and\r\nelevation so as to obtain spacious, lofty interiors. Take its grand towers\r\nas a measure of its artistic power; call to mind the use of painted\r\nwindows as the great means of coloured decoration; study the elaboration\r\nand richness of the roofs and chancel screens of Norfolk and Devon.\r\nCalculate the immense quantity of church architecture and art executed in\r\nthe fifteenth century, not only in monasteries and cathedrals, but in\r\nparish churches; think of the magnificent parish churches of Norfolk,\r\nSuffolk, Lincolnshire, and Somerset, and of the rising towns in Yorkshire\r\nand Lancashire. Remember that they were not commissioned and paid for by\r\nthe parochial clergy, for we have shown that they had nothing to spare;\r\nnot by the nobility, for they were half ruined by the Wars of the Roses;\r\nbut by the large minds of the rising middle class, and out of the wealth\r\nwhich trade and commerce brought them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Magdalen College, Oxford, 15th century.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: St. Michael’s, Coventry, 15th century.]\r\n\r\nThis one piece of evidence is enough to prove the existence of vigorous\r\nreligious faith among the people. At the same time, kings and prelates\r\nwere founding colleges and schools, _e.g._ Winchester and Eton, New and\r\nKing’s. Country gentlemen were founding chantries and supplying themselves\r\nwith domestic chaplains, and the traders of the towns were founding gilds\r\nand services in order to obtain for themselves and those belonging to them\r\nadditional means of grace and closer pastoral care. It is not possible to\r\nbelieve in the face of such facts that there was not a great deal of very\r\nearnest religion in the fifteenth century. Abuses and false doctrines and\r\nsuperstitions there were in abundance, but the religious spirit of the\r\nfifteenth century was already striving earnestly for reform, and\r\naccumulating that force of public opinion which broke out in the\r\nReformation of the sixteenth century, and compelled Rome itself, after\r\nfrustrating the Councils of Constance and Basle, to make the reforms of\r\nthe Council of Trent.\r\n\r\nContrast this with the three centuries which followed; with the cessation\r\nof all building of new churches and the neglect of the old ones, and the\r\nshameful condition of the services in many of them; with the absence of\r\nthe extension of Church machinery to meet the needs of the increasing\r\npopulation; and it will be hard to believe that there was not much more of\r\nreligious earnestness in the fifteenth century than in those which\r\nfollowed it. The _Italian relation of England_[640] says of the people of\r\nthe later part of this century: “They all attend mass every day, and say\r\nmany paternosters in public, the women carrying long rosaries in their\r\nhands, and any who can read taking the office of Our Lady with them, and,\r\nwith some companion, reciting it in the church verse by verse in a low\r\nvoice, after the manner of the religious. They always hear mass on Sunday\r\nin their parish church, and give liberal alms because they may not offer\r\nless than a piece of money whereof fourteen are equal to a gold ducat, nor\r\ndo they omit any form incumbent upon good Christians.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the parish of Whalley in Lancashire affords an interesting\r\nillustration of the growth of parochial organization. The original parish\r\nwas a vast tract of wild hilly country, fifty miles long, covering two\r\nhundred superficial miles, in the north-west corner of Lancashire, chiefly\r\nforest and moor, with fertile pastures in the broad valleys of the Ribble,\r\nthe Hodder, the Calder, and their tributaries. The Saxon rectors were also\r\nlords of the manor; they were married men, and the rectory, together with\r\nthe manor, descended from father to son. These facts suggest that the lord\r\nof the manor, in early days after the Conversion, turned his house into a\r\nsemi-secular monastery such as those we have described (p. 35), retaining\r\nthe headship of it for himself, and handing it down to his heirs; and that\r\nin course of time, instead of developing into a monastery of a stricter\r\nkind, it changed into the parochial type of rectory. From the earliest\r\nknown time, and throughout the Saxon period, however, the reverend lords\r\nof the manor rejoiced in the title of dean, the Bishop of Worcester\r\nhaving committed to them large ecclesiastical jurisdiction over this\r\nremote and inaccessible corner of his diocese.\r\n\r\nAfter the Conquest, the lordship of this part of the country, including\r\nthe Manor of Whalley, was given to Henry de Lacy, who laid claim to the\r\nadvowson of the benefice of Whalley; but for a time the difficulty was got\r\nover by De Lacy presenting the hereditary claimant, De Lacy thus\r\nestablishing a precedent of right of presentation, the hereditary claimant\r\ntreating it as nothing more than a certificate that he was the rightful\r\nheir.\r\n\r\nThe names of the deans for several generations are given in a “Description\r\nof Blackburnshire,” which was probably written by J. Lindlay, Abbot of\r\nWhalley (A.D. 1342-1377); they are Spartlingus, Lewlphus, Cutwulph,\r\nCudwolphus, Henry the Elder, Robert, Henry the Younger, William, Geoffry\r\nthe Elder, Geoffry the Younger, and Roger.\r\n\r\nThe decree of the Lateran Council in 1215 prohibited these hereditary\r\nsuccessions to benefices, and Roger, the last dean, resigned the benefice\r\nand surrendered the advowson to the De Lacys, and “settled at the Ville of\r\nTunlay as the progenitor of a flourishing family yet subsisting after a\r\nlapse of six centuries, legitimate descendants of the Deans of Whalley and\r\nLords of Blackburnshire.”[641] Thereupon De Lacy presented Peter de\r\nCestria to the rectory,[642] and during his incumbency (in 1284)\r\nappropriated the rectory to the Monastery of Stanlaw.\r\n\r\nBefore this date--how long before is not known--there were already in the\r\nparish seven chapels of old foundation. Three of them--Clitherhow, Calne,\r\nand Burnley--are named in a charter of the time of Henry I.; a\r\nfourth--Elvethan--is named in a charter of the time of Richard I.; the\r\nrest are not named till the grant of the advowson of H. de Lacy in 1284.\r\nThe probability is that the first three or four had, from time to time,\r\nbeen founded by the old Saxon deans, in the villages which sprang up in\r\ntheir extensive manor; the remainder, perhaps, at a later period between\r\nthe Conquest and the last quarter of the thirteenth century. They were all\r\nendowed with glebe land of about thirty-five acres each.\r\n\r\nAt the next vacancy, the convent of Stanlaw entered upon its enjoyment of\r\nthe Rectory of Whalley. How they served it is not known. In old times\r\nthere is evidence that the dean had at least a chaplain and clerk to aid\r\nhim in his duties. Probably the convent retained the staff of assistant\r\nclergy, whatever it might be, and added another in place of the rector.\r\n\r\nIn 1296 the abbot and convent of Stanlaw, with the leave of their founder,\r\nH. de Lacy, and with the sanction of Pope Nicholas IV., removed their\r\nhouse to the more healthy site afforded by their new estate at Whalley.\r\nTwo years after, in 1298, Walter Langton, Bishop of Lichfield, ordained\r\nthe foundation of a perpetual vicarage with a manse, thirty acres of\r\nmeadow and corn land, with rights of pasturage, etc., and the altarage of\r\nthe mother church and its seven chapels.\r\n\r\nThirty-two years afterwards, on the petition of the abbot and convent, who\r\nrepresented the necessities of the house (it was in that year that the\r\nfoundation of the abbey church was laid) and the immoderate endowment of\r\nthe vicarage, Roger, Bishop of Lichfield, reduced the endowment of the\r\nvicarage to a manse and yard within the abbey close, with a pittance, for\r\nwhich he was to pay 13_s._ 4_d._ a year, hay and oats for his horse, the\r\nglebe lands of the chapels, and fifty-six marks in money, for which he was\r\nto bear the burden of the chapels, find a priest for each chapel, bread\r\nand wine for the Holy Communion, etc. The fourth vicar, William de Wolf,\r\nwas required, before his presentation, to bind himself by oath never to\r\nprocure an augmentation of the endowment.\r\n\r\nSo things continued till the death of the fifth vicar, John of Topcliffe,\r\nbrother of the abbot, when the abbot and convent presented one of\r\nthemselves to the vicarage, and so added its endowment to the revenues of\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nThe next matter of interest in the history of the parish is the beginning\r\nof new foundations to supply the spiritual needs of new centres of\r\npopulation. Padiham was founded in 30 Henry VI.; Whitewell, Holme, and\r\nMarsden between the reigns of Henry VI. and Henry VII.; then Newchurch in\r\nRossendale, 3 Henry VIII.; Goodshaw, 32 Henry VIII.; Newchurch in Pendle,\r\n35 Henry VIII.; Accrington was taken out of Alvetham in 1577; and lastly,\r\nBacup in Rossendale was founded in 1788.\r\n\r\nTo complete the story: at the dissolution of the monasteries the Abbot of\r\nWhalley was hanged on a charge of treason. The king made a compulsory\r\nexchange of the great tithes of the parish of Whalley, on which he seized\r\nas part of the abbey property, with the Archbishop of Canterbury, for some\r\nof the lands which belonged to the Kentish see. Archbishop Juxon augmented\r\nthe living by surrendering to it, on the renewal of a lease which brought\r\nit within his power, the whole Easter roll and surplice fees, on\r\ncondition that the curates of the chapels should receive the house, and\r\npay to the vicar in different proportions £42, which, with £38 hitherto\r\npaid, would augment the vicarage to £80. Archbishop Sancroft, on a\r\nsubsequent renewal (1685), with the fine purchased lands to provide\r\nstipends for the curates of the chapels-of-ease hitherto unprovided for.\r\n\r\nThe record of an inquisition in the time of the Commonwealth into this and\r\nneighbouring churches survives, and gives an interesting account of the\r\nparish and its chapelries. In every case the account ends with the\r\nstatement that the inhabitants desire to be made a parish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have in the case of two Rural Deaneries, by way of sample, tabulated\r\nthe benefices as entered in the “Taxatio” and the “Valor” with one another\r\nand with the modern Clergy List; with a few notes upon them.\r\n\r\nDIOCESE OF LONDON.--DEANERY OF BERDESTAPLE.\r\n\r\n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n           From Domesday Book.         |   “Taxatio” of Pope Nicholas   |\r\n                                       |     IV., 1292 A.D., p. 21.     |\r\n  -------------------------------------|--------------------------------|\r\n                                       |                        £  s. d.|\r\n  The Manor and Church belonged to the |Ecclīā de Thurrok pva    5   6  8|\r\n    See of London.                     |                                |\r\n                                       |                                |\r\n                                       |                                |\r\n                                       |                                |\r\n  Ditto                                |    \"   Oresith                 |\r\n                                       |          (cum Vicar)  16   0  0|\r\n  Cedd the Apostle of the East Saxons  |    \"   Westillebȳ     13  16  4|\r\n    founded one of his centres of      |                                |\r\n    evangelization here, A.D. 653.

No doubt the                  |\r\n    churches and chapels here mentioned had been            |\r\n    built by successive archbishops. Archbishop             |\r\n    Kilwardby, 1273 A.D., designed to found a               |\r\n    College of secular priests in the Church of             |\r\n    Wingham, but, being interrupted by death, his           |\r\n    successor Peckham carried out the design. He            |\r\n    made the Vicar also the Provost; made the               |\r\n    chapelries (except Overland) distinct                   |\r\n    parishes, appointed Vicarages in them, and              |\r\n    gave the parishes as prebends to the 5                  |\r\n    Canons, and appointed 2 priests, 2 deacons,             |\r\n    2 sub-deacons, and a sexton to the service of           |\r\n    the church.

Mr. Kemble had “no hesitation in\r\nasserting” that their religion was the same as that of the Scandinavians;\r\nhe thought that the Mark and system of land occupation which had existed\r\nlong before in their native seats was introduced in its entirety into\r\ntheir new settlements, and that every Mark had its _fanum_, _delubrum_ or\r\n_sacellum_; and, further, that the priests attached to these heathen\r\nchurches had lands--perhaps freewill offerings, too--for their support.\r\nUnder these circumstances, he argues that nothing could be more natural\r\nthan the establishment of a baptismal church in every Mark which adopted\r\nChristianity and the transference of the old endowments to the new\r\npriesthood (“The Saxons in England,” ii. 423).\r\n\r\n[6] See a list of them at p. 63.\r\n\r\n[7] 27th of the Council of London, 1102 A.D.\r\n\r\n[8] Coifi asked, _Quis aras et fana idolorum cum septis quibus erant\r\ncircumdata primus profanare debet ... pergebat ad idola ... mox\r\nappropinquabat ad fanum...._ In King Alfred’s Anglo-Saxon version of Bede,\r\n_aras_ is represented by wigbed, _fana_ by heargas, _idolorum_ by\r\ndeofolgild, a _septis_ in one place by hegum (hedges), and in the other by\r\ngetymbro. Getymbro may mean a construction of any material, but probably\r\nhere of timber (“Eccl. Hist.,” ii. c. 13).\r\n\r\n[9] There is another notice of the existence of temples among the East\r\nSaxons, in the narrative of Bishop Jaruman’s work of reclaiming the half\r\nof those people under the rule of the sub-king Sighere, when they had\r\nrelapsed to their old superstitions as the result of the great plague of\r\n664 A.D. Bede says that the people “began to restore the temples that had\r\nbeen abandoned, and to adore idols”; but Jaruman “restored them to the way\r\nof righteousness; so that, either forsaking or destroying the temples and\r\naltars which they had erected, they reopened the churches.” At first\r\nsight, the narrative gives the idea of a number of temples, and a number\r\nof churches scattered over the country; but, on consideration, we call to\r\nmind that the East Saxons had been converted by Cedd only ten or twelve\r\nyears before (653), and that we do not read of his building more than two\r\nchurches, one at Tilbury on the Thames, the other at Bradwell, at the\r\nmouth of the Blackwater, which was probably outside the district in\r\nquestion; and the temples spoken of may not have been more numerous than\r\nthe churches mentioned in the same vague terms; or Bede may have had in\r\nmind the open-air places of worship of the old religion and the prayer\r\nstations at which the Christian missionaries used to assemble their\r\nconverts (“Eccl.

Coll.,”\r\nvol. i. p. 45.\r\n\r\n[15] Some stories of the introduction of Christianity among others of the\r\nrude northern peoples are well worth giving as an illustration, in\r\nlikenesses, and in contrasts, of our own story, and especially because\r\nthey give a quantity of details which will supply the paucity of such\r\ndetails in our own histories. They are later in time, but they belong to a\r\nsimilar phase of manners.\r\n\r\nWhen Harold Klak, King of Jutland, who had received baptism on a visit to\r\nthe Court of Louis le Debonaire (A.D. 820), returned home and destroyed\r\nthe native shrines, proscribed the sacrifices, and abolished the\r\npriesthood, his people resented it, and drove him into exile.\r\n\r\nHacon of Norway had been baptized at the Court of our King Athelstan. At\r\nfirst he sent for a bishop and priests from England; a few of his intimate\r\ncompanions received baptism, and two or three churches were built in the\r\ndistrict more immediately subject to him. Then at the Froste Thing, the\r\nwinter assembly of the whole people, the king proposed to them to accept\r\nbaptism. One of the bonders replied, in the name of his fellow-chiefs,\r\n“The ancient faith which our fathers and forefathers held from the oldest\r\ntimes, though we are not so brave men as our ancestors, has served us to\r\nthe present time. If you intend to take the matter up with a high hand,\r\nand try to force us, we bonders,” he said, “have resolved among ourselves\r\nto part with you, and take some other chief, under whom we may freely and\r\nsafely enjoy the faith which suits our inclinations.” The following winter\r\nfour of the bonders bound themselves by oath to force the king to\r\nsacrifice to the gods, and to root out Christianity from Norway. The\r\nchurches were burnt, and the priests stoned, and when the king came to the\r\nYule Thing, he consented to taste the horseflesh of the sacrifice, and\r\ndrink to the gods.\r\n\r\nWhen Olaf Tryggveson gained the throne of Norway, having been baptized in\r\nEngland, he began by destroying the temples in his own territory, and\r\ndeclared that he would make all Norway Christian or die. The crisis came\r\nat the Midsummer Althing, held at Mære, where was an ancient temple; and\r\nthither all the great chiefs and bonders, and the whole strength of the\r\nheathen party, assembled. At a preliminary meeting of the bonders, Olaf\r\nproposed to them to adopt the Christian religion; they demanded, on the\r\nother hand, that he should offer sacrifice to the gods. He consented to go\r\nwith them to the temple, and entered it with a great number of his own\r\nadherents; and when the sacrifice began the king suddenly struck down the\r\nimage of Thor with his gold inlaid axe so that it rolled down at his feet;\r\nat this signal his men struck down the rest of the images from their\r\nseats, and then came forth and again demanded that the people should\r\nabandon their belief in gods who were so powerless. The people\r\nsurrendered, and “took baptism.” Subsequently, Olaf Haraldson (1015),\r\nlearning that the old sacrifices were still secretly offered at Mære, and\r\nother places, surprised a party at Mære, who were engaged in the forbidden\r\nworship, put their leader to death, and confiscated the property of the\r\nrest. Then Olaf went to the uplands, and summoned a Thing. Gudbrand, a\r\npowerful chief of the district, sent a message-token summoning the\r\npeasants far and wide to come to the Thing, and resist the king’s demand\r\nto abandon their ancient faith. Gudbrand had a temple on his own land, in\r\nwhich was an image of Thor, made up of wood, of great size, hollow within,\r\ncovered without with ornaments of gold and silver. At the first meeting,\r\nSigurd the Bishop, arrayed in his robes, with his mitre on his head, and\r\nhis staff in his hand, preached to the assembly about the true faith and\r\nthe wonderful works of God. When he had finished, one of the bonders said:\r\n“Many things are told us by this horned man, with a staff in his hand,\r\ncrooked at the top like a ram’s horn; since your God, you say, is so\r\npowerful, tell him to make it clear sunshine to-morrow, and we will meet\r\nyou here again, and do one of two things--either agree with you about this\r\nmatter, or fight you.” Accordingly, on the morrow, before sunrise, the\r\nassembly came together again to the Thing-field, Olaf and his followers on\r\none side, and Gudbrand and his men bringing with them into the field the\r\ngreat image of Thor, glittering with gold and silver, to which the heathen\r\nparty did obeisance. Olaf had given instructions beforehand to one of his\r\nchiefs, Kolbein the Strong, who usually carried besides his sword a great\r\nclub. “Dale Gudbrand,” said the king, “thinks to frighten us with his god,\r\nwho cannot even move without being carried. You say that our God is\r\ninvisible, turn your eyes to the east, and behold his splendour,” (for the\r\nsun was just rising above the horizon). And when they all turned to look,\r\nKolbein the Strong acted upon his instructions; he struck the idol with\r\nhis war-club with such force that it broke in pieces, and a number of mice\r\nran out of it among the crowd. Olaf taunted them with the helplessness of\r\nsuch a god; and Gudbrand admitted the force of the argument. “Our god will\r\nnot help us, so we will believe on the God thou believest in.” He and all\r\npresent were baptized, and received the teachers whom King Olaf and Bishop\r\nSigurd set over them, and Gudbrand himself built a church in the valley.\r\n\r\nThere was a great temple at Upsala, with idols of Thor, Woden, and Frigga,\r\nwhich was afterwards converted into a church (see Snorre Sturlusun’s\r\n“Heimskringla,” translated by S. Lang, with notes by R. B. Anderson, vol.\r\ni. pp. 103-105, 110, and vol. iv. p. 40).\r\n\r\nTemples and sacrifices seem to imply the existence of priests; but it is\r\nremarkable that, in the collisions between Hakon and the Olafs and the\r\nheathenism of Norway, there is no mention of a single priest.\r\n\r\n[16] Bede, “Eccles. Hist.,” ii. 14.\r\n\r\n[17] Ibid., ii. 16.\r\n\r\n[18] Bede, iii. 3.\r\n\r\n[19] Ibid., iii. 5.\r\n\r\n[20] Ibid., iii. 14.\r\n\r\n[21] Ibid., v. 6.

Ord. Benedict, sect. iii., part 2). So it was a\r\ncustom with “St. Kentigern to erect a cross in any place where he had\r\nconverted the people, and where he had been staying for a time” (“Vita\r\nKentigerni,” by Joscelin, the Monk of Furness). Adalbert, a Gallic bishop,\r\nin the time of St. Boniface, preached in fields and at wells, and set up\r\nlittle crosses and oratories in various places.\r\n\r\n[26] The church at Bradfield-on-Avon, recently discovered, unaltered and\r\nuninjured, was probably the church of one of these monasteries.\r\n\r\n[27] Of the early monasteries of the East Saxons, the East Anglians, the\r\nSouth Saxons, and of the Dioceses of Rochester and Hereford, little is\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n[28] “Historical Church Atlas,” E.

The way in which the\r\nparochial duties were divided is indicated by two examples given in\r\nWhitaker’s “Craven” (p. 504). Linton has two rectors, who take the service\r\nin alternate weeks; they have their stalls on either side of the choir,\r\nand parsonage houses nearly adjoining one another. So at Bonsal each\r\nrector has his own stall and pulpit.\r\n\r\nSometimes each mediety had its own church. The churches of Willingale\r\nSpain and Willingale Doe, in Essex, are in the same churchyard. At\r\nPakefield, Suffolk, there is a double church, each with its choir and nave\r\nand altar, divided only by an open arcade.\r\n\r\n[45] Bôt = compensation.\r\n\r\n[46] This is the earliest notice (in England at least) of the ancient\r\ncustom of having a confirmation god-parent, different from the baptismal\r\nsponsors. There are other notices of it in the canons of Edgar (see p. 69)\r\nand the twenty-second of the laws of Canute; and in many canons of English\r\nMediæval Diocesan Councils. Queen Elizabeth and Edward VI. were each\r\nbaptized and confirmed at the same time, and, according to primitive\r\ncustom, each had three baptismal sponsors and one confirmation god-parent.\r\nIt is still enjoined by the third rubric at the end of the Church\r\nCatechism and by the twenty-ninth of the canons of 1603.\r\n\r\n[47] _i.e._ be scourged.\r\n\r\n[48] So it is usually stated, but the date and place of the council are\r\nvery questionable.\r\n\r\n[49] Zachary’s letters to the English inhabitants of Britain were in Latin\r\nand English. The documents are not on record, but we are told that they\r\nwere read at the Council; in them he “familiariter admonebat et veraciter\r\nconveniebat et postremo amabiliter exorabat,” and to those who despise\r\nthese modes of address he “anathematis sententiam procul dubio properandam\r\ninsinuabat.”\r\n\r\n[50] This prayer is as follows: “O Lord, we beseech Thee, of Thy great\r\nmercy, grant that the soul of (such a person) may be secured in a state of\r\npeace and repose, and that he may be admitted with the rest of Thy saints\r\ninto the region of light and happiness.”\r\n\r\n[51] Among the “Canons of Edgar,” the following occurs:--“A powerful man\r\nmay satisfy a sentence of seven years’ fasting in three days. Let him lay\r\naside his weapons and ornaments, and go barefoot and live hard, etc., and\r\ntake to him twelve men to fast three days on bread, water, and green\r\nherbs, and get wherever he can 7 times 120 men, who shall fast for him\r\nthree days, then will be fasted as many fasts as there are days in seven\r\nyears.”\r\n\r\n[52] Thorpe, i. 227.\r\n\r\n[53] It is not known by whose authority the ecclesiastical regulations\r\nwhich are entitled the canons of Edgar were drawn up, but they appear to\r\nbe of this date.\r\n\r\n[54] That it might be seen that they were complete and in good order, just\r\nas the laity came to the Hundred mote or Wapentake with their weapons. For\r\nlist of them see Ælfric’s Pastoral, 44.\r\n\r\n[55] To keep a copy of the constitutions made at the synod.\r\n\r\n[56] The time was subsequently shortened to seven days.\r\n\r\n[57] Probably spots of ground accounted sacred.\r\n\r\n[58] In the “vulgar tongue.”\r\n\r\n[59] The priests had a small consecrated slab of stone which they used on\r\nmissionary journeys and at other times.\r\n\r\n[60] The Legatine Council of Cealchythe (787, 5 c.) explains this by\r\nsaying he must not celebrate with naked thighs. (See Exodus xxviii. 42.)\r\n\r\n[61] For hours of service see Thorpe, “Ancient Laws,” etc., ii. 359.\r\n\r\n[62] By laws of Alfred and Guthrum, if a priest misdirect people about a\r\nfestival or fast he shall pay 30_s._\r\n\r\n[63] Meaning obscure.\r\n\r\n[64] The chief distinction between nuns and mynchens appears to have\r\nconsisted in the superior age and strictness of life of the former\r\n(Thorpe, “Ancient Laws”).\r\n\r\n[65] The laws of Canute say ½_d._ worth of wax for every hide on Easter\r\nEve, All Saints, and Purification.\r\n\r\n[66] Allusions to the Danish incursions.\r\n\r\n[67] Fifth law of Ine.\r\n\r\n[68] Law 16.\r\n\r\n[69] Law 17.\r\n\r\n[70] Mr. Kemble, as we have seen, is of opinion that the people in those\r\ndays of heathendom had a temple in every township, and that the priesthood\r\nwere endowed with lands as well as offerings, but we do not find\r\nsufficient evidence of this.\r\n\r\n[71] The monks of Jumieges, in the seventh century, fitted out vessels and\r\nsailed great distances to redeem slaves. St. Eligius spent large sums in\r\nredeeming them--20, 50, 100 at a time. Christian missionaries bought\r\nslaves, and trained them as Christians.\r\n\r\n[72] “Diplomatarium Anglicanum.”\r\n\r\n[73] “Collier,” i. 241. The Cathedral Churches of the Continent were\r\nuniversally served by Canons.\r\n\r\n[74] Bishop of Oxford’s “Select Charters,” p. 73.\r\n\r\n[75] Robert d’Oyley, a powerful Norman noble, repaired the ruinous\r\nparochial churches in and out of Oxford in the reign of William I.\r\n(Brewer, “Endowment, etc., of the Church of England,” p. 74). Corsuen\r\nbuilt a number of houses and two churches on a piece of land granted to\r\nhim in the suburb of Lincoln. (?

(Whitaker’s “Craven”).\r\n\r\n[79] Orderic, iv. xxiv.\r\n\r\n[80] It was stopped by Innocent III. in a decretal letter to the\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury, c. 1200.\r\n\r\n[81] See Sir H. Ellis’s “Introduction to Domesday,” i. 324, 325.\r\n\r\n[82] The Church of Gisburn, Yorkshire, was given to the Nunnery of\r\nStainfield, Lincolnshire, by a Percy. For fifty years the nuns simply\r\npresented to the rectory like any other patron; then in 1226 Archbishop\r\nWalter Gray assigned them _ad proprios usus_, half a carucate of the glebe\r\nland, and the tithe of corn in various places named, but without endowing\r\na vicarage, and the convent presented six more rectors under those\r\nconditions; it was not until 1341 that a vicarage was ordained.\r\n(Whitaker’s “Craven,” p. 45).\r\n\r\n[83] This Council also forbade a vicar to hold more than one parish.\r\n\r\n[84] Where the religious house was situated in or near the parish church,\r\nspecial arrangements were not infrequently made. At Tortington, near\r\nArundel, Sussex, was a small house of Austin canons which existed before\r\nthe time of King John. The vicar of the parish had a corrody in the house,\r\nconsisting of a right to board and lodging for himself and a serving boy.\r\nAt Sybeton, Suffolk, the vicar and curate had their lodging and food in\r\nthe religious house (“Valor,” iii. 442). At Taunton, in 1308, the Priory\r\nsupplied the vicar with allowances of bread and ale, and hay and corn, and\r\ntwo shillings a year for the shoeing of his horse (“Bath and Wells,” p.\r\n121, S.P.C.K.). See also Lenton, p. 404.\r\n\r\n[85] One of the constitutions of Archbishop Stratford (1333) requires\r\nreligious appropriators of churches to give a benefaction to the poor\r\nyearly, according to the judgment of the bishop, on pain of sequestration.\r\n\r\n[86] Newcourt’s “Repertorium,” ii. 310. Upon making an appropriation an\r\nannual pension was usually reserved to the bishop and his successors,\r\npayable by the body benefited, for a recompense of the profits which the\r\nbishops would otherwise have received (Sir R. Phillimore, “Ecclesiastical\r\nLaw”).\r\n\r\n[87] _i.e._, which had obtained from the Court of Rome exemption from the\r\nBishop’s ordinary jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n[88] According to Matthew Paris, “the bishops of England at that time\r\ndesigned to recover from the monasteries all the appropriated churches.\r\nGrostete of Lincoln took steps to carry out the design in his diocese, but\r\nthe monks appealed to Rome and defeated the bishop” (Matthew Paris, Bohn’s\r\ned., ii. pp. 325, 326, 401, 420).\r\n\r\n[89] Gray’s “Register,” p. 113.

In 1303, Archbishop Corbridge ordained that the church should be\r\nserved by a fit vicar and his ministers. In 1307 there was another\r\n“taxation,” a third in 1322, and a fourth in 1455 (Whitaker, “Craven,” p.\r\n145).\r\n\r\n[98] In the Episcopal Register of Lincoln, under date 25th April, 1511,\r\nWilliam, Abbot of Oseney, was admitted to the Vicarage of St. Mary\r\nMagdalen, Oxford, on the presentation of the Abbot and Convent of the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n[99] “Lichfield,” p. 138, S.P.C.K.\r\n\r\n[100] It was this which made a rectory so much like a small monastery in\r\nits constitution, that rectories were often called minsters, and\r\nmonasteries often merged into rectories.\r\n\r\n[101] Hopesay and Hopton, originally probably chapels parochial of Clun,\r\nwere of the nature of free chapels, _i.e._ not at the disposal of the\r\nbaroness or of the rector, but only of the lord of the fee (Eyton’s\r\n“Shropshire,” ix. 258).\r\n\r\n[102] Eyton’s “Shropshire,” viii. 149.\r\n\r\n[103] The two chapels of Rilston and Coniston--(Coniston chapel is very\r\nearly Norman, or still earlier, with triangular windows)--in the parish of\r\nBurnsal, co. York, as late as the beginning of this century had had no\r\nchaplains or separate endowment, but were still served in the primitive\r\nmode by the Rector of Burnsal; both have cylindrical fonts of high\r\nantiquity, and therefore must always have had the sacramentalia. Chapels\r\nwith these rights were always presentable, and served by chaplains who\r\ntook an oath of obedience to the rector, and were not removable at\r\npleasure; whereas mere chapels-of-ease were served by stipendiaries\r\nremovable, or by the parish priest himself (Whitaker’s “Craven,” p. 528).\r\n\r\n[104] The probable explanation is that the lord of the ville of Billingley\r\nhad made some arrangement with the mother church for the payment of half\r\nhis tithe to his own chapel; the small payments from the other chapels\r\nwere acknowledgments of subjection.\r\n\r\n[105] The original deed is in possession of Mr. G. Morris, of Shrewsbury.\r\n“Know all men, both now and hereafter, on the day of the dedication of the\r\ncemetery of Eston that I, Robert, son of Aher, gave to God and to the\r\nchapel of the same vill of Eston one virgate of land, containing sixty\r\nacres, and all tithe of my demesne of the same vill, and one mansion, for\r\nthe health of my soul and of all my predecessors and successors.

Thomas Becket was the son of a\r\nLondon citizen; Richard, of humble parents; Baldwin, of humble parents at\r\nExeter; Richard Grant, parentage unknown; Edmund Rich, son of a merchant\r\nat Abingdon; Richard Kilwardby, a Dominican friar of unknown parentage;\r\nRobert Winchelsey, probably of humble birth; Walter Reynolds, the son of a\r\nbaker at Windsor; Chichele, a shepherd-boy, picked up and educated by\r\nWilliam of Wykham; Cranmer’s people were small squires in Notts. And so in\r\nother sees. Ralph Flambard, Bishop of Durham, the great Justiciar of Henry\r\nI., was the son of a poor Norman priest; Thomas of Rotherham, Archbishop\r\nof York, was of obscure parentage; Richard of Wych, the saintly Bishop of\r\nChichester, was the son of a decayed farmer at Droitwich, and for several\r\nyears worked on the land like a labourer; the famous Grostete was of a\r\npoor family at Stradbroke, Suffolk; Thomas of Beckington, Bishop of Bath\r\nand Wells, is said to have been the son of a weaver; John of Sheppey was\r\ntaken up and educated by Hamo, Bishop of Rochester, and succeeded his\r\nbenefactor in the see.\r\n\r\n[131] By 9 Ed. II. c. 8, clerks in the king’s service were declared not\r\nbound to residence on their benefice.\r\n\r\n[132] The custom might sometimes be misleading. Thus, a priest in the\r\ndiocese of Bath and Wells with the high-sounding name of Richard de Burgh,\r\nwas a villein of the bishop who had given him freedom and holy orders.\r\n\r\n[133] See notice of the college founded by Archbishop Thomas of Rotherham,\r\np. 517.\r\n\r\n[134] The universal ignorance of the Greek language at that time made the\r\ngreat works of the Eastern Church a sealed book to the scholars of the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\n[135] At the Council of Trent, nearly three hundred years after his death,\r\nthe “Summa” was placed on the secretary’s desk beside the Holy Scriptures,\r\nas containing the orthodox solution of all theological questions.\r\n\r\n[136] Wesley published an edition of it.\r\n\r\n[137] Peter Lombard’s “Text-book.”\r\n\r\n[138] “Norfolk Archæology,” vol. iv. p. 342.\r\n\r\n[139] “Lincoln,” p. 194.

The bishop, the archdeacon, and their\r\nattendants were passing the night there, probably after a Visitation. The\r\nrecord tells us in full detail how, after the Bishop had gone out of the\r\nhall of the rectory into the chamber, the family remaining in the hall,\r\nNicholas de Skelton uttered threats against John of Auckland, the servant\r\nof the archdeacon, viz. that he would break his head. One of the\r\narchdeacon’s people intervened, when the angry Nicholas threatened to\r\nbreak his head also. The archdeacon seems to have then interfered, when a\r\nservant of Nicholas, offering to strike the archdeacon with a hawking\r\nstaff, the archdeacon drew his _cultellum_; the servant broke it in two\r\nwith his staff; the archdeacon hurled the half which he held, and it\r\nkilled another of the company who happened to interpose. The archdeacon\r\nwas summoned before the Court to answer for the homicide.\r\n\r\n[174] Quoted from “Scenes and Characters of the Middle Ages,” p. 248, by\r\nthe present writer.\r\n\r\n[175] Cushion for the back and seat of the bench.\r\n\r\n[176] “Wills and Inventories” (Surtees Society), p. 54.\r\n\r\n[177] “Testamenta Ebor.,” i. p. 371.\r\n\r\n[178] “Testamenta Ebor.,” i. p. 385.\r\n\r\n[179] “Testamenta Ebor.,” i. p. 82.\r\n\r\n[180] York: “Wills and Inventories,” p. 117.\r\n\r\n[181] “Essex Archæol.

Fowler, c. 1570, were sentenced to do penance in\r\nchurch for working on a Sunday (“Ecclesiastical Proceedings of the Courts\r\nof Durham” (Surtees Society), p. 105). Again, c. 1450, several persons\r\naccused of working on Sundays and saints’ days were sentenced to precede\r\nthe procession as penitents, to receive two “fustigations,” and to abstain\r\nfrom so offending in future under a penalty of 6_s._ 8_d._ (pp. 28-30). In\r\n1451, Isabella Hunter and Katherine Pykering were sentenced, for washing\r\nlinen on the festival of St. Mary Magdalene, to receive two fustigations\r\n_cum manipulo lini_ (p. 30).\r\n\r\nFrancis Gray was admonished to come to church on Sunday under penalty of\r\n4_d._, and on the festivals under penalty of 2_d._, to be applied to the\r\nfabric of the church of Durham (p. 27).\r\n\r\nThe same year Thomas Kirkham and Thomas Hunter, accused of mowing a\r\ncertain meadow on the festival of St. Oswald and receiving payment for it,\r\nwere sentenced to precede the procession, carrying in hand a bottle of\r\nhay, to receive four fustigations, and not to offend again under penalty\r\nof 10_s._ (p. 32).\r\n\r\n[195] Lyndwode says, “It maybe gathered that mass was always preceded by\r\nmatins or primes” (iii. 23).\r\n\r\n[196] This was the normal hour in the time of Gregory of Tours and of\r\nGregory the Great.\r\n\r\n[197] Bishop Poore, in his “Rule for Anchoresses,” advises them not to be\r\ncommunicated oftener than twelve times a year.

Horstman, 1895. Here is a short example\r\nfrom “The Book made by Richard Hampole, Hermit, for an Anchoress” (Early\r\nEng. Text Society). “Wit thou well that a bodily turning to God without\r\nthine heart following, is but a figure and likeness of virtue and of no\r\nsoothfastness. Therefore a wretched man or woman is that who neglecteth\r\nall the inward keepings of himself, and maketh himself outwardly a form\r\nonly and likeness of holiness in habit or clothing, in speech and in\r\nbodily works, beholding other men’s deeds and judging their faults,\r\nthinking himself to be something when he is nothing, and so neglecteth\r\nhimself. Do thou not so, but turn thine heart with thy body principally to\r\nGod, and shape thee within in His likeness, by meekness and charity and\r\nother spiritual virtues, and then art thou truly turned to Him.”\r\n\r\n[217] See “The Parson’s Tale,” in Chaucer’s “Canterbury Tales.”\r\n\r\n[218] Also in the Stowe MS. 89, 2, there are a series of trees\r\nrepresenting virtues and vices.\r\n\r\n[219] Together.\r\n\r\n[220] Other sponsors were required at the Confirmation (see p. 59).\r\n\r\n[221] Archbishop Simon of Sudbury, 1378, made a Constitution that all\r\nshould confess and communicate thrice a year, viz. Easter, Pentecost, and\r\nChristmas, on pain of excommunication and refusal of burial (Johnson’s\r\n“Laws and Canons,” ii. 444).\r\n\r\n[222] Death.\r\n\r\n[223] In the latter part of the eleventh century, for reasons of\r\nexpediency, the custom was introduced of dipping the bread into the wine,\r\nand so administering to the communicants. This was condemned by the\r\nCouncil of Claremont 1095, but kept its ground in England till forbidden\r\nby the Council of London in 1175. The withdrawal of the wine from the\r\nlaity altogether began in the twelfth century. Anselm had prepared the way\r\nby affirming that “the whole Christ was taken under either species.”\r\nRobert Pulleyn, 1170, taught that the flesh of Christ alone should be\r\ndistributed to the laity. The practice came into gradual use in the\r\nthirteenth century; the second canon of Archbishop Peckham, 1281, bids the\r\nparish priests to teach the more ignorant of the laity that the body and\r\nblood of Christ are received under the single species of the bread. It is\r\nbelieved not to have become general in England till it was ordered by the\r\nCouncil of Constance in 1415, which excommunicated all priests who should\r\ncommunicate the laity in both kinds. It is to be observed that in the\r\nSarum Missal there is no recognition whatever of administration in one\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nIn some churches there was an endowment for the provision of the holy\r\nbread, as at St. Mary Magdalen, Colchester.\r\n\r\n[224] Gravely.\r\n\r\n[225] Both.\r\n\r\n[226] Hence.\r\n\r\n[227] Maiden.\r\n\r\n[228] This was first ordered by Pope Honorius III. in 1217.\r\n\r\n[229] The churchyard was frequently called the “sanctuary.”\r\n\r\n[230] Ratified.\r\n\r\n[231] In baptism.\r\n\r\n[232] Locked.\r\n\r\n[233] There are various forms on record of this “general sentence of\r\nexcommunication.” Two are given at pp. 86 and 119 of the “York Manual”\r\n(Surtees Society).\r\n\r\n[234] Upon.\r\n\r\n[235] Go.\r\n\r\n[236] See plate opposite.\r\n\r\n[237] Printed by the Early English Text Society.\r\n\r\n[238] Chasuble.\r\n\r\n[239] Believe.\r\n\r\n[240] Another version says, “Don’t wait for the priest to ask for the mass\r\npenny, but go up and offer, though there is no obligation; it will make\r\nyour chattle increase in your coffer.”\r\n\r\n[241] From another version of the book we extract the following sentence,\r\nwhich contains an expression of the doctrine of the Eucharist--\r\n\r\n  Every day thou mayest see\r\n  The same body that died for thee,\r\n  Tent[A] if thou wilt take,\r\n  In figure and in form of bread,\r\n  That Jesus dealt ere He were dead,\r\n  For His disciples’ sake.\r\n\r\n    [A] Heed.\r\n\r\n[242] Abroad.\r\n\r\n[243] Dead.\r\n\r\n[244] Give utterance to.\r\n\r\n[245] Also.\r\n\r\n[246] “The Epic of the Fall of Man” (S.

The last two bishops of Elmham, Stigand and\r\nEthelmar, appointed by the saintly and ascetic Edward the Confessor, were\r\nmarried men; so was Herbert, the first bishop of the same see (removed to\r\nNorwich), appointed by the Conqueror, and perhaps the second William\r\n(1086), and Edward (1121). Robert Bloet, Bishop of Lincoln (1094), had a\r\nson Simon, whom he made Dean of that Cathedral. Roger of Salisbury (1107)\r\nwas married. Robert Lymesey, of Chester (1086-1117), left a daughter\r\nsettled with her husband, Noel, on the see lands near Eccleshall; and\r\nHugh, Dean of Derby in this episcopate, was married. Roger of Lichfield\r\n(1121) was a married man; he put his son Richard into the Archdeaconry of\r\nCoventry, and he was afterwards promoted to the see (1161). Three Bishops\r\nof Durham were married men, viz. Ralph Flambard (1099), Geoffrey Rufus\r\n(1133), and the famous Hugh Puiset (1153); the wife of the latter was a\r\nlady of the Percy family. Several Archbishops of York were the sons of\r\nmarried clergymen.\r\n\r\nThere is an extant letter from Thomas, the first Norman Archbishop of\r\nYork, in which he complains that his canons were married men. The Canons\r\nof Durham turned out by Bishop William of S. Carilef (1081) were all\r\nmarried men, so were some of those turned out of Rochester Cathedral by\r\nBishop Gundulf; one of them, Ægelric, who had retired to the Benefice of\r\nChatham, on his wife’s death obtained her burial by the monks of the\r\nCathedral in the most honourable manner (S.P.C.K., “Rochester,” p. 50).\r\n\r\n[253] At a visitation of Lincoln Cathedral by Bishop Bokingham, 1363-1398,\r\nit appeared that almost all the cathedral clergy disobeyed the canons\r\n(S.P.C.K., “Lincoln,” p. 84). A statute of the Chapter of Bath and Wells,\r\nin 1323, forbade any canon who had a concubine [wife] before his\r\nappointment to meet her except in the presence of discreet witnesses. So\r\nlate as 1520 the Vicar-General had occasion to admonish the dean to\r\ncorrect one of the canons for keeping a concubine [wife] in his house of\r\nresidence. The use of the ugly word by which the canons described these\r\npersons was not indefensible; the old laws of Imperial Rome recognized a\r\nkind of marriage with an inferior wife as respectable, it went so far at\r\none time as to require unmarried proconsuls to take such a wife with them\r\nto their province, and this was not to prevent them from making afterwards\r\na legal marriage. For example, St. Helena was first the concubine of\r\nConstantius, and he afterwards raised her to the higher dignity of his\r\nwife, and Constantine, their son, raised her to the dignity of empress.\r\n\r\n[254] In 1221 and the following years, the pope issued mandates to the\r\nEnglish bishops bidding them deprive married clerks (“Papal Letters,” vol.\r\ni. pp. 79, 84, 86, 90, Rolls Series).\r\n\r\n[255] See also Roger of Wendover under 1225, ii. 287, Rolls Series.\r\n\r\n[256] This is an allusion to another canon which made it illegal for a man\r\nto separate from his wife in order to enter into a religious order\r\nrequiring a vow of celibacy, without his wife’s consent.\r\n\r\n[257] One explanation of the frequent repetition of these canons by\r\nsuccessive synods is that in those early days it was not a matter of\r\ncourse that a law once made stood good until repealed; rather, on the\r\ncontrary, that a law lapsed by desuetude, and needed to be re-enacted from\r\ntime to time to keep it in vigour. The early kings renewed their\r\npredecessors’ concessions; grantees sought the confirmation of charters\r\nfrom the heir of the original grantor; and laws of Parliament were often\r\npassed again by subsequent Parliaments. So a new archbishop began his\r\nreign by calling the provincial synod together and issuing a set of\r\nprovincial constitutions, repeating former canons, which it was still\r\nnecessary to keep in active use.\r\n\r\n[258] In the debates of the Twenty-fourth Session of the Council of Trent,\r\nin the autumn of 1563, one patriarch declared that the proposed decree\r\nannulling clandestine marriages was directly opposed to the law of God,\r\nand that he would resist it at the peril of his life (Bishop of Bristol,\r\n“On what are the Papal Claims founded?”--S.P.C.K.).\r\n\r\n[259] Hook’s “Lives of the Archbishops of Canterbury,” vi. 317.\r\n\r\n[260] It is very significant that after the Reformation legislation had\r\nlegalized clerical marriages, the wives of the bishops did not openly live\r\nin their palaces with them, but in houses of their own. It was a survival\r\nof the custom that ecclesiastics might have wives, but that their wives\r\nmight not be introduced into society.\r\n\r\n[261] “Harl.,” 862, p. 221. A more important example is that of Margaret\r\nCountess of Flanders, who married a deacon, and subsequently repudiated\r\nhim and married again, with the result of a disputed succession (Matthew\r\nParis, under 1254 A.D., v. 435, Rolls Series).\r\n\r\n[262] “Transactions of the Gloucester Archæol.

The founder,\r\nin 1120, Robert de Hara, stipulated [for himself and his descendants, we\r\ntake for granted] that he should choose one of the monks to officiate in\r\nthe chapel at his neighbouring manor house of Halnaker; and that if at any\r\ntime the monks should fail to elect to a vacancy in the office of prior\r\nwithin three months, he should nominate.\r\n\r\nThe prioress and nuns of Mount Grace, c. 1250, bound themselves to present\r\neach successive Prioress for approval to John le Verdun, their patron\r\n(_advocato nostro_), and his heirs or their deputies (“Eccl.

Hist.,” iii. p. 396). There\r\nhave been very erroneous estimates current. The Parliament of 1371 granted\r\nto the king a sum of £50,000, to be raised by contribution of 22_s._ 3_d._\r\nfrom each parish, there being, according to the common opinion, 40,000\r\nparishes in England. On this the Bishop of Oxford makes a note (“Const.\r\nHist.,” ii. 459) that it is an illustration of the absolute\r\nuntrustworthiness of mediæval figures, which, even when most\r\ncircumstantially minute, cannot be accepted, except where as in the public\r\naccounts vouchers can be quoted. The returns to a writ issued by the king\r\nto the local authorities of each shire to certify the number of parishes\r\nin it, showed that there were only 8669. Stow, in his “Annals,” p. 268,\r\ngives the returns _in extenso_. The anonymous author of the famous libel,\r\n“A Supplication for Beggars,” says there are within the realm of England\r\n52,000 parish churches. Maskell, in his “Monumenta Ritualia,” I. ccij,\r\nmentions several MSS. in the British Museum which contain memoranda on the\r\nsubject, Royal 8 B xv., Royal 8 D iv., Titus D 3. In the first, in a\r\nfifteenth-century handwriting, is a note _sunt in Regno Angliæ Ecclesiæ\r\nparochiales_, 46,100.\r\n\r\n[421] In 1371 the smaller benefices and chantries were taxed by the king\r\n(Stowe, “Annales,” p. 268).\r\n\r\n[422] The following are the details for the several dioceses (except\r\nDurham and Chester):--\r\n\r\n              Diocese.

So that we at once see not only the ancient extent and\r\namount of that provision which was made by the piety of the English nation\r\nfor the spiritual edification of the people, by the erection of churches\r\nand chapels for the decent performance of the simple and touching\r\nordinances of the Christian religion; but how large a proportion had been\r\nsaved from private appropriation of the produce of the soil, and how much\r\nhad been subsequently given, to form a public fund accessible to all, out\r\nof which might be supported an order of cultivated and more enlightened\r\nmen dispersed through society, and by means of which blessings\r\nincalculable might be spread amongst the whole community.

His name was inscribed in the register by the monks of St.\r\nEvroult for the many benefits he conferred on the abbey, and masses,\r\nprayers, and alms were appointed for him as if he had been a brother there\r\nprofessed (i. 269).\r\n\r\nSome of the monks of St. Evroult contributed largely to the monastery, and\r\nprocured from their relations, acquaintances, and friends donations of\r\ntithes and churches, and ecclesiastical ornaments for the use of the\r\nbrethren.\r\n\r\n[498] Surtees Society, the “Liber Vitæ of Durham.”\r\n\r\n[499] There were, in fact, a few others; _e.g._ the Domestic Chapel at the\r\nVyne, Hampshire, had been founded as a chantry.\r\n\r\n[500] In Yorkshire, less than a dozen are recorded before the fourteenth\r\ncentury, about a quarter of the whole number were founded between 1300 and\r\n1350, the greatest number from 1450 to 1500 (Page’s “Yorkshire Chantries,”\r\nSurtees Society).\r\n\r\n[501] If groups of united chantries be reckoned as one, or 53 if each be\r\ncounted separately; served by 52 priests, with an average income of £7\r\n9_s._ 6_d._ The chantry priests lived in a mansion founded for them called\r\nPriest’s House, or in the chambers of their respective chantries (“St.\r\nPaul’s and Old City Life,” p. 100, W. S. Simpson).\r\n\r\n[502] For another example of a foundation deed of a chantry, see that of\r\nThomas, Earl of Derby (p. 469), in Blackburn parish church, 1514\r\n(Whitaker’s “Whalley,” ii. 322)\r\n\r\n[503] Dan John Raventhorpe leaves a wooden side altar with a cupboard\r\nbeneath the said altar (almariolum subtus idem altare) to keep the books\r\nand vestments.

Richard of Ravenser, Archdeacon of Lincoln, 1385,\r\nleaves 2_s._ to every nun of the Order of Sempringham and every anchorite\r\nor recluse in Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, and numerous other bequests to\r\nreligious houses, besides a manor and certain tenements to be sold in aid\r\nof a chaplain of the vicars [choral] of Lincoln, to celebrate at St.\r\nGiles’s Without, Lincoln, for him, etc. William Wintringham, Canon of\r\nLincoln, 1415, left 200 marks for mortuary masses. Richard Croxton, Canon\r\nof Lincoln, 1383, left £50 for masses for ten years. John of Haddon, Canon\r\nof Lincoln, 1374, left £21 to find two chaplains for two years. Robert of\r\nAusthorpe, Doctor of Laws and Licentiate in Arts, 1372, left 20_s._ for\r\nmasses. Stephen of Hoghton, Rector of the Mediety of Lesyngham, 1390, left\r\n20_s._ and two books to the Prior and Convent of Nocton for a perpetual\r\nanniversary. Robert of Lottryngton, Rector of Gosberkyrk, 1391, left £10\r\nand his portiforium and psalterium to his church, and a bequest for two\r\nchaplains to celebrate for him for a year. Richard Morys, Rector of\r\nBryngton, 1396, leaves £4 to Mr. William Ynflet, to celebrate for him (A.\r\nGibbons, “Early Lincoln Wills”).\r\n\r\n[517] “Early Lincoln Wills,” p. 158.\r\n\r\n[518] There are chantry chapels in two stories at Hereford and Gloucester\r\nCathedrals, and Tewkesbury, and two at East Horndon, Essex.\r\n\r\n[519] A.

The body was then washed and laid on a bier; vespers for the day\r\nwere said, followed by the _Vigiliæ Mortuorum_, divided into several\r\nparts, the special vespers and special matins known from their respective\r\nantiphons as the _Placebo_ and _Dirige_. The body was then carried in\r\nprocession to church.

T.\r\nHugo’s “Extracts,” p. 88). In the register of Montacute, Bishop of Ely,\r\n1337, licence was given to Mr. Nicho. de Canterbury, _stare in obsequiis_\r\nof J. de Polleyne for two years, and this at the instance of Dnus. John de\r\nPolleyne. The same year licence was given to Dnus. Richard Rupel, Rector\r\nof the Church of Carlton _quod possit stare in obsequiis_ of Dni. Paris\r\nLewen for two years.\r\n\r\n[546] The chantry priests of London, having been summoned by the bishop in\r\n1532, and desired to contribute towards the £100,000 demanded by King\r\nHenry VIII. of the clergy, made such a stir that the bishop dismissed them\r\nfor the time, and afterwards had some arrested and imprisoned (Stow’s\r\n“Chronicle,” p. 559).\r\n\r\n[547] Enough.\r\n\r\n[548] Also at Bromley. See Whitaker’s “Whalley.”\r\n\r\n[549] Page’s “Yorkshire Chantries.”\r\n\r\n[550] “Lay Folks’ Mass Book.”\r\n\r\n[551] “York Fabric Rolls.”\r\n\r\n[552] In the “Calendar of Chantries” there are forty-two such schools\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\n[553] Whitaker’s “History of Whalley,” ii. 322.\r\n\r\n[554] Whitaker, “Craven,” p. 147.\r\n\r\n[555] Ibid., p. 326.\r\n\r\n[556] Whitaker, “Whalley,” p. 326.\r\n\r\n[557] Whitaker, “Whalley,” p. 155.\r\n\r\n[558] Whitaker, “Craven,” p. 438.\r\n\r\n[559] For example, the chantry chapel of Billericay, Essex, continued in\r\nthis condition until Bishop Blomfield induced the trustees to surrender\r\nthe chapel and the right of presentation to it to the bishop, on condition\r\nof a stipend of £120 being settled upon it from Queen Anne’s Bounty Fund.\r\n\r\n[560] The rule of the Ludlow Gild was that, “if any of the brethren or\r\nsisters be brought to such want that they have not enough to live upon,\r\nthen, once, twice, thrice, but not a fourth time, as much help shall be\r\ngiven them, out of the goods of the gild, as the rectors and stewards,\r\nhaving regard to their deserts, and to the means of the gild, shall\r\norder.... If any brother or sister be wrongfully cast into prison, the\r\ngild shall do its utmost, and spend money, to get him out.... If any fall\r\ninto grievous sickness, they shall be helped, both as to their bodily\r\nneeds and other wants, out of the common fund of the gild, until their\r\nhealth is renewed as before. If any one becomes a leper, or blind, or\r\nmaimed, or smitten with any incurable disorder (which God forbid), we will\r\nthat the goods of the gild shall be largely bestowed on him.... If any\r\ngood girl of the gild cannot have the means found her by her father,\r\neither to go into a religious house or to marry, whichever she wishes to\r\ndo, friendly and right help shall be given her out of our means, and our\r\ncommon chest, towards enabling her do whichever of the two she wishes.”\r\nThe rules of one of the gilds in Hull enact that “inasmuch as the gild was\r\nfounded to cherish kindness and love, the alderman, steward, and two\r\nhelpmen in case of a quarrel between two members shall deal with the\r\nmatter, and shall earnestly strive to make them agree together without any\r\nsuit or delay, and so that no damage either to body or goods shall in any\r\nwise happen through the quarrel.” If the officials neglect to interpose\r\ntheir good offices, they are fined four pounds of wax among them; and if\r\nthe disputants will not listen to them, they shall pay four pounds of wax;\r\nand, finally, all the members of the gild shall be summoned to meet, and\r\nthe difficulty shall be referred to them for settlement.\r\n\r\n[561] By the rules of the Lancaster Gild, “on the death of a member of the\r\ngild all the brethren then in the town shall come to placebo and dirge, if\r\nsummoned by the bellman, or pay 2_d._” “All shall go to the mass held for\r\na dead brother or sister; each brother or sister so dying shall have at\r\nthe mass on the day of burial six torches and eighteen wax-lights, and at\r\nother services two torches and four wax-lights.” “If any of the gild die\r\noutside Lancaster, within twenty miles, twelve brethren shall wind and\r\ndeck the body at the cost of the gild, and if the brother or sister so\r\ndying wished to be buried where he died, the same twelve shall see that he\r\nhas fitting burial there where he died.” Some of the gilds had a hearse\r\nand embroidered pall which were used at funerals of members of the gild,\r\nand sometimes let out to others.\r\n\r\n[562] A return was made into Chancery, in the twelfth year of Richard II.\r\n(1387), of the original objects, endowments, and extent of gilds\r\ngenerally, and the masters and wardens; the records of more than 500 exist\r\nand form the substance of Toulmin Smith’s book on English gilds.\r\n\r\n[563] Page’s “Yorkshire Chantries,” p. 83.\r\n\r\n[564] See chap. xxiv. p. 417.\r\n\r\n[565] S.P.C.K., “Worcester Diocese,” p. 138.\r\n\r\n[566] From the “Valor Eccl.,” iii. 315, we learn that at Thetford, in\r\nNorfolk, there was a Gild of the Blessed Virgin Mary in a certain chapel\r\nin the Bayly end, with a master whose income was £6 13_s._ 4_d._, two\r\npriests with £5 6_s._ 8_d._ each, and two clerks with 20_s._ each.\r\n\r\nFrom the same source we learn that at Boston, Lincolnshire, there were\r\nthree gilds, one of the Blessed Virgin Mary with five chaplains, whose\r\nrevenues amounted to £24 a year; one of Corpus Christi with six chaplains,\r\nincome £32; and one of St. Peter with two chaplains, income £10 13_s._\r\n4_d._\r\n\r\nAlice Lowys, widow of Lowys of Boston, merchant, 1350, leaves bequests to\r\nthe High Altar, and to the Gilds of Blessed Mary, St. Katharine, St.\r\nGeorge, etc. (“Early Lincoln Wills,” p. 175).\r\n\r\nIsabella Longland, widow, of Henley-upon-Thames, 1527, leaves “to the hye\r\naulter of Henley Church 20_d._, and hye aulter of our Ladye a diapur cloth\r\nof iij elles and more. To the Fraternity of Jesus in the said church,\r\n4_s._; to the Gilde of our blessed lady of Boston in the dioces of\r\nLincoln, whereof I am suster, to have masses of _Scala celi_ and _dirge_\r\nshortly after my departing, 6_s._ 8_d._; to the Brotherhood of St. George\r\nand St. Christopher of York for ditto, 6_s._ 8_d._ To my sone my Lorde of\r\nLincoln, a standing cup of silver and gilt with a kever, having the image\r\nof St. Mighell, and a droigon in the toppe, and borne with iij aungells in\r\nthe foote.... To my prestes for to bere me to the churche ev’y preste,\r\n8_d._ She was the mother of John Longland, Bishop of Lincoln, 1521-1547”\r\n(Ibid., p. 208).\r\n\r\n[567] “Valor Eccl.,” iii. 237.\r\n\r\n[568] Page 468.\r\n\r\n[569] Thus Stamford had in All Saints’ Church the Gild of All Saints, the\r\nGild of St. John and St. Julian, the Gild of Corpus Christi, and Philip’s\r\nchantry. In St. Mary’s Church an endowment for stipendiaries and a\r\nchantry; in St. Stephen’s Church a chapter; in St. Clement’s Church a\r\ngild.\r\n\r\n[570] Wm. Trenourth of St. Cleer, Cornwall, 1400, leaves to the store of\r\nSt. Cleer, three sheep; to the store of St. Mary in St. Cleer Church, two\r\nsheep; to the store of Holy Cross therein, one sheep, and the same to the\r\nstore of St. James (Hingeston-Randolph, “Stafford’s Register,” p. 380).\r\n\r\n[571] W. Haselbeche, clark, 1504, leaves to the Fraternity of St. Peter,\r\nholden within the Church of Littlebury, Essex, his best brass pot and a\r\ndozen of great platters marked with C.\r\n\r\nTo the Fraternity of Our Lady’s Assumption in the Church of Haddestoo, in\r\nNorfolk, toward the buying and building of a hall for the Fraternity,\r\n26_s._ 8_d._ (“Essex Arch. Trans.” (New Series), vol. i. p. 174).\r\n\r\nIn an inventory of the goods at Chich St. Osyth Church, 6 Ed. VI., occurs:\r\n“There be the ymplements sometime belonging to the Trinity Gylde. In the\r\nhands of the churchwardens--brasse pott, weighing 3 c. 4 li.; brass pott,\r\nweying 35 li. (much obliterated by decay), ... spitts remaining; dozen of\r\npeuter, waying 31 li. And also in the hands of Sir J. Harwy, church pryst,\r\none garnyshe of peuter” (Ibid., p. 28).\r\n\r\n[572] This is illustrated in two charming pictures of the end of the\r\nfifteenth century in the Royal MS. 19 cviii. cap., folios 3 and 90, where\r\nthe town with its wall, round towers, moat and bridge, and one great\r\nchurch dominating the houses, rises out of the park-like meadows with a\r\ncastle on a neighbouring height. In the lower margin of the late\r\nfourteenth-century MS. (Royal 13 A iii.) the scribe has given a number of\r\nsketches, very neatly executed, of towns mentioned in his narrative. They\r\nare probably for the most part fancy sketches, but they serve to show that\r\nthe idea of a town in the mind of a mediæval draughtsman was a wall and\r\ngates with a grove of towers and spires soaring above. See folios 27, 32,\r\n33, 34, etc., and especially “London,” folio 56. An interesting view of a\r\ntown with a great church and several smaller towers and spires appearing\r\nover the walls is in Lydgate’s “Siege of Thebes,” 18 D. 11, folio 148.\r\n\r\n[573] It seems likely that sometimes the same proprietor built more than\r\none church for his tenants, _e.g._ Abbot Ursin is said to have built three\r\nchurches for his burgh of St. Alban (see p. 513). The Abbey of St. Edmund\r\nseems to have built two within a very short period (see p. 511). At\r\nLincoln, a lay proprietor, Colsuen, shortly after the Conquest, built\r\nthirty-six houses and two churches on a piece of waste ground outside the\r\ncity given to him by the king (“Domesday Book”).\r\n\r\n[574] References to the plan of NORWICH.

Browne, armiger, late Alderman of\r\nthe Gild of Holy Trinity of this church, and Constable of the Castle, and\r\nprincipal seneschal of the liberty of the town and receiver for Thomas\r\nWolsey, Cardinal of York, and for the Lord John Longland, Bishop of\r\nLincoln, and for the vice-count of the Counties of Notts and Derby, who\r\ndied 1532.\r\n\r\n[604] See p. 519.\r\n\r\n[605] See p. 125.\r\n\r\n[606] Thoroton gives the inscription on the tomb of Robert Kirkclaye, the\r\nfirst master of the Long School for forty-two years, who died in 1570 (?).\r\n\r\n[607] See an account of them in “Scenes and Characters of the Middle\r\nAges.” Virtue and Co.\r\n\r\n[608] “Valor,” v. p. 157.\r\n\r\n[609] Ibid., ii. p. 54.\r\n\r\n[610] Matthew Paris (under 1250 A.D.) relates a case in which Bishop\r\nGrostete deprived a clerk accused of incontinency; the clerk refused to\r\ngive up his benefice; the bishop excommunicated him; at the end of forty\r\ndays of grace, the clerk still refusing to submit, the bishop sent word to\r\nthe sheriff to take and imprison him as contumacious; the sheriff, being a\r\ngreat friend of the clerk and no friend of the bishop, delayed or refused;\r\nthe bishop thereupon excommunicated the sheriff; he complained to the\r\nking; the king applied to the pope, and obtained an order restraining the\r\nbishop (M. Paris, v. 109).\r\n\r\n[611] “Greenfield’s Register,” quoted in _Church Times_, March 11, 1898.\r\n\r\n[612] “Grostete’s Letters,” Rolls Series, p. 48.\r\n\r\n[613] S.P.C.K., “Lichfield,” p. 178.\r\n\r\n[614] “Durham Ecclesiastical Proceedings,” p. 47.\r\n\r\n[615] There is a picture of the confession of clerics in the MS. 6 E.

We are\r\nreminded of the story told by Sismondi (chap. xlix.), that when Pope Urban\r\nV., in 1369, sent two legates with a bull of excommunication to Bernabo\r\nVisconti, Duke of Milan, that strong-willed prince compelled the legates\r\nto eat the documents, parchment, leaden seals, silk cord, and all. So\r\nWalter de Clifford, in 1250, compelled a royal messenger to eat the\r\nletters he brought, with the seal (Matthew Paris, ii. 324). The writ of\r\nsummons was sometimes a small slip of parchment, or perhaps paper, and the\r\nseal a thin layer of beeswax covered with paper, so that the story is not\r\nimpossible. There are other instances on record in which the summoner was\r\ncompelled by violence to destroy his writ--in what manner is not\r\nstated--instead of serving it (“Calendar of Entries in Papal Registers,”\r\nA.D. 1247-48, pp. 239, 243).\r\n\r\n[630] The castigation by the schoolmaster of a scholar hoisted on a man’s\r\nback after the hardly obsolete fashion of our public schools is depicted\r\nin the same MS., 6 E. VI., at f. 214, under the heading “_Castigatio_;”\r\nand again in the second volume of the work (6 E. VII.), at f. 444, under\r\nthe heading “_Master_;” as if the word “castigatio” naturally suggested\r\n“schoolboy,” and the primary function of a “master” were to use the rod.\r\n\r\n[631] “Ecclesiastical Proceedings from the Courts of Durham,” p. 20.\r\n\r\n[632] Ibid., p. 21.\r\n\r\n[633] S.P.C.K., “Diocese of Lichfield,” p. 171.

Rolls Series.\r\n\r\n[636] The host asks him--\r\n\r\n  “Sire preest, quod he, art thou a vicary,\r\n  Or art thou a parson? say soth by thy fay,”\r\n\r\nbut the poet does not, by answering the question, narrow the class\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\n[637] Sparing nor proud.\r\n\r\n[638] Rebuke.\r\n\r\n[639] Scrupulous.\r\n\r\n[640] “Camden Society,” p. 23.\r\n\r\n[641] Whitaker’s “Whalley,” p. 58.\r\n\r\n[642] It appears, by a subsequent document, that he had a domestic oratory\r\nin his Hall, which stood at the east end of the churchyard.\r\n\r\n[643] United by Act of Parliament. c. 1734.\r\n\r\n[644] Morant says that a chantry was founded here in 1328.\r\n\r\n[645] Appropriated to Abbey of Stratford Langthorne.\r\n\r\n[646] The chantry was founded at and for the little town of Billericay, 1½\r\nmiles from the parish church.\r\n\r\n[647] The advowson belonged to Bilegh Abbey. Morant says (i. p. 247) West\r\nLeigh was a parish held at the Conquest by the canons of St. Paul’s\r\nadjoining this. In 1432 the abbey and the canons agreed to unite the two\r\nparishes, the abbey taking two turns of presentation and the canons one.\r\n\r\n[648] Among the smaller benefices (p. 24); the greater part of their\r\nincome having been apportioned to the Religious Houses.\r\n\r\n[649] Built by the family of Barringtone Barnton on their estate here.\r\n\r\n[650] Rectory belonged to Prittlewell Priory.\r\n\r\n[651] “Taxatio,” pp. 1, 2.\r\n\r\n[652] “Valor,” i. pp 36, 92.\r\n\r\n[653] Elder brother of the Archbishop, Archdeacon of Canterbury, “Valor,”\r\ni. p. 32.\r\n\r\n[654] William Warham, nephew of Archbishop Warham, late Archdeacon of\r\nCanterbury, “Valor,” i. p. 32.\r\n\r\n[655] In Saxon times the manor belonged to a family named Liveing; soon\r\nafter the Conquest it was in the possession of a family named Beke.\r\n\r\n[656] “Revolving in his mind God’s wonderful and great mercies to him in\r\nleading him and preferring him to such riches and eminence in Church and\r\nState, and in preserving him from danger both by sea and land, and out of\r\ngratitude to the memory of his parents and friends, at whose charge he was\r\neducated and brought to that pitch of honour, he thought he could not pay\r\na more grateful acknowledgment than to set apart a very considerable part\r\nof his estate in this manner.”--Preface to his Statutes for his College,\r\nHasted’s “Kent,” iii. 173.",
