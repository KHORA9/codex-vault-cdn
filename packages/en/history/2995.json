F. Collier & Son Company, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\r\n\r\nThe dates of the birth and death of Tacitus are uncertain, but it is\r\nprobable that he was born about 54 A. D. and died after 117. He was a\r\ncontemporary and friend of the younger Pliny, who addressed to him some\r\nof his most famous epistles. Tacitus was apparently of the equestrian\r\nclass, was an advocate by training, and had a reputation as an orator,\r\nthough none of his speeches has survived. He held a number of important\r\npublic offices, and married the daughter of Agricola, the conqueror of\r\nBritain, whose life he wrote.\r\n\r\nThe two chief works of Tacitus, the \"Annals\" and the \"Histories,\"\r\ncovered the history of Rome from the death of Augustus to A. D. 96;\r\nbut the greater part of the \"Histories\" is lost, and the fragment that\r\nremains deals only with the year 69 and part of 70. In the \"Annals\"\r\nthere are several gaps, but what survives describes a large part of the\r\nreigns of Tiberius, Claudius, and Nero. His minor works, besides the\r\nlife of Agricola, already mentioned, are a \"Dialogue on Orators\" and the\r\naccount of Germany, its situation, its inhabitants, their character and\r\ncustoms, which is here printed.\r\n\r\nTacitus stands in the front rank of the historians of antiquity for the\r\naccuracy of his learning, the fairness of his judgments, the richness,\r\nconcentration, and precision of his style. His great successor, Gibbon,\r\ncalled him a \"philosophical historian, whose writings will instruct the\r\nlast generations of mankind\"; and Montaigne knew no author \"who, in a\r\nwork of history, has taken so broad a view of human events or given a\r\nmore just analysis of particular characters.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Germany\" is a document of the greatest interest and importance,\r\nsince it gives us by far the most detailed account of the state of\r\nculture among the tribes that are the ancestors of the modern Teutonic\r\nnations, at the time when they first came into account with the\r\ncivilization of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTACITUS ON GERMANY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe whole of Germany is thus bounded; separated from Gaul, from Rhoetia\r\nand Pannonia, by the rivers Rhine and Danube; from Sarmatia and Dacia by\r\nmutual fear, or by high mountains: the rest is encompassed by the ocean,\r\nwhich forms huge bays, and comprehends a tract of islands immense in\r\nextent: for we have lately known certain nations and kingdoms there,\r\nsuch as the war discovered. The Rhine rising in the Rhoetian Alps from a\r\nsummit altogether rocky and perpendicular, after a small winding towards\r\nthe west, is lost in the Northern Ocean. The Danube issues out of the\r\nmountain Abnoba, one very high but very easy of ascent, and traversing\r\nseveral nations, falls by six streams into the Euxine Sea; for its\r\nseventh channel is absorbed in the Fenns.\r\n\r\nThe Germans, I am apt to believe, derive their original from no other\r\npeople; and are nowise mixed with different nations arriving amongst\r\nthem: since anciently those who went in search of new dwellings,\r\ntravelled not by land, but were carried in fleets; and into that mighty\r\nocean so boundless, and, as I may call it, so repugnant and forbidding,\r\nships from our world rarely enter. Moreover, besides the dangers from\r\na sea tempestuous, horrid and unknown, who would relinquish Asia, or\r\nAfrica, or Italy, to repair to Germany, a region hideous and rude, under\r\na rigorous climate, dismal to behold or to manure [to cultivate] unless\r\nthe same were his native country? In their old ballads (which amongst\r\nthem are the only sort of registers and history) they celebrate\r\n_Tuisto_, a God sprung from the earth, and _Mannus_ his son, as the\r\nfathers and founders of the nation. To _Mannus_ they assign three sons,\r\nafter whose names so many people are called; the Ingaevones, dwelling\r\nnext the ocean; the Herminones, in the middle country; and all the rest,\r\nInstaevones. Some, borrowing a warrant from the darkness of antiquity,\r\nmaintain that the God had more sons, that thence came more denominations\r\nof people, the Marsians, Gambrians, Suevians, and Vandalians, and that\r\nthese are the names truly genuine and original. For the rest, they\r\naffirm Germany to be a recent word, lately bestowed: for that those\r\nwho first passed the Rhine and expulsed the Gauls, and are now named\r\nTungrians, were then called Germans: and thus by degrees the name of a\r\ntribe prevailed, not that of the nation; so that by an appellation at\r\nfirst occasioned by terror and conquest, they afterwards chose to be\r\ndistinguished, and assuming a name lately invented were universally\r\ncalled _Germans_.\r\n\r\nThey have a tradition that Hercules also had been in their country, and\r\nhim above all other heroes they extol in their songs when they advance\r\nto battle. Amongst them too are found that kind of verses by the recital\r\nof which (by them called _Barding_) they inspire bravery; nay, by such\r\nchanting itself they divine the success of the approaching fight. For,\r\naccording to the different din of the battle they urge furiously, or\r\nshrink timorously. Nor does what they utter, so much seem to be singing\r\nas the voice and exertion of valour. They chiefly study a tone fierce\r\nand harsh, with a broken and unequal murmur, and therefore apply their\r\nshields to their mouths, whence the voice may by rebounding swell with\r\ngreater fulness and force. Besides there are some of opinion, that\r\nUlysses, whilst he wandered about in his long and fabulous voyages, was\r\ncarried into this ocean and entered Germany, and that by him Asciburgium\r\nwas founded and named, a city at this day standing and inhabited upon\r\nthe bank of the Rhine: nay, that in the same place was formerly found an\r\naltar dedicated to Ulysses, with the name of his father Laertes added\r\nto his own, and that upon the confines of Germany and Rhoetia are still\r\nextant certain monuments and tombs inscribed with Greek characters.\r\nTraditions these which I mean not either to confirm with arguments of\r\nmy own or to refute. Let every one believe or deny the same according to\r\nhis own bent.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I concur in opinion with such as suppose the people of\r\nGermany never to have mingled by inter-marriages with other nations, but\r\nto have remained a people pure, and independent, and resembling none but\r\nthemselves. Hence amongst such a mighty multitude of men, the same make\r\nand form is found in all, eyes stern and blue, yellow hair, huge bodies,\r\nbut vigorous only in the first onset. Of pains and labour they are not\r\nequally patient, nor can they at all endure thrift and heat. To bear\r\nhunger and cold they are hardened by their climate and soil.\r\n\r\nTheir lands, however somewhat different in aspect, yet taken all\r\ntogether consist of gloomy forests or nasty marshes; lower and moister\r\ntowards Noricum and Pannonia; very apt to bear grain, but altogether\r\nunkindly to fruit trees; abounding in flocks and herds, but generally\r\nsmall of growth. Nor even in their oxen is found the usual stateliness,\r\nno more than the natural ornaments and grandeur of head. In the number\r\nof their herds they rejoice; and these are their only, these their most\r\ndesirable riches. Silver and gold the Gods have denied them, whether in\r\nmercy or in wrath, I am unable to determine. Yet I would not venture to\r\naver that in Germany no vein of gold or silver is produced; for who has\r\never searched? For the use and possession, it is certain they care not.\r\nAmongst them indeed are to be seen vessels of silver, such as have\r\nbeen presented to their Princes and Ambassadors, but holden in no other\r\nesteem than vessels made of earth. The Germans however adjoining to our\r\nfrontiers value gold and silver for the purposes of commerce, and are\r\nwont to distinguish and prefer certain of our coins. They who live more\r\nremote are more primitive and simple in their dealings, and exchange\r\none commodity for another. The money which they like is the old and\r\nlong known, that indented [with milled edges], or that impressed with\r\na chariot and two horses. Silver too is what they seek more than gold,\r\nfrom no fondness or preference, but because small pieces are more ready\r\nin purchasing things cheap and common.\r\n\r\nNeither in truth do they abound in iron, as from the fashion of their\r\nweapons may be gathered. Swords they rarely use, or the larger spear.\r\nThey carry javelins or, in their own language, _framms_, pointed with a\r\npiece of iron short and narrow, but so sharp and manageable, that with\r\nthe same weapon they can fight at a distance or hand to hand, just as\r\nneed requires. Nay, the horsemen also are content with a shield and a\r\njavelin. The foot throw likewise weapons missive, each particular\r\nis armed with many, and hurls them a mighty space, all naked or only\r\nwearing a light cassock. In their equipment they show no ostentation;\r\nonly that their shields are diversified and adorned with curious\r\ncolours. With coats of mail very few are furnished, and hardly upon any\r\nis seen a headpiece or helmet. Their horses are nowise signal either in\r\nfashion or in fleetness; nor taught to wheel and bound, according to the\r\npractice of the Romans: they only move them forward in a line, or turn\r\nthem right about, with such compactness and equality that no one is ever\r\nbehind the rest. To one who considers the whole it is manifest, that\r\nin their foot their principal strength lies, and therefore they fight\r\nintermixed with the motions and engagements of the cavalry. So that the\r\ninfantry are elected from amongst the most robust of their youth, and\r\nplaced in front of the army. The number to be sent is also ascertained,\r\nout of every village _an hundred_, and by this very name they continue\r\nto be called at home, _those of the hundred band_: thus what was at\r\nfirst no more than a number, becomes thenceforth a title and distinction\r\nof honour. In arraying their army, they divide the whole into distinct\r\nbattalions formed sharp in front. To recoil in battle, provided you\r\nreturn again to the attack, passes with them rather for policy than\r\nfear. Even when the combat is no more than doubtful, they bear away the\r\nbodies of their slain. The most glaring disgrace that can befall them,\r\nis to have quitted their shield; nor to one branded with such ignominy\r\nis it lawful to join in their sacrifices, or to enter into their\r\nassemblies; and many who had escaped in the day of battle, have hanged\r\nthemselves to put an end to this their infamy.\r\n\r\nIn the choice of kings they are determined by the splendour of their\r\nrace, in that of generals by their bravery. Neither is the power of\r\ntheir kings unbounded or arbitrary: and their generals procure obedience\r\nnot so much by the force of their authority as by that of their example,\r\nwhen they appear enterprising and brave, when they signalise themselves\r\nby courage and prowess; and if they surpass all in admiration and\r\npre-eminence, if they surpass all at the head of an army. But to none\r\nelse but the Priests is it allowed to exercise correction, or to inflict\r\nbonds or stripes. Nor when the Priests do this, is the same considered\r\nas a punishment, or arising from the orders of the general, but from the\r\nimmediate command of the Deity, Him whom they believe to accompany them\r\nin war. They therefore carry with them when going to fight, certain\r\nimages and figures taken out of their holy groves. What proves the\r\nprincipal incentive to their valour is, that it is not at random nor by\r\nthe fortuitous conflux of men that their troops and pointed battalions\r\nare formed, but by the conjunction of whole families, and tribes of\r\nrelations. Moreover, close to the field of battle are lodged all the\r\nnearest and most interesting pledges of nature. Hence they hear the\r\ndoleful howlings of their wives, hence the cries of their tender\r\ninfants. These are to each particular the witnesses whom he most\r\nreverences and dreads; these yield him the praise which affect him most.\r\nTheir wounds and maims they carry to their mothers, or to their wives,\r\nneither are their mothers or wives shocked in telling, or in sucking\r\ntheir bleeding sores. Nay, to their husbands and sons whilst engaged in\r\nbattle, they administer meat and encouragement.\r\n\r\nIn history we find, that some armies already yielding and ready to fly,\r\nhave been by women restored, through their inflexible importunity\r\nand entreaties, presenting their breasts, and showing their impending\r\ncaptivity; an evil to the Germans then by far most dreadful when it\r\nbefalls their women. So that the spirit of such cities as amongst\r\ntheir hostages are enjoined to send their damsels of quality, is always\r\nengaged more effectually than that of others. They even believe them\r\nendowed with something celestial and the spirit of prophecy. Neither\r\ndo they disdain to consult them, nor neglect the responses which they\r\nreturn. In the reign of the deified Vespasian, we have seen _Veleda_ for\r\na long time, and by many nations, esteemed and adored as a divinity. In\r\ntimes past they likewise worshipped _Aurinia_ and several more, from\r\nno complaisance or effort of flattery, nor as Deities of their own\r\ncreating.\r\n\r\nOf all the Gods, Mercury is he whom they worship most. To him on certain\r\nstated days it is lawful to offer even human victims. Hercules and Mars\r\nthey appease with beasts usually allowed for sacrifice. Some of the\r\nSuevians make likewise immolations to _Isis_. Concerning the cause and\r\noriginal of this foreign sacrifice I have found small light; unless\r\nthe figure of her image formed like a galley, show that such devotion\r\narrived from abroad. For the rest, from the grandeur and majesty of\r\nbeings celestial, they judge it altogether unsuitable to hold the Gods\r\nenclosed within walls, or to represent them under any human likeness.\r\nThey consecrate whole woods and groves, and by the names of the Gods\r\nthey call these recesses; divinities these, which only in contemplation\r\nand mental reverence they behold.\r\n\r\nTo the use of lots and auguries, they are addicted beyond all other\r\nnations. Their method of divining by lots is exceeding simple. From a\r\ntree which bears fruit they cut a twig, and divide it into two small\r\npieces. These they distinguish by so many several marks, and throw them\r\nat random and without order upon a white garment. Then the Priest of the\r\ncommunity, if for the public the lots are consulted, or the father of\r\na family if about a private concern, after he has solemnly invoked the\r\nGods, with eyes lifted up to heaven, takes up every piece thrice, and\r\nhaving done thus forms a judgment according to the marks before made. If\r\nthe chances have proved forbidding, they are no more consulted upon the\r\nsame affair during the same day; even when they are inviting, yet, for\r\nconfirmation, the faith of auguries too is tried. Yea, here also is the\r\nknown practice of divining events from the voices and flight of birds.\r\nBut to this nation it is peculiar, to learn presages and admonitions\r\ndivine from horses also. These are nourished by the State in the same\r\nsacred woods and grooves, all milk-white and employed in no earthly\r\nlabour. These yoked in the holy chariot, are accompanied by the Priest\r\nand the King, or the Chief of the community, who both carefully observed\r\nhis actions and neighing. Nor in any sort of augury is more faith and\r\nassurance reposed, not by the populace only, but even by the nobles,\r\neven by the Priests. These account themselves the ministers of the Gods,\r\nand the horses privy to his will. They have likewise another method of\r\ndivination, whence to learn the issue of great and mighty wars. From the\r\nnation with whom they are at war they contrive, it avails not how, to\r\ngain a captive: him they engage in combat with one selected from amongst\r\nthemselves, each armed after the manner of his country, and according\r\nas the victory falls to this or to the other, gather a presage of the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nAffairs of smaller moment the chiefs determine: about matters of\r\nhigher consequence the whole nation deliberates; yet in such sort,\r\nthat whatever depends upon the pleasure and decision of the people, is\r\nexamined and discussed by the chiefs. Where no accident or emergency\r\nintervenes, they assemble upon stated days, either, when the moon\r\nchanges, or is full: since they believe such seasons to be the most\r\nfortunate for beginning all transactions. Neither in reckoning of time\r\ndo they count, like us, the number of days but that of nights. In this\r\nstyle their ordinances are framed, in this style their diets appointed;\r\nand with them the night seems to lead and govern the day. From their\r\nextensive liberty this evil and default flows, that they meet not at\r\nonce, nor as men commanded and afraid to disobey; so that often the\r\nsecond day, nay often the third, is consumed through the slowness of the\r\nmembers in assembling. They sit down as they list, promiscuously, like a\r\ncrowd, and all armed. It is by the Priests that silence is enjoined,\r\nand with the power of correction the Priests are then invested. Then the\r\nKing or Chief is heard, as are others, each according to his precedence\r\nin age, or in nobility, or in warlike renown, or in eloquence; and the\r\ninfluence of every speaker proceeds rather from his ability to persuade\r\nthan from any authority to command. If the proposition displease, they\r\nreject it by an inarticulate murmur: if it be pleasing, they brandish\r\ntheir javelins. The most honourable manner of signifying their assent,\r\nis to express their applause by the sound of their arms.\r\n\r\nIn the assembly it is allowed to present accusations, and to prosecute\r\ncapital offences. Punishments vary according to the quality of the\r\ncrime. Traitors and deserters they hang upon trees. Cowards, and\r\nsluggards, and unnatural prostitutes they smother in mud and bogs under\r\nan heap of hurdles. Such diversity in their executions has this view,\r\nthat in punishing of glaring iniquities, it behooves likewise to\r\ndisplay them to sight; but effeminacy and pollution must be buried and\r\nconcealed. In lighter transgressions too the penalty is measured by\r\nthe fault, and the delinquents upon conviction are condemned to pay a\r\ncertain number of horses or cattle. Part of this mulct accrues to the\r\nKing or to the community, part to him whose wrongs are vindicated, or to\r\nhis next kindred. In the same assemblies are also chosen their chiefs\r\nor rulers, such as administer justice in their villages and boroughs.\r\nTo each of these are assigned an hundred persons chosen from amongst\r\nthe populace, to accompany and assist him, men who help him at once with\r\ntheir authority and their counsel.\r\n\r\nWithout being armed they transact nothing, whether of public or private\r\nconcernment. But it is repugnant to their custom for any man to use\r\narms, before the community has attested his capacity to wield them.\r\nUpon such testimonial, either one of the rulers, or his father, or\r\nsome kinsman dignify the young man in the midst of the assembly, with\r\na shield and javelin. This amongst them is the _manly robe_, this first\r\ndegree of honour conferred upon their youth. Before this they seem\r\nno more than part of a private family, but thenceforward part of the\r\nCommonweal. The princely dignity they confer even upon striplings, whose\r\nrace is eminently noble, or whose fathers have done great and signal\r\nservices to the State. For about the rest, who are more vigorous and\r\nlong since tried, they crowd to attend; nor is it any shame to be seen\r\namongst the followers of these. Nay, there are likewise degrees of\r\nfollowers, higher or lower, just as he whom they follow judges fit.\r\nMighty too is the emulation amongst these followers, of each to be first\r\nin favour with his Prince; mighty also the emulation of the Princes,\r\nto excel in the number and valour of followers. This is their principal\r\nstate, this their chief force, to be at all times surrounded with a huge\r\nband of chosen young men, for ornament and glory in peace, for security\r\nand defence in war. Nor is it amongst his own people only, but even from\r\nthe neighbouring communities, that any of their Princes reaps so\r\nmuch renown and a name so great, when he surpasses in the number and\r\nmagnanimity of his followers. For such are courted by Embassies, and\r\ndistinguished with presents, and by the terror of their fame alone often\r\ndissipate wars.\r\n\r\nIn the day of battle, it is scandalous to the Prince to be surpassed in\r\nfeats of bravery, scandalous to his followers to fail in matching the\r\nbravery of the Prince. But it is infamy during life, and indelible\r\nreproach, to return alive from a battle where their Prince was slain.\r\nTo preserve their Prince, to defend him, and to ascribe to his glory all\r\ntheir own valorous deeds, is the sum and most sacred part of their oath.\r\nThe Princes fight for victory; for the Prince his followers fight. Many\r\nof the young nobility, when their own community comes to languish in\r\nits vigour by long peace and inactivity, betake themselves through\r\nimpatience in other States which then prove to be in war. For,\r\nbesides that this people cannot brook repose, besides that by perilous\r\nadventures they more quickly blazon their fame, they cannot otherwise\r\nthan by violence and war support their huge train of retainers. For from\r\nthe liberality of their Prince, they demand and enjoy that _war-horse_\r\nof theirs, with that _victorious javelin_ dyed in the blood of their\r\nenemies. In the place of pay, they are supplied with a daily table and\r\nrepasts; though grossly prepared, yet very profuse. For maintaining such\r\nliberality and munificence, a fund is furnished by continual wars and\r\nplunder. Nor could you so easily persuade them to cultivate the ground,\r\nor to await the return of the seasons and produce of the year, as\r\nto provoke the foe and to risk wounds and death: since stupid and\r\nspiritless they account it, to acquire by their sweat what they can gain\r\nby their blood.\r\n\r\nUpon any recess from war, they do not much attend the chase. Much more\r\nof their time they pass in indolence, resigned to sleep and repasts. All\r\nthe most brave, all the most warlike, apply to nothing at all; but to\r\ntheir wives, to the ancient men, and to even the most impotent domestic,\r\ntrust all the care of their house, and of their lands and possessions.\r\nThey themselves loiter. Such is the amazing diversity of their nature,\r\nthat in the same men is found so much delight in sloth, with so much\r\nenmity to tranquillity and repose. The communities are wont, of their\r\nown accord and man by man, to bestow upon their Princes a certain number\r\nof beasts, or a certain portion of grain; a contribution which passes\r\nindeed for a mark of reverence and honour, but serves also to supply\r\ntheir necessities. They chiefly rejoice in the gifts which come from the\r\nbordering countries, such as are sent not only by particulars but in the\r\nname of the State; curious horses, splendid armour, rich harness, with\r\ncollars of silver and gold. Now too they have learnt, what we have\r\ntaught them, to receive money.\r\n\r\nThat none of the several people in Germany live together in cities, is\r\nabundantly known; nay, that amongst them none of their dwellings are\r\nsuffered to be contiguous. They inhabit apart and distinct, just as a\r\nfountain, or a field, or a wood happened to invite them to settle. They\r\nraise their villages in opposite rows, but not in our manner with the\r\nhouses joined one to another. Every man has a vacant space quite round\r\nhis own, whether for security against accidents from fire, or that they\r\nwant the art of building. With them in truth, is unknown even the use of\r\nmortar and of tiles. In all their structures they employ materials\r\nquite gross and unhewn, void of fashion and comeliness. Some parts\r\nthey besmear with an earth so pure and resplendent, that it resembles\r\npainting and colours. They are likewise wont to scoop caves deep in the\r\nground, and over them to lay great heaps of dung. Thither they retire\r\nfor shelter in the winter, and thither convey their grain: for by such\r\nclose places they mollify the rigorous and excessive cold. Besides\r\nwhen at any time their enemy invades them, he can only ravage the\r\nopen country, but either knows not such recesses as are invisible and\r\nsubterraneous; or must suffer them to escape him, on this very account\r\nthat he is uncertain where to find them.\r\n\r\nFor their covering a mantle is what they all wear, fastened with a clasp\r\nor, for want of it, with a thorn. As far as this reaches not they\r\nare naked, and lie whole days before the fire. The most wealthy are\r\ndistinguished with a vest, not one large and flowing like those of\r\nSarmatians and Parthians, but girt close about them and expressing the\r\nproportion of every limb. They likewise wear the skins of savage beasts,\r\na dress which those bordering upon the Rhine use without any fondness or\r\ndelicacy, but about which such who live further in the country are more\r\ncurious, as void of all apparel introduced by commerce. They choose\r\ncertain wild beasts, and, having flayed them, diversify their hides with\r\nmany spots, as also with the skins of monsters from the deep, such as\r\nare engendered in the distant ocean and in seas unknown. Neither does\r\nthe dress of the women differ from that of the men, save that the\r\nwomen are orderly attired in linen embroidered with purple, and use no\r\nsleeves, so that all their arms are bare. The upper part of their breast\r\nis withal exposed.\r\n\r\nYet the laws of matrimony are severely observed there; for in the whole\r\nof their manners is aught more praiseworthy than this: for they are\r\nalmost the only Barbarians contented with one wife, excepting a very few\r\namongst them; men of dignity who marry divers wives, from no wantonness\r\nor lubricity, but courted for the lustre of their family into many\r\nalliances.\r\n\r\nTo the husband, the wife tenders no dowry; but the husband, to the wife.\r\nThe parents and relations attend and declare their approbation of the\r\npresents, not presents adapted to feminine pomp and delicacy, nor such\r\nas serve to deck the new married woman; but oxen and horse accoutred,\r\nand a shield, with a javelin and sword. By virtue of these gifts, she\r\nis espoused. She too on her part brings her husband some arms. This they\r\nesteem the highest tie, these the holy mysteries, and matrimonial Gods.\r\nThat the woman may not suppose herself free from the considerations of\r\nfortitude and fighting, or exempt from the casualties of war, the very\r\nfirst solemnities of her wedding serve to warn her, that she comes to\r\nher husband as a partner in his hazards and fatigues, that she is to\r\nsuffer alike with him, to adventure alike, during peace or during war.\r\nThis the oxen joined in the same yoke plainly indicate, this the horse\r\nready equipped, this the present of arms. 'Tis thus she must be content\r\nto live, thus to resign life. The arms which she then receives she must\r\npreserve inviolate, and to her sons restore the same, as presents worthy\r\nof them, such as their wives may again receive, and still resign to her\r\ngrandchildren.\r\n\r\nThey therefore live in a state of chastity well secured; corrupted by no\r\nseducing shows and public diversions, by no irritations from banqueting.\r\nOf learning and of any secret intercourse by letters, they are all\r\nequally ignorant, men and women. Amongst a people so numerous, adultery\r\nis exceeding rare; a crime instantly punished, and the punishment left\r\nto be inflicted by the husband. He, having cut off her hair, expells her\r\nfrom his house naked, in presence of her kindred, and pursues her with\r\nstripes throughout the village. For, to a woman who has prostituted her\r\nperson, no pardon is ever granted. However beautiful she may be, however\r\nyoung, however abounding in wealth, a husband she can never find. In\r\ntruth, nobody turns vices into mirth there, nor is the practice of\r\ncorrupting and of yielding to corruption, called the custom of the Age.\r\nBetter still do those communities, in which none but virgins marry, and\r\nwhere to a single marriage all their views and inclinations are at once\r\nconfined. Thus, as they have but one body and one life, they take\r\nbut one husband, that beyond him they may have no thought, no further\r\nwishes, nor love him only as their husband but as their marriage.\r\nTo restrain generation and the increase of children, is esteemed an\r\nabominable sin, as also to kill infants newly born. And more powerful\r\nwith them are good manners, than with other people are good laws.\r\n\r\nIn all their houses the children are reared naked and nasty; and thus\r\ngrow into those limbs, into that bulk, which with marvel we behold.\r\nThey are all nourished with the milk of their own mothers, and never\r\nsurrendered to handmaids and nurses. The lord you cannot discern from\r\nthe slave, by any superior delicacy in rearing. Amongst the same cattle\r\nthey promiscuously live, upon the same ground they without distinction\r\nlie, till at a proper age the free-born are parted from the rest, and\r\ntheir bravery recommend them to notice. Slow and late do the young men\r\ncome to the use of women, and thus very long preserve the vigour of\r\nyouth. Neither are the virgins hastened to wed. They must both have\r\nthe same sprightly youth, the like stature, and marry when equal and\r\nable-bodied. Thus the robustness of the parents is inherited by the\r\nchildren. Children are holden in the same estimation with their mother's\r\nbrother, as with their father. Some hold this tie of blood to be most\r\ninviolable and binding, and in receiving of hostages, such pledges are\r\nmost considered and claimed, as they who at once possess affections\r\nthe most unalienable, and the most diffuse interest in their family.\r\nTo every man, however, his own children are heirs and successors: wills\r\nthey make none: for want of children his next akin inherits; his own\r\nbrothers, those of his father, or those of his mother. To ancient men,\r\nthe more they abound in descendants, in relations and affinities, so\r\nmuch the more favour and reverence accrues. From being childless, no\r\nadvantage nor estimation is derived.\r\n\r\nAll the enmities of your house, whether of your father or of your\r\nkindred, you must necessarily adopt; as well as all their friendships.\r\nNeither are such enmities unappeasable and permanent: since even for\r\nso great a crime as homicide, compensation is made by a fixed number of\r\nsheep and cattle, and by it the whole family is pacified to content.\r\nA temper this, wholesome to the State; because to a free nation,\r\nanimosities and faction are always more menacing and perilous. In social\r\nfeasts, and deeds of hospitality, no nation upon earth was ever more\r\nliberal and abounding. To refuse admitting under your roof any man\r\nwhatsoever, is held wicked and inhuman. Every man receives every\r\ncomer, and treats him with repasts as large as his ability can possibly\r\nfurnish. When the whole stock is consumed, he who has treated so\r\nhospitably guides and accompanies his guest to the next house, though\r\nneither of them invited. Nor avails it, that they were not; they are\r\nthere received, with the same frankness and humanity. Between a\r\nstranger and an acquaintance, in dispensing the rules and benefits of\r\nhospitality, no difference is made. Upon your departure, if you ask\r\nanything, it is the custom to grant it; and with the same facility, they\r\nask of you. In gifts they delight, but neither claim merit from what\r\nthey give, nor own any obligation for what they receive. Their manner of\r\nentertaining their guests is familiar and kind.\r\n\r\nThe moment they rise from sleep, which they generally prolong till late\r\nin the day, they bathe, most frequently in warm water; as in a country\r\nwhere the winter is very long and severe. From bathing, they sit down to\r\nmeat; every man apart, upon a particular seat, and at a separate table.\r\nThey then proceed to their affairs, all in arms; as in arms, they\r\nno less frequently go to banquet. To continue drinking night and day\r\nwithout intermission, is a reproach to no man. Frequent then are their\r\nbroils, as usual amongst men intoxicated with liquor; and such broils\r\nrarely terminate in angry words, but for the most part in maimings and\r\nslaughter. Moreover in these their feasts, they generally deliberate\r\nabout reconciling parties at enmity, about forming affinities, choosing\r\nof Princes, and finally about peace and war. For they judge, that at no\r\nseason is the soul more open to thoughts that are artless and upright,\r\nor more fired with such as are great and bold. This people, of\r\nthemselves nowise subtile or politic, from the freedom of the place\r\nand occasion acquire still more frankness to disclose the most secret\r\nmotions and purposes of their hearts. When therefore the minds of all\r\nhave been once laid open and declared, on the day following the several\r\nsentiments are revised and canvassed; and to both conjectures of time,\r\ndue regard is had. They consult, when they know not how to dissemble;\r\nthey determine, when they cannot mistake.\r\n\r\nFor their drink, they draw a liquor from barley or other grain; and\r\nferment the same so as to make it resemble wine. Nay, they who dwell\r\nupon the bank of the Rhine deal in wine. Their food is very simple; wild\r\nfruit, fresh venison, or coagulated milk. They banish hunger without\r\nformality, without curious dressing and curious fare. In extinguishing\r\nthirst, they use not equal temperance. If you will but humour their\r\nexcess in drinking, and supply them with as much as they covet, it will\r\nbe no less easy to vanquish them by vices than by arms.\r\n\r\nOf public diversions they have but one sort, and in all their meetings\r\nthe same is still exhibited. Young men, such as make it their pastime,\r\nfling themselves naked and dance amongst sharp swords and the deadly\r\npoints of javelins. From habit they acquire their skill, and from their\r\nskill a graceful manner; yet from hence draw no gain or hire: though\r\nthis adventurous gaiety has its reward, namely, that of pleasing the\r\nspectators. What is marvellous, playing at dice is one of their most\r\nserious employments; and even sober, they are gamesters: nay, so\r\ndesperately do they venture upon the chance of winning or losing, that\r\nwhen their whole substance is played away, they stake their liberty and\r\ntheir persons upon one and the last throw. The loser goes calmly into\r\nvoluntary bondage. However younger he be, however stronger, he tamely\r\nsuffers himself to be bound and sold by the winner. Such is their\r\nperseverance in an evil course: they themselves call it honour.\r\n\r\nSlaves of this class, they exchange in commerce, to free themselves too\r\nfrom the shame of such a victory. Of their other slaves they make not\r\nsuch use as we do of ours, by distributing amongst them the several\r\noffices and employments of the family. Each of them has a dwelling of\r\nhis own, each a household to govern. His lord uses him like a tenant,\r\nand obliges him to pay a quantity of grain, or of cattle, or of cloth.\r\nThus far only the subserviency of the slave extends. All the other\r\nduties in a family, not the slaves, but the wives and children\r\ndischarge. To inflict stripes upon a slave, or to put him in chains, or\r\nto doom him to severe labour, are things rarely seen. To kill them they\r\nsometimes are wont, not through correction or government, but in heat\r\nand rage, as they would an enemy, save that no vengeance or penalty\r\nfollows. The freedmen very little surpass the slaves, rarely are of\r\nmoment in the house; in the community never, excepting only such nations\r\nwhere arbitrary dominion prevails. For there they bear higher sway\r\nthan the free-born, nay, higher than the nobles. In other countries the\r\ninferior condition of freedmen is a proof of public liberty.\r\n\r\nTo the practice of usury and of increasing money by interest, they are\r\nstrangers; and hence is found a better guard against it, than if it\r\nwere forbidden. They shift from land to land; and, still appropriating\r\na portion suitable to the number of hands for manuring, anon parcel out\r\nthe whole amongst particulars according to the condition and quality\r\nof each. As the plains are very spacious, the allotments are easily\r\nassigned. Every year they change, and cultivate a fresh soil; yet\r\nstill there is ground to spare. For they strive not to bestow labour\r\nproportionable to the fertility and compass of their lands, by planting\r\norchards, by enclosing meadows, by watering gardens. From the earth,\r\ncorn only is extracted. Hence they quarter not the year into so many\r\nseasons. Winter, Spring, and Summer, they understand; and for each\r\nhave proper appellations. Of the name and blessings of Autumn, they are\r\nequally ignorant.\r\n\r\nIn performing their funerals, they show no state or vainglory. This only\r\nis carefully observed, that with the corpses of their signal men certain\r\nwoods be burned. Upon the funeral pile they accumulate neither apparel\r\nnor perfumes. Into the fire, are always thrown the arms of the dead, and\r\nsometimes his horse. With sods of earth only the sepulchre is raised.\r\nThe pomp of tedious and elaborate monuments they contemn, as things\r\ngrievous to the deceased. Tears and wailings they soon dismiss: their\r\naffliction and woe they long retain. In women, it is reckoned becoming\r\nto bewail their loss; in men, to remember it. This is what in general\r\nwe have learned, in the original and customs of the whole people of\r\nGermany. I shall now deduce the institutions and usages of the several\r\npeople, as far as they vary one from another; as also an account of what\r\nnations from thence removed, to settle themselves in Gaul.\r\n\r\nThat the Gauls were in times past more puissant and formidable, is\r\nrelated by the Prince of authors, the deified Julius [Caesar]; and hence\r\nit is probable that they too have passed into Germany. For what a small\r\nobstacle must be a river, to restrain any nation, as each grew\r\nmore potent, from seizing or changing habitations; when as yet all\r\nhabitations were common, and not parted or appropriated by the founding\r\nand terror of Monarchies? The region therefore between the Hercynian\r\nForest and the rivers Moenus and Rhine, was occupied by the Helvetians;\r\nas was that beyond it by the Boians, both nations of Gaul. There still\r\nremains a place called _Boiemum_, which denotes the primitive name and\r\nantiquity of the country, although the inhabitants have been changed.\r\nBut whether the Araviscans are derived from the Osians, a nation\r\nof Germans passing into Pannonia, or the Osians from the Araviscans\r\nremoving from thence into Germany, is a matter undecided; since they\r\nboth still use the language, the same customs and the same laws. For, as\r\nof old they lived alike poor and alike free, equal proved the evils\r\nand advantages on each side the river, and common to both people. The\r\nTreverians and Nervians aspire passionately to the reputation of being\r\ndescended from the Germans; since by the glory of this original, they\r\nwould escape all imputation of resembling the Gauls in person and\r\neffeminacy. Such as dwell upon the bank of the Rhine, the Vangiones, the\r\nTribocians, and the Nemetes, are without doubt all Germans. The Ubians\r\nare ashamed of their original; though they have a particular honour to\r\nboast, that of having merited an establishment as a Roman Colony, and\r\nstill delight to be called _Agrippinensians_, after the name of their\r\nfounder: they indeed formerly came from beyond the Rhine, and, for the\r\nmany proofs of their fidelity, were settled upon the very bank of the\r\nriver; not to be there confined or guarded themselves, but to guard and\r\ndefend that boundary against the rest of the Germans.\r\n\r\nOf all these nations, the Batavians are the most signal in bravery. They\r\ninhabit not much territory upon the Rhine, but possess an island in it.\r\nThey were formerly part of the Cattans, and by means of feuds at home\r\nremoved to these dwellings; whence they might become a portion of the\r\nRoman Empire. With them this honour still remains, as also the memorials\r\nof their ancient association with us: for they are not under the\r\ncontempt of paying tribute, nor subject to be squeezed by the farmers of\r\nthe revenue. Free from all impositions and payments, and only set apart\r\nfor the purposes of fighting, they are reserved wholly for the wars,\r\nin the same manner as a magazine of weapons and armour. Under the same\r\ndegree of homage are the nation of the Mattiacians. For such is the\r\nmight and greatness of the Roman People, as to have carried the awe and\r\nesteem of their Empire beyond the Rhine and the ancient boundaries. Thus\r\nthe Mattiacians, living upon the opposite banks, enjoy a settlement and\r\nlimits of their own; yet in spirit and inclination are attached to\r\nus: in other things resembling the Batavians, save that as they still\r\nbreathe their original air, still possess their primitive soil, they are\r\nthence inspired with superior vigour and keenness. Amongst the people\r\nof Germany I would not reckon those who occupy the lands which are\r\nunder decimation, though they be such as dwell beyond the Rhine and the\r\nDanube. By several worthless and vagabond Gauls, and such as poverty\r\nrendered daring, that region was seized as one belonging to no certain\r\npossessor: afterwards it became a skirt of the Empire and part of a\r\nprovince, upon the enlargement of our bounds and the extending of our\r\ngarrisons and frontier.\r\n\r\nBeyond these are the Cattans, whose territories begin at the Hercynian\r\nForest, and consist not of such wide and marshy plains, as those of\r\nthe other communities contained within the vast compass of Germany; but\r\nproduce ranges of hills, such as run lofty and contiguous for a long\r\ntract, then by degrees sink and decay. Moreover the Hercynian Forest\r\nattends for a while its native Cattans, then suddenly forsakes them.\r\nThis people are distinguished with bodies more hardy and robust, compact\r\nlimbs, stern countenances, and greater vigour of spirit. For Germans,\r\nthey are men of much sense and address. They dignify chosen men, listen\r\nto such as are set over them, know how to preserve their post, to\r\ndiscern occasions, to rebate their own ardour and impatience; how\r\nto employ the day, how to entrench themselves by night. They account\r\nfortune amongst things slippery and uncertain, but bravery amongst such\r\nas are never-failing and secure; and, what is exceeding rare nor ever to\r\nbe learnt but by a wholesome course of discipline, in the conduct of\r\nthe general they repose more assurance than in the strength of the\r\narmy. Their whole forces consist of foot, who besides their arms carry\r\nlikewise instruments of iron and their provisions. You may see other\r\nGermans proceed equipped to battle, but the Cattans so as to conduct a\r\nwar. They rarely venture upon excursions or casual encounters. It is in\r\ntruth peculiar to cavalry, suddenly to conquer, or suddenly to fly. Such\r\nhaste and velocity rather resembles fear. Patience and deliberation are\r\nmore akin to intrepidity.\r\n\r\nMoreover a custom, practised indeed in other nations of Germany, yet\r\nvery rarely and confined only to particulars more daring than the rest,\r\nprevails amongst the Cattans by universal consent. As soon as they\r\narrive to maturity of years, they let their hair and beards continue to\r\ngrow, nor till they have slain an enemy do they ever lay aside this form\r\nof countenance by vow sacred to valour. Over the blood and spoil of a\r\nfoe they make bare their face. They allege, that they have now acquitted\r\nthemselves of the debt and duty contracted by their birth, and rendered\r\nthemselves worthy of their country, worthy of their parents. Upon the\r\nspiritless, cowardly and unwarlike, such deformity of visage still\r\nremains. All the most brave likewise wear an iron ring (a mark of great\r\ndishonour this in that nation) and retain it as a chain; till by killing\r\nan enemy they become released. Many of the Cattans delight always to\r\nbear this terrible aspect; and, when grown white through age, become\r\nawful and conspicuous by such marks, both to the enemy and their own\r\ncountrymen. By them in all engagements the first assault is made: of\r\nthem the front of the battle is always composed, as men who in their\r\nlooks are singular and tremendous. For even during peace they abate\r\nnothing in the grimness and horror of their countenance. They have no\r\nhouse to inhabit, no land to cultivate, nor any domestic charge or care.\r\nWith whomsoever they come to sojourn, by him they are maintained; always\r\nvery prodigal of the substance of others, always despising what is their\r\nown, till the feebleness of old age overtakes them, and renders them\r\nunequal to the efforts of such rigid bravery.\r\n\r\nNext to the Cattans, dwell the Usipians and Tencterians; upon the Rhine\r\nnow running in a channel uniform and certain, such as suffices for a\r\nboundary. The Tencterians, besides their wonted glory in war, surpass in\r\nthe service and discipline of their cavalry. Nor do the Cattans derive\r\nhigher applause from their foot, than the Tencterians from their horse.\r\nSuch was the order established by their forefathers, and what their\r\nposterity still pursue. From riding and exercising of horse, their\r\nchildren borrow their pastimes; in this exercise the young men find\r\nmatter for emulating one another, and in this the old men take pleasure\r\nto persevere. Horses are by the father bequeathed as part of his\r\nhousehold and family, horses are conveyed amongst the rights of\r\nsuccession, and as such the son receives them; but not the eldest son,\r\nlike other effects, by priority of birth, but he who continues to be\r\nsignal in boldness and superior in war.\r\n\r\nContiguous to the Tencterians formerly dwelt the Bructerians, in whose\r\nroom it is said the Chamavians and Angrivarians are now settled; they\r\nwho expulsed and almost extirpated the Bructerians, with the concurrence\r\nof the neighbouring nations: whether in detestation of their arrogance,\r\nor allured by the love of spoil, or through the special favour of the\r\nGods towards us Romans. They in truth even vouchsafed to gratify us with\r\nthe sight of the battle. In it there fell above sixty thousand souls,\r\nwithout a blow struck by the Romans; but, what is a circumstance\r\nstill more glorious, fell to furnish them with a spectacle of joy and\r\nrecreation. May the Gods continue and perpetuate amongst these nations,\r\nif not any love for us, yet by all means this their animosity and hate\r\ntowards each other: since whilst the destiny of the Empire thus urges\r\nit, fortune cannot more signally befriend us, than in sowing strife\r\namongst our foes.\r\n\r\nThe Angrivarians and Chamavians are enclosed behind, by the Dulgibinians\r\nand Chasuarians; and by other nations not so much noted: before the\r\nFrisians face them. The country of Frisia is divided into two; called\r\nthe greater and lesser, according to the measure of their strength. Both\r\nnations stretch along the Rhine, quite to the ocean; and surround\r\nvast lakes such as once have born Roman fleets. We have moreover even\r\nventured out from thence into the ocean, and upon its coasts common fame\r\nhas reported the pillars of Hercules to be still standing: whether it be\r\nthat Hercules ever visited these parts, or that to his renowned name we\r\nare wont to ascribe whatever is grand and glorious everywhere. Neither\r\ndid Drusus who made the attempt, want boldness to pursue it: but the\r\nroughness of the ocean withstood him, nor would suffer discoveries to\r\nbe made about itself, no more than about Hercules. Thenceforward the\r\nenterprise was dropped: nay, more pious and reverential it seemed, to\r\nbelieve the marvellous feats of the Gods than to know and to prove them.\r\n\r\nHitherto, I have been describing Germany towards the west. To the\r\nnorthward, it winds away with an immense compass. And first of all\r\noccurs the nation of the Chaucians; who though they begin immediately\r\nat the confines of the Frisians, and occupy part of the shore, extend\r\nso far as to border upon all the several people whom I have already\r\nrecounted; till at last, by a Circuit, they reach quite to the\r\nboundaries of the Cattans. A region so vast, the Chaucians do not only\r\npossess but fill; a people of all the Germans the most noble, such as\r\nwould rather maintain their grandeur by justice than violence. They live\r\nin repose, retired from broils abroad, void of avidity to possess more,\r\nfree from a spirit of domineering over others. They provoke no wars,\r\nthey ravage no countries, they pursue no plunder. Of their bravery and\r\npower, the chief evidence arises from hence, that, without wronging or\r\noppressing others, they are come to be superior to all. Yet they are all\r\nready to arm, and if an exigency require, armies are presently raised,\r\npowerful and abounding as they are in men and horses; and even when they\r\nare quiet and their weapons laid aside, their credit and name continue\r\nequally high.\r\n\r\nAlong the side of the Chaucians and Cattans dwell the Cheruscans; a\r\npeople who finding no enemy to rouse them, were enfeebled by a peace\r\nover lasting and uniform, but such as they failed not to nourish. A\r\nconduct which proved more pleasing than secure; since treacherous is\r\nthat repose which you enjoy amongst neighbours that are very powerful\r\nand very fond of rule and mastership. When recourse is once had to the\r\nsword, modesty and fair dealing will be vainly pleaded by the weaker;\r\nnames these which are always assumed by the stronger. Thus the\r\nCheruscans, they who formerly bore the character of _good and upright_,\r\nare now called _cowards and fools_; and the fortune of the Cattans\r\nwho subdued them, grew immediately to be wisdom. In the ruin of the\r\nCheruscans, the Fosians, also their neighbours, were involved; and in\r\ntheir calamities bore an equal share, though in their prosperity they\r\nhad been weaker and less considered.\r\n\r\nIn the same winding tract of Germany live the Cimbrians, close to the\r\nocean; a community now very small, but great in fame. Nay, of their\r\nancient renown, many and extensive are the traces and monuments still\r\nremaining; even their entrenchments upon either shore, so vast in\r\ncompass that from thence you may even now measure the greatness and\r\nnumerous bands of that people, and assent to the account of an army so\r\nmighty. It was on the six hundred and fortieth year of Rome, when of the\r\narms of the Cimbrians the first mention was made, during the Consulship\r\nof Caecilius Metellus and Papirius Carbo. If from that time we count to\r\nthe second Consulship of the Emperor Trajan, the interval comprehends\r\nnear two hundred and ten years; so long have we been conquering Germany.\r\nIn a course of time, so vast between these two periods, many have been\r\nthe blows and disasters suffered on each side. In truth neither from the\r\nSamnites, nor from the Carthaginians, nor from both Spains, nor from all\r\nthe nations of Gaul, have we received more frequent checks and alarms;\r\nnor even from the Parthians: for, more vigorous and invincible is the\r\nliberty of the Germans than the monarchy of the Arsacides. Indeed, what\r\nhas the power of the East to allege to our dishonour; but the fall of\r\nCrassus, that power which was itself overthrown and abased by Ventidius,\r\nwith the loss of the great King Pacorus bereft of his life? But by the\r\nGermans the Roman People have been bereft of five armies, all commanded\r\nby Consuls; by the Germans, the commanders of these armies, Carbo, and\r\nCassius, and Scaurus Aurelius, and Servilius Caepio, as also Marcus\r\nManlius, were all routed or taken: by the Germans even the Emperor\r\nAugustus was bereft of Varus and three legions. Nor without difficulty\r\nand loss of men were they defeated by Caius Marius in Italy, or by the\r\ndeified Julius in Gaul, or by Drusus or Tiberius or Germanicus in their\r\nnative territories. Soon after, the mighty menaces of Caligula against\r\nthem ended in mockery and derision. Thenceforward they continued quiet,\r\ntill taking advantage of our domestic division and civil wars, they\r\nstormed and seized the winter entrenchments of the legions, and aimed at\r\nthe dominion of Gaul; from whence they were once more expulsed, and in\r\nthe times preceding the present, we gained a triumph over them rather\r\nthan a victory.\r\n\r\nI must now proceed to speak of the Suevians, who are not, like the\r\nCattans and Tencterians, comprehended in a single people; but divided\r\ninto several nations all bearing distinct names, though in general they\r\nare entitled Suevians, and occupy the larger share of Germany. This\r\npeople are remarkable for a peculiar custom, that of twisting their hair\r\nand binding it up in a knot. It is thus the Suevians are distinguished\r\nfrom the other Germans, thus the free Suevians from their slaves. In\r\nother nations, whether from alliance of blood with the Suevians, or, as\r\nis usual from imitation, this practice is also found, yet rarely, and\r\nnever exceeds the years of youth. The Suevians, even when their hair is\r\nwhite through age, continue to raise it backwards in a manner stern and\r\nstaring; and often tie it upon the top of their head only. That of their\r\nPrinces, is more accurately disposed, and so far they study to appear\r\nagreeable and comely; but without any culpable intention. For by\r\nit, they mean not to make love or to incite it: they thus dress when\r\nproceeding to war, and deck their heads so as to add to their height and\r\nterror in the eyes of the enemy.\r\n\r\nOf all the Suevians, the Semnones recount themselves to be the most\r\nancient and most noble. The belief of their antiquity is confirmed\r\nby religious mysteries. At a stated time of the year, all the several\r\npeople descended from the same stock, assemble by their deputies in\r\na wood; consecrated by the idolatries of their forefathers, and by\r\nsuperstitious awe in times of old. There by publicly sacrificing a man,\r\nthey begin the horrible solemnity of their barbarous worship. To this\r\ngrove another sort of reverence is also paid. No one enters it otherwise\r\nthan bound with ligatures, thence professing his subordination and\r\nmeanness, and power of the Deity there. If he fall down, he is not\r\npermitted to rise or be raised, but grovels along upon the ground. And\r\nof all their superstition, this is the drift and tendency; that from\r\nthis place the nation drew their original, that here God, the supreme\r\nGovernor of the world, resides, and that all things else whatsoever\r\nare subject to him and bound to obey him. The potent condition of the\r\nSemnones has increased their influence and authority, as they inhabit an\r\nhundred towns; and from the largeness of their community it comes, that\r\nthey hold themselves for the head of the Suevians.\r\n\r\nWhat on the contrary ennobles the Langobards is the smallness of their\r\nnumber, for that they, who are surrounded with very many and very\r\npowerful nations, derive their security from no obsequiousness or\r\nplying; but from the dint of battle and adventurous deeds. There follow\r\nin order the Reudignians, and Aviones, and Angles, and Varinians, and\r\nEudoses, and Suardones and Nuithones; all defended by rivers or forests.\r\nNor in one of these nations does aught remarkable occur, only that they\r\nuniversally join in the worship of _Herthum_; that is to say, the Mother\r\nEarth. Her they believe to interpose in the affairs of men, and to visit\r\ncountries. In an island of the ocean stands the wood _Castum_: in it\r\nis a chariot dedicated to the Goddess covered over with a curtain, and\r\npermitted to be touched by none but the Priest. Whenever the Goddess\r\nenters this her holy vehicle, he perceives her; and with profound\r\nveneration attends the motion of the chariot, which is always drawn by\r\nyoked cows. Then it is that days of rejoicing always ensue, and in all\r\nplaces whatsoever which she descends to honour with a visit and her\r\ncompany, feasts and recreation abound. They go not to war; they touch\r\nno arms; fast laid up is every hostile weapon; peace and repose are\r\nthen only known, then only beloved, till to the temple the same priest\r\nreconducts the Goddess when well tired with the conversation of mortal\r\nbeings. Anon the chariot is washed and purified in a secret lake, as\r\nalso the curtain; nay, the Deity herself too, if you choose to believe\r\nit. In this office it is slaves who minister, and they are forthwith\r\ndoomed to be swallowed up in the same lake. Hence all men are possessed\r\nwith mysterious terror; as well as with a holy ignorance what that must\r\nbe, which none see but such as are immediately to perish. Moreover this\r\nquarter of the Suevians stretches to the middle of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe community next adjoining, is that of the Hermondurians; (that I may\r\nnow follow the course of the Danube, as a little before I did that of\r\nthe Rhine) a people this, faithful to the Romans. So that to them alone\r\nof all the Germans, commerce is permitted; not barely upon the bank of\r\nthe Rhine, but more extensively, and even in that glorious colony in the\r\nprovince of Rhoetia. They travel everywhere at their own discretion and\r\nwithout a guard; and when to other nations, we show no more than our\r\narms and encampments, to this people we throw open our houses and\r\ndwellings, as to men who have no longing to possess them. In the\r\nterritories of the Hermondurians rises the Elbe, a river very famous and\r\nformerly well known to us; at present we only hear it named.\r\n\r\nClose by the Hermondurians reside the Nariscans, and next to them the\r\nMarcomanians and Quadians. Amongst these the Marcomanians are most\r\nsignal in force and renown; nay, their habitation itself they acquired\r\nby their bravery, as from thence they formerly expulsed the Boians. Nor\r\ndo the Nariscans or Quadians degenerate in spirit. Now this is as it\r\nwere the frontier of Germany, as far as Germany is washed by the Danube.\r\nTo the times within our memory the Marcomanians and Quadians were\r\ngoverned by kings, who were natives of their own, descended from the\r\nnoble line of Maroboduus and Tudrus. At present they are even subject to\r\nsuch as are foreigners. But the whole strength and sway of their king\r\nis derived from the authority of the Romans. From our arms, they rarely\r\nreceive any aid; from our money very frequently.\r\n\r\nNor less powerful are the several people beyond them; namely, the\r\nMarsignians, the Gothinians, the Osians and the Burians, who altogether\r\nenclose the Marcomanians and Quadians behind. Of those, the Marsignians\r\nand the Burians in speech and dress resemble the Suevians. From the\r\nGallic language spoken by the Gothinians, and from that of Pannonia by\r\nthe Osians, it is manifest that neither of these people are Germans; as\r\nit is also from their bearing to pay tribute. Upon them as upon aliens\r\ntheir tribute is imposed, partly by the Sarmatians, partly by the\r\nQuadians. The Gothinians, to heighten their disgrace, are forced to\r\nlabour in the iron mines. By all these several nations but little level\r\ncountry is possessed: they are seated amongst forests, and upon\r\nthe ridges and declivities of mountains. For, Suevia is parted by a\r\ncontinual ridge of mountains; beyond which, live many distinct nations.\r\nOf these the Lygians are most numerous and extensive, and spread into\r\nseveral communities. It will suffice to mention the most puissant; even\r\nthe Arians, Helvicones, Manimians; Elysians and Naharvalians. Amongst\r\nthe Naharvalians is shown a grove, sacred to devotion extremely ancient.\r\nOver it a Priest presides apparelled like a woman; but according to\r\nthe explication of the Romans, 'tis _Castor_ and _Pollux_ who are here\r\nworshipped. This Divinity is named _Alcis_. There are indeed no images\r\nhere, no traces of an extraneous superstition; yet their devotion is\r\naddressed to young men and to brothers. Now the Arians, besides their\r\nforces, in which they surpass the several nations just recounted, are\r\nin their persons stern and truculent; and even humour and improve their\r\nnatural grimness and ferocity by art and time. They wear black shields,\r\ntheir bodies are painted black, they choose dark nights for engaging in\r\nbattle; and by the very awe and ghastly hue of their army, strike the\r\nenemy with dread, as none can bear this their aspect so surprising and\r\nas it were quite infernal. For, in all battles the eyes are vanquished\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Lygians dwell the Gothones, under the rule of a King; and\r\nthence held in subjection somewhat stricter than the other German\r\nnations, yet not so strict as to extinguish all their liberty.\r\nImmediately adjoining are the Rugians and Lemovians upon the coast of\r\nthe ocean, and of these several nations the characteristics are a round\r\nshield, a short sword and kingly government. Next occur the communities\r\nof the Suiones, situated in the ocean itself; and besides their strength\r\nin men and arms, very powerful at sea. The form of their vessels varies\r\nthus far from ours, that they have prows at each end, so as to be always\r\nready to row to shore without turning nor are they moved by sails, nor\r\non their sides have benches of oars placed, but the rowers ply here and\r\nthere in all parts of the ship alike, as in some rivers is done, and\r\nchange their oars from place to place, just as they shift their course\r\nhither or thither. To wealth also, amongst them, great veneration is\r\npaid, and thence a single ruler governs them, without all restriction of\r\npower, and exacting unlimited obedience. Neither here, as amongst other\r\nnations of Germany, are arms used indifferently by all, but shut up and\r\nwarded under the care of a particular keeper, who in truth too is always\r\na slave: since from all sudden invasions and attacks from their foes,\r\nthe ocean protects them: besides that armed bands, when they are not\r\nemployed, grow easily debauched and tumultuous. The truth is, it suits\r\nnot the interest of an arbitrary Prince, to trust the care and power of\r\narms either with a nobleman or with a freeman, or indeed with any man\r\nabove the condition of a slave.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Suiones is another sea, one very heavy and almost void\r\nof agitation; and by it the whole globe is thought to be bounded and\r\nenvironed, for that the reflection of the sun, after his setting,\r\ncontinues till his rising, so bright as to darken the stars. To this,\r\npopular opinion has added, that the tumult also of his emerging from\r\nthe sea is heard, that forms divine are then seen, as likewise the rays\r\nabout his head. Only thus far extend the limits of nature, if what fame\r\nsays be true. Upon the right of the Suevian Sea the AEstyan nations\r\nreside, who use the same customs and attire with the Suevians; their\r\nlanguage more resembles that of Britain. They worship the Mother of the\r\nGods. As the characteristic of their national superstition, they wear\r\nthe images of wild boars. This alone serves them for arms, this is the\r\nsafeguard of all, and by this every worshipper of the goddess is secured\r\neven amidst his foes. Rare amongst them is the use of weapons of iron,\r\nbut frequent that of clubs. In producing of grain and the other fruits\r\nof the earth, they labour with more assiduity and patience than is\r\nsuitable to the usual laziness of Germans. Nay, they even search the\r\ndeep, and of all the rest are the only people who gather _amber_. They\r\ncall it _glasing_, and find it amongst the shallows and upon the very\r\nshore. But, according to the ordinary incuriosity and ignorance of\r\nBarbarians, they have neither learnt, nor do they inquire, what is\r\nits nature, or from what cause it is produced. In truth it lay long\r\nneglected amongst the other gross discharges of the sea; till from our\r\nluxury, it gained a name and value. To themselves it is of no use: they\r\ngather it rough, they expose it in pieces coarse and unpolished, and for\r\nit receive a price with wonder. You would however conceive it to be a\r\nliquor issuing from trees, for that in the transparent substance are\r\noften seen birds and other animals, such as at first stuck in the soft\r\ngum, and by it, as it hardened, became quite enclosed. I am apt to\r\nbelieve that, as in the recesses of the East are found woods and groves\r\ndropping frankincense and balms, so in the isles and continent of the\r\nWest such gums are extracted by the force and proximity of the sun; at\r\nfirst liquid and flowing into the next sea, then thrown by the winds\r\nand waves upon the opposite shore. If you try the nature of amber by\r\nthe application of fire, it kindles like a torch; and feeds a thick and\r\nunctuous flame very high scented, and presently becomes glutinous like\r\npitch or rosin.\r\n\r\nUpon the Suiones, border the people Sitones; and, agreeing with them in\r\nall other things, differ from them in one, that here the sovereignty is\r\nexercised by a woman. So notoriously do they degenerate not only from\r\na state of liberty, but even below a state of bondage. Here end the\r\nterritories of the Suevians.\r\n\r\nWhether amongst the Sarmatians or the Germans I ought to account the\r\nPeucinians, the Venedians, and the Fennians, is what I cannot determine;\r\nthough the Peucinians, whom some call Basstarnians, speak the same\r\nlanguage with the Germans, use the same attire, build like them, and\r\nlive like them, in that dirtiness and sloth so common to all.\r\nSomewhat they are corrupted into the fashion of the Sarmatians by the\r\ninter-marriages of the principal sort with that nation: from whence\r\nthe Venedians have derived very many of their customs and a great\r\nresemblance. For they are continually traversing and infesting with\r\nrobberies all the forests and mountains lying between the Peucinians\r\nand Fennians. Yet they are rather reckoned amongst the Germans, for\r\nthat they have fixed houses, and carry shields, and prefer travelling\r\non foot, and excel in swiftness. Usages these, all widely differing from\r\nthose of the Sarmatians, who live on horseback and dwell in waggons.\r\nIn wonderful savageness live the nation of the Fennians, and in beastly\r\npoverty, destitute of arms, of horses, and of homes; their food, the\r\ncommon herbs; their apparel, skins; their bed, the earth; their only\r\nhope in their arrows, which for want of iron they point with bones.\r\nTheir common support they have from the chase, women as well as men;\r\nfor with these the former wander up and down, and crave a portion of\r\nthe prey. Nor other shelter have they even for their babes, against the\r\nviolence of tempests and ravening beasts, than to cover them with the\r\nbranches of trees twisted together; this a reception for the old men,\r\nand hither resort the young. Such a condition they judge more happy than\r\nthe painful occupation of cultivating the ground, than the labour of\r\nrearing houses, than the agitations of hope and fear attending the\r\ndefence of their own property or the seizing that of others. Secure\r\nagainst the designs of men, secure against the malignity of the Gods,\r\nthey have accomplished a thing of infinite difficulty; that to them\r\nnothing remains even to be wished.\r\n\r\nWhat further accounts we have are fabulous: as that the Hellusians and\r\nOxiones have the countenances and aspect of men, with the bodies and\r\nlimbs of savage beasts. This, as a thing about which I have no certain\r\ninformation, I shall leave untouched.",
