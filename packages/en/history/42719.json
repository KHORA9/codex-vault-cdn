Mr.\r\nJackson, the engraver, paymaster, and proprietor, conceived that he had\r\na right to do what he liked with his own; while Mr. Chatto, his literary\r\ncoadjutor, very naturally felt that he was entitled to some recognition\r\non the title-page of what he had so successfully performed. On the book\r\nmaking its appearance without Mr. Chatto’s name on the title-page, and\r\nwith certain suppressions in his preface to which he had not given\r\nconsent, a virulent controversy ensued, which was embodied in a pamphlet\r\ntermed “a third preface,” and afterwards carried on in the _Athenæum_ of\r\nAugust and September, 1839. As this preface has nothing in it but the\r\noutpourings of a quarrel which can now interest no one, I do not\r\nrepublish any part of it; and looking back on the controversy after the\r\nlapse of twenty years, I cannot help feeling that Mr. Chatto had\r\nreasonable ground for complaining that his name was omitted, although I\r\nthink Mr. Jackson had full right to determine what the book should be\r\ncalled, seeing that it was his own exclusive speculation. It is not for\r\nme to change a title now so firmly established, but I will do Mr. Chatto\r\nthe civility to introduce his name on it, without concerning myself with\r\nthe question of what he did or did not do, or what Mr. Jackson\r\ncontributed beyond his practical remarks and anxious superintendence.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have the pleasure of a personal acquaintance with Mr. Chatto,\r\nand communicated to him my intention of republishing the work,\r\nI declined letting him see it through the press; resolving to stand\r\nwholly responsible for any alterations or improvements I might choose to\r\nmake. On the other hand, I have been quite as chary of letting even the\r\nshade of Mr. Jackson raise a new commotion--I say the shade, because,\r\nhaving his own copy full of manuscript remarks, it was at my option to\r\nuse them; but I have adopted nothing from this source save a few\r\npalpable amendments. What additions have been made are entirely my own,\r\nand have arisen from a desire to increase the number of illustrations\r\nwhere I thought them previously deficient and had the means of supplying\r\nthem. With the insertion of these additional illustrations, which it\r\nappears amount to seventy-five, it became necessary to describe them,\r\nand this has occasioned the introduction of perhaps a hundred or two\r\nlines, which are distributed in the form of notes or paragraphs\r\nthroughout the volume. For the chief of these additions the critical\r\nexaminer is referred to the following pages: 321, 322, 340, 352, 374,\r\n428, 468, 477, 480, 493, 530, 531, 532, 539, 540, 541, 542, 543, 545,\r\n546, 547, 548, 617, 639. The chapter on the artists of the present day\r\nis entirely new, and was not contemplated, as may be gathered from the\r\nremarks at pages 549 and 597, until the book was on the eve of\r\npublication. It contains upwards of seventy high class wood engravings,\r\nand gives a fair specimen of the talents of some of our most\r\ndistinguished artists. Getting that supplementary matter together and\r\ninto shape, was not so light and sudden a task as I meant it to be; but\r\nnow it is done I feel that it was right to do it, and I can only hope\r\nthat my unpretending labours will be deemed a step in the right\r\ndirection. Should I retain my health, strength, and means, I purpose, at\r\nno very distant period, to follow up the present volume with one perhaps\r\nas large, giving a more complete series of Examples of the artists of\r\nthe day, as well those of France and Germany as of England.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I think it due to Mr. Clay to acknowledge the attention\r\nand skill which he has exercised in “bringing up” the numerous and\r\nsomewhat difficult cuts to the agreeable face they now present. A good\r\nengraving without good printing is like a diamond without its polish.\r\n\r\n  HENRY G. BOHN.\r\n\r\n  _January 4th, 1861._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. JACKSON’S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel it my duty to submit to the public a few remarks, introductory to\r\nthe Preface, which bears the signature of Mr. Chatto.\r\n\r\nAs my attention has been more readily directed to matters connected with\r\nmy own profession than any other, it is not surprising that I should\r\nfind almost a total absence of practical knowledge in all English\r\nauthors who have written the early history of wood engraving. From the\r\nfirst occasion on which my attention was directed to the subject, to the\r\npresent time, I have had frequent occasion to regret, that the early\r\nhistory and practice of the art were not to be found in any book in the\r\nEnglish language. In the most expensive works of this description the\r\nprocess itself is not even correctly described, so that the\r\nreader--supposing him to be unacquainted with the subject--is obliged to\r\nfollow the author in comparative darkness. It has not been without\r\nreason I have come to the conclusion, that, if the _practice_, as well\r\nas the _history_ of wood engraving, were _better understood_, we should\r\nnot have so many speculative opinions put forth by almost all writers on\r\nthe subject, taking on trust what has been previously written, without\r\ngiving themselves the trouble to examine and form an opinion of their\r\nown. Both with a view to amuse and improve myself as a wood engraver,\r\nI had long been in the habit of studying such productions of the old\r\nmasters as came within my reach, and could not help noting the simple\r\nmistakes that many authors made in consequence of their knowing nothing\r\nof the practice. The farther I prosecuted the inquiry, the more\r\ninteresting it became; every additional piece of information\r\nstrengthening my first opinion, that, “if the _practice_, as well as the\r\n_history_ of wood engraving, were _better understood_,” we should not\r\nhave so many erroneous statements respecting both the history and\r\ncapabilities of the art. At length, I determined upon engraving at my\r\nleisure hours a fac-simile of anything I thought worth preserving. For\r\nsome time I continued to pursue this course, reading such English\r\nauthors as have written on the origin and early history of wood\r\nengraving, and making memoranda, without proposing to myself any\r\nparticular plan. It was not until I had proceeded thus far that I\r\nstopped to consider whether the information I had gleaned could not be\r\napplied to some specific purpose. My plan, at this time, was to give a\r\nshort introductory history to precede the practice of the art, which I\r\nproposed should form the principal feature in the Work. At this period,\r\nI was fortunate in procuring the able assistance of Mr. W. A. Chatto,\r\nwith whom I have examined every work that called for the exercise of\r\npractical knowledge. This naturally anticipated much that had been\r\nreserved for the practice, and has, in some degree, extended the\r\nhistorical portion beyond what I had originally contemplated; although,\r\nI trust, the reader will have no occasion to regret such a deviation\r\nfrom the original plan, or that it has not been _written_ by myself. The\r\nnumber and variety of the subjects it has been found necessary to\r\nintroduce, rendered it a task of some difficulty to preserve the\r\ncharacteristics of each individual master, varying as they do in the\r\nstyle of execution. It only remains for me to add, that, although I had\r\nthe hardihood to venture upon such an undertaking, it was not without a\r\nhope that the history of the art, with an account of the practice,\r\nillustrated with numerous wood engravings, would be looked upon with\r\nindulgence from one who only professed to give a fac-simile of whatever\r\nappeared worthy of notice, with opinions founded on a practical\r\nknowledge of the art.\r\n\r\n  JOHN JACKSON.\r\n\r\n  LONDON, _December 15th, 1838_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. CHATTO’S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough several English authors have, in modern times, written on the\r\norigin and early history of wood engraving, yet no one has hitherto\r\ngiven, in a distinct work, a connected account of its progress from the\r\nearliest period to the present time; and no one, however confidently he\r\nmay have expressed his opinion on the subject, appears to have thought\r\nit necessary to make himself acquainted with the practice of the art.\r\nThe antiquity and early history of wood engraving appear to have been\r\nconsidered as themes which allowed of great scope for speculation, and\r\nrequired no practical knowledge of the art. It is from this cause that\r\nwe find so many erroneous statements in almost every modern dissertation\r\non wood engraving. Had the writers ever thought of appealing to a person\r\npractically acquainted with the art, whose early productions they\r\nprofessed to give some account of, their conjectures might, in many\r\ninstances, have been spared; and had they, in matters requiring\r\nresearch, taken the pains to examine and judge for themselves, instead\r\nof adopting the opinions of others, they would have discovered that a\r\nconsiderable portion of what they thus took on trust, was not in\r\naccordance with facts.\r\n\r\nAs the antiquity and early history of wood engraving form a considerable\r\nportion of two expensive works which profess to give some account of the\r\nart, it has been thought that such a work as the present, combining the\r\nhistory with the practice of the art, and with numerous cuts\r\nillustrative of its progress, decline, and revival, might not be\r\nunfavourably received.\r\n\r\nIn the first chapter an attempt is made to trace the principle of wood\r\nengraving from the earliest authentic period; and to prove, by a\r\ncontinuous series of facts, that the art, when first applied to the\r\nimpression of pictorial subjects on paper, about the beginning of the\r\nfifteenth century, was not so much an original invention, as the\r\nextension of a principle which had long been known and practically\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nThe second chapter contains an account of the progress of the art as\r\nexemplified in the earliest known single cuts, and in the block-books\r\nwhich preceded the invention of typography. In this chapter there is\r\nalso an account of the Speculum Salvationis, which has been ascribed to\r\nLaurence Coster by Hadrian Junius, Scriverius, Meerman, and others, and\r\nwhich has frequently been described as an early block-book executed\r\nprevious to 1440. A close examination of two Latin editions of the book\r\nhas, however, convinced me, that in the earliest the text is entirely\r\nprinted from movable types, and that in the other--supposed by Meerman\r\nto be the earliest, and to afford proofs of the progress of Coster’s\r\ninvention--those portions of the text which are printed from wood-blocks\r\nhave been copied from the corresponding portions of the earlier edition\r\nwith the text printed entirely from movable types. Fournier was the\r\nfirst who discovered that one of the Latin editions was printed partly\r\nfrom types, and partly from wood-blocks; and the credit of showing, from\r\ncertain imperfections in the cuts, that this edition was subsequent to\r\nthe other with the text printed entirely from types, is due to the late\r\nMr. Ottley.\r\n\r\nAs typography, or printing from movable types, was unquestionably\r\nsuggested by the earliest block-books with the text engraved on wood,\r\nthe third chapter is devoted to an examination of the claims of\r\nGutemberg and Coster to the honour of this invention. In the\r\ninvestigation of the evidence which has been produced in the behalf of\r\neach, the writer has endeavoured to divest his mind of all bias, and to\r\ndecide according to facts, without reference to the opinions of either\r\nparty. He has had no theory to support; and has neither a partiality for\r\nMentz, nor a dislike to Harlem. It perhaps may not be unnecessary to\r\nmention here, that the cuts of arms from the History of the Virgin,\r\ngiven at pages 75, 76, and 77, were engraved before the writer had seen\r\nKoning’s work on the Invention of Printing, Harlem, 1816, where they are\r\nalso copied, and several of them assigned to Hannau, Burgundy, Brabant,\r\nUtrecht, and Leyden, and to certain Flemish noblemen, whose names are\r\nnot mentioned. It is not improbable that, like the two rash Knights in\r\nthe fable, we may have seen the shields on opposite sides;--the bearings\r\nmay be common to states and families, both of Germany and the\r\nNetherlands.\r\n\r\nThe fourth chapter contains an account of wood engraving in connexion\r\nwith the press, from the establishment of typography to the latter end\r\nof the fifteenth century. The fifth chapter comprehends the period in\r\nwhich Albert Durer flourished,--that is, from about 1498 to 1528. The\r\nsixth contains a notice of the principal wood-cuts designed by Holbein,\r\nwith an account of the extension and improvement of the art in the\r\nsixteenth century, and of its subsequent decline. In the seventh chapter\r\nthe history of the art is brought down from the commencement of the\r\neighteenth century to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe eighth chapter contains an account of the practice of the art, with\r\nremarks on metallic relief engraving, and the best mode of printing\r\nwood-cuts. As no detailed account of the practice of wood engraving has\r\nhitherto been published in England, it is presumed that the information\r\nafforded by this part of the Work will not only be interesting to\r\namateurs of the art, but useful to those who are professionally\r\nconnected with it.\r\n\r\nIt is but justice to Mr. Jackson to add, that the Work was commenced by\r\nhim at his sole risk; that most of the subjects are of his selection;\r\nand that nearly all of them were engraved, and that a great part of the\r\nWork was written, before he thought of applying to a publisher. The\r\ncredit of commencing the Work, and of illustrating it so profusely,\r\nregardless of expense, is unquestionably due to him.\r\n\r\n  W. A.

The French synonym of\r\nthe English verb “to engrave,” is “graver;” and its root is to be found\r\nin the Greek γράφω (_grapho_, I cut), which, with its compound ἐπιγράφω,\r\naccording to Martorelli, as cited by Von Murr,[I-1] is always used by\r\nHomer to express cutting, incision, or wounding; but never to express\r\nwriting by the superficial tracing of characters with a reed or pen.\r\nFrom the circumstance of laws, in the early ages of Grecian history,\r\nbeing cut or engraved on wood, the word γράφω came to be used in the\r\nsense of, “I sanction, or I pass a law;” and when, in the progress of\r\nsociety and the improvement of art, letters, instead of being cut on\r\nwood, were indented by means of a skewer-shaped instrument (stylus) on\r\nwax spread on tablets of wood or ivory, or written by means of a pen or\r\nreed on papyrus or on parchment, the word γράφω, which in its primitive\r\nmeaning signified “to cut,” became expressive of writing generally.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-1: C. G. Von Murr, in his Journal zur Kunstgeschichte,\r\n    2 Theil, S. 253, referring to Martorelli, De Regia Theca\r\n    Calamaria.]\r\n\r\nFrom γράφω is derived the Latin _scribo_,[I-2] “I write;” and it is\r\nworthy of observation, that “_to scrive_,”--most probably from\r\n_scribo_,--signifies, in our own language, to cut numerals or other\r\ncharacters on timber with a tool called a _scrive_: the word thus\r\npassing, as it were, through a circle of various meanings and in\r\ndifferent languages, and at last returning to its original\r\nsignification.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-2: If this etymology be correct, the English Scrivener\r\n    and French _Greffier_ may be related by descent as well as\r\n    professionally; both words being thus referable to the same\r\n    origin, the Greek γράφω. The modern _Writer_ in the Scottish\r\n    courts of law performs the duties both of Scrivener and Greffier,\r\n    with whose name his own is synonymous.]\r\n\r\nUnder the general term SCULPTURE--the root of which is to be found in\r\nthe Latin verb _sculpo_, “I cut”--have been classed copper-plate\r\nengraving, wood engraving, gem engraving, and carving, as well as the\r\nart of the statuary or figure-cutter in marble, to which art the word\r\n_sculpture_ is now more strictly applied, each of those arts requiring\r\nin its process the act of _cutting_ of one kind or other. In the German\r\nlanguage, which seldom borrows its terms of art from other languages,\r\nthe various modes of cutting in sculpture, in copper-plate engraving,\r\nand in engraving on wood, are indicated in the name expressive of the\r\noperator or artist. The sculptor is named a _Bildhauer_, from _Bild_, a\r\nstatue, and _hauen_, to hew, indicating the operation of cutting with a\r\nmallet and chisel; the copper-plate engraver is called a\r\n_Kupfer-stecher_, from _Kupfer_, copper, and _stechen_, to dig or cut\r\nwith the point; and the wood engraver is a _Holzschneider_, from _Holz_,\r\nwood, and _schneiden_, to cut with the edge.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, that though both the copper-plate engraver and the\r\nwood engraver may be said to _cut_ in a certain sense, as well as the\r\nsculptor and the carver, they have to execute their work\r\n_reversed_,--that is, contrary to the manner in which impressions from\r\ntheir plates or blocks are seen; and that in copying a painting or a\r\ndrawing, it requires to be reversely transferred,--a disadvantage under\r\nwhich the sculptor and the carver do not labour, as they copy their\r\nmodels or subjects _direct_.\r\n\r\nENGRAVING, as the word is at the present time popularly used, and\r\nconsidered in its relation to the pictorial art, may be defined to\r\nbe--“The art of representing objects on metallic substances, or on wood,\r\nexpressed by lines and points produced by means of corrosion, incision,\r\nor excision, for the purpose of their being impressed on paper by means\r\nof ink or other colouring matter.”\r\n\r\nThe impressions obtained from engraved _plates_ of metal or from\r\n_blocks_ of wood are commonly called engravings, and sometimes prints.\r\nFormerly the word _cuts_[I-3] was applied indiscriminately to\r\nimpressions, either from metal or wood; but at present it is more\r\nstrictly confined to the productions of the wood engraver. Impressions\r\nfrom copper-plates only are properly called _plates_; though it is not\r\nunusual for persons who profess to review productions of art, to speak\r\nof a book containing, perhaps, a number of indifferent woodcuts, as\r\n“a work embellished with a profusion of the _most charming plates_ on\r\nwood;” thus affording to every one who is in the least acquainted with\r\nthe art at once a specimen of their taste and their knowledge.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-3: Towards the close of the seventeenth century we\r\n    find books “adorned with _sculptures_ by a curious hand;” about\r\n    1730 we find them “ornamented with _cuts_;” at present they are\r\n    “illustrated with _engravings_.”]\r\n\r\nIndependent of the difference of the material on which copper-plate\r\nengraving and wood engraving are executed, the grand distinction between\r\nthe two arts is, that the engraver on copper corrodes by means of\r\naqua-fortis, or cuts out with the burin or dry-point, the lines,\r\nstipplings, and hatchings from which his impression is to be produced;\r\nwhile, on the contrary, the wood engraver effects his purpose by cutting\r\naway those parts which are to appear white or colourless, thus leaving\r\nthe lines which produce the impression prominent.\r\n\r\nIn printing from a copper or steel plate, which is previously warmed by\r\nbeing placed above a charcoal fire, the ink or colouring matter is\r\nrubbed into the lines or incisions by means of a kind of ball formed of\r\nwoollen cloth; and when the lines are thus sufficiently charged with\r\nink, the surface of the plate is first wiped with a piece of rag, and is\r\nthen further cleaned and smoothed by the fleshy part of the palm of the\r\nhand, slightly touched with whitening, being once or twice passed rather\r\nquickly and lightly over it. The plate thus prepared is covered with the\r\npaper intended to receive the engraving, and is subjected to the action\r\nof the rolling or copper-plate printer’s press; and the impression is\r\nobtained by the paper being pressed _into_ the inked incisions.\r\n\r\nAs the lines of an engraved block of wood are prominent or in relief,\r\nwhile those of a copper-plate are, as has been previously explained,\r\n_intagliate_ or hollowed, the mode of taking an impression from the\r\nformer is precisely the reverse of that which has just been described.\r\nThe usual mode of taking impressions from an engraved block of wood is\r\nby means of the printing-press, either from the block separately, or\r\nwedged up in a _chase_ with types. The block is inked by being beat with\r\na roller on the surface, in the same manner as type; and the paper being\r\nturned over upon it from the _tympan_, it is then run in under the\r\n_platen_; which being acted on by the lever, presses the paper _on to_\r\nthe raised lines of the block, and thus produces the impression.\r\nImpressions from wood are thus obtained by the _on-pression_ of the\r\npaper against the raised or prominent lines; while impressions from\r\ncopper-plates are obtained by the _in-pression_ of the paper into\r\nhollowed ones. In consequence of this difference in the process, the\r\ninked lines impressed on paper from a copper-plate appear prominent when\r\nviewed direct; while the lines communicated from an engraved wood-block\r\nare indented in the front of the impression, and appear raised at the\r\nback.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PRINTED FROM A WOOD-BLOCK.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PRINTED FROM A COPPER-PLATE.]\r\n\r\nThe above impressions--the one from a wood-block, and the other from an\r\netched copper-plate--will perhaps render what has been already said,\r\nexplanatory of the difference between copper-plate printing from\r\nhollowed lines, and _surface printing_ by means of the common press from\r\nprominent lines, still more intelligible. The subject is a\r\nrepresentation of the copper-plate or rolling press.\r\n\r\nBoth the preceding impressions are produced in the same manner by means\r\nof the common printing-press. One is from wood; the other, where the\r\nwhite lines are seen on a black ground, is from copper;--the hollowed\r\nlines, which in copper-plate printing yield the impression, receiving no\r\nink from the printer’s balls or rollers; while the surface, which in\r\ncopper-plate printing is wiped clean after the lines are filled with\r\nink, is perfectly covered with it. It is, therefore, evident, that if\r\nthis etching were printed in the same manner as other copper-plates, the\r\nimpression would be a fac-simile of the one from wood. It has been\r\njudged necessary to be thus minute in explaining the difference between\r\ncopper-plate and wood engraving, as the difference in the mode of\r\nobtaining impressions does not appear to have been previously pointed\r\nout with sufficient precision.\r\n\r\nAs it does not come within the scope of the present work to inquire into\r\nthe origin of sculpture generally, I shall not here venture to give an\r\nopinion whether the art was invented by ADAM or his good angel RAZIEL,\r\nor whether it was introduced at a subsequent period by TUBAL-CAIN, NOAH,\r\nTRISMEGISTUS, ZOROASTER, or MOSES. Those who feel interested in such\r\nremote speculations will find the “authorities” in the second chapter of\r\nEvelyn’s “Sculptura.”\r\n\r\nWithout, therefore, inquiring when or by whom the art of engraving for\r\nthe purpose of producing impressions was invented, I shall endeavour to\r\nshow that such an art, however rude, was known at a very early period;\r\nand that it continued to be practised in Europe, though to a very\r\nlimited extent, from an age anterior to the birth of Christ, to the year\r\n1400. In the fifteenth century, its principles appear to have been more\r\ngenerally applied;--first, to the simple cutting of figures on wood for\r\nthe purpose of being impressed on paper; next, to cutting figures and\r\nexplanatory text on the same block, and then entire pages of text\r\nwithout figures, till the “ARS GRAPHICA ET IMPRESSORIA” attained its\r\nperfection in the discovery of PRINTING by means of movable fusile\r\ntypes.[I-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-4: Astle on the Origin and Progress of Writing,\r\n    p. 215, 2nd edit.]\r\n\r\nAt a very early period stamps of wood, having hieroglyphic characters\r\nengraved on them, were used in Egypt for the purpose of producing\r\nimpressions on bricks, and on other articles made of clay. This fact,\r\nwhich might have been inferred from the ancient bricks and fragments of\r\nearthenware containing characters evidently communicated by means of a\r\nstamp, has been established by the discovery of several of those wooden\r\nstamps, of undoubted antiquity, in the tombs at Thebes, Meroe, and other\r\nplaces. The following cuts represent the face and the back of one of the\r\nmost perfect of those stamps, which was found in a tomb at Thebes, and\r\nhas recently been brought to this country by Edward William Lane,\r\nEsq.[I-5]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-5: Author of “An Account of the Manners and Customs of\r\n    the Modern Egyptians, written in Egypt during the years 1833, ’34,\r\n    and ’35.”]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe original stamp is made of the same kind of wood as the mummy chests,\r\nand has an arched handle at the back, cut out of the same piece of wood\r\nas the face. It is of an oblong figure, with the ends rounded off; five\r\ninches long, two inches and a quarter broad, and half an inch thick. The\r\nhieroglyphic characters on its face are rudely cut in _intaglio_, so\r\nthat their impression on clay would be in relief; and if printed in the\r\nsame manner as the preceding copy, would present the same\r\nappearance,--that is, the characters which are cut into the wood, would\r\nappear white on a black ground. The phonetic power of the hieroglyphics\r\non the face of the stamp may be represented respectively by the\r\nletters, A, M, N, F, T, P, T, H, M; and the vowels being supplied, as in\r\nreading Hebrew without points, we have the words, “Amonophtep,\r\nThmei-mai,”--“Amonoph, beloved of truth.”[I-6] The name is supposed to\r\nbe that of Amonoph or Amenoph the First, the second king of the\r\neighteenth dynasty, who, according to the best authorities, was\r\ncontemporary with Moses, and reigned in Egypt previous to the departure\r\nof the Israelites. There are two ancient Egyptian bricks in the British\r\nMuseum on which the impression of a similar stamp is quite distinct; and\r\nthere are also several articles of burnt clay, of an elongated conical\r\nfigure, and about nine inches long, which have their broader extremities\r\nimpressed with hieroglyphics in a similar manner. There is also in the\r\nsame collection a wooden stamp, of a larger size than that belonging to\r\nMr. Lane, but not in so perfect a condition. Several ancient Etruscan\r\nterra-cottas and fragments of earthenware have been discovered, on which\r\nthere are alphabetic characters, evidently impressed from a stamp, which\r\nwas probably of wood. In the time of Pliny terra-cottas thus impressed\r\nwere called Typi.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-6: On a mummy in the royal collection at Paris, the\r\n    six first characters of this stamp occur. Champollion reads them,\r\n    “Amenoftep,” or “Amonaftep.” He supposes the name to be that of\r\n    Amonoph the First; and says that it signifies “approuvé par\r\n    Ammon.”--Précis du Système Hiéroglyphique. Planches et\r\n    Explication, p. 20, No. 161.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the British Museum are several bricks which have been found on the\r\nsite of ancient Babylon. They are larger than our bricks, and somewhat\r\ndifferent in form, being about twelve inches square and three inches\r\nthick. They appear to have been made of a kind of muddy clay with which\r\nportions of chopped straw have been mixed to cause it to bind; and their\r\ngeneral appearance and colour, which is like that of a common brick\r\nbefore it is burnt, plainly enough indicate that they have not been\r\nhardened by fire, but by exposure to the sun. About the middle of their\r\nbroadest surface, they are impressed with certain characters which have\r\nevidently been indented when the brick was in a soft state. The\r\ncharacters are indented,--that is, they are such as would be produced by\r\npressing a wood-block with raised lines upon a mass of soft clay; and\r\nwere such a block printed on paper in the usual manner of wood-cuts, the\r\nimpression would be similar to the preceding one, which has been copied,\r\non a reduced scale, from one of the bricks above noticed. The characters\r\nhave been variously described as cuneiform or wedge-shaped,\r\narrow-headed, javelin-headed, or nail-headed; but their meaning has not\r\nhitherto been deciphered.\r\n\r\nAmphoræ, lamps, tiles, and various domestic utensils, formed of clay,\r\nand of Roman workmanship, are found impressed with letters, which in\r\nsome cases are supposed to denote the potter’s name, and in others the\r\ncontents of the vessel, or the name of the owner. On the tiles,--of\r\nwhich there are specimens in the British Museum,--the letters are\r\ncommonly inscribed in a circle, and appear raised; thus showing that the\r\nstamp had been hollowed, or engraved in intaglio, in a manner similar to\r\na wooden butter-print. In a book entitled “Ælia Lælia Crispis non nata\r\nresurgens,” by C. C. Malvasia, 4to. Bologna, 1683, are several\r\nengravings on wood of such tiles, found in the neighbourhood of Rome,\r\nand communicated to the author by Fabretti, who, in the seventh chapter\r\nof his own work,[I-7] has given some account of the “figlinarum\r\nsigna,”--the stamps of the ancient potters and tile-makers.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-7: Inscriptionum Explicatio, fol. Romæ, 1699.]\r\n\r\nThe stamp from which the following cut has been copied is preserved in\r\nthe British Museum. It is of brass, and the letters are in relief and\r\nreversed; so that if it were inked from a printer’s ball and stamped on\r\npaper, an impression would be produced precisely the same as that which\r\nis here given.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  LAR]\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult now to ascertain why this stamp should be marked\r\nwith the word LAR, which signifies a household god, or the image of the\r\nsupposed tutelary genius of a house; but, without much stretch of\r\nimagination, we may easily conceive how appropriate such an inscription\r\nwould be impressed on an amphora or large wine-vessel, sealed and set\r\napart on the birth of an heir, and to be kept sacred--inviolate as the\r\nhousehold gods--till the young Roman assumed the “toga virilis,” or\r\narrived at years of maturity. That vessels containing wine were kept for\r\nmany years, we learn from Horace and Petronius;[I-8]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-8: “O nata mecum consule Manlio!” says Horace,\r\n    addressing an amphora of wine as old as himself; and Petronius\r\n    mentions some choice Falernian which had attained the ripe age of\r\n    a hundred: “Statim allatæ sunt amphoræ vitreæ diligenter gypsatæ,\r\n    quarum in cervicibus pittacia erant affixa, cum hoc titulo:\r\n    _Falernum Opimianum annorum centum_.” _Pittacia_ were small\r\n    labels--schedulæ breves--attached to the necks of wine-vessels,\r\n    and on which were marked the name and age of the wine.]\r\n\r\n    ----Prome reconditum,\r\n  Lyde, strenua, Cæcubum,\r\n    Munitæque adhibe vim sapientiæ.\r\n  Inclinare meridiem\r\n    Sentis: ac veluti stet volucris dies,\r\n  Parcis deripere horreo\r\n    Cessantem Bibuli Consulis amphoram.\r\n\r\n  _Carmin._ lib.

He adds: “Letters cut on wood they certainly had, and\r\nvery likely grotesques and figures also, the hint of which their artists\r\nmight readily obtain from the coloured stuffs which were frequently\r\npresented by Indian ambassadors to the emperors.”[I-9]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-9: Journal zur Kunstgeschichte, 2 Theil, S. 81.

Not\r\nbeing able to explain the letters on these stamps, further than that the\r\nfirst may be the dative case of a proper name Ovirillius, and indicate\r\nthat property so marked belonged to such a person, I leave them, as\r\nFrancis Moore, physician, leaves the hieroglyphic in his Almanack,--“to\r\ntime and the curious to construe.”\r\n\r\nLambinet, in his “Recherches sur l’Origine de l’Imprimerie,” gives an\r\naccount of two stone stamps of the form of small tablets, the letters of\r\nwhich were cut in _intaglio_ and reverse, similar to the two of which\r\nimpressions are above given. They were found in 1808, near the village\r\nof Nais, in the department of the Meuse; and as the letters, being in\r\nreverse, could not be made out, the owner of the tablets sent them to\r\nthe Celtic Society of Paris, where M. Dulaure, to whose examination they\r\nwere submitted, was of opinion that they were a kind of matrices or\r\nhollow stamps, intended to be applied to soft substances or such as were\r\nin a state of fusion. He thought they were stamps for vessels containing\r\nmedical compositions; and if his reading of one of the inscriptions be\r\ncorrect, the practice of stamping the name of a quack and the nature of\r\nhis remedy, in relief on the side of an ointment-pot or a bottle, is of\r\nhigh antiquity. The letters\r\n\r\n  Q. JUN. TAURI. ANODY.\r\n  NUM. AD OMN. LIPP.\r\n\r\nM. Dulaure explains thus: _Quinti Junii Tauridi anodynum ad omnes\r\nlippas_;[I-10] an inscription which is almost literally rendered by the\r\ntitle of a specific still known in the neighbourhood of\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne, “_Dr. Dud’s lotion, good for sore eyes_.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-10: M. Dulaure’s latinity is bad. “_Lippas_” certainly\r\n    is not the word. His translation is, “Remède anodin de Quintus\r\n    Junius Tauridus, pour _tous les maux_ d’yeux.” Other stone stamps,\r\n    supposed to have been used by oculists to mark the vessels\r\n    containing their medicaments, were discovered and explained long\r\n    before M. Dulaure published his interpretation. See “WALCHII\r\n    Antiquitates Medicæ Selectæ, Jenæ, 1772,” Num. 1 and 2, referred\r\n    to by Von Murr.]\r\n\r\nBesides such stamps as have already been described, the ancients used\r\nbrands, both figured and lettered, with which, when heated, they marked\r\ntheir horses, sheep, and cattle, as well as criminals, captives, and\r\nrefractory or runaway slaves.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians, according to Suidas, marked their Samian captives with\r\nthe figure of an owl; while Athenians captured by the Samians were\r\nmarked with the figure of a galley, and by the Syracusans with the\r\nfigure of a horse. The husbandman at his leisure time, as we are\r\ninformed by Virgil, in the first book of the Georgics,\r\n\r\n  “Aut pecori signa, aut numeros impressit acervis;”\r\n\r\nand from the third book we learn that the operation was performed by\r\nbranding:\r\n\r\n  “Continuoque notas et nomina gentis _inurunt_.”[I-11]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-11: HERMANNUS HUGO, De prima Origine Scribendi, cap.\r\n    xix. De Notis Servilibus, et cap. xx. De Notis pecudum. A further\r\n    account of the ancient _stigmata_, and of the manner in which\r\n    slaves were marked, is to be found in PIGNORIUS, De Servis.]\r\n\r\n   *   *   *\r\n\r\nSuch brands as those above noticed, commonly known by the name of\r\n_cauteria_ or _stigmata_, were also used for similar purposes during the\r\nmiddle ages; and the practice, which has not been very long obsolete, of\r\nburning homicides in the hand, and vagabonds and “sturdy beggars” on the\r\nbreast, face, or shoulder, affords an example of the employment of the\r\nbrand in the criminal jurisprudence of our own country. By the 1st\r\nEdward VI. cap. 3, it was enacted, that whosoever, man or woman, not\r\nbeing lame or impotent, nor so aged or diseased that he or she could not\r\nwork, should be convicted of loitering or idle wandering by the\r\nhighway-side, or in the streets, like a servant wanting a master, or a\r\nbeggar, he or she was to be marked with a hot iron on the breast with\r\nthe letter V [for Vagabond], and adjudged to the person bringing him or\r\nher before a justice to be his slave for two years; and if such adjudged\r\nslave should run away, he or she, upon being taken and convicted, was to\r\nbe marked on the forehead, or on the ball of the cheek, with the letter\r\nS [for Slave], and adjudged to be the said master’s slave for ever. By\r\nthe 1st of James I. cap. 7, it was also enacted, that such as were to be\r\ndeemed “rogues, vagabonds, and sturdy beggars” by the 39th of Elizabeth,\r\ncap. 4, being convicted at the sessions and found to be incorrigible,\r\nwere to be branded in the left shoulder with a hot iron, of the breadth\r\nof an English shilling, marked with a great Roman R [for Rogue]; such\r\nbranding upon the shoulder to be so thoroughly burned and set upon the\r\nskin and flesh, that the said letter R should be seen and remain for a\r\nperpetual mark upon such rogue during the remainder of his life.[I-12]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-12: History of the Poor Laws, 8vo. 1764, by Richard\r\n    Burn, LL.D., who in his observations on such punishments says: “It\r\n    is affecting to humanity to observe the various methods that have\r\n    been invented for the _punishment_ of vagrants; none of all which\r\n    wrought the desired effect . . . . . . This part of our history\r\n    looks like the history of the savages in America. Almost all\r\n    severities have been exercised against vagrants, except\r\n    scalping.”]\r\n\r\nFrom a passage in Quintilian we learn that the Romans were acquainted\r\nwith the method of _tracing_ letters, by means of a piece of thin wood\r\nin which the characters were pierced or cut through, on a principle\r\nsimilar to that on which the present art of _stencilling_ is founded. He\r\nis speaking of teaching boys to write, and the passage referred to may\r\nbe thus translated: “When the boy shall have entered upon\r\n_joining-hand_, it will be useful for him to have a _copy-head_ of wood\r\nin which the letters are well cut, that through its furrows, as it were,\r\nhe may trace the characters with his _style_. He will not thus be liable\r\nto make slips as on the wax [alone], for he will be confined by the\r\nboundary of the letters, and neither will he be able to deviate from his\r\ntext. By thus more rapidly and frequently following a definite outline,\r\nhis hand will become _set_, without his requiring any assistance from\r\nthe master to guide it.”[I-13]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-13: “Quum puer jam ductus sequi cœperit, non inutile\r\n    erit, litteras tabellæ quam optime insculpi, ut per illos, velut\r\n    sulcos, ducatur stylus.

The letters thus formed,\r\n“ex nulla materia,”[I-14] might be traced on paper by means of a pen, or\r\nwith a small brush, charged with body-colour, as stencillers _slap-dash_\r\nrooms through their pasteboard patterns, or dipped in ink in the same\r\nmanner as many shopkeepers now, through similar thin copper-plates, mark\r\nthe prices of their wares, or their own name and address on the paper in\r\nwhich such wares are wrapped.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-14: Prosper Marchand, at page 9 of his “Histoire de\r\n    l’Imprimerie,” gives the following title of a book in 8vo. which\r\n    was wholly, both text and figures, executed in this manner, _percé\r\n    au jour_, in vellum: “Liber Passionis Domini Nostri Jesu Christi,\r\n    cum figuris et characteribus _ex nulla materia_ compositis.” He\r\n    states that in 1640 it was in the collection of Albert Henry,\r\n    Prince de Ligne, and quotes a description of it from Anton.\r\n    Sanderi Bibliotheca Belgica Manuscripta, parte ii. p. 1.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the sixth century it appears, from Procopius, that the Emperor\r\nJustin I. made use of a tablet of wood pierced or cut in a similar\r\nmanner, through which he traced in red ink, the imperial colour, his\r\nsignature, consisting of the first four letters of his name. It is also\r\nstated that Theodoric, King of the Ostrogoths, the contemporary of\r\nJustin, used after the same manner to sign the first four letters of his\r\nname through a plate of gold;[I-15] and in Peringskiold’s edition of the\r\nLife of Theodoric, the annexed is given as the monogram[I-16] of that\r\nmonarch. The authenticity of this account has, however, been questioned,\r\nas Cochlæus, who died in 1552, cites no ancient authority for the fact.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-15: “Rex Theodoricus inliteratus erat, et sic obruto\r\n    sensu ut in decem annos regni sui quatuor literas subscriptionis\r\n    edicti sui discere nullatenus potuisset.

The annexed monogram of Charlemagne has been\r\ncopied from Peringskiold, “Annotationes in Vitam Theodorici,” p. 584; it\r\nis also given in Ducange’s Glossary, and in the “Nouveau Traité de\r\nDiplomatique.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-17: Mabillon’s opinion is founded on the following\r\n    passage in the Life of Charlemagne, by his secretary Eginhard:\r\n    “_Ut scilicet imperitiam hanc [scribendi] honesto ritu suppleret,\r\n    monogrammatis usum loco proprii signi invexit_.”]\r\n\r\nThe monogram, either stencilled or stamped, consisted of a combination\r\nof the letters of the person’s name, a fanciful character, or the figure\r\nof a cross,[I-18] accompanied with a peculiar kind of flourish, called\r\nby French writers on diplomatics _parafe_ or _ruche_. This mode of\r\nsigning appears to have been common in most nations of Europe during the\r\nninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries; and it was practised by nobles and\r\nthe higher orders of the clergy, as well as by kings. It continued to be\r\nused by the kings of France to the time of Philip III. and by the\r\nSpanish monarchs to a much later period. It also appears to have been\r\nadopted by some of the Saxon kings of England; and the authors of the\r\n“Nouveau Traité de Diplomatique” say that they had seen similar marks\r\nproduced by a stamp of William the Conqueror, when Duke of Normandy. We\r\nhave had a recent instance of the use of the _stampilla_, as it is\r\ncalled by diplomatists, in affixing the royal signature. During the\r\nillness of George IV. in 1830, a silver stamp, containing a fac-simile\r\nof the king’s sign-manual, was executed by Wyon, which was stamped on\r\ndocuments requiring the royal signature, by commissioners, in his\r\nMajesty’s presence. A similar stamp was used during the last illness of\r\nHenry VIII. for the purpose of affixing the royal signature. The king’s\r\nwarrant empowering commissioners to use the stamp may be seen in Rymer’s\r\nFœdera, vol. xv. p. 101, anno 1546. It is believed that the warrant\r\nwhich sent the poet Surrey to the scaffold was signed with this stamp,\r\nand not with Henry’s own hand.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-18: “Triplex cruces exarandi modus: 1. penna sive\r\n    calamo; 2. lamina interrasili; 3. stampilla sive typo anaglyptico.\r\n    Laminæ interrasiles ex auro aliove metallo, vel ex ebore etiam\r\n    confectæ sunt, atque ita perforatæ, ut hiatus, pro re nata,\r\n    crucium cet. speciem præ se ferrent, per quos velut sulcos,\r\n    calamus sive penna ducebatur.

That\r\nsuch marks were stamped is almost certain; for the first, which is that\r\nof Gundisalvo Tellez, affixed to a charter of the date of 840, is the\r\nsame as the “sign” which was affixed by his widow, Flamula, when she\r\ngranted certain property to the abbot and monks of Cardeña for the good\r\nof her deceased husband’s soul. The second, which is of the date of 886,\r\nwas used both by the abbot Ovecus, and Peter his nephew; and the third\r\nwas used by all the four children of one Ordoño, as their “sign” to a\r\ncharter of donation executed in 1018. The fourth mark is a Runic cypher,\r\ncopied from an ancient Icelandic manuscript, and given by Peringskiold\r\nin his “Annotations on the Life of Theodoric:” it is not given here as\r\nbeing from a stencil or a stamp, but that it may be compared with the\r\napparently Gothic monograms used in Spain.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n“In their inscriptions, and in the rubrics of their books,” says a\r\nwriter in the Edinburgh Review[I-19] “the Spanish Goths, like the Romans\r\nof the Lower Empire, were fond of using combined capitals--of\r\n_monogrammatising_. This mode of writing is now common in Spain, on the\r\nsign-boards and on the shop-fronts, where it has retained its place in\r\ndefiance of the canons of the council [of Leon], The Goths, however,\r\nretained a truly _Gothic_ custom in their writings. The Spanish Goth\r\nsometimes subscribed his name; or he drew a _monogram_ like the Roman\r\nemperors, or the sign of the _cross_ like the Saxon; but not\r\nunfrequently he affixed strange and fanciful marks to the deed or\r\ncharter, bearing a close resemblance to the Runic or magical knots of\r\nwhich so many have been engraved by Peringskiold, and other northern\r\nantiquaries.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-19: No. lxi. p. 108, where the preceding Gothic marks,\r\n    with the explanation of them, are given.]\r\n\r\nTo the tenth or the eleventh century are also to be referred certain\r\nsmall silver coins--“something between counters and money,” as is\r\nobserved by Pinkerton--which are impressed, on one side only, with a\r\nkind of Runic monogram. They are formed of very thin pieces of silver;\r\nand it has been supposed that the impression was produced from wooden\r\ndies. They are known to collectors as “_nummi bracteati_”--tinsel money;\r\nand Pinkerton, mistaking the Runic character for the Christian cross,\r\nsays that “most of them are ecclesiastic.” He is perhaps nearer the\r\ntruth when he adds that they “belong to the tenth century, and are\r\ncommonly found in Germany, and the northern kingdoms of Sweden and\r\nDenmark.”[I-20] The four following copies from the original coins in the\r\nBrennerian collection are given by Peringskiold, in his “Annotations on\r\nthe Life of Theodoric,” previously referred to. The characters on the\r\nthree first he reads as the letters EIR, OIR, and AIR, respectively, and\r\nconsiders them to be intended to represent the name of Eric the\r\nVictorious. The characters on the fourth he reads as EIM, and applies\r\nthem to Emund Annosus, the nephew of Eric the Victorious, who succeeded\r\nto the Sueo-Gothic throne in 1051; about which time, through the\r\ninfluence of the monks, the ancient Runic characters were exchanged for\r\nRoman.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-20: Essay on Medals, pp. 144, 145.

In some of those marks or stamps the name of the notary\r\ndoes not appear, and in others a small space is left in order that it\r\nmight afterwards be inserted with a pen.

The English trader was accustomed to\r\nplace his mark as his “sign” in his shop-front in the same manner as the\r\nSpaniard did his monogram: if he was a wool-stapler, he stamped it on\r\nhis packs; or if a fish-curer, it was branded on the end of his casks.\r\nIf he built himself a new house, his mark was frequently placed between\r\nhis initials over the principal door-way, or over the fireplace of the\r\nhall; if he made a gift to a church or a chapel, his mark was emblazoned\r\non the windows beside the knight’s or the nobleman’s shield of arms; and\r\nwhen he died, his mark was cut upon his tomb. Of the following\r\nmerchants’-marks, the first is that of Adam de Walsokne, who died in\r\n1349; the second that of Edmund Pepyr, who died in 1483; those two marks\r\nare from their tombs in St. Margaret’s, Lynn; and the third is from a\r\nwindow in the same church.[I-23]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-23: The marks here given are copied from Mackarel’s\r\n    History of King’s Lynn, 8vo. 1737. In the same book there are\r\n    upwards of thirty more of a similar kind, from the middle of the\r\n    fourteenth century to the latter end of the seventeenth. Perhaps\r\n    no two counties in the kingdom afford so many examples of\r\n    merchants’-marks and monumental brasses as Norfolk and Suffolk.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn Pierce Ploughman’s Creed, written after the death of Wickliffe, which\r\nhappened in 1384, and consequently more modern than many of Chaucer’s\r\npoems, merchants’-marks are thus mentioned in the description of a\r\nwindow of a Dominican convent:\r\n\r\n  “Wide windows y-wrought, y-written full thick,\r\n  Shining with shapen shields, to shewen about,\r\n  With _marks of merchants_, y-meddled between,\r\n  Mo than twenty and two, twice y-numbered.[I-24]”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-24: “_Y-meddled_ is mixed; the marks of merchants are\r\n    put in opposition to the ‘shapen shields,’ because merchants had\r\n    no coats of arms.”--Specimens of the Early English Poets, by\r\n    George Ellis, Esq. vol. i. p. 163. Edit. 1811.]\r\n\r\nHaving thus endeavoured to prove by a continuous chain of evidence that\r\nthe principle of producing impressions from raised lines was known, and\r\npractised, at a very early period; and that it was applied for the\r\npurpose of impressing letters and other characters on paper, though\r\nperhaps confined to signatures only, long previous to 1423,--which is\r\nthe earliest date that has been discovered on a wood-cut, in the modern\r\nsense of the word, impressed on paper, and accompanied with explanatory\r\nwords cut on the same block;[I-25] and having shown that the principle\r\nof stencilling--the manner in which the above-named cut is\r\ncoloured[I-26]--was also known in the middle ages; it appears requisite,\r\nnext to briefly notice the contemporary existence of the cognate arts of\r\ndie-sinking, seal-cutting, and engraving on brass, and afterwards to\r\nexamine the grounds of certain speculations on the introduction and\r\nearly practice of wood-engraving and block-printing in Europe.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-25: “Till lately this was the earliest dated evidence\r\n    of block printing known; but there has just been discovered at\r\n    Malines, and now deposited at Brussels, a woodcut of similar\r\n    character, but assumed to be Dutch or Flemish, dated MCCCCXVIII.;\r\n    and though there seems no reason to doubt the genuineness of the\r\n    cut, it is currently asserted that the date bears evidence of\r\n    having been tampered with.”--Extract from Bohn’s Lecture on\r\n    Printing.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-26: The woodcut referred to is that of St.\r\n    Christopher, discovered by Heineken, pasted within the cover of a\r\n    book in the Monastery of Buxheim, near Memmingen, in Suabia. It is\r\n    of a folio size, and is coloured by means of stencils; a practice\r\n    which appears to have been adopted at an early part of the\r\n    fifteenth century by the German Formschneiders and Briefmalers,\r\n    literally, figure-cutters and cardpainters, to colour their cuts\r\n    and their cards. The St. Christopher is now in Earl Spencer’s\r\n    library. (See a reduced copy of it at p. 46).]\r\n\r\nConcerning the first invention of stamping letters and figures upon\r\ncoins, and the name of the inventor, it is fruitless to inquire, as the\r\norigin of the art is lost in the remoteness of antiquity. “Leaving these\r\nuncertainties,” says Pinkerton, in his Essay on Medals, “we know from\r\nrespectable authorities that the first money coined in Greece was that\r\nstruck in the island of Ægina, by Phidon king of Argos. His reign is\r\nfixed by the Arundelian marbles to an era correspondent to the 885th\r\nyear before Christ; but whether he derived this art from Lydia or any\r\nother source we are not told.” About three hundred years before the\r\nbirth of Christ, the art of coining, so far as relates to the beauty of\r\nthe heads impressed, appears to have attained its perfection in\r\nGreece;--we may indeed say its perfection generally, for the specimens\r\nwhich were then produced in that country remain unsurpassed by modern\r\nart. Under the Roman emperors the art never seems to have attained so\r\nhigh a degree of perfection as it did in Greece; though several of the\r\ncoins of Hadrian, probably executed by Greek artists, display great\r\nbeauty of design and execution. The art of coining, with the rest of the\r\nornamental arts, declined with the empire; and, on its final subversion\r\nin Italy, the coins of its rulers were scarcely superior to those which\r\nwere subsequently minted in England, Germany, and France, during the\r\ndarkest period of the middle ages.\r\n\r\nThe art of coining money, however rude in design and imperfect in its\r\nmode of stamping the impression, which was by repeated blows with a\r\nhammer, was practised from the twelfth to the sixteenth century in a\r\ngreater number of places than at present; for many of the more powerful\r\nbishops and nobles assumed or extorted the right of coining money as\r\nwell as the king; and in our own country the archbishops of Canterbury\r\nand York, and the bishop of Durham, exercised the right of coinage till\r\nthe Reformation; and local mints for coining the king’s money were\r\noccasionally fixed at Norwich, Chester, York, St. Edmundsbury,\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne, and other places. Independent of those establishments\r\nfor the coining of _money_, almost every abbey struck its own _jettons_\r\nor counters; which were thin pieces of copper, commonly impressed with a\r\npious legend, and used in _casting up accounts_, but which the general\r\nintroduction of the numerals now in use, and an improved system of\r\narithmetic, have rendered unnecessary. As such mints were at least as\r\nnumerous in France and Germany as in our own country, Scheffer, the\r\npartner of Faust, when he conceived the idea of casting letters from\r\nmatrices formed by punches, would have little difficulty in finding a\r\nworkman to assist him in carrying his plans into execution. “The art of\r\nimpressing legends on coins,” says Astle in his Account of the Origin\r\nand Progress of writing, “is nothing more than the art of printing on\r\nmedals.” That the art of casting letters in relief, though not\r\nseparately, and most likely from a mould of sand, was known to the\r\nRomans, is evident from the names of the emperors Domitian and Hadrian\r\non some pigs of lead in the British Museum; and that it was practised\r\nduring the middle and succeeding ages, we have ample testimony from the\r\ninscriptions on our ancient bells.[I-27]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-27: The small and thick brass coins, struck by Grecian\r\n    cities under the Roman emperors, and known to collectors as\r\n    “colonial Greek,” appear to have been cast, and moulds for such a\r\n    purpose have been discovered in our own country.]\r\n\r\nIn the century immediately preceding 1423, the date of the wood-cut of\r\nSt. Christopher, the use of seals, for the purpose of authenticating\r\ndocuments by their impression on wax, was general throughout Europe;\r\nkings, nobles, bishops, abbots, and all who “came of _gentle_ blood,”\r\nwith corporations, lay and clerical, all had seals. They were mostly of\r\nbrass, for the art of engraving on precious stones does not appear to\r\nhave been at that time revived, with the letters and device cut or cast\r\nin hollow--_en creux_--on the face of the seal, in order that the\r\nimpression might appear raised. The workmanship of many of those seals,\r\nand more especially of some of the conventional ones, where figures of\r\nsaints and a view of the abbey are introduced, displays no mean degree\r\nof skill. Looking on such specimens of the graver’s art, and bearing in\r\nmind the character of many of the drawings which are to be seen in the\r\nmissals and other manuscripts of the fourteenth century and of the early\r\npart of the fifteenth, we need no longer be surprised that the cuts of\r\nthe earliest block-books should be so well executed.\r\n\r\nThe art of engraving on copper and other metals, though not with the\r\nintention of taking impressions on paper, is of great antiquity. In the\r\nlate Mr. Salt’s collection of Egyptian antiquities there was a small\r\naxe, probably a model, the head of which was formed of sheet-copper, and\r\nwas tied, or rather bandaged, to the helve with slips of cloth. There\r\nwere certain characters engraved upon the head in such a manner that if\r\nit were inked and submitted to the action of the rolling-press,\r\nimpressions would be obtained as from a modern copper-plate. The axe,\r\nwith other models of a carpenter’s tools, also of copper, was found in a\r\ntomb in Egypt, where it must have been deposited at a very early period.\r\nThat the ancient Greeks and Romans were accustomed to engrave on copper\r\nand other metals in a similar manner, is evident from engraved pateræ\r\nand other ornamental works executed by people of those nations. Though\r\nno ancient writer makes mention of the art of engraving being employed\r\nfor the purpose of producing impressions on paper, yet it has been\r\nconjectured by De Pauw, from a passage in Pliny,[I-28] that such an art\r\nwas invented by Varro for the purpose of multiplying the portraits of\r\neminent men. “No Greek,” says De Pauw, speaking of engraving, “has the\r\nleast right to claim this invention, which belongs exclusively to Varro,\r\nas is expressed by Pliny in no equivocal terms, when he calls this\r\nmethod _inventum Varronis_. Engraved plates were employed which gave the\r\nprofile and the principal traits of the figures, to which the\r\nappropriate colours and the shadows were afterwards added with the\r\npencil. A woman, originally of Cyzica, but then settled in Italy,\r\nexcelled all others in the talent of illumining such kind of prints,\r\nwhich were inserted by Varro in a large work of his entitled\r\n‘_Imagines_’ or ‘_Hebdomades_,’ which was enriched with seven hundred\r\nportraits of distinguished men, copied from their statues and busts. The\r\nnecessity of exactly repeating each portrait or figure in every copy of\r\nthe work suggested the idea of multiplying them without much cost, and\r\nthus gave birth to an art till then unknown.”[I-29] The grounds,\r\nhowever, of this conjecture are extremely slight, and will not without\r\nadditional support sustain the superstructure which De Pauw--an\r\n“ingenious” guesser, but a superficial inquirer--has so plausibly\r\nraised. A prop for this theory has been sought for by men of greater\r\nresearch than the original propounder, but hitherto without success.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-28: “That a strong passion for portraits formerly\r\n    existed, is attested both by Atticus, the friend of Cicero, who\r\n    wrote a work on this subject, and by M. Varro, who conceived the\r\n    very liberal idea of inserting by some means or other, in his\r\n    numerous volumes, the portraits of seven hundred individuals; as\r\n    he could not bear the idea that all traces of their features\r\n    should be lost, or that the lapse of centuries should get the\r\n    better of mankind.”--Pliny’s Natural History, Book XXXV. chap.\r\n    2.--(Bohn’s Ed. vol. vi. p. 226. M. Deville is of opinion that\r\n    these portraits were made in relief upon plates of metal, perhaps\r\n    bronze, and coloured with minium, a red tint much esteemed by the\r\n    Romans).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-29: See De Pauw, Recherches Philosophiques sur les\r\n    Grecs, t. ii. p. 100. The subject is discussed in Meusel’s “Neue\r\n    Miscellaneen von artistischen Inhalts,” part xii. p. 380-387, in\r\n    an article, “Sind wirklich die Römer die Erfinder der\r\n    Kupferstecherkunst?--Were the Romans truly the inventors of\r\n    copper-plate engraving?”--by A. Rode. Böttiger, one of the most\r\n    learned and intelligent of all German writers on the fine arts,\r\n    and Fea, the editor of Winkleman’s History of Art, do not admit De\r\n    Pauw’s conjecture, but decide the question in the negative.]\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1300 we have evidence of monumental brasses, with large\r\nfigures engraved on them, being fixed on tombs in this country; and it\r\nis not unlikely that they were known both here and on the Continent at\r\nan earlier period. The best specimens known in this country are such as\r\nwere in all probability executed previous to 1400. In the succeeding\r\ncentury the figures and ornamental work generally appear to be designed\r\nin a worse taste and more carelessly executed; and in the age of Queen\r\nElizabeth the art, such as it was, appears to have reached the lowest\r\npoint of degradation, the monumental brasses of that reign being\r\ngenerally the worst which are to be met with.\r\n\r\nThe figures on several of the more ancient brasses are well drawn, and\r\nthe folds of the drapery in the dresses of the females are, as a painter\r\nwould say, “well cast;” and the faces occasionally display a\r\nconsiderable degree of correct and elevated expression. Many of the\r\nfigures are of the size of life, marked with a hold outline well\r\nploughed into the brass, and having the features, armour, and drapery\r\nindicated by single lines of greater or less strength as might be\r\nrequired. Attempts at shading are also occasionally to be met with; the\r\neffect being produced by means of lines obliquely crossing each other in\r\nthe manner of cross-hatchings. Whether impressions were ever taken or\r\nnot from such early brasses by the artists who executed them, it is\r\nperhaps now impossible to ascertain; but that they might do so is beyond\r\na doubt, for it is now a common practice, and two immense volumes of\r\nimpressions taken from monumental brasses, for the late Craven Ord,\r\nEsq., are preserved in the print-room of the British Museum.\r\n\r\nOne of the finest monumental brasses known in this country is that of\r\nRobert Braunche and his two wives, in St. Margaret’s Church, Lynn, where\r\nit appears to have been placed about the year 1364. Braunche, and his\r\ntwo wives, one on each side of him, are represented standing, of the\r\nsize of life. Above the figures are representations of five small niches\r\nsurmounted by canopies in the florid Gothic style. In the centre niche\r\nis the figure of the Deity holding apparently the infant Christ in his\r\narms. In each of the niches adjoining the centre one is an angel\r\nswinging a censer; and in the exterior niches are angels playing on\r\nmusical instruments. At the sides are figures of saints, and at the foot\r\nthere is a representation of a feast, where persons are seen seated at\r\ntable, others playing on musical instruments, while a figure kneeling\r\npresents a peacock. The length of this brass is eight feet eleven\r\ninches, and its breadth five feet two inches. It is supposed to have\r\nbeen executed in Flanders, with which country at that period the town of\r\nLynn was closely connected in the way of trade.[I-30]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-30: An excellent representation of this celebrated\r\n    monument is given in Cotman’s “Engravings from the most remarkable\r\n    Sepulchral Brasses in Norfolk,” folio, 1819 (republished with\r\n    considerable additions in 2 vols. folio, 1839).]\r\n\r\nIt has frequently been asserted that the art of wood engraving in Europe\r\nwas derived from the Chinese; by whom, it is also said, that the art was\r\npractised in the reign of the renowned emperor Wu-Wang, who flourished\r\n1120 years before the birth of Christ. As both these statements seem to\r\nrest on equal authorities, I attach to each an equal degree of\r\ncredibility; that is, by believing neither. As Mr. Ottley has expressed\r\nan opinion in favour of the Chinese origin of the art,--though without\r\nadopting the tale of its being practised in the reign of Wu-Wang, which\r\nhe shows has been taken by the wrong end,--I shall here take the liberty\r\nof examining the tenability of his arguments.\r\n\r\nAt page 8, in the first chapter of his work, Mr. Ottley cautiously says\r\nthat the “art of printing from engraved blocks of wood appears to be of\r\nvery high antiquity amongst the Chinese;” and at page 9, after citing Du\r\nHalde, as informing us that the art of printing was not discovered until\r\nabout fifty years before the Christian era, he rather inconsistently\r\nobserves: “So says Father Du Halde, whose authority I give without any\r\ncomment, as the defence of Chinese chronology makes no part of the\r\npresent undertaking.” Unless Mr. Ottley is satisfied of the correctness\r\nof the chronology, he can by no means cite Du Halde’s account as\r\nevidence of the very high antiquity of printing in China; which in every\r\nother part of his book he speaks of as a well-established fact, and yet\r\nrefers to no other authority than Du Halde, who relies on the\r\ncorrectness of that Chinese chronology with the defence of which Mr.\r\nOttley will have nothing to do.\r\n\r\nIt is also worthy of remark, that in the same chapter he corrects two\r\nwriters, Papillon and Jansen, for erroneously applying a passage in Du\r\nHalde as proving that the art of printing was known in the reign of\r\nWu-Wang,--he who flourished Ante Christum 1120; whereas the said passage\r\nwas not alleged “by Du Halde to prove the antiquity of printing amongst\r\nthe Chinese, but solely in reference to their ink.” The passage, as\r\ntranslated by Mr. Ottley, is as follows: “As the stone Me” (a word\r\nsignifying ink in the Chinese language), “which is used to blacken the\r\n_engraved_ characters, can never become white; so a heart blackened by\r\nvices will always retain its blackness.” The engraved characters were\r\nnot inked, it appears, for the purpose of taking impressions, as Messrs.\r\nPapillon and Jansen have erroneously inferred. “It is possible,”\r\naccording to Mr. Ottley, “that the ink might be used by the Chinese at a\r\nvery early period to blacken, and thereby render more easily legible,\r\nthe characters of engraved inscriptions.”[I-31] The _possibility_ of\r\nthis may be granted certainly; but at the same time we must admit that\r\nit is equally _possible_ that the engraved characters were blackened\r\nwith ink for the purpose of being printed, if they were of wood; or\r\nthat, if cut in copper or other metal, they were filled with a black\r\ncomposition which would harden or _set_ in the lines,--as an ingenious\r\ninquirer might infer from ink being represented by the _stone_ ME; and\r\nthus it is _possible_ that something very like “niello,” or the filling\r\nof letters on brass doorplates with black wax, was known to the Chinese\r\nin the reign of Wu-Wang, who flourished in the year before our Lord,\r\n1120. The one conjecture is as good as the other, and both good for\r\nnothing, until we have better assurance than is afforded by Du Halde,\r\nthat engraved characters blackened with ink--for whatever purpose--were\r\nknown by the Chinese in the reign of Wu-Wang.[I-32]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-31: At page 7, Mr. Ottley, borrowing from Du Halde,\r\n    has erroneously stated that the delicate nature of their paper\r\n    would not permit the use of a press. He must have forgot, for he\r\n    cannot but have known, that impressions on the finest India paper\r\n    had been frequently taken from wood-blocks by means of the common\r\n    printing-press many years previous to 1816, the date of the\r\n    publication of his book. I have never seen Chinese paper that\r\n    would bear printing by hand, which would not also bear the action\r\n    of the press, if printed without being wet in the same manner as\r\n    common paper.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-32: It would appear that Chinese annalists themselves\r\n    were not agreed as to the period when printing by the hand from\r\n    wood-blocks was first practised in that country. “Nicholas\r\n    Trigaltius, a member of our order,” writes Herman Hugo, “who has\r\n    recently returned from China, gives the following information\r\n    respecting printing, which he professes to have carefully\r\n    extracted from the annals of the Chinese themselves. ‘_Typography\r\n    is of somewhat earlier date in China than in Europe, for it is\r\n    certain that it was practised in that country about five centuries\r\n    ago. Others assert that it was practised in China at a period\r\n    prior to the Christian era._’”--Hermannus Hugo, De Prima Origine\r\n    Scribendi, p. 211. Antwerpiæ, 1617.]\r\n\r\nAlthough so little is positively known of the ancient history of “the\r\ngreat out-lying empire of China,” as it is called by Sir William Jones,\r\nyet it has been most confidently referred to as affording authentic\r\nevidence of the high degree of the civilization and knowledge of the\r\nChinese at a period when Europe was dark with the gloom of barbarism and\r\nignorance. Their early history has been generally found, when\r\nopportunity has been afforded of impartially examining it, to be a mere\r\ntissue of absurd legends; compared to which, the history of the\r\nsettlement of King Brute in Britain is authentic. With astronomy as a\r\nscience they are scarcely acquainted; and their specimens of the fine\r\narts display little more than representations of objects executed not\r\nunfrequently with minute accuracy, but without a knowledge of the most\r\nsimple elements of correct design, and without the slightest pretensions\r\nto art, according to our standard.\r\n\r\nOne of the two Mahometan travellers who visited China in the ninth\r\ncentury, expressly states that the Chinese were unacquainted with the\r\nsciences; and as neither of them takes any notice of printing, the\r\nmariner’s compass, or gunpowder, it seems but reasonable to conclude\r\nthat the Chinese were unacquainted with those inventions at that\r\nperiod.[I-33]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-33: The pretensions of the Chinese to excellence in\r\n    science are ably exposed by the learned Abbé Renaudot in a\r\n    disquisition “Sur les sciences des Chinois,” appended to his\r\n    translation, from the Arabic, entitled “Anciennes Relations des\r\n    Indes et de la Chine, de deux Voyageurs Mahométans, qui y allèrent\r\n    dans le neuvième siècle.”--8vo. Paris, 1718.]\r\n\r\nMr. Ottley, at pages 51 and 52 of his work, gives a brief account of the\r\nearly commerce of Venice with the East, for the purpose of showing in\r\nwhat manner a knowledge of the art of printing in China might be\r\nobtained by the Venetians. He says: “They succeeded, likewise, in\r\nestablishing a direct traffic with Persia, Tartary, China, and Japan;\r\nsending, for that purpose, several of their most respectable citizens,\r\nand largely providing them with every requisite.” He cites an Italian\r\nauthor for this account, but he observes a prudent silence as to the\r\nperiod when the Venetians first established a _direct traffic_ with\r\nChina and Japan; though there is little doubt that Bettinelli, the\r\nauthority referred to, alludes to the expedition of the two brothers\r\nNiccolo and Maffeo Polo, and of Marco Polo, the son of Niccolo, who in\r\n1271 or 1272 left Venice on an expedition to the court of the Tartar\r\nemperor Kublai-Khan, which had been previously visited by the two\r\nbrothers at some period between 1254 and 1269.[I-34] After having\r\nvisited Tartary and China, the two brothers and Marco returned to Venice\r\nin 1295. Mr. Ottley, however, does not refer to the travels of the Polos\r\nfor the purpose of showing that Marco, who at a subsequent period wrote\r\nan account of his travels, might introduce a knowledge of the Chinese\r\nart of printing into Europe: he cites them that his readers may suppose\r\nthat a direct intercourse between Venice and China had been established\r\nlong before; and that the art of engraving wood-blocks, and taking\r\nimpressions from them, had been thus derived from the latter country,\r\nand had been practised in Venice long before the return of the\r\ntravellers in 1295.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-34: See the Travels of Marco Polo. (In Bohn’s Antiq.\r\n    Library).]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary here to observe that the invention of the mariner’s\r\ncompass, and of gunpowder and cannon, have been ascribed to the Chinese\r\nas well as the invention of wood engraving and block-printing; and it\r\nhas been conjectured that _very probably_ Marco Polo communicated to his\r\ncountrymen, and through them to the rest of Europe, a knowledge of those\r\narts. Marco Polo, however, does not in the account which he wrote of his\r\ntravels once allude to gunpowder, cannon, or to the art of printing as\r\nbeing known in China;[I-35] nor does he once mention the compass as\r\nbeing used on board of the Chinese vessel in which he sailed from the\r\ncoast of China to the Persian Gulf. “Nothing is more common,” says a\r\nwriter in the Quarterly Review, “than to find it repeated from book to\r\nbook, that gunpowder and the mariner’s compass were first brought from\r\nChina by Marco Polo, though there can be very little doubt that both\r\nwere known in Europe some time before his return.”--“That Marco Polo,”\r\nsays the same writer, “would have mentioned the mariner’s compass, if it\r\nhad been in use in China, we think highly probable; and his silence\r\nrespecting gunpowder may be considered as at least a negative proof that\r\nthis also was unknown to the Chinese in the time of Kublai-Khan.”[I-36]\r\nIn a manner widely different from this does Mr. Ottley reason,\r\nrespecting the cause of Marco Polo not having mentioned printing as an\r\nart practised by the Chinese. He accounts for the traveller’s silence as\r\nfollows: “Marco Polo, it may be said, did not notice this art [of\r\nengraving on wood and block-printing] in the account which he left us of\r\nthe marvels he had witnessed in China. The answer to this objection is\r\nobvious: it was no marvel; it had no novelty to recommend it; it was\r\npractised, as we have seen, at Ravenna, in 1285, and had perhaps been\r\npractised a century earlier in Venice. His mention of it, therefore, was\r\nnot called for, and he preferred instructing his countrymen in matters\r\nwith which they were not hitherto acquainted.” This “obvious” answer,\r\nrather unfortunately, will equally apply to the question, “Why did not\r\nMarco Polo mention cannon as being used by the Chinese, who, as we are\r\ninformed, had discovered such formidable engines of war long before the\r\nperiod of his visit?”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-35: It has been conjectured that the following\r\n    passages in the travels of Marco Polo might suggest the idea of\r\n    block-printing, and consequently wood engraving: “Gradatim\r\n    reliquos belli duces in digniorem ponit statum, donatque illis\r\n    aurea et argentea vasa, tabulas, privilegia atque immunitatem. Et\r\n    hæc quidem privilegia tabulis vel bracteis per sculpturas\r\n    imprimuntur.” “Moneta magni Cham non fit de auro vel argento, aut\r\n    alio metallo, sed corticem accipiunt medium ab arbore mori, et\r\n    hunc consolidant, atque in particular varias et rotundas, magnas\r\n    et parvas, scindunt, atque regale imprimunt signum.”--M. Pauli\r\n    Veneti Itiner. lib. ii. capp. vii. & xxi. The mention of paper\r\n    money impressed with the royal stamp also occurs in the Eastern\r\n    History of Haython, an Armenian, whose work was written in 1307,\r\n    in Latin, and has been printed several times, of which the last\r\n    edition is by And. Müller, Colon. 1671, 4to.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-36: An article on Marsden’s “Translation of the\r\n    Travels of Marco Polo,” in the Quarterly Review, No. xli. May,\r\n    1819, from p. 191 to 195, contains some curious particulars\r\n    respecting the early use of the mariner’s compass, and of\r\n    gunpowder and cannon in Europe.]\r\n\r\nThat the art of engraving wood-blocks and of taking impressions from\r\nthem was introduced into Europe from China, I can see no sufficient\r\nreason to believe. Looking at the frequent practice in Europe, from the\r\ntwelfth to the fifteenth century, of impressing inked stamps on paper,\r\nI can perceive nothing in the earliest specimens of wood engraving but\r\nthe same principles applied on a larger scale. When I am once satisfied\r\nthat a man had built a small boat, I feel no surprise on learning that\r\nhis grandson had built a larger; and made in it a longer voyage than his\r\nancestor ever ventured on, who merely used his slight skiff to ferry\r\nhimself across a river.\r\n\r\nIn the first volume of Papillon’s “Traité de la Gravure en Bois,” there\r\nis an account of certain old wood engravings which he professes to have\r\nseen, and which, according to their engraved explanatory title, were\r\nexecuted by two notable young people, Alexander Alberic Cunio, _knight_,\r\nand Isabella Cunio, his twin sister, and finished by them when they were\r\nonly sixteen years old, at the time when Honorius IV. was pope; that is,\r\nat some period between the years 1285 and 1287. This story has been\r\nadopted by Mr. Ottley, and by Zani, an Italian, who give it the benefit\r\nof their support. Mr. Singer, in his “Researches into the History of\r\nPlaying Cards,” grants the truth-like appearance of Papillon’s tale; and\r\nthe writer of the article “Wood-engraving” in the Encyclopedia\r\nMetropolitana considers it as authentic. It is, however, treated with\r\ncontempt by Heineken, Huber, and Bartsch, whose knowledge of the origin\r\nand progress of engraving is at least equal to that of the four writers\r\npreviously named.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which Papillon recovered his memoranda of the works of the\r\nCunio is remarkable. In consequence of those curious notes being mislaid\r\nfor upwards of thirty-five years, the sole record of the productions of\r\nthose “ingenious and amiable twins” was very nearly lost to the world.\r\nThe _three sheets of letter-paper_ on which he had written an account of\r\ncertain old volumes of wood engravings,--that containing the cuts\r\nexecuted by the Cunio being one of the number,--he had lost for upwards\r\nof thirty-five years. For long he had only a confused idea of those\r\nsheets, though he had often searched for them in vain, when he was\r\nwriting his first essay on wood engraving, which was printed about 1737,\r\nbut never published. At length he accidentally found them, on\r\nAll-Saints’ Day, 1758, rolled up in a bundle of specimens of\r\npaper-hangings which had been executed by his father. The finding of\r\nthose three sheets afforded him the greater pleasure, as from them he\r\ndiscovered, by means of a pope’s name, an epoch of engraving figures and\r\nletters on wood for the purpose of being printed, which was certainly\r\nmuch earlier than _any_ at that period known in Europe, and at the same\r\ntime a history relative to this subject equally curious and interesting.\r\nHe says that he had so completely forgotten all this,--though he had so\r\noften recollected to search for his memoranda,--that he did not deign to\r\ntake the least notice of it in his previously printed history of the\r\nart. The following is a faithful abstract of Papillon’s account of his\r\ndiscovery of those early specimens of wood engraving. The title-page, as\r\ngiven by him in French from Monsieur De Greder’s _vivâ voce_ translation\r\nof the original,--which was “en mauvais Latin ou ancien Italien\r\nGothique, avec beaucoup d’abréviations,”--is translated without\r\nabridgment, as are also his own descriptions of the cuts.\r\n\r\n“When young, being engaged with my father in going almost every day to\r\nhang rooms with our papers, I was, some time in 1719 or 1720, at the\r\nvillage of Bagneux, near Mont Rouge, at a Monsieur De Greder’s, a Swiss\r\ncaptain, who had a pretty house there. After I had papered a small room\r\nfor him, he ordered me to cover the shelves of his library with paper in\r\nimitation of mosaic. One day after dinner he surprised me reading a\r\nbook, which occasioned him to show me some very old ones which he had\r\nborrowed of one of his friends, a Swiss officer,[I-37] that he might\r\nexamine them at his leisure. We talked about the figures which they\r\ncontained, and of the antiquity of wood engraving; and what follows is a\r\ndescription of those ancient books as I wrote it before him, and as he\r\nwas so kind as to explain and dictate to me.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-37: A Monsieur Spirchtvel, as Papillon informs us.\r\n    Tom. i. p. 92.]\r\n\r\n“In a _cartouch_[I-38] or frontispiece,--of fanciful and Gothic\r\nornaments, though pleasing enough,--nine inches wide, and six inches\r\nhigh, having at the top the arms, doubtless, of Cunio, the following\r\nwords are coarsely engraved on the same block, in bad Latin, or ancient\r\nGothic Italian with many abbreviations.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-38: _Cartouch._ “This word is used to denote those\r\n    fantastic ornaments which were formerly introduced in decorating\r\n    the wainscots of rooms; and frequently served the purpose of\r\n    frames, surrounding inscriptions, small paintings, or other\r\n    devices. These _cartouches_ were much in vogue in the sixteenth\r\n    and seventeenth centuries for the frontispieces of books of\r\n    prints; and indeed _Callot_ and _Della Bella_ etched many entire\r\n    sets of small subjects surrounded by similar ornaments. From the\r\n    irregularity of their forms, the terms tablet shield, or panel,\r\n    would be but ill expressive of their character.”--Ottley’s\r\n    Inquiry, vol. i. p. 12.]\r\n\r\n“‘THE CHIVALROUS DEEDS, in figures, of the great and magnanimous\r\nMacedonian king, the courageous and valiant Alexander, dedicated,\r\npresented, and humbly offered to the most holy father, Pope Honorius IV.\r\nthe glory and stay of the Church, and to our illustrious and generous\r\nfather and mother, by us Alexander Alberic Cunio, knight, and Isabella\r\nCunio, twin brother and sister; first reduced, imagined, and attempted\r\nto be executed in relief with a little knife, on blocks of wood, joined\r\nand smoothed by this learned and beloved sister, continued and finished\r\ntogether at Ravenna, after eight pictures of our designing, painted six\r\ntimes the size here represented; cut, explained in verse, and thus\r\nmarked on paper to multiply the number, and to enable us to present them\r\nas a token of friendship and affection to our relations and friends.\r\nThis was done and finished, the age of each being only sixteen years\r\ncomplete.’”\r\n\r\nAfter having given the translation of the title-page, Papillon thus\r\ncontinues the narrative in his own person: “This _cartouch_ [or\r\nornamented title-page] is surrounded by a coarse line, the tenth of an\r\ninch broad, forming a square. A few slight lines, which are irregularly\r\nexecuted and without precision, form the shading of the ornaments. The\r\nimpression, in the same manner as the rest of the cuts, has been taken\r\nin Indian blue, rather pale, and in distemper, apparently by the hand\r\nbeing passed frequently over the paper laid upon the block, as\r\ncard-makers are accustomed to impress their addresses and the envelopes\r\nof their cards. The hollow parts of the block, not being sufficiently\r\ncut away in several places, and having received the ink, have smeared\r\nthe paper, which is rather brown; a circumstance which has caused the\r\nfollowing words to be written in the margin underneath, that the fault\r\nmight be remedied. They are in Gothic Italian, which M. de Greder had\r\nconsiderable difficulty in making out, and certainly written by the hand\r\neither of the Chevalier Cunio or his sister, on this first\r\nproof--evidently from a block--such as are here translated.”\r\n\r\n“‘_It is necessary to cut away the ground of the blocks more, that the\r\npaper may not touch it in taking impressions._’”\r\n\r\n“Following this frontispiece, and of the same size, are the subjects of\r\nthe eight pictures, engraved on wood, surrounded by a similar line\r\nforming a square, and also with the shadows formed of slight lines. At\r\nthe foot of each of those engravings, between the border-line and\r\nanother, about a finger’s breadth distant, are four Latin verses\r\nengraved on the block, poetically explaining the subject, the title of\r\nwhich is placed at the head. In all, the impression is similar to that\r\nof the frontispiece, and rather grey or cloudy, as if the paper had not\r\nbeen moistened. The figures, tolerably designed, though in a semi-gothic\r\ntaste, are well enough characterized and draped; and we may perceive\r\nfrom them that the arts of design were then beginning gradually to\r\nresume their vigour in Italy. At the feet of the principal figures their\r\nnames are engraved, such as Alexander, Philip, _Darius_, Campaspe, and\r\nothers.”\r\n\r\n“SUBJECT 1.--Alexander mounted on Bucephalus, which he has tamed. On a\r\nstone are these words: _Isabel. Cunio pinx. & scalp._”\r\n\r\n“SUBJECT 2.--Passage of the Granicus. Near the trunk of a tree these\r\nwords are engraved: _Alex. Alb. Cunio Equ. pinx. Isabel Cunio scalp._”\r\n\r\n“SUBJECT 3.--Alexander cutting the Gordian knot. On the pedestal of a\r\ncolumn are these words: _Alexan. Albe. Cunio Equ. pinx. & scalp._ This\r\nblock is not so well engraved as the two preceding.”\r\n\r\n“SUBJECT 4.--Alexander in the tent of Darius. This subject is one of the\r\nbest composed and engraved of the whole set. Upon the end of a piece of\r\ncloth are these words: _Isabel. Cunio pinxit & scalp._”\r\n\r\n“SUBJECT 5.--Alexander generously presents his mistress Campaspe to\r\nApelles who was painting her. The figure of this beauty is very\r\nagreeable. The painter seems transported with joy at his good fortune.\r\nOn the floor, on a kind of antique tablet, are these words: _Alex. Alb.\r\nCunio Eques, pinx. & scalp._”\r\n\r\n“SUBJECT 6.--The famous battle of Arbela. Upon a small hillock are these\r\nwords: _Alex. Alb. Equ. & Isabel. pictor. and scalp._ For composition,\r\ndesign, and engraving, this subject is also one of the best.”\r\n\r\n“SUBJECT 7.--Porus, vanquished, is brought before Alexander. This\r\nsubject is so much the more beautiful and remarkable, as it is composed\r\nnearly in the same manner as that of the famous Le Brun; it would seem\r\nthat he had copied this print. Both Alexander and Porus have a grand and\r\nmagnanimous air. On a stone near a bush are engraved these words:\r\n_Isabel. Cunio pinx. & scalp._”\r\n\r\n“SUBJECT 8 AND LAST.--The glory and grand triumph of Alexander on\r\nentering Babylon. This piece, which is well enough composed, has been\r\nexecuted, as well as the sixth, by the brother and sister conjointly, as\r\nis testified by these characters engraved at the bottom of a wall:\r\n_Alex. Alb. Equ. et Isabel. Cunio, pictor. & scalp._ At the top of this\r\nimpression, a piece about three inches long and one inch broad has been\r\ntorn off.”\r\n\r\nHowever singular the above account of the works of those “amiable twins”\r\nmay seem, no less surprising is the history of their birth, parentage,\r\nand education; which, taken in conjunction with the early development of\r\ntheir talents as displayed in such an art, in the choice of such a\r\nsubject, and at such a period, is scarcely to be surpassed in interest\r\nby any narrative which gives piquancy to the pages of the Wonderful\r\nMagazine.\r\n\r\nUpon the blank leaf adjoining the last engraving were the following\r\nwords, badly written in old Swiss characters, and scarcely legible in\r\nconsequence of their having been written with pale ink. “Of course\r\nPapillon could not read Swiss,” says Mr. Ottley, “M. de Greder,\r\ntherefore, translated them for him into French.”--“This precious volume\r\nwas given to my grandfather Jan. Jacq. Turine, a native of Berne, by the\r\nillustrious Count Cunio, chief magistrate of Imola, who honoured him\r\nwith his generous friendship. Above all my books I prize this the\r\nhighest on account of the quarter from whence it came into our family,\r\nand on account of the knowledge, the valour, the beauty, and the noble\r\nand generous desire which those amiable twins Cunio had to gratify their\r\nrelations and friends. Here ensues their singular and curious history as\r\nI have heard it many a time from my venerable father, and which I have\r\ncaused to be more correctly written than I could do it myself.”\r\n\r\nThough Papillon’s long-lost manuscript, containing the whole account of\r\nthe works of the Cunio and notices of other old books of engravings,\r\nconsisted of only three sheets of letter-paper, yet the history alone of\r\nthe learned, beautiful, and amiable twins, which Turine the grandson\r\ncaused to be written out as he had heard it from his father, occupies in\r\nPapillon’s book four long octavo pages of thirty-eight lines each. To\r\nassume that his long-lost manuscript consisted of brief notes which he\r\nafterwards wrote out at length from memory, would at once destroy any\r\nvalidity that his account might be supposed to possess; for he states\r\nthat he had lost those papers for upwards of thirty five years, and had\r\nentirely forgotten their contents.\r\n\r\nWithout troubling myself to transcribe the whole of this choice morsel\r\nof French Romance concerning the history of the “amiable twins”\r\nCunio,--the surprising beauty, talents, and accomplishments of the\r\nmaiden,--the early death of herself and her lover,--the heroism of the\r\nyouthful knight, Alexander Alberic Cunio, displayed when only fourteen\r\nyears old,--I shall give a brief abstract of some of the passages which\r\nseem most important to the present inquiry.[I-39]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-39: Readers of French romances will find the tale of\r\n    the Cunio at p. 89, tom. i. of Papillon’s “Traité de la Gravure en\r\n    Bois,” or at p. 17, vol. i. of Mr. Ottley’s “History of\r\n    Engraving.”]\r\n\r\nFrom this narrative,--which Papillon informs us was written in a much\r\nbetter hand, though also in Swiss characters, and with much blacker ink\r\nthan Turine the grandson’s own memorandum,--we obtain the following\r\nparticulars: The Count de Cunio, father of the twins, was married to\r\ntheir mother, a noble maiden of Verona and a relation of Pope Honorius\r\nIV. without the knowledge of their parents, who, on discovering what had\r\nhappened, caused the marriage to be annulled, and the priest by whom it\r\nwas celebrated to be banished. The divorced wife, dreading the anger of\r\nher own father, sought an asylum with one of her aunts, under whose roof\r\nshe was brought to bed of twins. Though the elder Cunio had compelled\r\nhis son to espouse another wife, he yet allowed him to educate the\r\ntwins, who were most affectionately received and cherished by their\r\nfather’s new wife. The children made astonishing progress in the\r\nsciences, more especially the girl Isabella, who at thirteen years of\r\nage was regarded as a prodigy; for she understood, and wrote with\r\ncorrectness, the Latin language; she composed excellent verses,\r\nunderstood geometry, was acquainted with music, could play on several\r\ninstruments, and had begun to design and to paint with correctness,\r\ntaste, and delicacy. Her brother Alberic, of a beauty as ravishing as\r\nhis sister’s, and one of the most charming youths in Italy, at the age\r\nof fourteen could manage the great horse, and understood the practice of\r\narms and all other exercises befitting a young man of quality. He also\r\nunderstood Latin, and could paint well.\r\n\r\nThe troubles in Italy having caused the Count Cunio to take up arms, his\r\nson, young Alexander Alberic, accompanied him to the field to make his\r\nfirst campaign. Though not more than fourteen years old, he was\r\nentrusted with the command of a squadron of twenty-five horse, with\r\nwhich, as his first essay in war, he attacked and put to flight near two\r\nhundred of the enemy. His courage having carried him too far, he was\r\nsurrounded by the fugitives, from whom, however, he fought himself clear\r\nwithout any further injury than a wound in his left arm. His father, who\r\nhad hastened to his succour, found him returning with the enemy’s\r\nbanner, which he had wrapped about his wound. Delighted at the valour\r\ndisplayed by his son, the Count Cunio knighted him on the spot. The\r\nyoung man then asked permission to visit his mother, which was readily\r\ngranted by the count, who was pleased to have this opportunity of\r\ntestifying the love and esteem he still retained towards that noble and\r\nafflicted lady, who continued to reside with her aunt; of which he\r\ncertainly would have given her more convincing proofs, now that his\r\nfather was dead, by re-establishing their marriage and publicly\r\nespousing her, if he had not been in duty bound to cherish the wife whom\r\nhe had been compelled to marry, and who had now borne him a large\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nAfter Alexander Alberic had visited his mother, he returned home, and\r\nshortly after began, together with his sister Isabella, to design and\r\nwork upon the pictures of the achievements of Alexander. He then made a\r\nsecond campaign with his father, after which he continued to employ\r\nhimself on the pictures in conjunction with Isabella, who attempted in\r\nreduce them and engrave them on wood. After the engravings were\r\nfinished, and copies had been printed and given to Pope Honorius, and\r\ntheir relations and friends, Alexander Alberic proceeded again to join\r\nthe army, accompanied by Pandulphio, a young nobleman, who was in love\r\nwith the charming Isabella. This was his last campaign, for he was\r\nkilled in the presence of his friend, who was dangerously wounded in\r\ndefending him. He was slain when not more than nineteen; and his sister\r\nwas so affected by his death that she resolved never to marry, and died\r\nwhen she was scarcely twenty. The death of this lovely and learned young\r\nlady was followed by that of her lover, who had fondly hoped that she\r\nwould make him happy. The mother of those amiable twins was not long in\r\nfollowing them to the grave, being unable to survive the loss of her\r\nchildren. The Countess de Cunio took seriously ill at the loss of\r\nIsabella, but fortunately recovered; and it was only the count’s\r\ngrandeur of soul that saved him from falling sick also.\r\n\r\nSome years after this, Count Cunio gave the copy of the achievements of\r\nAlexander, in its present binding, to the grandfather of the person who\r\ncaused this account to be written. The binding, according to Papillon’s\r\ndescription of it, was, for the period, little less remarkable than the\r\ncontents. “This ancient and Gothic binding,” as Papillon’s note is\r\ntranslated by Mr. Ottley. “is made of thin tablets of wood, covered with\r\nleather, and _ornamented with flowered compartments, which appear simply\r\nstamped and marked with an iron a little warmed, without any gilding_.”\r\nIt is remarkable that this singular volume should afford not only\r\nspecimens of wood engraving, earlier by upwards of a hundred and thirty\r\nyears than any which are hitherto known, but that the binding, of the\r\nsame period as the engravings, should also be such as is rarely, if\r\never, to be met with till upwards of one hundred and fifty years after\r\nthe wonderful twins were dead.\r\n\r\nAs this volume is no longer to be found, as no mention is made of such a\r\nwork by any old writer, and as another copy has not been discovered in\r\nany of the libraries of Italy, nor the least trace of one ever having\r\nbeen there, the evidence of its ever having existed rests solely on the\r\naccount given of it by Papillon. Before saying a word respecting the\r\ncredit to be attached to this witness, or the props with which Zani and\r\nOttley endeavour to support his testimony, I shall attempt to show that\r\nthe account affords internal evidence of its own falsehood.\r\n\r\nBefore noticing the description of the subjects, I shall state a few\r\nobjections to the account of the twins as written out by order of the\r\nyoungest Turine, the grandson of Jan. Jacq. Turine, who received the\r\nvolume from Count Cunio himself, the father of the twins, a few years\r\nafter their death, which could not well happen later than 1291; as Pope\r\nHonorius, to whom their work was dedicated when they were sixteen years\r\nold, died in 1287, and Isabella Cunio, who survived her brother, died\r\nwhen she was not more than twenty. Supposing that Count Cunio gave the\r\nvolume to his friend, J. J. Turine, a native of Berne, in 1300, and that\r\nthe grandson of the latter caused the history of the twins to be written\r\nout eighty years afterwards,--and we cannot fairly assume that it was\r\nwritten later, if indeed so late,--we have thus 1380 as the date of the\r\naccount written “in old Swiss characters, in a better hand, and with\r\nmuch blacker ink,” than the owner’s own memorandum of the manner in\r\nwhich the volume came into his family, and his reasons for prizing it so\r\nhighly. The probable date of the pretended Swiss history of the Cunio,\r\nPapillon’s advocates carefully keep out of sight; for what impartial\r\nperson could believe that a Swiss of the fourteenth century could give\r\nutterance to the sentimental fustian which forms so considerable a\r\nportion of the account? Of the young knight Cunio he knows every\r\nmovement; he is acquainted with his visit to his repudiated mother; he\r\nknows in which arm he was wounded; the number of men that he lost, when\r\nwith only five-and-twenty he routed two hundred; the name of Isabella’s\r\nlover; the illness and happy recovery of Count Cunio’s wife, and can\r\ntell the cause why the count himself did not fall sick.\r\n\r\nTo any person who reflects on the doctrine of the church of Rome in the\r\narticle of marriage, it certainly must appear strange that the parents\r\nof the Count Cunio and his first wife, the mother of the twins, should\r\nhave had the power of dissolving the marriage and of banishing the\r\npriest by whom it was solemnized; and still more singular it is that the\r\nCount Cunio, whom we must suppose to have been a good Catholic, should\r\nspeak, after his father’s death, of re-establishing his marriage with\r\nhis first wife and of publicly espousing her; and that he should make\r\nsuch a communication to her through the medium of her son, who, as well\r\nas his sister, must have been declared illegitimate by the very fact of\r\ntheir mother’s divorce. It is also strange that this piece of family\r\nhistory should come to the knowledge of the grandson of Jan. Jacq.\r\nTurine. The Count Cunio’s second marriage surely must have been\r\ncanonically legal, if the first were not; and if so, it would not be a\r\nsense of duty alone to his second wife that would prevent him divorcing\r\nher and re-marrying the first. On such subjects the church was to be\r\nconsulted; and to such playing fast-and-loose with the sacrament of\r\nmarriage the church said “NO.” Taking these circumstances into\r\nconsideration, I can come to no other conclusion than that, on this\r\npoint, the writer of the history of the Cunio did not speak truth; and\r\nthat the paper containing such history, even if it could be produced, is\r\nnot genuine, as every other part of it which has the slightest bearing\r\non the point at issue, is equally, if not more, improbable.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the cuts pretended to be executed by the twins\r\nthemselves, I shall waive any objections which might be urged on the\r\nground of it being unlikely that they should be executed by a boy and a\r\ngirl so young. Supposing that the twins were as learned and accomplished\r\nas they are represented, still it would be a very surprising\r\ncircumstance that, in the thirteenth century, they should have executed\r\na series of wood engravings of the actions of Alexander the Great as an\r\nappropriate present to the pope; and that the composition of one of\r\nthose subjects, No. 7, should so closely resemble one of Le Brun’s--an\r\nartist remarkable for the complication of his designs--that it would\r\nseem he had copied this very print. Something like the reverse of this\r\nis more probable; that the description of the pretended work of the\r\nCunio was suggested by the designs of Le Brun.[I-40] The execution of a\r\nset of designs, in the thirteenth century, illustrating the actions of\r\nAlexander in the manner described by Papillon, would be a rarity indeed\r\neven if not engraved on wood; but that a series of wood engravings, and\r\nnot a saint in one of them, should be executed by a boy and a girl, and\r\npresented to a _pope_, in 1286, is scarcely short of miraculous. The\r\ntwins must have been well read in Quintus Curtius. Though we are\r\ninformed that both were skilled in the Latin language, yet it plainly\r\nappears on two occasions, when we might suppose that they would be least\r\nliable to trip, that their Latinity is questionable. The sixth and the\r\neighth subjects, which were accomplished by their joint efforts, are\r\ndescribed as being marked: _Alex. Alb. Equ. et Isabel, Cunio pictor. et\r\nscalp._\r\n\r\n  “Thus painters _did not_ write their names at Co.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-40: Of Le Brun’s five subjects illustrative of the\r\n    actions of Alexander the Great, four of them are precisely the\r\n    same as four of those said to be executed by the Cunio:\r\n    1. Alexander passing the Granicus; 2. the battle of Arbela; 3. the\r\n    reception of Porus by Alexander; 4. Alexander’s triumphant entry\r\n    into Babylon. There certainly has been some copying here; but it\r\n    is more likely that Papillon or his informant had seen Le Brun’s\r\n    paintings, than that Le Brun had seen the original wood engravings\r\n    executed by the Cunio.]\r\n\r\nWhy do not the advocates of those early specimens of wood engraving in\r\nItaly point out to their readers that these two children were the first\r\nwho ever affixed the words _pinx. et scalp._ to a woodcut? I challenge\r\nany believer in Papillon to point out a wood engraving on which the\r\nwords _pinxit_ and _scalpsit_, the first after the painter’s name, and\r\nthe second after the engraver’s, appear previous to 1580. This apparent\r\ncopying--and by a person ignorant of Latin too--of the formula of a\r\nlater period, is of itself sufficient to excite a suspicion of forgery;\r\nand, coupled with the improbable circumstances above related, it\r\nirresistibly compels me to conclude that the whole account is a mere\r\nfiction.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the credibility of Papillon, the sole evidence upon\r\nwhich the history of the wonderful twins rests, I shall have occasion to\r\nsay very few words. That he was credulous, and excessively vain of what\r\nhe considered his discoveries in the history of wood engraving, is\r\nadmitted by those who profess to believe him. He appears also from an\r\nearly age to have been subject to mental hallucination; and in 1759, the\r\nyear after he found his papers containing the account of the Cunio, he\r\nhad a fit of decided insanity which rendered it necessary to convey him\r\nto a mad-house, where by copious bleeding he soon recovered his\r\nsenses.[I-41] To those interested in the controversy I leave to decide\r\nhow far the unsupported testimony of such a person, and in such a case,\r\nought to be relied on. How easily he might be deceived on a subject\r\nrelating to the early history of his art, it is not difficult to\r\ncomprehend; and even allowing him to be sincere in the belief of what he\r\nrelated, he was a person very likely to occasionally deceive both\r\nhimself and others.[I-42]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-41: From the age of sixteen, cruel and secret\r\n    annoyances interrupted his studies; shortly after his marriage, in\r\n    1723, his absent manner was a source of uneasiness to his wife;\r\n    and in 1759 he fairly lost his senses. See Papillon, Traité de la\r\n    Gravure en Bois, 8vo. 1766, Preface, p. xi.; & p. 335, tom. i. et\r\n    Supplement, p. 39.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-42: It is worthy of remark that Papillon, when\r\n    questioned by Heineken, who called on him in Paris after the\r\n    publication of his work, respecting the account of the Cunio, did\r\n    not produce his three sheets of original memoranda. He might thus\r\n    have afforded a proof of his own good faith, by producing the\r\n    manuscript written by him in 1720 from the dictation of Captain de\r\n    Greder.]\r\n\r\nPapillon’s insanity had been previously adverted to by Heineken; and\r\nthis writer’s remarks have produced the following correction from Mr.\r\nOttley: “Heineken takes some pains to show that poor Papillon was not in\r\nhis right mind; and, amongst his other arguments, quotes a passage from\r\nhis book, t. i. p. 335, in which he says, ‘_Par un accident et une\r\nfatalité commune à plusieurs graveurs, aussi bien qu’à moi, Le Fevre est\r\ndevenu aliéné d’esprit_:’ as if a little pleasantry of expression, such\r\nas the French writers, especially, have ever felt themselves at full\r\nliberty to indulge in, could really constitute fit grounds for a statute\r\nof lunacy.”[I-43] Had Mr. Ottley, instead of confidently correcting\r\nHeineken when the latter had stated nothing but the fact, turned to the\r\ncited page of Papillon’s volume, he would there have found that Papillon\r\nwas indulging in no “little pleasantry of expression,” but was seriously\r\nrelating a melancholy fact of two brother artists losing their senses\r\nabout the same time as himself; and had he ever read the supplement, or\r\nthird volume, of Papillon’s work, he would have seen, at p. 39, the\r\naccount which Papillon himself gives of his own insanity.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-43: Inquiry into the Early History of Engraving, vol.\r\n    i. p. 23.]\r\n\r\nHaving disposed of the story as told by Papillon, it remains now to\r\nnotice “the learning and deep research” with which it has been supported\r\nby Zani, and some of the arguments which have been alleged in its favour\r\nby Mr. Ottley.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, Zani has discovered that a family of the name of\r\nCunio, in which the name of Alberico more than once occurs, actually\r\nresided in the neighbourhood of Ravenna at the very period mentioned in\r\nthe title-page to the cuts by the Cunio, and in the history written in\r\nold Swiss characters. Upon this, and other similar pieces of evidence,\r\nMr. Ottley remarks as follows: “Now both these cities [Ravenna and\r\nImola] are in the vicinity of Faenza, where the family, or a branch of\r\nit, is spoken of by writers of undoubted credit in the twelfth, the\r\nthirteenth, and the fourteenth centuries. These circumstances,\r\ntherefore, far from furnishing any just motive of additional doubt, form\r\ntogether such a phalanx of corroborative evidence in support of the\r\nstory, as, in my opinion, those who would impeach the truth of\r\nPapillon’s statement can never break through.” “_Argal_,” Rowley’s poems\r\nare genuine, because such a person as “Maistre William Canynge” lived at\r\nBristol at the period when he is mentioned by the pseudo Rowley. Zani,\r\nhowever, unfortunately for his own argument, let us know that the names\r\nand residence of the family of the Cunio might be obtained from\r\n“Tonduzzi’s History of Faenza,” printed in 1675. Whether this book\r\nappeared in French, or not, previous to the publication of Papillon’s\r\nworks, I have not been able to learn; but a Swiss captain, who could\r\nread “old Gothic Italian,” would certainly find little difficulty in\r\npicking a couple of names out of a modern Italian volume.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning faculties of Signor Zani appear to have been very\r\nimperfectly developed, for he cites the following as a case in point;\r\nand Mr. Ottley, who gives it in his text, seems to concur in its\r\napplicability. He is noticing the objections which have been made to\r\nPapillon’s account, on the ground of no previous author mentioning the\r\nexistence of such a work, and that no person subsequently had ever seen\r\na copy. Zani’s argument, as given by Mr. Ottley,[I-44] is as follows:\r\n“He, however, who should reason in this manner, might, upon the same\r\ngrounds, deny the loss of many manuscripts, and even of printed books,\r\nwhich, according to the testimony of credible authors, have become a\r\nprey to the flames, or have perished during the anarchy of revolutions,\r\nor the distresses occasioned by wars. The learned part of my readers\r\nwill not require examples. Nevertheless, let him who wants such\r\nconviction search throughout all the libraries of Europe for the work\r\nentitled ‘Meditationes Reverendissimi patris Domini Johannis de\r\nTurre-cremata,’ printed at Rome by Ulrich Hahn, in 1467, and he will\r\npresently be informed by the learned librarians, that of that edition\r\nthere exists but one copy, which is preserved in the library of\r\nNuremberg. This book is, therefore, unique.[I-45] Now let us suppose\r\nthat, by some accident, this book should perish; could our descendants\r\non that account deny that it ever had existed?” And this is a\r\ncorroborative argument in support of the truth of Papillon’s tale! The\r\ncomment, however, is worthy of the text. It is to be observed that\r\nUlrich Hahn’s edition of Turre-cremata appeared ten years after Faust\r\nand Scheffer’s Psalter, of the date 1457, was printed; and that the\r\nexistence of several hundred volumes printed before 1467 proves that the\r\nart of printing was then practised to a considerable extent. That Ulrich\r\nHahn was a printer at Rome in 1468 and subsequent years is proved by\r\nmany copies of works which proceeded from his press; and the existence\r\nof the identical “unique” copy, referred to by Zani, is vouched for by\r\nupwards of fifty learned men who have seen it; and, what is more,\r\nmentioned the place where it was preserved, so that, if a person were\r\nsceptical, he might satisfy himself by the evidence of his own senses.\r\nBut who, except Papillon, has ever seen the engravings of the Cunio,\r\nexecuted upwards of a hundred and thirty years prior to the earliest\r\nauthentic specimen of the art, and who has ever mentioned the place\r\nwhere they were to be seen? Had any person of equal credibility with\r\nPapillon described a volume printed at Rome in 1285, the date of the\r\npretended wood-cuts of the Cunio, the case would then have been in\r\npoint, and the decision of every person in the slightest degree\r\nacquainted with the subject, and not rendered blind to simple truth by\r\nthe vivid brightness of his own speculations, would be inevitably the\r\nsame; that is, the evidence in both cases would not be relied on.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-44: History of Engraving, vol. i. p. 28.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote I-45: Three copies of this supposed unique book have\r\n    long been known to bibliographers; one in the public library of\r\n    Nuremberg, another in the Imperial library of Vienna, and the\r\n    third in Lord Spenser’s library.]\r\n\r\n“It is possible,” says Zani, “that at this moment I may be blinded by\r\npartiality to my own nation; but I would almost assert, that _to deny\r\nthe testimony of the French writer, would be like denying the existence\r\nof light on a fine sun-shiny day_.” His mental optics must have been of\r\na peculiar character, and it can be no longer doubtful that he\r\n\r\n  “Had lights where better eyes are blind,\r\n  As pigs are said to see the wind.”\r\n\r\nMr. Ottley’s own arguments in support of Papillon’s story are scarcely\r\nof a higher character than those which he has adopted from Zani. At page\r\n40, in answer to an objection founded on the silence of all authorities,\r\nnot merely respecting the particular work of the Cunio, but of the\r\nfrequent practice of such an art, and the fact of no contemporary\r\nspecimens being known, he writes as follows: “We cannot safely argue\r\nfrom the silence of contemporaneous authorities, that the art of\r\nengraving on wood was not practised in Europe in those early times;\r\nhowever, such silence may be an argument that it was not an art in high\r\nrepute. Nor is our ignorance of such records a sufficient proof of their\r\nnon-existence.” The proof of such a negative would be certainly\r\ndifficult; but, according to this mode of argument, there is no modern\r\ninvention which might not also be mentioned in “certain ancient\r\nundiscovered records.” In the general business of life, that rule of\r\nevidence is a good one which declares “_de non-apparentibus et\r\nnon-existentibus eadem est ratio_;” and until it shall be a maxim in\r\nlogic that “we ought readily to believe that to be true which we cannot\r\nprove to have been impossible,” Mr. Ottley’s solution of the difficulty\r\ndoes not seem likely to obtain general credence.\r\n\r\nAt page 41, speaking of the probability of wood-engraving, for the\r\npurpose of taking impressions, being practised at an earlier period than\r\nhas been generally supposed, Mr. Ottley expresses himself as follows:\r\n“Nor is it any proof or strong argument against the antiquity of such a\r\npractice, that authentic specimens of wood-engraving of those early\r\ntimes are not now to be found. They were, it may be supposed, for the\r\nmost part, detached pieces, whose merits, as works of art, were not such\r\nas to render their preservation at all probable. They were the toys of\r\nthe day; and, after having served the temporary purpose for which they\r\nwere manufactured, were, no doubt, swept away to make room for others of\r\nnewer fashion.” He thus requires those who entertain an opinion contrary\r\nto his own to prove a negative; while he assumes the point in dispute as\r\nmost clearly established in his own favour.\r\n\r\nIf such wood engravings--“the toys of the day”--had been known in the\r\nthirteenth, or even the fourteenth century, is it not likely that some\r\nmention would be made of them in the writings of some one of the\r\nminstrels of the period to whom we are indebted for so many minute\r\nparticulars illustrative of the state of society at the period referred\r\nto? Not the slightest allusion to anything of the kind has hitherto been\r\nnoticed in their writings. Respecting such “toys” Boccaccio is silent,\r\nand our countryman Chaucer says not a word. Of wood-cuts not the least\r\nmention is made in Petrarch; and Richard de Bury, bishop of Durham, who\r\nlived in the reign of Edward III., in his curious Essay on the Love of\r\nBooks, says not a syllable of wood-cuts, either as toys, or as\r\nillustrations of devotional or historical subjects. Upon this question,\r\naffirmed by Papillon, and maintained as true by Zani and Ottley,\r\ncontemporary authorities are silent; and not one solitary fact bearing\r\ndistinctly upon the point has been alleged in support of Papillon’s\r\nnarrative.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF WOOD ENGRAVING.\r\n\r\n  Playing-Cards Printed from Wood-Blocks -- Early German\r\n  Wood-Engravers at Augsburg, Nuremberg, and Ulm -- Card-Makers and\r\n  Wood-Engravers in Venice in 1441 -- Figures of Saints Engraved on\r\n  Wood -- The St. Christopher, the Annunciation, and the St. Bridget\r\n  in the Collection of Earl Spencer, with Other Old Wood-Cuts\r\n  Described -- Block-Books -- The Apocalypse, the History of the\r\n  Virgin, and the Work Called Biblia Pauperum -- Speculum Salvationis\r\n  -- Figured Alphabet Formerly Belonging to Sir George Beaumont -- Ars\r\n  Memorandi, and Other Smaller Block-Books.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the facts which have been produced in the preceding chapter, there\r\ncannot be a doubt that the principle on which wood engraving is\r\nfounded,--that of taking impressions on paper or parchment, with ink,\r\nfrom prominent lines,--was known and practised in attesting documents in\r\nthe thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Towards the end of the\r\nfourteenth, or about the beginning of the fifteenth century, there is\r\nreason to believe that this principle was adopted by the German\r\ncard-makers for the purpose of marking the outlines of the figures on\r\ntheir cards, which they afterwards coloured by means of a stencil.[II-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-1: A stencil is a piece of pasteboard, or a thin\r\n    plate of metal, pierced with lines and figures, which are\r\n    communicated to paper, parchment, or linen, by passing a brush\r\n    charged with ink or colour over the stencil.]\r\n\r\nThe period at which the game of cards was first known in Europe, as well\r\nas the people by whom they were invented, has been very learnedly,\r\nthough not very satisfactorily discussed. Bullet has claimed the\r\ninvention for the French, and Heineken for the Germans; while other\r\nwriters have maintained that the game was known in Italy earlier than in\r\nany other part of Europe, and that it was introduced from the East.\r\n\r\nFrom a passage discovered by M. Van Praet, in an old manuscript copy of\r\nthe romance of _Renard le Contrefait_, it appears that cards were known\r\nin France about 1340, although Bullet was of opinion that they were\r\ninvented in that country about 1376. At whatever period the game was\r\nintroduced, it appears to have been commonly known in France and Spain\r\ntowards the latter part of the fourteenth century. John I., King of\r\nCastile, by an edict issued in 1387, prohibited the game of cards; and\r\nin 1397, the Provost of Paris, by an ordonnance, forbid all working\r\npeople to play at tennis, bowls, dice, _cards_, or nine-pins, on working\r\ndays. From a passage in the Chronicle of Petit-Jehan de Saintré, written\r\nprevious to 1380, it would appear that the game of cards at that period\r\nwas in disrepute. Saintré had been one of the pages of Charles V. of\r\nFrance; and on his being appointed, on account of his good conduct, to\r\nthe situation of carver to the king, the squire who had charge of the\r\npages, lectured some of them on the impropriety of their behaviour; such\r\nas playing at dice and cards, keeping bad company, and haunting taverns\r\nand cabarets, those not being the courses by which they might hope to\r\narrive at the honourable post of “ecuyer tranchant,” to which their\r\ncompanion, Saintré, had been raised.\r\n\r\nIn an account-book of Charles Poupart, treasurer to Charles VI. of\r\nFrance, there is an entry, made about 1393, of “fifty-six sols of Paris,\r\ngiven to Jacquemin Gringonneur, painter, for three packs of cards, gilt\r\nand coloured, and of different sorts, for the diversion of his majesty.”\r\nFrom this passage the learned Jesuit Menestrier, who was not aware of\r\ncards being mentioned by any earlier writer, concluded that they were\r\nthen invented by Gringonneur to amuse the king, who, in consequence of a\r\n_coup de soleil_, had been attacked with delirium, which had subsided\r\ninto an almost continual depression of spirits. There, however, can be\r\nno doubt that cards were known in France at least fifty years before;\r\nthough, from their being so seldom noticed previous to 1380, it appears\r\nlikely that the game was but little played until after that period.\r\nWhether the figures on the cards supplied for the king’s amusement were\r\ndrawn and coloured by the hand, or whether the outlines were impressed\r\nfrom wood-blocks, and coloured by means of a stencil, it is impossible\r\nto ascertain; though it has been conjectured that, from the smallness of\r\nthe sum paid for them, they were of the latter description. That cards\r\nwere cheap in 1397, however they might be manufactured, may be presumed\r\nfrom the fact of their being then in the hands of the working people.\r\n\r\nTo whatever nation the invention of cards is owing, it appears that the\r\nGermans were the first who practised card-making as a trade. In 1418 the\r\nname of a “Kartenmacher”--card-maker--occurs in the burgess-book of the\r\ncity of Augsburg; and in an old rate-book of the city of Nuremburg,\r\nunder the year 1433, we find “_Ell. Kartenmacherin_;” that is,\r\nEll.--probably for Elizabeth--the card-maker. In the same book, under\r\nthe year 1435, the name of “_Eliz. Kartenmacherin_,” probably the same\r\nperson, is to be found; and in 1438 there occurs the name “Margret\r\nKartenmalerin”--Margaret the card-painter. It thus appears that the\r\nearliest card-makers who are mentioned as living at Nuremberg were\r\nfemales; and it is worthy of note that the Germans seem to have called\r\ncards “_Karten_” before they gave them the name of “_Briefe_.” Heineken,\r\nhowever, considers that they were first known in Germany by the latter\r\nname; for, as he claimed the invention for his countrymen, he was\r\nunwilling to admit that the name should be borrowed either from Italy or\r\nFrance. He has not, however, produced anything like proof in support of\r\nhis opinion, which is contradicted by the negative evidence of\r\nhistory.[II-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-2: Cards--_Carten_--are mentioned in a book of\r\n    bye-laws of Nuremberg, between 1380 and 1384. They are included in\r\n    a list of games at which the burghers might indulge themselves,\r\n    provided they ventured only small sums. “Awzgenommen rennen mit\r\n    Pferder, Schiessen mit Armbrusten, _Carten_, Schofzagel, Pretspil,\r\n    und Kugeln, umb einen pfenink zwen zu vier poten.” That is:\r\n    “always excepting horse-racing, shooting with cross-bows, _cards_,\r\n    shovel-board, tric-trac, and bowls, at which a man may bet from\r\n    twopence to a groat.”--C. G. Von Murr, Journal zur Kunstsgesch.\r\n    2 Theil, S. 99.]\r\n\r\nThe name _Briefe_, which the Germans give to cards, also signifies\r\nletters [epistolæ]. The meaning of the word, however, is rather more\r\ngeneral than the French term _lettres_, or the Latin _epistolæ_ which he\r\ngives as its synonyms, for it is also applied in the sense in which we\r\nsometimes use the word “paper.” For instance, “_ein Brief Stecknadeln,\r\nein Brief Tabak_,” are literally translated by the words “a _paper_ of\r\npins, a _paper_ of tobacco;” in which sense the word “_Brief_” would, in\r\nLatin, be more correctly rendered by the term _charta_ than _epistola_.\r\nAs it is in a similar sense--cognate with “paper,” as used in the two\r\npreceding examples--that “Briefe” is applied to cards, I am inclined to\r\nconsider it as a translation of the Latin _chartaæ_, the Italian\r\n_carte_, or the French _cartes_, and hence to conclude that the\r\ninvention of cards does not belong to the people of Germany, who appear\r\nto have received cards, both “name and thing,” from another nation, and\r\nafter some time to have given them a name in their own language.\r\n\r\nIn the town-books of Nuremberg, the term _Formschneider_--\r\nfigure-cutter,--the name appropriated to engravers on wood, first occurs\r\nin 1449;[II-3] and as it is found in subsequent years mentioned in the\r\nsame page with “Kartenmaler,” it seems reasonable to conclude that in\r\n1449, and probably earlier, the business of the wood-engraver proper,\r\nand that of the card-maker, were distinct. The primary meaning of the\r\nword _form_ or _forma_ is almost precisely the same in most of the\r\nEuropean languages. It has erroneously been explained, in its relation\r\nto wood engraving, as signifying a _mould_, whereas it simply means a\r\nshape or figure. The model of wood which the carpenter makes for the\r\nmetal-founder is properly a _form_, and from it the latter prepares his\r\nmould in the sand. The word _form_, however, in course of time declined\r\nfrom its primary signification, and came to be used as expressive both\r\nof a model and a mould. The term _Formschneider_, which was originally\r\nused to distinguish the professed engraver of figures from the mere\r\nengraver and colourer of cards, is still used in Germany to denote what\r\nwe term a wood-engraver.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-3: In the town-books of Nuremberg a Hans\r\n    _Formansneider_ occurs so early as 1397, which De Murr says is not\r\n    meant for “wood engraver,” but is to be read thus: _Hans Forman,\r\n    Schneider_; that is, “Ihon Forman, maister-fashionere,” or, in\r\n    modern phrase, “tailor.” The word “_Karter_” also occurs in the\r\n    same year, but it is meant for a carder, or wool-comber, and not\r\n    for a card-maker.--C. G. Von Murr, Journal, 2 Theil, S. 99.]\r\n\r\nAbout the time that the term _Formschneider_ first occurs we find\r\n_Briefmalers_ mentioned, and at a later period _Briefdruckers_--\r\ncard-printers; and, though there evidently was a distinction between\r\nthe two professions, yet we find that between 1470 and 1500 the\r\n_Briefmalers_ not only engraved figures occasionally, but also printed\r\nbooks. The _Formschneiders_ and the _Briefmalers_, however, continued\r\nto form but one guild or fellowship till long after the art of\r\nwood-engraving had made rapid strides towards perfection, under the\r\nsuperintendence of such masters as Durer, Burgmair, and Holbein, in the\r\nsame manner as the barbers and surgeons in our own country continued to\r\nform but one company, though the “chirurgeon had long ceased to trim\r\nbeards and cut hair, and the barber had given up bleeding and purging to\r\ndevote himself more exclusively to the ornamental branch of his original\r\nprofession.” “_Kartenmacher_ and _Kartenmaler_” says Von Murr, “or\r\n_Briefmaler_, as they were afterwards called [1473], were known in\r\nGermany eighty years previous to the invention of book-printing. The\r\nKartenmacher was originally a Formschneider, though, after the practice\r\nof cutting figures of saints and of sacred subjects was introduced,\r\na distinction began to be established between the two professions.”\r\n\r\nThe German card-makers of Augsburg, Nuremberg, and Ulm, it is stated,\r\nsent large quantities of cards into Italy; and it was probably against\r\nthose foreign manufacturers that the fellowship of painters at Venice\r\nobtained an order in 1441 from the magistracy, declaring that no foreign\r\nmanufactured cards, or printed coloured figures, should be brought into\r\nthe city, under the penalty of forfeiting such articles, and of being\r\nfined xxx liv. xii soldi. This order was made in consequence of a\r\npetition presented by the Venetian painters, wherein they set forth that\r\n“the art and mystery of card-making and of printing figures, which were\r\npractised in Venice, had fallen into total decay through the great\r\nquantity of foreign playing-cards and coloured printed figures, which\r\nwere brought into the city.”[II-4] It is hence evident that the art both\r\nof the German _Kartenmacher_ and of the _Formschneider_ was practised in\r\nVenice in 1441; and, as it is then mentioned as being in decay, it no\r\ndoubt was practised there some time previously.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-4: “Conscioscia che l’arte e mestier delle carte &\r\n    figure stampide, che se fano in Venesia è vegnudo a total\r\n    deffaction, e questo sia per la gran quantità de carte a zugar,\r\n    e fegure depente stampide, le qual vien fate de fuora de Venezia.”\r\n    The curious document in which the above passage occurs was\r\n    discovered by Temanza, an Italian architect, in an old book of\r\n    rules and orders belonging to the company of Venetian painters.\r\n    His discovery, communicated in a letter to Count Algarotti,\r\n    appeared in the Lettere Pittoriche, tom. v. p. 320, et sequent.\r\n    and has since been quoted by every writer who has written upon the\r\n    subject.]\r\n\r\nHeineken, in his “Neue Nachrichten,” gives an extract from a MS.\r\nchronicle of the city of Ulm, completed in 1474, to the following\r\neffect: “Playing-cards were sent _barrelwise_ [that is, in small casks]\r\ninto Italy, Sicily, and also over sea, and exchanged for spices and\r\nother wares. From this we may judge of the number of card-makers who\r\nresided here.” The preceding passage occurs in the index, under the\r\nhead, “Business of card-making.” Heineken also gives the passage in his\r\n“Idée Générale,” p. 245; but from the French translation, which he there\r\ngives, it appears that he had misunderstood the word “_leglenweiss_”--\r\nbarrelwise--which he renders “en ballots.” In his “Neue Nachrichten,”\r\nhowever, he inserts the explanation between parentheses, (“das ist, in\r\nkleinen Fässern”)--i. e. in small casks; which Mr. Singer renders\r\n“hogsheads,” and Mr. Ottley, though he gives the original in a note,\r\n“large bales.” The word “lägel,” a barrel, is obsolete in Germany, but\r\nits diminutive, “leglin,”--as if “lägelen”--is still used in Scotland\r\nfor the name of the ewe-milker’s _kit_.\r\n\r\nSome writers have been of opinion that the art of wood-engraving was\r\nderived from the practice of the ancient caligraphists and illuminators\r\nof manuscripts, who sometimes formed their large capital letters by\r\nmeans of a stencil or of a wooden stamp. That large capitals were formed\r\nin such a manner previous to the year 1400 there can be little doubt;\r\nand it has been thought that stencils and stamps were used not only for\r\nthe formation of capital letters, but also for the impression of a whole\r\nvolume. Ihre, in a dissertation on the Gospels of Ulphilas,[II-5] which\r\nare supposed to be as old as the fifth century, has asserted that the\r\nsilver letters of the text on a purple ground were impressed by means of\r\nheated iron stamps. This, however, is denied by the learned compilers of\r\nthe “Nouveau Traité de Diplomatique,” who had seen other volumes of a\r\nsimilar kind, the silver letters of which were evidently formed with a\r\npen. A modern Italian author, D. Vincenzo Requeno, has published a\r\ntract[II-6] to prove that many supposed manuscripts from the tenth to\r\nthe fourteenth century, instead of being written with a pen, were\r\nactually impressed by means of stamps. It is, however, extremely\r\nprobable that he is mistaken; for if his pretended discoveries were\r\ntrue, this art of stamping must have been very generally practised; and\r\nif so, it surely would have been mentioned by some contemporary writers.\r\nSignor Requeno’s examination, I am inclined to suspect, has not been\r\nsufficiently precise; for he seems to have been too willing to find what\r\nhe sought. In almost every collection that he examined, a pair of fine\r\ncompasses being the test which he employed, he discovered voluminous\r\nworks on vellum, hitherto supposed to be manuscript, but which according\r\nto his measurement were certainly executed by means of a stamp.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-5: This celebrated version, in the Mœso-Gothic\r\n    language, is preserved in the library of Upsal in Sweden.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-6: Osservazioni sulla Chirotipografia, ossia Antica\r\n    Arte di Stampare a mano. Opera di D. Vincenzo Requeno. Roma 1810,\r\n    8vo.]\r\n\r\nIt has been conjectured that the art of wood-engraving was employed on\r\nsacred subjects, such as the figures of saints and holy persons, before\r\nit was applied to the multiplication of those “books of Satan,”\r\nplaying-cards. It however is not unlikely that it was first employed in\r\nthe manufacture of cards; and that the monks, availing themselves of the\r\nsame principle, shortly afterwards employed the art of wood-engraving\r\nfor the purpose of circulating the figures of saints; thus endeavouring\r\nto supply a remedy for the evil, and extracting from the serpent a cure\r\nfor his bite.\r\n\r\nWood-cuts of sacred subjects were known to the common people of Suabia,\r\nand the adjacent districts, by the name of _Helgen_ or _Helglein_, a\r\ncorruption of Heiligen, saints;--a word which in course of time they\r\nused to signify prints--_estampes_--generally.[II-7] In France the same\r\nkind of cuts, probably stencil-coloured, were called “dominos,”--the\r\naffinity of which name with the German Helgen is obvious. The word\r\n“domino” was subsequently used as a name for coloured or marbled paper\r\ngenerally, and the makers of such paper, as well as the engravers and\r\ncolourers of wood-cuts, were called “dominotiers.”[II-8]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-7: Fuseli, at p. 85 of Ottley’s Inquiry; and\r\n    Breitkopf, Versuch d. Ursprungs der Spielkarten Zu erforschen,\r\n    2 Theil, S. 175.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-8: Fournier, Dissertation sur l’Origine et les\r\n    Progrès de l’Art de Graver en Bois, p. 79; and Papillon, Traité de\r\n    la Gravure en Bois, tom. i. p. 20, and Supplement, p. 80.]\r\n\r\nAs might, _à priori_, be concluded, supposing the Germans to have been\r\nthe first who applied wood-engraving to card-making, the earliest\r\nwood-cuts have been discovered, and in the greatest abundance, in that\r\ndistrict where we first hear of the business of a card-maker and a\r\nwood-engraver. From a convent, situated within fifty miles of the city\r\nof Augsberg, where, in 1418, the first mention of a Kartenmacher occurs,\r\nhas been obtained the earliest wood-cut known,--the St. Christopher, now\r\nin the possession of Earl Spencer, with the date 1423. That this was the\r\nfirst cut of the kind we have no reason to suppose; but though others\r\nexecuted in a similar manner are known, to not one of them, upon\r\nanything like probable grounds, can a higher degree of antiquity be\r\nassigned. From 1423, therefore, as from a known epoch, the practice of\r\nwood engraving, as applied to pictorial representations, may be dated.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe first person who published an account of this most interesting\r\nwood-cut was Heineken, who had inspected a greater number of old\r\nwood-cuts and block-books than any other person, and whose unwearied\r\nperseverance in searching after, and general accuracy in describing such\r\nearly specimens of the art of wood-engraving, are beyond all praise. He\r\nfound it pasted on the inside of the right-hand cover of a manuscript\r\nvolume in the library of the convent of Buxheim, near Memmingen in\r\nSuabia. The manuscript, entitled LAUS VIRGINIS[II-9] and finished in\r\n1417, was left to the convent by Anna, canoness of Buchaw, who was\r\nliving in 1427; but who probably died previous to 1435. The above\r\nreduced copy conveys a pretty good idea of the composition and style of\r\nengraving of the original cut, which is of a folio size, being eleven\r\nand a quarter inches high, and eight inches and one-eighth wide.[II-10]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-9: “Liber iste, _Laus Virginis_ intitulatus, continet\r\n    Lectiones Matutinales accommodatas Officio B. V. Mariæ per\r\n    singulos anni dies,” &c. At the beginning of the volume is the\r\n    following memorandum: “Istum librum legavit domna Anna filia domni\r\n    Stephani baronis de Gundelfingen, canonica in Büchow Aule bte.\r\n    Marie v’ginis in Buchshaim ord’is Cartusieñ prope Memingen\r\n    Augusten. dyoc.”--Von Murr, Journal, 2 Theil, S. 104-105.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-10: A fac-simile, of the size of the original, is\r\n    given in Von Murr’s Journal, vol. ii. p. 104, and in Ottley’s\r\n    Inquiry, vol. i. p. 90, both engraved on wood. There is an\r\n    imitation engraved on copper, in Jansen’s Essai sur l’Origine de\r\n    la Gravure, tom. i.]\r\n\r\nThe original affords a specimen of the combined talents of the\r\nFormschneider or wood-engraver, and the Briefmaler or card-colourer. The\r\nengraved portions, such as are here represented, have been taken off in\r\ndark colouring matter similar to printers’ ink, after which the\r\nimpression appears to have been coloured by means of a stencil. As the\r\nback of the cut cannot be seen, in consequence of its being pasted on\r\nthe cover of the volume, it cannot be ascertained with any degree of\r\ncertainty whether the impression has been taken by means of a press, or\r\n_rubbed off_ from the block by means of a burnisher or rubber, in a\r\nmanner similar to that in which wood-engravers of the present day take\r\ntheir proofs.\r\n\r\nThis cut is much better designed than the generality of those which we\r\nfind in books typographically executed from 1462, the date of the\r\nBamberg Fables, to 1493, when the often-cited Nuremberg Chronicle was\r\nprinted. Amongst the many coarse cuts which “illustrate” the latter, and\r\nwhich are announced in the book itself[II-11] as having been “got up”\r\nunder the superintendence of Michael Wolgemuth, Albert Durer’s master,\r\nand William Pleydenwurff, both “most skilful in the art of painting,”\r\nI cannot find a single subject which either for spirit or feeling can be\r\ncompared to the St. Christopher. In fact, the figure of the saint, and\r\nthat of the youthful Christ whom he bears on his shoulders, are, with\r\nthe exception of the extremities, designed in such a style, that they\r\nwould scarcely discredit Albert Durer himself.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-11: The following announcement appears in the\r\n    colophon of the Nuremberg Chronicle. “Ad intuitum autem et preces\r\n    providorum civium Sebaldi Schreyer et Sebastiani Romermaister hunc\r\n    librum Anthonius Koberger Nurembergiæ impressit. Adhibitis tamen\r\n    viris mathematicis pingendique arte peritissimis, Michaele\r\n    Wolgemut et Wilhelmo Pleydenwurff, quorum solerti accuratissimaque\r\n    animadversione tum civitatum tum illustrium virorum figuræ insertæ\r\n    sunt. Consummatum autem duodecima mensis Julii. Anno Salutis ñre\r\n    1493.”]\r\n\r\nTo the left of the engraving the artist has introduced, with a noble\r\ndisregard of perspective,[II-12] what Bewick would have called a “bit of\r\nNature.” In the foreground a figure is seen driving an ass loaded with a\r\nsack towards a water-mill; while by a steep path a figure, perhaps\r\nintended for the miller, is seen carrying a full sack from the back-door\r\nof the mill towards a cottage. To the right is seen a hermit--known by\r\nthe bell over the entrance of his dwelling--holding a large lantern to\r\ndirect St. Christopher as he crosses the stream. The two verses at the\r\nfoot of the cut,\r\n\r\n  Cristofori faciem die quacunque tueris,\r\n  Illa nempe die morte mala non morieris,\r\n\r\nmay be translated as follows:\r\n\r\n  Each day that thou the likeness of St. Christopher shalt see,\r\n  That day no frightful form of death shall make an end of thee.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-12: As great a neglect of the rules of perspective\r\n    may be seen in several of the cuts in the famed edition of\r\n    Theurdanck, Nuremberg, 1517, which are supposed to have been\r\n    designed by Hans Burgmair, and engraved by Hans Schaufflein.]\r\n\r\nThey allude to a popular superstition, common at that period in all\r\nCatholic countries, which induced people to believe that the day on\r\nwhich they should see a figure or image of St. Christopher, they should\r\nnot meet with a violent death, nor die without confession.[II-13] To\r\nthis popular superstition Erasmus alludes in his “Praise of Folly;” and\r\nit is not unlikely, that to his faith in this article of belief, the\r\nsquire, in Chaucer’s “Canterbury Tales,” wore\r\n\r\n  “A Christofre on his brest, of silver shene.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-13: See Brand’s Popular Antiquities, vol. i. pp.\r\n    359-364.--Bohn’s edition.]\r\n\r\nThe date “_Millesimo cccc^o xx^o tercio_”--1423--which is seen at the\r\nright-hand corner, at the foot of the impression, most undoubtedly\r\ndesignates the year in which the engraving was made.\r\n\r\nThe engraving, though coarse, is executed in a bold and free manner; and\r\nthe folds of the drapery are marked in a style which would do credit to\r\na proficient. The whole subject, though expressed by means of few lines,\r\nis not executed in the very simplest style of art. In the draperies a\r\ndiminution and a thickening of the lines, where necessary to the effect,\r\nmay be observed; and the shades are indicated by means of parallel lines\r\nboth perpendicular, oblique, and curved, as may be seen in the saint’s\r\nrobe and mantle. In many of the wood-cuts executed between 1462 and\r\n1500, the figures are expressed, and the drapery indicated, by simple\r\nlines of one undeviating degree of thickness, without the slightest\r\nattempt at shading by means of parallel lines running in a direction\r\ndifferent to those marking the folds of the drapery or the outlines of\r\nthe figure. If mere rudeness of design, and simplicity in the mode of\r\nexecution, were to be considered as the sole tests of antiquity in\r\nwood-engravings, upwards of a hundred, positively known to have been\r\nexecuted between 1470 and 1500, might be produced as affording intrinsic\r\nevidence of their having been executed at a period antecedent to the\r\ndate of the St. Christopher.\r\n\r\nIn the Royal Library at Paris there is an impression of St. Christopher\r\nwith the youthful Christ, which was supposed to be a duplicate of that\r\nin the possession of Earl Spencer. On comparing them, however, “it was\r\nquite evident,” says Dr. Dibdin, “at the first glance, as M. Du Chesne\r\nadmitted, that they were impressions taken from _different blocks_. The\r\nquestion therefore was, after a good deal of pertinacious argument on\r\nboth sides--which of the two impressions was the more ancient?\r\nUndoubtedly it was that of Lord Spencer.” At first Dr. Dibdin thought\r\nthat the French impression was a copy of Earl Spencer’s, and that it\r\nmight be as old as the year 1460; but, from a note added in the second\r\nedition of his tour, he seems to have received a new light. He there\r\nsays: “The reasons upon which this conclusion [that the French cut was a\r\ncopy of a later date] was founded, are stated at length in the preceding\r\nedition of this work: since which, I very strongly incline to the\r\nsupposition that the Paris impression is a _proof_--of one of the\r\n_cheats_ of DE MURR.”[II-14]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-14: Bibliographical and Picturesque Tour, by the Rev.\r\n    T. F. Dibdin, D.D. p. 58, vol. ii. second edition, 1829. The De\r\n    Murr to whom Dr. Dibdin alludes, is C. G. Von Murr, editor of the\r\n    Journal of Arts and General Literature, published at Nuremberg in\r\n    1775 and subsequent years. Von Murr was the first who published,\r\n    in the second volume of his journal, a _fac-simile_, engraved on\r\n    wood by Sebast. Roland, of the Buxheim St. Christopher, from a\r\n    tracing sent to him by P. Krismer, the librarian of the convent.\r\n    Von Murr, in his Memorabilia of the City of Nuremberg, mentions\r\n    that Breitkopf had seen a duplicate impression of the Buxheim St.\r\n    Christopher in the possession of M. De Birkenstock at Vienna.]\r\n\r\nOn the inside of the first cover or “board” of the Laus Virginis, the\r\nvolume which contains the St. Christopher, there is also pasted a wood\r\nengraving of the Annunciation, of a similar size to the above-named cut,\r\nand impressed on the same kind of paper. As they are both worked off in\r\nthe same kind of dark-coloured ink, and as they evidently have been\r\ncoloured in the same manner, by means of a stencil, there can be little\r\ndoubt of their being executed about the same time. From the left-hand\r\ncorner of the Annunciation the figure of the Almighty has been torn out.\r\nThe Holy Ghost, who appears descending from the Father upon the Virgin\r\nin the material form of a dove, could not well be torn out without\r\ngreatly disfiguring the cut. An idea may be formed of the original from\r\nthe following reduced copy.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nRespecting these cuts, which in all probability were engraved by some\r\none of the Formschneiders of Augsburg, Ulm, or Nuremberg,[II-15]\r\nP. Krismer, who was librarian of the convent of Buxheim, and who showed\r\nthe volume in which they are pasted to Heineken, writes to Von Murr to\r\nthe following effect: “It will not be superfluous if I here point out a\r\nmark, by which, in my opinion, old wood engravings may with certainty be\r\ndistinguished from those of a later period. It is this: In the oldest\r\nwood-cuts only do we perceive that the engraver [Formschneider] has\r\nfrequently omitted certain parts, leaving them to be afterwards filled\r\nup by the card-colourer [Briefmaler]. In the St. Christopher there is no\r\nsuch deficiency, although there is in the other cut which is pasted on\r\nthe inside of the fore covering of the same volume, and which, I doubt\r\nnot, was executed at the same time as the former. It represents the\r\nsalutation of the Virgin by the angel Gabriel, or, as it is also called,\r\nthe Annunciation; and, from the omission of the colours, the upper part\r\nof the body of the kneeling Virgin appears naked, except where it is\r\ncovered with her mantle. Her inner dress had been left to be added by\r\nthe pencil of the card-colourer. In another wood-cut of the same kind,\r\nrepresenting St. Jerome doing penance before a small crucifix placed on\r\na hill, we see with surprise that the saint, together with the\r\ninstruments of penance, which are lying near him, and a whole forest\r\nbeside, are suspended in the air without anything to support them, as\r\nthe whole of the ground had been left to be inserted with the pencil.\r\nNothing of this kind is to be seen in more recent wood-cuts, when the\r\nart had made greater progress. What the early wood-engravers could not\r\nreadily effect with the graver, they performed with the pencil,--for the\r\nmost part in a very coarse and careless manner,--as they were at the\r\nsame time both wood-engravers and card-colourers.”[II-16]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-15: There is every reason in the world to suppose\r\n    that this wood-cut was executed either in Nuremberg or Augsburg.\r\n    Buxheim is situated almost in the very heart of Suabia, the circle\r\n    in which we find the earliest wood engravers established. Buxheim\r\n    is about thirty English miles from Ulm, forty-four from Augsburg,\r\n    and one hundred and fifteen from Nuremberg. Von Murr does not\r\n    notice the pretensions of Ulm, which on his own grounds are\r\n    stronger than those of his native city, Nuremberg.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-16: Von Murr, Journal, 2 Theil, S. 105, 106.]\r\n\r\nBesides the St. Christopher and the Annunciation, there is another old\r\nwood-cut in the collection of Earl Spencer which appears to belong to\r\nthe same period, and which has in all probability been engraved by a\r\nGerman artist, as all who can read the German inscription above the\r\nfigure would reasonably infer. Before making any remarks on this\r\nengraving, I shall first lay before the reader a reduced copy.\r\n\r\nThe figure writing is that of St. Bridget of Sweden, who was born in\r\n1302 and died in 1373. From the representation of the Virgin with the\r\ninfant Christ in her arms we may suppose that the artist intended to\r\nshow the pious widow writing an account of her visions or revelations,\r\nin which she was often favoured with the blessed Virgin’s appearance.\r\nThe pilgrim’s hat, staff, and scrip may allude to her pilgrimage to\r\nJerusalem, which she was induced to make in consequence of a vision. The\r\nletters S. P. Q. R. in a shield, are no doubt intended to denote the\r\nplace, Rome, where she saw the vision, and where she died. The lion, the\r\narms of Sweden, and the crown at her feet, are most likely intended to\r\ndenote that she was a princess of the blood royal of that kingdom. The\r\nwords above the figure of the saint are a brief invocation in the German\r\nlanguage, “_O Brigita bit Got für uns!_” “O Bridget, pray to God for\r\nus!” At the foot of the desk at which St. Bridget is writing are the\r\nletters M. I. CHRS., an abbreviation probably of Mater Jesu Christi, or\r\nif German, Mutter Iesus Christus.[II-17]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-17: St. Bridget was a favourite saint in Germany,\r\n    where many religious establishments of the rule of St. Saviour,\r\n    introduced by her, were founded. A folio volume, containing the\r\n    life, revelations, and legends of St. Bridget, was published by\r\n    A. Koberger, Nuremberg, 1502, with the following title: “Das puch\r\n    der Himlischen offenbarung der Heiligen wittiben Birgitte von dem\r\n    Kunigreich Schweden.”]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nFrom the appearance of the back of this cut, as if it had been rubbed\r\nsmooth with a burnisher or rubber, there can be little doubt of the\r\nimpression having been taken by means of friction. The colouring matter\r\nof the engraving is much lighter than in the St. Christopher and the\r\nAnnunciation, and is like distemper or water-colour; while that of the\r\nlatter cuts appears, as has been already observed, more like printer’s\r\nink. It is coarsely coloured, and apparently by the hand, unassisted\r\nwith the stencil. The face and hands are of a flesh colour. Her gown, as\r\nwell as the pilgrim’s hat and scrip, are of a dark grey; her veil, which\r\nshe wears hoodwise, is partly black and partly white; and the wimple\r\nwhich she wears round her neck is also white. The bench and desk, the\r\npilgrim’s staff, the letters S. P. Q. R., the lion, the crown, and the\r\nnimbus surrounding the head of St. Bridget and that of the Virgin, are\r\nyellow. The ground is green, and the whole cut is surrounded with a\r\nborder of a shining mulberry or lake colour.\r\n\r\nMr. Ottley, having at the very outset of his Inquiry adopted Papillon’s\r\nstory of the Cunio, is compelled, for consistency’s sake, in the\r\nsubsequent portion of his work, when speaking of early wood engravings\r\nsuch as the above, to consider them, not as the earliest known specimens\r\nof the art, but merely as wood engravings such as were produced upwards\r\nof a hundred and thirty years after the amiable and accomplished Cunio,\r\na mere boy and a girl, had in Italy produced a set of wood engravings,\r\none of which was so well composed that Le Brun might be suspected of\r\nhaving borrowed from it the design of one of his most complicated\r\npictures. In his desire, in support of his theory, to refer the oldest\r\nwood-cuts to Italy, Mr. Ottley asks: “What if these two prints [the St.\r\nChristopher and the Annunciation] should prove to be, not the\r\nproductions of Germany, but rather of Venice, or of some district of the\r\nterritory then under the dominion of that republic?”\r\n\r\nHis principal reasons for the preceding conjecture, are the ancient use\r\nof the word _stampide_--“printed”--in the Venetian decree against the\r\nintroduction of foreign playing-cards in 1441; and the resemblance which\r\nthe Annunciation bears to the style of the early Italian schools. Now,\r\nwith respect to the first of these reasons, it is founded on the\r\nassumption that both those impressions have been obtained by means of a\r\npress of some kind or other,--a fact which remains yet to be proved; for\r\nuntil the backs of both shall have been examined, and the mark of the\r\nburnisher or rubber found wanting, no person’s mere opinion, however\r\nconfidently declared, can be decisive of the question. It also remains\r\nto be proved that the word _stampide_, which occurs in the Venetian\r\ndecree, was employed there to signify “_printed with a press_.” For it\r\nis certain that the low Latin word _stampare_, with its cognates in the\r\ndifferent languages of Europe, was used at that period to denote\r\n_impression_ generally. But even supposing that “_stampide_” signifies\r\n“printed” in the modern acceptation of the word, and that the two\r\nimpressions in question were obtained by means of a press; the argument\r\nin favour of their being Italian would gain nothing, unless we assume\r\nthat the _foreign_ printed cards and figures, which were forbid to be\r\nimported into Venice, were produced either within the territory of that\r\nstate or in Italy; for the word _stampide_--“_printed_,” is applied to\r\nthem as well as those manufactured within the city. Now we know that the\r\nGerman card-makers used to send great quantities of cards to Venice\r\nabout the period when the decree was made, while we have no evidence of\r\nany Italian cities manufacturing cards for exportation in 1441; it is\r\ntherefore most likely that if the Venetians were acquainted with the use\r\nof the press in taking impressions from wood-blocks, the Germans were so\r\ntoo, and for these more probable reasons, admitting the cuts in question\r\nto have been printed by means of a press:--First, the fact of those\r\nwood-cuts being discovered in Germany in the very district where we\r\nfirst hear of wood-engravers; and secondly, that if the Venetian\r\nwood-engravers were acquainted with the use of the press in taking\r\nimpressions while the Germans were not, it is very unlikely that the\r\nlatter would be able to undersell the Venetians in their own city. Until\r\nsomething like a probable reason shall be given for supposing the cuts\r\nin question to be productions “of Venice, or some other district of the\r\nterritory then under the dominion of that republic,” I shall continue to\r\nbelieve that they were executed in the district in which they were\r\ndiscovered, and which has supplied to the collections of amateurs so\r\nmany old wood engravings of a similar kind. No wood engravings executed\r\nin Italy, are known of a date earlier than those contained in the\r\n“Meditationes Johannis de Turre-cremata,” printed at Rome 1467,--and\r\nprinted, be it observed, by a German, Ulrick Hahn. The circular wood\r\nengravings in the British Museum,[II-18] which Mr. Ottley says are\r\nindisputably Italian, and of the old dry taste of the fifteenth century,\r\ncan scarcely be referred to an earlier period than 1500, and my own\r\nopinion is that they are not older than 1510. The manner in which they\r\nare engraved is that which we find prevalent in Italian wood-cuts\r\nexecuted between 1500 and 1520.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-18: Those cuts consist of illustrations of the New\r\n    Testament. There are ten of them, apparently a portion of a larger\r\n    series, in the British Museum; and they are marked in small\r\n    letters, a. b. c. d. e. f. g. h. i. k. n. That which is marked\r\n    g. also contains the words “Opus Jacobi.” In this cut a specimen\r\n    of cross-hatching may be observed, which was certainly very little\r\n    practised--if at all--in Italy, before 1500.]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the resemblance which the Annunciation bears to the\r\nstyle of the early Italian school,--I beg to observe that it equally\r\nresembles many of the productions of contemporary “schools” of England\r\nand France, as displayed in many of the drawings contained in old\r\nilluminated manuscripts. It would be no difficult matter to point out in\r\nmany old German engravings attitudes at least as graceful as the\r\nVirgin’s; and as to her drapery, which is said to be “wholly unlike the\r\nangular sharpness, the stiffness and the flutter of the ancient German\r\nschool,” I beg to observe that those peculiarities are not of so\r\nfrequent occurrence in the works of German artists, whether sculptors,\r\npainters, or wood-engravers, who lived before 1450, as in the works of\r\nthose who lived after that period. Angular sharpness and flutter in the\r\ndraperies are not so characteristic of early German art generally, as of\r\nGerman art towards the end of the fifteenth, and in the early part of\r\nthe sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nEven the St. Bridget, which he considers to be of a date not later than\r\nthe close of the fourteenth century,[II-19] Mr. Ottley, with a German\r\ninscription before his eyes, is inclined to give to an artist of the Low\r\nCountries; and he kindly directs the attention of Coster’s partisans to\r\nthe shield of arms--probably intended for those of Sweden--at the\r\nright-hand corner of the cut. Meerman had discovered a seal, having in\r\nthe centre a shield charged with a lion rampant--the bearing of the\r\nnoble family of Brederode--a label of three points, and the mark of\r\nillegitimacy--a bend sinister, and surrounded by the inscription,\r\n“S[igillum] Lowrens Janssoen,” which with him was sufficient evidence of\r\nits being the identical seal of Laurence, the Coster or churchwarden of\r\nHarlem.[II-20]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-19: Mr. Ottley’s reason for considering this cut to\r\n    be so old is, that “after that period [1400] an artist, who was\r\n    capable of designing so good a figure, could scarcely have been so\r\n    grossly ignorant of every effect of linear perspective, as was\r\n    evidently the case with the author of the performance before\r\n    us.”--Inquiry, p. 87. Offences, however, scarcely less gross\r\n    against the rules of linear perspective, are to be found in the\r\n    wood-cuts in the Adventures of Sir Theurdank, 1517, many of which\r\n    contain figures superior to that of St. Bridget. Errors in\r\n    perspective are indeed frequent in the designs of many of the most\r\n    eminent of Albert Durer’s contemporaries, although in other\r\n    respects the figures may be correctly drawn, and the general\r\n    composition good.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-20: An engraving of this seal is given in the first\r\n    volume of Meerman’s Origines Typographicæ.]\r\n\r\nWe thus perceive on what grounds the right of Germany to three of the\r\noldest wood-cuts known is questioned; and upon what traits of\r\nresemblance they are ascribed to Italy and the Low Countries. By\r\nadopting Mr. Ottley’s mode of reasoning, it might be shown with equal\r\nprobability that a very considerable number of early wood\r\nengravings--whether printed in books or separately--hitherto believed to\r\nbe German, were really executed in Italy.\r\n\r\nAn old wood engraving of the martyrdom of St. Sebastian, of a quarto\r\nsize, with a short prayer underneath, and the date 1437, apparently from\r\nthe same block, was preserved in the monastery of St. Blaze, in the\r\nBlack Forest on the confines of Suabia;[II-21] and another, with the\r\ndate 1443 inserted in manuscript, was pasted in a volume belonging to\r\nthe library of the monastery of Buxheim. The latter is thus described by\r\nVon Murr: “Through the kindness of the celebrated librarian, Krismer,\r\nwhom I have so often mentioned, I am enabled to give an account of an\r\nilluminated wood-cut, which at the latest must have been engraved in\r\n1443. It is pasted on the inside of the cover of a volume which contains\r\n‘_Nicolai Dunkelspül_[II-22] Sermonum Partem Hyemalem.’ It is of quarto\r\nsize, being seven and a half inches high, and five and a quarter wide,\r\nand is inclosed within a border of a single line. It is much soiled, as\r\nwe perceive in the figures on cards which have been impressed by means\r\nof a rubber. The style in which it is executed is like that of no other\r\nwood-cut which I have ever seen. The cut itself represents three\r\ndifferent subjects, the upper part of it being divided into two\r\ncompartments, each three inches square, and separated from each other by\r\nmeans of a broad perpendicular line. In that to the right is seen St.\r\nDorothy sitting in a garden, with the youthful Christ presenting flowers\r\nto her, of which she has her lap full. Before her stands a small\r\nhand-basket,--also full of flowers,--such as the ladies of Franconia and\r\nSuabia were accustomed to carry in former times. In the left compartment\r\nis seen St. Alexius, lying at the foot of a flight of steps, upon which\r\na man is standing and emptying the contents of a pot upon the\r\nsaint.[II-23] Between these compartments there appears in manuscript the\r\ndate ‘_anno d’ni 1443_.’ Both the ink and the characters correspond with\r\nthose of the volume. This date indicates the time when the writer had\r\nfinished the book and got it bound, as is more clearly proved by a\r\nmemorandum at the conclusion. In the year 1483, before it came into the\r\npossession of the monastery of Buxheim, it belonged to Brother Jacobus\r\nMatzenberger, of the order of the Holy Ghost, and curate of the church\r\nof the Virgin Mary in Memmingen. The whole of the lower part of the cut\r\nis occupied with Christ bearing his cross, at the moment that he meets\r\nwith his mother, whom one of the executioners appears to be driving\r\naway. Simon of Cyrene is seen assisting Christ to carry the cross. The\r\nengraving is executed in a very coarse manner.”[II-24]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-21: Heineken, Neue Nachrichten von Künstlern und\r\n    Kunstsachen. Dresden und Leipzig, 1786, S. 143.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-22: In the Table des Matières to Jansen’s Essai sur\r\n    l’Origine de la Gravure, Paris, 1808, we find “Dünkelspül\r\n    (Nicolas) graveur Allemand en 1443.” After this specimen of\r\n    accuracy, it is rather surprising that we do not find St. Alexius\r\n    referred to also as “un graveur Allemand.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-23: St. Alexius returning unknown to his father’s\r\n    house, as a poor pilgrim, was treated with great indignity by the\r\n    servants.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-24: Von Murr, Journal, 2 Theil, S. 113-115.]\r\n\r\nIn the Royal Library at Paris there is an ancient wood-cut of St.\r\nBernardin, who is represented on a terrace, the pavement of which\r\nconsists of alternate squares of yellow, red, and green. In his right\r\nhand the saint holds something resembling the consecrated wafer or host,\r\nin the midst of which is inscribed the name of Christ; and in his left a\r\nkind of oblong casket, on which are the words “_Vide, lege, dulce\r\nnomen_.” Upon a scroll above the head of the saint is engraved the\r\nsentence, “_Ihesus semper sit in ore meo_,” and behind him, on a black\r\nlabel, is his name in yellow letters, “_Sanct’ Bernard’_.” The cut is\r\nsurrounded by a border of foliage, with the emblems of the four\r\nEvangelists at the four corners, and at the foot are the five following\r\nlines, with the date, impressed from prominent lines:--\r\n\r\n  _O . splendor . pudicitie . zelator . paupertatis . a\r\n  mator. innocentie . cultor . virginitatis . lustra\r\n  cors . apientie . protector . veritatis . thro\r\n  num . fulgidum . eterne . majestatis . para\r\n  nobis . additum . divine . pietatis . amen. (1454)_\r\n\r\nThis rare cut was communicated to Jansen by M. Vanpraet, the well-known\r\nbibliographer and keeper of the Royal Library.[II-25]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-25: Jansen, Essai sur l’Origine de la Gravure, tom.\r\n    i. p. 237. Jansen’s own authority on subjects connected with wood\r\n    engraving is undeserving of attention. He is a mere compiler, who\r\n    scarcely appears to have been able to distinguish a wood-cut from\r\n    a copper-plate engraving.]\r\n\r\n“Having visited in my last tour,” says Heineken, after describing the\r\nSt. Christopher, “a great many convents in Franconia, Suabia, Bavaria,\r\nand in the Austrian states, I everywhere discovered in their libraries\r\nmany of those kinds of figures, engraved on wood, and pasted either at\r\nthe beginning or the end of old volumes of the fifteenth century. I have\r\nindeed obtained several of them. These facts, taken altogether, have\r\nconfirmed me in my opinion that the next step of the engraver in wood,\r\nafter playing-cards, was to engrave figures of saints, which, being\r\ndistributed and lost among the laity, were in part preserved by the\r\nmonks, who pasted them in the earliest printed books with which they\r\nfurnished their libraries.”[II-26]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-26: Idée Générale, p. 251. Hartman Schedel, the\r\n    compiler of the Nuremberg Chronicle, was accustomed to paste both\r\n    old wood-cuts and copper-plate engravings within the covers of his\r\n    books, many of which were preserved in the Library of the Elector\r\n    of Bavaria at Munich.--Idée Gén. p. 287; and Von Murr, Journal,\r\n    2 Theil, S. 115.]\r\n\r\nA great many wood-cuts of devotional subjects, of a period probably\r\nanterior to the invention of book-printing by Gutenberg, have been\r\ndiscovered in Germany. They are all executed in a rude style, and many\r\nof them are coloured. It is not unlikely that the most of these woodcuts\r\nwere executed at the instance of the monks for distribution among the\r\ncommon people as helps to devotion; and that each monastery, which might\r\nthus avail itself of the aid of wood engraving in the work of piety,\r\nwould cause to be engraved the figure of its patron saint. The practice,\r\nin fact, of distributing such figures at monasteries and shrines to\r\nthose who visit them, is not yet extinct on the Continent. In Belgium it\r\nis still continued, and, I believe, also in Germany, France, and Italy.\r\nThe figures, however, are not generally impressions from wood-blocks,\r\nbut are for the most part wholly executed by means of stencils. One of\r\nthe latter class, representing the shrine of “Notre Dame de\r\nHal,”--coloured in the most wretched taste with brick-dust red and\r\nshining green,--is now lying before me. It was given to a gentleman who\r\nvisited Halle, near Brussels, in 1829. It is nearly of the same size as\r\nmany of the old devotional wood-cuts of Germany, being about four inches\r\nhigh, by two and three-quarters wide.[II-27]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-27: Heineken thus speaks of those old devotional\r\n    cuts: “On trouve dans la Bibliothèque de Wolfenbüttel de ces\r\n    sortes d’estampes, qui représentent différens sujets de l’histoire\r\n    sainte et de dévotion, avec du texte vis à vis de la figure, tout\r\n    gravé en bois. Ces pièces sont de la même grandeur que nos cartes\r\n    à jouer: elles portent 3 pouces de hauteur sur 2 pouces 6 lignes\r\n    de largeur.”--Idée Générale, p. 249.]\r\n\r\nThe next step in the progress of wood engraving, subsequent to the\r\nproduction of single cuts, such as the St. Christopher, the\r\nAnnunciation, and the St. Bridget, in each of which letters are\r\nsparingly introduced, was the application of the art to the production\r\nof those works which are known to bibliographers by the name of\r\nBLOCK-BOOKS: the most celebrated of which are the Apocalypsis, seu\r\nHistoria Sancti Johannis; the Historia Virginis ex Cantico Canticorum;\r\nand the Biblia Pauperum. The first is a history, pictorial and literal,\r\nof the life and revelations of St. John the Evangelist, derived in part\r\nfrom the traditions of the church, but chiefly from the book of\r\nRevelations. The second is a similar history of the Virgin, as it is\r\nsupposed to be typified in the Songs of Solomon; and the third consists\r\nof subjects representing some of the most important passages in the Old\r\nand New Testament, with texts either explaining the subject, or\r\nenforcing the example of duty which it may afford. With the above, the\r\nSpeculum Humanæ Salvationis is usually, though improperly, classed, as\r\nthe whole of the text, in that which is most certainly the first\r\nedition, is printed from movable metal types. In the others the\r\nexplanatory matter is engraved on wood, on the same block with the\r\nsubject to which it refers.\r\n\r\nAll the above books have been claimed by Meerman and other Dutch writers\r\nfor their countryman, Laurence Coster: and although no date, either\r\nimpressed or manuscript, has been discovered in any one copy from which\r\nthe period of its execution might be ascertained,[II-28] yet such\r\nappears to have been the clearness of the intuitive light which guided\r\nthose authors, that they have assigned to each work the precise year in\r\nwhich it appeared. According to Seiz, the History of the Old and New\r\nTestament, otherwise called the Biblia Pauperum, appeared in 1432; the\r\nHistory of the Virgin in 1433; the Apocalypse in 1434; and the Speculum\r\nin 1439. For such assertions, however, he has not the slightest ground.\r\nThat the three first might appear at some period between 1430 and 1450,\r\nis not unlikely;[II-29] but that the Speculum--_the text of which in the\r\nfirst edition was printed from metal types_--should be printed before\r\n1460, is in the highest degree improbable.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-28: A copy of the Speculum belonging to the city of\r\n    Harlem had at the commencement, “_Ex Officina Laurentii Joannis\r\n    Costeri. Anno 1440_.” But this inscription had been inserted by a\r\n    modern hand--Idée Générale, p. 449.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-29: In the catalogue of Dr. Kloss’s Library,\r\n    No. 2024, is a “Historia et Apocalypsis Johannis Evangelistæ,”\r\n    imperfect, printed from wooden blocks. The following are the\r\n    observations of the editor or compiler of the catalogue: “At the\r\n    end of the volume is a short note, written by Pope Martin V., who\r\n    occupied the papal chair from 1417 to 1431. This appears to accord\r\n    with the edition described by Heineken at page 360, excepting in\r\n    the double _a_, No. 3 and 4.” If the note referred to were\r\n    genuine, and actually written in the book, a certain date would be\r\n    at once established. The information, however, comes in a\r\n    questionable shape, as the English _rédacteur’s_ power of\r\n    ascertaining who were the writers of ancient MS. notes appears\r\n    little short of miraculous.]\r\n\r\nUpon extremely slight grounds it has been conjectured that the Biblia\r\nPauperum, the Apocalypse, and the Ars Moriendi,--another\r\nblock-book,--were engraved before the year 1430. The Rev. T. H. Horne,\r\n“a gentleman long and well known for his familiar acquaintance with\r\nbooks printed abroad,” says Dr. Dibdin, “had a copy of each of the three\r\nbooks above mentioned, bound in one volume, upon the cover of which the\r\nfollowing words were stamped: Hic liber relegatus fuit per Plebanum.\r\necclesie”--with the date, according to the best of the Rev. Mr. Horne’s\r\nrecollection, 142(8). As he had broken up the volume, and had parted\r\nwith the contents, he gave the above information on the strength of his\r\nmemory alone. He was, however, confident that “the binding was the\r\nancient legitimate one, and that the treatises had not been subsequently\r\nintroduced into it, and that the date was 142 odd; but positively\r\nanterior to 1430.”[II-30]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-30: Bibliotheca Spenceriana, vol. i. p. 4, cited in\r\n    Ottley’s Inquiry, vol. i. p. 99.]\r\n\r\nIn such a case as this, however, mere recollection cannot be admitted as\r\ndecisive of the fact, more especially when we know the many instances in\r\nwhich mistakes have been committed in reading the numerals in ancient\r\ndates. At page 88 of his Inquiry, Mr. Ottley, catching at every straw\r\nthat may help to support his theory of wood engraving having been\r\npractised by the Cunio and others in the fourteenth century, refers to a\r\nprint which a Monsieur Thierry professed to have seen at Lyons,\r\ninscribed “SCHOTING OF NUREMBERG,” with the date 1384; and at p. 256 he\r\nalludes to it again in the following words: “The date 1384 on the\r\nwood-cut preserved at Lyons, said to have been executed at Nuremberg,\r\nappears, I know not why, to have been suspected.” It has been more than\r\nsuspected; for, on examination, it has been found to be 1584. Paul Von\r\nStettin published an account of a Biblia Pauperum, the date of which he\r\nsupposed to be 1414; but which, when closely examined, was found to be\r\n1474: and Baron Von Hupsch, of Cologne, published in 1787 an account of\r\nsome wood-cuts which he supposed to have been executed in 1420; but\r\nwhich, in the opinion of Breitkopf, were part of the cuts of a Biblia\r\nPauperum, in which it was probably intended to give the explanations in\r\nmoveable types underneath the cuts, and probably of a later date than\r\n1470.[II-31]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-31: Singer’s Researches into the History of\r\n    Playing-cards, p. 107.]\r\n\r\nIt is surprising that the Rev. Mr. Horne, who is no incurious observer\r\nof books, but an author who has written largely on Bibliography, should\r\nnot have carefully copied so remarkable a date, or communicated it to a\r\nfriend, when it might have been confirmed by a careful examination of\r\nthe binding; and still more surprising is it that such binding should\r\nhave been destroyed. From the very fact of his not having paid more\r\nparticular attention to this most important date, and from his having\r\npermitted the evidence of it to be destroyed, the Rev. Mr. Horne seems\r\nto be an incompetent witness. Who would think of calling a person to\r\nprove from recollection the date of an old and important deed, who, when\r\nhe had it in his possession, was so little aware of its value as to\r\nthrow it away? The three books in question, when covered by such a\r\nbinding, would surely be much greater than when bound in any other\r\nmanner. Such a volume must have been unique; and, if the date on the\r\nbinding were correct, it must have been admitted as decisive of a fact\r\ninteresting to every bibliographer in Europe. It is not even mentioned\r\nin what kind of numerals the date was expressed, whether in Roman or\r\nArabic. If the numerals had been Arabic, we might very reasonably\r\nsuppose that the Rev. Mr. Horne had mistaken a seven for a two, and\r\nthat, instead of “142 odd,” the correct date was “147 odd.” In Arabic\r\nnumerals, such as were used about the middle of the fifteenth century,\r\nthe seven may very easily be mistaken for a two.\r\n\r\nThe earliest ancient binding known, on which a date is impressed, is,\r\nI believe, that described by Laire.[II-32] It is that of a copy of\r\n“Sancti Hieronymi Epistolæ;” and the words, in the same manner as that\r\nof the binding of which the Rev. Mr. Horne had so accurate a\r\nrecollection, were “stamped at the extremity of the binding, towards the\r\nedge of the squares.” It is only necessary to cite the words impressed\r\non one of the boards, which were as follows:\r\n\r\n  “Illigatus est Anno Domini 1469\r\n          Per me Johannem\r\n        Richenbach Capellanum\r\n          In Gyslingen.”[II-33]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-32: Index Librorum ab inventa Typographia ad annum\r\n    1500, No. 37.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-33: Mr. Bohn is in possession of a similarly bound\r\n    volume, namely, “Astexani de Ast, Scrutinium Scripturarum,”\r\n    printed by Mentelin, without date, but about 1468, on the pig-skin\r\n    covers of which is printed in bold black letter, _Per me\r\n    Rich-en-bach illigatus in Gysslingen 1470_.]\r\n\r\nThe numerals of the date it is to be observed were Arabic. In the\r\nlibrary of Dr. Kloss of Frankfort, sold in London by Sotheby and Son in\r\n1835, were two volumes, “St. Augustini de Civitat. Dei, Libri xxii.\r\n1469,” and “St. Augustini Confessiones” of the same date; both of which\r\nwere bound by “Johannes Capellanus in Gyslingen,” and who in the same\r\nmanner had impressed his name on the covers with the date 1470. Both\r\nvolumes had belonged to “Dominus Georgius Ruch de Gamundia.”[II-34] That\r\nthe volume formerly in the Rev. Mr. Horne’s possession was bound by the\r\ncurate of Geisslingen I by no means pretend to say, though I am firmly\r\nof opinion that it was bound subsequent to 1470, and that the character\r\nwhich he supposed to be a two was in reality a different figure. It is\r\nworthy of remark that it appears to have been bound by the “Plebanus” of\r\nsome church, a word which is nearly synonymous with “Capellanus.”[II-35]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-34: “Catalogue of the Library of Dr. Kloss of\r\n    Frankfort,” Nos. 460 and 468. Geisslingen is about fifteen miles\r\n    north-west of Ulm in Suabia, and Gemund about twelve miles\r\n    northward of Geisslingen.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-35: Mr. Singer, at page 101 of his Researches into\r\n    the History of Playing-cards, speaks of “_one_ Plebanus of\r\n    Augsburg,” as if Plebanus were a proper name. It has nearly the\r\n    same meaning as our own word “Curate.” “PLEBANUS, Parœcus, Curio,\r\n    Sacerdos, qui _plebi_ præest; Italis, _Piovano_; Gallo-Belgis,\r\n    _Pleban_. Balbus in Catholico: ‘Plebanus, dominus plebis,\r\n    Presbyter, qui plebem regit.’--Plebanum vero maxime vocant in\r\n    ecclesiis cathedralibus seu collegiatis canonicum, cui plebis\r\n    earum jurisdictioni subditæ cura committitur.”--Du Cange,\r\n    Glossarium, in verbo “Plebanus.”]\r\n\r\nAs it does not come within the plan of the present volume to give a\r\ncatalogue of all the subjects contained in the block-books to which it\r\nmay be necessary to refer as illustrating the progress of wood\r\nengraving, I shall confine myself to a general notice of the manner in\r\nwhich the cuts are executed, with occasional observations on the\r\ndesigns, and such remarks as may be likely to explain any peculiarity of\r\nappearance, or to enable the reader to form a distinct idea of the\r\nsubject referred to.\r\n\r\nAt whatever period the Apocalypse, the History of the Virgin, and the\r\nBiblia Pauperum may have been executed, the former has the appearance of\r\nbeing the earliest; and in the absence of everything like proof upon the\r\npoint, and as the style in which it is engraved is certainly more simple\r\nthan that of the other two, it seems entitled to be first noticed in\r\ntracing the progress of the art.\r\n\r\nOf the Apocalypse,--or “Historia Sancti Johannis Evangelistæ ejusque\r\nVisiones Apocalypticæ,” as it is mostly termed by bibliographers, for\r\nthe book itself has no title,--Heineken mentions no less than six\r\neditions, the earliest of which he considers to be that described by him\r\nat page 367 of his “Idée Générale d’une Collection complète d’Estampes.”\r\nHe, however, declares that the marks by which he has assigned to each\r\nedition its comparative antiquity are not infallible. It is indeed very\r\nevident that the marks which he assumed as characteristic of the\r\nrelative order of the different editions were merely arbitrary, and\r\ncould by no means be admitted as of the slightest consequence in\r\nenabling any person to form a correct opinion on the subject. He notices\r\ntwo editions as the first and second, and immediately after he mentions\r\na circumstance which might almost entitle the third to take precedence\r\nof them both; and that which he saw last he thinks the oldest of all.\r\nThe designs of the second edition described by him, he says, are by\r\nanother master than those of the first, although the artist has adhered\r\nto the same subjects and the same ideas. The third, according to his\r\nobservations, differs from the first and second, both in the subjects\r\nand the descriptive text. The fourth edition is from the same blocks as\r\nthe third; the only difference between them being, that the fourth is\r\nwithout the letters in alphabetical order which indicate the succession\r\nof the cuts. The fifth differed from the third or fourth only in the\r\ntext and the directing letters, as the designs were the same; the only\r\nvariations that could be observed being extremely trifling. After having\r\ndescribed five editions of the book, he decides that a sixth, which he\r\nsaw after the others, ought to be considered the earliest of all.[II-36]\r\nIn all the copies which he had seen, the impressions had been taken by\r\nmeans of a rubber, in such a manner that each leaf contained only one\r\nengraving; the other side, which commonly bore the marks of the rubber,\r\nbeing without a cut. The impressions when collected into a volume faced\r\neach other, so that the first and last pages were blank.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-36: Idée Générale, pp. 334-370.]\r\n\r\nThe edition of the Apocalypse to which I shall now refer is that\r\ndescribed by Heineken, at page 364, as the fifth; and the copy is that\r\nmentioned by him, at page 367, as then being in the collection of M. de\r\nGaignat, and as wanting two cuts, Nos. 36 and 37. It is at present in\r\nthe King’s Library at the British Museum.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is a thin folio in modern red morocco binding, and has, when perfect,\r\nconsisted of fifty wood engravings, with their explanatory text also cut\r\nin wood, generally within an oblong border of a single line, within the\r\n_field_ of the engraving, and not added underneath, as in the Speculum\r\nSalvationis, nor in detached compartments, both above and below, as in\r\nthe Biblia Pauperum. The paper, which is somewhat of a cream colour, is\r\nstout, with rather a coarse surface, and such as we find the most\r\nancient books printed on. As each leaf has been pasted down on another\r\nof modern paper, in order to preserve it, the marks of the rubber at the\r\nback of each impression, as described by Heineken, cannot be seen. The\r\nannexed outline is a reduced copy of a paper-mark, which may be\r\nperceived on some of the leaves. It is very like that numbered “vii.” at\r\np. 224, vol. i. of Mr. Ottley’s Inquiry, and which he says occurs in the\r\nedition called the first Latin of the Speculum Salvationis. It is nearly\r\nthe same as that which is to be seen in Earl Spencer’s “Historia\r\nVirginis;” and Santander states that he has noticed a similar mark in\r\nbooks printed at Cologne by Ulric Zell, and Bart. de Unkel; at Louvain\r\nby John Veldener and Conrad Braen; and in books printed at Utrecht by\r\nNic. Ketelaer and Gerard de Leempt.\r\n\r\nThe size of the largest cuts, as defined by the plain lines which form\r\nthe border, is about ten and five-eighths inches high, by seven and\r\nsix-eighths inches wide; of the smallest, ten and two-eighths inches\r\nhigh, by seven and three-eighths wide.[II-37] The order in which they\r\nare to be placed in binding is indicated by a letter of the alphabet,\r\nwhich serves the same purpose as our modern signatures,--engraved in a\r\nconspicuous part of the cut. For instance, the first two, which, as well\r\nas the others, might either face each other or be pasted back to back,\r\nare each marked with the letter +a+; the two next with the letter +b+,\r\nand so on through the alphabet. As the alphabet--which has the i the\r\nsame as the j, the v the same as the u, and has not the w--became\r\nexhausted at the forty-sixth cut, the forty-seventh and forty-eighth are\r\nmarked with a character which was used to represent the words “et\r\ncetera;” and the forty-ninth and fiftieth with the terminal abbreviation\r\nof the letters “us.” In the copy described by Heineken, he observed that\r\nthe directing letters +m+ and +n+ were wanting in the twenty-fourth and\r\ntwenty-sixth cuts, and in the copy under consideration they are also\r\nomitted. The m, however, appears to have been engraved, though for some\r\nreason or other not to have been inked in taking an impression; for on a\r\ncareful examination of this cut,--without being aware at the time of\r\nHeineken having noticed the omission,--I thought that I could very\r\nplainly discern the indention of the letter above one of the angels in\r\nthe upper compartment of the print.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-37: In the copy of the Biblia Pauperum in the British\r\n    Museum,\r\n                               Inches.          Inches.\r\n            The largest cut is 10-4/8 high, and 7-5/8 wide.\r\n            The smallest  --   10-1/8  --    -- 7-5/8  --\r\n\r\n    In the Historia Virginis, also in the British Museum,\r\n            The largest cut is 10-3/8 high, and 7-2/8 wide.\r\n            The smallest  --    9-7/8  --    -- 6-7/8  --]\r\n\r\nOf the forty-eight cuts[II-38] contained in the Museum copy, the greater\r\nnumber are divided by a horizontal line, nearly in the middle, and thus\r\neach consists of two compartments; of the remainder, each is occupied by\r\na single subject, which fills the whole page. In some, the explanatory\r\ntext consists only of two or three lines; and in others it occupies so\r\nlarge a space, that if it were set up in moderately sized type, it would\r\nbe sufficient to fill a duodecimo page. The characters are different\r\nfrom those in the History of the Virgin and the Biblia Pauperum, and are\r\nsmaller than those of the former, and generally larger and more\r\ndistinctly cut than those of the latter; and although, as well as in the\r\ntwo last-named books, the words are much abbreviated, yet they are more\r\neasy to be made out than the text of either of the others. The\r\nimpressions on the whole are better taken than those of the Biblia\r\nPauperum, though in lighter-coloured ink, something like a greyish\r\nsepia, and apparently of a thinner body. It does not appear to have\r\ncontained any oil, and is more like distemper or water-colour than\r\nprinter’s ink. From the manner in which the lines are indented in the\r\npaper, in several of the cuts, it is evident that they must either have\r\nbeen subjected to a considerable degree of pressure or have been very\r\nhard rubbed.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-38: The two which are wanting are those numbered 36\r\n    and 37--that is, the second +s+, and the first +t+--in Heineken’s\r\n    collation. Although there is a memorandum at the commencement of\r\n    the book that those cuts are wanting, yet the person who has put\r\n    in the numbers, in manuscript, at the foot of each, has not\r\n    noticed the omission, but has continued the numbers consecutively,\r\n    marking that 36 which in a perfect copy is 38, and so on to the\r\n    rest. A reference to Heineken from those manuscript numbers\r\n    subsequent to the thirty-fifth cut would lead to error.]\r\n\r\nAlthough some of the figures bear a considerable degree of likeness to\r\nothers of the same kind in the Biblia Pauperum, I cannot think that the\r\ndesigns for both books were made by the same person. The figures in the\r\ndifferent works which most resemble each other are those of saints and\r\nangels, whose form and expression have been represented according to a\r\nconventional standard, to which most of the artists of the period\r\nconformed, in the same manner as in representing the Almighty and\r\nChrist, whether they were painters, glass-stainers, carvers, or\r\nwood-engravers. In many of the figures the drapery is broken into easy\r\nand natural folds by means of single lines; and if this were admitted as\r\na ground for assigning the cut of the Annunciation to Italy, with much\r\ngreater reason might the Apocalypse be ascribed to the same country.\r\n\r\nWithout venturing to give an opinion whether the cuts were engraved in\r\nGermany, Holland, or in the Low Countries, the drawing of many of the\r\nfigures appears to correspond with the idea that I have formed of the\r\nstyle of Greek art, such as it was in the early part of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. St. John was the favourite apostle of the Greeks, as St. Peter\r\nwas of the church of Rome; and as the Revelations were more especially\r\naddressed to the churches of Greece, they were more generally read in\r\nthat country than in Western Europe. Artists mostly copy, in the heads\r\nwhich they draw, the general expression of the country[II-39] to which\r\nthey belong, and where they have received their first impressions; and\r\nin the Apocalypse the character of several of the heads appears to be\r\ndecidedly Grecian. The general representation, too, of several visions\r\nwould seem to have been suggested by a Greek who was familiar with that\r\nportion of the New Testament which was so generally perused in his\r\nnative land, and whose annunciations and figurative prophecies were, in\r\nthe early part of the fifteenth century, commonly supposed by his\r\ncountrymen to relate to the Turks, who at that time were triumphing over\r\nthe cross. With them Mahomet was the Antichrist of the Revelations, and\r\nhis followers the people bearing the mark of the beast, who were to\r\npersecute, and for a time to hold in bondage, the members of the church\r\nof Christ. As many Greeks, both artists and scholars, were driven from\r\ntheir country by the oppression of the Turks several years before the\r\ntaking of Constantinople in 1453, I am induced to think that to a Greek\r\nwe owe the designs of this edition of the Apocalypse. In the lower\r\ndivision of the twenty-third cut, _m_, representing the fight of Michael\r\nand his angels with the dragon, the following shields are borne by two\r\nof the heavenly host.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-39: Witness Rembrandt, who never gets rid of the\r\n    Dutch character, no matter how elevated his subject may be.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe crescent, as is well known, was one of the badges of Constantinople\r\nlong previous to its capture by the Turks. The sort of cross in the\r\nother shield is very like that in the arms of the knights of St.\r\nConstantine, a military order which is said to have been founded at\r\nConstantinople by the Emperor Isaac Angelus Comnenus, in 1190. The above\r\ncoincidences, though trifling, tend to support the opinion that the\r\ndesigns were made by a Greek artist. It is, however, possible, that the\r\nbadges on the shields may have been suggested by the mere fancy of the\r\ndesigner, and that they may equally resemble the heraldic bearings of\r\nsome order or of some individuals of Western Europe.\r\n\r\nThough some of the designs are very indifferent, yet there are others\r\nwhich display considerable ability, and several of the single figures\r\nare decidedly superior to any that are contained in the other\r\nblock-books. They are drawn with greater vigour and feeling; and though\r\nthe designs of the Biblia Pauperum show a greater knowledge of the\r\nmechanism of art, yet the best of them, in point of expression and\r\nemphatic marking of character, are inferior to the best in the\r\nApocalypse.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the engraving, the cuts are executed in the simplest\r\nmanner, as there is not the least attempt at shading, by means of cross\r\nlines or hatchings, to be perceived in any one of the designs. The most\r\ndifficult part of the engraver’s task, supposing the drawings to have\r\nbeen made by another person, would be the cutting of the letters, which\r\nin several of the subjects must have occupied a considerable portion of\r\ntime, and have required no small degree of care. The following is a\r\nreduced copy of the first cut.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the upper portion of the subject, St. John is seen addressing four\r\npersons, three men and a woman; and the text at the top informs us of\r\nthe success of his ministry: “_Conversi ab idolis, per predicationem\r\nbeati Johannis, Drusiana et ceteri._”--“By the preaching of St. John,\r\nDrusiana and others are withdrawn from their idols.” The letter +a+, a\r\nlittle above the saint’s outstretched hand, indicates that the cut is\r\nthe first of the series. In the lower compartment St. John is seen\r\nbaptizing Drusiana, who, as she stands naked in the font, is of very\r\nsmall size compared with the saint. The situation in which Drusiana is\r\nplaced might be alleged in support of their peculiar tenets, either by\r\nthe Baptists, who advocate immersion as the proper mode of administering\r\nthe rite, or by those who consider sprinkling as sufficient; but in each\r\ncase with a difficulty which it would not be easy to explain: for if\r\nDrusiana were to be baptized by immersion, the font is too small to\r\nallow her to be dipped overhead; and if the rite were to be administered\r\nby mere sprinkling, why is she standing naked in the font? To the right\r\nof the cut are several figures, two of whom are provided with axes, who\r\nseem wishful to break open the door of the chapel in which St. John and\r\nhis proselyte are seen. The inscription above their heads lets us know\r\nthat they are--“_Cultores ydolorum explorantes facta ejus_;”--\r\n“Worshippers of idols watching the saint’s proceedings.”\r\n\r\nThe following cut is a copy of the eighteenth of the Apocalypse, which\r\nis illustrative of the XIth and XIIIth chapters of Revelations. The\r\nupper portion represents the execution of the two witnesses of the Lord,\r\nwho are in the tablet named Enoch and Helyas, by the command of the\r\nbeast which ascendeth out of the bottomless pit, and which is\r\nAntichrist. He is seen issuing his commands for the execution of the\r\nwitnesses; and the face of the executioner who has just used his sword,\r\nand who is looking towards him with an expression of brutal exultation,\r\nmight have served Albert Durer for that of the mocker in his cut of\r\nChrist crowned with thorns.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe inscription to the right, is the 7th verse of the XIth chapter, with\r\nthe names of Enoch and Helyas inserted as those of the two witnesses:\r\n“_Cum finierunt Enoch et Helyas testimonium suum, bestia quæ ascendit de\r\nabisso faciet contra eos bellum, et vincet eos et occidet illos_.” In\r\nour translation the verse is rendered thus: “And when they shall have\r\nfinished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless\r\npit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them and kill them.”\r\n\r\nThe tablet to the left contains the following inscription: “_Et jacebunt\r\ncorpora eorum in plateis, et non sinent poni in monumentis_.” It is\r\nformed of two passages, in the 8th and 9th verses of the XIth chapter of\r\nRevelations, which are thus rendered in our version of the Bible: “And\r\ntheir dead bodies shall lie in the street, . . . and they of the people\r\n. . . shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.”\r\n\r\nIn the lower compartment Antichrist is seen working his miracles,\r\nuprooting the two olive trees, typical of the two witnesses whom he had\r\ncaused to be slain.[II-40] Two of his followers are seen kneeling as if\r\nworshipping him, while more to the left are the supporters of the true\r\nfaith delivered into the hands of executioners. The design is\r\nillustrative of the XIIIth chapter of Revelations. The following is the\r\ninscription above the figure of Antichrist:--“_Hic facit Antichristus\r\nmiracula sua, et credentes in ipsum honorat, et incredentes variis\r\ninterficit pœnis_.”--“Here Antichrist is performing his miracles,\r\nhonouring those who believe in him, and putting the incredulous to death\r\nby various punishments.” The leaves of the trees which Antichrist has\r\nmiraculously uprooted are extremely like those of the tree of life\r\nengraved in one of the cuts of the Biblia Pauperum, and of which a copy\r\nwill be found in a subsequent page.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-40: Revelations, chap. xi. verses 3d and 4th.]\r\n\r\nIn several of the cuts, the typical expressions which occur in the texts\r\nare explained. Thus, in cut eighth, we are informed that “_Stolæ albæ\r\nanimarum gloriam designant_.”--“The white vestments denote the glory of\r\ndeparted souls.” In the lower compartment of the same cut, the “_cæli\r\nrecessio_”--“the opening of the heavens”--is explained to be the\r\ncommunication of the Bible to the Gentiles. In the lower compartment of\r\nthe ninth cut, “much incense” is said to signify the precepts of the\r\nGospel; the “censers,” the hearts of the Apostles; and the “golden\r\naltar,” the Church.\r\n\r\nThe next block-book which demands notice is that named “Historia seu\r\nProvidentia Virginis Mariæ, ex Cantico Canticorum:” that is, “The\r\nHistory or Prefiguration of the Virgin Mary, from the Song of Songs.” It\r\nis of small-folio size, and consists of sixteen leaves, printed on one\r\nside only by means of friction; and the ink is of a dark brown,\r\napproaching nearly to black. Each impressed page contains two subjects,\r\none above the other; the total number of subjects in the book is,\r\nconsequently, thirty-two.\r\n\r\nOf this book, according to the observations of Heineken, there are two\r\neditions; which, from variations noticed by him in the explanatory text,\r\nare evidently from different blocks; but, as the designs are precisely\r\nthe same, it is certain that the one has been copied from the\r\nother.[II-41] That which he considers to be the first edition, has, in\r\nhis opinion, been engraved in Germany; the other, he thinks, was a copy\r\nof the original, executed by some engraver in Holland. The principal\r\nground on which he determines the priority of the editions is, that in\r\nthe one the text is much more correctly given than in the other; and he\r\nthence concludes that the most correct would be the second. In this\r\nopinion I concur; not that his rule will universally hold good, but that\r\nin this case the conclusion which he has drawn seems the most probable.\r\nThe designs, it is admitted, are precisely the same; and as the cuts of\r\nthe one would in all probability be engraved from tracings or transfers\r\nof the other, it is not likely that we should find such a difference in\r\nthe text of the two editions if that of the first were correct.\r\nA wood-engraver--on this point I speak from experience--would be much\r\nmore likely to commit literal errors in copying manuscript, than to\r\ndeviate in cutting a fac-simile from a correct impression. Had the text\r\nof the first edition been correct,--considering that the designs of the\r\none edition are exact copies of those of the other,--it is probable that\r\nthe text of both would have been more nearly alike. But as there are\r\nseveral errors in the text of the first edition, it is most likely that\r\nmany of them would be discovered and corrected by the person at whose\r\ninstance the designs were copied for the second. Diametrically opposite\r\nto this conclusion is that of Mr. Ottley, who argues as follows:[II-42]\r\n“Heineken endeavours to draw another argument in favour of the\r\noriginality of the edition possessed by Pertusati, Verdussen, and the\r\nBodleian library, from the various errors, in that edition, in the Latin\r\ninscriptions on the scrolls; which, he says, are corrected in the other\r\nedition. But it is evident that this circumstance makes in favour of an\r\nopposite conclusion. The artist who originally invented the work must\r\nhave been well acquainted with Latin, since it is, in fact, no other\r\nthan an union of many of the most beautiful verses of the Book of\r\nCanticles, with a series of designs illustrative of the divine mysteries\r\nsupposed to be revealed in that sacred poem; and, consequently, we have\r\nreason to consider that edition the original in which the inscriptions\r\nare given with the most correctness; and to ascribe the gross blunders\r\nin the other to the ignorance of some ordinary wood-engraver by whom the\r\nwork was copied.” Even granting the assumption that the engraver of the\r\nedition, supposed by Mr. Ottley to be the first, was well acquainted\r\nwith Latin, and that he who engraved the presumed second did not\r\nunderstand a word of that language, yet it by no means follows that the\r\nlatter could not make a correct tracing of the engraved text lying\r\nbefore him. Because a draughtsman is unacquainted with a language, it\r\nwould certainly be most erroneous to infer that he would be incapable of\r\ncopying the characters correctly. Besides, though it does not benefit\r\nhis argument a whit, it is surely assuming too much to assert that the\r\nartist who made the designs also selected the texts, and that he _must_\r\nhave been well acquainted with Latin; and that he who executed Mr.\r\nOttley’s presumed second edition was some ignorant ordinary\r\nwood-engraver. Did the artists who executed the fac-similes in Mr.\r\nOttley’s work, or in Dr. Dibdin’s “Bibliotheca Spenceriana,” understand\r\nthe abbreviated Latin which in many instances they had to engrave; and\r\ndid they in consequence of their ignorance of that language copy\r\nincorrectly the original texts and sentences which were before them?\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-41: Idée Générale, p. 376.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-42: Inquiry, vol. i. p. 140.]\r\n\r\nIn a copy which Heineken considers to be of the second edition,\r\nbelonging to the city of Harlem, that writer observed the following\r\ninscription, from a wood block, impressed, as I understand him, at the\r\ntop of the first cut. “+Dit is die voersinicheit va Marie der mod .\r\ngodes . en is gehete in lath+ . _Cāti._” This inscription--which\r\nHeineken says is “en langue Flamande, ou plûtôt en Plât-Alemand”--may be\r\nexpressed in English as follows: “This is the prefiguration of Mary the\r\nmother of God, and is in Latin named the Canticles.” Heineken expresses\r\nno doubt of this inscription being genuine, though he makes use of it as\r\nan argument in support of his opinion, that the copy in which it occurs\r\nwas one of later edition; “for it is well known,” he observes, “that the\r\nearliest editions of printed books are without titles, and more\r\nespecially those of block-books.” As this inscription, however, has been\r\nfound in the Harlem copy only, I am inclined to agree with Mr. Ottley in\r\nconsidering it as a silly fraud devised by some of the compatriots of\r\nCoster for the purpose of establishing a fact which it is, in reality,\r\nmuch better calculated to overthrow.[II-43]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-43: Inquiry, p. 140.]\r\n\r\nHeineken, who appears to have had more knowledge than taste on the\r\nsubject of art, declares the History of the Virgin to be “the most\r\nGothic of all the block-books; that it is different from them both in\r\nthe style of the designs and of the engraving; and that the figures are\r\nvery like the ancient sculptures in the churches of Germany.” If by the\r\nterm “Gothic” he means rude and tasteless, I differ with him entirely;\r\nfor, though there be great sameness in the subjects, yet the figures,\r\ngenerally, are more gracefully designed than those of any other\r\nblock-book that I have seen. Compared with them, those of the Biblia\r\nPauperum and the Speculum might be termed “Gothic” indeed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe above group,--from that which Heineken considers the first\r\nedition,--in which the figures are of the size of the originals, is\r\ntaken from the seventh subject in Mr. Ottley’s enumeration;[II-44] that\r\nis, from the upper portion of the fourth cut.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-44: Inquiry, p. 144, vol. i.]\r\n\r\nThe text is the 14th verse of the 1st chapter of the Song of Solomon:\r\n“_Botrus cipri dilectus meus inter vineas enngadi_;” which in our Bible\r\nis translated: “My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the\r\nvineyards of En-gedi.” In every cut the female figures are almost\r\nprecisely the same, and the drapery and the expression scarcely vary.\r\nFrom the easy and graceful attitudes of his female figures, as well as\r\nfrom the manner in which they are clothed, the artist may be considered\r\nas the Stothard of his day.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe two preceding subjects are impressed on the second leaf, in the\r\norder in which they are here represented, forming Nos. 3 and 4 in Mr.\r\nOttley’s enumeration. They are reduced copies from the originals in the\r\nfirst edition, and afford a correct idea of a complete page.[II-45]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-45: The copy from which the preceding specimens are\r\n    given was formerly the property of the Rev. C. M. Cracherode, by\r\n    whom it was left, with the rest of his valuable collection of\r\n    books, to the British Museum.]\r\n\r\nOn the scroll to the left, in the upper subject, the words are intended\r\nfor--“_Trahe me, post te curremus in odore unguentorum tuorum_.” They\r\nare to be found in the 4th and 3rd verses of the 1st chapter of the Song\r\nof Solomon. In our Bible the phrases are translated as follows: “Draw\r\nme, we will run after thee, . . . [in] the savour of thy good\r\nointments.” In the scroll to the right, the inscription is from the 14th\r\nverse of the IInd chapter: “_Sonet vox tua in auribus meis, vox enim tua\r\ndulcis et facies tua decora_:” which is thus rendered in our Bible: “Let\r\nme hear thy voice, for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is\r\ncomely.”\r\n\r\nOn the scroll to the left, in the lower compartment, is the following\r\ninscription, from verse 10th, chapter IInd: “_En dilectus meus loquitur\r\nmihi, Surge, propera, amica mea_:” in our Bible translated thus: “My\r\nbeloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come\r\naway.” The inscription on the scroll to the right is from 1st verse of\r\nchapter IVth: “_Quam pulchra es amica mea, quam pulchra es! Oculi tui\r\ncolumbarum, absque eo quod intrinsecus latet._” The translation of this\r\npassage in our Bible does not correspond with that of the Vulgate in the\r\nlast clause: “Behold thou art fair, my love; behold thou art fair; thou\r\nhast doves’ eyes _within thy locks_.”\r\n\r\nThe style in which the cuts of the History of the Virgin are engraved\r\nindicates a more advanced state of art than those in the Apocalypse. The\r\nfield of each cut is altogether better filled, and the subjects contain\r\nmore of what an engraver would term “work;” and shadowing, which is\r\nrepresented by courses of single lines, is also introduced. The\r\nback-grounds are better put in, and throughout the whole book may be\r\nobserved several indications of a perception of natural beauty; such as\r\nthe occasional introduction of trees, flowers, and animals.\r\nA vine-stock, with its trellis, is happily and tastefully introduced at\r\nfolio 4 and folio 10; and at folio 12 a goat and two sheep, drawn and\r\nengraved with considerable ability, are perceived in the background.\r\nSeveral other instances of a similar kind might be pointed out as proofs\r\nthat the artist, whoever he might be, was no unworthy precursor of\r\nAlbert Durer.\r\n\r\nFrom a fancied delicacy in the engraving of the cuts of the History of\r\nthe Virgin, Dr. Dibdin was led to conjecture that they were the\r\n“production of some metallic substance, and not struck off from wooden\r\nblocks.”[II-46] This speculation is the result of a total ignorance of\r\nthe practical part of wood engraving, and of the capabilities of the\r\nart; and the very process which is suggested involves a greater\r\ndifficulty than that which is sought to be removed. But, in fact, so far\r\nfrom the engravings being executed with a delicacy unattainable on wood,\r\nthere is nothing in them--so far as the mere cutting of fancied delicate\r\nlines is concerned--which a mere apprentice of the present day, using\r\nvery ordinary tools, would not execute as well, either on pear-tree,\r\napple-tree, or beech, the kinds of wood on which the earliest engravings\r\nare supposed to have been made. Working on box, there is scarcely a line\r\nin all the series which a skilful wood-engraver could not split. In a\r\nsimilar manner Mr. John Landseer conjectured from the frequent\r\noccurrence of cross-hatching in the wood engravings of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, that they, instead of being cut on wood, had in reality been\r\nexecuted on type-metal; although, as is known to every wood-engraver,\r\nthe execution of such hatchings on type-metal would be more difficult\r\nthan on wood. When, in refutation of his opinion, he was shown\r\nimpressions from such presumed blocks or plates of type-metal, which\r\nfrom certain marks in the impressions had been evidently worm-eaten,\r\nhe--in the genuine style of an “ingenious disputant” who could\r\n\r\n  “Confute the exciseman and puzzle the vicar,--”\r\n\r\nabandoned type-metal, and fortified his “_stubborn_ opinion behind\r\n_vegetable putties_ or pastes that are capable of being hardened--or any\r\nsubstance that is capable of being _worm-eaten_.”[II-47] Such “commenta\r\nopinionum”--the mere figments of conjecture--only deserve notice in\r\nconsequence of their extravagance.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-46: Bibliotheca Spenceriana, vol. i. p. 36. Mr.\r\n    Ottley cites the passage at p. 139, vol i. of his Inquiry, for the\r\n    purpose of expressing his dissent from the theory.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-47: Landseer’s Lectures on the Art of Engraving, pp.\r\n    201-205, 8vo. London, 1807.]\r\n\r\nThe History of the Virgin, in the same manner as every other ancient\r\nblock-book, has been claimed for Coster by those who ascribe to him the\r\ninvention both of wood engraving and printing with moveable types; but\r\nif even the churchwarden of St. Bavon’s in Harlem ever had handled a\r\ngraver, or made a design, or if he was even the cause of wood-cuts being\r\nengraved by others,--every one of which assertions I very much doubt,--I\r\nshould yet feel strongly inclined to believe that the work in question\r\nwas the production of an artist residing either in Suabia or Alsace.\r\n\r\nScarcely any person who has had an opportunity of examining the works of\r\nMartin Schön, or Schöngauer,--one of the earliest German copper-plate\r\nengravers,--who is said to have died in 1486, can fail, on looking over\r\nthe designs in the History of the Virgin, to notice the resemblance\r\nwhich many of his female figures bear to those in the above-named work.\r\nThe similarity is too striking to have been accidental. I am inclined to\r\nbelieve that Martin Schön must have studied--and diligently too--the\r\nsubjects contained in the History, or that he had received his\r\nprofessional education in a school which might possibly be founded by\r\nthe artist who designed and engraved the wood-cuts in question, or under\r\na master who had thoroughly adopted their style.\r\n\r\nMartin Schön was a native of Colmar in Alsace, where he was born about\r\n1453, but was a descendant of a family, probably of artists, which\r\noriginally belonged to Augsburg. Heineken and Von Murr both bear\r\ntestimony,[II-48] though indirectly, to the resemblance which his works\r\nbear to the designs in the History of the Virgin. The former states that\r\nthe figures in the History are very like the ancient sculptures in the\r\nchurches of Germany, and Von Murr asserts that such sculptures were\r\nprobably Martin Schön’s models.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-48: Heineken, Idée Générale, p. 374. Von Murr,\r\n    Journal, 2 Theil, S. 43.]\r\n\r\nIn two or three of the designs in the History of the Virgin several\r\nshields of arms are introduced, either borne by figures, or suspended\r\nfrom a wall. As the heraldic emblems on such shields were not likely to\r\nbe entirely suggested by the mere fancy of the artist, I think that most\r\nof them will be found to belong to Germany rather than to Holland; and\r\nthe charge on one of them,--two fish back to back, which is rather\r\nremarkable, and by no means common, is one of the quarterings of the\r\nformer Counts of Wirtemberg, the very district in which I am inclined to\r\nthink the work was executed. I moreover fancy that in one of the cuts I\r\ncan perceive an allusion to the Council of Basle, which in 1439 elected\r\nAmadeus of Savoy as Pope, under the title of Felix V, in opposition to\r\nEugene IV. In order to afford those who are better acquainted with the\r\nsubject an opportunity of judging for themselves, and of making further\r\ndiscoveries which may support my opinions if well-founded, or which may\r\ncorrect them if erroneous, I shall give copies of all the shields of\r\narms which occur in the book. The following cut of four figures--a pope,\r\ntwo cardinals, and a bishop--occurs in the upper compartment of the\r\nnineteenth folio. The shield charged with a black eagle also occurs in\r\nthe same compartment.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe preceding figures are seen looking over the battlements of a house\r\nin which the Virgin, typical of the Church, is seen in bed. On a scroll\r\nis inscribed the following sentence, from the Song of Solomon, chap.\r\niii. v. 2: “_Surgam et circumibo civitatem; per vicos et plateas queram\r\nquem diligit anima mea_:” which is thus translated in our Bible: “I will\r\nrise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I\r\nwill seek him whom my soul loveth.” In the same design, the Virgin, with\r\nher three attendants, are seen in a street, where two men on horseback\r\nappear taking away her mantle. One of the men bears upon his shield the\r\nfigure of a black eagle, the same as that which appears underneath the\r\nwood-cut above given. Upon a scroll is this inscription, from Solomon’s\r\nSong, chapter V. verse 7: “_Percusserunt et vulneraverunt me, tulerunt\r\npallium meum custodes murorum_.” In our Bible the entire verse is thus\r\ntranslated: “The watchmen that went about the city found me; they smote\r\nme, they wounded me: the keepers of the walls took away my veil from\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nAs the incidents in the life of the Virgin, described in the Canticles,\r\nwere assumed by commentators to be typical of the history of the Church,\r\nI am inclined to think that the above cut may contain an allusion to the\r\ndisputes between Pope Eugene IV. and the Council assembled at Basle in\r\n1439. The passage in the first inscription, “I will seek him whom my\r\nsoul loveth,” might be very appropriately applied to a council which\r\nprofessed to represent the Church, and which had chosen for itself a new\r\nhead. The second inscription would be equally descriptive of the\r\ntreatment which, in the opinion of the same council, the Church had\r\nreceived from Eugene IV, whom they declared to be deposed, because “he\r\nwas a disturber of the peace and union of the Church; a schismatic and a\r\nheretic; guilty of simony; perjured and incorrigible.” On the shield\r\nborne by the figure of a pope wearing a triple crown, is a fleur-de-lis;\r\nbut whether or no this flower formed part of the armorial distinctions\r\nof Amadeus Duke of Savoy, whom the council chose for their new pope,\r\nI have not been able to ascertain. The lion borne by the second figure,\r\na cardinal, is too general a cognizance to be assigned to any particular\r\nstate or city. The charge on the shield borne by the third figure, also\r\na cardinal, I cannot make out. The cross-keys on the bishop’s shield are\r\nthe arms of the city of Ratisbon.\r\n\r\nThe following shields are borne by angels, who appear above the\r\nbattlements of a wall in the lower compartment of folio 4, forming the\r\neighth subject in Mr. Ottley’s enumeration.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn these I have nothing to remark further than that the double-headed\r\neagle is the arms of the German empire. The other three I leave to be\r\ndeciphered by others. The second, with an indented chief, and something\r\nlike a rose in the field, will be found, I am inclined to think, to be\r\nthe arms of some town or city in Wirtemberg or Alsace. I give the three\r\ninscriptions here, not that they are likely to throw any light on the\r\nsubject, but because the third has not hitherto been deciphered. They\r\nare all from the IVth chapter of the Song of Solomon. The first is from\r\nverse 12: “_Ortus conclusus est soror, mea sposa; ortus conclusus, fons\r\nsignatus_:” in our translation of the Bible: “A garden enclosed is my\r\nsister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.” The second is\r\nfrom verse 15: “_Fons ortorum, puteus aquarum vivencium quæ fluunt\r\nimpetu de Lybano_:” in our Bible: “A fountain of gardens, a well of\r\nliving waters, and streams from Lebanon.” The third is from verse 16:\r\n“_Surge Aquilo; veni Auster, perfla ortum et fluant aromata illius_:” in\r\nour Bible: “Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my\r\ngarden, that the spices thereof may flow out.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the upper division of folio 15, which is the twenty-ninth subject in\r\nMr. Ottley’s enumeration, the above shields occur. They are suspended on\r\nthe walls of a tower, which is represented by an inscription as “the\r\narmoury whereon hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty\r\nmen.”[II-49]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-49: Song of Solomon, chap. iv. verse 4.]\r\n\r\nOn the first four I shall make no remark beyond calling the attention of\r\nthose skilled in German heraldry to the remarkable charge in the first\r\nshield, which appears something like a cray-fish. The sixth, “two trouts\r\nhauriant and addorsed,” is one of the quarterings of the house of\r\nWirtemberg as lords of Mompelgard. The seventh is charged with three\r\ncrowns, the arms of the city of Cologne. The charge of the eighth I take\r\nto be three cinquefoils, which are one of the quarterings of the family\r\nof Aremberg. The cross-keys in the ninth are the arms of the city of\r\nRatisbon.\r\n\r\nThe four following shields occur in the lower division of folio 15. They\r\nare borne by men in armour standing by the side of a bed. On a scroll is\r\nthe following inscription, from the 7th and 8th verses of the third\r\nchapter of Solomon’s Song. “_En lectulum Salomonis sexaginta fortes\r\nambiunt, omnes tenentes gladios_:” in our Bible: “Behold his bed, which\r\nis Solomon’s; three score valiant men are about it . . . . . they all\r\nhold swords.”\r\n\r\nThe first three of the shields on the following page I shall leave to be\r\nassigned by others. The fourth, which is charged with a rose, was the\r\narms of Hagenau, a town in Alsace.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs so little is known respecting the country where, and the precise time\r\nwhen, the principal block-books appeared,--of which the History of the\r\nVirgin is one,--I think every particular, however trifling, which may be\r\nlikely to afford even a gleam of light, deserving of notice. It is for\r\nthis reason that I have given the different shields contained in this\r\nand the preceding pages; not in the belief that I have made any\r\nimportant discovery, or established any considerable facts; but with the\r\ndesire of directing to this subject the attention of others, whose\r\nfurther inquiries and comparisons may perhaps establish such a perfect\r\nidentity between the arms of a particular district, and those contained\r\nin the volume, as may determine the probable locality of the place where\r\nit was executed. The coincidences which I have noticed were not sought\r\nfor. Happening to be turning over Sebastian Munster’s Cosmography when a\r\ncopy of the History of the Virgin was before me, I observed that the two\r\nfish in the arms of the Counts of Wirtemberg,[II-50] and those in the\r\n15th folio of the History, were the same. The other instances of\r\ncorrespondence were also discovered without search, from having\r\noccasionally, in tracing the progress of wood engraving, to refer to\r\nMerian’s Topographia.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-50: Those arms are to be seen in Sebastiana Munsteri\r\n    Cosmographia, cap. De Regione Wirtenbergensi, p. 592. Folio,\r\n    Basiliæ, apud Henrichum Petri, 1554.]\r\n\r\nConsidering the thickness of the paper on which the block-books are\r\nprinted,--if I may apply this term to them,--and the thin-bodied ink\r\nwhich has been used. I am at a loss to conceive how the early\r\nwood-engravers have contrived to take off their impressions so\r\ncorrectly; for in all the block-books which I have seen, where friction\r\nhas evidently been the means employed to obtain the impression, I have\r\nonly noticed two subjects in which the lines appeared double in\r\nconsequence of the shifting of the paper. From the want of body in the\r\nink, which appears in the Apocalypse to have been little more than\r\nwater-colour, it is not likely the paper could be used in a damp state,\r\notherwise the ink would run or spread; and, even if this difficulty did\r\nnot exist, the paper in a damp state could not have borne the excessive\r\nrubbing which it appears to have received in order to obtain the\r\nimpression.[II-51] Even with such printer’s ink as is used in the\r\npresent day,--which being tenacious, renders the paper in taking an\r\nimpression by means of friction much less liable to slip or shift,--it\r\nwould be difficult to obtain clear impressions on thick paper from\r\nblocks the size of those which form each page of the Apocalypse, or the\r\nHistory of the Virgin.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-51: The backs of many of the old wood-cuts which have\r\n    been taken by means of friction, still appear bright in\r\n    consequence of the rubbing which the paper has sustained in order\r\n    to obtain the impression. They would not have this appearance if\r\n    the paper had been used in a damp state.]\r\n\r\nMr. Ottley, however, states that no less than two pages of the History\r\nof the Virgin have been engraved on the same block. His observations on\r\nthis subject are as follows: “Upon first viewing this work, I was of\r\nopinion that each of the designs contained in it was engraved upon a\r\nseparate block of wood: but, upon a more careful examination, I have\r\ndiscovered that the contents of each two pages--that is, four\r\nsubjects--were engraved on the same block. The number of wooden blocks,\r\ntherefore, from which the whole was printed, was only eight. This is\r\nproved in the first two pages of the copy before me;[II-52] where, near\r\nthe bottom of the two upper subjects, the block appears to have been\r\nbroken in two, in a horizontal direction,--after it was engraved,--and\r\njoined together again; although not with such exactness but that the\r\ntraces of the operation clearly show themselves. The traces of a similar\r\naccident are still more apparent in the last block, containing the Nos.\r\n29, 30, 31, 32. The whole work was, therefore, printed on eight sheets\r\nof paper from the same number of engraved blocks, the first four\r\nsubjects being printed from the same block upon the same sheet,--and so\r\non with the rest; and, indeed, in Lord Spencer’s copy, each sheet, being\r\nmounted upon a guard, distinctly shows itself entire.”[II-53]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-52: This must have been a copy of that which Heineken\r\n    calls the second edition; no such appearances of a fracture or\r\n    joining are to be seen in the first.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-53: Inquiry, p. 142.]\r\n\r\nThe appearance of a corresponding fracture in two adjacent pages would\r\ncertainly render it likely that both were engraved on the same block;\r\nthough I should like to have an opportunity of satisfying myself by\r\ninspection whether such appearances are really occasioned by a fracture\r\nor not; for it is rather singular that such appearances should be\r\nobservable on the _first_ and the _last_ blocks only. I always\r\nreluctantly speculate, except on something like sufficient grounds; but\r\nas I have not seen a copy of the edition to which Mr. Ottley refers,\r\nI beg to ask if the traces of supposed fracture in the last two pages do\r\nnot correspond with those in the first two? and if so, would it not be\r\nequally reasonable to infer that eight subjects instead of four were\r\nengraved on the same block? A block containing only two pages would be\r\nabout seventeen inches by ten, allowing for inner margins; and to obtain\r\nclear impressions from it by means of friction, on dry thick paper, and\r\nwith mere water-colour ink, would be a task of such difficulty that I\r\ncannot conceive how it could be performed. No traces of points by which\r\nthe paper might be kept steady on the block are perceptible; and I\r\nunhesitatingly assert that no wood-engraver of the present day could by\r\nmeans of friction take clear impressions from such a block on equally\r\nthick paper, and using mere distemper instead of printer’s ink. As the\r\nimpressions in the History of the Virgin have unquestionably been taken\r\nby means of friction, it is evident to me that if the blocks were of the\r\nsize that Mr. Ottley supposes, the old wood-engravers, who did not use a\r\npress, must have resorted to some contrivance to keep the paper steady,\r\nwith which we are now unacquainted.\r\n\r\nHeineken describes an edition of the Apocalypse consisting of\r\nforty-eight leaves, with cuts on one side only, which, when bound, form\r\na volume of three “_gatherings_,” or collections, each containing\r\nsixteen leaves. Each of these gatherings is formed by eight folio sheets\r\nfolded in the middle, and placed one within the other, so that the cuts\r\nare worked off in the following manner: On the outer sheet of the\r\ngathering, forming the first and the sixteenth leaf, the first and the\r\nsixteenth cuts are impressed, so that when the sheet is folded they face\r\neach other, and the first and the last pages are left blank. In a\r\nsimilar manner the 2nd and 15th; the 3d and 14th; the 4th and 13th; the\r\n5th and 12th; the 6th and 11th; the 7th and 10th, and the 8th and 9th,\r\nare, each pair respectively, impressed on the same side of the same\r\nsheet. These sheets when folded for binding are then placed in such a\r\nmanner that the first is opposite the second; the third opposite the\r\nfourth, and so on throughout the whole sixteen. Being arranged in this\r\nmanner, two cuts and two blank pages occur alternately. The reason for\r\nthis mode of arrangement was, that the blank pages might be pasted\r\ntogether, and the cuts thus appear as if one were impressed on the back\r\nof another. A familiar illustration of this mode of folding, adopted by\r\nthe early wood-engravers before they were accustomed to impress their\r\ncuts on both sides of a leaf, is afforded by forming a sheet of paper\r\ninto a little book of sixteen leaves, and numbering the second and third\r\npages 1 and 2, leaving two pages blank; then numbering the fifth and\r\nsixth 3 and 4, and so to No. 16, which will stand opposite to No. 15,\r\nand have its back, forming the outer page of the gathering, unimpressed.\r\n\r\nOf all the block-books, that which is now commonly called “BIBLIA\r\nPAUPERUM,”--the Bible of the Poor,--is most frequently referred to as a\r\nspecimen of that kind of printing from wood-blocks which preceded\r\ntypography, or printing by means of moveable characters or types. This\r\ntitle, however, has given rise to an error which certain learned\r\nbibliographers have without the least examination adopted, and have\r\nafterwards given to the public considerably enlarged, at least, if not\r\ncorrected.[II-54] It has been gravely stated that this book, whose text\r\nis in abbreviated Latin, was printed for the use of the _poor_ in an age\r\nwhen even the _rich_ could scarcely read their own language. Manuscripts\r\nof the Bible were certainly at that period both scarce and costly, and\r\nnot many individuals even of high rank were possessed of a copy; but to\r\nconclude that the first editions of the so-called “Biblia Pauperum” were\r\nengraved and printed for the use of the poor, appears to be about as\r\nlegitimate an inference as to conclude that, in the present day, the\r\nreprints of the Roxburghe club were published for the benefit of the\r\npoor who could not afford to purchase the original editions. That a\r\nmerchant or a wealthy trader might occasionally become the purchaser of\r\n“Biblia Pauperum,” I am willing to admit,--though I am of opinion that\r\nthe book was never expressly intended for the laity;--but that it should\r\nbe printed for the use of the poor, I cannot bring myself to believe. If\r\nthe poor of Germany in the fifteenth century had the means of purchasing\r\nsuch books, and were capable of reading them, I can only say that they\r\nmust have had more money to spare than their descendants, and have been\r\nmore learned than most of the rich people throughout Europe in the\r\npresent day. If the accounts which we have of the state of knowledge\r\nabout 1450 be correct, the monk or friar who could read and expound such\r\na work must have been esteemed as a person of considerable literary\r\nattainments.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-54: “It is a manual or kind of Catechism of the\r\n    Bible,” says the Rev. T. H. Horne, “for the use of young persons\r\n    and of the common people, whence it derives its name _Biblia\r\n    Pauperum_,--_the Bible of the Poor_,--who were thus enabled to\r\n    acquire, at a comparatively low price, an imperfect knowledge of\r\n    some of the events recorded in the Scripture.”--Introduction to\r\n    the Critical Study of the Scriptures, vol. ii. p. 224-5. The young\r\n    and the poor must have been comparatively learned at that period\r\n    to be able to read cramped Latin, when many a priest could\r\n    scarcely spell his breviary.]\r\n\r\nThe name “Biblia Pauperum” was unknown to Schelhorn and Schœpflin, and\r\nwas not adopted by Meerman. Schelhorn, who was the first that published\r\na fac-simile of one of the pages engraved on wood, gives it no\r\ndistinctive name; but merely describes it as “a book which contained in\r\ntext and figures certain histories and prophecies of the Old Testament,\r\nwhich, in the author’s judgment, were figurative of Christ, and of the\r\nworks performed by him for the salvation of mankind.”[II-55] Schœpflin\r\ncalls it, “Vaticinia Veteris Testamenti de Christo;”[II-56]--“Prophecies\r\nof the Old Testament concerning Christ;” but neither this title, nor the\r\ndescription of Schelhorn, is sufficiently comprehensive; for the book\r\ncontains not only prophecies and typical figures from the Old Testament,\r\nbut also passages and subjects selected from the New. The title which\r\nMeerman gives to it is more accurately descriptive of the contents:\r\n“Figuræ typicæ Veteris atque antitypicæ Novi Testamenti, seu Historia\r\nJesu Christi in figuris;” that is, “Typical figures of the Old Testament\r\nand antitypical of the New, or the History of Jesus Christ pictorially\r\nrepresented.”[II-57]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-55: J. G. Schelhorn, Amœnitates Literariæ, tom. iv.\r\n    p. 297. 8vo. Francofurt. & Lips. 1730. Lichtenberger, Initia\r\n    Typographica, p. 4, says erroneously, that Schelhorn’s fac-simile\r\n    was engraved on copper. It is on wood, as Schelhorn himself states\r\n    at p. 296.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-56: J. D. Schœpflin, Vindiciæ Typographicæ, p. 7,\r\n    4to. Argentorati, 1760.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-57: Ger. Meerman, Origines Typographicæ, P. 1,\r\n    p. 241. 4to. Hagæ Comit. 1765.]\r\n\r\nHeineken appears to have been the first who gave to this book the name\r\n“Biblia Pauperum,” as it was in his opinion the most appropriate; “the\r\nfigures being executed for the purpose of giving a knowledge of the\r\nBible to those who could not afford to purchase a manuscript copy of the\r\nScriptures.”[II-58] This reason for the name is not, however, a good\r\none: for, according to his own statement, the only copy which he ever\r\nsaw with the title or inscription “Biblia Pauperum,” was a manuscript on\r\nvellum of the fourteenth century, in which the figures were drawn and\r\ncoloured by hand.[II-59] Meerman, however, though without adopting the\r\ntitle, had previously noticed the same manuscript, which in his opinion\r\nwas as old as the twelfth or thirteenth century. As the word “Pauperum”\r\nformed part of the title of the book long before presumed cheap copies\r\nwere printed from wood-blocks for the use of the poor, it could not be\r\npeculiarly appropriate as the title of an illumined manuscript on\r\nvellum, which the poor could as little afford to purchase as they could\r\na manuscript copy of the Bible. In whatever manner the term “poor”\r\nbecame connected with the book, it is clear that the name “Biblia\r\nPauperum” was not given to it in consequence of its being printed at a\r\ncheap rate for circulation among poor people. It is not indeed likely\r\nthat its ancient title ever was “Biblia Pauperum;” while, on the\r\ncontrary, there seems every reason to believe that Heineken had copied\r\nan abridged title and thus given currency to an error.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-58: Idée Générale, p. 292, note.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-59: Camus, speaking of one of those manuscripts\r\n    compared with the block-book, observes: “Ce dernier abrégé\r\n    méritoit bien le nom de BIBLIA PAUPERUM, par comparison aux\r\n    tableaux complets de la Bible que je viens d’indiquer. Des\r\n    ouvrages tels que les tableaux complets ne pouvoient être que\r\n    BIBLIA DIVITUM.”--Notice d’un Livre imprimé à Bamberg en 1462,\r\n    p. 12, note. 4to. Paris, 1800.]\r\n\r\nHeineken says that he observed the inscription, “Incipit Biblia\r\nPauperum,” in a manuscript in the library at Wolfenbuttel, written on\r\nvellum in a Gothic character, which appeared to be of the fourteenth\r\ncentury. The figures, which were badly designed, were coloured in\r\ndistemper, and the explanatory text was in Latin rhyme. It is surprising\r\nthat neither Heineken nor any other bibliographer should have suspected\r\nthat a word was wanting in the above supposed title, more especially as\r\nthe word wanting might have been so readily suggested by another work so\r\nmuch resembling the pretended “Biblia Pauperum” that the one has\r\nfrequently been confounded with the other.[II-60] In the proemium of\r\nthis other work, which is no other than the “Speculum Salvationis,” the\r\nwriter expressly states that he has compiled it “propter pauperes\r\npredicatores,”--for _poor_ preachers.\r\n\r\n  +Predictu’ p’hemiu’ hujus libri de conte’tis compilavi,\r\n  Et p’pter paup’es p’dicatores hoc apponere curavi;\r\n  Qui si forte nequieru’t totum librum sibi co’p’are,\r\n  Possu’t ex ipso p’hemio, si sciu’t p’dicare.+\r\n\r\n  This preface of contents, stating what this book’s about,\r\n  For the sake of all _poor preachers_ I have fairly written out;\r\n  If the purchase of the book entire should be above their reach,\r\n  This preface yet may serve them, if they know but how to preach.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-60: “Entre ces abrégés [de la Bible] on remarque le\r\n    SPECULUM HUMANÆ SALVATIONIS et le BIBLIA PAUPERUM. Ces deux\r\n    ouvrages ont beaucoup d’affinité entre eux pour le volume, le\r\n    choix des histoires, les moralités, la composition des tableaux.\r\n    Ils existent en manuscrits dans plusieurs bibliothèques.”--Camus,\r\n    Notice d’un Livre, &c. p. 12.]\r\n\r\nThat the other book might be called “Biblia Pauperum _Predicatorum_,” in\r\nconsequence of its general use by mendicant preachers, I can readily\r\nbelieve; and no doubt the omission of the word “predicatorum” in the\r\ninscription copied by Heineken has given rise to the popular error, that\r\nthe pretended “Biblia Pauperum” was a kind of cheap pictorial Bible,\r\nespecially intended for the use of the poor. It is, in fact, a series of\r\n“skeleton sermons” ornamented with wood-cuts to warm the preacher’s\r\nimagination, and stored with texts to assist his memory. In speaking of\r\nthis book in future, I shall always refer to it as the “Biblia Pauperum\r\nPredicatorum,”--“the Poor Preachers’ Bible;” for the continuance of its\r\nformer title only tends, in my opinion, to disseminate an error.\r\n\r\nNyerup, who in 1784 published an “Account of such books as were read in\r\nschools in Denmark prior to the Reformation,”[II-61] objected to the\r\ntitle “Biblia Pauperum,” as he had seen portions of a manuscript copy in\r\nwhich the drawings were richly coloured. The title which he preferred\r\nwas BIBLIA TYPICO-HARMONICA. In this objection, however, Camus does not\r\nconcur: “It is not from the embellishments of a single copy,” he\r\nobserves, “that we ought to judge of the current price of a book; and,\r\nbesides, we must not forget to take into consideration the other motives\r\nwhich might suggest the title, ‘Bible of the Poor,’ for we have proofs\r\nthat other abridgments of greater extent were called ‘Poor men’s books.’\r\nSuch is the ‘Biblia Pauperum’ of St. Bonaventure, consisting of extracts\r\nfor the use of _preachers_, and the ‘Dictionarius Pauperum.’ Of the last\r\nthe title is explained in the book itself: ‘Incipit summula omnibus\r\n_verbi divini seminatoribus pernecessaria_.’” It is surprising that\r\nCamus did not perceive that the very titles which he cites militate\r\nagainst the opinion of the “Biblia” being intended for the use of poor\r\n_men_. St. Bonaventure’s work, and the Dictionary, which he refers to as\r\ninstances of “Poor men’s books,” both bear on the very face of them a\r\nrefutation of his opinion, for in the works themselves it is distinctly\r\nstated that they were compiled, not “ad usum pauperum _hominum_;” but\r\n“ad usum pauperum _predicatorum_, et _verbi divini seminatorum_:” not\r\nfor the use of “poor _men_,” but for “poor _preachers_ and _teachers of\r\nthe divine word_.” Camus has unwittingly supplied a club to batter his\r\nown argument to pieces.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-61: “Librorum qui ante Reformationem in scholis Daniæ\r\n    legebantur, Notitia. Hafniæ, 1784;” referred to by Camus, Notice\r\n    d’un Livre, &c. p. 10.]\r\n\r\nOf the “Biblia Pauperum Predicatorum,” there are, according to Heineken,\r\nfive different editions with the text in Latin. Four of them contain\r\neach forty leaves, printed on one side only from wood-blocks by means of\r\nfriction, and which differ from each other in so trifling a degree, that\r\nit is not unlikely that three of them are from the same set of blocks.\r\nThe other edition,--the fifth described by Heineken--contains fifty\r\nleaves, printed in a similar manner, but apparently with the figures\r\ndesigned by a different artist. Besides the above, there are two\r\ndifferent editions, also from wood-blocks, with the text in German: one\r\nwith the date 1470; and the other, 1471 or 1475, for the last numeral\r\nappears as like a 1 as a 5. There are also two editions, one Latin, and\r\nthe other German, with the text printed from moveable types by Albert\r\nPfister, at Bamberg, about 1462.\r\n\r\nWithout pretending to decide on the priority of the first five\r\neditions,--as I have not been able to perceive any sufficient marks from\r\nwhich the order in which they were published might be ascertained,--I\r\nshall here give a brief account of a copy of that edition which Heineken\r\nranks as the third. It is in the King’s Library at the British Museum,\r\nand was formerly in the collection of Monsieur Gaignat, at whose sale it\r\nwas bought for George III.\r\n\r\nIt is a small folio of forty leaves, impressed on one side only, in\r\norder that the blank pages might be pasted together, so that two of the\r\nprinted sides would thus form only one leaf. The order of the first\r\ntwenty pages is indicated by the letters of the alphabet, from +a+ to\r\n+v+, and of the second twenty by the same letters, having as a\r\ndistinguishing mark a point both before and after them, thus: +. a .+ In\r\nthat which Heineken considers the first edition, the letters +n+, +o+,\r\n+r+, +s+, of the second alphabet, making pages 33, 34, 37, and 38, want\r\nthose two distinguishing points, which, according to him, are to be\r\nfound in each of the other three Latin editions of forty pages each. Mr.\r\nOttley has, however, observed that Earl Spencer’s copy wants the\r\npoints,--on each side of the letters +n+, +o+, +r+, +s+, of the second\r\nalphabet,--thus agreeing with that which Heineken calls the first\r\nedition, while in all other respects it answers the description which\r\nthat writer gives of the presumed second. Mr. Ottley says, that Heineken\r\nerrs in asserting that the want of those points on each side of the said\r\nletters is a distinction exclusively belonging to the first edition,\r\nsince the edition called by him the second is likewise without\r\nthem.[II-62] In fact, the variations noticed by Heineken are not only\r\ninsufficient to enable a person to judge of the priority of the\r\neditions, but they are such as might with the greatest ease be\r\nintroduced into a block after a certain number of copies had been taken\r\noff. Those which he considers as distinguishing marks might easily be\r\nbroken away by the burnisher or rubber, and replaced by the insertion of\r\nother pieces, differing in a slight degree. From the trifling variations\r\nnoticed by Heineken[II-63] in the first three editions, it is not\r\nunlikely that they were all taken from the same blocks. Each of the\r\ntriangular ornaments in which he has observed a difference, might easily\r\nbe re-inserted in the event of its being injured in taking an\r\nimpression. The tiara of Moses, in page 35, letter +. p .+ would be\r\npeculiarly liable to accident in taking an impression by friction, and I\r\nam disposed to think that a part of it has been broken off, and that in\r\nrepairing it a trifling alteration has been made in the ornament on its\r\ntop. Heineken, noticing the alteration, has considered it as a criterion\r\nof two different editions, while in all probability it only marks a\r\ntrifling variety in copies taken from the same blocks.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-62: Inquiry, vol. i. p. 129.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-63: Idée Générale, p. 307, 308.]\r\n\r\nOn each page are four portraits,--two at the top, and two at the\r\nbottom,--intended for the prophets, and other holy men, whose writings\r\nare cited in the text. The middle part of the page between each pair of\r\nportraits consists of three compartments, each of which is occupied with\r\na subject from the Old or the New Testament. In the 14th page, however,\r\nletter +o+, two of the compartments--that in the centre, and the\r\nadjoining one to the right--are both occupied by the same subject,\r\nChrist’s entry into Jerusalem. The greatest portion of the explanatory\r\ntext is at the top on each side of the uppermost portraits; and on each\r\nside of those below there is a Leonine, or rhyming Latin, verse.\r\nA similar verse underneath those portraits forms the concluding line of\r\neach page. Texts of Scripture, and moral or explanatory sentences,\r\nhaving reference to the subjects in the three compartments, also appear\r\non scrolls. The following cut, which is a reduced copy of the 14th page,\r\nletter +k+, will afford a better idea of the arrangement of the\r\nsubjects, and of the explanatory texts, than any lengthened description.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this subject--both text and figures--appears intended to\r\ninculcate the necessity of restraining appetite. The inscription to the\r\nright, at the top, contains a reference to the 3rd chapter of Genesis,\r\nwherein there is to be found an account of the temptation and fall of\r\nAdam and Eve, who were induced by the Serpent to taste the forbidden\r\nfruit. This temptation of our first parents through the medium of the\r\npalate, was, as may be gathered from the same inscription, figurative of\r\nthe temptation of Christ after his fasting forty days in the wilderness,\r\nwhen the Devil came to him and said, “If thou be the Son of God, command\r\nthat these stones be made bread.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the inscription to the left, reference is made to the 25th chapter of\r\nGenesis, as containing an account of Esau, who, in consequence of his\r\nunrestrained appetite, sold his birth-right for a mess of pottage.\r\n\r\nIn the compartments in the middle of the page, are three illustrations\r\nof the preceding text. In the centre is seen the pattern to\r\nimitate,--Christ resisting the temptation of the Devil; and on each side\r\nthe examples to deter,--Adam and Eve with the forbidden fruit; and\r\nhungry Esau receiving the mess of pottage from Jacob.\r\n\r\nUnderneath the two half-length figures at the top, is inscribed “David\r\n34,” and “Ysaie xxix.”[II-64] The numerals are probably intended to\r\nindicate the chapters in the Psalms, and in the Prophecies of Isaiah,\r\nwhere the inscriptions on the adjacent scrolls are to be found. On\r\nsimilar scrolls, towards the bottom of the page, are references to the\r\n7th chapter of the 2nd book of Kings, and to the 16th chapter of Job.\r\nThe two half-length figures are most likely intended for the writers of\r\nthose sacred books. The likenesses of the prophets and holy persons,\r\nthus introduced at the top and bottom of each page, are, as Schelhorn\r\nhas observed,[II-65] purely imaginary; for the same character is seldom\r\nseen twice with the same face. As most of the supposed figurative\r\ndescriptions of Christ and his ministry are to be found in the Psalms,\r\nand in the Prophecies of Isaiah, the portraits of David and the\r\nlast-named prophet are those which most frequently occur; and the\r\ndesigner seems to have been determined that neither the king nor the\r\nprophet should ever appear twice with the same likeness.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-64: The passages referred to are probably the 8th,\r\n    9th, and 10th verses of the xxxivth Psalm; and the 8th verse of\r\n    the xxixth chapter of Isaiah.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-65: “Has autem icones ex sola sculptoris imaginatione\r\n    et arbitrio fluxisse vel inde liquet, quod idem scriptor sacer in\r\n    diversis foliis diversa plerumque et alia facie delineatus\r\n    sistatur, sicuti, v. g. Esaias ac David, sæpius obvii, Protei\r\n    instar, varias induerunt in hoc opere formas.”--Amœnitates\r\n    Literariæ, tom. iv. p. 297.]\r\n\r\nThe rhyming verses are as follows. That to the right, underneath the\r\nsubject of Adam and Eve:\r\n\r\n  Serpens vicit, Adam vetitam sibi sugerat escam.\r\n\r\nThe other, on the opposite side, underneath Jacob and Esau:\r\n\r\n  Lentis ob ardorem proprium male perdit honorem.\r\n\r\nAnd the third, at the bottom of the page, underneath the two portraits:\r\n\r\n  Christum temptavit Sathanas ut eum superaret.\r\n\r\nThe following cuts are fac-similes, the size of the originals, of each\r\nof the compartments of the page referred to, and of which a reduced copy\r\nhas been already given.\r\n\r\nThe first contains the representation of David and Isaiah, and the\r\ncharacters which follow the name of the former I consider to be intended\r\nfor 34. They are the only instances in the volume of the use of Arabic,\r\nor rather Spanish numerals. The letter +k+, at the foot, is the\r\n“signature,” as a printer would term it, indicating the order of the\r\npage. On each side of it are portions of scrolls containing\r\ninscriptions, of which some of the letters are seen.\r\n\r\nThe next cut represents Satan tempting Christ by offering him stones to\r\nbe converted into bread.\r\n\r\nIn the distance are seen the high mountain, to the top of which Christ\r\nwas taken up by the Devil, and the temple from whose pinnacle Christ was\r\ntempted to cast himself down. The figure of Christ in this compartment\r\nis not devoid of sober dignity; nor is Satan deficient in diabolical\r\nugliness; but, though clawed and horned proper, he wants the usual\r\nappendage of a tail. The deficiency is, however, in some degree\r\ncompensated by giving to his hip the likeness of a fiendish face. In two\r\nor three other old wood engravings I have noticed a repulsive face\r\nindicated in a similar manner on the hip of the Devil. A person well\r\nacquainted with the superstitions of the fourteenth and fifteenth\r\ncenturies may perhaps be able to give a reason for this. It may be\r\nintended to show that Satan, who is ever going about seeking whom he may\r\ndevour, can see both before and behind.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe cut on the following page (90), which forms the compartment to the\r\nright, represents Adam and Eve, each with an apple: and the state in\r\nwhich Eve appears to be, is in accordance with an opinion maintained by\r\nseveral of the schoolmen of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The\r\ntree of knowledge is without fruit, and the serpent, with a human face,\r\nis seen twined round its stem. The form of the tree and the shape of the\r\nleaves are almost precisely the same as those of the olive-trees in the\r\nApocalypse, uprooted by Antichrist. The character of the designs,\r\nhowever, in the two books is almost as different as the manner of the\r\nengraving. In the Apocalypse there is no attempt at shading, while in\r\nthe book under consideration it is introduced in every page, though\r\nmerely by courses of single lines, as may be perceived in the drapery of\r\nChrist in the preceding cut, and in the trunk of the tree and in the\r\nserpent in the cut subjoined. In this cut the figure of Adam cannot be\r\nconsidered as a specimen of manly beauty; his face is that of a man who\r\nis past his prime, and his attitude is very like that of one of the\r\nsplay-footed boors of Teniers. In point of personal beauty Eve appears\r\nto be a partner worthy of her husband; and though from her action she\r\nseems conscious that she is naked, yet her expression and figure are\r\nextremely unlike the graceful timidity and beautiful proportions of the\r\nMedicean Venus. The face of the serpent displays neither malignity nor\r\nfiendish cunning; but, on the contrary, is marked with an expression not\r\nunlike that of a Bavarian broom-girl. This manner of representing the\r\ntemptation of our first parents appears to have been conventional among\r\nthe early German Formschneiders; for I have seen several old wood-cuts\r\nof this subject, in which the figures were almost precisely the same.\r\nNotwithstanding the bad drawing and the coarse engraving of the\r\nfollowing cut, many of the same subject, executed in Germany between\r\n1470 and 1510, are yet worse.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the opposite cut, which forms the compartment to the left, Esau, who\r\nis distinguished by his bow and quiver, is seen receiving a bowl of\r\npottage from his brother Jacob. At the far side of the apartment is seen\r\na “kail-pot,” suspended from a “crook,” with something like a ham and a\r\ngammon of bacon hanging against the wall. This subject is treated in a\r\nstyle which is thoroughly Dutch. Isaac’s family appear to have been\r\nlodged in a tolerably comfortable house, with a stock of provisions near\r\nthe chimney nook; and his two sons are very like some of the figures in\r\nthe pictures of Teniers, more especially about the legs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe following cut, a copy of that which is the lowest in the page,\r\nrepresents the two prophets or inspired penmen, to whom reference is\r\nmade on the two scrolls whose ends may be perceived towards the lower\r\ncorners of each arch. The words underneath the figures are a portion of\r\nthe last rhyming verse quoted at page 87. It is from a difference in the\r\ntriangular ornament, above the pillar separating the two figures, though\r\nnot in this identical page, that Heineken chiefly decides on three of\r\nthe editions of this book; though nothing could be more easy than to\r\nintroduce another ornament of a similar kind, in the event of the\r\noriginal either being damaged in printing or intentionally effaced. In\r\nsome of the earliest wood-blocks which remain undestroyed by the rough\r\nhandling of time there are evident traces of several letters having been\r\nbroken away, and of the injury being afterwards remedied by the\r\nintroduction of a new piece of wood, on which the letters wanting were\r\nre-engraved.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe ink with which the cuts in the “Poor Preachers’ Bible” have been\r\nprinted, is evidently a kind of distemper of the colour of bistre,\r\nlighter than in the History of the Virgin, and darker than in the\r\nApocalypse. In many of the cuts certain portions of the lines appear\r\nsurcharged with ink,--sometimes giving to the whole page rather a\r\nblotched appearance,--while other portions seem scarcely to have\r\nreceived any.[II-66] This appearance is undoubtedly in consequence of\r\nthe light-bodied ink having, from its want of tenacity, accumulated on\r\nthe block where the line was thickest, or where two lines met, leaving\r\nthe thinner portions adjacent with scarce any colouring at all. The\r\nblock must, in my opinion, have been charged with such ink by means of\r\nsomething like a brush, and not by means of a ball. In some parts of the\r\ncuts--more especially where there is the greatest portion of text--small\r\nwhite spaces may be perceived, as if a graver had been run through the\r\nlines. On first noticing this appearance, I was inclined to think that\r\nit was owing to the spreading of the hairs of the brush in inking,\r\nwhereby certain parts might have been left untouched. The same kind of\r\nbreak in the lines may be observed, however, in some of the impressions\r\nof the old wood-cuts published by Becker and Derschau,[II-67] and which\r\nare worked off by means of a press, and with common printer’s ink. In\r\nthese it is certainly owing to minute furrows in the grain of the wood;\r\nand I am now of opinion that the same cause has occasioned a similar\r\nappearance in the cuts of the “Biblia Pauperum Predicatorum.” Mr.\r\nOttley, speaking of the impressions in Earl Spencer’s copy, makes the\r\nfollowing remarks: “In many instances they have a sort of horizontally\r\nstriped and confused appearance, which leads me to suppose that they\r\nwere taken from engravings executed on some kind of wood of a coarse\r\ngrain.”[II-68] This correspondence between Earl Spencer’s copy and that\r\nin the King’s Library at the British Museum tends to confirm my opinion\r\nthat there are not so many editions of the book as Heineken,--from\r\ncertain accidental variations,--has been induced to suppose.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-66: Schelhorn has noticed a similar appearance in the\r\n    old block-book entitled “Ars Memorandi:” “Videas hic nonnunquam\r\n    literas atramento confluenti deformatas, ventremque illarum, alias\r\n    album et vacuum, atramentaria macula repletum.” Amœnitat. Liter.\r\n    tom. i. p. 7.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-67: This collection of wood engravings from old\r\n    blocks was published in three parts, large folio, at Gotha in\r\n    1808, 1810, and 1816, under the following title: “Holzschnitte\r\n    alter Deutscher Meister in den Original-Platten gesammelt von Hans\r\n    Albrecht Von Derschau: Als ein Beytrag zur Kunstgeschichte\r\n    herausgegeben, und mit einer Abhandlung über die Holzschneidekunst\r\n    und deren Schicksale begleitet von Rudolph Zacharias Becker.” The\r\n    collector has frequently mistaken rudeness of design, and\r\n    coarseness of execution, for proofs of antiquity.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-68: Inquiry, vol. i. p. 130.]\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the cuts are engraved, and the attempts at something\r\nlike effect in the shading and composition, induce me to think that this\r\nbook is not so old as either the Apocalypse or the History of the\r\nVirgin. That it appeared before 1428, as has been inferred from the date\r\nwhich the Rev. Mr. Horne fancied that he had seen on the ancient\r\nbinding, I cannot induce myself to believe. It is more likely to have\r\nbeen executed at some time between 1440 and 1460; and I am inclined to\r\nthink that it is the production of a Dutch or Flemish, rather than a\r\nGerman artist.\r\n\r\nA work, from which the engraved “Biblia Pauperum Predicatorum” is little\r\nmore than an abstract, appears to have been known in France and Germany\r\nlong before block-printing was introduced. Of such a work there were two\r\nmanuscript copies in the National Library at Paris; the one complete,\r\nand the other--which, with a few exceptions, had been copied from the\r\nfirst--imperfect. The work consisted of a brief summary of the Bible,\r\narranged in the following manner. One or two phrases in Latin and in\r\nFrench formed, as it were, the text; and each text was followed by a\r\nmoral reflection, also in Latin and in French. Each article, which thus\r\nconsisted of two parts, was illustrated by two drawings, one of which\r\nrelated to the historical fact, and the other to the moral deduced from\r\nit. The perfect copy consisted of four hundred and twenty-two pages, on\r\neach of which there were eight drawings, so that the number contained in\r\nthe whole volume was upwards of five thousand. In some of the single\r\ndrawings, which were about two and one-third inches wide, by three and\r\none-third inches high, Camus counted not less than thirty heads.[II-69]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-69: Notice d’un Livre, &c. p. 11.]\r\n\r\nIn a copy of the “Biblia Pauperum Predicatorum” from wood-blocks,\r\nHeineken observed written: “S. ANSGARIUS est autor hujus libri,”--St.\r\nAnsgarius is the author of this book. St. Ansgarius, who was a native of\r\nFrance, and a monk of the celebrated Abbey of Corbey, was sent into\r\nLower Saxony, and other places in the north, for the purpose of\r\nreclaiming the people from paganism. He was appointed the first bishop\r\nof Hamburg in 831, and in 844 Bishop of Bremen, where he died in\r\n864.[II-70] From a passage cited by Heineken from Ornhielm’s\r\nEcclesiastical History of Sweden and Gothland, it appears that Ansgarius\r\nwas reputed to have compiled a similar book;[II-71] and Heineken\r\nobserves that it might be from this passage that the “Biblia Pauperum\r\nPredicatorum” was ascribed to the Bishop of Hamburg.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-70: Heineken, Idée Générale, p. 319.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-71: Ornhielm’s book was printed in 4to. at Stockholm,\r\n    1689. The passage referred to is as follows: “Quos _per numeros et\r\n    signa_ conscripsisse cum [Ansgarium] libros Rembertus memorat\r\n    indigitatos _pigmentorum_ vocabulo, eos continuisse, palam est,\r\n    quasdam aut e divinarum literarum, aut pie doctorum patrum\r\n    scriptis, pericopas et sententias.”]\r\n\r\nIn the cloisters of the cathedral at Bremen, Heineken saw two\r\nbas-reliefs sculptured on stone, of which the figures, of a moderate\r\nsize, were precisely the same as those in two of the pages--the first\r\nand eighth--of the German “Biblia Pauperum Predicatorum.” The\r\ninscriptions, which were in Latin, were the same as in block-book. He\r\nthinks it very probable that the other arches of the cloisters were\r\nformerly ornamented in the same manner with the remainder of the\r\nsubjects, but that the sculptures had been destroyed in the disturbances\r\nwhich had occurred in Bremen. Though he by no means pretends that the\r\ncuts were engraved in the time of Ansgarius, he thinks it not impossible\r\nthat the sculptures might be executed at that period according to the\r\nbishop’s directions. This last passage is one of the most silly that\r\noccurs in Heineken’s book.[II-72] It is just about as likely that the\r\ncuts in the “Biblia Pauperum Predicatorum” were engraved in the time of\r\nAnsgarius, as that the bas-reliefs in the cloisters of the cathedral of\r\nBremen should have been sculptured under his direction.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-72: “Ces conjectures sont foibles; elles ont été\r\n    attaquées par Erasme Nyerup dans un écrit publié à Copenhague en\r\n    1784. . . . . Nyerup donne à penser que Heinecke a reconnu\r\n    lui-même, dans la suite, la foiblesse de ses conjectures.”--Camus,\r\n    Notice d’un Livre, &c. p. 9.]\r\n\r\nThe book usually called the “Speculum Humanæ Salvationis,”[II-73]--the\r\nMirror of Human Salvation,--which is ascribed by Hadrian Junius to\r\nLawrence Coster, has been more frequently the subject of discussion\r\namong bibliographers and writers who have treated of the origin of\r\nprinting, than any other work. A great proportion, however, of what has\r\nbeen written on the subject consists of groundless speculation; and the\r\nfacts elicited, compared with the conjectures propounded, are as “two\r\ngrains of wheat to a bushel of chaff.” It would be a waste of time to\r\nrecite at length the various opinions that have been entertained with\r\nrespect to the date of this book, the manner in which the text was\r\nprinted, and the printer’s name. The statements and the theories put\r\nforth by Junius and Meerman in Coster’s favour, so far as the execution\r\nof the Speculum is concerned, are decidedly contradicted by the book\r\nitself. Without, therefore, recapitulating arguments which are\r\ncontradicted by established facts, I shall endeavour to give a correct\r\naccount of the work, leaving those who choose to compare it, and\r\nreconcile it if they can, with the following assertions made by Coster’s\r\nadvocates: 1. that the Speculum was first printed by him in Dutch with\r\nwooden types; 2. that while engraving a Latin edition on blocks of wood\r\nhe discovered the art of printing with moveable letters; 3. that the\r\nLatin edition, in which the text is partly from moveable types and\r\npartly from wood-blocks, was printed by Coster’s heirs and successors,\r\ntheir moveable types having been stolen by John Gutemberg before the\r\nwhole of the text was set up.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-73: It is sometimes named “Speculum Figuratum;” and\r\n    Junius in his account of Coster’s invention calls it “Speculum\r\n    Nostræ Salutis.”]\r\n\r\nThe Speculum which has been the subject of so much discussion is of a\r\nsmall folio size, and without date or printer’s name. There are four\r\neditions of it known to bibliographers, all containing the same cuts;\r\ntwo of those editions are in Latin, and two in Dutch. In the Latin\r\neditions the work consists of sixty-three leaves, five of which are\r\noccupied by an introduction or prologue, and on the other fifty-eight\r\nare printed the cuts and explanatory text. The Dutch editions, though\r\ncontaining the same number of cuts as the Latin, consist of only\r\nsixty-two leaves each, as the preface occupies only four. In all those\r\neditions the leaves are printed on one side only. Besides the four\r\neditions above noticed, which have been ascribed to Coster and have\r\nexcited so much controversy, there are two or three others in which the\r\ncuts are more coarsely engraved, and probably executed, at a later\r\nperiod, in Germany. There is also a quarto edition of the Speculum,\r\nprinted in 1483, at Culemburg, by John Veldener, and ornamented with the\r\nidentical cuts of the folio editions ascribed to Coster and his heirs.\r\n\r\nThe four controverted editions of the Speculum may be considered as\r\nholding a middle place between block-books,--which are wholly executed,\r\nboth text and cuts, by the wood-engraver,--and books printed with\r\nmoveable types: for in three of the editions the cuts are printed by\r\nmeans of friction with a rubber or burnisher, in the manner of the\r\nHistory of the Virgin, and other block-books, while the text, set in\r\nmoveable type, has been worked off by means of a press; and in a fourth\r\nedition, in which the cuts are taken in the same manner as in the\r\nformer, twenty pages of the text are printed from wood-blocks by means\r\nof friction, while the remainder are printed in the same manner as the\r\nwhole of the text in the three other editions; that is, from moveable\r\nmetal types, and by means of a press.\r\n\r\nThere are fifty-eight cuts in the Speculum, each of which is divided\r\ninto two compartments by a slender column in the middle. In all the\r\neditions the cuts are placed as head-pieces at the top of each page,\r\nhaving underneath them, in two columns, the explanatory text. Under each\r\ncompartment the title of the subject, in Latin, is engraved on the\r\nblock.\r\n\r\nThe following reduced copy of the first cut will give an idea of their\r\nform, as every subject has pillars at the side, and is surmounted by an\r\narch in the same style.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe style of engraving in those cuts is similar to those of the Poor\r\nPreachers’ Bible. The former are, however, on the whole executed with\r\ngreater delicacy, and contain more work. The shadows and folds of the\r\ndrapery in the first forty-eight cuts are indicated by short parallel\r\nlines, which are mostly horizontal. In the forty-ninth and subsequent\r\ncuts, as has been noticed by Mr. Ottley, a change in the mode of\r\nindicating the shades and the folds in the draperies is perceptible; for\r\nthe short parallel lines, instead of being horizontal as in the former,\r\nare mostly slanting. Heineken observes, that to the forty-eighth cut\r\ninclusive, the chapters in the printed work are conformable with the old\r\nLatin manuscripts; and as a perceptible change in the execution\r\ncommences with the forty-ninth, it is not unlikely that the cuts were\r\nengraved by two different persons. The two following cuts are\r\nfac-similes of the compartments of the first, of which a reduced copy\r\nhas been previously given.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the above cut, its title, “Casus Luciferi,”--the Fall of Lucifer,--is\r\nengraved at the bottom; and the subject represented is Satan and the\r\nrebellious angels driven out of heaven, as typical of man’s disobedience\r\nand fall. The following are the first two lines of the column of text\r\nunderneath the cut in the Latin editions:\r\n\r\n  +Inchoatur speculum humanae salvacionis\r\n  In quo patet casus hominis et modus repactionis.+\r\n\r\nWhich may be translated into English thus:\r\n\r\n  In the Mirror of Salvation here is represented plain\r\n  The fall of man, and by what means he made his peace again.\r\n\r\nThe following is the right-hand compartment of the same cut. The title\r\nof this subject, as in all the others, is engraved at the bottom; the\r\ncontracted words when written in full are, “Deus creavit hominem ad\r\nymaginem et similitudinem suam,”--God created man after his own image\r\nand likeness.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe first two lines of the text in the column underneath this cut are,\r\n\r\n  +Mulier autem in paradiso est formata\r\n  De costis viri dormienti est parata.+\r\n\r\nThat is, in English rhyme of similar measure,\r\n\r\n  The woman was in Paradise for man an help meet made,\r\n  From Adam’s rib created as he asleep was laid.\r\n\r\nThe cuts in all the editions are printed in light brown or sepia colour\r\nwhich has been mixed with water, and readily yields to moisture. The\r\nimpressions have evidently been taken by means of friction, as the back\r\nof the paper immediately behind is smooth and shining from the action of\r\nthe rubber or burnisher, while on the lower part of the page at the back\r\nof the text, which has been printed with moveable types, there is no\r\nsuch appearance. In the second Latin edition, in which the explanatory\r\ntext to twenty of the cuts[II-74] has been printed from engraved\r\nwood-blocks by means of friction, the reverse of those twenty pages\r\npresents the same smooth appearance as the reverse of the cuts. In those\r\ntwenty pages of text from engraved wood-blocks the ink is\r\nlighter-coloured than in the remainder of the book which is printed from\r\nmoveable types, though much darker than that of the cuts. It is,\r\ntherefore, evident that the two impressions,--the one from the block\r\ncontaining the cut, and the other from the block containing the\r\ntext,--have been taken separately. In the pages printed from moveable\r\ntypes, the ink, which has evidently been compounded with oil, is\r\nfull-bodied, and of a dark brown colour, approaching nearly to black. In\r\nthe other three editions, one Latin and two Dutch, in which the text is\r\nentirely from moveable types, the ink is also full-bodied and nearly jet\r\nblack, forming a strong contrast with the faint colour of the cuts.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-74: The cuts which have the text printed from\r\n    wood-blocks are Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16,\r\n    17, 21, 22, 26, 27, 46, and 55.--Heineken, Idée Générale, p. 444.]\r\n\r\nThe plan of the Speculum is almost the same as that of the Poor\r\nPreachers’ Bible, and is equally as well entitled as the latter to be\r\ncalled “A History typical and anti-typical of the Old and New\r\nTestament.” Several of the subjects in the two books are treated nearly\r\nin the same manner, though in no single instance, so far as my\r\nobservation goes, is the design precisely the same in both. In several\r\nof the cuts of the Speculum, in the same manner as in the Poor\r\nPreachers’ Bible, one compartment contains the supposed type or\r\nprefiguration, and the other its fulfilment; for instance: at No. 17 the\r\nappearance of the Lord to Moses in the burning bush is typical of the\r\nAnnunciation; at No. 23 the brazen bath in the temple of Solomon is\r\ntypical of baptism; at No. 31 the manna provided for the children of\r\nIsrael in the Desert is typical of the Lord’s Supper; at No. 45 the\r\nCrucifixion is represented in one compartment, and in the other is\r\nTubal-Cain, the inventor of iron-work, and consequently of the nails\r\nwith which Christ was fixed to the cross; and at No. 53 the descent of\r\nChrist to Hades, and the liberation of the patriarchs and fathers, is\r\ntypified by the escape of the children of Israel from Egypt.\r\n\r\nThough most of the subjects are from the Bible or the Apocrypha, yet\r\nthere are two or three which the designer has borrowed from profane\r\nhistory: such as Semiramis contemplating the hanging gardens of Babylon;\r\nthe Sibyl and Augustus; and Codrus king of Athens incurring death in\r\norder to secure victory to his people.\r\n\r\nThe Speculum Salvationis, as printed in the editions previously noticed,\r\nis only a portion of a larger work with the same title, and ornamented\r\nwith similar designs, which had been known long before in manuscript.\r\nHeineken says, at page 478 of his Idée Générale, that the oldest copy he\r\never saw was in the Imperial Library at Vienna; and, at page 468, he\r\nobserves that it appeared to belong to the twelfth century.\r\n\r\nThe manuscript work, when complete, consisted of forty-five chapters in\r\nrhyming Latin, to which was prefixed an introduction containing a list\r\nof them. Each of the first forty-two chapters contained four subjects,\r\nthe first of which was the principal, and the other three illustrative\r\nof it. To each of these chapters were two drawings, every one of which,\r\nas in the printed copies of the work, consisted of two compartments. The\r\nlast three chapters contained each eight subjects, and each subject was\r\nornamented with a design.[II-75] The whole number of separate\r\nillustrations in the work was thus one hundred and ninety-two. The\r\nprinted folio editions contain only fifty-eight cuts, or one hundred and\r\nsixteen separate illustrations.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-75: Heineken, Idée Générale, p. 474.]\r\n\r\nThough the Speculum from the time of the publication of Junius’s\r\nwork[II-76] had been confidently claimed for Coster, yet no writer,\r\neither for or against him, appears to have particularly directed his\r\nattention to the manner in which the work was executed before Fournier,\r\nwho in 1758, in a dissertation on the Origin and Progress of the Art of\r\nWood-engraving,[II-77] first published some particulars respecting the\r\nwork in question, which induced Meerman and Heineken to speculate on the\r\npriority of the different editions. Mr. Ottley, however, has proved, in\r\na manner which carries with it the certainty of mathematical\r\ndemonstration, that the conjectures of both the latter writers\r\nrespecting the priority of the editions of the Speculum are absolutely\r\nerroneous. To elicit the truth does not, with respect to this work, seem\r\nto have been the object of those two writers. Both had espoused theories\r\non its origin without much inquiry with respect to facts, and each\r\npresumed that edition to be the first which seemed most likely to\r\nsupport his own speculations.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-76: The “Batavia” or Junius, in which the name of\r\n    Lawrence Coster first appears as a printer, was published in\r\n    1588.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-77: Dissertation sur l’Origine et les Progrès de\r\n    l’Art de Graver en Bois. Par M. Fournier le Jeune, 8vo. Paris,\r\n    1758.]\r\n\r\nHeineken, who assumed that the work was of German origin, insisted that\r\nthe _first_ edition was that in which the text is printed partly from\r\nmoveable types and partly from letters engraved on wood-blocks, and that\r\nthe Dutch editions were executed subsequently in the Low Countries. The\r\nLatin edition with the text entirely printed from moveable types he is\r\npleased to denominate the second, and to assert, contrary to the\r\nevidence which the work itself affords, that the type resembles that of\r\nFaust and Scheffer, and that the cuts in this _second_ Latin edition, as\r\nhe erroneously calls it, are coarser and not so sharp as those in the\r\nLatin edition which he supposes to be the first.\r\n\r\nFournier’s discoveries with respect to the execution of the Speculum\r\nseem to have produced a complete change as to its origin in the opinions\r\nof Meerman; who, in 1757, the year before Fournier’s dissertation was\r\nprinted, had expressed his belief, in a letter to his friend Wagenaar,\r\nthat what was alleged in favour of Coster being the inventor of printing\r\nwas mere gratuitous assertion; that the text of the Speculum was\r\nprobably printed after the cuts, and subsequent to 1470; that there was\r\nnot a single document, nor an iota of evidence, to show that Coster ever\r\nused moveable types; and lastly, that the Latin was prior to the Dutch\r\nedition of the Speculum, as was apparent from the Latin names engraved\r\nat the foot of the cuts, which certainly would have been in Dutch had\r\nthe cuts been originally destined for a Dutch edition.[II-78] In the\r\nteeth of his own previous opinions, having apparently gained a new light\r\nfrom Fournier’s discoveries, Meerman, in his Origines Typographicæ,\r\nprinted in 1765, endeavours to prove that the Dutch edition was the\r\nfirst, and that it was printed with moveable wooden types by Coster. The\r\nLatin edition in which the text is printed partly from moveable types\r\nand partly from wood-blocks he supposes to have been printed by Coster’s\r\nheirs after his decease, thus endeavouring to give credibility to the\r\nstory of Coster having died of grief on account of his types being\r\nstolen, and to encourage the supposition that his heirs in this edition\r\nsupplied the loss by having engraved on blocks of wood those pages which\r\nwere not already printed.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-78: A French translation of Meerman’s letter, which\r\n    was originally written in Dutch, is given by Santander in his\r\n    Dictionnaire Bibliographique, tom. i. pp. 14-18, 8vo. Bruxelles,\r\n    1805.]\r\n\r\nFournier’s discoveries relative to the manner in which the Speculum was\r\nexecuted were: 1st, that the cuts and the text had been printed at\r\nseparate times, and that the former had been printed by means of\r\nfriction; 2d, that a portion of the text in one of the Latin editions\r\nhad been printed from engraved wood-blocks.[II-79] Fournier, who was a\r\ntype-founder and wood-engraver, imagined that the moveable types with\r\nwhich the Speculum was printed were of wood. He also asserted that Faust\r\nand Scheffer’s Psalter and an early edition of the Bible were printed\r\nwith moveable wooden types. Such assertions are best answered by a\r\nsimple negative, leaving the person who puts them forth to make out a\r\nprobable case.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-79: Dissertation, pp. 29-32. The many mistakes which\r\n    Fournier commits in his Dissertation, excite a suspicion that he\r\n    was either superficially acquainted with his subject, or extremely\r\n    careless. He published two or three other small works on the\r\n    subject of engraving and printing,--after the manner of\r\n    “Supplements to an Appendix,”--the principal of which is entitled\r\n    “De l’Origine et des Productions de l’Imprimerie primitive en\r\n    taille de bois; avec une refutation des préjugés plus ou moins\r\n    accredités sur cet art; pour servir de suite à la Dissertation sur\r\n    l’Origine de l’Art de graver en bois. Paris, 1759.”]\r\n\r\nThe fact having been established that in one of the editions of the\r\nSpeculum a part of the text was printed from wood-blocks, while the\r\nwhole of the text in the other three was printed from moveable types,\r\nHeineken, without diligently comparing the editions with each other in\r\norder to obtain further evidence, decides in favour of that edition\r\nbeing the first in which part of the text is printed from wood-blocks.\r\nHis reasons for supposing this to be the first edition, though specious\r\nin appearance, are at variance with the facts which have since been\r\nincontrovertibly established by Mr. Ottley, whose scrutinizing\r\nexamination of the different editions has clearly shown the futility of\r\nall former speculations respecting their priority. The argument of\r\nHeineken is to this effect: “It is improbable that a printer who had\r\nprinted an edition wholly with moveable types should afterwards have\r\nrecourse to an engraver to cut for him on blocks of wood a portion of\r\nthe text for a second edition; and it is equally improbable that a\r\nwood-engraver who had discovered the art of printing with moveable\r\ntypes, and had used them to print the entire text of the first edition,\r\nshould, to a certain extent, abandon his invention in a second by\r\nprinting a portion of the text from engraved blocks of wood.” The\r\nfollowing is the order in which he arranges the different editions:\r\n\r\n  1. The Latin edition in which part of the text is printed from\r\n    wood-blocks.\r\n\r\n  2. The Latin edition in which the text is entirely printed from\r\n    moveable types.\r\n\r\n  3. The Dutch edition with the text printed wholly from moveable\r\n    types, supposed by Meerman to be the _first edition_ of all.[II-80]\r\n\r\n  4. The Dutch edition with the text printed wholly from moveable\r\n    types, and which differs only from the preceding one in having\r\n    the two pages of text under cuts No. 45 and 56 printed in a type\r\n    different from the rest of the book.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-80: Heineken seems inclined to consider this as the\r\n    second Dutch edition; and he only mentions it as the first Dutch\r\n    edition because it is called so by Meerman.--Idée Gén. pp. 453,\r\n    454.]\r\n\r\nThe preceding arrangement--including Meerman’s opinion respecting the\r\npriority of the Dutch edition--rests entirely on conjecture, and is\r\nalmost diametrically contradicted in every instance by the evidence\r\nafforded by the books themselves; for through the comparisons and\r\ninvestigations of Mr. Ottley it is proved, to an absolute certainty,\r\nthat the Latin edition supposed by Heineken to be the second is the\r\n_earliest of all_; that the edition No. 4, called the second Dutch, is\r\nthe next in order to the actual first Latin; and that the two editions,\r\nNo. 1 and No. 3, respectively proclaimed by Heineken and Meerman as the\r\nearliest, have been printed subsequently to the other two.[II-81] Which\r\nof the pretended _first_ editions was in reality the _last_, has not\r\nbeen satisfactorily determined; though there seems reason to believe\r\nthat it was the Latin one which has part of the text printed from\r\nwood-blocks.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-81: Inquiry into the Origin and Early History of\r\n    Engraving, pp. 205-217. Though differing from Mr. Ottley in the\r\n    conclusions which he draws from the facts elicited by him\r\n    respecting the priority of the editions of the Speculum, I bear a\r\n    willing testimony to the value of his discoveries on this subject,\r\n    which may rank among the most interesting that have resulted from\r\n    bibliographical research.]\r\n\r\nIt is well known to every person acquainted with the practice of\r\nwood-engraving, that portions of single lines in such cuts as those of\r\nthe Speculum are often broken out of the block in the process of\r\nprinting. If two books, therefore, containing the same wood-cuts, but\r\nevidently printed at different times, though without a date, should be\r\nsubmitted to the examination of a person acquainted with the above fact\r\nand bearing it in mind, he would doubtless declare that the copy in\r\nwhich the cuts were most perfect was first printed, and that the other\r\nin which parts of the cuts appeared broken away was of a later date. If,\r\non comparing other copies of the same editions he should find the same\r\nvariations, the impression on his mind as to the priority of the\r\neditions would amount to absolute certainty. The identity of the cuts in\r\nall the four editions of the Speculum being unquestionable, and as\r\ncertain minute fractures in the lines of some of them, as if small\r\nportions of the block had been broken out in printing, had been\r\npreviously noticed by Fournier and Heineken, Mr. Ottley conceived the\r\nidea of comparing the respective cuts in the different editions, with a\r\nview of ascertaining the order in which they were printed. He first\r\ncompared two copies of the edition called the _first Latin_ with a copy\r\nof that called the _second Dutch_, and finding, that, in several of the\r\ncuts of the former, parts of lines were wanting which in the latter were\r\nperfect, he concluded that the miscalled _second Dutch_ edition was in\r\nfact of an earlier date than the pretended _first Latin_ edition of\r\nHeineken. In further comparing the above editions with the supposed\r\n_second Latin_ edition of Heineken and the supposed _first Dutch_\r\nedition of Meerman, he found that the cuts in the miscalled second Latin\r\nedition were the most perfect of all; and that the cuts in Heineken’s\r\nfirst Latin and Meerman’s first Dutch editions contained more broken\r\nlines than the edition named by those authors the _second Dutch_. The\r\nconclusion which he arrived at from those facts was irresistible,\r\nnamely, that the earliest edition of all was that called by Heineken the\r\nsecond Latin; and that the edition called the second Dutch was the next\r\nin order. As the cuts in the copies examined of the pretended _first_\r\nLatin and Dutch editions contained similar fractures, it could not be\r\ndetermined with certainty which was actually the _last_.\r\n\r\nAs it is undoubted that the cuts of all the editions have been printed\r\nseparately from the text, it has been objected that Mr. Ottley’s\r\nexamination has only ascertained the order in which the cuts have been\r\nprinted, but by no means decided the priority of the editions of the\r\nentire book. All the cuts, it has been objected, might have been taken\r\nby the engraver before the text was printed in a single edition, and it\r\nmight thus happen that the book first printed with text might contain\r\nthe last, and consequently the most imperfect cuts. This exception,\r\nwhich is founded on a very improbable presumption, will be best answered\r\nby the following facts established on a comparison of the two Latin, and\r\nwhich, I believe, have not been previously noticed:--On closely\r\ncomparing those pages which are printed with moveable types in the true\r\nsecond edition with the corresponding pages in that edition which is\r\nproperly the first, it was evident from the different spelling of many\r\nof the words, and the different length of the lines, that they had been\r\nprinted at different times: but on comparing, however, those pages which\r\nare printed in the second edition from engraved wood-blocks with the\r\ncorresponding pages, from moveable type, in the first edition, I found\r\nthe spelling and the length of the lines to be the same. The page\r\nprinted from the wood-block was, in short, a fac-simile of the\r\ncorresponding page printed from moveable types. So completely did they\r\ncorrespond, that I have no doubt that an impression of the page printed\r\nfrom moveable types had been “transferred,”[II-82] as engravers say, to\r\nthe block. In the last cut[II-83] of the first edition I noticed a\r\nscroll which was quite black, as if meant to contain an inscription\r\nwhich the artist had neglected to engrave; and in the second edition I\r\nperceived that the black was cut away, thus having the part intended for\r\nthe inscription white. Another proof, in addition to those adduced by\r\nMr. Ottley of that Latin edition being truly the first in which the\r\nwhole of the text is printed from moveable types.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-82: Wood-engravers of the present day are accustomed\r\n    to transfer an old impression from a cut or a page of letter-press\r\n    to a block in the following manner. They first moisten the back of\r\n    the paper on which the cut or letter-press is printed with a\r\n    mixture of concentrated potash and essence of lavender in equal\r\n    quantities, which causes the ink to separate readily from the\r\n    paper; next, when the paper is nearly dry, the cut or page is\r\n    placed above a prepared block, and by moderate pressure the ink\r\n    comes off from the paper, and leaves an impression upon the wood.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-83: The subject is Daniel explaining to Belshazzar\r\n    the writing on the wall.]\r\n\r\nThough there can no longer be a doubt in the mind of any impartial\r\nperson of that Latin edition, in which part of the text is printed from\r\nengraved wood-blocks, and the rest from moveable types, being later than\r\nthe other; yet the establishment of this fact suggests a question, as to\r\nthe cause of part of the text of this second Latin edition being printed\r\nfrom wood-blocks, which cannot perhaps be very satisfactorily answered.\r\nAll writers previous to Mr. Ottley, who had noticed that the text was\r\nprinted partly from moveable types and partly from wood-blocks, decided,\r\nwithout hesitation, that this edition was the first; and each,\r\naccordingly as he espoused the cause of Gutemberg or Coster, proceeded\r\nto theorise on this assumed fact. As their arguments were founded in\r\nerror, it cannot be a matter of surprise that their conclusions should\r\nbe inconsistent with truth. The fact of this edition being subsequent to\r\nthat in which the text is printed wholly from moveable types has been\r\nquestioned on two grounds: 1st. The improbability that the person who\r\nhad printed the text of a former edition entirely from moveable types\r\nshould in a later edition have recourse to the more tedious operation of\r\nengraving part of the text on wood-blocks. 2d. Supposing that the owner\r\nof the cuts had determined in a later edition to engrave the text on\r\nblocks of wood, it is difficult to conceive what could be his reason for\r\nabandoning his plan, after twenty pages of the text were engraved, and\r\nprinting the remainder with moveable types.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to answer those objections, I think it necessary to\r\nobserve that the existence of a positive fact can never be affected by\r\nany arguments which are grounded on the difficulty of accounting for it.\r\nObjections, however specious, can never alter the immutable character of\r\ntruth, though they may affect opinions, and excite doubts in the minds\r\nof persons who have not an opportunity of examining and judging for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the first objection, it is to be remembered that in all\r\nthe editions, the text, whether from wood-blocks or moveable types, has\r\nbeen printed separately from the cuts; consequently the cuts of the\r\nfirst edition might be printed by a wood-engraver, and the text set up\r\nand printed by another person who possessed moveable types. The engraver\r\nof the cuts might not be possessed of any moveable types when the text\r\nof the first edition was printed; and, as it is a well-known fact that\r\nwood-engravers continued to execute entire pages of text for upwards of\r\nthirty years after the establishment of printing with moveable types, it\r\nis not unlikely that he might attempt to engrave the text of a second\r\nedition and print the book solely for his own advantage. This\r\nsupposition is to a certain extent corroborated by the fact of the\r\ntwenty pages of engraved text in the second Latin edition being\r\nfac-similes of the twenty corresponding pages of text from moveable\r\ntypes in the first.\r\n\r\nTo the second objection every day’s experience suggests a ready answer;\r\nfor scarcely anything is more common than for a person to attempt a work\r\nwhich he finds it difficult to complete, and, after making some progress\r\nin it, to require the aid of a kindred art, and abandon his original\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nAs the first edition of the Speculum was printed subsequent to the\r\ndiscovery of the art of printing with moveable types, and as it was\r\nprobably printed in the Low Countries, where the typographic art was\r\nfirst introduced about 1472, I can discover no reason for believing that\r\nthe work was executed before that period. Santander, who was so well\r\nacquainted with the progress of typography in Belgium and Holland, is of\r\nopinion that the Speculum is not of an earlier date than 1480. In 1483\r\nJohn Veldener printed at Culemburg a quarto edition of the Speculum, in\r\nwhich the cuts are the same as in the earlier folios. In order to adapt\r\nthe cuts to this smaller edition Veldener had sawn each block in two,\r\nthrough the centre pillar which forms a separation between the two\r\ncompartments in each of the original engravings. Veldener’s quarto\r\nedition, which has the text printed on both sides of the paper from\r\nmoveable types, contains twelve more cuts than the older editions, but\r\ndesigned and executed in the same style.[II-84] If Lawrence Coster had\r\nbeen the inventor of printing with moveable types, and if any one folio\r\nedition of the Speculum had been executed by him, we cannot suppose that\r\nVeldener, who was himself a wood-engraver, as well as a printer, would\r\nhave been ignorant of those facts. He, however, printed two editions of\r\nthe Fasciculus Temporum,--one at Louvain in 1476, and the other at\r\nUtrecht in 1480,--a work which contains a short notice of the art of\r\nprinting being discovered at Mentz, but not a syllable concerning its\r\ndiscovery at Harlem by Lawrence Coster. The researches of Coster’s\r\nadvocates have clearly established one important fact, though an\r\nunfortunate one for their argument; namely, that the Custos or Warden of\r\nSt. Bavon’s was not known as a printer to one of his contemporaries. The\r\ncitizens of Harlem, however, have still something to console themselves\r\nwith: though Coster may not be the inventor of printing, there can be\r\nlittle doubt of Junius, or his editor, being the discoverer of Coster,--\r\n\r\n  “Est quoddam prodire tenus, si non datur ultra.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-84: Heineken gives an account of those twelve\r\n    additional cuts at page 463 of his Idée Générale. It appears that\r\n    Veldener also published in the same year another edition of the\r\n    Speculum, also in quarto, containing the same cuts as the older\r\n    folios, but without the twelve above mentioned.]\r\n\r\nThere is in the Print Room of the British Museum a small volume of\r\nwood-cuts, which has not hitherto been described by any bibliographer,\r\nnor by any writer who has treated on the origin and progress of wood\r\nengraving. It appears to have been unknown to Heineken, Breitkopf, Von\r\nMurr, and Meerman; and it is not mentioned, that I am aware of, either\r\nby Dr. Dibdin or Mr. Douce, although it certainly was submitted to the\r\ninspection of the latter. It formerly belonged to the late Sir George\r\nBeaumont, by whom it was bequeathed to the Museum; but where he obtained\r\nit I have not been able to learn. It consists of an alphabet of large\r\ncapital letters, formed of figures arranged in various attitudes; and\r\nfrom the general character of the designs, the style of the engraving,\r\nand the kind of paper on which the impressions have been taken, it\r\nevidently belongs to the same period as the Poor Preachers’ Bible. There\r\nis only one cut on each leaf, the back being left blank as in most of\r\nthe block-books, and the impressions have been taken by means of\r\nfriction. The paper at the back of each cut has a shining appearance\r\nwhen held towards the light, in consequence of the rubbing which it has\r\nreceived; and in some it appears as if it had been blacked with\r\ncharcoal, in the same manner that some parts of the cartoons were\r\nblacked which have been pricked through by the tapestry worker. The ink\r\nis merely a distemper or water-colour, which will partly wash out by the\r\napplication of hot water, and its colour is a kind of sepia. Each leaf,\r\nwhich is about six inches high, by three and six-eighths wide, consists\r\nof a separate piece of paper, and is pasted, at the inner margin, on to\r\na slip either of paper or parchment, through which the stitching of the\r\ncover passes. Whether the paper has been cut in this manner before or\r\nafter that the impressions were taken, I am unable to determine.[II-85]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-85: The following is a reduced copy of the\r\n    paper-mark, which appears to be a kind of anchor with a small\r\n    cross springing from a ball or knob at the junction of the arms\r\n    with the shank. It bears a considerable degree of resemblance to\r\n    the mark given at page 62, from an edition of the Apocalypse. An\r\n    anchor is to be found as a paper-mark in editions of the\r\n    Apocalypse, and of the Poor Preachers’ Bible. According to\r\n    Santander, a similar paper-mark is to be found in books printed at\r\n    Cologne, Louvain, and Utrecht, from about 1470 to 1480.\r\n    [Illustration]]\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the letter A is torn out, and in that which remains\r\nthere are pin-marks, as if it had been traced by being pricked through.\r\nThe letters S, T, and V are also wanting. The following is a brief\r\ndescription of the letters which remain. The letter B is composed of\r\nfive figures, one with a pipe and tabor, another who supports him,\r\na dwarf, an old man kneeling, and an old woman with a staff.\r\nC, a youthful figure rending open the jaws of a lion, with two grotesque\r\nheads like those of satyrs. D, a man on horseback, and a monk astride on\r\na fiendish-looking monster. E, two grotesque heads, a figure holding the\r\nhorn of one of them, and another figure stretching out a piece of cloth.\r\nF, a tall figure blowing a trumpet, and a youth beating a tabor, with an\r\nanimal like a dog at their feet.[II-86] G, David with Goliath’s head,\r\nand a figure stooping, who appears to kiss a flagellum. H, a figure\r\nopening the jaws of a dragon. I, a tall man embracing a woman.\r\nK, a female with a wreath, a youth kneeling, an old man on his knees,\r\nand a young man with his heels uppermost. [Engraved as a specimen at\r\npage 109.] L, a man with a long sword, as if about to pierce a figure\r\nreclining. [Engraved as a specimen at page 110.] M, two figures, each\r\nmounted on a kind of monster; between them, an old man. N, a man with a\r\nsword, another mounted on the tail of a fish. O, formed of four\r\ngrotesque heads. P, two figures with clubs. Q, formed of three grotesque\r\nheads, similar to those in O. R, a tall, upright figure, another with\r\nsomething like a club in his hand; a third, with his heels up, blowing a\r\nhorn. X, composed of four figures, one of which has two bells, and\r\nanother has one; on the shoulder of the upper figure to the right a\r\nsquirrel may be perceived. Y, a figure with something like a hairy skin\r\non his shoulder; another thrusting a sword through the head of an\r\nanimal. Z, three figures; an old man about to draw a dagger, a youth\r\nlying down, and another who appears as if flying. [Engraved as a\r\nspecimen at page 111.] The last cut is the ornamental flower, of which a\r\ncopy is given at page 113.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-86: The initial F, at the commencement of this\r\n    chapter, is a reduced copy of the letter here described.]\r\n\r\nIn the same case with those interesting, and probably unique specimens\r\nof early wood engraving, there is a letter relating to them, dated 27th\r\nMay, 1819, from Mr. Samuel Lysons to Sir George Beaumont, from which the\r\nfollowing is an extract: “I return herewith your curious volume of\r\nancient cuts. I showed it yesterday to Mr. Douce, who agrees with me\r\nthat it is a great curiosity. He thinks that the blocks were executed at\r\nHarlem, and are some of the earliest productions of that place. He has\r\nin his possession most of the letters executed in copper, but very\r\ninferior to the original cuts. Before you return from the Continent I\r\nshall probably be able to ascertain something further respecting them.”\r\nWhat might be Mr. Douce’s reasons for supposing that those cuts were\r\nexecuted at Harlem I cannot tell; though I am inclined to think that he\r\nhad no better foundation for his opinion than his faith in Junius,\r\nMeerman, and other advocates of Lawrence Coster, who unhesitatingly\r\nascribe every early block-book to the spurious “Officina Laurentiana.”\r\n\r\nIn the manuscript catalogue in the Print Room of the British Museum the\r\nvolume is thus described by Mr. Ottley: “Alphabet of initial letters\r\ncomposed of grotesque figures, wood engravings of the middle of the\r\nfifteenth century, apparently the work of a Dutch or Flemish artist; the\r\nimpressions taken off by friction in the manner of the early\r\nblock-books. . . . I perceive the word ‘_London_’ in small characters\r\nwritten upon the blade of a sword in one of the cuts, [the letter L,]\r\nand I suspect they were engraved in England.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs to whether these cuts were engraved in England or no I shall not\r\nventure to give an opinion. I am, however, satisfied that they were\r\nneither designed nor engraved by the artists who designed and engraved\r\nthe cuts in the Apocalypse, the History of the Virgin, and the Poor\r\nPreachers’ Bible. With respect to drawing, expression, and engraving,\r\nthe cuts of the Alphabet are decidedly superior to those of every\r\nblock-book, and generally to all wood engravings executed previous to\r\n1500, with the exception of such as are by Albert Durer, and those\r\ncontained in the Hypnerotomachia, an Italian rhapsody, with wood-cuts\r\nsupposed to have been designed by Raffaele or Andrea Mantegna, and\r\nprinted by Aldus at Venice, 1499. Although the cuts of the Alphabet may\r\nnot have been engraved in England, it is, however, certain that the\r\nvolume had been at rather an early period in the possession of an\r\nEnglishman. The cover consists of a double fold of thick parchment, on\r\nthe inside of which, between the folds, there is written in large old\r\nEnglish characters what I take to be the name “Edwardus Lowes.” On the\r\nblank side of the last leaf there is a sketch of a letter commencing\r\n“Right reverent and wershipfull masters and frynds; In the moste\r\nloweliste maner that I canne or may, I here recomende me, duely glade to\r\nher of yor good prosperitye and welth.” The writing, as I have been\r\ninformed, is of the period of Henry VIII; and on the slips of paper and\r\nparchment to which the inner margins of the leaves are pasted are\r\nportions of English manuscripts, which are probably of the same date.\r\nThere can, however, be little doubt that the leaves have been mounted,\r\nand the volume covered, about a hundred years subsequent to the\r\nengraving of the cuts.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nI agree with Mr. Ottley in thinking that those cuts were engraved about\r\nthe middle of the fifteenth century, but I can perceive nothing in them\r\nto induce me to suppose they were the work of a Dutch artist; and I am\r\nas little inclined to ascribe them to a German. The style of the drawing\r\nis not unlike what we see in illuminated French manuscripts of the\r\nmiddle of the fifteenth century; and as the only two engraved words\r\nwhich occur in the volume are French, I am rather inclined to suppose\r\nthat the artist who made the drawings was a native of France. The\r\ncostume of the female to whom the words are addressed appears to be\r\nFrench; and the action of the lover kneeling seems almost characteristic\r\nof that nation. No Dutchman certainly ever addressed his mistress with\r\nsuch an air. He holds what appears to be a ring as gracefully as a\r\nmodern Frenchman holds a snuff-box, and upon the scroll before him are\r\nengraved a heart, and the words which he may be supposed to utter, “_Mon\r\nAme_.” At page 109, is a fac-simile of the cut referred to, the letter\r\nK, of the size of the original, and printed in the same kind of colour.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nUpon the sword-blade in the original cut of the following letter, L,\r\nthere is written in small characters, as Mr. Ottley has observed, the\r\nword “_London_;” and in the white space on the right, or upper side, of\r\nthe figure lying down, there appears written in the same hand the name\r\n“_Bethemsted_.” In this name the letter B is not unlike a W; and I have\r\nheard it conjectured that the name might be that of John Wethamstede,\r\nabbot of St. Alban’s, who was a great lover of books, and who died in\r\n1440. This conjecture, however, will not hold good, for the letter is\r\ncertainly intended for a B; and in the cut of the letter B there is\r\nwritten “_R. Beths._,” which is in all probability intended for an\r\nabbreviation of the name, “_Bethemsted_,” which occurs in another part\r\nof the book. The ink with which these names are written is nearly of the\r\nsame colour as that of the cuts. The characters appear to be of an\r\nearlier date than those on the reverse of the last leaf.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe cut at page 111, is that of the letter Z, which stands the wrong way\r\nin consequence of its not having been drawn reversed upon the block. The\r\nsubject might at first sight be supposed to represent the angel staying\r\nAbraham when about to sacrifice Isaac; but on examining the cut more\r\nclosely it will be perceived that the figure which might be mistaken for\r\nan angel is without wings, and appears to be in the act of supplicating\r\nthe old man, who with his left hand holds him by the hair.\r\n\r\nThe opposite cut, which is the last in the book, is an ornamental flower\r\ndesigned with great freedom and spirit, and surpassing everything of the\r\nkind executed on wood in the fifteenth century. I speak not of the style\r\nof engraving, which, though effective, is coarse; but of the taste\r\ndisplayed in the drawing. The colour of the cuts on pages 109, 110, 111,\r\nfrom the late Sir George Beaumont’s book, will give the reader, who has\r\nnot had an opportunity of examining the originals, some idea of the\r\ncolour in which the cuts of the Apocalypse, the History of the Virgin,\r\nthe Poor Preachers’ Bible, and the Speculum, are printed; which in all\r\nof them is a kind of sepia, in some inclining more to a yellow, and in\r\nothers more to a brown.\r\n\r\nIn the volume under consideration we may clearly perceive that the art\r\nof wood engraving had made considerable progress at the time the cuts\r\nwere executed. Although there are no attempts at cross-hatching, which\r\nwas introduced about 1486, yet the shadows are generally well indicated,\r\neither by thickening the line, or by courses of short parallel lines,\r\nmarking the folds of the drapery, or giving the appearance of rotundity\r\nto the figures. The expression of the heads displays considerable\r\ntalent, and the wood-engraver who at the present time could design and\r\nexecute such a series of figures, would be entitled to no small degree\r\nof commendation. Comparing those cuts with such as are to be seen in\r\nbooks typographically executed between 1461[II-87] and 1490, it is\r\nsurprising that the art of wood engraving should have so materially\r\ndeclined when employed by printers for the illustration of their books.\r\nThe best of the cuts printed with letter-press in the period referred to\r\nare decidedly inferior to the best of the early block-books.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-87: The first book with moveable types and wood-cuts\r\n    both printed by means of the press is the Fables printed at\r\n    Bamberg, by Albert Pfister, “Am Sant Valentinus tag,” 1461.]\r\n\r\nAs it would occupy too much space, and would be beyond the scope of the\r\npresent treatise to enter into a detail of the contents of all the\r\nblock-books noticed by Heineken, I shall give a brief description of\r\nthat named “Ars Memorandi,” and conclude the chapter with a list of such\r\nothers as are chiefly referred to by bibliographers.\r\n\r\nThe “ARS MEMORANDI” is considered by Schelhorn[II-88] and by Dr. Dibdin\r\nas one of the earliest block-books, and in their opinion I concur.\r\nHeineken, however,--who states that the style is almost the same as in\r\nthe figures of the Apocalypse,--thinks that it is of later date than the\r\nPoor Preachers’ Bible and the History of the Virgin. It is of a quarto\r\nsize, and consists of fifteen cuts, with the same number of separate\r\npages of text also cut on wood, and printed on one side of each leaf\r\nonly by means of friction.[II-89] At the foot of each page of text is a\r\nletter of the alphabet, commencing with +a+, indicating the order in\r\nwhich they are to follow each other. In every cut an animal is\r\nrepresented,--an eagle, an angel, an ox, or a lion,--emblematic of the\r\nEvangelist whose Gospel is to be impressed on the memory. Each of the\r\nanimals is represented standing upright, and marked with various signs\r\nexpressive of the contents of the different chapters. To the Gospel of\r\nSt. John, with which the book commences, three cuts with as many pages\r\nof text are allotted. St. Matthew has five cuts, and five pages of text.\r\nSt. Mark three cuts and three pages of text; and St. Luke four cuts and\r\nfour pages of text.[II-90]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-88: “Nostrum vero libellum, cujus gratia hæc præfati\r\n    sumus, intrepide, si non primum artis inventæ fœtum, certe inter\r\n    primos fuisse asseveramus.”--Amœnitates Literariæ, tom. i. p. 4.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-89: Heineken had seen two editions of this book, and\r\n    he gives fac-similes of their titles, which are evidently from\r\n    different blocks. The title at full length is as follows: “_Ars\r\n    memorandi notabilis per figuras Ewangelistarum hic ex post\r\n    descriptam quam diligens lector diligenter legat et practiset per\r\n    signa localia ut in practica experitur_.”--“En horridum et\r\n    incomtum dicendi genus, Priscianumque misere vapulantem!” exclaims\r\n    Schelhorn.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-90: Heineken, Idée Générale, p. 394.]\r\n\r\n“It is worthy of observation,” says J. C. Von Aretin, in his Essay on\r\nthe earliest Results of the Invention of Printing, “that this book,\r\nwhich the most intelligent bibliographers consider to be one of the\r\nearliest of its kind, should be devoted to the improvement of the\r\nmemory, which, though divested of much of its former importance by the\r\ninvention of writing, was to be rendered of still less consequence by\r\nthe introduction of printing.”[II-91]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-91: Über die frühesten universal historischen Folgen\r\n    der Erfindung der Buchdruckerkunst, von J. Christ. Freyherrn Von\r\n    Aretin, S. 18. 4to. Munich, 1808.]\r\n\r\nThe first cut is intended to express figuratively the first six chapters\r\nof St. John’s Gospel. The upright eagle is the emblem of the saint, and\r\nthe numerals are the references to the chapters. The contents of the\r\nfirst chapter are represented by the dove perched on the eagle’s head,\r\nand the two faces,--one of an old, the other of a young man,--probably\r\nintended for those of Moses and Christ.[II-92] The lute on the breast of\r\nthe eagle, with something like three bells[II-93] suspended from it,\r\nindicate the contents of the second chapter, and are supposed by\r\nSchelhorn to refer to the marriage of Cana. The numeral 3, in\r\nSchelhorn’s opinion, relates to “nonnihil apertum et prosectum circa\r\nventrem,” which he thinks may be intended as a reference to the words of\r\nNicodemus: “Nunquid homo senex potest in ventrem matris suæ iterum\r\nintroire et renasci?” Between the feet of the eagle is a water-bucket\r\nsurmounted by a sort of coronet or crown, intended to represent the\r\nprincipal events narrated in the 4th chapter, which are Christ’s talking\r\nwith the woman of Samaria at the well, and his healing the son of a\r\nnobleman at Capernaum. The 5th chapter is indicated by a fish above the\r\neagle’s right wing, which is intended to bring to mind the pool of\r\nBethesda. The principal event related in the 6th chapter, Christ feeding\r\nthe multitude, is indicated by the two fishes and five small loaves\r\nabove the eagle’s left wing. The cross within a circle, above the\r\nfishes, is emblematic of the consecrated wafer in the Lord’s supper, as\r\ncelebrated by the church of Rome.[II-94]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-92: “For the law was given by Moses, but grace and\r\n    truth came by Jesus Christ.”--St. John’s Gospel, chap. i. v. 17.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-93: “Forte tamen ea, quæ tintinnabulis haud videntur\r\n    dissimilia, nummulariorum loculos et pecuniæ receptacula\r\n    referunt.”--Schelhorn, Amœnit. Liter. tom. i. p. 10.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe above reduced copy of the cut will afford some idea of the manner in\r\nwhich the memory is to be assisted in recollecting the first six\r\nchapters of St. John. Those who wish to know more respecting this\r\ncurious book are referred to Schelhorn’s Amœnitates Literariæ, tom. i.\r\npp. 1-17; Heineken, Idée Générale, pp. 394, 395; and to Dr. Dibdin’s\r\nBibliotheca Spenceriana, vol. i. p. 4, where a copy is given of the\r\nfirst cut relating to the Gospel of St. Matthew.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-94: The following are the contents of the first page,\r\n    descriptive of the cut: “Evangelium Johannis habet viginti unum\r\n    capittula. Primum. In principio erat verbum de eternitate verbi et\r\n    de trinitate. Secundum capittulum. Nupcie facte sunt in Chana\r\n    Galilee et qualiter Christus subvertit mensas nummulariorum.\r\n    Tertium capittulum. Erat antem homo ex Phariseis Nycodemus nomine.\r\n    Quartum capittulum.

Lit. tom.\r\n    i. p. 9.]\r\n\r\nBlock-books containing both text and figures were executed long after\r\nthe introduction of typography, or printing by means of moveable types;\r\nbut the cuts in such works are decidedly inferior to those executed at\r\nan earlier period. The book entitled “Die Kunst Cyromantia,”[II-95]\r\nwhich consists chiefly of text, is printed from wood-blocks on both\r\nsides of each leaf by means of a press. At the conclusion of the title\r\nis the date 1448; but this is generally considered to refer to the\r\nperiod when the book was written, and not the time when it was engraved.\r\nOn the last page is the name: “+jorg schapff zu augspurg+.” If this\r\nGeorge Schapff was a wood-engraver of Augsburg, the style of the cuts in\r\nthe book sufficiently declares that he must have been one of the very\r\nlowest class. More wretched cuts were never chiselled out by a printer’s\r\napprentice as a head-piece to a half-penny ballad.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-95: This work on Palmistry was composed in German by\r\n    a Doctor Hartlieb, as is expressed at the beginning: “Das\r\n    nachgeschriben buch von der hand hätt zu teutsch gemacht Doctor\r\n    Hartlieb.” Specimens of the first and the last pages, and of one\r\n    of the cuts, are given in Heineken’s Idée Générale, plates 27 and\r\n    28.]\r\n\r\nOf the block-book entitled “Ars Moriendi,” Heineken enumerates no less\r\nthan seven editions, of which one is printed on both sides of the\r\nleaves, and by means of a press. Besides these he mentions another\r\nedition, impressed on one side of the paper only, in which appear the\r\nfollowing name and date: “+Hans eporer, 1473, hat diss puch pruffmo\r\ner+.”[II-96]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-96: I am of opinion that this is the same person who\r\n    executed the cuts for a German edition of the Poor Preachers’\r\n    Bible in 1475. His name does not appear; but on a shield of arms\r\n    there is a spur, which may be intended as a rebus of the name; in\r\n    the same manner as Albert Durer’s surname appears in his coat of\r\n    arms, a pair of doors,--_Durer_, or, as his father’s name was\r\n    sometimes spelled, _Thurer_.]\r\n\r\nOf the book named in German “+Der Entkrist+”--Antichrist--printed from\r\nwood-blocks, Heineken mentions two editions. In that which he considers\r\nthe first, containing thirty-nine cuts, each leaf is printed on one side\r\nonly by means of friction; in the other, which contains thirty-eight\r\ncuts, is the “brief-maler’s” or wood-engraver’s name: “+Der jung hanss\r\npriffmaler hat das puch zu nurenberg, 1472+.”\r\n\r\nAt Nuremberg, in the collection of a physician of the name of Treu,\r\nHeineken noticed a small volume in quarto, consisting of thirty-two\r\nwood-cuts of Bible subjects, underneath each of which were fifteen\r\nverses in German, engraved on the same block. Each leaf was printed on\r\none side only, and the impressions, which were in pale ink, had been\r\ntaken by means of friction.\r\n\r\nThe early wood-engravers, besides books of cuts, executed others\r\nconsisting of text only, of which several portions are preserved in\r\npublic libraries in Germany,[II-97] France, and Holland; and although it\r\nis certain that block-books continued to be engraved and printed several\r\nyears after the invention of typography, there can be little doubt that\r\neditions of the grammatical primer called the “Donatus,” from the name\r\nof its supposed compiler, were printed from wood-blocks previous to the\r\nearliest essays of Gutemberg to print with moveable types. It is indeed\r\nasserted that Gutemberg himself engraved, or caused to be engraved on\r\nwood, a “Donatus” before his grand invention was perfected.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-97: Aretin says that in the Royal Library at Munich\r\n    there are about forty books and about a hundred single leaves\r\n    printed from engraved wood-blocks.--Über die Folgen, &c. S. 6.]\r\n\r\nIn the Royal Library at Paris are preserved the two old blocks of a\r\n“Donatus” which are mentioned by Heineken at page 257 of his Idée\r\nGénérale. They are both of a quarto form; but as the one contains twenty\r\nlines and the other only sixteen, and as there is a perceptible\r\ndifference in the size of the letters, it is probable that they were\r\nengraved for different editions.[II-98] Those blocks were purchased in\r\nGermany by a Monsieur Faucault, and after passing through the hands of\r\nthree other book-collectors they came into the possession of the Duke de\r\nla Vallière, at whose sale they were sold for two hundred and thirty\r\nlivres. In De Bure’s catalogue of the La Vallière library, impressions\r\nare given from the original blocks. The letters in both those blocks,\r\nthough differing in size, are of the same proportions and form; and\r\nHeineken and Fischer consider that they bear a great resemblance to the\r\ncharacters of Faust and Scheffer’s Psalter, printed with moveable types\r\nin 1457, although the latter are considerably larger.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote II-98: Meerman had an old block of a Donatus, which was\r\n    obtained from the collection of a M. Hubert of Basle, and which\r\n    appeared to belong to the same edition as that containing sixteen\r\n    lines in the Royal Library at Paris.--Heineken, Idée Générale,\r\n    p. 258.]\r\n\r\nThe art of wood engraving, having advanced from a single figure with\r\nmerely a name cut underneath it, to the impression of entire pages of\r\ntext, was now to undergo a change. Moveable letters formed of metal, and\r\nwedged together within an iron frame, were to supersede the engraved\r\npage; and impressions, instead of being taken by the slow and tedious\r\nprocess of friction, were now to be obtained by the speedy and powerful\r\naction of the press. If the art of wood engraving suffered a temporary\r\ndecline for a few years after the general introduction of typography, it\r\nwas only to revive again under the protecting influence of the PRESS; by\r\nmeans of which its productions were to be multiplied a hundred fold,\r\nand, instead of being confined to a few towns, were to be disseminated\r\nthroughout every part of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nINVENTION OF TYPOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n  The Discovery of Desroches. -- The Stamping of Lodewyc Van Vaelbeke.\r\n  -- Early “Prenters” of Antwerp and Bruges Not Typographers. --\r\n  Cologne Chronicle. -- Donatuses Printed in Holland. -- Gutemberg’s\r\n  Birth and Family -- Progress of his Invention -- His Law-Suit with\r\n  the Drytzehns at Strasburg -- His Return to Mentz, and Partnership\r\n  with Faust -- Partnership Dissolved. -- Possibility of Printing with\r\n  Wooden Types Examined. -- Supposed Early Productions of Gutemberg\r\n  and Faust’s Press. -- Proofs of Gutemberg Having a Press of his Own.\r\n  -- The Vocabulary Printed at Elfeld. -- Gutemberg’s Death and\r\n  Epitaphs. -- Invention of Printing Claimed for Lawrence Coster. --\r\n  The Account Given by Junius -- Contradicted, Altered, and Amended at\r\n  Will by Meerman, Koning, and Others. -- Works Pretended to be\r\n  Printed with Coster’s Types. -- The Horarium Discovered by\r\n  Enschedius.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to trace the progress of wood engraving in connexion\r\nwith typography, it appears necessary to give some account of the\r\ninvention of the latter art. In the following brief narrative of\r\nGutemberg’s life, I shall adhere to positive facts; and until evidence\r\nequally good shall be produced in support of another’s claim to the\r\ninvention, I shall consider him as the father of typography. I shall\r\nalso give Hadrian Junius’s account of the invention of wood engraving,\r\nblock-printing, and typography by Lawrence Coster, with a few remarks on\r\nits credibility. Some of the conjectures and assertions of Meerman,\r\nKoning, and other advocates of Coster, will be briefly noticed, and\r\ntheir inconsistency pointed out. To attempt to refute at length the\r\ngratuitous assumptions of Coster’s advocates, and to enter into a detail\r\nof all their groundless arguments, would be like proving a medal to be a\r\nforgery by a long dissertation, when the modern fabricator has plainly\r\nput his name in the legend. The best proof of the fallacy of Coster’s\r\nclaims to the honour of having discovered the art of printing with\r\nmoveable types is to be found in the arguments of those by whom they\r\nhave been supported.\r\n\r\nMeerman, with all his research, has not been able to produce a single\r\nfact to prove that Lawrence Coster, or Lawrence Janszoon as he calls\r\nhim, ever printed a single book; and it is by no means certain that his\r\nhero is the identical Lawrence Coster mentioned by Junius. In order to\r\nsuit his own theory he has questioned the accuracy of the statements of\r\nJunius, and has thus weakened the very foundation of Coster’s claims.\r\nThe title of the custos of St. Bavon’s to the honour of being the\r\ninventor of typography must rest upon the authenticity of the account\r\ngiven by Junius; and how far this corresponds with established facts in\r\nthe history of wood engraving and typography I leave others to decide\r\nfor themselves.\r\n\r\nAmong the many fancied discoveries of the real inventor of the art of\r\nprinting, that of Monsieur Desroches, a member of the Imperial Academy\r\nof Sciences and Belles Lettres at Brussels, seems to require an especial\r\nnotice. In a paper printed in the transactions of that society,[III-1]\r\nhe endeavoured to prove, that the art of printing books was practised in\r\nFlanders about the beginning of the fourteenth century; and one of the\r\nprincipal grounds of his opinion was contained in an old chronicle of\r\nBrabant, written, as is supposed, by one Nicholas le Clerk, [Clericus,]\r\nsecretary to the city of Antwerp. The chronicler, after having described\r\nseveral remarkable events which happened during the government of John\r\nII. Duke of Brabant, who died in 1312, adds the following lines:\r\n\r\n  In dieser tyt sterf menschelyc\r\n  Die goede vedelare Lodewyc;\r\n  Die de beste was die voor dien\r\n  In de werelt ye was ghesien\r\n  Van makene ende metter hant;\r\n  Van Vaelbeke in Brabant\r\n  Alsoe was hy ghenant.\r\n  Hy was d’erste die vant\r\n  Van Stampien die manieren\r\n  Diemen noch hoert antieren.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-1: Nouvelles Recherches sur l’origine de\r\n    l’Imprimerie, dans lesquelles on fait voir que la première idée\r\n    est due aux Brabançons. Par M. Desroches. Lu à la séance du 8\r\n    Janvier, 1777.--Mémoires de l’Academie Impériale des Sciences et\r\n    Belles Lettres, tom. i. pp. 523-547. Edit 1780.]\r\n\r\nThis curious record, which Monsieur Desroches considered as so plain a\r\nproof of “die goede vedelare Lodewyc” being the inventor of printing,\r\nmay be translated in English as follows:\r\n\r\n  This year the way of all flesh went\r\n  Ludwig, the fidler most excellent;\r\n  For handy-work a man of name;\r\n  From Vaelbeke in Brabant he came.\r\n  He was the first who did find out\r\n  The art of beating time, no doubt,\r\n  (Displaying thus his meikle skill,)\r\n  And fidlers all practise it still.[III-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-2: The following is the French translation of\r\n    Monsieur Desroches: “En ces temps mourut de la mort commune à tous\r\n    les hommes, Louis _cet excellent faiseur d’instrumens de musique_,\r\n    le meilleur artist qu’on eut vû jusques-là dans l’univers, en fait\r\n    d’ouvrages mechaniques. Il étoit de Vaelbeke en Brabant, et il en\r\n    porta le nom. Il fut le premier qui inventa la manière d’imprimer,\r\n    qui est presentement en usage.” The reason of Monsieur Desroches\r\n    for his periphrasis of the simple word “vedelare”--fidler--is as\r\n    follows: “J’ai rendu _Vedelare_ par ‘faiseur d’instrumens de\r\n    musique.’ Le mot radical _est vedel_, violin: par consequent,\r\n    _Vedelare_ doit signifier celui qui en joue, ou qui en fait. Je me\r\n    suis determiné pour le dernier à cause des vers suivans, où il\r\n    n’est point question de jouer mais de faire. Si l’on préfère le\r\n    premier, je ne m’y opposerai pas; rien empêche que ce habile homme\r\n    n’ait été musicien.”--Mem. de l’Acad. de Brux. tom. i. p. 536.]\r\n\r\nThe laughable mistake of Monsieur Desroches in supposing that fidler\r\nLudwig’s invention, of beating time by stamping with the foot, related\r\nto the discovery of printing by means of the press, was pointed out in\r\n1779 by Monsieur Ghesquiere in a letter printed in the Esprit des\r\nJournaux.[III-3] In this letter Monsieur Ghesquiere shows that the\r\nFlemish word “Stampien,” used by the chronicler in his account of the\r\ninvention of the “good fidler Ludwig,” had not a meaning similar to that\r\nof the word “stampus” explained by Ducange, but that it properly\r\nsignified “met de voet kleppen,”--to stamp or beat with the feet.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-3: Lettre de M. J. G[hesquiere] à M. l’Abbé\r\n    Turberville Needham, directeur de l’Academie Impériale et Royale\r\n    de Bruxelles.--Printed in l’Esprit des Journaux for June 1779, pp.\r\n    232-260.]\r\n\r\nIn support of his opinion of the antiquity of printing, Monsieur\r\nDesroches refers to a manuscript in his possession, consisting of lives\r\nof the saints and a chronicle written in the fourteenth century. At the\r\nend of this manuscript was a catalogue of the books belonging to the\r\nmonastery of Wiblingen, the writing of which was much abbreviated, and\r\nwhich appeared to him to be of the following century. Among other\r\nentries in the catalogue was this: “(It.) dōicali īpv̄o līb^o ſtmp̄^to\r\nī bappiro nō s͞crpō.” On supplying the letters wanting Monsieur\r\nDesroches says that we shall have the following words: “Item.\r\nDominicalia in parvo libro stampato in bappiro [papyro,] non scripto;”\r\nthat is, “Item. Dominicals [a form of prayer or portion of church\r\nservice] in a small book printed [or stamped] on paper, not written.” In\r\nthe abbreviated word ſtm̄p̄^to, he says that the letter m could not very\r\nwell be distinguished; but the doubt which might thus arise he considers\r\nto be completely resolved by the words “_non scripto_,” and by the\r\nfollowing memorandum which occurs, in the same hand-writing, at the foot\r\nof the page: “Anno Dñi 1340 viguit q̄ fēt stāpā Dñatos,”-- “In 1340 he\r\nflourished who caused Donatuses to be printed.” If the catalogue were\r\nreally of the period supposed by Monsieur Desroches, the preceding\r\nextracts would certainly prove that the art of printing or stamping\r\nbooks, though not from moveable types, was practised in the fourteenth\r\ncentury; but, as the date has not been ascertained, its contents cannot\r\nbe admitted as evidence on the point in dispute. Monsieur Ghesquiere is\r\ninclined to think that the catalogue was not written before 1470; and,\r\nas the compiler was evidently an ignorant person, he thinks that in the\r\nnote, “Anno Domini 1340 viguit qui fecit stampare Donatos,” he might\r\nhave written 1340 instead of 1440.\r\n\r\nAlthough it has been asserted that the wood-cut of St. Christopher with\r\nthe date 1423, and the wood-cut of the Annunciation--probably of the\r\nsame period--were printed by means of a press, yet I consider it\r\nexceedingly doubtful if the press were employed to take impressions from\r\nwood-blocks before Gutemberg used it in his earliest recorded attempts\r\nto print with moveable types. I believe that in every one of the early\r\nblock-books, where opportunity has been afforded of examining the back\r\nof each cut, unquestionable evidence has been discovered of their having\r\nbeen _printed_, if I may here use the term, by means of friction.\r\nAlthough there is no mention of a _press_ which might be used to take\r\nimpressions before the process between Gutemberg and the heirs of one of\r\nhis partners, in 1439, yet “Prenters” were certainly known in Antwerp\r\nbefore his invention of printing with moveable types was brought to\r\nperfection. Desroches in his Essay on the Invention of Printing gives an\r\nextract from an order of the magistracy of Antwerp, in the year 1442, in\r\nfavour of the fellowship or guild of St. Luke, called also the Company\r\nof Painters, which consisted of Painters, Statuaries, Stone-cutters,\r\nGlass-makers, Illuminators, and “_Prenters_”. This fellowship was\r\ndoubtless similar to that of Venice, in whose favour a decree was made\r\nby the magistracy of that city in 1441, and of which some account has\r\nbeen given, at page 43, in the preceding chapter. There is evidence of a\r\nsimilar fellowship existing at Bruges in 1454; and John Mentelin, who\r\nafterwards established himself at Strasburg as a typographer or printer\r\nproper, was admitted a member of the Painters’ Company of that city as a\r\n“Chrysographus” or illuminator in 1447.[III-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-4: Lichtenberger, Initia Typographica, § De\r\n    Prenteris ante inventam Typographiam, p. 140.--Lambinet,\r\n    Recherches sur l’Origine de l’Imprimerie, p. 115.]\r\n\r\nWhether the “Prenters” of Antwerp in 1442 were acquainted with the use\r\nof the press, or not, is uncertain; but there can be little doubt of\r\ntheir not being _Printers_, as the word is now generally understood;\r\nthat is, persons who printed books with moveable types. They were most\r\nlikely block-printers, and such as engraved and printed cards and images\r\nof saints; and it would seem that typographers were not admitted members\r\nof the society; for of all the early typographers of Antwerp the name of\r\none only, Mathias Van der Goes, appears in the books of the fellowship\r\nof St. Luke; and he perhaps may have been admitted as a wood-engraver,\r\non account of the cuts in an herbal printed with his types, without\r\ndate, but probably between 1485 and 1490.\r\n\r\nGhesquiere, who successfully refuted the opinion of Desroches that\r\ntypography was known at Antwerp in 1442, was himself induced to suppose\r\nthat it was practised at Bruges in 1445, and that printed books were\r\nthen neither very scarce nor very dear in that city.[III-5] In an old\r\nmanuscript journal or memorandum book of Jean-le-Robèrt, abbot of St.\r\nAubert in the diocese of Cambray, he observed an entry stating that the\r\nsaid abbot had purchased at Bruges, in January 1446, a “_Doctrinale\r\ngette en mole_” for the use of his nephew. The words “gette en mole” he\r\nconceives to mean, “printed in type;” and he thinks that the Doctrinale\r\nmentioned was the work which was subsequently printed at Geneva, in\r\n1478, under the title of Le Doctrinal de Sapience, and at Westminster by\r\nCaxton, in 1489, under the title of The Doctrinal of Sapyence. The Abbé\r\nMercier de St. Leger, who wrote a reply to the observations of\r\nGhesquiere, with greater probability supposes that the book was printed\r\nfrom engraved wood-blocks, and that it was the “Doctrinale Alexandri\r\nGalli,” a short grammatical treatise in monkish rhyme, which at that\r\nperiod was almost as popular as the “Donatus,” and of which odd leaves,\r\nprinted on both sides, are still to be seen in libraries which are rich\r\nin early specimens of printing.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-5: Reflexions sur deux pièces relatives à l’Hist. de\r\n    l’Imprimerie. Nivelles, 1780.--Lambinet, Recherches, p. 394.]\r\n\r\nAlthough there is every reason to believe that the early Printers of\r\nAntwerp and Bruges were not acquainted with the use of moveable types,\r\nyet the mention of such persons at so early a period, and the notice of\r\nthe makers “of cards and printed figures” at Venice in 1441,\r\nsufficiently declare that, though wood engraving might be first\r\nestablished as a profession in Suabia, it was known, and practised to a\r\nconsiderable extent, in other countries previous to 1450.\r\n\r\nThe Cologne Chronicle, which was printed in 1499, has been most unfairly\r\nquoted by the advocates of Coster in support of their assertions; and\r\nthe passage which appeared most to favour their argument they have\r\nascribed to Ulric Zell, the first person who established a press at\r\nCologne. A shrewd German,[III-6] however, has most clearly shown, from\r\nthe same chronicle, that the actual testimony of Ulric Zell is directly\r\nin opposition to the claims advanced by the advocates of Coster. The\r\npassage on which they rely is to the following effect: “Item: although\r\nthe art [of printing] as it is now commonly practised, was discovered at\r\nMentz, yet the first conception of it was discovered in Holland from the\r\nDonatuses, which before that time were printed there.” This we are given\r\nto understand by Meerman and Koning is the statement of Ulric Zell.\r\nA little further on, however, the Chronicler, who in the above passage\r\nappears to have been speaking in his own person from popular report,\r\nthus proceeds: “But the first inventor of printing was a citizen of\r\nMentz, though born at Strasburg,[III-7] named John Gutemberg: Item: from\r\nMentz the above-named art first came to Cologne, afterwards to\r\nStrasburg, and then to Venice. This account of the commencement and\r\nprogress of the said art was communicated to me by word of mouth by that\r\nworthy person Master Ulric Zell of Hanau, at the present time [1499]\r\na printer in Cologne, through whom the said art was brought to Cologne.”\r\nAt this point the advocates of Coster stop, as the very next sentence\r\ndeprives them of any advantage which they might hope to gain from the\r\n“impartial testimony of the Cologne Chronicle,” the compiler of which\r\nproceeds as follows: “Item: there are certain _fanciful people_ who say\r\nthat books were printed before; but _this is not true_; for in no\r\ncountry are books to be found printed before that time.”[III-8]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-6: Friedrich Lehne, Einige Bemerkungen über das\r\n    Unternehmen der gelehrten Gesellschaft zu Harlem, ihrer Stadt die\r\n    Ehre der Erfindung der Buchdruckerkunst zu ertrotzen, S. 24-26.\r\n    Zweite Ausgabe, Mainz. 1825.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-7: This is a mistake into which the compiler of the\r\n    chronicle printed at Rome, 1474, by Philippus de Lignamine, has\r\n    also fallen. Gutemberg was not a native of Strasburg, but of\r\n    Mentz.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-8: Mallinkrot appears to have been the first who\r\n    gave a translation of the entire passage in the Cologne Chronicle\r\n    which relates to the invention of printing. His version of the\r\n    last sentence is as follows: “Reperiuntur Scioli aliquot qui\r\n    dicant, dudum ante hæc tempora typorum ope libros excusos esse,\r\n    qui tamen et se et alios decipiunt; nullibi enim terrarum libri eo\r\n    tempore impressi reperiuntur.”--De Ortu et Progressu Artis\r\n    Typographicæ, p. 38. Colon. Agrippinæ, 1640.]\r\n\r\nThat “Donatuses” and other small elementary books for the use of schools\r\nwere printed from wood-blocks previous to the invention of typography\r\nthere can be little doubt; and it is by no means unlikely that they\r\nmight be first printed in Holland or in Flanders. At any rate an opinion\r\nseems to have been prevalent at an early period that the idea of\r\nprinting with moveable types was first derived from a “Donatus,”[III-9]\r\nprinted from wood-blocks. In the petition of Conrad Sweinheim and Arnold\r\nPannartz, two Germans, who first established a press at Rome, addressed\r\nto Pope Sixtus IV. in 1472, stating the expense which they had incurred\r\nin printing books, and praying for assistance, they mention amongst\r\nother works printed by them, “DONATI pro puerulis, unde IMPRIMENDI\r\nINITIUM sumpsimus;” that is: “Donatuses for boys, whence we have taken\r\nthe beginning of printing.” If this passage is to be understood as\r\nreferring to the origin of typography, and not to the first proofs of\r\ntheir own press, it is the earliest and the best evidence on the point\r\nwhich has been adduced; for it is very likely that both these printers\r\nhad acquired a knowledge of their art at Mentz in the very office where\r\nit was first brought to perfection.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-9: Angelus Rocca mentions having seen a “Donatus” on\r\n    parchment, at the commencement of which was written in the hand of\r\n    Mariangelus Accursius, who flourished about 1530: “Impressus est\r\n    autem hic _Donatus_ et _Confessionalia_ primùm omnium anno MCCCCL.\r\n    Admonitus certè fuit ex _Donato_ Hollandiæ, prius impresso in\r\n    tabula incisa.”--Bibliotheca Vaticana commentario illustrata,\r\n    1591, cited by Prosper Marchand in his Hist. de l’Imprimerie, 2nde\r\n    Partie, p. 35. It is likely that Accursius derived his information\r\n    about a Donatus being printed in Holland from the Cologne\r\n    Chronicle.]\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1400, Henne, or John Gænsfleisch de Sulgeloch, called\r\nalso John Gutemberg zum Jungen, appears to have been born at Mentz. He\r\nhad two brothers; Conrad who died in 1424, and Friele who was living in\r\n1459. He had also two sisters, Bertha and Hebele, who were both nuns of\r\nSt. Claire at Mentz. Gutemberg had an uncle by his father’s side, named\r\nFriele, who had three sons, named John, Friele, and Pederman, who were\r\nall living in 1459.\r\n\r\nGutemberg was descended of an honourable family, and he himself is said\r\nto have been by birth a knight.[III-10] It would appear that the family\r\nhad been possessed of considerable property. They had one house in Mentz\r\ncalled zum Gænsfleisch, and another called zum Gudenberg, or Gutenberg,\r\nwhich Wimpheling translates, “Domum boni montis.” The local name of\r\nSulgeloch, or Sorgenloch, was derived from the name of a village where\r\nthe family of Gænsfleisch had resided previous to their removing to\r\nMentz. It seems probable that the house zum Jungen at Mentz came into\r\nthe Gutembergs’ possession by inheritance. It was in this house,\r\naccording to the account of Trithemius, that the printing business was\r\ncarried on during his partnership with Faust.[III-11]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-10: Schwartz observes that in the instrument drawn\r\n    up by the notary Ulric Helmasperger, Gutemberg is styled\r\n    “_Juncker_,” an honourable addition which was at that period\r\n    expressive of nobility.--Primaria quædam Documenta de Origine\r\n    Typographiæ, p. 20, 4to. Altorfii, 1740.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-11: “Morabatur autem prædictus Joannes Gutenberg\r\n    Moguntiæ in domo _zum Jungen_, quæ domus usque in præsentem diem\r\n    [1513] illius novæ Artis nomine noscitur insignita.”--Trithemii\r\n    Chronicum Spanhemiense, ad annum 1450.]\r\n\r\nWhen Gutemberg called himself der Junge, or junior, it was doubtless to\r\ndistinguish himself from Gænsfleisch _der Elter_, or senior, a name\r\nwhich frequently occurs in the documents printed by Koehler. Meerman has\r\nfixed upon the latter name for the purpose of giving to Gutemberg a\r\nbrother of the same christian name, and of making him the thief who\r\nstole Coster’s types. He also avails himself of an error committed by\r\nWimpheling and others, who had supposed John Gutemberg and John\r\nGænsfleisch to be two different persons. In two deeds of sale, however,\r\nof the date 1441 and 1442, entered in the Salic book of the church of\r\nSt. Thomas at Strasburg, he is thus expressly named: “_Joannes dictus\r\nGensfleisch alias nuncupatus Gutenberg de Moguncia, Argentinæ\r\ncommorans_;” that is, “John Gænsfleisch, otherwise named Gutemberg, of\r\nMentz, residing at Strasburg.”[III-12] Anthony à Wood, in his History of\r\nthe University of Oxford, calls him Tossanus; and Chevillier, in his\r\nOrigine de l’Imprimerie de Paris, Toussaints. Seiz[III-13] is within an\r\nace of making him a knight of the Golden Fleece. That he was a man of\r\nproperty is proved by various documents; and those writers who have\r\ndescribed him as a person of mean origin, or as so poor as to be obliged\r\nto labour as a common workman, are certainly wrong.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-12: In the release which he grants to the town-clerk\r\n    of Mentz, in 1434, he describes himself as, “Johann Gensefleisch\r\n    der Junge, genant Gutemberg.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-13: In “Het derde Jubeljaer der uitgevondene\r\n    Boekdrukkonst door Laurens Jansz Koster,” p. 71. Harlem,\r\n    1740.--Oberlin, Essai d’Annales.]\r\n\r\nFrom a letter written by Gutemberg in 1424 to his sister Bertha it\r\nappears that he was then residing at Strasburg; and it is also certain\r\nthat in 1430 he was not living at Mentz; for in an act of accommodation\r\nbetween the nobility and burghers of that city, passed in that year with\r\nthe authority of the archbishop Conrad III., Gutemberg is mentioned\r\namong the nobles “_die ytzund nit inlendig sint_”--“who are not at\r\npresent in the country.” In 1434 there is positive evidence of his\r\nresiding at Strasburg; for in that year he caused the town-clerk of\r\nMentz to be arrested for a sum of three hundred florins due to him from\r\nthe latter city, and he agreed to his release at the instance of the\r\nmagistrates of Strasburg within whose jurisdiction the arrest took\r\nplace.[III-14] In 1436 he entered into partnership with Andrew Drytzehn\r\nand others; and there is every reason to believe that at this period he\r\nwas engaged in making experiments on the practicability of printing with\r\nmoveable types, and that the chief object of his engaging with those\r\npersons was to obtain funds to enable him to perfect his invention.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-14: The release is given in Schœpflin’s Vindiciæ\r\n    Typographicæ, Documentum I.]\r\n\r\nFrom 1436 to 1444 the name of Gutemberg appears among the\r\n“_Constaflers_” or civic nobility of Strasburg. In 1437 he was summoned\r\nbefore the ecclesiastical judge of that city at the suit of Anne of\r\nIron-Door,[III-15] for breach of promise of marriage. It would seem that\r\nhe afterwards fulfilled his promise, for in a tax-book of the city of\r\nStrasburg, Anne Gutemberg is mentioned, after Gutemberg had returned to\r\nMentz, as paying the toll levied on wine.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-15: “_Ennelin zu der Iserin Thure._” She was then\r\n    living at Strasburg, and was of an honourable family, originally\r\n    of Alsace.--Schœpflin. Vind. Typ. p. 17.]\r\n\r\nAndrew Drytzehn, one of Gutemberg’s partners, having died in 1438, his\r\nbrothers George and Nicholas instituted a process against Gutemberg to\r\ncompel him either to refund the money advanced by their brother, or to\r\nadmit them to take his place in the partnership. From the depositions of\r\nthe witnesses in this cause, which, together with the decision of the\r\njudges, are given at length by Schœpflin, there can be little doubt that\r\none of the inventions which Gutemberg agreed to communicate to his\r\npartners was an improvement in the art of printing, such as it was at\r\nthat period.\r\n\r\nThe following particulars concerning the partnership of Gutemberg with\r\nAndrew Drytzehn and others are derived from the recital of the case\r\ncontained in the decision of the judges. Some years before his death,\r\nAndrew Drytzehn expressed a desire to learn one of Gutemberg’s arts, for\r\nhe appears to have been fond of trying new experiments, and the latter\r\nacceding to his request taught him a method of polishing stones, by\r\nwhich he gained considerable profit. Some time afterwards, Gutemberg, in\r\ncompany with a person named John Riff, began to exercise a certain art\r\nwhose productions were in demand at the fair of Aix-la-Chapelle. Andrew\r\nDrytzehn, hearing of this, begged that the new art might be explained to\r\nhim, promising at the same time to give whatever premium should be\r\nrequired. Anthony Heilman also made a similar request for his brother\r\nAndrew Heilman.[III-16] To both these applications Gutemberg assented,\r\nagreeing to teach them the art; it being stipulated that the two new\r\npartners were to receive a fourth part of the profits between them; that\r\nRiff was to have another fourth; and that the remaining half should be\r\nreceived by the inventor. It was also agreed that Gutemberg should\r\nreceive from each of the new partners the sum of eighty florins of gold\r\npayable by a certain day, as a premium for communicating to them his\r\nart. The great fair of Aix-la-Chapelle being deferred to another year,\r\nGutemberg’s two new partners requested that he would communicate to them\r\nwithout reserve all his wonderful and rare inventions; to which he\r\nassented on condition that to the former sum of one hundred and sixty\r\nflorins they should jointly advance two hundred and fifty more, of which\r\none hundred were to be paid immediately, and the then remaining\r\nseventy-five florins due by each were to be paid at three instalments.\r\nOf the hundred florins stipulated to be paid in ready money, Andrew\r\nHeilman paid fifty, according to his engagement, while Andrew Drytzehn\r\nonly paid forty, leaving ten due. The term of the partnership for\r\ncarrying on the “wonderful art” was fixed at five years; and it was also\r\nagreed that if any of the partners should die within that period, his\r\ninterest in the utensils and stock should become vested in the surviving\r\npartners, who at the completion of the term were to pay to the heirs of\r\nthe deceased the sum of one hundred florins. Andrew Drytzehn having died\r\nwithin the period, and when there remained a sum of eighty-five florins\r\nunpaid by him, Gutemberg met the claim of his brothers by referring to\r\nthe articles of partnership, and insisted that from the sum of one\r\nhundred florins which the surviving partners were bound to pay, the\r\neighty-five remaining unpaid by the deceased should be deducted. The\r\nbalance of fifteen florins thus remaining due from the partnership he\r\nexpressed his willingness to pay, although according to the terms of the\r\nagreement it was not payable until the five years were expired, and\r\nwould thus not be strictly due for some years to come. The claim of\r\nGeorge Drytzehn to be admitted a partner, as the heir of his brother, he\r\nopposed, on the ground of his being unacquainted with the obligations of\r\nthe partnership; and he also denied that Andrew Drytzehn had ever become\r\nsecurity for the payment of any sum for lead or other things purchased\r\non account of the business, except to Fridelin von Seckingen, and that\r\nthis sum (which was owing for lead) Gutemberg himself paid. The judges\r\nhaving heard the allegations of both parties, and having examined the\r\nagreement between Gutemberg and Andrew Drytzehn, decided that the\r\neighty-five florins which remained unpaid by the latter should be\r\ndeducted from the hundred which were to be repaid in the event of any\r\none of the partners dying; and that Gutemberg should pay the balance of\r\nfifteen florins to George and Nicholas Drytzehn, and that when this sum\r\nshould be paid they should have no further claim on the\r\npartnership.[III-17]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-16: When Andrew Heilman was proposed as a partner,\r\n    Gutemberg observed that his friends would perhaps treat the\r\n    business into which he was about to embark as mere jugglery\r\n    [göckel werck], and object to his having anything to do with\r\n    it.--Schœpflin, Vind. Typ.

As Gutemberg lived near the\r\nmonastery of St. Arbogast, which was without the walls of the city, it\r\nappears that the attempts to perfect his invention were carried on in\r\nthe house of his partner Andrew Drytzehn. Upon the death of the latter,\r\nGutemberg appears to have been particularly anxious that “four _pieces_”\r\nwhich were in a “press” should be “distributed,”--making use of the very\r\nword which is yet used in Germany to express the distribution or\r\nseparation of a form of types---so that no person should know what they\r\nwere.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-18: Traité de l’origine et des productions de\r\n    l’Imprimerie primitive en taille de bois, Paris, 1758; et\r\n    Remarques sur un Ouvrage, &c. pour servir de suite au Traité,\r\n    Paris, 1762.]\r\n\r\nHans Schultheis, a dealer in wood, and Ann his wife, depose to the\r\nfollowing effect: After the death of Andrew Drytzehn, Gutemberg’s\r\nservant, Lawrence Beildeck, came to their house, and thus addressed\r\ntheir relation Nicholas Drytzehn: “Your deceased brother Andrew had four\r\n“pieces” placed under a press, and John Gutemberg requests that you will\r\ntake them out and lay them separately [or apart from each other] upon\r\nthe press so that no one may see what it is.”[III-19]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-19: “Andres Dritzehn uwer bruder selige hat iiij\r\n    stücke undenan inn einer _pressen_ ligen, da hat uch Hanns\r\n    Gutemberg gebetten das ir die darusz nement ünd uff die presse\r\n    legent von einander so kan man nit gesehen was das\r\n    ist.”--Schœpflin, Vind.

The\r\nsaid “pieces” he was then to place in or upon the press, so that no\r\nperson might see or understand them.\r\n\r\nAnthony Heilman, the brother of one of Gutemberg’s partners, states that\r\nhe knew of Gutemberg having sent his servant shortly before Christmas\r\nboth to Andrew Heilman and Andrew Drytzehn to bring away all the “forms”\r\n[formen] that they might be separated in his presence, as he found\r\nseveral things in them of which he disapproved.[III-22] The same witness\r\nalso states that he was well aware of many people being wishful to see\r\nthe press, and that Gutemberg had desired that they should send some\r\nperson to prevent its being seen.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-22: “Dirre gezuge hat ouch geseit das er wol wisse\r\n    das Gutenberg unlange vor Wihnahten sinen kneht sante zu den beden\r\n    Andresen, alle _formen_ zu holen, und würdent zur lossen das er\r\n    ess sehe, un jn joch ettliche formen ruwete.”--Schœpflin, Vind.\r\n    Typ.

They are thus named by Joh. and\r\n    Vindelin de Spire in 1469; by Franciscus Philelphus in 1470; by\r\n    Ludovicus Carbo in 1471; and by Phil. de Lignamine in\r\n    1474.--Lichtenberger, Init. Typ. p. 11.]\r\n\r\nHans Dünne, a goldsmith, deposed that about three years before, he had\r\ndone work for Gutemberg on account of printing alone to the amount of a\r\nhundred florins.[III-23]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-23: “Hanns Dünne der goltsmyt hat gesait, das er vor\r\n    dryen jaren oder daby Gutemberg by den hundert guldin verdienet\r\n    habe, alleine das zu dem _trucken_ gehöret”--Schœpflin, Vind. Typ.\r\n    Document. p. 13.]\r\n\r\nAs Gutemberg evidently had kept his art as secret as possible, it is not\r\nsurprising that the notice of it by the preceding witnesses should not\r\nbe more explicit. Though it may be a matter of doubt whether his\r\ninvention was merely an improvement on block-printing, or an attempt to\r\nprint with moveable types, yet, bearing in mind that express mention is\r\nmade of a _press_ and of _printing_, and taking into consideration his\r\nsubsequent partnership with Faust, it is morally certain that\r\nGutemberg’s attention had been occupied with some new discovery relative\r\nto printing at least three years previous to December 1439.\r\n\r\nIf Gutemberg’s attempts when in partnership with Andrew Drytzehn and\r\nothers did not extend beyond block-printing, and if the four “pieces”\r\nwhich were in the press are assumed to have been four engraved blocks,\r\nit is evident that the mere unscrewing them from the “_chase_” or frame\r\nin which they might be enclosed, would not in the least prevent persons\r\nfrom knowing what they were; and it is difficult to conceive how the\r\nundoing of the two screws would cause “the pieces” to fall asunder. If,\r\nhowever, we suppose the four “pieces” to have been so many pages of\r\nmoveable types screwed together in a frame, it is easy to conceive the\r\neffect of undoing the two screws which held it together. On this\r\nhypothesis, Gutemberg’s instructions to his servant, and Anthony\r\nHeilman’s request to Conrad Saspach, the maker of the press, that he\r\nwould take out the “pieces” and distribute them, are at once\r\nintelligible. If Gutemberg’s attempts were confined to block-printing,\r\nhe could certainly have no claim to the discovery of a new art, unless\r\nindeed we are to suppose that his invention consisted in the\r\nintroduction of the press for the purpose of taking impressions; but it\r\nis apparent that his anxiety was not so much to prevent people seeing\r\nthe press as to keep them ignorant of the purpose for which it was\r\nemployed, and to conceal what was in it.\r\n\r\nThe evidence of Hans Dünne the goldsmith, though very brief, is in\r\nfavour of the opinion that Gutemberg’s essays in printing were made with\r\nmoveable types of metal; and it also is corroborated by the fact of\r\n_lead_ being one of the articles purchased on account of the\r\npartnership. It is certain that goldsmiths were accustomed to engrave\r\nletters and figures upon silver and other metals long before the art of\r\ncopper-plate printing was introduced; and Fournier not attending to the\r\ndistinction between simple engraving on metal and engraving on a plate\r\nfor the purpose of taking impressions on paper, has made a futile\r\nobjection to the argument of Bär,[III-24] who very naturally supposes\r\nthat the hundred florins which Hans Dünne received from Gutemberg for\r\nwork done on account of printing alone, might be on account of his\r\nhaving cut the types, the formation of which by means of punches and\r\nmatrices was a subsequent improvement of Peter Scheffer. It is indeed\r\ndifficult to conceive in what manner a goldsmith could earn a hundred\r\nflorins for work done on account of printing, except in his capacity as\r\nan engraver; and as I can see no reason to suppose that Hans Dünne was\r\nan engraver on wood, I am inclined to think that he was employed by\r\nGutemberg to cut the letters on separate pieces of metal.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-24: The words of Bär, who was almoner of the Swedish\r\n    chapel at Paris in 1761, are these: “Tout le monde sait que dans\r\n    ce temps les orfèvres exerçoient aussi l’art de la gravûre; et\r\n    nous concluons de-là que Guttemberg a commencé par des caractères\r\n    de bois, que de-là il a passé aux caractères de plomb.” On this\r\n    passage Fournier makes the following observations: “Tout le monde\r\n    sait au contraire que dans ce temps il n’y avoit pas un seul\r\n    graveur dans le genre dont vous parlez, et cela par une raison\r\n    bien simple: c’est que cet art de la gravûre n’a été inventé que\r\n    vingt-trois ans après ce que vous citez, c’est-à-dire en 1460, par\r\n    _Masso Piniguera_.”--Remarques, &c. p. 20. Bär mentioned no\r\n    particular kind of engraving; and the name of the Italian\r\n    goldsmith who is supposed to have been the first who discovered\r\n    the art of taking impressions from a plate on paper, was\r\n    Finiguerra, not Piniguera, as Fournier, with his usual inaccuracy,\r\n    spells it.]\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence to show that Gutemberg succeeded in printing any\r\nbooks at Strasburg with moveable types: and the most likely conclusion\r\nseems to be that he did not. As the process between him and the\r\nDrytzehns must have given a certain degree of publicity to his\r\ninvention, it might be expected that some notice would have been taken\r\nof its first-fruits had he succeeded in making it available in\r\nStrasburg. On the contrary, all the early writers in the least entitled\r\nto credit, who have spoken of the invention of printing with moveable\r\ntypes, agree in ascribing the honour to Mentz, after Gutemberg had\r\nreturned to that city and entered into partnership with Faust. Two\r\nwriters, however, whose learning and research are entitled to the\r\nhighest respect, are of a different opinion. “It has been doubted,” says\r\nProfessor Oberlin, “that Gutemberg ever printed books at Strasburg. It\r\nis, nevertheless, probable that he did; for he had a press there in\r\n1439, and continued to reside in that city for five years afterwards. He\r\nmight print several of those small tracts without date, in which the\r\ninequality of the letters and rudeness of the workmanship indicate the\r\ninfancy of the art. Schœpflin thinks that he can identify some of them;\r\nand the passages cited by him clearly show that printing had been\r\ncarried on there.”[III-25] It is, however, to be remarked that the\r\npassages cited by Schœpflin, and referred to by Oberlin, by no means\r\nshow that the art of printing had been practised at Strasburg by\r\nGutemberg; nor do they clearly prove that it had been continuously\r\ncarried on there by his partners or others to the time of Mentelin, who\r\nprobably established himself there as a printer in 1466.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-25: Essai d’Annales de la Vie de Jean Gutenberg, par\r\n    Jer. J. Oberlin. 8vo. Strasbourg, An ix. [1802.]]\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that Gutemberg’s first essays in typography were made\r\nwith wooden types; and Daniel Specklin, an architect of Strasburg, who\r\ndied in 1589, professed to have seen some of them. According to his\r\naccount there was a hole pierced in each letter, and they were arranged\r\nin lines by a string being passed through them. The lines thus formed\r\nlike a string of beads were afterwards collected into pages, and\r\nsubmitted to the press. Particles and syllables of frequent occurrence\r\nwere not formed of separate letters, but were cut on single pieces of\r\nwood. We are left to conjecture the size of those letters; but if they\r\nwere sufficiently large to allow of a hole being bored through them, and\r\nto afterwards sustain the action of the press, they could not well be\r\nless than the missal types with which Faust and Scheffer’s Psalter is\r\nprinted. It is however likely that Specklin had been mistaken; and that\r\nhe had supposed some old initial letters, large enough to admit of a\r\nhole being bored through them without injury, to have been such as were\r\ngenerally used in the infancy of the art.\r\n\r\nIn 1441 and 1442, Gutemberg, who appears to have been always in want of\r\nmoney, executed deeds of sale to the dean and chapter of the collegiate\r\nchurch of St. Thomas at Strasburg, whereby he assigned to them certain\r\nrents and profits in Mentz which he inherited from his uncle John\r\nLeheymer, who had been a judge in that city. In 1443 and 1444\r\nGutemberg’s name still appears in the rate or tax book of Strasburg; but\r\nafter the latter year it is no longer to be found. About 1445, it is\r\nprobable that he returned to Mentz, his native city, having apparently\r\nbeen unsuccessful in his speculations at Strasburg. From this period to\r\n1450 it is likely that he continued to employ himself in attempts to\r\nperfect his invention of typography. In 1450 he entered into partnership\r\nwith John Faust, a goldsmith and native of Mentz, and it is from this\r\nyear that Trithemius dates the invention. In his Annales Hirsaugienses,\r\nunder the year 1450, he gives the following account of the first\r\nestablishment and early progress of the art. “About this time [1450], in\r\nthe city of Mentz upon the Rhine, in Germany, and not in Italy as some\r\nhave falsely stated, this wonderful and hitherto unheard of art of\r\nprinting was conceived and invented by John Gutemberg, a citizen of\r\nMentz. He had expended nearly all his substance on the invention; and\r\nbeing greatly pressed for want of means, was about to abandon it in\r\ndespair, when, through the advice and with the money furnished by John\r\nFaust, also a citizen of Mentz, he completed his undertaking. At first\r\nthey printed the vocabulary called the _Catholicon_, from letters cut on\r\nblocks of wood. These letters however could not be used to print\r\nanything else, as they were not separately moveable, but were cut on the\r\nblocks as above stated. To this invention succeeded others more subtle,\r\nand they afterwards invented a method of casting the shapes, named by\r\nthem _matrices_, of all the letters of the Roman alphabet, from which\r\nthey again cast letters of copper or tin, sufficient to bear any\r\npressure to which they might be subjected, and which they had formerly\r\ncut by hand. As I have heard, nearly thirty years ago, from Peter\r\nScheffer, of Gernsheim, citizen of Mentz, who was son-in-law of the\r\nfirst inventor, great difficulties attended the first establishment of\r\nthis art; for when they had commenced printing a Bible they found that\r\nupwards of four thousand florins had been expended before they had\r\nfinished the third _quaternion_ [or quire of four sheets]. Peter\r\nScheffer, an ingenious and prudent man, at first the servant, and\r\nafterwards, as has been already said, the son-in-law of John Faust, the\r\nfirst inventor, discovered the more ready mode of casting the types, and\r\nperfected the art as it is at present exercised. These three for some\r\ntime kept their method of printing a secret, till at length it was\r\ndivulged by some workmen whose assistance they could not do without. It\r\nfirst passed to Strasburg, and gradually to other nations.”[III-26]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-26: Trithemii Annales Hirsaugienses, tom. ii. ad\r\n    annum 1450. The original passage is printed in Prosper Marchand’s\r\n    Histoire de l’Imprimerie, 2nde Partie, p. 7.]\r\n\r\nAs Trithemius finished the work which contains the preceding account in\r\n1514, Marchand concludes that he must have received his information from\r\nScheffer about 1484, which would be within thirty-five years of\r\nGutemberg’s entering into a partnership with Faust. Although Trithemius\r\nhad his information from so excellent an authority, yet the account\r\nwhich he has thus left is far from satisfactory. Schœpflin, amongst\r\nother objections to its accuracy, remarks that Trithemius is wrong in\r\nstating that the invention of moveable types was subsequent to\r\nGutemberg’s connexion with Faust, seeing that the former had previously\r\nemployed them at Strasburg; and he also observes that in the learned\r\nabbot’s account there is no distinct mention made of moveable letters\r\ncut by hand, but that we are led to infer that the improvement of\r\ncasting types from matrices immediately followed the printing of the\r\nCatholicon from wood-blocks. The words of Trithemius on this point are\r\nas follows: “Post hæc, inventis successerunt subtiliora, inveneruntque\r\nmodum fundendi formas omnium Latini alphabeti litterarum, quas ipsi\r\n_matrices_ nominabant, ex quibus rursum æneos sive stanneos characteres\r\nfundebant ad omnem pressuram sufficientes quos prius manibus\r\nsculpebant.” From this passage it might be objected in opposition to the\r\nopinion of Schœpflin:[III-27] 1. That the “subtiliora,”--more subtle\r\ncontrivances, mentioned _before_ the invention of casting moveable\r\nletters, may relate to the cutting of such letters by hand. 2. That the\r\nword “quos” is to be referred to the antecedent “æneos sive stanneos\r\ncharacteres,”--letters of copper or tin,--and not to the “characteres in\r\ntabulis ligneis scripti,”--letters engraved on wood-blocks,--which are\r\nmentioned in a preceding sentence. The inconsistency of Trithemius in\r\nascribing the origin of the art to Gutemberg, and twice immediately\r\nafterwards calling Scheffer the son-in-law of “the first inventor,”\r\nFaust, is noticed by Schœpflin, and has been pointed out by several\r\nother writers.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-27: Vindiciæ Typographicæ, pp. 77, 78.]\r\n\r\nIn 1455 the partnership between Gutemberg and Faust was dissolved at the\r\ninstance of the latter, who preferred a suit against his partner for the\r\nrecovery, with interest, of certain sums of money which he had advanced.\r\nThere is no mention of the time when the partnership commenced in the\r\nsentence or award of the judge; but Schwartz infers, from the sum\r\nclaimed on account of interest, that it must have been in August 1449.\r\nIt is probable that his conclusion is very near the truth; for most of\r\nthe early writers who have mentioned the invention of printing at Mentz\r\nby Gutemberg and Faust, agree in assigning the year 1450 as that in\r\nwhich they began to practise the new art. It is conjectured by Santander\r\nthat Faust, who seems to have been a selfish character,[III-28] sought\r\nan opportunity of quarrelling with Gutemberg as soon as Scheffer had\r\ncommunicated to him his great improvement of forming the letters by\r\nmeans of punches and matrices.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-28: In the first work which issued from Faust and\r\n    Scheffer’s press, with a date and the printer’s names,--the\r\n    Psalter of 1457,--and in several others, Scheffer appears on an\r\n    equal footing with Faust. In the colophon of an edition of Cicero\r\n    de Officiis, 1465, Faust has inserted the following degrading\r\n    words: “Presens opus Joh. Fust Moguntinus civis . . . . arte\r\n    quadam perpulcra Petri manu _pueri mei_ feliciter effeci.” His\r\n    partner, to whose ingenuity he is chiefly indebted for his fame,\r\n    is here represented in the character of a menial. Peter Scheffer,\r\n    of Gernsheim, clerk, who perfected the art of printing, is now\r\n    degraded to “Peter, my _boy_” by whose hand--not by his\r\n    ingenuity--John Faust exercises a certain beautiful art.]\r\n\r\nThe document containing the decision of the judges was drawn up by Ulric\r\nHelmasperger, a notary, on 6th November, 1455, in the presence of Peter\r\nGernsheim [Scheffer], James Faust, the brother of John, Henry Keffer,\r\nand others.[III-29] From the statement of Faust, as recited in this\r\ninstrument, it appears that he had first advanced to Gutemberg eight\r\nhundred florins at the annual interest of six per cent., and afterwards\r\neight hundred florins more. Gutemberg having neglected to pay the\r\ninterest, there was owing by him a sum of two hundred and fifty florins\r\non account of the first eight hundred; and a further sum of one hundred\r\nand forty on account of the second. In consequence of Gutemberg’s\r\nneglecting to pay the interest, Faust states that he had incurred a\r\nfurther expense of thirty-six florins from having to borrow money both\r\nof Christians and Jews. For the capital advanced by him, and arrears of\r\ninterest, he claimed on the whole two thousand and twenty\r\nflorins.[III-30]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-29: Henry Keffer was employed in Gutemberg and\r\n    Faust’s printing-office. He afterwards went to Nuremberg, where\r\n    his name appears as a printer, in 1473, in conjunction with John\r\n    Sensenschmid.--Primaria quædam Documenta de origine Typographiæ,\r\n    edente C. G. Schwartzio. 8vo. Altorfii, 1740.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-30: “Er [Johan Fust] denselben solt fürter under\r\n    Christen und Iudden hab müssen ussnemen, und davor sess und\r\n    dreyssig Gulden ungevärlich zu guter Rechnung zu Gesuch geben, das\r\n    sich also zusamen mit dem Hauptgeld ungevärlich trifft an\r\n    zvvytusend und zvvanzig Gulden.” Schwartz in an observation upon\r\n    this passage conceives the sum of 2,020 florins to be thus made\r\n    up: capital advanced, in two sums of 800 each, 1,600 florins:\r\n    interest 390; on account of compound interest, incurred by Faust,\r\n    36; making in all 2,026. He thinks that 2,020 florins only were\r\n    claimed as a round sum; and that the second sum of 800 florins was\r\n    advanced in October 1452.--Primaria quædam Documenta, pp. 9-14.]\r\n\r\nIn answer to these allegations Gutemberg replied: that the first eight\r\nhundred florins which he received of Faust were advanced in order to\r\npurchase utensils for printing, which were assigned to Faust as a\r\nsecurity for his money. It was agreed between them that Faust should\r\ncontribute three hundred florins annually for workmen’s wages and\r\nhouse-rent, and for the purchase of parchment, paper, ink, and other\r\nthings.[III-31] It was also stipulated that in the event of any\r\ndisagreement arising between them, the printing materials assigned to\r\nFaust as a security should become the property of Gutemberg on his\r\nrepaying the sum of eight hundred florins. This sum, however, which was\r\nadvanced for the completion of the work, Gutemberg did not think himself\r\nbound to expend on book-work alone; and although it was expressed in\r\ntheir agreement that he should pay six florins in the hundred for an\r\nannual interest, yet Faust assured him that he would not accept of it,\r\nas the eight hundred florins were not paid down at once, as by their\r\nagreement they ought to have been. For the second sum of eight hundred\r\nflorins he was ready to render Faust an account. For interest or usury\r\nhe considered that he was not liable.[III-32]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-31: “. . . . und das JOHANNES [FUST] ym ierlichen\r\n    300 Gulden vor Kosten geben, und auch Gesinde Lone, Huss Zinss,\r\n    Vermet, Papier, Tinte, &c. verlegen solte.” Primaria qæedam Doc.\r\n    p. 10.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-32: “. . . . von den ubrigen 800 Gulden vvegen\r\n    begert er ym ein rechnung zu thun, so gestett er auch ym keins\r\n    Soldes noch Wuchers, und hofft ym im rechten darum nit pflichtigk\r\n    sin.” Primaria quædam Doc. p. 11.]\r\n\r\nThe judges, having heard the statements of both parties, decided that\r\nGutemberg should repay Faust so much of the capital as had not been\r\nexpended in the business; and that on Faust’s producing witnesses, or\r\nswearing that he had borrowed upon interest the sums advanced, Gutemberg\r\nshould pay him interest also, according to their agreement. Faust having\r\nmade oath that he had borrowed 1550 florins, which he paid over to\r\nGutemberg, to be employed by him for their common benefit, and that he\r\nhad paid yearly interest, and was still liable on account of the same,\r\nthe notary, Ulric Helmasperger, signed his attestation of the award on\r\n6th November, 1455.[III-33] It would appear that Gutemberg not being\r\nable to repay the money was obliged to relinquish the printing materials\r\nto Faust.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-33: Mercier, who is frequently referred to as an\r\n    authority on subjects connected with Bibliography, has, in his\r\n    supplement to Prosper Marchand’s Histoire de l’Imprimerie,\r\n    confounded this document with that containing an account of the\r\n    process between the Drytzehns and Gutemberg at Strasburg in 1439;\r\n    and Heineken, at p. 255 of his Idée Générale, has committed the\r\n    same mistake.]\r\n\r\nSalmuth, who alludes to the above document in his annotations upon\r\nPancirollus, has most singularly perverted its meaning, by representing\r\nGutemberg as the person who advanced the money, and Faust as the\r\ningenious inventor who was sued by his rich partner. “From this it\r\nevidently appears,” says he, after making Gutemberg and Faust exchange\r\ncharacters, “that Gutemberg was not the first who invented and practised\r\ntypography; but that some years after its invention he was admitted a\r\npartner by John Faust, to whom he advanced money.” If for “Gutemberg” we\r\nread “Faust,” and _vice versâ_, the account is correct.\r\n\r\nWhether Faust, who might be an engraver as well as a goldsmith, assisted\r\nGutemberg or not by engraving the types, does not appear. It is stated\r\nthat Gutemberg’s earliest productions at Mentz were an alphabet cut on\r\nwood, and a Donatus executed in the same manner. Trithemius mentions a\r\n“_Catholicon_” engraved on blocks of wood as one of the first books\r\nprinted by Gutemberg and Faust, and this Heineken thinks was the same as\r\nthe Donatus.[III-34] Whatever may have been the book which Trithemius\r\ndescribes as a “Catholicon,” it certainly was not the “_Catholicon\r\nJoannis Januensis_,” a large folio which appeared in 1460 without the\r\nname or residence of the printer, but which is supposed to have been\r\nprinted by Gutemberg after the dissolution of his partnership with\r\nFaust.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-34: “Je crois, que ces tables [deux planches de bois\r\n    autrefois chez le Duc de la Valliere] sont du livre que le\r\n    Chroniqueur de Cologne appelle un _Donat_ et que _Trithem_ nomme\r\n    un _Catholicon_, (livre universel,) ce qu’on a confondu ensuite\r\n    avec le grand ouvrage intitulé _Catholicon Januensis_.”--Idée\r\n    Générale, p. 258.]\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that previous to the introduction of metal types\r\nGutemberg and Faust used moveable types of wood; and Schœpflin speaks\r\nconfidently of such being used at Strasburg by Mentelin long after\r\nScheffer had introduced the improved method of forming metal types by\r\nmeans of punches and matrices. On this subject, however, Schœpflin’s\r\nopinion is of very little weight, for on whatever relates to the\r\npractice of typography or wood engraving he was very slightly informed.\r\nHe fancies that all the books printed at Strasburg previous to the\r\nappearance of _Vincentii Bellovacensis Speculum Historiale_ in 1473,\r\nwere printed with moveable types of wood. It is, however, doubtful if\r\never a single book was printed in this manner.\r\n\r\nWillett in his Essay on Printing, published in the eleventh volume of\r\nthe Archæologia, not only says that no entire book was ever printed with\r\nwooden types, but adds, “I venture to pronounce it impossible.” He has\r\npronounced rashly. Although it certainly would be a work of considerable\r\nlabour to cut a set of moveable letters of the size of what is called\r\nDonatus type, and sufficient to print such a book, yet it is by no means\r\nimpossible. That such books as “_Eyn Manung der Cristenheit widder die\r\ndurken_,” of which a fac-simile is given by Aretin, and the first and\r\nsecond Donatuses, of which specimens are given by Fischer, might be\r\nprinted from wooden types I am perfectly satisfied, though I am\r\ndecidedly of opinion that they were not. Marchand has doubted the\r\npossibility of printing with wooden types, which he observes would be\r\napt to warp when wet for the purpose of cleaning; but it is to be\r\nobserved that they would not require to be cleaned before they were\r\nused.\r\n\r\nFournier, who was a letter-founder, and who occasionally practised wood\r\nengraving, speaks positively of the Psalter first printed by Faust and\r\nScheffer in 1457, and again in 1459, being printed with wooden types;\r\nand he expresses his conviction of the practicability of cutting and\r\nprinting with such types, provided that they were not of a smaller size\r\nthan Great Primer Roman. Meerman shows the possibility of using such\r\ntypes; and Camus caused two lines of the Bible, supposed to have been\r\nprinted by Gutemberg, to be cut in separate letters on wood, and which\r\nsustained the action of the press.[III-35] Lambinet says, it is certain\r\nthat Gutemberg cut moveable letters of wood, but he gives no authority\r\nfor the assertion; and I am of opinion that no unexceptionable testimony\r\non this point can be produced. The statements of Serarius and Paulus\r\nPater,[III-36] who profess to have seen such ancient wooden types at\r\nMentz, are entitled to as little credit as Daniel Specklin, who asserted\r\nthat he had seen such at Strasburg. They may have seen large initial\r\nletters of wood with holes bored through, but scarcely any lower-case\r\nletters which were ever used in printing any book.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-35: Oberlin, Essai d’Annales de la Vie de\r\n    Gutenberg.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-36: “. . . . ligneos typos, ex buxi frutice,\r\n    perforatos in medio, ut zona colligari una jungique commode\r\n    possint, ex Fausti officina reliquos, Moguntiæ aliquando me\r\n    conspexisse memini.”--Paulus Pater, in Dissertatione de Typis\r\n    Literarum, &c. p, 10. 4to. Lipsiæ, 1710. Heineken, at p. 254 of\r\n    his Idée Gén., declares himself to be convinced that Gutemberg had\r\n    cut separate letters on wood, but he thinks that no person would\r\n    be able to cut a quantity sufficient to print whole sheets, and,\r\n    still less, large volumes as many pretend.]\r\n\r\nThat experiments might be made by Gutemberg with wooden types I can\r\nbelieve, though I have not been able to find any sufficient authority\r\nfor the fact. Of the possibility of cutting moveable types of a certain\r\nsize in wood, and of printing a book with them, I am convinced from\r\nexperiment; and could convince others, were it worth the expense, by\r\nprinting a fac-simile, from wooden types, of any page of any book which\r\nis of an earlier date than 1462. But, though convinced of the\r\npossibility of printing small works in letters of a certain size, with\r\nwooden types, I have never seen any early specimens of typography which\r\ncontained positive and indisputable indications of having been printed\r\nin that manner. It was, until of late, confidently asserted by persons\r\nwho pretended to have a competent knowledge of the subject, that the\r\ntext of the celebrated Adventures of Theurdank, printed in 1517, had\r\nbeen engraved on wood-blocks, and their statement was generally\r\nbelieved. There cannot, however, now be a doubt in the mind of any\r\nperson who examines the book, and who has the slightest knowledge of\r\nwood engraving and printing, of the text being printed with metal types.\r\n\r\nDuring the partnership of Gutemberg and Faust it is likely that they\r\nprinted some works, though there is scarcely one which can be assigned\r\nto them with any degree of certainty. One of the supposed earliest\r\nproductions of typography is a letter of indulgence conceded on the 12th\r\nof August, 1451, by Pope Nicholas V, to Paulin Zappe, counsellor and\r\nambassador of John, King of Cyprus. It was to be in force for three\r\nyears from the 1st of May, 1452, and it granted indulgence to all\r\npersons who within that period should contribute towards the defence of\r\nCyprus against the Turks. Four copies of this indulgence are known,\r\nprinted on vellum in the manner of a patent or brief. The characters are\r\nof a larger size than those of the “Durandi Rationale,” 1459, or of the\r\nLatin Bible printed by Faust and Scheffer in 1462. The following date\r\nappears at the conclusion of one of the copies: “Datum _Erffurdie_ sub\r\nanno Domini m cccc liiij, die vero _quinta decima_ mensis _novembris_.”\r\nThe words which are here printed in Italic, are in the original written\r\nwith a pen. A copy of the same indulgence discovered by Professor\r\nGebhardi is more complete. It has at the end, a “_Forma plenissimæ\r\nabsolutionis et remissionis in vita et in mortis articulo_,”--a form of\r\nplenary absolution and remission in life and at the point of death. At\r\nthe conclusion is the following date, the words in Italics being\r\ninserted with a pen: “Datum in _Luneborch_ anno Domini m cccc l\r\n_quinto_, die vero _vicesima sexta_ mensis _Januarii_.” Heineken, who\r\nsaw this copy in the possession of Breitkopf, has observed that in the\r\noriginal date, m cccc liiij, the last four characters had been effaced\r\nand the word _quinto_ written with a pen; but yet in such a manner that\r\nthe numerals iiij might still be perceived. In two copies of this\r\nindulgence in the possession of Earl Spencer, described by Dr. Dibdin in\r\nthe Bibliotheca Spenceriana, vol. i. p. 44, the final units (iiij) have\r\nnot had the word “quinto” overwritten, but have been formed with a pen\r\ninto the numeral V. In the catalogue of Dr. Kloss’s library, No. 1287,\r\nit is stated that a fragment of a “Donatus” there described, consisting\r\nof two leaves of parchment, is printed with the same type as the\r\nMazarine Bible; and it is added, on the authority of George Appleyard,\r\nEsq., Earl Spencer’s librarian, that the “Littera Indulgentiæ” of Pope\r\nNicholas V, in his lordship’s possession, contains two lines printed\r\nwith the same type. Breitkopf had some doubts respecting this\r\ninstrument; but a writer in the Jena Literary Gazette is certainly wrong\r\nin supposing that it had been ante-dated ten years. It was only to be in\r\nforce for three years; and Pope Nicholas V, by whom it was granted, died\r\non the 24th March, 1455.[III-37] Two words, UNIVERSIS and PAULINUS,\r\nwhich are printed in capitals in the first two lines, are said to be of\r\nthe same type as those of a Bible of which Schelhorn has given a\r\nspecimen in his “Dissertation on an early Edition of the Bible,” Ulm,\r\n1760.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-37: Oberlin, Essai d’Annales de la Vie de\r\n    Gutenberg.]\r\n\r\nThe next earliest specimen of typography with a date is the tract\r\nentitled “_Eyn Manung der Cristenkeit widder die durken_,”--An Appeal to\r\nChristendom against the Turks,--which has been alluded to at page 136.\r\nA lithographic fac-simile of the whole of this tract, which consists of\r\nnine printed pages of a quarto size, is given by Aretin at the end of\r\nhis “Essay on the earliest historical results of the invention of\r\nPrinting,” published at Munich in 1808. This “Appeal” is in German\r\nrhyme, and it consists of exhortations, arranged under every month in\r\nthe manner of a calendar, addressed to the pope, the emperor, to kings,\r\nprinces, bishops, and free states, encouraging them to take up arms and\r\nresist the Turks. The exhortation for January is addressed to Pope\r\nNicholas V, who died, as has been observed, in March 1455. Towards the\r\nconclusion of the prologue is the date “_Als man zelet noch din’ geburt\r\noffenbar m.cccc.lv. iar sieben wochen und iiii do by von nativitatis bis\r\nesto michi_.” At the conclusion of the exhortation for December are the\r\nfollowing words: “Eyn gut selig nuwe Jar:” A happy new year! From these\r\ncircumstances Aretin is of opinion that the tract was printed towards\r\nthe end of 1454. M. Bernhart, however, one of the superintendents of the\r\nRoyal Library at Munich, of which Aretin was the principal director, has\r\nquestioned the accuracy of this date; and from certain allusions in the\r\nexhortation for December, has endeavoured to show that the correct date\r\nought to be 1472.[III-38]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-38: Dr. Dibdin, Bibliog. Tour, vol iii. p. 135,\r\n    second edition.]\r\n\r\nFischer in looking over some old papers discovered a calendar of a folio\r\nsize, and printed on one side only, for 1457. The letters, according to\r\nhis description, resemble those of a Donatus, of which he has given\r\na specimen in the third part of his Typographic Rarities, and he\r\nsupposes that both the Donatus and the Calendar were printed by\r\nGutemberg.[III-39] It is, however, certain that the Donatus which\r\nhe ascribed to Gutemberg was printed by Peter Scheffer, and in all\r\nprobability after Faust’s death; and from the similarity of the type it\r\nis likely that the Calendar was printed at the same office. Fischer,\r\nhaving observed that the large ornamental capitals of this Donatus were\r\nthe same as those in the Psalter printed by Faust and Scheffer in 1457,\r\nwas led most erroneously to conclude that the large ornamental letters\r\nof the Psalter, which were most likely of wood, had been cut by\r\nGutemberg. The discovery of a Donatus with Peter Scheffer’s imprint has\r\ncompletely destroyed his conjectures, and invalidated the arguments\r\nadvanced by him in favour of the Mazarine Bible being printed by\r\nGutemberg alone.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-39: Gotthelf Fischer, Notice du premier livre\r\n    imprimé avec date. 4to. Mayence, An xi. Typographisch. Seltenheit.\r\n    6te. Lieferung, S. 25. 8vo. Nürnberg, 1804. When Fischer published\r\n    his account of the Calendar, Aretin had not discovered the tract\r\n    entitled “_Eyn Manung der Cristenheit widder die durken_.”]\r\n\r\nAs Trithemius and the compiler of the Cologne Chronicle have mentioned a\r\nBible as one of the first books printed by Gutemberg and Faust, it has\r\nbeen a fertile subject of discussion among bibliographers to ascertain\r\nthe identical edition to which the honour was to be awarded. It seems,\r\nhowever, to be now generally admitted that the edition called the\r\nMazarine[III-40] is the best entitled to that distinction. In 1789\r\nMaugerard produced a copy of this edition to the Academy of Metz,\r\ncontaining memoranda which seem clearly to prove that it was printed at\r\nleast as early as August 1456. As the partnership between Gutemberg and\r\nFaust was only dissolved in November 1455, it is almost impossible that\r\nsuch could have been printed by either of them separately in the space\r\nof eight months; and as there seems no reason to believe that any other\r\ntypographical establishment existed at that period, it is most likely\r\nthat this was the identical edition alluded to by Trithemius as having\r\ncost 4,000 florins before the partners, Gutemberg and Faust, had\r\nfinished the third quaternion, or quire of four sheets.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-40: It is called the Mazarine Bible in consequence\r\n    of the first known copy being discovered in the library formed by\r\n    Cardinal Mazarine. Dr. Dibdin, in his Bibliographical Tour, vol.\r\n    ii. p. 191, mentions having seen not fewer than ten or twelve\r\n    copies of this edition, which he says must not be designated as\r\n    “of the very first degree of rarity.” An edition of the Bible,\r\n    supposed to have been printed at Bamberg by Albert Pfister about\r\n    1461, is much more scarce.]\r\n\r\nThe copy produced by Maugerard is printed on paper, and is now in the\r\nRoyal Library at Paris. It is bound in two volumes; and every complete\r\npage consists of two columns, each containing forty-two lines. At the\r\nconclusion of the first volume the person by whom it was\r\nrubricated[III-41] and bound has written the following memorandum: “_Et\r\nsic est finis prime partis biblie. Scr. Veteris testamenti. Illuminata\r\nseu rubricata et illuminata p’ henricum Albeh alius Cremer anno dn’i\r\nm.cccc.lvi festo Bartholomei apli--Deo gratias--alleluja._” At the end\r\nof the second volume the same person has written the date in words at\r\nlength: “_Iste liber illuminatus, ligatus & completus est p’ henricum\r\nCremer vicariū ecclesie collegatur Sancti Stephani maguntini sub anno\r\nD’ni millesimo quadringentesimo quinquagesimo sexto festo assumptionis\r\ngloriose virginis Marie. Deo gracias alleluja._”[III-42] Fischer[III-43]\r\nsays that this last memorandum assigns “einen spätern tag”--a later\r\nday--to the end of the rubricator’s work. In this he is mistaken; for\r\nthe feast of the Assumption of the Virgin, when the _second_ volume was\r\nfinished, is on the 15th of August: while the feast of St. Bartholomew,\r\nthe day on which he finished the _first_, falls on August 24th.\r\nLambinet,[III-44] who doubts the genuineness of those inscriptions,\r\nmakes the circumstance of the second volume being finished nine days\r\nbefore the first, a ground of objection. This seeming inconsistency\r\nhowever can by no means be admitted as a proof of the inscriptions being\r\nspurious. It is indeed more likely that the rubricator might actually\r\nfinish the second volume before the first, than that a modern forger,\r\nintent to deceive, should not have been aware of the objection.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-41: In most of the early printed books the capitals\r\n    were left to be inserted in red ink by the pen or pencil of the\r\n    “rubricator.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-42: There are fac-simile tracings of those\r\n    memorandums, on separate slips of paper, in the copy of the\r\n    Mazarine Bible in the King’s Library at the British Museum; and\r\n    fac-simile engravings of them are given in the M’Carthy\r\n    Catalogue.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-43: Typograph. Seltenheit. S. 20, 3te. Lieferung.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-44: Recherches sur l’Origine de l’Imprimerie,\r\n    p. 135.]\r\n\r\nThe genuineness of the inscriptions is, however, confirmed by other\r\nevidence which no mere conjecture can invalidate. On the last leaf of\r\nthis Bible there is a memorandum written by Berthold de Steyna, vicar of\r\nthe parochial church of “Ville-Ostein,”[III-45] to the sacrist of which\r\nthe Bible belonged. The sum of this memorandum is that on St. George’s\r\nday [23d April] 1457 there was chaunted, for the first time by the said\r\nBerthold, the mass of the holy sacrament. In the Carthusian monastery\r\nwithout the walls of Mentz, Schwartz[III-46] says that he saw a copy of\r\nthis edition, the last leaves of which were torn out; but that in an old\r\ncatalogue he perceived an entry stating that this Bible was presented to\r\nthe monastery by Gutemberg and Faust. If the memorandum in the catalogue\r\ncould be relied on as genuine, it would appear that this Bible had been\r\ncompleted before the dissolution of Gutemberg and Faust’s partnership in\r\nNovember 1455.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-45: Oberlin says that “Ville-Ostein” lies near\r\n    Erfurth, and is in the diocese of Mentz.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-46: Index librorum sub incunabula typograph.\r\n    impressorum. 1739; cited by Fischer, Typograph. Seltenheit. S. 21,\r\n    3te. Lieferung.]\r\n\r\nAlthough not a single work has been discovered with Gutemberg’s imprint,\r\nyet there cannot be a doubt of his having established a press of his\r\nown, and printed books at Mentz after the partnership between him and\r\nFaust had been dissolved. In the chronicle printed by Philip de\r\nLignamine at Rome in 1474, it is expressly stated, under the year 1458,\r\nthat there were then two printers at Mentz skilful in printing on\r\nparchment with metal types. The name of one was _Cutemberg_, and the\r\nother Faust; and it was known that each of them could print three\r\nhundred sheets in a day.[III-47] On St. Margaret’s day, 20th July, 1459,\r\nGutemberg, in conjunction with his brother Friele and his cousins John,\r\nFriele, and Pederman, executed a deed in favour of the convent of St.\r\nClara at Mentz, in which his sister Hebele was a nun. In this document,\r\nwhich is preserved among the archives of the university of Mentz, there\r\noccurs a passage, “which makes it as clear,” says Fischer, who gives the\r\ndeed entire, “as the finest May-day noon, that Gutemberg had not only\r\nprinted books at that time, but that he intended to print more.” The\r\npassage alluded to is to the following effect: “And with respect to the\r\nbooks which I, the above-named John, have given the library of the said\r\nconvent, they shall remain for ever in the said library; and I, the\r\nabove-named John, will furthermore give to the library of the said\r\nconvent all such books required for pious uses and the service of\r\nGod,--whether for reading or singing, or for use according to the rules\r\nof the order,--as I, the above-named John, have printed or shall\r\nhereafter print.”[III-48]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-47: Philippi de Lignamine Chronica Summorum\r\n    Pontificum Imperatorumque, anno 1474, Romæ impressa. A second\r\n    edition of this chronicle was printed at Rome in 1476 by\r\n    “Schurener de Bopardia.” In both editions Gutemberg is called\r\n    “Jacobus,”--James, and is said to be a native of Strasburg. Under\r\n    the same year John Mentelin is mentioned as a printer at\r\n    Strasburg.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-48: Fischer, Typograph. Seltenheit. S. 44, 1ste.\r\n    Lieferung. In this instrument Gutemberg describes himself as\r\n    “Henne Genssfleisch von Sulgeloch, genennt Gudinberg.”]\r\n\r\nThat Gutemberg had a press of his own is further confirmed by a bond or\r\ndeed of obligation executed by Dr. Conrad Homery on the Friday after St.\r\nMatthias’ day, 1468, wherein he acknowledges having received “certain\r\nforms, letters, utensils, materials, and other things belonging to\r\nprinting,” left by John Gutemberg deceased; and he binds himself to the\r\narchbishop Adolphus not to use them beyond the territory of Mentz, and\r\nin the event of his selling them to give a preference to a person\r\nbelonging to that city.\r\n\r\nThe words translated “certain forms, letters, utensils, materials, and\r\nother things belonging to printing,” in the preceding paragraph, are in\r\nthe original enumerated as: “_etliche formen_, _buchstaben_,\r\n_instrument_, _gezuge und anders zu truckwerck gehoerende_.” As there is\r\na distinction made between “formen” and “buchstaben,”--literally,\r\n“forms” and “letters,”--Schwartz is inclined to think that by “formen”\r\nengraved wood-blocks might be meant, and he adduces in favour of his\r\nopinion the word “formen-schneider,” the old German name for a\r\nwood-engraver. One or more pages of type when wedged into a rectangular\r\niron frame called a “chase,” and ready for the press, is termed a “form”\r\nboth by English and German printers; but Schwartz thinks that such were\r\nnot the “forms” mentioned in the document. As there appears to be a\r\ndistinction also between “_instrument_” and “_gezuge_,”--translated\r\nutensils and materials,--he supposes that the latter word may be used to\r\nsignify the metal of which the types were formed. He observes that\r\nGerman printers call their old worn-out types “_der Zeug_”--literally,\r\n“stuff,” and that the mixed metal of which types are composed is also\r\nknown as “der Zeug, oder Metall.”[III-49] It is to be remembered that\r\nthe earliest printers were also their own letter-founders.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-49: Primaria quædam Document. pp. 26-34.]\r\n\r\nThe work called the Catholicon, compiled by Johannes de Balbis,\r\nJanuensis, a Dominican, which appeared in 1460 without the printer’s\r\nname, has been ascribed to Gutemberg’s press by some of the most eminent\r\nGerman bibliographers. It is a Latin dictionary and introduction to\r\ngrammar, and consists of three hundred and seventy-three leaves of large\r\nfolio size. Fischer and others are of opinion that a Vocabulary, printed\r\nat Elfeld,--in Latin, Altavilla,--near Mentz, on 6th November, 1467, was\r\nexecuted with the same types. At the end of this work, which is a quarto\r\nof one hundred and sixty-five leaves, it is stated to have been begun by\r\nHenry Bechtermuntze, and finished by his brother Nicholas, and Wigand\r\nSpyess de Orthenberg.[III-50] A second edition of the same work, printed\r\nby Nicholas Bechtermuntze, appeared in 1469. The following extract from\r\na letter written by Fischer to Professor Zapf in 1803, contains an\r\naccount of his researches respecting the Catholicon and Vocabulary: “The\r\nfrankness with which you retracted your former opinions respecting the\r\nprinter of the Catholicon of 1460, and agreed with me in assigning it to\r\nGutemberg, demands the respect of every unbiassed inquirer. I beg now\r\nmerely to mention to you a discovery that I have made which no longer\r\nleaves it difficult to conceive how the Catholicon types should have\r\ncome into the hands of Bechtermuntze. From a monument which stands\r\nbefore the high altar of the church of Elfeld it is evident that the\r\nfamily of Sorgenloch, of which that of Gutemberg or Gænsfleisch was a\r\nbranch, was connected with the family of Bechtermuntze by marriage. The\r\ntypes used by Bechtermuntze were not only similar to those formerly\r\nbelonging to Gutemberg, but were the very same, as I always maintained,\r\nappealing to the principles of the type-founder’s art. They had come\r\ninto the possession of Bechtermuntze by inheritance, on the death of\r\nGutemberg, and hence Dr. Homery’s reclamation.”[III-51]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-50: “. . . . per henricum bechtermuncze pie memorie\r\n    in altavilla est inchoatum. et demū sub anno dñi M.CCCCLXII. ipō\r\n    die Leonardi confessoris qui fuit quarta die mensis novembris\r\n    p. nycolaum bechtermūcze fratrem dicti Henrici et Wygandū Spyess\r\n    de orthenberg ē consummatū.” There is a copy of this edition in\r\n    the Royal Library at Paris.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-51: Typographisch. Seltenheit.

In\r\nhis account, printed at Nuremberg, 1803, of an early edition of “Joannis\r\nde Turre-cremata explanatio in Psalterium,” he acknowledged that he was\r\nmistaken; thus agreeing with Schwartz, Meerman, Panzer, and Fischer,\r\nthat no book known to be printed by Faust and Scheffer is printed with\r\nthe same types as the Catholicon and the Vocabulary.\r\n\r\nAlthough there can be little doubt of the Catholicon and the Elfeld\r\nVocabulary being printed with the same types, and of the former being\r\nprinted by Gutemberg, yet it is far from certain that Bechtermuntze\r\ninherited Gutemberg’s printing materials, even though he might be a\r\nrelation. It is as likely that Gutemberg might sell to the brothers a\r\nportion of his materials and still retain enough for himself. If they\r\ncame into their possession by inheritance, which is not likely,\r\nGutemberg must have died some months previous to 4th November, 1467, the\r\nday on which Nicholas Bechtermuntze and Wygand Spyess finished the\r\nprinting of the Vocabulary. If the materials had been purchased by\r\nBechtermuntze in Gutemberg’s lifetime, which seems to be the most\r\nreasonable supposition, Conrad Homery could have no claim upon them on\r\naccount of money advanced to Gutemberg, and consequently the types and\r\nprinting materials which after his death came into Homery’s possession,\r\ncould not be those employed by the brothers Bechtermuntze in their\r\nestablishment at Elfeld.[III-52]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-52: The two following works, without date or\r\n    printer’s name, are printed with the same types as the Catholicon,\r\n    and it is doubtful whether they were printed by Gutemberg, or by\r\n    other persons with his types.\r\n    1.

From this\r\nperiod Fischer thinks that Gutemberg no longer occupied himself with\r\nbusiness as a printer, and that he transferred his printing materials to\r\nHenry Bechtermuntze. “If Wimpheling’s account be true,” says Fischer,\r\n“that Gutemberg became blind in his old age, we need no longer be\r\nsurprised that during his lifetime his types and utensils should come\r\ninto the possession of Bechtermuntze.” The exact period of Gutemberg’s\r\ndecease has not been ascertained, but in the bond or deed of obligation\r\nexecuted by Doctor Conrad Homery the Friday after St. Matthias’s\r\nday,[III-53] 1468, he is mentioned as being then dead. He was interred\r\nat Mentz in the church of the Recollets, and the following epitaph was\r\ncomposed by his relation, Adam Gelthaus:[III-54]\r\n\r\n  “D. O. M. S.\r\n\r\n“Joanni Genszfleisch, artis impressoriæ repertori, de omni natione et\r\nlingua optime merito, in nominis sui memoriam immortalem Adam Gelthaus\r\nposuit. Ossa ejus in ecclesia D. Francisci Moguntina feliciter cubant.”\r\n\r\nFrom the last sentence it is probable that this epitaph was not placed\r\nin the church wherein Gutemberg was interred. The following inscription\r\nwas composed by Ivo Wittich, professor of law and member of the imperial\r\nchamber at Mentz:\r\n\r\n“Jo. Guttenbergensi, Moguntino, qui primus omnium literas ære\r\nimprimendas invenit, hac arte de orbe toto bene merenti Ivo Witigisis\r\nhoc saxum pro monimento posuit M.D.VII.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-53: St. Matthias’s Day is on 24th February.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-54: In the instrument dated 1434, wherein Gutemberg\r\n    agrees to release the town-clerk of Mentz, whom he had arrested,\r\n    mention is made of a relation of his, Ort Gelthus, living at\r\n    Oppenheim. Schœpflin, mistaking the word, has printed in his\r\n    Documenta, p. 4, “Artgeld huss,” which he translates “Artgeld\r\n    domo,” the house of Artgeld.]\r\n\r\nThis inscription, according to Serarius, who professes to have seen it,\r\nand who died in 1609, was placed in front of the school of law at Mentz.\r\nThis house had formerly belonged to Gutemberg, and was supposed to be\r\nthe same in which he first commenced printing at Mentz in conjunction\r\nwith Faust.[III-55]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-55: Serarii Historia Mogunt. lib. 1. cap. xxxvii.\r\n    p. 159. Heineken, Nachrichten von Kunstlern und Kunst-Sachen, 2te.\r\n    Theil, S. 299.]\r\n\r\nFrom the documentary evidence cited in the preceding account of the life\r\nof Gutemberg, it will be perceived that the art of printing with\r\nmoveable types was not perfected as soon as conceived, but that it was a\r\nwork of time. It is highly probable that Gutemberg was occupied with his\r\ninvention in 1436; and from the obscure manner in which his “admirable\r\ndiscovery” is alluded to in the process between him and the Drytzehns in\r\n1439, it does not seem likely that he had then proceeded beyond making\r\nexperiments. In 1449 or 1450, when the sum of 800 florins was advanced\r\nby Faust, it appears not unreasonable to suppose that he had so far\r\nimproved his invention, as to render it practically available without\r\nreference to Scheffer’s great improvement in casting the types from\r\nmatrices formed by punches, which was most likely discovered between\r\n1452 and 1455.[III-56] About fourteen years must have elapsed before\r\nGutemberg was enabled to bring his invention into practice. The\r\ndifficulties which must have attended the first establishment of\r\ntypography could only have been surmounted by great ingenuity and\r\nmechanical knowledge combined with unwearied perseverance. After the\r\nmind had conceived the idea of using moveable types, those types,\r\nwhatever might be the material employed, were yet to be formed, and when\r\ncompleted they were to be arranged in pages, divided by proper spaces,\r\nand bound together in some manner which the ingenuity of the inventor\r\nwas to devise. Nor was his invention complete until he had contrived a\r\nPRESS, by means of which numerous impressions from his types might be\r\nperfectly and rapidly obtained.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-56: In the colophon to “Trithemii Breviarium\r\n    historiarum de origine Regum et Gentis Francorum,” printed at\r\n    Mentz in 1515 by John Scheffer, son of Peter Scheffer and\r\n    Christina, the daughter of Faust, it is stated that the art of\r\n    printing was perfected in 1452, through the labour and ingenious\r\n    contrivances of Peter Scheffer of Gernsheim, and that Faust gave\r\n    him his daughter Christina in marriage as a reward.]\r\n\r\nMr. Ottley, at page 285 of the first volume of his Researches, informs\r\nus that “almost all great discoveries have been made by accident;” and\r\nat page 196 of the same volume, when speaking of printing as the\r\ninvention of Lawrence Coster, he mentions it as an “art which had been\r\nat first taken up as the amusement of a leisure hour, became improved,\r\nand was practised by him as a profitable trade.” Let any unbiassed\r\nperson enter a printing-office; let him look at the single letters, let\r\nhim observe them formed into pages, and the pages wedged up in forms;\r\nlet him see a sheet printed from one of those forms by means of the\r\npress; and when he has seen and considered all this, let him ask himself\r\nif ever, since the world began, the amusement of an old man practised in\r\nhis hours of leisure was attended with such a result? “Very few great\r\ndiscoveries,” says Lord Brougham, “have been made by chance and by\r\nignorant persons, much fewer than is generally supposed.--They are\r\ngenerally made by persons of competent knowledge, and who are in search\r\nof them.”[III-57]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-57: On the Pleasures and Advantages of Science,\r\n    p. 160. Edit. 1831.]\r\n\r\nHaving now given some account of the grounds on which Gutemberg’s claims\r\nto the invention of typography are founded, it appears necessary to give\r\na brief summary, from the earliest authorities, of the pretensions of\r\nLawrence Coster not only to the same honour, but to something more; for\r\nif the earliest account which we have of him be true, he was not only\r\nthe inventor of typography, but of block-printing also.\r\n\r\nThe first mention of Holland in connexion with the invention of\r\ntypography occurs in the Cologne Chronicle, printed by John Kœlhoff in\r\n1499, wherein it is said that the first idea of the art was suggested by\r\nthe Donatuses printed in Holland; it being however expressly stated in\r\nthe same work that the art of printing as then practised was invented at\r\nMentz. In a memorandum, which has been referred to at page 123, written\r\nby Mariangelus Accursius, who flourished about 1530, the invention of\r\nprinting with metal types is erroneously ascribed to Faust; and it is\r\nfurther added, that he derived the idea from a Donatus printed in\r\nHolland from a wood-block. That a Donatus might be printed there from a\r\nwood-block previous to the invention of typography is neither impossible\r\nnor improbable; although I esteem the testimony of Accursius of very\r\nlittle value. He was born and resided in Italy, and it is not unlikely,\r\nas has been previously observed, that he might derive his information\r\nfrom the Cologne Chronicle.\r\n\r\nJohn Van Zuyren, who died in 1594, is said to have written a book to\r\nprove that typography was invented at Harlem; but it never was printed,\r\nand the knowledge that we have of it is from certain fragments of it\r\npreserved by Scriverius, a writer whose own uncorroborated testimony on\r\nthis subject is not entitled to the slightest credit. The substance of\r\nZuyren’s account is almost the same as that of Junius, except that he\r\ndoes not mention the inventor’s name. The art according to him was\r\ninvented at Harlem, but that while yet in a rude and imperfect state it\r\nwas carried by a stranger to Mentz, and there brought to perfection.\r\n\r\nTheodore Coornhert, in the dedication of his Dutch translation of\r\nTully’s Offices to the magistrates of Harlem, printed in 1561, says that\r\nhe had frequently heard from respectable people that the art of printing\r\nwas invented at Harlem, and that the house where the inventor lived was\r\npointed out to him. He proceeds to relate that by the dishonesty of a\r\nworkman the art was carried to Mentz and there perfected. Though he says\r\nthat he was informed by certain respectable old men both of the\r\ninventor’s name and family, yet, for some reason or other, he is careful\r\nnot to mention them. When he was informing the magistrates of Harlem of\r\ntheir city being the nurse of so famous a discovery, it is rather\r\nstrange that he should not mention the parent’s name. From the\r\nconclusion of his dedication we may guess why he should be led to\r\nmention Harlem as the place where typography was invented. It appears\r\nthat he and certain friends of his, being inflamed with a patriotic\r\nspirit, designed to establish a new printing-office at Harlem, “in\r\nhonour of their native city, to the profit of others, and for their own\r\naccommodation, and yet without detriment to any person.” His claiming\r\nthe invention of printing for Harlem was a good advertisement for the\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nThe next writer who mentions Harlem as the place where printing was\r\ninvented is Guicciardini, who in his Description of the Low Countries,\r\nfirst printed at Antwerp in 1567, gives the report, without vouching for\r\nits truth, as follows: “In this place, it appears, not only from the\r\ngeneral opinion of the inhabitants and other Hollanders, but from the\r\ntestimony of several writers and from other memoirs, that the art of\r\nprinting and impressing letters on paper such as is now practised, was\r\ninvented. The inventor dying before the art was perfected or had come\r\ninto repute, his servant, as they say, went to live at Mentz, where\r\nmaking this new art known, he was joyfully received; and applying\r\nhimself diligently to so important a business, he brought it to\r\nperfection and into general repute. Hence the report has spread abroad\r\nand gained credit that the art of printing was first practised at Mentz.\r\nWhat truth there may be in this relation, I am not able, nor do I wish,\r\nto decide; contenting myself with mentioning the subject in a few words,\r\nthat I might not prejudice [by my silence the claims of] this\r\ndistrict.”[III-58]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-58: Ludovico Guicciardini, Descrittione di tutti i\r\n    Paesi Bassi: folio, Anversa, 1581. The original passage is given\r\n    by Meerman. The original words _altre memorie_--translated in the\r\n    above extract “other memoirs”--are rendered by Mr. Ottley “other\r\n    records.” This may pass; but it scarcely can be believed that\r\n    Guicciardini consulted or personally knew of the existence of any\r\n    such records. Mr. Ottley also, to match his “records,” refers to\r\n    the relations of Coornhert, Zuyren, Guicciardini, and Junius as\r\n    “documents.”]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the above account is given from mere report. What\r\nother writers had previously noticed the claims of Harlem, except\r\nCoornhert and Zuyren, remain yet to be discovered. They appear to have\r\nbeen unknown to Guicciardini’s contemporary, Junius, who was the first\r\nto give a name to the Harlem inventor; a “local habitation” had already\r\nbeen provided for him by Coornhert.\r\n\r\nThe sole authority for one Lawrence Coster having invented\r\nwood-engraving, block-printing, and typography, is Hadrian Junius, who\r\nwas born at Horn in North Holland, in 1511. He took up his abode at\r\nHarlem in 1560. During his residence in that city he commenced his\r\nBatavia,--the work in which the account of Coster first\r\nappeared,--which, from the preface, would seem to have been finished in\r\nJanuary, 1575. He died the 16th June in the same year, and his book was\r\nnot published until 1588, twelve years after his decease.[III-59] In\r\nthis work, which is a topographical and historical account of Holland,\r\nor more properly of the country included within the limits of ancient\r\nBatavia, we find the first account of Lawrence Coster as the inventor of\r\ntypography. Almost every succeeding advocate of Coster’s pretensions has\r\ntaken the liberty of altering, amplifying, or contradicting the account\r\nof Junius according as it might suit his own line of argument; but not\r\none of them has been able to produce a single solitary fact in\r\nconfirmation of it. Scriverius, Seiz, Meerman, and Koning are fertile in\r\ntheir conjectures about the thief that stole Coster’s types, but they\r\nare miserably barren in their proofs of his having had types to be\r\nstolen. “If the variety of opinions,” observes Naude, speaking of\r\nCoster’s invention, “may be taken as an indication of the falsehood of\r\nany theory, it is impossible that this should be true”. Since Naude’s\r\ntime the number of Coster’s advocates has been increased by Seiz,\r\nMeerman, and Koning;[III-60] who, if they have not been able to produce\r\nany evidence of the existence of Lawrence Coster as a printer, have at\r\nleast been fertile in conjectures respecting the thief. They have not\r\nstrengthened but weakened the Costerian triumphal arch raised by Junius,\r\nfor they have all more or less knocked a piece of it away; and even\r\nwhere they have pretended to make repairs, it has merely been “one nail\r\ndriving another out.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-59: Junius was a physician, and unquestionably a\r\n    learned man. He is the author of a nomenclator in Latin, Greek,\r\n    Dutch, and French. An edition, with the English synonyms, by John\r\n    Higins and Abraham Fleming, was printed at London in 1585. The\r\n    following passage concerning Junius occurs in Southey’s\r\n    Biographical Sketch of the Earl of Surrey in the “Select Works of\r\n    the British Poets from Chaucer to Jonson:” “Surrey is next found\r\n    distinguishing himself at the siege of Landrecy. At that siege\r\n    Bonner, who was afterwards so eminently infamous, invited Hadrian\r\n    Junius to England. When that distinguished scholar arrived, Bonner\r\n    wanted either the means, or more probably the heart, to assist\r\n    him; but Surrey took him into his family in the capacity of\r\n    physician, and gave him a pension of fifty angels.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-60: Koning’s Dissertation on the Invention of\r\n    Printing, which was crowned by the Society of Sciences of Harlem,\r\n    was first printed at Harlem in the Dutch language in 1816. It was\r\n    afterwards abridged and translated into French with the\r\n    approbation, and under the revision, of the author. In 1817 he\r\n    published a first supplement; and a second appeared in 1820.]\r\n\r\nJunius’s account of Coster is supposed to have been written about 1568;\r\nand in order to do justice to the claims of Harlem I shall here give a\r\nfaithful translation of the “document,”--according to Mr. Ottley,--upon\r\nwhich they are founded. After alluding, in a preliminary rhetorical\r\nflourish, to Truth being the daughter of Time, and to her being\r\nconcealed in a well, Junius thus proceeds to draw her out.\r\n\r\n“If he is the best witness, as Plutarch says, who, bound by no favour\r\nand led by no partiality, freely and fearlessly speaks what he thinks,\r\nmy testimony may deservedly claim attention. I have no connexion through\r\nkindred with the deceased, his heirs, or his posterity, and I expect on\r\nthis account neither favour nor reward. What I have done is performed\r\nthrough a regard to the memory of the dead. I shall therefore relate\r\nwhat I have heard from old and respectable persons who have held offices\r\nin the city, and who seriously affirmed that they had heard what they\r\ntold from their elders, whose authority ought justly to entitle them to\r\ncredit.”\r\n\r\nAbout a hundred and twenty-eight years ago,[III-61] Lawrence John,\r\ncalled the churchwarden or keeper,[III-62] from the profitable and\r\nhonourable office which his family held by hereditary right, dwelt in a\r\nlarge house, which is yet standing entire, opposite the Royal Palace.\r\nThis is the person who now on the most sacred ground of right puts forth\r\nhis claims to the honour of having invented typography, an honour so\r\nnefariously obtained and possessed by others. Walking in a neighbouring\r\nwood, as citizens are accustomed to do after dinner and on holidays, he\r\nbegan to cut letters of beech-bark, with which for amusement, the\r\nletters being inverted as on a seal, he impressed short sentences on\r\npaper for the children of his son-in-law. Having succeeded so well in\r\nthis, he began to think of more important undertakings, for he was a\r\nshrewd and ingenious man; and, in conjunction with his son-in-law Thomas\r\nPeter, he discovered a more glutinous and tenacious kind of ink, as he\r\nfound from experience that the ink in common use occasioned blots. This\r\nThomas Peter left four sons, all of whom were magistrates; and I mention\r\nthis that all may know that the art derived its origin from a\r\nrespectable and not from a mean family. He then printed whole figured\r\npages with the text added. Of this kind I have seen specimens executed\r\nin the infancy of the art, being printed only on one side. This was a\r\nbook composed in our native language by an anonymous author, and\r\nentitled _Speculum Nostræ Salutis_. In this we may observe that in the\r\nfirst productions of the art--for no invention is immediately\r\nperfected--the blank pages were pasted together, so that they might not\r\nappear as a defect. He afterwards exchanged his beech types for leaden\r\nones, and subsequently he formed his types of tin, as being less\r\nflexible and of greater durability. Of the remains of these types\r\ncertain old wine-vessels were cast, which are still preserved in the\r\nhouse formerly the residence of Lawrence, which, as I have said, looks\r\ninto the market-place, and which was afterwards inhabited by his\r\ngreat-grandson Gerard Thomas, a citizen of repute, who died an old man a\r\nfew years ago.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-61: Reckoning from 1568, the period referred to\r\n    would be 1440.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-62: “Ædituus Custosve.” The word “Koster” in modern\r\n    Dutch is synonymous with the English “Sexton.”]\r\n\r\n“The new invention being well received, and a new and unheard-of\r\ncommodity finding on all sides purchasers, to the great profit of the\r\ninventor, he became more devoted to the art, his business was increased,\r\nand new workmen--the first cause of his misfortune--were employed. Among\r\nthem was one called John; but whether, as is suspected, he bore the\r\nominous surname of Faust,--_infaustus_[III-63] and unfaithful to his\r\nmaster--or whether it were some other John, I shall not labour to prove,\r\nas I do not wish to disturb the dead already enduring the pangs of\r\nconscience for what they had done when living.[III-64] This person, who\r\nwas admitted under an oath to assist in printing, as soon as he thought\r\nhe had attained the art of joining the letters, a knowledge of the\r\nfusile types, and other matters connected with the business, embracing\r\nthe convenient opportunity of Christmas Eve, when all persons are\r\naccustomed to attend to their devotions, stole all the types and\r\nconveyed away all the utensils which his master had contrived by his own\r\nskill; and then leaving home with the thief, first went to Amsterdam,\r\nthen to Cologne, and lastly to Mentz, as his altar of refuge, where\r\nbeing safely settled, beyond bowshot as they say, he might commence\r\nbusiness, and thence derive a rich profit from the things which he had\r\nstolen. Within the space of a year from Christmas, 1442, it is certain\r\nthat there appeared printed with the types which Lawrence had used at\r\nHarlem ‘_Alexandri Galli Doctrinale_,’ a grammar then in frequent use,\r\nwith ‘_Petri Hispani Tractatus_.’\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-63: “Sive is (ut fert suspicio) Faustus fuerit\r\n    ominoso cognomine, hero suo infidus et infaustus.” The author here\r\n    indulges in an ominous pun. The Latinised name “_Faustus_,”\r\n    signifies lucky; the word “_infaustus_,” unlucky. The German name\r\n    Füst may be literally translated “Fist.” A clenched hand is the\r\n    crest of the family of Faust.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-64: This is an admirable instance of candour.\r\n    A charge is insinuated, and presumed to be a fact, and yet the\r\n    writer kindly forbears to bring forward proof, that he may not\r\n    disturb the dead. History has long since given the lie to the\r\n    insinuation of the thief having been Faust.]\r\n\r\n“The above is nearly what I have heard from old men worthy of credit who\r\nhad received the tradition as a shining torch transferred from hand to\r\nhand, and I have heard the same related and affirmed by others.\r\nI remember being told by Nicholas Galius, the instructor of my youth,--a\r\nman of iron memory, and venerable from his long white hair,--that when a\r\nboy he had often heard one Cornelius, a bookbinder, not less than eighty\r\nyears old (who had been an assistant in the same office), relate with\r\nsuch excited feelings the whole transaction,--the occasion of the\r\ninvention, its progress, and perfection, as he had heard of them from\r\nhis master,--that as often as he came to the story of the robbery he\r\nwould burst into tears; and then the old man’s anger would be so roused\r\non account of the honour that had been lost through the theft, that he\r\nappeared as if he could have hanged the thief had he been alive; and\r\nthen again he would vow perdition on his sacrilegious head, and curse\r\nthe nights that he had slept in the same bed with him, for the old man\r\nhad been his bedfellow for some months. This does not differ from the\r\nwords of Quirinus Talesius, who admitted to me that he had formerly\r\nreceived nearly the same account from the mouth of the same\r\nbookseller.”[III-65]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-65: Hadriani Junii Batavia, p. 253, et sequent.\r\n    Edit. Ludg. Batavor. 1588.]\r\n\r\nAs Junius died upwards of twelve years before his book was published, it\r\nis doubtful whether the above account was actually written by him or\r\nnot. It may have been an interpolation of an editor or a bookseller\r\nanxious for the honour of Harlem, and who might thus expect to gain\r\ncurrency for the story by giving it to the world under the sanction of\r\nJunius’s name. There was also another advantage attending this mode of\r\npublication; for as the reputed writer was dead, he could not be called\r\non to answer the many objections which remain yet unexplained.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which Coster, according to the preceding account, first\r\ndiscovered the principle of obtaining impressions from separate letters\r\nformed of the bark of the beech-tree requires no remark.[III-66] There\r\nare, however, other parts of this narrative which more especially force\r\nthemselves on the attention as being at variance with reason as well as\r\nfact.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-66: Scriverius--whose book was printed in\r\n    1628--thinking that there might be some objection raised to the\r\n    letters of beech-bark, thus, according to his own fancy, amends\r\n    the account of Cornelius as given by Junius: “Coster walking in\r\n    the wood picked up a small bough of a beech, or rather of an\r\n    oak-tree blown off by the wind; and after amusing himself with\r\n    cutting some letters on it, wrapped it up in paper, and afterwards\r\n    laid himself down to sleep. When he awoke, he perceived that the\r\n    paper, by a shower of rain or some accident having got moist, had\r\n    received an impression from these letters; which induced him to\r\n    pursue the accidental discovery.” This is more imaginative than\r\n    the account of Cornelius, but scarcely more probable.]\r\n\r\nCoster, we are informed, lived in a large house, and, at the time of his\r\nengaging the workman who robbed him, he had brought the art to such\r\nperfection that he derived from it a great profit; and in consequence of\r\nthe demand for the new commodity, which was eagerly sought after by\r\npurchasers, he was obliged to increase his establishment and engage\r\nassistants. It is therefore evident that the existence of such an art\r\nmust have been well known, although its details might be kept secret.\r\nCoster, we are also informed, was of a respectable family; his\r\ngrand-children were men of authority in the city, and a great-grandson\r\nof his died only a few years before Junius wrote, and yet not one of his\r\nfriends or descendants made any complaint of the loss which Coster had\r\nsustained both in property and fame. Their apathy, however, was\r\ncompensated by the ardour of old Cornelius, who used to shed involuntary\r\ntears whenever the theft was mentioned; and used to heap bitter curses\r\non the head of the thief as often as he thought of the glory of which\r\nCoster and Harlem had been so villanously deprived. It is certainly very\r\nsingular that a person of respectability and authority should be robbed\r\nof his materials and deprived of the honour of the invention, and yet\r\nneither himself nor any one of his kindred publicly denounce the thief;\r\nmore especially as the place where he had established himself was known,\r\nand where in conjunction with others he had the frontless audacity to\r\nclaim the honour of the invention.\r\n\r\nOf Lawrence Coster, his invention, and his loss, the world knew nothing\r\nuntil he had been nearly a hundred and fifty years in his grave. The\r\npresumed writer of the account which had to do justice to his memory had\r\nbeen also twelve years dead when his book was published. His\r\ninformation, which he received when he was a boy, was derived from an\r\nold man who when a boy had heard it from another old man who lived with\r\nCoster at the time of the robbery, and who had heard the account of the\r\ninvention from his master. Such is the list of the Harlem witnesses. If\r\nJunius had produced any evidence on the authority of Coster’s\r\ngreat-grandson that any of his predecessors--his father or his\r\ngrandfather--had carried on the business of a printer at Harlem, this\r\nmight in part have corroborated the narrative of Cornelius; but, though\r\nsubsequent advocates of the claims of Harlem have asserted that Coster’s\r\ngrand-children continued the printing business, no book or document has\r\nbeen discovered to establish the fact.\r\n\r\nThe account of Cornelius involves a contradiction which cannot be easily\r\nexplained away. If the thief stole the whole or greater part of Coster’s\r\nprinting materials,--types and press and all, as the narrative seems to\r\nimply,--it is difficult to conceive how he could do so without being\r\ndiscovered, even though the time chosen were Christmas Eve; for on an\r\noccasion when all or most people were engaged at their devotions, the\r\nfact of two persons being employed would in itself be a suspicious\r\ncircumstance: a tenant with a small stock of furniture who wished to\r\nmake a “moonlight flitting” would most likely be stopped if he attempted\r\nto remove his goods on a Sunday night. As the dishonest workman had an\r\nassistant, who is rather unaccountably called “_the_ thief,” it is\r\nevident from this circumstance, as well as from the express words of the\r\nnarrative,[III-67] that the quantity of materials stolen must have been\r\nconsiderable. If, on the contrary, the thief only carried away a portion\r\nof the types and matrices, with a few other instruments,--“all that\r\ncould be moved without manifest danger of immediate detection,” to use\r\nthe words of Mr. Ottley,--what was there to prevent Coster from\r\ncontinuing the business of printing? Did he give up the lucrative trade\r\nwhich he had established, and disappoint his numerous customers, because\r\na dishonest workman had stolen a few of his types? But even if every\r\nletter and matrice had been stolen,--though how likely this is to be\r\ntrue I shall leave every one conversant with typography to decide,--was\r\nthe loss irreparable, and could this “shrewd and ingenious man” not\r\nreconstruct the types and other printing materials which he had\r\noriginally contrived?\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-67: “Choragium omne typorum involat, instrumentorum\r\n    herilium ei artificio comparatorum suppelectilem convasat, deinde\r\n    _cum fure_ domo se proripit.”--H. Junii Batavia, p. 255.]\r\n\r\nIf the business of Coster was continued uninterruptedly, and after his\r\ndeath carried on by his grand-children, we might naturally expect that\r\nsome of the works which they printed could be produced, and that some\r\nrecord of their having practised such an art at Harlem would be in\r\nexistence. The records of Harlem are however silent on the subject; no\r\nmention is made by any contemporary author, nor in any contemporary\r\ndocument, of Coster or his descendants as printers in that city; and no\r\nbook printed by them has been discovered except by persons who decide\r\nupon the subject as if they were endowed with the faculty of intuitive\r\ndiscrimination. If Coster’s business had been suspended in consequence\r\nof the robbery, his customers, from all parts, who eagerly purchased the\r\n“new commodity,” must have been aware of the circumstance; and to\r\nsuppose that it should not have been mentioned by some old writer, and\r\nthat the claims of Coster should have lain dormant for a century and a\r\nhalf, exceeds my powers of belief. Where pretended truth can only be\r\nperceived by closing the eyes of reason I am content to remain ignorant;\r\nnor do I wish to trust myself to the unsafe bridge of conjecture--a\r\nrotten plank without a hand-rail,--\r\n\r\n  “O’er which lame faith leads understanding blind.”\r\n\r\nIf all Coster’s types had been stolen and he had not supplied himself\r\nwith new ones, it would be difficult to account for the wine vessels\r\nwhich were cast from the old types; and if he or his heirs continued to\r\nprint subsequent to the robbery, all that his advocates had to complain\r\nof was the theft. For since it must have been well known that he had\r\ndiscovered and practised the art, at least ten years previous to its\r\nknown establishment at Mentz, and seventeen years before a book appeared\r\nwith the name of the printers claiming the honour of the invention, the\r\ngreatest injury which he received must have been from his fellow\r\ncitizens; who perversely and wilfully would not recollect his previous\r\ndiscovery and do justice to his claims. Even supposing that a thief had\r\nstolen the whole of Coster’s printing-materials, types, chases, and\r\npresses, it by no means follows that he deprived of their memory not\r\nonly all the citizens of Harlem, but all Coster’s customers who came\r\nfrom other places[III-68] to purchase the “new commodity” which his\r\npress supplied. Such however must have been the consequences of the\r\nrobbery, if the narrative of Cornelius were true; for except himself no\r\nperson seems to have remembered Coster’s invention, or that either he or\r\nhis immediate descendants had ever printed a single book.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-68: “. . . . . quum nova merx, nunquam antea visa,\r\n    emptores undique exciret cum huberrimo questu.”--Junii Batavia.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the internal evidence of the improbability of\r\nCornelius’s account of Coster and his invention, its claims to\r\ncredibility are still further weakened by those persons who have shown\r\nthemselves most wishful to establish its truth. Lawrence Janszoon, whom\r\nMeerman and others suppose to have been the person described by\r\nCornelius as the inventor of printing, appears to have been custos of\r\nthe church of St. Bavon at Harlem in the years 1423, 1426, 1432 and\r\n1433. His death is placed by Meerman in 1440; and as, according to the\r\nnarrative of Cornelius, the types and other printing materials were\r\nstolen on Christmas eve 1441, the inventor of typography must have been\r\nin his grave at the time the robbery was committed. Cornelius must have\r\nknown of his master’s death, and yet in his account of the robbery he\r\nmakes no mention of Coster being dead at the time, nor of the business\r\nbeing carried on by his descendants after his decease. It was at one\r\ntime supposed that Coster died of grief on the loss of his types, and on\r\naccount of the thief claiming the honour of the invention. But this it\r\nseems is a mistake; he was dead according to Meerman at the time of the\r\nrobbery, and the business was carried on by his grandchildren.\r\n\r\nKoning has discovered that Cornelius the bookbinder died in 1522, aged\r\nat least ninety years. Allowing him to have been ninety-two, this\r\nassistant in Coster’s printing establishment, and who learnt the account\r\nof the invention and improvement of the art from Coster himself, must\r\nhave been just ten years old when his master died; and yet upon the\r\nimprobable and uncorroborated testimony of this person are the claims of\r\nCoster founded.\r\n\r\nLehne, in his “Chronology of the Harlem fiction,”[III-69] thus remarks\r\non the authorities, Galius, and Talesius, referred to by Junius as\r\nevidences of its truth. As Cornelius was upwards of eighty when he\r\nrelated the story to Nicholas Galius, who was then a boy, this must have\r\nhappened about 1510. The boy Galius we will suppose to have been at that\r\ntime about fifteen years old: Junius was born in 1511, and we will\r\nsuppose that he was under the care of Nicholas Galius, the instructor of\r\nhis youth, until he was fifteen; that is, until 1526. In this year\r\nGalius, the man venerable from his grey hairs, would be only thirty-six\r\nyears old, an age at which grey hairs are premature. Grey hairs are only\r\nvenerable in old age, and it is not usual to praise a young man’s\r\nfaculty of recollection in the style in which Junius lauds the “iron\r\nmemory” of his teacher. Talesius, as Koning states, was born in 1505,\r\nand consequently six years older than Junius; and on the death of\r\nCornelius, in 1522, he would be seventeen, and Junius eleven years old.\r\nJunius might in his eleventh year have heard the whole account from\r\nCornelius himself in the same manner as the latter when only ten must\r\nhave heard it from Coster; and it is remarkable that Galius who was so\r\nwell acquainted with Cornelius did not afford his pupil the opportunity.\r\nWe thus perceive that in the whole of this affair children and old men\r\nplay the principal parts, and both ages are proverbially addicted to\r\nnarratives which savour of the marvellous.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-69: In “Einige Bemerkungen über das Unternehmen der\r\n    gelehrten Gesellschaft zu Harlem,” &c. S. 31.]\r\n\r\nMeerman, writing to his correspondent Wagenaar in 1757, expresses his\r\nutter disbelief in the story of Coster being the inventor of typography,\r\nwhich, he observes, was daily losing credit: whatever historical\r\nevidence Seiz had brought forward in favour of Coster was gratuitously\r\nassumed; in short, the whole story of the invention was a\r\nfiction.[III-70] After the publication of Schœpflin’s Vindiciæ\r\nTypographicæ in 1760, giving proofs of Gutemberg having been engaged in\r\n1438 with some invention relating to _printing_, and in which a _press_\r\nwas employed, Meerman appears to have received a new light; for in 1765\r\nhe published his own work in support of the very story which he had\r\npreviously declared to be undeserving of credit. The mere change,\r\nhowever, of a writer’s opinions cannot alter the immutable character of\r\ntruth; and the guesses and assumptions with which he may endeavour to\r\ngloss a fiction can never give to it the solidity of fact. What he has\r\nsaid of the work of Seiz in support of Coster’s claims may with equal\r\ntruth be applied to his own arguments in the same cause: “Whatever\r\nhistorical evidence he has brought forward in favour of Coster has been\r\ngratuitously assumed.” Meerman’s work, like the story which it was\r\nwritten to support, “is daily losing credit.” It is a dangerous book for\r\nan advocate of Coster to quote; for he has scarcely advanced an argument\r\nin favour of Coster, and in proof of his stolen types being the\r\nfoundation of typography at Mentz, but what is contradicted by a\r\npositive fact.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-70: Santander has published a French translation of\r\n    this letter in his Dictionnaire Bibliographique, tom. i. pp.\r\n    14-18.]\r\n\r\nIn order to make the documentary evidence produced by Schœpflin in\r\nfavour of Gutemberg in some degree correspond with the story of\r\nCornelius, Junius’s authority, he has assumed that Gutemberg had an\r\nelder brother also called John; and that he was known as Gænsfleisch\r\nthe elder, while his younger brother was called by way of\r\ndistinction Gutemberg. In support of this assumption he refers\r\nto Wimpheling,[III-71] who in one place has called the inventor\r\nGænsfleisch, and in another Gutemberg; and he also supposes that the two\r\nepitaphs which have been given at page 144, relate to two different\r\npersons. The first, inscribed by Adam Gelthaus to the memory of John\r\n_Gænsfleisch_, he concludes to have been intended for the elder brother.\r\nThe second, inscribed by Ivo Wittich to the memory of John _Gutemberg_,\r\nhe supposes to relate to the younger brother, and to have been erected\r\nfrom a feeling of envy. The fact of Gutemberg being also named\r\nGænsfleisch in several contemporary documents, is not allowed to stand\r\nin the way of Meerman’s hypothesis of the two “brother Johns,” which has\r\nbeen supposed to be corroborated by the fact of a John Gænsfleisch the\r\nElder being actually the contemporary of John Gænsfleisch called also\r\nGutemberg.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-71: Wimpheling, who was born at Sletstadt in 1451,\r\n    thus addresses the inventor of printing,--whose name, Gænsfleisch,\r\n    he Latinises “Ansicarus,”--in an epigram printed at the end of\r\n    “Memoriæ Marsilii ab Inghen,” 4to. 1499.\r\n\r\n      “Felix _Ansicare_, per te Germania felix\r\n        Omnibus in terris præmia laudis habet.\r\n      Urbe Moguntina, divino fulte Joannes\r\n        Ingenio, primus imprimis ære notas.\r\n      Multum Relligio, multum tibi Græca sophia,\r\n        Et multum debet lingua Latina.”\r\n\r\n    In his “Epitome Rerum Germanicarum,” 1502, he says that the art of\r\n    printing was discovered at Strasburg in 1440 by a native of that\r\n    city, who afterwards removing to Mentz there perfected the art. In\r\n    his “Episcoporum Argentinensium Catalogus,” 1508, he says that\r\n    printing was invented by a native of Strasburg, and that when the\r\n    inventor had joined some other persons engaged on the same\r\n    invention at Mentz, the art was there perfected by one John\r\n    Gænsfleisch, who was blind through age, in the house called\r\n    Gutemberg, in which, in 1508, the College of Justice held its\r\n    sittings. Wimpheling does not seem to have known that Gænsfleisch\r\n    was also called Gutemberg, and that his first attempts at printing\r\n    were made in Strasburg.]\r\n\r\nHaving thus provided Gutemberg with an elder brother also named John,\r\nMeerman proceeds to find him employment; for at the period of his\r\nwriting much light had been thrown on the early history of printing, and\r\nno person in the least acquainted with the subject could believe that\r\nFaust was the thief who stole Coster’s types, as had been insinuated by\r\nJunius and affirmed by Boxhorn and Scriverius. Gænsfleisch the Elder is\r\naccordingly sent by Meerman to Harlem, and there engaged as a workman in\r\nLawrence Coster’s printing office. It is needless to ask if there be any\r\nproof of this: Meerman having introduced a new character into the Harlem\r\nfarce may claim the right of employing him as he pleases. As there is\r\nevidence of Gutemberg, or Gænsfleisch the Younger, being engaged at\r\nStrasburg about 1436 in some experiments connected with printing, and\r\nmention being made in the same documents of the fair of Aix-la-Chapelle,\r\nMeerman sends him there in 1435. From Aix-la-Chapelle, as the distance\r\nis not very great, Meerman makes him pay a visit to his elder brother,\r\nthen working as a printer in Coster’s office at Harlem. He thus has an\r\nopportunity of seeing Coster’s printing establishment, and of gaining\r\nsome information respecting the art, and hence his attempts at printing\r\nat Strasburg in 1436. In 1441 he supposes that John Gænsfleisch the\r\nElder stole his master’s types, and printed with them, at Mentz, in\r\n1442, “Alexandri Galli Doctrinale,” and “Petri Hispani Tractatus,” as\r\nrelated by Junius. As this trumpery story rests solely on the conjecture\r\nof the writer, it might be briefly dismissed for reconsideration when\r\nthe proofs should be produced; but as Heineken[III-72] has afforded the\r\nmeans of showing its utter falsity, it may perhaps be worth while to\r\nnotice some of the facts produced by him respecting the family and\r\nproceedings of Gutemberg.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-72: Nachrichten von Kunstlern und Kunst-Sachen, 1te.\r\n    Theil, S. 286-293.]\r\n\r\nJohn Gænsfleisch the Elder, whom Meerman makes Gutemberg’s elder\r\nbrother, was descended from a branch of the numerous family of\r\nGænsfleisch, which was also known by the local names of zum Jungen,\r\nGutenberg or Gutemberg, and Sorgenloch. This person, whom Meerman\r\nengages as a workman with Coster, was a man of property; and at the time\r\nthat we are given to understand he was residing at Harlem, we have\r\nevidence of his being married and having children born to him at Mentz.\r\nThis objection, however, could easily be answered by the ingenuity of a\r\nDutch commentator, who, as he has made the husband a thief, would find\r\nno difficulty in providing him with a suitable wife. He would also be\r\nvery likely to bring forward the presumed misconduct of the wife in\r\nsupport of his hypothesis of the husband being a thief. John Gænsfleisch\r\nthe Elder was married to Ketgin, daughter of Nicholas Jostenhofer of\r\nSchenkenberg, on the Thursday after St. Agnes’s day, 1437. In 1439 his\r\nwife bore him a son named Michael; and in 1442 another son, who died in\r\ninfancy. In 1441 we have evidence of his residing at Mentz; for in that\r\nyear his relation Rudiger zum Landeck appeared before a judge to give\r\nGænsfleisch an acknowledgment of his having properly discharged his\r\nduties as trustee, and of his having delivered up to the said Rudiger\r\nthe property left to him by his father and mother.\r\n\r\nThat John Gænsfleisch the Elder printed “Alexandri Galli Doctrinale,”\r\nand “Petri Hispani Tractatus,” at Mentz in 1442 with the types which he\r\nhad stolen from Coster, is as improbable as every other part of the\r\nstory. There is, in fact, not the slightest reason to believe that the\r\nworks in question were printed at Mentz in 1442, or that any book was\r\nprinted there with types until nearly eight years after that period. In\r\nopposition, however, to a host of historical evidence we have the\r\nassertion of Cornelius, who told the tale to Galius, who told it to\r\nJunius, who told it to the world.\r\n\r\nMeerman’s web of sophistry and fiction having been brushed away by\r\nHeineken, a modern advocate of Coster’s undertook to spin another, which\r\nhas also been swept down by a German critic. Jacobus Koning,[III-73]\r\ntown-clerk of Amsterdam, having learnt from a document printed by\r\nFischer, that Gutemberg had a brother named Friele, sends him to Harlem\r\nto work with Coster, and makes him the thief who stole the types; thus\r\ncopying Meerman’s plot, and merely substituting Gutemberg’s known\r\nbrother for John Gænsfleisch the Elder. On this attempt of Koning’s to\r\nmake the old sieve hold water by plastering it with his own mud,\r\nLehne[III-74] makes the following remarks:--\r\n\r\n“He gives up the name of John,--although it might be supposed that old\r\nCornelius would have known the name of his bedfellow better than\r\nKoning,--and without hesitation charges Gutemberg’s brother with the\r\ntheft. In order to flatter the vain-glory of the Harlemers, poor Friele,\r\nafter he had been nearly four hundred years in his grave, is publicly\r\naccused of robbery on no other ground than that Mynheer Koning had\r\noccasion for a thief. It is, however, rather unfortunate for the credit\r\nof the story that this Friele should have been the founder of one of the\r\nfirst families in Mentz, of the order of knighthood, and possessed of\r\ngreat property both in the city and the neighbourhood. Is it likely that\r\nthis person should have been engaged as a workman in the employment of\r\nthe Harlem churchwarden, and that he should have robbed him of his types\r\nin order to convey them to his brother, who then lived at Strasburg, and\r\nwho had been engaged in his own invention at least three years before,\r\nas is proved by the process between him and the Drytzehns published by\r\nSchœpflin? From this specimen of insulting and unjust accusation on a\r\nsubject of literary inquiry, we may congratulate the city of Amsterdam\r\nthat Mynheer Koning is but a law-writer and not a judge, should he be\r\nnot more just as a man than as an author.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-73: In a Memoir on the Invention of Printing, which\r\n    was crowned by the Academy of Sciences at Harlem in 1816.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-74: Einige Bemerkungen, &c. S. 18, 19.]\r\n\r\nIn a book of old accounts belonging to the city of Harlem, and extending\r\nfrom April 1439 to April 1440, Koning having discovered at least nine\r\nentries of expenses incurred on account of messengers despatched to the\r\nJustice-Court of Amsterdam, he concludes that there must have been some\r\nconference between the judges of Harlem and Amsterdam on the subject of\r\nCoster’s robbery. There is not a word mentioned in the entries on what\r\naccount the messengers were despatched, but he decides that it must have\r\nbeen on some business connected with this robbery, for the first\r\nmessenger was despatched on the last day of the Christmas holidays; and\r\nthe thief, according to the account of Junius, made choice of\r\nChristmas-eve as the most likely opportunity for effecting his purpose.\r\nTo this most logical conclusion there happens to be an objection, which\r\nhowever Mynheer Koning readily disposes of. The first messenger was\r\ndespatched on the last day of the Christmas holidays 1439, and the\r\naccounts terminate in April 1440; but according to the narrative of\r\nCornelius the robbery was committed on Christmas-eve 1441. This trifling\r\ndiscrepancy is however easily accounted for by the fact of the Dutch at\r\nthat period reckoning the commencement of the year from Easter, and by\r\nsupposing,--as the date is printed in numerals,--that Junius might have\r\nwritten 1442, instead of 1441, as the time when the two books appeared\r\nat Mentz printed with the stolen types, and within a year after the\r\nrobbery. Notwithstanding this _satisfactory_ explanation there still\r\nremains a trifling error to be rectified, and it will doubtless give the\r\nclear-headed advocate of Coster very little trouble. Admitting that the\r\naccounts are for the year commencing at Easter 1440 and ending at Easter\r\n1441, it is rather difficult to comprehend how they should contain any\r\nnotice of an event which happened at the Christmas following. The Harlem\r\nscribe possibly might have the gift of seeing into futurity as clearly\r\nas Mynheer Koning has the gift of seeing into the past. The arguments\r\nderived from paper-marks which Koning has advanced in favour of Coster\r\nare not worthy of serious notice.\r\n\r\nHe has found, as Meerman did before him, that one Lawrence Janszoon was\r\nliving in Harlem between 1420 and 1436, and that his name occurs within\r\nthat period as custos or warden of St. Bavon’s church. As he is never\r\ncalled “Coster,” a name acquired by the family, according to Junius, in\r\nconsequence of the office which they enjoyed by hereditary right, the\r\nidentity of Lawrence Janszoon and Lawrence Coster is by no means clearly\r\nestablished; and even if it were, the sole evidence of his having been a\r\nprinter rests on the testimony of Cornelius, who was scarcely ten years\r\nold when Lawrence Janszoon died. The correctness of Cornelius’s\r\nnarrative is questioned both by Meerman and Koning whenever his\r\nstatements do not accord with their theory, and yet they require others\r\nto believe the most incredible of his assertions. They themselves throw\r\ndoubts on the evidence of their own witness, and yet require their\r\nopponents to receive as true his deposition on the most important point\r\nin dispute---that Coster invented typography previous to 1441,--a point\r\non which he is positively contradicted by more than twenty authors who\r\nwrote previous to 1500; and negatively by the silence of Coster’s\r\ncontemporaries. Supposing that the account of Cornelius had been\r\npublished in 1488 instead of 1588, it would be of very little weight\r\nunless corroborated by the testimony of others who must have been as\r\nwell aware of Coster’s invention as himself; for the silence of\r\ncontemporary writers on the subject of an important invention or\r\nmemorable event, will always be of greater negative authority than the\r\nunsupported assertion of an individual who when an old man professes to\r\nrelate what he had heard and seen when a boy. If therefore the\r\nuncorroborated testimony of Cornelius would be so little worth, even if\r\npublished in 1488, of what value can it be printed in 1588, in the name\r\nof a person who was then dead, and who could not be called on to explain\r\nthe discrepancies of his part of the narrative? Whatever might be the\r\noriginal value of Cornelius’s testimony, it is deteriorated by the\r\nchannel through which it descends to us. He told it to a boy, who, when\r\nan old man, told it to another boy, who when nearly sixty years old\r\ninserts it in a book which he is writing, but which is not printed until\r\ntwelve years after his death.\r\n\r\nIt is singular how Mr. Ottley, who contends for the truth of Papillon’s\r\nstory of the Cunio, and who maintains that the art of engraving figures\r\nand text upon wood was well known and practised previous to 1285, should\r\nbelieve the account given by Cornelius of the origin of Coster’s\r\ninvention. If he does not believe this part of the account, with what\r\nconsistency can he require other people to give credit to the rest? With\r\nrespect to the origin and progress of the invention, Cornelius was as\r\nlikely to be correctly informed as he was with regard to the theft and\r\nthe establishment of printing at Mentz; if therefore Coster’s advocates\r\nthemselves establish the incorrectness of his testimony in the first\r\npart of the story, they destroy the general credibility of his evidence.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the fragments of “Alexandri Galli Doctrinale” and\r\n“Catonis Disticha” which have been discovered, printed with the same, or\r\nsimilar types as the Speculum Salvationis, no good argument can be\r\nfounded on them in support of Coster’s claims, although the facts which\r\nthey establish are decisive of the fallacy of Meerman’s assumptions. In\r\norder to suit his own theory, he was pleased to assert that the first\r\nedition of the Speculum was the only one of that book printed by Coster,\r\nand that it was printed with wooden types. Mr. Ottley has, however,\r\nshown that the edition which Meerman and others supposed to be the first\r\nwas in reality the second; and that the presumed second was\r\nunquestionably the first, and that the text was throughout printed with\r\nmetal types by means of a press. It is thus the fate of all Coster’s\r\nadvocates that the last should always produce some fact directly\r\ncontradicting his predecessors’ speculations, but not one confirmatory\r\nof the truth of the story on which all their arguments are based.\r\nMeerman questions the accuracy of Cornelius as reported by Junius;\r\nMeerman’s arguments are rejected by Koning; and Mr. Ottley, who espouses\r\nthe same cause, has from his diligent collation of two different\r\neditions of the Speculum afforded a convincing proof that on a most\r\nmaterial point all his predecessors are wrong. His inquiries have\r\nestablished beyond a doubt, that the text of the first edition of the\r\nSpeculum was printed wholly with metal types; and that in the second the\r\ntext was printed partly from metal types by means of a press, and partly\r\nfrom wood-blocks by means of friction. The assertion that Coster printed\r\nthe first edition with wooden types, and that his grandsons and\r\nsuccessors printed the second edition with types of metal, is thus most\r\nclearly refuted. As no printer’s name has been discovered in any of the\r\nfragments referred to, it is uncertain where or when they were printed.\r\nIt however seems more likely that they were printed in Holland or the\r\nLow Countries than in Germany. The presumption of their antiquity in\r\nconsequence of their rarity is not a good ground of argument. Of an\r\nedition of a “Donatus,” printed by Sweinheim and Pannartz, between 1465\r\nand 1470, and consisting of three hundred copies, not one is known to\r\nexist. From sundry fragments of a “Donatus,” embellished with the same\r\nornamented small capitals as are used in Faust and Scheffer’s Psalter,\r\nFischer was pleased to conjecture that the book had been printed by\r\nGutemberg and Faust previous to 1455. A copy, however, has been\r\ndiscovered bearing the imprint of Scheffer, and printed, in all\r\nprobability, subsequent to 1467, as it is in this year that Scheffer’s\r\nname first appears alone. The “Historia Alexandri Magni,” pretendedly\r\nprinted with wooden types, and ascribed by Meerman to Coster, was\r\nprinted by Ketelar and Leempt, who first established a printing-office\r\nat Utrecht in 1473.\r\n\r\nJohn Enschedius, a letter-founder and printer of Harlem, and a strenuous\r\nassertor of Coster’s pretensions, discovered a very curious specimen of\r\ntypography which he and others have supposed to be the identical “short\r\nsentences” mentioned by Junius as having been printed by Coster for the\r\ninstruction of his grand-children. This unique specimen of typography\r\nconsists of eight small pages, each being about one inch and six-eighths\r\nhigh, by one and five-eighths wide, printed on parchment and on both\r\nsides. The contents are an alphabet; the Lord’s Prayer; the Creed; the\r\nAve Mary; and two short prayers, all in Latin. Meerman has given a\r\nfac-simile of all the eight pages in the second volume of his “Origines\r\nTypographicæ;”[III-75] and if this be correct, I am strongly inclined to\r\nsuspect that this singular “Horarium” is a modern forgery. The letters\r\nare rudely formed, and the shape of some of the pages is irregular; but\r\nthe whole appears to me rather as an imitation of rudeness and a studied\r\nirregularity, than as the first essay of an inventor. There are very few\r\ncontractions in the words; and though the letters are rudely formed, and\r\nthere are no points, yet I have seen no early specimen of typography\r\nwhich is so easy to read. It is apparent that the printer, whoever he\r\nmight be, did not forget that the little manual was intended for\r\nchildren. The letters I am positive could not be thus printed with types\r\nformed of beech-bark; and I am further of opinion that they were not,\r\nand could not be, printed with moveable types of wood. I am also certain\r\nthat, whatever might be the material of which the types were formed,\r\nthose letters could only be printed on parchment on both sides by means\r\nof a press. The most strenuous of Coster’s advocates have not ventured\r\nto assert that he was acquainted with the use of metal types in 1423,\r\nthe pretended date of his first printing short sentences for the use of\r\nhis grand-children, nor have any of them suggested that he used a press\r\nfor the purpose of obtaining impressions from his letters of beech-bark;\r\nhow then can it be pretended with any degree of consistency that this\r\n“Horarium” agrees exactly with the description of Cornelius? It is said\r\nthat Enschedius discovered this singular specimen of typography pasted\r\nin the cover of an old book. It is certainly such a one as he was most\r\nwishful to find, and which he in his capacity of typefounder and printer\r\nwould find little difficulty in producing. I am firmly convinced that it\r\nis neither printed with wooden types nor a specimen of early typography;\r\non the contrary, I suspect it to be a Dutch typographic essay on popular\r\ncredulity.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote III-75: Enschedius published a fac-simile himself, with\r\n    the following title: “Afbeelding van ’t A. B. C. ’t Pater Noster,\r\n    Ave Maria, ’t Credo, en Ave Salus Mundi, door Laurens Janszoon, te\r\n    Haarlem, ten behoeven van zyne dochters Kinderen, met beweegbaare\r\n    Letteren gedrukt, en teffens aangeweesen de groote der Stukjes\r\n    pergament, zekerlyk ’t oudste overblyfsel der eerste Boekdrukkery,\r\n    ’t welk als zulk een eersteling der Konst bewaard word en berust\r\n    in de Boekery van _Joannes Enschedé_, Lettergieter en Boekdrukker\r\n    te Haarlem, 1768.--_A. J. Polak sculps. ex originali._”]\r\n\r\nOf all the works which have been claimed for Coster, his advocates have\r\nnot succeeded in making out his title to a single one; and the best\r\nevidence of the fallacy of his claims is to be found in the writings of\r\nthose persons by whom they have been most confidently asserted. Having\r\nno theory of my own to support, and having no predilection in favour of\r\nGutemberg, I was long inclined to think that there might be some\r\nrational foundation for the claims which have been so confidently\r\nadvanced in favour of Harlem. An examination, however, of the presumed\r\nproofs and arguments adduced by Coster’s advocates has convinced me that\r\nthe claims put forward on his behalf, as the inventor of typography, are\r\nuntenable. They have certainly discovered that a person of the name of\r\nLawrence Janszoon was living at Harlem between the years 1420 and 1440,\r\nbut they have not been able to show anything in proof of this person\r\never having printed any book either from wood-blocks or with moveable\r\ntypes. There is indeed reason to believe that at the period referred to\r\nthere were three persons of the name of Lawrence Janszoon,--or\r\nFitz-John, as the surname may be rendered;--but to which of them the\r\npretended invention is to be ascribed is a matter of doubt. At one time\r\nwe find the inventor described as an illegitimate scion of the noble\r\nfamily of Brederode, which was descended from the ancient sovereigns of\r\nHolland; at another he is said to have been called Coster in consequence\r\nof the office of custos or warden of St. Bavon’s church being hereditary\r\nin his family; and in a third account we find Lawrence Janszoon figuring\r\nas a promoter of sedition and one of the leaders of a body of rioters.\r\nThe advocates for the claims of Harlem have brought forward every\r\nLawrence that they could find at that period whose father’s name was\r\nJohn; as if the more they could produce the more conclusive would be the\r\n_proof_ of one of them at least being the inventor of printing. As the\r\nbooks which are ascribed to Coster furnish positive evidence of the\r\nincorrectness of the story of Cornelius and of the comments of Meerman;\r\nand as records, which are now matters of history, prove that neither\r\nGutemberg nor Faust stole any types from Coster or his descendants, the\r\nnext supporter of the claims of Harlem will have to begin _de novo_; and\r\nlest the palm should be awarded to the wrong Lawrence Janszoon, he ought\r\nfirst to ascertain which of them is really the hero of the old\r\nbookbinder’s tale.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nWOOD ENGRAVING IN CONNEXION WITH THE PRESS.\r\n\r\n  Faust and Scheffer’s Psalter of 1457 -- Printing at Bamberg in 1461\r\n  -- Books Containing Wood-Cuts Printed there by Albert Pfister --\r\n  Opposition of the Wood Engravers of Augsburg to the Earliest\r\n  Printers Established in that City -- Travelling Printers --\r\n  Wood-Cuts in “Meditationes Johannis De Turre-Cremata,” Rome, 1467;\r\n  and in “Valturius De Re Militari,” Verona, 1472 -- Wood-Cuts\r\n  Frequent in Books Printed at Augsburg Between 1474 and 1480 --\r\n  Wood-Cuts in Books Printed by Caxton -- Maps Engraved on Wood, 1482\r\n  -- Progress of Map Engraving -- Cross-Hatching -- Flowered Borders\r\n  -- Hortus Sanitatis -- Nuremberg Chronicle -- Wood Engraving in\r\n  Italy -- Poliphili Hypnerotomachia -- Decline of Block-Printing --\r\n  Old Wood-Cuts in Derschau’s Collection.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering Gutemberg as the inventor of printing with moveable types;\r\nthat his first attempts were made at Strasburg about 1436; and that with\r\nFaust’s money and Scheffer’s ingenuity the art was perfected at Mentz\r\nabout 1452, I shall now proceed to trace the progress of wood engraving\r\nin its connexion with the press.\r\n\r\nIn the first book which appeared with a date and the printers’\r\nnames--the Psalter printed by Faust and Scheffer, at Mentz, in 1457--the\r\nlarge initial letters, engraved on wood and printed in red and blue ink,\r\nare the must beautiful specimens of this kind of ornament which the\r\nunited efforts of the wood-engraver and the pressman have produced. They\r\nhave been imitated in modern times, but not excelled. As they are the\r\nfirst letters, in point of time, printed with two colours, so are they\r\nlikely to continue the first in point of excellence.\r\n\r\nOnly seven copies of the Psalter of 1457 are known, and they are all\r\nprinted on vellum. Although they have all the same colophon, containing\r\nthe printers’ names and the date, yet no two copies exactly correspond.\r\nA similar want of agreement is said to have been observed in different\r\ncopies of the Mazarine Bible, but which are, notwithstanding, of one and\r\nthe same edition. As such works would in the infancy of the art be a\r\nlong time in printing--more especially the Psalter, as, in consequence\r\nof the large capitals being printed in two colours, each side of many of\r\nthe sheets would have to be printed thrice--it can be a matter of no\r\nsurprise that alterations and amendments should be made in the text\r\nwhile the work was going through the press. In the Mazarine Bible, the\r\nentire Book of Psalms, which contains a considerable number of red\r\nletters, would have to pass four times through the press, including what\r\nprinters call the “reiteration.”[IV-1]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-1: By the common press only one side of a sheet can\r\n    be printed at once. The reiteration is the second printing of the\r\n    same sheet on the blank side. Thus in the Psalter of 1457 every\r\n    sheet containing letters of two colours on each side would have to\r\n    pass six times through the press. It was probably in consequence\r\n    of printing so much in red and black that the early printers used\r\n    to employ so many presses. Melchior de Stamham, abbot of St. Ulric\r\n    and St. Afra at Augsburg, and who established a printing-office\r\n    within that monastery, about 1472, bought five presses of John\r\n    Schüssler; a considerable number for what may be considered an\r\n    amateur establishment. He also had two others made by Sixtus\r\n    Saurloch.--Zapf, Annales Typographicæ Augustanæ, p. xxiv.]\r\n\r\nThe largest of the ornamented capitals in the Psalter of 1457 is the\r\nletter B, which stands at the commencement of the first psalm, “Beatus\r\nvir.” The letters which are next in size are an A, a C, a D, an E, and a\r\nP; and there are also others of a smaller size, similarly ornamented,\r\nand printed in two colours in the same manner as the larger ones.\r\nAlthough only two colours are used to each letter, yet when the same\r\nletter is repeated a variety is introduced by alternating the colours:\r\nfor instance, the shape of the letter is in one page printed red, with\r\nthe ornamental portions blue; and in another the shape of the letter is\r\nblue, and the ornamental portions red. It has been erroneously stated by\r\nPapillon that the large letters at the beginning of each psalm are\r\nprinted in three colours, red, blue, and purple; and Lambinet has copied\r\nthe mistake. A second edition of this Psalter appeared in 1459; a third\r\nin 1490; and a fourth in 1502, all in folio, like the first, and with\r\nthe same ornamented capitals. Heineken observes that in the edition of\r\n1490 the large letters are printed in red and green instead of red and\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of those large letters being printed in two colours, two\r\nblocks would necessarily be required for each; one for that portion of\r\nthe letter which is red, and another for that which is blue. In the\r\nbody, or shape, of the largest letter, the B at the beginning of the\r\nfirst psalm, the mass of colour is relieved by certain figures being cut\r\nout in the block, which appear white in the impression. On the stem of\r\nthe letter a dog like a greyhound is seen chasing a bird; and flowers\r\nand ears of corn are represented on the curved portions. These figures\r\nbeing white, or the colour of the vellum, give additional brightness to\r\nthe full-bodied red by which they are surrounded, and materially add to\r\nthe beauty and effect of the whole letter.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of two blocks being required for each letter, the means\r\nwere afforded of printing any of them twice in the same sheet or the\r\nsame page with alternate colours; for while the body of the first was\r\nprinted in red from one block, the ornamental portion of the second\r\nmight be printed red at the same time from the other block. In the\r\nsecond printing, with the blue colour, it would only be necessary to\r\ntranspose the blocks, and thus the two letters would be completed,\r\nidentical in shape and ornament, and differing only from the\r\ncorresponding portions being in the one letter printed red and in the\r\nother blue. In the edition of 1459 the same ornamented letter is to be\r\nfound repeated on the same page; but of this I have only noticed one\r\ninstance; though there are several examples of the same letter being\r\nprinted twice in the same sheet.\r\n\r\nAlthough the engraving of the most highly ornamented and largest of\r\nthose letters cannot be considered as an extraordinary instance of\r\nskill, even at that period, for many wood-cuts of an earlier date afford\r\nproof of greater excellence, yet the artist by whom the blocks were\r\nengraved must have had considerable practice. The whole of the\r\nornamental part, which would be the most difficult to execute, is\r\nclearly and evenly cut, and in some places with great neatness and\r\ndelicacy. “This letter,” says Heineken, “is an authentic testimony that\r\nthe artists employed on such a work were persons trained up and\r\nexercised in their profession. The art of wood engraving was no longer\r\nin its cradle.”\r\n\r\nThe name of the artist by whom those letters were engraved is unknown.\r\nIn Sebastian Munster’s Cosmography, book iii. chapter 159, John\r\nMeydenbach is mentioned as being one of Gutemberg’s assistants; and an\r\nanonymous writer in Serarius states the same fact. Heineken in noticing\r\nthese two passages writes to the following effect. “This Meydenbach is\r\ndoubtless the same person who proceeded with Gutemberg from Strasburg to\r\nMentz in 1444.[IV-2] It is probable that he was a wood engraver or an\r\nilluminator, but this is not certain; and it is still more uncertain\r\nthat this person engraved the cuts in a book entitled _Apocalipsis cum\r\nfiguris_, printed at Strasburg in 1502, because these are copied from\r\nthe cuts in the Apocalypse engraved and printed by Albert Durer at\r\nNuremberg. Whether this copyist was the _Jacobus Meydenbach_ who printed\r\nbooks at Mentz in 1491,[IV-3] or he was some other engraver, I have not\r\nbeen able to determine.”[IV-4]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-2: Heineken in his Nachrichten, T. I. S. 108, also\r\n    states that Meydenbach came from Strasburg with Gutemberg. Oberlin\r\n    however observes, “Je ne sais où de Heinecke a trouvè que ce\r\n    Meydenbach est venu en 1444 avec Gutenberg à Mayence.” Heineken\r\n    says, “In der Nachricht von Strassburg findet man dass ein\r\n    gewisser Meydenbach 1444 nach Maynz gezogen,” and refers to\r\n    Fournier, p. 40. Dissert sur l’Orig. de l’Imprimerie primitive.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-3: An edition of the Hortus Sanitatis with wood-cuts\r\n    was printed at Mentz, by _Jacobus Meydenbach_, in 1491.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-4: Idée Générale, p. 286.]\r\n\r\nAlthough so little is positively known respecting John Meydenbach,\r\nGutemberg’s assistant, yet Von Murr thinks that there is reason to\r\nsuppose that he was the artist who engraved the large initial letters\r\nfor the Psalter of 1457. Fischer, who declares that there is no\r\nsufficient grounds for this conjecture, confidently assumes, from false\r\npremises, that those letters were engraved by Gutemberg, “a person\r\nexperienced in such work,” adds he, “as we are taught by his residence\r\nat Strasburg.” From the account that we have of his residence and\r\npursuits at Strasburg, however, we are taught no such thing. We only\r\nlearn from it he was engaged in some invention which related to\r\nprinting. We learn that Conrad Saspach made him a press, and it is\r\nconjectured that the goldsmith Hanns Dunne was employed to engrave his\r\nletters; but there is not a word of his being an experienced wood\r\nengraver, nor is there a well authenticated passage in any account of\r\nhis life from which it might be concluded that he ever engraved a single\r\nletter. Fischer’s reasons for supposing that Gutemberg engraved the\r\nlarge letters in Faust and Scheffer’s Psalter are, however, contradicted\r\nby facts. Having seen a few leaves of a Donatus ornamented with the same\r\ninitial letters as the Psalter, he directly concluded that the former\r\nwas printed by Gutemberg and Faust prior to the dissolution of their\r\npartnership; and not satisfied with this leap he takes another, and\r\narrives at the conclusion that they were engraved by Gutemberg, as\r\n“_his_ modesty only could allow such works to appear without his name.”\r\n\r\nAlthough we have no information respecting the artist by whom those\r\nletters were engraved, yet it is not unlikely that they were suggested,\r\nif not actually drawn by Scheffer, who, from his profession of a scribe\r\nor writer[IV-5] previous to his connexion with Faust, may be supposed to\r\nhave been well acquainted with the various kinds of flowered and\r\nornamented capitals with which manuscripts of that and preceding\r\ncenturies were embellished. It is not unusual to find manuscripts of the\r\nearly part of the fifteenth century embellished with capitals of two\r\ncolours, red and blue, in the same taste as in the Psalter; and there is\r\nnow lying before me a capital P, drawn on vellum in red and blue ink, in\r\na manuscript apparently of the date of 1430, which is so like the same\r\nletter in the Psalter that the one might be supposed to have suggested\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-5: Scheffer previous to his connexion with Faust was\r\n    a “clericus,”--not a _clerk_ as distinguished from a layman, but a\r\n    writer or scribe. A specimen of his “set-hand,” written at Paris\r\n    in 1449, is given by Schœpflin in his Vindiciæ Typographicæ.\r\n    Several of the earliest printers were writers or illuminators;\r\n    among whom may be mentioned John Mentelin of Strasburg, John\r\n    Baemler of Augsburg, Ulric Zell of Cologne, and Colard Mansion of\r\n    Bruges.]\r\n\r\nIt was an object with Faust and Scheffer to recommend their\r\nPsalter--probably the first work printed by them after Gutemberg\r\nhad been obliged to withdraw from the partnership--by the beauty\r\nof its capitals and the sufficiency and distinctness of its\r\n“rubrications;”[IV-6] and it is evident that they did not fail in the\r\nattempt. The Psalter of 1457 is, with respect to ornamental printing,\r\ntheir greatest work; for in no subsequent production of their press\r\ndoes the typographic art appear to have reached a higher degree of\r\nexcellence. It may with truth be said that the art of printing--be\r\nthe inventor who he may--was perfected by Faust and Scheffer; for the\r\nearliest known production of their press remains to the present day\r\nunsurpassed as a specimen of skill in ornamental printing.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-6: This is intimated in the colophon, which, with the\r\n    contracted words written at length, is as follows: “Presens\r\n    Spalmorum codex venustate capitalium decoratus Rubricationibusque\r\n    sufficienter distinctus. Adinventione artificiosa imprimendi ac\r\n    caracterizandi absque calami ulla exaracione sic effigiatus. Et ad\r\n    eusebiam dei industrie est consummatus. Per Johannem Fust, Civem\r\n    maguntinum. Et Petrum Schoffer de Gernzheim, Anno domini\r\n    Millesimo. cccc. lvii. In vigilia Assumpcionis.” In the second\r\n    edition the mis-spelling, “Spalmorum” for “Psalmorum,” is\r\n    corrected.]\r\n\r\nA fac-simile of the large B at the commencement of the Psalter, printed\r\nin colours the same as the original, is given in the first volume of\r\nDibdin’s Bibliotheca Spenceriana, and in Savage’s Hints on Decorative\r\nPrinting; but in neither of those works has the excellence of the\r\noriginal letter been attained. In the Bibliotheca Spenceriana, although\r\nthe volume has been printed little more than twenty years, the red\r\ncolour in which the body of the letter is printed has assumed a coppery\r\nhue, while in the original, executed nearly four hundred years ago, the\r\nfreshness and purity of the colours remain unimpaired. In Savage’s work,\r\nthough the letter and its ornaments are faithfully copied[IV-7] and\r\ntolerably well printed, yet the colours are not equal to those of the\r\noriginal. In the modern copy the blue is too faint; and the red, which\r\nin the original is like well impasted paint, has not sufficient body,\r\nbut appears like a wash, through which in many places the white paper\r\nmay be seen. The whole letter compared with the original seems like a\r\nwater-colour copy compared with a painting in oil.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-7: It is to be observed that in Savage’s copy the\r\n    perpendicular flourishes are given horizontally, above and below\r\n    the letter, in order to save room. In a copy of the edition of\r\n    1459, in the King’s Library, part of the lower flourish has not\r\n    been inked, as it would have interfered with the letter Q at the\r\n    commencement of the second psalm “_Quare fremuerunt gentes_.”\r\n    Traces of the flourish where not coloured may be observed\r\n    impressed in the vellum.]\r\n\r\nAlthough it has been generally supposed that the art of printing was\r\nfirst carried from Mentz in 1462 when Faust and Scheffer’s sworn workmen\r\nwere dispersed[IV-8] on the capture of that city by the archbishop\r\nAdolphus of Nassau, yet there can be no doubt that it was practised at\r\nBamberg before that period; for a book of fables printed at the latter\r\nplace by Albert Pfister is expressly dated on St. Valentine’s day, 1461;\r\nand a history of Joseph, Daniel, Judith, and Esther was also printed by\r\nPfister at Bamberg in 1462, “+Nit lang nach sand walpurgen tag+,”--not\r\nlong after St. Walburg’s day.[IV-9] It is therefore certain that the art\r\nwas practised beyond Mentz previous to the capture of that city, which\r\nwas not taken until the eve of St. Simon and St. Jude; that is, on the\r\n28th of October in 1462. As it is very probable that Pfister would have\r\nto superintend the formation of his own types and the construction of\r\nhis own presses,--for none of his types are of the same fount as those\r\nused by Gutemberg or by Faust and Scheffer,--we may presume that he\r\nwould be occupied for some considerable time in preparing his materials\r\nand utensils before he could begin to print. As his first known work\r\nwith a date, containing a hundred and one wood-cuts, was finished on the\r\n14th of February 1461, it is not unlikely that he might have begun to\r\nmake preparations three or four years before. Upon these grounds it\r\nseems but reasonable to conclude with Aretin, that the art was carried\r\nfrom Mentz by some of Gutemberg and Faust’s workmen on the dissolution\r\nof their partnership in 1455; and that the date of the capture of\r\nMentz--when for a time all the male inhabitants capable of bearing arms\r\nwere compelled to leave the city by the captors--marks the period of its\r\nmore general diffusion. The occasion of the disaster to which Mentz was\r\nexposed for nearly three years was a contest for the succession to the\r\narchbishopric. Theodoric von Erpach having died in May 1459, a majority\r\nof the chapter chose Thierry von Isenburg to succeed him, while another\r\nparty supported the pretensions of Adolphus of Nassau. An appeal having\r\nbeen made to Rome, the election of Thierry was annulled, and Adolphus\r\nwas declared by the Pope to be the lawful archbishop of Mentz. Thierry,\r\nbeing in possession and supported by the citizens, refused to resign,\r\nuntil his rival, assisted by the forces of his adherents and relations,\r\nsucceeded in obtaining possession of the city.[IV-10]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-8: The following passage occurs in the colophon of\r\n    two works printed by John Scheffer at Mentz in 1515 and 1516; the\r\n    one being the “Trithemii Breviarium Historiæ Francorum,” and the\r\n    other “Breviarium Ecclesiæ Mindensis:” “Retinuerunt autem hi duo\r\n    jam prænominati, _Johannes Fust et Petrus Scheffer_, hanc artem in\r\n    secreto, (omnibus ministris et familiaribus eorum, ne illam quoquo\r\n    modo manifestarent, jure jurando adstrictis :) quæ tandem anno\r\n    Domini M.CCCC.LXII. per eosdem familiares in diversas terrarum\r\n    provincias divulgata, haud parvum sumpsit incrementum.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-9: St. Walburg’s day is on the 25th of February;\r\n    though her feast is also held both on the 1st of May and on the\r\n    12th of October. The eve of her feast on the 1st of May is more\r\n    particularly celebrated; and it is then that the witches and\r\n    warlocks of Germany hold their annual meeting on the Brocken. St.\r\n    Walburg, though born of royal parents in Saxony, was yet educated\r\n    in England, at the convent of Wimborn in Dorsetshire, of which she\r\n    became afterwards abbess, and where she died in 779.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-10: A mournful account of the expulsion of the\r\n    inhabitants and the plundering of the city is given by Trithemius\r\n    at page 30 of his “Res Gestæ Frederici Palatini,” published with\r\n    notes by Marquard Freher, at Heidelberg, 4to. 1603.]\r\n\r\nUntil the discovery of Pfister’s book containing the four histories,\r\nmost bibliographers supposed that the date 1461, in the fables, related\r\nto the composition of the work or the completion of the manuscript, and\r\nnot to the printing of the book. Saubert, who was the first to notice\r\nit, in 1643, describes it as being printed, both text and figures, from\r\nwood-blocks; and Meerman has adopted the same erroneous opinion.\r\nHeineken was the first to describe it truly, as having the text printed\r\nwith moveable types, though he expresses himself doubtfully as to the\r\ndate, 1461, being that of the impression.\r\n\r\nAs the discovery of Pfister’s tracts has thrown considerable light on\r\nthe progress of typography and wood engraving, I shall give an account\r\nof the most important of them, as connected with those subjects; with a\r\nbrief notice of a few circumstances relative to the early connexion of\r\nwood engraving with the press, and to the dispersion of the printers on\r\nthe capture of Mentz in 1462.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the history of Joseph, Daniel, Judith, and Esther, with\r\nthe date 1462, printed at Bamberg by Pfister, has established the fact\r\nthat the dates refer to the years in which the books were printed, and\r\nnot to the period when the works were composed or transcribed.

Steiner, pastor of\r\nthe church of St. Ulric at Augsburg, was first printed in Meusel’s\r\nHistorical and Literary Magazine in 1792; and a more ample description\r\nof this and other tracts printed by Pfister was published by Camus in\r\n1800,[IV-11] when the volume containing them, which was the identical\r\none that had been previously seen by Steiner, was deposited in the\r\nNational Library at Paris.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-11: Under the title of “Notice d’un Livre imprimé à\r\n    Bamberg en CIↃCCCCLXII. lue à l’Institut National, par Camus.”\r\n    4to. Paris, An VII. [1800.]]\r\n\r\nThe book of fables[IV-12] printed by Pfister at Bamberg in 1461 is a\r\nsmall folio consisting of twenty-eight leaves, and containing\r\neighty-five fables in rhyme in the old German language. As those fables,\r\nwhich are ascribed to one “Boner, dictus der Edelstein,” are known to\r\nhave been written previous to 1330, the words at the end of the\r\nvolume,--“Zu Bamberg dies Büchlein geendet ist,”--At Bamberg this book\r\nis finished,--most certainly relate to the time when it was printed, and\r\nnot when it was written. It is therefore the earliest book printed with\r\nmoveable types which is illustrated with wood-cuts containing figures.\r\nNot having an opportunity of seeing this extremely rare book,--of which\r\nonly one perfect copy is known,--I am unable to speak from personal\r\nexamination of the style in which its hundred and one cuts are engraved.\r\nHeineken, however, has given a fac-simile of the first, and he says that\r\nthe others are of a similar kind. The following is a reduced copy of the\r\nfac-simile given by Heineken, and which forms the head-piece to the\r\nfirst fable. On the manner in which it is engraved I shall make no\r\nremark, until I shall have produced some specimens of the cuts contained\r\nin a “Biblia Pauperum Predicatorum,” also printed by Pfister, and having\r\nthe text in the German language.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-12: The copy of those fables belonging to the\r\n    Wolfenbuttel Library, and which is the only one known, was taken\r\n    away by the French and placed in the National Library at Paris,\r\n    but was restored on the surrender of Paris in 1815.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe volume described by Camus contains three different works; and\r\nalthough Pfister’s name, with the date 1462, appears in only one of\r\nthem, the “Four Histories,” yet, as the type is the same in all, there\r\ncan be no doubt of the other two being printed by the same person and\r\nabout the same period. The following particulars respecting its contents\r\nare derived from the “Notice” of Camus. It is a small folio consisting\r\naltogether of a hundred and one leaves of paper of good quality,\r\nmoderately thick and white, and in which the water-mark is an ox’s head.\r\nThe text is printed in a large type, called missal-type; and though the\r\ncharacters are larger, and there is a trifling variation in three or\r\nfour of the capitals, yet they evidently appear to have been copied from\r\nthose of the Mazarine Bible.\r\n\r\nThe first work is that which Heineken calls “une Allégorie sur la\r\nMort;”[IV-13] but this title does not give a just idea of its contents.\r\nIt is in fact a collection of accusations preferred against Death, with\r\nhis answers to them. The object is to show that such complaints are\r\nunavailing, and that, instead of making them, people ought rather to\r\nemploy themselves in endeavouring to live well. In this tract, which\r\nconsists of twenty-four leaves, there are five wood-cuts, each occupying\r\nan entire page. The first represents Death seated on a throne. Before\r\nhim there is a man with a child, who appears to accuse Death of having\r\ndeprived him of his wife, who is seen on a tomb wrapped in a\r\nwinding-sheet.--In the second cut, Death is also seen seated on a\r\nthrone, with the same person apparently complaining against him, while a\r\nnumber of persons appear approaching sad and slow, to lay down the\r\nensigns of their dignity at his feet.--In the third cut there are two\r\nfigures of Death; one on foot mows down youths and maidens with a\r\nscythe, while another, mounted, is seen chasing a number of figures on\r\nhorseback, at whom he at the same time discharges his arrows.--The\r\nfourth cut consists of two parts, the one above the other. In the upper\r\npart, Death appears seated on a throne, with a person before him in the\r\nact of complaining, as in the first and second cuts. In the lower part,\r\nto the left of the cut, is seen a convent, at the gate of which there\r\nare two persons in religious habits; to the right a garden is\r\nrepresented, in which are perceived a tree laden with fruit, a woman\r\ncrowning an infant, and another woman conversing with a young man. In\r\nthe space between the convent and the garden certain signs are engraved,\r\nwhich Camus thinks are intended to represent various branches of\r\nlearning and science,--none of which can afford protection against\r\ndeath,--as they are treated of in the chapter which precedes the cut. In\r\nthe fifth cut, Death and the Complainant are seen before Christ, who is\r\nseated on a throne with an angel on each side of him, under a canopy\r\nornamented with stars. Although neither Heineken nor Camus give\r\nspecimens of those cuts, nor speak of the style in which they are\r\nexecuted, it may be presumed that they are not superior either in design\r\nor engraving to those contained in the other tracts.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-13: Idée Générale, p. 276. Dr. Dibdin in his\r\n    Bibliographical Tour says that this work “is entitled by Camus the\r\n    ALLEGORY OF DEATH.” This is a mistake; for Camus, who objects to\r\n    this title,--which was given to it by Heineken,--always refers to\r\n    the book under the title of “Les Plaintes contre la Mort.”]\r\n\r\nThe text of the work is divided into thirty-four chapters, each of\r\nwhich, except the first, is preceded by a summary; and their numbers are\r\nprinted in Roman characters. The initial letter of each chapter is red,\r\nand appears to have been formed by means of a stencil. The first\r\nchapter, which has neither title nor numeral, commences with the\r\nComplainant’s recital of his injuries; in the second, Death defends\r\nhimself; in the third the Complainant resumes, in the fourth Death\r\nreplies; and in this manner the work proceeds, the Complainant and Death\r\nspeaking alternately through thirty-two chapters. In the thirty-third,\r\nGod decides between the parties; and after a few common-place\r\nreflections and observations on the readiness of people to complain on\r\nall occasions, sentence is pronounced in these words: “The Complainant\r\nis condemned, and Death has gained the cause. Of right, the Life of\r\nevery man is due to Death; to Earth his Body, and to Us his Soul.” In\r\nthe thirty-fourth chapter, the Complainant, perceiving that he has lost\r\nhis suit, proceeds to pray to God on behalf of his deceased wife. In the\r\nsummary prefixed to the chapter the reader is informed that he is now\r\nabout to peruse a model of a prayer; and that the name of the\r\nComplainant is expressed by the large red letters which are to be found\r\nin the chapter. Accordingly, in the course of the chapter, six red\r\nletters, besides the initial at the beginning, occur at the commencement\r\nof so many different sentences. They are formed by means of a stencil,\r\nwhile the letters at the commencement of other similar sentences are\r\nprinted black. Those red letters, including the initial at the beginning\r\nof the chapter, occur in the following order, IHESANW. Whether the name\r\nis expressed by them as they stand, or whether they are to be combined\r\nin some other manner, Camus will not venture to decide.[IV-14] From the\r\nprayer it appears that the name of the Complainant’s deceased wife was\r\nMargaret. In this singular composition, which in the summary is declared\r\nto be a model, the author, not forgetting the court language of his\r\nnative country, calls the Almighty “the Elector who determines the\r\nchoice of all Electors,” “Hoffmeister” of the court of Heaven, and\r\n“Herzog” of the Heavenly host. The text is in the German language, such\r\nas was spoken and written in the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-14: “Outre la lettre initiale, on remarque, dans le\r\n    cours du chapitre, six lettres rouges non imprimées, mais peintes\r\n    à la plaque, qui commencent six phrases diverses. Les lettres\r\n    initiales des autres phrases du même chapitre sont imprimées en\r\n    noir. Les lettres rouges sont IHESANW. Doit-on les assembler dans\r\n    l’ordre où elles sont placées, ou bien doivent-elles recevoir un\r\n    autre arrangement? Je ne prends pas sur moi de le\r\n    décider.”--Camus, Notice, p. 6.]\r\n\r\nThe German words “_Hoffmeister_” and “_Herzog_” appear extremely\r\nridiculous in Camus’s French translation,--“le Maître-d’hôtel de la cour\r\ncéleste,” and “le Grand-duc de l’armée céleste.” But this is clothing\r\nancient and dignified German in modern French frippery. The word\r\n“Hoffmeister”--literally, “court-master or governor”--is used in modern\r\nGerman in nearly the same sense as the English word “steward;” and the\r\ngovernor or tutor of a young prince or nobleman is called by the same\r\nname. The word “Herzog”--the “Grand-duc” of Camus--in its original\r\nsignification means the leader of a host or army. It is a German title\r\nof honour which defines its original meaning, and is in modern language\r\nsynonymous with the English title “Duke.” The ancient German “Herzog”\r\nwas a leader of hosts; the modern French “Grand-duc” is a clean-shaved\r\ngentleman in a court-dress, redolent of eau-de-Cologne, and bedizened\r\nwith stars and strings. The two words are characteristic of the two\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nThe second work in the volume is the Histories of Joseph, Daniel,\r\nJudith, and Esther. It has no general frontispiece nor title; but each\r\nseparate history commences with the words: “Here begins the history of\r\n. . . .” in German. Each history forms a separate gathering, and the\r\nwhole four are contained in sixty leaves, of which two, about the\r\nmiddle, are blank, although there is no appearance of any deficiency in\r\nthe history. The text is accompanied with wood-cuts which are much less\r\nthan those in the “Complaints against Death,” each occupying only the\r\nspace of eleven lines in a page, which when full contains twenty-eight.\r\nThe number of the cuts is sixty-one; but there are only fifty-five\r\ndifferent subjects, four of them having been printed twice, and one\r\nthrice. Camus gives a specimen of one of the cuts, which represents the\r\nJews of Bethuliah rejoicing and offering sacrifice on the return of\r\nJudith after she had cut off the head of Holofernes. It is certainly a\r\nvery indifferent performance, both with respect to design and engraving;\r\nand from Camus’s remarks on the artist’s ignorance and want of taste it\r\nwould appear that the others are no better. In one of them Haman is\r\ndecorated with the collar of an order from which a cross is suspended;\r\nand in another Jacob is seen travelling to Egypt in a carriage[IV-15]\r\ndrawn by two horses, which are harnessed according to the manner of the\r\nfifteenth century, and driven by a postilion seated on a saddle, and\r\nwith his feet in stirrups. All the cuts in the “Four Histories” are\r\ncoarsely coloured.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-15: Camus calls it a “voiture,” but I question if\r\n    such a carriage was known in 1462; and am inclined to think that\r\n    he has converted a kind of light waggon into a modern “voiture.”\r\n    A light sort of waggon, called by Stow a “Wherlicote,” was used in\r\n    England by the mother of Richard the Second in the manner of a\r\n    modern coach. I have noticed in an old wood-cut a light travelling\r\n    waggon, drawn by what is called a “unicorn team” of three horses;\r\n    that is, one as a “leader,” and two “wheelers,” with the driver\r\n    riding on the “near side” wheeler. This cut is in the Bagford\r\n    collection in the British Museum, and is one of a series of ninety\r\n    subjects from the Old and New Testament which have been cut out of\r\n    a book. A manuscript note in German states that they are by\r\n    Michael Wolgemuth, and printed in 1491. In no wood-cut executed\r\n    previous to 1500 have I seen a vehicle like a modern French\r\n    voiture.]\r\n\r\nIt is this work which Camus, in his title-page, professes to give an\r\naccount of, although in his tract he describes the other two contained\r\nin the same volume with no less minuteness. He especially announced a\r\nnotice of this work as “a book printed at Bamberg in 1462,” in\r\nconsequence of its being the most important in the volume; for it\r\ncontains not only the date and place, but also the printer’s name. In\r\nthe book of Fables, printed with the same types at Bamberg in 1461,\r\nPfister’s name does not appear.\r\n\r\nThe text of the “Four Histories” ends at the fourth line on the recto of\r\nthe sixtieth leaf; and after a blank space equal to that of a line,\r\nthirteen lines succeed, forming the colophon, and containing the place,\r\ndate, and printer’s name. Although those lines run continuously on,\r\noccupying the full width of the page as in prose, yet they consist of\r\ncouplets in German rhyme. The end of each verse is marked with a point,\r\nand the first word of the succeeding one begins with a capital. Camus\r\nhas given a fac-simile of those lines, that he might at once present his\r\nreaders with a specimen of the type and a copy of this colophon, so\r\ninteresting to bibliographers as establishing the important fact in the\r\nhistory of printing, namely, that the art was practised beyond Mentz\r\nprior to 1462. The following copy, though not a fac-simile, is printed\r\nline for line from Camus.\r\n\r\n  +Ein ittlich mensch von herzen gert . Das er wer weiss\r\n  und wol gelert . An meister un’ schrift das nit mag\r\n  sein . So kun’ wir all auch nit latein . Darauff han\r\n  ich ein teil gedacht . Und vier historii zu samen pra-\r\n  cht . Joseph daniel un’ auch judith .

Ame’.+\r\n\r\nThe following is a translation of the above, in English couplets of\r\nsimilar rhythm and measure as the original:\r\n\r\n  With heart’s desire each man doth seek\r\n  That he were wise and learned eke:\r\n  But books and teacher he doth need,\r\n  And all men cannot Latin read.\r\n  As on this subject oft I thought,\r\n  These hist’ries four I therefore wrote;\r\n  Of Joseph, Daniel, Judith too,\r\n  And Esther eke, with purpose true:\r\n  These four did God with bliss requite,\r\n  As he doth all who act upright.\r\n  That men may learn their lives to mend\r\n  This book at Bamberg here I end.\r\n  In the same city, as I’ve hinted,\r\n  It was by Albert Pfister printed,\r\n  In th’ year of grace, I tell you true,\r\n  A thousand four hundred and sixty-two;\r\n  Soon after good St. Walburg’s day,\r\n  Who well may aid us on our way,\r\n  And help us to eternal bliss:\r\n  God, of his mercy, grant us this. Amen.\r\n\r\nThe third work contained in the volume described by Camus is an edition\r\nof the “Poor Preachers’ Bible,” with the text in German, and printed on\r\nboth sides. The number of the leaves is eighteen, of which only\r\nseventeen are printed; and as there is a “history” on each page, the\r\ntotal number in the work is thirty-four, each of which is illustrated\r\nwith five cuts. The subjects of those cuts and their arrangement on the\r\npage is not precisely the same as in the earlier Latin editions; and as\r\nin the latter there are forty “histories,” six are wanting in the\r\nBamberg edition, namely: 1. Christ in the garden; 2. The soldiers\r\nalarmed at the sepulchre; 3. The Last Judgment; 4. Hell; 5. The eternal\r\nFather receiving the righteous into his bosom; and 6. The crowning of\r\nthe Saints. As the cuts illustrative of these subjects are the last in\r\nthe Latin editions, it is possible that the Bamberg copy described by\r\nCamus might be defective; he, however, observes that there is no\r\nappearance of any leaves being wanting.[IV-16] In each page of the\r\nBamberg edition the text is in two columns below the cuts, which are\r\narranged in the following manner in the upper part of the page:\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n                      +------------------------+\r\n                      |                        |\r\n                      |            3           |\r\n  +--------------+    |                        |    +--------------+\r\n  |      1       |    |Christ appearing to the |    |      2       |\r\n  |              |    |                        |    |              |\r\n  |    Busts.    |    |        Apostles.       |    |    Busts.    |\r\n  |              |    |                        |    |              |\r\n  +--------------+    +------------------------+    +--------------+\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------+------+----------------------------+\r\n  |                            |      |                            |\r\n  |                            |      |                            |\r\n  |                            |      |                            |\r\n  |              4             |      |                            |\r\n  |                            |      |                            |\r\n  |                            |      |                            |\r\n  |   Joseph making himself    |      |  The Prodigal Son’s return |\r\n  |                            |      |                            |\r\n  |   known to his brethern.   |      |       to his father.       |\r\n  |                            |      |                            |\r\n  |                            |      |                            |\r\n  |                            |      |                            |\r\n  +----------------------------+------+----------------------------+]\r\n\r\nThe following cuts are fac-similes of those given by Camus; and the\r\nnumbers underneath each relate to their position in the preceding\r\nexample of their arrangement. In No. 1 the heads are intended for David\r\nand the author of the Book of Wisdom; in No. 2, for Isaiah and Ezekiel.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 1.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 2.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-16: The copy of the Bamberg edition in the\r\n    Wolfenbuttel Library, seen and described by Heineken, Idée\r\n    Générale, pp. 327-329, contained only twenty-six “histories,” or\r\n    general subjects.]\r\n\r\nThe subject represented in the following cut, No. 3, forming the centre\r\npiece at the top in the arrangement of the original page, is Christ\r\nappearing to his disciples after his resurrection. The figure on the\r\nright of Christ is intended for St. Peter, and that on his left for St.\r\nJohn. I believe that in no wood-cut, ancient or modern, is Christ\r\nrepresented with so uncomely an aspect and so clumsy a figure.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe subject of No. 4 is Joseph making himself known to his brethren;\r\nfrom Genesis, chapter XLV.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 4.]\r\n\r\nIn No. 5 the subject represented is the Prodigal Son received by his\r\nfather; from St. Luke, chapter XV. Camus says that the cuts given by him\r\nwere engraved on wood by Duplaa with the greatest exactitude from\r\ntracings of the originals by Dubrena.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 5.]\r\n\r\nSupposing that all the cuts in the four works, printed by Pfister and\r\ndescribed in the preceding pages, were designed in a similar taste and\r\nexecuted in a similar manner to those of which specimens are given, the\r\npersons by whom they were engraved--for it is not likely that they were\r\nall engraved by one man--must have had very little knowledge of the art.\r\nLooking merely at the manner in which they are engraved, without\r\nreference to the wretched drawing of the figures and want of “feeling”\r\ndisplayed in the general treatment of the subjects, a moderately apt\r\nlad, at the present day, generally will cut as well by the time that he\r\nhas had a month or two’s practice. If those cuts were to be considered\r\nas fair specimens of wood engraving in Germany in 1462, it would be\r\nevident that the art was then declining; for none of the specimens that\r\nI have seen of the cuts printed by Pfister can bear a comparison with\r\nthose contained in the early block-books, such as the Apocalypse, the\r\nHistory of the Virgin, or the early editions of the Poor Preachers’\r\nBible. To the cuts contained in the latter works they are decidedly\r\ninferior, both with respect to design and engraving. Even the earliest\r\nwood-cuts which are known,--for instance, the St. Christopher, the St.\r\nBridget, and the Annunciation, in Earl Spencer’s collection,--are\r\nexecuted in a superior manner.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be unfair to conclude that the cuts which appear in\r\nPfister’s works were the best that were executed at that period. On the\r\ncontrary, it is probable that they are the productions of persons who in\r\ntheir own age would be esteemed only as inferior artists. As the\r\nprogress of typography was regarded with jealousy by the early wood\r\nengravers and block printers, who were apprehensive that it would ruin\r\ntheir trade, and as previous to the establishment of printing they were\r\nalready formed into companies or fellowships, which were extremely\r\nsensitive on the subject of their exclusive rights, it is not unlikely\r\nthat the earliest type-printers who adorned their books with wood-cuts\r\nwould be obliged to have them executed by a person who was not\r\nprofessionally a wood engraver. It is only upon this supposition that we\r\ncan account for the fact of the wood-cuts in the earliest books printed\r\nwith type being so very inferior to those in the earliest block-books.\r\nThis supposition is corroborated by the account which we have of the\r\nproceedings of the wood engravers of Augsburg shortly after\r\ntype-printing was first established in that city. In 1471 they opposed\r\nGunther Zainer’s[IV-17] admission to the privileges of a burgess, and\r\nendeavoured to prevent him printing wood engravings in his books.\r\nMelchior Stamham, however, abbot of St. Ulric and Afra, a warm promoter\r\nof typography, interested himself on behalf of Zainer, and obtained an\r\norder from the magistracy that he and John Schussler--another printer\r\nwhom the wood engravers had also objected to--should be allowed to\r\nfollow without interruption their art of printing. They were, however,\r\nforbid to print initial letters from wood-blocks or to insert wood-cuts\r\nin their books, as this would be an infringement on the privileges of\r\nthe fellowship of wood engravers. Subsequently the wood engravers came\r\nto an understanding with Zainer, and agreed that he should print as many\r\ninitial letters and wood-cuts as he pleased, provided that they engraved\r\nthem.[IV-18] Whether Schussler came to the same agreement or not is\r\nuncertain, as there is no book known to be printed by him of a later\r\ndate than 1472. It is probable that he is the person,--named John\r\n_Schüssler_ in the memorandum printed by Zapf,--of whom Melchior de\r\nStamham in that year bought five presses for the printing-office which\r\nhe established in his convent of St. Ulric and St. Afra. To John Bämler,\r\nwho at the same time carried on the business of a printer at Augsburg,\r\nno objection appears to have been made. As he was originally a\r\n“calligraphus” or ornamental writer, it is probable that he was a member\r\nof the wood engravers’ guild, and thus entitled to engrave and print his\r\nown works without interruption.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-17: Gunther Zainer was a native of Reutlingen, in\r\n    Wirtemberg, and was the first printer in Germany who used Roman\r\n    characters,--in an edition of “Isidori Episcopi Hispalensis\r\n    Etymologia,” printed by him in 1472. He first began to print at\r\n    Augsburg in 1468. In 1472 he printed a German translation of the\r\n    book entitled “Belial,” with wood-cuts. A Latin edition of this\r\n    book was printed by Schussler in the same year. Von Murr says that\r\n    Schussler printed another edition of “Belial” in 1477; but this\r\n    would seem to be a mistake, for Veith asserts in his “Diatribe de\r\n    Origine et Incrementis Artis Typographicæ in urbe Augusta\r\n    Vindelica,” prefixed to Zapf’s “Annales,” that Schussler only\r\n    printed in the years 1470, 1471, and 1472.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-18: Von Murr, Journal, 2 Theil, S. 144.--Zapf,\r\n    Buchdruckergeschichte von Augsburg, 1 Band.]\r\n\r\nAs it is probable that the wood-cuts which appear in books printed\r\nwithin the first thirty years from the establishment of typography at\r\nMentz were intended to be coloured, this may in some degree account for\r\nthe coarseness with which they are engraved; but as the wood-cuts in the\r\nearlier block-books were also intended to be coloured in a similar\r\nmanner, the inferiority of the former can only be accounted for by\r\nsupposing that the best wood engravers declined to assist in promoting\r\nwhat they would consider to be a rival art, and that the earlier\r\nprinters would generally be obliged to have their cuts engraved by\r\npersons connected with their own establishments, and who had not by a\r\nregular course of apprenticeship acquired a knowledge of the art. About\r\nseventy or eighty years ago, and until a more recent period, many\r\ncountry printers in England used themselves to engrave such rude\r\nwood-cuts as they might occasionally want. A most extensive assortment\r\nof such wood-cuts belonged to the printing-office of the late Mr. George\r\nAngus of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, who used them as head-pieces and general\r\nillustrations to ballads and chap-books. A considerable number of them\r\nwere cut with a penknife, on pear-tree wood, by an apprentice named\r\nRandell, who died about forty years ago. Persons who are fond of a\r\n“rough harvest” of such modern-antiques are referred to the “Historical\r\nDelights,” the “History of Ripon,” and other works published by Thomas\r\nGent at York about 1733.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the rudeness with which the cuts are engraved in the\r\nfour works printed by Pfister, yet from their number a considerable\r\nportion of time must have been occupied in their execution. In the “Four\r\nHistories” there are sixty-one cuts, which have been printed from\r\nfifty-five blocks. In the “Fables” there are one hundred and one cuts;\r\nin the “Complaints against Death,” five; and in the “Poor Preachers’\r\nBible,” one hundred and seventy, reckoning each subject separately.\r\nSupposing each cut in the _three_ last works was printed from a separate\r\nblock, the total number of blocks required for the _four_ would be three\r\nhundred and thirty-one.[IV-19] Supposing that each cut on an average\r\ncontained as much work as that which is numbered 4 in the preceding\r\nspecimens--Joseph making himself known to his brethren--and supposing\r\nthat the artist drew the subjects himself, the execution of those three\r\nhundred and thirty-one cuts would occupy one person for about two years\r\nand a half, allowing him to work three hundred days in each year. It is\r\ntrue that a modern wood engraver might finish more than three of such\r\ncuts in a week, yet I question if any one of the profession would\r\ncomplete the whole number, with his own hands, in less time than I have\r\nspecified.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-19: Lichtenberger, in his Initia Typographica,\r\n    referring to Sprenger’s History of Printing at Bamberg, says that,\r\n    besides those four, five other tracts are printed with Pfister’s\r\n    types, of which three contain wood-cuts. One of those three,\r\n    however, a “Poor Preachers’ Bible,” with the text in Latin, has\r\n    the same cuts as the “Poor Preachers’ Bible” with the text in\r\n    German. Only one of those other five works contains the place and\r\n    date.]\r\n\r\nFrom the similarity between Pfister’s types and those with which a Bible\r\nwithout place or date is printed, several bibliographers have ascribed\r\nthe latter work to his press. This Bible, which in the Royal Library at\r\nParis is bound in three volumes folio, is the rarest of all editions of\r\nthe Scriptures printed in Latin. Schelhorn, who wrote a dissertation on\r\nthis edition, endeavoured to show that it was the first of the Bibles\r\nprinted at Mentz, and that it was partly printed by Gutemberg and Faust\r\nprevious to their separation, and finished by Faust and Scheffer in\r\n1456.[IV-20] Lichtenberger, without expressly assenting to Schelhorn’s\r\nopinion, is inclined to think that it was printed at Mentz, and by\r\nGutemberg. The reasons which he assigns, however, are not such as are\r\nlikely to gain assent without a previous willingness to believe. He\r\nadmits that Pfister’s types are similar to those of the Bible, though he\r\nsays that the former are somewhat ruder.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-20: De Antiquissima Latinorum Bibliorum editione\r\n    . . . . Jo. Georgii Schelhorn Diatribe. Ulmæ, 4to. 1760.]\r\n\r\nCamus considers that the tracts unquestionably printed by Pfister throw\r\nconsiderable light on the question as to whom this Bible is to be\r\nascribed. There are two specimens of this Bible, the one given by Masch\r\nin his Bibliotheca Sacra, and the other by Schelhorn, in a dissertation\r\nprefixed to Quirini’s account of the principal works printed at Rome.\r\nCamus, on comparing these specimens with the text of Pfister’s tracts,\r\nimmediately perceived the most perfect resemblance between the\r\ncharacters; and on applying a tracing of the last thirteen lines of the\r\n“Four Histories” to the corresponding letters in Schelhorn’s specimen,\r\nhe found that the characters exactly corresponded. This perfect identity\r\ninduced him to believe that the Bible described by Schelhorn was printed\r\nwith Pfister’s types. A correspondent in Meusel’s Magazine, No. VII.\r\n1794, had previously advanced the same opinion; and he moreover thought\r\nthat the Bible had been printed previous to the Fables dated 1461,\r\nbecause the characters of the Bible are cleaner, and appear as if they\r\nhad been impressed from newer types than those of the Fables.[IV-21] In\r\nsupport of this opinion an extract is given, in the same magazine, from\r\na curious manuscript of the date of 1459, and preserved in the library\r\nof Cracow. This manuscript is a kind of dictionary of arts and sciences,\r\ncomposed by Paul of Prague, doctor of medicine and philosophy, who, in\r\nhis definition of the word “Libripagus,” gives a curious piece of\r\ninformation to the following effect. The barbarous Latin of the original\r\npassage, to which I shall have occasion to refer, will be found in the\r\nsubjoined note.[IV-22] “He is an artist who dexterously cuts figures,\r\nletters, and whatever he pleases on plates of copper, of iron, of solid\r\nblocks of wood, and other materials, that he may print upon paper, on a\r\nwall, or on a clean board. He cuts whatever he pleases; and he proceeds\r\nin this manner with respect to pictures. In my time somebody of Bamberg\r\ncut the entire Bible upon plates; in four weeks he impressed the whole\r\nBible, thus sculptured, upon thin parchment.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-21: Dr. Dibdin says that a copy of this Bible, which\r\n    formerly belonged to the Earl of Oxford, and is now in the Royal\r\n    Library at Paris, contains “an undoubted coeval MS. date, in red\r\n    ink, of 1461.”--Bibliog. Tour, vol. ii p. 108. Second edition.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-22: “Libripagus est artifex sculpens subtiliter in\r\n    laminibus æreis, ferreis, ac ligneis solidi ligni, atque aliis,\r\n    imagines, scripturam et omne quodlibet, ut prius imprimat papyro\r\n    aut parieti aut asseri mundo. Scindit omne quod cupit, et est homo\r\n    faciens talia cum picturis; et tempore mei Bambergæ quidam\r\n    sculpsit integram bibliam super lamellas, et in quatuor septimanis\r\n    totam bibliam in pergameno subtili præsignavit sculpturam.”]\r\n\r\nAlthough I am of opinion that the weight of evidence is in favour of\r\nPfister being the printer of the Bible in question, yet I cannot think\r\nthat the arguments which have been adduced in his favour derive any\r\nadditional support from this passage. The writer, like many other\r\ndictionary makers, both in ancient and modern times, has found it a more\r\ndifficult matter to give a clear account of a _thing_ than to find the\r\nsynonym of a _word_. But, notwithstanding his confused account, I think\r\nthat I can perceive in it the “disjecta membra” of an ancient\r\nFormschneider and a Briefmaler, but no indication of a typographer.\r\n\r\nIn a jargon worthy of the “Epistolæ obscurorum virorum” he describes an\r\nartist, or rather an artizan, “sculpens subtiliter in laminibus[IV-23]\r\n[laminis] æreis, ferreis, ac ligneis solidi ligni, atque aliis,\r\nimagines, scripturam et omne quodlibet.” In this passage the business of\r\nthe “Formschneider” may be clearly enough distinguished: he cuts figures\r\nand animals in plates of copper and iron;--but not in the manner of a\r\nmodern copper-plate engraver; but in the manner in which a stenciller\r\npierces his patterns. That this is the true meaning of the writer is\r\nevident from the context, wherein he informs us of the artist’s object\r\nin cutting such letters and figures, namely, “ut prius imprimat papyro\r\naut parieti aut asseri mundo,”--that he may print upon paper, on a wall,\r\nor on a clean board. This is evidently descriptive of the practice of\r\nstencilling, and proves, if the manuscript be authentic, that the old\r\n“Briefmalers” were accustomed to “slapdash” walls as well as to engrave\r\nand colour cards. In the distinction which is made of the “laminibus\r\nligneis _ligni solidi_,” it is probable that the writer meant to specify\r\nthe difference between cutting out letters and figures on thin plates of\r\nmetal, and cutting _upon_ blocks of solid wood. When he speaks of a\r\nBible being cut, at Bamberg, “super lamellas,” he most likely means a\r\n“Poor Preachers’ Bible,” engraved on blocks of wood. An impression of a\r\nhundred or more copies of such a work might easily enough be taken in a\r\nmonth when the blocks were all ready engraved; but we cannot suppose\r\nthat the Bible ascribed to Pfister could be worked off in so short a\r\ntime. This Bible consists of eight hundred and seventy leaves; and to\r\nprint an edition of three hundred copies at the rate of three hundred\r\nsheets a day would require four hundred and fifty days. About three\r\nhundred copies of each work appears to have been the usual number which\r\nSweinheim and Pannartz and Ulric Hahn printed, on the establishment of\r\nthe art in Italy; and Philip de Lignamine in his chronicle mentions,\r\nunder the year 1458, that Gutemberg and Faust, at Mentz, and Mentelin at\r\nStrasburg, printed three hundred sheets in a day.[IV-24]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-23: In 1793, a learned doctor of divinity of\r\n    Cambridge is said in a like manner to have broken Priscian’s head\r\n    with “_paginibus_.” An epigram on this “blunder_bus_” is to be\r\n    found in the “Gradus ad Cantabrigiam.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-24: Lichtenberger, Initia Typographica, p. 51.]\r\n\r\nOf Pfister nothing more is positively known than what the tracts printed\r\nby him afford; namely, that he dwelt at Bamberg, and exercised the\r\nbusiness of a printer there in 1461 and 1462. He might indeed print\r\nthere both before and after those years, but of this we have no direct\r\nevidence. From 1462 to 1481 no book is known to have been printed at\r\nBamberg. In the latter year, a press was established there by John\r\nSensenschmidt of Egra, who had previously, that is from 1470, printed\r\nseveral works at Nuremberg.\r\n\r\nPanzer, alluding to Pfister as the printer only of the Fables and of the\r\ntracts contained in the volume described by Camus, says that he can\r\nscarcely believe that he had a fixed residence at Bamberg; and that\r\nthose tracts most likely proceeded from the press of a travelling\r\nprinter.[IV-25] Several of the early printers, who commenced on their\r\nown account, on the dispersion of Faust and Scheffer’s workmen in 1462,\r\nwere accustomed to travel with their small stock of materials from one\r\nplace to another; sometimes finding employment in a monastery, and\r\nsometimes taking up their temporary abode in a small town; removing to\r\nanother as soon as public curiosity was satisfied, and the demand for\r\nthe productions of their press began to decline. As they seldom put\r\ntheir names, or that of the place, to the works which they printed, it\r\nis extremely difficult to decide on the locality or the date of many old\r\nbooks printed in Germany. It is very likely that they were their own\r\nletter-founders, and that they themselves engraved such wood-cuts as\r\nthey might require. As their object was to gain money, it is not\r\nunlikely that they might occasionally sell a portion of their types to\r\neach other;[IV-26] or to a novice who wished to begin the business, or\r\nto a learned abbot who might be desirous of establishing an amateur\r\npress within the precinct of his monastery, where copies of the Facetiæ\r\nof Poggius might be multiplied as well as the works of St. Augustine.\r\nAlthough it has been asserted the monks regarded with jealousy the\r\nprogress of printing, as if it were likely to make knowledge too cheap,\r\nand to interfere with a part of their business as transcribers of books,\r\nsuch does not appear to have been the fact. In every country in Europe\r\nwe find them to have been the first to encourage and promote the new\r\nart; and the annals of typography most clearly show that the greater\r\npart of the books printed within the first thirty years from the time of\r\nGutemberg and Faust’s partnership were chiefly for the use of the monks\r\nand the secular clergy.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-25: “Opuscula quæ typis mandavit typographus hic,\r\n    hactenus ignotus, ad litteraturam Teutonicam pertinent. Imprimis\r\n    Pfisterum hunc Bambergæ fixam habuisse sedem vix crediderim.\r\n    Videntur potius hi libri Teutonici monumenta transeuntis\r\n    typographi.”--Annal. Typogr. tom. i. p. 142, cited by Camus.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-26: Breitkopf, Ueber Bibliographie, S. 25. 4to.\r\n    Leipzig, 1793.]\r\n\r\nFrom 1462 to 1467 there appears to have been no book printed containing\r\nwood-cuts. In the latter year Ulric Hahn, a German, printed at Rome a\r\nbook entitled “Meditationes Johannis de Turrecremata,”[IV-27] which\r\ncontains wood-cuts engraved in simple outline in a coarse manner. The\r\nwork is in folio, and consists of thirty-four leaves of stout paper, on\r\nwhich the water-mark is a hunter’s horn. The number of cuts is also\r\nthirty-four; and the following--the creation of animals--is a reduced\r\ncopy of the first.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-27: The following is the title at length as it is\r\n    printed, in red letters, underneath the first cut: “Meditationes\r\n    Reverē dissimi patris dñi Johannis de turre cremata sacros͞ce\r\n    Romane eccl’ie cardinalis posite & depicte de ipsius mādato ī\r\n    eccl’ie ambitu Marie de Minerva. Rome.” The book is described in\r\n    Von Murr’s Memorabilia Bibliothecar. Publicar. Norimbergensium and\r\n    in Dibdin’s Ædes Althorpianæ, vol. ii. p. 273, with specimens of\r\n    the cuts.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the cuts are executed in a similar style; and though\r\ndesigned with more spirit than those contained in Pfister’s tracts, yet\r\nit can scarcely be said that they are better engraved. The following is\r\nan enumeration of the subjects. 1. The Creation, as above represented.\r\n2. The Almighty speaking to Adam. 3. Eve taking the apple. (From No. 3\r\nthe rest of the cuts are illustrative of the New Testament or of\r\nEcclesiastical History.) 4. The Annunciation. 5. The Nativity.\r\n6. Circumcision of Christ. 7. Adoration of the Magi. 8. Simeon’s\r\nBenediction. 9. The Flight into Egypt. 10. Christ disputing with the\r\nDoctors in the Temple. 11. Christ baptized. 12. The Temptation in the\r\nWilderness. 13. The keys given to Peter. 14. The Transfiguration.\r\n15. Christ washing the Apostles’ feet. 16. The Last Supper. 17. Christ\r\nbetrayed by Judas. 18. Christ led before the High Priest. 19. The\r\nCrucifixion. 20. Mater Dolorosa. 21. The Descent into Hell. 22. The\r\nResurrection. 23. Christ appearing to his Disciples. 24. The Ascension.\r\n25. The feast of Pentecost 26. The Host borne by a bishop. 27. The\r\nmystery of the Trinity; Abraham sees three and adores one. 28. St.\r\nDominic extended like the “_Stam-Herr_” or first ancestor in a pedigree,\r\nand sending forth numerous branches as Popes, Cardinals, and Saints.\r\n29. Christ appearing to St. Sixtus. 30. The Assumption of the Virgin.\r\n31. Christ seated amidst a choir of Angels. 32. Christ seated at the\r\nVirgin’s right hand in the assembly of Saints. 33. The Office of Mass\r\nfor the Dead. 34. The Last Judgment.\r\n\r\nZani says that those cuts were engraved by an Italian artist, but beyond\r\nhis assertion there is no authority for the fact. It is most likely that\r\nthey were cut by one of Hahn’s workmen, who could occasionally “turn his\r\nhand” to wood-engraving and type-founding, as well as compose and work\r\nat press; and it is most probable that Hahn’s workmen when he first\r\nestablished a press in Rome were Germans, and not Italians.\r\n\r\nThe second book printed in Italy with wood-cuts is the “Editio Princeps”\r\nof the treatise of R. Valturius de Re Militari, which appeared at Verona\r\nfrom the press of “Johannes de Verona,” son of Nicholas the surgeon, and\r\nmaster of the art of printing.[IV-28] This work is dedicated by the\r\nauthor to Sigismund Malatesta, lord of Rimini, who is styled in pompous\r\nphrase, “Splendidissimum Arminensium Regem ac Imperatorem semper\r\ninvictum.” The work, however, must have been written several years\r\nbefore it was printed, for Baluze transcribed from a MS. dated 1463 a\r\nletter written in the name of Malatesta, and sent by the author with a\r\ncopy of his work to the Sultan Mahomet II. The bearer of this letter was\r\nthe painter Matteo Pasti, a friend of the author, who visited\r\nConstantinople at the Sultan’s request in order that he might paint his\r\nportrait. It is said that the cuts in this work were designed by Pasti;\r\nand it is very probable that he might make the drawings in Malatesta’s\r\nown copy, from which it is likely that the book was printed. As\r\nValturius has mentioned Pasti as being eminently skilful in the arts of\r\nPainting, Sculpture, and _Engraving_,[IV-29] Maffei has\r\nconjectured,--and Mr. Ottley adds, “with some appearance of\r\nprobability,”--that the cuts in question were executed by his hand. If\r\nsuch were the fact, it only could be regretted that an artist so eminent\r\nshould have mis-spent his time in a manner so unworthy of his\r\nreputation; for, allowing that a considerable degree of talent is\r\ndisplayed in many of the designs, there is nothing in the engraving, as\r\nthey are mere outlines, but what might be cut by a novice. There is not,\r\nhowever, the slightest reasonable ground to suppose that those\r\nengravings were cut by Matteo Pasti, for I believe that he died before\r\nprinting was introduced into Italy; and it surely would be presuming\r\nbeyond the verge of probability to assert that they might be engraved in\r\nanticipation of the art being introduced, and of the book being printed\r\nat some time or other, when the blocks would be all ready engraved,\r\nin a simple style of art indeed, but with a master’s hand.\r\nA master-sculptor’s hand, however, is not very easily distinguished\r\nin the mere rough-dressing of a block of sandstone, which any country\r\nmason’s apprentice might do as well. It is very questionable if Matteo\r\nPasti was an engraver in the present sense of the word; the engraving\r\nmeant by Valturius was probably that of gold and silver vessels and\r\nornaments; but not the engraving of plates of copper or other metal\r\nfor the purpose of being printed.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-28: The following is a copy of the colophon:\r\n    “Johannes ex verona oriundus: Nicolai cyrurgie medici filius:\r\n    Artis impressorie magister: hunc de re militari librum\r\n    elegantissimum: litteris et figuratis signis sua in patria primus\r\n    impressit. An. MCCCCLXXII.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-29: “Valturius speaks of Pasti in one of his letters\r\n    as being eminently skilful in the arts of Painting, Sculpture, and\r\n    Engraving.”--Ottley, Inquiry, p. 257.]\r\n\r\nSeveral of those cuts occupy an entire folio page, though the greater\r\nnumber are of smaller size. They chiefly represent warlike engines,\r\nwhich display considerable mechanical skill on the part of the\r\ncontriver; modes of attack and defence both by land and water, with\r\nvarious contrivances for passing a river which is not fordable, by means\r\nof rafts, inflated bladders, and floating bridges. In some of them\r\ninventions may be noticed which are generally ascribed to a later\r\nperiod: such as a boat with paddle-wheels, which are put in motion by a\r\nkind of crank; a gun with a stock, fired from the shoulder; and a\r\nbomb-shell. It has frequently been asserted that hand-guns were first\r\nintroduced about the beginning of the sixteenth century, yet the figure\r\nof one in the work of Valturius makes it evident that they were known\r\nsome time before. It is also likely that the drawing was made and the\r\ndescription written at least ten years before the book was printed. It\r\nhas also been generally asserted that bomb-shells were first used by\r\nCharles VIII. of France when besieging Naples in 1495. Valturius,\r\nhowever, in treating of cannon, ascribes the invention to\r\nMalatesta.[IV-30] Gibbon, in chapter lxviii. of his History of the\r\nDecline and Fall of the Roman Empire, notices this cut of a bomb-shell.\r\nHis reference is to the second edition of the work, in Italian, printed\r\nalso at Verona by Bonin de Bononis in 1483, with the same cuts as the\r\nfirst edition in Latin.[IV-31] The two following cuts are fac-similes of\r\nthe bomb-shell and the hand-gun, as represented in the edition of 1472.\r\nThe figure armed with the gun,--a portion of a large cut,--is firing\r\nfrom a kind of floating battery; and in the original two figures armed\r\nwith similar weapons are stationed immediately above him.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-30: “Inventum est quoque alterum machinæ hujusce tuum\r\n    Sigismonde Panpulfe [Malatesta]: qua pilæ æneæ tormentarii\r\n    pulveris plenæ cum fungi aridi fomite urientis emittuntur.”--We\r\n    hence learn that the first bomb-shells were made of copper, and\r\n    that the fuzee was a piece of a dried fungus. As the first edition\r\n    has neither numerals nor signatures, I cannot refer to the page in\r\n    which the above passage is to be found. It is, however, opposite\r\n    to the cut in which the bomb-shell appears, and that is about the\r\n    middle of the volume.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-31: “Robert Valturio published at Verona, in 1483,\r\n    his twelve books de Re Militari, in which he first mentions the\r\n    use of bombs. By his patron Sigismond Malatesti, Prince of Rimini,\r\n    it had been addressed with a Latin epistle to Mahomet\r\n    II.”--Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, chap. lxviii., note.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe following fac-simile of a cut representing a man shooting with a\r\ncross-bow is the best in the book. The drawing of the figure is good,\r\nand the attitude graceful and natural. The figure, indeed, is not only\r\nthe best in the work of Valturius, but is one of the best, so far as\r\nrespects the drawing, that is to be met with in any book printed in the\r\nfifteenth century.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe practice of introducing wood-cuts into printed books seems to have\r\nbeen first generally adopted at Augsburg, where Gunther Zainer, in 1471,\r\nprinted a German translation of the “Legenda Sanctorum” with figures of\r\nthe saints coarsely engraved on wood. This, I believe, is the first\r\nbook, after Pfister’s tracts, printed in Germany with wood-cuts and\r\ncontaining a date. In 1472 he printed a second volume of the same work,\r\nand an edition of the book entitled “Belial,”[IV-32] both containing\r\nwood-cuts. Several other works printed by him between 1471 and 1475 are\r\nillustrated in a similar manner. Zainer’s example was followed at\r\nAugsburg by his contemporaries John Bämler and John Schussler; and by\r\nthem, and Anthony Sorg, who first began to print there about 1475, more\r\nbooks with wood-cuts were printed in that city previous to 1480 than at\r\nany other place within the same period. In 1477 the first German Bible\r\nwith wood-cuts was printed by Sorg, who printed another edition with the\r\nsame cuts and initial letters in 1480. In 1483 he printed an account of\r\nthe Council of Constance held in 1431, with upwards of a thousand\r\nwood-cuts of figures and of the arms of the principal persons both lay\r\nand spiritual who attended the council. Upon this work Gebhard, in his\r\nGenealogical History of the Heritable States of the German Empire, makes\r\nthe following observations:--“The first printed collection of arms is\r\nthat of 1483 in the History of the Council of Constance written by\r\nUlrich Reichenthal. To this council we are indebted accidentally for the\r\ncollection. From the thirteenth century it was customary to hang up the\r\nshields of noble and honourable persons deceased in churches; and\r\nsubsequently the practice was introduced of painting them upon the\r\nwalls, or of placing them in the windows in stained glass. A similar\r\ncustom prevailed at the Council of Constance; for every person of\r\nconsideration who attended had his arms painted on the wall in front of\r\nhis chamber; and thus Reichenthal, who caused those arms to be copied\r\nand engraved on wood, was enabled to give in his history the first\r\ngeneral collection of coat-armour which had appeared; as eminent persons\r\nfrom all the Catholic states of Europe attended this council.”[IV-33]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-32: Von Murr says that the person who engraved the\r\n    cuts for this book also engraved the cuts in a German edition of\r\n    the Speculum without date, but printed at Augsburg, and dedicated\r\n    to John [von Giltingen] abbot of the monastery of St. Ulric and\r\n    St. Afra, who was chosen to that office in 1482. Heineken supposed\r\n    that the person to whom the book was dedicated was John von\r\n    Hohenstein, but he resigned the office of abbot in 1459; and the\r\n    book was certainly not printed at that period.--See Heineken, Idée\r\n    Gén. p. 466; and Von Murr, Journal, 2 Theil, S. 145.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-33: L. A. Gebhard, Genealogische Geschichte, 1 Theil,\r\n    Vorrede, S. 11. Cited by Veith in his “Diatribe,” prefixed to\r\n    Zapf’s “Annales Typographiæ Augustanæ.”]\r\n\r\nThe practice of introducing wood-cuts became in a few years general\r\nthroughout Germany. In 1473, John Zainer of Reutlingen, who is said to\r\nhave been the brother of Gunther, printed an edition of Boccacio’s work\r\n“De mulieribus claris,” with wood-cuts, at Ulm. In 1474 the first\r\nedition of Werner Rolewinck de Laer’s chronicle, entitled “Fasciculus\r\nTemporum,” was printed with wood-cuts by Arnold Ther-Hoernen at Cologne;\r\nand in 1476 an edition of the same work, also with wood-cuts, was\r\nprinted at Louvain by John Veldener, who previously had been a printer\r\nat Cologne. In another edition of the same work printed by Veldener at\r\nUtrecht in 1480, the first page is surrounded with a border of foliage\r\nand flowers cut on wood; and another page, about the middle of the\r\nvolume, is ornamented in a similar manner. These are the earliest\r\ninstances of ornamental borders from wood-blocks which I have observed.\r\nAbout the beginning of the sixteenth century title-pages surrounded with\r\nornamental borders are frequent. From the name of those borders,\r\n_Rahmen_, the German wood engravers of that period are sometimes called\r\n_Rahmenschneiders_. Prosper Marchand, in his “Dictionnaire Historique,”\r\ntom. ii. p. 156, has stated that Erhard Ratdolt, a native of Augsburg,\r\nwho began to print at Venice about 1475, was the first printer who\r\nintroduced flowered initial letters, and vignettes--meaning by the\r\nlatter term wood-cuts; but his information is scarcely correct.\r\nWood-cuts--without reference to Pfister’s tracts, which were not known\r\nwhen Marchand wrote--were introduced at Augsburg six years before\r\nRatdolt and his partners[IV-34] printed at Venice in 1476 the\r\n“Calendarium Joannis Regiomontani,” the work to which Marchand alludes.\r\nIt may be true that he introduced a new kind of initial letters\r\nornamented with flowers in this work, but much more beautiful initial\r\nletters had appeared long before in the Psalter, in the “Durandi\r\nRationale,” and the “Donatus” printed by Faust and Scheffer. The first\r\nperson who mentions Ratdolt as the inventor of “florentes litteræ,” so\r\nnamed from the flowers with which they are intermixed, is Maittaire, in\r\nhis Annales Typographici, tom. i. part i. p. 53.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-34: The following colophon to an edition of Appian\r\n    informs us that his partners were Bernard the painter and Peter\r\n    Loslein, who also acted as corrector of the press: “Impressum est\r\n    hoc opus Venetiis per Bernardū pictorem & Erhardum ratdolt de\r\n    Augusta una cum Petro Loslein de Langenzen correctore ac socio.\r\n    Laus Deo. MCCCCLXXVII.”]\r\n\r\nIn 1483 Veldener,[IV-35] as has been previously observed at page 106,\r\nprinted at Culemburg an edition in small quarto of the Speculum\r\nSalvationis, with the same blocks as had been used in the earlier folio\r\neditions, which are so confidently ascribed to Lawrence Coster. In\r\nVeldener’s edition each of the large blocks, consisting of two\r\ncompartments, is sawn in two in order to adapt them to a smaller page.\r\nA German translation of the Speculum, with wood-cuts, was printed at\r\nBasle, in folio, in 1476; and Jansen says that the first book printed in\r\nFrance with wood-cuts was an edition of the Speculum, at Lyons, in 1478;\r\nand that the second was a translation of the book named “Belial,”\r\nprinted at the same place in 1482.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-35: Veldener at the conclusion of a book printed by\r\n    him in 1476, containing “_Epistolares quasdam formulas_,” thus\r\n    informs the reader of his name and qualifications: “Accipito huic\r\n    artifici nomen esse magistro Johanni Veldener, cui quidem certa\r\n    manu insculpendi, celandi, intorculandi, caracterandi adsit\r\n    industria; adde et figurandi et effigiendi.” That is, his name was\r\n    John Veldener; he could engrave, could work both at press and\r\n    case, and moreover he knew something of sculpture, and could paint\r\n    a little.]\r\n\r\nThe first printed book in the English language that contains wood-cuts\r\nis the second edition of Caxton’s “Game and Playe of the Chesse,”\r\na small folio, without date or place, but generally supposed to have\r\nbeen printed about 1476.[IV-36] The first edition of the same work,\r\nwithout cuts, was printed in 1474. On the blank leaves at the end of a\r\ncopy of the first edition in the King’s Library, at the British Museum,\r\nthere is written in a contemporary hand a list of the bannerets and\r\nknights[IV-37] made at the battle of “Stooke by syde newerke apon trent\r\nthe xvi day of june the ii^de yer of harry the vii.” that is, in 1487.\r\nIn this battle Martin Swart was killed. He commanded the Flemings, who\r\nwere sent by the Duchess of Burgundy to assist Lambert Simnel. It was at\r\nthe request of the duchess, who was Edward the Fourth’s sister, that\r\nCaxton translated the “Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye,” the first\r\nbook printed in the English language, and which appeared at Cologne in\r\n1471 or 1472.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-36: Heineken, Idée Gén. p. 207, erroneously states\r\n    that the first book with wood-cuts printed in England was the\r\n    Golden Legend, by Caxton, in 1483. It is probable that the second\r\n    edition of the Game of Chess preceded it by seven years, and it\r\n    certainly was printed after the Mirror of the World.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-37: The following are some of the names as they are\r\n    written: “S gilbert talbott . S John cheiny . S williā stoner .\r\n    Theis iij wer made byfore the bataile, and after the bataile were\r\n    made the same day : S^r. John of Arundell . Thomas Cooksey . John\r\n    forteskew . Edmond benyngfeld . james blount . ric . of Croffte .\r\n    Geofrey Stanley . ric . delaber . John mortymer . williā\r\n    troutbeke.” The above appear to have been created _Bannerets_, for\r\n    after them follows a list of “_Knyghtes_ made at the same\r\n    bataile.” It is likely that the owner of the volume was at the\r\n    battle, and that the names were written immediately after.]\r\n\r\nIn Dr. Dibdin’s edition of Ames’s Typographical Antiquities there is a\r\n“Description of the Pieces and Pawns” in the second edition of Caxton’s\r\nChess; which description is said to be illustrated with facsimile\r\nwood-cuts. There are indeed fac-similes of some of the figures given,\r\nbut not of the wood-cuts generally; for in almost every cut given by Dr.\r\nDibdin the back-ground of the original is omitted. In the description of\r\nthe first fac-simile there is also an error: it is said to be “the\r\n_first_ cut in the work,” while in fact it is the _second_. The\r\nfollowing I believe to be a correct list of these first fruits of\r\nEnglish wood-engraving.\r\n\r\n1. An executioner with an axe cutting to pieces, on a block, the limbs\r\nof a man. On the head, which is lying on the ground, there is a crown.\r\nBirds are seen seizing and flying away with portions of the limbs. There\r\nare buildings in the distance, and three figures, one of whom is a king\r\nwith a crown and sceptre, appear looking on. 2. A figure sitting at a\r\ntable, with a chess-board before him, and holding one of the chess-men\r\nin his hand. This is the cut which Dr. Dibdin says is the first in the\r\nbook. 3. A king and another person playing at chess. 4. The king at\r\nchess, seated on a throne. 5. The king and queen. 6. The “alphyns,” now\r\ncalled “bishops” in the game of chess, “in the maner of judges sittyng.”\r\n7. The knight. 8. The “rook,” or castle, a figure on horseback wearing a\r\nhood and holding a staff in his hand. From No. 9 to No. 15 inclusive,\r\nthe pawns are thus represented. 9. Labourers and workmen, the principal\r\nfigure representing the first pawn, with a spade in his right hand and a\r\ncart-whip in his left. 10. The second pawn, a smith with his buttriss in\r\nthe string of his apron, and a hammer in his right hand. 11. The third\r\npawn, represented as a _clerk_, that is a writer or transcriber, in the\r\nsame sense as Peter Scheffer and Ulric Zell are styled _clerici_, with\r\nhis case of writing materials at his girdle, a pair of shears in one\r\nhand, and a large knife in the other. The knife, which has a large\r\ncurved blade, appears more fit for a butcher’s chopper than to make or\r\nmend pens. 12. The fourth pawn, a man with a pair of scales, and having\r\na purse at his girdle, representing “marchauntes or chaungers.” 13. The\r\nfifth pawn, a figure seated on a chair, having in his right hand a book,\r\nand in his left a sort of casket or box of ointments, representing a\r\nphysician, spicer, or apothecary. 14. The sixth pawn, an innkeeper,\r\nreceiving a guest. 15. The seventh pawn, a figure with a yard measure in\r\nhis right hand, a bunch of keys in his left, and an open purse at his\r\ngirdle, representing “customers and tolle gaderers.” 16. The eighth\r\npawn, a figure with a sort of badge on his breast near to his right\r\nshoulder, after the manner of a nobleman’s retainer, and holding a pair\r\nof dice in his left hand, representing dice-players, messengers, and\r\n“currours,” that is “couriers.” In old authors the numerous idle\r\nretainers of the nobility are frequently represented as gamblers,\r\nswash-bucklers, and tavern-haunters.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are twenty-four impressions in the volume, yet there are\r\nonly sixteen subjects, as described above; the remaining eight being\r\nrepetitions of the cuts numbered 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10, with two\r\nimpressions of the cut No. 2, besides that towards the commencement.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe above cut is a reduced copy of the knight, No. 7; and his character\r\nis thus described: “The knyght ought to be maad al armed upon an hors in\r\nsuche wise that he have an helme on his heed and a spere in his right\r\nhond, and coverid with his shelde, a swerde and a mace on his left syde\r\n. clad with an halberke and plates tofore his breste . legge harnoys on\r\nhis legges . spores on his heelis, on hys handes hys gauntelettes . hys\r\nhors wel broken and taught and apte to bataylle and coveryd with hys\r\narmes. When the Knyghtes been maad they ben bayned or bathed . That is\r\nthe signe that they sholde lede a newe lyf and newe maners . also they\r\nwake alle the nyght in prayers and orisons unto god that he wil geve hem\r\ngrace that they may gete that thyng that they may not gete by nature.\r\nThe kyng or prynce gyrdeth a boute them a swerde in signe that they\r\nshold abyde and kepen hym of whom they taken their dispences and\r\ndignyte.”\r\n\r\nThe following cut of the sixth or bishop’s pawn, No. 14, “whiche is\r\nlykened to taverners and vytayllers,” is thus described in Caxton’s own\r\nwords: “The sixte pawn whiche stondeth before the alphyn on the lyfte\r\nsyde is made in this forme . ffor hit is a man that hath the right hond\r\nstretched out for to calle men, and holdeth in his left honde a loof of\r\nbreed and a cuppe of wyn . and on his gurdel hangyng a bondel of keyes,\r\nand this resemblith the taverners hostelers and sellars of vytayl . and\r\nthese ought properly to be sette to fore the alphyn as to fore a juge,\r\nfor there sourdeth oft tymes amonge hem contencion noyse and stryf,\r\nwhich behoveth to be determyned and trayted by the alphyn which is juge\r\nof the kynge.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe next book containing wood-cuts printed by Caxton is the “Mirrour of\r\nthe World, or thymage of the same,” as he entitles it at the head of the\r\ntable of contents. It is a thin folio consisting of one hundred leaves;\r\nand, in the Prologue, Caxton informs the reader that it “conteyneth in\r\nall lxvii chapitres and xxvii figures, without which it may not lightly\r\nbe understāde.” He also says that he translated it from the French at\r\nthe “request, desire, coste, and dispense of the honourable and\r\nworshipful man Hugh Bryce, alderman cytezeyn of London,” who intended to\r\npresent the same to William, Lord Hastings, chamberlain to Edward IV,\r\nand lieutenant of the same for the town of Calais and the marches there.\r\nOn the last page he again mentions Hugh Bryce and Lord Hastings, and\r\nsays of his translation: “Whiche book I begun first to trāslate the\r\nsecond day of Janyuer the yere of our lord M.cccc.lxxx. And fynysshed\r\nthe viii day of Marche the same yere, and the xxi yere of the reign of\r\nthe most crysten kynge, Kynge Edward the fourthe.”[IV-38]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-38: Edward IV. began to reign 4th March 1461; the\r\n    twenty-first year of his reign would consequently commence on 4th\r\n    March 1481; Caxton’s dates therefore do not agree, unless we\r\n    suppose that he reckoned the commencement of the year from 21st\r\n    March. If so, his date viii March 1480, and the xxi year of the\r\n    reign of Edward IV. would agree; and the year of Christ, according\r\n    to our present mode of reckoning, would be 1481. Dr. Dibdin\r\n    assigns to the Mirror the date 1481.--Typ. Ant. i. p. 100.]\r\n\r\nThe “xxvii figures” mentioned by Caxton, without which the work might\r\nnot be easily understood, are chiefly diagrams explanatory of the\r\nprinciples of astronomy and dialling; but besides those twenty-seven\r\ncuts the book contains eleven more, which may be considered as\r\nillustrative rather than explanatory. The following is a list of those\r\neleven cuts in the order in which they occur. They are less than the\r\ncuts in the “Game of Chess;” the most of them not exceeding three inches\r\nand a half by three.[IV-39]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-39: Fac-similes of six of those cuts are given in Dr.\r\n    Dibdin’s edition of Ames’s Typographical Antiquities, vol.\r\n    i. p. 110-112.]\r\n\r\n1. A school-master or “doctor,” gowned, and seated on a high-backed\r\nchair, teaching four youths who are on their knees. 2. A person seated\r\non a low-backed chair, holding in his hand a kind of globe; astronomical\r\ninstruments on a table before him. 3. Christ, or the Godhead, holding in\r\nhis hand a ball and cross. 4. The creation of Eve, who appears coming\r\nout of Adam’s side.--The next cuts are figurative of the “seven arts\r\nliberal.” 5. Grammar. A teacher with a large birch-rod seated on a\r\nchair, his four pupils before him on their knees. 6. Logic. Figure\r\nbare-headed seated on a chair, and having before him a book on a kind of\r\nreading-stand, which he appears expounding to his pupils who are\r\nkneeling. 7. Rhetoric. An upright figure in a gown, to whom another,\r\nkneeling, presents a paper, from which a seal is seen depending.\r\n8. Arithmetic. A figure seated, and having before him a tablet inscribed\r\nwith numerical characters. 9. Geometry. A figure standing, with a pair\r\nof compasses in his hand, with which he seems to be drawing diagrams on\r\na table. 10. Music. A female figure with a sheet of music in her hand,\r\nsinging, and a man playing on the English flute. 11. Astronomy. Figure\r\nwith a kind of quadrant in his hand, who seems to be taking an\r\nobservation.--An idea may be formed of the manner in which those cuts\r\nare engraved from the fac-simile on the next page of No. 10, “Music.”\r\n\r\nThere are wood-cuts in the Golden Legend, 1483; the Fables of Esop,\r\n1484; Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, and other books printed by Caxton; but\r\nit is unnecessary either to enumerate them or to give specimens, as they\r\nare all executed in the same rude manner as the cuts in the Book of\r\nChess and the Mirror of the World. In the Book of Hunting and Hawking\r\nprinted at St. Albans, 1486, there are rude wood-cuts; as also in a\r\nsecond and enlarged edition of the same book printed by Wynkyn de Worde,\r\nCaxton’s successor, at Westminster in 1496. The most considerable\r\nwood-cut printed in England previous to 1500 is, so far as regards the\r\ndesign, a representation of the Crucifixion at the end of the Golden\r\nLegend printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1493.[IV-40] In this cut, neither\r\nof the thieves on each side of Christ appears to be nailed to the cross.\r\nThe arms of the thief on the right of Christ hang behind, and are bound\r\nto the transverse piece of the cross, which passes underneath his\r\nshoulders. His feet are neither bound nor nailed to the cross. The feet\r\nof the thief to the left of Christ are tied to the upright piece of the\r\ncross, to which his hands are also bound, his shoulders resting upon the\r\ntop, and his face turned upward towards the sky. To the left is seen the\r\nVirgin,--who has fallen down,--supported by St. John. In the back-ground\r\nto the right, the artist, like several others of that period, has\r\nrepresented Christ bearing his cross.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nDr. Dibdin, at page 8 of the “Disquisition on the Early State of\r\nEngraving and Ornamental Printing in Great Britain,” prefixed to Ames’s\r\nand Herbert’s Typographical Antiquities, makes the following\r\nobservations on this cut: “The ‘Crucifixion’ at the end of the ‘Golden\r\nLegend’ of 1493, which Wynkyn de Worde has so frequently subjoined to\r\nhis religious pieces, is, unquestionably, the effort of some ingenious\r\nforeign artist. It is not very improbable that Rubens had a recollection\r\nof one of the thieves, twisted, from convulsive agony, round the top of\r\nthe cross, when he executed his celebrated picture of the same\r\nsubject.”[IV-41] In De Worde’s cut, however, it is to be remarked that\r\nthe contorted attitude of both the thieves results rather from the\r\nmanner in which they are bound to the cross, than from the convulsions\r\nof agony.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-40: A large flowered letter, a T, cut on wood, occurs\r\n    on the same page as the Crucifixion.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-41: In a note upon this passage Dr. Dibdin gives the\r\n    following extract from Sir Joshua Reynolds. “To give animation to\r\n    this subject, Rubens has chosen the point of time when an\r\n    executioner is piercing the side of Christ, while another with a\r\n    bar of iron is breaking the limbs of one of the malefactors, who\r\n    in his convulsive agony, which his body admirably expresses, has\r\n    torn one of his feet from the tree to which it was nailed. The\r\n    expression in the action of the figure is wonderful.”]\r\n\r\nAt page 7 of the same Disquisition it is said that the figures in the\r\nGame of Chess, the Mirror of the World, and other works printed by\r\nCaxton “are, in all probability, not the genuine productions of this\r\ncountry; and may be traced to books of an earlier date printed abroad,\r\nfrom which they were often borrowed without acknowledgment or the least\r\nregard to the work in which they again appeared. Caxton, however, has\r\njudiciously taken one of the prints from the ‘Biblia Pauperum’ to\r\nintroduce in his ‘Life of Christ.’ The cuts for his second edition of\r\n‘Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales’ may perhaps safely be considered as the\r\ngenuine invention and execution of a British artist.”\r\n\r\nAlthough I am well aware that the printers of the fifteenth century were\r\naccustomed to copy without acknowledgment the cuts which appeared in\r\neach other’s books, and though I think it likely that Caxton might\r\noccasionally resort to the same practice, yet I am decidedly of opinion\r\nthat the cuts in the “Game of Chess” and the “Mirror of the World” were\r\ndesigned and engraved in this country. Caxton’s Game of Chess is\r\ncertainly the first book of the kind which appeared with wood-cuts in\r\nany country; and I am further of opinion that in no book printed\r\nprevious to 1481 will the presumed originals of the eleven principal\r\ncuts in the Mirror of the World be found. Before we are required to\r\nbelieve that the cuts in those two books were copied from similar\r\ndesigns by some foreign artist, we ought to be informed in what work\r\nsuch originals are to be found. If there be any merit in a first design,\r\nhowever rude, it is but just to assign it to him who first employs the\r\nunknown artist and makes his productions known. Caxton’s claims to the\r\nmerit of “illustrating” the Game of Chess and the Mirror of the World\r\nwith wood-cuts from original designs, I conceive to be indisputable.\r\n\r\nDr. Dibdin, in a long note at pages 33, 34, and 35 of the Typographical\r\nAntiquities, gives a confused account of the earliest editions of books\r\non chess. He mentions as the first, a Latin edition--supposed by\r\nSantander to be the work of Jacobus de Cessolis--in folio, printed about\r\nthe year 1473, by Ketelaer and Leempt. In this edition, however, there\r\nare no cuts, and the date is only conjectural. He says that two editions\r\nof the work of Jacobus de Cessolis on the Morality of Chess, in German\r\nand Italian, with wood-cuts, were printed, without date, in the\r\nfifteenth century, and he adds: “Whether Caxton borrowed the cuts in his\r\nsecond edition from those in the 8vo. German edition without date, or\r\nfrom this latter Italian one, I am not able to ascertain, having seen\r\nneither.” He seems satisfied that Caxton had _borrowed_ the cuts in his\r\nbook of chess, though he is at a loss to discover the party who might\r\nhave them to _lend_. Had he even seen the two editions which he\r\nmentions, he could not have known whether Caxton had borrowed his cuts\r\nfrom them or not until he had ascertained that they were printed\r\npreviously to the English edition. There is a German edition of Jacobus\r\nde Cessolis, in folio, with wood-cuts supposed to be printed in 1477, at\r\nAugsburg, by Gunther Zainer, but both date and printer’s name are\r\nconjectural. The first German edition of this work with wood-cuts, and\r\nhaving a positive date, I believe to be that printed at Strasburg by\r\nHenry Knoblochzer in 1483. Until a work on chess shall be produced of an\r\nearlier date than that ascribed to Caxton’s, and containing similar\r\nwood-cuts, I shall continue to believe that the wood-cuts in the second\r\nEnglish edition of the “Game and Playe of the Chesse” were both designed\r\nand executed by an English artist; and I protest against bibliographers\r\ngoing a-begging with wood-cuts found in old English books, and ascribing\r\nthem to foreign artists, before they have taken the slightest pains to\r\nascertain whether such cuts were executed in England or not.\r\n\r\nThe wood-cuts in the Game of Chess and the Mirror of the World are\r\nequally as good as the wood-cuts which are to be found in books printed\r\nabroad about the same period. They are even decidedly better than those\r\nin Anthony Sorg’s German Bible, Augsburg, 1480, or those in Veldener’s\r\nedition of the Fasciculus Temporum, printed at Utrecht in the same year.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed that most of the wood-cuts which appear in books\r\nprinted by Caxton and De Worde were executed abroad; on the presumption\r\nthat there were at that period no professed wood engravers in England.\r\nAlthough I am inclined to believe that within the fifteenth century\r\nthere were no persons in this country who practised wood engraving as a\r\ndistinct profession, yet it by no means follows from such an admission\r\nthat Caxton’s and De Worde’s cuts must have been engraved by foreign\r\nartists. The manner in which they are executed is so coarse that they\r\nmight be cut by any person who could handle a graver. Looking at them\r\nmerely as specimens of wood engraving, they are not generally superior\r\nto the practice-blocks cut by a modern wood-engraver’s apprentice within\r\nthe first month of his noviciate. I conceive that there would be no\r\ngreater difficulty in finding a person capable of engraving them than\r\nthere would be in finding the pieces of wood on which they were to be\r\nexecuted. Persons who have noticed the embellishments in manuscripts,\r\nthe carving, the monuments, and the stained glass in churches, executed\r\nin England about the time of Caxton, will scarcely suppose that there\r\nwere no artists in this country capable of making the designs for those\r\ncuts. There is in fact reason to believe that in England in the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries the walls of apartments, more\r\nespecially in taverns and hostelries, frequently contained paintings,\r\nmost probably in distemper, of subjects both from sacred and general\r\nhistory. That paintings of sacred subjects were not unusual in churches\r\nat those periods is well known.\r\n\r\nIn most of the cuts which are to be found in books printed by Caxton,\r\nthe effect is produced by the simplest means. The outline of the figures\r\nis coarse and hard, and the shades and folds of the draperies are\r\nindicated by short parallel lines. Cross-hatchings occur in none of\r\nthem, though in one or two I have noticed a few angular dots picked out\r\nof the black part of a cut in order that it might not appear like a mere\r\nblot. The foliage of the trees is generally represented in a manner\r\nsimilar to those in the background of the cut of the knight, of which a\r\ncopy is given at page 193. The oak leaves in a wood-cut[IV-42] at the\r\ncommencement of the preface to the Golden Legend, 1483, are an exception\r\nto the general style of Caxton’s foliage; and represent what they are\r\nintended for with tolerable accuracy. Having thus noticed some of the\r\nearliest books with wood-engravings printed in England, I shall now\r\nresume my account of the progress of the art on the Continent.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-42: A copy of this cut is given at p. 186, vol. i. of\r\n    Dr. Dibdin’s edition of the Typographical Antiquities.]\r\n\r\nIn an edition of Ptolemy’s Cosmography, printed at Ulm in 1482 by\r\nLeonard Holl, we have the first instance of maps engraved on wood. The\r\nwork is in folio, and the number of the maps is twenty-seven. In a\r\ngeneral map of the world the engraver has thus inserted his name at the\r\ntop: “Insculptum est per Johannē Schnitzer de Armssheim.”[IV-43] At the\r\ncorners of this map the winds are represented by heads with puffed-out\r\ncheeks, very indifferently engraved. The work also contains ornamental\r\ninitial letters engraved on wood. In a large one, the letter at the\r\nbeginning of the volume, the translator is represented offering his book\r\nto Pope Paul II. who occupied the see of Rome from 1464 to 1471.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-43: Arnsheim, which is probably the place intended,\r\n    is about twenty miles to the south-west of Mentz.]\r\n\r\nEach map occupies two folio pages, and is printed on the verso of one\r\npage and the recto of the next, in such a manner that when the book is\r\nopen the adjacent pages seem as if printed from one block. What may be\r\nconsidered as the skeleton of each map,--such as indications of rivers\r\nand mountains,--is coarsely cut; but as the names of the places are also\r\nengraved on wood, the execution of those thirty-seven maps must have\r\nbeen a work of considerable labour. In 1486 another edition with the\r\nsame cuts was printed at Ulm by John Regen at the cost of Justus de\r\nAlbano of Venice.\r\n\r\nThe idea of Leonard Holl’s Ptolemy was most likely suggested by an\r\nedition of the same work printed at Rome in 1478 by Arnold Bukinck, the\r\nsuccessor of Conrad Sweinheim. In this edition the maps are printed from\r\nplates of copper; and from the perfect similarity of the letters, as may\r\nbe observed in the names of places, there can be no doubt of their\r\nhaving been stamped upon the plate by means of a punch in a manner\r\nsimilar to that in which a bookbinder impresses the titles at the back\r\nof a volume. It is absolutely impossible that such perfect uniformity in\r\nthe form of the letters could have been obtained, had they been\r\nseparately engraved on the plate by hand. Each single letter is as\r\nperfectly like another of the same character,--the capital M for\r\ninstance,--as types cast by a letter-founder from the same mould. The\r\nnames of the places are all in capitals, but different sizes are used\r\nfor the names of countries and cities. The capitals at the margins\r\nreferring to the degrees of latitude are of very beautiful shape, and as\r\ndelicate as the capitals in modern hair-type.\r\n\r\nAt the back of some of the maps in the copy in the King’s Library at the\r\nBritish Museum, the paper appears as if it had received, when in a damp\r\nstate, an impression from linen cloth. As this appearance of threads\r\ncrossing each other does not proceed from the texture of the paper, but\r\nis evidently the result of pressure, I am inclined to think that it has\r\nbeen occasioned by a piece of linen being placed between the paper and\r\nthe roller when the impressions were taken.\r\n\r\nIn the dedication of the work to the Pope it is stated that this edition\r\nwas prepared by Domitius Calderinus of Verona, who promised to collate\r\nthe Latin version with an ancient Greek manuscript; and that Conrad\r\nSweinheim, who was one of the first who introduced the art of printing\r\nat Rome, undertook, with the assistance of “certain mathematical men,”\r\nwhom he taught, to “impress” the maps upon plates of copper. Sweinheim,\r\nafter having spent three years in preparing these plates, died before\r\nthey were finished; and Arnold Bukinck, a learned German printer,\r\ncompleted the work, “that the emendations of Calderinus,--who also died\r\nbefore the book was printed,--and the results of Sweinheim’s most\r\ningenious mechanical contrivances might not be lost to the learned\r\nworld.”[IV-44]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-44: “Magister vero Conradus Suueynheyn, Germanus,\r\n    a quo formandorum Romæ librorum ars primum profecta est, occasione\r\n    hinc sumpta posteritati consulens animum ad hanc doctrinam\r\n    capessendam applicuit. Subinde mathematicis adhibitis viris\r\n    quemadmodum tabulis eneis imprimerentur edocuit, triennioque in\r\n    hac cura consumpto diem obiit. In cujus vigilarum laborumque\r\n    partem non inferiori ingenio ac studio Arnoldus Buckinck e\r\n    Germania vir apprime eruditus ad imperfectum opus succedens, ne\r\n    Domitii Conradique obitu eorum vigiliæ emendationesque sine\r\n    testimonio perirent neve virorum eruditorum censuram fugerent\r\n    immensæ subtilitatis machinimenta, examussim ad unum\r\n    perfecit.”--Dedication to the Pope, of Ptolemy’s Cosmography,\r\n    Rome, 1478.]\r\n\r\nAn edition of Ptolemy in folio, with the maps engraved on copper, was\r\nprinted at Bologna by Dominico de Lapis with the erroneous date\r\nM.CCCC.LXII. This date is certainly wrong, for no work from the press of\r\nthis printer is known of an earlier date than 1477; and the editor of\r\nthis edition, Philip Beroaldus the elder, was only born in 1450, if not\r\nin 1453. Supposing him to have been born in the former year, he would\r\nonly be twelve years old in 1462. Raidel, who in 1737 published a\r\ndissertation on this edition, thinks that two numerals--XX--had\r\naccidentally been omitted, and that the date ought to be 1482. Breitkopf\r\nthinks that one X might be accidentally omitted in a date and pass\r\nuncorrected, but not two. He rather thinks that the compositor had\r\nplaced an I instead of an L, and that the correct date ought to stand\r\nthus: M CCCC L XLI--1491. I am however of opinion that no instance of\r\nthe Roman numerals, L XLI, being thus combined to express 91, can be\r\nproduced. It seems most probable that the date 1482 assigned by Raidel\r\nis correct; although his opinion respecting the numerals--XX--being\r\naccidentally omitted may be wrong. It is extremely difficult to account\r\nfor the erroneous dates of many books printed previous to 1500. Several\r\nof those dates may have been accidentally wrong set by the compositor,\r\nand overlooked by the corrector; but others are so obvious that it is\r\nlikely they were designedly introduced. The bibliographer who should\r\nundertake to enquire what the printers’ reasons might be for falsifying\r\nthe dates of their books, would be as likely to arrive at the truth, as\r\nhe would be in an enquiry into the reason of their sometimes adding\r\ntheir name, and sometimes omitting it. The execution of the maps in the\r\nedition of De Lapis is much inferior to that of the maps begun by\r\nSweinheim, and finished by Bukinck in 1478.\r\n\r\nBukinck’s edition of Ptolemy, 1478, is the second book which contains\r\nimpressions from copper-plates. Heineken, at page 233, refers to the\r\n“Missale Herbipolense,” folio, 1481, as the first book printed in\r\nGermany containing a specimen of copper-plate engraving. Dr. Dibdin,\r\nhowever, in the 3rd volume of his Tour, page 306, mentions the same work\r\nas having the date of 1479 in the prefatory admonition, and says that\r\nthe plate of a shield of arms--the only one in the volume--is noticed by\r\nBartsch in his “Peintre-Graveur,” vol. x. p. 57. The printer of the\r\nedition of 1481 appears from Heineken to have been George Reyser. In the\r\n“Modus Orandi secundum chorum Herbipolensem,” folio, printed by George\r\nReyser, “Herbipoli,” [at Wurtzburg,] 1485, there is on folio II. a\r\ncopper-plate engraving of the arms of Rudolph de Scherenberg, bishop of\r\nthat see. This plate is also described by Bartsch in his\r\n“Peintre-Graveur,” vol. x. p. 156. The first book which appeared with\r\ncopper-plate engravings is intitled “Il Monte Sancto di Dio,” written by\r\nAntonio Bettini, and printed at Florence in 1477 by Nicolo di Lorenzo\r\ndella Magna. As this book is of extreme rarity, I shall here give an\r\naccount of the plates from Mercier, who first called the attention of\r\nbibliographers to it as being of an earlier date than the folio edition\r\nof Dante, with copper-plate engravings, printed also by Nicolo Lorenzo\r\nin 1481. This edition of Dante was generally supposed to be the first\r\nbook containing copper-plate engravings until Bettini’s work was\r\ndescribed by Mercier.\r\n\r\nThe work called “Il Monte Sancto di Dio” is in quarto, and according to\r\nMercier there ought to be a quire or gathering of four leaves at the\r\ncommencement, containing a summary of the work, which is divided into\r\nthree parts, with a table of the chapters. On the reverse of the last of\r\nthose four leaves is the first plate, which occupies the whole page, and\r\n“measures nine inches and seven-eighths in height, by seven inches in\r\nwidth.”[IV-45] This plate represents the Holy Mountain, on the top of\r\nwhich Christ is seen standing in the midst of adoring angels. A ladder\r\nis placed against this mountain, to which it is fastened with iron\r\nchains, and on each step is engraved the name of a virtue, for instance,\r\nPrudence, Temperance, Fortitude, and others. A figure clothed in a long\r\nrobe, and who appears to be a monk, is seen mounting the ladder. His\r\neyes are directed towards a huge crucifix placed half way up the hill to\r\nthe right of the ladder, and from his mouth there proceeds a label\r\ninscribed with these words: “_Tirami doppo ti_,”--“Draw me up after\r\nthee.” Another figure is seen standing at the foot of the mountain,\r\nlooking towards the top, and uttering these words: “_Levavi oculos meos\r\nin montes_,” &c. The second plate occurs at signature Iv[IV-46] after\r\nthe 115th chapter. It also represents Christ in his glory, surrounded by\r\nangels. It is only four inches and five lines high, by six inches wide,\r\nFrench measure. The third plate, which is the same size as the second,\r\noccurs at signature Pvij, and represents a view of Hell according to the\r\ndescription of Dante. Those plates, which for the period are well enough\r\ndesigned and executed, especially the second, were most likely engraved\r\non copper; and they seem to be by the same hand as those in the edition\r\nof Dante of 1481, from the press of Nicolo di Lorenzo, who also printed\r\nthe work of Bettini.[IV-47] A copy of “Il Monte Sancto di Dio” is in\r\nEarl Spencer’s Library; and a description and specimens of the cuts are\r\ngiven by Dr. Dibdin in the Bibliotheca Spenceriana, vol. iv. p. 30; and\r\nby Mr. Ottley in the Inquiry into the Origin and Early History of\r\nEngraving, vol. i. pp. 375-377.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-45: This is Mr. Ottley’s measurement, taken within\r\n    the black line which bounds the subject. The width as given by\r\n    Mercier does not accord with the above. He says that the plate\r\n    “a neuf pouces et demi de haut sur six de large.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-46: Mr. Ottley says, “on the reverse of signature N\r\n    viij.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-47: “Lettres de M. l’Abbé de St. L***, [St. Léger,\r\n    autrefois le pere Le Mercier, ancien Bibliothecaire de St.\r\n    Genevieve] à M. le Baron de H*** sur différentes Editions rares du\r\n    XV^e. Siécle,” p. 4-5. 8vo. Paris, 1783. A short biographic sketch\r\n    of the Abbé Mercier St. Léger, one of the most eminent French\r\n    Bibliographers of the last century, will be found in Dr. Dibdin’s\r\n    Tour, vol. ii. p. 180.]\r\n\r\nIn the execution of the maps, the copper-plate engraver possesses a\r\ndecided advantage over the engraver on wood, owing to the greater\r\nfacility and clearness with which letters can be cut _in_ copper than\r\n_on_ wood. In the engraving of letters on copper, the artist cuts the\r\nform of the letter _into_ the plate, the character being thus in\r\n_intaglio_; while in engraving on a block, the wood surrounding has to\r\nbe cut away, and the letter left in _relief_. On copper, using only the\r\ngraver,--for etching was not known in the fifteenth century,--as many\r\nletters might be cut in one day as could be cut on wood in three.\r\nNotwithstanding the disadvantage under which the ancient wood engravers\r\nlaboured in the execution of maps, they for many years contended with\r\nthe copper-plate printers for a share of this branch of business; and\r\nthe printers, at whose presses maps engraved on wood only could be\r\nprinted, were well inclined to support the wood engravers. In a folio\r\nedition of Ptolemy, printed at Venice in 1511, by Jacobus Pentius de\r\nLeucho, the outlines of the maps, with the indications of the mountains\r\nand rivers, are cut on wood, and the names of the places are printed in\r\ntype, of different sizes, and with red and black ink. For instance, in\r\nthe map of Britain, which is more correct than any which had previously\r\nappeared, the word “ALBION” is printed in large capitals, and the word\r\n“GADINI” in small capitals, and both with red ink. The words “Curia” and\r\n“Bremenium” are printed in small Roman characters, and with black ink.\r\nThe names of the rivers are also in small Roman, and in black ink. Such\r\nof those maps as contain many names, are almost full of type. The double\r\nborders surrounding them, within which the degrees of latitude are\r\nmarked, appear to have been formed of separate pieces of metal, in the\r\nmanner of wide double rules. At the head of several of the maps there\r\nare figures of animals emblematic of the country. In the first map of\r\nAfrica there are two parrots; in the second an animal like a jackal, and\r\na non-descript; in the third, containing Egypt, a crocodile, and a\r\nmonstrous kind of fish like a dragon; and in the fourth, two parrots. In\r\nthe last, the “curious observer” will note a specimen of decorative\r\nprinting from two blocks of wood; for the beak, wing, and tail of one of\r\nthe parrots is printed in red.\r\n\r\nIn the last map,--of Loraine,--in an edition of Ptolemy, in folio,\r\nprinted at Strasburg in 1513, by John Schott, the attempt to print in\r\ncolours, in the manner of chiaro-scuro wood engravings, is carried yet\r\nfurther. The hills and woods are printed green; the indications of towns\r\nand cities, and the names of the most considerable places, are red;\r\nwhile the names of the smaller places are black. For this map, executed\r\nin three colours, green, red, and black, there would be required two\r\nwood engravings and two forms of type, each of which would have to be\r\nseparately printed. The arms which form a border to the map are printed\r\nin their proper heraldic colours.[IV-48] The only other specimen of\r\narmorial bearings printed in colours from wood-blocks, that I am aware\r\nof, is Earl Spencer’s arms in the first part of Savage’s Hints on\r\nDecorative Printing, which was published in 1818, upwards of three\r\nhundred years after the first essay.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-48: I regret that I have not had an opportunity of\r\n    personally examining this map. There is a copy of Schott’s edition\r\n    in the British Museum; but all the maps, except one of the sphere,\r\n    are taken out. The above account of the map of Loraine is from\r\n    Breitkopf’s interesting essay “Ueber den Druck der Geographischen\r\n    Charten,” S. 7. 4to. Leipzig, 1777.]\r\n\r\nAt a later period a new method was adopted by which the wood engraver\r\nwas spared the trouble of cutting the letters, while the printer was\r\nenabled to obtain a perfect copy of each map by a single impression. The\r\nmode in which this was effected was as follows. The indications of\r\nmountains, rivers, cities, and villages were engraved on the wood as\r\nbefore, and blank spaces were left for the names. Those spaces were\r\nafterwards cut out by means of a chisel or drill, piercing quite through\r\nthe block: and the names of the places being inserted in type, the whole\r\nconstituted only one “form,” from which an impression both of the cut\r\nand the letters could be obtained by its being passed once through the\r\npress. Sebastian Munster’s Cosmography, folio, printed at Basle in 1554,\r\nby Henry Petri, affords several examples of maps executed in this\r\nmanner. This may be considered as one of the last efforts of the old\r\nwood engravers and printers to secure to themselves a share of the\r\nbusiness of map-engraving. Their endeavours, however, were unavailing;\r\nfor within twenty years of that date, this branch of art was almost\r\nexclusively in the hands of the copper-plate engravers. From the date of\r\nthe maps of Ortelius, Antwerp, 1570, engraved on copper by Ægidius\r\nDiest, maps engraved on wood are rarely to be seen. The practice of\r\nengraving the outlines and rivers on wood, and then piercing the block\r\nand inserting the names of the places in type has, however, lately been\r\nrevived; and where publishers are obliged either to print maps with the\r\ntype or to give none at all, this mode may answer very well, more\r\nespecially when the object is to give the relative position of a few of\r\nthe principal places, rather than a crowded list of names. Most of the\r\nlarger maps in the Penny Cyclopædia are executed in this manner. The\r\nholes in the blocks are pierced with the greatest rapidity by gouges of\r\ndifferent sizes acting vertically, and put in motion by machinery\r\ncontrived by Mr. Edward Cowper, to whose great mechanical skill the art\r\nof steam-printing chiefly owes its perfection.\r\n\r\nHaving thus noticed consecutively the progress of map engraving, it may\r\nnot here be out of place to give a brief account of Breitkopf’s\r\nexperiment to print a map with separate pieces of metal in the manner of\r\ntype.[IV-49] Previous to 1776 some attempts had been made by a person\r\nnamed Preusch, of Carlsruhe, to print maps by a process which he named\r\ntypometric, and who published an account of his plan, printed at the\r\npress of Haass the Younger, of Basil. In 1776 Breitkopf sent a\r\ncommunication to Busching’s Journal, containing some remarks on the\r\ninvention of Preusch, and stating that he had conceived a similar plan\r\nupwards of twenty years previously, and that he had actually set up a\r\nspecimen and printed off a few copies, which he had given to his\r\nfriends. The veracity of this account having been questioned by an\r\nilliberal critic, Breitkopf, in 1777, prefixed to his Essay on the\r\nPrinting of Maps a specimen composed of moveable pieces of metal in the\r\nmanner of types. He expressly declares that he considered his experiment\r\na failure; and that he only produced his specimen--a quarto map of the\r\ncountry round Leipsic--in testimony of the truth of what he had\r\npreviously asserted, and to show that two persons might, independently\r\nof each other, conceive an idea of the same invention, although they\r\nmight differ considerably in their mode of carrying it into effect.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-49: The following particulars respecting Breitkopf’s\r\n    invention are derived from his essay “Ueber den Druck der\r\n    Geographischen Charten,” previously referred to.]\r\n\r\nHe was first led to think on the practicability of printing maps with\r\nmoveable pieces of metal by considering that when the letters are\r\nomitted there remain but hills, rivers, and the indications of places;\r\nand for these he was convinced that representations consisting of\r\nmoveable pieces of metal might be contrived. Having, however, made the\r\nexperiment, he felt satisfied that the appearance of such a map was\r\nunpleasing to the eye, and that the invention was not likely to be\r\npractically useful. Had it not been for the publication of Preusch, he\r\nsays that he never would have thought of mentioning his invention,\r\nexcept as a mechanical experiment; and to show that the execution of\r\nmaps in such a manner was within the compass of the printer’s art.\r\n\r\nIn the specimen which he gives, rivers are represented by minute\r\nparallel lines, which are shorter or longer as the river contracts or\r\nexpands; and the junction of the separate pieces may be distinctly\r\nperceived. For hills and trees there are distinct characters\r\nrepresenting those objects. Towns and large villages are distinguished\r\nby a small church, and small villages by a small circle. Roads are\r\nindicated by dotted parallel lines. For the title of the map large\r\ncapitals are used. The name of the city of LEIPSIC is in small capitals.\r\nThe names of towns and villages are in _Italic_; and of woods, rivers,\r\nand hills, in Roman type. The general appearance of the map is\r\nunpleasing to the eye. Breitkopf has displayed his ingenuity by\r\nproducing such a typographic curiosity, and his good sense in abandoning\r\nhis invention when he found that he could not render it useful.\r\n\r\nMr. Ottley, at page 755 of the second volume of his Inquiry, makes the\r\nfollowing remarks on the subject of cross-hatching in wood\r\nengravings:--“It appears anciently to have been the practice of those\r\nmasters who furnished designs for the wood engravers to work from,\r\ncarefully to avoid all cross-hatchings, which, it is probable, were\r\nconsidered beyond the power of the Xylographist to represent. Wolgemuth\r\nperceived that, though difficult, this was not impossible; and in the\r\ncuts of the Nuremberg Chronicle, the execution of which, (besides\r\nfurnishing the designs,) he doubtless superintended, a successful\r\nattempt was first made to imitate the bold hatchings of a pen-drawing,\r\ncrossing each other, as occasion prompted the designer, in various\r\ndirections: to him belongs the praise of having been the first who duly\r\nappreciated the powers of this art.”\r\n\r\nAlthough it is true that cross-hatchings are not to be found in the\r\nearliest wood engravings, yet Mr. Ottley is wrong in assigning this\r\nmaterial improvement in the art to Michael Wolgemuth; for cross-hatching\r\nis introduced in the beautiful cut forming the frontispiece to the Latin\r\nedition of Breydenbach’s Travels, folio, first printed at Mentz, by\r\nErhard Reuwich, in 1486,[IV-50] seven years before the Nuremberg\r\nChronicle appeared. The cut in the following page is a reduced but\r\naccurate copy of Breydenbach’s frontispiece, which is not only the\r\nfinest wood engraving which had appeared up to that date, 1486, but is\r\nin point of design and execution as superior to the best cuts in the\r\nNuremberg Chronicle, as the designs of Albert Durer are to the cuts in\r\nthe oldest editions of the “Poor Preachers’ Bible.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-50: An edition of this work in German, with the same\r\n    cuts, was printed by Reuwich in 1488. Within ten years, at least\r\n    six different editions of this work were printed in Germany. It\r\n    was also translated into Low Dutch, and printed in Holland.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  Philippus de bicken miles]\r\n\r\nIn this cut, cross-hatching may be observed in the drapery of the female\r\nfigure, in the upper part of the two shields on each side of her, in the\r\nborder at the top of the cut, and in other places. Whether the female\r\nfigure be intended as a personification of the city of Mentz, as is\r\nsometimes seen in old books of the sixteenth century, or for St.\r\nCatherine, whose shrine on Mount Sinai was visited by Breydenbach in his\r\ntravels, I shall not pretend to determine. The arms on her right are\r\nBreydenbach’s own; on her left are the arms of John, Count of Solms and\r\nLord of Mintzenberg, and at the bottom of the cut those of Philip de\r\nBicken, knight, who were Breydenbach’s companions to the holy sepulchre\r\nat Jerusalem and the shrine of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai. St.\r\nCatherine, it may be observed, was esteemed the patroness of learned\r\nmen, and her figure was frequently placed in libraries in Catholic\r\ncountries, in the same manner as the bust of Minerva in the libraries of\r\nancient Greece and Rome. The name of the artist by whom the frontispiece\r\nto Breydenbach’s travels was executed is unknown; but I have no\r\nhesitation in declaring him to be one of the best wood engravers of the\r\nperiod. As this is the earliest wood-cut in which I have noticed\r\ncross-hatching, I shall venture to ascribe the merit of the invention to\r\nthe unknown artist, whoever he may have been; and shall consider the\r\ndate 1486 as marking the period when a new style of wood engraving was\r\nintroduced. Wolgemuth, as associated with wood engraving, has too long\r\nbeen decked out with borrowed plumes; and persons who knew little or\r\nnothing either of the history or practice of the art, and who are misled\r\nby writers on whose authority they rely, believe that Michael Wolgemuth\r\nwas not only one of the best wood engravers of his day, but that he was\r\nthe first who introduced a material improvement into the practice of the\r\nart. This error becomes more firmly rooted when such persons come to be\r\ninformed that he was the master of Albert Durer, who is generally, but\r\nerroneously, supposed to have been the best wood engraver of his day.\r\nAlbert Durer studied under Michael Wolgemuth as a painter, and not as a\r\nwood engraver; and I consider it as extremely questionable if either of\r\nthem ever engraved a single block. There are many evidences in Germany\r\nof Wolgemuth having been a tolerably good painter for the age and\r\ncountry in which he lived; but there is not one of his having engraved\r\non wood. In the Nuremberg Chronicle he is represented as having, in\r\nconjunction with William Pleydenwurf, superintended the execution of the\r\nwood-cuts contained in that book. Those cuts, which are frequently\r\nreferred to as excellent specimens of old wood engraving, are in fact\r\nthe most tasteless and worthless things that are to be found in any\r\nbook, ancient or modern. It is a book, however, that is easy to be\r\nobtained; and it serves as a land-mark to superficial enquirers who are\r\nperpetually referring to it as containing wood-cuts designed, if not\r\nengraved, by Albert Durer’s master,--and such, they conclude, must\r\nnecessarily possess a very high degree of excellence.\r\n\r\nBreydenbach was a canon of the cathedral church of Mentz, and he\r\ndedicates the account of his pilgrimage to the Holy Land and visit to\r\nMount Sinai to Berthold, archbishop of that see. The frontispiece,\r\nalthough most deserving of attention as a specimen of wood engraving, is\r\nnot the only cut in the book which is worthy of notice. Views are given,\r\nengraved on wood, of the most remarkable places which he visited;--and\r\nthose of Venice, Corfu, Modon, and the country round Jerusalem, which\r\nare of great length, are inserted in the book as “folding plates.” Each\r\nof the above views is too large to have been engraved on one block. For\r\nthat of Venice, which is about five feet long, and ten inches high,\r\nseveral blocks must have been required, from each of which impressions\r\nwould have to be taken singly, and afterwards pasted together, as is at\r\npresent done in such views as are too wide to be contained on one sheet.\r\nThose views, with respect to the manner in which they are executed, are\r\nsuperior to everything of the same kind which had previously appeared.\r\nThe work also contains smaller cuts printed with the type, which are not\r\ngenerally remarkable for their execution, although some of them are\r\ndrawn and engraved in a free and spirited manner. The following cut is a\r\nreduced copy of that which is prefixed to a chapter intitled “De\r\nSurianis qui Ierosolimis et locis illis manentes etiam se asserunt esse\r\nChristianos:”--\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn a cut of animals there is a figure of a giraffe,[IV-51] named by\r\nBreydenbach “seraffa,” of a unicorn, a salamander, a camel, and an\r\nanimal something like an oran-outang, except that it has a tail. Of the\r\nlast the traveller observes, “non constat de nomine.” Some account of\r\nthis book, with fac-similes of the cuts, will be found in Dibdin’s\r\nBibliotheca Spenceriana, vol iii. pp. 216-228. In the copy there\r\ndescribed, belonging to Earl Spencer, the beautiful frontispiece was\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-51: This is probably the first figure of the giraffe\r\n    that was communicated to the “reading public” of Europe. Its\r\n    existence was afterwards denied by several naturalists; and it is\r\n    only within a comparatively recent period that the existence of\r\n    such an animal was clearly established.]\r\n\r\nAlthough a flowered border surrounding a whole page may be observed as\r\noccurring twice in Veldener’s edition of the Fasciculus Temporum,\r\nprinted at Utrecht in 1480, yet I am inclined to think that the practice\r\nof surrounding every page with an ornamental flowered border cut in\r\nwood, was first introduced by the Parisian printers at a period somewhat\r\nlater. In 1488, an edition of the “Horæ in Laudem beatissimæ virginis\r\nMariæ,” in octavo, was printed at Paris by Anthony Verard, the text of\r\nwhich is surrounded with ornamental borders. The practice thus\r\nintroduced was subsequently adopted by the printers of Germany and\r\nHolland, more especially in the decoration of devotional works, such as\r\nHoræ, Breviaries, and Psalters. Verard appears to have chiefly printed\r\nworks of devotion and love, for a greater number of Horæ and Romances\r\nproceeded from his press than that of any other printer of his age. Most\r\nof them contain wood-cuts, some of which, in books printed by him about\r\nthe beginning of the sixteenth century, are designed with considerable\r\ntaste and well engraved; while others, those for instance in “La Fleur\r\ndes Battailes,” 4to, 1505, are not superior to those in Caxton’s Chess:\r\nit is, however, not unlikely that the cuts in “La Fleur des Battailes”\r\nof this date had been used for an earlier edition.[IV-52]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-52: A good specimen of early French wood engraving\r\n    may be seen in the large cut forming a kind of frontispiece to the\r\n    “Roman du Roy Artus,” folio, printed at Rouen in 1488 by Jehan de\r\n    Bourgeois. This cut, which occupies the whole page, represents\r\n    King Arthur and his knights dining off the round table. A smaller\r\n    one occurs at the beginning of the second part, and both are\r\n    surrounded by ornamental borders.]\r\n\r\nThe “Hortus Sanitatis,” folio, printed at Mentz in 1491 by Jacobus\r\nMeydenbach, is frequently referred to by bibliographers; not so much on\r\naccount of the many wood-cuts which it contains, but as being supposed\r\nin some degree to confirm a statement in Sebastian Munster’s\r\nCosmography, and in Serrarius, De Rebus Moguntinis, where a _John_\r\nMeydenbach is mentioned as being a partner with Gutemberg and Faust. Von\r\nMurr, as has been previously noticed, supposed that this person was a\r\nwood engraver; and Prosper Marchand,[IV-53] though without any\r\nauthority, calls _Jacobus_ Meydenbach his son or his relation.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-53: Hist. de l’Imprimerie, p. 49.]\r\n\r\nThis work, which is a kind of Natural History, explaining the uses and\r\nvirtues of herbs, fowls, fish, quadrupeds, minerals, drugs, and spices,\r\ncontains a number of wood-cuts, many of which are curious, as containing\r\nrepresentations of natural objects, but none of which are remarkable for\r\ntheir execution as wood engravings. On the opposite page is a fac-simile\r\nof the cut which forms the head-piece to the chapter “De Ovis.” The\r\nfigure, which possesses considerable merit, represents an old woman\r\ngoing to market with her basket of eggs.\r\n\r\nThis is a fair specimen of the manner in which the cuts in the Hortus\r\nSanitatis are designed and executed. Among the most curious and best\r\ndesigned are: the interior of an apothecary’s shop, on the reverse of\r\nthe first leaf; a monkey seated on the top of a fountain, in the chapter\r\non water; a butcher cutting up meat; a man selling cheese at a stall;\r\na woman milking a cow; and figures of the male and female mandrake. At\r\nchapter 119, “De Pediculo,” a woman is represented brushing the head of\r\na boy with a peculiar kind of brush, which answers the purpose of a\r\nsmall-toothed comb; and she appears to bestow her labour on no infertile\r\nfield, for each of her “sweepings,” which are seen lying on the floor,\r\nwould scarcely slip through the teeth of a garden rake. Meydenbach’s\r\nedition has been supposed to be the first; and Linnæus, in the\r\nBibliotheca Botanica, has ascribed the work to one John Cuba,\r\na physician of Mentz; but other writers have doubted if this person were\r\nreally the author. The first edition of this work, under the title of\r\n“Herbarus,” with a hundred and fifty wood-cuts, was printed at Mentz by\r\nPeter Scheffer in 1484; and in 1485 he printed an enlarged edition in\r\nGerman, containing three hundred and eighty cuts, under the title of\r\n“Ortus Sanitatis oder Garten der Gesundheit.” Of the work printed by\r\nScheffer, Breydenbach is said to have been one of the compilers. Several\r\neditions of the Hortus Sanitatis were subsequently printed, not only in\r\nGermany, but in France, Holland, and Switzerland.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nHaving previously expressed my opinion respecting the wood-cuts in the\r\nNuremberg Chronicle, there will be less occasion to give a detailed\r\naccount of the book and the rubbish it contains here: in speaking thus\r\nit may perhaps be necessary to say that this character is meant to apply\r\nto the wood-cuts and not to the literary portion of the work, which\r\nThomas Hearne, of black-letter memory, pronounces to be extremely\r\n“pleasant, useful, and curious.” With the wood-cuts the Rev. Dr. Dibdin\r\nappears to have been equally charmed.\r\n\r\nThe work called the “Nuremberg Chronicle” is a folio, compiled by\r\nHartman Schedel, a physician of Nuremberg, and printed in that city by\r\nAnthony Koburger in 1493. In the colophon it is stated that the views of\r\ncities, and figures of eminent characters, were executed under the\r\nsuperintendence of Michael Wolgemuth and William Pleydenwurff,\r\n“mathematical men”[IV-54] and skilled in the art of painting. The total\r\nnumber of impressions contained in the work exceeds two thousand, but\r\nseveral of the cuts are repeated eight or ten times. The following\r\nfac-simile will afford an idea of the style in which the portraits of\r\nillustrious men contained in this often-cited chronicle are executed.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-54: The expression “adhibitis tamen viris\r\n    mathematicis” in the Nuremberg Chronicle, is evidently borrowed\r\n    from that,--“subinde mathematicis adhibitis viris,”--in the\r\n    dedication of Bukinck’s Ptolemy, 1478, to the Pope. “Mathematical\r\n    men,” in the present sense of the term, might be required to\r\n    construct the maps in the edition of Ptolemy, but scarcely to\r\n    design or engrave the vulgar figures and worthless views in the\r\n    Nuremberg Chronicle.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe above head, which the owner appears to be scratching with so much\r\nearnestness, first occurs as that of Paris the lover of Helen; and it is\r\nafterwards repeated as that of Thales, Anastasius, Odofredus, and the\r\npoet Dante. In a like manner the economical printer has a stock-head for\r\nkings and emperors; another for popes; a third for bishops; a fourth for\r\nsaints, and so on. Several cuts representing what might be supposed to\r\nbe particular events are in the same manner pressed into the general\r\nservice of the chronicler.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of the cuts in the Nuremberg Chronicle is that they\r\ngenerally contain more of what engravers term “colour” than any which\r\nhad previously appeared. Before proceeding, however, to make any further\r\nobservations on these cuts, I shall endeavour to explain what engravers\r\nmean by the term “colour,” as applied to an impression taken with black\r\nink from a copper-plate or a wood-block.\r\n\r\nThough there is no “colour,” strictly speaking, in an engraving\r\nconsisting merely of black and white lines, yet the term is often\r\nconventionally applied to an engraving which is supposed, from the\r\nvaried character of its lines and the contrast of light and shade, to\r\nconvey the idea of varied local colour as seen in a painting or a\r\nwater-colour drawing. For instance, an engraving is said to contain much\r\n“colour” which appears clearly to indicate not only a variety of colour,\r\nbut also its different degrees of intensity in the several objects, and\r\nwhich at the same time presents an effective combination of light and\r\nshade. An engraver cannot certainly express the difference between green\r\nand yellow, or red and orange, yet in engraving a figure, say that of a\r\ncavalier by Vandyke, with brown leather boots, buff-coloured woollen\r\nhose, doublet of red silk, and blue velvet cloak, a master of his art\r\nwill not only express a difference in the texture, but will also convey\r\nan idea of the different parts of the dress being of different colours.\r\nThe Rent Day, engraved by Raimbach from a painting by Wilkie, and\r\nChelsea Pensioners hearing the Gazette of the Battle of Waterloo read,\r\nengraved by Burnet from a picture by the same artist, may be instanced\r\nas copper-plate engravings which contain much “colour.”\r\n\r\nMr. Landseer, at pages 175, 176, of his Lectures on Engraving, makes the\r\nfollowing remarks on the term “colour,” as conventionally applied by\r\nengravers in speaking of impressions from plates or from\r\nwood-blocks:--“It is not uncommon among print-publishers, nor even\r\namongst engravers themselves, to hear the word COLOUR mistakenly\r\nemployed to signify _shade_; so that if they think an engraving too\r\ndark, they say it has too much _colour_, too little colour if too\r\nlight--and so forth. The same ignorance which has hitherto reigned over\r\nthe pursuits of this Art, has here imposed its authority, and with the\r\nsame unfortunate success: I cannot however yield to it the same\r\nsubmission, since it is not only a palpable misuse of a word, but would\r\nlead to endless confusion when I come to explain to you my ideas of the\r\nmeans the Art of engraving possesses of rendering local colour in the\r\nabstract. Wherefore, whenever I may use the term _colour_, I mean it in\r\nno other than its ordinary acceptation.”\r\n\r\n“By MIDDLE TINT, I understand and mean, ‘the medium between strong light\r\nand strong shade.’--These are Mr. Gilpin’s words; and he adds, with a\r\npropriety that confers value on the definition--‘the phrase is _not at\r\nall_ expressive of colour.’”\r\n\r\nWhether we owe the term “colour,” as applied to engravings, to the\r\nignorance of printsellers or not, I shall not inquire; I only know that\r\na number of terms equally objectionable, if their primitive meaning be\r\nconsidered, are used in speaking of the arts of painting and engraving\r\nby persons who are certainly not ignorant. We have the words _high_ and\r\n_deep_, which strictly relate to objects of lineal altitude or\r\nprofundity, applied to denote intensity of colour; and the very word\r\n_intensity_, when thus applied, is only relative; the speaker being\r\nunable to find a word directly expressive of his meaning, explains\r\nhimself by referring to some object or thing previously known, as, in\r\nthis instance, by reference to the _tension_ of a string or cord. The\r\nword _tone_, which is so frequently used in speaking of pictures, is\r\nderived from the sister art of music. I presume that none of these terms\r\nwere introduced into the nomenclature of painting and engraving by\r\nignorant persons, but that they were adopted from a necessity\r\noriginating from the very constitution of the human mind. It is well\r\nknown to every person who has paid any attention to the construction of\r\nlanguages, that almost every abstract term is referable to, and derived\r\nfrom, the name of some material object. The very word to “think,”\r\nimplying the exercise of our mental faculties, is probably an offset\r\nfrom the substantive “thing.”\r\n\r\nIt is also to be observed, that Mr. Landseer speaks as if the term\r\n_colour_ was used by ignorant printsellers, and of course ignorant\r\nengravers, to signify _shade_ only. It is, however, used by them to\r\nsignify that there is a considerable proportion of dark lines and\r\nhatchings in an engraving, although such lines and hatchings are not\r\nexpressive of shade, but merely indicative of deep colours. Dark brown,\r\nred, and purple, for instance, even when receiving direct rays of light,\r\nwould naturally contain much conventional “colour” in an engraving; and\r\nso would a bay horse, a coal barge, or the trunk of an old oak tree,\r\nwhen receiving the light in a similar manner; all would be represented\r\nas comparatively dark, when contrasted with lighter coloured\r\nobjects,--for instance, with a blue sky, grass, or light green\r\nfoliage,--although not in shade. An engraving that appears too light,\r\ncompared with the painting from which it is copied, is said to want\r\n“colour,” and the copper-plate engraver remedies the defect by\r\nthickening the dark lines, or by adding cross lines and hatchings. As a\r\ncopper-plate engraver can always obtain more “colour,” he generally\r\nkeeps his work light in the first stage of a plate; on the contrary,\r\na wood engraver keeps his first proof dark, as he cannot afterwards\r\nintroduce more “colour,” or give to an object a greater depth of shade.\r\nA wood engraver can make his lines thinner if they be too thick, and\r\nthus cause his subject to appear lighter; but if he has made them too\r\nfine at first, and more colour be wanted, it is not in his power to\r\nremedy the defect.\r\n\r\nWhat Mr. Landseer’s ideas may be of the “means [which] the art of\r\nengraving possesses of rendering local colour in the abstract,” I cannot\r\nvery well comprehend. I am aware of the lines used conventionally by\r\nengravers to indicate heraldic colours in coat-armour; but I can see no\r\nnatural relation between perpendicular lines in an engraving and the red\r\ncolour of a soldier’s coat. I believe that no person could tell the\r\ncolour of the draperies in Leonardo da Vinci’s Last Supper from an\r\ninspection of Raphael Morghen’s engraving of it. When Mr. Landseer says\r\nthat he will use the term “colour” in its “ordinary acceptation,” he\r\nought to have explained what the ordinary acceptation of the word meant\r\nwhen applied to impressions from copper-plates which consist of nothing\r\nbut lines and interstices of black and white.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the second paragraph Mr. Landseer displays great inconsistency in\r\npraising Mr. Gilpin for his definition of the word “tint,” which, when\r\napplied to engravings, is as objectionable as the term “colour.” It\r\nappears that Mr. Gilpin may employ a conventional term with “singular\r\npropriety,” while printsellers and engravers who should use the same\r\nliberty would be charged with ignorance. Is there such a thing as a\r\n_tint_ in nature which is of no colour? Mr. Gilpin’s lauded definition\r\ninvolves a contradiction even when the word is applied to engravings, in\r\nwhich every “tint” is indicative of positive colour. That “medium\r\nbetween strong light and strong shade,” and which is yet of no colour,\r\nremains to be discovered. Mr. Gilpin has supplied us with the “word,”\r\nbut it appears that no definite idea is necessary to be attached to it.\r\nHaving thus endeavoured to give a little brightness to the “colour” of\r\n“ignorant printsellers and engravers,” I shall resume my observations on\r\nthe cuts in the Nuremberg Chronicle, to the “colour” of which the\r\npreceding digression is to be ascribed.\r\n\r\nThe preceding cut, representing the Creation of Eve, is copied from one\r\nof the best in the Nuremberg Chronicle, both with respect to design and\r\nengraving. In this, compared with most other cuts previously executed,\r\nmuch more colour will be perceived, which results from the closeness of\r\nthe single lines, as in the dark parts of the rock immediately behind\r\nthe figure of Eve; from the introduction of dark lines crossing each\r\nother,--called “cross-hatching,”--as may be seen in the drapery of the\r\nDivinity; and from the contrast of the shade thus produced with the\r\nlighter parts of the cut.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe subjoined cut, of the same subject, copied from the Poor Preachers’\r\nBible,[IV-55] will, by comparison with the preceding, illustrate more\r\nclearly than any verbal explanation the difference with respect to\r\ncolour between the wood-cuts in the old block-books and in most others\r\nprinted between 1462 and 1493, and those contained in the Nuremberg\r\nChronicle. In this cut there is no indication of colour; the shades in\r\nthe drapery which are expressed by hard parallel lines are all of equal\r\nstrength, or rather weakness; and the hair of Adam’s head and the\r\nfoliage of the tree are expressed nearly in the same manner.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-55: In the original, this cut, with one of Christ’s\r\n    side pierced by a soldier, and another of Moses striking the rock,\r\n    are intended to illustrate the mystery of the Sacrament of the\r\n    Lord’s Supper.]\r\n\r\nThis manner of representing the creation of Eve appears to have been\r\ngeneral amongst the wood engravers of the fifteenth century, for the\r\nsame subject frequently occurs in old cuts executed previous to 1500. It\r\nis frequently represented in the same manner in illuminated missals; and\r\nin Flaxman’s Lectures on Sculpture a lithographic print is given, copied\r\nfrom an ancient piece of sculpture in Wells Cathedral, where Eve is seen\r\nthus proceeding from the side of Adam. In a picture by Raffaele the\r\ncreation of Eve is also represented in the same manner.\r\n\r\nIn the wood-cuts which occur in Italian books printed previous to 1500\r\nthe engravers have seldom attempted anything beyond a simple outline\r\nwith occasionally an indication of shade, or of colour, by means of\r\nshort parallel lines. The following is a fac-simile of a cut in\r\nBonsignore’s Italian prose translation of Ovid’s Metamorphoses, folio,\r\nprinted at Venice by the brothers De Lignano in 1497. It may serve at\r\nonce as a specimen of the other cuts contained in the work and of the\r\ngeneral style of engraving on wood in Italy for about ten years\r\npreceding that period.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe subject illustrated is the difficult labour of Alcmena through the\r\nmalign influence of Lucina, as related by Ovid in the IXth book of the\r\nMetamorphoses, from verse 295 to 314. This would appear to have been\r\nrather a favourite subject with designers, for it is again selected for\r\nillustration in Ludovico Dolce’s Transformationi, a kind of paraphrase\r\nof the Metamorphoses, 4to, printed at Venice by Gabriel Giolito in 1557;\r\nand it is also represented in the illustrations to the Metamorphoses\r\ndesigned by Virgil Solis, and printed at Frankfort, in oblong 4to, by\r\nGeorge Corvinus and Sigismund Feyrabent, in 1569.[IV-56]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-56: Mr. Ottley in speaking of an edition of the\r\n    Metamorphoses printed at Venice in 1509, with wood-cuts, mentions\r\n    one of them as representing the “Birth of Hercules,” which is\r\n    probably treated in a manner similar to those above noticed. Mr.\r\n    Ottley also states that he had discovered the artist to be\r\n    Benedetto Montagna, who also engraved on copper.--Inquiry, vol. ii\r\n    p. 576.]\r\n\r\nOf all the wood-cuts executed in Italy within the fifteenth century\r\nthere are none that can bear a comparison for elegance of design with\r\nthose contained in an Italian work entitled “Hypnerotomachia Poliphili,”\r\na folio without printer’s name or place, but certainly printed at Venice\r\nby Aldus in 1499. This “Contest between Imagination and Love, by a\r\ngeneral Lover,”--for such seems to be the import of the title,--is an\r\nobscure medley of fable, history, antiquities, mathematics, and various\r\nother matters, highly seasoned with erotic sketches[IV-57] suggested by\r\nthe prurient imagination of a monk,--for such the author was,--who, like\r\nmany others of his fraternity, in all ages, appears to have had “a _law_\r\nnot to marry, and a _custom_ not to live chaste.” The language in which\r\nthis chaos of absurdities is composed is almost as varied as the\r\nsubjects. The ground-work is Italian, on which the author engrafts at\r\nwill whole phrases of Latin, with a number of words borrowed from the\r\nGreek, Hebrew, Arabic, and Chaldee. “Certain persons,” says Tiraboschi,\r\n“who admire a work the more the less they understand it, have fancied\r\nthat they could perceive in the Hypnerotomachia a complete summary of\r\nhuman knowledge.”[IV-58]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-57: Bibliographers and booksellers in their\r\n    catalogues specify with delight such copies as contain “la figura\r\n    rappresentante il Sacrifizio à Priapo bene conservata,” for in\r\n    some copies this choice subject is wanting, and in others\r\n    partially defaced.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-58: Some account of the Hypnerotomachia and its\r\n    author is to be found in Prosper Marchand’s Dictionnaire\r\n    Historique.]\r\n\r\nThe name of the author was Francis Colonna, who was born at Venice, and\r\nat an early age became a monk of the order of St. Dominic. In 1467 he\r\nprofessed Grammar and Classical Literature in the convent of his order\r\nat Trevisa; and he afterwards became Professor of Theology at Padua,\r\nwhere he commenced Doctor in 1473, a degree which, according to the rule\r\nof his order, he could not assume until he was forty. At the time of his\r\ndeath, which happened in 1527, he could not thus be less than\r\nninety-four years old. The true name of this amorous dreaming monk, and\r\nthe fictitious one of the woman with whom he was in love, are thus\r\nexpressed by combining, in the order in which they follow each other,\r\nthe initial letters of the several chapters: “POLIAM FRATER FRANSISCUS\r\nCOLUMNA PERAMAVIT.”[IV-59] If any reliance can be placed on the text and\r\nthe cuts as narrating and representing real incidents, we may gather\r\nthat the stream of love had not run smooth with father Francis any more\r\nthan with simple laymen. With respect to the true name of the mistress\r\nof father Francis, biographers are not agreed. One says that her name\r\nwas Lucretia Maura; and another that her name was Ippolita, and that she\r\nbelonged to the noble family of Poli, of Trevisa, and that she was a nun\r\nin that city. From the name Ippolita some authors thus derive the\r\nfictitious name Polia: Ippolita; Polita; Polia.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-59: In the life of Colonna in the Biographie\r\n    Universelle, the last word is said to be “_adamavit_,” which is a\r\n    mistake. The word formed by the initial letters of the nine last\r\n    chapters is “_peramavit_,” as above.]\r\n\r\nA second edition, also from the Aldine press, appeared in 1545; and in\r\nthe following year a French translation was printed at Paris under the\r\nfollowing title: “Le Tableau des riches inventions couvertes du voile\r\ndes feintes amourouses qui sont representées dans le Songe de Poliphile,\r\ndevoilées des ombres du Songe, et subtilment exposées.” Of this\r\ntranslation several editions were published; and in 1804 J. G. Legrand,\r\nan architect of some repute in Paris, printed a kind of paraphrase of\r\nthe work, in two volumes 12mo, which, however, was not published until\r\nafter his death in 1807. In 1811 Bodoni reprinted the original work at\r\nParma in an elegant quarto volume.\r\n\r\nIn the original work the wood-cuts with respect to design may rank among\r\nthe best that have appeared in Italy. The whole number in the volume is\r\none hundred and ninety-two; of which eighty-six relate to mythology and\r\nancient history; fifty-four represent processions and emblematic\r\nfigures: there are thirty-six architectural and ornamental subjects; and\r\nsixteen vases and statues. Several writers have asserted that those cuts\r\nwere designed by Raffaele,[IV-60] while others with equal confidence,\r\nthough on no better grounds, have ascribed them to Andrea Mantegna.\r\nExcept from the resemblance which they are supposed to bear to the\r\nacknowledged works of those artists, I am not aware that there is any\r\nreason to suppose that they were designed by either of them. As\r\nRaffaele, who was born in 1483, was only sixteen when the\r\nHypnerotomachia was printed, it is not likely that all, or even any of\r\nthose cuts were designed by him; as it is highly probable that all the\r\ndrawings would be finished at least twelve months before, and many of\r\nthem contain internal evidence of their not being the productions of a\r\nyouth of fifteen. That Andrea Mantegna might design them is possible;\r\nbut this certainly cannot be a sufficient reason for positively\r\nasserting that he actually did. Mr. Ottley, at page 576, vol. ii, of his\r\nInquiry, asserts that they were designed by Benedetto Montagna, an\r\nartist who flourished about the year 1500, and who is chiefly known as\r\nan engraver on copper. The grounds on which Mr. Ottley forms his opinion\r\nare not very clear, but if I understand him correctly they are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-60: Heineken, in his catalogue of Raffaele’s works,\r\n    mentions the cuts in the Hypnerotomachia, but he says that it is\r\n    questionable whether he designed them all or only the eighty-six\r\n    mythological and historical subjects.--Nachrichten von Künstlern\r\n    und Kunst-Sachen, 2er Theil, S. 360. 8vo. Leipzig, 1769.]\r\n\r\nIn the collection of the late Mr. Douce there were sixteen wood\r\nengravings which had been cut out of a folio edition of Ovid’s\r\nMetamorphoses, printed at Venice in 1509. All those engravings, except\r\ntwo, were marked with the letters +ía+, which according to Mr. Ottley\r\nare the initials of the engraver, Ioanne Andrea di Vavassori. Between\r\nsome of the cuts from the Ovid, and certain engravings executed by\r\nMontagna, it seems that Mr. Ottley discovered a resemblance; and as he\r\nthought that he perceived a perfect similarity between the sixteen cuts\r\nfrom the Ovid and those contained in the Hypnerotomachia, he considers\r\nthat Benedetto Montagna is thus proved to have been the designer of the\r\ncuts in the latter work.\r\n\r\nNot having seen the cuts in the edition of the Metamorphoses of 1509,\r\nI cannot speak, from my own examination, of the resemblance between them\r\nand those in the Hypnerotomachia; it, however, seems that Mr. Douce had\r\nnoticed the similarity as well as Mr. Ottley: but even admitting that\r\nthere is a perfect identity of style in the cuts of the above two works,\r\nyet it by no means follows that, because a few of the cuts in the Ovid\r\nresemble some copper-plate engravings executed by Benedetto Montagna, he\r\nmust have designed the cuts in the Hypnerotomachia. As the cuts in the\r\nOvid may, as Mr. Ottley himself remarks, have been used in an earlier\r\nedition than that of 1509, it is not unlikely that they might appear\r\nbefore Montagna’s copper-plates; and that the latter might copy the\r\ndesigns of a greater artist than himself, and thus by his very\r\nplagiarism acquire, according to Mr. Ottley’s train of reasoning, the\r\nmerit which may be justly due to another. If Benedetto Montagna be\r\nreally the designer of the cuts in the Hypnerotomachia, he has certainly\r\nexcelled himself, for they certainly display talent of a much higher\r\norder than is to be perceived in his copper-plate engravings. Besides\r\nthe striking difference with respect to drawing between the wood-cuts in\r\nPoliphilo[IV-61] and the engravings of Benedetto Montagna, two of the\r\ncuts in the former work have a mark which never appears in any of that\r\nartist’s known productions, which generally have either his name at\r\nlength or the letters B. M. In the third cut of Poliphilo, the\r\ndesigner’s or engraver’s mark, a small b, may be perceived at the foot,\r\nto the right; and the same mark is repeated in a cut at signature C.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-61: The author thus names his hero in his Italian\r\n    title: “_Poliphilo_ incomincia la sua hypnerotomachia ad\r\n    descrivere et l’hora et il tempo quando gli appar ve in somno,\r\n    &c.”]\r\n\r\nA London bookseller in his catalogue published in 1834, probably\r\nspeaking on Mr. Ottley’s hint that the cuts in the Ovid of 1509 might\r\nhave appeared in an earlier edition, thus describes Bonsignore’s Ovid,\r\na work in which the wood-cuts are of a very inferior description, and of\r\nwhich a specimen is given in a preceding page: “Ovidii Metamorphoseos\r\nVulgare, con le Allegorie, [Venezia, 1497,] with numerous beautiful\r\nwood-cuts, apparently by the artist who executed the Poliphilo, printed\r\nby Aldus in 1499.” The wood-cuts in the Ovid of 1497 are as inferior to\r\nthose in Poliphilo as the commonest cuts in children’s school-books are\r\ninferior to the beautiful wood-cuts in Rogers’s Pleasures of Memory,\r\nprinted in 1812, which were designed by Stothard and engraved by\r\nClennell. It is but fair to add, that the cuts used in the Ovid of 1497,\r\nprinted by the brothers De Lignano, cannot be the same as those in the\r\nOvid of 1509 referred to by Mr. Ottley; for though the subjects may be\r\nnearly the same, the cuts in the latter edition are larger than those in\r\nthe former, and have besides an engraver’s mark which is not to be seen\r\nin any of the cuts in the edition of 1497.\r\n\r\nThe five following cuts are fac-similes traced line for line from the\r\noriginals in Poliphilo. In the first, Mercury is seen interfering to\r\nsave Cupid from the anger of Venus, who has been punishing him and\r\nplucking the feathers from his wings. The cause of her anger is\r\nexplained by the figure of Mars behind the net in which he and Venus had\r\nbeen inclosed by Vulcan. Love had been the cause of his mother’s\r\nmisfortune.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the following cut Cupid is represented as brought by Mercury before\r\nJove, who in the text, “in Athica lingua,” addresses the God of Love, as\r\n“ΣΥΜΟΙΓΛΥΚΥΣ ΚΑΙ ΠΙΚΡΟΣ”--“at once sweet and bitter.” In the\r\ninscription in the cut, “ΑΛΛΑ” is substituted for “ΚΑΙ.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the next cut Cupid appears piercing the sky with a dart, and thus\r\ncausing a shower of gold to fall. The figures represent persons of all\r\nconditions whom he has wounded, looking on with amazement.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe three preceding cuts, in the original work, appear as compartments\r\nfrom left to right on one block. They are here given separate for the\r\nconvenience of printing, as the page is not wide enough to allow of\r\ntheir being placed as in the original folio.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe subjoined cut is intended to represent Autumn, according to a\r\ndescription of the figure in the text, where the author is speaking of\r\nan altar to be erected to the four seasons. On one of the sides he\r\nproposes that the following figure should be represented “with a jolly\r\ncountenance, crowned with vine leaves, holding in one hand a bunch of\r\ngrapes, and in the other a cornucopia, with an inscription: ‘MUSTULENTO\r\nAUTUMNO S.’”[IV-62] The face of jolly Autumn is indeed like that of one\r\nwho loved new wine, and his body seems like an ample skin to keep the\r\nliquor in;--Sir John Falstaff playing Bacchus ere he had grown old and\r\ninordinately fat.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-62: The epithets applied to the different seasons as\r\n    represented on this votive altar are singularly beautiful and\r\n    appropriate: “Florido Veri; Flavæ Messi; Mustulento Autumno; Hyemi\r\n    Æoliæ, Sacrum.”]\r\n\r\nThe following figure of Cupid is copied from the top of a fanciful\r\nmilitary standard described by the author; and on a kind of banner\r\nbeneath the figure is inscribed the word “ΔΟΡΙΚΤΗΤΟΙ”--“Gained in war.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe following is a specimen of one of the ornamental vases contained in\r\nthe work. It is not, like the five preceding cuts, of the same size as\r\nthe original, but is copied on a reduced scale.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe simple style in which the cuts in the Hypnerotomachia are engraved,\r\ncontinued to prevail, with certain modifications, in Italy for many\r\nyears after the method of cross-hatching became general in Germany; and\r\nfrom 1500 to about 1530 the characteristic of most Italian wood-cuts is\r\nthe simple manner in which they are executed compared with the more\r\nlaboured productions of the German wood engravers. While the German\r\nproceeds with considerable labour to obtain “colour,” or shade, by means\r\nof cross-hatching, the Italian in the early part of the sixteenth\r\ncentury endeavours to attain his object by easier means, such as leaving\r\nhis lines thicker in certain parts, and in others, indicating shade by\r\nmeans of short slanting parallel lines. In the execution of flowered or\r\nornamented initial letters a decided difference may frequently be\r\nnoticed between the work of an Italian and a German artist. The German\r\nmostly, with considerable trouble, cuts his flourishes, figures, and\r\nflowers in relief, according to the general practice of wood engravers;\r\nthe Italian, on the contrary, often cuts them, with much greater ease,\r\nin _intaglio_; and thus the form of the letter, and its ornaments,\r\nappear, when printed, white upon a black ground.[IV-63] The letter C at\r\nthe commencement of the present chapter is an example of the German\r\nstyle, with the ornamental parts in _relief_; the letter M at the\r\ncommencement of chapter V. is a specimen of the manner frequently\r\nadopted by old Italian wood engravers, the form of the letter and the\r\nornamental foliage being cut in _intaglio_. At a subsequent period a\r\nmore elaborate manner of engraving began to prevail in Italy, and\r\ncross-hatching was almost as generally employed to obtain depth of\r\ncolour and shade as in Germany. The wood-cuts which appear in works\r\nprinted at Venice between 1550 and 1570 are generally as good as most\r\nGerman wood-cuts of the same period; and many of them, more especially\r\nthose in books printed by the Giolitos, are executed with a clearness\r\nand delicacy which have seldom been surpassed.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-63: The letter M at the commencement of the next\r\n    chapter affords an example of this style of engraving.]\r\n\r\nBefore concluding the present chapter, which is more especially devoted\r\nto the consideration of wood engraving in the first period of its\r\nconnexion with typography, it may not be improper to take a brief glance\r\nat the state of the art as practised by the Briefmalers and\r\nFormschneiders of Germany, who were the first to introduce the practice\r\nof block-printing, and who continued to exercise this branch of their\r\nart for many years after typography had been generally established\r\nthroughout Europe. That the ancient wood engravers continued to practise\r\nthe art of block-printing till towards the close of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, there can be little doubt. There is an edition of the Poor\r\nPreachers’ Bible, with the date 1470, printed from wood-blocks, without\r\nplace or engraver’s name, but having at the end, as a mark, two shields,\r\non one of which is a squirrel, and on the other something like two\r\npilgrim’s staves crossed. Another edition of the same work, though not\r\nfrom the same blocks, appeared in 1471. In this the engraver’s mark is\r\ntwo shields, on one of which is a spur, probably a rebus for the name of\r\n“Sporer;” in the same manner that a pair of folding-doors represented\r\nthe name “Thurer,” or “Durer.” An engraver of the name of Hans Sporer\r\nprinted an edition of the Ars Moriendi from wood-blocks in 1473; and in\r\nthe preceding year Young Hans, Briefmaler, of Nuremberg, printed an\r\nedition of the Antichrist in the same manner.[IV-64]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-64: Von Murr says that “Young Hans” was\r\n    unquestionably the son of “Hans Formschneider,” whose name appears\r\n    in the town-books of Nuremberg from 1449 to 1490. He also thinks\r\n    that he might be the same person as Hans Sporer.--Journal,\r\n    2 Theil, S. 140, 141.]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that most of the single sheets and short tracts, printed\r\nfrom wood-blocks, preserved in the libraries of Germany, were printed\r\nbetween 1440 and 1480. Books consisting of two or more sheets printed\r\nfrom wood-blocks are of rare occurrence with a date subsequent to 1480.\r\nAlthough about that period the wood engravers appear to have resigned\r\nthe printing of books entirely to typographers, yet for several years\r\nafterwards they continued to print broadsides from blocks of wood; and\r\nuntil about 1500 they continued to compete with the press for the\r\nprinting of “Wand-Kalendars,” or sheet Almanacks to be hung up against a\r\nwall. Several copies of such Almanacks, engraved between 1470 and 1500,\r\nare preserved in libraries on the Continent that are rich in specimens\r\nof early block-printing. But even this branch of their business the wood\r\nengravers were at length obliged to abandon; and at the end of the\r\nfifteenth century the practice of printing pages of text from engraved\r\nwood-blocks may be considered as almost extinct in Germany. It probably\r\nbegan with a single sheet, and with a single sheet it ended; and its\r\norigin, perfection, decline, and extinction are comprised within a\r\ncentury. 1430 may mark its origin; 1450 its perfection; 1460 the\r\ncommencement of its decline; and 1500 its fall.\r\n\r\nIn an assemblage of wood engravings printed at Gotha between 1808 and\r\n1816,[IV-65] from old blocks collected by the Baron Von Derschau, there\r\nare several to which the editor, Zacharias Becker, assigns an earlier\r\ndate than the year 1500. It is not unlikely that two or three of those\r\nin his oldest class, A, may have been executed previous to that period;\r\nbut there are others in which bad drawing and rude engraving have been\r\nmistaken for indubitable proofs of antiquity. There are also two or\r\nthree in the same class which I strongly suspect to be modern forgeries.\r\nIt would appear from a circumstance mentioned in Dr. Dibdin’s\r\nBibliographical Tour,[IV-66] and referred to at page 236 of the present\r\nwork, that the Baron was a person from whose collection copper-plate\r\nengravings of questionable date had proceeded as well as wood-blocks.\r\nThe following is a reduced copy of one of those suspicious blocks, but\r\nwhich the editor considers to be of an earlier date than the St.\r\nChristopher in the collection of Earl Spencer. I am however of opinion\r\nthat it is of comparatively modern manufacture.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-65: The title of this work is: “Holzschnitte alter\r\n    Deutscher Meister in den Original-Platten gesammelt von Hans\r\n    Albrecht Von Derschau. Als ein Beytrag zur Kunstgeschichte\r\n    herausgegeben, und mit einer Abhandlung über die Holzschneidekunst\r\n    begleitet, von Rudolph Zacharias Becker.” It is in large folio,\r\n    with the text in German and French. The first part was published\r\n    at Gotha in 1808; the second in 1810; and the third in 1816.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-66: Vol. iii. p. 445, edit. 1829.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe inscription, intended for old German, at the bottom of the cut, is\r\nliterally as follows: “_Hiet uch, vor den Katczen dy vorn lecken unde\r\nhinden kraiczen_”--that is: “Beware of the cats that lick before and\r\nscratch behind.” It is rather singular that the editor--who describes\r\nthe subject as a cat which appears to teach her kitten “le Jeu de\r\nSouris”--should not have informed his readers that more was meant by\r\nthis inscription than met the eye, and that it was in fact part of a\r\nGerman proverb descriptive of a class of females who are particularly\r\ndangerous to simple young men.[IV-67] Among the cuts supposed to have\r\nbeen engraved previous to the year 1500, another is given which I\r\nsuspect also of being a forgery, and by the same person that engraved\r\nthe cat. The cut alluded to represents a woman sitting beside a young\r\nman, whose purse she is seen picking while she appears to fondle him.\r\nA hawk is seen behind the woman, and an ape behind the man. At one side\r\nis a lily, above which are the words “+Ich wart+.” At the top of the cut\r\nis an inscription,--which seems, like that in the cut of the cat, to be\r\nin affectedly old German,--describing the young man as a prey for hawks\r\nand a fool, and the woman as a flatterer, who will fawn upon him until\r\nshe has emptied his pouch. The subjects of those two cuts, though not\r\napparently, are, in reality, connected. In the first we are presented\r\nwith the warning, and in the latter with the example. Von Murr--whom Dr.\r\nDibdin suspects to have forged the French St. Christopher--describes in\r\nhis Journal impressions from those blocks as old wood-cuts in the\r\ncollection of Dr. Silberrad;[IV-68] and it is certainly very singular\r\nthat the identical blocks from which Dr. Silberrad’s scarce old wood\r\nengravings were taken should afterwards happen to be discovered and come\r\ninto the possession of the Baron Von Derschau.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-67: “+Huren sind böse katzen die vornen lecken und\r\n    hinten kratzen.+”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IV-68: Journal zur Kunstgeschichte, 2er Theil, S. 125,\r\n    126.]\r\n\r\nIn the same work there is a rude wood-cut of St. Catharine and three\r\nother saints; and at the back of the block there is also engraved the\r\nfigure of a soldier. At the bottom of the cut of St. Catharine, the name\r\nof the engraver, “+Jorg Glockendon+,” appears in old German characters.\r\nAs “Glockendon” or “Glockenton” was the name of a family of artists who\r\nappear to have been settled at Nuremberg early in the fifteenth century,\r\nBecker concludes that the cut in question was engraved prior to 1482,\r\nand that this “Jorg Glockendon” was “the first wood engraver known by\r\nname, and not John Schnitzer of Arnsheim,--who engraved the maps in\r\nLeonard Holl’s Ptolemy, printed in the above year,--as Heineken and\r\nothers pretend.” That the cut was engraved previous to 1482 rests merely\r\non Becker’s conjecture; and a person who would assert that it was\r\nengraved ten or fifteen years later, would perhaps be nearer the truth.\r\nJohn Schnitzer, however, is not the first wood engraver known by name.\r\nThe name of Hans Sporer appears in the Ars Moriendi of 1473; and it is\r\nnot probable that Hartlieb’s Chiromantia, in which we find the name\r\n“+Jorg Schapff zu Augspurg+,” was engraved subsequent to 1480. It would\r\nappear that Becker did not consider “Hans Briefmaler,” who occurs as a\r\nwood engraver between 1470 and 1480, as a person “known by name,” though\r\nit is probable that he had no other surname than that which was derived\r\nfrom his profession.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nAlthough Derschau’s collection contains a number of old cuts which are\r\nwell worth preserving, more especially among those executed in the\r\nsixteenth century; yet it also contains a large portion of worthless\r\ncuts, which are neither interesting from their subjects nor their\r\nantiquity, and which throw no light on the progress of the art. There\r\nare also not a few modern antiques which are only illustrative of the\r\ncredulity of the collector, who mistakes rudeness of execution for a\r\ncertain test of antiquity. According to this test the following cut\r\nought to be ascribed to the age of Caxton, and published with a long\r\ncommentary as an undoubted specimen of early English wood engraving. It\r\nis however nothing more than an impression from a block engraved with a\r\npen-knife by a printer’s apprentice between 1770 and 1780. It was one of\r\nthe numerous cuts of a similar kind belonging to the late Mr. George\r\nAngus of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, who used them as head-pieces to chap-books\r\nand broadside histories and ballads.\r\n\r\nBesides the smaller block-books, almanacks, and broadsides of text,\r\nexecuted by wood engravers between 1460 and 1500, they also executed a\r\nnumber of single cuts, some accompanied with a few sentences of text\r\nalso cut in wood, and others containing only figures. Many of the sacred\r\nsubjects were probably executed for convents in honour of a favourite\r\nsaint; while others were engraved by them on their own account for sale\r\namong the poorer classes of the people, who had neither the means to\r\npurchase, nor the ability to read, a large “picture-book” which\r\ncontained a considerable portion of explanatory text. In almost every\r\none of the works executed by the Briefmalers and Formschneiders\r\nsubsequent to the invention of typography, there is scarcely a single\r\ncut to be found that possesses the least merit either in design or\r\nexecution. They appear generally to have been mere workmen, who could\r\ndraw and engrave figures on wood in a rude style, but who had not the\r\nslightest pretensions to a knowledge of art.\r\n\r\nHaving now brought the history of wood engraving to the end of the\r\nfifteenth century, I shall here conclude the present chapter, without\r\nexpressly noticing such works of Albert Durer as were certainly engraved\r\non wood previous to the year 1500. The designs of this great promoter of\r\nwood engraving mark an epoch in the progress of the art; and will, with\r\nothers of the same school, more appropriately form the subject of the\r\nnext chapter.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWOOD ENGRAVING IN THE TIME OF ALBERT DURER.\r\n\r\n  Chiaro-Scuro Engraving on Wood -- A Copper-Plate by Mair Mistaken\r\n  for the First Chiaro-Scuro -- Dotted Backgrounds in Old Wood-Cuts --\r\n  Albert Durer Probably Not a Wood-Engraver -- His Birth -- A Pupil of\r\n  Michael Wolgemuth -- His Travels -- Cuts of the Apocalypse Designed\r\n  by Him -- His Visit to Venice in 1506 -- The History of the Virgin\r\n  and Christ’s Passion Engraved on Wood from his Designs -- His\r\n  Triumphal Car and Triumphal Arch of the Emperor Maximilian -- His\r\n  Invention of Etching -- His Carving -- Visit to the Netherlands --\r\n  His Death -- Wood-Cuts Designed by L. Cranach, H. Burgmair, and\r\n  H. Schæfflein -- The Adventures of Sir Theurdank -- The Wise King --\r\n  The Triumphs of Maximilian -- Ugo Da Carpi -- Lucas Van Leyden --\r\n  William De Figuersnider -- Ursgraff -- Cuts Designed by Unknown\r\n  Artists Between 1500 and 1528.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost authors who have written on the history of engraving have\r\nincidentally noticed the art of chiaro-scuro engraving on wood, which\r\nbegan to be practised early in the sixteenth century.[V-1] The honour of\r\nthe invention has been claimed for Italy by Vasari and other Italian\r\nwriters, who seem to think that no improvement in the arts of design and\r\nengraving can originate on this side of the Alps. According to their\r\naccount, chiaro-scuro engraving on wood was first introduced by Ugo da\r\nCarpi, who executed several pieces in that manner from the designs of\r\nRaffaele. But, though confident in their assertions, they are weak in\r\ntheir proofs; for they can produce no chiaro-scuros by Ugo da Carpi, or\r\nby any other Italian engraver, of an earlier date than 1518. The\r\nengravings of Italian artists in this style are not numerous, previous\r\nto 1530, and we can scarcely suppose that the earliest of them was\r\nexecuted before 1515. That the art was known and practised in Germany\r\nseveral years before this period there can be no doubt; for a\r\nchiaro-scuro wood engraving, a Repose in Egypt, by Lucas Cranach, is\r\ndated 1509; two others by Hans Baldung Grün are dated 1509 and 1510; and\r\na portrait, in the same style, by Hans Burgmair, is dated 1512.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-1: Chiaro-scuros are executed by means of two or more\r\n    blocks, in imitation of a drawing in sepia, India ink, or any\r\n    other colour of two or more shades. The older chiaro-scuros are\r\n    seldom executed with more than three blocks; on the first of which\r\n    the general outline of the subject and the stronger shades were\r\n    engraved and printed in the usual manner; from the second the\r\n    lighter shades were communicated; and from the third a general\r\n    tint was printed over the impressions of the other two.]\r\n\r\nSome German writers, not satisfied with these proofs of the art being\r\npractised in Germany before it was known in Italy, refer to an\r\nengraving, dated 1499, by a German artist of the name of Mair, as one of\r\nthe earliest executed in this manner. This engraving, which is from a\r\ncopper-plate, cannot fairly be produced as evidence on the point in\r\ndispute; for though it bears the appearance of a chiaro-scuro engraving,\r\nyet it is not so in reality; for on a narrow inspection we may perceive\r\nthat the light touches have neither been preserved, nor afterwards\r\ncommunicated by means of a block or a plate, but have been added with a\r\nfine pencil after the impression was taken. It is, in fact, nothing more\r\nthan a copper-plate printed on dark-coloured paper, and afterwards\r\nheightened with a kind of white and yellow body-colour. It is very\r\nlikely, however, that the subject was engraved and printed on a dark\r\nground with the express intention of the lights being subsequently added\r\nby means of a pencil. The artist had questionless wished to produce an\r\nimitation of a chiaro-scuro drawing; but he certainly did not effect his\r\npurpose in the same manner as L. Cranach, H. Burgmair, or Ugo da Carpi,\r\nwhose chiaro-scuro engravings had the lights preserved, and required no\r\nsubsequent touching with the pencil to give to them that character.\r\n\r\nThe subject of this engraving is the Nativity, and there is an\r\nimpression of it in the Print Room of the British Museum.[V-2] In the\r\nforeground, about the middle of the print, is the Virgin seated with the\r\ninfant Jesus in her lap. At her feet is a cradle of wicker-work, and to\r\nthe left is an angel kneeling in adoration. On the same side, but\r\nfurther distant, is Joseph leaning over a half door, holding a candle in\r\none hand and shading it with the other. In the background is the stable,\r\nin which an ox and an ass are seen; and the directing star appears\r\nshining in the sky. The print is eight inches high, and five inches and\r\nthree-eighths wide; at the top is the date 1499, and at the bottom the\r\nengraver’s name, MAIR. It is printed in black ink on paper which\r\nprevious to receiving the impression had been tinted or stained a\r\nbrownish-green colour. The lights have neither been preserved in the\r\nplate nor communicated by means of a second impression, but have been\r\nlaid on by the hand with a fine pencil. The rays of the star, and the\r\ncircles of light surrounding the head of the Virgin, and also that of\r\nthe infant, are of a pale yellow, and the colour from its chalky\r\nappearance seems very like the touches of a crayon. The lights in the\r\ndraperies and in the architectural parts of the subject have been laid\r\non with a fine pencil guided by a steady hand. That the engraver\r\nintended his work to be finished in this manner there can be little\r\ndoubt; and the impression referred to affords a proof of it; for\r\nJoseph’s candle, though he shades it with his left hand, in reality\r\ngives no light. The engraver had evidently intended that the light\r\nshould be added in positive body colour; but the person--perhaps the\r\nengraver himself--whose business it was to add the finishing touches to\r\nthe impression, has neglected to light Joseph’s candle.[V-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-2: This print is one of the valuable collection left\r\n    to the Museum by the Rev. C. M. Cracherode, and the following\r\n    remark in that gentleman’s writing is inserted on the opposite\r\n    page of the folio in which it is preserved: “The Presepe is a\r\n    plain proof that printing in chiaro-scuro was known before the\r\n    time of Ugo da Carpi, who is erroneously reputed the inventor of\r\n    this art at the beginning of the sixteenth century.” The print in\r\n    question is certainly not a proof of the art of engraving in\r\n    chiaro-scuro; and Mr. Ottley has added the following correction in\r\n    pencil: “But the white here is put on with a pencil, and not left\r\n    in printing, as it would have been if the tint had been added by a\r\n    wooden block after the copper-plate had been printed.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-3: Bartsch describes this print in his\r\n    Peintre-Graveur, tom. vi. p. 364, No. 4; but he takes no notice of\r\n    Joseph holding a candle, nor of its wanting a light.]\r\n\r\nTowards the latter end of the fifteenth century,[V-4] a practice was\r\nintroduced by the German wood engravers of dotting the dark parts of\r\ntheir subjects with white, more especially in cuts where the figures\r\nwere intended to appear light upon a dark ground; and about the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth, this mode of “killing the black,” as it is\r\ntechnically termed, was very generally prevalent among the French wood\r\nengravers, who, as well as the Germans and Dutch, continued to practise\r\nit till about 1520, when it was almost wholly superseded by\r\ncross-hatching; a mode of producing shade which had been much practised\r\nby the German engravers who worked from the drawings of Durer, Cranach,\r\nand Burgmair, and which about that time seems to have been generally\r\nadopted in all countries where the art had made any progress. The two\r\nfollowing cuts, which are from an edition of “Heures à l’Usaige de\r\nChartres,” printed at Paris by Simon Vostre, about 1502, are examples of\r\nthis mode of diminishing the effects of a ground which would otherwise\r\nbe entirely black. Books printed in France between 1500 and 1520 afford\r\nthe most numerous instances of dark backgrounds dotted with white. In\r\nmany cuts executed about the latter period the dots are of larger size\r\nand more numerous in proportion to the black, and they evidently have\r\nbeen produced by means of a lozenge-pointed tool, in imitation of\r\ncross-hatching.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-4: Some single cuts executed in this manner are\r\n    supposed to be at least as old as the year 1450. The earliest that\r\n    I have noticed in a book occur in a Life of Christ printed at\r\n    Cologne about 1485.]\r\n\r\nThe greatest promoter of the art of wood engraving, towards the close of\r\nthe fifteenth and in the early part of the sixteenth century, was\r\nunquestionably Albert Durer; not however, as is generally supposed, from\r\nhaving himself engraved the numerous wood-cuts which bear his mark, but\r\nfrom his having thought so well of the art as to have most of his\r\ngreatest works engraved on wood from drawings made on the block by\r\nhimself. Until within the last thirty years, most writers who have\r\nwritten on the subject of art, have spoken of Albert Durer as a wood\r\nengraver; and before proceeding to give any account of his life, or\r\nspecimens of some of the principal wood engravings which bear his mark,\r\nit appears necessary to examine the grounds of this opinion.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere are about two hundred subjects engraved on wood which are marked\r\nwith the initials of Albert Durer’s name; and the greater part of them,\r\nthough evidently designed by the hand of a master, are engraved in a\r\nmanner which certainly denotes no very great excellence. Of the\r\nremainder, which are better engraved, it would be difficult to point out\r\none which displays execution so decidedly superior as to enable any\r\nperson to say positively that it must have been cut by Albert Durer\r\nhimself. The earliest engravings on wood with Durer’s mark are sixteen\r\ncuts illustrative of the Apocalypse, first published in 1498; and\r\nbetween that period and 1528, the year of his death, it is likely that\r\nnearly all the others were executed. The cuts of the Apocalypse\r\ngenerally are much superior to all wood engravings that had previously\r\nappeared, both in design and execution; but if they be carefully\r\nexamined by any person conversant with the practice of the art, it will\r\nbe perceived that their superiority is not owing to any delicacy in the\r\nlines which would render them difficult to engrave, but from the ability\r\nof the person by whom they were drawn, and from his knowledge of the\r\ncapabilities of the art. Looking at the state of wood engraving at the\r\nperiod when those cuts were published, I cannot think that the artist\r\nwho made the drawings would experience any difficulty in finding persons\r\ncapable of engraving them. In most of the wood-cuts supposed to have\r\nbeen engraved by Albert Durer we find cross-hatching freely introduced;\r\nthe readiest mode of producing effect to an artist drawing on wood with\r\na pen or a black-lead pencil, but which to the wood engraver is attended\r\nwith considerable labour. Had Albert Durer engraved his own designs,\r\nI am inclined to think that he would not have introduced cross-hatching\r\nso frequently, but would have endeavoured to attain his object by means\r\nwhich were easier of execution. What is termed “cross-hatching” in wood\r\nengraving is nothing more than black lines crossing each other, for the\r\nmost part diagonally; and in _drawing_ on wood it is easier to produce a\r\nshade by this means, than by thickening the lines; but in _engraving_ on\r\nwood it is precisely the reverse; for it is easier to leave a thick line\r\nthan to cut out the interstices of lines crossing each other. Nothing is\r\nmore common than for persons who know little of the history of wood\r\nengraving, and still less of the practice, to refer to the frequent\r\ncross-hatching in the cuts supposed to have been engraved by Albert\r\nDurer as a proof of their excellence: as if the talent of the artist\r\nwere chiefly displayed in such parts of the cuts as are in reality least\r\nworthy of him, and which a mere workman might execute as well. In\r\nopposition to this vulgar error I venture to assert, that there is not a\r\nwood engraver in London of the least repute who cannot produce\r\n_apprentices_ to cut fac-similes of any cross-hatching that is to be\r\nfound, not only in the wood engravings supposed to have been executed by\r\nAlbert Durer, but in those of any other master. The execution of\r\ncross-hatching requires time, but very little talent; and a moderately\r\nclever lad, with a steady hand and a lozenge-pointed tool, will cut in a\r\nyear a _square yard_ of such cross-hatching as is generally found in the\r\nlargest of the cuts supposed to have been engraved by Albert Durer. In\r\nthe works of Bewick, scarcely more than one trifling instance of\r\ncross-hatching is to be found; and in the productions of all other\r\nmodern wood engravers who have made their own drawings, we find\r\ncross-hatching sparingly introduced; while in almost every one of the\r\ncuts designed by Durer, Cranach, Burgmair, and others who are known to\r\nhave been painters of eminence in their day, it is of frequent\r\noccurrence. Had these masters engraved their own designs on wood, as has\r\nbeen very generally supposed, they probably would have introduced much\r\nless cross-hatching into their subjects; but as there is every reason to\r\nbelieve that they only made the drawing on the wood, the engravings\r\nwhich are ascribed to them abound in lines which are readily made with a\r\npen or a pencil, but which require considerable time to cut with a\r\ngraver.\r\n\r\nAt the period that Durer published his illustrations of the Apocalypse,\r\nfew wood-cuts of much merit either in design or execution had appeared\r\nin printed books; and the wood engravers of that age seem generally to\r\nhave been mere workmen, who only understood the mechanical branch of\r\ntheir art, but who were utterly devoid of all knowledge of composition\r\nor correct drawing; and there is also reason to believe that wood-cuts\r\nat that period, and even for some time after, were not unfrequently\r\nengraved by women.[V-5] As the names of those persons were probably not\r\nknown beyond the town in which they resided, it cannot be a matter of\r\nsurprise that neither their marks nor initials should be found on the\r\ncuts which they engraved from the drawings of such artists as Albert\r\nDurer.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-5: In a folio of Albert Durer’s drawings in the Print\r\n    Room at the British Museum there is a portrait of “_Fronica,\r\n    Formschneiderin_,” with the date 1525. In 1433 we find a woman at\r\n    Nuremberg described as a card-maker: “_Eli. Kartenmacherin_.” It\r\n    is scarcely necessary to remind the reader that the earliest\r\n    German wood engravers were card-makers.--See chapter II. p. 41.]\r\n\r\nIt perhaps may be objected, that as Albert Durer’s copper-plate\r\nengravings contain only his mark, in the same manner as the wood\r\nengravings, it might with equal reason be questioned if they were really\r\nexecuted by himself. Notwithstanding the identity of the marks, there\r\nis, however, a wide difference between the two cases. In the age of\r\nAlbert Durer most of the artists who engraved on copper were also\r\npainters; and most of the copper-plate engravings which bear his mark\r\nare such as none but an artist of great talent could execute. It would\r\nrequire the abilities of a first-rate copper-plate engraver of the\r\npresent day to produce a fac-simile of his best copper-plates; while a\r\nwood engraver of but moderate skill would be able to cut a fac-simile of\r\none of his best wood engravings after the subject was drawn for him on\r\nthe block. The best of Albert Durer’s copper-plates could only have been\r\nengraved by a master; while the best of his wood-cuts might be engraved\r\nby a working Formschneider who had acquired a practical knowledge of his\r\nart by engraving, under the superintendence of Michael Wolgemuth and\r\nWilliam Pleydenwurff, the wood-cuts for the Nuremberg Chronicle.\r\n\r\nVon Murr, who was of opinion that Albert Durer engraved his own designs\r\non wood, gives a letter of Durer’s in the ninth volume of his Journal\r\nwhich he thinks is decisive of the fact. The letter, which relates to a\r\nwood engraving of a shield of arms, was written in 1511, and is to the\r\nfollowing effect: “Dear Michael Beheim, I return you the arms, and beg\r\nthat you will let it remain as it is. No one will make it better, as I\r\nhave done it according to art and with great care, as those who see it\r\nand understand the matter will tell you. If the labels were thrown back\r\nabove the helmet, the volet would be covered.”[V-6] This letter,\r\nhowever, is by no means decisive, for it is impossible to determine\r\nwhether the “arms” which the artist returned were a finished engraving\r\nor merely a drawing on wood.[V-7] From one or two expressions it seems\r\nmost likely to have been a drawing only; for in a finished cut\r\nalterations cannot very well be introduced; and it seems most probable\r\nthat Michael Beheim’s objections would be made to the drawing of the\r\narms before they were engraved, and not to the finished cut. But even\r\nsupposing it to have been the engraved block which Durer returned, this\r\nis by no means a proof of his having engraved it himself, for he might\r\nhave engravers employed in his house in order that the designs which he\r\ndrew on the blocks might be executed under his own superintendence. The\r\nBaron Derschau indeed told Dr. Dibdin that he was once in possession of\r\nthe _journal_ or day-book of Albert Durer, from which “it appeared that\r\nhe was in the habit of drawing upon the blocks, and that his men\r\nperformed the remaining operation of cutting away the wood.”[V-8] This\r\ninformation, had it been communicated by a person whose veracity might\r\nbe depended on, would be decisive of the question; but the book\r\nunfortunately “perished in the flames of a house in the neighbourhood of\r\none of the battles fought between Bonaparte and the Prussians;” and from\r\na little anecdote recorded by Dr. Dibdin the Baron appears to have been\r\na person whose word was not to be implicitly relied on.[V-9]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-6: The following is Bartsch’s French version of this\r\n    letter, which is given in the original German in Von Murr’s\r\n    Journal, 9^er. Theil, S. 53. “Cher Michel Beheim. Je vous envoie\r\n    les armoiries, en vous priant de les laisser comme elles sont.\r\n    Personne d’ailleurs ne les corrigeroit en mieux, car je les ai\r\n    faites exprès et avec art; c’est pourquoi ceux qui s’y connoissent\r\n    et qui les verront vous en rendront bonne raison. Si l’on haussoit\r\n    les lambrequins du heaume, ils couvriroient le volet.”--Bartsch,\r\n    Peintre-Graveur, tom. vii. p. 27.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-7: In Durer’s Journal of his visit to the Netherlands\r\n    in 1520 there is the following passage: “Item hab dem von\r\n    Rogendorff sein Wappen auf Holz gerissen, dafür hat er mir\r\n    geschenckt vii. Ein Sammet.”--“Also I have drawn for Von\r\n    Rogendorff his arms on wood, for which he has presented me with\r\n    seven yards of velvet.”--Von Murr, Journal zur Kunstgeschichte,\r\n    7^er. Theil, S. 76.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-8: Bibliographical Tour, vol. iii. p. 442, second\r\n    edition.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-9: The Baron was the collector of the wood-cuts\r\n    published with Becker’s explanations, referred to at page 226,\r\n    chapter IV. The anecdote alluded to will be found in Dr. Dibdin’s\r\n    Bibliographical Tour, vol. iii. pp. 445, 446. The Baron sold a\r\n    rare specimen of copper-plate engraving with the date M. CCCC.\r\n    XXX. to the Doctor, and it seems that he also sold _another_\r\n    impression from the same plate to Mr. John Payne. There is no\r\n    doubt of their being gross forgeries; and it is not unlikely that\r\n    the plate was in the Baron’s possession.]\r\n\r\nNeudörffer, who in 1546 collected some particulars relative to the\r\nhistory of the artists of Nuremberg, says that Jerome Resch, or Rösch,\r\nengraved most of the cuts designed by Albert Durer. He also says that\r\nResch was one of the most skilful wood engravers of his day, and that he\r\nparticularly excelled in engraving letters on wood. This artist also\r\nused to engrave dies for coining money, and had a printing establishment\r\nof his own. He dwelt in the Broad Way at Nuremberg, with a back entrance\r\nin Petticoat Lane;[V-10] and when he was employed in engraving the\r\nTriumphal Car drawn by Albert Durer for the Emperor Maximilian, the\r\nEmperor used to call almost every day to see the progress of the work;\r\nand as he entered at Petticoat Lane, it became a by-word with the common\r\npeople: “The Emperor still often drives to Petticoat Lane.”[V-11]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-10: “Dieser Hieronymus hat allhier im breiten Gassen\r\n    gewohnt, dessen Wohnung hinten ins Frauengässlein ging.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-11: Neudörffer, quoted in Von Murr’s Journal, 2ter\r\n    Theil, S. 158, 159.]\r\n\r\nAlthough it is by no means unlikely that Albert Durer might engrave two\r\nor three wood-cuts of his own designing, yet, after a careful\r\nexamination of most of those that bear his mark, I cannot find one which\r\nis so decidedly superior to the rest as to induce an opinion of its\r\nbeing engraved by himself; and I cannot for a moment believe that an\r\nartist of his great talents, and who painted so many pictures, engraved\r\nso many copper-plates, and made so many designs, could find time to\r\nengrave even a small part of the many wood-cuts which have been supposed\r\nto be executed by him, and which a common wood engraver might execute as\r\nwell. “If Durer himself had engraved on wood,” says Bartsch in the\r\nseventh volume of his Peintre-Graveur, “it is most likely that among the\r\nmany particular accounts which we have of his different pursuits, and of\r\nthe various kind of works which he has left, the fact of his having\r\napplied himself to wood engraving would certainly have been transmitted\r\nin a manner no less explicit; but, far from finding the least trace of\r\nit, everything that relates to this subject proves that he had never\r\nemployed himself in this kind of work. He is always described as a\r\npainter, a designer, or an editor of works engraved on wood, but never\r\nas a wood engraver.”[V-12] I also further agree with Bartsch, who thinks\r\nthat the wood-cuts which contain the marks of Lucas Cranach, Hans\r\nBurgmair, and others who are known to have been painters of considerable\r\nreputation in their day, were not engraved by those artists, but only\r\ndesigned or drawn by them on the block.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-12: At the end of the first edition of the cuts\r\n    illustrative of the Apocalypse, 1498, we find the words: “_Gedrukt\r\n    durch Albrecht Durer, Maler_,”--Printed by Albert Durer, painter;\r\n    and the same in Latin in the second edition, printed about 1510.\r\n    The passion of Christ and the History of the Virgin are\r\n    respectively said to have been “_effigiata_” and “_per figuras\r\n    digesta_”--“drawn” and “pictorially represented” by Albert Durer;\r\n    and the cuts of the Triumphal Car of the Emperor Maximilian are\r\n    described as being “_erfunden und geordnet_”--“invented and\r\n    arranged” by him.--Bartsch, Peintre-Graveur, tom. vii. p. 28.]\r\n\r\nAlbert Durer was born at Nuremberg, on 20th May 1471. His father, whose\r\nname was also Albert, was a goldsmith, and a native of Cola in Hungary.\r\nHis mother was a daughter of Jerome Haller, who was also a goldsmith,\r\nand the master under whom the elder Durer had acquired a knowledge of\r\nhis art. Albert continued with his father till his sixteenth year, and\r\nhad, as he himself says, learned to execute beautiful works in the\r\ngoldsmith’s art, when he felt a great desire to become a painter. His\r\nfather on hearing of his wish to change his profession was much\r\ndispleased, as he considered that the time he had already spent in\r\nendeavouring to acquire a knowledge of the art of a goldsmith was\r\nentirely lost. He, however, assented to his son’s earnest request, and\r\nplaced him, on St. Andrew’s day, 1486, as a pupil under Michael\r\nWolgemuth for the term of three years, to learn the art of painting. On\r\nthe expiration of his “lehr-jahre,” or apprenticeship, in 1490, he left\r\nhis master, and, according to the custom of German artists of that\r\nperiod, proceeded to travel for the purpose of gaining a further\r\nknowledge of his profession. In what manner or in what places he was\r\nchiefly employed during his “wander-jahre”[V-13] is not very well known;\r\nbut it is probable that his travels did not extend beyond Germany. In\r\nthe course of his peregrinations he visited Colmar, in 1492, where he\r\nwas kindly received by Caspar, Paul, and Louis, the brothers of Martin\r\nSchongauer; but he did not see, either then or at any other period, that\r\ncelebrated engraver himself.[V-14] He returned to Nuremberg in the\r\nspring of 1494; and shortly afterwards married Agnes, the daughter of\r\nJohn Frey, a mechanist of considerable reputation of that city. This\r\nmatch, which is said to have been made for him by his parents, proved to\r\nbe an unhappy one; for, though his wife possessed considerable personal\r\ncharms, she was a woman of a most wretched temper; and her incessant\r\nurging him to continued exertion in order that she might obtain money,\r\nis said to have embittered the life of the artist and eventually to have\r\nhastened his death.[V-15]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-13: The time that a German artist spends in travel\r\n    from the expiration of his apprenticeship to the period of his\r\n    settling as a master is called his “wander-jahre,”--his travelling\r\n    years. It is customary with many trades in Germany for the young\r\n    men to travel for a certain time on the termination of their\r\n    apprenticeship before they are admitted to the full privileges of\r\n    the company or fellowship.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-14: It has been stated, though erroneously, that\r\n    Albert Durer was a pupil of Martin Schongauer, or Schön, as the\r\n    surname was spelled by some writers, one of the most eminent\r\n    painters and copper-plate engravers of his day. It has been\r\n    generally supposed that he died in 1486; but, if an old memorandum\r\n    at the back of his portrait in the collection of Count de Fries\r\n    can be depended on, his death did not take place till the 2d of\r\n    February 1499. An account of this memorandum will be found in\r\n    Ottley’s Inquiry into the Origin and Early History of Engraving,\r\n    vol. ii. p. 640.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-15: On a passage, in which Durer alludes to his wife,\r\n    in one of his letters from Venice, 1506, to his friend Bilibald\r\n    Pirkheimer, Von Murr makes the following remark: “This Xantippe\r\n    must even at that time have vexed him much; and he was obliged to\r\n    drag on his life with her for twenty-two years longer, till she\r\n    fairly plagued him to death.”--Journal, 10er Theil, S. 32.]\r\n\r\nIt has not been ascertained from whom Albert Durer learnt the art of\r\nengraving on copper; for there seems but little reason to believe that\r\nhis master Michael Wolgemuth ever practised that branch of art, though\r\nseveral copper-plates, marked with a W, have been ascribed to him by\r\nsome authors.[V-16] As most of the early copper-plate engravers were\r\nalso goldsmiths, it is probable that Durer might acquire some knowledge\r\nof the former art during the time that he continued with his father;\r\nand, as he was endowed with a versatile genius, it is not unlikely that\r\nhe owed his future improvement entirely to himself. The earliest date\r\nthat is to be found on his copper-plates is 1494. The subject in which\r\nthis date occurs represents a group of four naked women with a globe\r\nsuspended above them, in the manner of a lamp, on which are inscribed\r\nthe letters O. G. H. which have been supposed to signify the words\r\n“O Gott helf!”--Help, O Lord!--as if the spectator on beholding the\r\nnaked beauties were exceedingly liable to fall into temptation.[V-17]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-16: Bartsch is decidedly of opinion that Michael\r\n    Wolgemuth was not an engraver; and he ascribes all the plates\r\n    marked with a W, which others have supposed to be Wolgemuth’s, to\r\n    Wenceslaus of Olmutz, an artist of whom nothing is positively\r\n    known.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-17: This subject has also been engraved by Israel Von\r\n    Mecken, and by an artist supposed to be Wenceslaus of Olmutz. It\r\n    is probable that those artists have copied Durer’s engraving. On\r\n    the globe in Israel Von Mecken’s plate the letters are O. G. B.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest wood engravings that contain Albert Durer’s mark are\r\nsixteen subjects, of folio size, illustrative of the Apocalypse, which\r\nwere printed at Nuremberg, 1498. On the first leaf is the title in\r\nGerman: “Die heimliche Offenbarung Johannes”--“The Revelation of\r\nJohn;”--and on the back of the last cut but one is the imprint:\r\n“Gedrücket zu Nurnbergk durch Albrecht Durer, maler, nach Christi geburt\r\nM. CCCC. und darnach im xcviij. iar”--“Printed at Nuremberg by Albert\r\nDurer, painter, in the year after the birth of Christ 1498.” The date of\r\nthose cuts marks an important epoch in the history of wood engraving.\r\nFrom this time the boundaries of the art became enlarged; and wood\r\nengravers, instead of being almost wholly occupied in executing designs\r\nof the very lowest character, drawn without feeling, taste, or\r\nknowledge, were now to be engaged in engraving subjects of general\r\ninterest, drawn, expressly for the purpose of being thus executed, by\r\nsome of the most celebrated artists of the age. Though several cuts of\r\nthe Apocalypse are faulty in drawing and extravagant in design, they are\r\non the whole much superior to any series of wood engravings that\r\npreceded them; and their execution, though coarse, is free and bold.\r\nThey are not equal, in point of well-contrasted light and shade, to some\r\nof Durer’s later designs on wood; but considering them as his first\r\nessays in drawing on wood, they are not unworthy of his reputation. They\r\nappear as if they had been drawn on the block with a pen and ink; and\r\nthough cross-hatching is to be found in all of them, this mode of\r\nindicating a shade, or obtaining “colour,” is much less frequently\r\nemployed than in some of his later productions. The following is a\r\nreduced copy of one of the cuts, No. 11, which is illustrative of the\r\ntwelfth chapter of Revelations, verses 1-4: “And there appeared a great\r\nwonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her\r\nfeet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.----And there appeared\r\nanother wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven\r\nheads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. And his tail drew\r\nthe third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth;\r\nand the dragon stood before the woman.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn 1502 a pirated edition of those cuts was published at Strasburg by\r\nJerome Greff, who describes himself as a painter of Frankfort. In 1511\r\nDurer published a second edition of the originals; and on the back of\r\nthe last cut but one is a caution addressed to the plagiary, informing\r\nhim of the Emperor’s order, prohibiting any one to copy the cuts or to\r\nsell the spurious impressions within the limits of the German empire,\r\nunder the penalty of the confiscation of goods, and at the peril of\r\nfurther punishment.[V-18]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-18: This caution is in the original expressed in the\r\n    following indignant terms: “Heus, tu insidiator, ac alieni laboris\r\n    et ingenii surreptor, ne manus temerarias his nostris operibus\r\n    inicias cave. Scias enim a gloriosissimo Romanorum imperatore\r\n    Maximiliano nobis concessum esse ne quis suppositiciis formis has\r\n    imagines imprimere seu impressas per imperii limites vendere\r\n    audeat: q’ per contemptum seu avariciæ crimen secus feceris, post\r\n    bonorum confiscationem tibi maximum periculum subeundum esse\r\n    certissime scias.”]\r\n\r\nThough no other wood engravings with Durer’s mark are found with a date\r\ntill 1504, yet it is highly probable that several subjects of his\r\ndesigning were engraved between 1498, the date of the Apocalypse, and\r\nthe above year; and it is also likely that he engraved several\r\ncopper-plates within this period; although, with the exception of that\r\nof the four naked women, there are only four known which contain a date\r\nearlier than 1505. About the commencement of 1506 Durer visited Venice,\r\nwhere he remained till October in the same year. Eight letters which he\r\naddressed to Bilibald Pirkheimer from Venice, are printed in the tenth\r\nvolume of Von Murr’s Journal. In the first letter, which is dated on the\r\nday of the Three Kings of Cologne, 1506, he informs his friend that he\r\nwas employed to paint a picture for the German church at Venice, for\r\nwhich he was to receive a hundred and ten Rhenish guilders,[V-19] and\r\nthat he expects to have it ready to place above the altar a month after\r\nEaster. He expresses a hope that he will be enabled to repay out of this\r\nmoney what he had borrowed of Pirkheimer. From this letter it seems\r\nevident that Durer’s circumstances were not then in a very flourishing\r\nstate, and that he had to depend on his exertions for the means of\r\nliving. The comparatively trifling sums which he mentions as having sent\r\nto his mother and his wife sufficiently declare that he had not left a\r\nconsiderable sum at home. He also says, that should his wife want more\r\nmoney, her father must assist her, and that he will honourably repay him\r\non his return.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-19: Von Murr says that the subject of this picture was\r\n    the martyrdom of St. Bartholomew, the saint to whom the church was\r\n    dedicated; and that the painting afterwards came into the\r\n    possession of the Emperor Rudolf II. and was placed in his gallery\r\n    at Prague. It seems that Durer had taken some pictures with him to\r\n    Venice; for in his fifth letter he says that he has sold two for\r\n    twenty-four ducats, and exchanged three others for three rings,\r\n    valued also at twenty-four ducats.]\r\n\r\nIn the second letter, after telling Pirkheimer that he has no other\r\nfriend but him on earth, he expresses a wish that he were in Venice to\r\nenjoy the pleasant company that he has met with there. The following\r\npassage, which occurs in this letter, is, perhaps, the most interesting\r\nin the collection: “I have many good friends among the Italians, who\r\nwarn me not to eat or drink with their painters, of whom several are my\r\nenemies, and copy my picture in the church and others of mine, wherever\r\nthey can find them; and yet they blame them, and say they are not\r\naccording to ancient art, and therefore not good. Giovanni Bellini[V-20]\r\nhowever has praised me highly to several gentlemen, and wishes to have\r\nsomething of my doing. He called on me himself, and requested that I\r\nwould paint a picture for him, for which he said he would pay me well.\r\nPeople are all surprised that I should be so much thought of by a person\r\nof his reputation. He is very old, but is still the best painter of them\r\nall. The things which pleased me eleven years ago, please me no longer.\r\nIf I had not seen it myself I could not have believed it. You must also\r\nknow that there are many better painters within this city than Master\r\nJacob is without, although Anthony Kolb swears that there is not on\r\nearth a better painter than Jacob.[V-21] The others laugh, and say if he\r\nwere good for anything he would live in Venice.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-20: In the Venetian dialect of that period Giovanni\r\n    Bellini was called Zan Belin; and Durer spells the name\r\n    “Sambellinus.” He was the master of Titian, and died in 1514, at\r\n    the age of ninety.--Von Murr, Journal, 10er Theil, S. 8.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-21: Von Murr says that he cannot discover what Jacob\r\n    is here meant. It would not be Jacob Walsch, as he died in 1500.\r\n    The person alluded to was certainly not an Italian.]\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the other six letters are chiefly occupied with\r\naccounts of his success in executing sundry little commissions with\r\nwhich he had been entrusted by his friends, such as the purchase of a\r\nfinger-ring and two pieces of tapestry; to enquire after such Greek\r\nbooks as had been recently published; and to get him some crane\r\nfeathers. The sixth and seventh letters are written in a vein of humour\r\nwhich at the present time would be called gross. Von Murr illustrates\r\none passage by a quotation from Swift which is not remarkable for its\r\ndelicacy; and he also says that Durer’s eighth letter is written in the\r\nhumorous style of that writer. Those letters show that chastity was not\r\none of Bilibald Pirkheimer’s virtues; and that the learned counsellor of\r\nthe imperial city of Nuremberg was devoted “tam Veneri quam\r\nMercurio.”[V-22]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-22: Bilibald Pirkheimer was a learned man, and a\r\n    person of great authority in the city of Nuremberg. He was also a\r\n    member of the Imperial Council, and was frequently employed in\r\n    negociations with neighbouring states. He published several works;\r\n    and among others a humorous essay entitled “Laus Podagræ”--The\r\n    Praise of the Gout. His memory is still held in great respect in\r\n    Germany as the friend of Albert Durer and Ulrich Hutten, two of\r\n    the most extraordinary men that Germany has produced. He died in\r\n    1530, aged 60.]\r\n\r\nIn the fourth letter Durer says that the painters were much opposed to\r\nhim; that they had thrice compelled him to go before the magistracy; and\r\nthat they had obliged him to give four florins to their society. In the\r\nseventh letter, he writes as follows about the picture which he had\r\npainted for the German church: “I have through it received great praise,\r\nbut little profit. I might well have gained two hundred ducats in the\r\nsame time, and all the while I laboured most diligently in order that I\r\nmight get home again. I have given all the painters a rubbing down who\r\nsaid that I could engrave[V-23] well, but that in painting I knew not\r\nhow to manage my colours. Everybody here says they never saw colours\r\nmore beautiful.” In his last letter, which is dated, “at Venice, I know\r\nnot what day of the month, but about the fourteenth day after\r\nMichaelmas, 1506,” he says that he will be ready to leave that city in\r\nabout ten days; that he intends to proceed to Bologna, and after staying\r\nthere about eight or ten days for the sake of learning some secrets in\r\nperspective, to return home by way of Venice. He visited Bologna as he\r\nintended; and was treated with great respect by the painters of that\r\ncity. After a brief stay at Bologna, he returned to Nuremberg; and there\r\nis no evidence of his ever having visited Italy again.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-23: The kind of engraving meant was copper-plate\r\n    engraving. Durer’s words are: “Ich hab awch dy Moler all gesthrilt\r\n    dy do sagten, Im _Stechen_ wer ich gut, aber im molen west ich nit\r\n    mit farben um zu gen.” The word “_Stechen_” applies to engraving\r\n    on copper; “Schneiden” to engraving on wood.--Von Murr, Journal,\r\n    10er Theil, S. 28.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn 1511, the second of Durer’s large works engraved on wood appeared at\r\nNuremberg. It is generally entitled the History of the Virgin, and\r\nconsists of nineteen large cuts, each about eleven inches and three\r\nquarters high, by eight inches and a quarter wide, with a vignette of\r\nsmaller size which ornaments the title-page.[V-24] Impressions are to be\r\nfound without any accompanying text, but the greater number have\r\nexplanatory verses printed from type at the back. The cut here\r\nrepresented is a reduced copy of the vignette on the title-page. The\r\nVirgin is seen seated on a crescent, giving suck to the infant Christ;\r\nand her figure and that of the child are drawn with great feeling. Of\r\nall Durer’s Madonnas, whether engraved on wood or copper, this, perhaps,\r\nis one of the best. Her attitude is easy and natural, and happily\r\nexpressive of the character in which she is represented--that of a\r\nnursing mother. The light and shade are well contrasted; and the folds\r\nof her ample drapery, which Durer was fond of introducing whenever he\r\ncould, are arranged in a manner which materially contributes to the\r\neffect of the engraving.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-24: The title at length is as follows: “Epitome in\r\n    Divæ Parthenices Marie Historiam ab Alberto Durero Norico per\r\n    figuras digestam, cum versibus annexis Chelidonii.” Chelidonius,\r\n    who was a Benedictine monk of Nuremberg, also furnished the\r\n    descriptive text to the series of twelve cuts illustrative of\r\n    Christ’s Passion, of which specimens will be found between page\r\n    246 and page 250.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe following cuts are reduced copies of two of the larger subjects of\r\nthe same work. That which is here given represents the birth of the\r\nVirgin; and were it not for the angel who is seen swinging a censer at\r\nthe top of the room, it might be taken for the accouchement of a German\r\nburgomaster’s wife in the year 1510. The interior is apparently that of\r\na house in Nuremberg of Durer’s own time, and the figures introduced are\r\ndoubtless faithful copies, both in costume and character, of such\r\nfemales as were generally to be found in the house of a German tradesman\r\non such an occasion. From the number of cups and flagons that are seen,\r\nwe may be certain that the gossips did not want liquor; and that in\r\nDurer’s age the female friends and attendants on a groaning woman were\r\naccustomed to enjoy themselves on the birth of a child over a cheerful\r\ncup. In the fore-ground an elderly female is perceived taking a draught,\r\nwithout measure, from a flagon; while another, more in the distance and\r\nfarther to the right, appears to be drinking, from a cup, health to the\r\ninfant which a woman like a nurse holds in her arms. An elderly female,\r\nsitting by the side of the bed, has dropped into a doze; but whether\r\nfrom the effects of the liquor or long watching it would not be easy to\r\ndivine. On the opposite side of the bed a female figure presents a\r\ncaudle, with a spoon in it, to St. Anne, the mother of the Virgin, while\r\nanother is seen filling a goblet of wine. At the bottom of the cut is\r\nDurer’s mark on a tablet. The original cut is not remarkable for the\r\nexcellence of its engraving, but it affords a striking example of the\r\nlittle attention which Durer, in common with most other German painters\r\nof that period, paid to propriety of costume in the treatment of such\r\nsubjects. The piece is Hebrew, of the age of Herod the Great; but the\r\nscenery, dresses, and decorations are German, of the time of\r\nMaximilian I.\r\n\r\nThe second specimen of the large cuts of Durer’s Life of the Virgin,\r\ngiven on the next page, represents the Sojourn of the Holy Family in\r\nEgypt. In the fore-ground St. Joseph is seen working at his business as\r\na carpenter; while a number of little figures, like so many Cupids, are\r\nbusily employed in collecting the chips which he makes and in putting\r\nthem into a basket. Two little winged figures, of the same family as the\r\nchip-collectors, are seen running hand-in-hand, a little more in the\r\ndistance to the left, and one of them holds in his hand a plaything like\r\nthose which are called “windmills” in England, and are cried about as\r\n“toys for girls and boys,” and sold for a halfpenny each, or exchanged\r\nfor old pewter spoons, doctors’ bottles, or broken flint-glass. To the\r\nright the Virgin, a matronly-looking figure, is seen sitting spinning,\r\nand at the same time rocking with her foot the cradle in which the\r\ninfant Christ is asleep. Near the Virgin are St. Elizabeth and her young\r\nson, the future Baptist. At the head of the cradle is an angel bending\r\nas if in the act of adoration; while another, immediately behind St.\r\nElizabeth, holds a pot containing flowers. In the sky there is a\r\nrepresentation of the Deity, with the Holy Ghost in the shape of a dove.\r\nThe artist has not thought it necessary to mark the locality of the\r\nscene by the introduction of pyramids and temples in the back-ground,\r\nfor the architectural parts of his subject, as well as the human\r\nfigures, have evidently been supplied by his own country, Durer’s mark\r\nis at the bottom of the cut on the right.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nChrist’s Passion, consisting of a series of eleven large wood-cuts and a\r\nvignette, designed by Albert Durer, appeared about the same time as his\r\nHistory of the Virgin.[V-25] The descriptive matter was compiled by\r\nChelidonius; and, in the same manner as in the History of the Virgin,\r\na certain number of impressions were printed without any explanatory\r\ntext.[V-26] The large subjects are about fifteen inches and a half high,\r\nby eleven inches and an eighth wide. The following cut is a reduced copy\r\nof the vignette on the title-page.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-25: The cuts of these two works appear to have been in\r\n    the hands of the engraver at the same time. Of those in the\r\n    History of the Virgin one is dated 1509; and two bear the date\r\n    1510; and in the Passion of Christ four are dated 1510.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-26: The Latin title of the work is as follows: “Passio\r\n    Domini nostri Jesu, ex Hieronymo Paduano, Dominico Mancino,\r\n    Sedulio, et Baptista Mantuana, per fratrem Chelidonium collecta,\r\n    cum figuris Alberti Dureri Norici Pictoris.”]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe subject is Christ mocked; but the artist has at the same time wished\r\nto express in the figure of Christ the variety of his sufferings: the\r\nSaviour prays as if in his agony on the mount; near him lies the\r\ninstrument of his flagellation; his hands and feet bear the marks of the\r\nnails, and he appears seated on the covering of his sepulchre. The\r\nsoldier is kneeling and offering a reed as a sceptre to Christ, whom he\r\nhails in derision as King of the Jews.\r\n\r\nThe three following cuts are reduced copies of the same number in the\r\nPassion of Christ. In the cut of the Last Supper, in the next page,\r\ncross-hatching is freely introduced, though without contributing much to\r\nthe improvement of the engraving; and the same effect in the wall to the\r\nright, in the groins of the roof, and in the floor under the table,\r\nmight be produced by much simpler means. No artist, I am persuaded,\r\nwould introduce such work in a design if he had to engrave it himself.\r\nThe same “colour” might be produced by single lines which could be\r\nexecuted in a third of the time required to cut out the interstices of\r\nthe cross-hatchings. Durer’s mark is at the bottom of the cut, and the\r\ndate 1510 is perceived above it, on the frame of the table.\r\n\r\nThe cut on page 249, from the Passion, Christ bearing his Cross, is\r\nhighly characteristic of Durer’s style; and the original is one of the\r\nbest of all the wood engravings which bear his mark. The characters\r\nintroduced are such as he was fondest of drawing; and most of the heads\r\nand figures may be recognised in several other engravings either\r\nexecuted by himself on copper or by others on wood from his designs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe figure which is seen holding a kind of halbert in his right hand is\r\na favourite with Durer, and is introduced, with trifling variations, in\r\nat least half a dozen of his subjects; and the horseman with a kind of\r\nturban on his head and a lance in his left hand occurs no less\r\nfrequently. St. Veronica, who is seen holding the “sudarium,” or holy\r\nhandkerchief, in the fore-ground to the left, is a type of his female\r\nfigures; the head of the executioner, who is seen urging Christ forward,\r\nis nearly the same as that of the mocker in the preceding vignette; and\r\nSimon the Cyrenian, who assists to bear the cross, appears to be the\r\ntwin-brother of St. Joseph in the Sojourn in Egypt. The figure of\r\nChrist, bowed down with the weight of the cross, is well drawn, and his\r\nface is strongly expressive of sorrow. Behind Simon the Cyrenian are the\r\nVirgin and St. John; and under the gateway a man with a haggard visage\r\nis perceived carrying a ladder with his head between the steps. The\r\nartist’s mark is at the bottom of the cut.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe subject of the cut on page 250, from Christ’s Passion, represents\r\nthe descent into hell and the liberation of the ancestors. The massive\r\ngates of the abode of sin and death have been burst open, and the banner\r\nof the cross waves triumphant. Among those who have already been\r\nliberated from the pit of darkness are Eve, who has her back turned\r\ntowards the spectator, and Adam, who in his right hand holds an apple,\r\nthe symbol of his fall, and with his left supports a cross, the emblem\r\nof his redemption. In the front is Christ aiding others of the ancestors\r\nto ascend from the pit, to the great dismay of the demons whose realm is\r\ninvaded. A horrid monster, with a head like that of a boar surmounted\r\nwith a horn, aims a blow at the Redeemer with a kind of rude lance;\r\nwhile another, a hideous compound of things that swim, and walk, and\r\nfly, sounds a note of alarm to arouse his kindred fiends. On a stone,\r\nabove the entrance to the pit, is the date 1510; and Durer’s mark is\r\nperceived on another stone immediately before the figure of Christ. This\r\ncut, with the exception of the frequent cross-hatching, is designed more\r\nin the style and spirit of the artist’s illustrations of the Apocalypse\r\nthan in the manner of the rest of the series to which it belongs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe preceding specimens of wood-cuts from Durer’s three great works, the\r\nApocalypse, the History of the Virgin, and Christ’s Passion, afford not\r\nonly an idea of the style of his drawing on wood, but also of the\r\nprogress made by the art of wood engraving from the time of his first\r\navailing himself of its capabilities. In Durer’s designs on wood we\r\nperceive not only more correct drawing and a greater knowledge of\r\ncomposition, but also a much more effective combination of light and\r\nshade, than are to be found in any wood-cuts executed before the date of\r\nhis earliest work, the Apocalypse, which appeared in 1498. One of the\r\npeculiar advantages of wood engraving is the effect with which strong\r\nshades can be represented; and of this Durer has generally availed\r\nhimself with the greatest skill. On comparing his works engraved on wood\r\nwith all those previously executed in the same manner, we shall find\r\nthat his figures are not only much better drawn and more skilfully\r\ngrouped, but that instead of sticking, in hard outline, against the\r\nback-ground, they stand out with the natural appearance of rotundity.\r\nThe rules of perspective are more attentively observed; the back-grounds\r\nbetter filled; and a number of subordinate objects introduced--such as\r\ntrees, herbage, flowers, animals, and children--which at once give a\r\npleasing variety to the subject and impart to it the stamp of truth.\r\nThough the figures in many of his designs may not indeed be correct in\r\npoint of costume,--for though he diligently studied Nature, it was only\r\nin her German dress,--yet their character and expression are generally\r\nappropriate and natural. Though incapable of imparting to sacred\r\nsubjects the elevated character which is given to them by Raffaele, his\r\nrepresentations are perhaps no less like the originals than those of the\r\ngreat Italian master. It is indeed highly probable that Albert Durer’s\r\nGerman representatives of saints and apostles are more like the\r\noriginals than the more dignified ideal portraits of Raffaele. The\r\nlatter, from his knowledge of the antique, has frequently given to his\r\nJews a character and a costume borrowed from Grecian art of the age of\r\nPhidias; while Albert Durer has given to them the features and invested\r\nthem in the costume of Germans of his own age.\r\n\r\nShortly after the appearance of the large cuts illustrative of Christ’s\r\nPassion, Durer published a series of thirty-seven of a smaller size,\r\nalso engraved on wood, which Mr. Ottley calls “The Fall of Man and his\r\nRedemption through Christ,” but which Durer himself refers to under the\r\ntitle of “The Little Passion.”[V-27] All the cuts of the Little Passion,\r\nas well as seventeen of those of the Life of the Virgin and several\r\nother pieces of Durer’s, were imitated on copper by Marc Antonio\r\nRaimondi, the celebrated Italian engraver, who is said to have sold his\r\ncopies as the originals. Vasari, in his Life of Marc Antonio, says that\r\nwhen Durer was informed of this imitation of his works, he was highly\r\nincensed and he set out directly for Venice, and that on his arrival\r\nthere he complained of Marc Antonio’s proceedings to the government; but\r\ncould obtain no further redress than that in future Marc Antonio should\r\nnot put Durer’s mark to his engravings.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-27: The Latin title of this work is “Passio Christi,”\r\n    and the explanatory verses are from the pen of Chelidonius. Durer,\r\n    in the Journal of his Visit to the Netherlands, twice mentions it\r\n    as “die Kleine Passion,” and each time with a distinction which\r\n    proves that he did not mean the Passion engraved by him on copper\r\n    and probably published in 1512. “Item Sebaldt Fischer hat mir zu\r\n    Antorff [Antwerp] abkaufft 16 _kleiner Passion_, pro 4 fl. Mehr 32\r\n    grosser Bücher pro 8 fl. Mehr 6 gestochne Passion pro 3\r\n    fl.”--“Darnach die drey Bücher unser Frauen Leben, Apocalypsin,\r\n    und den grossen Passion, darnach _den klein Passion_, und den\r\n    Passion in Kupffer.”--Albrecht Dürers Reisejournal, in Von Murr,\r\n    7er Theil, S. 60 and 67. The size of the cuts of the Little\r\n    Passion is five inches high by three and seven-eighths wide. Four\r\n    impressions from the original blocks are given in Ottley’s\r\n    Inquiry, vol. ii. between page 730 and page 731.]\r\n\r\nThough it is by no means unlikely that Durer might apply to the Venetian\r\ngovernment to prevent the sale of spurious copies of his works within\r\nthe bounds of their jurisdiction, yet Vasari’s account of his personally\r\nvisiting that city for the purpose of making a complaint against Marc\r\nAntonio, and of the government having forbid the latter to affix Durer’s\r\nmark to his engravings in future, is certainly incorrect. The History of\r\nthe Virgin, the earliest of the two works which were almost entirely\r\ncopied by Marc Antonio, was not published before 1510, and there is not\r\nthe slightest evidence of Durer having re-visited Venice after his\r\nreturn to Nuremberg about the latter end of 1506. Bartsch thinks that\r\nVasari’s account of Durer’s complaining to the Venetian government\r\nagainst Marc Antonio is wholly unfounded; not only from the fact of\r\nDurer not having visited Venice subsequent to 1506, but from the\r\nimprobability of his applying to a foreign state to prohibit a stranger\r\nfrom copying his works. Mr. Ottley, however,--after observing that Marc\r\nAntonio had affixed Durer’s mark to his copies of the seventeen cuts of\r\nthe Life of the Virgin and of some other single subjects, but had\r\nomitted it in his copies of the cuts of the Little Passion,--thus\r\nexpresses his opinion with respect to the correctness of this part of\r\nVasari’s account: “That Durer, who enjoyed the especial protection of\r\nthe Emperor Maximilian, might be enabled through the imperial ambassador\r\nat Venice to lay his complaints before the government, and to obtain the\r\nprohibition before stated, may I think readily be imagined; and it\r\ncannot be denied, that the circumstance of Marc Antonio’s having omitted\r\nto affix the mark of Albert to the copies which he afterwards made of\r\nthe series of the ‘Life of Christ’ is strongly corroborative of the\r\ngeneral truth of the story.”[V-28] As two of the cuts in the Little\r\nPassion, which Mr. Ottley here calls the “Life of Christ,” are dated\r\n1510, and as, according to Mr. Ottley, Marc Antonio arrived at Rome in\r\nthe course of that year, it is difficult to conceive how the government\r\nof Venice could have the power to prohibit a native of Bologna, living\r\nin a state beyond their jurisdiction, from affixing Albert Durer’s mark\r\nto such engravings as he might please to copy from the works of that\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-28: Inquiry into the Origin and Early History of\r\n    Engraving, vol. ii. p. 782. The objections to the general truth of\r\n    Vasari’s story appear to be much stronger than the presumptions in\r\n    its favour. 1. The improbability of Albert Durer having visited\r\n    Venice subsequent to 1506; 2. The fact of Marc Antonio’s copies of\r\n    the cuts of the Little Passion _not_ containing Albert Durer’s\r\n    mark; and 3. The probability of Mark Antonio residing beyond the\r\n    jurisdiction of the Venetian government at the time of his\r\n    engraving them.]\r\n\r\nAmong the more remarkable single subjects engraved on wood from Durer’s\r\ndesigns, the following are most frequently referred to: God the Father\r\nbearing up into heaven the dead body of Christ, with the date 1511;\r\na Rhinoceros, with the date 1515; a portrait of Ulrich Varnbuler, with\r\nthe date 1522; a large head of Christ crowned with thorns, without date;\r\nand the Siege of a fortified town, with the date 1527. In the first of\r\nthe above-named cuts, God the Father wears a kind of tiara like that of\r\nthe Pope, and above the principal figure the Holy Ghost is seen hovering\r\nin the form of a dove. On each side of the Deity and the dead Christ are\r\nangels holding the cross, the pillar to which Christ was bound when he\r\nwas scourged, the crown of thorns, the sponge dipped in vinegar, and\r\nother emblems of the Passion. At the foot are heads with puffed-out\r\ncheeks intended to represent the winds. This cut is engraved in a\r\nclearer and more delicate style than most of the other subjects designed\r\nby Durer on wood. There are impressions of the Rhinoceros, and the\r\nportrait of Varnbuler, printed in chiaro-scuro from three blocks; and\r\nthere are also other wood-cuts designed by Durer executed in the same\r\nmanner. The large head of Christ, which is engraved in a coarse though\r\nspirited and effective manner, is placed by Bartsch among the doubtful\r\npieces ascribed to Durer; but Mr. Ottley says, “I am unwilling to deny\r\nto Durer the credit of this admirable and boldly executed\r\nproduction.”[V-29] The cut representing the siege of a fortified town is\r\ntwenty-eight inches and three-eighths wide, by eight inches and seven\r\neighths high. It has been engraved on two blocks, and afterwards pasted\r\ntogether. A number of small figures are introduced, and a great extent\r\nof country is shown in this cut, which is, however, deficient in effect;\r\nand the little figures, though drawn with great spirit, want relief,\r\nwhich causes many of them to appear as if they were riding or walking in\r\nthe air. The most solid-like part of the subject is the sky; there is no\r\nground for most of the figures to stand on; and those which are in the\r\ndistance are of the same size as those which are apparently a mile or\r\ntwo nearer the spectator. There is nothing remarkable in the execution,\r\nand the design adds nothing to Durer’s reputation.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-29: There is a copy of this head, also engraved on\r\n    wood, of the size of the original, but without Durer’s, or any\r\n    other mark. Underneath an impression of the copy, in the Print\r\n    Room of the British Museum, there is written in a hand which\r\n    appears to be at least as old as the year 1550, “Dieser hat\r\n    [[HSB]]ehaim gerissen”--“H. S. Behaim drew this.” Hans Sebald\r\n    Behaim, a painter and designer on wood, was born at Nuremberg in\r\n    1500, and was the pupil of his uncle, also named Behaim, a painter\r\n    and engraver of that city. The younger Behaim abandoned the arts\r\n    to become a tavern-keeper at Frankfort, where he died in 1550.]\r\n\r\nThe great patron of wood engraving in the earlier part of the sixteenth\r\ncentury was the Emperor Maximilian I, who,--besides originating the\r\nthree works, known by the titles of Sir Theurdank, the Wise King, and\r\nthe Triumphs of Maximilian, which he caused to be illustrated with\r\nnumerous wood engravings, chiefly from the designs of Hans Burgmair and\r\nHans Schaufflein,--employed Albert Durer to make the designs for two\r\nother series of wood engravings, a Triumphal Car and a Triumphal Arch.\r\n\r\nThe Triumphal _Car_, engraved by Jerome Resch from Durer’s drawings on\r\nwood, is frequently confounded with the larger work called the Triumphs\r\nof Maximilian, most of the designs of which were made by Hans Burgmair.\r\nIt is indeed generally asserted that all the designs for the latter work\r\nwere made by Hans Burgmair; but I think I shall be able to show, in a\r\nsubsequent notice of that work, that some of the cuts contained in the\r\nedition published at Vienna and London in 1796 were, in all probability,\r\ndesigned by Albert Durer. The Triumphal Car consists of eight separate\r\npieces, which, when joined together, form a continuous subject seven\r\nfeet four inches long; the height of the highest cut--that containing\r\nthe car--is eighteen inches from the base line to the upper part of the\r\ncanopy above the Emperor’s head. The Emperor is seen seated in a highly\r\nornamented car, attended by female figures, representing Justice, Truth,\r\nClemency, and other virtues, who hold towards him triumphal wreaths. One\r\nof the two wheels which are seen is inscribed “Magnificentia,” and the\r\nother “Dignitas;” the driver of the car is Reason,--“Ratio,”--and one of\r\nthe reins is marked “Nobilitas,” and the other “Potentia.” The car is\r\ndrawn by six pair of horses splendidly harnessed, and each horse is\r\nattended by a female figure. The names of the females at the head of the\r\nfirst pair from the car are “Providentia” and “Moderatio;” of the\r\nsecond, “Alacritas” and “Opportunitas;” of the third, “Velocitas” and\r\n“Firmitudo;” of the fourth, “Acrimonia” and “Virilitas;” of the fifth,\r\n“Audacia” and “Magnanimitas;” and the attendants on the leaders are\r\n“Experientia” and “Solertia.” Above each pair of horses there is a\r\nportion of explanatory matter printed in letter-press; and in that above\r\nthe leading pair is a mandate from the Emperor Maximilian, dated\r\nInspruck, 1518, addressed to Bilibald Pirkheimer, who appears to have\r\nsuggested the subject; and in the same place is the name of the inventor\r\nand designer, Albert Durer.[V-30] The first edition of those cuts\r\nappeared at Nuremberg in 1522; and in some copies the text is in German,\r\nand in others in Latin. A second edition, with the text in Latin only,\r\nwas printed at the same place in the following year. A third edition,\r\nfrom the same blocks, was printed at Venice in 1588; and a fourth at\r\nAmsterdam in 1609. The execution of this subject is not particularly\r\ngood, but the action of the horses is generally well represented, and\r\nthe drawing of some of the female figures attending them is extremely\r\nspirited. Guido seems to have availed himself of some of the figures in\r\nDurer’s Triumphal Car in his celebrated fresco of the Car of Apollo,\r\npreceded by Aurora, and accompanied by the Hours.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-30: In the edition with Latin inscriptions, 1523, are\r\n    the words, “Excogitatus et depictus est currus iste Nurembergæ,\r\n    impressus vero per Albertum Durer. Anno MDXXIII.” The Latin words\r\n    “excogitatus et depictus” are expressed by “gefunden und geordnet”\r\n    in the German inscriptions in the edition of 1522. A sketch by\r\n    Durer, for the Triumphal Car, is preserved in the Print Room in\r\n    the British Museum.]\r\n\r\nIt is said that the same subject painted by Durer himself is still to be\r\nseen on the walls of the Town-hall of Nuremberg; but how far this is\r\ncorrect I am unable to positively say; for I know of no account of the\r\npainting written by a person who appears to have been acquainted with\r\nthe subject engraved on wood. Dr. Dibdin, who visited the Town-hall of\r\nNuremberg in 1818, speaks of what he saw there in a most vague and\r\nunsatisfactory manner, as if he did not know the Triumphal Car designed\r\nby Durer from the larger work entitled the Triumphs of Maximilian. The\r\nnotice of the learned bibliographer, who professes to be a great admirer\r\nof the works of Albert Durer, is as follows: “The great boast of the\r\ncollection [in the Town-hall of Nuremberg] are the Triumphs of\r\nMaximilian executed by _Albert Durer_,--which, however, have by no means\r\nescaped injury.”[V-31] It is from such careless observations as the\r\npreceding that erroneous opinions respecting the Triumphal Car and the\r\nTriumphs of Maximilian are continued and propagated, and that most\r\npersons confound the two works; which is indeed not surprising, seeing\r\nthat Dr. Dibdin himself, who is considered to be an authority on such\r\nmatters, has afforded proof that he does not know one from the other. In\r\nthe same volume that contains the notice of the “Triumphs of Maximilian”\r\nin the Town-hall of Nuremberg, Dr. Dibdin says that he saw the “ORIGINAL\r\nPAINTINGS” from which the large wood blocks were taken for the\r\nwell-known work entitled the “_Triumphs of the Emperor Maximilian_,” in\r\nlarge folio, in the Imperial Library at Vienna.[V-32] Such observations\r\nare very much in the style of the countryman’s, who had seen _two_\r\ngenuine skulls of Oliver Cromwell,--one at Oxford, and another in the\r\nBritish Museum. Though I have not been able to ascertain satisfactorily\r\nthe subject of Durer’s painting in the Town-hall of Nuremberg, I am\r\ninclined to think that it is the Triumphal _Car_ of Maximilian. In a\r\nmemorandum in the hand-writing of Nollekins, preserved with his copies\r\nof Durer’s Triumphal Car and Triumphal Arch of Maximilian, in the Print\r\nRoom of the British Museum, it is said, though erroneously, that the\r\nformer is painted in the Town-hall of _Augsburg_ with the figures as\r\nlarge as life.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-31: Bibliographical Tour, vol. iii. p. 438. Edit.\r\n    1829.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-32: Ibid. p. 330.]\r\n\r\nThe Triumphal _Arch_ of the Emperor Maximilian, engraved on wood from\r\nDurer’s designs, consists of ninety-two separate pieces, which, when\r\njoined together, form one large composition about ten feet and a half\r\nhigh by nine and a half wide, exclusive of the margins and five folio\r\nsheets of explanatory matter by the projector of the design, John\r\nStabius, who styles himself the historiographer and poet of the Emperor,\r\nand who says, at the commencement of his description, that this arch was\r\ndrawn “after the manner of those erected in honour of the Roman emperors\r\nat Rome, some of which are destroyed and others still to be seen.” In\r\nthe arch of Maximilian are three gates or entrances; that in the centre\r\nis named the Gate of Honour and Power; that to the left the Gate of\r\nFame; and that to the right the Gate of Nobility.[V-33] Above the middle\r\nentrance is what Stabius calls the “grand tower,” surmounted with the\r\nimperial crown, and containing an inscription in German to the memory of\r\nMaximilian. Above and on each side of the gates or entrances, which are\r\nof very small dimensions, are portraits of the Roman emperors from the\r\ntime of Julius Cæsar to that of Maximilian himself; there are also\r\nportraits of his ancestors, and of kings and princes with whom he was\r\nallied either by friendship or marriage; shields of arms illustrative of\r\nhis descent or of the extent of his sovereignty; with representations of\r\nhis most memorable actions, among which his adventures in the Tyrolean\r\nAlps, when hunting the chamois, are not forgotten. Underneath each\r\nsubject illustrative of his own history are explanatory verses, in the\r\nGerman language, engraved on wood; and the names of the kings and\r\nemperors, as well as the inscriptions explanatory of other parts of the\r\nsubject, are also executed in the same manner. The whole subject is, in\r\nfact, a kind of pictorial epitome of the history of the German empire;\r\nrepresenting the succession of the Roman emperors, and the more\r\nremarkable events of Maximilian’s own reign; with illustrations of his\r\ndescent, possessions, and alliances.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-33: The two last names are, in the first edition,\r\n    pasted over others which appear to have been “The Gate of Honour”\r\n    and “The Gate of Relationship, Friendship, and Alliance.” The last\r\n    name alludes to the emperor’s possessions as acquired by descent\r\n    or marriage, and to his power as strengthened by his friendly\r\n    alliances with neighbouring states.]\r\n\r\nAt the time of Maximilian’s death, which happened in 1519, this great\r\nwork was not finished; and it is said that Durer himself did not live to\r\nsee it completed, as one small block remained to be engraved at the\r\nperiod of his death, in 1528. At whatever time the work might be\r\nfinished, it certainly was commenced at least four years before the\r\nEmperor’s death, for the date 1515 occurs in two places at the foot of\r\nthe subject. Though Durer’s mark is not to be found on any one of the\r\ncuts, there can be little doubt of his having furnished the designs for\r\nthe whole. In the ninth volume of Von Murr’s Journal it is stated that\r\nDurer received a hundred guilders a year from the Emperor,--probably on\r\naccount of this large work; and in the same volume there is a letter of\r\nDurer’s addressed to a friend, requesting him to apply to the emperor on\r\naccount of arrears due to him. In this letter he says that he has made\r\nmany drawings besides the “_Tryumps_”[V-34] for the emperor; and as he\r\nalso thrice mentions Stabius, the inventor of the Triumphal Arch, there\r\ncan be little doubt but that this was the work to which he alludes.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-34: “Item wist auch das Ich K. Mt. ausserhalb des\r\n    Tryumps sonst viel mancherley Fisyrung gemacht hab.”--“You must\r\n    also know that I have made many other drawings for the emperor\r\n    besides those of the Triumph.” The date of this letter is not\r\n    given, but Durer informs his friend that he had been already three\r\n    years employed for the emperor, and that if he had not exerted\r\n    himself the beautiful “work” would not have been so soon\r\n    completed. If this is to be understood of the Triumphal Arch, it\r\n    would seem that the designs at least were all finished before the\r\n    emperor’s death.--Von Murr, Journal, 9er Theil, S. 4.]\r\n\r\nAs a work of art the best single subjects of the Triumphal Arch will not\r\nbear a comparison with the best cuts in Durer’s Apocalypse, the History\r\nof the Virgin, or Christ’s Passion; and there are several in which no\r\ntrace of his effective style of drawing on wood is to be found. Most of\r\nthe subjects illustrative of the emperor’s battles and adventures are in\r\nparticular meagre in point of drawing, and deficient in effect. The\r\nwhole composition indeed appears like the result of continued\r\napplication without much display of talent. The powers of Durer had been\r\nevidently constrained to work out the conceptions of the historiographer\r\nand poet, Stabius; and as the subjects were not the suggestions of the\r\nartist’s own feelings, it cannot be a matter of surprise that we should\r\nfind in them so few traces of his genius. The engraving of the cuts is\r\nclear, but not generally effective; and the execution of the whole, both\r\nfigures and letters, would occupy a single wood engraver not less than\r\nfour years; even allowing him to engrave more rapidly on pear-tree than\r\na modern wood engraver does on box; and supposing him to be a master of\r\nhis profession.\r\n\r\nFrom his varied talents and the excellence which he displayed in every\r\nbranch of art that he attempted, Albert Durer is entitled to rank with\r\nthe most extraordinary men of his age. As a painter he may be considered\r\nas the father of the German school; while for his fidelity in copying\r\nnature and the beauty of his colours he may bear a comparison with most\r\nof the Italian artists of his own age. As an engraver on copper he\r\ngreatly excelled all who preceded him; and it is highly questionable if\r\nany artist since his time, except Rembrandt, has painted so many good\r\npictures and engraved so many good copper-plates. But besides excelling\r\nas an engraver on copper after the manner in which the art had been\r\npreviously practised, giving to his subjects a breadth of light and a\r\ndepth of shade which is not to be found in the productions of the\r\nearlier masters, he further improved the art by the invention of\r\netching,[V-35] which enables the artist to work with greater freedom and\r\nto give a variety and an effect to his subjects, more especially\r\nlandscapes, which are utterly unattainable by means of the graver alone.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-35: In the process of etching the plate is first\r\n    covered with a resinous composition--called etching ground--on\r\n    which the lines intended to be _etched_, or bit into the plate,\r\n    are drawn through to the surface of the metal by means of a small\r\n    pointed tool called an etching needle, or an etching point. When\r\n    the drawing of the subject upon the etching ground is finished,\r\n    the plate is surrounded with a slightly raised border, or “wall,”\r\n    as it is technically termed, formed of rosin, bee’s-wax, and lard;\r\n    and, a corrosive liquid being poured upon the plate, the lines are\r\n    “bit” into the copper or steel. When the engraver thinks that the\r\n    lines are corroded to a sufficient depth, he pours off the liquid,\r\n    cleans the plate by means of turpentine, and proceeds to finish\r\n    his work with the graver and dry-point. According to the practice\r\n    of modern engravers, where several _tints_ are required, as is\r\n    most frequently the case, the process of “biting-in” is repeated;\r\n    the corrosive liquid being again poured on the plate to corrode\r\n    deeper the stronger lines, while the more delicate are “stopped\r\n    out,”--that is, covered with a kind of varnish that soon hardens,\r\n    to preserve them from further corrosion. Most of our best\r\n    engravers now use a diamond point in etching. _Nitrous_ acid is\r\n    used for “biting-in” on copper in the proportion of one part acid\r\n    to four parts water, and the mixture is considered to be better\r\n    after it has been once or twice used. Before using the acid it is\r\n    advisable to take the stopper out of the bottle for twenty-four\r\n    hours in order to allow a portion of the strength to evaporate.\r\n    During the process of biting-in a large copper-plate the fumes\r\n    which arise are so powerful as frequently to cause an unpleasant\r\n    stricture in the throat, and sometimes to bring on a spitting of\r\n    blood when they have been incautiously inhaled by the engraver. At\r\n    such times it is usual for the engraver to have near him some\r\n    powerful essence, generally hartshorn, in order to counteract the\r\n    effects of the noxious vapour. For biting-in on steel, _nitric_\r\n    acid is used in the proportion of thirty drops to half a pint of\r\n    distilled water; and the mixture is never used for more than one\r\n    plate.--When a _copper_-plate is sufficiently bit-in, it is only\r\n    necessary to wash it with a little water previous to removing the\r\n    etching ground with turpentine; but, besides this, with a _steel_\r\n    plate it is further necessary to set it on one of its edges\r\n    against a wall or other support, and to blow it with a pair of\r\n    small bellows till every particle of moisture in the lines is\r\n    perfectly evaporated. The plate is then rubbed with oil, otherwise\r\n    the lines would rust from the action of the atmosphere and the\r\n    plate be consequently spoiled. Previous to a steel plate being\r\n    laid aside for any length of time it ought to be warmed, and the\r\n    engraved surface rubbed carefully over with virgin wax so that it\r\n    may be completely covered, and every line filled. A piece of thick\r\n    paper the size of the plate, laid over the wax while it is yet\r\n    adhesive, will prove an additional safeguard. For this information\r\n    respecting the process of biting-in, the writer is indebted to an\r\n    eminent engraver, Mr. J. T. Wilmore.]\r\n\r\nThere are two subjects by Albert Durer, dated 1512, which Bartsch thinks\r\nwere etched upon plates of iron, but which Mr. Ottley considers to have\r\nbeen executed upon plates of a softer metal than copper, with the\r\ndry-point. There are, however, two undoubted etchings by Durer with the\r\ndate 1515; two others executed in the same manner are dated 1516; and a\r\nfifth, a landscape with a large cannon in the fore-ground to the left,\r\nis dated 1518. There is another undoubted etching by Durer, representing\r\nnaked figures in a bath; but it contains neither his mark nor a date.\r\nThe three pieces which Mr. Ottley thinks were not etched, but executed\r\non some soft kind of metal with the dry-point, are: 1. The figure of\r\nChrist, seen in front, standing, clothed with a mantle, having his hands\r\ntied together, and on his head a crown of thorns; date 1512. 2. St.\r\nJerome seated amongst rocks, praying to a crucifix, with a book open\r\nbefore him, and a lion below to the left; date 1512. 3. The Virgin,\r\nseated with the infant Christ in her lap, and seen in front, with St.\r\nJoseph behind her on the left, and on the right three other figures;\r\nwithout mark or date.--One of the more common of Durer’s undoubted\r\netchings is that of a man mounted on a unicorn, and carrying off a naked\r\nwoman, with the date 1516.\r\n\r\nAlbert Durer not only excelled as a painter, an engraver on copper, and\r\na designer on wood, but he also executed several pieces of sculpture\r\nwith surprising delicacy and natural expression of character. An\r\nadmirable specimen of his skill in this department of art is preserved\r\nin the British Museum, to which institution it was bequeathed by the\r\nlate R. Payne Knight, Esq., by whom it was purchased at Brussels for\r\nfive hundred guineas upwards of forty years ago. This most exquisite\r\npiece of sculpture is of small dimensions, being only seven and three\r\nquarter inches high, by five and a half wide. It is executed in\r\nhone-stone, of a cream colour, and is all of one piece, with the\r\nexception of a dog and one or two books in front. The subject is the\r\nnaming of John the Baptist.[V-36] In front, to the right, is an old man\r\nwith a tablet inscribed with Hebrew characters; another old man is seen\r\nimmediately behind him, further to the right; and a younger man,--said\r\nto be intended by the artist for a portrait of himself,--appears\r\nentering the door of the apartment. An old woman with the child in her\r\narms is seated near the figure with the tablet; St. Elizabeth is\r\nperceived lying in bed, on the more distant side of which a female\r\nattendant is standing, and on the other, nearer to the spectator, an\r\nelderly man is seen kneeling. It is supposed that the latter figure is\r\nintended for Zacharias, and that the artist had represented him in the\r\nact of making signs to Elizabeth with his hands. The figures in the\r\nfore-ground are executed in high relief, and the character and\r\nexpression of the heads have perhaps never been surpassed in any work of\r\nsculpture executed on the same scale. Durer’s mark is perceived on a\r\ntablet at the foot of the bed, with the date 1510. This curious specimen\r\nof Durer’s talents as a sculptor is carefully preserved in a frame with\r\na glass before it, and is in most perfect condition, with the exception\r\nof the hands of Zacharias and of Elizabeth, some of the fingers of which\r\nare broken off.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-36: The account of the naming of John the Baptist will\r\n    be found in St. Luke’s Gospel, chap. i. verse 59-64.]\r\n\r\nShortly after Whitsuntide, 1520, Durer set out from Nuremberg,\r\naccompanied by his wife and her servant Susanna, on a visit to the\r\nNetherlands; and as he took with him several copies of his principal\r\nworks, engravings on copper as well as on wood, and painted and drew a\r\nnumber of portraits during his residence there, the journey appears to\r\nhave been taken as much with a view to business as pleasure. He kept a\r\njournal from the time of his leaving Nuremberg till the period of his\r\nreaching Cologne on his return, and from this curious record of the\r\nartist’s travels the following particulars of his visit to the\r\nNetherlands have been obtained.[V-37]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-37: Durer’s Journal of his Travels is given by Von\r\n    Murr, 7er Theil, S. 55-98. The title which the Editor has prefixed\r\n    to it is, “Reisejournal Albrecht Dürer’s von seiner\r\n    Niederländischen Reise, 1520 und 1521. E. Bibliotheca Ebneriana.”\r\n    In the same volume, Von Murr gives some specimens of Durer’s\r\n    poetry. The first couplet which he made in 1509 is as follows:\r\n\r\n      “Du aller Engel Spiegel und Erlöser der Welt,\r\n      Deine grosse Marter sey für mein Sünd ein Widergelt.”\r\n\r\n      Thou mirror of all Angels and Redeemer of mankind,\r\n      Through thy martyrdom, for all my sins may I a ransom find.\r\n\r\n    This couplet being ridiculed by Bilibald Pirkheimer, who said that\r\n    rhyming verses ought not to consist of more than eight syllables,\r\n    Durer wrote several others in a shorter measure, but with no\r\n    better success; for he says at the conclusion, that they did not\r\n    please the learned counsellor. With Durer’s rhymes there is an\r\n    epistle in verse from his friend Lazarus Sprengel, written to\r\n    dissuade him from attempting to become a poet. Durer’s verses want\r\n    “the right butter-woman’s trot to market,” and are sadly deficient\r\n    in rhythm when compared with the more regular clink of his\r\n    friend’s.]\r\n\r\nDurer proceeded from Nuremberg direct to Bamberg, where he presented to\r\nthe bishop a painting of the Virgin, with a copy of the Apocalypse and\r\nthe Life of the Virgin engraved on wood. The bishop invited Durer to his\r\ntable, and gave him a letter exempting his goods from toll, with three\r\nothers which were, most likely, letters of recommendation to persons of\r\ninfluence in the Netherlands.[V-38] From Bamberg, Durer proceeded by way\r\nof Eltman, Sweinfurth, and Frankfort to Mentz, and from the latter city\r\ndown the Rhine to Cologne. In this part of his journey he seems to have\r\nmet with little which he deemed worthy of remark: at Sweinfurth Dr.\r\nRebart made him a present of some wine; at Mentz, Peter Goldsmith’s\r\nlandlady presented him with two flasks of the same liquor; and when Veit\r\nVarnbuler invited him to dinner there, the tavern-keeper would not\r\nreceive any payment, but insisted on being Durer’s host himself. At\r\nLohnstein, on the Rhine, between Boppart and Coblentz, the\r\ntoll-collector, who was well acquainted with Durer’s wife, presented him\r\nwith a can of wine, and expressed himself extremely glad to see him.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-38: Subsequently, Durer mentions having delivered to\r\n    the Margrave John, at Brussels, a letter of recommendation\r\n    [Fürderbrief] from the Bishop of Bamberg.]\r\n\r\nFrom Cologne, Durer proceeded direct to Antwerp, where he took up his\r\nabode in the house of “Jobst Planckfelt;” and on the evening of his\r\narrival[V-39] he was invited to a splendid supper by Bernard Stecher, an\r\nagent of the Fuggers, the celebrated family of merchants of Nuremberg,\r\nand the most wealthy in Germany. On St. Oswald’s day, Sunday, 5th\r\nAugust, the Painters’ Company of Antwerp invited Durer, with his wife\r\nand her maid,[V-40] to a grand entertainment in their hall, which was\r\nornamented in a splendid manner, and all the vessels on the table were\r\nof silver. The wives of the painters were also present; and when Durer\r\nwas conducted to his seat at the table “all the company stood up on each\r\nside, as if some great lord had been making his entrance.” Several\r\nhonourable persons, who had also been invited, bowed to him; and all\r\nexpressed their respect and their wishes to afford him pleasure. While\r\nhe was at table the messenger of the magistrates of Antwerp made his\r\nappearance, and presented him in their name with four flaggons of wine,\r\nsaying, that the magistrates thus testified their respect and their\r\ngood-will towards him. Durer, as in duty bound, returned thanks, and\r\ntendered to the magisterial body his humble service. After this little\r\naffair was despatched, entered Peter the city carpenter _in propria\r\npersona_, and presented Durer with two more flaggons of wine, and\r\ncomplimented him with the offer of his services. After the party had\r\nenjoyed themselves cheerfully till late in the night, they attended\r\nDurer to his lodgings with torches in a most honourable manner,\r\nexpressing their good-will towards him, and their readiness to assist\r\nhim in whatever manner he might choose.--Shortly after this grand\r\nFellowship-feast, Durer was entertained by Quintin Matsys,--frequently\r\ncalled the Blacksmith of Antwerp,--whose celebrated picture of the\r\nMisers is now in the Royal Collection at Windsor.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-39: As Durer was at Cologne about the 26th July, it is\r\n    probable that he would arrive at Antwerp about the last day of\r\n    that month.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-40: The maid, Susanna, seems to have been rather a\r\n    “humble friend” than a menial servant; for she is mentioned in\r\n    another part of the Journal as being entertained with Durer’s wife\r\n    at the house of “Tomasin Florianus,” whom Durer describes as\r\n    “_Romanus_, von Luca bürtig.”]\r\n\r\nOn the Sunday after the Assumption,[V-41] Durer witnessed a grand\r\nprocession in honour of the Virgin, and the account which he has given\r\nof it presents so curious a picture of the old religious pageantries\r\nthat it appears worthy of being translated without abridgement. “On the\r\nSunday after the Assumption of our Lady,” says the artist, “I saw the\r\ngrand procession from our Lady’s church at Antwerp, where all the\r\ninhabitants of the city assembled, gentry as well as trades-people,\r\neach, according to his rank, gayly dressed. Every class and fellowship\r\nwas distinguished by its proper badge; and large and valuable crosses\r\nwere borne before several of the crafts. There were also silver trumpets\r\nof the old Frankish fashion; with German drums and fifes playing loudly.\r\nI also saw in the street, marching after each other in rank, at a\r\ncertain distance, the Goldsmiths, the Painters, the Masons, the\r\nEmbroiderers, the Statuaries, the Cabinet-makers, the Carpenters, the\r\nSailors, the Fishermen, the Butchers, the Curriers, the Weavers, the\r\nBakers, the Tailors, the Shoemakers, and all kinds of craftsmen with\r\nlabourers engaged in producing the necessaries of life. In the same\r\nmanner came the Shopkeepers and Merchants with their assistants. After\r\nthese came the Shooters, with firelocks, bows, and cross-bows, some on\r\nhorseback and some on foot; and after them came the City Guard. These\r\nwere followed by persons of the higher classes and the magistrates, all\r\ndressed in their proper habits; and after them came a gallant troop\r\narrayed in a noble and splendid manner. In this procession were a number\r\nof females of a religious order who subsist by means of their labour,\r\nall clothed in white from head to foot, and forming a very pleasing\r\nsight. After them came a number of gallant persons and the canons of our\r\nLady’s church, with all the clergy and scholars, followed by a grand\r\ndisplay of characters. Twenty men carried the Virgin and Christ, most\r\nrichly adorned, to the honour of God. In this part of the procession\r\nwere a number of delightful things, represented in a splendid manner.\r\nThere were several waggons in which were representations of ships and\r\nfortifications. Then came a troop of characters from the Prophets in\r\nregular order, followed by others from the New Testament, such as the\r\nAnnunciation, the Wise Men of the East, riding on great camels and other\r\nwonderful animals, and the Flight into Egypt, all very skilfully\r\nappointed. Then came a great dragon, and St. Margaret, with the image of\r\nthe Virgin at her girdle, exceedingly beautiful; and last St. George and\r\nhis squire. In this troop rode a number of boys and girls very\r\nhandsomely arrayed in various costumes, representing so many saints.\r\nThis procession, from beginning to end, was upwards of two hours in\r\npassing our house; and there were so many things to be seen, that I\r\ncould never describe them all even in a book.”[V-42]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-41: The Assumption of the Virgin is celebrated in the\r\n    Roman Catholic Church on the 15th August.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-42: Albrecht Dürer’s Reisejournal, in Von Murr, 7er\r\n    Theil, S. 63-65.]\r\n\r\nThough Durer chiefly resided at Antwerp during his stay in the\r\nNetherlands, he did not entirely confine himself to that city, but\r\noccasionally visited other places. On the 2nd of September 1520, he left\r\nAntwerp for Brussels, proceeding by way of Malines and Vilvorde. When at\r\nBrussels, he saw a number of valuable curiosities which had been sent to\r\nthe Emperor from Mexico, among which he enumerates a golden sun,\r\na fathom broad, and a silver moon of the same size, with weapons,\r\narmour, and dresses, and various other admirable things of great beauty\r\nand cost. He says that their value was estimated at a hundred thousand\r\nguilders; and that he never saw any thing that pleased him so much in\r\nhis life. Durer was evidently fond of seeing sights; he speaks with\r\ndelight of the fountains, the labyrinths, and the parks in the\r\nneighbourhood of the Royal Palace, which he says were like Paradise; and\r\namong the wonders which he saw at Brussels, he notices a large fish-bone\r\nwhich was almost a fathom in circumference and weighed fifteen\r\n“centner;”[V-43] a great bed that would hold fifty men; and a stone\r\nwhich fell from the sky in a thunder-storm in presence of the Count of\r\nNassau. He also mentions having seen at Antwerp the bones of a giant who\r\nhad been eighteen feet high. Durer and his wife seem to have had a taste\r\nfor zoology: Herr Lazarus Von Ravenspurg complimented him with a monkey;\r\nand “Signor Roderigo,” a Portuguese, presented his ill-tempered spouse\r\nwith a green parrot.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-43: This “gross Fischpein” was probably part of the\r\n    back-bone of a whale.]\r\n\r\nWhen at Brussels, Durer painted the portrait of the celebrated Erasmus,\r\nfrom whom, previous to leaving Antwerp, he had received as a present a\r\nSpanish mantle and three portraits. He remained about a week at\r\nBrussels, during which time he drew or painted seven portraits; and in\r\nhis Journal he makes the following memorandum: “Item, six persons whose\r\nlikenesses I have taken at Brussels, have not given me anything.” Among\r\nthose portraits was that of Bernard Van Orley, an eminent Flemish\r\npainter who had studied under Raffaele, and who at that time held the\r\noffice of painter to the Archduchess Margaret, regent of the\r\nNetherlands, and aunt of the Emperor Charles V. When at Brussels, Durer\r\nbought for a stiver[V-44] two copies of the “Eulenspiegel,” a celebrated\r\nengraving by Lucas Van Leyden, now of very great rarity.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-44: The stiver was the twenty-fourth part of a guilder\r\n    or florin of gold, which was equal to about nine shillings English\r\n    money of the present time; the stiver would therefore be equal to\r\n    about four pence half-penny. About the same time, Durer sold a\r\n    copy of his Christ’s Passion, probably the large one, for twelve\r\n    stivers, and an impression of his copper-plate of Adam and Eve for\r\n    four stivers. Shortly after his first arrival at Antwerp, he sold\r\n    sixteen copies of the Little Passion for four guilders or florins;\r\n    and thirty-two copies of his larger works,--probably the\r\n    Apocalypse, the History of the Virgin, and the Great Passion,--for\r\n    eight florins, being at the rate of sixteen stivers for each copy.\r\n    He also sold six copies of the Passion engraved on copper at the\r\n    same price. He gave to his host a painting of the Virgin on\r\n    canvass to sell for two Rhenish florins. The sum that he received\r\n    for each portrait in pencil [the German is mit Kohlen, which is\r\n    literally charcoal], when the parties _did_ pay, appears to have\r\n    been a florin.]\r\n\r\nAfter remaining at Antwerp till the latter end of September, Durer\r\nproceeded to Aix-la-Chapelle, where, on the 23rd of October, he\r\nwitnessed the coronation of the Emperor Charles V. He afterwards\r\nproceeded to Cologne, where, on the Sunday after All Saints’ day, he saw\r\na grand banquet and dance given by the emperor, from whom, on the Monday\r\nafter Martinmas day, he received the appointment of court-painter to his\r\nImperial Majesty. When at Cologne, Durer bought a copy of the\r\n“Condemnation of that good man, Martin Luther, for a white-penny.” This\r\nCondemnation was probably a copy of the bull of excommunication issued\r\nagainst Luther by Pope Leo X. on 20th June 1520. In a day or two after\r\nreceiving his appointment, Durer left Cologne and proceeded down the\r\nRhine, and visited Nimeguen. He then went to Bois-le-duc, where he was\r\nentertained by Arnold de Beer, a painter of considerable reputation in\r\nhis day, and treated with great respect by the goldsmiths of the place.\r\nOn the Thursday after the Presentation of the Virgin,[V-45]--21st\r\nNovember,--Durer again arrived at Antwerp. “In the seven weeks and\r\nupwards that I was absent,” he writes in his Journal, “my wife and her\r\nmaid spent seven gold crowns. The first had her pocket cut off in St.\r\nMary’s church on St. Mary’s day; there were two guilders in it.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-45: In Von Murr the words are “Am Donnerstage nach\r\n    Marien Himmelfahrt,”--On the Thursday after the _Assumption_ of\r\n    the Virgin. But this is evidently incorrect, the feast of the\r\n    Assumption being kept on 15th August. The “Marien Opferung”--the\r\n    Presentation of the Virgin--which is commemorated on 21st\r\n    November, is evidently meant.]\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of December, Durer left Antwerp on a short journey through\r\nZealand, proceeding by way of Bergen-op-Zoom. In the Abbey at Middleburg\r\nhe saw the great picture of the Descent from the Cross by Mabeuse; of\r\nwhich he remarks that “it is better painted than drawn.” When he was\r\nabout to land at Armuyden, a small town on the island of Walcheren, the\r\nrope broke, and a violent wind arising, the boat which he was in was\r\ndriven out to sea. Some persons, however, at length came to their\r\nassistance, and brought all the passengers safely ashore. On the Friday\r\nafter St. Lucia’s day he again returned to Antwerp, after having been\r\nabsent about twelve days.\r\n\r\nOn Shrove Tuesday, 1521, the company of goldsmiths invited Durer and his\r\nwife to a dinner, at which he was treated with great honour; and as this\r\nwas an early meal, he was enabled at night to attend a grand banquet to\r\nwhich he was invited by one of the chief magistrates of Antwerp. On the\r\nMonday after his entertainment by the goldsmiths he was invited to\r\nanother grand banquet which lasted two hours, and where he won, at some\r\nkind of game, two guilders of Bernard of Castile. Both at this and at\r\nthe magistrates’ banquet there was masquerading. At another\r\nentertainment given by Master Peter the Secretary, Durer and Erasmus\r\nwere present. He was not idle at this period of festivity, but drew\r\nseveral portraits in pencil. He also made a drawing for “Tomasin,” and a\r\npainting of St. Jerome for Roderigo of Portugal, who appears to have\r\nbeen one of the most liberal of all Durer’s Antwerp friends. Besides the\r\nlittle green parrot which he gave his wife, he also presented Durer with\r\none for himself; he also gave him a small cask of comfits, with various\r\nother sweetmeats, and specimens of the sugar-cane. He also made him a\r\npresent of cocoa-nuts and of several other things; and shortly before\r\nthe painting was finished, Signor Roderigo gave him two large pieces of\r\nPortuguese gold coin, each of which was worth ten ducats.\r\n\r\nOn the Saturday after Easter, Durer visited Bruges, where he saw in St.\r\nJames’s church some beautiful paintings by Hubert Van Eyck and Hugo\r\nVander Goes; and in the Painters’ chapel, and in other churches, he saw\r\nseveral by John Van Eyck; he also mentions having seen, in St. Mary’s\r\nchurch, an image of the Virgin in alabaster by Michael Angelo. The guild\r\nof painters invited him to a grand banquet in their hall. Two of the\r\nmagistrates, Jacob and Peter Mostaert, presented him with twelve\r\nflaggons of wine; and on the conclusion of the entertainment, all the\r\ncompany, amounting to sixty persons, accompanied him with torches to his\r\nlodgings. He next visited Ghent, where the company of painters also\r\ntreated him with great respect. He there saw, in St. John’s church, the\r\ncelebrated picture of the Elders worshipping the Lamb, from the\r\nRevelations, painted by John Van Eyck for Philip the Good, Duke of\r\nBurgundy. Durer thus expresses his opinion of it: “This is a well\r\nconceived and capital picture; the figures of Eve, the Virgin, and God\r\nthe Father, are, in particular, extremely good.” After being about a\r\nweek absent, he again returned to Antwerp, where he was shortly after\r\nseized with an intermitting fever, which was accompanied with a violent\r\nhead-ache and great sense of weariness. This illness, however, does not\r\nseem to have lasted very long; his fever commenced in the third week\r\nafter Easter, and on Rogation Sunday he attended the marriage feast of\r\n“Meister Joachim,”--probably Joachim Patenier, a landscape painter whom\r\nDurer mentions in an earlier part of his Journal.\r\n\r\nDurer was a man of strong religious feelings; and when Luther began to\r\npreach in opposition to the church of Rome, he warmly espoused his\r\ncause. The following passages from his Journal sufficiently demonstrate\r\nthe interest which he felt in the success of the great champion of the\r\nReformation. Luther on his return from Worms, where he had attended the\r\nDiet under a safe-conduct granted by the Emperor Charles V, was waylaid,\r\non 4th May 1521, by a party of armed men, who caused him to descend from\r\nthe light waggon in which he was travelling, and to follow them into an\r\nadjacent wood. His brother James, who was in the waggon with him, made\r\nhis escape on the first appearance of the horsemen. Luther having been\r\nsecured, the driver and others who were in the waggon were allowed to\r\npursue their journey without further hindrance. This secret apprehension\r\nof Luther was, in reality, contrived by his friend and supporter,\r\nFrederick, Elector of Saxony,[V-46] in order to withdraw him for a time\r\nfrom the apprehended violence of his enemies, whose hatred towards him\r\nhad been more than ever inflamed by the bold and undisguised statement\r\nof his opinions at Worms. Luther’s friends, being totally ignorant of\r\nthe elector’s design, generally supposed that the safe-conduct had been\r\ndisregarded by those whose duty it was to respect it, and that he had\r\nbeen betrayed and delivered into the hands of his enemies. Durer, on\r\nhearing of Luther’s apprehension, writes in his Journal as follows.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-46: Luther’s safe-conduct from Worms to Wittenberg was\r\n    limited to twenty-one days, at the expiration of which he was\r\n    declared to be under the ban of the empire, or, in other words, an\r\n    outlaw, to whom no prince or free city of Germany was to afford a\r\n    refuge. Luther, previous to leaving Worms, was informed of the\r\n    elector’s intention of secretly apprehending him on the road and\r\n    conveying him to a place of safety. After getting into the wood,\r\n    Luther was mounted on horseback, and conveyed to Wartburg,\r\n    a castle belonging to the elector, where he continued to live\r\n    disguised as a knight--Junker Jörge--till March 1522. Luther was\r\n    accustomed to call the castle of Wartburg his Patmos.]\r\n\r\n“On the Friday after Whitsuntide, 1521, I heard a report at Antwerp,\r\nthat Martin Luther had been treacherously seized; for the herald of the\r\nEmperor Charles, who attended him with a safe-conduct, and to whose\r\nprotection he was committed, on arriving at a lonely place near\r\nEisenach, said he durst proceed no further, and rode away. Immediately\r\nten horsemen made their appearance, and carried off the godly man thus\r\nbetrayed into their hands. He was indeed a man enlightened by the Holy\r\nGhost, and a follower of the true Christian faith. Whether he be yet\r\nliving, or whether his enemies have put him to death, I know not; yet\r\ncertainly what he has suffered has been for the sake of truth, and\r\nbecause he has reprehended the abuses of unchristian papacy, which\r\nstrives to fetter Christian liberty with the incumbrance of human\r\nordinances, that we may be robbed of the price of our blood and sweat,\r\nand shamefully plundered by idlers, while the sick and needy perish\r\nthrough hunger. Above all, it is especially distressing to me to think\r\nthat God may yet allow us to remain under the blind doctrine which those\r\nmen called ‘the fathers’ have imagined and set forth, whereby the\r\nprecious word is either in many places falsely expounded or not at all\r\nobserved.”[V-47]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-47: Durer, though an advocate of Luther, does not seem\r\n    to have withdrawn himself from the communion of the Church of\r\n    Rome. In his Journal, in 1521, he enters a sum of ten stivers\r\n    given to his confessor, and, subsequently, eight stivers given to\r\n    a monk who visited his wife when she was sick. The passage in\r\n    which the last item occurs is curious, and seems to prove that\r\n    female practitioners were then accustomed both to dispense and\r\n    administer medical preparations at Antwerp. “Meine Frau ward\r\n    krank,--der Apothekerinn für Klystiren gegeben 14 Stüber; dem\r\n    Mönch, der sie besuchte, 8 Stüber.”--Von Murr, Journal, 7er Theil,\r\n    S. 93.]\r\n\r\nAfter indulging in sundry pious invocations and reflections to the\r\nextent of two or three pages, Durer thus proceeds to lament the supposed\r\ndeath of Luther, and to invoke Erasmus to put his hand to the work from\r\nwhich he believed that Luther had been removed. “And is Luther dead? Who\r\nhenceforth will so clearly explain to us the Gospel? Alas! what might he\r\nnot have written for us in ten or twenty years? Aid me, all pious\r\nChristians, to bewail this man of heavenly mind, and to pray that God\r\nmay send us another as divinely enlightened. Where, O Erasmus, wilt thou\r\nremain? Behold, now, how the tyranny of might and the power of darkness\r\nprevail. Hear, thou champion of Christ! Ride forward, defend the truth,\r\nand deserve the martyr’s crown, for thou art already an old man.[V-48]\r\nI have heard from thy own mouth that thou hast allotted to thyself two\r\nyears yet of labour in which thou mightst still be able to produce\r\nsomething good; employ these well for the benefit of the Gospel and the\r\ntrue Christian faith: let then thy voice be heard, and so shall not the\r\nsee of Rome, the gates of Hell, as Christ saith, prevail against thee.\r\nAnd though, like thy master, thou shouldst bear the scorn of the liars,\r\nand even die a short time earlier than thou otherwise mightst, yet wilt\r\nthou therefore pass earlier from death unto eternal life and be\r\nglorified through Christ. If thou drinkest of the cup of which he drank,\r\nso wilt thou reign with him and pronounce judgment on those who have\r\nacted unrighteously.”[V-49]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-48: This inducement for Erasmus to stand forth as a\r\n    candidate for the honour of martyrdom is, in the original, as\r\n    simple in expression as it is novel in conception: “Du bist doch\r\n    sonst ein altes Menniken.” Literally: For thou art already an old\r\n    _mannikin_. Erasmus, however, was not a spirit to be charmed to\r\n    enter such a circle by such an invocation. As he said of himself,\r\n    “his gift did not lie that way,” and he had as little taste for\r\n    martyrdom as he had for fish.--In one or two other passages in\r\n    Durer’s Journal there is an allusion to the diminutive stature of\r\n    Erasmus.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-49: Von Murr, Journal, 7er Theil, S. 88-93. In volume\r\n    X, p. 41, Von Murr gives from Peucer, the son-in-law of\r\n    Melancthon, the following anecdote: “Melancthon, when at\r\n    Nuremberg, on church and university affairs, was much in the\r\n    society of Pirkheimer; and Albert Durer, the painter, an\r\n    intelligent man, whose least merit, as Melancthon used to say, was\r\n    his art, was frequently one of the party. Between Pirkheimer and\r\n    Durer there were frequent disputes respecting the recent\r\n    [religious] contest, in which Durer, as he was a man of strong\r\n    mind, vigorously opposed Pirkheimer, and refuted his arguments as\r\n    if he had come prepared for the discussion. Pirkheimer growing\r\n    warm, for he was very irritable and much plagued with the gout,\r\n    would sometimes exclaim “Not so:--these things cannot be\r\n    _painted_.”--“And the arguments which you allege,” Durer would\r\n    reply, “can neither be correctly expressed nor\r\n    comprehended.”--Whatever might have been the particular points in\r\n    dispute between the two friends, Pirkheimer, as well as Durer, was\r\n    a supporter of the doctrines of Luther.”]\r\n\r\nAbout this time a large wood-cut, of which the following is a reduced\r\ncopy, was published; and though the satire which it contains will apply\r\nequally to any monk who may be supposed to be an instrument of the\r\ndevil, it was probably directed against Luther in particular, as a\r\nteacher of false doctrine through the inspiration of the father of lies.\r\nIn the cut the arch-enemy, as a bag-piper, is seen blowing into the ear\r\nof a monk, whose head forms the “bag,” and by skilful fingering causing\r\nthe nose, elongated in the form of a “chanter,” to discourse sweet\r\nmusic. The preaching friars of former times were no less celebrated for\r\ntheir nasal melody than the “saints” in the days of Cromwell. A serious\r\nportrait of Luther, probably engraved or drawn on wood by Hans Baldung\r\nGrün, a pupil of Durer, was also published in 1521. It is printed in a\r\nquarto tract, entitled, “Acta et Res gestæ D. Martini Lutheri in\r\nComitiis Principum Vuormaciæ, Anno MDXXI,” and also in a tract, written\r\nby Luther himself in answer to Jerome Emser, without date, but probably\r\nprinted at Wittenberg about 1523. In this portrait, which bears\r\nconsiderable resemblance to the head forming the bag of Satan’s pipe,\r\nLuther appears as if meditating on a passage that he has just read in a\r\nvolume which he holds open; his head is surrounded with rays of glory;\r\nand the Holy Ghost, in the form of a dove, appears as if about to settle\r\non his shaven crown. In an impression now before me, some one,\r\napparently a contemporary, who thought that Luther’s inspiration was\r\nderived from another source, has with pen and ink transformed the dove\r\ninto one of those unclean things between bat and serpent, which are\r\nsupposed to be appropriate to the regions of darkness, and which are\r\ngenerally to be seen in paintings and engravings of the temptation of\r\nSt. Anthony.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nA week after Corpus Christi day[V-50] Durer left Antwerp for Malines,\r\nwhere the Archduchess Margaret, the aunt of the emperor Charles V, was\r\nthen residing. He took up his lodgings with Henry de Bles, a painter of\r\nconsiderable reputation, called Civetta by the Italians, from the owl\r\nwhich he painted as a mark in most of his pictures; and the painters and\r\nstatuaries, as at Antwerp and other places, invited him to an\r\nentertainment and treated him with great respect. He waited on the\r\narchduchess and showed her his portrait of the emperor, and would have\r\npresented it to her, but she would by no means accept of it;--probably\r\nbecause she could not well receive such a gift without making the artist\r\na suitable return, for it appears, from a subsequent passage in Durer’s\r\nJournal, that she had no particular objection to receive other works of\r\nart when they cost her nothing.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-50: Corpus Christi day is a moveable festival, and is\r\n    celebrated on the first Thursday after Trinity Sunday.]\r\n\r\nIn the course of a few days Durer returned to Antwerp, where he shortly\r\nafterwards saw Lucas Van Leyden, the celebrated painter and engraver,\r\nwhose plates at that time were by many considered nearly equal to his\r\nown. Durer’s brief notice of his talented contemporary is as follows:\r\n“Received an invitation from Master Lucas, who engraves on copper. He is\r\na little man, and a native of Leyden in Holland.” Subsequently he\r\nmentions having drawn Lucas’s portrait in crayons; and having exchanged\r\nsome of his own works to the value of eight florins for a complete set\r\nof Lucas’s engravings. Durer in this part of his Journal, after\r\nenumerating the portraits he had taken and the exchanges he had made\r\nsince his return from Malines to Antwerp, thus speaks of the manner in\r\nwhich he was rewarded: “In all my transactions in the Netherlands--for\r\nmy paintings, drawings, and in disposing of my works--both with high and\r\nlow I have had the disadvantage. The Lady Margaret, especially, for all\r\nthat I have given her and done for her, has not made me the least\r\nrecompense.”\r\n\r\nDurer now began to make preparations for his return home. He engaged a\r\nwaggoner to take him and his wife to Cologne; he exchanged a portrait of\r\nthe emperor for some white English cloth; and, on 1st July, he borrowed\r\nof Alexander Imhoff a hundred gold guilders to be repaid at Nuremberg;\r\nanother proof that Durer, though treated with great distinction in the\r\nLow Countries, had not derived much pecuniary advantage during the\r\nperiod of his residence there. On the 2nd July, when he was about to\r\nleave Antwerp, the King of Denmark, Christian II, who had recently\r\narrived in Flanders, sent for him to take his portrait. He first drew\r\nhis majesty with black chalk--mit der Kohlen--and afterwards went with\r\nhim to Brussels, where he appears to have painted his portrait in oil\r\ncolours, and for which he received thirty florins. At Brussels, on the\r\nSunday before St. Margaret’s Day,[V-51] the King of Denmark gave a grand\r\nbanquet to the Emperor and the Archduchess Margaret, to which Durer had\r\nthe honour of being invited, and failed not to attend. On the following\r\nFriday he left Brussels to return to Nuremberg, proceeding by way of\r\nAix-la-Chapelle to Cologne.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-51: St. Margaret’s day is the 20th July.]\r\n\r\nOut of a variety of other matters which Durer has mentioned in his\r\nJournal, the following--which could not be conveniently given in\r\nchronological order in the preceding abstract--may not, perhaps, be\r\nwholly uninteresting. He painted a portrait of one Nicholas, an\r\nastronomer, who was in the service of the King of England, and who was\r\nof great service to Durer on several occasions.[V-52] He gave one florin\r\nand eight stivers for wood, but whether for drawing on, or for fuel, is\r\nuncertain. He only mentions having made two drawings on wood during his\r\nresidence in the Low Countries, and both were of the arms of Von\r\nRogendorff, noticed at page 236. In one of those instances, he\r\ndistinctly says that he made the drawing, “_das man’s schneiden\r\nmag_”--that it may be engraved. The word “_man’s_” clearly shows that it\r\nwas to be engraved by another person.--He mentions that since Raffaele’s\r\ndeath his works are dispersed--“_verzogen_,”--and that one of that\r\nmaster’s pupils, by name “Thomas Polonier,” had called on him and made\r\nhim a present of an antique ring. In a subsequent passage he calls this\r\nperson “Thomas Polonius,” and says that he had given him a set of his\r\nworks to be sent to Rome and exchanged for “_Raphaelische\r\nSache_”--things by Raffaele.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-52: Durer says that this astronomer was a German, and\r\n    a native of Munich.]\r\n\r\nIt has been said, though without sufficient authority, that Durer, weary\r\nof a home where he was made miserable by his bad-tempered, avaricious\r\nwife, left Nuremberg, and visited the Low Countries alone for the\r\npurpose of avoiding her constant annoyance. There is, however, no\r\nevidence of Durer’s visiting the Low Countries previous to 1520, when he\r\nwas accompanied by his wife; nor is there any authentic record of his\r\never again visiting Flanders subsequent to the latter end of August\r\n1521, when he left Brussels to return to Nuremberg. In 1522, Durer\r\npublished the first edition of the Triumphal Car of the Emperor\r\nMaximilian, the designs for which had probably been made five or six\r\nyears before. One of the best portraits drawn by Durer on wood also\r\nbears the date 1522. It is that of his friend Ulrich Varnbuler,[V-53]--\r\nmentioned at page 253,--and is of large size, being about seventeen\r\ninches high by twelve and three-fourths wide. The head is full of\r\ncharacter, and the engraving is admirably executed. From 1522 to 1528,\r\nthe year of Durer’s death, he seems to have almost entirely given up the\r\npractice of drawing on wood, as there are only three cuts with his mark\r\nwhich contain a date between those years; they are his own arms dated\r\n1523; his own portrait dated 1527; and the siege of a fortified city\r\npreviously noticed at page 253, also dated 1527. The following is a\r\nreduced copy of the cut of Durer’s arms. The pair of _doors_ on the\r\nshield--in German _Durer_ or _Thurer_--is a rebus of the artist’s name;\r\nafter the manner of the Lucys of our own country, who bore three\r\n_luces_,[V-54] or pikes--fish, not weapons--argent, in their coat of\r\narms.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-53: Ulrich Varnbuler was subsequently the chancellor\r\n    of the Emperor Ferdinand I. Durer mentions him in a letter\r\n    addressed to “Hernn Frey in Zurich,” and dated from Nuremberg on\r\n    the Sunday _after St. Andrew’s day_, 1523. With this letter Durer\r\n    sent to his correspondent a humorous sketch, in pen and ink, of\r\n    apes dancing, which in 1776 was still preserved in the Public\r\n    Library of Basle. The date of this letter proves the incorrectness\r\n    of Mr. Ottley’s statement, in page 723 of his Inquiry, where he\r\n    says that Durer did not return to Nuremberg from the Low Countries\r\n    “until _the middle of the year_ 1524.” Mr. Ottley is not more\r\n    correct when he says, at page 735, that the portrait of Varnbuler\r\n    is the “size of nature.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-54: It is supposed that Shakspeare, in alluding to the\r\n    “dozen white luces” in Master Shallow’s coat of arms,--Merry Wives\r\n    of Windsor, Act I,--intended to ridicule Sir Thomas Lucy of\r\n    Charlecotte, Wiltshire, before whom he is said to have been\r\n    brought in his youth on a charge of deer-stealing.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe last of Durer’s engravings on copper is a portrait of Melancthon,\r\ndated 1526, the year in which the meek and learned reformer visited\r\nNuremberg. The following is a reduced copy of his own portrait, perhaps\r\nthe last drawing that he made on wood. It is probably a good likeness of\r\nthe artist; at any rate it bears a great resemblance to the portrait\r\nsaid to be intended for Durer’s own in his carving of the naming of St.\r\nJohn, of which some account is given at page 259. The size of the\r\noriginal is eleven inches and three-eighths high by ten inches wide.\r\nAccording to Bartsch, the earliest impressions have not the arms and\r\nmark, and are inscribed above the border at the top: “_Albrecht Durer’s\r\nConterfeyt_”--Albert Durer’s portrait. It would seem that the block had\r\nbeen preserved for many years subsequent to the date, for I have now\r\nbefore me an impression, on comparatively modern paper, from which it is\r\nevident that at the time of its being taken, the block had been much\r\ncorroded by worms.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that between 1522 and 1528 the treatises of which Durer\r\nis the author were chiefly composed. Their Titles are An Essay on the\r\nFortification of Towns and Villages; Instructions for Measuring with the\r\nRule and Compass; and On the Proportions of the Human Body.[V-55] They\r\nwere all published at Nuremberg with illustrative wood-cuts; the first\r\nin 1527, and the other two in 1528. It is to the latter work that\r\nHogarth alludes, in his Analysis of Beauty, when he speaks of Albert\r\nDurer, Lamozzo, and others, having “puzzled mankind with a heap of\r\nminute unnecessary divisions” in their rules for correctly drawing the\r\nhuman figure.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-55: Etliche Underricht zu Befestigung der Stett,\r\n    Schloss, und Flecken; Underweysung der Messung mit der Zirckel und\r\n    Richtscheyt; Bucher von Menschlicher Proportion. All in folio.\r\n    Those treatises were subsequently translated into Latin and\r\n    several times reprinted. The treatise on the Proportions of the\r\n    Human Body was also translated into French and printed at Paris in\r\n    1557. A collection of Durer’s writings was published by J. Jansen,\r\n    1604.]\r\n\r\nAfter a life of unremitted application,--as is sufficiently proved by\r\nthe number of his works as a painter, an engraver, and a designer on\r\nwood,--Albert Durer died at Nuremberg on 6th April 1528, in the\r\nfifty-seventh year of his age. His wife’s wretched temper had\r\nunquestionably rendered the latter years of his life very unhappy, and\r\nin her eagerness to obtain money she appears to have urged her husband\r\nto what seems more like the heartless toil of a slave than an artist’s\r\nexercise of his profession. It is said that her sitting-room was under\r\nher husband’s studio, and that she was accustomed to give an admonitory\r\nknock against the ceiling whenever she suspected that he was “not\r\ngetting forward with his work.” The following extracts from a letter,\r\nwritten by Bilibald Pirkheimer shortly after Durer’s death, will show\r\nthat common fame has not greatly belied this heartless, selfish woman,\r\nin ascribing, in a great measure, her husband’s death to the daily\r\nvexation which she caused him, and to her urging him to continual\r\napplication in order that a greater sum might be secured to her on his\r\ndecease. The passages relating to Durer in Pirkheimer’s letter are to\r\nthe following effect.[V-56]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-56: This letter is addressed to “Johann Tscherte,” an\r\n    architect residing at Vienna, the mutual friend of Pirkheimer and\r\n    Durer.--Von Murr, Journal, 10er Theil, S. 36.]\r\n\r\n“I have indeed lost in Albert one of the best friends I had on earth;\r\nand nothing pains me more than the thought of his death having been so\r\nmelancholy, which, next to the will of Providence, I can ascribe to no\r\none but his wife, for she fretted him so much and tasked him so hard\r\nthat he departed sooner than he otherwise would. He was dried up like a\r\nbundle of straw; durst never enjoy himself nor enter into company. This\r\nbad woman, moreover, was anxious about that for which she had no\r\noccasion to take heed,--she urged him to labour day and night solely\r\nthat he might earn money, even at the cost of his life, and leave it to\r\nher; she was content to live despised, as she does still, provided\r\nAlbert might leave her six thousand guilders. But she cannot enjoy them:\r\nthe sum of the matter is, she alone has been the cause of his death.\r\nI have often expostulated with her about her fretful, jealous conduct,\r\nand warned her what the consequences would be, but have only met with\r\nreproach. To the friends and sincere well-wishers of Albert she was sure\r\nto be the enemy; while such conduct was to him a cause of exceeding\r\ngrief, and contributed to bring him to the grave. I have not seen her\r\nsince his death; she will have nothing to say to me, although I have on\r\nmany occasions rendered her great service. Whoever contradicts her, or\r\ngives not way to her in all things, is sure to incur her enmity; I am,\r\ntherefore, better pleased that she should keep herself away. She and her\r\nsister are not indeed women of loose character; but, on the contrary,\r\nare, as I believe, of honest reputation and religious; one would,\r\nhowever, rather have one of the other kind who otherwise conducts\r\nherself in a pleasant manner, than a fretful, jealous, scolding\r\nwife--however devout she may be--with whom a man can have no peace\r\neither day or night. We must, however, leave the matter to the will of\r\nGod, who will be gracious and merciful to Albert, for his life was that\r\nof a pious and righteous man. As he died like a good Christian, we may\r\nhave little doubt of his salvation. God grant us grace, and that in his\r\nown good time we may happily follow Albert.”\r\n\r\nThe popular error,--as I believe it to be,--that Albert Durer was an\r\nengraver on wood, has not tended, in England, where his works as a\r\npainter are but little known, to increase his reputation. Many persons\r\non looking over the wood engravings which bear his mark have thought but\r\nmeanly of their execution; and have concluded that his abilities as an\r\nartist were much over-rated, on the supposition that his fame chiefly\r\nrested on the presumed fact of his being the engraver of those works.\r\nCertain writers, too, speaking of him as a painter and an engraver on\r\ncopper, have formed rather an unfavourable estimate of his talents, by\r\ncomparing his pictures with those of his great Italian contemporaries,--\r\nLeonardo da Vinci, Michael Angelo, and Raffaele,--and by judging of his\r\nengravings with reference to the productions of modern art, in which the\r\nfreedom and effect of etching are combined with the precision and\r\nclearness of lines produced by the burin. This, however, is judging the\r\nartist by an unfair standard. Though he has not attained, nor indeed\r\nattempted, that sublimity which seems to have been principally the aim\r\nof the three great Italian masters above mentioned, he has produced much\r\nthat is beautiful, natural, and interesting; and which, though it may\r\nnot stand so high in the scale of art as the grand compositions of his\r\nthree great contemporaries, is no less necessary to its completion. The\r\nfield which he cultivated, though not yielding productions so noble or\r\nsplendid as theirs, was of greater extent and afforded greater variety.\r\nIf they have left us more sublime conceptions of past and future events,\r\nDurer has transmitted to us more faithful pictures of the characters,\r\nmanners, and customs of his own times. Let those who are inclined to\r\ndepreciate his engravings on copper, as dry and meagre when compared\r\nwith the productions of modern engravers, consider the state in which he\r\nfound the art; and let them also recollect that he was not a mere\r\ntranslator of another person’s ideas, but that he engraved his own\r\ndesigns. Setting aside his merits as a painter, I am of opinion that no\r\nartist of the present day has produced, from his own designs, three such\r\nengravings as Durer’s Adam and Eve, St. Jerome seated in his chamber\r\nwriting, and the subject entitled Melancolia.[V-57] Let it also not be\r\nforgotten that to Albert Durer we owe the discovery of etching; a branch\r\nof the art which gives to modern engravers, more especially in\r\nlandscape, so great an advantage over the original inventor. Looking\r\nimpartially at the various works of Durer, and considering the period\r\nand the country in which he lived, few, I think, will venture to deny\r\nthat he was one of the greatest artists of his age. The best proof\r\nindeed of the solidity of his fame is afforded by the esteem in which\r\nhis works have been held for three centuries by nearly all persons who\r\nhave had opportunities of seeing them, except such as have, upon narrow\r\nprinciples, formed an exclusive theory with respect to excellence in\r\nart. With such authorities nothing can be beautiful or interesting that\r\nis not _grand_; every country parish church should be built in the style\r\nof a Grecian temple; our woods should grow nothing but oaks; a country\r\ngentleman’s dove-cot should be a fac-simile of the lantern of\r\nDemosthenes; the sign of the Angel at a country inn should be painted\r\nby a Guido; and a picture representing the meeting of the British\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science should be in the style of\r\nRaffaele’s School of Athens.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-57: Those three engravings are respectively numbered\r\n    1, 60, and 67 in Bartsch’s list of Durer’s works in his\r\n    Peintre-Graveur, tom. vii. The Adam and Eve is nine inches and\r\n    three-fourths high by seven inches and a half wide,--date 1504;\r\n    St. Jerome, nine inches and five-eighths high by seven inches and\r\n    three-eighths wide,--date 1514; Melancolia, nine inches and\r\n    three-eighths high by seven inches and one fourth wide,--date\r\n    1514.]\r\n\r\nLucas Cranach, a painter of great repute in his day, like his\r\ncontemporary Durer has also been supposed to be the engraver of the\r\nwood-cuts which bear his mark, but which, in all probability, were only\r\ndrawn by him on the block and executed by professional wood engravers.\r\nThe family name of this artist was Sunder, and he is also sometimes\r\ncalled Muller or Maler--Painter--from his profession. He acquired the\r\nname Cranach, or Von Cranach, from Cranach, a town in the territory of\r\nBamberg, where he was born in 1470. He enjoyed the patronage of the\r\nelectoral princes of Saxony, and one of the most frequent of his marks\r\nis a shield of the arms of that family. Another of his marks is a shield\r\nwith two swords crossed; a third is a kind of dragon; and a fourth is\r\nthe initial letters of his name, L. C. Sometimes two or three of those\r\nmarks are to be found in one cut. There are four engravings on copper\r\nwith the mark [[LCZ]] which are generally ascribed to this artist. That\r\nthey are from his designs is very likely, but whether they were engraved\r\nby himself or not is uncertain. One of them bears the date 1492, and it\r\nis probable that they were all executed about the same period. Two of\r\nthose pieces were in the possession of Mr. Ottley, who says, “Perhaps\r\nthe two last characters of the mark may be intended for _Cr_.” It seems,\r\nhowever, more likely that the last character is intended for the letter\r\nwhich it most resembles--a Z, and that it denotes the German word\r\n_zeichnet_--that is “_drew_;” in the same manner as later artists\r\noccasionally subjoined the letter P or F to their names for _Pinxit_ or\r\n_Fecit_, respectively as they might have painted the picture or engraved\r\nthe plate.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest chiaro-scuros, as has before been observed, printed\r\nfrom three blocks, is from a design of Lucas Cranach. It is dated 1509,\r\nnine years before the earliest chiaro-scuro with a date executed by Ugo\r\nda Carpi, to whom Vasari and others have erroneously ascribed the\r\ninvention of this mode of imitating a drawing by impressions from two or\r\nmore wood-blocks. The subject, like that of the following specimen, is a\r\nRepose in Egypt, but is treated in a different manner,--the Virgin being\r\nrepresented giving suck to the infant Christ.\r\n\r\nThe wood engravings that contain Cranach’s mark are not so numerous as\r\nthose which contain the mark of Albert Durer, and they are also\r\ngenerally inferior to the latter both in effect and design. The\r\nfollowing reduced copy of a cut which contains three of Cranach’s four\r\nmarks will afford some idea of the style of his designs on wood. As a\r\nspecimen of his ability in this branch of art it is perhaps superior to\r\nthe greater part of his designs executed in the same manner. The subject\r\nis described by Bartsch as a Repose in Egypt. The action of the youthful\r\nangels who are dancing round the Virgin and the infant Christ is\r\ncertainly truly juvenile if not graceful. The two children seen up the\r\ntree robbing an eagle’s nest are perhaps emblematic of the promised\r\npeace of Christ’s kingdom and of the destruction of the power of Satan:\r\n“No lion shall be there nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it\r\nshall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there.”[V-58] In\r\nthe right-hand corner at the top is the shield of the arms of Saxony;\r\nand to the left, also at the top, is another of Cranach’s marks--a\r\nshield with two swords crossed; in the right-hand corner at the bottom\r\nis a third mark,--the figure of a kind of dragon with a ring in its\r\nmouth. The size of the original cut is thirteen inches and one-fourth\r\nhigh by nine inches and one-fourth wide.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-58: Isaiah, chapter xxxv. verse 9.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nCranach was much esteemed in his own country as a painter, and several\r\nof his pictures are still regarded with admiration. He was in great\r\nfavour with John Frederick, Elector of Saxony,[V-59] and at one period\r\nof his life was one of the magistrates of Wittenberg. He died at Weimar,\r\non 16th October 1553, aged eighty-three.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-59: One of the largest wood-cuts designed by Cranach\r\n    is a subject representing the baptism of some saint; and having on\r\n    one side a portrait of Frederick, Elector of Saxony, and on the\r\n    other a portrait of Luther. The block has consisted of three\r\n    pieces, and from the impressions it seems as if the parts\r\n    containing the portraits of the elector and Luther had been added\r\n    after the central part had been finished. The piece altogether is\r\n    comparatively worthless in design, and is very indifferently\r\n    engraved.]\r\n\r\nAnother eminent painter who has been classed with Durer and Cranach as a\r\nwood engraver is Hans Burgmair, who was born at Augsburg about 1473. The\r\nmark of this artist is to be found on a great number of wood engravings,\r\nbut beyond this fact there is not the least reason to suppose that he\r\never engraved a single block. To those who have described Burgmair as a\r\nwood engraver from this circumstance only, a most satisfactory answer is\r\nafforded by the fact that several of the original blocks of the Triumphs\r\nof Maximilian, which contain Burgmair’s mark, have at the back the names\r\nof the different engravers by whom they were executed. As we have here\r\npositive evidence of cuts with Burgmair’s mark being engraved by other\r\npersons, we cannot certainly conclude that any cut, from the mere fact\r\nof its containing his mark, was actually engraved by himself. Next to\r\nAlbert Durer he was one of the best designers on wood of his age; and as\r\none of the early masters of the German school of painting he is\r\ngenerally considered as entitled to rank next to the great painter of\r\nNuremberg. It has indeed been supposed that Burgmair was a pupil of\r\nDurer; but for this opinion there seems to be no sufficient ground. It\r\nis certain that he made many of the designs for the wood-cuts published\r\nunder the title of The Triumphs of Maximilian; and it is also probable\r\nthat he drew nearly all the cuts in the book entitled Der Weiss\r\nKunig--The Wise King, another work illustrative of the learning, wisdom,\r\nand adventures of the Emperor Maximilian.[V-60] Before proceeding,\r\nhowever, to give any account of those works, it seems advisable to give\r\ntwo specimens from a different series of wood-cuts of his designing, and\r\nto briefly notice two or three of the more remarkable single cuts that\r\nbear his mark.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-60: Burgmair also made the designs for a series of\r\n    saints, male and female, of the family of the emperor, which are\r\n    also engraved on wood. The original blocks, with the names of the\r\n    engravers written at the back, are still preserved, and are at\r\n    present in the Imperial Library at Vienna.]\r\n\r\nThe cut on the opposite page is a reduced copy from a series designed by\r\nBurgmair. The subject is Samson and Delilah, and is treated according to\r\nthe old German fashion, without the least regard to propriety of\r\ncostume. Samson is represented like a grisly old German baron of\r\nBurgmair’s own time, with limbs certainly not indicating extraordinary\r\nstrength; and Delilah seems very deliberately engaged in cutting off his\r\nhair. The wine flagon and fowl, to the left, would seem to indicate the\r\ndanger of yielding to sensual indulgence. The original cut is surrounded\r\nby an ornamental border, and is four inches and five-eighths high by\r\nthree inches and five-eighths wide. Burgmair’s mark H. B. is at the\r\nbottom of the cut, to the right.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe cut on page 280 is also a reduced copy from one of the same series,\r\nand is a proof that those who call the whole by the general title of\r\n“Bible Prints” are not exactly correct in their nomenclature. The\r\nsomewhat humorous-looking personage, whom a lady is using as her pad, is\r\nthus described in an inscription underneath the cut: “Aristotle, a\r\nGreek, the son of Nicomachus. A disciple of Plato, and the master of\r\nAlexander the Great.” Though Aristotle is said to have been extremely\r\nfond of his wife Pythaïs, and to have paid her divine honours after her\r\ndeath, there is no record, I believe, of her having amused herself with\r\nriding on her husband’s back. The subject is probably intended to\r\nillustrate the power of the fair sex over even the wisest of mortals,\r\nand to show that philosophers themselves when under such influence\r\noccasionally forget their character as teachers of men, and exhibit\r\nthemselves in situations which scarcely an ass might envy. The original\r\nis surrounded by a border, and is four inches and five-eighths high by\r\nthree inches and five-eighths wide.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere are several chiaro-scuros from wood-blocks with Burgmair’s mark.\r\nOne of the earliest is a portrait of “Joannes Paungartner,” from two\r\nblocks, with the date 1512; another of St. George on horseback, from two\r\nblocks, engraved by Jost or Josse de Negher, without date; a third\r\nrepresenting a young woman flying from Death, who is seen killing a\r\nyoung man,--from three blocks, without date; and a fourth of the Emperor\r\nMaximilian on horseback, from two blocks, with the date 1518.\r\n\r\nThe best cuts of Burgmair’s designing, though drawn with great spirit\r\nand freedom, are decidedly inferior to the best of the wood-cuts\r\ndesigned by Albert Durer. Errors in perspective are frequent in the cuts\r\nwhich bear his mark; his figures are not so varied nor their characters\r\nso well indicated as Durer’s; and in their arrangement, or grouping, he\r\nis also inferior to Durer, as well as in the art of giving effect to his\r\nsubjects by the skilful distribution of light and shade. The cuts in the\r\nWise King, nearly all of which are said to have been designed by him,\r\nare, for the most part, very inferior productions both with respect to\r\nengraving and design. His merits as a designer on wood are perhaps shown\r\nto greater advantage in the Triumphs of Maximilian than in any other of\r\nhis works executed in this manner.--Some writers have asserted that\r\nBurgmair died in 1517, but this is certainly incorrect; for there is a\r\nportrait of him, with that of his wife on the same pannel, painted by\r\nhimself in 1529, when he was fifty-six years old. Underneath this\r\npainting was a couplet to the following effect:\r\n\r\n  Our likeness such as here you view;--\r\n  The glass itself was not more true.[V-61]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-61:\r\n      “Solche Gestalt unser baider was,\r\n      Im Spigel aber nix dan das!”\r\n    A small engraving in a slight manner appears to have been made of\r\n    the portraits of Burgmair and his wife by George Christopher\r\n    Kilian, an artist of Augsburg, about 1774.--Von Murr, Journal,\r\n    4er Theil, S. 22.]\r\n\r\nBurgmair, like Cranach, lived till he was upwards of eighty; but it\r\nwould seem that he had given up drawing on wood for many years previous\r\nto his death, for I am not aware of there being any wood-cuts designed\r\nby him with a date subsequent to 1530. He died in 1559, aged eighty-six.\r\n\r\nHans Schäufflein is another of those old German painters who are\r\ngenerally supposed to have been also engravers on wood. Bartsch,\r\nhowever, thinks that, like Durer, Cranach, and Burgmair, he only made\r\nthe designs for the wood-cuts which are ascribed to him, and that they\r\nwere engraved by other persons. Schäufflein was born at Nuremberg in\r\n1483; and it is said that he was a pupil of Albert Durer. Subsequently\r\nhe removed to Nordlingen, a town in Suabia, about sixty miles to the\r\nsouth-westward of Nuremberg, where he died in 1550.\r\n\r\nThe wood-cuts in connexion with which Schäufllein’s name is most\r\nfrequently mentioned are the illustrations of the work usually called\r\nthe Adventures of Sir Theurdank,[V-62] an allegorical poem, in folio,\r\nwhich is said to have been the joint composition of the Emperor\r\nMaximilian and his private secretary Melchior Pfintzing, provost of the\r\nchurch of St. Sebald at Nuremberg. Though Köhler, a German author, in an\r\nEssay on Sir Theurdank,--De inclyto libro poetico Theurdank,--has highly\r\npraised the poetical beauties of the work, they are certainly not such\r\nas are likely to interest an English reader. “The versified allegory of\r\nSir Theurdank,” says Küttner,[V-63] “is deficient in true Epic beauty;\r\nit has also nothing, as a poem, of the romantic descriptions of the\r\nthirteenth century,--nothing of the delicate gallantry of the age of\r\nchivalry and the troubadours. The machinery which sets all in action are\r\ncertain personifications of Envy, restless Curiosity, and Daring; these\r\ninduce the hero to undertake many perilous adventures, from which he\r\nalways escapes through Understanding and Virtue. Such is the groundwork\r\nof the fable which Pfintzing constructs in order to extol, under\r\nallegorical representations, the perils, adventures, and heroic deeds of\r\nthe emperor. Everything is described so figuratively as to amount to a\r\nriddle; and the story proceeds with little connexion and without\r\nanimation. There are no striking descriptive passages, no Homeric\r\nsimiles, and no episodes to allow the reader occasionally to rest; in\r\nfact, nothing admirable, spirit-stirring, or great. The poem is indeed\r\nrather moral than epic; Lucan’s Pharsalia partakes more of the epic\r\ncharacter than Pfintzing’s Theurdank. Pfintzing, however, surpasses the\r\nCyclic poets alluded to by Horace.”[V-64]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-62: The original title of the work is: “Die\r\n    gevarlichkeiten und eins teils der Geschichten des loblichen\r\n    streytparen und hochberümbten Helds und Ritters Tewrdanckha.” That\r\n    is: The adventurous deeds and part of the history of the famous,\r\n    valiant, and highly-renowned hero Sir Theurdank. The name,\r\n    Theurdank, in the language of the period, would seem to imply a\r\n    person whose thoughts were only employed on noble and elevated\r\n    subjects. Goethe, who in his youth was fond of looking over old\r\n    books illustrated with wood-cuts, alludes to Sir Theurdank in his\r\n    admirable play of Götz von Berlichingen: “Geht! Geht!” says\r\n    Adelheid to Weislingen, “Erzählt das Mädchen die den Teurdanck\r\n    lesen, und sich so einen Mann wünschen.”--“Go! Go! Tell that to a\r\n    girl who reads Sir Theurdank, and wishes that she may have such a\r\n    husband.” In Sir Walter Scott’s faulty translation of this\r\n    play--under the name of _William_ Scott, 1799,--the passage is\r\n    rendered as follows: “Go! Go! Talk of that to some forsaken damsel\r\n    whose Corydon has proved forsworn.” In another passage where\r\n    Goethe makes Adelheid allude to the popular “Märchen,” or tale, of\r\n    Number-Nip, the point is completely lost in the translation:\r\n    “Entbinden nicht unsre Gesetze solchen Schwüren?--Macht das\r\n    Kindern weiss die den Rübezahl glauben.” Literally, “Do not our\r\n    laws release you from such oaths?--Tell that to children who\r\n    believe Number-Nip.” In Sir Walter Scott’s translation the passage\r\n    is thus most incorrectly rendered: “Such agreement is no more\r\n    binding than an unjust extorted oath. Every child knows what faith\r\n    is to be kept with robbers.” The name _Rübezahl_ is literally\r\n    translated by _Number-Neep_; Rübe is the German name for a\r\n    turnip,--Scoticè, a neep. The story is as well known in Germany as\r\n    that of Jack the Giant-Killer in England.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-63: Charaktere Teutscher Dichter und Prosaisten,\r\n    S. 71.

As Schönsperger’s\r\nestablished printing-office was at the latter city and not at Nuremberg,\r\nPanzer has supposed that the imprint of Nuremberg in the first edition\r\nmight have been introduced as a compliment to the nominal author,\r\nMelchior Pfintzing, who then resided in that city. Two or three other\r\neditions of Sir Theurdank, with the same cuts, appeared between 1519 and\r\n1602; but Küttner, in his Characters of German poets and prose-writers,\r\nsays that in all those editions alterations have been made in the text.\r\n\r\nThe character in which Sir Theurdank is printed is of great beauty and\r\nmuch ornamented with flourishes. Several writers, and among others\r\nFournier, who was a type-founder and wood-engraver, have erroneously\r\ndescribed the text as having been engraved on blocks of wood. This very\r\nsuperficial and incorrect writer also states that the cuts contained in\r\nthe volume are “chefs-d’œuvres de la gravure en bois.”[V-65] His opinion\r\nwith respect to the cuts is about as correct as his judgment respecting\r\nthe type; the most of them are in fact very ordinary productions, and\r\nare neither remarkable for execution nor design. He also informs his\r\nreaders that he has discovered on some of those cuts an H and an S,\r\naccompanied with a little shovel, and that they are the monogram of\r\n_Hans Sebalde_, or Hans Schäufflein. By _Hans Sebalde_ he perhaps means\r\nHans Sebald Behaim, an artist born at Nuremberg in 1500, and who never\r\nused the letters H and S, accompanied with a little shovel, as a\r\nmonogram. Fournier did not know that this mark is used exclusively by\r\nHans Schäufflein; and that the little shovel, or baker’s peel,--called\r\nin old German, Schäufflein, or Scheuffleine,--is a rebus of his surname.\r\nThe careful examination of writers more deserving of credit has\r\ncompletely proved that the text of the three earliest editions--those\r\nonly in which it was asserted to be from engraved wood-blocks--is\r\nprinted from moveable types of metal. Breitkopf[V-66] has observed, that\r\nin the edition of 1517 the letter i, in the word _shickhet_, in the\r\nsecond line following the eighty-fourth cut, is inverted; and Panzer and\r\nBrunner have noticed several variations in the orthography of the second\r\nand third editions when compared with the first.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-65: Dissertation sur l’Origine et les Progres de l’Art\r\n    de Graver en Bois, p. 74. Paris, 1758.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-66: The kind of character in which the text of Sir\r\n    Theurdank is printed is called “Fractur” by German printers. “The\r\n    first work,” says Breitkopf, “which afforded an example of a\r\n    perfectly-shaped _Fractur_ for printing, was unquestionably the\r\n    Theurdank, printed at Nuremberg, 1517.”--Ueber Bibliographie und\r\n    Bibliophile, S. 8. 1793.--Neudörffer, a contemporary, who lived at\r\n    Nuremberg at the time when Sir Theurdank was first published, says\r\n    that the specimens for the types were written by Vincent Rockner,\r\n    the emperor’s court-secretary.--Von Murr, Journal, 2er Theil,\r\n    S. 159; and Lichtenberger, Initia Typographica, p. 194.]\r\n\r\nThere are a hundred and eighteen wood-cuts in the Adventures of Sir\r\nTheurdank, which are all supposed to have been designed, if not\r\nengraved, by Hans Schäufflein, though his mark, [Symbol], occurs on not\r\nmore than five or six. From the general similarity of style I have,\r\nhowever, no doubt that the designs were all made by the same person, and\r\nI think it more likely that Schaufflein was the designer than the\r\nengraver. The cut on page 284 is a reduced copy of that numbered 14 in\r\nthe first edition. The original is six inches and one-fourth high by\r\nfive inches and a half wide. In this cut, Sir Theurdank is seen, in the\r\ndress of a hunter, encountering a huge bear; while to the right is\r\nperceived one of his tempters, _Fürwittig_--restless Curiosity,--and to\r\nthe left, on horseback, Theurdank’s squire, Ernhold. The title of the\r\nchapter, or fytte, to which this cut is prefixed is to the following\r\neffect: “How Fürwittig led Sir Theurdank into a perilous encounter with\r\na she-bear.” The subject of the thirteenth chapter is his perilous\r\nencounter with a stag, and in the fifteenth we are entertained with the\r\nnarration of one of his adventures when hunting the chamois.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe opposite cut is a reduced copy of No. 111 in the Adventures of Sir\r\nTheurdank. The title of the chapter to which this cut is prefixed is:\r\n“How Unfalo [one of Theurdank’s tempters] was hung.” A monk at the foot\r\nof the gallows appears to pray for the culprit just turned off; while\r\nErnold seems to be explaining to a group of spectators to the left the\r\nreason of the execution. The cut illustrative of the 110th chapter\r\nrepresents the beheading of “Fürwittig;” and in the 112th, “Neydelhart,”\r\nthe basest of Theurdank’s enemies, is seen receiving the reward of his\r\nperfidy by being thrown into a moat. The two original cuts which have\r\nbeen selected as specimens of the wood engravings in the Adventures of\r\nSir Theurdank, though not the best, are perhaps, in point of design and\r\nexecution, rather superior to two-thirds of those contained in the work.\r\nThe copies, though less in size, afford a tolerably correct idea of the\r\nstyle of the originals, which no one who is acquainted with the best\r\nwood-cuts engraved after the designs of Durer and Burgmair will assert\r\nto be “chefs-d’œuvres” of the art of wood engraving.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere are a number of wood-cuts which contain Hans Schäufflein’s mark,\r\nthough somewhat different from that which occurs in the Adventures of\r\nSir Theurdank; the S being linked with one of the upright lines of the\r\nH, instead of being placed between them. When the letters are combined\r\nin this manner, there are frequently two little shovels crossed, “in\r\nsaltire,” as a herald would say, instead of a single one as in Sir\r\nTheurdank. The following mark, [Symbol], occurs on a series of wood-cuts\r\nillustrative of Christ’s Passion, printed at Frankfort by C. Egenolf,\r\n1542; on the cuts in a German almanack, Mentz, 1545, and 1547; and on\r\nseveral single subjects executed about that period. This mark, it is\r\nsaid, distinguishes the designs of Hans Schaufflein the younger.\r\nBartsch, however, observes, that “what Strutt has said about there being\r\ntwo persons of this name, an elder and a younger, seems to be a mere\r\nconjecture.”\r\n\r\nThe book entitled Der Weiss Kunig--the Wise King--is another of the\r\nworks projected by the Emperor Maximilian in order to inform the world\r\nof sundry matters concerning his father Frederick III, his own\r\neducation, warlike and perilous deeds, government, wooing, and wedding.\r\nThis work is in prose; and though Marx Treitzsaurwein, the emperor’s\r\nsecretary, is put forth as the author, there is little doubt of its\r\nhaving been chiefly composed by Maximilian himself. About 1512 it\r\nappears that the materials for this work were prepared by the emperor,\r\nand that about 1514 they were entrusted to his secretary,\r\nTreitzsaurwein, to be put in order. It would appear that before the work\r\nwas ready for the press Maximilian had died; and Charles V. was too much\r\noccupied with other matters to pay much attention to the publication of\r\nan enigmatical work, whose chief object was to celebrate the\r\naccomplishments, knowledge, and adventures of his grandfather. The\r\nobscurity of many passages in the emperor’s manuscript seems to have, in\r\na great measure, retarded the completion of the work. There is now in\r\nthe Imperial Library at Vienna a manuscript volume of queries respecting\r\nthe doubtful passages in the Weiss Kunig; and as each had ultimately to\r\nbe referred to the emperor, it would seem that, from the pressure of\r\nmore important business and his increased age, he had wanted leisure and\r\nspirits to give the necessary explanations. In the sixteenth century,\r\nRichard Strein, an eminent philologer, began a sort of commentary or\r\nexposition of the more difficult passages in the Wise King; and\r\nsubsequently his remarks came into the hands of George Christopher von\r\nSchallenberg, who, in 1631, had the good fortune to obtain at Vienna\r\nimpressions of most of the cuts which were intended by the emperor to\r\nillustrate the work, together with several of the original drawings.\r\nTreitzsaurwein’s manuscript, which for many years had been preserved at\r\nAmbras in the Tyrol, having been transferred to the Imperial Library at\r\nVienna, and the original blocks having been discovered in the Jesuits’\r\nCollege at Gratz in Stiria, the text and cuts were printed together, for\r\nthe first time, in a folio volume, at Vienna in 1775.[V-67]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-67: The title of the volume is “Der Weiss Kunig. Eine\r\n    Erzehlung von den Thaten Kaiser Maximilian des Ersten. Von Marx\r\n    Treitzsaurwein auf dessen Angeben zusammen getragen, nebst von\r\n    Hannsen Burgmair dazu verfertigten Holzschnitten. Herausgeben aus\r\n    dem Manuscripte der Kaiserl. Königl. Hofbibliothek. Wien, auf\r\n    Kosten Joseph Kurzböckens, 1775.”]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the greater part, if not all the cuts, were finished\r\nprevious to the emperor’s death; and impressions of them, very likely\r\ntaken shortly after the blocks were finished, were known to collectors\r\nlong before the publication of the book. The late Mr. Ottley had\r\nseventy-seven of the series, apparently taken as proofs by means of a\r\npress. The paper on which these cuts are impressed appears to have\r\nconsisted of fragments, on one side of which there had previously been\r\nprinted certain state papers of the Emperor Maximilian, dated 1514. They\r\nwere sold at the sale of the late Mr. Ottley’s engravings in 1838, and\r\nare now in the Print Room of the British Museum. In the volume printed\r\nat Vienna in 1775, there are two hundred and thirty-seven[V-68] large\r\ncuts, of which number ninety-two contain Burgmair’s mark, H. B; one\r\ncontains Schaufflein’s mark; another the mark of Hans Springinklee; and\r\na third, a modern cut, is marked “F. F. S. V. 1775.” Besides the large\r\ncuts, all of which are old except the last noticed, there are a few\r\nworthless tail-pieces of modern execution, one of which, a nondescript\r\nbird, has been copied by Bewick, and is to be found at page 144 of the\r\nfirst edition of his Quadrupeds, 1790.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-68: In the Imperial Library at Vienna there is a\r\n    series of old impressions of cuts intended for “Der Weiss Kunig,”\r\n    consisting of two hundred and fifty pieces; it would therefore\r\n    appear, supposing this set to be perfect, that there are fourteen\r\n    of the original blocks lost. Why a single modern cut has been\r\n    admitted into the book, and thirteen of the old impressions not\r\n    re-engraved, it perhaps would be difficult to give a satisfactory\r\n    reason.]\r\n\r\nThe cuts in the Weiss Kunig, with respect to the style in which they are\r\ndesigned, bear considerable resemblance to those in Sir Theurdank; and\r\nfrom their execution it is evident that they have been cut by different\r\nengravers; some of them being executed in a very superior manner, and\r\nothers affording proofs of their either being cut by a novice or a very\r\nindifferent workman. It has been said that all those which contain the\r\nmark of Hans Burgmair show a decided superiority in point of engraving;\r\nbut this assertion is not correct, for several of them may be classed\r\nwith the worst executed in the volume. The unequal manner in which the\r\ncuts with Burgmair’s mark are executed is with me an additional reason\r\nfor believing that he only furnished the designs for professional wood\r\nengravers to execute, and never engraved on wood himself.\r\n\r\nIt seems unnecessary to give any specimens of the cuts in the Weiss\r\nKunig, as an idea of their style may be formed from those given at pages\r\n284 and 285 from Sir Theurdank; and as other specimens of Burgmair’s\r\ntalents as a designer on wood will be given subsequently from the\r\nTriumphs of Maximilian. The following abstract of the titles of a few of\r\nthe chapters may perhaps afford some idea of the work, while they prove\r\nthat the education of the emperor embraced a wide circle, forming almost\r\na perfect Cyclopædia. The first fifteen chapters give an account of the\r\nmarriage of the Old Wise King, Frederick III, the father of Maximilian,\r\nwith Elenora, daughter of Alphonso V, King of Portugal; his journey to\r\nRome and his coronation there by the pope; with the birth, and\r\nchristening of Maximilian, the Young Wise King. About thirty-five\r\nchapters, from XV. to L., are chiefly occupied with an account of\r\nMaximilian’s education. After learning to write, he is instructed in the\r\nliberal arts; and after some time devoted to “Politik,” or King-craft,\r\nhe proceeds to the study of the _black-art_, a branch of knowledge which\r\nthe emperor subsequently held to be vain and ungodly. He then commences\r\nthe study of history, devotes some attention to medicine and law, and\r\nlearns the Italian and Bohemian languages. He then learns to paint;\r\nstudies the principles of architecture, and tries his hand at carpentry.\r\nHe next takes lessons in music; and about the same time acquires a\r\npractical knowledge of the art of cookery:--the Wise King, we are\r\ninformed, was a person of nice taste in kitchen affairs, and had a\r\nproper relish for savoury and well-cooked viands. To the accomplishment\r\nof dancing he adds a knowledge of numismatics; and, after making himself\r\nacquainted with the mode of working mines, he learns to shoot with the\r\nhand-gun and the cross-bow. The chase, falconry, angling, and fowling\r\nnext occupy his attention; and about the same time he learns to fence,\r\nto tilt, and to manage the great horse. His course of education appears\r\nto have been wound up with practical lessons in the art of making\r\narmour, in gunnery, and in fortification. From the fiftieth chapter to\r\nthe conclusion, the book is chiefly filled with accounts of the wars and\r\nadventures of Maximilian, which are for the most part allegorically\r\ndetailed, and require the reader to be well versed in the true history\r\nof the emperor to be able to unriddle them. Küttner says that,\r\nnotwithstanding its allegories and enigmatical allusions, the Weiss\r\nKunig is a work which displays much mind in the conception and\r\nexecution, and considerable force and elegance of language; and that it\r\nchiefly wants a more orderly arrangement of the events. “Throughout the\r\nwhole,” he adds, “there are evidences of a searching genius, improved by\r\nscience and a knowledge of the affairs of the world.”[V-69]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-69: Charaktere Teutscher Dichter und Prosaisten,\r\n    S. 70.]\r\n\r\nThe series of wood-cuts called the Triumphs of Maximilian are, both with\r\nrespect to design and engraving, the best of all the works thus executed\r\nby command of the emperor to convey to posterity a pictorial\r\nrepresentation of the splendour of his court, his victories, and the\r\nextent of his possessions. This work appears to have been commenced\r\nabout the same time as the Weiss Kunig; and from the subject,\r\na triumphal procession, it was probably intended to be the last of the\r\nseries of wood-cuts by which he was desirous of disseminating an opinion\r\nof his power and his fame. Of those works he only lived to see one\r\npublished,--the Adventures of Sir Theurdank; the Wise King, the\r\nTriumphal Car, the Triumphal Arch, and the Triumphal Procession, appear\r\nto have been all unfinished at the time of his decease in 1519. The\r\ntotal number of cuts contained in the latter work, published under the\r\ntitle of the Triumphs of Maximilian, in 1796, is one hundred and\r\nthirty-five; but had the series been finished according to the original\r\ndrawings, now preserved in the Imperial Library at Vienna, the whole\r\nnumber of the cuts would have been about two hundred and eighteen. Of\r\nthe hundred and thirty-five published there are about sixteen designed\r\nin a style so different from the rest, that it is doubtful if they\r\nbelong to the same series; and this suspicion receives further\r\nconfirmation from the fact that the subjects of those sixteen doubtful\r\ncuts are not to be found among the original designs. It would therefore\r\nseem, that, unless some of the blocks have been lost or destroyed,\r\nlittle more than one-half of the cuts intended for the Triumphal\r\nProcession were finished when the emperor’s death put a stop to the\r\nfurther progress of the work. It is almost certain, that none of the\r\ncuts were engraved after the emperor’s death; for the date, commencing\r\nwith 1516, is written at the back of several of the original blocks, and\r\non no one is it later than 1519.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the Triumphal Procession,--consisting of a description of\r\nthe characters to be introduced, the order in which they are to follow\r\neach other, their arms, dress, and appointments,--appears to have been\r\ndictated by the emperor to his secretary Treitzsaurwein, the nominal\r\nauthor of the Weiss Kunig, in 1512. In this manuscript the subjects for\r\nthe rhyming inscriptions intended for the different banners and tablets\r\nare also noted in prose. Another manuscript, in the handwriting of\r\nTreitzsaurwein, and interlined by the emperor himself, contains the\r\ninscriptions for the banners and tablets in verse; and a third\r\nmanuscript, written after the drawings were finished, contains a\r\ndescription of the subjects,--though not so much in detail as the first,\r\nand in some particulars slightly differing,--with all the inscriptions\r\nin verse except eight. From those manuscripts, which are preserved in\r\nthe Imperial Library at Vienna, the descriptions in the edition of 1796\r\nhave been transcribed. Most of the descriptions and verses were\r\npreviously given by Von Murr, in 1775, in the ninth volume of his\r\nJournal. The edition of the Triumphal Procession published in 1796 also\r\ncontains a French translation of the descriptions, with numbers\r\nreferring to those printed at the right-hand corner of the cuts. The\r\nnumbers, however, of the description and the cut in very many instances\r\ndo not agree; and it would almost seem, from the manner in which the\r\ntext is printed, that the publishers did not wish to facilitate a\r\ncomparison between the description and the cut which they have numbered\r\nas corresponding with it. The gross negligence of the publishers, or\r\ntheir editor, in this respect materially detracts from the interest of\r\nthe work. To compare the descriptions with the cuts is not only a work\r\nof some trouble, but it is also labour thrown away. Von Murr’s volume,\r\nfrom its convenient size, is of much greater use in comparing the cuts\r\nwith the description than the text printed in the edition of 1796; and\r\nthough it contains no numbers for reference,--as no complete collection\r\nof the cuts had then been printed,--it contains no misdirections: and it\r\nis better to have no guide-posts than such as only lead the traveller\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nThe original drawings for the Triumphal Procession,--or as the work is\r\nusually called, the Triumphs of Maximilian,--are preserved in the\r\nImperial Library at Vienna. They are painted in water colours, on a\r\nhundred and nine sheets of vellum, each thirty-four inches long by\r\ntwenty inches high, and containing two of the engraved subjects. Dr.\r\nDibdin, who saw the drawings in 1818, says that they are rather gaudily\r\nexecuted, and that he prefers the engravings to the original\r\npaintings.[V-70] Whether those paintings are the work of Hans Burgmair,\r\nor not, appears to be uncertain. From the following extract from the\r\npreface to the Triumphs of Maximilian, published in 1796, it is evident\r\nthat the writer did not think that the original drawings were executed\r\nby that artist. “The engravings of this Triumph, far from being servile\r\ncopies of the paintings in miniature, differ from them entirely, so far\r\nas regards the manner in which they are designed. Most all the groups\r\nhave a different form, and almost every figure a different attitude;\r\n_consequently Hans Burgmair appears in his work in the character of\r\nauthor [original designer], and so much the more, as he has in many\r\npoints surpassed his model_. But whatever may be the difference between\r\nthe engravings and the drawings on vellum, the subjects still so far\r\ncorrespond that they may be recognised without the least difficulty. It\r\nis, however, necessary to except eighteen of the engravings, in which\r\nthis correspondence would be sought for in vain. Those engravings are,\r\nthe twelve from No. 89 to 100, and the six from 130 to 135.” As the cuts\r\nappear to have been intentionally wrong numbered, it is not easy to\r\ndetermine from this reference which are actually the first twelve\r\nalluded to, for in most of the copies which I have seen, the numerals\r\n91, 92, and 93 occur twice,--though the subjects of the cuts are\r\ndifferent. In the copy now before me, I have to observe that there are\r\n_sixteen_[V-71] cuts designed in a style so different from those which\r\ncontain Burgmair’s mark, that I am convinced they have not been drawn by\r\nthat artist. Without enquiring whether the subjects are to be found in\r\nthe paintings or not, I am satisfied that a considerable number of the\r\nengravings, besides those sixteen, were not drawn on the wood by Hans\r\nBurgmair. Both Breitkopf and Von Murr[V-72] have asserted that the\r\ndrawings for the Triumphs of Maximilian were made by Albert Durer, but\r\nthey do not say whether they mean the drawings on vellum, or the\r\ndrawings on the blocks. This assertion is, however, made without any\r\nauthority; and, whether they meant the drawings on vellum or the\r\ndrawings on the block, it is unquestionably incorrect. The drawings on\r\nvellum are not by Durer, and of the whole hundred and thirty-five cuts\r\nthere are not more than five or six that can be supposed with any degree\r\nof probability to have been of his designing.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-70: Bibliographical Tour, vol iii. p. 330.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-71: The subjects of those sixteen cuts are chiefly the\r\n    statues of the emperor’s ancestors, with representations of\r\n    himself, and of his family alliances. Several of the carriages are\r\n    propelled by mechanical contrivances, which for laborious\r\n    ingenuity may vie with the machine for uncorking bottles in one of\r\n    the subjects of Hogarth’s Marriage à la Mode. In the copy before\r\n    me those engravings are numbered 89, 90, 91, 91, 92, 92, 93, 93,\r\n    94, 95, 96, 97, 99, 101, 102, 103.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-72: Breitkopf, Ueber Bibliographie und Bibliophile,\r\n    S. 4. Leipzig, 1793. Von Murr, Journal, 9er Theil, S. 1. At page\r\n    255 I have said: “Though I have not been able to ascertain\r\n    satisfactorily the subject of Durer’s painting in the Town-hall of\r\n    Nuremberg, I am inclined to think that it is the Triumphal _Car_\r\n    of Maximilian.” Since the sheet containing the above passage was\r\n    printed off I have ascertained that the subject _is_ the Triumphal\r\n    Car; and that it is described in Von Murr’s Nürnbergischen\r\n    Merkwürdigkeiten, S. 395.]\r\n\r\nForty of the blocks from which the Triumphs of Maximilian are printed\r\nwere obtained from Ambras in the Tyrol, where they had probably been\r\npreserved since the time of the emperor’s death; and the other\r\nninety-five were discovered in the Jesuits’ College at Gratz in Stiria.\r\nThe whole were brought to Vienna and deposited in the Imperial Library\r\nin 1779. A few proofs had probably been taken when the blocks were\r\nengraved; there are ninety of those old impressions in the Imperial\r\nLibrary; Monsieur Mariette had ninety-seven; and Sandrart had seen a\r\nhundred. The latter, in speaking of those impressions, expresses a\r\nsuspicion of the original blocks having been destroyed in a fire at\r\nAugsburg; their subsequent discovery, however, at Ambras and Gratz,\r\nshows that his suspicion was not well founded. On the discovery of those\r\nblocks it was supposed that the remainder of the series, as described in\r\nthe manuscript, might also be still in existence; but after a diligent\r\nsearch no more have been found. It is indeed highly probable that the\r\nfurther progress of the work had been interrupted by Maximilian’s death,\r\nand that if any more of the series were finished, the number must have\r\nbeen few. About 1775, a few impressions were taken from the blocks\r\npreserved at Ambras, and also from those at Gratz; but no collection of\r\nthe whole accompanied with text was ever printed until 1796, when an\r\nedition in large folio was printed at Vienna by permission of the\r\nAustrian government, and with the name of J. Edwards, then a bookseller\r\nin Pall-Mall, on the title-page, as the London publisher. It is much to\r\nbe regretted that greater pains were not taken to afford the reader\r\nevery information that could be obtained with respect to the cuts; and\r\nit says very little for the English publisher’s patriotism that the\r\ntranslation of the original German descriptions should be in\r\nFrench;--but perhaps there might be a reason for this, for, where no\r\nprecise meaning is to be conveyed, French is certainly much better than\r\nEnglish. From the fact of several of the subjects not being contained in\r\nthe original drawings, and from the great difference in the style of\r\nmany of the cuts, it is by no means certain that they were all intended\r\nfor the same work. There can, however, be little doubt of their all\r\nhaving been designed for a triumphal procession intended to celebrate\r\nthe fame of Maximilian.\r\n\r\nThe original blocks, now preserved in the Imperial Library at Vienna,\r\nare all of pear-tree, and several of them are partially worm-eaten. At\r\nthe back of those blocks are written or engraved seventeen names and\r\ninitials, which are supposed, with great probability, to be those of\r\nthe engravers by whom they were executed. At the back of No. 18, which\r\nrepresents five musicians in a car, there is written, “Der kert an\r\ndie Elland,--hat _Wilhelm geschnitten_:” that is, “This follows the\r\nElks.--Engraved by William.” In the preceding cut, No. 17, are\r\nthe two elks which draw the car, and on one of the traces is Hans\r\nBurgmair’s mark. At the back of No. 20 is written, “_Jobst putavit,\r\n14 Aprilis 1517. Die gehert an die bifel, und die bifel halt Jos\r\ngeschnitten._”[V-73] This inscription Mr. Ottley, at page 756, volume\r\nii. of his Inquiry, expounds as follows: “Josse putavit (perhaps for\r\n_punctavit_), the 14th of April, 1517. This block joins to that which\r\nrepresents the Buffaloes.” This translation is substantially correct;\r\nbut it is exceedingly doubtful if _putavit_ was written in mistake for\r\n_punctavit_. The proposed substitution indeed seems very like explaining\r\nan _ignotum per ignotius_. The verb _punctare_ is never, that I am aware\r\nof, used by any writer, either classical or modern, to express the idea\r\nof engraving on wood. A German, however, who was but imperfectly\r\nacquainted with Latin, would not be unlikely to translate the German\r\nverb _schneiden_, which signifies _to cut_ generally, by the Latin\r\n_putare_, which is specially applied to the lopping or pruning of trees.\r\nI have heard it conjectured that _putavit_ might have been used in the\r\nsense of _imaginavit_, as if Jobst were the designer; but there can be\r\nlittle doubt of its being here intended to express the cutting of the\r\nwood-engraver; for Burgmair’s mark is to be found both on this cut and\r\non the preceding one of the two buffaloes, No. 19; and it cannot for a\r\nmoment be supposed that he was a mere workman employed to execute the\r\ndesigns of another person. Were such a supposition granted, it would\r\nfollow that the wood-engraver of that period--at least so far as regards\r\nthe work in question--was considered as a much superior person to\r\nhim who drew the designs; that the _workman_, in fact, was to be\r\ncommemorated, but the _artist_ forgotten; a conclusion which is\r\ndiametrically opposed to fact, for so little were the mere\r\nwood-engravers of that period esteemed, that we only incidentally become\r\nacquainted with their names; and from their not putting their marks or\r\ninitials to the cuts which they engraved has arisen the popular error\r\nthat Durer, Cranach, Burgmair, and others, who are known to have been\r\npainters of great repute in their day, were wood-engravers and executed\r\nthemselves the wood-cuts which bear their marks.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-73: _Jobst_ and _Jos_, in this inscription, are\r\n    probably intended for the name of the same person. For the name\r\n    Jobst, Jost, Josse, or Jos--for it is thus variously spelled--we\r\n    have no equivalent in English. It is not unusual in Germany as a\r\n    baptismal name--it can scarcely be called _Christian_--and is\r\n    Latinized, I believe, under the more lengthy form of _Jodocus_.]\r\n\r\nThe following are the names and initial letters at the back of the\r\nblocks. 1. Jerome André, called also Jerome Resch, or Rösch, the\r\nengraver of the Triumphal Arch designed by Albert Durer. 2. Jan de Bonn.\r\n3. Cornelius. 4. Hans Frank. 5. Saint German. 6. Wilhelm. 7. Corneille\r\nLiefrink. 8. Wilhelm Liefrink. 9. Alexis Lindt. 10. Josse de Negker. On\r\nseveral of the blocks Negker is styled, “engraver on wood, at Augsburg.”\r\n11. Vincent Pfarkecher. 12. Jaques Rupp. 13. Hans Schaufflein. 14. Jan\r\nTaberith. 15. F. P. 16. H. F. 17. W. R. It is not unlikely that\r\n“Cornelius,” No. 3, may be the same as Corneille Liefrink, No. 7; and\r\nthat “Wilhelm,” No. 6, and Wilhelm Liefrink, No. 8, may also be the same\r\nperson. At the back of the block which corresponds with the description\r\nnumbered 120, Hans Schaufflein’s name is found coupled with that of\r\nCornelius Liefrink; and at the back of the cut which corresponds with\r\nthe description numbered 121 Schaufflein’s name occurs alone.[V-74] The\r\noccurrence of Schaufflein’s name at the back of the cuts would certainly\r\nseem to indicate that he was one of the engravers; but his name also\r\nappearing at the back of that described under No. 120, in conjunction\r\nwith the name of Cornelius Liefrink, who was certainly a\r\nwood-engraver,[V-75] makes me inclined to suppose that he might only\r\nhave made the drawing on the block and not have engraved the cut; and\r\nthis supposition seems to be partly confirmed by the fact that the cuts\r\nwhich are numbered 104, 105, and 106, corresponding with the\r\ndescriptions Nos. 119, 120, and 121, have not Hans Burgmair’s mark, and\r\nare much more like the undoubted designs of Hans Schaufflein than those\r\nof that artist. That the cuts published under the title of the Triumphs\r\nof Maximilian were not all drawn on the block by the same person will,\r\nI think, appear probable to any one who even cursorily examines them;\r\nand whoever carefully compares them can scarcely have a doubt on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-74: The printed numbers on those two cuts are 105 and\r\n    106, though the descriptions are numbered 120 and 121 in the text.\r\n    The subjects are, No. 105, two ranks, of five men each, on foot,\r\n    carrying long lances; and No. 106, two ranks, of five men each, on\r\n    foot, carrying large two-handed swords on their\r\n    shoulders.--Perhaps it may not be out of place to correct here the\r\n    following passage which occurs at page 285 of this volume:\r\n    “Bartsch, however, observes, that ‘what Strutt has said about\r\n    there being two persons of this name [Hans Schaufflein], an elder\r\n    and a younger, seems to be a mere conjecture.’” Since the sheet\r\n    containing this passage was printed off, I have learnt from a\r\n    paper, in Meusel’s Neue Miscellaneen, 5tes. Stück, S. 210, that\r\n    Hans Schäufflein had a son of the same name who was also a\r\n    painter, and that the elder Schäufflein died at Nordlingen, in\r\n    1539. At page 281, his death, on the authority of Bartsch, is\r\n    erroneously placed in 1550.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-75: The name of Cornelius Liefrink occurs at the back\r\n    of some of the wood-cuts representing the saints of the family of\r\n    Maximilian, designed by Burgmair, mentioned at page 278, note.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From No. 15. With Burgmair’s mark.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From No. 65. Apparently not drawn by Burgmair.]\r\n\r\nAlmost every one of the cuts that contains Burgmair’s mark, in the\r\nTriumphal Procession, is designed with great spirit, and has evidently\r\nbeen drawn by an artist who had a thorough command of his pencil. His\r\nhorses are generally strong and heavy, and the men on their backs of a\r\nstout and muscular form. The action of the horses seems natural; and the\r\nindications of the joints and the drawing of the hoofs--which are mostly\r\nlow and broad--evidently show that the artist had paid some attention to\r\nthe structure of the animal. There are, however, a considerable number\r\nof cuts where both men and horses appear remarkable for their leanness;\r\nand in which the hoofs of the horses are most incorrectly drawn, and the\r\naction of the animals represented in a manner which is by no means\r\nnatural. Though it is not unlikely that Hans Burgmair was capable of\r\ndrawing both a stout, heavy horse, and a long-backed, thin-quartered,\r\nlean one, I cannot persuade myself that he would, in almost every\r\ninstance, draw the hoofs and legs of the one correctly, and those of the\r\nother with great inaccuracy. The cut on the opposite page and the five\r\nnext following, of single figures, copied on a reduced scale from the\r\nTriumphs, will exemplify the preceding observations. The numbers are\r\nthose printed on the cuts, and they all, except one, appear to\r\ncorrespond with the French descriptions in the text. The preceding cut\r\nis from that marked No. 15. The mark of Hans Burgmair is on the\r\nornamental breast-plate, as an English saddler would call it, that\r\npasses across the horse’s chest. This figure, in the original cut,\r\ncarries a tablet suspended from a staff, of which the lower part only is\r\nperceived in the copy, as it has not been thought necessary to give the\r\ntablet and a large scroll which were intended to contain\r\ninscriptions.[V-76] The description of the subject is to the following\r\neffect: “After the chase, comes a figure on horseback, bearing a tablet,\r\non which shall be written the five charges of the court,--that is, of\r\nthe butler, the cook, the barber, the tailor, and the shoemaker; and\r\nEberbach shall be the under-marshal of the household, and carry the\r\ntablet.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-76: In all the blocks, the tablets and scrolls, and\r\n    the upper part of banners intended to receive verses and\r\n    inscriptions, were left unengraved. In order that the appearance\r\n    of the cuts might not be injured, the black ground, intended for\r\n    the letters, was cut away in most of the tablets and scrolls, in\r\n    the edition of 1796.]\r\n\r\nThe cut on page 295 is a reduced copy of a figure, the last, in No. 65,\r\nwhich is without Burgmair’s mark. In the original the horseman bears a\r\nbanner, having on it the arms of the state or city which he represents;\r\nand at the top of the banner a black space whereon a name or motto ought\r\nto have been engraved. The original cut contains three figures; and, if\r\nthe description can be relied on, the banners which they bear are those\r\nof Fribourg, Bregentz, and Saulgau. The other two horsemen and their\r\nsteeds in No. 65 are still more unlike those in the cuts which contain\r\nBurgmair’s mark.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From No. 33. With Burgmair’s mark.]\r\n\r\nThe above cut is a reduced copy of a figure on horseback in No. 33.\r\nBurgmair’s mark, an H and a B, may be perceived on the trappings of the\r\nhorse. This figure, in the original, bears a large tablet, and he is\r\nfollowed by five men on foot carrying flails, the _swingels_[V-77] of\r\nwhich are of leather. The description of the cut,--which forms the first\r\nof seven representing the dresses and arms of combatants on foot,--is as\r\nfollows: “Then shall come a person mounted and properly habited like a\r\nmaster of arms, and he shall carry the tablet containing the rhyme.\r\nItem, Hans Hollywars shall be the master of arms, and his rhyme shall be\r\nthis effect: that he has professed the noble practice of arms at the\r\ncourt, according to the method devised by the emperor.”[V-78]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-77: That part of the flail which comes in contact with\r\n    the corn is, in the North of England, termed a _swingel_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-78: The substance of almost every rhyme and\r\n    inscription is, that the person who bears the rhyme-tablet or\r\n    scroll has derived great improvement in his art or profession from\r\n    the instructions or suggestions of the emperor. Huntsmen,\r\n    falconers, trumpeters, organists, fencing-masters, ballet-masters,\r\n    tourniers, and jousters, all acknowledge their obligations in this\r\n    respect to Maximilian. For the wit and humour of the jesters and\r\n    the natural fools, the emperor, with great forbearance, takes to\r\n    himself no credit; and Anthony von Dornstett, the leader of the\r\n    drummers and fifers, is one of the few whose art he has not\r\n    improved.]\r\n\r\nThe following is a reduced copy of a figure in the cut erroneously\r\nnumbered 83, but which corresponds with the description that refers to\r\n84. This figure is the last of the three, who, in the original, are\r\nrepresented bearing banners containing the arms of Malines, Salins and\r\nAntwerp.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From No. 83. Apparently not drawn by Burgmair.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: From No. 27. With Burgmair’s mark.]\r\n\r\nThe following figure, who is given with his rhyme-tablet in full, is\r\ncopied from the cut numbered 27. This jovial-looking personage, as we\r\nlearn from the description, is the Will Somers of Maximilian’s court,\r\nand he figures as the leader of the professed jesters and the natural\r\nfools, who appear in all ages to have been the subjects of “pleasant\r\nmirth.” The instructions to the painter are as follows: “Then shall come\r\none on horseback habited like a jester, and carrying a rhyme-tablet for\r\nthe jesters and natural fools; and he shall be Conrad von der Rosen.”\r\nThe fool’s cap with the bell at the peak, denoting his profession, is\r\nperceived hanging on his left shoulder; and on the breast-plate,\r\ncrossing the chest of the horse, is Burgmair’s mark.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 74. Apparently not drawn by Burgmair.]\r\n\r\nThe figure on page 299 of a horseman, bearing the banner of Burgundy, is\r\nfrom the cut numbered 74. The drawing both of rider and horse is\r\nextremely unlike the style of Burgmair as displayed in those cuts which\r\ncontain his mark. Burgmair’s men are generally stout, and their\r\nattitudes free; and they all appear to sit well on horseback. The\r\npresent lean, lanky figure, who rides a horse that seems admirably\r\nsuited to him, cannot have been designed by Burgmair, unless he was\r\naccustomed to design in two styles which were the very opposites of each\r\nother; the one distinguished by the freedom and the boldness of the\r\ndrawing, the stoutness of the men, and the bulky form of the horses\r\nintroduced; and the other remarkable for laboured and stiff drawing,\r\ngaunt and meagre men, and leggy, starved-like cattle. The whole of the\r\ncuts from No. 57 to No. 88, inclusive,--representing, except\r\nthree,[V-79] men on horseback bearing the banners of the kingdoms and\r\nstates either possessed or claimed by the emperor,--are designed in the\r\nlatter style. Not only are the men and horses represented according to a\r\ndifferent standard, but even the very ground is indicated in a different\r\nmanner; it seems to abound in fragments of stones almost like a\r\nMacadamized road after a shower of rain. There is indeed no lack of\r\nstones on Burgmair’s ground, but they appear more like rounded pebbles,\r\nand are not scattered about with so liberal a hand as in the cuts\r\nalluded to. In not one of those cuts which are so unlike Burgmair’s is\r\nthe mark of that artist to be found; and their general appearance is so\r\nunlike that of the cuts undoubtedly designed by him, that any person in\r\nthe least acquainted with works of art will, even on a cursory\r\nexamination, perceive the strongly marked difference.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-79: Those three are the numbers 77, 78, 79,\r\n    representing musicians on horseback. The same person who drew the\r\n    standard-bearers has evidently drawn those three cuts also.]\r\n\r\nThe following cut is a reduced copy of that numbered 57; and which is\r\nthe first of those representing horsemen bearing the banners of the\r\nseveral kingdoms, states, and cities subject to the house of Austria or\r\nto which Maximilian laid claim. It is one of the most gorgeous of the\r\nseries; but, from the manner in which the horses and their riders are\r\nrepresented, I feel convinced that it has not been drawn by Burgmair.\r\nThe subject is thus described in the emperor’s directions prefixed to\r\nthe volume: “One on horseback bearing the banner of the arms of Austria;\r\nanother on horseback bearing the old Austrian arms; another also on\r\nhorseback bearing the arms of Stiria.” On the parts which are left black\r\nin the banners it had been intended to insert inscriptions. The\r\ninstructions to the painter for this part of the procession are to the\r\nfollowing effect: “One on horseback bearing on a lance a rhyme-tablet.\r\nThen the arms of the hereditary dominions of the house of Austria on\r\nbanners, with their shields, helms, and crests, borne by horsemen; and\r\nthe banners of those countries in which the emperor has carried on war\r\nshall be borne by riders in armour; and the painter shall vary the\r\narmour according to the old manner. The banners of those countries in\r\nwhich the emperor has not carried on war shall be borne by horsemen\r\nwithout armour, but all splendidly clothed, each according to the\r\ncostume of the country he represents. Every one shall wear a laurel\r\nwreath.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 57. Apparently not drawn by Burgmair.]\r\n\r\nThe cut on the next page is copied from that numbered 107, but which\r\naccords with the description of No. 122. The subject is described by the\r\nemperor as follows: “Then shall come riding a man of Calicut, naked,\r\nexcept his loins covered with a girdle, bearing a rhyme-tablet, on which\r\nshall be inscribed these words, ‘These people are the subjects of the\r\nfamous crowns and houses heretofore named.’” In this cut the mark of\r\nBurgmair is perceived on the harness on the breast of the elephant.\r\nThere are two other cuts of Indians belonging to the same part of the\r\nprocession, each of which also contains Burgmair’s mark.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 107. With Burgmair’s mark.]\r\n\r\nThe cuts which were to follow the Indians and close the procession were\r\nthe baggage-waggons and camp-followers of the army. Of those there are\r\nfive cuts in the work published in 1796, and it is evident that some are\r\nwanting, for the two which may be considered as the first and last of\r\nthose five, respectively require a preceding and a following cut to\r\nrender them complete; and there are also one or two cuts wanting to\r\ncomplete the intermediate subjects. Those cuts are referred to in the\r\nFrench description under Nos. 125 to 129, but they are numbered 129,\r\n128, 110, 111, 125. The last three, as parts of a large subject, follow\r\neach other as the numbers are here placed; and though the right side of\r\nNo. 110 accords with the left of No. 128, inasmuch as they each contain\r\nthe half of a tree which appears complete when they are joined together,\r\nyet there are no horses in No. 128 to draw the waggon which is seen in\r\nNo. 110. The order of Nos. 110, 111, and 125, is easily ascertained;\r\na horse at the left of No. 110 wants a tail which is to be found in\r\nNo. 111; and the outline of a mountain in the left of No. 111 is\r\ncontinued in the right of No. 125. From the back-grounds, trees, and\r\nfigures in those cuts I am very much inclined to think that they have\r\nbeen engraved from designs by Albert Durer, if he did not actually draw\r\nthem on the block himself. There is no mark to be found on any of them;\r\nand they are extremely unlike any cuts which are undoubtedly of\r\nBurgmair’s designing, and they are decidedly superior to any that are\r\nusually ascribed to Hans Schaufflein. The following, which is a reduced\r\ncopy of that numbered 110, will perhaps afford some idea of those cuts,\r\nand enable persons who are acquainted with Durer’s works to judge for\r\nthemselves with respect to the probability of their having been engraved\r\nfrom his designs. One or two of the other four contain still more\r\nstriking resemblances of Durer’s style.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 110. Probably drawn by Albert Durer.]\r\n\r\nBesides the twelve cuts which, in the French preface to the Triumphal\r\nProcession of Maximilian, are said not to correspond with the original\r\ndrawings, there are also six others which the editor says are not to be\r\nfound in the original designs, and which he considers to have been\r\nadditions made to the work while it was in the course of engraving.\r\nThose six cuts are described in an appendix, where their numbers are\r\nsaid to be from 130 to 135. In No. 130 the principal figures are a king\r\nand queen, on horseback, supposed to be intended for Philip the Fair,\r\nson of the Emperor Maximilian, and his wife Joanna of Castile. This cut\r\nis very indifferently executed, and has evidently been designed by the\r\nartist who made the drawings for the questionable cuts containing the\r\ncomplicated locomotive carriages, mentioned at page 290. No. 131,\r\na princess on horseback, accompanied by two female attendants also on\r\nhorseback, and guards on foot, has evidently been designed by the same\r\nartist as No. 130. These two, I am inclined to think, belong to some\r\nother work. Nos. 132, 133, and 134, are from the designs of Hans\r\nBurgmair, whose mark is to be found on each; and there can be little\r\ndoubt of their having been intended for Maximilian’s Triumphal\r\nProcession. They form one continuous subject, which represents twelve\r\nmen, habited in various costume, leading the same number of horses\r\nsplendidly caparisoned. A figure on horseback bearing a rhyme-tablet\r\nleads this part of the procession; and above the horses are large\r\nscrolls probably intended to contain their names, with those of the\r\ncountries to which they belong. The cut on the opposite page is a\r\nreduced copy of the last, numbered 135, which is thus described in the\r\nappendix: “The fore part of a triumphal car, drawn by four horses yoked\r\nabreast, and managed by a winged female figure who holds in her left\r\nhand a wreath of laurel.” There is no mark on the original cut; but from\r\nthe manner in which the horses are drawn it seems like one of Burgmair’s\r\ndesigning.\r\n\r\nThat the cuts of the Triumphal Procession of Maximilian were engraved by\r\ndifferent persons is certain from the names at their backs; and I think\r\nthe difference that is to be perceived in the style of drawing renders\r\nit in the highest degree probable that the subjects were designed, or at\r\nleast drawn on the wood, by different artists. I am inclined to think\r\nthat Burgmair drew very few besides those that contain his mark; the\r\ncuts of the banner-bearers I am persuaded are not of his drawing;\r\na third artist, of inferior talent, seems to have made the drawings of\r\nthe fanciful cars containing the emperor and his family; and the five\r\ncuts of the baggage-waggons and camp followers, appear, as I have\r\nalready said, extremely like the designs of Albert Durer. The best\r\nengraved cuts are to be found among those which contain Burgmair’s mark.\r\nSome of the banner-bearers are also very ably executed, though not in so\r\nfree or bold a manner; which I conceive to be owing to the more laboured\r\nstyle in which the subject has been drawn on the block. The mechanical\r\nsubjects, with their accompanying figures, are the worst engraved as\r\nwell as the worst drawn of the whole. The five cuts which I suppose to\r\nhave been designed by Albert Durer are engraved with great spirit, but\r\nnot so well as the best of those which contain the mark of Burgmair.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 135. Apparently designed by Burgmair.]\r\n\r\nThough there are still in existence upwards of a hundred of the original\r\nblocks designed by Albert Durer, and upwards of three hundred designed\r\nby the most eminent of his contemporaries, yet a person who professes to\r\nbe an instructor of the public on subjects of art made the following\r\nstatement before the Select Committee of the House of Commons on Arts\r\nand their Connexion with Manufactures, appointed in 1835. He is asked,\r\n“Do you consider that the progress of the arts in this country is\r\nimpeded by the want of protection for new inventions of importance?” and\r\nhe proceeds to enlighten the committee as follows. “Very much impeded.\r\nInventions connected with the arts of design, of new instruments, or new\r\nprocesses, for example, are, from the ease with which they can be\r\npirated, more difficult of protection than any other inventions\r\nwhatever. Such protection as the existing laws afford is quite\r\ninadequate. I cannot better illustrate my meaning, than by mentioning\r\nthe case of _engraving in metallic relief_, an art which is supposed to\r\nhave existed three or four centuries ago; and the re-discovery of which\r\nhas long been a desideratum among artists. Albert Durer, who was both a\r\npainter and engraver, _certainly possessed this art_, that is to say,\r\nthe art of transferring his designs, after they had been sketched on\r\npaper, _immediately into metallic relief_, so that they might be printed\r\nalong with letter-press. At present, the only sort of engravings you can\r\nprint along with letter-press are wood engravings, or stereotype casts\r\nfrom wood engravings; and then those engravings are but copies, and\r\noften very rude copies, of their originals; while, in the case of Albert\r\nDurer, it is QUITE CLEAR _that it was his own identical designs that\r\nwere transferred into the metallic relief_. Wood engravings, too, are\r\nlimited in point of size, _because they can only be executed on\r\nbox-wood_, the width of which is very small; in fact, we have no wood\r\nengravings on a single block of a larger size than octavo: when the\r\nengraving is larger, two or three blocks are joined together; but this\r\nis attended with so much difficulty and inconvenience, that it is seldom\r\ndone. From the specimens of _metallic relief engraving_, left us by\r\nAlbert Durer, there is every reason to infer that he was under no such\r\nlimitation; that he could produce plates of any size.”[V-80] This\r\nstatement abounds in errors, and may justify a suspicion that the person\r\nwho made it had never seen the cuts designed by Albert Durer which he\r\npretends were executed in “metallic relief.” At the commencement he says\r\nthat the art of engraving in metallic relief is _supposed_ to have\r\nexisted three or four centuries ago; and immediately afterwards he\r\nasserts that Albert Durer “certainly possessed this art;” as if by his\r\nmere word he could convert a groundless fiction into a positive fact.\r\nWhen he made this confident assertion he seems not to have been aware\r\nthat many of the original pear-tree blocks of the cuts pretendedly\r\nexecuted in metallic relief are still in existence; and when, speaking\r\nof the difficulty of getting blocks of a larger size than an octavo, he\r\nsays, “From the specimens of metallic relief engraving, left us by\r\nAlbert Durer, there is every reason to infer that he was under no such\r\nlimitation,--that he could produce plates of any size,” he affords a\r\npositive proof that he knows nothing of the subject on which he has\r\nspoken so confidently. Had he ever examined the large cuts engraved from\r\nDurer’s designs, he would have seen, in several, undeniable marks of the\r\njunction of the blocks, proving directly the reverse of what he asserts\r\non this point. What he says with respect to the modern practice of the\r\nart is as incorrect as his assertions about Albert Durer’s engraving in\r\nmetallic relief. Though it is true that there are few modern engravings\r\non box-wood of a larger size than octavo, it is not true that the\r\nforming of a large block of two or more pieces is attended with much\r\ndifficulty, and is seldom done. The making of such blocks is now a\r\nregular trade; they are formed without the least difficulty, and\r\nhundreds of cuts on such blocks are engraved in London every year.[V-81]\r\nWhen he says that wood engravings “can only be made on box-wood,” he\r\ngives another proof of his ignorance of the subject. Most of the earlier\r\nwood engravings were executed on blocks of pear-tree or crab; and even\r\nat the present time box-wood is seldom used for the large cuts on\r\nposting-bills. In short, every statement that this person has made on\r\nthe subject of wood and pretended metallic relief engraving is\r\nincorrect; and it is rather surprising that none of the members of the\r\ncommittee should have exposed his ignorance. When such persons put\r\nthemselves forward as the instructors of mechanics on the subject of\r\nart, it cannot be a matter of surprise that in the arts as applied to\r\nmanufactures we should be inferior to our continental neighbours.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-80: Minutes of Evidence before the Select Committee on\r\n    Arts and Manufactures, p. 130. Ordered to be printed, 16th August\r\n    1836.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-81: Among the principal modern wood-cuts engraved on\r\n    blocks consisting of several pieces the following may be\r\n    mentioned: The Chillingham Bull, by Thomas Bewick, 1789; A view of\r\n    St. Nicholas’ Church, Newcastle-on-Tyne, by Charlton Nesbit, from\r\n    a drawing by R. Johnson, 1798; The Diploma of the Highland\r\n    Society, by Luke Clennell, from a design by B. West, P.R.A. 1808;\r\n    The Death of Dentatus, by William Harvey, from a painting by B. R.\r\n    Haydon, 1821; and The Old Horse waiting for Death, left\r\n    unfinished, by T. Bewick, and published in 1832.]\r\n\r\nThe art of imitating drawings--called chiaro-scuro--by means of\r\nimpressions from two or more blocks, was cultivated with great success\r\nin Italy by Ugo da Carpi about 1518. The invention of this art, as has\r\nbeen previously remarked, is ascribed to him by some writers, but\r\nwithout any sufficient grounds; for not even the slightest evidence has\r\nbeen produced by them to show that he, or any other Italian artist, had\r\nexecuted a single cut in this manner previous to 1509, the date of a\r\nchiaro-scuro wood engraving from a design by Lucas Cranach. Though it is\r\nhighly probable that Ugo da Carpi was not the inventor of this art, it\r\nis certain that he greatly improved it. The chiaro-scuros executed by\r\nhim are not only superior to those of the German artists, who most\r\nlikely preceded him in this department of wood engraving, but to the\r\npresent time they remain unsurpassed. In the present day Mr. George\r\nBaxter has attempted to extend the boundaries of this art by calling in\r\nthe aid of aquatint for his outlines and first ground, and by copying\r\nthe positive colours of an oil or water-colour painting. Most of Ugo da\r\nCarpi’s chiaro-scuros are from Raffaele’s designs, and it is said that\r\nthe great painter himself drew some of the subjects on the blocks.\r\nIndependent of the excellence of the designs, the characteristics of Da\r\nCarpi’s chiaro-scuros are their effect and the simplicity of their\r\nexecution; for all of them, except one or two, appear to have been\r\nproduced from not more than three blocks. The following may be mentioned\r\nas the principal of Da Carpi’s works in this style. A Sibyl reading with\r\na boy holding a torch, from two blocks, said by Vasari to be the\r\nartist’s first attempt in this style; Jacob’s Dream; David cutting off\r\nthe head of Goliah; the Death of Ananias; Giving the Keys to Peter; the\r\nmiraculous Draught of Fishes; the Descent from the Cross; the\r\nResurrection; and Æneas carrying away his father Anchises on his\r\nshoulders from the fire of Troy;[V-82] all the preceding from the\r\ndesigns of Raffaele. Among the subjects designed by other masters are\r\nSt. Peter preaching, after Polidoro; and Diogenes showing the plucked\r\ncock in ridicule of Plato’s definition of man, “a two-legged animal\r\nwithout feathers,” after Parmegiano. The latter, which is remarkably\r\nbold and spirited, is from four blocks; and Vasari says that it is the\r\nbest of all Da Carpi’s chiaro-scuros. Many of Da Carpi’s productions in\r\nthis style were copied by Andrea Andreani of Milan, about 1580. That of\r\nÆneas carrying his father on his shoulders was copied by Edward Kirkall,\r\nan English engraver in 1722. Kirkall’s copy is not entirely from\r\nwood-blocks, like the original; the outlines and the greater part of the\r\nshadows are from a copper-plate engraved in mezzotint, in a manner\r\nsimilar to that which has more recently been adopted by Mr. Baxter in\r\nhis picture-printing.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-82: At the foot of this cut, to the right, after the\r\n    name of the designer,--“RAPHAEL URBINAS,”--is the following\r\n    privilege, granted by Pope Leo X. and the Doge of Venice,\r\n    prohibiting all persons from pirating the work. “QUISQUE HAS\r\n    TABELLAS INVITO AUTORE IMPRIMET EX DIVI LEONIS X. ET IL͞L\r\n    PRINCIPIS VENETIARUM DECRETIS EXCOMINICATIONIS SENTENTIAM ET ALIAS\r\n    PENAS INCURRET.” Below this inscription is the engraver’s name\r\n    with the date: “Romæ apud Ugum de Carpi impressum. MDXVIII.”]\r\n\r\nLucas Dammetz, generally called Lucas van Leyden, from the place of his\r\nbirth, was an excellent engraver on copper, and in this branch of art\r\nmore nearly approached Durer than any other of his German or Flemish\r\ncontemporaries. He is said to have been born at Leyden in 1496; and, if\r\nthis date be correct, he at a very early age gave decided proofs of his\r\ntalents as an engraver on copper. One of his earliest prints, the monk\r\nSergius killed by Mahomet, is dated 1508, when he was only fourteen\r\nyears of age; and at the age of twelve he is said to have painted, in\r\ndistemper, a picture of St. Hubert which excited the admiration of all\r\nthe artists of the time. Of his numerous copper-plate engravings there\r\nare no less than twenty-one which, though they contain no date, are\r\nsupposed to have been executed previously to 1508. As several of those\r\nplates are of very considerable merit, it would appear that Lucas while\r\nyet a boy excelled, as a copper-plate engraver, most of his German and\r\nDutch contemporaries. From 1508 to 1533, the year of his death, he\r\nappears to have engraved not less than two hundred copper-plates; and,\r\nas if these were not sufficient to occupy his time, he in the same\r\nperiod painted several pictures, some of which were of large size. He is\r\nalso said to have excelled as a painter on glass; and like Durer,\r\nCranach, and Burgmair, he is ranked among the wood engravers of that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe wood-cuts which contain the mark of Lucas van Leyden, or which are\r\nusually ascribed to him, are not numerous; and, even admitting them to\r\nhave been engraved by himself, the fact would contribute but little to\r\nhis fame, for I have not seen one which might not have been executed by\r\na professional “formschneider” of very moderate abilities. The total of\r\nthe wood-cuts supposed to have been engraved by him does not exceed\r\ntwenty. The following is a reduced copy of a wood-cut ascribed to Lucas\r\nvan Leyden, in the Print Room of the British Museum, but which is not in\r\nBartsch’s Catalogue, nor in the list of Lucas van Leyden’s engravings in\r\nMeusel’s Neue Miscellaneen. Though I very much question if the original\r\ncut were engraved by Lucas himself, I have no doubt of its being from\r\nhis design. It represents the death of Sisera; and, with a noble\r\ncontempt of the unity of time, Jael is seen giving Sisera a drink of\r\nmilk, driving the nail into his head, and then showing the body,--with\r\nherself in the act of driving the nail,--to Barak and his followers: the\r\nabsurdity of this threefold action has perhaps never been surpassed in\r\nany cut ancient or modern. Sir Boyle Roach said that it was impossible\r\nfor any _person_, except a _bird_ or a _fish_, to be in two places at\r\nonce; but here we have a pictorial representation of a female being in\r\nno less than three; and in one of the localities actually pointing out\r\nto certain persons how she was then employed in another.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nHeineken, in his account of engravers of the Flemish school, has either\r\ncommitted an egregious mistake, or expressed himself with intentional\r\nambiguity with respect to a wood-cut printed at Antwerp, and which he\r\nsaw in the collections of the Abbé de Marolles. His notice of this cut\r\nis as follows: “I found in the collections of the Abbé de Marolles, in\r\nthe cabinet of the King of France, a detached piece, which, in my\r\nopinion, is the most ancient of the wood engravings executed in the Low\r\nCountries which bear the name of the artist. This cut is marked,\r\n_Gheprint t’ Antwerpen by my Phillery de figursnider_--Printed at\r\nAntwerp, by me Phillery, the engraver of figures. It serves as a proof\r\nthat the engravers of moulds were, at Antwerp, in that ancient time,\r\nalso printers.”[V-83]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-83: “J’ai trouvé dans les Recueils de l’Abbé de\r\n    Marolles, au Cabinet du Roi de France, une piece détachée, qui,\r\n    suivant mon sentiment, est la plus ancienne de celles, qui sont\r\n    gravées en bois dans les Païs-Bas, et qui portent le nom de\r\n    l’artiste. Cette estampe est marquée: _Gheprint t’ Antwerpen by my\r\n    Phillery de figursnider--Imprimé à Anvers, chez moi Phillery, le\r\n    graveur de figures_. Elle sert de preuve, que les graveurs de\r\n    moules étoient aussi, dans cet ancien tems, imprimeurs à\r\n    Anvers.”--Idée Générale d’une Collection complette d’Estampes,\r\n    p. 197.]\r\n\r\nIn this vague and ambiguous account, the writer gives us no idea of the\r\nperiod to which he refers in the words “cet ancien tems.” If he means\r\nthe time between the pretended invention of Coster, and the period when\r\ntypography was probably first practised in the Low Countries,--that is,\r\nfrom about 1430 to 1472,--he is wrong, and his statement would afford\r\nground for a presumption that he had either examined the cut very\r\ncarelessly, or that he was so superficially acquainted with the\r\nprogressive improvement of the art of wood engraving as to mistake a cut\r\nabounding in cross-hatching, and certainly executed subsequent to 1524,\r\nfor one that had been executed about seventy years previously, when\r\ncross-hatching was never attempted, and when the costume was as\r\ndifferent from that of the figures represented in the cut as the costume\r\nof Vandyke’s portraits is dissimilar to Hogarth’s. The words “_graveurs\r\nde moules_,” I have translated literally “engravers of moulds,” for I\r\ncannot conceive what else Heineken can mean; but this expression is\r\nscarcely warranted by the word “_figuersnider_” on the cut, which is\r\nalmost the same as the German “formschneider;” and whatever might be the\r\noriginal meaning of the word, it was certainly used to express merely a\r\nwood engraver. Compilers of Histories of Art, and Dictionaries of\r\nPainters and Engravers, who usually follow their leader, even in his\r\nslips, as regularly as a flock of sheep follow the bell-wether through a\r\ngap, have disseminated Heineken’s mistake, and the antiquity of\r\n“_Phillery’s_” wood-engraving is about as firmly established as Lawrence\r\nCoster’s invention of typography. One of those “straightforward” people\r\nhas indeed gone rather beyond his authority; for in a “Dictionary of the\r\nFine Arts,” published in 1826, we are expressly informed that\r\n“_Phillery, who lived near the end of the fourteenth century, was the\r\nfirst engraver on wood who practised in the Netherlands_.”[V-84] It is\r\nthus that error on the subject of art, and indeed on every other\r\nsubject, is propagated: a writer of reputation makes an incorrect or an\r\nambiguous statement; other writers adopt it without examination, and not\r\nunfrequently one of that class whose confidence in deciding on a\r\nquestion is in the inverse ratio of their knowledge of the subject,\r\nproceeds beyond his original authority, and declares that to be certain\r\nwhich previously had only been doubtfully or obscurely expressed. In\r\nHeineken’s notice of this cut there is an implied qualification under\r\nwhich he might screen himself from a charge of incorrectness with\r\nrespect to the time of its execution, though not from a charge of\r\nambiguity. He says that, in his opinion, it is “the most ancient of the\r\nwood engravings executed in the Low Countries _which bear the name of\r\nthe artist_;” and with this limitation his opinion may be correct,\r\nalthough the cut were only engraved in 1525 or 1526; for I am not aware\r\nof any wood engraving of an earlier date, executed in the Low Countries,\r\nthat contains the _name_ of the artist, though there are several which\r\ncontain the artist’s mark. It also may be argued that the words “_cet\r\nancien tems_” might be about as correctly applied to designate the year\r\n1525 as 1470: if, however, he meant the first of those dates, he has\r\nexpressed himself in an equivocal manner, for he is generally understood\r\nto refer the cut to a considerably earlier period. It has been indeed\r\nconjectured that Heineken, in speaking of this cut, might intentionally\r\nexpress himself obscurely, in order that he might not give offence to\r\nhis friend Monsieur Mariette, who is said to have considered it to be\r\none of the earliest specimens of wood engravings executed in the Low\r\nCountries. This is, however, without any sufficient reason, merely\r\nshifting the charge of ignorance, with respect to the difference of\r\nstyle in wood engravings of different periods, from Heineken to Monsieur\r\nMariette. As there is no evidence to show that the latter ever expressed\r\nany such opinion as that ascribed to him respecting the antiquity of the\r\ncut in question, Heineken alone is answerable for the account contained\r\nin his book. Impressions of the cut by “_Phillery_” are not of very\r\ngreat rarity; there are two in the Print Room at the British Museum, and\r\nfrom one of them the reduced copy in the following page has been\r\ncarefully made.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-84: In a work of a similar kind, and of equal\r\n    authority, published in 1834, we are informed that Ugo da Carpi\r\n    was a historical painter, and that he died in 1500. He was only\r\n    born in 1486.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nAny person, however, slightly acquainted with the progress of wood\r\nengraving could scarcely fail to pronounce that the original of this cut\r\nmust have been executed subsequent to 1500, and in all probability\r\nsubsequent to the cuts of the Triumphal Procession of Maximilian, to the\r\ngeneral style of which, so far as relates to the manner of engraving, it\r\nbears considerable resemblance. The costume of the figures, too, also\r\nproves that it does not belong to the fifteenth century; and on\r\ncarefully examining the inscription, a person accustomed to the old\r\nGerman or Dutch characters would be more likely to read “_Willem_” than\r\n“_Phillery_” as the name of the artist. To one of the impressions in the\r\nBritish Museum a former owner, after extracting Heineken’s account, has\r\nappended the following remark: “This is the print above described. There\r\nseems to be an inconsiderable mistake in the name, which I take to be\r\nD’villery.” It is to be observed that in the original, as in the\r\npreceding copy, the inscription is engraved on wood, and not set up in\r\ntype; and that consequently the first character of the doubtful name is\r\nrather indistinct. It is however most probably a _W_; and the last is\r\ncertainly an _m_, with a flourish at its tail. The intermediate letters\r\n_ille_ are plain enough, and if the first be supposed to be a _W_, and\r\nthe last an _m_, we have the name _Willem_,--a very probable prenomen\r\nfor a Dutch wood engraver of the sixteenth century. The inscription when\r\ncarefully examined is literally as follows: “_Gheprint Tantwerpen Bij\r\nmij Willem de Figuersnider_.” Heineken’s mistake of _Phillery_ for\r\n_Willem_, or William, and thus giving a heretofore unheard-of name to\r\nthe list of artists, is not unlike that of Scopoli the naturalist, who,\r\nin one of his works, has commemorated “Horace Head” as a London\r\nbookseller.[V-85]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-85: The sign of Mr. Benjamin White, formerly a\r\n    bookseller in Fleet Street, was Horace’s Head. In Scopoli’s\r\n    Deliciæ, Flora, et Fauna Insubriæ, plate 24 is thus inscribed:\r\n    “Auspiciis Benjamini White et Horatii Head, Bibliopol.\r\n    Londinensium.” The learned naturalist had mistaken Mr. White’s\r\n    sign for his partner in the business.]\r\n\r\nThough the cut which bears the name of the supposed “Phillery” contains\r\ninternal evidence of its not having been engraved in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, there is yet further reason to believe that it is merely a copy\r\nof part of a cut of the same size by a Swiss artist of the name of Urse\r\nGraff, which is dated 1524. There is an impression of Urse Graff’s cut\r\n[V-86] in the Print Room of the British Museum; in the fore-ground are\r\nthe figures which have obviously been copied by _Willem de\r\nFiguersnider_, alias _Phillery_, and immediately behind the middle\r\nfigure, who holds in his right hand a large Swiss espadon, is a leafless\r\ntree with a figure of Death clinging to the upper part of the trunk, and\r\npointing to a hour-glass which he holds in his left hand. A bird,\r\nprobably intended for a raven, is perched above the hour-glass; and on\r\nthe trunk of the tree, near to the figure of Death, is Urse Graff’s mark\r\nwith the date as is here given. The back-ground presents a view of a\r\nlake, with buildings and mountains on the left. The general character of\r\nUrse Graff’s subject is Swiss, both in the scenery and figures; and the\r\nperfect identity of the latter with those in the cut “printed at Antwerp\r\nby William the figure-cutter” proves, beyond the possibility of a doubt,\r\nthat one of those two artists has copied the work of the other. Urse\r\nGraff’s subject, however, is complete, and corresponds both in the\r\nlandscape and in the costume of the figures with the country of the\r\nartist; while the cut of William of Antwerp represents merely an\r\nunrelieved group of figures in the costume of Switzerland. Urse Graff\r\nwas an artist of reputation in his time; of “Willem,” who was probably\r\nonly an engraver of the designs of others, nothing more is known beyond\r\nwhat is afforded by the single cut in question. From these\r\ncircumstances, though it cannot be positively decided which of those\r\ncuts is the original, it is almost morally certain that the Flemish\r\nfigure-cutter has copied the work of the Swiss artist.--Urse Graff\r\nresided at Basle, of which city he was probably a native. In one of his\r\nengravings with the date 1523, he describes himself as a goldsmith and\r\ndie-sinker. Wood-cuts containing his mark are not very common, and the\r\nmost of them appear to have been executed between 1515 and 1528.\r\nA series of wood-cuts of the Passion of Christ, designed in a very\r\ninferior manner, and printed at Strasburg in 1509, are sometimes\r\nascribed to him on account of their being marked with the letters V. G.,\r\nwhich some writers have supposed to be the mark of an artist named Von\r\nGamperlin. Professor Christ, in his Dictionary of Monograms, says that\r\nhe can find nothing to determine him in favour of the name Gamperlin;\r\nand that he is rather inclined to think that those letters are intended\r\nfor the name Von Goar, which he believes that he has deciphered on an\r\nengraving containing this mark. The mark of Urse Graff, a V and a G\r\ninterlaced, occurs in the ornamented border of the title-page of several\r\nbooks printed at Basle, and amongst others on the title of a quarto\r\nedition of Ulrich Hutten’s Nemo, printed there by Frobenius in 1519. At\r\nthe end of this edition there is a beautifully-designed cut of the\r\nprinter’s device, which is probably the work of the same artist.[V-87]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-86: This cut of Urse Graff is described in Bartsch’s\r\n    Peintre-Graveur, tom. vii. p. 465, No. 16.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-87: The device of Frobenius at the end of an edition\r\n    of the same work, printed by him in 1518, is much inferior to that\r\n    in the edition of 1519. In both, the ornamental border of the\r\n    title-page is the same.]\r\n\r\nA painter, named Nicholas Emanuel Deutsch, a contemporary of Urse Graff,\r\nand who resided at Bern, is said, by Sandrart, to have been of a noble\r\nEnglish family, and the same writer adds that he left his own country on\r\naccount of his religion. The latter statement, however, is not likely to\r\nbe correct, for there are wood-cuts, with this artist’s mark, dated\r\n“Bern, 1518;” which was before the persecution in England on account of\r\nthe doctrines of Luther had commenced. In J. R. Füssli’s Dictionary of\r\nArtists it is stated that he was of a French family, of the name of\r\nCholard, but that he was born at Bern in 1484, and died there in 1530.\r\nHe was a poet as well as a painter, and held one of the highest offices\r\nin the magistracy of Bern.\r\n\r\nWithin the first thirty years of the sixteenth century the practice of\r\nillustrating books with wood-cuts seems to have been more general than\r\nat any other period, scarcely excepting the present; for though within\r\nthe last eight or ten years an immense number of wood-cuts have been\r\nexecuted in England and France, yet wood engravings at the time referred\r\nto were introduced into a greater variety of books, and the art was more\r\ngenerally practised throughout Europe. In modern German and Dutch works\r\nwood engravings are sparingly introduced; and in works printed in\r\nSwitzerland and Italy they are still more rarely to be found. In the\r\nformer period the art seems to have been very generally practised\r\nthroughout Europe, though to a greater extent, and with greater skill,\r\nin Germany than in any other country. The wood-cuts which are to be\r\nfound in Italian books printed between 1500 and 1530 are mostly meagre\r\nin design and very indifferently engraved; and for many years after the\r\nGerman wood engravers had begun to give variety of colour and richness\r\nof effect to their cuts by means of cross-hatchings, their Italian\r\ncontemporaries continued to adhere to the old method of engraving their\r\nfigures, chiefly in outline, with the shadows and the folds of the\r\ndraperies indicated by parallel lines. These observations relate only to\r\nthe ordinary wood engravings of the period, printed in the same page\r\nwith type, or printed separately in the usual manner of surface printing\r\nat one impression. The admirable chiaro-scuros of Ugo da Carpi, printed\r\nfrom two or more blocks, are for effect and general excellence the most\r\nadmirable specimens of this branch of the art that ever have been\r\nexecuted; they are as superior to the chiaro-scuros of German artists as\r\nthe usual wood engravings of the latter excel those executed in Italy\r\nduring the same period.\r\n\r\nIn point of drawing, some of the best wood-cuts executed in Italy in the\r\ntime of Albert Durer are to be found in a folio work entitled Triompho\r\ndi Fortuna, written by Sigismond Fanti, and printed at Venice in\r\n1527.[V-88] The subject of this work, which was licensed by Pope Clement\r\nVII, is the art of fortune-telling, or of answering all kinds of\r\nquestions relative to future events. The volume contains a considerable\r\nnumber of wood-cuts; some designed and executed in the very humblest\r\nstyle of wood engraving, and others, which appear to have been drawn on\r\nthe block with pen-and-ink, designed with great spirit. The smallest and\r\nmost inferior cuts serve as illustrations to the questions, and an idea\r\nmay be formed of them from the three here given, which occur under the\r\nquestion: “Qual fede o legge sia di queste tre la buona, o la\r\nChristiana, l’Hebrea, o quello di Mahumeto?”[V-89] In English: “Which of\r\nthese three religions is the best, the Christian, the Jewish, or the\r\nMahometan?” Several larger cuts are executed in a dry hard style, and\r\nevidently drawn by a person very inferior to the artist who designed the\r\ncuts executed in the manner of pen-and-ink drawings. The following is a\r\nfac-simile of one of the latter. It is entitled “Fortuna de Africo,” in\r\na series of twelve, intended for representations of the winds.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-88: The title of this book is, in red letters,\r\n    “Triompho di Fortuna, di Sigismondo Fanti, Ferrarese.” The\r\n    title-page is also ornamented with a wood-cut, representing the\r\n    Pope, with Virtue on one side, and Vice on the other, seated above\r\n    the globe, which is supported by Atlas, and provided with an axis,\r\n    having a handle at each side, like a winch. At one of the handles\r\n    is a devil, and at the other an angel; to the left is a naked\r\n    figure holding a die, and near to him is an astronomer taking an\r\n    observation. At the foot of the cut is the mark I. M. or T. M.,\r\n    for I cannot positively decide whether the first letter be\r\n    intended for an I or a T. The following is the colophon: “Impresso\r\n    in la inclita citta di Venegia per Agostin da Portese. Nel anno\r\n    dil virgineo parto MD.XXVII. Nel mese di Genaro, ad instātia di\r\n    Jacomo Giunta Mercatāte Florentino. Con il Privilegio di Clemente\r\n    Papa VII, et del Senato Veneto a requisitione di l’Autore.” In the\r\n    Catalogue of the British Museum this book is erroneously entered\r\n    as printed at Rome, 1526. The compiler had mistaken the date of\r\n    the Pope’s licence for the time when the book was printed. This\r\n    trifling mistake is noticed here, as from similar oversights\r\n    bibliographers have sometimes described books as having been twice\r\n    or thrice printed, when, in fact, there had been only one\r\n    edition.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-89: The following questions, selected from a number of\r\n    others, will perhaps afford some idea of this “Opera utilissima et\r\n    jocosa,” as it is called by the author. “Se glie bene a pigliar\r\n    bella, o bruta donna; se’l servo sara fidele al suo signore; se\r\n    quest’ anno sara carestia o abundantia; quanti mariti havera la\r\n    donna; se glie bene a far viaggio et a che tempo; se’l parto della\r\n    donna sara maschio o femina; se’l sogno fatto sara vero; se’l fin\r\n    del huomo sara buono.” The three small illustrations of the last\r\n    query are of evil omen; in one, is seen a gallows; in another,\r\n    a man praying; and in the third, the quarters of a human body hung\r\n    up in terrorem.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe following cut, which appears in folio 38, is intitled “Michael\r\nFiorentino,”--Michael Angelo; and it certainly conveys no bad idea of\r\nthe energetic manner in which that great artist is said to have used his\r\nmallet and chisel when engaged on works of sculpture. This cut, however,\r\nis made to represent several other sculptors besides the great\r\nFlorentine; it is repeated seven times in the subsequent pages, and on\r\neach occasion we find underneath it a different name. The late\r\nT. Stothard, R.A. was of opinion that wood engraving was best adapted to\r\nexpress pen-and-ink drawing, and that the wood engraver generally failed\r\nwhen he attempted more. His illustrations of Rogers’s poems, engraved on\r\nwood by Clennell and Thompson, are executed in a similar style to that\r\nof the following specimen, though with greater delicacy.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nCertain wood-cuts with the mark A. G., executed towards the conclusion\r\nof the fifteenth century, have been ascribed to an artist named Albert\r\nGlockenton. Bartsch, however, says that the name of the artist is\r\nunknown; and he seems to consider that Sandrart had merely conjectured\r\nthat those letters might represent the name Albert Glockenton. For no\r\nbetter reason the letters I. V. on a tablet, with two pilgrim’s-staffs\r\ncrossed between them, which are to be found on several old chiaro-scuro\r\nwood engravings, have been supposed to represent the name, John Ulric\r\nPilgrim. This name appears to be a pure invention of some ingenious\r\nexpounder of monograms, for there is not the slightest evidence, that I\r\nam aware of, to show that any artist of this name ever lived. The\r\nchiaro-scuros with this mark were probably executed in the time of\r\nDurer, but none of them contains a date to establish the fact. Heineken\r\nconsiders them to have been the productions of a German artist; and he\r\nrefers to them in proof of the art of chiaro-scuro having been practised\r\nin Germany long before the time of Ugo da Carpi. It is, however, highly\r\nquestionable if they are of an earlier date than 1518; and it is by no\r\nmeans certain that the artist was a German. By some persons he has been\r\nsupposed to have been the inventor of chiaro-scuro engraving, on no\r\nbetter grounds, it would seem, than that his pieces are without a date.\r\n\r\nNext to the Germans, in the time of Albert Durer, the Dutch and Flemings\r\nseem to have excelled in the art of wood engraving; but the cuts\r\nexecuted in Holland and Flanders are generally much inferior to those\r\ndesigned and engraved by German artists. In a considerable number of\r\nDutch wood engravings, of the period under review, I have observed an\r\nattempt to combine something like the effect of cross-hatching and of\r\nthe dotted manner mentioned at page 232 as having been frequently\r\npractised by French wood engravers in the early part of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. In a series of cuts from a Dutch prayer-book, apparently\r\nprinted between 1520 and 1530, this style of engraving is frequently\r\nintroduced. Where a German artist would have introduced lines crossing\r\neach other with great regularity, the Dutch wood engraver has\r\nendeavoured to attain his object by irregularly picking out portions of\r\nthe wood with the point of his graver; the effect, however, is not good.\r\nIn the border surrounding those cuts, a Dance of Death is represented,\r\nconsisting of several more characters than are to be found in the\r\ncelebrated work ascribed to Holbein, but far inferior in point of design\r\nand execution.\r\n\r\nAn artist, named John Walter van Assen, is usually mentioned as one of\r\nthe best Dutch wood engravers or designers of this period. Nothing\r\nfurther is known of him than that he lived at Amsterdam about 1517. The\r\nmark supposed to be Van Assen’s is often ascribed by expounders of\r\nmonograms to another artist whom they call Werner or Waer van Assanen.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of French works, printed in the time of Albert\r\nDurer, contain wood engravings, but few of them possess much merit when\r\ncompared with the more highly finished and correctly drawn productions\r\nof the German school of the same period. The ornamental borders,\r\nhowever, of many missals and prayer-books, which then issued in great\r\nnumbers from the Parisian press, frequently display great beauty. The\r\ntaste for surrounding each page with an ornamental border engraved on\r\nwood was very generally prevalent in Germany, France, and Flanders at\r\nthat period, more especially in devotional works; and in the former\r\ncountry, and in Switzerland, scarcely a tract was printed--and the\r\nLutheran controversy gave rise to many hundreds--without an ornamental\r\nborder surrounding the title. In Germany such wood engravers as were\r\nchiefly employed in executing cuts of this kind were called\r\n_Rahmen-schneiders_--border-cutters,--as has been previously observed at\r\npage 190. In England during the same period wood engraving made but\r\nlittle progress; and there seems to have been a lack of good designers\r\nand competent engravers in this country. The best cuts printed in\r\nEngland in the time of Durer are contained in a manual of prayers, of a\r\nsmall duodecimo size. On a tablet in the border of one of the cuts--the\r\nFlight into Egypt[V-90]--I perceive the date 1523. The total number of\r\ncuts in the volume is about a hundred; and under each of the largest are\r\nfour verses in English. Several of the smaller cuts, representing\r\nfigures of saints, and preceding the prayers for their respective days,\r\nhave evidently been designed by an artist of considerable talent. As\r\nmost of the wood-cuts which constitute the ornaments or the\r\nillustrations of books printed at this period are without any name or\r\nmark, it is impossible to ascertain the names of the persons by whom\r\nthey were designed or engraved.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-90: The following lines descriptive of this cut are\r\n    printed underneath it:\r\n\r\n      +How Mary and Joseph with iesu were fayne.\r\n        In to Egypte for socour to fle.\r\n      Whan the Innocentes for his sake wer slayne.\r\n        By com̄issyon of Herodes crueltie.+]\r\n\r\nThe manner of wood engraving in _intaglio_ so that the figures appear\r\nwhite on a black ground, so frequently adopted by early Italian wood\r\nengravers, was sometimes practised in Germany; and in one of the\r\nearliest works containing portraits of the Roman emperors,[V-91] copied\r\nfrom ancient medals, printed in the latter country, the cuts are\r\nexecuted in this style. The subject of the work is the lives of the\r\nRoman emperors, written by Joannes Huttichius, and the portraits with\r\nwhich it is illustrated are copied from medals in a collection which had\r\nbeen formed by the Emperor Maximilian, the great promoter of wood\r\nengraving in Germany. The first edition, in Latin, was printed by Wolff\r\nKöpffel, at Strasburg, in 1525; and a second edition, in German, was\r\npublished at the same place in the succeeding year. The cut on the next\r\npage, of the head of Nero, will afford an idea of the style in which the\r\nportraits are executed, and of the fidelity with which the artist has in\r\ngeneral represented the likeness impressed on the original medals.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-91: In a folio work entitled “Epitome Thesauri\r\n    Antiquitatum, hoc est IMPP. Rom. Orientalium et Occidentalium\r\n    Iconum, ex Antiquis Numismatibus quam fidelissime delineatarum. Ex\r\n    Musæo Jacobi de Strada Mantuani Antiquarii,” Lyons, 1553, it is\r\n    stated that the first work containing portraits of the Roman\r\n    emperors engraved from their coins was that entitled “Illustrium\r\n    Imagines,” written by Cardinal Sadolet, and printed at Rome by\r\n    Jacobus Mazochius.--In Strada’s work the portraits are executed in\r\n    the same manner as in that of Huttichius. The wood-cut containing\r\n    the printer’s device, on the title-page of Strada’s work, is\r\n    admirably engraved.]\r\n\r\nBesides Durer, Burgmair, Cranach, and Schaufflein, there are several\r\nother German painters of the same period who are also said to have\r\nengraved on wood, and among the most celebrated of this secondary class\r\nthe following may be mentioned: Hans Sebald Behaim, previously noticed\r\nat page 253; Albert Altdorffer; Hans Springinklee; and Hans Baldung\r\nGrün. The marks of all those artists are to be found on wood-cuts\r\nexecuted in the time of Durer; but I am extremely doubtful if those cuts\r\nwere actually engraved by themselves. If they were, I can only say that,\r\nthough they might be good painters and designers, they were very\r\nindifferent wood engravers; and that their time in executing the\r\nsubjects ascribed to them must have been very badly employed. The common\r\nworking _formschneider_ who could not execute them as well, must have\r\nbeen a very ordinary wood-_cutter_, not to say wood-_engraver_,--by the\r\nlatter term meaning one who excels in his profession, and not a mere\r\ncutter of lines, without skill or taste, on box or pear-tree.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nAlbert Altdorffer was born at Ratisbon in 1480, and afterwards became a\r\nmagistrate of his native city. The engravings on wood and copper\r\ncontaining his mark are mostly of a small size, and he is generally\r\nknown as one of the _little masters_ of the German school of\r\nengraving.[V-92] Hans Springinklee was a painter of some eminence, and\r\naccording to Doppelmayer, as referred to by Bartsch, was a pupil of\r\nDurer’s. His mark is to be found on several wood-cuts; and it occurs in\r\none of the illustrations in the Wise King. Hans Baldung Grün was born at\r\nGemund in Suabia, and studied at Nuremberg under Albert Durer. He\r\nexcelled as a painter; and the wood-cuts which contain his mark are\r\nmostly designed with great spirit. The earliest wood engraving that\r\ncontains his mark is a frontispiece to a volume of sermons with the date\r\n1508; and the latest is a group of horses, engraved in a hard, stiff\r\nmanner, with the name “BALDUNG” and the date 1534.[V-93] He chiefly\r\nresided at Strasburg, where he died in 1545. He is mentioned by Durer,\r\nin his Journal, by the name of “Grün Hannsen.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-92: Heineken ranks the following in the class of\r\n    _little masters_: Henry Aldgrever, Albert Altdorffer, Bartholomew\r\n    Behaim, Hans Sebald Behaim, Hans Binck, Henry Goerting, George\r\n    Penez, and Virgil Solis. Most of them were engravers on copper.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-93: The following curious testimony respecting a lock\r\n    of Albert Durer’s hair, which had formerly been in the possession\r\n    of Hans Baldung Grün, is translated from an article in Meusel’s\r\n    Neue Miscellaneen, 1799. The lock of hair and the document were\r\n    then in the possession of Herr H. S. Hüsgen of Frankfort on the\r\n    Mayn: “Herein is the hair which was cut from the head of that\r\n    ingenious and celebrated painter Albert Durer, after his death at\r\n    Nuremberg, 8th April 1528, as a token of remembrance. It\r\n    afterwards came into the possession of that skilful painter Hans\r\n    Baldung, burger of this city, Strasburg; and after his death, in\r\n    1545, my late brother-in-law, Nicholas Krämer, painter, of this\r\n    city, having bought sundry of his works and other things, among\r\n    them found this lock of hair, in an old letter, wherein was\r\n    written an account of what it contained. On the death of my\r\n    brother-in-law, in 1550, it was presented to me by my sister\r\n    Dorothy, and I now enclose it in this letter for a memorial. 1559.\r\n    SEBOLD BÜHELER.” To this testimony are subjoined two or three\r\n    others of subsequent date, showing in whose possession the valued\r\n    relic had been before it came into the hands of Herr Hüsgen.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe may here conveniently introduce fac-similes on a reduced scale of two\r\nrather interesting wood engravings given by Dr. Dibdin in his\r\nBibliomania, and copied from an early folio volume, entitled\r\n_Revelationes cœlestes sanctæ Brigittæ de Suecia_, printed at Nuremberg\r\nby Anthony Köberger, M CCC XXI. _mensis Septembris_, which some read\r\n1500, on the 21st of September, others 1521, in the month of September.\r\nThe first of these cuts is curious as representing the simplicity of an\r\nancient reading room, with its three-legged joint stool, such as is so\r\nprettily described by Cowper, Task, I. v. 19; the other cut describes a\r\npunishment which is said to have been revealed to St. Bridget against\r\nthose ladies who have “ornamenta indecentia capitibus et pedibus, et\r\nreliquis membris, ad provocandam luxuriam, et irritandum Deum, in\r\nstrictis vestibus, ostensione mamillarum, unctionibus, &c.” The artist\r\nis unknown, but seems to be among the best of the Nuremberg school.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt cannot be reasonably doubted that Durer and several other German\r\npainters of his time were accustomed to engrave their own designs on\r\ncopper; for in many instances we have the express testimony of their\r\ncontemporaries, and not unfrequently their own, to the fact.\r\nCopper-plate engraving for about sixty years from the time of its\r\ninvention was generally practised by persons who were also painters, and\r\nwho usually engraved their own designs. Wood engraving, on the contrary,\r\nfrom an early period was practised as a distinct profession by persons\r\nwho are never heard of as painters. That some of the early German\r\npainters--of a period when “artists were more of workmen, and workmen\r\nmore of artists”[V-94] than in the present day--_might_ engrave some of\r\nthe wood-cuts which bear their marks, is certainly not impossible; but\r\nit is highly improbable that all the wood-cuts which are ascribed to\r\nthem should have been executed by themselves. If any wood-cuts were\r\nactually engraved by Durer, Cranach, Burgmair, and other painters of\r\nreputation, I conceive that such cuts are not to be distinguished by\r\ntheir superior execution from those engraved by the professional\r\n_formschneider_ and _brief-maler_ of the day. The best copper-plates\r\nengraved by Albert Durer can scarcely be surpassed by the best\r\ncopper-plate engraver of the present day,--that is, supposing him to\r\nexecute his work by the same means; while the best of the wood-cuts\r\nwhich he is supposed to have engraved himself might be readily executed\r\nby a score of modern wood engravers if the subject were drawn for them\r\non the block. In the age of Durer the best wood-cuts are of\r\ncomparatively large size, and are distinguished more from the boldness\r\nand freedom of their design than from any peculiar excellence of\r\nengraving: they display, in fact, rather the talent of the _artist_ than\r\nthe skill of the _workman_. Though wood engraving had very greatly\r\nimproved from about the end of the fifteenth century to the time of\r\nDurer’s decease, yet it certainly did not attain its perfection within\r\nthat period. In later years, indeed, the workman has displayed greater\r\nexcellence; but at no time does the art appear to have been more\r\nflourishing or more highly esteemed than in the reign of its great\r\npatron, the Emperor Maximilian.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote V-94: Evidence of Dr. G.

The art of wood engraving,\r\nboth as regards design and execution, appears to have attained its\r\nhighest perfection within about ten years of the time of Durer’s\r\ndecease; for the cuts which, in my opinion, display the greatest\r\nexcellence of the art as practised in former times, were published in\r\n1538. The cuts to which I allude are those of the celebrated Dance of\r\nDeath, which were first published in that year at Lyons. So admirably\r\nare those cuts executed,--with so much feeling and with so perfect a\r\nknowledge of the capabilities of the art,--that I do not think any wood\r\nengraver of the present time is capable of surpassing them. The manner\r\nin which they are engraved is comparatively simple: there is no laboured\r\nand unnecessary cross-hatching where the same effect might be obtained\r\nby simpler means; no display of fine work merely to show the artist’s\r\ntalent in cutting delicate lines. Every line is expressive; and the end\r\nis always obtained by the simplest means. In this the talent and feeling\r\nof the engraver are chiefly displayed. He wastes not his time in mere\r\nmechanical execution--which in the present day is often mistaken for\r\nexcellence;--he endeavours to give to each character its appropriate\r\nexpression; and in this he appears to have succeeded better, considering\r\nthe small size of the cuts, than any other wood engraver, either of\r\ntimes past or present.\r\n\r\nThough two or three of the cuts which will subsequently be given may be\r\nof rather earlier date than those of the Dance of Death, it seems\r\npreferable to give first some account of this celebrated work; and to\r\nintroduce the cuts alluded to, though not in strict chronological\r\norder,--which is the less necessary as they do not illustrate the\r\nprogress of the art,--with others executed in a similar style.\r\n\r\nLong before the publication of the work now so generally known as “The\r\nDance of Death,” a series of paintings representing, in a similar\r\nmanner, Death seizing on persons of all ranks and ages, had appeared on\r\nthe walls of several churches. A Dance of Death was painted in the\r\ncloisters of the Church of the Innocents at Paris, in the cloisters of\r\nSt. Paul’s, London, and in the portico of St. Mary’s, Lubec. The\r\npainting in St Paul’s is said to have been executed at the cost of one\r\nJenkin Carpenter, who lived in the reign of Henry VI, and who was one of\r\nthe executors of that famous “lord-mayor of London,” Richard\r\nWhittington; and Dugdale, in his History of St. Paul’s Cathedral, says\r\nthat it was in imitation of that in the cloisters of the Church of the\r\nInnocents at Paris.[VI-1] This subject seems to have been usually known\r\nin former times by the name of “The Dance of Machabre,” from a French or\r\nGerman poet--for this point is not settled by the learned--of the name\r\nof Macaber or Macabre, who is said to have written a poem on this\r\nsubject.[VI-2] The Dance of Death, however, which as a painting has\r\nattained greater celebrity and given rise to much more discussion than\r\nany other, is that which was painted on the wall of a kind of\r\ncourt-house attached to the Church of the Dominicans at Basle. This\r\npainting has frequently been ascribed to Holbein; but it certainly was\r\nexecuted before he was born; and there is not the slightest reason to\r\nbelieve that he ever touched it in any of the repairs which it underwent\r\nin subsequent years.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-1: Besides those above mentioned, there is said to\r\n    have been a “Death’s Dance” at the following places: in\r\n    Hungerford’s Chapel, Salisbury Cathedral; Hexham Church; at\r\n    Fescamp in Normandy, carved in stone; at Dresden; Leipsic;\r\n    Annaberg; and Berne in Switzerland. The last, painted on the walls\r\n    of the cloisters of the Dominican friars, was the work of Nicholas\r\n    Emanuel Deutsch, previously mentioned at page 314. So early as\r\n    1560 this painting was destroyed in consequence of the cloisters\r\n    being pulled down to widen a street. There are two copies of it in\r\n    water-colours preserved at Berne. From one of them a series of\r\n    lithographic engravings has been made. An ample list of old\r\n    paintings of this subject will be found in Mr. Douce’s Dance of\r\n    Death, chapters iii. and iv, published by Pickering, 1833, and\r\n    republished, with additions, by H. G. Bohn, 1858.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-2: Mr. Douce says, “Macaber was not a German or any\r\n    other poet, but a nonentity.” He supposes that the name _Macaber_\r\n    is only a slight and obvious corruption of _Macarius_, a Saint who\r\n    lived as a hermit in Egypt, and of whom there is a story of his\r\n    showing to three kings or noblemen an emblem of mortality in the\r\n    shape of three skeletons. “The word _Macabre_,” observes Mr.\r\n    Douce, “is found only in French authorities; and the Saint’s name,\r\n    which in the modern orthography is _Macaire_, would in many\r\n    ancient manuscripts be written _Macabre_ instead of _Macaure_, the\r\n    letter _b_ being substituted for that of _u_ from the caprice,\r\n    ignorance, or carelessness of transcribers.” Mr. Douce’s\r\n    conjecture would have been more feasible had he produced a single\r\n    instance from any ancient manuscript of the name having been\r\n    written _Macabre_ instead of _Macaure_ or _Macarius_. By a similar\r\n    process of reasoning, it would not be difficult to prove a hundred\r\n    old writers and poets non-entities. In the earliest French\r\n    editions, the work is intitled “La Danse Macabre;” and in a\r\n    Parisian edition, “Per Magistrum Guidonem Mercatorem pro Godefrido\r\n    de Marnef,” folio, 1490, the title is as follows: “Chorea ab\r\n    eximio Macabro versibus Alemanicis edita, et à Petro Desrey\r\n    emendata.” This seems to prove that Peter Desrey knew something of\r\n    a person named Macaber who had written a description of the Dance\r\n    in German.]\r\n\r\nThe following particulars respecting this painting are such as seem best\r\nauthenticated.\r\n\r\nIt is said to owe its origin to a plague which ravaged the city of Basle\r\nin 1439, during the time of the great council, which commenced in 1431,\r\nand did not terminate till 1448. A number of persons of almost all\r\nranks, whom the council had brought to this city, having fallen victims\r\nto the plague, it is said that the painting was executed in remembrance\r\nof the event, and as a memento of the uncertainty of life. Though it may\r\nbe true that the great mortality at Basle in 1439 might have been the\r\noccasion of such a picture in the church-court--_Kirchhofe_, as it is\r\ncalled by Hegner in his Life of Holbein--of the Dominicans in that city,\r\nit is almost certain that the subject must have been suggested by one of\r\nmuch earlier date painted on the walls of an old building which had\r\nformerly been the cloisters of a nunnery which stood in that part of\r\nBasle which is called the Little City. This convent was founded in 1275;\r\nand the painting appears to have been executed in 1312, according to the\r\nfollowing date, which was to be seen above one of the figures, that of\r\nthe Count, who was also one of the characters in the painting in the\r\nchurch-court of the Dominicans: “+Dussent jar treihuntert und Xii+;” in\r\nEnglish: One thousand three hundred and twelve. Several of the figures\r\nin this old painting were almost the same as in that of the church-court\r\nof the Dominicans, though executed in a coarser manner; and, like the\r\nlatter, were accompanied with explanatory inscriptions in verse. This\r\ncurious old work appears to have remained unnoticed till 1766, when one\r\nEmanuel Büchel, of Basle, by trade a baker, but an admirer of art, and\r\nan industrious draughtsman, had his attention directed to it. He made a\r\ncareful copy in colours of all that then remained of it, and his\r\ndrawings are now in the public library of Basle. “This oldest Dance of\r\nDeath,” says Hegner, writing in 1827, “is almost entirely effaced, and\r\nbecomes daily more so, as well on account of age as from the cloisters\r\nof the old nunnery having been for many years used as a warehouse for\r\nsalt.”[VI-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-3: Hans Holbein der Jüngere. Von Ulrich Hegner,\r\n    S. 309. Berlin, 1827.]\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that the Dance of Death in the church-court of the\r\nDominicans at Basle was originally painted in _fresco_ or distemper. The\r\nnumber of characters, each accompanied by a figure of Death, was\r\noriginally forty;[VI-4] but in 1568, a painter, named Hans Hugo Klauber,\r\nwho was employed by the magistrates to repair the old painting,\r\nintroduced a figure of the reformer Oecolampadius as if preaching to the\r\ncharacters composing the Dance, with portraits of himself, his wife, and\r\ntheir little son, at the end. It is probable that he painted over the\r\nold figures in oil-colour, and introduced sundry alterations, suggested\r\nby other paintings and engravings of the same subject. It appears likely\r\nthat, at the same time, many of the old inscriptions were changed for\r\nothers more in accordance with the doctrines of the Reformation, which\r\nthen prevailed at Basle. The verses above the figure of the Pope were\r\ncertainly not such as would have been tolerated at the period when the\r\nsubject is supposed to have been first painted.[VI-5] In 1616 the\r\npainting was again repaired; but, though a Latin inscription was then\r\nadded containing the names of the magistrates who had thus taken care to\r\npreserve it, there is no mention made of any artist by whom the subject\r\nhad been originally painted or subsequently retouched. Had there been\r\nany record of Holbein having been at any time employed on the work, such\r\na circumstance would most likely have been noticed; as his memory was\r\nthen held in the highest estimation, and Basle prided herself on having\r\nhad so eminent an artist enrolled among the number of her citizens. In\r\n1658 the painting was again renewed: and there seems reason to believe\r\nthat further alterations were then introduced both in the costume and\r\nthe colouring. It was retouched in 1703; but from that time, as the\r\npaint began to peel off from the decaying walls, all attempts for its\r\nfurther preservation appear to have been considered hopeless. It would\r\nindeed seem to have become in a great measure disregarded by the\r\nmagistrates, for a rope-maker used to exercise his trade under the roof\r\nthat protected it from the weather. As the old wall stood much in the\r\nway of new buildings, it is not unlikely that they might be rather\r\nwishful to have it removed. In 1805 the magistrates pronounced sentence\r\nagainst the Dance of Death, and the wall on which it was painted was by\r\ntheir orders pulled down, though not without considerable opposition on\r\nthe part of many of the citizens, more especially those of the suburb of\r\nSt. John, within which the old church-court of the Dominicans stood.\r\nSeveral pieces of the painting were collected, and are still preserved\r\nat Basle as memorials of the old “Todten-tanz,” which was formerly an\r\nobject of curiosity with all strangers who visited the city, and which\r\nhas been so frequently the subject of discussion in the history of art.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-4: All the persons introduced were of the size of\r\n    life. Death, in only one instance, was represented as a perfect\r\n    skeleton, and that was in the subject of the Doctor, whom he was\r\n    supposed to address as follows:\r\n\r\n      +“Herr Doctor b’schaw die Anatomey\r\n      An mir, ob sie recht g’macht sey.”+\r\n\r\n    that is:\r\n\r\n      “Doctor, take of me a sight,\r\n      Say if the skeleton be right.”\r\n\r\n    It has been said that the Pope, the Emperor, and the King, were\r\n    intended respectively for portraits of Pope Felix V, the Emperor\r\n    Sigismund, and Albert II, his successor, as King of the Romans.\r\n    This, however, is merely a conjecture, and not a very probable\r\n    one. Sigismund died before the commencement of the plague which\r\n    is said to have been the occasion of the painting.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-5: Those verses, as they appeared in later times, are\r\n    as follows:\r\n\r\n      +“Heilig war ich auff Erd genant\r\n      Ohn Gott der höchst führt ich mein stand.\r\n      Der Ablass that mir gar wol lohnen\r\n      Doch will der tod mein nicht verschonen.”+\r\n\r\n    Their meaning may be thus expressed in English:\r\n\r\n      “His Holiness, on earth my name;\r\n      From God my power never came;\r\n      Although by pardons wealth I got,\r\n      Death, alas, will pardon not!”]\r\n\r\nMr. Douce has given a list of many books containing the figures of a\r\nDance of Death printed before the celebrated Simulachres et Historiées\r\nFaces de la Mort of Lyons, 1538; and among the principal the following\r\nmay be here enumerated.--A German edition, intitled “Der Dodtendanz mit\r\nfiguren. Clage und Antwort schon von allen staten der Welt.” This work,\r\nwhich is small folio, is mentioned in Braun’s Notitia librorum in\r\nBibliotheca ad SS. Udalricum et Afram Augustæ, vol. ii. p. 62. It is\r\nwithout date, but Braun supposes that it may have been printed between\r\n1480 and 1500. It consists of twenty-two leaves, with wood-cuts of the\r\nPope, Cardinal, Bishop, Abbot, &c. &c. accompanied by figures of Death.\r\nThe descriptions are in German verse, and printed in double\r\ncolumns.--The earliest printed book on this subject with a date is\r\nintitled “La Danse Macabre imprimée par ung nommé Guy Marchand,”\r\n&c. Paris, 1485, small folio. In 1486 Guy Marchand,--or Guyot Marchant,\r\nas he is also called,--printed another edition, “La Danse Macabre\r\nnouvelle,” with several additional cuts; and in the same year he printed\r\n“La Danse Macabre des Femmes,” a small folio of fifteen leaves. This is\r\nthe first edition of the Macaber Dance of females. Thirty-two subjects\r\nare described, but there are only cuts of two, the Queen and the\r\nDuchess. In 1490 an edition appeared with the following title: “Chorea\r\nab eximio Macabro versibus Alemanicis edita, et à Petro Desrey emendata.\r\nParisiis, per magistrum Guidonem Mercatorem [Guy Marchand] pro Godefrido\r\nde Marnef.” In the same year Marchand printed another edition of “La\r\nnouvelle Danse Macabre des Hommes;” and in the year following there\r\nappeared from his press a second edition of “La Danse Macabre des\r\nFemmes,” with cuts of all the characters and other additions. A Dance of\r\nDeath, according to Von der Hagen, in his Deutsche Poesie, p. 459, was\r\nprinted at Leipsic in 1496; and in 1499 a “Grande Danse Macabre des\r\nHommes et Femmes” was printed in folio at Lyons. The latter is supposed\r\nto be the earliest that contains cuts of both men and women. About 1500,\r\nAnt. Verard printed an edition, in folio, of the Danse Macabre at Paris;\r\nand in various years between 1500 and 1530 a work with the same title\r\nand similar cuts was printed at Paris, Troyes, Rouen, Lyons, and Geneva.\r\nBesides those works, characters from the Dance of Death were frequently\r\nintroduced as incidental illustrations in books of devotion, more\r\nespecially in those usually denominated Horæ or Hours of the Virgin, and\r\nprinted in France.[VI-6]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-6: Several characters are to be found in those Dances\r\n    of Death which do not occur in the Simulachres et Historiées Faces\r\n    de la Mort of Lyons, 1538. In the preface to the Emblems of\r\n    Mortality,--with wood-cuts by John Bewick, 1789,--written by John\r\n    Sidney Hawkins, Esq., the following list is given of the cuts in\r\n    an edition of “La grande Danse de Macabre des Hommes et Femmes,”\r\n    4to. printed at Troyes for John Garnier, but without a date. “The\r\n    Pope, Emperor, Cardinal, King, Legate, Duke, Patriarch, Constable,\r\n    Archbishop, Knight, Bishop, Squire, Abbot, Bailiff, Astrologer,\r\n    Burgess, Canon, Merchant, Schoolmaster, Man of Arms, Chartreux,\r\n    Serjeant, Monk, Usurer, Physician, Lover, Advocate, Minstrel,\r\n    Curate, Labourer, Proctor, Gaoler, Pilgrim, Shepherd, Cordelier,\r\n    Child, Clerk, Hermit, Adventurer, Fool. The women are the Queen,\r\n    Duchess, Regent’s Wife, Knight’s Wife, Abbess, Squire’s Wife,\r\n    Shepherdess, Cripple, Burgess’s Wife, Widow, Merchant’s Wife,\r\n    Bailiff’s Wife, Young Wife, Dainty Dame, Female Philosopher,\r\n    New-married Wife, Woman with Child, Old Maid, Female Cordelier,\r\n    Chambermaid, Intelligence-Woman, Hostess, Nurse, Prioress, Damsel,\r\n    Country Girl, Old Chambermaid, Huckstress, Strumpet, Nurse for\r\n    Lying-in-Woman, Young Girl, Religious, Sorceress, Bigot, Fool.”\r\n    Nearly the same characters occur in borders of the old Dutch\r\n    Prayer Book mentioned at page 318, though in the latter they are\r\n    yet more numerous; among the men there is a\r\n    fowler--_vogelaer_--and among the women, the beauty--_scone_--and\r\n    the old woman--_alde vrou_--which do not occur in the preceding\r\n    list.]\r\n\r\nThe celebrated “Dance of Death,” the cuts of which have been so\r\ngenerally ascribed to Hans Holbein as the engraver as well as designer,\r\nwas first published at Lyons, in 1538. It is of small quarto size, and\r\nthe title is as follows: “Les Simulachres & Historiées faces de la Mort,\r\nautant elegammēt pourtraictes, que artificiellement imaginées. A Lyon,\r\nSoubz l’escu de Coloigne. M.D.XXXVIII.” On the title-page is an\r\nemblematic wood-cut, very indifferently executed, representing three\r\nheads joined together, with a wreath above them; the middle one a full\r\nface, and those on each side in profile. Instead of shoulders, the\r\nheads, or busts, are provided with a pair of wings of peacock’s\r\nfeathers; they rest on a kind of pedestal, on which is also an open book\r\ninscribed with the maxim, “ΓΝΩΘΙ ΣΕΑΥΤΟΝ.” A large serpent is seen\r\nconfined by the middle in a hole which must be supposed to pass through\r\nthe pedestal; and to it (the pedestal) are chained two globes,--one\r\nsurmounted by a small cross, like the emblem of imperial authority,\r\nand the other having two wings. This emblematic cut, which is certainly\r\nnot “l’escu de Coloigne,” is accompanied with the motto “_Usus me\r\nGenuit_.”[VI-7] At the conclusion of the book is the imprint, within\r\nan ornamental wood-cut border: “EXCVDEBANT LVGDVNI MELCHIOR ET GASPAR\r\nTRECHSEL FRATRES. 1538.” The title is succeeded by a preface, of six\r\npages, which is followed by seven pages more, descriptive of “diverses\r\ntables de Mort, non painctes, mais extraictes de l’escripture saincte,\r\ncolorées par Docteurs Ecclesiastiques, et umbragées par Philosophes.”\r\nAfter those verbal sketches of Death come the cuts, one on each page;\r\nand they are succeeded by a series of descriptions of death and\r\nreflections on mortality, the general title to which, commencing at\r\nsignature H, is, “Figures de la Mort moralement descriptes, & depeinctes\r\nselon l’authorité de l’scripture, & des sainctz Peres.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-7: It has been thought necessary to be thus\r\n    particular in describing the title-page of this rare edition, as\r\n    it is incorrectly described by Mr. Douce. In the copy in the\r\n    British Museum the title-page is wanting.]\r\n\r\nBy far the most important passage in the book, at least so far as\r\nrelates to the designer or engraver of the cuts, occurs in the preface,\r\nwhich is written much in the style of a pedantic father-confessor to a\r\nnunnery who felt a pleasure in ornamenting his Christian discourses and\r\nexhortations with the flowers of Pagan eloquence. The preface is\r\naddressed, “A moult reverende Abbesse du religieux convent S. Pierre de\r\nLyon, Madame Jehanne de Touszele, Salut dun vray Zele,”[VI-8] and the\r\npassage above mentioned is to the following effect. “But to return to\r\nour figured representations of Death, we have greatly to regret the\r\ndeath of him who has imagined such elegant figures as are herein\r\ncontained, as much excelling all those heretofore printed,[VI-9] as the\r\npictures of Apelles or of Zeuxis surpass those of modern times; for, his\r\nfunereal histories, with their gravely versified descriptions, excite\r\nsuch admiration in beholders, that the figures of Death appear to them\r\nmost life-like, while those of the living are the very pictures of\r\nmortality. It therefore seems to me that Death, fearing that this\r\nexcellent painter would paint him in a manner so lively, that he should\r\nbe no longer feared as Death, and apprehensive that the artist would\r\nthus become immortal, determined to shorten his days, and thus prevent\r\nhim finishing other subjects which he had already drawn. Among these is\r\none of a waggoner, knocked down and crushed under his broken waggon, the\r\nwheels and horses of which appear so frightfully shattered and maimed\r\nthat it is as fearful to see their overthrow as it is amusing to behold\r\nthe liquorishness of a figure of Death, who is perceived roguishly\r\nsucking the wine out of a broken cask, by means of a reed. To such\r\nimperfect subjects, as to the inimitable heavenly bow named Iris,[VI-10]\r\nno one has ventured to put the last hand, on account of the bold\r\ndrawing, perspectives, and shadows contained in this inimitable\r\nchef-d’œuvre, there so gracefully delineated, that from it we may derive\r\na pleasing sadness and a melancholy pleasure, as in a thing mournfully\r\ndelightful.” The cut of the waggoner, described by the French euphuist,\r\nwas, however, afterwards finished, and, with others, inserted in a\r\nsubsequent edition of the work. It is figured in the present volume at\r\npage 344.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-8: This “vray Zele” having said in the first page of\r\n    the preface that the name and surname of the revered abbess had\r\n    the same sound as his own, with the exception of the letter T, the\r\n    editor of the Emblems conjectures “that his name was JEAN, or, as\r\n    it was anciently written, JEHAN DE OUSZELL, or OZELL as it is now\r\n    usually spelt.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-9: In the original, “avancantes autāt les patronées\r\n    jusques ici.” The word _patronées_, I conceive to refer to cuts\r\n    printed from wood-blocks. The editor of the Emblems, 1688, who is\r\n    followed by Mr. Ottley, translated the passage, “exceeding all the\r\n    _examples_ hitherto.” Works executed by means of a stencil were in\r\n    old French said to be _patronées_, and the word also appears to\r\n    have been applied to impressions printed from wood-blocks. The\r\n    verb _patroner_ is thus explained in Noel and Chapsal’s Nouveau\r\n    Dictionnaire de la Langue Française, Paris, 1828: “Terme de\r\n    cartier: enduire de couleur, au moyen du patron évidé, les\r\n    endroits où cette couleur doit paraître.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-10: Mr. Douce supposes that the rainbow here alluded\r\n    to was that which appears in the cut of the Last Judgment, the\r\n    last but one in the first edition. The writer evidently means the\r\n    natural rainbow which is mostly seen imperfect.]\r\n\r\nThe number of cuts in the first edition, now under examination, is\r\nforty-one; above each is a text of Scripture, in Latin; and below are\r\nfour verses in French--the “descriptions severement rithmées,” mentioned\r\nin the preface--containing some moral or reflection germane to the\r\nsubject. A few sets of impressions of all those cuts, except one, appear\r\nto have been taken before the work appeared at Lyons. They have been\r\nprinted by means of a press,--not taken by friction in the manner in\r\nwhich wood engravers usually take their proofs,--and at the top of each\r\ncut is the name in the German language, but in Italic type. “Why those\r\nGerman names,” says Hegner, “in a work which, so far as we know, was\r\nfirst published at Lyons? They appear to confirm the opinion of the cuts\r\nhaving been actually engraved at Basle; and the descriptions correspond\r\nwith the dialect of that city.” The late Mr. Ottley had impressions of\r\nforty of those original cuts, and six of those which were inserted in a\r\nlater edition. In his Inquiry into the Origin and Early History of\r\nEngraving, Mr. Ottley, speaking of the Dance of Death, says: “It is\r\ncertain that the cuts had been previously printed at Basle; and, indeed,\r\nsome writers assert that the work was published in that city, with texts\r\nof Scripture, in the German language, above the cuts, and verses, in the\r\nsame language, underneath, as early as 1530; although, hitherto, I have\r\nbeen unable to meet with or hear of any person who had seen a copy of\r\nsuch an edition.” In a note upon this passage, Jansen, the compiler of\r\nan Essay on the Origin of Engraving, and the anonymous author of a work\r\nentitled Notices sur les Graveurs, Besançon, 1807, are cited as\r\nmentioning such an edition. To give every one his due, however, and to\r\nshow the original authority for the existence of such an edition, I beg\r\nhere to give an extract from Papillon, who never felt any difficulty in\r\nsupposing a date, and whose conjectures such writers as Jansen have felt\r\nas little hesitation in converting into certainties. The substance of\r\nPapillon’s observations on this point is as follows: “But to return to\r\nHolbein’s Dance of Death, which is unquestionably a master-piece of wood\r\nengraving. There are several editions; the first of which, _so far as\r\nmay be judged_, ought to be about 1530, as has been already said,[VI-11]\r\nand was printed at Basle or Zurich, with a title to each cut, and,\r\n_I believe_, verses underneath, all in the German language.” What\r\nPapillon puts forth as a matter of conjecture and opinion, Von Murr,\r\nJansen, and the author of the Notices sur les Graveurs, promulgate as\r\nfacts, and Mr. Ottley refers to the two latter writers as if he were\r\nwell inclined to give credit to their assertions.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-11: Traité de la Gravure en Bois, tom. i. p. 168.\r\n    Papillon in a preceding page had observed: “These cuts must have\r\n    been engraved about 1530, for we find the four first among the\r\n    little figures of the Old Testament printed in 1539, from which it\r\n    is easy to perceive that many thousand impressions had already\r\n    been taken from the blocks.”--Those four cuts in the first edition\r\n    of the Dance of Death, have not the slightest appearance of having\r\n    been from blocks that had already furnished many thousand\r\n    impressions. In the copy now before me, I cannot perceive a break\r\n    or an imperfection in the most delicate lines. The first edition\r\n    of the “Historiarum Veteris Testamenti Icones,” to which Papillon\r\n    alludes, first appeared in the same year as the Simulachres, 1538,\r\n    and from the office of the same publishers, the brothers Melchior\r\n    and Gaspar Trechsel.]\r\n\r\nFrom the following passage it would appear that Mr. Ottley had also been\r\nwilling to believe that those impressions might have been accompanied\r\nwith explanatory verses and texts of Scripture. “I have only to add,\r\nupon the subject of this celebrated work, that I am myself the fortunate\r\npossessor of forty pieces, (the complete series of the first edition,\r\nexcepting one,) which are printed with the greatest clearness and\r\nbrilliancy of effect, on one side of the paper only; each cut having\r\nover it its title, printed in the German language with moveable type. It\r\nis possible that they may originally have had verses underneath, and\r\ntexts of Scripture above, in addition to the titles just mentioned: but\r\nas the margins are clipped on the sides and at bottom, it is now\r\nimpossible to ascertain the fact.”[VI-12]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-12: Inquiry into the Origin and Early History of\r\n    Engraving, vol. ii. p. 762.]\r\n\r\nHad the forty impressions in question been accompanied with verses and\r\ntexts of Scripture, they certainly might be considered as having\r\nbelonged to an earlier edition of the work than that of 1538, and for\r\nthe existence of which Mr. Ottley has referred to the testimony of\r\nJansen and the editor of the Notices sur les Graveurs, printed at\r\nBesançon. There is, however, a set of those cuts preserved in the public\r\nlibrary at Basle, which seems clearly to prove that they had only been\r\ntaken as specimens without any further accompaniment than the titles.\r\nThey are printed on four folio leaves, on only one side of the paper,\r\nand there are ten cuts on each page; the title, in the German language,\r\nand in Italic type, like Mr. Ottley’s, is printed above each; and the\r\nsame cut--that of the astrologer--is also wanting. From these\r\ncircumstances there can scarcely be a doubt that the set formerly\r\nbelonging to Mr. Ottley[VI-13] had been printed in the same manner, and\r\nthat each impression had subsequently been cut out, perhaps for the\r\npurpose of mounting them singly. The following are the titles given to\r\nthose cuts, and to each is subjoined a literal translation. They are\r\nnumbered as they follow each other in LES SIMULACHRES ET HISTORIEES\r\nFACES DE LA MORT, 1538, which perhaps may not be incorrectly expressed\r\nby the English title, “Pictorial and Historical Portraits of Death.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-13: Those cuts, with that of the astrologer and five\r\n    others, supplied from a later edition, were bought, at the sale of\r\n    Mr. Ottley’s prints, in 1837, for the British Museum, for £37\r\n    10_s._ In the catalogue, which, I understand, was chiefly drawn up\r\n    from his own memoranda, they are thus described, under the head\r\n    “HANS HOLBEIN,” No. 458: “THE CELEBRATED DANCE OF DEATH, first\r\n    impressions, printed (probably at Basle, about 1530,) upon one\r\n    side only, with German titles at the top in type; supposed to be\r\n    UNIQUE.” That they were printed in 1530 is highly _improbable_,\r\n    and they certainly are NOT _unique_.]\r\n\r\n  1. _Die schöpfung aller ding_--The creation of all things.\r\n  2. _Adam Eua im Paradyſs_--Adam and Eve in Paradise.\r\n  3. _Vertribung Ade Eue_--The driving out of Adam and Eve.\r\n  4. _Adam baugt die erden_--Adam cultivates the earth.\r\n  5. _Gebeyn aller menschen_--Skeletons of all men.\r\n  6. _Der Papst_--The Pope.\r\n  7. _Der Keyser_--The Emperor.\r\n  8. _Der Künig_--The King.\r\n  9. _Der Cardinal_--The Cardinal.\r\n  10. _Die Keyserinn._--The Empress.\r\n  11. _Die Küniginn_--The Queen.\r\n  12. _Der Bischoff_--The Bishop.\r\n  13. _Der Hertzog_--The Duke.\r\n  14. _Der Apt_--The Abbot.\r\n  15. _Die Aptissinn_--The Abbess.\r\n  16. _Der Edelman_--The Nobleman.\r\n  17. _Der Thümherr_--The Canon.\r\n  18. _Der Richter_--The Judge.\r\n  19. _Der Fürspräch_--The Advocate.\r\n  20. _Der Rahtsherr_--The Magistrate.\r\n  21. _Der Predicant_--The Preaching Friar.\r\n  22. _Der Pfarrherr_--The Parish-priest.\r\n  23. _Der Münch_--The Monk.\r\n  24. _Die Nunne_--The Nun.\r\n  25. _Dass Altweyb_--The Old Woman.\r\n  26. _Der Artzet_--The Doctor.\r\n  27. (Wanting in the specimens.) The Astrologer.\r\n  28. _Der Rychman_--The Rich Man.\r\n  29. _Der Kauffman_--The Merchant.\r\n  30. _Der Schiffman_--The Sailor.\r\n  31. _Der Ritter_--The Knight.\r\n  32. _Der Graff_--The Count.\r\n  33. _Der Alt man_--The Old Man.\r\n  34. _Die Greffinn_--The Countess.\r\n  35. _Die Edelfraw_--The Lady.\r\n  36. _Die Hertzoginn_--The Duchess.\r\n  37. _Der Krämer_--The Pedlar.\r\n  38. _Der Ackerman_--The Farmer.\r\n  39. _Das Jung Kint_--The Young Child.\r\n  40. _Das Jüngst Gericht_--The Last Judgment.\r\n  41. _Die Wapen des Thots_--Death’s coat-of-arms.\r\n\r\nIn 1542 a second edition of the Dance of Death, with the same cuts as\r\nthe first, was published at Lyons, “Soubz l’escu de Coloigne,” by John\r\nand Francis Frellon, who appear to have succeeded to the business of the\r\nbrothers Trechsel,--if, indeed, the latter were not merely the printers\r\nof the first edition. In a third edition, with the title Imagines\r\nMortis, 1545, the verses underneath each cut are in Latin.[VI-14] A cut\r\nof a lame beggar, which has no relation to the Dance of Death, is\r\nintroduced as a tail-piece to one of the discourses on death--Cypriani\r\nSermo de Mortalitate--at the end of the volume; but it is neither\r\ndesigned nor executed in the same style as the others.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-14: The French verses were translated into Latin by\r\n    George Æmylius, “an eminent German divine of Mansfelt,” says Mr.\r\n    Douce, “and the author of many pious works.”]\r\n\r\nIn a fourth edition, with the title “Imagines Mortis,”[VI-15] 1547,\r\neleven additional cuts are introduced; namely: 1. Death fighting with a\r\nsoldier in Swiss costume; 2. Gamblers, with a figure of Death, and\r\nanother of the Devil; 3. Drunkards, with a figure of Death; 4. The Fool,\r\nwith a figure of Death playing on the bagpipes; 5. The Robber seized by\r\nDeath; 6. The Blind Man and Death; 7. The Waggoner and Death;\r\n8. Children, one of whom is borne on the shoulders of the others as a\r\nconqueror triumphing; 9. A child with a shield and dart; 10. Three\r\nchildren; one riding on an arrow, another on a bow, as on a hobby-horse,\r\nthe third carrying a hare over his shoulder, suspended from a hunting\r\npole; 11. Children as Bacchanalians. The last four subjects have no\r\nrelation to a Dance of Death, but have evidently been introduced merely\r\nto increase the number of the cuts; they are, however, beautifully\r\ndesigned and well engraved. This edition contains twelve more cuts,\r\nreckoning the tail-piece of the Lame Beggar, than the first. Another\r\nedition, forming the fifth, was also published in 1547 under the title\r\nof “Les Images de la Mort,” with French verses, as in the edition of\r\n1538. The number of cuts is the same as in the edition of 1547 with\r\nLatin verses, and the title “Imagines Mortis,” or “Icones Mortis.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-15: Some copies have the title “Icones Mortis;” and\r\n    though they correspond in every other respect with those of the\r\n    same year, intitled Imagines Mortis, Mr. Douce seems to consider\r\n    that this trifling variation is a sufficient ground for describing\r\n    them as different editions.]\r\n\r\nIn 1549, a sixth edition, with the same number of cuts as the last, was\r\npublished, under the title of “Simolachri, Historie, e Figure de la\r\nMorte,” with the letter-press in Italian, with the exception of the\r\ntexts of Scripture, which were in Latin, as in the others. In the\r\npreface, John Frellon--whose name appears alone in the edition of 1547,\r\nand in those of subsequent years--complains of a piracy of the book,\r\nwhich was printed at Venice in 1545, with fac-similes of the cuts of the\r\nfirst edition. “Frellon, by way of revenge,” says Mr. Douce, “and to\r\nsave the trouble of making a new translation of the articles that\r\ncompose the volume, made use of that of his Italian competitor.”[VI-16]\r\nA seventh edition, with the title “Icones Mortis,” and containing\r\nfifty-three cuts, appeared, without any printer’s name, in 1554.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-16: Dance of Death, p. 107, edit. 1833 (Bohn’s\r\n    edition, p. 95). It is stated in the Italian piracy that it was\r\n    printed “_Con gratia e privilegio de l’Illustriss. Senato\r\n    Vinitiano, per anni dieci. Appresso Vincenzo Vaugris, al Segno\r\n    d’Erasmo._ MDXLV.”]\r\n\r\nIn an eighth edition, 1562, with the title “Les Images de la Mort,\r\nauxquelles sont adjoustees dix-sept figures,” five additional cuts are\r\nintroduced, thus making seventeen more than are contained in the first.\r\nThe total number of cuts in the edition of 1562 is fifty-eight; and that\r\nof the Lame Beggar, which first appeared as a tail-piece in the edition\r\nof 1545, has now a place among the others in the body of the book. The\r\nsubjects of the five new cuts are: 1. The Husband, with a figure of\r\nDeath; 2. The Wife,--Death leading a young woman by the hand, preceded\r\nby a young man playing on a kind of guitar; 3. Children as part of a\r\ntriumph, one of them as a warrior on horseback; 4. Three children; one\r\nwith a trophy of armour, another carrying a vase and a shield, the third\r\nseated naked on the ground; 5. Children with musical instruments. The\r\nsubjects of children are designed and executed in the same style as\r\nthose first introduced in the edition of 1547. The last of those five\r\nnew cuts does not appear in regular order with the other fifty-seven;\r\nbut is given as a tail-piece at the end of a preface to a devotional\r\ntract--La Medicine de l’Ame--in the latter part of the book. Mr. Douce\r\nmentions another edition with the date 1574. He, however, observes in a\r\nnote: “This edition is given on the authority of Peignot,[VI-17] page\r\n62, but has not been seen by the author of this work. In the year 1547\r\nthere were three editions, and it is not improbable that, by the\r\ntransposition of the two last figures, one of these might have been\r\nintended.” As one of Mr. Douce’s _three_ editions of 1547 differs only\r\nfrom another of the same date by having “_Icones_” instead of\r\n“_Imagines_” in the title-page, he might as consistently have claimed a\r\nfourth for the same year on the ground of a _probable_ transposition of\r\n74 for 47. All the authentic editions of the “Dance of Death,”\r\npreviously noticed, were published at Lyons. The first, as has been\r\nalready observed, was in small quarto; the others are described by Mr.\r\nDouce as being in duodecimo. In a Dutch Dance of Death, intitled “De\r\nDoodt vermaskert met swerelts ydelheit,” duodecimo, Antwerp, 1654,\r\nfourteen of the cuts, according to Mr. Douce, were from the original\r\nblocks which had been used in the Lyons editions.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-17: Author of the work intitled, “Recherches sur les\r\n    Danses des Morts.” Dijon et Paris, 1826.]\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that the earliest copies of the cuts in “Les\r\nSimulachres et Historiées Faces de la Mort,” or Dance of Death, as the\r\nwork is more frequently called, appeared in a small folio, intitled\r\n“Todtentantz,” printed at Augsburg in 1544, by “_Jobst Denecker,\r\nFormschneyder_.” As I have never seen a copy of this edition, I take the\r\nliberty of extracting the following notice of it from Mr. Douce: “This\r\nedition is not only valuable from its extreme rarity, but for the very\r\naccurate and spirited manner in which the fine original cuts are copied.\r\nIt contains all the subjects that were then published, but not arranged\r\nas those had been. It has the addition of one singular print, intitled,\r\n‘Der Eebrecher,’ _i. e._ the Adulterer, representing a man discovering\r\nthe adulterer in bed with his wife, and plunging his sword through both\r\nof them, Death guiding his hands. On the opposite page to each engraving\r\nthere is a dialogue between Death and the party, and at bottom a Latin\r\nhexameter. The subject of the Pleader has the unknown mark [Symbol] and\r\non that of the Duchess in bed, there is the date 1542.”[VI-18] Mr. Douce\r\nis of opinion that the “_Jobst Denecker, Formschneyder_,” who appears as\r\nthe printer, was the same person as Jobst or Jost de Negker, the wood\r\nengraver whose name is at the back of one of the cuts of the Triumphal\r\nProcession of Maximilian.--The next copy of the work is that intitled\r\n“Simolachri, Historie, e Figure de la Morte,” Venice, 1545, the piracy\r\ncomplained of by Frellon in his Italian edition of 1549. It contains\r\nforty-one cuts, as in the first Lyons edition of 1538. There is no\r\nvariation in the figures; but the expression of the faces is frequently\r\nlost, and the general execution of the whole is greatly inferior to that\r\nof the originals. Another edition, in Latin, was published in 1546; and\r\nMr. Douce says that there are impressions of the cuts on single sheets,\r\nat the bottom of one of which is the date 1568.--In 1555, an edition\r\nwith the title “Imagines Mortis,” with fifty-three cuts, similar to\r\nthose in the Lyons edition of 1547, was published at Cologne by the\r\nheirs of Arnold Birkman, Cologne, 1555; and there are four other\r\neditions of the same work, respectively dated 1557, 1566, 1567, and\r\n1572. Alterations are made in some of those cuts; in five of them the\r\nmark [[SA]] is introduced; and in the cut of the Duchess the mark\r\n[Symbol], seen on the bed-frame in the original, is omitted. All the\r\nalterations are for the worse; some of the figures seem like caricatures\r\nof the originals; and the cuts generally are, in point of execution,\r\nvery inferior to those in the Lyons editions. The name of the artist\r\nto whom the mark [[SA]] belongs is unknown. In the preface to the\r\nEmblems of Mortality, page xx, the writer says it is “that of SILVIUS\r\nANTONIANUS, an artist of considerable merit.” This, however, is merely\r\none of the blunders of Papillon, who, according to Mr. Douce, has\r\nconverted the owner of this mark into a cardinal. Papillon, it\r\nwould seem, had observed it on the cuts of an edition of Faerno’s\r\nFables--printed at Antwerp, 1567, and dedicated to Cardinal Borromeo\r\nby Silvio Antoniano, professor of Belles Lettres at Rome, afterwards\r\na cardinal himself--and without hesitation he concluded that the editor\r\nwas the engraver.[VI-19] The last of the editions published in the\r\nsixteenth century with wood-cuts copied from the Lyons work, appeared\r\nat Wittemberg in 1590.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-18: Dance of Death, p. 118. Edit. 1833.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-19: Mr. Douce gives another amusing instance of\r\n    Papillon’s sagacity in assigning marks and names to their proper\r\n    owners. “He (Papillon) had seen an edition of the Emblems of\r\n    Sambucus with cuts, bearing the mark [[SA]], in which there is a\r\n    fine portrait of the author with his favourite dog, and under the\r\n    latter the word BOMBO, which Papillon gravely states to be the\r\n    name of the engraver; and finding the same word on another of the\r\n    emblems, which has also the dog, he concludes that all the cuts\r\n    which have not the [[SA]] were engraved by the same BOMBO.”--Dance\r\n    of Death, p. 114, 1833. Those blunders of Papillon are to be found\r\n    in his Traité Historique et Pratique de la Gravure en Bois, tom.\r\n    i. pp. 238 et 525.]\r\n\r\nVarious editions of the Dance of Death, with copper-plate engravings\r\ngenerally copied from the work published at Lyons, are enumerated by Mr.\r\nDouce, but only one of them seems to require notice here. Between 1647\r\nand 1651 Hollar etched thirty subjects from the Dance of Death,\r\nintroducing occasionally a few alterations. From a careful examination\r\nof those etchings, I am inclined to think that most of them were copied\r\nnot from the cuts in any of the Lyons editions, but from those in the\r\nedition published by the heirs of Birkman at Cologne. The original\r\ncopper-plates of Hollar’s thirty etchings having come into the\r\npossession of Mr. James Edwards, formerly a bookseller in Pall-Mall, he\r\npublished an edition in duodecimo, without date, but about 1794,[VI-20]\r\nwith preliminary observations on the Dance of Death, written by the late\r\nMr. F. Douce. Those preliminary observations are the germ of Mr. Douce’s\r\nbeautiful and more complete volume, published by W. Pickering in 1833\r\n(and republished with additions by Mr. Bohn in 1858). As Petrarch’s\r\namatory sonnets and poems have been called “a labour of Love,” with\r\nequal propriety may Mr. Douce’s last work be intitled “a labour of\r\nDeath.” Scarcely a cut or an engraving that contains even a death’s head\r\nand cross-bones appears to have escaped his notice. Incorporated is a\r\n_Catalogue raisonné_ which contains an enumeration of all the\r\ntomb-stones in England and Wales that are ornamented with those standard\r\n“Emblems of Mortality,”--skull, thigh-bones in saltire, and hour-glass.\r\nIn his last “Opus Magnum Mortis,” the notices of the several Dances of\r\nDeath in various parts of Europe are very much enlarged, but he has not\r\nbeen able to adduce any further arguments or evidences beyond what\r\nappeared in his first essay, to show that the cuts in the original\r\nedition of the Dance of Death, published at Lyons, were not designed by\r\nHolbein. Throughout the work there are undeniable proofs of the\r\ndiligence of the collector; but no evidences of a mind that could make\r\nthem available to a useful end. He is at once sceptical and credulous;\r\nhe denies that any poet of the name of Macaber ever lived; and yet he\r\nbelieves, on the sole authority of one T. Nieuhoff Picard, whose\r\nexistence is as doubtful as Macaber’s, that Holbein painted a Dance of\r\nDeath as large as life, in fresco, in the old palace at Whitehall.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-20: Mr. Douce himself says, “about 1794.” A copy in\r\n    the British Museum, formerly belonging to the late Reverend C. M.\r\n    Cracherode, has, however, that gentleman’s usual mark, and the\r\n    date 1793.]\r\n\r\nHaving now given a list of all the authentic editions of the Dance of\r\nDeath and of the principal copies of it, I shall next, before saying\r\nanything about the supposed designer or engraver, lay before the reader\r\na few specimens of the original cuts. Mr. Douce observes, of the\r\nforty-nine cuts given in his Dance of Death, 1833, that “they may be\r\nvery justly regarded as scarcely distinguishable from their fine\r\noriginals.” Now, without any intention of depreciating these clever\r\ncopies, I must pronounce them inferior to the originals, especially in\r\nthe heads and hands. In this respect the wood-cuts of the first Lyons\r\nedition of the Dance of Death are unrivalled by any other productions of\r\nthe art of wood engraving, either in past or present times. In the\r\npresent day, when mere delicacy of cutting in the modern French taste is\r\noften mistaken for good engraving, there are doubtless many admirers of\r\nthe art who fancy that there would be no difficulty in finding a wood\r\nengraver who might be fully competent to accurately copy the originals\r\nin the first edition of the Dance of Death. The experiment, however,\r\nwould probably convince the undertaker of such a task, whoever he might\r\nbe, that he had in this instance over-rated his abilities. Let the heads\r\nin the Lyons cuts, and those of any copies of them, old or recent, be\r\nexamined with a magnifying glass, and the excellence of the former will\r\nappear still more decidedly than when viewed with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nThe following cut is a copy of the same size as the original, which is\r\nthe second of the Dance of Death, of the edition of 1538. The subject is\r\nAdam and Eve eating of the forbidden fruit; and in the series of early\r\nimpressions, formerly Mr. Ottley’s, but now in the Print Room of the\r\nBritish Museum, it is intitled “_Adam Eva im Paradyss_”--Adam and Eve in\r\nParadise. The serpent, as in many other old engravings, as well as in\r\npaintings, is represented with a human face. In order to convey an idea\r\nof the original page, this cut is accompanied with its explanatory text\r\nand verses printed in similar type.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  Quia audiſti vocem vxoris tuæ, & comediſti\r\n    de ligno ex quo preceperam tibi ne comederes &c.\r\n\r\n  _GENESIS III_\r\n\r\n    [Figure]\r\n\r\n  _ADAM_ fut par _EVE_ deceu\r\n  Et contre _DIEV_ mangea la pomm\r\n  Dont tous deux out la Mort receu,\r\n  Et depuis fut mortel tout homme.\r\n                                C]\r\n\r\nIn the two first cuts, which represent the Creation of Eve, and Adam\r\ntaking the forbidden fruit, the figure of Death is not seen. In the\r\nthird, Adam and Eve driven out of Paradise, Death, playing on a kind of\r\nlyre, is seen preceding them; and in the fourth, Adam cultivating the\r\nearth, Death is perceived assisting him in his labour. In the fifth,\r\nintitled _Gebeyn aller menschen_--Skeletons of all men--in the early\r\nimpressions of the cuts, formerly belonging to Mr. Ottley, but now in\r\nthe British Museum, all the figures are skeletons; one of them is seen\r\nbeating a pair of kettle drums, while others are sounding trumpets, as\r\nif rejoicing in the power which had been given to Death in consequence\r\nof the fall of man. The texts above this cut are, “Væ væ væ habitantibus\r\nin terra. APOCALYPSIS VIII;” and “Cuncta in quibus spiraculum vitæ est,\r\nmortua sunt. GENESIS VII.” In the sixth cut there are two figures of\r\nDeath,--one grinning at the pope as he bestows the crown on a kneeling\r\nemperor, and the other, wearing a cardinal’s hat, as a witness of the\r\nceremony. In the thirty-sixth cut, the Duchess, there are two figures of\r\nDeath introduced, and there are also two in the thirty-seventh, the\r\nPedlar; but in all the others of this edition, from the seventh to the\r\nthirty-ninth, inclusive, there is only a single figure of Death, and in\r\nevery instance his action and expression are highly comic, most\r\ndistinctly evincing that man’s destruction is his sport. In the fortieth\r\ncut there is no figure of Death; the Deity seated on a rainbow, with his\r\nfeet resting on the globe, is seen pronouncing final judgment on the\r\nhuman race. The forty-first, and last cut of the original edition,\r\nrepresents Death’s coat-of-arms----_Die wapen des Thots_. On an\r\nescutcheon, which is rent in several places, is a death’s-head, with\r\nsomething like a large worm proceeding from the mouth; above the\r\nescutcheon, a barred helmet, seen in front like that of a sovereign\r\nprince, is probably intended to represent the power of Death; the crest\r\nis a pair of fleshless arms holding something like a large stone\r\nimmediately above an hour-glass; on the dexter side of the escutcheon\r\nstands a gentleman, who seems to be calling the attention of the\r\nspectator to this memento of Death, and on the opposite side is a lady;\r\nin the distance are Alpine mountains, the top of the highest partly\r\nshaded by a cloud. The appropriate text is, “Memorare novissima, et in\r\næternum non peccabis. ECCLE. VII;” and the following are the verses\r\nunderneath:\r\n\r\n  “Si tu veulx vivre sans peché\r\n  Voy ceste imaige a tous propos,\r\n  Et point ne seras empesché\r\n  Quand tu t’en iras en repos.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe total number of cuts of the first edition in which Death is seen\r\nattending on men and women of all ranks and conditions, mocking them,\r\nseizing them, slaying them, or merrily leading them to their end, is\r\nthirty-seven.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  Spiritus meus attenuabitur, dies mihi bre-\r\n    viabuntur, & ſolum mihi ſupereſt ſepul-\r\n    chrum.\r\n\r\n  _IOB XVII_\r\n\r\n    [Figure]\r\n\r\n  Mes eſperitz ſont attendriz,\r\n  Et ma uie ſ’en ua tout beau.\r\n  Las mes longz iours ſont amoindriz\r\n  Plus ne me reſte qu’un tombeau.]\r\n\r\nThe above cut is a copy of the thirty-third, the Old Man--_Der Alt\r\nman_--whom Death leads in confiding imbecility to the grave, while he\r\npretends to support him and to amuse him with the music of a dulcimer.\r\nThe text and verses are given as they stand in the original.\r\n\r\nThe following cut is a copy of the thirty-sixth, the Duchess--_Die\r\nHertzoginn_. In this cut, as has been previously observed, there are two\r\nfigures of Death; one rouses her from the bed--where she appears to have\r\nbeen indulging in an afternoon nap--by pulling off the coverlet, while\r\nthe other treats her to a tune on the violin. On the frame of the bed,\r\nor couch, to the left, near the bottom of the cut, is seen the mark\r\n[[HL]], which has not a little increased the difficulty of arriving at\r\nany clear and unquestionable conclusion with respect to the designer or\r\nengraver of those cuts. The text and the verses are given literally, as\r\nin the two preceding specimens.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  De lectulo ſuper quem aſcendi-\r\n    ſti non deſcendes, ſed morte\r\n    morieris.\r\n\r\n  _III REG.

Death having\r\nbeen represented in the preceding cuts as beguiling men and women in\r\ncourt and council-chamber, in bed-room and hall, in street and field, by\r\nsea and by land, is here represented as visiting the dilapidated cottage\r\nof the poor, and, while the mother is engaged in cooking, seizing her\r\nyoungest child.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  Homo natus de muliere, brevi vivens tempore\r\n    repletur multis miſeriis, qui quaſi flos egre-\r\n    ditur, & conteritur, & fugit velut umbra.\r\n\r\n  _IOB XIIII_\r\n\r\n    [Figure]\r\n\r\n  Tout homme de la femme yſſant\r\n  Remply de miſere, & d’encombre,\r\n  Ainſi que fleur toſt finiſſant,\r\n  Sort & puis fuyt comme faict l’umbre.]\r\n\r\nThe cut of the Waggon overturned, from which the following is copied,\r\nfirst appeared with ten others in the edition of 1547. From an\r\ninspection of this cut, which most probably is that mentioned as being\r\nleft unfinished, in the prefatory address to Madame Jehanne de Touszele\r\nin the first edition, 1538, it will be perceived that the description\r\nwhich is there given of it is not correct, and hence arises a doubt if\r\nthe writer had actually seen it. He describes the driver as knocked\r\ndown, and lying bruised under his broken waggon, and he says that the\r\nfigure of Death is perceived roguishly sucking the wine out of a broken\r\ncask by means of a reed.[VI-21] In the cut itself, however, the waggoner\r\nis seen standing, wringing his hands as if in despair on account of the\r\naccident, and a figure of Death,--for there are two in this\r\ncut,--instead of sucking the wine, appears to be engaged in undoing the\r\nrope or chain by which the cask is secured to the waggon. A second\r\nfigure of Death is perceived carrying off one of the waggon-wheels. In\r\nthis cut the subject is not so well treated as in most of those in the\r\nedition of 1538; and it is also not so well engraved.--The text and\r\nverses annexed are from the edition of 1562.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-21: Mr. Douce, when correcting the mistake of the\r\n    writer of the address, commits an error himself. He says that\r\n    “Death is in the act of untwisting the _fastening to one of the\r\n    hoops_.” Now, it is very evident that he is undoing the rope or\r\n    chain that steadies the cask and confines it to the waggon. He has\r\n    hold of the stake or piece of wood, which serves as a +twitch+ to\r\n    tighten the rope or chain, in the manner in which large timber is\r\n    secured to the waggon in the present day.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  Il cheut en son chariot.\r\n\r\n  I. _ROIS_ IX.\r\n\r\n    [Figure]\r\n\r\n  Au passage de MORT perverse\r\n  Raison, Chartier tout esperdu,\r\n  Du corps le char, & chevaux verse,\r\n  Le vin (sang de vie) esperdu.]\r\n\r\nOf the eleven additional cuts inserted in the edition of 1547, there are\r\nfour of children, which, as has already been observed in page 334, have\r\nnot the slightest connexion with the Dance of Death. The following is a\r\ncopy of one of them. The editor seems to have found no difficulty in\r\nproviding the subject with a text; and it serves as a peg to hang a\r\nquatrain on as well as the others which contain personifications of\r\nDeath.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  Il sera percé de sagettes.\r\n\r\n  _EXOD. XIX._\r\n\r\n    [Figure]\r\n\r\n  L’eage du sens, du sang l’ardeur\r\n  Est legier dard, & foible escu\r\n  Contre MORT, qui un tel dardeur\r\n  De son propre dard rend vaincu.]\r\n\r\nIn the edition of 1562 five more cuts are inserted; but two of them\r\nonly--the Bridegroom and the Bride--have relation to the Dance of Death;\r\nthe other three are of a similar character to the four cuts of children\r\nfirst inserted in the edition of 1547. All the seven cuts of children\r\nhave been evidently designed by the same person. They are well engraved,\r\nbut not in so masterly a style as the forty-one cuts of the original\r\nedition. The following is a copy of one of the three which were inserted\r\nin the edition of 1562.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  Il partira les despoilles avec les puissans.\r\n\r\n  _ISAIE LIII._\r\n\r\n    [Figure]\r\n\r\n  Pour les victoires triumphées\r\n  Sur les plus forts des humains cœurs,\r\n  Les despoilles dresse en trophées\r\n  La MORT vaincresse des vainqueurs.]\r\n\r\nHaving now given what, perhaps, may be considered a sufficiently ample\r\naccount of the Lyons Dance of Death, it next appears necessary to make\r\nsome enquiries respecting the designer of the cuts. Until the\r\npublication of Mr. Douce’s observations, prefixed to the edition of\r\nHollar’s etchings from those cuts, by Edwards, about 1794, scarcely any\r\nwriter who mentions them seems to entertain a doubt of their having been\r\ndesigned by Holbein; and Papillon, in his usual manner, claims him as a\r\nwood engraver, and unhesitatingly declares that not only the cuts of the\r\nLyons Dance of Death, but all the other cuts which are generally\r\nsupposed to have been of his designing, were engraved by himself. Mr.\r\nDouce’s arguments are almost entirely negative,--for he produces no\r\nsatisfactory evidence to show that those cuts were certainly designed by\r\nsome other artist,--and they are chiefly founded on the passage in the\r\nfirst Lyons edition, where the writer speaks of the death of the person\r\n“qui nous en a icy imaginé si elegantes figures.”\r\n\r\nThe sum of Mr. Douce’s objections to Holbein being the designer of the\r\ncuts in question is as follows. “The singularity of this curious and\r\ninteresting dedication is deserving of the utmost attention. It seems\r\nvery strongly, if not decisively, to point out the edition to which it\r\nis prefixed, as the first; and what is of still more importance, to\r\ndeprive Holbein of any claim to the invention of the work. It most\r\ncertainly uses such terms of art as can scarcely be mistaken as\r\nconveying any other sense than that of originality of design. There\r\ncannot be words of plainer import than those which describe the painter,\r\nas he is expressly called, _delineating_ the subjects and leaving\r\nseveral of them unfinished: and whoever the artist might have been, it\r\nclearly appears that he was not living in 1538. Now, it is well known\r\nthat Holbein’s death did not take place before the year 1554, during the\r\nplague which ravaged London at that time. If then the expressions used\r\nin this dedication signify anything, it may surely be asked what becomes\r\nof any claim on the part of Holbein to the designs of the work in\r\nquestion, or does it not _at least_ remain in a situation of doubt and\r\ndifficulty?”[VI-22] With respect to the true import of the passage\r\nreferred to, my opinion is almost directly the reverse of that expressed\r\nby Mr. Douce.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-22: Dance of Death, p. 88. Edit. 1833 (Bohn’s edit.\r\n    1858, p. 77.)]\r\n\r\nWhat the writer of the address to Madame Jehanne de Touszele, in the\r\nLyons edition of 1538, says respecting the unfinished cuts, taken all\r\ntogether, seems to relate more properly to the engraver than the\r\ndesigner; more especially when we find that a cut--that of the\r\nWaggoner,--expressly noticed by him as being then unfinished, was given\r\nwith others of a similar character in a subsequent edition.\r\n\r\nFrom the incorrect manner in which the cut of the Waggoner is described,\r\nI am very much inclined to think that the writer had neither seen the\r\noriginal nor the other subjects already traced--the “_plusieurs aultres\r\nfigures jà par luy trassées_”--of whose “bold drawing, perspectives, and\r\nshadows,” he speaks in such terms of admiration. If the writer knew\r\nlittle of the process of wood engraving, he would be very likely to\r\ncommit the mistake of supposing that the engraver was also the designer\r\nof the cuts. Though I consider it by no means unlikely that the engraver\r\nmight have been dead before the publication of the first edition, yet I\r\nam very much inclined to believe that the passage in which the cuts are\r\nmentioned is purposely involved in obscurity: the writer, while he\r\nspeaks of the deceased artist in terms of the highest commendation, at\r\nthe same time carefully conceals his name. If the account in the preface\r\nbe admitted as correct, it would appear that the cuts were both designed\r\nand engraved by the same person, and that those already drawn on the\r\nblock[VI-23] remained unfinished in consequence of his decease; for if\r\nhe were _not_ the engraver, what prevented the execution of the other\r\nsubjects already traced, and of which the bold drawing, perspective, and\r\nshadows, all so gracefully delineated, are distinctly mentioned? The\r\nengraver, whoever he might be, was certainly not only the best of his\r\nage, but continues unsurpassed to the present day, and I am satisfied\r\nthat such precision of line as is seen in the heads could only be\r\nacquired by great practice. The designs are so excellent in drawing and\r\ncomposition, and so admirably are the different characters\r\nrepresented,--with such spirit, humour, and appropriate\r\nexpression,--that to have produced them would confer additional honour\r\non even the greatest painters of that or any other period. Are we then\r\nto suppose that those excellencies of design and of engraving were\r\ncombined in an obscure individual whose name is not to be found in the\r\nroll of fame, who lived comparatively unknown, and whose death is only\r\nincidentally noticed in an ambiguous preface written by a nameless\r\npedant, and professedly addressed to an abbess whose very existence is\r\nquestionable?[VI-24] Such a supposition I conceive to be in the highest\r\ndegree improbable; and, on the contrary, I am perfectly satisfied that\r\nthe cuts in question were _not_ designed and engraved by the same\r\nperson. Furthermore, admitting the address to Madame Jehanne de Touszele\r\nto be written in good faith, I am firmly of opinion that the person\r\nwhose death is there mentioned, was the engraver, and not the designer\r\nof the cuts of the first edition.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-23: The words “_jà par luy trassées_” will apply more\r\n    properly to drawings already made on the block, but unengraved,\r\n    than to unfinished drawings on paper. It is indeed almost certain\r\n    that the writer meant the former, for their “_audacieux traicts,\r\n    perspectives, et umbrages_” are mentioned; they were moreover\r\n    “_gracieusement deliniées_.” These expressions will apply\r\n    correctly to a finished, though unengraved design on the block,\r\n    but scarcely to an unfinished drawing on paper.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-24: I am very much inclined to think that Madame\r\n    Jehanne de Touszele is a fictitious character. I have had no\r\n    opportunities of learning if such a person were really abbess of\r\n    the Convent of St. Peter at Lyons in 1538, and must therefore\r\n    leave this point to be decided by some other enquirer.]\r\n\r\nThe mark [[HL]] in the cut of the Duchess, is certainly not Holbein’s;\r\nand Mr. Douce says, “that it was intended to express the name of the\r\ndesigner, cannot be supported by evidence of any kind.” That it is not\r\nthe mark of the designer, I agree with Mr. Douce, but my conclusion is\r\ndrawn from premises directly the reverse of his; for had I not found\r\nevidence elsewhere to convince me that this mark can only be that of the\r\nengraver, I should most certainly have concluded that it was intended\r\nfor the mark of the designer. In direct opposition to what Mr. Douce\r\nhere says, up to the time of the publication of the Lyons Dance of\r\nDeath, the mark on wood-cuts is most frequently that of the designer,\r\nand whenever that of the engraver appears, it is as an exception to the\r\ngeneral custom. It is, in fact, upon the evidence of the mark alone that\r\nthe greater part of the wood-cut designs of Durer, Cranach, Burgmair,\r\nBehaim, Baldung, Grün, and other old masters, are respectively ascribed\r\nto them. The cuts of the Triumphal Procession of Maximilian with Hans\r\nBurgmair’s mark in front, and the names of the engravers written at the\r\nback of the blocks, may serve as an illustration of the general\r\npractice, which is directly the reverse of Mr. Douce’s opinion. If the\r\nweight of probability be not on the opposite side, the mark in question\r\nought certainly, according to the usual practice of the period, to be\r\nconsidered as that of the designer.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent page of the same chapter, Mr. Douce most inconsistently\r\nsays, “There is an unfortunate ambiguity connected with the marks that\r\nare found on ancient engravings on wood, and it has been a _very great\r\nerror_ on the part of all the writers who treat on such engravings, in\r\nreferring the marks that accompany them to the block-cutters, or as the\r\nGermans properly denominate them the _formschneiders_, whilst, perhaps,\r\nthe greatest part of them really belong to the designers.” He commits\r\nin the early part of the chapter the very error which he ascribes to\r\nothers. According to his own principles, as expressed in the last\r\nextract, he was bound to allow the mark [[HL]] to be that of the\r\ndesigner until he could show on probable grounds that it was not. But\r\nthough Mr. Douce might deny that Holbein were the designer of those\r\ncuts, it seems that he durst not venture to follow up the line of his\r\nargument, and declare that Hans Lutzelburger _was_ the designer, which\r\nhe certainly might have done with at least as much reason as has\r\nled him to decide that Holbein _was not_. But he prudently abstained\r\nfrom venturing on such an affirmation, the improbability of which,\r\nnotwithstanding the mark, might have led his readers to inquire, how\r\nit happened that so talented an artist should have remained so long\r\nundiscovered, and that even his contemporaries should not have known\r\nhim as the designer of those subjects.\r\n\r\nThough I am satisfied that the mark [[HL]] is that of the _engraver_ of\r\nthe cuts in the first edition of the Lyons Dance of Death, I by no means\r\npretend to account for its appearing alone--thus forming an exception to\r\nthe general rule--without the mark of the designer, and without any\r\nmention of his name either in the title or preface to the book. We have\r\nno knowledge of the connexion in the way of business between the working\r\nwood engravers and the designers of that period; but there seems reason\r\nto believe that the former sometimes got drawings made at their own\r\nexpense and risk, and, when engraved, either published them on their own\r\naccount, or disposed of them to booksellers and printers. It is also to\r\nbe observed that about the time of the publication of the first Lyons\r\nedition of the Dance of Death, or a few years before, wood engravers\r\nbegan to occasionally introduce their name or mark into the cut, in\r\naddition to that of the designer. A cut, in a German translation of\r\nCicero de Officiis, Frankfort, 1538, contains two marks; one of them\r\nbeing that of Hans Sebald Behaim, and the other, the letters H. W.,\r\nwhich I take to be that of the engraver. At a later period this practice\r\nbecame more frequent, and a considerable number of wood-cuts executed\r\nbetween 1540 and 1580 contain two marks; one of the designer, and the\r\nother of the engraver: in wood-cuts designed by Virgil Solis in\r\nparticular, double marks are of frequent occurrence. As it seems evident\r\nthat the publishers of the Lyons Dance of Death were desirous of\r\nconcealing the name of the designer, and as it appears likely that they\r\nhad purchased the cuts ready engraved from a Swiss or a German,--for the\r\ndesigns are certainly not French,--it surely cannot be surprising that\r\nhe should wish to affix his mark to those most admirable specimens of\r\nart. Moreover, if those cuts were not executed under the personal\r\nsuperintendence of the designer, but when he was chiefly resident in a\r\ndistant country, the engraver would thus have the uncontrolled liberty\r\nof inserting his own mark; and more especially, if those cuts were a\r\nprivate speculation of his own, and not executed for a publisher who had\r\nemployed an artist to make the designs. Another reason, perhaps equally\r\nus good as any of the foregoing, might be suggested; as those cuts are\r\ndecidedly the best executed of any of that period, the designer--even if\r\nhe had opportunities of seeing the proofs--might have permitted the mark\r\nof the engraver to appear on one of them, in approbation of his talent.\r\n\r\nThis mark, [[HL]], was first assigned to a wood engraver named Hans\r\nLutzelburger, by M. Christian von Mechel, a celebrated engraver of\r\nBasle, who in 1780 published forty-five copper-plate engravings of a\r\nDance of Death from drawings said to be by Holbein, and which almost\r\nin every respect agree with the corresponding cuts in the Lyons work,\r\nthough of greater size.[VI-25] M. Mechel’s conjecture respecting the\r\nengraver of those cuts appears to have been first published in the\r\nsixteenth volume of Von Murr’s Journal; but though I am inclined to\r\nthink that he is correct, it has not been satisfactorily shown that\r\nHans Lutzelburger ever used the mark [[HL]]. He, however, lived at that\r\nperiod, and it is almost certain that he executed an alphabet of small\r\ninitial letters representing a Dance of Death, which appear to have been\r\nfirst used at Basle by the printers Bebelius and Cratander about 1530.\r\nWe give (on the following page) the entire series. He is also supposed\r\nto have engraved two other alphabets of ornamental initial letters, one\r\nrepresenting a dance of peasants, “intermixed,” says Mr. Douce, “with\r\nother subjects, some of which are not of the most delicate nature;” the\r\nother representing groups of children in various playful attitudes.\r\nAll those three alphabets are generally described by German and Swiss\r\nwriters on art as having been designed by Holbein; and few impartial\r\npersons I conceive can have much doubt on the subject, if almost perfect\r\nidentity between most of the figures and those in his known productions\r\nbe allowed to have any weight.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-25: Mechel’s work is in folio, with four subjects on\r\n    each full page, and is entitled “Oeuvre de Jean Holbein, ou\r\n    Receuil de Gravures d’après ses plus beaux ouvrages, &c. Première\r\n    Partie. La Triomphe de Mort.” It is dedicated to George III, and\r\n    the presentation copy is in the King’s Library at the British\r\n    Museum. The first part contains, besides forty-five subjects of\r\n    the Dance of Death, the design for the sheath of a dagger from a\r\n    drawing ascribed to Holbein, which has been re-engraved in the\r\n    work of Mr. Douce. It is extremely doubtful if the drawings of the\r\n    Dance, from which Mechel’s engravings are copied, be really by\r\n    Holbein. They were purchased by M. Fleischmann of Strasburg, at\r\n    Crozat’s sale at Paris in 1741. It was stated in the catalogue\r\n    that they had formed part of the Arundelian collection, and that\r\n    they had afterwards come into the possession of Jan Bockhorst,\r\n    commonly called Lang Jan, a contemporary of Vandyke. This piece of\r\n    information, however, can only be received as an auctioneer’s\r\n    puff. M. Mechel himself, according to Mr. Douce, had not been able\r\n    to trace those drawings previously to their falling into the hands\r\n    of Monsieur Crozat. They were purchased of M. Fleischmann by\r\n    Prince Gallitzin, a Russian nobleman, by whom they were lent to\r\n    M. Mechel. They are now in the Imperial Library at Petersburg.\r\n    According to Mr. Coxe, who saw them when in M. Mechel’s\r\n    possession, they were drawn with a pen, and slightly shaded with\r\n    Indian ink. Hegner, in his Life of Holbein, speaks slightingly of\r\n    Mechel’s engravings, which he says were executed by one of his\r\n    workmen from copies of the pretended original drawings made by an\r\n    artist named Rudolph Schellenburg of Winterthur. Those\r\n    copper-plates certainly appear feeble when compared with the\r\n    wood-cut in the Lyons work, and Hegner’s criticism on the figure\r\n    of Eve seems just, though Mr. Douce does not approve of it. Hegner\r\n    says, “Let any one compare the figure of Eve under the tree in\r\n    Mechel’s second plate with the second wood-cut; in the former she\r\n    is sitting in as elegant an attitude as if she belonged to a\r\n    French family by Boucher.”--Boucher, a French painter, who died in\r\n    1770, was famous in his time for the pretty women introduced into\r\n    his landscapes.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere is a set of proofs of the alphabet of the Dance of Death, printed\r\non one sheet, preserved in the Public Library at Basle, and underneath\r\nis printed in moveable letters the name +HAnns Lützelburger\r\nformschnider, genannt Franck+,--that is, “Hanns Lutzelburger, wood\r\nengraver, named Franck.” The first H is an ornamented Roman capital; the\r\nother letters of the name are in the German character. The size of the\r\ncuts in this alphabet of the Dance of Death is one inch by\r\nseven-eighths. The reason for supposing that Hans Lutzelburger was the\r\nengraver of the cuts in the first edition of the Lyons Dance of Death\r\nare: 1. The similarity of style between the latter and those of the\r\nBasle alphabet of the same subject; and 2. The correspondence of the\r\nmark in the cut of the Duchess with the initial letters of the name\r\nH[ans] L[utzelburger], and the fact of his being a wood engraver of that\r\nperiod. Mr. Douce, in the seventh chapter of his work, professes to\r\nexamine the “claim of Hans Lutzelburger as to the design or execution of\r\nthe Lyons engravings of the Dance of Death,” but his investigations seem\r\nvery unsatisfactory; and his chapter is one of those “in which,” as\r\nFielding says, “nothing is concluded.” He gives no opinion as to whether\r\nLutzelburger was the designer of the Lyons cuts or not, though this is\r\none of the professed topics of his investigation; and even his opinion,\r\nfor the time being, as to the engraver, only appears in the heading of\r\nthe following chapter, where it is thus announced: “_List of several\r\neditions of the Lyons work on the Dance of Death, with the mark of\r\nLutzenburger_.”[VI-26] His mind, however, does not appear to have been\r\nfinally made up on this point; for in a subsequent page, 215, speaking\r\nof the mark [[HL]] in the cut of the Duchess, which he had previously\r\nmentioned as that of Hans Lutzelburger, he says, “_but to whomsoever\r\nthis mark may turn out to belong_, certain it is that Holbein never made\r\nuse of it.” His only unalterable decision appears to be that Holbein did\r\nnot design the cuts of the Lyons Dance of Death, and in support of it he\r\nputs forth sundry arguments which are at once absurd and inconsistent;\r\nrejects unquestionable evidence which makes for the contrary opinion;\r\nand admits the most improbable that seems to favour his own.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-26: Mr. Douce in every instance spells the name thus.\r\n    In the proofs of the alphabet of the Dance of Death it is\r\n    _Lützelburger_, and below the cut with the date 1522,\r\n    _Leuczellburger_.]\r\n\r\nMr. Douce, in his seventh chapter, also gives a list of cuts, which he\r\nsays were executed by Hans Lutzelburger; but out of the seven single\r\ncuts and three alphabets which he enumerates, I am inclined to think\r\nthat Lutzelburger’s name is only to be found attached to one single cut\r\nand to one alphabet,--the latter being that of the initial letters\r\nrepresenting a Dance of Death. The single cut to which I allude--and\r\nwhich, I believe, is the only one of the kind that has his name\r\nunderneath it,--represents a combat in a wood between some naked men and\r\na body of peasants. Within the cut, to the left, is the mark, probably\r\nof the designer, on a reversed tablet, [Symbol] thus; and underneath is\r\nthe following inscription, from a separate block: HANNS . LEUCZELLBURGER\r\n. FURMSCHNIDER × 1.5.2.2. An impression of this cut is preserved in the\r\nPublic Library at Basle; and an alphabet of Roman capitals, engraved on\r\nwood, is printed on the same folio, below Lutzelburger’s name. In not\r\none of the other single cuts does this engraver’s name occur, nor in\r\nfact any mark that can be fairly ascribed to him. The seventh cut,\r\ndescribed by Mr. Douce,--a copy of Albert Durer’s Decollation of John\r\nthe Baptist,--is ascribed to Lutzelburger on the authority of Zani.\r\nAccording to this writer,--for I have not seen the cut myself any more\r\nthan Mr. Douce,--it has “the mark H. L. reversed,” which perhaps may\r\nprove to be L. H. “In the index of names,” says Mr. Douce, “he (Zani)\r\nfinds his name thus written, HANS LUTZELBURGER FORMSCHNIDER GENANT\r\n(chiamato) FRANCK, and calls him the true prince of engravers on wood.”\r\nIn what index Zani found the reversed mark thus expounded does not\r\nappear; I, however, am decidedly of opinion that there is no wood-cut in\r\nexistence with the mark H. L. which can be ascribed with anything like\r\ncertainty to Lutzelburger; and his name is only to be found at length\r\n_under_ the cut of the Fight above mentioned, and printed in moveable\r\ncharacters on the sheet containing the proofs of the alphabet of the\r\nDance of Death.[VI-27] The title of “true prince of engravers on wood,”\r\ngiven by Zani to Lutzelburger, can only be admitted on the supposition\r\nof his being the engraver of the cuts in the first edition of the Lyons\r\nDance of Death; but it yet remains to be proved that he ever used the\r\nmark [[HL]] or the separate letters H. L. on any previous or subsequent\r\ncut. Though, from his name appearing on the page containing the alphabet\r\nof the Dance of Death, and from the correspondence of his initials with\r\nthe mark in the cut of the Duchess in the Lyons Dance of Death, I am\r\ninclined to think that he was the engraver of the cuts in the latter\r\nwork, yet I have thought it necessary to enter thus fully into the\r\ngrounds of his pretensions to the execution of those, and other wood\r\nengravings, in order that the reader may judge for himself.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-27: There are proofs of this alphabet in the Royal\r\n    Collection at Dresden, as well as in the Public Library at Basle.]\r\n\r\nHegner, in his Life of Holbein, treats the claims that have been\r\nadvanced on behalf of Lutzelburger too lightly. He not only denies that\r\nhe was the engraver of the cuts in the first edition of the Lyons work,\r\nbut also that he executed the cuts of the alphabet of the Dance of\r\nDeath, although his name with the addition of “wood engraver”--\r\n_formschnider_--be printed on the sheet of proofs. If we cannot admit\r\nthe inscription in question as evidence of Lutzelburger being the\r\nengraver of this alphabet, we may with equal reason question if any wood\r\nengraver actually executed the cut or cuts under which his name only\r\nappears printed in type, or which may be ascribed to him in the title of\r\na book. Mr. Douce, speaking of the three alphabets,--of peasants, boys,\r\nand a Dance of Death,--all of which he supposes to have been engraved by\r\nLutzelburger, says that the proofs “may have been deposited by him in\r\nhis _native_ city,” meaning Basle. Hegner, however, says that there is\r\nno trace of him to be found either in registers of baptism or\r\nburger-lists of Basle. He further adds, though I by no means concur with\r\nhim in this opinion, “It is indeed likely that, as a travelling dealer\r\nin works of art--who, according to the custom of that period, took up\r\ntheir temporary residence sometimes in one place, sometimes in\r\nanother,--he had obtained possession of those blocks, [of the alphabet\r\nof Death’s Dance, and the Fight, with his name,] and that he sold\r\nimpressions from them in the way of trade.”[VI-28] Mr. Douce says that\r\nit may admit of a doubt whether the alphabets ascribed to Lutzelburger\r\nwere cut on metal or on wood. It may admit of a doubt, certainly, with\r\none who knows very little of the practice of wood engraving, but none\r\nwith a person who is accustomed to see cuts executed in a much more\r\ndelicate style by wood engravers of very moderate abilities. To engrave\r\nthem on wood, would be comparatively easy, so far as relates to the mere\r\ndelicacy of the lines; but it would be a task of great difficulty to\r\nengrave them in relief in any metal which should be much harder than\r\nthat of which types are composed. To suppose that they might have been\r\nexecuted in type-metal, on account of the delicacy of the lines, would\r\ninvolve a contradiction; for not only can finer lines be cut on box-wood\r\nthan on type-metal, but also with much greater facility.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-28: Hans Holbein der Jüngere, S. 332.]\r\n\r\nIt perhaps may not be unnecessary to give here two instances of the many\r\nvague and absurd conjectures which have been propounded respecting the\r\ndesigner or the engraver of the cuts in the Lyons editions of the Dance\r\nof Death. In a copy of this work of the edition 1545 now in the British\r\nMuseum, but formerly belonging to the Reverend C. M. Cracherode,\r\na portrait of a painter or engraver named Hans Ladenspelder is inserted\r\nopposite to the cut of the Duchess, as if in support of the conjecture\r\nthat _he_ might be the designer of those cuts, merely from the\r\ncircumstance of the initial letters of his name corresponding with\r\nthe mark [[HL]]. The portrait is a small oval engraved on copper,\r\nwith an ornamental border, round which is the following inscription:\r\n“Imago Joannis Ladenspelder, Essendiensis, Anno ætatis suæ xxviii.\r\n1540.”[VI-29] The mark [[L]] is perceived on this portrait, and\r\nunderneath is written the following MS. note, referring to the mark\r\nin the cut of the Duchess: “[[HL]] the mark of the designer of these\r\ndesigns of Death’s Dance, not H. Holbein. By several persons that have\r\nseen Holbein’s Death Dance at Basil, it is not like these, nor in the\r\nsame manner.” This note, so far as relates to the implied conjecture\r\nabout Ladenspelder, may be allowed to pass without remark for what it is\r\nworth; but it seems necessary to remind the reader that the painting of\r\nthe Dance of Death at Basle, here evidently alluded to, _was not_ the\r\nwork of Holbein, and to observe that this note is not in the handwriting\r\nof Mr. Cracherode, but that it has apparently been written by a former\r\nowner of the volume.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-29: Hans Ladenspelder was a native of Essen, a\r\n    frontier town in the duchy of Berg. The following mark is to be\r\n    found on his engravings [Symbol], which Bartsch thinks may be\r\n    intended for the single letters I. L. V. E. S.,--representing the\r\n    words _Joannes Ladenspelder Von Essen Sculpsit_.]\r\n\r\nIn a copy of the first edition, now lying before me, a former owner has\r\nwritten on the fly-leaf the following verses from page 158 of the\r\nNugæ--Lyons, 1540,--of Nicholas Borbonius, a French poet:\r\n\r\n  “Videre qui vult Parrhasium cum Zeuxide,\r\n    Accersat a Britannia\r\n  Hansum Ulbium, et Georgium Reperdium\r\n    Lugduno ab urbe Galliæ.”\r\n\r\nThe meaning of these verses may be thus expressed in English:\r\n\r\n  Whoever wishes to behold,\r\n  Painters like to those of old,\r\n  To England straightway let him send,\r\n  And summon Holbein to attend;\r\n  Reperdius,[VI-30] too, from Lyons bring,\r\n  A city of the Gallic King.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-30: Of this George Reperdius, or his works, nothing,\r\n    I believe, is known beyond the brief mention of his name in\r\n    conjunction with that of Holbein in the verses of Bourbon.]\r\n\r\nTo the extract from Borbonius,--or Bourbon, as he is more frequently\r\ncalled, without the Latin termination,--the writer has added a note:\r\n“_An Reperdius harum Iconum sculptor fuerit?_” That is: “Query, if\r\nReperdius were the engraver of these cuts?”--meaning the cuts contained\r\nin the Lyons Dance of Death. Mr. Douce also cites the preceding verses\r\nfrom Nicholas Bourbon; and upon so slight and unstable a foundation he,\r\n_more solito_, raises a ponderous superstructure. He, in fact, says,\r\nthat “it is _extremely probable_ that he might have begun the work in\r\nquestion [the designs for the Dance of Death], and have died before he\r\ncould complete it, and that the Lyons publishers might have afterwards\r\nemployed Holbein to finish what was left undone, as well as to make\r\ndesigns for additional subjects which appeared in the subsequent\r\neditions. Thus would Holbein be so connected with the work as to obtain\r\nin future such notice as would constitute him by general report the real\r\ninventor of it.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps in the whole of the discussion on this subject a more tortuous\r\npiece of argument is not to be found. It strikingly exemplifies Mr.\r\nDouce’s eagerness to avail himself of the most trifling circumstance\r\nwhich seemed to favour his own views; and his manner of twisting and\r\ntwining it is sufficient to excite a suspicion even in the mind of the\r\nmost careless inquirer, that the chain of argument which consists of a\r\nseries of such links must be little better than a rope of sand. Mr.\r\nDouce must have had singular notions of probability, when, upon the mere\r\nmention of the name of Reperdius, by Bourbon, as a painter then residing\r\nat Lyons, he asserts that it is _extremely probable_ that he, Reperdius,\r\nmight have begun the work: it is evident that he does not employ the\r\nterm in its usual and proper sense. If for “_extremely probable_” the\r\nwords “_barely possible_” be substituted, the passage will be\r\nunobjectionable; and will then fairly represent the value of the\r\nconjecture of Reperdius having designed any of the cuts in question. If\r\nit be _extremely probable_ that the cuts of the first edition of the\r\nLyons Dance of Death were designed by Reperdius, from the mere\r\noccurrence of his name in Bourbon, the evidence in favour of their being\r\ndesigned by Holbein ought with equal reason to be considered as\r\n_plusquam-perfect_; for the voices of his contemporaries are expressly\r\nin his favour, the cuts themselves bear a strong general resemblance to\r\nthose which are known to be of his designing, and some of the figures\r\nand details in the cuts of the Dance of Death correspond so nearly with\r\nothers in the Bible-cuts designed by Holbein, and also printed at Lyons\r\nby the brothers Trechsel, and in the same year, that there cannot be a\r\ndoubt in the mind of any impartial inquirer who shall compare them, that\r\neither both series must have been designed by the same person, or that\r\nHolbein had servilely copied the works of an unknown artist greater than\r\nhimself. Upon one of the horns of this dilemma, Mr. Douce, and all who\r\nassert that the cuts of the Lyons Dance of Death _were not designed by\r\nHolbein_, must inevitably be fixed.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest evidences in favour of Holbein being the designer of\r\nthe cuts in the Lyons Dance of Death is Nicholas Bourbon, the author of\r\nthe epigram previously cited. In an edition of his Nugæ, published at\r\nBasle in 1540, are the following verses:[VI-31]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-31: Neither these verses, nor those previously cited,\r\n    occur in the first edition of the Nugæ, Paris, 1533.]\r\n\r\n_De morte picta à Hanso pictore nobili._\r\n\r\n  Dum mortis Hansus pictor imaginem exprimit,\r\n  Tanta arte mortem retulit ut mors vivere\r\n  Videatur ipsa: et ipse se immortalibus\r\n  Parem Diis fecerit operis hujus gloria.\r\n\r\nNow,--after premising that the term _picta_ was applied\r\nto designs engraved on wood, as well as to paintings in oil or\r\nwater-colours,[VI-32]--it may be asked to what work of Holbein’s\r\ndo these lines refer? The painting in the church-court at Basle\r\nwas not executed by Holbein; neither was it ascribed to him by his\r\ncontemporaries; for the popular error which assigns it to him appears to\r\nhave originated with certain travellers who visited Basle upwards of a\r\nhundred years after Holbein’s decease. It indeed may be answered that\r\nBourbon might allude to the _alphabet_ of the Dance of Death which has\r\nbeen ascribed to Holbein. A mere supposition of this kind, however,\r\nwould be untenable in this instance; for there is no direct evidence to\r\nshow that Holbein was the designer of this alphabet, and the principal\r\nreason for supposing it to have been designed by him rests upon the\r\nprevious assumption of his being the designer of the cuts of the Lyons\r\nDance of Death. Deny him the honour of this work, and assert that the\r\nlast quoted verses of Bourbon must relate to some other, and the\r\ndifficulty of showing by anything like credible evidence, that he was\r\nthe designer of any other series of cuts, or even of a single cut, or\r\npainting, of the same subject, becomes increased tenfold. Mr. Douce,\r\nwith the gross inconsistency that distinguishes the whole of his\r\narguments on this subject, ascribes the alphabet of the Dance of\r\nPeasants to Holbein, and yet cautiously avoids mentioning him as the\r\ndesigner of the alphabet of the Dance of Death, though the reasons for\r\nthis conclusion are precisely the same as those on which he rests the\r\nformer assertion. Nay, so confused and contradictory are his opinions on\r\nthis point, that in another part of his book he actually describes both\r\nalphabets as being the work of the same designer and the same engraver.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-32: At that period a wood-cut, as well as a painting,\r\n    was termed _pictura_.--On the title-page of an edition of the New\r\n    Testament, with wood-cuts, Zurich, 1554, by Froschover, we find\r\n    the following: “Novi Testamenti Editio postrema per Des. Erasmum\r\n    Roterodamum. Omnia _picturis_ illustrata.”]\r\n\r\n“Some of the writers on engraving,” says Mr. Douce, “have manifested\r\ntheir usual inaccuracy on the subject of Holbein’s Dance of\r\nPeasants. . . . . . . There is, however, _no doubt_ that his beautiful\r\npencil was employed on this subject in various ways, of which the\r\nfollowing specimens are worthy of being recorded. In a set of initial\r\nletters frequently used in books printed at Basle and elsewhere,”\r\n&c. After thus having unhesitatingly ascribed the Dance of Peasants to\r\nHolbein, Mr. Douce, in a subsequent page,--when giving a list of cuts\r\nwhich he ascribes to Hans Lutzelburger,--writes as follows: “8. An\r\nalphabet with a Dance of Death, the subjects of which, with a few\r\nexceptions, are the same as those in the other Dance; the designs,\r\nhowever, occasionally vary,” &c. On concluding his description of this\r\nalphabet, he thus notices the alphabet of the Dance of Peasants, having\r\napparently forgot that he had previously ascribed the latter to Holbein.\r\n“9. Another alphabet _by the same artists_. It is a Dance of Peasants,\r\nintermixed with other subjects, some of which are not of the most\r\ndelicate nature.”[VI-33]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-33: Douce’s Dance of Death, pp. 80, 100, and 101.]\r\n\r\nIt is, however, uncertain if Mr. Douce really did believe Holbein to be\r\nthe designer of the alphabet of the Dance of Death, though from the\r\npreceding extracts it is plainly, though indirectly asserted, that he\r\n_was_. In his wish to claim the engraving of the Dance of Peasants for\r\nLutzelburger, Mr. Douce does not seem to have been aware that from the\r\nwords “by the same artists,” coupled with his previous assertion, of\r\nHolbein being the designer of that alphabet, it followed as a direct\r\nconsequence that he was also the designer of the alphabet of the Dance\r\nof Death. Putting this charitable construction on Mr. Douce’s words, it\r\nfollows that _his_ assertion of Lutzelburger being the engraver of the\r\nDance of Peasants is purely gratuitous. If Mr. Douce really believed\r\nthat Holbein was the designer of the alphabet of the Dance of Death, he\r\nought in fairness to have expressly declared his opinion; although such\r\ndeclaration would have caused his arguments, against Holbein being the\r\ndesigner of the cuts in the Lyons Dance of Death, to appear more\r\nparadoxical and absurd than they are when unconnected with such an\r\nopinion; for what person, with the slightest pretensions to rationality,\r\ncould assert that Holbein was the designer of the alphabet of the Dance\r\nof Death executed in 1530, the subjects, with few exceptions, the same\r\nas those in the Dance of Death published at Lyons in 1538, and yet in\r\ndirect opposition to contemporary testimony, and the internal evidence\r\nof the subjects themselves, deny that he was the designer of the cuts in\r\nthe latter work, on the sole authority of the nameless writer of a\r\npreface which only appeared in the first edition of the book, and which,\r\nthere seems reason to suspect, was addressed to an imaginary personage?\r\nWas Madame Jehanne de Touszele likely to feel herself highly\r\ncomplimented by having dedicated to her a work which contains undeniable\r\nevidences of the artist’s having been no friend to popery? In one cut a\r\ncouple of fiends appear to be ridiculing his “Holiness” the pope; and in\r\nanother is a young gallant with a guitar, entertaining a nun in her\r\nbed-chamber. If a pious abbess of St. Peter’s, Lyons, in 1538, should\r\nhave considered that such cuts “tended to edification,” she must have\r\nbeen an extremely liberal woman for her age. It is exceedingly amusing,\r\nin looking over the cuts of the Lyons Dance of Death, to contrast the\r\ndrollery and satire of the designer with the endeavours of the textuary\r\nand versifier to give them a devout and spiritual turn.\r\n\r\nAs it is certain from the verses of Bourbon, in praise of Holbein as the\r\npainter or designer of a subject, or a series of subjects, representing\r\n“Death as if he were alive,”--ut mors vivere videatur,--that this\r\ncelebrated artist _had designed_ a Dance of Death, Mr. Douce, being\r\nunable to deny the evidence thus afforded, paradoxically proceeds to fit\r\nthose verses to his own theory; and after quoting them, at page 139,\r\nproceeds as follows: “It has already been demonstrated that these lines\r\ncould not refer to the old painting of the Macaber Dance at the\r\nDominican convent, whilst from the important dedication to the edition\r\nof the wood-cuts first published at Lyons in 1538, it is next to\r\nimpossible that that work could then have been in Borbonius’s\r\ncontemplation. It appears from several places in his Nugæ that he was in\r\nEngland in 1535, at which time Holbein drew his portrait in such a\r\nmanner as to excite his gratitude and admiration in another copy of\r\nverses . . . . . . He returned to Lyons in 1536, and it is known that he\r\nwas there in 1538, when he probably wrote the complimentary lines in\r\nHolbein’s Biblical designs a short time before their publication, either\r\nout of friendship to the painter, or at the instance of the Lyons\r\npublisher, with whom he was certainly connected.--Now, if Borbonius,\r\nduring his residence at Lyons, had been assured that the designs in the\r\nwood-cuts of the Dance of Death were the production of Holbein, would\r\nnot his before-mentioned lines on that subject have been likewise\r\nintroduced into the Lyons edition of it, or at least into some\r\nsubsequent editions, in none of which is any mention whatever made of\r\nHolbein, although the work was continued even after the death of that\r\nartist? The application, therefore, of Borbonius’s lines must be sought\r\nfor elsewhere; but it is greatly to be regretted that he has not\r\nadverted to the place where the painting,[VI-34] as he seems to call it,\r\nwas made.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-34: Mr. Douce here seems to lay some weight on the\r\n    word _picta_, which, as has been previously observed, was applied\r\n    equally to wood engravings and paintings.]\r\n\r\nMr. Douce next proceeds in his search after the “painting,” and he is\r\nnot long in finding what he wishes for. According to his statement,\r\n“_very soon after_ the calamitous fire at Whitehall, 1697, which\r\nconsumed nearly the whole of that palace, a person, calling himself\r\nT. Nieuhoff Piccard, probably belonging to the household of William III,\r\nand a man who appears to have been an amateur artist,” made etchings\r\nafter nineteen of the cuts in the Lyons Dance of Death. Impressions of\r\nthose etchings, accompanied with manuscript dedications, appear to have\r\nbeen presented by this T. Nieuhoff Piccard to his friends or patrons,\r\nand among others to a Mynheer Heymans, and to “the high, noble, and\r\nwell-born Lord William Denting, Lord of Rhoon, Pendraght,” &c. The\r\naddress to Mynheer Heymans contains the following important piece of\r\ninformation respecting a work of Holbein’s, which appears most\r\nsingularly to have escaped the notice of every other writer, whether\r\nEnglish or foreign. “Sir,--The costly palace of Whitehall, erected by\r\nCardinal Wolsey, and the residence of King Henry VIII, contains, among\r\nother performances of art, a Dance of Death, _painted by Holbein_, in\r\nits galleries, which, through an unfortunate conflagration, has been\r\nreduced to ashes.”[VI-35] In the dedication to the “high, noble, and\r\nwell-born Lord William Benting,” the information respecting this curious\r\nwork of art,--all memory of which would have perished had it not been\r\nfor the said T. Nieuhoff Piccard,--is rather more precise. “Sir, [not My\r\nLord,]--In the course of my constant love and pursuit of works of art,\r\nit has been my good fortune to meet with that scarce little work of Hans\r\nHolbein, neatly engraved on wood, and which he himself had _painted as\r\nlarge as life_, in fresco, on the walls of Whitehall.” Who Mynheer\r\nHeymans was will probably never be discovered, but he seems to have been\r\na person of some consequence in his day, though unfortunately never\r\nmentioned in any history or memoirs of the period, for it appears that\r\nthe court thought proper, in consideration of his singular deserts, to\r\ncause a dwelling to be built for him at Whitehall. My Lord William\r\nBenting,[VI-36]--though from his name and titles he might be mistaken\r\nfor a member of the Bentinck family,--appears to have been actually born\r\nin the palace. It is, however, very unfortunate that his name does not\r\noccur in the peerage of that time; and as neither Rhoon nor Pendraght\r\nare to be found in Flanders or Holland, it is not unlikely that these\r\nmay be the names of two of his lordship’s _castles in Spain_.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-35: Douce, Dance of Death, p. 141.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-36: “The identification of William Benting,” says Mr.\r\n    Douce with exquisite bon-hommie, “must be left to the sagacity of\r\n    others. He _could not have been_ the Earl of Portland created in\r\n    1689, or he would have been addressed accordingly. He is,\r\n    moreover, described as a youth born at Whitehall, and then\r\n    residing there, and whose dwelling consisted of nearly the whole\r\n    of the palace that remained after the fire.”--Dance of Death,\r\n    p. 244. It appears that these addresses of Piccard were written in\r\n    a foreign language, though, whether Dutch, French, German, or\r\n    Latin, Mr. Douce most unaccountably neglects to say: he merely\r\n    mentions that his extracts are translated.]\r\n\r\nT. Nieuhoff Piccard’s express testimony of Holbein having painted a\r\nDance of Death in fresco, at Whitehall, is, in Mr. Douce’s opinion,\r\nfurther corroborated by the following circumstances: 1. “In one of\r\nVanderdort’s manuscript catalogues of the pictures and rarities\r\ntransported from St. James’s to Whitehall, and placed there in the newly\r\nerected cabinet room of Charles I, and in which several works by Holbein\r\nare mentioned, there is the following article: ‘A little piece, where\r\nDeath with a green garland about his head, stretching both his arms to\r\napprehend a Pilate in the habit of one of the spiritual Prince-Electors\r\nof Germany. Copied by Isaac Oliver from Holbein.’ There cannot be a\r\ndoubt that this refers to the subject of the Elector as painted by\r\nHolbein in the Dance of Death at Whitehall, proving at the same time the\r\nidentity of the painting with the wood-cuts, whatever may be the\r\ninference. 2. Sandrart, after noticing a remarkable portrait of Henry\r\nVIII. at Whitehall, states ‘that there yet remains at that palace\r\n_another work_, by Holbein, that constitutes him the Apelles of his\r\ntime.’ This is certainly _very like an allusion_ to a Dance of Death.\r\n3. It is _by no means improbable_ that Matthew Prior may have alluded to\r\nHolbein’s painting at Whitehall, as it is not likely that he would be\r\nacquainted with any other.\r\n\r\n  ‘Our term of life depends not on our deed,\r\n  Before our birth our funeral was decreed;\r\n  Nor aw’d by foresight, nor misled by chance,\r\n  Imperious Death directs the ebon lance,\r\n  Peoples great Henry’s tombs, and leads up Holbein’s Dance.’\r\n\r\n  _Prior, Ode to the Memory of George Villiers._”[VI-37]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-37: Douce’s Dance of Death, pp. 144, 145.]\r\n\r\nMr. Douce having previously _proved_ that Holbein was _not_ the designer\r\nof the cuts in the Lyons Dance of Death, thus, in a manner _equally\r\nsatisfactory_, accounts for the verses of Bourbon, by showing, on the\r\n_unexceptionable_ evidence of “a person, calling himself T. Nieuhoff\r\nPiccard, _probably_ belonging to the household of William III,” that the\r\ngreat work of Holbein--by the fame of which he had made himself equal\r\nwith the immortal gods--was painted as large as life, in fresco, on the\r\nwalls of Whitehall. The ingenuity displayed in depriving Holbein of the\r\nhonour of the Lyons cuts is no less exemplified in proving him to be the\r\npainter of a similar subject in Whitehall. The key-stone is worthy of\r\nthe arch.\r\n\r\nThough the _facts_ and _arguments_ put forth by Mr. Douce, in proof of\r\nHolbein having painted a Dance of Death on the walls of the old palace\r\nof Whitehall, and of this having been the identical Dance of Death\r\nalluded to by Bourbon, might be summarily dismissed as being of that\r\nkind which no objection could render more absurd, yet it seems necessary\r\nto direct the especial attention of the reader to one or two points; and\r\nfirst to the assertion that “it is next to impossible that the Lyons\r\nDance of Death of 1538 could then have been in Borbonius’s\r\ncontemplation.” Now, in direct opposition to what is here said, it\r\nappears to me highly probable that _this_ was the very work on account\r\nof which he addressed his epigram to Holbein; and it is moreover evident\r\nthat Bourbon expresses in Latin verse almost precisely the same ideas as\r\nthose which had previously been expressed in French by the writer of the\r\naddress to Madame Jehanne de Touszele, when speaking of the merits of\r\nthe nameless artist who is there alluded to as the designer or engraver\r\nof the cuts.[VI-38] As Holbein is not certainly known to be the painter\r\nor designer of any other Dance of Death which might merit the high\r\npraise conveyed in Bourbon’s verses, to what other work of his will they\r\napply? Even supposing, as I do, that the alphabet of the Dance of Death\r\nwas designed by Holbein, I conceive it “next to impossible,” to use the\r\nwords of Mr. Douce, that Bourbon should have described Holbein as having\r\nattained immortality through the fame of those twenty-four small\r\nletters, a perfect set of which I believe is not to be found in any\r\nsingle volume. That Bourbon _did_ know who was the designer of the cuts\r\nof the Lyons Dance of Death there can scarcely be the shadow of a doubt;\r\nhe was at Lyons in the year in which the work was published; he was\r\nconnected with the printers; and another work, the Icones Historiarum\r\nVeteris Testamenti, also published by them in 1538, has at the\r\ncommencement a copy of verses written by Bourbon, from which alone we\r\nlearn that Holbein was the designer of the cuts,--the first four of\r\nwhich cuts, be it observed, being from the same blocks as the first four\r\nin the Dance of Death, published by the same printers, in the same year.\r\nWhat might be the motives of the printers for not inserting Bourbon’s\r\nepigram in praise of Holbein in the subsequent editions of the Dance of\r\nDeath, supposing him to be the designer of the cuts, I cannot tell, nor\r\nwill I venture to _guess_. They certainly must have had some reason for\r\nconcealing the designer’s name, for the writer of the prefatory address\r\nto Madame Jehanne de Touszele takes care not to mention it even when\r\nspeaking in so laudatory a style of the excellence of the designs. Among\r\nthe other unaccountable things connected with this work, I may mention\r\nthe fact of the French prefatory address to the abbess of St. Peter’s\r\nappearing only in the first, and being omitted in every subsequent\r\nedition.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-38: That the reader may judge for himself of the\r\n    similarity of thought in the passages referred to, they are here\r\n    given in juxta-position.\r\n\r\n    “Car ses histoires funebres, avec leurs descriptions severement\r\n    rithmées, aux advisans donnent telle admiration, qu’ilz en _jugent\r\n    les mortz y apparoistre tresvivement_, et les vifs tresmortement\r\n    representer. Qui me faict penser, que la Mort craignant que ce\r\n    excellent painctre ne la paignist tant vifve qu’elle ne fut plus\r\n    crainte pour Mort, _et que pour cela luy mesme n’en devint\r\n    immortel_, que a ceste cause,” &c.--_Epistre des Faces de la\r\n    Mort._\r\n\r\n      “Dum mortis Hansus pictor imaginem exprimit,\r\n      Tanta arte mortem retulit, ut mors vivere\r\n      Videatur ipsa: et ipse se immortalibus\r\n      Parem Diis fecerit, operis hujus gloria.”\r\n              _Borbonius._]\r\n\r\nWith respect to T. Nieuhoff Piccard, whose manuscript addresses to\r\n“Mynheer Heymans” and “Lord William Benting” are cited to _prove_ that\r\nBourbon’s verses must relate to a painting of the Dance of Death by\r\nHolbein in the old palace of Whitehall, nothing whatever is known; and\r\nthere is not the slightest reason to believe that a Lord William\r\nBenting, born in the old palace of Whitehall, “Lord of Rhoon,\r\nPendraght,” &c. ever existed. I am of opinion that the addresses of the\r\nperson calling himself T. Nieuhoff Piccard are a clumsy attempt at\r\nimposition.[VI-39] Though Mr. Douce had seen both those addresses, and\r\nalso another of the same kind, he does not appear to have made any\r\nattempt to trace their former owners, nor does he mention the names of\r\nthe parties in whose possession they were at the time that he saw them.\r\nHe had seen the address to “Lord William Benting” previous to the\r\npublication of his observations on the Dance of Death in 1794, when, if\r\nhe had felt inclined, he might have ascertained from whom the then\r\npossessor had received it, and thus obtained a clue to guide him in his\r\ninquiries respecting the personal identity of the Lord of Rhoon and\r\nPendraght. But this would not have suited his purpose; for he seems to\r\nhave been conscious that any inquiry respecting such a person would only\r\nhave tended to confirm the doubts respecting the paper addressed to him\r\nby Piccard. It is also uncertain at what time those pretended addresses\r\nwere written, but there are impressions of the etchings which\r\naccompanied them with the date 1720; and I am inclined to think that if\r\nthe paper and handwriting were closely examined, it would be found that\r\nthose pretended presentation addresses were manufactured about the same,\r\nor perhaps at a later period. Whoever the person calling himself\r\nT. Nieuhoff Piccard may have been, or at whatever time the addresses to\r\nMynheer Heymans and others may have been written, the only evidence of\r\nthere having been a painting of the Dance by Holbein at Whitehall rests\r\non his unsupported statement. Such a painting is not mentioned by any\r\nforeign traveller who had visited this country, nor is it noticed by any\r\nEnglish writer prior to 1697; it is not alluded to in any tragedy,\r\ncomedy, farce, or masque, in which we might expect that such a painting\r\nwould have been incidentally mentioned had it ever existed. Evelyn, who\r\nmust have frequently been in the old palace of Whitehall, says not a\r\nword of such a painting, though he mentions the Lyons Dance of Death\r\nunder the title of Mortis Imago, and ascribes the cuts to\r\nHolbein;[VI-40] and not the slightest notice of it is to be found in\r\nVertue or Walpole.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-39: Hegner, in his Life of Holbein, speaking of the\r\n    Nieuhoff discovery, says: “Of this fable no notice would have been\r\n    taken here had not Mr. Douce ascribed undeserved authority to it,\r\n    and had not his superficial investigations found undeserved credit\r\n    with English and other compilers.” Hans Holbein der Jüngere,\r\n    S. 338.\r\n\r\n    Mr. Douce, at page 240 of his Dance of Death, complains of\r\n    Hegner’s want of urbanity and politeness; and in return calls his\r\n    account of Holbein’s works _superficial_, and moreover says that\r\n    “his arguments, if worthy of the name, are, generally speaking, of\r\n    a most weak and flimsy texture.” He also gives him a sharp rebuff\r\n    by alluding to him as the “above _gentleman_,” the last word, to\r\n    give it point, being printed in Italics. Mr. Douce, when he was\r\n    thus pelting Hegner, does not seem to have been aware that his own\r\n    anti-Holbenian superstructure was a house of glass.\r\n\r\n    “Cedimus, inque vicem dedimus crura sagittis.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-40: Evelyn is only referred to here on account of his\r\n    _silence_ with respect to the pretended painting at Whitehall.\r\n    What he says of Holbein cannot be relied on, as will be seen from\r\n    the following passage, which is a fair specimen of his general\r\n    knowledge and accuracy. “We have seen some few things cut in wood\r\n    by the incomparable Hans Holbein the Dane, but they are rare and\r\n    exceedingly difficult to come by; as his _Licentiousness of the\r\n    Friars and Nuns_; _Erasmus_; _The Dance Macchabre_; the _Mortis\r\n    Imago_, which he painted in great in the Church of Basil, and\r\n    afterwards graved with no less art.”--Evelyn’s Sculpture, p. 69.\r\n    Edition 1769.]\r\n\r\nThe learned Conrad Gesner, who was born at Zurich in 1516, and died\r\nthere in 1565, expressly ascribes the Lyons Dance of Death to\r\nHolbein;[VI-41] and, notwithstanding the contradictory statement in the\r\npreface to the first edition of this work, such appears to have been the\r\ngeneral belief of all the artist’s contemporaries. Van Mander, who was\r\nborn in 1548, and who died in 1606, appears to have been the first\r\nperson who gave any account of the life of Holbein. His work, entitled\r\nHet Schilder Boek, consisting of biographical notices of painters,\r\nchiefly Germans and Flemings, was first published in 1604; and, when\r\nspeaking of Holbein, he mentions the Lyons Dance of Death among his\r\nother works. Sandrart, in common with every other writer on art of the\r\nperiod, also ascribes the Lyons work to Holbein, and he gives the\r\nfollowing account of a conversation that he had with Rubens respecting\r\nthose cuts: “I remember that in the year 1627, when the celebrated\r\nRubens was proceeding to Utrecht to visit Honthorst, I accompanied him\r\nas far as Amsterdam; and during our passage in the boat I looked into\r\nHolbein’s little book of the Dance of Death, the cuts of which Rubens\r\nhighly praised, recommending me, as I was a young man, to copy them,\r\nobserving, that he had copied them himself in his youth.” Sandrart, who\r\nseems to have been one of the earliest writers who supposed that Durer,\r\nCranach, and others engraved their own designs, without any just grounds\r\ndescribes Holbein as a wood engraver. Patin, in his edition of the\r\n“Stultitiæ Laus” of Erasmus, 1676, repeats the same story; and Papillon\r\nin his decisive manner clenches it by asserting that “most of the\r\ndelicate wood-cuts and ornamental letters which are to be found in books\r\nprinted at Basle, Zurich, and towns in Switzerland, at Lyons, London,\r\n&c. from 1520 to about 1540, were engraved by Holbein himself.” Papillon\r\nalso says that it is believed--_on croit_--that Holbein began to engrave\r\nin 1511, when he was about sixteen. “What is extraordinary in this\r\npainter,” he further adds, “is, that he painted and engraved with the\r\nleft hand, so that he consequently engraved the lines on the wood from\r\nright to left, instead of, as with us, engraving from left to\r\nright.”[VI-42] Jansen, and a host of other compilers, without inquiry,\r\nrepeat the story of Holbein having been a wood engraver, and that the\r\ncuts of the Lyons Dance of Death were engraved by himself. That he was\r\nthe designer of those cuts I am thoroughly convinced, though I consider\r\nit “next to impossible” that he should have been also the engraver.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-41: “Imagines Mortis expressæ ab optimo pictore\r\n    Johanne Holbein cum epigrammatibus Georgii Æmylii, excusæ\r\n    Francofurti et Lugduni apud Frellonios, quorum editio plures habet\r\n    picturas. Vidi etiam cum metris Gallicis et Germanicis, si bene\r\n    memini.” Mr. Douce cites this passage from Gesner’s Pandectæ,\r\n    “a supplemental volume of great rarity to his well-known\r\n    Bibliotheca.” The correct title of the volume in which it occurs\r\n    is “Partitiones Theologicæ, Pandectarum Universalium Conradi\r\n    Gesneri Liber Ultimus.” Folio, printed by Christopher Froschover,\r\n    Zurich (Tiguri) 1549. The notice of the Dance of Death is in folio\r\n    86, _a_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-42: Traité de la Gravure en Bois, tom. i. p. 165. Van\r\n    Mander asserts that Holbein painted with his left hand; but Horace\r\n    Walpole, however, in opposition to this, refers to a portrait of\r\n    Holbein, formerly in the Arundelian collection, where he appears\r\n    holding the pencil in his _right_ hand.]\r\n\r\nHolbein’s Bible Cuts, as they are usually called, were first published\r\nat Lyons, in 1538, the same year, and by the same printers, as the Dance\r\nof Death. The book is a small quarto, and the title is as follows:\r\n“Historiarum Veteris Testamenti Icones ad vivum expressæ. Una cum brevi,\r\nsed quoad fieri potuit, dilucida earundem et Latina et Gallica\r\nexpositione. Lugduni sub scuto Coloniensi. M.D.XXXVIII.”[VI-43] On the\r\ntitle-page is an emblematic cut, with the motto _Usus me genuit_,\r\nsimilar to that on the title-page in the first edition of the Dance of\r\nDeath, but not precisely the same; and at the end is the imprint of the\r\nbrothers Melchior and Caspar Trechsel within an ornamental border, as in\r\nthe latter work. I am greatly inclined to think that the brothers were\r\nonly the printers of the first editions of the Dance of Death and the\r\nBible cuts, and that the real proprietors were John and Francis Frellon,\r\nwhose names appear as the publishers in subsequent editions.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-43: A copy of this edition is preserved in the Public\r\n    Library at Basle, and there is another copy in the Royal\r\n    Collection at Dresden. Another edition, in every respect similar\r\n    to the first, was also printed by the brothers Trechsel in 1539.\r\n    Hegner, in his Life of Holbein, does not seem to have known of\r\n    this edition; speaking of that of 1538, he says, “It is probably\r\n    the same as that to which Papillon gives the date 1539.” There is\r\n    a copy of the edition of 1539 in the British Museum.]\r\n\r\nThis opinion seems to be corroborated by the fact of there being an\r\naddress from “_Franciscus Frellaeus_” to the Christian Reader in the\r\nBible cuts of 1538 and 1539, which in subsequent editions is altered to\r\n“Franciscus _Frellonius_.” That the same person is designated by those\r\nnames, I think there can be little doubt, as the addresses are literally\r\nthe same. From adopting the form “Frellaeus,” however, in the editions\r\nof 1538 and 1539, it would seem that the writer was not wishful to\r\ndiscover his name. When the work becomes popular he writes it\r\nFrellonius; and in the second edition of the Dance of Death, when the\r\ncharacter of this work is also established, and there seems no longer\r\nreason to apprehend the censures of the church of Rome, we find the\r\nnames of John and Francis Frellon on the title-page under the “shield of\r\nCologne.” Whatever might be their motives, it seems certain that the\r\nfirst publishers of the Dance of Death were wishful to withhold their\r\nnames; and it is likely that the designer of the cuts might have equally\r\ngood reasons for concealment. Had the Roman Catholic party considered\r\nthe cuts of the Pope, the Nun, and two or three others as the covert\r\nsatire of a _reformed_ painter, the publishers and the designer would\r\nhave been as likely to incur danger as to reap profit or fame.\r\n\r\nThe address of Franciscus Frellaeus is followed by a copy of Latin\r\nverses by Nicholas Bourbon, in which Holbein is mentioned as the\r\ndesigner; and immediately preceding the cuts is an address “aux\r\nlecteurs,” in French verse, by Gilles Corrozet, who, perhaps, might be\r\nthe poet that supplied the French expositions of those cuts, and the\r\n“descriptions severement rithmées” of the Dance of Death. The following\r\nis an extract from Bourbon’s prefatory verses, the whole of which it\r\nappears unnecessary to give.\r\n\r\n  “Nuper in Elysio cum fortè erraret Apelles\r\n    Una aderat Zeuxis, Parrhasiusque comes.\r\n  Hi duo multa satis fundebant verba; sed ille\r\n    Interea mœrens et taciturnus erat.\r\n  Mirantur comites, farique hortantur et urgent:\r\n    Suspirans imo pectore, Coûs ait:\r\n  O famæ ignari, superis quæ nuper ab oris\r\n    (Vana utinam!) Stygias venit ad usque domos:\r\n  Scilicet, esse hodie quendam ex mortalibus unum\r\n    Ostendat qui me vosque fuisse nihil:\r\n  Qui nos declaret pictores nomine tantum,\r\n    Picturæque omneis ante fuisse rudes.\r\n  Holbius est homini nomen, qui nomina nostra\r\n    Obscura ex claris ac prope nulla facit.\r\n  Talis apud manes querimonia fertur: et illos\r\n    Sic equidem merito censeo posse queri,\r\n  Nam tabulam siquis videat, quam pinxerit Hansus\r\n    Holbius, ille artis gloria prima suæ,\r\n  Protinus exclamet, Potuit Deus edere monstrum\r\n    Quod video? humanæ non potuere manus.\r\n  Icones hæ sacræ tanti sunt, optime lector,\r\n    Artificis, dignum quod venereris opus.”\r\n\r\nBesides those verses there is also a Greek distich by Bourbon, to which\r\nthe following translation “pene ad verbum” is appended:\r\n\r\n  “Cernere vis, hospes, simulacra simillima vivis?\r\n  Hoc opus Holbinæ nobile cerne manus.”\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Douce stated that it was “_extremely probable_ that the\r\nanonymous painter or designer of the Dance might have been employed also\r\nby the Frellons to execute a set of subjects for the Bible previously to\r\nhis death, and that Holbein was afterwards employed to complete the\r\nwork,” he seems to have forgot that such a testimony of Holbein being\r\nthe designer was prefixed to the Bible cuts. In answer to Mr. Douce it\r\nmay be asked, in his own style, if the Frellons knew that another artist\r\nwas the designer of the cuts of the Dance of Death, and if he also had\r\nbeen originally employed to design the Bible cuts, how does it happen\r\nthat they should allow Bourbon to give all the honour of the latter to\r\nHolbein, who, if the Dance of Death be not his, was certainly much\r\ninferior as a designer to the nameless artist whose unfinished work he\r\nwas employed to complete?\r\n\r\nThe total number of the Bible cuts in the first edition of the work is\r\nninety, the first four of which are the same as the first four of the\r\nDance of Death; the other eighty-six are of a different form to the\r\nfirst four, as will be perceived from the specimens, which are of the\r\nsame size as the originals. Those eighty-six cuts are generally much\r\ninferior in design to those of the Dance of Death, and the style in\r\nwhich they are engraved is very unequal, some of them being executed\r\nwith considerable neatness and delicacy, and others in a much coarser\r\nmanner. The following cut, Abraham about to sacrifice Isaac, Genesis\r\nXXII, is one of those which are the best engraved; but even these, so\r\nfar as regards the expression of the features and the delicate marking\r\nof the hands, are generally much inferior to the cuts of the Dance of\r\nDeath.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThough most of the Bible cuts are inferior both in design and execution\r\nto those of the Dance of Death, and though several of them are rudely\r\ndrawn and badly engraved, yet many of them afford points of such perfect\r\nidentity with those of the Dance of Death, that it seems impossible to\r\ncome to any other conclusion than that either the cuts of both works\r\nhave been designed by the same person, or that the designer of the one\r\nseries has servilely copied from the designer of the other, and, what is\r\nmost singular, in many trifling details which seem the least likely to\r\nbe imitated, and which usually constitute individual peculiarities of\r\nstyle. For instance, the small shrubby tree in the preceding cut is\r\nprecisely of the same species as that seen in the cut of the Old Woman\r\nin the Dance of Death; and the angel about to stay Abraham’s hand bears\r\na strong general resemblance to the angel in Adam and Eve driven out of\r\nParadise.\r\n\r\nThe cut on the opposite page--the Fool, Psalm LIII--is copied from one\r\nof those executed in a coarser style than the preceding. The children in\r\nthis cut are evidently of the same family as those of the Dance of\r\nDeath.\r\n\r\nIn the first cut, the Creation, a crack is perceived running nearly down\r\nthe middle from top to bottom, in the edition of the Dance of Death of\r\n1545. It is also perceptible in all the subsequent Lyons editions of\r\nthis work and of the Bible cuts. It is, however, less obvious in the\r\nBible cuts of the edition 1549 than in some of the preceding, probably\r\nin consequence of the block having been cramped to remedy the defect.\r\nMr. Douce speaks, at page 105, as if the crack were not discernible in\r\nthe Bible cuts of 1549; it is, however, quite perceptible in every copy\r\nthat has come under my notice. Some of the latter editions of this work\r\ncontain four additional cuts, which are all coarsely executed. In the\r\nedition of 1547 they form the illustrations to Ezekiel XL; Ezekiel\r\nXLIII; Jonah I, II, and III; and Habakkuk. The Bible cuts were also\r\nprinted with explanations in English. The title of a copy now before me\r\nis as follows: “The Images of the Old Testament, lately expressed, set\r\nforthe in Ynglishe and Frenche vuith a playn and brief exposition.\r\nPrinted at Lyons by Johan Frellon, the yere of our Lord God, 1549,” 4to.\r\nIn the latter editions there are wood-cuts of the four Evangelists, each\r\nwithin an oval border, on the last leaf. They bear no tokens of\r\nHolbein’s style.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nAmong the many instances of resemblance which are to be perceived on\r\ncomparing the Dance of Death with the Bible cuts, the following may be\r\nenumerated as the most remarkable. The peculiar manner in which fire\r\nwith smoke, and the waves of the sea, are represented in the Dance of\r\nDeath can scarcely fail to strike the most heedless observer; for\r\ninstance, the fire in the cut of Death seizing the child, and the waves\r\nin the cut of the Seaman. In the Bible cuts we perceive the same\r\npeculiarity; there is the same kind of fire in Moses directing the\r\nmanner of burnt offerings, Leviticus I; in the burning of Nadab and\r\nAbihu, Leviticus X; and in every other one of those cuts where fire is\r\nseen. In the destruction of Pharaoh and his host, Exodus XIV, are the\r\nsame kind of curling waves. Except in the Dance of Death and the Bible\r\ncuts, I have never seen an instance of fire or water represented in such\r\na manner. If those cuts were designed by two different artists, it is\r\ncertainly singular that in this respect they should display so perfect a\r\ncoincidence of idea. The sheep in the cut of the Bishop in the Dance of\r\nDeath are the same as those in the Bible cut of Moses seeing God in the\r\nburning bush, Exodus III; and the female figure in the cut of the\r\nElector in the former work is perceived in the Bible cut of the captive\r\nMidianites, Numbers XXXI. The children introduced in both works are\r\nalmost perfectly identical, as will be perceived on comparing the cut of\r\nLittle Children mocking Elijah, chapter II, Kings II, with those of the\r\nElector, and Death seizing the child, in the Dance of Death. The face of\r\nthe Duchess in the latter work is the same as that of Esther in the\r\nBible cut, Esther, chapter II; and in this cut ornaments on the\r\ntapestry, like fleurs-de-lis, behind the throne of Ahasuerus, are the\r\nsame as those on the tapestry behind the King in the Dance of Death. The\r\nlatter coincidence has been noticed by Mr. Douce, who, in direct\r\nopposition to the evidence of the German or Swiss costume of the living\r\ncharacters of the Dance of Death, considers it as contributing to\r\ndemonstrate that both the series of those cuts are of Gallic\r\norigin.[VI-44] It is needless to enumerate more instances of almost\r\ncomplete identity of figures and details in the cuts of the Dance of\r\nDeath and those of the Bible illustrations; they are too frequent to\r\nhave originated from a conventional mode of representing certain objects\r\nand persons; and they are most striking in minor details, where one\r\nartist would be least likely to imitate another, but where the same\r\nindividual designer would be most likely to repeat himself. “As to the\r\ndesigns of these truly elegant prints,” says Mr. Douce, speaking of the\r\ncuts of the Dance of Death, “no one who is at all skilled in the\r\nknowledge of Holbein’s style and manner of grouping his figures would\r\nhesitate immediately to ascribe them to that artist.”[VI-45] As this\r\nopinion is corroborated by a comparison of the Dance of Death with the\r\nBible cuts, and as the internal evidence of the cuts of the Dance of\r\nDeath in favour of Holbein is confirmed by the testimony of his\r\ncontemporaries, the reader can decide for himself how far Holbein’s\r\npositive claims to the honour of this work ought to be affected by the\r\npassage in the anonymous address to Madame Jehanne de Touszele, which\r\nforms the groundwork of Mr. Douce’s theory.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-44: “A comparison of the 8th subject of the\r\n    Simulachres,” says Mr. Douce, “with that of the Bible for Esther\r\n    I, II, where the canopy ornamented with fleurs-de-lis is the same\r\n    in both, will contribute to strengthen the above conjecture, as\r\n    will both the cuts to demonstrate their Gallic origin. It is most\r\n    certain that the King sitting at table in the Simulachres is\r\n    intended for Francis I, which if any one should doubt, let him\r\n    look upon the miniature of that king, copied at p. 214, in\r\n    Clarke’s ‘Repertorium Bibliographicum.’” The “above conjecture”\r\n    referred to in this extract is that previously cited at page 367,\r\n    where Mr. Douce conjectures that Holbein _might have been_\r\n    employed to complete the Bible cuts which _might have been_ left\r\n    unfinished in consequence of the death of Mr. Douce’s “great\r\n    unknown” designer of the Dance of Death.--Dance of Death, p. 96.\r\n    Mr. Douce, not being able to deny the similarity of many of the\r\n    cuts, says it is highly probable that Holbein was merely employed\r\n    to finish the Bible cuts, without ever considering that it is\r\n    _primâ facie_ much more probable that Holbein was the designer of\r\n    the cuts in both works.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-45: Dance of Death, p. 82.]\r\n\r\nHaving now examined the principal arguments which have been alleged to\r\nshow that Holbein _was not_ the designer of the Dance of Death, and\r\nhaving endeavoured to justify his claims to that honour by producing the\r\nevidences on which they rest, I shall now take leave of this subject,\r\nfeeling thoroughly assured that HOLBEIN WAS THE DESIGNER OF THE CUTS OF\r\nTHE FIRST EDITION OF THE LYONS DANCE OF DEATH; and trusting, though with\r\nno overweening confidence, that the preceding investigation will render\r\nit necessary for the next questioner of his title to produce stronger\r\nobjections than the solitary ambiguous passage in the preface to the\r\nfirst edition of the work, and to support them with more forcible and\r\nconsistent arguments than have been put forth by Mr. Douce. M. T.\r\nNieuhoff Piccard, I am inclined to think, will never again be called as\r\na witness in this cause; and before the passage in the preface can be\r\nallowed to have any weight, it must be shown that such a personage as\r\nMadame Jehanne de Touszele _was_ prioress of the convent of St. Peter at\r\nLyons at the time of the first publication of the work: and even should\r\nsuch a fact be established, the ambiguity of the passage--whether the\r\npretendedly deceased artist were the engraver or designer, or both,--and\r\nthe obvious desire to conceal his name, remain to be explained.\r\n\r\nIn 1538, the year in which the Dance of Death and the Bible cuts were\r\nfirst published at Lyons, Holbein was residing in England under the\r\npatronage of Henry VIII; though it is also certain that about the\r\nbeginning of September in that year he returned to Basle and he remained\r\nthere a few weeks.[VI-46]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-46: “Venit nuper Basileam ex Anglia Ioannes Holbein,\r\n    adeo felicem ejus regni statum prædicans, qui aliquot septimanis\r\n    exactis rursum eo migraturus est.” From a letter written by\r\n    Rudolph Gualter to Henry Bullinger, of Zurich, about the middle of\r\n    September 1538.--Quoted by Hegner, S. 246.]\r\n\r\nAs the productions of this distinguished painter occupy so large a\r\nportion of this chapter, it perhaps may not be unnecessary to give here\r\na few particulars of his life, chiefly derived from Hegner’s work,\r\nprevious to his coming to England. Hans Holbein, the Younger, as he is\r\noften called by German writers to distinguish him from his father, was\r\nthe son of Hans Holbein, a painter of considerable reputation. The year\r\nand place of his birth have not been positively ascertained, but there\r\nseems reason to believe that he was born in 1498, at Augsburg,[VI-47] of\r\nwhich city his father was a burgher, and from whence he appears to have\r\nremoved with his family to Basle, about the end of the fifteenth or the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century. Young Holbein was brought up to his\r\nfather’s profession, and at an early age displayed the germ of his\r\nfuture excellence. There is a portrait in oil by young Holbein of the\r\ndate of 1513, which, according to Hegner, though rather weak in colour\r\nand somewhat hard in outline, is yet clearly and delicately painted.\r\nFrom the excellence of his early productions, Patin, in his Life of\r\nHolbein, prefixed to an edition of the Laus Stultitiæ of Erasmus[VI-48]\r\nthinks that he must have been born in 1495. That he was born in 1498\r\nthere can, however, be little doubt, for Hegner mentions a portrait of\r\nhim, at Basle, when in the forty-fifth year of his age, with the date\r\n1543. Several anecdotes are told of Holbein as a jolly fellow, and of\r\nhis twice or thrice discharging his account at a tavern by painting a\r\nDance of Peasants. Though there seems reason to believe that Holbein was\r\na free liver, and that he did paint such a subject in a house at Basle,\r\nthe stories of his thus settling for his liquor are highly improbable.\r\nHe appears to have married young, for in a painting of his wife and two\r\nchildren, executed before he left Basle for England in 1526, the eldest\r\nchild, a boy, appears to be between four and five years old.[VI-49]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-47: Dr. Dibdin, in his Bibliographical Tour vol. iii.\r\n    pp. 80, 81, Edit. 1829, mentions two paintings at Augsburg by the\r\n    elder Holbein, one dated 1499 and the other 1501. The elder\r\n    Holbein had a brother named Sigismund, who was also a painter, and\r\n    who appears to have established himself at Berne. Papillon, in his\r\n    usual manner, makes Sigismund Holbein a wood engraver. By his\r\n    will, dated 1540, he appoints his nephew Hans the heir of all his\r\n    property in Berne.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-48: Patin’s edition of this work was published in\r\n    octavo, at Basle, in 1676. It contains eighty-three copper-plate\r\n    engravings, from pen-and-ink sketches, drawn by Holbein, in the\r\n    margin of a copy of an edition printed by Frobenius, in 1514, and\r\n    still preserved (1860) in the Public Library at Basle. It is said\r\n    that Erasmus, when looking over those sketches, exclaimed, when he\r\n    came to that intended for himself, “Oho, if Erasmus were now as he\r\n    appears here, he would certainly take a wife.” Above another of\r\n    the sketches, representing a man with one of his arms about a\r\n    woman’s neck, and at the same time drinking out of a bottle,\r\n    Erasmus is said to have written the name “_Holbein._” In an\r\n    edition of the Laus Stultitiæ, edited by G. G. Becker, Basle,\r\n    1780, 8vo. those sketches are engraved (very indifferently) on\r\n    wood.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-49: Hegner, Hans Holbein der Jüngere, S. 110.]\r\n\r\nThe name of Holbein’s wife is unknown; but it is said that, like\r\nDurer’s, she was of an unhappy temper, and that he enjoyed no peace with\r\nher. It is not, however, unlikely that his own unsettled disposition and\r\nstraitened circumstances also contributed to render his home\r\nuncomfortable. Like most other artists of that period, he appears to\r\nhave frequently travelled; but his journeys do not seem to have extended\r\nbeyond Switzerland and Suabia, and they were for the most part confined\r\nto the former country. He seems to have travelled rather in search of\r\nemployment than to improve himself by studying the works of other\r\nmasters. Perhaps of all the eminent painters of that period there is no\r\none whose style is more original than Holbein’s, nor one who owes less\r\nto the study of the works of his contemporaries or predecessors. Though\r\nthere can be no doubt of his talents being highly appreciated by his\r\nfellow-townsmen, yet his profession during his residence at Basle\r\nappears to have afforded him but a scanty income. The number of works\r\nexecuted by him between 1517 and 1526 sufficiently testify that he was\r\nnot deficient in industry, and the exercise of his art seems to have\r\nbeen sufficiently varied:--he painted portraits and historical subjects;\r\ndecorated the interior walls of houses, according to the fashion of that\r\nperiod, with fanciful and historical compositions; and made designs for\r\ngoldsmiths and wood-engravers. It is said that so early as 1520, the\r\nEarl of Arundel,[VI-50] an English nobleman, having seen some of his\r\nworks in passing through Basle, advised him to try his fortune in\r\nEngland. If such advice were given to Holbein at that period, it is\r\ncertain that it was not adopted until several years after, for he did\r\nnot visit this country till 1526.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-50: It is conjectured by Walpole that this might be\r\n    Henry Fitz-Alan, Earl of Arundel.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE SHEATH OF A DAGGER, INTENDED AS A DESIGN FOR\r\n  A CHASER.[VI-51]]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-51: It is impossible to exceed the beauty and skill\r\n    that are manifested in this fine piece of art. The figures are,\r\n    a king, queen, and a warrior; a young woman, a monk, and an\r\n    infant; all of whom most unwillingly accompany Death in the Dance.\r\n    The despair of the king, the dejection of the queen, accompanied\r\n    by her little dog, the terror of the soldier who hears the drum of\r\n    Death, the struggling of the female, the reluctance of the monk,\r\n    and the sorrow of the poor infant, are depicted with equal spirit\r\n    and veracity. The original drawing is in the public library at\r\n    Basle, and ascribed to Holbein.]\r\n\r\nBefore he left Basle he had painted two or three portraits of Erasmus,\r\nand there is a large wood-cut of that distinguished scholar which is\r\nsaid not only to have been painted, but also engraved by Holbein. This\r\ncut is of folio size, and the figure of Erasmus is a whole length. His\r\nright arm rests upon a terminus, and from a richly ornamented arch is\r\nsuspended a tablet, with the inscription, ER. ROT. Some old impressions\r\nhave two verses printed underneath, which merely praise the likeness\r\nwithout alluding to the painter, while others have four which contain a\r\ncompliment to the genius of Erasmus and to the art of Holbein.[VI-52]\r\nThe original block is still preserved in the Public Library at Basle;\r\nbut there is not the slightest reason for believing that it was engraved\r\nby Holbein. In 1526 Holbein left Basle for England: Patin says, because\r\nhe could no longer bear to live with his imperious wife. Though this\r\nmight not be the chief cause, it is easy to conceive that a person of\r\nHolbein’s character would feel but little regret at parting from such a\r\nhelpmate. Van Mander says that he took with him a portrait which he had\r\npainted of Erasmus, with a letter of recommendation from the latter to\r\nSir Thomas More, wherein it was observed that this portrait ‘was much\r\nmore like him than any of Albert Durer’s.’ Hegner, however, thinks that\r\nwhat Van Mander says about the contents of this letter is not correct,\r\nas no such passage is to be found in the published correspondence of\r\nErasmus with Sir Thomas More. Erasmus had already sent two portraits of\r\nhimself to England;[VI-53] and as Sir Thomas More was personally\r\nacquainted with him, Hegner is of opinion that it would be unnecessary\r\nto mention that the portrait was a better likeness than any of those\r\npainted by Albert Durer. It is, however, by no means unlikely that\r\nErasmus in speaking of a portrait of himself by Holbein--whether\r\nforwarded by the latter or not--might give his own opinion of it in\r\ncomparison with one from the pencil of Durer.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-52: The verses underneath the impressions which are\r\n    supposed to be the earliest, are as follows:\r\n\r\n      “Corporis effigiem si quis non vidit Erasmi,\r\n        Hunc scite ad vivum picta tabella dabit.”\r\n\r\n    The others:\r\n\r\n      “Pallas Apellæam nuper mirata tabellam,\r\n        Hanc, ait, æternum Bibliotheca colat.\r\n      Dædaleam monstrat musis Holbeinnius artem,\r\n        Et summi ingenii Magnus Erasmus opes.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-53: Erasmus, writing to Bilibald Pirkheimer, in 1524,\r\n    says, “Rursus nuper misi in Angliam Erasmum bis pictum ab artifice\r\n    satis eleganti.” Hegner thinks that this artist was Holbein. In\r\n    1517 a portrait of Erasmus, with that of his friend Petrus\r\n    Aegidius, was painted at Antwerp by Quintin Matsys. It was\r\n    intended by Erasmus as a present to Sir Thomas More. This painting\r\n    came subsequently into the possession of Dr. Mead, at whose sale\r\n    it was purchased, as the production of Holbein, by Lord Radnor,\r\n    for £110.]\r\n\r\nIt would appear that in 1525 Erasmus had already mentioned Holbein’s\r\ndesire of trying his fortune in England to Sir Thomas More, for in a\r\nletter written by Sir Thomas to Erasmus, dated from the court at\r\nGreenwich, 18th of December 1525, there is a passage to the following\r\neffect: “Your painter, dear Erasmus, is an excellent artist, but I am\r\napprehensive that he will not find England so fruitful and fertile as he\r\nmay expect. I will, however, do all that I can in order that he may not\r\nfind it entirely barren.”[VI-54] From a letter, dated 29th of August\r\n1526, written by Erasmus to his friend Petrus Aegidius at Antwerp, it\r\nseems reasonable to conclude that Holbein left Basle for England about\r\nthe beginning of September. Though Holbein’s name is not expressly\r\nmentioned in this letter, there cannot be a doubt of his being the\r\nartist who is thus introduced to Aegidius: “The bearer of this is he who\r\npainted my portrait. I will not annoy you with his praises, although he\r\nis indeed an excellent artist. Should he wish to see Quintin, and you\r\nnot have leisure to go with him, you can let a servant show him the\r\nhouse. The arts perish here; he proceeds to England to gain a few\r\nangels; if you wish to write [to England] you can send your letters by\r\nhim.”[VI-55] In this extract we discover a trait of the usual prudence\r\nof Erasmus, who, in introducing his humbler friends to persons of power\r\nor influence, seems to have been particularly careful not to give\r\nannoyance from the warmth of his recommendations. How gently, yet\r\nsignificantly, does he hint to Aegidius that the poor painter who brings\r\nthe letter is a person about whom he need give himself no trouble: if he\r\nhas not _leisure_ to introduce him personally to Quintin--that is,\r\nQuintin Matsys--he can send a servant to show him his house. The\r\nsuggestion of the servant was a hint from Erasmus that he did not expect\r\nthe master to go with Holbein himself.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-54: “Pictor tuus, Erasme carissime, mirus est\r\n    artifex, sed vereor ne non sensurus sit Angliam tam fœcundam ac\r\n    fertilem quam sperarat. Quanquam ne reperiat omnino sterilem,\r\n    quoad per me fieri potest, efficiam. Ex aula Grenwici. 18 Dec.\r\n    1525.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-55: “Qui has reddit, est is qui me pinxit.

Hic frigent artes: petit\r\n    Angliam ut corradat aliquot angelatos: per eum poteris quæ voles\r\n    scribere.”--Erasmi Epist.]\r\n\r\nHolbein on his arrival in England appears to have been well received by\r\nSir Thomas More; and it is certain that he resided for some time with\r\nthe learned and witty chancellor in his house at Chelsea. It is indeed\r\nsaid that he continued with him for three years, but Walpole thinks that\r\nthis is very unlikely. Whether he may have resided during the whole of\r\nthe intermediate time with Sir Thomas More or not, there seems reason to\r\nbelieve that Holbein entered the service of Henry VIII. in 1528. About\r\nthe autumn of 1529[VI-56], he paid a short visit to Basle, probably to\r\nsee his family, which he had left in but indifferent circumstances, and\r\nto obtain permission from the magistracy for a further extension of his\r\nleave of absence, for no burgher of the city of Basle was allowed to\r\nenter into the service of a foreign prince without their sanction.\r\nPatin, in his Life of Holbein, says that during his visit he spent most\r\nof his time with his old tavern companions, and that he treated the more\r\nrespectable burghers, who wished to cultivate his friendship, with great\r\ndisrespect. Hegner, however, considers all those accounts which\r\nrepresent Holbein as a man of intemperate habits and dissolute\r\ncharacter, as unworthy of credit; in his opinion it seems impossible\r\nthat he who was a favourite of Henry VIII, and so long an inmate of Sir\r\nThomas More’s house, should have been a dissolute person. M. Hegner\r\nthroughout his work shows a praiseworthy regard for Holbein’s moral\r\ncharacter, but his presumption in this instance is not sufficient to\r\ncounterbalance the unfavourable reports in the opposite scale.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-56: Erasmus, in a letter to Sir Thomas More, written\r\n    from Freyburg in Brisgau, 5th September, 1529, alludes to a\r\n    picture of More and his family which had been brought over by\r\n    Holbein; and Margaret Roper, the eldest daughter of Sir Thomas\r\n    More, writing to Erasmus in the following November, says, that she\r\n    is pleased to hear of the painter’s arrival with the family\r\n    picture,--“utriusque mei parentis nostrumque omnium effigiem\r\n    depictam.” Hegner thinks that those portraits of Sir Thomas More\r\n    and his family was only a drawing in pen-and-ink, which is now in\r\n    the Public Library at Basle. The figures in this drawing are: Sir\r\n    Thomas and his wife, his father, his son, and a young lady, three\r\n    daughters, a servant, and Sir Thomas’s jester. Over and under the\r\n    figures are written the name and age of each. The drawing is free\r\n    and light; and the faces and hands are very distinctly\r\n    expressed.--Hans Holbein der Jüngere, S. 202-235-237. The drawing\r\n    in the Public Library at Basle was probably a sketch of Holbein’s\r\n    large picture of the family of Sir Thomas More.]\r\n\r\nAbout the latter end of 1532, or the beginning of 1533, Holbein again\r\nvisited Basle; and his return appears to have been chiefly influenced by\r\nan order of the magistracy, which was to the following effect: “To\r\nM. Hans Holbein, painter, now in England. We Jacob Meier, burgomaster\r\nand councillor, herewith salute you our beloved Hans Holbein,\r\nfellow-burgher, and give you to understand that it is our desire that\r\nyou return home forthwith. In order that you may live easier at home,\r\nand provide for your wife and child,[VI-57] we are pleased to allow you\r\nthe yearly sum of thirty guilders, until we can obtain for you something\r\nbetter. That you may make your arrangements accordingly, we acquaint you\r\nwith this resolution. Given, Monday, 2nd September 1532.”[VI-58] It is\r\nuncertain how long Holbein remained at Basle on his second visit, but it\r\nwas probably of short duration. Though he obeyed the summons of the\r\nmagistracy to return, he seems to have had sufficient interest to obtain\r\na further extension of his leave of absence. For the third and last time\r\nhe revisited Basle in 1538; and from a licence, signed by the\r\nburgomaster Jacob Meier, dated 16th November in that year, it appears\r\nthat he obtained permission to return to England and remain there for\r\ntwo years longer. In this licence fifty guilders per annum are promised\r\nto Holbein on his return to Basle, and till then the magistrates further\r\nagree to allow his wife forty guilders per annum to be paid quarterly,\r\nand the first quarter’s payment to commence on the eve of St. Lucia next\r\nensuing,--that is, on the 12th of December. As the mention of the\r\nallowance to Holbein’s wife would seem to imply that she was not very\r\nwell provided for by her husband, Hegner attempts to excuse his apparent\r\nneglect by suggesting “that the great sometimes forget to pay, and will\r\nnot bear dunning;” and in illustration of this he refers to the passage\r\nin Albert Durer’s Journal which has been previously given at page 269.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-57: Holbein’s wife and _child_ only, not children,\r\n    are mentioned in this licence. It is not known what became of\r\n    Holbein’s children, as there are no traces of his descendants to\r\n    be found at Basle. Merian, a clergyman of Basle, in a letter to\r\n    Mechel on this subject, in 1779, writes to this effect: “According\r\n    to a pedigree of the Merian family, printed at Regensburg in 1727,\r\n    Christina Syf, daughter of Rodolph Syf and Judith Weissin, and\r\n    grand-daughter of Hans Holbein the unequalled painter, (born\r\n    1597,) was married on the 17th of November 1616 to Frederick\r\n    Merian.” Perhaps it is meant that Judith Weissin was Holbein’s\r\n    grand-daughter: there is evidently an error in the pedigree; and\r\n    if it be wrong in this respect, it is not entitled to much credit\r\n    in another.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-58: Hegner, S. 242.]\r\n\r\nHolbein’s three visits to Basle have been here especially noticed in\r\norder that the reader might judge for himself as to the probability of\r\nhis making the drawings for the Lyons Dance of Death on any of those\r\noccasions. As this work was published in 1538, and as Holbein on his\r\nlast visit appears to have arrived at Basle about the beginning of\r\nSeptember in that year, it is impossible that he should have made the\r\ndrawings then; for if the forty-one cuts were executed by one person--as\r\nfrom the similarity and excellence of the style there seems every reason\r\nto believe--it would require at the least half a year to engrave them,\r\nsupposing that the artist worked as expeditiously as a wood engraver of\r\nmodern times. As it is highly probable that Holbein both made designs\r\nand painted on his former visits, in 1529, and in 1532 or 1533, I think\r\nit most likely that they were made on the latter occasion,--that is,\r\nsupposing them to have been designed on one of those visits. It is,\r\nhowever, just as probable that the designs were made in England, and\r\nforwarded to a wood engraver at Basle.\r\n\r\nOf the various paintings executed by Holbein during his residence in\r\nEngland it is not necessary to give any account here; those who wish for\r\ninformation on this point are referred to Walpole’s Anecdotes of\r\nPainting.[VI-59] Of his life in England there are few particulars. “In\r\nsome household accounts of Henry VIII,” says Mr. Douce, “there are\r\npayments to him in 1538, 1539, 1540, and 1541, on account of his salary,\r\nwhich appears to have been thirty pounds per annum. From this time\r\nlittle more is recorded of him till 1553, when he painted Queen Mary’s\r\nportrait, and shortly afterwards died of the plague in 1554.” Thomas\r\nHoward, Earl of Arundel, the great patron of artists, in the time of\r\nCharles I, was desirous of erecting a monument to the memory of Holbein,\r\nbut gave up the intention as he was unable to discover the place of the\r\nartist’s interment. As Holbein seems to have left no will, and as his\r\ndeath appears to have excited no notice, it is likely that he died poor,\r\nand in comparative obscurity. If his satirical drawings[VI-60] of\r\nChrist’s Passion, ridiculing the Pope and the popish clergy, were known\r\nto Mary, or any of her spiritual advisers, it could not be expected that\r\nhe should find favour at her court.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-59: See Dallaway’s edition, revised by R. N. Wornum.\r\n    London, Bohn, 1849, 3 vols. 8vo. Vol. i. pp. 66 et seq.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-60: Those designs were engraved on sixteen small\r\n    plates by Hollar, but without his name. The enemies of Christ are\r\n    represented in the dress of monks and friars, and instead of\r\n    weapons they bear croziers, large candlesticks, and other church\r\n    ornaments; Judas appears as a capucin, Annas as a cardinal, and\r\n    Caiaphas as a bishop. In the subject of Christ’s Descent to Hades,\r\n    the gates are hung with papal bulls and dispensations; above them\r\n    are the Pope’s arms, and the devil as keeper of the gate wears a\r\n    triple crown. Underneath this engraving are the following verses,\r\n    which are certainly not of the period of Holbein:\r\n\r\n         “Lo! the Pope’s kitchin, where his soles are fried,\r\n         Called Purgatorie; see his pardons tied\r\n         On strings; his triple crown the Divell weares,\r\n         And o’er the door the Pope’s own arms he beares.”\r\n\r\n    In the subject of Christ before Caiaphas is the following\r\n    inscription in German: “_Wer wider die Römischen, der soll\r\n    sterben_,”--that is, “He who is against the Romans shall die.”]\r\n\r\nWood engraving in England during the time of Holbein’s residence in this\r\ncountry appears to have been but little cultivated; but though there\r\ncannot be a doubt that the art was then practised here by native wood\r\nengravers, yet I very much question if it were practised by any person\r\nin England as a distinct profession. It is not unlikely that many of the\r\nwood-cuts which appear in books printed in this country about that\r\nperiod were engraved by the printers themselves. It has indeed been\r\nsupposed that most of the wood-cuts in English books printed at that\r\nperiod were engraved on the continent; but this opinion seems highly\r\nimprobable--there could be no occasion to send abroad to have wood-cuts\r\nso rudely executed. Perhaps the difficulty, or rather the impossibility\r\nof finding a wood engraver in England capable of doing justice to his\r\ndesigns might be one reason why Holbein made so few for the booksellers\r\nof this country during his long residence here. The following portrait\r\nof Sir Thomas Wyatt, the poet, who died in 1541, was probably drawn on\r\nthe block by Holbein. It is given on the reverse of the title of a small\r\nwork in quarto, printed at London, 1542, and entitled “Næniæ in mortem\r\nThomæ Viati equitis incomparabilis. Joanne Lelando antiquario autore.”\r\nThe verses, which are printed underneath the cut, seem decisive of the\r\ndrawing having been made by Holbein. There is a drawing of Sir Thomas\r\nWyatt by Holbein, in the Royal Collection, which is engraved in\r\nChamberlain’s work, entitled “Imitations of Original Drawings by Hans\r\nHolbein,” folio, 1792. There is little similarity between the drawing\r\nand the cut, though on comparison it is evident that both are intended\r\nfor the same person.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  In effigiem Thomæ Viati.\r\n  Holbenus nitida pingendi maximus arte\r\n  Effigiem expressit graphicè: sed nullus Apelles\r\n  Exprimet ingenium felix animumque Viati.]\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed that the original cut, of which the preceding is a\r\nfac-simile, was engraved by Holbein himself: if this were true, and the\r\ncut itself taken as a specimen of his abilities in this department of\r\nart, there could not be a doubt of his having been a very indifferent\r\nwood engraver, for though there be considerable expression of character\r\nin the drawing of the head, the cut is executed in a very inferior style\r\nof art.\r\n\r\nThe cuts in Cranmer’s Catechism, a small octavo, printed in 1548,[VI-61]\r\nhave been ascribed to Holbein; but out of the whole number, twenty-nine,\r\nincluding the cut on the reverse of the title, there are only two which\r\ncontain his mark. In the others the manner of pencilling is so unlike\r\nthat of these two, and the drawing and composition bear so little\r\nresemblance to Holbein’s usual style, that I do not believe them to have\r\nbeen of his designing. In the cut on the reverse of the title, the\r\nsubject is Cranmer presenting the Bible to Edward VI.; the others,\r\ntwenty-eight in number, but containing only twenty-six different\r\nsubjects,--as two of them are repeated,--are illustrative of different\r\npassages of Scripture cited in the work. The following cut is one of\r\nthose designed by Holbein. It occurs at folio CL as an illustration of\r\n“the fyrst sermon. A declaration of the fyrst peticion” [of the Lord’s\r\nPrayer]. Holbein’s initials, H. H.--though the cross stroke of the first\r\nH is broken away--are perceived on the edge of what seems to be a book,\r\nto the left of the figure praying.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-61: The following is the title of this scarce little\r\n    volume. “Catechismus, that is to say, a shorte instruction into\r\n    Christian religion for the singuler commoditie and profyte of\r\n    childrē and yong people. Set forth by the mooste reverende father\r\n    in God, Thomas Archbyshop of Canterbury, primate of all Englande\r\n    and Metropolitane.--Gualterus Lynne excudebat, 1548.” At the end\r\n    of the book, under a cut of Christ with a child before him, is the\r\n    colophon: “Imprynted at London, in S. Jhones Streete, by Nycolas\r\n    Hyll, for Gwalter Lynne dwellyng on Somers kaye, by Byllynges\r\n    gate.” Mr. Douce, at page 96, mentions a cut with the name _Hans\r\n    Holbein_ at the bottom, as occurring in the title-page of “A lytle\r\n    treatise after the manner of an Epystle wryten by the famous clerk\r\n    Doctor Urbanus Regius,” &c. also published by Walter Lynne, 1548.]\r\n\r\nThe other cut, designed by Holbein, and which contains his name at full\r\nlength,[VI-62] occurs at folio CCI. The subject is Christ casting out\r\nDevils, in illustration of the seventh petition of the Lord’s\r\nPrayer,--“Deliver us from evil.” The following is a fac-simile.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  HANS·HOLBEN]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-62: Mr. Douce, in his observations prefixed to\r\n    Hollar’s etchings of the Dance of Death, published by Edwards in\r\n    1794, says, “A _set_ of cuts with the latter mark [_Hans Holben_]\r\n    occurs in Archbishop Cranmer’s Catechism, printed by Walter Lyne,\r\n    in 1548;” and in the same page he commits another mistake by\r\n    describing the mark on the cut of the Duchess in the Lyons Dance\r\n    of Death as [[HB]], instead of [[HL]]. It has been considered\r\n    necessary to notice these errors, as it is probable that many\r\n    persons who possess the work in which they occur, but who never\r\n    may have seen a copy of the Lyons Dance of Death, nor of\r\n    Cranmer’s Catechism, may have been misled in those matters by\r\n    implicitly relying on Mr. Douce’s authority. A certain class of\r\n    compilers are also extremely liable to transmit such mistakes,\r\n    and, to borrow an expression of Hegner’s, to give currency to\r\n    them, as if they stood ready for use “in _stereotype_.”]\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of showing the difference of style between those two\r\ncuts and the others contained in the same work, the three given on the\r\nfollowing page have been selected. The first, illustrating the Creation,\r\noccurs at the folio erroneously numbered CXCV, properly CIX, No. 1; the\r\nsecond, illustrating the sermon of our redemption, at folio CXXI, No. 2;\r\nand the third, illustrating the third petition of the Lord’s\r\nPrayer,--“Thy will be done,”--at folio CLXVIII, No. 3. The following are\r\nthe introductory remarks to the explanation of what the archbishop calls\r\nthe third petition: “Ye have herde how in the former petycions, we\r\nrequire of our Lorde God to gyve us al thinges that perteyne to his\r\nglorye and to the kyngdom of heaven, whereof he hath gyven us\r\ncommaundemente in the three preceptes written in the first table. Nowe\r\nfolowethe the thirde peticyon, wherein we praye God to graūte us that we\r\nmay fulfyll the other seven commaūdementes also, the whiche intreat of\r\nmatiers concerning this worldly kingdome and transitorye lyfe, that is\r\nto saye, to honoure our parentes and gouernours, to kyl no man, to\r\ncommitte none adulterye, to absteyne from thefte and lyinge, and to\r\nbehave our selfes in all thinges obedientlye, honestlye, peaceably, and\r\ngodly.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 1.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 2.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe feebleness of the drawing and the want of distinctness in these\r\nthree cuts, are totally unlike the more vigorous delineation of Holbein,\r\nas exemplified, though but imperfectly, in the two which are doubtlessly\r\nof his designing. None of them have the slightest pretensions to\r\ndelicacy or excellence of engraving, though they may be considered as\r\nthe best that had been executed in this country up to that time. Those\r\nwhich, in my opinion, were not designed by Holbein have the appearance\r\nof having been engraved on a _frushy_ kind of wood, of comparatively\r\ncoarse grain. It is not, however, unlikely that this appearance might\r\nresult from the feebleness of the drawing, conjoined with want of skill\r\non the part of the engraver.\r\n\r\nThe following cut will not perhaps form an inappropriate termination to\r\nthe notice of the principal wood engravings which have been ascribed to\r\nHolbein. It occurs as an illustration of the generation of Christ,\r\nMatthew, chapter I, in an edition of the New Testament, printed at\r\nZurich, by Froschover, in 1554,[VI-63] the year of Holbein’s death.\r\nThough there be no name to this cut, yet from the great resemblance\r\nwhich it bears to Holbein’s style, I have little doubt of the design\r\nbeing his.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-63: The title-page of this book--which has previously\r\n    been referred to at page 357, in illustration of the word\r\n    _picta_--is as follows: “Novi Testamenti Editio postrema per Des.\r\n    Erasmum Roterodamum. Omnia picturis illustrata. Accesserunt\r\n    Capitum argumenta Elegiaco carmine, Rudolpho Gualtero authore,\r\n    conscripta. Tiguri, in Officina Froschoviana. Anno M.D.LIIII.”\r\n    8vo.]\r\n\r\nThe three following specimens of the cuts in Tindale’s Translation of\r\nthe New Testament, printed at Antwerp in 1534,[VI-64] ought, in strict\r\nchronological order, to have preceded those of the Dance of Death; but\r\nas Holbein holds the same rank in this chapter as Durer in the\r\npreceding, it seemed preferable to give first a connected account of the\r\nprincipal wood-cuts which are generally ascribed to him, and which there\r\nis the strongest reason to believe were actually of his designing. The\r\ncelebrity of Tindale’s translation, as the earliest English version of\r\nthe New Testament which appeared in print, and the place which his name\r\noccupies in the earlier part of the history of the Reformation in\r\nEngland, will give an interest to those cuts to which they could have no\r\npretensions as mere works of art. It is probable that they were executed\r\nat Antwerp, where the book was printed; and the drawing and engraving\r\nwill afford some idea of the style of most of the small cuts which are\r\nto be found in works printed in Holland and Flanders about that period.\r\nThe first of the preceding cuts represents St. Luke employed in painting\r\na figure of the Virgin, and it occurs at the commencement of the Gospel\r\nof that Evangelist. The second, which occurs at the commencement of the\r\nGeneral Epistle of James, represents that Saint in the character of a\r\npilgrim. The third, Death on the Pale Horse, is an illustration of the\r\nsixth chapter of Revelations.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-64: The volume is of octavo size, and the title is as\r\n    follows: “The Newe Testament. Imprinted at Antwerp by Marten\r\n    Emperour. Anno M.D.XXXIIII.” The letters on the wood-cut of the\r\n    printer’s device, seen in the copies on paper, are M. K. The first\r\n    edition of Tindale’s Translation was printed in 1526. William\r\n    Tindale, otherwise Hitchins, was born on the borders of Wales, but\r\n    was of a Northumberland family, being descended from Adam de\r\n    Tindale of Langley, near Haydon Bridge, in that county. He was\r\n    strangled, and his body was afterwards burnt as that of a heretic\r\n    by the popish party, at Vilvorde, near Brussels, in 1536.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 1.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 2.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 3.]\r\n\r\nThere is a beautiful copy, printed on vellum, of this edition of\r\nTindale’s Translation of the New Testament in the Library of the British\r\nMuseum. It appears to have formerly belonged to Queen Anne Boleyn, and\r\nwas probably a presentation copy from the translator. The title-page is\r\nbeautifully illuminated; the whole of the ornamental border, which is\r\nseen in the copies on paper, is covered with gilding and colour, and the\r\nwood-cut of the printer’s mark is covered with the blazoning of the\r\nroyal arms. On the edges, which are gilt, there is inscribed, in red\r\nletters, ANNA REGINA ANGLIÆ. This beautiful volume formerly belonged to\r\nthe Reverend C. M. Cracherode, by whom it was bequeathed to the Museum.\r\n\r\nThe first complete English translation of the Old and New Testaments was\r\nthat of Miles Coverdale, which appeared in folio, 1535,[VI-65] without\r\nthe name or residence of the printer, but supposed to have been printed\r\nat Zurich by Christopher Froschover. The dedication is addressed to\r\nHenry VIII, by “his Graces humble subjecte and daylie oratour, Myles\r\nCoverdale;” and in the copy in the British Museum the commencement is as\r\nfollows: “Unto the most victorious Prynce and our most gracyous\r\nsoveraigne Lorde, kynge Henry the eyght, kynge of Englonde and of\r\nFraunce, lorde of Irlonde, &c. Defendour of the Fayth, and under God the\r\nchefe and supreme heade of the churche of Englonde. ¶The ryght and just\r\nadministracyon of the laws that God gave unto Moses and unto Josua: the\r\ntestimonye of faythfulnes that God gave of David: the plenteous\r\nabundance of wysdome that God gave unto Salomon: the lucky and\r\nprosperous age with the multiplicacyon of sede which God gave unto\r\nAbraham and Sara his wyfe, he gevē unto you most Gracyous Prynce, with\r\nyour dearest just wyfe and most virtuous Pryncesse, Quene Anne. Amen.”\r\nIn most copies, however, “Quene Jane” is substituted for “Quene Anne,”\r\nwhich proves that the original dedication had been cancelled after the\r\ndisgrace and execution of Anne Boleyn, and that, though the colophon is\r\ndated 4th October 1535, the work had not been generally circulated until\r\nsubsequent to 20th May 1536, the date of Henry’s marriage with Jane\r\nSeymour.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-65: The title of this edition is as follows: “BIBLIA.\r\n    The Bible, that is, the holy Scripture of the Olde and Newe\r\n    Testaments, faithfully translated out of Douche and Latyn in to\r\n    Englishe. M.D.XXXV.” This title is surrounded with an ornamental\r\n    wood-cut border of ten compartments: 1. Adam and Eve. 2. The name\r\n    of Jehovah in Hebrew characters in the centre at the top.\r\n    3. Christ with the banner of the cross trampling on the serpent,\r\n    sin, and death. 4. Moses receiving the tables of the law.\r\n    5. Jewish High Priest,--Esdras. 6. Christ sending his disciples to\r\n    preach the Gospel. 7. Paul preaching. 8. David playing on the\r\n    harp. 9. In the centre at the bottom, King Henry VIII. on his\r\n    throne giving a book--probably intended for the Bible--to certain\r\n    abbots and bishops. 10. St. Paul with a sword. The day of the\r\n    month mentioned in the colophon was probably the date of the last\r\n    sheet being sent to press: “Prynted in the yeare of our Lorde\r\n    M.D.XXXV, and fynished the fourth daye of October.” Copies of this\r\n    edition with the title-page are extremely rare. Some copies have a\r\n    modern lithographed title prefixed, which is not exactly correct,\r\n    though professedly a fac-simile: in one of the scrolls it has\r\n    “_telius meus_” for “filius meus.” In the corresponding scroll in\r\n    a copy in the British Museum the words are in English: “This is my\r\n    deare Son in whom I delyte, heare him,”--above the figure of\r\n    Christ with the banner of the cross. I have not the least doubt of\r\n    this title-page having been designed by Holbein.]\r\n\r\nThis edition contains a number of wood-cuts, all rather coarsely\r\nengraved, though some of them are designed with such spirit as to be not\r\nunworthy of Holbein himself, as will be apparent from two or three of\r\nthe following specimens. In the first, Cain killing Abel, the attitude\r\nof Abel, and the action of Cain, sufficiently indicate that the original\r\ndesigner understood the human figure well, and could draw it with great\r\nforce in a position which it is most difficult to represent.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 1.]\r\n\r\nThe figure of Abraham in No. 2 bears in some parts considerable\r\nresemblance to that of the same subject given as a specimen of Holbein’s\r\nBible cuts at page 368; but there are several others in the work which\r\nare much more like his style; and which, perhaps, might be copied from\r\nearlier cuts of his designing. The two preceding may be considered as\r\nspecimens of the best designed cuts in the Old Testament; and the\r\nfollowing, the return of the Two Spies, is given us one of the more\r\nordinary.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 2.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 3.]\r\n\r\nThe three next cuts are from the New Testament. The first forms the\r\nhead-piece to the Gospel of St. Matthew; the second, which occurs on the\r\ntitle-page, and displays great power of drawing in the figure, is John\r\nthe Baptist; and the third represents St. Paul writing, with his sword\r\nbefore him, and a weaver’s loom to his left: the last incident, which is\r\nfrequently introduced in old wood-cuts of this Saint, is probably\r\nintended to designate his business as a tentmaker, and also to indicate\r\nthat, though zealously engaged in disseminating the doctrines of Christ,\r\nhe had not ceased to “work with his hands.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 1.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 2.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 3.]\r\n\r\nMany of the cuts in this work are copied in a subsequent edition, also\r\nin folio, printed in 1537; and some of the copies are so extremely like\r\nthe originals--every line being retained--as to induce a suspicion that\r\nthe impressions of the latter had been transferred to the blocks by\r\nmeans of what is technically termed “rubbing down.”\r\n\r\nAbout 1530 the art of chiaro-scuro engraving on wood, which appears to\r\nhave been first introduced into Italy by Ugo da Carpi, was practised by\r\nAntonio Fantuzzi, called also Antonio da Trente. Most of this engraver’s\r\nchiaro-scuros are from the designs of Parmegiano. It is said that\r\nFantuzzi was employed by Parmegiano for the express purpose of executing\r\nchiaro-scuro engravings from his drawings, and that, when residing with\r\nhis employer at Bologna, he took an opportunity of robbing him of all\r\nhis blocks, impressions, and designs. Between 1530 and 1540 Joseph\r\nNicholas Vincentini da Trente engraved several chiaro-scuros, most of\r\nwhich, like those executed by Fantuzzi, are from the designs of\r\nParmegiano. From the number of chiaro-scuros engraved after drawings by\r\nthis artist, I think it highly probable that the most of them were\r\nexecuted under his own superintendence and published for his own\r\nbenefit. Baldazzar Peruzzi and Domenico Beccafumi, both painters of\r\nrepute at that period, are said to have engraved in chiaro-scuro; but\r\nthe prints in this style usually ascribed to them are not numerous, and\r\nI consider it doubtful if they were actually of their own engraving.\r\n\r\nFrom about 1530, the art of wood engraving, in the usual manner, began\r\nto make considerable progress in Italy, and many of the cuts executed in\r\nthat country between 1540 and 1580 may vie with the best wood engravings\r\nof the same period executed in Germany. Instead of the plain and simple\r\nstyle, which is in general characteristic of Italian wood-cuts previous\r\nto 1530, the wood engravers of that country began to execute their\r\nsubjects in a more delicate and elaborate manner. In the period under\r\nconsideration, we find cross-hatching frequently introduced with great\r\neffect; there is a greater variety of _tint_ in the cuts; the texture of\r\ndifferent substances is indicated more correctly; the foliage of trees\r\nis more natural; and the fur and feathers of animals are discriminated\r\nwith considerable ability.\r\n\r\nThe following cut will afford perhaps some idea of the best Italian\r\nwood-cuts of the period under consideration. It is a reduced copy of the\r\nfrontispiece to Marcolini’s Sorti,[VI-66] folio, printed at Venice in\r\n1540. There is an impression of this cut on paper of a greenish tint in\r\nthe Print Room of the British Museum, and from this circumstance it is\r\nplaced, though improperly, in a volume, marked I. W. 4, and lettered\r\n“Italian chiaro-scuros.” Underneath this impression the late Mr. Ottley\r\nhas written, “Not in Bartsch;” and from his omitting to mention the work\r\nfor which it was engraved, I am inclined to think that he himself was\r\nnot aware of its forming the frontispiece to Marcolini’s Sorti.\r\nPapillon, speaking of the supposed engraver, Joseph Porta Garfagninus,\r\nwhose name is seen on a tablet near the bottom towards the right, says,\r\n“J’ai de lui une fort belle Académie des Sciences,”[VI-67] but seems not\r\nto have known of the work to which it belonged. This cut is merely a\r\ncopy, reversed, of a study by Raffaele for his celebrated fresco,\r\nusually called the School of Athens, in the Vatican. It is engraved in a\r\nwork entitled “Vies et Oeuvres des Peintres les plus célèbres,” 4to.\r\nParis, 1813; and in the Table des Planches at the commencement of the\r\nvolume in which it occurs, the subject is thus described: “Pl. CCCCV.\r\nEtude pour le tableau de l’Ecole d’Athènes. Ces différens episodes ne se\r\nretrouvant pas dans le tableau qui a été exécuté des mains de Raphaël,\r\nne doivent être considérées que comme des essais ou premières pensées.\r\n_Grav. M. Ravignano._” From this description it appears that the same\r\nsubject had been previously engraved on copper by Marco da Ravenna, who\r\nflourished about the year 1530. Though I have never seen an impression\r\nof Marco’s engraving of this subject, and though it is not mentioned in\r\nHeineken’s catalogue of the engraved works of Raffaele,[VI-68] I have\r\nlittle doubt that Porta’s wood-cut is copied from it.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-66: The following is the title of this curious and\r\n    scarce work: “Le Sorti di Francesco Marcolini da Forli, intitolate\r\n    Giardino di Pensieri.” Dedicated, “Allo Illustrissimo Signore\r\n    Hercole Estense, Duca di Ferrara.” At the conclusion is the\r\n    colophon: “In Venetia per Francesco Marcolini da Forli, ne gli\r\n    anni del Signore MDXXXX. Del mese di Ottobre.” In a _proemio_, or\r\n    preface, the author explains the manner of applying his\r\n    “_piacevole inventione_,” which is nothing more than a mode of\r\n    resolving questions by cards, and was probably suggested by\r\n    Fanti’s Triompho di Fortuna, of which some account is given at\r\n    page 315.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-67: Papillon, Traité de la Gravure en Bois, tom.\r\n    i. p. 137.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-68: This catalogue is printed in the second volume of\r\n    Heineken’s Nachrichten von Künstlern und Kunst-Sachen, 8vo.\r\n    Leipzig, 1768-1769. This work, which appeared two years before his\r\n    Idée Générale d’une Collection complette d’Estampes, contains much\r\n    information on the early history of art, which is not to be found\r\n    in the latter. All the fac-similes of old engravings in the Idée\r\n    Générale originally appeared in the Nachrichten. Heineken, in the\r\n    first volume of this work, p. 340, mentions Porta’s cut, but says\r\n    nothing of its being copied from a design by Raffaele.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nJoseph Porta, frequently called Joseph Salviati by Italian authors, was\r\na painter, and he took the surname of Salviati from that of his master,\r\nFrancesco Salviati.[VI-69] There are a few other wood-cuts which contain\r\nhis name; but whether he was the designer, or the engraver only, is\r\nextremely uncertain.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-69: Heineken, in his Nachrichten, 1er. Theil, S. 340,\r\n    says that Joseph Porta “was a pupil of _Cecchino_ Salviati, who is\r\n    not to be confounded with _Francesco_ Salviati;” and yet in his\r\n    Idée Générale, published subsequently, page 134, we find\r\n    “Francesco del Salviati, autrement Rossi, de Florence, et son\r\n    disciple Giuseppe Porta, appellé communément Giuseppe Salviati.”\r\n    Heineken, in his first work, committed the mistake of supposing\r\n    that Francesco Salviati’s to-name was the Christian name of\r\n    another person. In Huber’s Notice Générale des Graveurs et\r\n    Peintres, Francis Salviati appears as “François Cecchini, dit\r\n    Salviati.”]\r\n\r\nMarcolini’s work contains nearly a hundred wood-cuts besides the\r\nfrontispiece, but, though several of them are designed with great\r\nspirit, no one is so well engraved.[VI-70] The following is a fac-simile\r\nof one which occurs at page 35. The relentless-looking old woman is a\r\npersonification of _Punitione_--Punishment--holding in her right hand a\r\ntremendous scourge for the chastisement of evil-doers. Though this cut\r\nbe but coarsely engraved, the domestic Nemesis, who here appears to\r\nwield the retributive scourge, is designed with such spirit that if the\r\nfigure were executed in marble it might almost pass for one of Michael\r\nAngelo’s. The drapery is admirably cast; the figure is good; and the\r\naction and expression are at once simple and severe.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-70: The first forty-six cuts are the best, generally,\r\n    both in design and execution. The others, commencing at page 108,\r\n    are illustrative of the sayings and doctrines of ancient\r\n    philosophers and moralists, and one or two of the cuts are\r\n    repeated. In this portion of the work, each page, except what is\r\n    occupied by the cut, is filled with explanatory or illustrative\r\n    verses arranged in triplets.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe preceding cut, also a fac-simile, occurs at page 81 as an\r\nillustration of Matrimony. The young man, with his legs already tied,\r\nseems to be deliberating on the prudence of making a contract which may\r\npossibly add a yoke to his shoulders. The ring which he holds in his\r\nhand appears to have given rise to his cogitations.\r\n\r\nThe following small cuts of cards--“Il Re, Fante, Cavallo, e Sette di\r\ndenari”--are copied from the instructions in the preface;[VI-71] and the\r\nbeautiful design of Truth rescued by Time--VERITAS FILIA\r\nTEMPORIS--occurs as a tail-piece on the last page of the work. This cut\r\noccurs not unfrequently in works published by Giolito, by whom I believe\r\nthe Sorti was printed; and two or three of the other cuts contained in\r\nthe volume are to be found in a humorous work of Doni’s, entitled\r\n“I Marmi,” printed by Giolito in 1552.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-71: The first hundred and seven pages of the work are\r\n    chiefly filled with similar figures of cards variously combined,\r\n    with short references. How Marcolini’s pleasant invention is to be\r\n    applied to discover the secrets of Fate, I have not been able to\r\n    comprehend.]\r\n\r\nThe wood engravers of Venice about the middle of the sixteenth century\r\nappear to have excelled all other Italian wood engravers, and for the\r\ndelicacy of their execution they rivalled those of Lyons, who at that\r\nperiod were chiefly distinguished for the neat and delicate manner of\r\ntheir engraving small subjects. In the pirated edition of the Lyons\r\nDance of Death, published at Venice in 1545 by V. Vaugris, the cuts are\r\nmore correctly copied and more delicately engraved than those in the\r\nedition first published at Cologne by the heirs of Arnold Birkman in\r\n1555. In fact, the wood engravings in books printed at Lyons and Venice\r\nfrom about 1540 to 1580 are in general more delicately engraved than\r\nthose executed in Germany and the Low Countries during the same period.\r\nAmong all the Venetian printers of that age, Gabriel Giolito is entitled\r\nto precedence from the number and comparative excellence of the\r\nwood-cuts contained in the numerous illustrated works which issued from\r\nhis press. In several of the works printed by him every cut is\r\nsurrounded by an ornamental border; and this border, not being engraved\r\non the same block as the cut, but separately as a kind of frame, is\r\nfrequently repeated: sixteen different borders, when the book is of\r\noctavo size and there is a cut on every page, would suffice for the\r\nwhole work, however extensive it might be. The practice of _ornamenting_\r\ncuts in this manner was very prevalent about the period under\r\nconsideration, and at the present time some publishers seem inclined to\r\nrevive it. I should, however, be sorry to see it again become prevalent,\r\nfor though to some subjects, designed in a particular manner, an\r\nornamental border may be appropriate, yet I consider the practice of\r\nthus _framing_ a series of cuts as indicative of bad taste, and as\r\nlikely to check the improvement of the art. Highly ornamented borders\r\nhave, in a certain degree, the effect of reducing a series of cuts,\r\nhowever different their execution, to a standard of mediocrity; for they\r\nfrequently conceal the beauty of a well-engraved subject, and serve as a\r\nscreen to a bad one. In Ludovico Dolce’s Transformationi--a translation,\r\nor rather paraphrase of Ovid’s Metamorphoses--first printed by Giolito\r\nin 1553, and again in 1557, the cuts, instead of having a border all\r\nround, have only ornaments at the two vertical sides. The preceding is a\r\nfac-simile of one of those cuts, divested of its ornaments, from the\r\nedition of 1557. The subject is the difficult labour of Alcmena,--a\r\nfavourite with Italian artists. This is the cut previously alluded to at\r\npage 217.\r\n\r\nA curious book, of which an edition, in quarto, was printed at Rome in\r\n1561, seems deserving of notice here, not on account of any merit in the\r\nwood-cuts which it contains, but on account of the singularity of four\r\nof them, which are given as a specimen of a “Sonetto figurato,” in the\r\nmanner of the cuts in a little work entitled “A curious Hieroglyphick\r\nBible,” first printed in London, in duodecimo, about 1782. The Italian\r\nwork in question was written by “Messer Giovam Battista Palatino,\r\nCittadino Romano,” and from the date of the Pope’s grant to the author\r\nof the privilege of exclusively printing it for ten years, it seems\r\nlikely that the first edition was published about 1540. The work is a\r\ntreatise on penmanship; and the title-page of the edition of 1561--which\r\nis embellished with a portrait of the author--may be translated as\r\nfollows: “The Book of M. Giovam Battista Palatino, citizen of Rome, in\r\nwhich is taught the manner of writing all kinds of characters, ancient\r\nand modern, of whatever nation, with Rules, Proportions, and Examples.\r\nTogether with a short and useful Discourse on Cyphers. Newly revised and\r\ncorrected by the Author. With the addition of fifteen beautiful\r\ncuts.”[VI-72] In Astle’s Origin and Progress of Writing, page 227,\r\nsecond edition, Palatino’s work is thus noticed: “In 1561, Valerius\r\nDoricus printed at Rome a curious book on all kinds of writing, ancient\r\nand modern. This book contains specimens of a great variety of writing\r\npractised in different ages and countries; some of these specimens are\r\nprinted from types to imitate writing, and others from carved\r\nwood-blocks. This book also contains a treatise on the art of writing in\r\ncipher, and is a most curious specimen of early typography.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-72: The following is a literal copy of the title:\r\n    “Libro di M. Giovam Battista Palatino, Cittadino Romano, Nelqual\r\n    s’insegna à Scriver ogni sorte lettera, Antica & Moderna, di\r\n    qualunque natione, con le sue regole, & misure, & essempi: Et con\r\n    un breve, et util Discorso de le Cifre: Riveduto novamente, &\r\n    corretto dal proprio Autore. Con la giunta di quindici tavole\r\n    bellissime.” At the end of the work is the imprint: “In Roma per\r\n    Valerio Dorico alla Chiavica de Santa Lucia. Ad Instantia de\r\n    M. Giovan della Gatta. L’Anno M.D.LXI.” 4to. Papillon says that\r\n    the work first appeared in 1540, and was reprinted in 1545, 1547,\r\n    1548, 1550, 1553, and 1556. An edition was also published at\r\n    Venice in 1588.]\r\n\r\nAfter his specimens of “Lettere Cifrate,” Palatino devotes a couple of\r\npages to “Cifre quadrate, et Sonetti figurati,” two modes of\r\nriddle-writing which, it appears, are solely employed for amusement. The\r\n“Cifro quadrato” is nothing more than a monogram, formed of a cluster of\r\ninterwoven capitals, but in which every one of the letters of the name\r\nis to be found. In the following specimen the name thus ingeniously\r\ndisguised is LAVINIA.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe following is a slightly reduced copy of the first four lines of the\r\n“Sonetto figurato;” the other ten lines are expressed by figures in a\r\nsimilar manner. “As to figured sonnets,” says the author, “no better\r\nrule can be given, than merely to observe that the figures should\r\nclearly and distinctly correspond with the matter, and that there should\r\nbe as few supplementary letters as possible. Of course, orthography and\r\npure Italian are not to be looked for in such exercises; and it is no\r\nobjection that the same figure be used for the beginning of one word,\r\nthe middle of another, or the end of a third. It is the chief excellence\r\nof such compositions that there should be few letters to be supplied.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe “interpretatio” of the preceding figured text is as follows:\r\n\r\n  “Dove son gli occhi, et la serena forma\r\n    Del santo alegro et amoroso aspetto?\r\n    Dov’ è la man eburna ov’ e ’l bel petto\r\n  Ch’ appensarvi hor’ in fonte mi transforma?”\r\n\r\nThis figured sonnet is a curious specimen of hieroglyphic and “phonetic”\r\nwriting combined. For those who do not understand Italian, it seems\r\nnecessary to give the following explanation of the words, and point out\r\ntheir phonetic relation to the things. _Dove_, where, is composed of\r\n_D_, and _ove_, eggs, as seen at the commencement of the first line.\r\n_Son_, are, is represented by a man’s head and a trumpet, making a\r\nsound, _son_. The preceding figures are examples of what is called\r\n“phonetic” writing, by modern expounders of Egyptian antiquities,--that\r\nis, the figures of _things_ are not placed as representatives of the\r\nthings themselves, but that their names when pronounced may form a word\r\nor part of a word, which has generally not the least relation to the\r\nthing by which it is _phonetically_, that is, vocally, expressed.\r\n_Occhi_, eyes, is an instance of hieroglyphic writing; the figure and\r\nthe idea to be represented agree. _La_, the, is represented by the\r\nmusical note _la_; _serena_, placid, by a Siren,--_Sirena_,--\r\northography, as the author says, is not to be expected in figured\r\nsonnets; and _forma_, shape, by a shoemaker’s last, which is called\r\n_forma_ in Italian.\r\n\r\nIn the second line, _Santo_, holy, is represented by a Saint, _Santo_;\r\n_allegro_, cheerfulness, by a pair of wings, _ale_, and _grue_, a crane,\r\nthe superfluous _e_ forming, with the T following, the conjunction _et_,\r\nand. The words _amoroso aspetto_ are formed of _amo_, a hook, _rosa_, a\r\nrose, and _petto_, the breast, with a supplementary _s_ between the rose\r\nand the breast.\r\n\r\nIn the third line we have _ove_, eggs, and the musical _la_ again;\r\n_man_, the hand, is expressed by its proper figure; _eburna_,\r\nivory-like, is composed of the letters EB and an urn, _urna_; and in the\r\nlatter part of the line the eggs, _ov’_, and the breast, _petto_, are\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the fourth line, a couple of cloaks, _cappe_,\r\nstand for _ch’ appe_ in the compound word _ch’ appe_nsarvi; _hor’_, now,\r\nis represented by an hour-glass, _hora_, literally, an hour; _fonte_, a\r\nfountain, is expressed by its proper figure; and the words _mi\r\ntransforma_, are phonetically expressed by a mitre, _mitra_, the\r\nsupplementary letters NS, and the shoemaker’s last, _forma_.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Queen Elizabeth, a taste for inventing devices in this\r\nmanner seems to have been fashionable among professed wits; and the\r\npractice of expressing a name by a rebus was not unfrequent in an\r\nearlier age. It is probable that the old sign of the Bolt-in-Tun in\r\nFleet Street derives its origin from Bolton, a prior of St.\r\nBartholomew’s in Smithfield, who gave a bird-_bolt_ in the bung-hole of\r\na _tun_ as the rebus of his name. The peculiarities of the Italian\r\nfigured sonnet are not unaptly illustrated in Camden’s Remains, in the\r\nchapter entitled “_Rebus,[VI-73] or Name-Devises_:” “Did not that\r\namorous youth mystically expresse his love to _Rose Hill_, whom he\r\ncourted, when in a border of his painted cloth he caused to be painted\r\nas rudely as he devised grossely, a rose, a hill, an eye, a loafe, and a\r\nwell,--that is, if you will spell it,\r\n\r\n  _Rose Hill I love well._”[VI-74]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-73: There is a curious allusion to a _Rebus_ in\r\n    Horace, Satyr. Lib. I. Sat. V., Vers. 88, which has escaped the\r\n    notice of all his commentators:\r\n\r\n      “Quatuor hinc rapimur viginti et millia rhedis,\r\n      Mansuri oppidulo, quod versu dicere non est,\r\n      _Signis perfacile est._”\r\n\r\n    The place which he did not think proper to name was undoubtedly\r\n    Asculum, whose situation exactly corresponds with the distance\r\n    from _Trivicum_, where he rested the preceding night. From the\r\n    manner in which Horace alludes to the _signa_-- _as_ and _culum_--\r\n    of which the name is composed, it seems likely that a certain\r\n    vulgar benison was not unknown at Rome in the age of Augustus.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-74: Remaines concerning Britaine, with additions by\r\n    John Philpot, Somerset Herald, p. 164. Edit. 1636.]\r\n\r\nAmong the wood engravers of Lyons who flourished about the middle of the\r\nsixteenth century, the only one whose name has come down to modern times\r\nis Bernard Solomon; and if he were actually the engraver of the numerous\r\ncuts which are ascribed to him, he must have been extremely industrious.\r\nI am not, however, aware of any cut which contains his mark; and it is\r\nby no means certain whether he were really a wood engraver, or whether\r\nhe only made the designs for wood engravers to execute. Papillon, who\r\nhas been blindly followed by most persons who have either incidentally\r\nor expressly written on wood engraving, unhesitatingly claims him as a\r\nwood engraver; but looking at the inequality in the execution of the\r\ncuts ascribed to him, and regarding the sameness of character in the\r\ndesigns, I am inclined to think that he was not an engraver, but that he\r\nmerely made the drawings on the wood. Sir E. L. Bulwer has committed a\r\nmistake of this kind in his England and the English: “This country,”\r\nsays he in his second volume, page 205, edition 1833, “may boast of\r\nhaving, in Bewick of Newcastle, brought wood engraving to perfection;\r\nhis pupil, Harvey, continues the profession with reputation.” The writer\r\nhere evidently speaks of that which he knows very little about, for at\r\nthe time that his book was published, Harvey, though originally a wood\r\nengraver, and a pupil of Bewick, had abandoned the profession for about\r\neight years, and had devoted himself entirely to painting and drawing\r\nfor copper-plate and wood engravers. Indeed I very much question if Sir\r\nEdward Lytton Bulwer ever saw a cut--except, perhaps, that of\r\nDentatus,--which was actually engraved by Harvey. With about equal\r\npropriety, a writer, speaking of wood engraving in England twenty years\r\nago, might have described the late John Thurston as “continuing the\r\nprofession with reputation,” merely because he was one of the principal\r\ndesigners of wood engravings at that period.\r\n\r\nBernard Solomon, whether a designer or engraver on wood, is justly\r\nentitled to be ranked among the “little masters” in this branch of art.\r\nAll the cuts ascribed to him which have come under my notice are of\r\nsmall size, and most of them are executed in a delicate manner; they\r\nare, however, generally deficient in effect,[VI-75] and may readily be\r\ndistinguished by the tall slim figures which he introduces. He evidently\r\nhad not understood the “capabilities” of his art, for in none of his\r\nproductions do we find the well-contrasted “black-and-white,” which,\r\nwhen well managed, materially contributes to the excellence of a\r\nwell-engraved wood-cut. The production of a good _black_ is, indeed, one\r\nof the great advantages, in point of conventional colour, which wood\r\npossesses over copper; and the wood engraver who neglects this\r\nadvantage, and labours perhaps for a whole day to cut with mechanical\r\nprecision a number of delicate but unmeaning lines, which a copper-plate\r\nengraver would execute with facility in an hour, affords a tolerably\r\nconvincing proof of his not thoroughly understanding the principles of\r\nhis art. In Bernard’s cuts, and in most of those executed at Lyons about\r\nthe same period, we find much of this ineffective labour; we perceive in\r\nthem many evidences of the pains-taking workman, but few traits of the\r\ntalented artist. From the time that a taste for those little and\r\nlaboriously executed, but spiritless cuts, began to prevail, the decline\r\nof wood engraving may be dated. Instead of confining themselves within\r\nthe legitimate boundaries of their own art, wood engravers seem to have\r\nbeen desirous of emulating the delicacy of copper-plate engraving, and,\r\nas might naturally be expected by any one who understands the\r\ndistinctive peculiarities of the two arts, they failed. The book-buyers\r\nof the period having become sickened with the glut of tasteless and\r\nineffective trifles, wood engraving began to decline: large\r\nwell-engraved wood-cuts executed between 1580 and 1600 are comparatively\r\nscarce.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-75: Papillon, who speaks highly of the execution of\r\n    the cuts ascribed to Bernard Solomon, admits that they want\r\n    effect. “La gravure,” says he, speaking of the cuts contained in\r\n    ‘Quadrins Historiques de la Bible,’ “est fort belle, excepté\r\n    qu’elle manque de clair obscur, parce que les tailles sont presque\r\n    toutes de la même teinte, ce qui fait que les lointains ne fuyent\r\n    pas assez. C’est le seul defaut des gravures de Bernard Salomon;\r\n    ce qui lui a été commun avec plus de quarante autres graveurs en\r\n    bois de son temps.”--Traité de la Gravure en Bois, tom.\r\n    i. p. 209.]\r\n\r\nBernard Solomon, or, as he is frequently called, _Little_ Solomon, from\r\nthe smallness of his works, is said to have been born in 1512, and the\r\nmost of the cuts which are ascribed to him appeared in works printed at\r\nLyons between 1545 and 1580. Perhaps more books containing small\r\nwood-cuts were printed at Lyons between those years than in any other\r\ncity or town in Europe during the corresponding period. It appears to\r\nhave been the grand mart for Scripture cuts, emblems, and devices; but\r\nout of the many hundreds which appear to have been engraved there in the\r\nperiod referred to, it would be difficult to select twenty that can be\r\nconsidered really excellent both in execution and design. One of the\r\nprincipal publishers of Lyons at that time was Jean de Tournes; many of\r\nthe works which issued from his press display great typographic\r\nexcellence, and in almost all the cuts are engraved with great neatness.\r\nThe following cut is a fac-simile of one which appears in the title-page\r\nof an edition of Petrarch’s Sonnetti, Canzoni, e Trionfi, published by\r\nhim in a small octodecimo volume, 1545.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe design of the cut displays something of the taste for emblem and\r\ndevice[VI-76] which was then so prevalent, and which became so generally\r\ndiffused by the frequent editions of Alciat’s Emblems, the first of\r\nwhich was printed about 1531. The portraits of Petrarch and Laura,\r\nlooking not unlike “Philip and Mary on a shilling,” are seen enclosed\r\nwithin a heart which Cupid has pierced to the very core with one of his\r\narrows. The volume contains seven other small cuts, designed and\r\nengraved in a style which very much resembles that of the cuts ascribed\r\nto Bernard Solomon; and as there is no mark by which his productions are\r\nto be ascertained, I think they are as likely to be of his designing as\r\nthree-fourths of those which are generally supposed to be of his\r\nengraving.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-76: Several editions of Alciat’s Emblems and Claude\r\n    Paradin’s Devises Heroïques were published at Lyons in the\r\n    sixteenth century. The first edition of the latter work was\r\n    printed there by Jean de Tournes, in 1557, 8vo.]\r\n\r\nThe work entitled “Quadrins Historiques de la Bible,” with wood-cuts,\r\nascribed to Bernard Solomon, and printed at Lyons by Jean de Tournes,\r\nwas undoubtedly suggested by the “Historiarum Veteris Testamenti\r\nIcones”--Holbein’s Bible-cuts--first published by the brothers Frellon\r\nin 1538. The first edition of the Quadrins Historiques was published in\r\noctavo about 1550, and was several times reprinted within the succeeding\r\ntwenty years. The total number of cuts in the edition of 1560 is two\r\nhundred and twenty-nine, of which no less than one hundred and seventy\r\nare devoted to the illustration of Exodus and Genesis. At the top of\r\neach is printed the reference to the chapter to which it relates, and at\r\nthe bottom is a “Quadrin poëtique, tiré de la Bible, pour graver en la\r\ntable des affeccions l’amour des sacrees Histories.” Those “Quadrins”\r\nappear to have been written by Claude Paradin. The composition of\r\nseveral of the cuts is good, and nearly all display great _neatness_ of\r\nexecution. The following is a fac-simile of the seventh, Adam and Eve\r\ndriven out of Paradise. It is, however, necessary to observe that this\r\nis by no means one of the best cuts either in point of design or\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nA similar work, entitled “Figures du Nouveau Testament,” with cuts,\r\nevidently designed by the person who had made the drawings for those in\r\nthe “Quadrins Historiques de la Bible,” was also published by Jean de\r\nTournes about 1553, and several editions were subsequently printed. The\r\ncuts are rather less in size than those of the Quadrins, and are, on the\r\nwhole, rather better engraved. The total number is a hundred and four,\r\nand under each are six explanatory verses, composed by Charles Fonteine,\r\nwho, in a short poetical address at the commencement, dedicates the work\r\n“A Tres-illustre et Treshaute Princesse, Madame Marguerite de France,\r\nDuchesse de Berri.” The following, Christ tempted by Satan, is a copy of\r\nthe sixteenth cut, but like that of the expulsion of Adam and Eve, it is\r\nnot one of the best in the work.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nOld engravings and paintings illustrative of manners or of costume are\r\ngenerally interesting; and on this account a set of large wood-cuts\r\ndesigned by Peter Coeck of Alost, in Flanders, is deserving of notice.\r\nThe subjects of those cuts are the manners and costumes of the Turks;\r\nand the drawings were made on the spot by Coeck himself, who visited\r\nTurkey in 1533. It is said that he brought from the east an important\r\nsecret relative to the art of dyeing silk and wool for the fabrication\r\nof tapestries, a branch of manufacture with which he appears to have\r\nbeen connected, and for which he made a number of designs. He was also\r\nan architect and an author; and published several treatises on\r\nsculpture, geometry, perspective, and architecture. The cuts\r\nillustrative of the manners and costume of the Turks were not published\r\nuntil 1553, three years after his decease, as we learn from an\r\ninscription on the last.[VI-77] They are oblong, of folio size; and the\r\nseven of which the set consists are intended to be joined together, and\r\nthus to form one continuous subject. The figures, both on foot and\r\nhorseback, are designed with great spirit, but they want relief, and the\r\nengraving is coarse. One of the customs which he has illustrated in the\r\ncut No. 3 is singular; and though this _orientalism_ has been noticed by\r\na Scottish judge--Maclaurin of Dreghorn--Peter Coeck appears to be the\r\nonly traveller who has graphically represented “_quo modo Turci\r\nmingunt_,” i. e. _sedentes_. Succeeding artists have availed themselves\r\nliberally of those cuts. As the Turks in the sixteenth century were much\r\nmore formidable as a nation than at present, and their manners and\r\ncustoms objects of greater curiosity, wood engravings illustrative of\r\ntheir costume and mode of living appear to have been in considerable\r\ndemand at that period, for both in books and as single cuts they are\r\ncomparatively numerous.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-77: The following explanatory title occurs on the\r\n    first cut: “Ces moeurs et fachons de faire de Turcz avecq’ les\r\n    Regions y appartenantes, ont este au vif contrefactez par Pierre\r\n    Coeck d’Alost, luy estant en Turquie, l’an de Jesu Christ M.D. 33.\r\n    Lequel assy de sa main propre a pourtraict ces figures duysantes à\r\n    l’impression d’ycelles.” From another of the cuts we thus learn\r\n    the time of his death: “Marie Verhulst vefue du dict Pierre\r\n    d’Alost, trespasse en l’anne MDL, a faict imprimer les dicts\r\n    figures soubz Grace et Privilege de l’Imperialle Maiestie. En\r\n    l’Ann MCCCCCLIII.”]\r\n\r\nThough chiaro-scuro engraving on wood was, in all probability, first\r\npractised in Germany, yet the art does not appear to have been so much\r\ncultivated nor so highly prized in that country as in Italy. Between\r\n1530 and 1550, when Antonio Fantuzzi, J. N. Vincentini, and other\r\nItalians, were engaged in executing numerous chiaro-scuros after the\r\ndesigns of such masters as Raffaele, Corregio, Parmegiano, Polidoro,\r\nBeccafumi, and F. Salviati, the art appears to have been comparatively\r\nabandoned by the wood engravers of Germany. The chiaro-scuros executed\r\nin the latter country cannot generally for a moment bear a comparison,\r\neither in point of design or execution, with those executed in Italy\r\nduring the same period. I have, however, seen one German cut executed in\r\nthis style, with the date 1543, which, for the number of the blocks from\r\nwhich it is printed, and the delicacy of the impression in certain\r\nparts, is, if genuine, one of the most remarkable of that period. As the\r\npaper, however, seems comparatively modern, I am induced to suspect that\r\nthe date may be that of the painting or drawing, and that this\r\npicture-print--for, though executed by the same process, it would be\r\nimproper to call it a chiaro-scuro--may have been the work of Ungher,\r\na German wood engraver, who executed some chiaro-scuros at Berlin about\r\nseventy years ago. Whatever may be the date, however, or whoever may\r\nhave been the artist, it is one of the best executed specimens of\r\ncoloured block printing that I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nThis curious picture-print, including the border, is ten inches and\r\nthree quarters high by six inches and three quarters wide. The subject\r\nis a figure of Christ; in his left hand he holds an orb emblematic of\r\nhis power, while the right is elevated as in the act of pronouncing a\r\nbenediction. His robe is blue, with the folds indicated by a darker\r\ntint, and the border and lighter parts impressed with at least two\r\nlighter colours. Above this robe there is a large red mantle, fastened\r\nin front with what appears to be a jewel of three different colours,\r\nruby, yellow, and blue; the folds are of a darker colour; and the lights\r\nare expressed by a kind of yellow, which has evidently been either\r\nimpressed, or laid on the paper with a brush, before the red colour of\r\nthe mantle, and which, from its glistening, seems to have been\r\ncompounded with some metallic substance like fine gold-dust. The border\r\nof the print consists of a similar yellow, between plain black lines.\r\nThe face is printed in flesh colour of three tints, and the head is\r\nsurrounded with rays of glory, which appear like gilding. The engraving\r\nof the face, and of the hair of the head and beard, is extremely well\r\nexecuted, and much superior to anything that I have seen in wood-cuts\r\ncontaining Ungher’s mark. The globe is blue, with the lights preserved,\r\nintersected by light red and yellow lines; and the small cross at the\r\ntop is also yellow, like the light on the red mantle. The hands and feet\r\nare expressed in their proper colours; the ground on which the Redeemer\r\nstands is something between a lake and a fawn colour; and the ground of\r\nthe print, upwards from about an inch above the bottom, is of a lighter\r\nblue than the robe. To the right, near the bottom, are the date and\r\nmark, thus: [[1543]] The figure like a winged serpent resembles a mark\r\nwhich was frequently used by Lucas Cranach, except that the serpent or\r\ndragon of the latter appears less crooked, and usually has a ring in its\r\nmouth. The letter underneath also appears rather more like an I than an\r\nL. The drawing of the figure of Christ, however, is very much in the\r\nstyle of Lucas Cranach, and I am strongly inclined to think that the\r\noriginal painting or drawing was executed by him, whoever may have been\r\nthe engraver. There must have been at least ten blocks required for this\r\ncurious print, which, for clearness and distinctness in the colours, and\r\nfor delicacy of impression, more especially in the face, may challenge a\r\ncomparison not only with the finest chiaro-scuros of former times, but\r\nalso with the best specimens of coloured block-printing of the present\r\nday.[VI-78]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-78: This interesting specimen of the combined arts of\r\n    wood engraving and printing formerly belonged to the late Mr.\r\n    Robert Branston, wood engraver, who executed several of the\r\n    chiaro-scuros, and imitations of coloured drawings, in Savage’s\r\n    work on Decorative Printing. It is now in the possession of his\r\n    son, Mr. Frederick Branston, who is of the same profession as his\r\n    father.]\r\n\r\nIn 1557, Hubert Goltzius, a painter, but better known as an author than\r\nas an artist, published at Antwerp, in folio, a work containing\r\nportraits, executed in chiaro-scuro, of the Roman emperors, from Julius\r\nCæsar to Ferdinand I.[VI-79] Descamps, in his work entitled “La Vie des\r\nPeintres Flamands, Allemands et Hollandois,” says that those portraits,\r\nwhich are all copied from medals, were “engraved on wood by a painter of\r\nCourtrai, named Joseph Gietleughen;”[VI-80] and Papillon, who had\r\nexamined the work more closely, but not closely enough, says that the\r\noutlines are etched, and that the two _rentrées_--the subsequent\r\nimpressions which give to the whole the appearance of a chiaro-scuro\r\ndrawing--are from blocks of wood engraved in _intaglio_. What Papillon\r\nsays about the outlines being etched is true; but a close inspection of\r\nthose portraits will afford any person acquainted with the process ample\r\nproof of the “rentrées” being also printed from plates of metal in the\r\nsame manner as from engraved wood-blocks.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-79: The title-page of this work is printed in three\r\n    colours,--black, sepia, and green. The black ornamental outlines\r\n    are from an etched plate; the sepia and green colours are printed\r\n    from wood-blocks. An edition of this work, enlarged by Gevartius,\r\n    with portraits in two colours, and entirely engraved on wood, was\r\n    printed at Antwerp in 1645.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-80: Tom. i. p. 129. Paris, 1753.]\r\n\r\nEach of those portraits appears like an enlarged copy of a medal, and is\r\nthe result of three separate impressions; the first, containing the\r\noutlines of the head, the ornaments, and the name, has been printed from\r\nan etched plate of copper or some other metal, by means of a\r\ncopper-plate printing-press; and the two other impressions, over the\r\nfirst, have also been from plates of metal, mounted on blocks of wood,\r\nand printed by means of the common typographic printing-press. The\r\noutlines of the head and of the letters forming the legend are black;\r\nthe field of the medal is a muddy kind of sepia; and the head and the\r\nborder, printed from the same surface and at the same time, are of a\r\nlighter shade. The lights to be preserved have been cut in _intaglio_ in\r\nthe plates for the two “rentrées” in the same manner as on blocks of\r\nwood for printing in chiaro-scuro. The marks of the pins by which the\r\ntwo plates for the “rentrées” have been fastened to blocks of wood, to\r\nraise them to a proper height, are very perceptible; in the field of the\r\nmedal they appear like circular points, generally in pairs; while round\r\nthe outer margin they are mostly of a square form. It is difficult to\r\nconceive what advantage Goltzius might expect to derive by printing the\r\n“rentrées” from metal plates; for all that he has thus produced could\r\nhave been more simply effected by means of wood-blocks, as practised up\r\nto that time by all other chiaro-scuro engravers. Though those portraits\r\npossess but little merit as chiaro-scuros, they are yet highly\r\ninteresting in the history of art, as affording the first instances of\r\netching being employed for the outlines of a chiaro-scuro, and of the\r\nsubstitution, in surface-printing, of a plate of metal for a wood-block.\r\nGoltzius’s manner of etching the outlines of a chiaro-scuro print was\r\nfrequently practised both by French and English artists about the middle\r\nof the last century; and about 1722, Edward Kirkall engraved the\r\nprincipal parts of his chiaro-scuros in mezzo-tint, and afterwards\r\nprinted a tint from a metal plate mounted on wood. In the present day\r\nMr. George Baxter has successfully applied the principle of engraving\r\nthe ground and the outlines of his subjects in aqua-tint; and, as in the\r\ncase of Hubert Goltzius and Kirkall, he sometimes uses a metal-plate\r\ninstead of a wood-block in surface-printing. In the picture-prints\r\nexecuted by Mr. Baxter for the Pictorial Album, 1837, the tint of the\r\npaper on which each imitative painting appears to be mounted, is\r\ncommunicated from a smooth plate of copper, which receives the colour,\r\nand is printed in the same manner as a wood-block.\r\n\r\nAmong the German artists who made designs for wood engravers from the\r\ntime of Durer to about 1590, Erhard Schön, Virgil Solis, Melchior\r\nLorich, and Jost Amman may be considered as the principal. They are all\r\nfrequently described as wood engravers from the circumstance of their\r\nmarks being found on the cuts which they undoubtedly designed, but most\r\ncertainly did not engrave. Erhard Schön chiefly resided at Nuremberg;\r\nand some of the earliest cuts of his designing are dated 1528. In 1538\r\nhe published at Nuremberg a small treatise, in oblong quarto, on the\r\nproportions of the human figure, for the use of students and young\r\npersons.[VI-81] This work contains several wood-cuts, all coarsely\r\nengraved, illustrative of the writer’s precepts; two or three of\r\nthem--where the heads and bodies are represented by squares and\r\nrhomboidal figures--are extremely curious, though apparently not very\r\nwell adapted to improve a learner in the art of design. Another of the\r\ncuts, where the proportions are illustrated by means of a figure\r\ninscribed within a circle, is very like one of the illustrations\r\ncontained in Flaxman’s Lectures on Sculpture. Some cuts of\r\nplaying-cards, designed by Schön, are in greater request than any of his\r\nother works engraved on wood, which, for the most part, have but little\r\nto recommend them. He died about 1550.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-81: The following is a copy of the title:\r\n    “Underweisung der Proportzion und Stellung der Possen, liegent und\r\n    stehent; abgestochen wie man das vor augen sieht, in dem puchlein,\r\n    durch Erhart Schon von Norrenberg; für die Jungen gesellen und\r\n    Jungen zu unterrichtung die zu der Kunst lieb tragen. In den druck\r\n    gepracht, 1538.”]\r\n\r\nVirgil Solis, a painter, copper-plate engraver, and designer on wood,\r\nwas born at Nuremberg about 1514. The cuts which contain his mark are\r\nextremely numerous; and, from their being mostly of small size, he is\r\nranked by Heineken with the “Little Masters.” Several of his cuts\r\ndisplay great fertility of invention; but though his figures are\r\nfrequently spirited and the attitudes good, yet his drawing is generally\r\ncareless and incorrect. As a considerable number of his cuts are of the\r\nsame kind as those of Bernard Solomon, it seems as if there had been a\r\ncompetition at that time between the booksellers of Nuremberg and those\r\nof Lyons for supplying the European market with illustrations of two\r\nworks of widely different character, to wit, the Bible, and Ovid’s\r\nMetamorphoses,--Virgil Solis being retained for the German, and Bernard\r\nSolomon for the French publishers. He designed the cuts in a German\r\nedition of the Bible, printed in 1560; most of the portraits of the\r\nKings of France in a work published at Nuremberg in 1566; a series of\r\ncuts for Esop’s fables; and the illustrations of an edition of Reusner’s\r\nEmblems. Several cuts with the mark of Virgil Solis are to be found in\r\nthe first edition of Archbishop Parker’s Bible, printed by Richard\r\nJugge, folio, London, 1568. In the second edition, 1572, there are two\r\nornamented initial letters, apparently of his designing, which seem to\r\nshow that his sacred and profane subjects were liable to be confounded,\r\nand that cuts originally designed for an edition of Ovid might by some\r\nsingular oversight be used in an edition of the Bible, although printed\r\nunder the especial superintendence of a Right Reverend Archbishop. In\r\nthe letter G, which forms the commencement of the first chapter of St.\r\nPaul’s Epistle to the Hebrews, the subject represented by the artist is\r\nLeda caressed by Jupiter in the form of a swan; and in the letter T at\r\nthe commencement of the first chapter of the Epistle General of St.\r\nJohn, the subject is Venus before Jove, with Cupid, Juno, Mars, Neptune,\r\nand other Heathen deities in attendance.[VI-82]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-82: This last letter contains the mark [[SA]], which\r\n    is to be found on some of the cuts in the editions of the Dance of\r\n    Death printed at Cologne, 1555-1572.]\r\n\r\nA series of wood-cuts designed by Virgil Solis, illustrative of Ovid’s\r\nMetamorphoses, was published at Frankfort, in oblong quarto, by George\r\nCorvinus, Sigismund Feyerabend, and the heirs of Wigand Gallus, in 1569.\r\nEach cut is surrounded by a heavy ornamental border; above each are four\r\nverses in Latin, and underneath four in German, composed by Johannes\r\nPosthius, descriptive of the subject. In the title-page,[VI-83] which is\r\nboth in Latin and in German, it is stated that they are\r\n_designed_--_gerissen_--by Virgil Solis for the use and benefit of\r\npainters, goldsmiths, and statuaries. It is thus evident that they were\r\nnot engraved by him; and in corroboration of this opinion it may be\r\nobserved that several of them, in addition to his mark, [Symbol], also\r\ncontain another, [Symbol], which is doubtless that of the wood engraver.\r\nThe latter mark occurs frequently in the cuts designed by Virgil Solis,\r\nin the first edition of Archbishop Parker’s Bible.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-83: The title is as follows: “Johan. Posthii\r\n    Germershemii Tetrasticha in Ovidii Metam. Lib. xv. Quibus\r\n    accesserunt Vergilii Solis figuræ elegantissimæ, primum in lucem\r\n    editæ.--Schöne Figuren, auss dem fürtrefflichen Poeten Ovidio,\r\n    allen Malern, Goldtschmiden, und Bildthauern, zu nutz und gutem\r\n    mit fleiss gerissen durch Vergilium Solis, und mit Teutschen\r\n    Reimen kürtzlich erkläret, dergleichein vormals im Druck nie\r\n    aussgangen, Durch Johan. Posthium von Germerssheim. M.D.LXIX.”]\r\n\r\nEvelyn, in his Sculptura, has the following notice of this artist:\r\n“Virgilius Solis graved also in wood _The story of the Bible_ and _The\r\nmechanic arts_ in little; but for imitating those vile postures of\r\nAretine had his eyes put out by the sentence of the magistrate.” There\r\nis scarcely a page of this writer’s works on art which does not contain\r\nsimilar inaccuracies, and yet he is frequently quoted and referred to as\r\nan authority. The “mechanic arts” to which Evelyn alludes were probably\r\nthe series of cuts designed by Jost Amman, and first published in\r\nquarto, at Frankfort, in 1564; and the improbable story of Virgil Solis\r\nhaving had his eyes put out for copying Julio Romano’s obscene designs,\r\nengraved by Marc Antonio, and illustrated with sonnets by the scurrilous\r\nribald, Pietro Aretine, is utterly devoid of foundation. No such copies\r\nhave ever been mentioned by any well-informed writer on art, and there\r\nis not the slightest evidence of Virgil Solis ever having been punished\r\nin any manner by the magistrates of his native city, Nuremberg, where he\r\ndied in 1570.\r\n\r\nWood-cuts with the mark of Melchior Lorich are comparatively scarce. He\r\nwas a native of Flensburg in Holstein, and was born in 1527. He obtained\r\na knowledge of painting and copper-plate engraving at Leipsic, and\r\nafterwards travelled with his master through some of the northern\r\ncountries of Europe. He afterwards visited Vienna, and subsequently\r\nentered into the service of the Palsgrave Otho, in whose suite he\r\nvisited Holland, France, and Italy. In 1558 he went with the Imperial\r\nambassador to Constantinople, where he remained three years. His\r\nprincipal works engraved on wood consist of a series of illustrations of\r\nthe manners and customs of the Turks, published about 1570. There is a\r\nvery clever cut, a Lady splendidly dressed, with his mark and the date\r\n1551; it is printed on what is called a “broadside,” and underneath is a\r\ncopy of verses by Hans Sachs, the celebrated shoemaker and\r\n_meistersänger_ of Nuremberg,[VI-84] entitled “_Eer und Lob einer schön\r\nwolgezierten Frawen_”--The Honour and Praise of a beautiful well-dressed\r\nwoman. A large cut of the Deluge, in two sheets, is considered one of\r\nthe best of his designing. Among the copper-plates engraved by Melchior\r\nLorich, a portrait of Albert Durer, and two others, of the Grand Signior\r\nand his favourite Sultana, are among the most scarce. The time of his\r\ndeath is uncertain, but Bartsch thinks that he was still living in 1583,\r\nas there are wood-cuts with his mark of that date.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-84: Hans Sachs, whose poetical works might vie in\r\n    quantity with those of Lope Vega, was born at Nuremberg in 1494.\r\n    Notwithstanding the immense number of verses which he composed, he\r\n    did not trust to his profession of Meistersänger for the means of\r\n    living, but continued to carry on his business as a shoemaker till\r\n    his death, which happened in 1576. His verses were much admired by\r\n    his contemporaries; and between 1570 and 1579, a collection of his\r\n    works was published in five volumes folio. Several short pieces by\r\n    him were originally printed as “broadsides,” with an ornamental or\r\n    illustrative cut at the top.]\r\n\r\nJost Amman, one of the best designers on wood of the period in which he\r\nlived, was born at Zurich in 1539, but removed to Nuremberg about\r\n1560.[VI-85] His designs are more bold, and display more of the vigour\r\nof the older German masters, than those of his contemporary Virgil\r\nSolis. A series of cuts designed by him, illustrative of professions and\r\ntrades, was published in 1564, quarto, with the title “Hans Sachse\r\neigentliche Beschreibung aller Stände auf Erden--aller Künste und\r\nHandwerker,” &c.--that is, Hans Sachs’s correct Description of all\r\nRanks, Arts, and Trades; and another edition in duodecimo, with the\r\ndescriptions in Latin, appeared in the same year.[VI-86] For the\r\ncorrectness of the date of those editions I am obliged to rely on\r\nHeineken, as I have never seen a copy of either; the earliest edition\r\nwith Hans Sachs’s descriptions that has come under my notice is dated\r\n1574. In a duodecimo edition, 1568, and another of the same size, 1574,\r\nthe descriptions, by Hartman Schopper, are in Latin verse.[VI-87] This\r\nis perhaps the most curious and interesting series of cuts, exhibiting\r\nthe various ranks and employments of men, that ever was published. Among\r\nthe higher orders, constituting what the Germans call the “_Lehre und\r\nWehr Stande_”--teachers and warriors--are the Pope, Emperor, King,\r\nPrinces, Nobles, Priests, and Lawyers; while almost every branch of\r\nlabour or of trade then known in Germany, from agriculture to\r\npin-making, has its representative. There are also not a few which it\r\nwould be difficult to reduce to any distinct class, as they are neither\r\ntrades nor honest professions. Of those heteroclytes is the “Meretricum\r\nprocurator--der Hurenweibel”--or, as Captain Dugald Dalgetty says, “the\r\ncaptain of the Queans.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-85: Papillon, who appears to have been extremely\r\n    wishful to swell his catalogue of wood engravers, describes Jost\r\n    Amman of Zurich and Jost Amman of Nuremberg as two different\r\n    persons.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-86: Heineken, Idée Générale, p. 244.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-87: The following is the title of the edition of\r\n    1568;--that of 1574 is somewhat different. “ΠΑΝΟΠΛΙΑ omnium\r\n    Illiberalium mechanicarum aut sedentariarum artium, continens\r\n    quotquot unquam vel a veteribus, aut nostri etiam seculi\r\n    celebritate excogitari potuerunt, breviter et dilucide confecta:\r\n    carminum liber primus, tum mira varietate rerum vocabulorumque\r\n    novo more excogitatorum copia perquam utilis, lectuque jucundus.\r\n    Accesserunt etiam venustissimæ Imagines omnes omnium artificum\r\n    negociantes ad vivum lectori representantes, antehac nec visæ\r\n    nec unquam æditæ: per Hartman Schopperum, Novoforens. Noricum.\r\n    --Frankofurti ad Moenum, cum privelegio Cæsario, M.D.LXVIII.”]\r\n\r\nThe subject of the following cut, which is of the same size as the\r\noriginal, is a _Briefmaler_,--literally, a card-painter, the name by\r\nwhich the German wood engravers were known before they adopted the more\r\nappropriate one of _Formschneider_. It is evident, that, at the time\r\nwhen the cut was engraved, the two professions were distinct:[VI-88] we\r\nhere perceive the Briefmaler employed, not in engraving cuts, but\r\nengaged in colouring certain figures by means of a _stencil_,--that is,\r\na card or thin plate of metal, out of which the intended figure is cut.\r\nA brush charged with colour being drawn over the pierced card, as is\r\nseen in the cut, the figure is communicated to the paper placed\r\nunderneath. The little shallow vessels perceived on the top of the large\r\nbox in front are the saucers which contain his colours. Near the window,\r\nimmediately to his right, is a pile of sheets which, from the figure of\r\na man on horseback seen impressed upon them, appear to be already\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-88: The _Briefmalers_, though at that time evidently\r\n    distinct from the _Formschneiders_, still continued to _print_\r\n    wood-cuts. On several large wood-cuts with the dates 1553 and 1554\r\n    we find the words, “Gedrukt zu Nürnberg durch Hanns Glaser,\r\n    _Brieffmaler_.”]\r\n\r\nThe subject of the following cut, from the same work, is a\r\n_Formschneider_, or wood engraver proper. He is apparently at work on a\r\nblock which he has before him; but the kind of tool which he employs is\r\nnot exactly like those used by English wood engravers of the present\r\nday. It seems to resemble a small long-handled desk-knife; while the\r\ntool of the modern wood engraver has a handle which is rounded at the\r\ntop in order to accommodate it to the palm of the hand. It is also never\r\nheld vertically, as it appears in the hand of the _Formschneider_. It\r\nis, however, certain, from other woodcuts, which will be subsequently\r\nnoticed, that the wood engravers of that period were accustomed to use a\r\ntool with a handle rounded at the top, similar to the graver used in the\r\npresent day.[VI-89]--The verses descriptive of the annexed cut are\r\ntranslated from Hans Sachs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  I am a wood-engraver good,\r\n  And all designs on blocks of wood\r\n  I with my graver cut so neat,\r\n  That when they’re printed on a sheet\r\n  Of paper white, you plainly view\r\n  The very forms the artist drew:\r\n  His drawing, whether coarse or fine,\r\n  Is truly copied line for line.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-89: See the mark C. S. at page 413.]\r\n\r\nJost Amman died in 1591, and from the time of his settling at Nuremberg\r\nto that of his decease he seems to have been chiefly employed in making\r\ndesigns on wood for the booksellers of Nuremberg and Frankfort. He also\r\nfurnished designs for goldsmiths; and it is said that he excelled as a\r\npainter on glass. The works which afford the best specimens of his\r\ntalents as a designer on wood are those illustrative of the costume of\r\nthe period, first published between 1580 and 1585 by S. Feyerabend at\r\nFrankfort. One of those works contains the costumes of men of all ranks,\r\nexcept the clergy, interspersed with the armorial bearings of the\r\nprincipal families in Germany; another contains the costume of the\r\ndifferent orders of the priesthood of the church of Rome; and a third,\r\nentitled Gynæceum sive Theatrum Mulierum, is illustrative of the costume\r\nof women of all ranks in Europe. A work on hunting and fowling, edited\r\nby J. A. Lonicerus, and printed in 1582, contains about forty excellent\r\ncuts of his designing. A separate volume, consisting of cuts selected\r\nfrom the four preceding works, and of a number of other cuts chiefly\r\nillustrative of mythological subjects and of the costume of Turkey, was\r\npublished by Feyerabend about 1590. In a subsequent edition of this\r\nwork, printed in 1599, it is stated that the collection is published for\r\nthe especial benefit of painters and amateurs.[VI-90] Among the numerous\r\nother cuts designed by him, the following may be mentioned:\r\nillustrations for a Bible published at Frankfort 1565; a series of\r\nsubjects from Roman History, entitled Icones Livianæ, 1572; and the cuts\r\nin an edition of Reynard the Fox. The works of Jost Amman have proved a\r\nmine for succeeding artists; his figures were frequently copied by wood\r\nengravers in France, Italy and Flanders; and even some modern English\r\npaintings contain evidences of the artist having borrowed something more\r\nthan a hint from the figures of Jost Amman.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-90: This work is entitled “Kunstbüchlein,” and\r\n    consists entirely of cuts without any explanatory letter-press.\r\n    The first cut consists of a group of heads, drawn and engraved\r\n    with great spirit. On what appears something like a slab of stone\r\n    or wood--most unmeaningly and awkwardly introduced--are Jost\r\n    Amman’s initials, I.A., towards the top, and lower down the mark,\r\n    [[MF]] which is doubtless that of the engraver. This mark, with a\r\n    figure of a graver underneath, occurs on several of the other\r\n    cuts. The three following marks, with a graver underneath each,\r\n    also occur: L. F. C.S. G. H. These facts are sufficient to prove\r\n    that Jost Amman was not the engraver of the cuts which he\r\n    designed. In the edition of 1599 the cuts are said to have been\r\n    _drawn_ by “the late most excellent and celebrated artist, Jost\r\n    Amman of Nuremberg.”]\r\n\r\nJost Amman was undoubtedly one of the best professional designers on\r\nwood of his time; and his style bears considerable resemblance to that\r\nof Hans Burgmair as exemplified in the Triumphs of Maximilian. Many of\r\nhis figures are well drawn; but even in the best of his subjects the\r\nattitudes are somewhat affected and generally too violent; and this,\r\nwith an overstrained expression, makes his characters appear more like\r\nactors in a theatre than like real personages. In the cuts of the horse\r\nin the “Kunstbüchlein” the action of the animal is frequently\r\nrepresented with great spirit: but in points of detail the artist is as\r\nfrequently incorrect. Some of his very best designs are to be found\r\namong his equestrian subjects. His men generally have a good “seat,” and\r\nhis ladies seem to manage their heavy long-tailed steeds with great ease\r\nand grace.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the views of cities, in Sebastian Munster’s Cosmography--\r\nfirst published in folio, at Basle, 1550--contain two marks, one of the\r\ndesigner, and the other of the person by whom the subject was engraved,\r\nthe latter being frequently accompanied by a graver, thus: [H·H]; or\r\nwith two gravers of different kinds, thus: [·C·S·] This last mark, which\r\nalso occurs in Jost Amman’s Kunstbüchlein, is said to be that of\r\nChristopher Stimmer, a brother of Tobias Stimmer, a Swiss artist, who is\r\ngenerally described as a designer and engraver on wood. The cuts with\r\nthe former mark have been ascribed to Hans Holbein, but they bear not\r\nthe least resemblance to his style of design, and they have been\r\nassigned to him solely on account of the letters corresponding with the\r\ninitials of his name. Professor Christ’s Dictionary of Monograms, and\r\nPapillon’s Treatise on Wood-engraving, afford numerous instances of\r\nmarks being assigned to persons on no better grounds.\r\n\r\nA writer, in discussing the question, “Were Albert Durer, Lucas Cranach,\r\nHans Burgmair, and other old German artists, the engravers or only the\r\ndesigners of the cuts which bear their mark?” has been pleased to assert\r\nthat the mark of the actual engraver is usually distinguished by the\r\ngraver with which it is accompanied. This statement has been adopted and\r\nfurther disseminated by others; and many persons who have not an\r\nopportunity of judging for themselves, and who receive with implicit\r\ncredit whatever they find asserted in a Dictionary of Engravers, suppose\r\nthat from the time of Albert Durer, or even earlier, the figure of a\r\ngraver generally distinguishes the mark of the _formschneider_ or\r\nengraver on wood. So far, however, from this being a general rule, I am\r\nnot aware of any wood-cut which contains a graver in addition to a mark\r\nof an earlier date than those in Munster’s Cosmography, and the practice\r\nwhich appears to have been first introduced about that time never became\r\ngenerally prevalent. When the graver is thus introduced there can be no\r\ndoubt that it is intended to distinguish the mark of the engraver; but\r\nas at least ninety-nine out of every hundred marks on cuts executed\r\nbetween 1550 and 1600 are unaccompanied with a graver, it is exceedingly\r\ndoubtful in most cases whether the mark be that of the engraver or the\r\ndesigner.\r\n\r\nThe wood-cuts in Munster’s Cosmography are generally poor in design and\r\ncoarse in execution. One of the best is that representing an encounter\r\nof two armed men on horseback with the mark [Symbol], which also occurs\r\nin some of the cuts in Gesner’s History of Animals, printed at Zurich,\r\n1551-1558. This cut, as well as several others, is repeated in another\r\npart of the book, in the manner of the Nuremberg Chronicle, where the\r\nsame portrait or the same view is used to represent several different\r\npersons or places. The cuts are not precisely the same in every edition\r\nof Munster’s work, which was several times reprinted between 1550 and\r\n1570. Those which are substituted in the later editions are rather more\r\nneatly engraved.\r\n\r\nThe present cut is copied from one at page 49 of the first edition,\r\nwhere it is given as an illustration of a wonderful kind of tree said to\r\nbe found in Scotland, and from the fruit of which it was believed that\r\ngeese were produced. Munster’s account of this wonderful tree and its\r\nfruit is as follows; “In Scotland are found trees, the fruit of which\r\nappears like a ball of leaves. This fruit, falling at its proper time\r\ninto the water below, becomes animated, and turns to a bird which they\r\ncall the _tree goose_. This tree also grows in the island of Pomona [the\r\nlargest of the Orkneys], not far distant from Scotland towards the\r\nnorth. As old cosmographers--especially Saxo Grammaticus--mention this\r\ntree, it is not to be considered as a fiction of modern authors. Aeneas\r\nSylvius also notices this tree as follows: ‘We have heard that there was\r\na tree formerly in Scotland, which, growing by the margin of a stream,\r\nproduced fruit of the shape of ducks; that such fruit, when nearly ripe,\r\nfell, some into the water and some on land. Such as fell on land\r\ndecayed, but such as fell into the water quickly became animated,\r\nswimming below, and then flying into the air with feathers and wings.\r\nWhen in Scotland, having made diligent inquiry concerning this matter of\r\nKing James, a square-built man, and very fat,[VI-91] we found that\r\nmiracles always kept receding;--this wonderful tree is not found in\r\nScotland, but in the Orcades.’”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-91: It is uncertain if James I. or James II. be\r\n    meant. According to Sir Walter Scott, Aeneas Sylvius, afterwards\r\n    Pope Pius II, visited Scotland in 1448, when James II.--if\r\n    Chalmers be correct, Caledonia, vol. i. p. 831,--was scarcely\r\n    nineteen, and when his appearance was not likely to correspond\r\n    with the learned prelate’s description,--“hominem quadratum et\r\n    multa pinguedine gravem.”]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe bird said to be the produce of this tree is the “Bernacle Goose,\r\nClakis, or Tree Goose” of Bewick; and the pretended _tree_ from which it\r\nwas supposed to be produced was undoubtedly a testaceous insect,\r\na species of which, frequently found adhering to ships’ bottoms, is\r\ndescribed under the name of “Lepas _Anatifera_” by Linnæus, who thus\r\ncommemorates in the trivial name the old opinion respecting its winged\r\nand feathered fruit. William Turner, a native of Morpeth in\r\nNorthumberland, one of the earliest writers on British Ornithology,\r\nnotices the story of the Bernacle Goose being produced from “something\r\nlike a fungus proceeding from old wood lying in the sea.” He says it is\r\nmentioned by Giraldus Cambrensis in his description of Ireland, and that\r\nthe account of its being generated in this wonderful manner is generally\r\nbelieved by the people inhabiting the sea-coasts of England, Scotland,\r\nand Ireland. “But,” says Turner, “as it seemed not safe to trust to\r\npopular report, and as, on account of the singularity of the thing,\r\nI could not give entire credit to Giraldus, I, when thinking of the\r\nsubject of which I now write, asked a certain clergyman, named\r\nOctavianus, by birth an Irishman, whom I knew to be worthy of credit, if\r\nhe thought the account of Giraldus was to be believed. He, swearing by\r\nthe Gospel, declared that what Giraldus had written about the generation\r\nof this bird was most true; that he himself had seen and handled the\r\nyoung unformed birds, and that if I should remain in London a month or\r\ntwo, he would bring me some of the brood.”[VI-92] In Lobel and Pena’s\r\nStirpium Adversaria Nova, folio, London, 1570, there is a cut of the\r\n“Britannica Concha Anatifera,” growing on a stalk from a rock, with\r\nfigures of ducks or geese in the water below. In the text the popular\r\nbelief of a kind of goose being produced from the shell of this insect\r\nis noticed, but the writer declines pronouncing any opinion till he\r\nshall have had an opportunity of visiting Scotland and judging for\r\nhimself. Gerard, in his Herbal, London, 1597, has an article on the\r\n_Goose-tree_; and he says that its native soil is a small island, called\r\nthe Pile of Fouldres, half a mile from the main land of Lancashire.\r\nFerrer de Valcebro, a Spanish writer, in a work entitled “El Gobierno\r\ngeneral hallado en las Aves,” with coarse wood-cuts, quarto, printed\r\nabout 1680, repeats, with sundry additions, the story of the Bernacle,\r\nor, as he calls it, the Barliata, being produced from a tree; and he\r\nseems rather displeased that his countrymen are not disposed to yield\r\nmuch faith to such singularities, merely because they do not occur in\r\ntheir own country.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-92: “Avium præcipuarum, quarum apud Plinium et\r\n    Aristotelem mentio est, brevis et succincta historia. Per Dn.\r\n    Gulielmum Turnerum, artium et medicinæ doctorem,” 8vo. Coloniæ,\r\n    M.D.XLIIII, fol. 9 _b_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere are two portraits of Erasmus in the first edition of Munster’s\r\nCosmography, one at page 130, and the other, with the mark [[HRMD]], at\r\npage 407. The latter, as the author especially informs the reader, was\r\nengraved after a portrait by Holbein in the possession of Bonifacius\r\nAmerbach. The present is a reduced copy of a cut at page 361 of Henry\r\nPetri’s edition, 1554. On a stone, near the bottom, towards the left, is\r\nseen a mark[VI-93]--probably that of the artist who made the drawing on\r\nthe block--consisting of the same letters as the double mark just\r\nnoticed as occurring in the portrait of Erasmus, H.R. M.D. A cut of the\r\nsame subject, William Tell about to shoot at the apple on his son’s\r\nhead, was given in the first edition, but the design is somewhat\r\ndifferent and the execution more coarse. The cut from which the\r\npreceding is copied may be ranked among the best in the work.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-93: In Professor Christ’s Dictionary of Monograms\r\n    this mark is ascribed, though doubtfully, to “Manuel Deutsch.” It\r\n    is certainly not the mark of Nicholas Emanuel Deutsch of Bern, for\r\n    he died several years before 1548, the date on several of the cuts\r\n    with the mark H.R. M.D. in Munster’s Cosmography, and which date\r\n    evidently relates to the year in which the artist made the\r\n    drawing. There can be no doubt that those four letters belong to a\r\n    single name, for some of the cuts in which they occur also contain\r\n    the mark of an engraver.]\r\n\r\nThough Sebastian Munster, in a letter, probably written in 1538,\r\naddressed to Joachim Vadianus, alludes to an improvement which he and\r\nhis printer had made in the mode of printing maps, and to a project for\r\ncasting complete words, yet the maps which appear in his Cosmography,\r\nwith the outlines, rivers, and mountains engraved on wood, and the names\r\ninserted in type, are certainly not superior to the generality of other\r\nmaps executed wholly on wood about the same period.[VI-94] Joachim\r\nVadianus, to whom Munster writes, and of whose assistance he wished to\r\navail himself in a projected edition of Ptolemy, was an eminent scholar\r\nof that period, and had published an edition, in 1522, of Pomponius\r\nMela, with a commentary and notes. The passage in Munster’s letter,\r\nwherein maps are mentioned, is to the following effect: “I would have\r\nsent you an impression of one of the Swiss maps which I have had printed\r\nhere, if Froschover had not informed me of his having sent you one from\r\nZurich. If this mode of printing should succeed tolerably well, and when\r\nwe shall have acquired a certain art of _casting whole words_, Henri\r\nPetri, Michael Isengrin, and I have thought of printing Ptolemy’s\r\nCosmography; not of so great a size as it has hitherto been frequently\r\nprinted, but in the form in which your Annotations on Pomponius appear.\r\nIn the maps we shall insert only the names of the principal cities, and\r\ngive the others alphabetically in some blank space,--for instance, in\r\nthe margin or any adjoining space beyond the limits of the map.”[VI-95]\r\nThe art of casting whole words, alluded to in this passage, appears to\r\nhave been something like an attempt at what has been called “logographic\r\nprinting;”[VI-96] though it is not unlikely that those “whole words”\r\nmight be the names of countries and places intended to be inserted in a\r\nspace cut out of the block on which the map was engraved. By thus\r\ninserting the names, either cast as complete words, or composed of\r\nseparate letters, the tedious process of engraving a number of letters\r\non wood was avoided, and the pressman enabled to print the maps at one\r\nimpression. In some of the earlier maps where the names are printed from\r\ntypes, the letters were not inserted in spaces cut out of the block, but\r\nwere printed from a separate form by means of a “re-iteration” or second\r\nimpression.[VI-97] In illustration of what Munster says about a certain\r\nart of casting whole words,--“_artem aliquam fundendarum integrarum\r\ndictionum_,”--the following extract is given from Dr. Dibdin’s\r\nBibliographical Tour, volume iii. page 102, second edition. “What think\r\nyou of undoubted proofs of STEREOTYPE PRINTING in the middle of the\r\nsixteenth century? It is even so. What adds to the whimsical puzzle is,\r\nthat these pieces of metal, of which the surface is composed of types,\r\nfixed and immovable, are sometimes inserted in wooden blocks, and\r\nintroduced as titles, mottoes, or descriptions of the subjects cut upon\r\nthe blocks. Professor May [of Augsburg] begged my acceptance of a\r\nspecimen or two of the types thus fixed upon plates of the same metal.\r\nThey rarely exceeded the height of four or five lines of text, by about\r\nfour or five inches in length. I carried away, with his permission, two\r\nproofs (not long ago pulled) of the same block containing this\r\nintermixture of stereotype and wood-block printing.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-94: A map of Russia, engraved wholly on wood, in a\r\n    work entitled “Commentari della Moscovia e parimente della\r\n    Russia,” &c. translated from the Latin of Sigmund, Baron von\r\n    Herberstein, printed at Venice, 4to. 1550, is much superior in\r\n    point of appearance to the best in the work of Munster. This map,\r\n    which is of folio size, appears to have been constructed by\r\n    “Giacomo Gastaldo, Piamontese, Cosmographo in Venetia.” The work\r\n    also contains six wood-cuts, which afford some curious specimens\r\n    of Russian and Tartar arms and costume.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-95: Philologicarum Epistolarum Centuria una, ex\r\n    Bibliotheca M. H. Goldasti, p. 165. 8vo. Francofurti, 1610.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-96: According to this method, certain words, together\r\n    with radices and terminations of frequent occurrence, were cast\r\n    entire, and not in separate letters, and placed in cases in such\r\n    an order that the compositor could as “readily possess himself of\r\n    the Type of a word as of the Type of a single letter.” This\r\n    method, for which a patent was obtained, is explained in a\r\n    pamphlet entitled “An Introduction to Logography: or the Art of\r\n    Arranging and Composing for Printing with Words entire, their\r\n    Radices and Terminations, instead of single Letters. By Henry\r\n    Johnson: London, printed Logographically, and sold by J. Walter,\r\n    bookseller, Charing Cross, and J. Sewell, Cornhill,\r\n    M.DCC.LXXXIII.” Several works were printed in this manner, and\r\n    among others an edition of Anderson’s History of Commerce, 4 vols.\r\n    4to. 1787-1789, by John Walter, at the Logographic Press,\r\n    Printing-House-Square, Blackfriars. Logography has long been\r\n    abandoned. The following account of this art is given in H. G.\r\n    Bohn’s Lecture on Printing, pp. 88, 89. “Something akin to\r\n    stereotyping is another mode of printing called Logography,\r\n    invented by the late Mr. Walter, of the _Times_, in 1783, and for\r\n    which he took out a patent. This means a system of printing from\r\n    type cast in words instead of single letters, which it was thought\r\n    would save time and corrections when applied to newspapers, but it\r\n    was not found to answer. A joke of the time was a supposed order\r\n    to the typefounder for some words of frequent occurrence, which\r\n    ran thus:--‘Please send me a hundred-weight, sorted, of murder,\r\n    fire, dreadful robbery, atrocious outrage, fearful calamity,\r\n    alarming explosion, melancholy accident; an assortment of\r\n    honourable member, whig, tory, hot, cold, wet, dry; half-a-hundred\r\n    weight, made up in pounds, of butter, cheese, beef, mutton, tripe,\r\n    mustard, soap, rain, &c.; and a few devils, angels, women, groans,\r\n    hisses, &c.’ This method of printing did not succeed: for if\r\n    twenty-four letters will give six hundred sextillions of\r\n    combinations, no printing office could keep a sufficient\r\n    assortment of even popular words.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-97: See an edition of Ptolemy, printed at Venice by\r\n    Jacobus Pentius de Leucho, in 1511, previously noticed at page\r\n    203.]\r\n\r\nAs the engraving of the letters in maps executed on wood--or indeed on\r\nany other material--is, when the names of many places are given, by far\r\nthe most tedious and costly part of the process, the plan of inserting\r\nthem in type by means of holes pierced in the block, as adopted in\r\nMunster’s Cosmography, was certainly a great saving of labour; yet on\r\ncomparing the maps in this work with those in Ptolemy’s Cosmography,\r\nprinted by Leonard Holl, at Ulm, 1482, and with others engraved in the\r\nearly part of the sixteenth century, it is impossible not to perceive\r\nthat the art of wood engraving, as applied to the execution of such\r\nworks, had undergone no improvement: with the exception of the letters,\r\nthe maps in Holl’s Ptolemy--the earliest that were engraved on\r\nwood--are, in point of appearance, equal to those in the work of\r\nMunster, published about eighty years later. Considering that the\r\nearliest printed maps--those in an edition of Ptolemy, printed by Arnold\r\nBukinck, at Rome, 1478[VI-98]--are from copper-plates, it seems rather\r\nsurprising that, until about 1570, no further attempt should have been\r\nmade to apply the art of engraving on copper to this purpose. In the\r\nlatter year a collection of maps, engraved on copper,[VI-99] was\r\npublished at Antwerp under the superintendence of Abraham Ortelius; and\r\nso great was their excellence when compared with former maps executed on\r\nwood, that the business of map engraving was within a few years\r\ntransferred almost exclusively to engravers on copper. In 1572 a map\r\nengraved on copper was printed in England, in the second edition of\r\nArchbishop Parker’s Bible. It is of folio size, and the country\r\nrepresented is the Holy Land. Within an ornamented tablet is the\r\nfollowing inscription: “Graven bi Humfray Cole, goldsmith, an English\r\nman born in y^e north, and pertayning to y^e mint in the Tower. 1572.”\r\nIn Walpole’s Catalogue of Engravers the portraits engraved on copper of\r\nQueen Elizabeth, the Earl of Leicester, and Lord Burleigh, which appear\r\nin the first edition of Archbishop Parker’s Bible, 1568,[VI-100] are\r\nascribed to Humphrey Cole, apparently on no better ground than that his\r\nname appears as the engraver of the map, which is given in the second.\r\nIf Cole were really the engraver of those portraits, he was certainly\r\nentitled to a more favourable notice[VI-101] than he receives from the\r\nfastidious compiler of the “Catalogue of Engravers who have been born or\r\nresided in England;” for, considering _when_ and _where_ they were\r\nexecuted, the engraver is entitled to rank at least as high as George\r\nVertue. In fact, the portrait of Leicester, considered merely as a\r\nspecimen of engraving, without regard to the time and place of its\r\nexecution, will bear a comparison with more than one of the portraits\r\nengraved by Vertue upwards of a hundred and fifty years later.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-98: Some account of this work is given at page 200.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-99: At page 204 it is stated, on the authority of\r\n    Breitkopf, that those maps were engraved by Ægidius Diest.\r\n    Ortelius himself says in the preface that they were engraved by\r\n    “Francis Hogenberg, Ferdinand and Ambrose Arsens, and others.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-100: The portrait of Queen Elizabeth appears on the\r\n    title; the Earl of Leicester’s is prefixed to the Book of Joshua;\r\n    and Lord Burleigh’s is given, with a large initial B, at the\r\n    beginning of the first psalm. In the second edition, 1572, the\r\n    portrait of Lord Burleigh is omitted, and the impressions of the\r\n    other two are much inferior to those in the first edition in\r\n    consequence of the plates being worn. Many of the cuts in the\r\n    second edition are quite different from those in the first, and\r\n    generally inferior to the cuts for which they are substituted.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-101: “Humphrey Cole, as he says himself, was born in\r\n    the North of England, and _pertayned to the mint in the Tower_,\r\n    1572. I suppose he was one of the engravers that _pertayned_ to\r\n    Archbishop Parker, for this edition was called Matthew Parker’s\r\n    Bible. I hope the flattery of the favourites was the incense of\r\n    the engraver!” Catalogue of Engravers, p. 16. Edit. 1794.--Walpole\r\n    does not appear to have paid the least attention to the engraver’s\r\n    merits--supposing, as he does, the portraits to have been executed\r\n    by him:--he sneers at him because he had engraved certain\r\n    portraits for a _Bible_, and because he was supposed to have been\r\n    patronised by a _bishop_. A more liberal writer on art would have\r\n    praised Parker, although he were an _archbishop_, for his\r\n    patronage of a native engraver.]\r\n\r\nThe advantages of copper-plate engraving for the purpose of executing\r\nmaps, as exemplified in the work of Ortelius, appear to have been\r\nimmediately appreciated in England, and this country is one of the first\r\nthat can boast of a collection of provincial or county maps engraved on\r\ncopper. A series of maps of all the counties of England and Wales, and\r\nof the adjacent islands, were engraved, under the superintendence of\r\nChristopher Saxton, between 1573 and 1579, and published at London, in a\r\nfolio volume, in the latter year. Though the greater number of those\r\nmaps were the work of Flemish engravers, eight, at least, were engraved\r\nby two Englishmen, Augustine Ryther and Nicholas Reynolds.[VI-102] They\r\nappear to have been all drawn by Christopher Saxton, who lived at\r\nTingley, near Leeds. Walpole says, that “he was servant to Thomas\r\nSekeford, Esq. Master of the Court of Wards,” the gentleman at whose\r\nexpense they were engraved. He also states that many of them were\r\nengraved by Saxton himself; but this I consider to be extremely\r\ndoubtful. In his account of early English copper-plate engravers,\r\nWalpole is frequently incorrect: he mentions Humphrey Lhuyd--an author\r\nwho wrote a short description of Britain, printed at Cologne in\r\n1572[VI-103]--as the _engraver_ of the map of England in the collection\r\nof Ortelius; and he includes Dr. William Cuningham, a physician of\r\nNorwich, in his catalogue of engravers, without the slightest reason\r\nbeyond the mere fact, that a book entitled “The Cosmographical Glasse,”\r\nwritten by the Doctor, and printed in 1559, contains several\r\n_wood-cuts_. He might, with equal justice, have placed Archbishop Parker\r\nin his catalogue, and asserted that some of the _plates_ in the Bible\r\nwere “engraved by his own hand.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-102: “Augustinus Ryther, _Anglus_,” occurs on the\r\n    maps of Cumberland and Westmorland, Gloucester, and Yorkshire.\r\n    Ryther afterwards kept a bookseller’s shop in Leadenhall-street.\r\n    He engraved some maps and charts, which were published about 1588.\r\n    On the map of the county of Hertford, Reynolds’s name occurs thus:\r\n    “Nicholas Reynoldus, Londinensis, sculpsit.” Several of those maps\r\n    were engraved by Remigius Hogenberg, one of the engravers who are\r\n    said to have been employed by Archbishop Parker in his palace at\r\n    Lambeth.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-103: This little work, entitled “Commentarioli\r\n    Britannicæ Descriptionis Fragmentum,” was sent by the author to\r\n    Ortelius, and the prefatory address is dated Denbigh, in North\r\n    Wales, 30th August 1568. A translation of it, under the title of a\r\n    “Breviary of Britain,” was printed at London in 1573.--Lhuyd had\r\n    only furnished Ortelius with materials for the construction of the\r\n    map of England.]\r\n\r\nIn connexion with the preceding account of the earliest maps executed in\r\nEngland on copper, it perhaps may not be unnecessary to briefly notice\r\nhere the introduction of copper-plate engraving into this country.\r\nAccording to Herbert, in his edition of Ames’s Typographical\r\nAntiquities, the frontispiece of a small work entitled “Galenus de\r\nTemperamentis,” printed at Cambridge, 1521, is the earliest specimen of\r\ncopper-plate engraving that is to be found in any book printed in\r\nEngland. The art, however, supposing that the plate was really engraved\r\nand printed in this country, appears to have received no encouragement\r\non its first introduction, for after this first essay it seems to have\r\nlain dormant for nearly twenty years. The next earliest specimens appear\r\nin the first edition of a work usually called “Raynalde’s Birth of\r\nMankind,” printed at London in 1540.[VI-104] This work, which is a\r\ntreatise on the obstetric art, contains, when perfect, three plates,\r\nillustrative of the subject. Not having had an opportunity of seeing any\r\none of these three plates nor the frontispiece to “Galenus de\r\nTemperamentis,” I am obliged to trust to Herbert for the fact of their\r\nbeing engraved on copper. In the third volume of his edition of Ames,\r\npage 1411, there is a fac-simile of the frontispiece to the Cambridge\r\nbook; and in the Preliminary Disquisition on Early Engraving and\r\nOrnamental Printing, prefixed to Dr. Dibdin’s edition of the\r\nTypographical Antiquities, will be found a fac-simile, engraved on wood,\r\nof one of the plates in Raynalde’s Birth of Mankind. In an edition of\r\nthe latter work, printed in 1565, the “byrthe figures” are not engraved\r\non copper, but on wood.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-104: The name of “Thomas Raynalde, Physition,” is not\r\n    to be found in the edition of 1540. The title of the work is, “The\r\n    byrth of Mankynd, newly translated out of Latin into Englysshe. In\r\n    the which is entreated of all suche thynges the which chaunce to\r\n    women in theyr labor,” &c. At folio vi. there is an address from\r\n    Richard Jonas, “Unto the most gracious, and in all goodnesse most\r\n    excellent vertuous Lady Quene Katheryne, wyfe and most derely\r\n    belovyd spouse unto the moste myghty sapient Christen prynce,\r\n    Kynge Henry the VIII.”--This “most excellent vertuous lady” was\r\n    _Catherine Howard_. The imprint at the end of the work is as\r\n    follows: “Imprynted at London, by T. R, Anno Domini, M.CCCCC.XL.”\r\n    Raynalde’s name first appears in the second edition, 1545. Between\r\n    1540 and 1600 there were at least eight editions of this work\r\n    printed in London.]\r\n\r\nA work printed in London by John Hereford, 1545, contains several\r\nunquestionable specimens of copper-plate engraving. It is of folio size,\r\nand the title is as follows: “Compendiosa totius Anatomiæ delineatio ære\r\nexarata, per Thomam Geminum.” The ornamental title-page, with the arms\r\nof Henry VIII. towards the centre, is engraved on copper, and several\r\nanatomical subjects are executed in the same manner. Gemini, who is\r\nbelieved to have been the engraver of those plates, was not a native of\r\nthis country.[VI-105] In a dedication to Henry VIII, he says that in his\r\nwork he had followed Andrew Vesalius of Brussels; and he further\r\nmentions that in the year before he had received orders from the King to\r\nhave the plates printed off [_excudendas_]. A second edition, dedicated\r\nto Edward VI, appeared in 1553; and a third, dedicated to Queen\r\nElizabeth, in 1559.[VI-106] In the last edition the Royal Arms on the\r\ntitle-page are effaced, and the portrait of Queen Elizabeth engraved in\r\ntheir stead. Traces of the former subject are, however, still visible,\r\nand the motto, “Dieu et mon Droit,” has been allowed to remain. One of\r\nthe engravings in this work affords a curious instance of the original\r\nplate of copper having been either mended or enlarged by joining another\r\npiece to it. Even in the first edition, the zigzag line where the two\r\npieces are joined, and the forms of the little _cramps_ which hold them\r\ntogether, are visible, and in the last they are distinctly apparent.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-105: At the end of the dedication to Henry VIII. he\r\n    signs himself “Thomas Geminus, Lysiensis.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-106: In the edition of 1559 there is a large\r\n    wood-cut--“Interiorum corporis humani partium viva\r\n    delineatio”--with the mark R. S. and a graver underneath. In this\r\n    cut the interior parts of the body are impressed on separate\r\n    slips, which are pasted, by one edge, at the side of the figure.\r\n    Those slips on being raised show the different parts as they occur\r\n    on dissection.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest portrait engraved on copper, printed singly, in this\r\ncountry, and not as an illustration of a book, is that of Archbishop\r\nParker engraved by Remigius Hogenberg. It is a small print four and a\r\nhalf inches high by three and a half wide. At the corners are the arms\r\nof Canterbury, impaled with those of Parker; the archbishop’s arms\r\nseparately; a plain shield, with a cross and the letters [[IX]]; and the\r\narms of Archbishop Cranmer. The portrait is engraved in an oval, round\r\nthe border of which is the following inscription: “Mūdus transit, et\r\ncupiscētia ejus. Anno Domini 1572, ætatis suæ Anno 69. Die mensis\r\nAugusti sexto.” In an impression, now before me, from the original\r\nplate, the date and the archbishop’s age are altered to 1573 and 70, but\r\nthe marks of the ciphers erased are quite perceptible. The portrait of\r\nthe archbishop is a half-length; he is seated at a table, on which are a\r\nbell, a small coffer, and what appears to be a stamp. A Bible is lying\r\nopen before him, and on one of the pages is inscribed in very small\r\nletters the following passage from the VI. chapter of Micah, verse 8:\r\n“Indicabo tibi, o homo, quid sit bonum, et quid Deus requirat a te,\r\nutique facere judicium, et diligere misericordiam, et solicitum ambulare\r\ncum Deo tuo.” The engraver’s name, “_R. Berg f._,” appears at the bottom\r\nof the print to the right: a cross line from the R to the B indicates\r\nthe abbreviation of the surname, which, written at length, was\r\n_Hogenberg_. Caulfield, speaking of this engraving in his\r\nCalcographiana, page 4, 1814, says,--“The only impression supposed to be\r\nextant is in the library at Lambeth Palace; but within the last two\r\nyears, Mr. Woodburn, of St. Martin’s Lane, purchased a magnificent\r\ncollection of portraits, among which was a very fine one of Parker.”\r\n\r\nThe number of books, containing copper-plate engravings, published in\r\nEngland between 1559 and 1600, is extremely limited; and the following\r\nlist will perhaps be found to contain one or two more than have been\r\nmentioned by preceding writers: 1. Pena and Lobel’s Stirpium Adversaria\r\nNova, folio, 1570,--ornamented title-page, with the arms of England at\r\nthe top, and a small map towards the bottom:--the ornaments surrounding\r\nthe map are very beautifully engraved. 2. Archbishop Parker’s Bible,\r\n1568-1572, with the portraits, previously noticed at page 419.\r\n3. Saxton’s Maps, with the portrait of Queen Elizabeth on the title,\r\n1579. 4. Broughton’s Concent of Scripture, 1591,--engraved title, and\r\nfour other plates. 5. Translation of Ariosto by Sir John Harrington,\r\n1591,--engraved title-page, containing portraits of the author and\r\ntranslator, and forty-six other plates. 6. R. Haydock’s Translation of\r\nLomazzo’s Treatise on Painting and Architecture, Oxford, 1598,--engraved\r\ntitle-page, containing portraits of Lomazzo and Haydock, and several\r\nvery indifferent plates, chiefly of architecture and figures in outline.\r\n\r\nWalpole mentions a plate of the arms of Sir Christopher Hatton on the\r\ntitle-page of the second part of Wagenar’s Mariner’s Mirrour, printed in\r\n1588, and the plates in a work entitled “A True Report of the\r\nNewfoundland of Virginia,” all engraved by Theodore de Bry. The first of\r\nthese works I have not been able to obtain a sight of;[VI-107] and the\r\nsecond cannot properly be included in a list of works containing\r\ncopper-plates published in England previous to 1600;[VI-108] for though\r\nit appeared in 1591, it was printed at Frankfort. In the reigns of James\r\nand Charles I, copper-plate engraving was warmly patronised in England,\r\nand several foreign engravers, as in the reign of Elizabeth, were\r\ninduced to take up their abode in this country. In the first edition of\r\nChambers’ Cyclopedia, it is stated that the art of copper-plate\r\nengraving was brought to this country from Antwerp by Speed the\r\nhistorian,--an error which is pointed out by Walpole: the writer it\r\nseems had not been aware of any earlier copper-plates printed in England\r\nthan Speed’s maps, which were chiefly executed by Flemish engravers.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-107: In Herbert’s edition of the Typographical\r\n    Antiquities, vol. iii. p. 1681, both parts of this work are said\r\n    to have engraved titles, and the arms of Sir C. Hatton are said to\r\n    occur at the back of the title to the first part. The work\r\n    contains twenty-two maps and charts, probably copied from the\r\n    original Dutch edition of Wagenar, who was a native of Enchuysen.\r\n    There is no printer’s name in the English edition.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-108: Walpole erroneously states that “Broughton’s\r\n    book was not printed till 1600,” and he says that “the _cuts_ were\r\n    probably engraved by an English artist named William Rogers.” The\r\n    mark [[WR]] is to be found on some of the plates of the edition of\r\n    1600, but it is to be observed that they are not the same as those\r\n    in the edition of 1591. The _first_ edition of the work was\r\n    printed in 1588.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  Ἡ ΜΕΓΑΛΗ ΕΥΔΑΙΜΟΝΙΑ ΟΥΔΕΝΙ ΦΘΟΝΕΙΝ / ÆTATIS 28]\r\n\r\nDr. William Cuningham, whom Walpole describes as an engraver, was a\r\nphysician practising at Norwich; and his book, entitled The\r\nCosmographical Glasse,[VI-109] some of the _plates_ of which are said to\r\nhave been “engraved by the doctor’s own hand,” was printed at London by\r\nJohn Day in 1559. It contains no _plates_, properly speaking, for the\r\nengravings are all from wood-blocks. At the foot of the ornamental\r\ntitle-page, and in a large bird’s-eye view of Norwich, is the mark I. B.\r\nF, which, from something like a tool for engraving, between the B. and F\r\nin the original, is most likely that of the engraver. The principal cut\r\nis a portrait of the author, a fac-simile of which is given in the\r\nopposite page.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-109: The following is the title of this work: “The\r\n    Cosmographical Glasse, conteinyng the pleasant Principles of\r\n    Cosmographie, Geographie, Hydrographie or Navigation. Compiled by\r\n    William Cuningham, Doctor in Physicke. Excussum Londini in\r\n    officina Joan. Daii, Anno 1559.\r\n\r\n      In this Glasse, if you will beholde\r\n        The starry skie and yearth so wide,\r\n      The seas also, with the windes so colde,\r\n        Yea, and thy selfe all these to guide:\r\n      What this Type mean first learne a right,\r\n        So shall the gayne thy travaill quight.”\r\n\r\n    The “_Type_” mentioned in these verses relates to the various\r\n    allegorical and other figures in the engraved title-page.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: A]\r\n\r\nIt is much more likely that some of those cuts were engraved by the\r\nprinter of the book, John Day, than by the author, Dr. Cuningham; for\r\nthe initials I. D. appear on a cut at the end of the book,--a skeleton\r\nextended on a tomb, with a tree growing out of it--and also on two or\r\nthree of the large ornamental letters. John Day, in a book printed by\r\nhim in 1567, says that the Saxon characters used in it were _cut_ by\r\nhimself. The cut on page 425 and the three following are specimens of\r\nsome of the large ornamental letters which occur in the Cosmographical\r\nGlasse. The first, the letter D, inclosing the arms of Lord Robert\r\nDudley, afterwards Earl of Leicester, to whom the work is dedicated.\r\nThe second, the letter A, Silenus on an ass, accompanied by satyrs; the\r\nmark, a C with a small I within the curve, is perceived near the bottom,\r\nto the right.[VI-110] The third, the letter I, with a military commander\r\ntaking the angles between three churches; and the mark I. D. at the\r\nbottom to the left. The fourth, the letter T, a ship with a naked figure\r\nas pilot, preceded by Neptune on a dolphin. A mark, H, is perceived in\r\nthe right-hand corner, at the bottom.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-110: This mark, which occurs in two other cuts of\r\n    large letters in the Cosmographical Glasse, is also to be found on\r\n    a large ornamented letter in Robert Record’s Castle of Knowledge,\r\n    folio, printed at London, by Reginald Wolfe, 1556. This work, like\r\n    that of Cuningham, is a treatise on Geography. A mark, I. C., with\r\n    a graver between the letters, occurs frequently in cuts which\r\n    ornament the margins of a work entitled “A Book of Christian\r\n    Prayers,” &c. 4to. first printed by John Day in 1569. It is\r\n    usually called “Queen Elizabeth’s Prayer Book.” In Herbert’s\r\n    edition of the Typographical Antiquities it is erroneously stated\r\n    that such of the cuts as relate to the History of Christ are\r\n    “after Albert Durer and his wife, _Agnes Frey_.” They are _not_\r\n    copied from any cuts designed by Albert Durer, and his wife most\r\n    certainly neither drew nor engraved on wood. It is also\r\n    incorrectly stated “that a Dance of Death, in the same work, is\r\n    after Hans Holbein.”--The cuts in this work are very unequal in\r\n    point of execution. The best are those of the Senses--without any\r\n    mark--Sight, Hearing, Taste, Smelling, and Touch. A mark not\r\n    unlike that in the letter A, from Cuningham’s Cosmographical\r\n    Glass, occurs on several of the smaller cuts.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: I]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: T]\r\n\r\nOf all the books printed in England in the reigns of Queen Mary and\r\nQueen Elizabeth, those from the press of John Day generally contain the\r\nbest executed wood-cuts; and even though he might not be the engraver of\r\nthe cuts which contain his initials, yet it cannot be doubted that he\r\npossessed a much better taste in such matters than any other English\r\nprinter of his age. Some of the large ornamental letters in works\r\nprinted by him are much superior to anything of the kind that had\r\npreviously appeared in England. In the “Booke of Christian Prayers”\r\nprinted by John Daye 1569, which goes by the name of “Queen Elizabeth’s\r\nPrayer Book,” there is a portrait of her Majesty, kneeling upon a superb\r\ncushion, with elevated hands, in prayer, of which the following is a\r\nfac-simile. The book is decorated with wood-cut borders of considerable\r\nspirit and beauty, representing, among other things, some of the\r\nsubjects of Holbein’s Dance of Death.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nOur next cut is a copy, slightly reduced, of a large letter, C, at the\r\ncommencement of the dedication of Fox’s Acts and Monuments to Queen\r\nElizabeth, in the edition printed by Day in 1576. The Queen, appearing\r\nmore juvenile than she is usually represented, is seen seated on a\r\nthrone, attended by three persons, supposed to be intended for one of\r\nher council, John Day, the printer, and John Fox, the author of the\r\nwork. A cherub, with an immense cornucopia over his shoulder, holds a\r\nrose and a lily in one hand, and with the other supports the arms of\r\nEngland; while underneath a representation of the Pope is introduced,\r\nholding in his hands the broken keys.[VI-111]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-111: This work contains a considerable number of\r\n    wood-cuts, all undoubtedly designed and engraved in England. Two\r\n    of the best are Henry VIII, attended by his council, giving his\r\n    sanction to the publication of the Bible in English, with the mark\r\n    I. F.; and a view of Windsor Castle, with the mark M. D. Both\r\n    these cuts are in the second volume of the edition of 1576.]\r\n\r\nThough it be beyond the plan of the present work to trace the progress\r\nof the various kinds of large ornamental letters engraved on wood that\r\nhave been from time to time introduced by the principal German, French,\r\nItalian, and English printers from the invention of typography, it may\r\nnot be unnecessary to say a few words on this subject. In the earliest\r\nworks of the German printers, as the type was a close imitation of the\r\nhandwriting of the period, as used in Bibles and Missals, the large\r\nornamental letters occasionally introduced are distinguished by their\r\nflourishes and grotesque work extending on the margin both above and\r\nbelow the body of the letter, as is frequently seen in illumined\r\nmanuscripts of the period. Large initial letters of this kind are not\r\nunfrequent in early French works; but are comparatively scarce in books\r\nprinted in England, where a letter, engraved on a square block,\r\nappearing, with the ornaments, white on a black ground, was adopted\r\nshortly after the introduction of printing by Caxton.[VI-112] As the\r\ncapitals of the Roman character used in Italy did not admit of the\r\nflourishes which accorded so well with the curves of Gothic or German\r\ncapitals, the printers of that country, towards the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury, began to introduce flowers, figures of men, birds, and\r\nquadrupeds, as back-grounds to their large initial letters. Between 1520\r\nand 1530 this mode of ornamenting their large Roman letters was in great\r\nrepute with the printers of Basle, Geneva, and Zurich, and to this taste\r\nwe owe the small alphabet of the Dance of Death. Subsequently the\r\nItalian wood engravers, employed by the printers, carried this style of\r\nornament a step further by introducing landscapes as well as figures to\r\nform a back-ground to the letter. The following specimen of letter thus\r\nornamented is from a work printed by Giolito at Venice about 1550. The\r\nlarge capitals, in Cuningham’s Cosmographical Glasse, were doubtless\r\nsuggested by Italian letters in the same taste.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-112: Dr. Dibdin, in his Preliminary Disquisition on\r\n    Early Engraving and Ornamental Printing, in his edition of Ames\r\n    and Herbert’s Typographical Antiquities, has given several curious\r\n    specimens of large ornamented capitals.]\r\n\r\nThe borders which appear in the title-pages of Italian books of this\r\nperiod, and more especially in those printed at Venice, frequently\r\ndisplay considerable excellence both in design and execution. They are\r\ngenerally much lighter and more varied in design than the borders in\r\nGerman books; and cross-hatching, which is seldom seen in Italian\r\nwood-cuts executed previous to 1520, is so frequently introduced that it\r\nwould seem that this mode of producing a certain effect--which might\r\noften have been accomplished by simpler means--was then considered as a\r\nproof of the engraver’s talent. Some of the Italian printers’ marks and\r\ndevices, on the title-page, or at the end of a work, are drawn and\r\nengraved with great spirit. The following devices occur in a folio\r\nedition of Dante--known to bibliographers as the _cat edition_--\r\npublished by the brothers Sessa, at Venice, in 1578. The smaller\r\ncut--with ornamental work on each side, occupying nearly the width\r\nof a page, but omitted in the copy--is several times repeated; the\r\nlarger--where Grimalkin “sits like an eastern monarch upon his\r\nthrone”[VI-113]--forms the tail-piece at the end of the volume.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-113: Bibliographical Decameron, vol. i. p. 289.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  DISSIMILIVM IN / FIDA SOTIETAS]\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, an Italian artist named Andrea Andreani executed a considerable\r\nnumber of chiaro-scuros on wood. He was born at Mantua in 1540, and one\r\nof his earliest and largest works in this style is dated 1586. The\r\nsubject is the History of Abraham, from the pavement of the cathedral of\r\nSiena;[VI-114] the first compartment consists of twelve pieces, printed\r\nin three colours, forming, when joined together, a large composition\r\nabout five feet six inches wide by about two feet six inches high. The\r\nsecond compartment, Moses breaking the Tables of the Law, is not\r\nproperly a chiaro-scuro, but a large wood-cut, consisting of several\r\npieces, printed in ink in the usual manner. It is about six feet wide by\r\nabout four feet high. Another large work of Andreani’s is the Triumphs\r\nof Julius Cæsar, from the designs of Andrea Mantegna, dedicated to\r\nVincentius Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, and published in a folio volume in\r\n1598. Andreani having obtained the blocks of several of the\r\nchiaro-scuros executed by Ugo da Carpi, Antonio da Trente, Nicholas da\r\nVincenza, and others, reprinted them with the addition of his own mark;\r\nand from this circumstance he frequently obtains the credit of having\r\nengraved many pieces which were really executed by his predecessors and\r\nsuperiors in the art. The chiaro-scuros which he reprinted are generally\r\nsuperior to those pieces which were engraved by himself from original\r\ndesigns, and in the execution of which he had to depend on his own\r\njudgment and taste. He continued to engrave in this manner till he was\r\nupwards of seventy years old, for there are one or two subjects by him\r\ndated 1612. Bartsch says that he died in 1623, but observes that some\r\nwriters place his death in 1626.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-114: “The pavement of this cathedral is the work of a\r\n    succession of artists from Duccio down to Meccarino, who have\r\n    produced the effect of the richest mosaic, merely by inserting\r\n    grey marble into white, and hatching both with black mastic. The\r\n    grandest composition is the History of Abraham, a figure which is\r\n    unfortunately multiplied in the same compartments; but, when\r\n    grasping the knife, the patriarch is truly sublime. These works\r\n    lay exposed at least for a hundred years to the general tread, and\r\n    have been rather improved than defaced by the attrition; for one\r\n    female figure which had never been trodden looks harsher than the\r\n    rest. Those of the choir were opportunely covered two centuries\r\n    ago.”--Forsyth’s Italy, p. 102, 2nd Edit.]\r\n\r\nHenry Goltzius, a painter and engraver, born in 1558, near Venloo, in\r\nFlanders, executed several chiaro-scuros, chiefly from his own designs.\r\nThe most of them are from three blocks; and among the best executed are\r\nHercules and Cacus, and four separate pieces representing the four\r\nelements. Like most of the other productions of this artist, whether\r\npaintings or copper-plate engravings, his chiaro-scuros are designed\r\nwith great spirit, though the action of the figures is frequently\r\nextravagant. He imitated Michael Angelo, but not with success; he too\r\nfrequently mistakes violence of action for the expression of\r\nintellectual grandeur, and displays the “contortions of the pythoness\r\nwithout her inspiration.” The cut in the opposite page is a reduced copy\r\nof the subject intended to represent the element of water. In the\r\noriginal the impression is from four blocks; one with the outlines and\r\nshaded parts black, as in the copy here given; the other three\r\ncommunicating different tints of sepia. Henry Goltzius died in 1617. His\r\nmark, an H combined with a G, is seen at the bottom of the cut.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe cuts contained in a work on ancient and modern costume, printed at\r\nVenice in 1590,[VI-115] are frequently described as having been drawn by\r\nTitian and engraved by his _brother_, Cesare Vecellio. That this person\r\nmight have been a relation of Titian, whose family name was Vecelli, is\r\nnot unlikely, but it is highly improbable that he was his brother; for\r\nTitian died in 1576, aged ninety-nine, and the dedication of the work to\r\nPietro Montalbano by Cesare Vecellio is dated October, 1589. In the\r\ntitle it is stated that the costumes in question were “done”-- _fatti_--\r\nby Vecellio himself; but whether this word relates to the drawing or the\r\nengraving, or to both, it would be exceedingly difficult to ascertain.\r\nThose cuts have the appearance of having been drawn on the block with\r\npen-and-ink; and some of the best display so much “character” that they\r\nlook like portraits of individuals freely sketched by the hand of a\r\nmaster. It was first stated in an edition of the work, printed in 1664,\r\nthat the cuts were drawn by Titian and engraved by Cesare Vecellio, his\r\nbrother. The improbable assertion was merely a bookseller’s trick to\r\nattract purchasers. It has also been frequently asserted, that the cuts\r\nin Vesalius’s Anatomy, printed at Basle in 1548, were drawn by Titian.\r\nThe Abbé Morelli has, however, shown that they were not drawn by him,\r\nbut by John Calcar, a Flemish painter, who had been one of his pupils.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-115: The following is the title of this work, which\r\n    is a large octavo: “De gli Habiti Antichi et Moderni di diverse\r\n    Parti del Mondo Libri due, fatti da Caesare Vecellio, & con\r\n    Discorsi da lui dichiriati. In Venetia, MD.XC.” This work is thus\r\n    mentioned in the notes to Rogers’s Italy: “Among the Habiti\r\n    Antichi, in that admirable book of wood-cuts ascribed to Titian,\r\n    (A. D. 1590,) there is one entitled Sposa Venetiana à Castello. It\r\n    was taken from an old painting in the Scuola di S. Giovanni\r\n    Evangelista, and by the writer is believed to represent one of the\r\n    brides here described.”--Italy, p. 257, note. Edit. 1830.]\r\n\r\nPapillon, who in his desire to dignify his art claims almost every\r\neminent painter as a wood engraver, pretends that Titian executed\r\nseveral large cuts from his own designs. He says that Titian began to\r\nengrave on wood when he was twenty-five years old [in 1502], and he\r\nmentions a cut of the Virgin and the infant Christ, with other\r\nfigures,--probably intended to represent the marriage of St.\r\nCatherine,--as one of the earliest specimens of his talents as a wood\r\nengraver. Papillon also informs us that Titian engraved a large cut of\r\nthe Triumph of Christ, or of Faith, in 1508; and in another part of his\r\nwork he describes several others as engraved by Titian himself.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the cuts after designs by Titian, but which were certainly\r\nnot of his engraving, are of large size, and executed in a free, coarse\r\nmanner, as if they were rather intended to paste against a wall than to\r\nbe inserted in a portfolio. One of the largest is the destruction of\r\nPharaoh and his host; it consists of several pieces, which, when united,\r\nform a complete subject about four and a half feet wide by about three\r\nfeet high. A dog, which the painter has introduced in a peculiar\r\nattitude,[VI-116] gives to the whole the air of burlesque. The person by\r\nwhom it was engraved styles himself “depintore,” a word perhaps intended\r\nto imply that he was a brother of the guild, or society of\r\npainter-stainers, stencillers, and wood engravers.[VI-117] His name,\r\nwith the date, is engraved thus at the bottom of the cut, which is one\r\nof those which Papillon says were executed by Titian himself: “In\r\nVenetia p. dominico dalle greche depintore venetiano. M.DXLIX.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-116: A dog performing the same act occurs as a\r\n    tail-piece in the first edition of Bewick’s Quadrupeds, 1790, page\r\n    310.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-117: I have seen a large head, which at first sight\r\n    might be mistaken for an impression from a wood-block, executed by\r\n    means of a stencil after a design of Correggio. It was\r\n    unquestionably old, and was about three feet high by two and a\r\n    half wide.]\r\n\r\nThe following is a reduced copy of a cut designed by Titian, and said to\r\nhave been intended by him to ridicule those painters who, not being able\r\nto succeed in colouring, recommended ancient sculptures, on account of\r\nthe correctness of the forms, as most deserving of a painter’s diligent\r\nstudy. The subject is a caricature of the Laocoon; and the professed\r\nadmirers of antiquity, who, above all, insisted on correct drawing, and\r\nthought slightly of colouring, are represented by the old ape wanting a\r\ntail, seen in the distance, attended by three of her young ones. The\r\noriginal cut is fifteen inches and seven-eighths wide by ten inches and\r\na half high. It is coarsely engraved, and contains neither name nor\r\ndate.[VI-118] There are several chiaro-scuros after designs by Titian,\r\nengraved by Boldrini, Andreani, and others.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-118: The following is Papillon’s description of this\r\n    cut: “Une Estampe que je possede, et que l’on regarde assez\r\n    indifférement, est le Laocoon gravé en bois par le Titien,\r\n    représenté sous la figure d’un singe et ses deux petits entourés\r\n    de serpens. Il fit ce morceau pour railler les Peintres de son\r\n    temps qui étudoient cette figure et les Statues antiques; et il\r\n    prétendit démontrer par cette Estampe qu’ils ressembloient aux\r\n    singes, lesquels ne font qu’imiter ce qu’ils voyent, sans rien\r\n    inventer d’eux mêmes.”--Traité de la Gravure en Bois, tom.\r\n    i. p. 160.]\r\n\r\nWood engraving in Germany at the close of the sixteenth century appears\r\nto have greatly declined; the old race of artists who furnished designs\r\nfor the wood engraver had become extinct, and their places were not\r\nsupplied by others. The more expensive works were now illustrated with\r\ncopper-plates; and the wood-cuts which appeared in the commoner kinds of\r\nbooks were in general very indifferent both in design and execution. As\r\nGermany was the country in which wood engraving was first encouraged and\r\nfostered, so was it also the country in which the art earliest declined\r\nand subsequently became most thoroughly neglected. In France and Italy,\r\nwood engraving had also by this time experienced a considerable decline,\r\nbut not to such an extent as in Germany.\r\n\r\nBetween 1590 and 1610, when the art was rapidly declining in other\r\ncountries, the wood-cuts which are to be met with in English books are\r\ngenerally better executed than at any preceding period. Engraved\r\ntitle-pages were then frequent, and several of them are executed with\r\nconsiderable skill. A large wood-cut, with the date 1607, in particular\r\ndisplays great merit both in design and engraving. The following is a\r\nreduced copy of an impression preserved in the Print Room of the British\r\nMuseum.[VI-119] The original, exclusive of the verses, and the ornaments\r\nat each side of them, is about fourteen inches high by about fourteen\r\nand a half wide.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-119: There is also in the Print Room of the British\r\n    Museum a curious wood-cut, of large size, engraved on several\r\n    blocks, apparently of the time of James I. The title at the top,\r\n    in Latin and English, is as follows: “HUMANÆ VITÆ IMAGO OLIM AB\r\n    APELLE IN TABULA QUADAM DEPICTA. The image of the lyfe of man that\r\n    was painted in a table by Apelles.” The subject, however, is not\r\n    so much a general representation of the life of man in its several\r\n    stages, as an allegorical representation of the evils attendant on\r\n    sensual indulgence. Several of the figures are designed with great\r\n    spirit, and the explanations underneath the principal are engraved\r\n    on the same block, in Latin and English. It seems likely that this\r\n    cut was engraved for the purpose of being pasted or hung against a\r\n    wall. It is about five feet four inches wide by about three feet\r\n    high. Some of the figures are engraved with considerable spirit,\r\n    but the groups want that well-contrasted light and shade which\r\n    give such effect to the large cuts of Durer and Burgmair. It is\r\n    likely that large cuts of this kind were intended to be pasted on\r\n    the walls of rooms, to serve at once for instruction and ornament,\r\n    like “King Charles’s Golden Rules and the Royal Game of Goose” in\r\n    later times.--_To this note Mr. Jackson adds in his annotated\r\n    copy_: “The drawing appears to have been executed by an artist who\r\n    was rather partial to cross-hatching, and the engraving by one who\r\n    knew how to render every line before him with a degree of\r\n    sharpness and delicacy by no means common at that period.”]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n  The good / Howſ-holder\r\n\r\n  The good Howſ-holder, that his Howſe may hold,\r\n    Firſt builds it on the Rock, not on the Sand.\r\n    Then, with a warie head and charie hand\r\n    Pro[v]ides (in tyme) for Hunger and for Cold:\r\n  Not daintie Fare and Furniture of Gold,\r\n    But handſom-holſom (as with Health dooth ſtand).\r\n    Not for the Rich that can as much command\r\n    But the poor Stranger, th’Orfan & the Old.\r\n\r\n  PRINTED AT LONDON IN THE BLACKE FRIERS. 1607]\r\n\r\nThe following are the six concluding lines of the sonnet underneath the\r\ncut: in the original they are printed in smaller type than the others,\r\nand in a double column. In the copy they are merely indicated to show\r\nthe relative size of the type to that of the first eight lines.\r\n\r\n    And (thus) to these to stand still open wide,\r\n  He neither wrings with Wrongs nor racks his Rents;\r\n    But saves the charge of wanton Waste & Pride:\r\n  For, Thrift’s right Fuel of Magnificence:\r\n    As Protean Fashions of new Prodigalitie\r\n    Have quight worn out all ancient Hospitalitie.\r\n\r\nThe flowers at each side of the verses are, in the original, very\r\ncoarsely executed. They are merely printers’ ornaments, engraved on\r\nseparate pieces of wood, and not on the same block as the cut above\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFrom one or two worm-holes, which have been in the block when it was\r\nprinted in 1607, and which are apparent in the impression, it seems\r\nprobable that this cut had been engraved some time previous to the date\r\nwhich appears at the bottom. As it is, however, very likely that the\r\nblock was of pear-tree, which is extremely liable to the attacks of the\r\nworm, it is possible that it might have been injured in this manner\r\nwithin a year or two of its being finished. The bold, _cleanly cut_\r\nlines of the original are very much like the work of Christopher Jegher,\r\none of the best wood engravers of that period. He resided at Antwerp,\r\nbut he is said to have been born in Germany in 1578. His best works are\r\nseveral large cuts which he engraved for Rubens from drawings made on\r\nthe block by Rubens himself, who appears to have originally published\r\nthem on his own account. From the manner in which the great painter’s\r\nname is introduced at the bottom of each--“_P. P. Rub. delin. &\r\nexcud._”--it would appear that they were both designed and printed by\r\nhim. Impressions of those cuts sometimes occur with a tint printed over\r\nthem, in sepia, from a second block, in the manner of chiaro-scuros. We\r\nhere give a reduced copy of one of the largest.[VI-120]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-120: The original cut is twenty-three inches and a\r\n    half wide by eighteen inches high.]\r\n\r\nAs profit could not have been Rubens’s motive for having these cuts\r\nengraved, it is not unlikely that his object was to compare his designs\r\nwhen executed in this manner with those of the older German\r\nmasters--Durer, Burgmair, and Cranach. The best, however, differ\r\nconsiderably in the manner of their execution from the best old German\r\nwood-cuts, for the lines are too uniform and display too much of art; in\r\nlooking at those which consist chiefly of figures, attention is first\r\ncalled to the _means_ by which an effect is produced, rather than to the\r\neffect itself in connexion with the entire subject. This objection\r\napplies most forcibly to the cut which represents the Virgin crowned by\r\nthe Almighty and Jesus Christ. The design displays much of Rubens’s\r\ngrandeur, with not less of his extravagance in the attitude of the\r\nfigures; but he seems to have studied less the effect of the whole, than\r\nto have endeavoured to express certain parts by a peculiar arrangement\r\nof lines und hatchings. The subject does not produce that feeling, which\r\nit is the great object of art to excite, in consequence of the attention\r\nbeing diverted from the contemplation of the whole to the means by which\r\nit is executed. In such impressions, however, as have a tint of sepia\r\nprinted over them from a second block, the hardness of the lines and\r\nheaviness in the hatchings are less apparent. The following is a reduced\r\ncopy of another of those cuts, which, for the beautiful simplicity of\r\nthe design, is perhaps the most pleasing of the whole. The execution of\r\nthe original is, however, coarse, a defect which is not so apparent in\r\nthe copy in consequence of the small scale on which it is\r\nengraved.[VI-121]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  CVM PRIVILEGIIS]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-121: The original is eighteen inches wide by thirteen\r\n    inches and a half high, including the margin with the inscription\r\n    “Cum privilegiis,” which is engraved on the same block.]\r\n\r\nCornelius van Sichem,[VI-122] a contemporary of Christopher Jegher,\r\nappears to have been one of the most industrious wood engravers of his\r\ntime. He was a native of Holland, and is supposed to have resided at\r\nAmsterdam. One of his best cuts is a large head, engraved from a drawing\r\nby Henry Goltzius, with the date 1607. This and several other large\r\ncuts, which he probably engraved about the same time, are so much\r\nsuperior to the smaller cuts, with his mark, which appear in books, that\r\nI am inclined to think that most of the latter must have been engraved\r\nby his pupils; they are indeed so numerous that it seems almost\r\nimpossible that he should have engraved them all himself. He seems at\r\nfirst to have worked for fame, and afterwards to have turned a\r\nmanufacturer of wood-cuts for money. The cuts with his mark contained in\r\na quarto book entitled “Bibels Tresoor,” printed at Amsterdam in 1646,\r\nby no means afford an idea of his ability as a wood-engraver; many of\r\nthem are wretched copies of old wood-cuts designed by Albert Durer and\r\nother old masters, discreditable alike to the engraver and to the\r\noriginals. The following is a slightly reduced copy of a cut, engraved\r\nby Van Sichem, from a design by Henry Goltzius. The original, which was\r\nprobably engraved about 1607, may be considered as an average specimen\r\nof the engraver’s talents; it is not so well executed as some of his\r\nbest large cuts, while it is much superior to the greater number of the\r\nsmall cuts which contain his mark. The subject is Judith with the head\r\nof Holofernes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-122: Papillon, tom. i. p. 274-276, calls this\r\n    engraver _C. S. Vichem_; and charges Professor Christ with\r\n    confounding three _Sichems_ with three _Vichems_. The name at the\r\n    bottom of the cut, in the following page, is most certainly\r\n    intended for _C. V. Sichem_.]\r\n\r\nAbout 1625 a French wood engraver of the name of Businck executed\r\nseveral chiaro-scuros chiefly from designs by Lalleman and Bloemart; and\r\nbetween 1630 and 1647, Bartolomeo Coriolano, who sometimes styles\r\nhimself “Romanus Eques,” practised the same art at Bologna with great\r\nreputation.[VI-123] In an edition of Hubert Goltzius’s Lives of the\r\nRoman Emperors, enlarged by Casper Gevartius, folio, printed at Antwerp\r\nin 1645, the portraits, in the manner of chiaro-scuros, from two blocks,\r\nare executed with great spirit. The name of the engraver is not\r\nmentioned, but from the mark I. C. I. on a tail-piece at the end of the\r\nwork, I am inclined to think that he was the same person who engraved\r\nthe cuts in a little book of devotion, first printed in Latin, French,\r\nSpanish, and Flemish, at Antwerp, about 1646.[VI-124] The number of cuts\r\nin this little work is forty, and most of them contain the mark of the\r\ndesigner, [[AS]], as well as that of the engraver. From the drawing of\r\nthese cuts it would seem that the designer was either a pupil of Rubens,\r\nor had closely copied his manner. In Professor Christ’s Dictionary of\r\nMonograms the mark [[AS]] is ascribed to Andrea Salmincio, “an engraver\r\nand pupil of Valesius.” Papillon, Traité de la Gravure en Bois, tom.\r\ni. p. 274, adopting Professor Christ’s explanation of the mark, mentions\r\n“Andrea Salmincio” as the designer of those cuts; but in page 461 of the\r\nsame volume, he says, referring to his former statement, that he had\r\nsince been informed by M. Eisen, a painter, and a native of\r\nValenciennes, that they were designed by “a famous Flemish painter and\r\nengraver on wood, named Sallarte, a contemporary of Rubens, and who is\r\nsupposed to have assisted the latter in some of his great works.” Those\r\ncuts may perhaps be considered as the last series that were expressly\r\ndesigned by an artist of talent in the seventeenth century, for the\r\npurpose of being engraved on wood. The style in which they are executed\r\nis not worthy of the designs, though, considering the period, they are\r\nnot without merit. The engraver appears to have been extremely partial\r\nto a kind of cross-hatching, in which the interstices are more like\r\nsquares than acute-angled lozenges, thus giving to the figures and\r\ndraperies a hard and unpliable appearance.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-123: The twelfth volume of Bartsch’s Peintre-Graveur\r\n    contains an ample list of Italian chiaro-scuros, together with the\r\n    names of the painters and engravers.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-124: The only perfect copy which I have seen of this\r\n    little work is in Spanish. The title is as follows: “La Perpetua\r\n    Cruz, o Passion de Jesu Christo Nuestro Señor, desde el principio\r\n    de su encarnacion hasta su muerte. Representada en quarenta\r\n    estampas que se reparten de balde, y explicada con differentes\r\n    razones y oraciones de devocion. En Amberes, en la emprenta de\r\n    Cornelio Woons, 1650.” The cuts were engraved at the instance of\r\n    the Archbishop of Malines. Before the Spanish edition appeared,\r\n    thirty thousand copies of the work in Flemish and Latin had\r\n    already been circulated.]\r\n\r\nThough several English wood engravings of the reigns of James I. and\r\nCharles I. have evidently been executed by professed wood engravers, yet\r\na great proportion of those contained in English books and pamphlets\r\nprinted in this country during the seventeenth century appear to have\r\nbeen the work of persons who had not learnt and did not regularly\r\npractise the art. The cuts of those occasional wood engravers, who were\r\nmost likely printers, are as rude in design as they are coarse in\r\nexecution, frequently displaying something like the fac-simile of a\r\nboy’s drawing in his first attempts to sketch “the human _form_ divine.”\r\nSuch cuts, evidently executed on the spur of the moment, are of frequent\r\noccurrence in tracts and pamphlets published during the time of the war\r\nbetween Charles I. and the Parliament. Evelyn, in the first edition of\r\nhis Sculptura, published in 1662, thus mentions Switzer as a wood\r\nengraver of that period: “We have likewise Switzer for cutting in wood,\r\nthe son of a father[VI-125] who sufficiently discovered his dexterity in\r\nthe _Herbals_ set forth by Mr. Parkinson, Lobel, and divers other\r\nworks.” The cuts of plants in the work, usually called Lobel’s Botany,\r\nwere most certainly not engraved by the elder Switzer; they are much\r\nsuperior to the cuts of the same kind which are undoubtedly of his\r\nengraving, and the work in which they first appeared was printed in\r\nLondon in 1571. He engraved the cuts in Speed’s History of Britain,\r\nfolio, 1611; and, though the author calls him “the most exquisite and\r\ncurious hand of that age,” they abundantly testify that he was a very\r\nordinary workman. They are executed in a meagre, spiritless manner; the\r\nbest are those which represent the portraitures of the ancient Britons.\r\nThe cuts in Parkinson’s Paradisus Terrestris, folio, 1629, were also\r\nundoubtedly engraved by him; his name, “_A. Switzer_,” with a graver\r\nunderneath, occurs at the bottom of the very indifferent cut which forms\r\nthe title-page. The portrait of the author is scarcely superior to the\r\ntitle-page; and the cuts of plants are the most worthless that are to be\r\nfound in any work of the kind. It is not unlikely that the cuts in\r\nTopsell’s History of Four-footed Beasts, 1607, and in Moffet’s Theatre\r\nof Insects, 1634, were also engraved by the elder Switzer. The taste for\r\nwood-cuts must have been low indeed when such an engraver was considered\r\none of the best of his age. Of the younger Switzer’s abilities I have\r\nhad no means of judging, never having seen a single cut which was known\r\nto be of his engraving.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-125: In Walpole’s Catalogue of Engravers there is the\r\n    following notice of the elder Switzer: “In the Harleian Library\r\n    was a set of wooden cuts, representing the broad seals of England\r\n    from the conquest to James I. inclusive, neatly executed. Vertue\r\n    says this was the sole impression he had seen, and believed that\r\n    they were cut by Chr. Switzer, and that these plates were copied\r\n    by Hollar for Sandford. Switzer also cut the coins and seals in\r\n    Speed’s History of Britain, 1614 [1611], from the originals in the\r\n    Cottonian Collection. Speed calls him _the most exquisite and\r\n    curious hand of that age_. He probably engraved the botanic\r\n    figures for Lobel’s Observations, and the plates [cuts] for\r\n    Parkinson’s Paradisus Terrestris, 1629. Chr. Switzer’s works have\r\n    sometimes been confounded with his son’s, who was of both his\r\n    names.”--Catalogue of Engravers, p. 18 note, Edit. 1794. It is\r\n    doubtful if the elder Switzer’s Christian name were Christopher.\r\n    The initial in Parkinson’s Paradisus Terrestris is an A. It is,\r\n    however, possible that this letter may be intended for a Latin\r\n    preposition, and not for the first letter of the engraver’s\r\n    Christian name.]\r\n\r\nBetween 1650 and 1700 wood engraving, as a means of multiplying the\r\ndesigns of eminent artists, either as illustrations of books or as\r\nseparate cuts, may be considered as having reached its lowest ebb. A few\r\ntolerably well executed cuts of ornaments are occasionally to be found\r\nin Italian, French, and Dutch books of this period; but though they\r\nsufficiently attest that the race _of workmen_ was not wholly extinct,\r\nthey also afford ample proof that _artists_ like those of former times\r\nhad ceased to furnish designs for the wood engraver. The art of design\r\nwas then, however, in a languishing condition throughout Europe; and\r\neven supposing that wood engraving had been as much in fashion as\r\ncopper-plate printing then was for the purpose of illustrating books, it\r\nwould be vain to expect in wood-cuts that excellence of composition and\r\ndrawing which is not to be found in the works of the best painters of\r\nthe time. Wood engravings to please must possess _some_ merit in the\r\ndesign--must show some trait of feeling for his subject on the part of\r\nthe designer. Deficiency in this respect can never be compensated by\r\ndexterity of execution: in anything that approaches to fine art, mere\r\nworkmanship, the result of laborious application, can never atone for\r\nwant of mind. The man who drew a portrait of Queen Anne with a pen, and\r\nwrote the Psalms in the lines of the face, and in the curls of the hair,\r\nin characters so small that it required a glass to read them, does not\r\nrank with a Vandyke or a Reynolds, nor even with a Lely or a Kneller. At\r\nthe period of the greatest decline of wood engraving, the want that was\r\nfelt was not of working engravers to execute cuts, but of talented\r\nartists to design them.\r\n\r\nThe principal French wood engravers about the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury were: Peter Le Sueur,--born in 1636, died 1716; his two sons,\r\nPeter and Vincent; John Papillon the elder--who died in 1710; and his\r\nson, of the same name, who was born in 1661, and died in 1723. Though\r\nJohn Michael Papillon, son of John Papillon the younger, and author of\r\nthe Traité de la Gravure en Bois, speaks highly of the talents of the\r\naforesaid members of the families of Le Sueur and Papillon as wood\r\nengravers, yet, from his account of their productions, it would seem\r\nthat they were chiefly employed in engraving subjects which scarcely\r\nallowed of any display of excellence either in design or execution.\r\nTheir fine works were ornamental letters, flowered vignettes, and\r\ntail-pieces for the booksellers; while their staple productions appear\r\nto have been blocks for card-makers and paper-stainers, with patterns\r\nfor embroiderers, lace-workers, and ribbon-manufacturers. In the\r\nsucceeding century, J. M. Papillon, grandson of the first John Papillon,\r\nand Nicholas le Sueur, grandson of the elder Peter Le Sueur, fully\r\nsupported the character of their respective families as wood engravers.\r\nSome account of their works will be given in the proper place.\r\n\r\nThe tail-piece at the conclusion of this chapter will afford some idea\r\nof the primitive style of the wood-cuts previously mentioned as\r\noccurring in tracts and pamphlets printed in England during the civil\r\nwar. It is a fac-simile of a cut which originally appeared on the\r\ntitle-page to the first known edition of Robin Hood’s Garland, printed\r\nin 1670.[VI-126] The original block is now in the possession of Mr.\r\nWilliam Garret of Newcastle-on-Tyne, and was frequently used by the late\r\nMr. George Angus of that town, as it had also been by his predecessors\r\nin the same business, to decorate the title-pages of the penny histories\r\nand garlands, which they supplied in such abundance for the\r\nwinter-evenings’ entertainment of the good folks of Northumberland and\r\nthe “Bishoprick.” Mr. Douce, in the second volume of his Illustrations\r\nof Shakspeare, also gives a fac-simile of this cut; and the following is\r\nhis explanation of the subject.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VI-126: The cuts in an edition of “The most Delightful\r\n    History of Reynard the Fox,” 4to. London, printed for Thomas\r\n    Passinger, 1681, are scarcely superior to this cut in point of\r\n    execution, though it must be confessed that the figures are\r\n    generally in better “keeping.”]\r\n\r\n“Mr. Ritson has taken notice of an old wooden cut ‘preserved on the\r\ntitle-page of a penny history (_Adam Bell, &c._), printed at Newcastle\r\nin 1772,’ and which represents, in his opinion, a morris dance,\r\nconsisting of the following personages: 1. A bishop. 2. Robin Hood.\r\n3. The potter or beggar. 4. Little John. 5. Friar Tuck. 6. Maid Marian.\r\nHe remarks that the whole is too rude to merit a copy, a position that\r\nis not meant to be controverted; but it is necessary to introduce the\r\ncut in this place for the purpose of correcting an error into which the\r\nabove ingenious writer has fallen. It is proper to mention that it\r\noriginally appeared on the title-page to the first known edition of\r\nRobin Hood’s Garland, printed in 1670, 18mo. Now, this cut is certainly\r\nnot the representation of a morris dance, but merely of the principal\r\ncharacters belonging to the Garland. These are Robin Hood, Little John,\r\n_Queen Catherine_, the bishop, the _curtal frier_, (not Tuck,) and the\r\nbeggar. Even though it were admitted that Maid Marian and Friar Tuck\r\nwere intended to be given, it could not be maintained that either the\r\nbishop or the beggar made part of a morris.”\r\n\r\nTo give more specimens of wood engraving when in its lowest state of\r\ndeclension has not been thought necessary; for even at this period it\r\nwould not be difficult to produce cuts which in point of mere execution\r\nare superior to many which appeared when the art was at its height. It\r\nis sufficient to have stated that, towards the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, wood engraving for the higher purposes of the art had sunk into\r\nutter neglect; that the best productions of the regular wood engravers\r\nof the period mostly consist of unmeaning ornaments which neither excite\r\nfeeling nor suggest a thought; and that the wood-cuts which appear to\r\nhave been engraved by persons not instructed in the business partake\r\ngenerally of the character of the following tail-piece. Having now\r\nbrought down the history of the art of wood engraving to the end of the\r\nseventeenth century, its revival in the eighteenth, with some account of\r\nthe works of Thomas Bewick and the principal English wood engravers of\r\nhis time, will form the subject of the next chapter.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nREVIVAL OF WOOD ENGRAVING.\r\n\r\n  English Wood-Cuts in 1712 -- Howel’s Medulla Historiæ Anglicanæ --\r\n  Maittaire’s Classics 1713 -- E. Kirkall -- His Chiaro-Scuros -- Cuts\r\n  in Croxall’s Æsop, 1722 -- J. B.

The cuts\r\nwhich appear in books printed in Germany, Holland, and Italy during the\r\nsame period, though of very inferior execution, sufficiently prove that\r\nthe art continued to be practised in those countries.\r\n\r\nThe first English book of this period which requires notice is an\r\nedition of Howel’s Medulla Historiæ Anglicanæ, octavo, printed at London\r\nin 1712.[VII-1] There are upwards of sixty wood-cuts in this work, and\r\nthe manner in which they are executed sufficiently indicates that the\r\nengraver must have either been self-taught or the pupil of a master who\r\ndid not understand the art. The blocks have, for the most part, been\r\nengraved in the manner of copper-plates; most of the lines, which a\r\nregular wood engraver would have left in relief, are cut in _intaglio_,\r\nand hence in the impression they appear white where they ought to be\r\nblack. The bookseller, in an address to the reader, thus proceeds to\r\nshow the advantages of those cuts, and to answer any objection that\r\nmight be urged against them on account of their being engraved on wood.\r\n“The cuts added in this edition are intended more for use than show. The\r\nutility consists in these two particulars. 1. To make the better\r\nimpression on the memory. 2. To show more readily when the notable\r\npassages in our history were transacted; which, without the knowledge of\r\nthe names of the persons, are not to be found out, by even the best\r\nindexes. As for example: In what reign was it that a rebellious rout,\r\nheaded by a vile fellow, made great ravage, and appearing in the King’s\r\npresence with insolence, their captain was stabbed upon the spot by the\r\nLord-Mayor? Here, without knowing the names of some of the parties,\r\nwhich a world of people are ignorant of, the story is not to be found by\r\nan index; but by the help of the cut, which catches the eye, is soon\r\ndiscovered. We all have heard of the piety of one of our queens who\r\nsucked the poison out of her husband’s wound, but very few remember\r\nwhich of them it was, which the cut presently shows. The same is to be\r\nsaid of all the rest, since we have chosen only such things as are\r\nNOTABILIA in the history to describe in our sculptures.--And if it be\r\nobjected that the graving is in wood, and not in copper, which would be\r\nmore beautiful; we answer, that such would be much more expensive too.\r\nAnd we were willing to save the buyer’s purse; especially since even the\r\nbest engraving would not better serve the purposes above-said.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-1: Small wood-cuts appear to have been frequently\r\n    used about this time in newspapers, for what the Americans call a\r\n    “caption” to advertisements. “The great art in writing\r\n    advertisements is the finding out a proper method to catch the\r\n    reader’s eye, without which many a good thing may pass over\r\n    unobserved, or be lost among commissions of bankrupts. Asterisks\r\n    and hands were formerly of great use for this purpose. Of late\r\n    years the N.B. has been much in fashion, as also _little cuts and\r\n    figures_, the invention of which we must ascribe to the author of\r\n    spring trusses.”--Tatler, No. 224, 14th September 1710. The\r\n    practice is not yet obsolete. Cuts of this kind are still to be\r\n    found in country newspapers prefixed to advertisements of quack\r\n    medicines, horse-races, coach and steam-boat departures, sales of\r\n    ships, and the services of _equi admissorii_.]\r\n\r\nThough no mark is to be found on any of those cuts, I am inclined to\r\nthink that they were executed by Edward Kirkall, whose name appears as\r\nthe engraver of the copper-plate frontispiece to the book. The accounts\r\nwhich we have of Kirkall are extremely unsatisfactory. Strutt says that\r\nhe was born at Sheffield in 1695; and that, visiting London in search of\r\nimprovement, he was for some time employed in graving arms, stamps, and\r\nornaments for books. It is, however, likely that he was born previous to\r\n1695; for the frontispiece to Howel’s Medulla is dated 1712, when, if\r\nStrutt be correct, Kirkall would be only seventeen. That he engraved on\r\nwood, as well as on copper, is unquestionable; and I am inclined to\r\nthink that he either occasionally engraved small ornaments and\r\nhead-pieces on type-metal for the use of printers, or that casts in this\r\nkind of metal were taken from some of his small cuts.[VII-2]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-2: Some of the cuts in an edition of Dryden’s plays,\r\n    6 vols. 12mo. published by Tonson and Watts in 1717, have\r\n    evidently been either engraved on some kind of soft metal or been\r\n    casts from a wood block. In the corner of such cuts, the marks of\r\n    the pins, which have fastened the engraved metal-plate to a piece\r\n    of wood below, are quite apparent.]\r\n\r\nThe head-pieces and ornaments in Maittaire’s Latin Classics, duodecimo,\r\npublished by Tonson and Watts, 1713, were probably engraved on wood by\r\nKirkall, as his initials, E. K., are to be found on one of the\r\ntail-pieces. Papillon speaks rather favourably of those small cuts,\r\nthough he objects to the uniformity of the tint and the want of\r\nprecision in the more delicate parts of the figures, such as the faces\r\nand hands. He notices the tail-piece with the mark E. K. as one of the\r\nbest executed; and he suspects that these letters were intended for the\r\nname of an English painter--called _Ekwits_, to the best of his\r\nrecollection,--who “taught the arts of painting and of engraving on wood\r\nto J. B. Jackson, so well known to the printers of Paris about 1730 from\r\nhis having supplied them with so large a stock of indifferent\r\ncuts.”[VII-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-3: Papillon, Traité de la Gravure en Bois, tom.\r\n    i. p. 323.]\r\n\r\nThe cuts in Croxall’s edition of Æsop’s Fables, first published by\r\nJ. and R. Tonson and J. Watts, in 1722, were, in all probability,\r\nexecuted by the same person who engraved the head-pieces and other\r\nornaments in Maittaire’s Latin Classics, printed for the same publishers\r\nabout nine years before; and there is reason to believe that this\r\nperson, as has been previously observed, was E. Kirkall. Bewick, in the\r\nintroduction prefixed to his “Fables of Æsop and others,” first printed\r\nin 1818, says that the cuts in Croxall’s edition were “on metal, in the\r\nmanner of wood.” He, however, gives no reason for this opinion, and I\r\nvery much question its correctness. After a careful inspection I have\r\nnot been able to discover any peculiar mark which should induce me to\r\nsuppose that they had been engraved on metal; and without some such mark\r\nindicating that the engraved surface had been fastened to the block to\r\nraise it to the height of the type, I consider it impossible for any\r\nperson to decide merely from the appearance of the impressions that\r\nthose cuts were printed from a metallic surface. The difference, in\r\npoint of impression, between a wood-cut and an engraving on type-metal\r\nin the same manner, or a cast in type-metal from a wood-cut, is not to\r\nbe distinguished. A wood engraver of the present day, when casts from\r\nwood-cuts are so frequently used instead of the original engraved block,\r\ndecides that a certain impression has been from a cast, not in\r\nconsequence of any peculiarity in its appearance denoting that it is\r\nprinted from a metallic surface, but from certain marks--little flaws in\r\nthe lines and minute “picks”--which he knows are characteristic of a\r\n“cast.” When a cast, however, has been well taken, and afterwards\r\ncarefully cleared out with the graver, it is frequently impossible to\r\ndecide that the impression has been taken from it, unless the examiner\r\nhave also before him an impression from the original block with which it\r\nmay be compared; and even then, a person not very well acquainted with\r\nthe practice of wood engraving and the method of taking casts from\r\nengraved wood-blocks, will be extremely liable to decide erroneously.\r\n\r\nThough it is by no means improbable that a person like Kirkall, who had\r\nbeen accustomed to engrave on copper, might attempt to engrave on\r\ntype-metal in the same manner as on wood, and that he might thus execute\r\na few small head-pieces and flowered ornaments, yet I consider it very\r\nunlikely that he should _continue to prefer metal_ for the purpose of\r\nrelief engraving after he had made a few experiments. The advantages of\r\nwood over type-metal are indeed so great, both as regards clearness of\r\nline and facility of execution, that it seems incredible that any person\r\nwho had tried both materials should hesitate to give the preference to\r\nwood. If, however, the cuts in Croxall’s Æsop were really engraved on\r\nmetal in the manner of wood, they are, as a series, the most\r\nextraordinary specimens of relief engraving for the purpose of printing,\r\nthat have ever been executed. When Bewick stated that those cuts were\r\nengraved on metal, I am inclined to think that he founded his opinion\r\nrather on popular report than on close and impartial examination of the\r\ncuts themselves; and it is further to be observed that Thomas Bewick,\r\nwith all his merits as a wood engraver, was not without his weaknesses\r\nas a man; he was not unwilling that people should believe that the art\r\nof wood engraving was lost in this country, and that the honour of its\r\nre-discovery, as well as of its subsequent advancement, was due to him.\r\nThough he was no doubt sincere in the opinion which he gave, yet those\r\nwho know him are well aware that he would not have felt any pleasure in\r\ncalling the attention of his readers to a series of wood-cuts executed\r\nin England upwards of thirty years before he was born, and which are not\r\nmuch inferior--except as regards the animals--to the cuts of fables\r\nengraved by himself and his brother previous to 1780.[VII-4] The cuts in\r\nCroxall’s Æsop not only display great improvement in the engraver,\r\nsupposing him to be the same person that executed the head-pieces and\r\nornaments in Maittaire’s Latin Classics printed in 1713, but are very\r\nmuch superior to any cuts contained in works of the same kind printed in\r\nFrance between 1700 and 1760.[VII-5]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-4: “The Fables of Mr. John Gay,” with cuts by Thomas\r\n    and John Bewick, was published in 1779. “Select Fables, a new\r\n    edition improved,” with cuts by the same, appeared in 1784; both\r\n    in duodecimo, printed by T. Saint, Newcastle-on-Tyne. The cuts in\r\n    the latter work are considerably better than those in the former.\r\n    Several of the cuts which originally appeared in those two works\r\n    are to be found in “Select Fables; with cuts designed and engraved\r\n    by Thomas and John Bewick, and others,” octavo, printed for\r\n    Emerson Charnely, Newcastle-on-Tyne, 1820.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-5: The cuts in two different editions of Æsop’s\r\n    Fables, published at Paris,--the one by Charles Le Clerc in 1731,\r\n    and the other by J. Barbou in 1758,--are most wretchedly executed.\r\n    The mark of Vincent Le Sueur appears on the frontispiece to Le\r\n    Clerc’s edition.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FROM A COPPER-PLATE BY S. LE CLERC.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FROM A WOOD-CUT IN CROXALL’S ÆSOP.]\r\n\r\nMany of the subjects in Croxall are merely reversed copies of engravings\r\non copper by S. Le Clerc, illustrative of a French edition of Æsop’s\r\nFables published about 1694. The first of the preceding cuts is a\r\nfac-simile of one of Le Clerc’s engravings; and the second is a copy of\r\nthe same subject as it appears in Croxall. The fable to which they both\r\nrelate is the Fox and the Goat.\r\n\r\nThe above cut is by no means one of the best in Croxall: it has not been\r\nselected as a specimen of the manner in which those cuts are executed,\r\nbut as an instance of the closeness with which the English wood-cuts\r\nhave been copied from the French copper-plates. In several of the cuts\r\nin Bewick’s Fables of Æsop and others, the arrangement and composition\r\nappear to have been suggested by those in Croxall; but in every instance\r\nof this kind the modern artist has made the subject his own by the\r\nsuperior manner in which it is treated: he restores to the animals their\r\nproper forms, represents them _acting_ their parts as described in the\r\nfable, and frequently introduces an incident or sketch of landscape\r\nwhich gives to the whole subject a natural character. The following copy\r\nof the Fox and Goat, in the Fables of Æsop and others, 1818-1823, will\r\nserve to show how little the modern artist has borrowed in such\r\ninstances from the cuts in Croxall, and how much has been supplied by\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nBetween 1722 and 1724, Kirkall published by subscription twelve\r\nchiaro-scuros engraved by himself, chiefly after designs by old Italian\r\nmasters. In those chiaro-scuros the outlines and the darker parts of the\r\nfigures are printed from copper-plates, and the sepia-coloured tints\r\nafterwards impressed from wood-blocks; though they possess considerable\r\nmerit, they are deficient in spirit, and will not bear a comparison with\r\nthe chiaro-scuros executed by Ugo da Carpi and other early Italian wood\r\nengravers. Most of them are too smooth, and want the bold outline and\r\nvigorous character which distinguish the old chiaro-scuros: what Kirkall\r\ngained in delicacy and precision by the introduction of mezzotint, he\r\nlost through the inefficient engraving of the wood-blocks. One of the\r\nlargest of those chiaro-scuros is a copy of one of Ugo da Carpi’s--Æneas\r\ncarrying his father on his shoulders--after a design by Raffaele. In\r\nWalpole’s Catalogue of Engravers, a notice of Kirkall’s “new method of\r\nprinting, composed of etching, mezzotinto, and wooden stamps,” concludes\r\nwith the following passage: “He performed several prints in this manner,\r\nand did great justice to the drawing and expression of the masters he\r\nimitated. This invention, for one may call it so, had much success, much\r\napplause, no imitators.--I suppose it is too laborious and too tedious.\r\nIn an opulent country where there is great facility of getting money, it\r\nis seldom got by merit. Our artists are in too much hurry to gain it, or\r\ndeserve it.”\r\n\r\nAbout 1724 Kirkall published seventeen views of shipping, from designs\r\nby W. Vandevelde, which he also called “prints in chiaro-scuro.” They\r\nhave, however, no just pretensions to the name as it is usually\r\nunderstood when applied to prints, for they are merely tinted engravings\r\nworked off in a greenish-blue ink. These so-called chiaro-scuros are\r\ndecided failures.\r\n\r\nKirkall engraved, on copper, the plates in Rowe’s translation of Lucan’s\r\nPharsalia, folio, published by Tonson, 1718; the plates for an edition\r\nof Inigo Jones’s Stonehenge, 1725; and a frontispiece to the works of\r\nMrs. Eliza Haywood, which is thus alluded to in the Dunciad:\r\n\r\n  “See in the circle next Eliza placed,\r\n  Two babes of love close clinging to her waist;\r\n  Fair as before her works she stands confest,\r\n  In flowers and pearls by bounteous Kirkall drest.”\r\n\r\nA considerable number of rude and tasteless ornaments and head-pieces,\r\nwith the mark F. H., engraved on wood, are to be found in English books\r\nprinted between 1720 and 1740. Several of them have been cast in\r\ntype-metal,[VII-6] as is evident from the marks of the pins, in the\r\nimpressions, by which they have been fastened to the blocks; the same\r\nhead-piece or ornament is also frequently found in books printed in the\r\nsame year by different printers. Some of the best headings and\r\ntail-pieces of this period occur in a volume of “Miscellaneous Poems,\r\noriginal and translated, by several hands. Published by Mr. Concanen,”\r\nLondon, printed for J. Peele, octavo, 1724. The subjects are, Apollo\r\nwith a lyre; Minerva with a spear and shield; two men sifting corn;\r\nHercules destroying the hydra; and a man with a large lantern. They are\r\nmuch superior to any cuts of the same kind with the mark F. H.; and from\r\nthe manner in which they are executed, I am inclined to think that they\r\nare the work of the person who engraved the cuts in Croxall’s Æsop. The\r\nfollowing is a fac-simile of one of the best of the cuts that I have\r\never seen with the mark F. H. It occurs as a tail-piece at the end of\r\nthe preface to “Strephon’s Revenge: A Satire on the Oxford Toasts,”\r\noctavo, London, 1724.[VII-7]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-6: It is not unlikely that the frequency of such\r\n    casts has induced many persons to suppose that most of the cuts of\r\n    this period were “_engraved_ on metal in the manner of wood.”]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  LEGENT HÆC NOSTRA NEPOTES.]\r\n\r\nJohn Baptist Jackson, an English wood engraver, was, according to\r\nPapillon, a pupil of the person who engraved the small head-pieces and\r\nornaments in Maittaire’s Latin Classics, published by Tonson and Watts\r\nin 1713; and as the cuts in Croxall’s Æsop were probably engraved by the\r\nsame person, as has been previously observed, it is not unlikely that\r\nJackson, as his apprentice, might have some share in their execution.\r\nThough these cuts were much superior to any that had appeared in England\r\nfor about a hundred years previously, wood engraving seems to have\r\nreceived but little encouragement. Probably from want of employment in\r\nhis own country, Jackson proceeded to Paris, where he remained several\r\nyears, chiefly employed in engraving head-pieces and ornaments for the\r\nbooksellers. Papillon, who seems to have borne no good-will towards\r\nJackson, thus speaks of him in the first volume of his “Traité de la\r\nGravure en Bois.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-7: Two cuts, with the same mark, are to be found in\r\n    Thoresby’s Vicaria Leodinensis, 8vo. London, 1724; one at the\r\n    commencement of the preface, and the other at the end of the\r\n    work.]\r\n\r\n“J. Jackson, an Englishman, who resided several years in Paris, might\r\nhave perfected himself in wood engraving, which he had learnt of an\r\nEnglish painter, as I have previously mentioned, if he had been willing\r\nto follow the advice which it was in my power to give him. Having called\r\non me, as soon as he arrived in Paris, to ask for work, I for several\r\nmonths gave him a few things to execute in order to afford him the means\r\nof subsistence. He, however, repaid me with ingratitude; he made a\r\nduplicate of a flowered ornament of my drawing, which he offered, before\r\ndelivering to me the block, to the person for whom it was to be\r\nengraved. From the reproaches that I received, on the matter being\r\ndiscovered, I naturally declined to employ him any longer. He then went\r\nthe round of the printing-offices in Paris, and was obliged to engrave\r\nhis cuts without order, and to offer them for almost nothing; and many\r\nof the printers, profiting by his distress, supplied themselves amply\r\nwith his cuts. He had acquired a certain insipid taste which was not\r\nabove the little mosaics on snuff-boxes; and with ornaments of this\r\nkind, after the manner of several other inferior engravers, he\r\nsurcharged his works. His mosaics, however delicately engraved, are\r\nalways deficient in effect, and display the engraver’s patience rather\r\nthan his talent; for the other parts of the cut, consisting of delicate\r\nlines without tints or a gradation of light and shade, want that force\r\nwhich is necessary to render the whole striking. Such wood engravings,\r\nhowever deficient in this respect, are yet admired by printers of vulgar\r\ntaste, who foolishly pretend that they most resemble copper-plates, and\r\nthat they print better than cuts of a picturesque character, and\r\ncontaining a variety of tints.\r\n\r\n“Jackson, being obliged, through destitution, to leave Paris, where he\r\ncould get nothing more to do, travelled in France; and afterwards, being\r\ndisgusted with his profession, he accompanied a painter to Rome, from\r\nwhence he went to Venice, where, as I am informed, he married, and\r\nsubsequently returned to England, his native country.”[VII-8]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-8: Traité de la Gravure en Bois, tom. i. pp. 327,\r\n    328.]\r\n\r\nThough Papillon speaks disparagingly of Jackson, the latter was at least\r\nas good an engraver as himself. Jackson appears to have visited Paris\r\nnot later than 1726, for Papillon mentions a vignette and a large letter\r\nengraved by him in that year for a Latin and French dictionary, printed\r\nin 1727 by the brothers Barbou; and it is likely that he remained there\r\ntill about 1731. In an Italian translation of the Lives of the Twelve\r\nCæsars, printed there in quarto 1738, there is a large ornamental\r\ntitle-page of his engraving; and in the same year he engraved a\r\nchiaro-scuro of Christ taken down from the cross, from a painting by\r\nRembrandt,[VII-9] in the possession of Joseph Smith, Esq. the British\r\nconsul at Venice, a well-known collector of pictures and other works of\r\nart. Between 1738 and 1742, when residing at Venice, he also engraved\r\ntwenty-seven large chiaro-scuros,--chiefly after pictures by Titian,\r\nG. Bassano, Tintoret, and P. Veronese,--which were published in a large\r\nfolio volume in the latter year. They are very unequal in point of\r\nmerit; some of them appearing harsh and crude, and others flat and\r\nspiritless, when compared with similar productions of the old Italian\r\nwood engravers. One of the best is the Martyrdom of St. Peter\r\nDominicanus, after Titian, with the date 1739; the manner in which the\r\nfoliage of the trees is represented is particularly good. On his return\r\nto England he seems to have totally abandoned the practice of wood\r\nengraving in the ordinary manner for the purpose of illustrating or\r\nornamenting books; for I have not been able to discover any English\r\nwood-cut of the period that either contains his mark, or seems, from its\r\ncomparative excellence, to have been of his engraving. Finding no demand\r\nin this country for wood-cuts, he appears to have tried to render his\r\nknowledge of engraving in chiaro-scuro available for the purpose of\r\nprinting paper-hangings. In an “Essay on the Invention of Engraving and\r\nPrinting in Chiaro Oscuro,”[VII-10] published in his name in 1754, we\r\nlearn that he was then engaged in a manufacture of this kind at\r\nBattersea. The account given in this essay of the origin and progress of\r\nchiaro-scuro engraving is frequently incorrect; and from several of the\r\nstatements which it contains, it would seem that the writer was very\r\nimperfectly acquainted with the works of his predecessors and\r\ncontemporaries in the same department of wood engraving. From the\r\nfollowing passage, which is to be found in the fifth page, it is evident\r\nthat the writer was either ignorant of what had been done in the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and even in his own age, or that he\r\nwas wishful to enhance the merit of Mr. Jackson’s process by concealing\r\nwhat had recently been done in the same manner by others. “After having\r\nsaid all this, it may seem highly improper to give to Mr. Jackson the\r\nmerit of inventing this art; but let me be permitted to say, that an art\r\nrecovered is less little than an art invented. The works of the former\r\nartists remain indeed; but the manner in which they were done is\r\nentirely lost: the inventing then the manner is really due to this\r\nlatter undertaker, since no writings, or other remains, are to be found\r\nby which the method of former artists can be discovered, or in what\r\nmanner they executed their works; nor, in truth, has the Italian method\r\nsince the beginning of the sixteenth century been attempted by any one\r\nexcept Mr. Jackson.” What is here called the “Italian method,” that is,\r\nthe method of executing chiaro-scuros entirely on wood, was practised in\r\nFrance at the end of the seventeenth century: and Nicholas Le Sueur had\r\nengraved several cuts in this manner about 1730, the very time when\r\nJackson was living in Paris. The principles of the art had also been\r\napplied in France to the execution of paper-hangings upwards of fifty\r\nyears before Jackson attempted to establish the same kind of manufacture\r\nin England. Not a word is said of the chiaro-scuros of Kirkall,[VII-11]\r\nfrom whom it is likely that Jackson first acquired his knowledge of\r\nchiaro-scuro engraving: with the exception of the outlines and some\r\nother parts in these chiaro-scuros being executed in mezzotint, the\r\nprinting of the rest from wood-blocks is precisely the same as in the\r\nItalian method.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-9: This painting, which is wholly in chiaro-scuro,\r\n    is now in the National Gallery, to which it was presented by the\r\n    late Sir George Beaumont.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-10: The title at length is as follows: “An Essay on\r\n    the Invention of Engraving and Printing in Chiaro Oscuro, as\r\n    practised by Albert Durer, Hugo di Carpi, &c., and the Application\r\n    of it to the making Paper Hangings of taste, duration, and\r\n    elegance, by Mr. Jackson of Battersea. Illustrated with Prints in\r\n    proper colours.” 4to. London, 1754.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-11: There can be no doubt that the mention of\r\n    Kirkall’s name is purposely avoided. The “attempts” of Count\r\n    Caylus, who executed several chiaro-scuros by means of\r\n    copper-plates and wood-blocks subsequent to Kirkall, are noticed;\r\n    but the name of Nicholas Le Sueur, who assisted the Count and\r\n    engraved the wood-blocks, is never mentioned. It is also stated in\r\n    the Essay, page 6, that some of the subjects begun by Count Caylus\r\n    were finished by Mr. Jackson, and “approved by the lovers and\r\n    promoters of that art in Paris.”]\r\n\r\nThe Essay contains eight prints illustrative of Mr. Jackson’s method;\r\nfour are chiaro-scuros, and four are printed in “proper colours,” as is\r\nexpressed in the title, in imitation of drawings. They are very poorly\r\nexecuted, and are very much inferior to the chiaro-scuros engraved by\r\nJackson when residing at Venice. The prints in “proper colours” are\r\negregious failures. The following notices respecting Mr. Jackson are\r\nextracted from the Essay in question.\r\n\r\n“Certainly Mr. Jackson, the person of whom we speak, has not spent less\r\ntime and pains, applied less assiduity, or travelled to fewer distant\r\ncountries in search of perfecting his art, than other men; having passed\r\ntwenty years in France and Italy to complete himself in drawing after\r\nthe best masters in the best schools, and to see what antiquity had most\r\nworthy the attention of a student in his particular pursuits. After all\r\nthis time spent in perfecting himself in his discoveries, like a true\r\nlover of his native country, he is returned with a design to communicate\r\nall the means which his endeavours can contribute to enrich the land\r\nwhere he drew his first breath, by adding to its commerce, and employing\r\nits inhabitants; and yet, like a citizen of it, he would willingly enjoy\r\nsome little share of those advantages before he leaves this world, which\r\nhe must leave behind him to his countrymen when he shall be no more.”\r\n\r\n“During his residence at Venice, where he made himself perfect in the\r\nart which he professes, he finished many works well known to the\r\nnobility and gentry who travelled to that city whilst he lived in\r\nit.--Mr. Frederick, Mr. Lethuillier, and Mr. Smith, the English consul\r\nat Venice, encouraged Mr. Jackson to undertake to engrave in\r\nchiaro-oscuro, blocks after the most capital pictures of Titian,\r\nTintoret, Giacomo Bassano, and Paul Veronese, which are to be found in\r\nVenice, and to this end procured him a subscription. In this work may be\r\nseen what engraving on wood will effectuate, and how truly the spirit\r\nand genius of every one of those celebrated masters are preserved in the\r\nprints.\r\n\r\n“During his executing this work he was honoured with the encouragement\r\nof the Right Honourable the Marquis of Hartington, Sir Roger Newdigate,\r\nSir Bouchier Wrey, and other English gentlemen on their travels at\r\nVenice, who saw Mr. Jackson drawing on the blocks for the print after\r\nthe famous picture of the Crucifixion painted by Tintoret in the albergo\r\nof St. Roche. Those prints may now be seen at his house at\r\nBattersea.--Not content with having brought his works in chiaro-oscuro\r\nto such perfection, he attempted to print landscapes in all their\r\noriginal colours; not only to give to the world all the outline light\r\nand shade, which is to be found in the paintings of the best masters,\r\nbut in a great degree their very manner and taste of colouring. With\r\nthis intent he published six landscapes,[VII-12] which are his first\r\nattempt in this nature, in imitation of painting in _aquarillo_ or\r\nwater-colours; which work was taken notice of by the Earl of Holderness,\r\nthen ambassador extraordinary to the republic of Venice; and his\r\nexcellency was pleased to permit the dedication of those prints to him,\r\nand to encourage this new attempt of printing pictures with a very\r\nparticular and very favourable regard, and to express his approbation of\r\nthe merit of the inventor.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-12: I have only seen one of these landscapes; and\r\n    from it I form no very high opinion of the others. It is scarcely\r\n    superior in point of execution to the prints in “proper colours”\r\n    contained in the Essay.]\r\n\r\nJohn Michael Papillon, one of the best French wood engravers of his age,\r\nwas born in 1698. His grandfather and his father, as has been previously\r\nobserved, were both wood engravers. In 1706, when only eight years old,\r\nhe secretly made his first essay in wood engraving; and when only nine,\r\nhis father, who had become aware of his amusing himself in this manner,\r\ngave him a large block to engrave, which he appears to have executed to\r\nhis father’s satisfaction, though he had previously received no\r\ninstructions in the art.[VII-13] The block was intended for printing\r\npaper-hangings, the manufacture of which was his father’s principal\r\nbusiness. Though until the time of his father’s death, which happened in\r\n1723, Papillon appears to have been chiefly employed in such works, and\r\nin hanging the papers which he had previously engraved, he yet executed\r\nseveral vignettes and ornaments for the booksellers, and sedulously\r\nendeavoured to improve himself in this higher department of his\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-13: Papillon, in the Supplement to his “Traité de la\r\n    Gravure en Bois,” page 6, gives a small cut--a copy of a figure in\r\n    a copper-plate by Callot--engraved by himself when nine years old.\r\n    If the cut be genuine, the engraver had improved but little as he\r\n    grew older.]\r\n\r\nShortly after the death of his father he married; and, having given up\r\nthe business of engraving paper-hangings, he laboured so hard to perfect\r\nhimself in the art of designing and engraving vignettes and ornaments\r\nfor books, that his head became affected; and he sometimes displayed\r\nsuch absence of mind that his wife became alarmed, fancying that “he no\r\nlonger loved her.” On his assuring her that his behaviour was the result\r\nof his anxiety to improve himself in drawing and engraving on wood, and\r\nto write something about the art, she encouraged him in his purpose, and\r\naided him with her advice, for, as she was the daughter of a clever man,\r\nM. Chaveau, a sculptor, and had herself made many pretty drawings on\r\nfans, she had some knowledge of design. Papillon’s fits of absence,\r\nhowever, though they may have been proximately induced by close\r\napplication and anxiety about his success in the line to which he\r\nintended to apply himself in future, appear to have originated in a\r\ntendency to insanity, which at a later period displayed itself in a more\r\ndecided manner. In 1759, in consequence of a determination of blood to\r\nthe head, as he says, through excessive joy at seeing his only daughter,\r\nwho had lived from the age of four years with her uncle, combined with a\r\nrecollection of his former sorrows, his mind became so much disordered\r\nthat it was necessary to send him to an hospital, where, through\r\nrepeated bleedings and other remedies, he seems to have speedily\r\nrecovered. He mentions that in the same year, four other engravers were\r\nattacked by the same malady, and that only one of them regained his\r\nsenses.[VII-14]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-14: Traité de la Gravure en Bois, Supplement, tom.\r\n    iii. p. 39. In the first volume, page 335, he alludes to the\r\n    disorder as “un accident et une fatalité commune à plusieurs\r\n    graveurs, aussi bien que moi.” Has the practice of engraving on\r\n    wood or on copper a tendency to induce insanity? Three\r\n    distinguished engravers, all from the same town, have in recent\r\n    times lost their reason; and several others, from various parts of\r\n    the country, have been afflicted with the same distressing malady.\r\n    These facts deserve the consideration of parents who design to\r\n    send their sons as pupils to engravers. When there is the least\r\n    reason to suspect a hereditary taint of insanity in the\r\n    constitution of the youth, it perhaps would be safest to put him\r\n    to some other business or profession where close attention to\r\n    minute objects is less required.]\r\n\r\nPapillon’s endeavours to improve himself were not unsuccessful; the cuts\r\nwhich he engraved about 1724, though mostly small, possess considerable\r\nmerit; they are not only designed with much more feeling than the\r\ngenerality of those executed by other French engravers of the period,\r\nbut are also much more effective, displaying a variety of tint and a\r\ncontrast of light and shade which are not to be found in the works of\r\nhis contemporaries. In 1726, in order to divert his anxiety and to bring\r\nhis cuts into notice, he projected _Le petit Almanach de Paris_, which\r\nsubsequently was generally known as “Le Papillon.” The first that he\r\npublished was for the year 1727; and the wood-cuts which it contained\r\nequally attracted the attention of the public and of connoisseurs.\r\nMonsieur Colombat, the editor of the Court Calendar, spoke highly of the\r\ncut for the mouth of January; the cross-hatchings, he said, were\r\nexecuted in the first style of wood engraving, and he kindly predicted\r\nto Papillon that he would one day excel in his art. From this time he\r\nseems to have no longer had any doubt of his own abilities, but, on the\r\ncontrary, to have entertained a very high opinion of them. He appears to\r\nhave considered wood engraving as the highest of all the graphic arts,\r\nand himself as the greatest of all its professors, either ancient or\r\nmodern.\r\n\r\nFrom this, to him, memorable epoch,--the publication of “Le petit\r\nAlmanach de Paris,” with cuts by PAPILLON,--he appears to have been\r\nseldom without employment, for in the Supplement to the “Traité de la\r\nGravure en Bois,” he mentions that in 1768, the “Collection of the Works\r\nof the Papillons,” presented by him to the Royal Library, contained\r\nupwards of _five thousand_ pieces of his own engraving. This “Recueil\r\ndes Papillons,” which he seems to have considered as a family monument\r\n“ære perennius,” is perpetually referred to in the course of his work.\r\nIt consisted of four large folio volumes containing specimens of wood\r\nengravings executed by the different members of the Papillon family for\r\nthree generations--his grandfather, his father, his uncle, his brother,\r\nand himself.\r\n\r\nPapillon was employed not only by the booksellers of his own country,\r\nbut also by those of Holland. A book, entitled “Historische School en\r\nHuis-Bybel,” printed at Amsterdam in 1743, contains two hundred and\r\nseventeen cuts, all of which appear to have been either engraved by\r\nPapillon himself, or under his superintendence. His name appears on\r\nseveral of them, and they are all engraved in the same style. From a\r\npassage in the dedication, it seems likely that they had appeared in a\r\nsimilar work printed at the same place a few years previously. They are\r\ngenerally executed in a coarser manner than those contained in\r\nPapillon’s own work, but the style of engraving and general effect are\r\nthe same. The cut on the next page is a copy of the first, which is one\r\nof the best in the work. To the left is Papillon’s name, engraved, as\r\nwas customary with him, in very small letters, with the date, 1734.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nPapillon’s History of Wood Engraving, published in 1766, in two octavo\r\nvolumes, with a Supplement,[VII-15] under the title of “Traité\r\nHistorique et Pratique de la Gravure en Bois,” is said to have been\r\nprojected, and partly written, upwards of thirty years before it was\r\ngiven to the public. Shortly after his being admitted a member of the\r\nSociety of Arts, in 1733, he read, at one of the meetings, a paper on\r\nthe history and practice of wood engraving; and in 1735 the Society\r\nsignified their approbation that a work written by him on the subject\r\nshould be printed. It appears that the first volume of such a work was\r\nactually printed between 1736 and 1738, but never published. He does not\r\nexplain why the work was not proceeded with at that time; and it would\r\nbe useless to speculate on the possible causes of the interruption. He\r\nmentions that a copy of this volume was preserved in the Royal Library;\r\nand he charges Fournier the younger, who between 1758 and 1761 published\r\nthree tracts on the invention of wood engraving and printing, with\r\nhaving availed himself of a portion of the historical information\r\ncontained in this volume. The public, however, according to his own\r\nstatement, gained by the delay; as he grew older he gained more\r\nknowledge of the history of the art, and “invented” several important\r\nimprovements in his practice, all of which are embodied in his later\r\nwork. In 1758 he also discovered the memoranda which he had made at\r\nMonsieur De Greder’s, in 1719 or 1720, relative to the interesting\r\ntwins, Alexander Alberic Cunio and his sister Isabella, who, about 1284,\r\nbetween the fourteenth and sixteenth years of their age, executed a\r\nseries of wood engravings illustrative of the history of Alexander the\r\nGreat.[VII-16] However the reader may be delighted or amused by the\r\nromantic narrative of the Cunio, Papillon’s reputation as the historian\r\nof his art would most likely have stood a _little_ higher had he never\r\ndiscovered those memoranda. They have very much the character of\r\nill-contrived forgeries; and even supposing that he believed them, and\r\nprinted them in good faith, his judgment must be sacrificed to save his\r\nhonesty.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-15: The Supplement, or “Tome troisième,” as it is\r\n    also called, though dated 1766, was not printed until 1768, as is\r\n    evident from a “Discours Nuptial,” at page 97, pronounced on 13th\r\n    June 1768. Two of the cuts also contain the date 1768.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-16: Papillon’s account of the Cunio, with an\r\n    examination of its credibility, will be found in chapter i. pp.\r\n    26-39.]\r\n\r\nThe first volume of Papillon’s work contains the history of the art; it\r\nis divided into two parts, the first treating of wood engraving for the\r\npurpose of printing in the usual manner from a single block, and the\r\nsecond treating of chiaro-scuro. He does not trace the progress of the\r\nart by pointing out the improvements introduced at different periods; he\r\nenumerates all the principal cuts that he had seen, without reference to\r\ntheir execution as compared with those of an earlier date; and, from his\r\ndesire to enhance the importance of his art, he claims almost every\r\neminent painter whose name or mark is to be found on a cut, as a wood\r\nengraver. He is in this respect so extremely credulous as to assert that\r\nMary de Medici, Queen of Henry IV. of France, had occasionally amused\r\nherself with engraving on wood; and in order to place the fact beyond\r\ndoubt he refers to a cut representing the bust of a female, with the\r\nfollowing inscription: “MARIA MEDICI. F. M.D.LXXXVII.” “The engraving,”\r\nhe observes, with his usual _bonhomie_, “is rather better than what\r\nmight be reasonably expected from a person of such quality; it contains\r\nmany cross-hatchings, somewhat unequal indeed, and occasionally\r\nimperfect, but, notwithstanding, sufficiently well engraved to show that\r\nshe had executed several wood-cuts before she had attempted this. I know\r\nmore than one wood engraver--or at least calling himself such--who is\r\nincapable of doing the like.” In 1587, the date of this cut, Mary de\r\nMedici was only fourteen years old; and since its execution, according\r\nto Papillon, shows that she was then no novice in the art, she must have\r\nacquired her practical knowledge of wood engraving at rather an early\r\nage,--at least for a princess. Papillon never seems to have considered\r\nthat F is the first letter of “FILIA” as well as of “FECIT,” nor to have\r\nsuspected that the cut was simply a portrait of Mary de Medici, and not\r\na specimen of her engraving.\r\n\r\nFrom the following passage in the preface, he seems to have been aware\r\nthat his including the names of many eminent painters in his list of\r\nwood engravers would be objected to. “Some persons, who entertain a\r\npreconceived opinion that many painters whom I mention have not engraved\r\non wood, may perhaps dispute the works which I ascribe to them. Of such\r\npersons I have to request that they will not condemn me before they have\r\nacquainted themselves with my researches and examined my proofs, and\r\nthat they will judge of them without prejudice or partiality.” The\r\n“researches” to which he alludes, appear to have consisted in searching\r\nout the names and marks of eminent painters in old wood-cuts, and his\r\n“proofs” are of the same kind as that which he alleges in support of his\r\nassertion that Mary de Medici had engraved on wood,--a fact which, as he\r\nremarks, “was unknown to Rubens.” The historical portion of Papillon’s\r\nwork is indeed little more than a confused catalogue of all the\r\nwood-cuts which had come under his observation; it abounds in errors,\r\nand almost every page affords an instance of his credulity.\r\n\r\nIn the second volume, which is occupied with details relative to the\r\npractice of the art, Papillon gives his instructions and enumerates his\r\n“inventions” in a style of complacent self-conceit. The most trifling\r\nremarks are accompanied by a reference to the “Recueil des Papillons;”\r\nand the most obvious means of effecting certain objects,--such means as\r\nhad been regularly adopted by wood engravers for upwards of two hundred\r\nyears previously, and such as in succeeding times have suggested\r\nthemselves to persons who never received any instructions in the\r\nart,--are spoken of as important discoveries, and credit taken for them\r\naccordingly. One of his fancied discoveries is that of lowering the\r\nsurface of a block towards the edges in order that the engraved lines in\r\nthose parts may be less subject to the action of the _plattin_ in\r\nprinting, and consequently lighter in the impression. The Lyons Dance of\r\nDeath, 1538, affords several instances of blocks lowered in this manner,\r\nnot only towards the edges, but also in the middle of the cut, whenever\r\nit was necessary that certain delicately engraved lines should be\r\nlightly printed, and thus have the appearance of gradually diminishing\r\ntill their extremities should scarcely be distinguishable from the paper\r\non which they are impressed. Numerous instances of this practice are\r\nfrequent in wood-cuts executed from 1540 to the decline of the art in\r\nthe seventeenth century. Lowering was also practised by the engraver of\r\nthe cuts in Croxall’s Æsop; by Thomas Bewick, who acquired a knowledge\r\nof wood engraving without a master; and by the self-taught artist who\r\nexecuted the cuts in Alexander’s Expedition down the Hydaspes, a poem by\r\nDr. Thomas Beddoes, printed in 1792, but never published.[VII-17] As the\r\nsame practice has recently been claimed as an “invention,” it would seem\r\nthat some wood engravers are either apt to ascribe much importance to\r\nlittle things, or are singularly ignorant of what has been done by their\r\npredecessors. Such an “invention,” though unquestionably useful, surely\r\ndoes not require any particular ingenuity for its discovery; such\r\n“discoveries” every man makes for himself as soon as he feels the want\r\nof that which the so-called invention will supply. The man who pares the\r\ncork of a quart bottle in order to make it fit a smaller one is, with\r\nequal justice, entitled to the name of an inventor, provided he was not\r\naware of the thing having been done before: such an “adaptation of means\r\nto the end” cannot, however, be considered as an effort of genius\r\ndeserving of public commendation.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-17: This poem was privately printed and never\r\n    published. It was written expressly in imitation of Dr. Darwin,\r\n    some of whose friends had contended that his style was inimitable,\r\n    but were deceived into a belief that this poem was written by him,\r\n    until the real author avowed himself. In the Advertisement\r\n    prefixed to it Dr. Beddoes speaks thus of the engraver of the\r\n    cuts: “The engravings in the following pages will be praised or\r\n    excused when it is known that they are the performance of an\r\n    uneducated and uninstructed artist, if such an application be not\r\n    a profanation of the term, in a remote village. All the assistance\r\n    he received was from the example of Mr. Bewick’s most masterly\r\n    engravings on wood.” The name of this self-taught artist was\r\n    Edward Dyas, who was parish-clerk at Madeley, Shropshire, where\r\n    the book was printed. The _compositor_, as is stated in the same\r\n    Advertisement, was a young woman.--See _Bibliotheca Parriana_,\r\n    p. 513.]\r\n\r\nIn Papillon’s time it was not customary with French engravers on wood to\r\nhave the subject perfectly drawn on the block, with all the lines and\r\nhatchings pencilled in, and the _effect_ and the different tints\r\nindicated either in pencil or in Indian ink, as is the usual practice in\r\nthe present day. The design was first drawn on paper; from this, by\r\nmeans of tracing paper, the engraver made an outline copy on the block;\r\nand, without pencilling in all the lines or washing in the tints, he\r\nproceeded to “translate” the original, to which he constantly referred\r\nin the progress of his work, in the same manner as a copper-plate\r\nengraver does to the drawing or painting before him. Papillon perceived\r\nthe disadvantages which resulted from this mode of proceeding; and\r\nthough he still continued to make his first drawing on paper, he copied\r\nit more carefully and distinctly on the block than was usual with his\r\ncontemporaries. He was thus enabled to proceed with greater certainty in\r\nhis engraving; what he had to effect was immediately before him, and it\r\nwas no longer necessary to refer so frequently to the original. To the\r\ncircumstance of the drawings being perfectly made on the block, Papillon\r\nascribes in a great measure the excellence of the old wood engravings of\r\nthe time of Durer and Holbein.\r\n\r\nPapillon, although always inclined to magnify little things connected\r\nwith wood engraving, and to take great credit to himself for trifling\r\n“inventions,” was yet thoroughly acquainted with the practice of his\r\nart. The mode of thickening the lines in certain parts of a cut, after\r\nit has been engraved, by scraping them down, was frequently practised by\r\nhim, and he explains the manner of proceeding, and gives a cut of the\r\ntools required in the operation.[VII-18] As Papillon, previous to the\r\npublication of his book, had contributed several papers on the subject\r\nof wood engraving to the famed Encyclopédie, he avails himself of the\r\nsecond volume of the Traité to propose several additions and corrections\r\nto those articles. The following definition proposed to be inserted in\r\nthe Encyclopédie, after the article GRATUIT, will afford some idea of\r\nthe manner in which he is accustomed to speak of his “inventions.” The\r\nterm which he explains is “GRATTURE ou GRATTAGE,” literally, “SCRAPING,”\r\nthe practice just alluded to. “This is, according to the new manner of\r\nengraving on wood, the operation of skilfully and carefully scraping\r\ndown parts in an engraved block which are not sufficiently dark, in\r\norder to give them, as may be required, greater strength, and to render\r\nthe shades more effective. This admirable plan, utterly unknown before,\r\nwas accidentally discovered in 1731 by M. Papillon, by whom the art of\r\nwood engraving is advanced to a state tending to perfection, and\r\napproaching more and more towards the beauty of engraving on copper.”\r\nThe tools used by Papillon to scrape down the lines of an engraved\r\nblock, and thus render them thicker and, consequently, the impression\r\ndarker, differ considerably in shape from those used for the same\r\npurpose by modern wood engravers in England. This tool now principally\r\nused is something like a copper-plate engraver’s burnisher, and\r\noccasionally a fine and sharp file is employed.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-18: “Manière de Gratter les tailles déjà gravées\r\n    pour les rendre plus fortes, afin de les faire ombrer\r\n    davantage.”--Supplément du Traité de la Gravure en Bois, p. 50.]\r\n\r\nIn Papillon’s time the French wood engravers appear to have held the\r\ngraver in the manner of a pen, and in forming a line to have cut\r\n_towards them_ as in forming a down-stroke in writing, and to have\r\nengraved on the longitudinal, and not the cross section of the wood.\r\nModern English wood engravers, having the rounded handle of the graver\r\nsupported against the hollow of the hand, and directing the blade by\r\nmeans of the fore-finger and thumb, cut the line _from them_; and always\r\nengrave on the cross section of the wood. Papillon mentions box,\r\npear-tree, apple-tree, and the wood of the service-tree, as the best for\r\nthe purposes of engraving: box was generally used for the smaller and\r\nfiner cuts intended for the illustration or ornament of books; the\r\nlarger cuts, in which delicacy was not required, were mostly engraved on\r\npear-tree wood. Apple-tree wood was principally used by the wood\r\nengravers of Normandy. Next to box, Papillon prefers the wood of the\r\nservice-tree. The box brought from Turkey, though of larger size, he\r\nconsiders inferior to that of Provence, Italy, or Spain.\r\n\r\nAlthough Papillon’s _modus operandi_ differs considerably from that of\r\nEnglish wood engravers of the present day, I am not aware of any\r\nsupposed discovery in the modern practice of the art that was not known\r\nto him. The methods of lowering a block in certain parts before drawing\r\nthe subject on it, and of thickening the lines, and thus getting more\r\n_colour_, by scraping the surface of the cut when engraved, were, as has\r\nbeen observed, known to him; he occasionally introduced cross-hatchings\r\nin his cuts;[VII-19] and in one of his chapters he gives instructions\r\nhow to insert a _plug_ in a block, in order to replace a part which had\r\neither been spoiled in the course of engraving or subsequently damaged.\r\nOne of the improvements which he suggested, but did not put in practice,\r\nwas a plan for engraving the same subject on two, three, or four blocks,\r\nin order to obtain cross-hatchings and a variety of tints with less\r\ntrouble than if the subject were entirely engraved on the same block.\r\nSuch cuts were not to be printed as chiaro-scuros, but in the usual\r\nmanner, with printer’s ink. It is worthy of observation that Bewick in\r\nthe latter part of his life had formed a similar opinion of the\r\nadvantages of engraving a subject on two or more blocks, and thus\r\nobtaining with comparative ease such cross-lines and varied tints as\r\ncould only be executed with great difficulty on a single block. He,\r\nhowever, proceeded further than Papillon, for he began to engrave a\r\nlarge cut which he intended to finish in this manner; and he was so\r\nsatisfied that the experiment would be successful, that when the\r\npressman handed to him a proof of the first block, he exclaimed, “I wish\r\nI was but twenty years younger!”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-19: Several cuts in which cross-hatching is\r\n    introduced occur in the “Traité de la Gravure en Bois;” and the\r\n    author refers to several others in the “Recueil des Papillons” as\r\n    displaying the same kind of work. He considers the execution of\r\n    such hatchings as the test of excellence in wood engraving; “for,”\r\n    he observes, “when a person has learnt to execute them he may\r\n    boast of having mastered one of the most difficult parts of the\r\n    art, and may justly assume the name of a wood engraver.”--Tom. ii.\r\n    p. 90.]\r\n\r\nPapillon, in his account of the practice of the art, explains the manner\r\nof engraving and printing chiaro-scuros; and in illustration of the\r\nprocess he gives a cut executed in this style, together with separate\r\nimpressions from each of the four blocks from which it is printed. There\r\nis also another cut of the same kind prefixed to the second part of the\r\nfirst volume, containing the history of engraving in chiaro-scuro.\r\nScarcely anything connected with the practice of wood engraving appears\r\nto have escaped his notice. He mentions the effect of the breath in cold\r\nweather as rendering the block damp and the drawing less distinct; and\r\nhe gives in one of his cuts the figure of a “mentonnière,”--that is to\r\nsay, a piece of quilted linen, like the pad used by women to keep their\r\nbonnets cocked up,--which, being placed before the mouth and nostrils,\r\nand kept in its place by strings tied behind the head, screened the\r\nblock from the direct action of the engraver’s breath.\r\n\r\nHe frequently complains of the careless manner in which wood-cuts were\r\nprinted;[VII-20] but from the following passage we learn that the\r\ninferiority of the printed cuts when compared with the engraver’s proofs\r\ndid not always proceed from the negligence of the printer. “Some wood\r\nengravers have the art of fabricating proofs of their cuts much more\r\nexcellent and delicate than they fairly ought to be; and the following\r\nis the manner in which they contrive to obtain tolerably decent proofs\r\nfrom very indifferent engravings. They first take two or three\r\nimpressions, and then, to obtain one to their liking, and with which\r\nthey may deceive their employers, they only ink the block on those\r\nplaces which ought to be dark, leaving the distances and lighter parts\r\nwithout any ink, except what remained after taking the previous\r\nimpressions. The proof which they now obtain appears extremely delicate\r\nin those parts which were not properly inked; but when they come to be\r\nprinted in a page with type, the impression is quite different from the\r\nproof which the engraver delivers with the blocks; there is no variety\r\nof tint, all is hard, and the distance is sometimes darker than objects\r\nin the fore-ground. I run no great risk in saying that all the three _Le\r\nSueurs_ have been accustomed to practise this deception.”[VII-21]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-20: He complains in another part of the work that\r\n    many printers, both compositors and pressmen, by pretending to\r\n    engrave on wood, had brought the art into disrepute. They not only\r\n    spoiled the work of regular engravers, but _dared_ to engrave\r\n    wood-cuts themselves.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-21: Traité de la Gravure en Bois, tom. ii. p. 365.]\r\n\r\nAll the cuts in Papillon’s work, except the portrait prefixed to the\r\nfirst volume,[VII-22] are his own engraving, and, for the most part,\r\nfrom his own designs. The most of the blocks were lent to the author by\r\nthe different persons for whom he had engraved them long previous to the\r\nappearance of his work.[VII-23] They are introduced as ornaments at the\r\nbeginning and end of the chapters; but though they may enable the reader\r\nto judge of Papillon’s abilities as a designer and engraver on wood,\r\nbeyond this they do not in the least illustrate the progress of the art.\r\nThe execution of some of the best is extremely neat; and almost all of\r\nthem display an effect--a contrast of black and white--which is not to\r\nbe found in any other wood-cuts of the period. A few of the designs\r\npossess considerable merit, but in by far the greater number simplicity\r\nand truth are sacrificed to ornament and French taste. Whatever may be\r\nPapillon’s faults as a historian of the art, he deserves great credit\r\nfor the diligence with which he pursued it under unfavourable\r\ncircumstances, and for his endeavours to bring it into notice at\r\na time when it was greatly neglected. His labours in this respect were,\r\nhowever, attended with no immediate fruit. He died in 1776, and his\r\nimmediate successors do not appear to have profited by his instructions.\r\nThe wood-cuts executed in France between 1776 and 1815 are generally\r\nmuch inferior to those of Papillon; and the recent progress which wood\r\nengraving has made in that country seems rather to have been influenced\r\nby English example than by his precepts.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-22: The portrait was engraved “_in venerationis\r\n    testimonium_,” and presented to Papillon by Nicholas Caron,\r\n    a bookseller and wood engraver of Besançon. The following\r\n    complimentary verses are engraved below the portrait:\r\n\r\n      “Tu vois ici les traits d’un Artiste fameux\r\n          Dont la savante main enfanta des merveilles;\r\n          Par ses travaux et par ses veilles\r\n      Il resuscita l’Art qui le trace à tes yeux.”\r\n\r\n    Papillon speaks favourably of Caron as a wood engraver; he says\r\n    that “he is much superior to Nioul, Jackson, Contat, Lefevre, and\r\n    others his contemporaries, and would at least have equalled the Le\r\n    Sueurs had he applied himself to drawing the figure.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-23: From several of those blocks not less than sixty\r\n    thousand impressions had been previously taken, and from one of\r\n    them four hundred and fifty-six thousand had been printed.]\r\n\r\nNicholas Le Sueur--born 1691, died 1764,--was, next to Papillon, the\r\nbest French wood engraver of his time. His chiaro-scuros, printed\r\nentirely from wood-blocks, are executed with great boldness and\r\nspirit, and partake more of the character of the earlier Italian\r\nchiaro-scuros than any other works of the same kind engraved by his\r\ncontemporaries.[VII-24] He chiefly excelled in the execution of\r\nchiaro-scuros and large cuts; his small cuts are of very ordinary\r\ncharacter; they are generally engraved in a hard and meagre style,\r\nwant variety of tint, and are deficient in effect.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-24: In the chiaro-scuros from original drawings in\r\n    the collection of Monsieur Crozat, with the figures etched by\r\n    Count Caylus, the wood-blocks from which the sepia-coloured tints\r\n    were printed were engraved by Nicholas Le Sueur.--About the same\r\n    period Arthur Pond and George Knapton in England, and Count\r\n    M. A. Zanetti in Italy, executed in the same manner several\r\n    chiaro-scuros in imitation of drawings and sketches by eminent\r\n    painters. The taste for chiaro-scuros seems to have been revived\r\n    in France by the Regent-Duke of Orleans, who declared that Ugo da\r\n    Carpi’s chiaro-scuros afforded him more pleasure than any other\r\n    kind of prints.]\r\n\r\nP. S. Fournier, the younger, a letter-founder of considerable\r\nreputation,--born at Paris 1712, died 1768,--occasionally engraved on\r\nwood. Papillon says that he was self-taught; and that he certainly would\r\nhave made greater progress in the art had he not devoted himself almost\r\nexclusively to the business of type-founding. Monsieur Fournier is,\r\nhowever, better known as a writer on the history of the art than as a\r\npractical wood engraver. Between 1758 and 1761 he published three tracts\r\nrelating to the origin and progress of wood engraving, and the invention\r\nof typography.[VII-25] From these works it is evident that, though he\r\ntakes no small credit to himself for his practical knowledge of wood\r\nengraving and printing, he was very imperfectly acquainted with his\r\nsubject. They abound in errors which it is impossible that any person\r\npossessing the knowledge he boasts of should commit, unless he had very\r\nsuperficially examined the books and cuts on which he pronounces an\r\nopinion. He seems indeed to have thought that, from the circumstance of\r\nhis being a wood engraver and letter-founder, his decisions on all\r\ndoubtful matters in the early history of wood engraving and printing\r\nshould be received with implicit faith. Looking at the comparatively\r\nsmall size of his works, no writer, not even Papillon himself, has\r\ncommitted so many mistakes; and his decisions are generally most\r\nperemptory when utterly groundless or evidently wrong. He asserts that\r\nFaust and Scheffer’s Psalter, 1457-1459, is printed from moveable types\r\nof wood, and that the most of the earliest specimens of typography are\r\nprinted from the same kind of types; and in the fulness of his knowledge\r\nhe also declares that the text of the Theurdank is printed not from\r\ntypes, but from engraved wood-blocks. Like Papillon, he seems to have\r\npossessed a marvellous sagacity in ferreting out old wood engravers. He\r\nsays that Andrea Mantegna engraved on wood a grand triumph in 1486; that\r\nSebastian Brandt engraved in 1490 the wood-cuts in the Ship of\r\nFools,[VII-26] after the designs of J. Locher; and that Parmegiano\r\nexecuted several wood-cuts after designs by Raffaele. He decides\r\npositively that Albert Durer, Lucas Cranach, Titian, and Holbein were\r\nwood engravers, and, like Papillon, he includes Mary de Medici in the\r\nlist. Papillon appears to have had good reason to complain that Fournier\r\nhad availed himself of his volume printed in 1738. His taste appears to\r\nhave been scarcely superior to his knowledge and judgment: he mentions a\r\nlarge and coarsely engraved cut of the head of Christ as one of the best\r\nspecimens of Albert Durer’s engraving; and he says that Papillon’s cuts\r\nare for excellence of design and execution equal to those of the\r\ngreatest masters!\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-25: The following are the titles of those tracts,\r\n    which are rather scarce. They are all of small octavo size, and\r\n    printed by J. Barbou. 1. Dissertation sur l’Origine et les Progrès\r\n    de l’Art de Graver en Bois, pour éclaircir quelques traits de\r\n    l’Histoire de l’Imprimerie, et prouver que Guttemberg n’en est pas\r\n    l’Inventeur.

This last was an answer to a letter written by M. Bär,\r\n    almoner of the Swedish chapel in Paris, in which the two former\r\n    tracts of Fournier were severely criticised.--Fournier was also\r\n    the author of a work in two small volumes, entitled “Manuel\r\n    Typographique, utile aux Gens de lettres, et à ceux qui exercent\r\n    les differentes parties de l’Art de l’Imprimerie.”]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-26: The cut here introduced is the first in the\r\n    _Stultifera Navis_, or “Ship of Fools,” and is copied from\r\n    Pyason’s edition of 1509. The following lines accompany it:\r\n\r\n      “----this is my mynde, this one pleasoure have I,\r\n      Of bokes to have great plenty and aparayle.\r\n      I take no wysdome by them; nor yet avayle\r\n      Nor them perceyve not: And then I them despyse.\r\n      Thus am I a foole and all that serve that guyse.”]\r\n\r\nFrom a passage in one of Fournier’s tracts--Remarques Typographiques,\r\n1761,--it is evident that wood engraving was then greatly neglected in\r\nGermany. It relates to the following observation of M. Bär’s, almoner of\r\nthe Swedish chapel at Paris, on the length of time necessary to engrave\r\na number of wooden types sufficient to print such a work as Faust and\r\nScheffer’s Psalter: “M. Schœpflin declares that, by the general\r\nadmission of all experienced persons, it would require upwards of six\r\nyears to complete such a work in so perfect a manner.” The following is\r\nFournier’s rejoinder: “To understand the value of this remark, it ought\r\nto be known that, so far from there being many experienced wood\r\nengravers to choose from, M. Schœpflin would most likely experience some\r\ndifficulty in finding one to consult.” The wood-cuts which occur in\r\nGerman books printed between 1700 and 1760 are certainly of the most\r\nwretched kind; contemptible alike in design and execution. Some of the\r\nbest which I have seen--and they are very bad--are to be found in a thin\r\nfolio entitled “Orbis Literatus Germanico-Europaeus,” printed at\r\nFrankfort in 1737. They are cuts of the seals of all the principal\r\ncolleges and academical foundations in Germany. The art in Italy about\r\nthe same period was almost equally neglected. An Italian wood engraver,\r\nnamed Lucchesini, executed several cuts between 1760 and 1770. Most of\r\nthe head-pieces and ornaments in the Popes’ Decretals, printed at Rome\r\nat this period, were engraved by him; and he also engraved the cuts in a\r\nSpanish book entitled “Letania Lauretana de la Virgen Santissima,”\r\nprinted at Valencia in 1768. It is scarcely necessary to say that these\r\ncuts are of the humblest character.\r\n\r\nThough wood engraving did not make any progress in England from 1722 to\r\nthe time of Thomas Bewick, yet the art was certainly never lost in this\r\ncountry; the old stock still continued to put forth a branch--_non\r\ndeficit alter_--although not a golden one. Two wood-cuts tolerably well\r\nexecuted, and which show that the engraver was acquainted with the\r\npractice of “lowering,” occur in a thin quarto, London, printed for\r\nH. Payne, 1760. The book and the cuts are thus noticed in Southey’s Life\r\nof Cowper, volume I. page 50. The writer is speaking of the Nonsense\r\nClub, of which Cowper was a member.\r\n\r\n“At those meetings of\r\n\r\n  Jest and youthful Jollity,\r\n  Sport that wrinkled Care derides,\r\n  And Laughter holding both his sides,\r\n\r\nthere can be little doubt that the two odes to Obscurity and Oblivion\r\noriginated, joint compositions of Lloyd and Colman, in ridicule of Gray\r\nand Mason. They were published in a quarto pamphlet, with a vignette, in\r\nthe title-page, of an ancient poet safely seated and playing on his\r\nharp; and at the end a tail-piece representing a modern poet in huge\r\nboots, flung from a mountain by his Pegasus into the sea, and losing his\r\ntie-wig in the fall.” The following is a fac-simile of the cut\r\nrepresenting the poet’s fall. He seems to have been tolerably confident\r\nof himself, for, though the winged steed has no bridle, he is provided\r\nwith a pair of formidable spurs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe cuts in a collection of humorous pieces in verse, entitled “The\r\nOxford Sausage,” 1764, are evidently by the same engraver, and almost\r\nevery one of them affords an instance of “lowering.” At the foot of one\r\nof them, at page 89, the name “Lister” is seen; the subject is a\r\nbacchanalian figure mounted on a winged horse, which has undoubtedly\r\nbeen drawn from the same model as the Pegasus in Colman and Lloyd’s\r\nburlesque odes. In an edition of the Sausage, printed in 1772, the name\r\nof “T. Lister” occurs on the title-page as one of the publishers, and as\r\nresiding at Oxford. Although those cuts are generally deficient in\r\neffect, their execution is scarcely inferior to many of those in the\r\nwork of Papillon; the portrait indeed of “Mrs. Dorothy Spreadbury,\r\nInventress of the Oxford Sausage,” forming the frontispiece to the\r\nedition of 1772, is better executed than Monsieur Nicholas Caron’s\r\nvotive portrait of Papillon, “the restorer of the art of wood\r\nengraving.”\r\n\r\nIn 1763, a person named S. Watts engraved two or three large wood-cuts\r\nin outline, slightly shaded, after drawings by Luca Cambiaso.\r\nImpressions of those cuts are most frequently printed in a yellowish\r\nkind of ink. About the same time Watts also engraved, in a bold and free\r\nstyle, several small circular portraits of painters. In Sir John\r\nHawkins’s History of Music, published in 1776, there are four wood-cuts;\r\nand at the bottom of the largest--Palestrini presenting his work on\r\nMusic to the Pope--is the name of the engraver thus: _T. Hodgson.\r\nSculp._ Dr. Dibdin, in noticing this cut, in his Preliminary\r\nDisquisition on Early Engraving and Ornamental Printing, prefixed to his\r\nedition of the Typographical Antiquities, says that it was “done by\r\nHodgson, the master of the celebrated Bewick.”[VII-27] If by this it is\r\nmeant that Bewick was the apprentice of Hodgson, or that he obtained\r\nfrom Hodgson his knowledge of wood engraving, the assertion is\r\nincorrect. It is, however, almost certain that Bewick, when in London in\r\n1776, was employed by Hodgson, as will be shown in its proper place.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-27: Dr. Dibdin adds: “Mr. Douce informs me that Sir\r\n    John Hawkins told him of the artist’s obtaining the prize for it\r\n    from the Society for the Encouragement of Arts.”]\r\n\r\nHaving now given some account of wood engraving in its languishing\r\nstate--occasionally showing symptoms of returning vigour, and then\r\nalmost immediately sinking into its former state of depression--we at\r\nlength arrive at an epoch from which its revival and progressive\r\nimprovement may be safely dated. The person whose productions recalled\r\npublic attention to the neglected art of wood engraving was\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  THOMAS BEWICK]\r\n\r\nThis distinguished wood engraver, whose works will be admired as long as\r\ntruth and nature shall continue to charm, was born on the 10th or 11th\r\nof August, 1753, at Cherry-burn, in the county of Northumberland, but on\r\nthe south side of the Tyne, about twelve miles westward of Newcastle.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE HOUSE IN WHICH BEWICK WAS BORN.]\r\n\r\nHis father rented a small land-sale colliery at Mickley-bank, in the\r\nneighbourhood of his dwelling, and it is said that when a boy the future\r\nwood engraver sometimes worked in the pit. At a proper age he was sent\r\nas a day-scholar to a school kept by the Rev. Christopher Gregson at\r\nOvingham, on the opposite side of the Tyne. The Parsonage House, in\r\nwhich Mr. Gregson lived, is pleasantly situated on the edge of a sloping\r\nbank immediately above the river; and many reminiscences of the place\r\nare to be found in Bewick’s cuts; the gate at the entrance is\r\nintroduced, with trifling variations, in three or four different\r\nsubjects; and a person acquainted with the neighbourhood will easily\r\nrecognise in his tail-pieces several other little local sketches of a\r\nsimilar kind. In the time of the Rev. James Birkett, Mr. Gregson’s\r\nsuccessor, Ovingham school had the character of being one of the best\r\nprivate schools in the county; and several gentlemen, whose talents\r\nreflect credit on their teacher, received their education there. In the\r\nfollowing cut, representing a view of Ovingham from the south-westward,\r\nthe Parsonage House, with its garden sloping down to the Tyne, is\r\nperceived immediately to the right of the clump of large trees. The bank\r\non which those trees grow is known as the _crow-tree bank_. The\r\nfollowing lines, descriptive of a view from the Parsonage House, are\r\nfrom “The School Boy,” a poem, by Thomas Maude, A.M., who received his\r\nearly education at Ovingham under Mr. Birkett.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PARSONAGE AT OVINGHAM.]\r\n\r\n  “But can I sing thy simpler pleasures flown,\r\n  Loved OVINGHAM! and leave the _chief_ unknown,--\r\n  Thy _annual Fair_, of every joy the mart,\r\n  That drained my pocket, ay, and took my childish heart?\r\n  Blest morn! how lightly from my bed I sprung,\r\n  When in the blushing east thy beams were young;\r\n  While every blithe co-tenant of the room\r\n  Rose at a call, with cheeks of liveliest bloom.\r\n  Then from each well-packed drawer our vests we drew,\r\n  Each gay-frilled shirt, and jacket smartly new.\r\n  Brief toilet ours! yet, on a morn like this,\r\n  Five extra minutes were not deemed amiss.\r\n  Fling back the casement!--Sun, propitious shine!\r\n  How sweet your beams gild the clear-flowing Tyne,\r\n  That winds beneath our master’s garden-brae,\r\n  With broad bright mazes o’er its pebbly way.\r\n  See Prudhoe! lovely in the morning beam:--        }\r\n  Mark, mark, the ferry-boat, with twinkling gleam, }\r\n  Wafting fair-going folks across the stream.       }\r\n  Look out! a bed of sweetness breathes below,\r\n  Where many a rocket points its spire of snow;\r\n  And from the _Crow-tree Bank_ the cawing sound\r\n  Of sable troops incessant poured around!\r\n  Well may each little bosom throb with joy!\r\n  On such a morn, who would not be a boy?”\r\n\r\nBewick’s school acquirements probably did not extend beyond English\r\nreading, writing, and arithmetic; for, though he knew a little Latin, he\r\ndoes not appear to have ever received any instructions in that language.\r\nIn a letter dated 18th April, 1803, addressed to Mr. Christopher\r\nGregson,[VII-28] London, a son of his old master, introducing an artist\r\nof the name of Murphy, who had painted his portrait, Bewick humorously\r\nalludes to his _beauty_ when a boy, and to the state of his coat-sleeve,\r\nin consequence of his using it instead of a pocket-handkerchief. Bewick,\r\nit is to be observed, was very hard-featured, and much marked with the\r\nsmall-pox. After mentioning Mr. Murphy as “a man of worth, and a\r\nfirst-rate artist in the miniature line,” he thus proceeds: “I do not\r\nimagine, at your time of life, my dear friend, that you will be\r\nsolicitous about forming new acquaintances; but it may not, perhaps, be\r\nputting you much out of the way to show any little civilities to Mr.\r\nMurphy during his stay in London. He has, on his own account, taken my\r\nportrait, and I dare say will be desirous to show you it the first\r\nopportunity: when you see it, you will no doubt conclude that T. B. is\r\nturning _bonnyer_ and _bonnyer_[VII-29] in his old days; but indeed you\r\ncannot _help knowing this_, and also that there were _great indications_\r\nof its turning out so _long since_. But if you have forgot our earliest\r\nyouth, perhaps your brother P.[VII-30] may help you to remember what a\r\n_great beauty_ I was at that time, when the grey coat-sleeve was\r\n_glazed_ from the cuff towards the elbows.” The words printed in Italics\r\nare those that are underlined by Bewick himself.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-28: Mr. Christopher Gregson, who was an apothecary,\r\n    lived in Blackfriars. He died about the year 1813. As long as he\r\n    lived, Bewick maintained a friendly correspondence with him.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-29: _Prettier_ and _prettier_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-30: Philip.]\r\n\r\nBewick, having shown a taste for drawing, was placed by his father as an\r\napprentice with Mr. Ralph Beilby, an engraver, living in Newcastle, to\r\nwhom on the 1st of October 1767 he was bound for a term of seven years.\r\nMr. Beilby was not a wood engraver; and his business in the copper-plate\r\nline was of a kind which did not allow of much scope for the display of\r\nartistic talent. He engraved copper-plates for books, when any by chance\r\nwere offered to him; and he also executed brass-plates for doors, with\r\nthe names of the owners handsomely filled up, after the manner of the\r\nold “_niellos_,” with black sealing-wax. He engraved crests and initials\r\non steel and silver watch-seals; also on tea-spoons, sugar-tongs, and\r\nother articles of plate; and the engraving of numerals and ornaments,\r\nwith the name of the maker, on clock-faces,--which were not then\r\nenamelled,--seems to have formed one of the chief branches of his very\r\ngeneral business.[VII-31]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-31: “While with BEILBY he was employed in engraving\r\n    clock-faces, which, I have heard him say, made his hands as hard\r\n    as a blacksmith’s, and almost disgusted him with\r\n    engraving.”--Sketch of the Life and Works of the late Thomas\r\n    Bewick, by George C. Atkinson. Printed in the Transactions of the\r\n    Natural History Society, Newcastle, 1830.]\r\n\r\nBewick’s attention appears to have been first directed to wood engraving\r\nin consequence of his master having been employed by the late Dr.\r\nCharles Hutton, then a schoolmaster in Newcastle, to engrave on wood the\r\ndiagrams for his Treatise on Mensuration. The printing of this work was\r\ncommenced in 1768, and was completed in 1770. The engraving of the\r\ndiagrams was committed to Bewick, who is said to have invented a graver\r\nwith a fine groove at the point, which enabled him to cut the outlines\r\nby a single operation.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe above is a fac-simile of one of the earliest productions of Bewick\r\nin the art of wood engraving. The church is intended for that of St.\r\nNicholas, Newcastle.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, and while he was still an apprentice, Bewick undoubtedly\r\nendeavoured to improve himself in wood engraving; but his progress does\r\nnot appear to have been great, and his master had certainly very little\r\nwork of this kind for him to do. He appears to have engraved a few\r\nbill-heads on wood; and it is not unlikely that the cuts in a little\r\nbook entitled “Youth’s Instructive and Entertaining Story Teller,” first\r\npublished by T. Saint, Newcastle, 1774, were executed by him before the\r\nexpiration of his apprenticeship.\r\n\r\nBewick, at one period during his apprenticeship, paid ninepence a week\r\nfor his lodgings in Newcastle, and usually received a brown loaf every\r\nweek from Cherry-burn. “During his servitude,” says Mr. Atkinson, “he\r\npaid weekly visits to Cherry-burn, except when the river was so much\r\nswollen as to prevent his passage of it at Eltringham, when he\r\nvociferated his inquiries across the stream, and then returned to\r\nNewcastle.” This account of his being accustomed to _shout_ his\r\nenquiries across the Tyne first appeared in a Memoir prefixed to the\r\nSelect Fables, published by E. Charnley, 1820. Mr. William Bedlington,\r\nan old friend of Bewick, once asked him if it were true? “Babbles and\r\nnonsense!” was the reply. “It never happened but once, and that was when\r\nthe river had suddenly swelled before I could reach the top of the\r\n_allers_,[VII-32] and yet folks are made to believe that I was in the\r\nhabit of doing it.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-32: Alders--the name of a small plantation above\r\n    Ovingham, which Bewick had to pass through on his way to\r\n    Eltringham ferry-boat.]\r\n\r\nOn the expiration of his apprenticeship he returned to his father’s\r\nhouse at Cherry-burn, but still continued to work for Mr. Beilby. About\r\nthis time he seems to have formed the resolution of applying himself\r\nexclusively in future to wood engraving, and with this view to have\r\nexecuted several cuts as specimens of his ability. In 1775 he received a\r\npremium of seven guineas from the Society of Arts for a cut of the\r\nHuntsman and the Old Hound, which he probably engraved when living at\r\nCherry-burn after leaving Mr. Beilby.[VII-33] The following is a\r\nfac-simile of this cut, which was first printed in an edition of Gay’s\r\nFables, published by T. Saint, Newcastle, 1779. Mr. Henry Bohn, the\r\npublisher of the present edition, happening to be in possession of the\r\noriginal cut, it is annexed on the opposite page.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-33: The Reverend William Turner, of Newcastle, in a\r\n    letter printed in the Monthly Magazine for June 1801, says that\r\n    Bewick obtained this premium “_during his apprenticeship_.” This\r\n    must be a mistake; as his apprenticeship expired in October 1774,\r\n    and he obtained the premium in 1775. It is possible, however, that\r\n    the engraving may have been executed during that period.]\r\n\r\nIn 1776, when on a visit to some of his relations in Cumberland,[VII-34]\r\nhe availed himself of the opportunity of visiting the Lakes; and in\r\nafter-life he used frequently to speak in terms of admiration of the\r\nbeauty of the scenery, and of the neat appearance of the white-washed,\r\nslate-covered cottages on the banks of some of the lakes. His tour was\r\nmade on foot, with a stick in his hand and a wallet at his back; and it\r\nhas been supposed that in a tail-piece, to be found at page 177 of the\r\nfirst volume of his British Birds, first edition, 1797, he has\r\nintroduced a sketch of himself in his travelling costume, drinking out\r\nof what he himself would have called the _flipe_ of his hat. The figure\r\nhas been copied in our ornamental letter T at page 471.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-34: Bewick’s mother, Jane Wilson, was a daughter of\r\n    Thomas Wilson of Ainstable in Cumberland, about five miles\r\n    north-north-west of Kirk-Oswald.]\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 1776, he went to London, where he arrived on the 1st\r\nof October. He certainly did not remain more than a twelvemonth in\r\nLondon,[VII-35] for in 1777 he returned to Newcastle, and entered into\r\npartnership with his former master, Mr. Ralph Beilby. Bewick--who does\r\nnot appear to have been wishful to undeceive those who fancied that he\r\nwas the person who rediscovered the “long-lost art of engraving on\r\nwood”[VII-36]--would never inform any of the good-natured friends, who\r\nfished for intelligence with the view of writing his life, of the works\r\non which he was employed when in London. The faith of a believer in the\r\nstory of Bewick’s re-discovering “the long-lost art” would have received\r\ntoo great a shock had he been told by Bewick himself that on his arrival\r\nin London he found professors of the “long-lost art” regularly\r\nexercising their calling, and that with one of them he found employment.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-35: Bewick, in London, in 1828, observed to one of\r\n    his former pupils, that it was then fifty-one years since he left\r\n    London, on his first visit, to return to Newcastle.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-36: Mr. Atkinson talks about wood engraving having\r\n    taken a nap for a century or two “after the time of Durer and\r\n    Holbein,” and of Bewick being the restorer of the “long-lost art;”\r\n    and yet, with singular inconsistency, in another part of his\r\n    Sketch, he refers to Papillon, whose work, containing a minute\r\n    account of the art as then practised, was published about two\r\n    years before Bewick began to engrave on wood.--The Reverend\r\n    William Turner, who ought to have known better, also speaks of the\r\n    “long-lost art,” in his Memoir of Thomas Bewick.]\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to believe that Bewick, when in London, was\r\nchiefly employed by T. Hodgson, most likely the person who engraved the\r\nfour cuts in Sir John Hawkins’s History of Music. It is at any rate\r\ncertain that several cuts engraved by Bewick appeared in a little work\r\nentitled “A curious Hieroglyphick Bible,” printed by and for T. Hodgson,\r\nin George’s Court, St. John’s Lane, Clerkenwell.[VII-37] Proofs of three\r\nof the principal cuts are now lying before me. The subjects are: Adam\r\nand Eve, with the Deity seen in the clouds, forming the frontispiece;\r\nthe Resurrection; and a cut representing a gentleman seated in an\r\narm-chair, with four boys beside him: the border of this cut is of the\r\nsame kind as that of the large cut of the Chillingham Bull engraved by\r\nBewick in 1789. These proofs appear to have been presented by Bewick to\r\nan eminent painter, now dead, with whom either then, or at a subsequent\r\nperiod, he had become acquainted. Not one of Bewick’s biographers\r\nmentions those cuts, nor seems to have been aware of their existence.\r\nThe two memoirs of Bewick, written by his “friends” G. C. Atkinson and\r\nJohn F. M. Dovaston,[VII-38] sufficiently demonstrate that neither of\r\nthem had enjoyed his confidence in matters relative to his progress in\r\nthe art of wood engraving.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-37: I have not been able to discover the date of the\r\n    first edition of this work. The third edition is dated 1785.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-38: “Some Account of the Life, Genius, and Personal\r\n    Habits of the late Thomas Bewick, the celebrated Artist and\r\n    Engraver on Wood. By his Friend John F. M. Dovaston, Esq. A.M.,”\r\n    was published in Loudon’s Magazine of Natural History, 1829-1830.\r\n    Mr. Dovaston seems to have caught a knowledge of Bewick’s personal\r\n    habits at a glance; and a considerable number of his observations\r\n    on other matters appear to have been the result of a peculiar\r\n    quickness of apprehension. What he says about the church of\r\n    Ovingham not being “parted into proud pews,” when Bewick was a\r\n    boy, is incorrect. It had, in fact, been pewed from an early\r\n    period; for, on the 2nd of September, 1763, Dr. Sharp, Archdeacon\r\n    of Northumberland, on visiting the church, notices the pews as\r\n    being “very bad and irregular;” and on a board over the\r\n    vestry-door is the following inscription: “This Church was new\r\n    pewed, A. D. 1766.” No boards from this church containing\r\n    specimens of Bewick’s early drawing were ever in the possession of\r\n    the Duke of Northumberland. Mr. Dovaston is frequently\r\n    imaginative, but seldom correct. His personal sketch of Bewick is\r\n    a ridiculous caricature.]\r\n\r\nMr. Atkinson, in his Sketch of the Life and Works of Bewick, says that\r\nwhen in London he worked with a person of the name of Cole. Of this\r\nperson, as a wood engraver, I have not been able to discover any trace.\r\nBewick did not like London; and he always advised his former pupils and\r\nnorth-country friends to leave the “province covered with houses” as\r\nsoon as they could, and return to the country to there enjoy the\r\nbeauties of Nature, fresh air, and content. In the letter to his old\r\nschoolfellow, Mr. Christopher Gregson, previously quoted, he thus\r\nexpresses his opinion of London life. “Ever since you paid your last\r\nvisit to the north, I have often been thinking upon you, and wishing\r\nthat you would _lap up_, and leave the metropolis, to enjoy the fruits\r\nof your hard-earned industry on the banks of the Tyne, where you are so\r\nmuch respected, both on your own account and on that of those who are\r\ngone. Indeed, I wonder how you can think of turmoiling yourself to the\r\nend of the chapter, and let the opportunity slip of contemplating at\r\nyour ease the beauties of Nature, so bountifully spread out to\r\nenlighten, to captivate, and to cheer the heart of man. For my part,\r\nI am still of the same mind that I was in when in London, and that is,\r\n_I would rather be herding sheep on Mickley bank top than remain in\r\nLondon, although for doing so I was to be made the premier of England_.”\r\nBewick was truly a _country_ man; he felt that it was better “to hear\r\nthe lark sing than the mouse cheep;” for, though no person was capable\r\nof closer application to his art when within doors, he loved to spend\r\nhis hours of relaxation in the open air, studying the character of\r\nbeasts and birds in their natural state; and diligently noting those\r\nlittle incidents and traits of country life which give so great an\r\ninterest to many of his tail-pieces. When a young man, he was fond of\r\nangling; and, like Roger Ascham, he “dearly loved a main of cocks.” When\r\nannoyed by street-walkers in London, he used to assume the air of a\r\nstupid countryman, and, in reply to their importunity, would ask, with\r\nan expression of stolid gravity, if they knew “Tommy Hummel o’ Prudhoe,\r\nWilly Eltringham o’ Hall-Yards, or Auld Laird Newton o’\r\nMickley?”[VII-39] He thus, without losing his temper, or showing any\r\nfeeling of annoyance, soon got quit of those who wished to engage his\r\nattention, though sometimes not until he had received a hearty\r\nmalediction for his stupidity.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-39: Humble, Eltringham, and Newton were the names of\r\n    three of his country acquaintances; Prudhoe, Hall-Yards, and\r\n    Mickley are places near Ovingham.]\r\n\r\nIn 1777, on his return to Newcastle, he entered into partnership with\r\nMr. Beilby; and his younger brother, John Bewick, who was then about\r\nseventeen years old, became their apprentice. From this time Bewick,\r\nthough he continued to assist his partner in the other branches of their\r\nbusiness,[VII-40] applied himself chiefly to engraving on wood. The cuts\r\nin an edition of Gay’s Fables, 1779,[VII-41] and in an edition of Select\r\nFables, 1784, both printed by T. Saint, Newcastle, were engraved by\r\nBewick, who was probably assisted by his brother. Several of those cuts\r\nare well engraved, though by no means to be compared to his later works,\r\nexecuted when he had acquired greater knowledge of the art, and more\r\nconfidence in his own powers. He evidently improved as his talents were\r\nexercised; for the cuts in the Select Fables, 1784, are generally much\r\nsuperior to those in Gay’s Fables, 1779; the animals are better drawn\r\nand engraved; the sketches of landscape in the back-grounds are more\r\nnatural; and the engraving of the foliage of the trees and bushes is,\r\nnot unfrequently, scarce inferior to that of his later productions. Such\r\nan attention to nature in this respect is not to be found in any\r\nwood-cuts of an earlier date. The following impressions from two of the\r\noriginal cuts in the Select Fables are fair specimens; one is\r\ninteresting, as being Bewick’s first idea of a favourite vignette in his\r\nBritish Land Birds; the other as his first treatment of the lion and the\r\nfour bulls, afterwards repeated in his Quadrupeds. In the best cuts of\r\nthe time of Durer and Holbein the foliage is generally neglected; the\r\nartists of that period merely give general forms of trees, without ever\r\nattending to that which contributes so much to their beauty. The merit\r\nof introducing this great improvement in wood engraving, and of\r\ndepicting quadrupeds and birds in their natural forms, and with their\r\ncharacteristic expression, is undoubtedly due to Bewick. Though he was\r\nnot the discoverer of the art of wood engraving, he certainly was the\r\nfirst who applied it with success to the delineation of animals, and to\r\nthe natural representation of landscape and woodland scenery. He found\r\nfor himself a path which no previous wood engraver had trodden, and in\r\nwhich none of his successors have gone beyond him. For several of the\r\ncuts in the Select Fables, Bewick was paid only nine shillings each.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-40: Bewick could engrave on copper, but did not\r\n    excel in this branch of engraving. The following are the principal\r\n    copper-plates which are known to be of his engraving. Plates in\r\n    Consett’s Tour through Sweden, Swedish Lapland, Finland, and\r\n    Denmark, 4to. Stockton, 1789; The Whitley large Ox, 1789; and the\r\n    remarkable Kyloe Ox, bred in the Mull, Argyleshire, 1790--A set of\r\n    silver buttons, containing sporting devices, engraved by Bewick\r\n    for the late H. U. Reay, Esq. of Killingworth, which passed into\r\n    the possession of Mr. Reay’s son-in-law, Matthew Bell, Esq. of\r\n    Wolsingham.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-41: Mr. Atkinson says that “about the same time he\r\n    executed the cuts [sixty-two in number] for a small child’s book,\r\n    entitled ‘A pretty Book of Pictures for little Masters and Misses,\r\n    or Tommy Trip’s History of Beasts and Birds.’”--An edition of the\r\n    Select Fables, with very bad wood-cuts, was printed by Mr. Saint\r\n    in 1776. The person by whom they were engraved is unknown. Bewick\r\n    always denied that any of them were of his engraving.]\r\n\r\nIn 1789 he drew and engraved his large cut of the Chillingham\r\nBull,[VII-42] which many persons suppose to be his master-piece; but\r\nthough it is certainly well engraved, and the character of the animal is\r\nwell expressed, yet as a wood engraving it will not bear a comparison\r\nwith several of the cuts in his History of British Birds. The grass and\r\nthe foliage of the trees are most beautifully expressed; but there is a\r\nwant of variety in the more distant trees, and the bark of that in the\r\nfore-ground to the left is too rough. This exaggeration of the roughness\r\nof the bark of trees is also to be perceived in many of his other cuts.\r\nThe style in which the bull is engraved is admirably adapted to express\r\nthe texture of the short white hair of the animal; the dewlap, however,\r\nis not well represented, it appears to be stiff instead of flaccid and\r\npendulous; and the lines intended for the hairs on its margin are too\r\n_wiry_. On a stone in the fore-ground he has introduced a _bit_ of\r\ncross-hatching, but not with good effect, for it causes the stone to\r\nlook very much like an old scrubbing-brush. Bewick was not partial to\r\ncross-hatching, and it is seldom to be found in cuts of his engraving.\r\nHe seems to have introduced it in this cut rather to show to those who\r\nknew anything of the matter that he could engrave such lines, than from\r\nan opinion that they were necessary, or in the slightest degree improved\r\nthe cut. This is almost the only instance in which Bewick has introduced\r\nblack lines crossing each other, and thus forming what is usually called\r\n“cross-hatchings.” From the commencement of his career as a wood\r\nengraver, he adopted a much more simple method of obtaining colour. He\r\nvery justly considered, that, as impressions of wood-cuts are printed\r\nfrom lines engraved in _relief_, the unengraved surface of the block\r\nalready represented the darkest colour that could be produced; and\r\nconsequently, instead of labouring to produce colour in the same manner\r\nas the old wood engravers, he commenced upon colour or black, and\r\nproceeded from _dark to light_ by means of lines cut in intaglio, and\r\nappearing white when in the impression, until his subject was completed.\r\nThis great simplification of the old process was the result of his\r\nhaving to engrave his own drawings; for in drawing his subject on the\r\nwood he avoided all combinations of lines which to the designer are\r\neasy, but to the engraver difficult. In almost every one of his cuts the\r\neffect is produced by the simplest means. The colour which the old wood\r\nengravers obtained by means of cross-hatchings, Bewick obtained with\r\nmuch greater facility by means of single lines, and masses of black\r\nslightly intersected or broken with white.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-42: This cut was executed for Marmaduke Tunstall,\r\n    Esq. of Wycliffe, near Greta Bridge, in Yorkshire.]\r\n\r\nWhen only a few impressions of the Chillingham Bull had been taken, and\r\nbefore he had added his name, the block split. The pressmen, it is said,\r\ngot tipsy over their work, and left the block lying on the window-sill\r\nexposed to the rays of the sun, which caused it to warp and\r\nsplit.[VII-43] About six impressions were taken on thin vellum before\r\nthe accident occurred. Mr. Atkinson says that one of those impressions,\r\nwhich had formerly belonged to Mr. Beilby, Bewick’s partner, was sold in\r\nLondon for twenty pounds; A. Stothard, R.A., had one, as had also Mr.\r\nC. Nesbit.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-43: The block remained in several pieces until 1817,\r\n    when they were firmly united by means of cramps, and a number of\r\n    impressions printed off. These impressions are without the border,\r\n    which distinguishes the earlier ones. The border, which was\r\n    engraved on separate pieces, enclosed the principal cut in the\r\n    manner of a frame.]\r\n\r\nTowards the latter end of 1785 Bewick began to engrave the cuts for his\r\nGeneral History of Quadrupeds, which was first printed in 1790.[VII-44]\r\nThe descriptions were written by his partner, Mr. Beilby, and the cuts\r\nwere all drawn and engraved by himself. The comparative excellence of\r\nthose cuts, which, for the correct delineation of the animals and the\r\nnatural character of the _incidents_, and the back-grounds, are greatly\r\nsuperior to anything of the kind that had previously appeared, insured a\r\nrapid sale for the work; a second edition was published in 1791, and a\r\nthird in 1792.[VII-45]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-44: A Prospectus containing specimens of the cuts\r\n    was printed in 1787.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-45: The first edition consisted of fifteen hundred\r\n    copies in demy octavo at 8_s._, and one hundred royal at 12_s._\r\n    The price of the demy copies of the _eighth_ edition, published in\r\n    1825, was £1 1_s._ A proof of the estimation in which the work\r\n    continued to be held.]\r\n\r\nThe great merit of those cuts consists not so much in their execution as\r\nin the spirited and natural manner in which they are drawn. Some of the\r\nanimals, indeed, which he had not had an opportunity of seeing, and for\r\nwhich he had to depend on the previous engravings of others, are not\r\ncorrectly drawn. Among the most incorrect are the Bison, the Zebu, the\r\nBuffalo, the Many-horned Sheep, the Gnu, and the Giraffe or\r\nCameleopard.[VII-46] Even in some of our domestic quadrupeds he was not\r\nsuccessful; the Horses are not well represented; and the very\r\nindifferent execution of the Common Bull and Cow, at page 19, edition\r\n1790, is only redeemed by the interest of the back-grounds. In that of\r\nthe Common Bull, the action of the bull seen chasing a man is most\r\nexcellent; and in that of the Cow, the woman, with a _skeel_ on her\r\nhead, and her petticoats tucked up behind, returning from milking, is\r\nevidently a sketch from nature. The Goats and the Dogs are the best of\r\nthose cuts both in design and execution; and perhaps the very best of\r\nall the cuts in the first edition is that of the Cur Fox at page 270.\r\nThe tail of the animal, which is too long, and is also incorrectly\r\nmarked with black near the white tip, was subsequently altered.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-46: The cut of the Giraffe in the edition of 1824 is\r\n    not the original one engraved by Bewick. In the later cut, which\r\n    was chiefly engraved by W. W. Temple, one of Bewick’s pupils, the\r\n    marks on the body of the animal appear like so many white-coloured\r\n    lines crossing each other, and enclosing large irregular spots.]\r\n\r\nIn the first edition the characteristic tail-pieces are comparatively\r\nfew; and several of those which are merely ornamental, displaying\r\nneither imagination nor feeling, are copies of cuts which are frequent\r\nin books printed at Leipsic between 1770 and 1780, and which were\r\nprobably engraved by Ungher, a German wood engraver of that period.\r\nExamples of such tasteless trifles are to be found at pages 9, 12, 18,\r\n65, 110, 140, 201, 223, and 401. Ornaments of the same character occur\r\nin Heineken’s “Idée Générale d’une Collection complette d’Estampes,”\r\nLeipsic and Vienna, 1771. Bewick was unquestionably better acquainted\r\nwith the history and progress of wood engraving than those who talk\r\nabout the “long-lost art” were aware of. The first of the two following\r\ncuts is a fac-simile of a tail-piece which occurs in an edition of “Der\r\nWeiss Kunig,”[VII-47] printed at Vienna, 1775, and which Bewick has\r\ncopied at page 144 of the first edition of the Quadrupeds, 1790. The\r\nsecond, from one of the cuts illustrative of Ovid’s Metamorphoses, 1569,\r\ndesigned by Virgil Solis,[VII-48] is copied in a tail-piece in the first\r\nvolume of Bewick’s Birds, page 330, edition 1797.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-47: Some account of this work is previously given at\r\n    page287.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-48: This work is noticed at page 407.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe following may be mentioned as the best of the tail-pieces in the\r\nfirst edition of the Quadrupeds, and as those which most decidedly\r\ndisplay Bewick’s talent in depicting, without exaggeration, natural and\r\nhumorous incidents. In this respect he has been excelled by no other\r\nartist either of past or present times. The Elephant, fore-shortened, at\r\npage 162; the Dog and Cat, 195; the Old Man crossing a ford, mounted on\r\nan old horse, which carries, in addition, two heavy sacks, 244; the\r\nBear-ward, with his wife and companion, leading Bruin, and accompanied\r\nby his dancing-dogs,--a gallows seen in the distance, 256; a Fox, with\r\nMagpies flying after him, indicating his course to his pursuers, 265;\r\nTwo unfeeling fellows enjoying the pleasure of hanging a dog,--a gibbet,\r\nseen in the distance, to denote that those who could thus quietly enjoy\r\nthe dying struggles of a dog would not be unlikely to murder a man, 274;\r\na Man eating his dinner with his dog sitting beside him, expecting his\r\nshare, 285; Old Blind Man led by a dog, crossing a bridge of a single\r\nplank, and with the rail broken, in a storm of wind and rain, 320; a Mad\r\nDog pursued by three men,--a feeble old woman directly in the dog’s way,\r\n324; a Man with a bundle at his back, crossing a stream on stilts, 337;\r\na winter piece,--a Man travelling in the snow, 339; a grim-visaged Old\r\nMan, accompanied by a cur-dog, driving an old sow, 371; Two Boys and an\r\nAss on a common, 375; a Man leaping, by means of a pole, a stream,\r\nacross which he has previously thrown his stick and bag, 391; a Man\r\ncarrying a bundle of faggots on the ice, 395; a Wolf falling into a\r\ntrap, 430; and Two Blind Fiddlers and a Boy, the last in the book, at\r\n456. In this cut Bewick has represented the two blind fiddlers earnestly\r\nscraping away, although there is no one to listen to their strains; the\r\nbare-legged _tatty_-headed boy who leads them, and the half-starved\r\nmelancholy-looking dog at their heels, are in admirable keeping with the\r\nprincipal characters.\r\n\r\nOn the next page is a copy of the cut of the Two Boys and the Ass,\r\npreviously mentioned as occurring at page 375. This cut, beyond any\r\nother of the tail-pieces in the first edition of the Quadrupeds, perhaps\r\naffords the best specimen of Bewick’s peculiar talent of depicting such\r\nsubjects; he faithfully represents Nature, and at the same time conveys\r\na moral, which gives additional interest to the sketch. Though the ass\r\nremains immoveable, in spite of the application of a branch of furze to\r\nhis hind quarters, the young graceless who is mounted evidently enjoys\r\nhis seat. The pleasure of the twain consists as much in having _caught_\r\nan ass as in the prospect of a ride. To such characters the stubborn ass\r\nfrequently affords more _amusement_ than a willing goer; they like to\r\nflog and thump a thing well, though it be but a gate-post. The gallows\r\nin the distance--a favourite _in terrorem_ object with Bewick--suggests\r\ntheir ultimate destiny; and the cut, in the first edition, derives\r\nadditional _point_ from its situation among the animals found in _New\r\nSouth Wales_,--the first shipment of convicts to Botany Bay having taken\r\nplace about two years previous to the publication of the work. This cut,\r\nas well as many others in the book, affords an instance of\r\nlowering,--the light appearance of the distance is entirely effected by\r\nthat process.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe subsequent editions of the Quadrupeds were enlarged by the addition\r\nof new matter and the insertion of several new cuts. Of these, with the\r\nexception of the Kyloe Ox,[VII-49] the tail-pieces are by far the best.\r\nThe following are the principal cuts of animals that have been added\r\nsince the first publication of the work; the pages annexed refer to the\r\nedition of 1824, the last that was published in Bewick’s life-time: the\r\nArabian Horse, page 4,--the stallion, seen in the back-ground, has\r\nsuffered a dismemberment since its first appearance;[VII-50] the Old\r\nEnglish Road Horse, 9; the Improved Cart Horse, 14; the Kyloe Ox, 36;\r\nthe Musk Bull, 49; the Black-faced, or Heath Ram, 56; Heath Ram of the\r\nImproved Breed, 57; The Cheviot Ram, 58; Tees-water Ram of the Old\r\nBreed, 60; Tees-water Ram, Improved Breed, 61; the American Elk, 125;\r\nSow of the Improved Breed, 164; Sow of the Chinese Breed, 166; Head of a\r\nHippopotamus, (engraved by W. W. Temple,) 185; Indian Bear, 293; Polar,\r\nor Great White Bear, substituted for another cut of the same animal,\r\n295; the Spotted Hyena, substituted for another cut of the same animal,\r\n301; the Ban-dog, 338; the Irish Greyhound, 340; the Harrier, 347;\r\nSpotted Bavy, substituted for another cut of the same animal, 379; the\r\nGrey Squirrel, 387; the Long-tailed Squirrel, 396; the Jerboa,\r\nsubstituted for another cut of the same animal, 397; the Musquash, or\r\nMusk Beaver, 416; the Mouse, substituted for another cut of the same\r\nanimal, 424; the Short-eared Bat, 513; the Long-eared Bat, 515; the\r\nTernate Bat, 518; the Wombach, 523; and the Ornithorhynchus Paradoxicus,\r\n525. The cut of the animal called the Thick-nosed Tapiir, at page 139 of\r\nthe first edition, is transposed to page 381 of the last edition, and\r\nthere described under the name of the Capibara: it is probably intended\r\nfor the Coypu rat, a specimen of which is at present in the Gardens of\r\nthe Zoological Society, Regent’s Park. Bewick was a regular visitor of\r\nall the wild-beast shows that came to Newcastle, and availed himself of\r\nevery opportunity to obtain drawings from living animals.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-49: The Kyloe Ox, which occurs at page 36 of the\r\n    edition of 1824, the last that was published in Bewick’s\r\n    life-time, is one of the very best cuts of a quadruped that he\r\n    ever engraved. The drawing is excellent, and the characteristic\r\n    form and general appearance of the animal are represented in a\r\n    manner that has never been excelled.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-50: The Lancashire _Bull_, of the first edition, by\r\n    a similar process has been converted into the Lancashire _Ox_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe tail-pieces introduced in subsequent editions of the Quadrupeds\r\ngenerally display more humour and not less talent in representing\r\nnatural objects than those contained in the first. In the annexed cut of\r\na sour-visaged old fellow going with corn to the mill, we have an\r\nexemplification of cruelty not unworthy of Hogarth.[VII-51] The\r\nover-laden, half-starved old horse,--broken-kneed, greasy-heeled, and\r\nevidently troubled with the string-halt, as is indicated by the action\r\nof the _off_ hind-leg,--hesitates to descend the brae, at the foot of\r\nwhich there is a stream, and the old brute on his back urges him forward\r\nby _working_ him, as jockeys say, with the halter, and beating him with\r\nhis stick. In the distance, Bewick, as is usual with him when he gives a\r\nsketch of cruelty or knavery, has introduced a gallows. The miserable\r\nappearance of the poor animal is not a little increased by the nakedness\r\nof his hind quarters; his stump of a tail is so short that it will not\r\neven serve as a _catch_ for the crupper or _tail-band_.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-51: The originals of this and the three following\r\n    cuts occur respectively at pages 13, 15, 69, and 526 of the\r\n    edition of 1824. The other principal tail-pieces in this edition\r\n    are: Greyhound-coursing, (originally engraved on a silver cup for\r\n    a person at Northallerton,) drawn by Bewick on the block, but\r\n    engraved by W. W. Temple, page x, at the end of the Index; the Old\r\n    Coachman and the Young Squire, 12; Tinker’s Children in a pair of\r\n    panniers on the back of an Ass, 21; a Cow drinking, 28; Winter\r\n    scene, 34; Two Men digging, (engraved by H. White, who also\r\n    engraved the cut of the Musk Bull at page 49,) 37; Dog worrying a\r\n    Sheep, 62; Old Soldier travelling in the rain, 117; Smelling,\r\n    tail-piece to the Genet, a _strong bit_, 269; Drunken Man making\r\n    his Dam, 378; and Seals on a large piece of floating ice, 510.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the cut of the child, unconscious of its danger, pulling at the long\r\ntail of a young unbroken colt, the story is most admirably told. The\r\nnurse, who is seen engaged with her sweetheart by the side of the hedge,\r\nhas left the child to wander at will, and thus expose itself to\r\ndestruction; while the mother, who has accidentally perceived the danger\r\nof her darling, is seen hastening over the stile, regardless of the\r\nsteps, in an agony of fear. The backward glance of the horse’s eye, and\r\nthe heel raised ready to strike, most forcibly suggest the danger to\r\nwhich the unthinking infant is exposed.\r\n\r\nThough the subject of the following cut be simple, yet the _sentiment_\r\nwhich it displays is the genuine offspring of true genius. Near to a\r\nruined cottage, while all around is covered with snow, a lean and hungry\r\newe is seen nibbling at an old broom, while her young and weakly lamb is\r\nsucking her milkless teats. Such a picture of animal want--conceived\r\nwith so much feeling, and so well expressed,--has perhaps never been\r\nrepresented by any artist except Bewick.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe original of the following cut forms the tail-piece to the last page\r\nof the edition of 1824. An old man, wearing a parson’s cast-off beaver\r\nand wig, is seen carrying his young wife and child across a stream. The\r\ncomplacent look of the cock-nosed wife shows that she enjoys the treat,\r\nwhile the old drudge patiently bears his burden, and with his right hand\r\nkeeps a firm _grip_ of the nether end of his better part. This cut is an\r\nexcellent satire on those old men who marry young wives and become\r\ndotingly uxorious in the decline of life; submitting to every indignity\r\nto please their youthful spouses and reconcile them to their state. It\r\nis a _new reading_ of January and May,--he an old travelling beggar, and\r\nshe a young slut with her heels peeping, or rather staring, through her\r\nstockings.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nMr. Solomon Hodgson, the printer of the first four editions of the\r\nQuadrupeds, had an interest in the work; he died in 1800; and in\r\nconsequence of a misunderstanding between his widow and Bewick, the\r\nlatter had the subsequent editions printed at the office of Mr. Edward\r\nWalker. Mrs. Hodgson having asserted, in a letter printed in the Monthly\r\nMagazine for July 1805, that Bewick was neither the author nor the\r\nprojector of the History of Quadrupeds, but “was employed merely as the\r\nengraver or wood-cutter,” he, in justification of his own claims, gave\r\nthe following account of the origin of the work.[VII-52] “From my first\r\nreading, when a boy at school, a sixpenny History of Birds and Beasts,\r\nand a then wretched composition called the History of Three Hundred\r\nAnimals, to the time I became acquainted with works on Natural History\r\nwritten for the perusal of men, I never was without the design of\r\nattempting something of this kind myself; but my principal object was\r\n(and still is) directed to the mental pleasure and improvement of youth;\r\nto engage their attention, to direct their steps aright, and to lead\r\nthem on till they become enamoured of this innocent and delightful\r\npursuit. Some time after my partnership with Mr. Beilby commenced,\r\nI communicated my wishes to him, who, after many conversations, came\r\ninto my plan of publishing a History of Quadrupeds, and I then\r\nimmediately began to draw the animals, to design the vignettes, and to\r\ncut them on wood, and this, to avoid interruption, frequently till very\r\nlate in the night; my partner at the same time undertaking to compile\r\nand draw up the descriptions and history at his leisure hours and\r\nevenings at home. With the accounts of the foreign animals I did not\r\nmuch interfere; the sources whence I had drawn the little knowledge I\r\npossessed were open to my coadjutor, and he used them; but to those of\r\nthe animals of our own country, as my partner before this time had paid\r\nlittle attention to natural history, I lent a helping hand. This help\r\nwas given in daily conversations, and in occasional notes and memoranda,\r\nwhich were used in their proper places. As the cuts were engraved, we\r\nemployed the late Mr. Thomas Angus, of this town, printer, to take off a\r\ncertain number of impressions of each, many of which are still in my\r\npossession. At Mr. Angus’s death the charge for this business was not\r\nmade in his books, and at the request of his widow and ourselves, the\r\nlate Mr. Solomon Hodgson fixed the price; and yet the widow and\r\nexecutrix of Mr. Hodgson asserts in your Magazine, that I was ‘merely\r\nemployed as the engraver or wood-cutter,’ (I suppose) by her husband!\r\nHad this been the case, is it probable that Mr. Hodgson would have had\r\nthe cuts printed in any other office than his own? The fact is the\r\nreverse of Mrs. Hodgson’s statement; and although I have never, either\r\n‘insidiously’ or otherwise, used any means to cause the reviewers, or\r\nothers, to hold me up as the ‘first and sole mover of the concern,’ I am\r\nnow dragged forth by her to declare that _I am the man_.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-52: This account is extracted from a letter written\r\n    by Bewick, and printed in the Monthly Magazine for November 1805.]\r\n\r\n“But to return to my story:--while we were in the progress of our work,\r\nprudence suggested that it might be necessary to inquire how our labours\r\nwere to be ushered to the world, and, as we were unacquainted with the\r\nprinting and publishing of books, what mode was the most likely to\r\ninsure success. Upon this subject Mr. Hodgson was consulted, and made\r\nfully acquainted with our plan. He entered into the undertaking with\r\nuncommon ardour, and urged us strenuously not to retain our first humble\r\nnotions of ‘making it like a school-book,’ but pressed us to let it\r\n‘assume a more respectable form.’ From this warmth of our friend we had\r\nno hesitation in offering him a share in the work, and a copartnership\r\ndeed was entered into between us, for that purpose, on the 10th of April\r\n1790. What Mr. Hodgson did in correcting the press, beyond what falls to\r\nthe duty of every printer, I know not; but I am certain that he was\r\nextremely desirous that it should have justice done it. In this _weaving\r\nof words_ I did not interfere, as I believed it to be in hands much\r\nfitter than my own, only I took the liberty of blotting out whatever I\r\nknew not to be truth.”\r\n\r\nThe favourable manner in which the History of Quadrupeds was received\r\ndetermined Bewick to commence without delay his History of British\r\nBirds. He began to draw and engrave the cuts in 1791, and in 1797 the\r\nfirst volume of the work, containing the Land Birds, was\r\npublished.[VII-53] The letter-press, as in the Quadrupeds, was written\r\nby his partner, Mr. Beilby, who certainly deserves great praise for the\r\nmanner in which he has performed his task. The descriptions generally\r\nhave the great merit of being simple, intelligible, and correct. There\r\nare no trifling details about system, no confused arguments about\r\nclassification, which more frequently bewilder than inform the reader\r\nwho is uninitiated in the piebald jargon of what is called “Systematic\r\nnomenclature.” He describes the quadruped or bird in a manner which\r\nenables even the most unlearned to recognize it when he sees it; and,\r\nlike one who is rather wishful to inform his readers than to display his\r\nown acquaintance with the scientific vocabulary, he carefully avoids the\r\nuse of all terms which are not generally understood. Mr. Beilby, though\r\nin a different manner and in a less degree, is fairly entitled to share\r\nwith Bewick in the honour of having rendered popular in this country the\r\nstudy of the most interesting and useful branches of Zoology--Quadrupeds\r\nand Birds--by giving the descriptions in simple and intelligible\r\nlanguage, and presenting to the eye the very form and character of the\r\nliving animals. As a copper-plate engraver, Mr. Beilby has certainly no\r\njust pretensions to fame; but as a compiler, and as an able coadjutor of\r\nBewick in simplifying the study of Natural History, and rendering its\r\nmost interesting portions easy of attainment to the young, and to those\r\nunacquainted with the “science,” he deserves higher praise than he has\r\nhitherto generally received. Roger Thornton’s Monument, and the Plan of\r\nNewcastle, in the Reverend John Brand’s History of that town, were\r\nengraved by Mr. Beilby. Mr. Brand’s book-plate was also engraved by him.\r\nIt is to be found in most of the books that formerly belonged to that\r\ncelebrated antiquary, who is well known to all collectors from the\r\nextent of his purchases at stalls, and the number of curious old books\r\nwhich he thus occasionally obtained.--The Reverend William Turner, of\r\nNewcastle, in a letter printed in the Monthly Magazine for June 1801,\r\nvindicates the character of Mr. Beilby from what he considers the\r\ndetractions of Dr. Gleig, in an article on Wood-cuts in the Supplement\r\nto the Encyclopedia Britannica. Mr. Beilby was a native of the city of\r\nDurham, and was brought up as a silversmith and seal-engraver under his\r\nfather. He died at Newcastle on the 4th of January 1817, in the\r\nseventy-fourth year of his age.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-53: Of this edition, 1,874 copies were printed,--one\r\n    thousand demy octavo, at 10_s._ 6_d._; eight hundred and fifty\r\n    thin and thick royal, at 13_s._, and 15_s._; and twenty-four\r\n    imperial at £1 1_s._ The first edition of the second volume, 1804,\r\n    consisted of the same number of copies as the first, but the\r\n    prices were respectively 12_s._, 15_s._, 18_s._ and £1 4_s._]\r\n\r\nThe partnership between Beilby and Bewick having been dissolved in 1797,\r\nshortly after the publication of the first volume of the Birds, the\r\ndescriptions in the second, which did not appear till 1804, were written\r\nby Bewick himself, but revised by the Reverend Henry Cotes, vicar of\r\nBedlington. The publication of this volume formed the key-stone of\r\nBewick’s fame as a designer and engraver on wood; for though the cuts\r\nare not superior to those of the first, they are not excelled, nor\r\nindeed equalled, by any that he afterwards executed. The subsequent\r\nadditions, whether as cuts of birds or tail-pieces, are not so excellent\r\nas numerous--in this respect the reverse of the additions to the\r\nQuadrupeds. Though all the birds were designed, and nearly all of them\r\nengraved by Bewick himself, there are yet living witnesses who can\r\ntestify that both in the drawing and the engraving of the tail-pieces he\r\nreceived very considerable assistance from his pupils, more especially\r\nfrom Robert Johnson as a draftsman, and Luke Clennell as a wood\r\nengraver.[VII-54] Before saying anything further on this subject, it\r\nseems necessary to give the following passage from Mr. Atkinson’s Sketch\r\nof the Life and Works of Bewick. “With regard to the circumstance that\r\nthe _British Birds_, with very few exceptions, were finished by his own\r\nhand, I have it in my power to pledge myself. I had been a good deal\r\nsurprised one day by hearing a gentleman assert that very few of them\r\nwere his own work, all the easy parts being executed by his pupils.\r\nI saw him the same day, and, talking of his art, inquired if he\r\npermitted the assistance of his apprentices in many cases? He said, ‘No;\r\nit had seldom happened, and then they had injured the cuts very much.’\r\nI inquired if he could remember any of them in which he had received\r\nassistance? He said, ‘Aye: I can soon tell you them;’ and, after a few\r\nminutes’ consideration, he made out, with his daughter’s assistance,\r\n_the Whimbrel_, _Tufted Duck_, and _Lesser Tern_:[VII-55] he tried to\r\nrecollect more, and turning to his daughter, said, ‘Jane, honey, dost\r\nthou remember any more?’ She considered a little, and said, ‘No: she did\r\nnot; but that certainly there were not half a dozen in all:’ those we\r\nboth pressed him to do over again. ‘He intended it,’ he said; but, alas!\r\nthis intention was prevented. In some cases, I am informed, he made his\r\npupils block out for him; that is, furnished them with an outline, and\r\nlet them cut away the edges of the block to that line; but as, in this\r\ncase, the assistance rendered is much the same as that afforded by a\r\nturner’s apprentice when he rounds off the heavy mass of wood in\r\nreadiness for a more experienced hand, but not a line of whose\r\nperformance remains in the beautiful toy it becomes, it does not\r\nmaterially shake the authenticity of the work in question.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-54: Pinkerton having stated in his Scottish Gallery,\r\n    on the authority of Messrs. Morison, printers, of Perth, that\r\n    Bewick, “observing the uncommon genius of his late apprentice,\r\n    Robert Johnson, employed him to trace the figures on the wood in\r\n    the History of Quadrupeds,” Bewick, in his letter, printed in the\r\n    Monthly Magazine for November 1805, previously quoted, thus denies\r\n    the assertion: “It is only necessary for me to declare, and this\r\n    will be attested by my partner Mr. Beilby, who compiled the\r\n    History of Quadrupeds, and was a proprietor of the work, that\r\n    neither Robert Johnson, nor any person but myself, made the\r\n    drawings, or traced or cut them on the wood.”--Robert Johnson was\r\n    employed by Messrs. Morison to copy for the Scottish Gallery\r\n    several portraits at Taymouth Castle, the seat of the Earl of\r\n    Breadalbane. Bewick in this letter carefully avoids pleading to\r\n    that with which he was not charged; he does not deny that several\r\n    of the drawings of the tail-pieces in the History of British Birds\r\n    were made by Robert Johnson. A pupil of Bewick’s, now living, saw\r\n    many of Johnson’s drawings for these cuts, and sat beside Clennell\r\n    when he was engraving them.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-55: These three cuts were engraved by one of\r\n    Bewick’s pupils, named Henry Hole. Neither Bewick’s memory nor his\r\n    daughter’s had been accurate on this occasion; but not one of the\r\n    other cuts which they failed to recollect can be compared with\r\n    those engraved by Bewick himself. In addition to those three, the\r\n    following, not engraved by Bewick himself, had appeared at the\r\n    time the above conversation took place--some time between 1825 and\r\n    1826:--the Brent Goose, the Lesser Imber, and the Cormorant,\r\n    engraved by L. Clennell; the Velvet Duck, the Red-breasted\r\n    Merganser, and the Crested Cormorant, by H. Hole; the Rough-legged\r\n    Falcon, the Pigmy Sand-piper, the Red Sand-piper, and the Eared\r\n    Grebe, by W. W. Temple.]\r\n\r\nThough it is evident that Bewick meant here simply to assert that all\r\nthe _figures_ of the _birds_, except the few which he mentions, were\r\nentirely engraved by himself, yet his biographer always speaks as if\r\n_every one_ of the cuts in the work--both birds and tail-pieces--were\r\nexclusively engraved by Bewick himself; and in consequence of this\r\nerroneous opinion he refers to seven cuts[VII-56] as affording\r\nfavourable instances of Bewick’s manner of representing water, although\r\n_not one_ of them was engraved by him, but by Luke Clennell, from\r\ndrawings by himself or by Robert Johnson. Mr. Atkinson, in his\r\nadmiration of Bewick, and in his desire to exaggerate his fame, entirely\r\noverlooks the merits of those by whom he was assisted. Charlton Nesbit\r\nand Luke Clennell rendered him more assistance, though not in the cuts\r\nof birds, than such as that “afforded by a turner’s apprentice when he\r\nrounds off the heavy mass of wood;” and Robert Johnson, who designed\r\nmany of the best of the tail-pieces, drew the human figure more\r\ncorrectly than Bewick himself, and in landscape-drawing was at least his\r\nequal. These observations are not intended in the least to detract from\r\nBewick’s just and deservedly great reputation, but to correct the\r\nerroneous opinions which have been promulgated on this subject by\r\npersons who knew nothing of the very considerable assistance which he\r\nreceived from his pupils in the drawing and engraving of the tail-pieces\r\nin his history of British Birds.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-56: “He never could, he said, please himself in his\r\n    representations of water in a state of motion, and a horse\r\n    galloping: his taste must have been fastidious indeed, if that\r\n    beautiful moonlight scene at sea, page 120, vol. ii. [edition\r\n    1816]; the river scene at page 126; the sea breaking among the\r\n    rocks at page 168, or 177, or 200, or 216; or the rippling of the\r\n    water as it leaves the feet of the old fisherman, at page 95, did\r\n    not satisfy him.” In scarcely one of the cuts engraved by Bewick\r\n    himself is water in a state of motion well represented. He knew\r\n    his own deficiency in this respect; though Mr. Atkinson, not being\r\n    able to distinguish the cuts engraved by Bewick himself from those\r\n    engraved by his pupils, cannot perceive it.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThough three of the best specimens of Bewick’s talents as a designer and\r\nengraver on wood--the Bittern, the Wood-cock, and the Common\r\nDuck[VII-57]--are to be found in the second volume, containing the\r\nwater-birds, yet the land-birds in the first volume, from his being more\r\nfamiliar with their habits, and in consequence of their allowing more\r\nscope for the display of Bewick’s excellence in the representation of\r\nfoliage, are, on the whole, superior both in design and execution to the\r\nothers; their characteristic attitude and expression are represented\r\nwith the greatest truth, while, from the propriety of the back-grounds,\r\nand the beauty of the trees and foliage, almost every cut forms a\r\nperfect little picture. Bewick’s talent in pourtraying the form and\r\ncharacter of birds is seen to great advantage in the hawks and the owls;\r\nbut his excellence, both as a designer and engraver on wood, is yet more\r\nstrikingly displayed in several of the other cuts contained in the same\r\nvolume, and among these the following are perhaps the best. The numbers\r\nrefer to the pages of the first edition of the Land Birds, 1797. The\r\nField-fare, page 98; the Yellow Bunting, a most exquisite cut, and\r\nconsidered by Bewick as the best that he ever engraved, 143; the\r\nGoldfinch, 165; the Skylark, 178; the Woodlark, 183; the Lesser and the\r\nWinter Fauvette, 212, 213; the Willow Wren, 222; the Wren, 227; the\r\nWhite-rump, 229; the Cole Titmouse, 241; the Night-Jar, 262; the\r\nDomestic Cock, 276; the Turkey, 286; the Pintado, 293; the Red Grouse,\r\n301; the Partridge, 305; the Quail, 308; and the Corncrake, 311.--Among\r\nthe Birds in the second volume, first edition, 1804, the following may\r\nbe instanced as the most excellent. The Water Crake, page 10; the Water\r\nRail, 13; the Bittern, 47; the Woodcock, 60; the Common Snipe, 68; the\r\nJudcock, or Jack Snipe, 73; the Dunlin, 117; the Dun Diver, 257; the\r\nGrey Lag Goose, 292; and the Common Duck, 333.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-57: The cut here given is engraved by Bewick at a\r\n    somewhat earlier date, for a once popular work entitled the\r\n    History of Three Hundred Animals, since incorporated in Mrs.\r\n    Loudon’s “Entertaining Naturalist.”]\r\n\r\nNothing of the same kind that wood engraving has produced since the time\r\nof Bewick can for a moment bear a comparison with these cuts. They are\r\nnot to be equalled till a designer and engraver shall arise possessed of\r\nBewick’s knowledge of nature, and endowed with his happy talent of\r\nexpressing it. Bewick has in this respect effected more by himself than\r\nhas been produced by one of our best wood engravers when working from\r\ndrawings made by a professional designer, but who knows nothing of\r\nbirds, of their habits, or the places which they frequent; and has not\r\nthe slightest feeling for natural incident or picturesque beauty.--No\r\nmere fac-simile engraver of a drawing ready made to his hand, should\r\nventure to speak slightingly of Bewick’s talents until he has both\r\n_drawn and engraved_ a cut which may justly challenge a comparison with\r\nthe Kyloe Ox, the Yellow-hammer, the Partridge, the Wood-cock, or the\r\nTame Duck.\r\n\r\nBewick’s style of engraving, as displayed in the Birds, is exclusively\r\nhis own. He adopts no conventional mode of representing texture or\r\nproducing an effect, but skilfully avails himself of the most simple and\r\neffective means which his art affords of faithfully and efficiently\r\nrepresenting his subject. He never wastes his time in laborious trifling\r\nto display his skill in execution;--he works with a higher aim, to\r\nrepresent nature; and, consequently, he never bestows his pains except\r\nto express a meaning. The manner in which he has represented the\r\nfeathers in many of his birds, is as admirable as it is perfectly\r\noriginal. His feeling for his subject, and his knowledge of his art,\r\nsuggest the best means of effecting his end, and the manner in which he\r\nhas employed them entitle him to rank as a wood engraver--without\r\nreference to his merits as a designer--among the very best that have\r\npractised the art.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nOur copy of his cut of the Partridge, though not equal to the original,\r\nwill perhaps to a certain extent serve to exemplify his practice. Every\r\nline that is to be perceived in this bird is the best that could have\r\nbeen devised to express the engraver’s perfect idea of his subject. The\r\nsoft downy plumage of the breast is represented by delicate black lines\r\ncrossed horizontally by white ones, and in order that they may appear\r\ncomparatively light in the impression, the block has in this part been\r\nlowered. The texture of the skin of the legs, and the marks of the toes,\r\nare expressed with the greatest accuracy; and the varied tints of the\r\nplumage of the rump, back, wings, and head, are indicated with no less\r\nfidelity.--Such a cut as this Bewick would execute in less time than a\r\nmodern French wood engraver would require to cut the delicate\r\ncross-hatchings necessary, according to French taste, to denote the grey\r\ncolour of a soldier’s great coat.\r\n\r\nThe cut of the Wood-cock, of which that on the next page is a copy, is\r\nanother instance of the able manner in which Bewick has availed himself\r\nof the capabilities of his art. He has here produced the most perfect\r\nlikeness of the bird that ever was engraved, and at the same time given\r\nto his subject an effect, by the skilful management of light and shade,\r\nwhich it is impossible to obtain by means of copper-plate engraving.\r\nBewick thoroughly understood the advantages of his art in this respect,\r\nand no wood engraver or designer, either ancient or modern, has employed\r\nthem with greater success, without sacrificing nature to mere effect.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nAmong the very best of Bewick’s cuts, as a specimen of wood engraving,\r\nis, as we have already said, the Common Duck. The round, full form of\r\nthe bird, is represented with the greatest fidelity; the plumage in all\r\nits downy, smooth, and glossy variety,--on the sides, the rump, the\r\nback, the wings, and the head,--is singularly true to nature; while the\r\nlegs and toes, and even the webs between the toes, are engraved in a\r\nmanner which proves the great attention that Bewick, when necessary,\r\npaid to the minutest points of detail. The effect of the whole is\r\nexcellent, and the back-ground, both in character and execution, is\r\nworthy of this master-piece of Bewick as a designer and engraver on\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nThe tail-pieces in the first editions of the Birds are, taken all\r\ntogether, the best that are to be found in any of Bewick’s works; but,\r\nthough it is not unlikely that he suggested the subjects, there is\r\nreason to believe that many of them were drawn by Robert Johnson, and\r\nthere cannot be a doubt that the greater number of those contained in\r\nthe second volume were engraved by Luke Clennell. Before saying anything\r\nmore about them, it seems necessary to give a list of those which were\r\neither not drawn or not engraved by Bewick himself; it has been\r\nfurnished by one of his early pupils who saw most of Johnson’s drawings,\r\nand worked in the same room with Clennell when he was engraving those\r\nwhich are here ascribed to him. The pages show where those cuts are to\r\nbe found in the edition of 1797 and in that of 1821.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          Editions\r\n\r\n  VOLUME I                                              1797    1821\r\n                                                        page    page\r\n\r\n  Boughs and Bird’s-nest, drawn and engraved by Charlton\r\n    Nesbit, preface                                        i       i\r\n  Sportsman and Old Shepherd, drawn by Robert Johnson,\r\n    engraved by Bewick, preface (transferred to Vol. ii.\r\n    preface, page vi. in the edition of 1821)             vi      --\r\n  Old Man breaking stones, drawn by R.

In the additional tail-pieces\r\nto be found in subsequent editions the greater number are not engraved\r\nby Bewick himself. In the last edition, published in 1832, there are at\r\nleast thirty engraved by his pupils subsequent to the time of Clennell.\r\n\r\nThe head-piece at the commencement of the introduction, volume I. page\r\nvii. drawn and engraved by Bewick himself, presents an excellent view of\r\na farm-yard. Everything is true to nature; the birds assembled near the\r\nwoman seen winnowing corn are, though on a small scale, represented with\r\nthe greatest fidelity; even among the smallest the wagtail can be\r\ndistinguished from the sparrow. The dog, feeling no interest in the\r\nbusiness, is seen quietly resting on the dunghill; but the chuckling of\r\nthe hens, announcing that something like eating is going forward, has\r\nevidently excited the attention of the old sow, and brought her and her\r\nlitter into the yard in the expectation of getting a share. The season,\r\nthe latter end of autumn, is indicated by the flight of field-fares, and\r\nthe comparatively naked appearance of the trees; and we perceive that it\r\nis a clear, bright day from the strong shadow of the ladder projected\r\nagainst the wall, and on the thatched roof of the outhouse. A heron,\r\na crow, and a magpie are perceived nailed against the gable end of the\r\nbarn; and a couple of pigeons are seen flying above the house. The cut\r\nforms at once an interesting picture of country life, and a graphic\r\nsummary of the contents of the work.\r\n\r\nAmong the tail-pieces drawn and engraved by Bewick himself, in the first\r\nedition of the Birds, the following appear most deserving of notice. In\r\nvolume I.: A traveller drinking,--supposed to represent a sketch of his\r\nown costume when making a tour of the Lakes in 1776,--introduced twice,\r\nat the end of the contents, page xxx. and again at page 177. A man\r\n_watering_, in a different sense to the preceding, a very natural,\r\nthough not a very delicate subject, at page 42. At page 62, an old\r\nmiller, lying asleep behind some bushes; he has evidently been tipsy and\r\nfrom the date on a stone to the left, we are led to suppose that he had\r\nbeen indulging too freely on the King’s birth-day, 4th June. The\r\nfollowing is a copy of the cut. Two cows standing in a pool, under the\r\nshade of a _dyke-back_, on a warm day, page 74. In this cut Bewick has\r\nintroduced a sketch of a magpie chased by a hawk, but saved from the\r\ntalons of its pursuer by the timely interference of a couple of crows.\r\nWinter scene, of which the following is a copy, at page 78. Some boys\r\nhave made a large snow man, which excites the special wonderment of a\r\nhorse; and Bewick, to give the subject a moral application, has added\r\n“_Esto perpetua!_” at the bottom of the cut: the great work of the\r\nlittle men, however they may admire it, and wish for its endurance, will\r\nbe dissolved on the first thaw. At page 97 the appearance of mist and\r\nrain is well expressed; and in the cut of a poacher tracking a hare, the\r\nsnow is no less naturally represented. At page 157, a man riding with a\r\n_howdy_--a midwife--behind him, part of the cut appears covered with a\r\nleaf. Bewick once being asked the meaning of this, said that “it was\r\ndone to indicate that the scene which was to follow required to be\r\nconcealed.” At page 194 we perceive a full-fed old churl hanging his\r\ncat; at page 226, a hen attacking a dog; and at page 281, two cocks\r\nfighting,--all three excellent of their kind.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nBewick’s humour occasionally verges on positive grossness, and a\r\n_glaring_ instance of his want of delicacy presents itself in the\r\ntail-piece at page 285. After the work was printed off Bewick became\r\naware that the nakedness of a prominent part of his subject required to\r\nbe covered, and one of his apprentices was employed to blacken it over\r\nwith ink. In the next edition a plug was inserted in the block, and the\r\nrepresentation of two bars of wood engraved upon it to hide the\r\noffensive part. The cut, however, even thus amended, is still extremely\r\nindelicate.[VII-58]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-58: The subject of this cut is thus explained in\r\n    Brockett’s Glossary of North Country Words: “NEDDY, NETTY, a\r\n    certain place that will not bear a written explanation; but which\r\n    is _depicted to the very life_ in a tail-piece in the first\r\n    edition of Bewick’s Land Birds, p. 285. In the second edition a\r\n    bar is placed against the offending part of this broad display of\r\n    native humour.”]\r\n\r\nThe following is a copy of the head-piece at the commencement of the\r\nadvertisement to the second volume. It represents an old man saying\r\ngrace with closed eyes, while his cat avails herself of the opportunity\r\nof making free with his porridge. The Reverend Henry Cotes, vicar of\r\nBedlington, happening to call on Bewick when he was finishing this cut,\r\nexpressed his disapprobation of the subject, as having a tendency to\r\nridicule the practice of an act of devotion; but Bewick denied that he\r\nhad any such intention, and would not consent to omit the cut. He drew a\r\ndistinction between the act and the performer; and though he might\r\napprove of saying grace before meat, he could not help laughing at one\r\nof the over-righteous, who, while craving a blessing with hypocritical\r\ngrimace, and with eyes closed to outward things, loses a present good.\r\nThe head-piece to the contents presents an excellent sketch of an old\r\nman going to market on a windy and rainy day. The old horse on which he\r\nis mounted has become restive, and the rider has both broken his stick\r\nand lost his hat. The horse seems determined not to move till it suits\r\nhis own pleasure; and it is evident that the old man dare not get down\r\nto recover his hat, for, should he do so, encumbered as he is with a\r\nheavy basket over his left arm and an egg-pannier slung over his\r\nshoulder, he will not be able to remount.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe following are the principal tail-pieces drawn and engraved by Bewick\r\nhimself in the first edition of the second volume of the Birds, 1804.\r\nA shooter with a gun at his back crossing a stream on long stilts,\r\npage 5. An old wooden-legged beggar gnawing a bone near the entrance to\r\na gentleman’s house, and a dog beside him eagerly watching for the\r\nreversion, page 27. A dog with a kettle tied to his tail, pursued by\r\nboys,--a great hulking fellow, evidently a blacksmith, standing with\r\nfolded arms enjoying the sport, page 56. A man crossing a frozen stream,\r\nwith a branch of a tree between his legs, to support him should the ice\r\nhappen to break, page 85. A monkey basting a goose that is seen\r\nroasting, page 263. An old woman with a pitcher, driving away some geese\r\nfrom a well, page 291. An old beggar-woman assailed by a gander, page\r\n313.\r\n\r\nOne of the best of the tail-pieces subsequently inserted is that which\r\noccurs at the end of the description of the Moor-buzzard, volume I. in\r\nthe editions of 1816 and 1821, and at page 31 in the edition of 1832. It\r\nrepresents two dyers carrying a tub between them by means of a\r\ncowl-staff; and the figures, Mr. Atkinson says, are portraits of two old\r\nmen belonging to Ovingham,--“the one on the right being ‘auld Tommy\r\nDobson of the Bleach Green,’ and the other ‘Mat. Carr.’”[VII-59] The\r\naction of the men is excellent, and their expression is in perfect\r\naccordance with the business in which they are engaged--to wit, carrying\r\ntheir tub full of _chemmerly_--chamber-lye--to the dye-house. The\r\nolfactory organs of both are evidently affected by the pungent odour of\r\ntheir load. It may be necessary to observe that the dyers of Ovingham\r\nhad at that time a general reservoir in the village, to which most of\r\nthe cottagers were contributors; but as each family had the privilege of\r\nsupplying themselves from it with as much as they required for scouring\r\nand washing, it sometimes happened that the dyers found their trough\r\nempty, and were consequently obliged to solicit a supply from such\r\npersons as kept a private stock of their own. As they were both\r\nirritable old men, the phrase, “He’s like a _raised_ [enraged] dyer\r\nbegging _chemmerly_,” became proverbial in Ovingham to denote a person\r\nin a passion. This cut, as I am informed by one of Bewick’s old pupils,\r\nwas copied on the block and engraved by Luke Clennell from a\r\nwater-colour drawing by Robert Johnson.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-59: “Mr. Atkinson must have misunderstood Bewick, as\r\n    the old man’s name was George, not Matthew, Carr. He was\r\n    grandfather to Edward Willis, one of Bewick’s pupils, and to\r\n    George Stephenson, the celebrated engineer. Matthew Carr was a\r\n    tailor, who lived and died at Righton, in Durham.”--JNO. JACKSON.]\r\n\r\nWhen the second volume of the History of British Birds was published, in\r\n1804, Bewick had reached his fiftieth year; but though his powers as a\r\nwood engraver continued for long afterwards unimpaired, yet he\r\nsubsequently produced nothing to extend his fame. The retouching of the\r\nblocks for the repeated editions of the Quadrupeds and the Birds, and\r\nthe engraving of new cuts for the latter work, occupied a considerable\r\npart of his time. He also engraved, by himself and pupils, several cuts\r\nfor different works, but they are generally such as add nothing to his\r\nreputation. Bewick never engraved with pleasure from another person’s\r\ndrawing; in large cuts, consisting chiefly of human figures, he did not\r\nexcel. His excellence consisted in the representation of animals and in\r\nlandscape. The Fables, which had been projected previous to 1795, also\r\noccasionally occupied his attention. This work, which first appeared in\r\n1818, was by no means so favourably received as the Quadrupeds and the\r\nBirds; and several of Bewick’s greatest admirers, who had been led to\r\nexpect something better, openly expressed their disappointment. Dr.\r\nDibdin, speaking of the Fables, says, “It would be a species of\r\n_scandalum magnatum_ to depreciate any production connected with the\r\nname of Bewick; but I will fearlessly and honestly aver that his Æsop\r\ndisappointed me; the more so, as his Birds and Beasts are volumes\r\nperfectly classical of their kind.” The disappointment, however, that\r\nwas felt with respect to this work resulted perhaps rather from people\r\nexpecting too much than from any deficiency in the cuts as\r\n_illustrations of Fables_. There is a great difference between\r\nrepresenting birds and beasts in their natural character, and\r\nrepresenting them as actors in imaginary scenes. We do not regard the\r\ncock and the fox holding an imaginary conversation, however ably\r\nrepresented, with the interest with which we look upon each when\r\nfaithfully depicted in its proper character. The tail-piece of the bitch\r\nseeing her drowned puppies, at page 364 of the Quadrupeds, edition 1824,\r\nis far more interesting than any cut illustrative of a fable in\r\nÆsop;--we at once feel its truth, and admire it, because it is natural.\r\nBirds and beasts represented as performing human characters can never\r\ninterest so much as when naturally depicted in their own. Such cuts may\r\ndisplay great fancy and much skill on the part of the artist, but they\r\nnever can excite true feeling. The martyr Cock Robin, killed by that\r\nmalicious archer the Sparrow, is not so interesting as plain Robin\r\nRedbreast picking up crumbs at a cottage-door in the snow:--\r\n\r\n  “One touch of nature makes the whole world kin.”\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the merits or defects of the cuts in those Fables,\r\nBewick most certainly had very little to do with them; for by far the\r\ngreater number were designed by Robert Johnson, and engraved by W. W.\r\nTemple and William Harvey, while yet in their apprenticeship. In the\r\nwhole volume there are not more than three of the largest cuts engraved\r\nby Bewick himself.[VII-60] The tail-pieces in this work will not bear a\r\ncomparison with those in the Birds; the subjects are often both trite\r\nand tamely treated; the devil and the gallows--Bewick’s two\r\nstock-pieces--occur rather too frequently, considering that the book is\r\nchiefly intended for the improvement of young minds; and in many\r\ninstances nature has been sacrificed in order that the moral might be\r\nobvious.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE CROW AND THE LAMB.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-60: The cuts engraved by Bewick himself are: a\r\n    tail-piece (a Cow standing under some bushes) to “The Two Frogs,”\r\n    page 200. The fable of “The Deer and the Lion,” page 315. “Waiting\r\n    for Death,” page 338. He also engraved the figure of the _Lion_ in\r\n    the fable of “The Lion and the four Bulls,” page 89 (see cut at\r\n    our page 480). The Man, Crow, and Sheep in the fable of the “Eagle\r\n    and the Crow,” of which we give the original cut. The Man and two\r\n    Birds in the fable of “The Husbandman and the Stork.”]\r\n\r\nThe letter-press was entirely selected and arranged by Bewick himself,\r\nand one or two of the fables were of his own writing. Though an\r\nexcellent illustrator of Natural History, Bewick is but an indifferent\r\nfabulist.[VII-61] Though the work is professedly intended for the\r\ninstruction of the young, there are certainly a few tail-pieces\r\nintroduced for the _entertainment_ of the more advanced in years; and of\r\nthis kind is the old beggar and his trull lying asleep, and a bull\r\nlooking over a rail at them. The explanation of this subject would\r\ncertainly have little tendency to improve young minds. Bewick, though\r\nvery fond of introducing the devil in his cuts to frighten the wicked,\r\ndoes not appear to have been willing that a ranting preacher should in\r\nhis discourses avail himself of the same character, though to effect the\r\nsame purpose, as we learn from the following anecdote related by Mr.\r\nAtkinson. “Cant and hypocrisy he (Bewick) very much disliked. A ranter\r\ntook up his abode near Cherry-burn, and used daily to horrify the\r\ncountry people with very familiar details of ultra-stygian proceedings.\r\nBewick went to hear him, and after listening patiently for some time to\r\na blasphemous recital of such horrors, at which the poor people were\r\ngaping with affright, he got behind the holder-forth, and pinching his\r\nelbow, addressed him when he turned round with great solemnity: ‘Now\r\nthen thou seems to know a great deal about the devil, and has been\r\nfrightening us a long while about him: can thou tell me whether he wears\r\nhis own hair or a wig?’”--This is a bad joke;--the query might have been\r\nretorted with effect. The engraver, it seems, might introduce his\r\nSatanic majesty _ad libitum_ in his cuts; but when a ranting preacher\r\ntakes the same liberty in his discourses, he is called upon to give\r\nproof of personal acquaintance.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-61: The fable of the Ship Dog is one of those\r\n    written by Bewick.]\r\n\r\nBewick’s morality was rather rigid than cheerful; and he was but too\r\nprone to think uncharitably of others, whose conduct and motives, when\r\nweighed in the scales of impartial justice, were perhaps as correct and\r\nas pure as his own. His good men are often represented as somewhat cold,\r\nselfish individuals, with little sympathy for the more unfortunate of\r\ntheir species, whose errors are as often the result of ignorance as of a\r\npositively vicious character. As a moralist, he was accustomed to look\r\nat the dark rather than the bright side of human nature, and hence his\r\ntendency to brand those with whom he might differ in opinion as fools\r\nand knaves. One of the fables, written by himself, was objected to by\r\nthe printer, the late Mr. E. Walker, and at his request it was omitted.\r\nWe give a copy of the cut intended for it. The world is represented as\r\nhaving lost its balance, and legions of his favourite devils are seen\r\nhurled about in a confused vortex. The fable, it is said, was intended\r\nas a satire on the ministerial politics of the time. A thumb-mark is\r\nseen at the upper end of what is intended to represent a piece of paper\r\nforming part of the page of a Bible pasted across the cut. A similar\r\nmark is to be found at page 175 of the Land Birds, first edition, 1797,\r\nand in the bill and receipt prefixed to the Fables, 1818-1823.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn a novel, entitled “Such is the World,” there is the following\r\nerroneous account of Bewick’s reason for affixing his thumb-mark to this\r\nbill.[VII-62] “Having completed his task to the entire satisfaction of\r\nhis own mind, Mr. Bewick bethought him of engraving a frontispiece. But\r\nhaving some suspicion that the said frontispiece might be pirated by\r\nsome of those corsairs who infest the ocean of literature, he resolved\r\nto put a mark on it, whereby all men might distinguish it as readily as\r\na fisherman distinguishes a haddock[VII-63] from a cod-fish.\r\nAccordingly, he touched with his thumb the little black ball with which\r\nhe was wont to ink his cuts, in order to take off proof impressions of\r\nhis work: he then very deliberately pressed his thumb on the\r\nfrontispiece which he was at that moment engraving, and cut the most\r\nbeautiful image of the original, which he designated by the appropriate\r\nwords ‘John Bewick, his mark.’” Had the writer looked at the\r\n“frontispiece,” as he calls it, he would have found “_Thomas_,” and not\r\n“_John_.” The conclusion of this account is a fair sample of its general\r\naccuracy. In a preliminary observation the author, with equal\r\ncorrectness, informs his readers that the work in which this\r\n“frontispiece” appeared was “a superb edition of _Gay’s_ Fables.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-62: Mr. Atkinson says that this account determined\r\n    Bewick to write a life of himself. It appears that he actually\r\n    completed such a work, but that his family at present decline to\r\n    publish it. [Mr. Jackson adds, “I engraved two portraits for it:\r\n    one was a portrait of the Rev. Wm. Turner, of Newcastle, the other\r\n    that of an engineer or millwright, at Morpeth, named Rastack, or\r\n    Raistick.”]]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-63: “There is a tradition that the two black marks\r\n    on the opposite sides of the haddock were occasioned by St.\r\n    Peter’s thumb and fore-finger when he took the piece of money out\r\n    of the fish’s mouth to give it as a tribute to Cæsar.”]\r\n\r\nBewick’s _mark_ is, in fact, added to this bill merely as a jest; the\r\nmode which he took to authenticate the copies that were actually issued\r\nby himself, and not pilfered by any of the workmen employed about the\r\nprinting-office,[VII-64] was to print at his own work-shop, in red ink\r\nfrom a copper-plate, a representation of a piece of sea-weed lying above\r\nthe wood-cut which had previously been printed off at a printing-office.\r\nThis mode of printing a copper-plate over a wood-cut was a part of one\r\nof the plans which he had devised to prevent the forgery of\r\nbank-notes.[VII-65]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-64: Bewick’s suspicions in this respect were not\r\n    altogether groundless. Happening to go into a bookbinder’s shop in\r\n    Newcastle in 1818, he found a copy of his Fables, which had been\r\n    sent there to bind before the work had been issued to the public.\r\n    He claimed the book as his property, and carried it away; but the\r\n    name of the owner who had purchased it, knowing it to have been\r\n    dishonestly obtained, was not publicly divulged.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-65: About 1799 Bewick frequently corresponded with\r\n    Mr. Abraham Newland, cashier of the Bank of England, respecting a\r\n    plan which he had devised to prevent the forgery of bank notes. He\r\n    was offered a situation in the Bank to superintend the engraving\r\n    and printing of the notes, but he refused to leave Newcastle. The\r\n    notes of Ridley and Co.’s bank were for many years engraved and\r\n    printed under the superintendence of Bewick, who, after Mr.\r\n    Beilby’s retirement, still continued the business of copper-plate\r\n    engraving and printing, and for this purpose always kept presses\r\n    of his own.]\r\n\r\nThe first of the two following cuts, copied from his Fables, records the\r\ndecease of Bewick’s mother, who died on the 20th of February 1785, aged\r\n58; and the second that of his father, who died on the 15th of November\r\nin the same year, aged 70. The last event also marks the day on which he\r\nbegan to engrave the first cut intended for the Quadrupeds. This cut was\r\nthe Arabian Camel, or Dromedary, and he had made very little progress\r\nwith it when a messenger arrived from Cherry-burn to inform him of his\r\nfather’s death.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nSeveral years previous to his decease Bewick had devised an improvement,\r\nwhich consisted in printing a subject from two or more blocks,--not in\r\nthe manner of chiaro-scuros, but in order to obtain a greater variety of\r\n_tint_, and a better effect than could be obtained, without great\r\nlabour, in a cut printed in black ink from a single block. This\r\nimprovement, which had been suggested by Papillon in 1768, Bewick\r\nproceeded to carry into effect. The subject which he made choice of to\r\nexemplify what he considered his original discovery, was an old horse\r\nwaiting for death.[VII-66] He accordingly made the drawing on a large\r\nblock consisting of four different pieces, and forthwith proceeded to\r\nengrave it. He however did not live to complete his intention; for even\r\nthis block, which he meant merely for the first impression--the subject\r\nhaving to be completed by a second--remained unfinished at his\r\ndecease.[VII-67] He had, however, finished it all with the exception of\r\npart of the horse’s head, and when in this state he had four impressions\r\ntaken about a week before his death. It was on this occasion that he\r\nexclaimed, when the pressman handed him the proof, “I wish I was but\r\ntwenty years younger!”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-66: A small cut of the same subject, though with a\r\n    different back-ground, occurs as a tail-piece in the Fables,\r\n    1818-1823.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-67: The last _bird_ that Bewick engraved was the\r\n    Cream-coloured Plover, at page 383, vol. i. of the Birds, in the\r\n    edition of 1832. Several years previous to his death he had\r\n    projected a History of British Fishes, but very little progress\r\n    was made in the work. A few cuts of fishes were engraved, chiefly\r\n    by his pupils; that of the John Dory, an impression of which is\r\n    said to have been sold for a considerable sum, is one of those not\r\n    engraved by Bewick himself. As a work of art the value of an India\r\n    paper impression of the John Dory may be about twopence. This cut\r\n    is an early performance of Mr. Jackson’s, who also engraved, in\r\n    1823, about twenty of the additional tail-pieces in the last\r\n    edition of the Birds, 1832.]\r\n\r\nThis cut, with the head said to have been finished by another person,\r\nwas published by Bewick’s son, Mr. Robert Elliott Bewick, in 1832. It is\r\nthe largest cut that Bewick ever engraved,[VII-68] but having been left\r\nby him in an unfinished state, it would be impossible to say what he\r\nmight have effected had he lived to work out his ideas, and unfair to\r\njudge of it as if it were a finished performance. It is, however, but\r\njust to remark, that the miserable appearance of the poor, worn-out,\r\nneglected animal, is represented with great feeling and\r\ntruth,--excepting the head, which is disproportionately large and\r\nheavy,--and that the landscape displays Bewick’s usual fidelity in\r\ncopying nature.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-68: This cut is eleven inches and five-eighths wide\r\n    by eight inches and three-fourths high. It is entitled, “Waiting\r\n    for Death: Bewick’s last work, left unfinished, and intended to\r\n    have been completed by a series of impressions from separate\r\n    blocks printed over each other.”]\r\n\r\nBewick’s life affords a useful lesson to all who wish to attain\r\ndistinction in art, and at the same time to preserve their independence.\r\nHe diligently cultivated his talents, and never trusted to booksellers\r\nor designers for employment. He did not work according to the directions\r\nof others, but struck out a path for himself; and by diligently pursuing\r\nit according to the bent of his own feelings, he acquired both a\r\ncompetence with respect to worldly means and an ample reward of fame.\r\nThe success of his works did not render him inattentive to business; and\r\nhe was never tempted by the prospect of increasing wealth to indulge in\r\nexpensive pleasures, nor to live in a manner which his circumstances did\r\nnot warrant. What he had honestly earned he frugally husbanded; and,\r\nlike a prudent man, made a provision for his old age. “The hand of the\r\ndiligent,” says Solomon, “maketh rich.” This Bewick felt, and his life\r\nmay be cited in the exemplification of the truth of the proverb. He\r\nacquired not indeed great wealth, but he attained a competence, and was\r\ngrateful and contented. No favoured worshipper of Mammon, though\r\npossessed of millions obtained by “watching the turn of the market,”\r\ncould say more.\r\n\r\nHe was extremely regular and methodical in his habits of business: until\r\nwithin a few years of his death he used to come to his shop in Newcastle\r\nfrom his house in Gateshead at a certain hour in the morning, returning\r\nto his dinner at a certain time, and, as he used to say, _lapping up_ at\r\nnight, as if he were a workman employed by the day, and subject to a\r\nloss by being absent a single hour. When any of his works were in the\r\npress, the first thing he did each morning, after calling at his own\r\nshop, was to proceed to the printer’s to see what progress they were\r\nmaking, and to give directions to the pressmen about printing the\r\ncuts.[VII-69] It is indeed owing to his attention in this respect that\r\nthe cuts in all the editions of his works published during his life-time\r\nare so well printed. The edition of the Birds, published in 1832,\r\ndisplays numerous instances of the want of Bewick’s own superintendence:\r\neither through the carelessness or ignorance of the pressmen, many of\r\nthe cuts are quite spoiled.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-69: When Bewick removed the printing of his works\r\n    from Mr. Hodgson’s office to that of Mr. E. Walker, a pressman,\r\n    named Barlow, was brought from London for the purpose of printing\r\n    the cuts in the second volume of the Birds in a proper manner.\r\n    Bewick’s favourite pressman at Mr. Hodgson’s was John Simpson.]\r\n\r\nThe following cut represents a view of Bewick’s workshop in St.\r\nNicholas’ Churchyard, Newcastle. The upper room, the two windows of\r\nwhich are seen in the roof, was that in which he worked in the latter\r\nyears of his life. In this shop he engraved the cuts which will\r\nperpetuate his name; and there for upwards of fifty years was he\r\naccustomed to sit, steadily and cheerfully pursuing the labour that he\r\nloved. He used always to work with his hat on; and when any gentleman or\r\nnobleman called upon him, he only removed it for a moment on his first\r\nentering. He used frequently to whistle when at work, and he was seldom\r\nwithout a large quid of tobacco in his mouth. The prominence occasioned\r\nby the quid, which he kept between his under lip and his teeth, and not\r\nin his cheek, is indicated in most of his portraits.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nA stick, which had been his brother John’s, was a great favourite with\r\nhim, and he generally carried it in his walks, always carefully putting\r\nit in a certain place when he entered his workroom. He used to be very\r\npartial to a draught of water in the afternoon, immediately before\r\nleaving work. The water was brought fresh by one of the apprentices from\r\nthe _pant_ at the head of the Side, in an earthenware jug, and the glass\r\nwhich Bewick used to drink the water out of, was, as soon as done with,\r\ncarefully locked up in his book-case. One of his apprentices once\r\nhappening to break the jug, Bewick scolded him well for his\r\ncarelessness, and made him pay twopence towards buying another.\r\n\r\nBewick was a man of athletic make, being nearly six feet high, and\r\nproportionally stout. He possessed great personal courage, and in his\r\nyounger days was not slow to repay an insult with personal chastisement.\r\nOn one occasion being assaulted by two pitmen on returning from a visit\r\nto Cherry-burn, he resolutely turned upon the aggressors, and, as he\r\nsaid, “_paid_ them both well.” Though hard-featured, and much marked\r\nwith the small-pox, the expression of Bewick’s countenance was manly and\r\nopen, and his dark eyes sparkled with intelligence. There is a good bust\r\nof him by Bailey in the Library of the Literary and Philosophical\r\nSociety of Newcastle, and the best engraved portrait is perhaps that of\r\nBurnet, after a painting by Ramsey.[VII-70] The portrait on page 510,\r\nengraved on wood, is another attempt to perpetuate the likeness of one\r\nto whom the art owes so much.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-70: The following is a list of the principal\r\n    engraved portraits of Bewick: on copper, by J. A. Kidd, from\r\n    a painting by Miss Kirkley, 1798. On copper, by Thomas Ranson,\r\n    after a painting by William Nicholson, 1816. On copper, by\r\n    I. Summerfield, from a miniature by Murphy--that alluded to in\r\n    Bewick’s letter to Mr. C. Gregson, previously quoted--1816. On\r\n    copper, by John Burnet, from a painting by James Ramsey, 1817.\r\n    Copies of all those portraits, engraved on wood, are given in\r\n    Charnley’s edition of Select Fables, 1820; and there is also\r\n    prefixed to the work a portrait excellently engraved on wood by\r\n    Charlton Nesbit, one of Bewick’s earliest pupils, from a drawing\r\n    made on the block by William Nicholson.--In the Memoir of Thomas\r\n    Bewick, prefixed to the Natural History of Parrots, Naturalist’s\r\n    Library, vol. vi., it is incorrectly stated that Ranson, the\r\n    engraver of one of the above portraits, was a pupil of Bewick’s.\r\n    He was a pupil of J. A. Kidd, copper-plate engraver, Newcastle.]\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1828 Bewick visited London; but he was then evidently\r\nin a declining state of health, and he had lost much of his former\r\nenergy of mind. Scarcely anything that he saw interested him, and he\r\nlonged no less than in his younger years to return to the banks of the\r\nTyne. He had ceased to feel an interest in objects which formerly\r\nafforded him great pleasure; for when his old friend, the late Mr.\r\nWilliam Bulmer, drove him round the Regent’s Park, he declined to alight\r\nfor the purpose of visiting the collection of animals in the Gardens of\r\nthe Zoological Society.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THOMAS BEWICK.]\r\n\r\nOn his return to Newcastle he appeared for a short time to enjoy his\r\nusual health and spirits. On the Saturday preceding his death he took\r\nthe block of the Old Horse waiting for Death to the printer’s, and had\r\nit proved; on the following Monday he became unwell, and after a few\r\ndays’ illness he ceased to exist. He died at his house on the\r\nWindmill-hills, Gateshead, on the 8th of November, 1828, aged\r\nseventy-five. He was buried at Ovingham, and the following cut\r\nrepresents a view of the place of his interment, near the west end of\r\nthe church. The tablets seen in the wall are those erected to the memory\r\nof himself and his brother John.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe following are the inscriptions on the tablets:\r\n\r\n          In Memory of\r\n          JOHN BEWICK,\r\n           Engraver,\r\n  Who died December, 5, 1795,\r\n         Aged 35 years.\r\n\r\n      His Ingenuity as an\r\n            Artist\r\n      was excelled only by\r\n        his Conduct as a\r\n              Man.\r\n\r\n              The\r\n         Burial Place\r\n              of\r\n        THOMAS BEWICK,\r\n           Engraver,\r\n          Newcastle.\r\n      Isabella, his Wife,\r\n    Died 1st February, 1826,\r\n         Aged 72 years.\r\n         THOMAS BEWICK,\r\n  Died 8th of November, 1828,\r\n         Aged 75 years.\r\n\r\nIn an excellent notice of the works of Bewick--apparently written by one\r\nof his townsmen (said to be Mr. T. Doubleday)--in Blackwood’s Magazine\r\nfor July, 1825, it is stated that the final tail-piece to Bewick’s\r\nFables, 1818-1823, is “A View of Ovingham Churchyard;” and in the\r\nReverend William Turner’s Memoir of Thomas Bewick, in the sixth volume\r\nof the Naturalist’s Library, the same statement is repeated. It is,\r\nhowever, erroneous; as both the writers might have known had they\r\nthought it worth their while to pay a visit to Ovingham, and take a look\r\nat the church. The following cut, in which is introduced an imaginary\r\nrepresentation of Bewick’s funeral, presents a correct view of the\r\nplace. The following popular saying, which is well known in\r\nNorthumberland, suggested the introduction of the rain-bow:\r\n\r\n  “Happy is the bride that the sun shines on,\r\n  And happy is the corpse that the rain rains on,--”\r\n\r\nmeaning that sunshine at a wedding is a sign of happiness in the\r\nmarriage state to the bride, and that rain at a funeral is a sign of\r\nfuture happiness to the person whose remains are about to be interred.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe following eloquent tribute to the merits of Bewick is from an\r\narticle on Wilson’s Illustrations of Zoology in Blackwood’s Magazine for\r\nJune, 1828.\r\n\r\n“Have we forgotten, in our hurried and imperfect enumeration of wise\r\nworthies,--have we forgotten\r\n\r\n  ‘The Genius that dwells on the banks of the Tyne,’[VII-71]\r\n\r\nthe Matchless, Inimitable Bewick? No. His books lie on our parlour,\r\nbed-room, dining-room, drawing-room, study table, and are never out of\r\nplace or time. Happy old man! The delight of childhood, manhood,\r\ndecaying age!--A moral in every tail-piece--a sermon in every vignette.\r\nNot as if from one fountain flows the stream of his inspired spirit,\r\ngurgling from the Crawley Spring so many thousand gallons of the element\r\nevery minute, and feeding but one city, our own Edinburgh. But it rather\r\noozes out from unnumbered springs. Here from one scarcely perceptible\r\nbut in the vivid green of the lonesome sward, from which it trickles\r\naway into a little mountain rill--here leaping into sudden life, as from\r\nthe rock--here bubbling from a silver pool, overshadowed by a\r\nbirch-tree--here like a well asleep in a moss-grown cell, built by some\r\nthoughtful recluse in the old monastic day, with a few words from\r\nScripture, or some rude engraving, religious as Scripture, OMNE BONUM\r\nDESUPER--OPERA DEI MIRIFICA.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-71: This line is adapted from Wordsworth, who, at\r\n    the commencement of his verses entitled “The Two Thieves, or The\r\n    Last Stage of Avarice,” thus expresses his high opinion of the\r\n    talents of Bewick:\r\n\r\n      “O now that the genius of Bewick were mine,\r\n      And the skill which he learned on the banks of the Tyne!\r\n      Then the Muses might deal with me just as they chose,\r\n      For I’d take my last leave both of verse and of prose.”\r\n\r\n              _Lyrical Ballads_, vol. ii. p. 199. Edition 1805.]\r\n\r\nJohn Bewick, a younger brother of Thomas, was born at Cherry-burn in\r\n1760, and in 1777 was apprenticed as a wood engraver to his brother and\r\nMr. Beilby. He undoubtedly assisted his brother in the execution of the\r\ncuts for the two editions of Fables, printed by Mr. Saint in 1779 and\r\n1784; but in those early productions it would be impossible, judging\r\nmerely from the style of the engraving, to distinguish the work of the\r\ntwo brothers. Among the earliest cuts known to have been engraved by\r\nJohn Bewick, on the expiration of his apprenticeship, are those\r\ncontained in a work entitled “Emblems of Mortality,” printed in 1789 for\r\nT. Hodgson, the publisher of the Hieroglyphic Bible, mentioned at page\r\n478. Those cuts, which are very indifferently executed, are copies,\r\noccasionally altered for the worse, of the cuts in Holbein’s Dance of\r\nDeath. Whether he engraved them in London, or not, I have been unable to\r\nascertain; but it is certain that he was living in London in the\r\nfollowing year, and that he resided there till 1795. When residing in\r\nthe metropolis he drew and engraved the cuts for “The Progress of Man\r\nand Society,” compiled by Dr. Trusler, and published in 1791; the cuts\r\nfor “The Looking Glass of the Mind,” 1796; and also those contained in a\r\nsimilar work entitled “Blossoms of Morality,” published about the same\r\ntime. Though several of those cuts display considerable talent, yet the\r\nbest specimens of his abilities as a designer and engraver on wood are\r\nto be found in Poems by Goldsmith and Parnell, 1795, and in Somervile’s\r\nChase, 1796, both printed in quarto, to display the excellence of modern\r\nprinting, type-founding, wood-engraving, and paper-making. Mr. Bulmer,\r\nwho suggested those editions, being himself a Northumbrian, had been\r\nintimately acquainted with both Thomas and John Bewick. In the preface\r\nto the Poems by Goldsmith and Parnell, he is careful to commemorate the\r\npaper-maker, type-founder, and the engravers; but he omits to mention\r\nthe name of Robert Johnson, who designed three of the principal\r\ncuts.[VII-72] The merits of this highly-talented young man appear to\r\nhave been singularly overlooked by those whose more especial duty it was\r\nto notice them. In the whole of Bewick’s works he is not once mentioned.\r\nMr. Bulmer also says, that all the cuts were engraved by Thomas and John\r\nBewick; but though he unquestionably believed so himself, the statement\r\nis not strictly correct; for the four vignette head and tail-pieces to\r\nthe Traveller and the Deserted Village were engraved by C. Nesbit. The\r\nvignettes on the title-pages, the large cut of the old woman gathering\r\nwater-cresses, and the tail-piece at the end of the volume, were drawn\r\nand engraved by John Bewick; the remainder were engraved by Thomas.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-72: The cut of the Hermit at his morning devotion\r\n    was drawn by John Johnson, a cousin of Robert, and also one of\r\n    Bewick’s pupils.]\r\n\r\nThe cuts in this book are generally executed in a free and effective\r\nstyle, but are not remarkable as specimens of wood engraving, unless we\r\ntake into consideration the time when they were published. The best in\r\npoint of execution are, The Hermit at his morning devotion, and The\r\nAngel, Hermit, and Guide, both engraved by Thomas Bewick; the manner in\r\nwhich the engraver has executed the foliage in these two cuts is\r\nextremely beautiful and natural. It is said that George III. thought so\r\nhighly of the cuts in this book that he could not believe that they were\r\nengraved on wood; and that his bookseller, Mr. George Nicol, obtained\r\nfor his Majesty a sight of the blocks in order that he might be\r\nconvinced of the fact by his own inspection. This anecdote is sometimes\r\nproduced as a proof of the great excellence of the cuts, though it might\r\nwith greater truth be cited as a proof of his Majesty being totally\r\nunacquainted with the process of wood engraving, and of his not being\r\nable to distinguish a wood-cut from a copper-plate. If Bewick’s\r\nreputation as a wood engraver rested on those cuts, it certainly would\r\nnot stand very high. Much better things of the same kind have been\r\nexecuted since that time by persons who are generally considered as\r\nhaving small claims to distinction as wood engravers.\r\n\r\nThe cuts in the Chase were all, except one, designed by John Bewick; but\r\nin consequence of the declining state of his health he was not able to\r\nengrave them. Soon after he had finished the drawings on the block he\r\nleft London for the north, in the hope of deriving benefit from his\r\nnative air. His disorder, however, continued to increase; and, within a\r\nfew weeks from the time of his return, he died at Ovingham, on the 5th\r\nof December, 1795, aged thirty-five.\r\n\r\nThe cuts in the Chase, which were all, except one, engraved by Thomas\r\nBewick, are, on the whole, superior in point of execution to those in\r\nthe Poems of Goldsmith and Parnell. Though boldly designed, some of them\r\ndisplay great defects in composition, and among the most objectionable\r\nin this respect are the Huntsman and three Hounds, at page 5; the\r\nconclusion of the Chase, page 31; and George III. stag-hunting, page 93.\r\nAmong the best, both as respects design and execution, are: Morning,\r\nvignette on title-page, remarkably spirited; Hounds, page 25; a Stag\r\ndrinking, page 27; Fox-hunting, page 63; and Otter-hunting, page 99. The\r\nfinal tail-piece, which has been spoiled in the engraving, was executed\r\nby one of Bewick’s pupils.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nJohn Bewick, as a designer and engraver on wood, is much inferior to his\r\nbrother. Though several of his cuts possess considerable merit with\r\nrespect to design, by far the greater number are executed in a dry,\r\nharsh manner. His best cuts may be readily distinguished from his\r\nbrother’s by the greater contrast of black and white in the cuts\r\nengraved by John, and by the dry and withered appearance of the foliage\r\nof the trees. The above is a reduced copy of a cut entitled the “Sad\r\nHistorian,” drawn and engraved by John Bewick, in the Poems by Goldsmith\r\nand Parnell.\r\n\r\nThe most of John Bewick’s cuts are much better conceived than engraved;\r\nand this perhaps may in a great measure have arisen from their having\r\nbeen chiefly executed for children’s books, in which excellence of\r\nengraving was not required. His style of engraving is not good; for\r\nthough some of his cuts are extremely _effective_ from the contrast of\r\nlight and shade, yet the lines in almost every one are coarse and harsh,\r\nand “laid in,” to use a technical expression, in a hard and tasteless\r\nmanner. Dry, stiff, parallel lines, scarcely ever deviating into a\r\npleasing curve, are the general characteristic of most of his small\r\ncuts. As he reached the age of thirty-five without having produced any\r\ncut which displays much ability in the execution, it is not likely that\r\nhe would have excelled as a wood engraver had his life been prolonged.\r\nThe following is a fac-simile of one of the best of his cuts in the\r\nBlossoms of Morality, published about 1796. It exemplifies his manner of\r\nstrongly contrasting positive black with pure white; and the natural\r\nattitudes of the women afford a tolerably fair specimen of his talents\r\nas a designer.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nRobert Johnson, though not a wood engraver, has a claim to a brief\r\nnotice here on account of the excellence of several of the tail-pieces\r\ndesigned by him in Bewick’s Birds, and from his having made the drawings\r\nfor most of the wood-cuts in Bewick’s Fables. He was born in 1770, at\r\nShotley, a village in Northumberland, about six miles to the south-west\r\nof Ovingham; and in 1778 was placed by his father, who at that time\r\nresided in Gateshead, as an apprentice to Beilby and Bewick to be\r\ninstructed in copper-plate engraving. The plates which are generally\r\nsupposed to have been executed by him during his apprenticeship possess\r\nvery little merit, nor does he appear to have been desirous to excel as\r\nan engraver. His great delight consisted in sketching from nature and in\r\npainting in water-colours; and in this branch of art, while yet an\r\napprentice, he displayed talents of very high order.[VII-73] He was\r\nfrequently employed by his master in drawing and making designs, and at\r\nhis leisure hours he took every opportunity of improving himself in his\r\nfavourite art. The Earl of Bute happening to call at Beilby and Bewick’s\r\nshop on one occasion when passing through Newcastle, a portfolio of\r\nJohnson’s drawings, made at his leisure hours, was shown to his\r\nlordship, who was so much pleased with them that he selected as many as\r\namounted to forty pounds. This sum Beilby and Bewick appropriated to\r\nthemselves, on the ground that, as he was their apprentice, those\r\ndrawings, as well as any others that he might make, were legally their\r\nproperty. Johnson’s friends, however, thinking differently, instituted\r\nlegal proceedings for the recovery of the money, and obtained a decision\r\nin their favour. One of the pleas set up by Beilby and Bewick was, that\r\nthe drawings properly belonged to them, as they taught him the art, and\r\nthat the making of such drawings was part of his business. This plea,\r\nhowever, failed; it was elicited on the examination of one of their own\r\napprentices, Charlton Nesbit, that neither he nor any other of his\r\nfellow apprentices was taught the art of drawing in water-colours by\r\ntheir masters, and that it formed no part of their necessary instruction\r\nas engravers.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-73: Johnson’s water-colour drawings for most of the\r\n    cuts in Bewick’s Fables, are extremely beautiful. They are the\r\n    size of the cuts; and as a set are perhaps the finest small\r\n    drawings of the kind that were ever made. Their finish and\r\n    accuracy of drawing are admirable--they look like miniature _Paul\r\n    Potters_. It is known to only a few persons that they were drawn\r\n    by Johnson during his apprenticeship. Most of them were copied on\r\n    the block by William Harvey, and the rest chiefly by Bewick\r\n    himself.]\r\n\r\nOn the expiration of his apprenticeship Johnson gave up, in a great\r\nmeasure, the practice of copper-plate engraving, and applied himself\r\nalmost exclusively to drawing. In 1796 he was engaged by Messrs.\r\nMorison, booksellers and publishers of Perth, to draw from the original\r\npaintings the portraits intended to be engraved in “the Scottish\r\nGallery,” a work edited by Pinkerton, and published about 1799. When at\r\nTaymouth Castle, the seat of the Earl of Breadalbane, copying some\r\nportraits painted by Jameson, the Scottish Vandyke, he caught a severe\r\ncold, which, being neglected, increased to a fever. In the violence of\r\nthe disorder he became delirious, and, from the ignorance of those who\r\nattended him, the unfortunate young artist, far from home and without a\r\nfriend to console him, was bound and treated like a madman. A physician\r\nhaving been called in, by his order blisters were applied, and a\r\ndifferent course of treatment adopted. Johnson recovered his senses, but\r\nit was only for a brief period; being of a delicate constitution, he\r\nsank under the disorder. He died at Kenmore on the 29th October, 1796,\r\nin the twenty-sixth year of his age.[VII-74]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-74: John Johnson, a cousin of Robert, was also an\r\n    apprentice of Beilby and Bewick. He was a wood engraver, and\r\n    executed a few of the tail-pieces in the History of British Birds.\r\n    Like Robert, he possessed a taste for drawing; and the cut of the\r\n    Hermit at his morning devotion, engraved by T. Bewick, in Poems by\r\n    Goldsmith and Parnell, was designed by him. He died at Newcastle\r\n    about 1797, shortly after the expiration of his apprenticeship.]\r\n\r\nThe following is a copy of a cut--from a design by Johnson\r\nhimself--which was drawn on the wood, and engraved by Charlton Nesbit,\r\nas a tribute of his regard for the memory of his friend and\r\nfellow-pupil.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe next cut represents a view of a monument on the south side of\r\nOvingham church, erected to the memory of Robert Johnson by a few\r\nfriends who admired his talents, and respected him on account of his\r\namiable private character.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nCharlton Nesbit, who is justly entitled to be ranked with the best wood\r\nengravers of his time, was born in 1775 at Swalwell, in the county of\r\nDurham, about five miles westward of Gateshead, and when about fourteen\r\nyears of age was apprenticed to Beilby and Bewick to learn the art of\r\nwood engraving. During his apprenticeship he engraved a few of the\r\ntail-pieces in the first volume of the History of British Birds, and all\r\nthe head and tail-pieces, except two, in the Poems by Goldsmith and\r\nParnell, printed by Bulmer in 1795. Shortly after the expiration of his\r\napprenticeship he began to engrave a large cut, containing a view of St.\r\nNicholas Church, Newcastle-on-Tyne, from a drawing by his fellow-pupil,\r\nRobert Johnson. We here present a reduced copy of this cut, which is one\r\nof the largest ever engraved in England.[VII-75] The original was\r\nengraved on a block consisting of twelve different pieces of box, firmly\r\ncramped together, and mounted on a plate of cast iron to prevent their\r\nwarping. For this cut, which was first published about 1799, Mr. Nesbit\r\nreceived a medal from the Society for the Encouragement of Arts and\r\nManufactures.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-75: The original cut, including the border, is\r\n    fifteen inches wide by about twelve inches high.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nAbout 1799 Mr. Nesbit came to London, where he continued to reside till\r\n1815. During his residence there he engraved a number of cuts for\r\nvarious works, chiefly from the designs of the late Mr. John\r\nThurston,[VII-76] who at that time was the principal, and indeed almost\r\nthe only artist of any talent in London, who made drawings on the block\r\nfor wood engravers. Some of the best of his cuts executed during this\r\nperiod are to be found in a History of England printed for R. Scholey,\r\nand in a work entitled Religious Emblems, published by R. Ackermann and\r\nCo. in 1808. The cuts in the latter work were engraved by Nesbit,\r\nClennell, Branston, and Hole, from drawings by Thurston; and they are\r\nunquestionably the best of their kind which up to that time had appeared\r\nin England. Clennell’s are the most artist-like in their execution and\r\neffect, while Nesbit’s are engraved with greater care. Branston, except\r\nin one cut,--Rescued from the Floods,--does not appear to such advantage\r\nin this work as his northern rivals. There is only one cut--Seed\r\nsown--engraved by Hole. The following may be mentioned as the best of\r\nNesbit’s cuts in this work:--The World Weighed, The Daughters of\r\nJerusalem, Sinners hiding in the Grave, and Wounded in the Mental Eye.\r\nThe best of Clennell’s are:--Call to Vigilance, the World made Captive,\r\nand Fainting for the Living Waters. These are perhaps the three best\r\ncuts of their kind that Clennell ever engraved.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-76: Mr. Thurston was a native of Scarborough, and\r\n    originally a copper-plate engraver. He engraved, under the late\r\n    Mr. James Heath, parts of the two celebrated plates of the death\r\n    of Major Peirson and the Dead Soldier. He was one of the best\r\n    designers on wood of his time. He drew very beautifully, but his\r\n    designs are too frequently deficient in natural character and\r\n    feeling. He died in 1821.]\r\n\r\nIn 1815 Mr. Nesbit returned to his native place, where he continued to\r\nreside until 1830. While living in the country, though he did not\r\nabandon the art, yet the cuts executed by him during this period are\r\ncomparatively few. In 1818, when residing in the North, he engraved a\r\nlarge cut of Rinaldo and Armida for Savage’s Hints on Decorative\r\nPrinting: this cut and another, the Cave of Despair, in the same work\r\nand of the same size, engraved by the late Robert Branston, were\r\nexpressly given to display the perfection to which modern wood engraving\r\nhad been brought. The foliage, the trees, and the drapery in Nesbit’s\r\ncut are admirably engraved; but the lines in the bodies of the figures\r\nare too much broken and “_chopped up_.” This, however, was not the fault\r\nof the engraver, but of the designer, Mr. J. Thurston. The lines, which\r\nnow have a dotted appearance, were originally continuous and distinct;\r\nbut Mr. Thurston objecting to them as being too dark, Nesbit went over\r\nhis work again, and with immense labour reduced the strength of his\r\nlines, and gave them their present dotted appearance. As a specimen of\r\nthe engraver’s abilities, the first proof submitted to the designer was\r\nsuperior to the last.\r\n\r\nIn order to give a fictitious value to Mr. Savage’s book, most of the\r\ncuts, as soon as a certain number of impressions were taken, were sawn\r\nacross, but not through, in several places, and impressions of them when\r\nthus defaced were given in the work.[VII-77] Nesbit’s cut was, however,\r\ncarefully repaired, and the back part of Armida’s head having been\r\naltered, the impressions from the block thus amended were actually given\r\nin the work itself as the _best_, instead of those which were taken\r\nbefore it was defaced. This re-integration of the block was the work of\r\nthe late Mr. G. W. Bonner, Mr. Branston’s nephew. The transverse pieces\r\nare so skilfully inserted, and engraved so much in the style of the\r\nadjacent parts, that it is difficult to discover where the defacing saw\r\nhad passed.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-77: The practice of thus giving a fictitious value\r\n    to works of limited circulation, and which are not likely to reach\r\n    a second edition during the lifetime of their authors, is less\r\n    frequent now than it was a few years ago. It is little more than a\r\n    trick to enhance the price of the book to subscribers, by giving\r\n    them an assurance that no second edition can appear with the same\r\n    embellishments. In three cases out of four where the plates and\r\n    cuts of a work have been intentionally destroyed, there was little\r\n    prospect of such work reaching a second edition during the\r\n    writer’s life.]\r\n\r\nIn 1830 Mr. Nesbit returned to London, where he continued to reside\r\nuntil his death, which took place at Queen’s Elms, the 11th of November\r\n1838, aged 63. Some of the best of his cuts are contained in the second\r\nseries of Northcote’s Fables; and the following, of his execution, may\r\nbe ranked among the finest productions of the art of wood engraving in\r\nmodern times:--The Robin and the Sparrow, page 1; The Hare and the\r\nBramble, page 127; The Peach and the Potatoe, page 129; and The Cock,\r\nthe Dog, and the Fox, page 238. Nesbit is unquestionably the best wood\r\nengraver that has proceeded from the great northern hive of the art--the\r\nworkshop of Thomas Bewick.\r\n\r\nLuke Clennell, one of the most distinguished of Bewick’s pupils as a\r\ndesigner and painter, as well as an engraver on wood, was born at\r\nUlgham, a village near Morpeth, in Northumberland, on the 8th of April,\r\n1781. At an early age he was placed with a relation, a grocer in\r\nMorpeth, and continued with him, assisting in the shop as an apprentice,\r\nuntil he was sixteen. Some drawings which he made when at Morpeth having\r\nattracted attention, and he himself showing a decided predilection for\r\nthe art, his friends were induced to place him as a wood engraver with\r\nBewick, to whom he was bound apprentice for seven years on the 8th of\r\nApril, 1797. He in a short time made great proficiency in wood\r\nengraving; and as he drew with great correctness and power, Bewick\r\nemployed him to copy, on the block, several of Robert Johnson’s\r\ndrawings, and to engrave them as tail-pieces for the second volume of\r\nthe History of British Birds. Clennell for a few months after the\r\nexpiration of his apprenticeship continued to work for Bewick, who\r\nchiefly employed him in engraving some of the cuts for a History of\r\nEngland, published by Wallis and Scholey, 46, Paternoster Row. Clennell,\r\nwho was paid only two guineas apiece for each of those cuts, having\r\nlearnt that Bewick received five, sent to the publisher a proof of one\r\nof them--Alfred in the Danish Camp--stating that it was of his own\r\nengraving. In the course of a few days Clennell received an answer from\r\nthe publisher, inviting him to come to London, and offering him\r\nemployment until all the cuts intended for the work should be finished.\r\nHe accepted the offer, and shortly afterwards set out for London, where\r\nhe arrived about the end of autumn, 1804.[VII-78]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-78: Between the expiration of his apprenticeship and\r\n    his departure for London he appears to have engraved several\r\n    excellent cuts for a school-book entitled “The Hive of Ancient and\r\n    Modern Literature,” printed by S. Hodgson, Newcastle.--Clennell’s\r\n    fellow-pupils were Henry Hole and Edward Willis. Mr. Hole engraved\r\n    the cuts in M’Creery’s Press, 1803, and in Poems by Felicia\r\n    Dorothea Browne, (afterwards Mrs. Hemans) 1808. Mr. Hole gave up\r\n    wood engraving several years ago on succeeding to a large estate\r\n    in Derbyshire. Mr. Willis, who was a cousin of Mr. George\r\n    Stephenson, the celebrated engineer, died in London, the 10th of\r\n    February, 1842, aged 58; but had for some time previously entirely\r\n    abandoned the art.]\r\n\r\nMost of Clennell’s cuts are distinguished by their free and\r\n_artist-like_ execution and by their excellent effect; but though\r\ngenerally spirited, they are sometimes rather coarsely engraved. He was\r\naccustomed to improve Thurston’s designs by occasionally heightening the\r\neffect.[VII-79] To such alterations Thurston at first objected; but\r\nperceiving that the cuts when engraved were thus very much improved, he\r\nafterwards allowed Clennell to increase the lights and deepen the\r\nshadows according to his own judgment. An admirable specimen of\r\nClennell’s engraving is to be found in an octavo edition of Falconer’s\r\nShipwreck, printed for Cadell and Davies, 1808. It occurs as a vignette\r\nto the second canto at p. 43, and the subject is a ship running before\r\nthe wind in a gale. The motion of the waves, and the gloomy appearance\r\nof the sky, are represented with admirable truth and feeling. The dark\r\nshadow on the waters to the right gives wonderful effect to the white\r\ncrest of the wave in front; and the whole appearance of the cut is\r\nindicative of a gloomy and tempestuous day, and of an increasing storm.\r\nPerhaps no engraving of the same kind, either on copper or wood, conveys\r\nthe idea of a storm at sea with greater fidelity.[VII-80] The drawing\r\nwas made on the block by Thurston; but the spirit and _effect_,--the\r\nlights and shadows, the apparent seething of the waves, and the troubled\r\nappearance of the sky,--were introduced by Clennell. All the other cuts\r\nin this edition of the Shipwreck are of his engraving; but though well\r\nexecuted, they do not require any especial notice. Two of them, which\r\nwere previously designed for another work, are certainly not\r\n_illustrations_ of Falconer’s Shipwreck.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-79: He also invariably corrected the _outline_ of\r\n    Thurston’s animals; “Fainting for the Living Waters” in the\r\n    Religious Emblems, and a little subject in an edition of Beattie’s\r\n    Minstrel, published at Alnwick, representing a shepherd and dog on\r\n    the brow of a hill, were thus improved by Clennell.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-80: Mr. Jackson was in possession of the first proof\r\n    of this pretty wood engraving, inscribed Twickenham, September 10,\r\n    1807, where Clennell was residing at the time.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: DIPLOMA OF THE HIGHLAND SOCIETY\r\n  _Reduced to one-fourth of the original size_]\r\n\r\nClennell’s largest cut is that which he engraved for the diploma of the\r\nHighland Society, from a design by Benjamin West, President of the Royal\r\nAcademy; and for this he received fifty guineas. The original drawing\r\nwas made on paper, and Clennell gave Thurston fifteen pounds for copying\r\non the block the figures within the circle: the supporters, a Highland\r\nsoldier and a fisherman, he copied himself. The block on which he first\r\nbegan to engrave this cut consisted of several pieces of box veneered\r\nupon beech; and after he had been employed upon it for about two months,\r\nit one afternoon suddenly split when he was at tea. Clennell, hearing it\r\ncrack, immediately suspected the cause; and on finding it rent in such a\r\nmanner that there was no chance of repairing it, he, in a passion that\r\nthe labour already bestowed on it should be lost, threw all the\r\ntea-things into the fire. In the course of a few days however, he got a\r\nnew block made, consisting of solid pieces of box firmly screwed and\r\ncramped together; and having paid Thurston fifteen pounds more for\r\nre-drawing the figures within the circle, and having again copied the\r\nsupporters, he proceeded with renewed spirit to complete his work. For\r\nengraving this cut he received a hundred and fifty guineas--he paying\r\nThurston himself for the drawing on the block; and the Society for the\r\nEncouragement of Arts and Manufactures presented him with their gold\r\nmedal, May 30, 1809. This cut is characteristic of Clennell’s style of\r\nengraving--the lines are in some places coarse, and in others the\r\nexecution is careless; the more important parts are, however, engraved\r\nwith great spirit; and the cut, as a whole, is bold and effective.\r\nCross-hatchings are freely introduced, not so much, perhaps, because\r\nthey were necessary, as to show that the engraver could execute such\r\nkind of work,--the vulgar error that cross-hatchings could not be\r\nexecuted on wood having been at that time extremely prevalent among\r\npersons who had little knowledge of the art, and who yet vented their\r\nabsurd notions on the subject as if they were undeniable truths. The\r\npreceding is a reduced copy of this cut.[VII-81] The original block,\r\nwhen only a very limited number of impressions had been printed off, was\r\nburnt in the fire at Mr. Bensley’s printing-office. The subject was\r\nafterwards re-engraved on a block of the same size by John Thompson.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-81: The original cut is about ten inches and a half\r\n    high, measured from the line below the inscription, by about\r\n    thirteen inches and a half wide, measured across the centre.]\r\n\r\nThe illustrations to an edition of Rogers’s Poems, 1812, engraved from\r\npen-and-ink drawings by Thomas Stothard, R.A., may be fairly ranked\r\namong the best of the wood-cuts engraved by Clennell. They are executed\r\nwith the feeling of an artist, and are admirable representations of the\r\noriginal drawings.[VII-82] Stothard himself was much pleased with them;\r\nbut he thought that when wood engravers attempted to express more than a\r\ncopy of a pen-and-ink drawing, and introduced a variety of tints in the\r\nmanner of copper-plate engravings, they exceeded the legitimate\r\nboundaries of the art. A hundred wood-cuts by Bewick, Nesbit, Clennell,\r\nand Thompson might, however, be produced to show that this opinion was\r\nnot well founded.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-82: Several additional cuts of the same kind,\r\n    engraved with no less ability by J. Thompson, were inserted in a\r\n    subsequent edition.]\r\n\r\nClennell, who drew beautifully in water-colours, made many of the\r\ndrawings for the Border Antiquities; and the encouragement which he\r\nreceived as a designer and painter made him resolve to entirely abandon\r\nwood engraving. With this view he laboured diligently to improve himself\r\nin painting, and in a short time made such progress that his pictures\r\nattracted the attention of the Directors of the British Institution. In\r\n1814, the Earl of Bridgewater employed him to paint a large picture of\r\nthe entertainment given to the Allied Sovereigns in the Guildhall by the\r\ncity of London. He experienced great difficulty in obtaining sketches of\r\nthe numerous distinguished persons whose portraits it was necessary to\r\ngive in the picture; and he lost much time, and suffered considerable\r\nanxiety, in procuring those preliminary materials for his work. Having\r\nat length completed his sketches, he began the picture, and had made\r\nconsiderable progress in it when, in April 1817, he suddenly became\r\ninsane, and the work was interrupted.[VII-83] It has been said that his\r\nmalady arose from intense application, and from anxiety respecting the\r\nsuccess of his work. This, however, can scarcely be correct; he had\r\nsurmounted his greatest difficulties, and was proceeding regularly and\r\nsteadily with the painting, when he suddenly became deprived of his\r\nreason. One of his fellow-pupils when he was with Bewick, who was\r\nintimate with him, and was accustomed to see him frequently, never\r\nobserved any previous symptom of insanity in his behaviour, and never\r\nheard him express any particular anxiety about the work on which he was\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-83: This painting was afterwards finished by\r\n    E. Bird, R.A., who also became insane.]\r\n\r\nWithin a short time after Clennell had lost his reason, his wife also\r\nbecame insane;[VII-84] and the malady being accompanied by a fever, she\r\nafter a short illness expired, leaving three young children to deplore\r\nthe death of one parent and the confirmed insanity of the other. These\r\nmost distressing circumstances excited the sympathy of several noblemen\r\nand gentlemen; and a committee having been appointed to consider of the\r\nbest means of raising a fund for the support of Clennell’s family, it\r\nwas determined to publish by subscription an engraving from one of his\r\npictures. The subject made choice of was the Decisive Charge of the Life\r\nGuards at Waterloo, for which Clennell had received a reward from the\r\nBritish Institution. It was engraved by Mr. W. Bromley, and published in\r\n1821. The sum thus raised was, after paying for the engraving, vested in\r\ntrustees for the benefit of Clennell’s children, and for the purpose of\r\nproviding a small annuity for himself.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-84: Clennell’s wife was a daughter of the late\r\n    C. Warren, one of the best copper-plate engravers of his time.]\r\n\r\nClennell, after having been confined for three or four years in a\r\nlunatic asylum in London, so far recovered that it was no longer\r\nnecessary to keep him in a state of restraint. He was accordingly sent\r\ndown to the North, and lived for several years in a state of harmless\r\ninsanity with a relation in the neighbourhood of Newcastle; amusing\r\nhimself with making drawings, engraving little wood-cuts, and\r\noccasionally writing _poetry_. Upwards of sixty of those drawings are\r\nnow lying before me, displaying at once so much of his former genius and\r\nof his present imbecility that it is not possible to regard them,\r\nknowing whose they are, without a deep feeling of commiseration for his\r\nfate. He used occasionally to call on Bewick, and he once asked for a\r\nblock to engrave. Bewick, to humour him, gave him a piece of wood, and\r\nleft him to choose his own subject; and Clennell, on his next visit,\r\nbrought with him the cut finished: it was like the attempt of a boy when\r\nfirst beginning to engrave, but he thought it one of the most successful\r\nof his productions in the art. The following specimens of his cuts and\r\nof his poetry were respectively engraved and written in 1828.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nSONG.\r\n\r\n  Good morning to you, Mary,\r\n    It glads me much to see thee once again;\r\n  What joy, since thee I’ve heard!\r\n    Heaven such beauty ever deign,\r\n                      Mary of the vineyard!\r\n\r\nTHE EVENING STAR.\r\n\r\n  Look! what is it, with twinkling light,\r\n  That brings such joy, serenely bright,\r\n  That turns the dusk again to light?--\r\n          ’Tis the Evening Star!\r\n  What is it with purest ray,\r\n  That brings such peace at close of day,\r\n  That lights the traveller on his way?--\r\n          ’Tis the Evening Star!\r\n  What is it, of purest holy ray,\r\n  That brings to man the promised day,\r\n  And peace?--\r\n          ’Tis the Evening Star!\r\n\r\nCOMPENDIUM POETICA.\r\n\r\n  A drop of heaven’s treasure, on an angel’s wing,\r\n  Such heaven alone can bring;--\r\n  The painted hues upon the rose,\r\n  In heaven’s shower reposing,\r\n  Is an earthly treasure of such measure.\r\n  The butterfly, in his spell,\r\n  Upon the rosy prism doth dwell,\r\n  And as he doth fly, in his tour\r\n  From flower to flower,\r\n  Is seen for a while\r\n  Every care to beguile,\r\n  And so doth wing his little way,\r\n  A little fairy of the day!\r\n\r\nA FLOWERET.\r\n\r\n  Where lengthened ray\r\n  Gildeth the bark upon her way;\r\n  Where vision is lost in space,\r\n        To trace,\r\n  As resting on a stile,\r\n  In ascent of half a mile--\r\n  It is when the birds do sing,\r\n  In the evening of the spring.\r\n  The broad shadow from the tree,\r\n        Falling upon the slope,\r\n  You may see,\r\n  O’er flowery mead,\r\n  Where doth a pathway lead\r\n        To the topmost ope--\r\n  The yellow butter-cup\r\n        And purple crow-foot,\r\n  The waving grass up,\r\n        Rounding upon the but--\r\n  The spreading daisy\r\n  In the clover maze,\r\n  The wild rose upon the hedge-row,\r\n  And the honey-suckle blow\r\n        For village girl\r\n  To dress her chaplet--\r\n  Or some youth, mayhap, let--\r\n  Or bind the linky trinket\r\n        For some earl--\r\n  Or trim up in plaits her hair\r\n  With much seeming care,\r\n  As fancy may think it--\r\n  Or with spittle moisten,\r\n  Or half wink it,\r\n  Or to music inclined,\r\n  Or to sleep in the soft wind.\r\n\r\n  St Peter’s, August 1828.\r\n\r\n  L. C.\r\n\r\nAbout 1831, Clennell having become much worse, his friends were again\r\ncompelled to place him under restraint. He was accordingly conveyed to a\r\nlunatic asylum near Newcastle, where he is still living. Until within\r\nthis last year or two, he continued to amuse himself with drawing and\r\nwriting poetry, and perhaps may do so still. It is to be hoped that,\r\nthough his condition appear miserable to us, he is not miserable\r\nhimself; that though deprived of the light of reason, he may yet enjoy\r\nimaginary pleasures of which we can form no conception; and that his\r\nconfinement occasions to him\r\n\r\n  “Small feeling of privation, none of pain.”[VII-85]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-85: Clennell died in the Lunatic Asylum, Feb. 9,\r\n    1840, in his fifty-ninth year.]\r\n\r\nWilliam Harvey, another distinguished pupil of Bewick, and one whose\r\nearlier engravings are only surpassed by his more recent productions as\r\na designer on wood, was born at Newcastle-on-Tyne, 13th of July 1796.\r\nHaving from an early age shown great fondness for drawing, he was at\r\nthe age of fourteen apprenticed to Thomas Bewick to learn the art of\r\nengraving on wood.[VII-86] In conjunction with his fellow-pupil, W. W.\r\nTemple, he engraved most of the cuts in Bewick’s Fables, 1818; and as he\r\nexcelled in drawing as well as in engraving, he was generally entrusted\r\nby Bewick to make the drawings on the block after Robert Johnson’s\r\ndesigns. One of the best cuts engraved by Harvey during his\r\napprenticeship was a vignette for the title-page of a small work\r\nentitled “Cheviot: a Poetical Fragment,” printed at Newcastle in 1817.\r\nThis cut, which was also drawn by himself, is extremely beautiful both\r\nin design and execution; the trees and the foliage are in particular\r\nexcellently represented; and as a small picturesque subject it is one of\r\nthe best he ever engraved.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-86: Isaac Nicholson, now established as a wood\r\n    engraver at Newcastle, was the apprentice immediately preceding\r\n    Harvey. W. W. Temple, who abandoned the business on the expiration\r\n    of his apprenticeship for that of a draper and silk-mercer, came\r\n    to Bewick shortly after Harvey; and the younger apprentice was\r\n    John Armstrong.]\r\n\r\nHarvey was a great favourite of Bewick, who presented him with a copy of\r\nthe History of British Birds as a new year’s gift on the 1st of January\r\n1815, and at the same time addressed to him the following admonitory\r\nletter. Mr. Harvey is a distinguished artist, a kind son, an\r\naffectionate husband, a loving father, and in every relation of life a\r\nmost amiable man: he has not, however, been exposed to any plots or\r\nconspiracies, nor been persecuted by envy and malice, as his master\r\nanticipated; but, on the contrary, his talents and his amiable character\r\nhave procured for him public reputation and private esteem.\r\n\r\n  “Gateshead, 1st January, 1815.\r\n\r\n  “DEAR WILLIAM,\r\n\r\n“I sent you last night the History of British Birds, which I beg your\r\nacceptance of as a new year’s gift, and also as a token of my respect.\r\nDon’t trouble yourself about thanking me for them; but, instead of doing\r\nso, let those books put you in mind of the duties you have to perform\r\nthrough life. Look at them (as long as they last) on every new year’s\r\nday, and at the same time resolve, with the help of the all-wise but\r\nunknowable God, to conduct yourself on every occasion as becomes a good\r\nman.--Be a good son, a good brother, (and when the time comes) a good\r\nhusband, a good father, and a good member of society. Peace of mind will\r\nthen follow you like a shadow; and when your mind grows rich in\r\nintegrity, you will fear the frowns of no man, and only smile at the\r\nplots and conspiracies which it is probable will be laid against you by\r\nenvy, hatred, and malice.\r\n\r\n  “To William Harvey, jun. Westgate.\r\n\r\n  [HW: Thomas Bewick].”\r\n\r\nIn September, 1817, Mr. Harvey came to London; and shortly afterwards,\r\nwith a view of obtaining a correct knowledge of the principles of\r\ndrawing, he became a pupil of Mr. B. R. Haydon, and he certainly could\r\nnot have had a better master. While improving himself under Mr. Haydon,\r\nhe drew and engraved from a picture by that eminent artist his large cut\r\nof the Death of Dentatus, which was published in 1821.[VII-87] As a\r\nlarge subject, this is unquestionably one of the most elaborately\r\nengraved wood-cuts that has ever appeared. It scarcely, however, can be\r\nconsidered a successful specimen of the art; for though the execution in\r\nmany parts be superior to anything of the kind, either of earlier or\r\nmore recent times, the cut, as a whole, is rather an attempt to rival\r\ncopper-plate engraving than a perfect specimen of engraving on wood,\r\ndisplaying the peculiar advantages and excellences of the art within its\r\nown legitimate bounds. More has been attempted than can be efficiently\r\nrepresented by means of wood engraving. The figure of Dentatus is indeed\r\none of the finest specimens of the art that has ever been executed, and\r\nthe other figures in the fore-ground display no less talent; but the\r\nrocks are of too uniform a _tone_, and some of the more distant figures\r\nappear to _stick_ to each other. These defects, however, result from the\r\nvery nature of the art, not from inability in the engraver; for all that\r\nwood engraving admits of he has effected. It is unnecessary to say more\r\nof this cut here: some observations relating to the details, illustrated\r\nwith specimens of the best engraved parts, will be found in the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-87: This cut is about fifteen inches high by about\r\n    eleven inches and one quarter wide. It was engraved on a block\r\n    consisting of seven different pieces, the joinings of which are\r\n    apparent in impressions that have not been subsequently _touched_\r\n    with Indian ink.]\r\n\r\nAbout 1824 Mr. Harvey entirely gave up the practice of engraving, and\r\nhas since exclusively devoted himself to designing for copper-plate and\r\nwood engravers. His designs engraved on copper are, however, few when\r\ncompared with the immense number engraved on wood. The copper-plate\r\nengravings consist principally of the illustrations in a collected\r\nedition of Miss Edgeworth’s Works, 1832; in Southey’s edition of\r\nCowper’s Works, first published in 1836, and since by Mr. Bohn in his\r\nStandard Library; and in the small edition of Dr. Lingard’s History of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SPECIMENS OF MR. HARVEY’S WOOD-ENGRAVING.\r\n  FROM DR. HENDERSON’S HISTORY OF ANCIENT AND MODERN WINES.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe beautiful vignettes and tail-pieces in Dr. Henderson’s History of\r\nAncient and Modern Wines, 1824, drawn and engraved by Mr. Harvey, may\r\nbe considered the ground-work of his reputation as a designer, and by\r\nthe kindness of Dr. Henderson we are enabled (in this second edition)\r\nto present impressions of seven of them. The cuts in the first and\r\nsecond series of Northcote’s Fables, 1828, 1833;[VII-88] in the Tower\r\nMenagerie, 1828; in the Gardens and Menagerie of the Zoological Society,\r\n1831; and in Latrobe’s Solace of Song, 1837, were all drawn by him.\r\nAmong the smaller works illustrated with wood-cuts, and published\r\nabout the same time as the preceding, the following may be mentioned\r\nas containing beautiful specimens of his talents as a designer on\r\nwood:--The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green; The Children in the Wood;\r\nA Story without an End, translated from the German by Mrs. Austin; and\r\nespecially his one hundred and twenty beautiful designs for the Paradise\r\nLost, and other poems of Milton, and his designs for Thomson’s Seasons,\r\nfrom which two works we select four examples with the view of exhibiting\r\nat the same time the talents of the distinguished engravers, viz.,\r\nJohn Thompson and Charles Gray. For various other works he has also\r\nfurnished, in all, between three and four thousand designs. As a\r\ndesigner on wood, he is decidedly superior to the majority of artists of\r\nthe present day; and to his excellence in this respect, wood engraving\r\nis chiefly indebted for the very great encouragement which it has of\r\nlate received in this country.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-88: What may be considered the sketches for the\r\n    principal cuts were supplied by Northcote himself. The following\r\n    account of the manner in which he _composed_ them is extracted\r\n    from a Sketch of his Life, prefixed to the second series of his\r\n    Fables, 1833:--“It was by a curious process that Mr. Northcote\r\n    really made the designs for these Fables the amusement of his old\r\n    age, for his talent as a draftsman, excelling as he did in\r\n    animals, was rarely required by this undertaking. His general\r\n    practice was to collect great numbers of prints of animals, and to\r\n    cut them out; he then moved such as he selected about upon the\r\n    surface of a piece of paper until he had illustrated the fable by\r\n    placing them to his satisfaction, and had thus composed his\r\n    subject; then fixing the different figures with paste to the\r\n    paper, a few pen or pencil touches rendered this singular\r\n    composition complete enough to place in the hands of Mr. Harvey,\r\n    by whom it was adapted or freely translated on the blocks for the\r\n    engravers.”--Mr. Harvey’s work was something more than free\r\n    translation. He _completed_ that which Northcote merely suggested.\r\n    The tail-pieces and letters are all of Mr. Harvey’s own invention\r\n    and drawing.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe two cuts on pages 533 and 534 are also from drawings by Mr. Harvey;\r\nand both are printed from casts. The first is one of the illustrations\r\nof the Children in the Wood, published by Jennings and Chaplin, 1831;\r\nand the subject is the uncle bargaining with the two ruffians for the\r\nmurder of the children. This cut is freely and effectively executed,\r\nwithout any display of useless labour.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe second is one of the illustrations of the Blind Beggar of Bethnal\r\nGreen, published by Jennings and Chaplin, in 1832. The subject\r\nrepresents the beggar’s daughter and her four suitors, namely,--the\r\ngentleman of good degree, the gallant young knight in disguise, the\r\nmerchant of London, and her master’s son. This cut, though well\r\nengraved, is scarcely equal to the preceding. It is, however, necessary\r\nto observe that these cuts are not given as specimens of the engravers’\r\ntalents, but merely as two subjects designed by Mr. Harvey.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhat has been called the “London School” of wood engraving produced\r\nnothing that would bear a comparison with the works of Bewick and his\r\npupils until the late Robert Branston began to engrave on wood. About\r\n1796, the best of the London engravers was J. Lee. He engraved the cuts\r\nfor the “Cheap Repository,” a collection of religious and moral tracts,\r\nprinted between 1794 and 1798, and sold by J. Marshall, London, and\r\nS. Hazard, Bath. Those cuts, though coarsely executed, as might be\r\nexpected, considering the work for which they were intended, frequently\r\ndisplay considerable merit in the design; and in this respect several of\r\nthem are scarcely inferior to the cuts drawn and engraved by John Bewick\r\nin Dr. Trusler’s Progress of Man and Society. Mr. Lee died in March,\r\n1804; and on his decease, his apprentice, Henry White, went to\r\nNewcastle, and served out the remainder of his time with Thomas Bewick.\r\nJames Lee, a son of Mr. J. Lee, the elder, is also a wood engraver; he\r\nexecuted the portraits in Hansard’s Typographia, 1825.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  _Rob. Branston._]\r\n\r\nRobert Branston, like Bewick, acquired his knowledge of wood engraving\r\nwithout the instructions of a master. He was born at Lynn, in Norfolk,\r\nin 1778, and died in London in 1827. He served his apprenticeship to his\r\nfather, a general copper-plate engraver and heraldic painter, who seems\r\nto have carried on the same kind of miscellaneous business as Mr.\r\nBeilby, the master of Bewick. About 1802 Mr. Branston came to London,\r\nand finding that wood engraving was much encouraged, he determined to\r\napply himself to that art. Some of his first productions were cuts for\r\nlottery bills; but as he improved in the practice of engraving on wood,\r\nhe began to engrave cuts for the illustration of books. His style of\r\nengraving is peculiarly his own, and perfectly distinct from that of\r\nBewick. He engraved human figures and in-door scenes with great\r\nclearness and precision; while Bewick’s chief excellence consisted in\r\nthe natural representation of quadrupeds, birds, landscapes, and\r\n_road-side_ incidents. In the representation of trees and of natural\r\nscenery, Branston has almost uniformly failed. Some of the best of his\r\nearlier productions are to be found in the History of England, published\r\nby Scholey, 1804-1810; in Bloomfield’s Wild Flowers, 1806; and in a\r\nquarto volume entitled “Epistles in Verse,” and other poems by George\r\nMarshall, 1812.\r\n\r\nThe best specimen of Mr. Branston’s talents as a wood engraver is a\r\nlarge cut of the Cave of Despair, in Savage’s Hints on Decorative\r\nPrinting. It was executed in rivalry with Nesbit, who engraved the cut\r\nof Rinaldo and Armida for the same work, and it would be difficult to\r\ndecide which is the best. Both are good specimens of the styles of their\r\nrespective schools; and the subjects are well adapted to display the\r\npeculiar excellence of the engravers. Had they exchanged subjects,\r\nneither of the cuts would have been so well executed; but in this case\r\nthere call be little doubt that Nesbit would have engraved the figure\r\nand the rocks in the Cave of Despair better than Branston would have\r\nengraved the trees and the foliage in the cut of Rinaldo and Armida. The\r\ncut on the previous page is a reduced copy of a portion of that of Mr.\r\nBranston.\r\n\r\nMr. Branston, like many others, did not think highly of the cuts in\r\nBewick’s Fables; and feeling persuaded that he could produce something\r\nbetter, he employed Mr. Thurston to make several designs, with the\r\nintention of publishing a similar work. After a few of them had been\r\nengraved, he gave up the thought of proceeding further with the work,\r\nfrom a doubt of its success. Bewick’s work was already in the market;\r\nand it was questionable if another of the same kind, appearing shortly\r\nafter, would meet with a sale adequate to defray the expense. The three\r\ncuts in the opposite page were engraved by Mr. Branston for the proposed\r\nwork. The two first are respectively illustrations of the fables of\r\nIndustry and Sloth, and of the Two Crabs; the third was intended as a\r\ntail-piece. The cut of Industry and Sloth is certainly superior to that\r\nof the same subject in Bewick’s Fables; but that of the Two Crabs,\r\nthough more delicately engraved, is not equal to the cut of the same\r\nsubject in Bewick.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  INDUSTRY AND SLOTH.--_Robert Branston._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  THE TWO CRABS.--_Robert Branston._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  TAIL-PIECE TO THE TWO CRABS.--_Robert Branston._]\r\n\r\nMr. Branston also thought that Bewick’s Birds were estimated too highly;\r\nand he engraved two or three cuts to show that he could do the same\r\nthings as well, or better. In this respect, however, he certainly formed\r\na wrong estimate of his abilities; for, it is extremely doubtful\r\nif--even with the aid of the best designer he could find--he could have\r\nexecuted twenty cuts of birds which, for natural character, would bear a\r\ncomparison with twenty of the worst engraved by Bewick himself. The\r\ngreat North-country man was an artist as well as a wood engraver; and in\r\nthis respect his principal pupils have also been distinguished. The cut\r\non our present page is one of those engraved by Mr. Branston to show his\r\nsuperiority over Bewick. The bird represented is probably the Grey\r\nPhalarope, or Scallop-toed Sand-piper, and it is unquestionably executed\r\nwith considerable ability; but though Bewick’s cut of the same bird be\r\none of his worst, it is superior to that engraved by Mr. Branston in\r\nevery essential point.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nBetween twenty and thirty years ago, a wood engraver named Austin\r\nexecuted several cuts, but did nothing to promote the art. William\r\nHughes, a native of Liverpool, who died in February 1825, at the early\r\nage of thirty-two, produced a number of wood engravings of very\r\nconsiderable merit. He chiefly excelled in architectural subjects. One\r\nof his best productions is a dedication cut in the first volume of\r\nJohnson’s Typographia, 1824, showing the interior of a chapel,\r\nsurrounded by the arms of the members of the Roxburgh Club. Another\r\nartist of the same period, named Hugh Hughes, of whom scarcely anything\r\nis now known, executed a whole volume of singularly beautiful wood\r\nengravings, entitled “The Beauties of Cambria, consisting of Sixty Views\r\nin North and South Wales,” London, 1823. The work was published by\r\nsubscription at one guinea, or on India paper at two guineas, and was\r\nbeautifully printed by the same John Johnson who printed William Hughes’\r\ncuts in the “Typographia,” and who, a few years previously, had\r\nconducted the Lee Priory Press. The annexed four examples will give an\r\nidea of the high finish and perfection of this elegant series.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  _Hugh Hughes, del. et sc._\r\n  PISTILL CAIN.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  _Hugh Hughes, del. et sc._\r\n  MOLL FAMAU.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  _Hugh Hughes, del. et sc._\r\n  WREXHAM CHURCH.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  _Hugh Hughes, del. et sc._\r\n  PWLL CARADOC.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  GROUP OF FISH.--_J. Thompson._]\r\n\r\nJohn Thompson,[VII-89] one of the best English wood engravers of the\r\npresent day, was a pupil of Mr. Branston. He not only excels, like his\r\nmaster, in the engraving of human figures, but displays equal talent in\r\nthe execution of all kinds of subjects. Among the very many excellent\r\ncuts which have been engraved in England within the last twenty years,\r\nthose executed by John Thompson rank foremost. As he is rarely unequal\r\nto himself, it is rather difficult to point out any which are very much\r\nsuperior to the others of his execution. The following, however, may be\r\nreferred to as specimens of the general excellence of his cuts:--The\r\ntitle-page to Puckle’s Club, 1817, and the cuts of Moroso, Newsmonger,\r\nSwearer, Wiseman, and Xantippe in the same work; the Trout, the Tench,\r\nthe Salmon, the Chub, and a group of small fish,[VII-90] consisting of\r\nthe Minnow, the Loach, the Bull-head, and the Stickle-back, in Major’s\r\nedition of Walton’s Angler;[VII-91] many of the cuts in Butler’s\r\nHudibras, published by Baldwyn in 1819, and reprinted by Bohn, in 1859,\r\nof which we annex an example; the portrait of Butler, prefixed to an\r\nedition of his Remains, published in 1827; and The Two Swine, The Mole\r\nbecome a Connoisseur, Love and Friendship, and the portrait of\r\nNorthcote, in the second series of Northcote’s Fables. One of his latest\r\ncuts is the beautifully executed portrait of Milton and his daughters,\r\nafter a design by Mr. Harvey, already given at page 531. The following\r\ncut--a reduced copy of one of the plates in the Rake’s Progress--by Mr.\r\nThompson, engraved a few years ago for a projected edition of Hogarth’s\r\nGraphic Works, of which only about a dozen cuts were completed, is one\r\nof the best specimens of the art that has been executed in modern times.\r\nIn the engraving of small cuts of this kind Mr. Thompson has never been\r\nsurpassed; and it is beyond the power of the art to effect more than\r\nwhat has here been accomplished.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-89: Charles Thompson, the brother of John, is also a\r\n    wood engraver. He resides at Paris, and his cuts are better known\r\n    in France than in this country. Miss Eliza Thompson, a daughter of\r\n    John Thompson, also engraves on wood.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-90: The Salmon, Chub, and group of small fish are\r\n    given on the preceding page from the actual cuts referred to.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote VII-91: Bewick was accustomed to speak highly of the\r\n    cuts of fish in this beautiful work (several of which are given on\r\n    the previous pages): the Salmon, engraved by J. Thompson, and the\r\n    Eel, by H. White, he especially admired. Among others scarcely\r\n    less excellent are the Pike, by R. Branston; and the Carp, the\r\n    Grayling, and the Ruffe, by H. White. Major, in his second\r\n    edition, went to great expense in substituting other engravings\r\n    for most of these, with the intention of surpassing all that, by\r\n    the aid of artists, he had done before--in which he to some extent\r\n    succeeded. In this second edition, the Salmon is engraved by John\r\n    Jackson. All Mr. Major’s wood-cuts, as well as many of Bewick’s,\r\n    having passed into the hands of Henry G. Bohn (the present\r\n    publisher), his edition of Walton’s Angler is extensively enriched\r\n    by them.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  SALMON.--_J.

Folkard; Charles Gray;* George Vasey; John Byfield;* John\r\nJackson;* Daniel Dodd, and John Dodd, brothers.--William Henry Powis,\r\nwho died in 1836, aged 28, was one of the best wood engravers of his\r\ntime. Several beautiful cuts executed by him are to be found in Martin\r\nand Westall’s Pictorial Illustrations of the Bible, 1833, and in an\r\nedition of Scott’s Bible, 1834; both works now published by Mr. Bohn.\r\nThe following examples, principally taken from Martin and Westall’s\r\nIllustrations, will exemplify the talents of a few of the distinguished\r\nartists above mentioned. It would swell the book beyond its limits to\r\ngive more, otherwise we might select from the same work, which contains\r\none hundred and forty engravings, by all the principal wood engravers of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote *: All the engravers to whose names an asterisk is added\r\n    are now deceased.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  JOHN MARTIN   JOHN JACKSON]\r\n\r\nThe above cut was engraved by Mr. John Jackson in 1833. Abundant\r\nevidences of the versatility of his xylographic talent, are scattered\r\nthroughout the present volume, of which, though not the author in a\r\nliterary sense, he was at least the conductor and proprietor. Among the\r\nsubjects pointed out by Mr. Chatto as engraved by Mr. Jackson, those on\r\npages 473, 495, 496, 512, 605, 614, deserve to be mentioned.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  JOHN MARTIN   F. W. BRANSTON]\r\n\r\nMr. F. W. Branston, brother of Mr. Robert Branston, has long been known\r\nas one of our best engravers, as the annexed Specimen will shew.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  JOHN MARTIN   E. LANDELLS]\r\n\r\nMR. EBENEZER LANDELLS, the engraver of this beautiful cut, has quite\r\nrecently been lost to us. He was projector, and for a long time\r\nproprietor, of The Ladies’ Illustrated Newspaper, and has engraved an\r\nimmense number of subjects of all classes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  JOHN MARTIN   W. H. POWIS]\r\n\r\nThe talented engraver of the present subject has already been named,\r\nwith commendation, at page 544. We learn that the sum paid him for\r\nengraving it was fifteen guineas, being three guineas more than the\r\naverage price. Mr. Wm. Bagg, now a successful draftsman of anatomical\r\nsubjects, made this and all the other drawings on the blocks at the rate\r\nof five guineas each, and Mr. John Martin had ten guineas each for the\r\ndesigns. As the volume contains 144 subjects it must have cost the\r\nprojectors, Messrs. Bull and Churton, upwards of four thousand guineas:\r\nit may now be bought for a dozen shillings.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  JOHN MARTIN   THOS. WILLIAMS]\r\n\r\nMR. THOMAS WILLIAMS ranks high as an engraver on wood, and the\r\nillustrated works of the last twenty years teem with his performances.\r\nSome of the engravings in the Merrie Days of England, 1859, are by him.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  JOHN MARTIN   W. T. GREEN]\r\n\r\nThe only other Illustration which we shall take from Martin and\r\nWestall’s Bible Prints is the above, engraved by Mr. W. T. Green, who\r\ncontinues to exercise his burin with great skill, and has recently\r\nengraved one of the plates in Merrie Days of England, and Favourite\r\nEnglish Poems, and several of Maclise’s designs for Tennyson’s Princess.\r\nTo this is added, as a vignette finish to the chapter, an engraving\r\nrecently executed by him for an illustrated edition of Milton’s Paradise\r\nLost, now published in Bohn’s Library, and already mentioned at page\r\n531.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal wood engravers in Germany, about the time that\r\nBewick began to practise the art in England, was Unger. In 1779 he\r\npublished a tract, containing five cuts of his own engraving, discussing\r\nthe question whether Albert Durer actually engraved on wood: his\r\ndecision is in the negative. In the same year, his son also published a\r\ndissertation, illustrated with wood-cuts, on the progress of wood\r\nengraving in Brandenburg, with an account of the principal books\r\ncontaining wood-cuts printed in that part of Prussia. They jointly\r\nexecuted some chiaro-scuros, and a number of trifling book-illustrations\r\nsuch as are to be found in Heineken’s Idée Générale d’une Collection\r\ncomplette d’Estampes. These cuts are of a very inferior character.\r\nGubitz, a German wood engraver, who flourished about thirty years ago,\r\nexecuted several cuts which are much superior to any I have seen by the\r\nUngers. Several of those engraved by Gubitz, bear considerable\r\nresemblance to the cuts of Bewick. The principal French wood engravers\r\nin the eighteenth century, subsequent to Papillon, were Gritner and\r\nBeugnet; but neither of them produced anything superior to the worst of\r\nthe cuts to be found in the work of Papillon. With them wood engraving\r\nin France rather declined than advanced. Of late years the art has made\r\ngreat progress both in Germany and France; and should the taste for\r\nwood-cuts continue to increase in those countries, their engravers may\r\nregain for the art that popularity which it enjoyed in former times,\r\nwhen Nuremberg and Lyons were the great marts for works illustrated with\r\nwood engravings.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  W. HARVEY   W. T. GREEN]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nARTISTS AND ENGRAVERS ON WOOD OF THE PRESENT DAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present chapter, which is additional to the former edition, had not\r\nbeen contemplated until the previous pages were printed off. But it was\r\nthen suggested to the publisher, by one who was able and willing to\r\nco-operate in the object, that although the book was intended to be\r\nmerely an improved reprint of what had been given before, a short\r\nchapter might advantageously be added respecting those Artists of the\r\npresent day who were omitted by Jackson, or have risen to eminence since\r\nhis time.\r\n\r\nApplications in the form of a circular were accordingly issued, and have\r\nresulted in the Specimens now presented. They must speak for themselves,\r\nit not being within the province of the publisher to pronounce as to\r\ntheir respective merits. Besides which, the art of wood-engraving, owing\r\nto the enormous impulse given to it during the last twenty years, has\r\nattained such a pitch of excellence, that it would be somewhat difficult\r\nto determine who, if sufficiently stimulated, could produce the most\r\nperfect work. Artists in Wood, like Artists in Oil, have their\r\nspecialties, and excel relatively in Landscape, Cattle, or Figure\r\ndrawing; Architecture, Natural History, Diagrams, or Humour. But though\r\neach may acquire distinction in the department which choice or accident\r\nhas assigned him, some can undertake all departments equally well. In\r\nsaying this we refer to engraving rather than designing, for Harrison\r\nWeir would hardly undertake Architecture; Orlando Jewitt, Animals; or\r\nGeorge Cruikshank, Mathematical Diagrams.\r\n\r\nWhen, with the age of Bewick, wood-engraving began to reassume its\r\nimportance for book illustration, both designing and engraving were\r\ngenerally performed by the same hand; but, in the present day, the\r\nprofessions are becoming too important to be joined, and those who, like\r\nWilliam Harvey, Samuel Williams, and others, commenced by practising\r\nboth, now, recognising the modern policy of a division of labour,\r\nconfine themselves with few exceptions to one. Our business here, so far\r\nas designs are concerned, is almost limited to those draughtsmen who\r\nhabitually draw on wood, for it is unnecessary to say that every drawing\r\nor painting may be transferred to wood by the practical operator.\r\n\r\nThe following Specimens are given in accidental order rather than with\r\nany notion of precedence or classification.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  PERCIVAL SKELTON   JAMES COOPER\r\n  THE SIERRA MORENA]\r\n\r\nThe present and following specimens are engraved by JAMES COOPER. The\r\nfirst one is from Mr. Murray’s illustrated edition of Childe Harold,\r\npublished in 1859, which contains eighty engravings, all designed by Mr.\r\nPercival Skelton; the others from the Select Poems and Songs of Robert\r\nBurns, published by Kent & Co. in 1858. Mr. Cooper is favourably known\r\nto the artistic world by his engravings in Rhymes and Roundelayes,\r\na volume to which we shall presently refer again; Poetry and Pictures\r\nfrom Thomas Moore, Longmans, 1858; The Merrie Days of England, 1859;\r\nFavourite English Poems, 1858; and Bloomfield’s Farmer’s Boy,\r\n1858--mostly after designs by Birket Foster, and all produced under the\r\nsuperintendence of Mr. Joseph Cundall.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  BANKS OF THE NITH.\r\n  BURNS’ POEMS]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  HARRISON WEIR   JAMES COOPER\r\n  THE TWA DOGS.\r\n  BURNS’ POEMS]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  HARRISON WEIR   JAMES COOPER\r\n  TO AULD MARE MAGGIE\r\n  BURNS’ POEMS]\r\n\r\nThis and the preceding three specimens complete what we have to adduce\r\nof Mr. Cooper’s engraving: the designers will be spoken of in subsequent\r\npages.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  HARRISON WEIR   J. GREENAWAY\r\n  THE POETRY OF NATURE.]\r\n\r\nMR. HARRISON WEIR is distinguished for his spirited drawings of animals\r\nand rural landscapes, as will be seen in the annexed examples, which are\r\nengraved by W. Wright (formerly with Vizetelly) and John Greenaway. He\r\nhas contributed to most of the popular works of recent date, in which\r\nanimals form a feature. Among them may be named: The Poetry of the Year;\r\nPoems and Songs by Robert Burns; Poetry and Pictures from Thomas Moore;\r\nFavourite English Poems; Barry Cornwall’s Dramatic Scenes and Poems;\r\nFable Book for Children; James Montgomery’s Poems, 1860, and Wood’s\r\nNatural History.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  HARRISON WEIR   N.

GREENAWAY]\r\n\r\nBoth this and the specimen on the preceding page are from the\r\nillustrated edition of Campbell’s Pleasures of Hope, of which all the\r\nplates are engraved by MR. JOHN GREENAWAY.\r\n\r\nMr. Greenaway has contributed to many other of the illustrated\r\npublications of the present day, and among them to the Poetry of Nature,\r\nedited by Mr. J. Cundall, with thirty-six cuts all designed by Harrison\r\nWeir. Low and Son, 1860. Bloomfield’s Farmer’s Boy, 1858; Favourite\r\nEnglish Ballads, 1859.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  BIRKET FOSTER   EDMUND EVANS\r\n  WILD FLOWERS.]\r\n\r\nEngraved by EDMUND EVANS from a design by Birket Foster for Rhymes and\r\nRoundelayes, published by Mr. Bogue in 1857, and since by Messrs.\r\nRoutledge. Mr. Evans has likewise engraved the Landscapes in Cowper’s\r\nTask, after designs by the same artist, Herbert’s Poetical Works, and\r\nGraham’s Sabbath, all published by Nisbet & Co.; the Landscapes in\r\nScott’s Lay of the Last Minstrel, and Marmion, published by Adam Black &\r\nCo.; many of the subjects in Poems and Songs by Robert Burns, from which\r\nwe have given several specimens, The Merrie Days of England, &c.; and\r\nall the illustrations in Goldsmith’s Poetical Works, which are printed\r\nin Colours by himself.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  BIRKET FOSTER   W. J. PALMER\r\n  LAYS OF THE HOLY LAND]\r\n\r\nEngraved by W. J. PALMER, after a design by Birket Foster, for Lays of\r\nthe Holy Land, published by Nisbet & Co. Mr. Palmer has also contributed\r\nto the Illustrated edition of Thomson’s Seasons, The Merchant of Venice,\r\nGray’s Poems, published by Low and Son; The Merrie Days of England, Kent\r\n& Co., and other pictorial works, chiefly after the designs of Birket\r\nFoster, and under the superintendence of Mr. Cundall.\r\n\r\nAlthough several specimens have already been given of Birket Foster’s\r\npowers of design, in speaking of the engravers, we give another, one of\r\nhis earliest, that we may have occasion to say something of himself.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  BIRKET FOSTER   H. VIZETELLY\r\n  EVANGELINE.]\r\n\r\nMR. BIRKET FOSTER was a pupil of Mr. Landells, who, discerning his\r\nartistic talent, employed him from an early age in the superior\r\ndepartment of his profession. After he commenced on his own account, his\r\nfirst important illustrations were for Longfellow’s Poetical Works, of\r\nwhich the above is a specimen. He has since partly or wholly\r\nillustrated, besides those works already mentioned under the name of the\r\nengraver, Adams’s Allegories, published by Messrs. Rivington; The Book\r\nof Favourite Modern Ballads, Poets of the Nineteenth Century, Christmas\r\nwith the Poets, Favourite English Poems, Home Affections, The Merrie\r\nDays of England, Barry Cornwall’s Dramatic Scenes and Poems, Southey’s\r\nLife of Nelson, Gosse’s Rivers of the Bible, and many other of the best\r\nworks of the period. In 1859 he was elected a member of the Old Water\r\nColour Society, and has since then devoted himself almost exclusively,\r\nand with great success, to painting in Water Colours.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  JOHN TENNIEL   DALZIEL]\r\n\r\nMR. JOHN TENNIEL is a successful illustrator of Historical subjects, and\r\nBallad poetry, and has produced many fine examples of his pencil. His\r\nmost recent work is a series of sixty-nine designs for the illustrated\r\nedition of Moore’s Lalla Rookh, engraved by the Messrs. Dalziel, which\r\nthe “Times” of Nov. 1, 1860, calls the “greatest illustrative\r\nachievement of any single hand,” and of which we here present an\r\nexample. He is now engaged in illustrating Shirley Brooks’ story called\r\nThe Silver Cord, in “Once a Week;” and in 1857 he contributed a number\r\nof spirited designs to the illustrated edition of Barry Cornwall’s\r\nPoetical Works. Among Mr. Tenniel’s earlier works are several in the\r\nBook of British Ballads, edited by Samuel Carter Hall, in 1843; and\r\namong his popular designs, sketched with a free pencil, are his large\r\ncuts in “Punch,” and his small ones in Punch’s Pocket Book.\r\n\r\n  [Illustrations:\r\n  JOHN TENNIEL   DALZIEL\r\n  DEATH OF SFORZA.\r\n  SFORZA.]\r\n\r\nBoth these examples are from Barry Cornwall’s dramatic sketch, entitled\r\nLudovico Sforza, published in the illustrated edition of his Poems.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  JOHN GILBERT.   DALZIEL BROTHERS.\r\n  ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA.]\r\n\r\nEngraved by MESSRS. DALZIEL, BROTHERS, after the designs of MR. JOHN\r\nGILBERT. These highly appreciated Artists appear together in a\r\nconsiderable number of the illustrated publications of the present day.\r\nMessrs. Dalziel are among the most extensive of our wood-engravers, and\r\nhave taken part in all the illustrated works of importance which have\r\nbeen produced during the last twenty years. Among the recent ones\r\nare:--Staunton’s Illustrated Shakspeare, from which the above specimen\r\nis taken, and Longfellow’s Poems, Routledge, 1859; Barry Cornwall’s\r\nDramatic Scenes and Poems, with fifty-seven wood-engravings, published\r\nby Chapman and Hall in 1857, now republished by Henry G. Bohn; and\r\nTennyson’s Princess, after drawings by Maclise. These artists are at\r\npresent engaged in engraving Millais’ Designs in the “Cornhill\r\nMagazine.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  THOMAS DALZIEL   DALZIEL BROTHERS\r\n  THE FLORENTINE PARTY.]\r\n\r\nThe present engraving, executed by the Brothers Dalziel, for Barry\r\nCornwall’s Poems, gives a pleasing example of Mr. Thomas Dalziel’s\r\ndrawing.\r\n\r\n   *   *   *\r\n\r\nThe next two are early designs by Mr. John Gilbert. The first is from\r\nthe Percy Tales of the Kings of England, originally published in 1840,\r\nby Mr. Cundall, and since by Henry G. Bohn; the other from Maxwell’s\r\nLife of the Duke of Wellington, in which there are upwards of one\r\nhundred similar vignettes, originally published in 1840, by Messrs.\r\nBaily, Brothers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  JOHN GILBERT   KIRCHNER\r\n  PRINCE ARTHUR AND HUBERT DE BOURG.\r\n  FROM PERCY TALES OF THE KINGS OF ENGLAND.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  JOHN GILBERT]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  THE DEMON LOVER.\r\n  JOHN GILBERT.]\r\n\r\nWe have here, engraved by MR. W. A. FOLKARD, another of the early\r\ndesigns of MR. JOHN GILBERT. It is one of the illustrations to the Book\r\nof English Ballads, edited by S. C. Hall, in 1843, which contains\r\nupwards of four hundred wood-engravings, and was the first work of any\r\nconsequence that presented a combination of the best artists of the\r\ntime. Indeed, it was the leader in what may be called the Illustrated\r\nChristmas Books of the present day. Since this period, Mr. Gilbert has\r\nprobably produced more drawings on wood than any other artist, and has\r\ncontributed to almost every illustrated book of any importance. He is a\r\nmember of the Old Water Colour Society, and has sent many fine drawings\r\nto the Exhibition.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  G. H. THOMAS   W. L. THOMAS\r\n  FROM HIAWATHA.]\r\n\r\nWILLIAM L. THOMAS deserves to rank among the foremost of our\r\nwood-engravers, as will be seen by the present specimen. He engraved\r\nmost of the subjects to Hiawatha, all of which were drawn by his brother\r\nGeorge H. THOMAS, and are now included in Bohn’s Illustrated edition of\r\nLongfellow’s Works; many of Mr. Maclise’s masterly designs for\r\nTennyson’s Princess, and all the subjects for the Boys’ Book of Ballads,\r\nfrom drawings by John Gilbert. They have also contributed, separately or\r\ntogether, to the Book of Favourite Modern Ballads, Poetry and Pictures\r\nfrom Thomas Moore, Burns’ Poems, The Merrie Days of England, Favourite\r\nEnglish Poems, and many other illustrated works.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  HIAWATHA.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nEngraved by HORACE HARRAL (a pupil of the late John Orrin Smith), after\r\na design by George Thomas, for the illustrated edition of Longfellow’s\r\nPoems, formerly published in detached portions by Kent & Co., and now\r\ncompletely by H. G. Bohn. These artists have also contributed to the\r\nillustrated editions of Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner, Burns’ Poems,\r\nCampbell’s Pleasures of Hope, the Merchant of Venice, and The Merrie\r\nDays of England; also to the Poetry and Pictures from Thomas Moore. Mr.\r\nGeorge Thomas, who has long ranked as one of our best draughtsmen of\r\nfigure subjects, has of late turned his attention almost exclusively to\r\npainting in oils, and is a successful exhibitor.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  G. H. THOMAS   E. EVANS\r\n  JOHN ANDERSON MY JO.\r\n  BURNS’ POEMS.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  G. H. THOMAS   E.

MACLISE   W. THOMAS\r\n  FROM TENNYSON’S PRINCESS.]\r\n\r\nThe illustrated volume from which this is taken has twenty-six\r\nillustrations, engraved by W. Thomas, W. T. Green, E. Williams, and\r\nDalziel, Brothers. Miss E. Williams is a daughter of the late talented\r\nSamuel Williams.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  D. MACLISE, R.A.   J. THOMPSON\r\n  LEONORA]\r\n\r\nHere is another Design by MR. D. MACLISE, R.A., who in his own peculiar\r\nmanner has furnished drawings on wood for several finely illustrated\r\npublications, among which may be enumerated Longman’s edition of the\r\nPoems and Songs of Thomas Moore, and especially Tennyson’s Princess, of\r\nwhich we have given an example on a previous page. The present is the\r\nsmallest of a series of designs engraved by Mr. John Thompson, for that\r\nstirring Ballad, Bürger’s Leonora.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  PERCIVAL SKELTON   J. W. WHYMPER\r\n  CHILDE HAROLD.]\r\n\r\nMR. PERCIVAL SKELTON has been mentioned incidentally on a previous page,\r\nand we should have given in addition a fine example of his pencil from\r\nthe Book of Favourite Modern Ballads, but the plate is too large. This\r\npresent small specimen is to introduce the name of MR. J. W. WHYMPER,\r\nwho has been concerned in many of the illustrated publications of the\r\nlast thirty years, and especially those published by the Christian\r\nKnowledge Society.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  CLARKSON STANFIELD, R.A.   H. VIZETELLY\r\n  ANDERSON READING THE BIBLE TO JACK.]\r\n\r\nMR. HENRY VIZETELLY has been so indefatigable for the last twenty years\r\nin producing illustrated works in every department, that examples of his\r\nwood engraving are extensively distributed. He is besides a printer,\r\nwell skilled in bringing up wood-cuts, which is a most delicate and\r\nartistic process. All the engravings in Miller’s Boy’s Country Year\r\nBook, and the Book of Wonderful Inventions, are engraved by him, or\r\nunder his direction, as are also most of the charming series of designs\r\nmade by CLARKSON STANFIELD, R.A. for Marryat’s Poor Jack, of which the\r\nannexed is a specimen; many of the plates in Bohn’s illustrated edition\r\nof Longfellow’s Poems; and the entire series of Christmas with the\r\nPoets, fifty-three subjects, printed in tints by himself.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  BIRKET FOSTER   H. VIZETELLY\r\n  CHRISTMAS IN THE OLDEN TIME.]\r\n\r\nWe here present a specimen of a series of engravings executed by Mr.\r\nVizetelly, for a work projected by the late Mr. Bogue, and yet\r\nunpublished.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nSAMUEL WILLIAMS (recently deceased) deserves a conspicuous niche in the\r\nWalhalla of Artists for his forty-eight beautiful illustrations of\r\nThomson’s Seasons, all drawn and engraved by himself. The annexed\r\nspecimens selected from that volume (now about to be published by Mr.\r\nBohn in his Illustrated Library) will give a fair example of his\r\npeculiar taste in the miniature treatment of rural subjects.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  JOHN WOLF   G.

GEORGE PEARSON, a\r\nrising artist, after drawings made by JOHN WOLF, for the illustrations\r\nof T. W. Atkinson’s Travels in the Region of the Upper and Lower Amoor\r\n(in Eastern Asia). Mr. Wolf, like Mr. Harrison Weir, has a preference\r\nfor animal drawing, and excels in it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  JOHN WOLF   G. PEARSON\r\n  HARE HAWKING.]\r\n\r\nThis well-executed cut of Hare Hawking is from Messrs. Freeman and\r\nSalvin’s Work on Falconry, recently published by Messrs. Longman.\r\n\r\nMr. Pearson has lately been engaged in engraving Icthyological subjects\r\nfor Hartwig’s Sea and its Living Wonders, and some other works of\r\nNatural History, a department which he is cultivating by preference.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  G. PEARSON\r\n  FALLS OF NIAGARA.]\r\n\r\nThe Vignette by the same engraver is one of the Illustrations of Bohn’s\r\nPictorial Hand-book of Geography just published.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  H. ANELAY   MEASOM\r\n  FROM SANDFORD AND MERTON.]\r\n\r\nMR. H. ANELAY is well known to the public as a draughtsman on wood,\r\nespecially in the departments of portrait and figure drawing. The\r\npresent example, taken from Bohn’s Illustrated edition of Sandford and\r\nMerton, is engraved by MR. MEASOM, whose practice is extensive and of\r\nlong standing. Several of the figure subjects in Merrie Days of England,\r\nrecently published by Kent and Co., and in Favourite English Poems,\r\npublished by Low and Co. are by him.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  JOHN ABSOLON   THOMAS BOLTON\r\n  MILES STANDISH.]\r\n\r\nMR. J. ABSOLON has for many years been an illustrator of popular story\r\nbooks and poems, most of which have been published or edited by Mr.\r\nCundall. Among them may be named, Favourite English Poems, published by\r\nLow and Co., in 1859; Rhymes and Roundelayes, Routledge, 1858;\r\nGoldsmith’s Poetical Works; and Lockhart’s Spanish Ballads, published by\r\nMurray. The present specimen is from Bohn’s Illustrated edition of\r\nLongfellow’s Poems, in which the Miles Standish is chiefly illustrated\r\nby the designs of Mr. Absolon, and entirely engraved by MR. THOMAS\r\nBOLTON, an artist of considerable repute, whose name appears in many of\r\nthe books quoted in these pages, and among others, in the Poems and\r\nSongs of Robert Burns.\r\n\r\nMr. Bolton has just invented a process by which the powers of\r\nphotography may be applied direct to the production of subjects from\r\nnature or art on wood, and from which the engraving can be made without\r\nthe intervention of drawing. We annex his first specimen; others are\r\nabout to appear in the illustrated edition of Miss Winkworth’s Lyra\r\nGermanica.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  FLAXMAN   THOMAS BOLTON]\r\n\r\nThis specimen of MR. BOLTON’S new process is taken from the well-known\r\nrelief of Flaxman, “_Deliver us from evil_.” It is one of the first\r\nsuccessful photographs on wood, and was printed and engraved by MR.\r\nTHOMAS BOLTON, from Mr. Leighton’s negative.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  R. DOYLE   JOHN SWAIN\r\n  MONTALVA’S FAIRY TALES.]\r\n\r\nMR. RICHARD DOYLE’s manner of drawing is fairly exemplified in the\r\npresent engraving, executed by him for Montalva’s Fairy Tales of all\r\nNations, published by Chapman & Hall in 1859. Mr. Doyle has illustrated\r\na considerable number of books of a popular character, among which may\r\nbe named: The Scouring of the White Horse; The Newcomes; The Continental\r\nTour of Brown, Jones, and Robinson, of which we give an example on the\r\nnext page: Manners and Customs of the English; and Pips’ Diary.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  RICHARD DOYLE   JOHN SWAIN\r\n  BROWN, JONES, AND ROBINSON IN VENICE.]\r\n\r\nMr. Doyle’s “Foreign Tour of Brown, Jones, and Robinson, what they saw\r\nand did in Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy,” published in 1855,\r\nhas acquired great popularity among the lovers of comic literature, and\r\nby the kindness of the publishers, Messrs. Bradbury and Evans, we are\r\nenabled to give a specimen.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  JOHN LEECH   ORRIN SMITH\r\n  FROM UNCLE TOM’S CABIN.]\r\n\r\nMR. JOHN LEECH is so well known to every reader of “Punch,” that we need\r\nhardly do more here than merely mention his name as one of the best and\r\nmost extensive of our graphic humorists.\r\n\r\nAmong the many books to which he has contributed are: The Comic History\r\nof England; Comic History of Rome; Comic Aspects of English Social Life;\r\nTour in Ireland; Soapy Sponge’s Sporting Tour; Young Troublesome; Mr.\r\nJorrocks’ Hunt; Punch’s Almanack; and several editions of Uncle Tom’s\r\nCabin, from one of which (our own) the above specimen is taken, drawn,\r\nas we have reason to believe, in the course of two or three hours.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  JOHN LEECH   JOHN SWAIN\r\n  PEASANTRY ON THEIR WAY TO AN IRISH FAIR.\r\n  TOUR IN IRELAND.]\r\n\r\nAnother specimen of Mr. Leech’s comic humour, taken from his Tour in\r\nIreland, published at the Punch Office.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  JOHN LEIGHTON   HENRY LEIGHTON\r\n  HASTEN AT LEISURE.]\r\n\r\nWe here present a specimen of that curious work, “Moral Emblems of all\r\nAges and Nations,” published by Messrs. Longman & Co. The whole book has\r\nbeen drawn after the originals and superintended throughout by MR. JOHN\r\nLEIGHTON, who is well known under his pseudonyme of “Luke Limner.” The\r\nengraving is by HENRY LEIGHTON.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  EDWARD DUNCAN   HORACE HARRAL\r\n  THE BLOWING UP OF CORINTH]\r\n\r\nEDWARD DUNCAN, a member of the Old Water Colour Society, often draws on\r\nwood, especially Landscapes and Naval subjects. He has contributed to\r\nthe Book of Favourite Modern Ballads, Favourite English Poems, Rhymes\r\nand Roundelayes, Poetry and Pictures from Thomas Moore, the Soldier’s\r\nDream, and Lays of the Holy Land.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  E.

JEWITT\r\n  NORTH PORCH OF STA. MARIA MAGGIORE, BERGAMO.]\r\n\r\nThe wood-engravings in the present and following pages are by MR.\r\nORLANDO JEWITT, who devotes himself almost exclusively to Gothic\r\nArchitecture and Ornament, in which he is pre-eminent. He is one of the\r\nvery few who continue to combine designing and drawing with engraving.\r\nThe first specimen here presented is from Street’s Brick and Marble\r\nArchitecture of Italy in the Middle Ages, 8vo., published by Mr. Murray\r\nin 1855.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  O. JEWITT\r\n  SHRINE IN BAYEUX CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\nOur second specimen, and two of those on the next page, are from Mr.\r\nPugin’s splendid work, the “Glossary of Ecclesiastical Ornament,”\r\npublished by Henry G. Bohn in 1846.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HEARSE OF MARGARET, COUNTESS OF WARWICK.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustrations: SPECIMENS OF ENGRAVING BY ORLANDO JEWITT.\r\n\r\n  O.

He is now engaged in drawing and engraving\r\nMurray’s Handbook of English Cathedrals.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  T. CRESWICK   J. WILLIAMS\r\n  THE NUT BROWN MAID.]\r\n\r\nMR. CRESWICK, R.A., the distinguished painter, has occasionally drawn on\r\nwood, but more as a favour than part of his _métier_. The present\r\nspecimen, one of a series contributed to the Book of British Ballads, is\r\nso highly praised by Mr. Ruskin, and at the same time so elaborately\r\ncriticised, that we think it in place to quote his words. After\r\ncomparing him advantageously with Poussin, he proceeds to say, “Who with\r\none thought or memory of nature in his heart could look at the two\r\nlandscapes, and receive Poussin’s with ordinary patience? Take Creswick\r\nin black and white, where he is unembarrassed by his fondness for\r\npea-green, the illustrations, for instance, to the _Nut-Brown Maid_, in\r\nthe Book of English Ballads. Look at the intricacy and fulness of the\r\ndark oak foliage, where it bends over the brook; see how you can go\r\nthrough it, and into it, and come out behind it, to the quiet bit of\r\nsky. Observe the grey aërial transparency of the stunted copse on the\r\nleft, and the entangling of the boughs where the light near foliage\r\ndetaches itself. Above all, note the forms of the masses of light. Not\r\nthings like scales or shells, sharp at the edge, and flat in the middle,\r\nbut irregular and rounded, stealing in and out accidentally from the\r\nshadow, and presenting in general outline, as the masses of all trees\r\ndo, a resemblance to the specific forms of the leaves of which they are\r\ncomposed. Turn over the page, and look into the weaving of the foliage\r\nand sprays against the dark-night-sky, how near they are, yet how\r\nuntraceable; see how the moonlight creeps up underneath them, trembling\r\nand shivering on the silver boughs above; note also, the descending bit\r\nof ivy, on the left, of which only a few leaves are made out, and the\r\nrest is confusion, or tells only in the moonlight like faint flakes of\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\n“But nature observes another principle in her foliage, more important\r\neven than its intricacy. She always secures an exceeding harmony and\r\nrepose. She is so intricate that her minuteness of parts becomes to the\r\neye, at a little, one united veil or cloud of leaves, to destroy the\r\nevenness of which is perhaps a greater fault than to destroy its\r\ntransparency. Look at Creswick’s oak again, in its dark parts. Intricate\r\nas it is, all is blended into a cloud-like harmony of shade, which\r\nbecomes fainter and fainter as it retires, with the most delicate\r\nflatness and unity of tone. And it is by this kind of vaporescence, so\r\nto speak, by this flat misty unison of parts, that nature and her\r\nfaithful followers are enabled to keep the eye in perfect repose in the\r\nmidst of profusion, and to display beauty of form wherever they choose,\r\nto the greatest possible advantage, by throwing it across some quiet\r\nvisionary passage of dimness and rest.”\r\n\r\nMr. Creswick has recently contributed several vignettes to Tennyson’s\r\nPoems. The following, engraved by MASON JACKSON, is from Bohn’s\r\nIllustrated edition of Walton’s Angler, to which Mr. Creswick has\r\ncontributed several others.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  CRESWICK   MASON JACKSON]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  JOHN MARTIN   W. J. LINTON]\r\n\r\nMR. W. J. LINTON has for many years had extensive practice both as a\r\ndraughtsman and an engraver on wood, and still continues to combine both\r\nprofessions. The specimens on the present page shew his early work; the\r\nfirst is after a drawing by John Martin from the series of Bible Prints\r\nbefore quoted; the second, a vignette after MCIAN, from the Book of\r\nBritish Ballads.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  R. R. MC IAN   W. J. LINTON]\r\n\r\nHis later work is beautifully exemplified on the opposite page by the\r\nsubject called Death’s Door, after a drawing by that remarkable man\r\nWILLIAM BLAKE, of whom some account will be found at p. 632. It was\r\npublished in the Art Union Volume of 1859, and is by the kindness of the\r\nCouncil of that Society inserted here.\r\n\r\nTo complete this page we annex two other of Mr. Linton’s late works.\r\nThey are taken from Milton’s L’Allegro, published by Low & Co.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  STONHOUSE   W. J. LINTON\r\n  “SHALLOW BROOKS AND RIVERS WIDE.”]\r\n\r\nMany of the illustrated books of the last twenty years exhibit the\r\ntalents of Mr. Linton. We may name, besides the Book of Ballads, The\r\nPictorial Tour of the Thames, The Merrie Days of England, 1859, Burns’\r\nPoems and Songs, Favourite English Poems, 1859, Shakspere’s Birthplace,\r\nand the Illustrated edition of Milton’s Poetical Works formerly\r\npublished by Kent & Co. and now in Bohn’s Illustrated Library.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  J. L. HORSLEY, A.R.A.   W. J. LINTON\r\n  “SUCH AS THE MELTING SOUL MAY PIERCE.”]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  F. W. FAIRHOLT]\r\n\r\nMR. F. W. FAIRHOLT is distinguished for his knowledge of Costume and\r\nMediæval art, which he has exemplified in a considerable number of\r\nshaded outlines, mostly drawn and engraved by himself. The\r\nwood-engraving at the head of this page is from the Archæological Album\r\npublished in 1845, under the auspices of the British Archæological\r\nAssociation, to whose journal Mr. Fairholt has contributed largely. Ten\r\nof the subjects in the Book of British Ballads, illustrative of the\r\nStory of Sir Andrew Barton, are designed by him and give a favourable\r\nspecimen of his drawing. They are cleverly engraved by T. Armstrong.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: F. W. FAIRHOLT]\r\n\r\nThe Vignette is from the illustrated edition of Robin Hood, edited by\r\nMr. J. M. Gutch in 1847. Mr. Fairholt has also edited and illustrated a\r\nvolume on the Costume of England; a History of Tobacco, published by\r\nMessrs. Chapman & Hall; and the Translation of Labarte’s Arts of the\r\nMiddle Ages, published by Mr. Murray.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  JOSEPH DINKEL   JAMES LEE\r\n  SHELL-LIMESTONE FROM THE MOUTH OF THE THAMES.\r\n  From Dr. Mantell’s Geological Work, Medals of Creation.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  JOSEPH DINKEL   JAMES LEE\r\n  MOSASAURUS HOFMANNI.\r\n  From Dr. Mantell’s Petrifactions and their Teachings.]\r\n\r\nMR. JOSEPH DINKEL is a very accurate draughtsman of subjects of Natural\r\nHistory, especially of Fossil remains; but though he has most practice\r\nin this department, he also undertakes Architectural and Engineering\r\ndrawings. The present specimens are skilfully engraved by MR. JAMES LEE.\r\nNearly all the drawings of the great work of Professor Agassiz,\r\n‘Poissons Fossiles,’ published at Neuchatel, from 1833 to 1843, were\r\nexecuted by Mr. Dinkel; and he drew almost exclusively for the late Dr.\r\nMantell. He is now much employed by Professor Owen; Thomas Bell, Esq.\r\nPresident of the Linnæan Society; and the Royal, Geological, and\r\nPalæontological Societies.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  E. H. WEHNERT   HORACE HARRAL\r\n  FROM COLERIDGE’S ANCIENT MARINER.]\r\n\r\nEDWARD H. WEHNERT, a member of the New Society of Painters in Water\r\nColours, frequently draws upon wood. He illustrated Coleridge’s Ancient\r\nMariner, Grimm’s Tales, Eve of St. Agnes, and contributed designs to\r\nBohn’s edition of Longfellow’s Poems and to many other popular works of\r\npoetry and fiction. His style is essentially German. He has recently\r\ncontributed thirty-four subjects to the Favourite English Poems and\r\ncompleted a number of drawings for Andersen’s Tales, the electrotypes of\r\nwhich are produced by a new process by Mr. W. J. Linton.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nGEORGE CRUIKSHANK is especially celebrated for the felicitous humour\r\nwhich he throws into every subject that comes under his pencil or burin.\r\nHis works are legion and all highly prized, but his designs on wood are\r\nmuch less numerous than his etchings on copper. Mr. Ruskin, in his\r\n‘Modern Painters,’ has lately expatiated as enthusiastically on the\r\nartistic merits of Mr. Cruikshank as he has done on those of Mr.\r\nCreswick, quoted by us in a previous page. He concludes by saying:\r\n“Taken all in all, the works of Cruikshank have the most sterling value\r\nof any belonging to this class produced in England.” The present\r\nexamples, taken from his ‘Three Courses and a Dessert,’ published in\r\nBohn’s Illustrated Library, will afford some idea of his peculiar\r\ntalent. On the following page we give examples of his early work, being\r\nillustrations contributed to the ‘Universal Songster,’ a once popular\r\nwork to which other artists including his late brother Robert\r\nCruikshank also contributed. The engraver, rather a coarse hand, was\r\nJ. R. Marshall.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  GEORGE CRUIKSHANK\r\n  THE OLD COMMODORE.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  GEORGE CRUIKSHANK\r\n  GILES SCROGGINS AND MOLLY BROWN.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  ALFRED CROWQUILL.\r\n  THE MAN WHO WISHED TO BE TALLER.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  ALFRED CROWQUILL.\r\n  THE WOMAN WHO WISHED TO BE YOUNGER.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  ALFRED CROWQUILL.\r\n  DRINKING IS A VICE THAT LOWERS A MAN.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  KENNY MEADOWS.]\r\n\r\nOur last page of illustrations is devoted to humour. Three of the\r\nsubjects are from the Pictorial Grammar, by ALFRED CROWQUILL (_i.e._\r\nA. Forester), the fourth, a design by KENNY MEADOWS (from the Book of\r\nBritish Ballads), one of his early productions, but unsurpassed by\r\nanything he has since done.\r\n\r\nThese artists have in former years illustrated a number of books. Among\r\nCrowquill’s may be named eight subjects to the Book of British Ballads.\r\nHis latest work is ‘The Adventures of Gooroo Simple and his Five\r\nDisciples.’\r\n\r\nAmong those by Kenny Meadows, we remember as his best an illustrated\r\nedition of Shakespeare, in three vols. royal 8vo. originally published\r\nby Mr. Tyas. London, 1843.\r\n\r\nThe Publisher here concludes his additional chapter; not for want of\r\nmaterial, for he has more than enough to fill another volume, but for\r\nwant of space. In endeavouring to give some indication of xylographic\r\nart-progress in England, he has made no attempt at completeness, and has\r\nsaid nothing whatever of foreign art, which has progressed quite as\r\nrapidly as our own. So much remains to be done in both domains, and so\r\nmany fine examples are either lying before him, or placed at his\r\ndisposal, which might advantageously have been adduced, that he\r\ncontemplates following the present volume, at no very distant period,\r\nwith one that shall supply what has now been necessarily omitted. Among\r\nthe many skilful Artists whose names have not yet been mentioned are the\r\nfollowing, arranged in three distinct alphabets. The first alphabet\r\ncomprises those who are professionally painters in oil, but occasionally\r\ndraw on wood; the second, those who make drawing on wood their leading\r\nprofession, although many of them also paint in oil; the third, those\r\nwho almost confine themselves to engraving the designs of others,\r\nalthough some of them are themselves good draughtsmen. One or more of\r\nthe books to which they have contributed, are indicated.\r\n\r\n_Painters who occasionally Draw on Wood._\r\n\r\nANDREWS, G.

It is from a want of\r\npractical knowledge that we have had so many absurd speculations\r\nrespecting the manner in which the old wood engravers executed their\r\ncross-hatchings, and so many _notions_ about vegetable putties and\r\nmetallic relief engraving. Even in a Memoir of Bewick, printed in 1836,\r\nwe find the following passage, which certainly would not have appeared\r\nhad the writer paid any attention to the numerous wood-cuts, containing\r\ncross-hatchings of the most delicate kind, published in England between\r\n1820 and 1834:--“The principal characteristic of the ancient masters is\r\nthe crossing of the black lines, to produce or deepen the shade,\r\ncommonly called _cross-hatching_. Whether this was done by employing\r\ndifferent blocks, one after another, as in calico-printing and\r\npaper-staining, _it may be difficult to say_; but to produce them on the\r\nsame block is so difficult and _unnatural_, that though Nesbit, one of\r\nBewick’s early pupils, attempted it on a few occasions, and the splendid\r\nprint of Dentatus by Harvey shows that it is not impossible even on a\r\nlarge scale, yet the waste of time and labour is scarcely worth the\r\neffect produced.”[IX-1] Now, the difficulty of saying whether the old\r\ncross-hatchings were executed on a single block, or produced by\r\nimpressions from two or more, proceeds entirely from the writer not\r\nbeing acquainted with the subject; had he known that hundreds of old\r\nblocks containing cross-hatchings are still in existence, and had he\r\nbeen in the habit of seeing similar cross-hatchings executed almost\r\ndaily by very indifferent wood engravers, the difficulty which he felt\r\nwould have vanished. “Unnatural” is certainly an improper term for a\r\n_philosopher_ to apply to a process of art, merely because he does not\r\nunderstand it: with equal reason he might have called every other\r\nprocess, both of copper-plate and wood engraving, “unnatural;” nay, in\r\nthis sense there is no process in arts or manufactures to which the term\r\n“unnatural” might not in the same manner be applied.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-1: Memoir of Thomas Bewick, by the Reverend William\r\n    Turner, prefixed to volume sixth of the Naturalist’s Library, page\r\n    18.]\r\n\r\nIn giving some account of the practice of wood engraving, it seems most\r\nproper to begin with the ground-work--the wood. As it is generally\r\nunderstood that box is best adapted for the purposes of engraving, and\r\nthat it is generally used for cuts intended for the illustration of\r\nbooks, there seems no occasion to enter into a detail of all the kinds\r\nof wood that might be used for the more ordinary purposes of large\r\ncoarse cuts for posting-bills, and others of a similar character. Mr.\r\nSavage, in his Hints on Decorative Printing, has copied the principal\r\npart of what Papillon has said on the subject of wood, intending that it\r\nshould be received as information from a practical wood engraver; but he\r\nhas omitted to notice that much of what Papillon says about the choice\r\nof wood, can be of little service in guiding the modern English wood\r\nengraver, who executes his subject on the cross-section of the wood,\r\nwhile Papillon and his contemporaries were accustomed to engrave upon\r\nthe side, or the _long-way_ of the wood. “There is no difficulty,” says\r\nPapillon, as translated by Mr. Savage, “in distinguishing that which is\r\ngood, as we have only need of taking a splinter of the box we wish to\r\ntry, and break it between the fingers; if it break short, without\r\nbending, it will not be of any value; whereas, if there be great\r\ndifficulty in breaking it, it is well adapted to our purpose.”\r\n\r\nNow, it is quite evident from this direction--independent of the fact\r\nbeing otherwise known--that the thin splinter by which the quality of\r\nthe wood was to be tested was to be cut the long way of the wood:\r\na similar cutting taken from the cross-section would break short,\r\nhowever excellent the wood might be for the purpose of engraving.\r\nPapillon’s direction is therefore calculated to mislead, unless\r\naccompanied with an explanation of the manner in which the splinter is\r\nto be taken; and it is also utterly useless as a test of box that is\r\nintended to be engraved on the cross-section, or end-way of the wood.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of engraving no other kind of wood hitherto tried is\r\nequal to box. For fine and small cuts the smallest logs are to be\r\npreferred, as the smallest wood is almost invariably the best. American\r\nand Turkey box is the largest; but all large wood of this kind is\r\ngenerally of inferior quality, and most liable to split; it is also\r\nfrequently of a red colour, which is a certain characteristic of its\r\nsoftness, and consequent unfitness for delicate engraving. From my own\r\nexperience, English box is superior to all others; for though small, it\r\nis generally so clear and firm in the grain that it never crumbles under\r\nthe graver; it resists evenly to the edge of the tool, and gives not a\r\nparticle beyond what is actually cut out. The large red wood, on the\r\ncontrary, besides being soft, is liable to crumble and to cut short;\r\nthat is, small particles will sometimes _break_ away from the sides of\r\nthe line cut by the graver, and thus cause imperfections in the work.\r\nBox of large and comparatively quick growth, is also extremely liable to\r\nshrink unevenly between the rings, so that after the surface has been\r\nplaned perfectly level, and engraved, it is frequently difficult to\r\nprint the cut in a proper manner, in consequence of the inequality of\r\nthe surface.\r\n\r\nAs even the largest logs of box are of comparatively small diameter, it\r\nis extremely difficult to obtain a perfect block of a single piece equal\r\nto the size of an octavo page. In order to obtain pieces as large as\r\npossible, some dealers are accustomed to saw the log in a slanting\r\ndirection--in the manner of an oblique section of a cylinder--so that\r\nthe surface of a piece cut off shall resemble an oval rather than a\r\ncircle. Blocks sawn in this manner ought never to be used; for, in\r\nconsequence of the obliquity of the grain, there is no preventing small\r\nparticles tearing out when cutting a line.\r\n\r\nLarge red wood containing _white spots_ or streaks is utterly unfit for\r\nthe purposes of the engraver; for in cutting a line across, adjacent to\r\nthese spots or streaks, sometimes the entire piece thus marked will be\r\nremoved, and the cut consequently spoiled. A clear yellow colour, and as\r\nequal as possible over the whole surface, is generally the best\r\ncriterion of box-wood. When a block is not of a clear yellow colour\r\nthroughout, but only in the centre, gradually becoming lighter towards\r\nthe edges, it ought not to be used for delicate work; the white, in\r\naddition to its not cutting so “sweetly,” being of a softer nature,\r\nabsorbs more ink than the yellow, and also retains it more tenaciously,\r\nso that impressions from a block of this kind sometimes display a\r\nperceptible inequality of colour;--from the yellow parts allowing the\r\nink to leave them freely, while the white parts partially retain it, the\r\nprinted cut has the appearance of having received either too much ink in\r\none place, or too little in another. Besides this, the ink remaining on\r\nthe white parts becomes so adhesive, that, should the sheet be rather\r\ntoo damp (as will frequently happen when much paper is wetted at one\r\ntime), it will sometimes stick to the paper; a small spot of white will\r\nhence appear in the impression, while a minute piece of paper will\r\nremain adhering to the block, to be mixed up with the ink on the balls,\r\nand transferred as a black speck to another part of the cut in a\r\nsubsequent impression. But this is not all: should the piece of paper\r\nremain unnoticed for some time it will make a small indention in the\r\nblock, and occasion a white or grey speck in the impressions printed\r\nafter its removal. Soft red and white box, more especially the latter,\r\nbeing more porous than clear yellow, blocks of those kinds of wood are\r\nmost liable to be injured by the liquids used to clean them after\r\nprinting. Should the printer wash them with either lees or spirits of\r\nturpentine, these fluids will enter the wood more freely than if it were\r\nyellow, and cause it to expand in proportion to the quantity used, and\r\nsometimes to such an extent as to distort the drawing. If a block of any\r\nkind of box, whether red, white, or yellow, be wetted or exposed to\r\ndampth, it will expand considerably;[IX-2] but with care it will return\r\nto its former dimensions, should it have been sufficiently seasoned\r\nbefore being printed. When, however, the expansion has been caused by\r\nlees or spirits of turpentine, the block will never again contract to\r\nits original size.[IX-3]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-2: The following is an instance of the effect of\r\n    dampth upon box-wood. I placed one evening a block, composed of\r\n    several pieces of box glued to a thick piece of mahogany, against\r\n    the wall of a rather damp room, and on examining it the next\r\n    morning I found that the box had expanded so much that the edges\r\n    projected beyond the mahogany upwards of the eighth of an inch.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-3: Some of the blocks engraved for the Penny\r\n    Magazine, measuring originally eight inches and a half by six\r\n    inches, have, after undergoing the process of stereotyping and the\r\n    subsequent washing, increased not less than two inches in their\r\n    perimeter or exterior lineal dimension, as has been proved by\r\n    comparing the measurement of a block in its present state with a\r\n    first proof taken on India paper, which paper, being dry when the\r\n    impression was taken, has not suffered any contraction.]\r\n\r\nAs publishers frequently provide the drawings which are to be engraved,\r\nperhaps a knowledge of the different qualities of box is as necessary to\r\nthem as to wood engravers themselves. In reply to this it may be said,\r\nwhy not require the engraver who is to execute the cuts to supply proper\r\nwood himself? Where only one engraver is employed to execute all the\r\ncuts for a work, the choice of the wood may indeed be very properly left\r\nto himself. But where several are employed, and each required to send\r\nhis own wood to the designer, very few are particular what kind they\r\nsend; for when the designer receives the different pieces he generally\r\nconsigns them to a drawer until wanted, and when he has finished a\r\ndesign, he not unfrequently sends it to an engraver who did not supply\r\nthe identical piece of wood on which it is drawn. Hence scarcely any\r\nengraver pays much attention to the kind of wood he sends; for where\r\nmany are employed in the execution of a series of cuts for the same\r\nwork, it is very unlikely that each will receive the drawings on the\r\nwood supplied by himself. Even when the designer is particular in making\r\nthe drawings of the subjects which he thinks best suited to each\r\nengraver’s talents on the wood which such engraver has supplied, it not\r\nunfrequently happens that the person who employs the engravers will not\r\ngive the blocks to those for whom the artist intended them. Publishers\r\nhave a much greater interest in this matter than they seem to suspect.\r\nIf soft wood be supplied, the finer lines will soon be bruised down in\r\nprinting, and the cut will appear like an old one before half the number\r\nof impressions required have been printed; if red-ringed, the surface is\r\nextremely liable to become uneven, and also to warp and split.\r\n\r\nAs box can seldom be obtained of more than five or six inches diameter,\r\nand as wood of this size is rarely sound throughout, blocks for cuts\r\nexceeding five inches square are usually formed of two or more pieces\r\nfirmly united by means of iron pins and screws. Should the block,\r\nhowever, be wetted or exposed to dampth, the joints are certain to open,\r\nand sometimes to such an extent as to require a piece of wood to be\r\ninserted in the aperture.[IX-4] Perhaps the best way to guard against a\r\nlarge block opening at the joining of the pieces would be to enclose it\r\nwith an iron hoop or frame; such hoop or frame being fixed when nearly\r\nred-hot in the same manner as a tire is applied to a coach or cart\r\nwheel. If the iron fit perfectly tight when forced on to the block in\r\nthe manner of a tire, it will be the more likely, by its contracting in\r\ncold and damp weather, to resist the expansive force of the wood at such\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-4: Sometimes a piece of metal--such as part of a thin\r\n    rule--is inserted in the chink by printers, when the part injured\r\n    is dark and the work not fine. Such a temporary remedy is sure to\r\n    increase the opening in a short time, and make the block worse.]\r\n\r\nBesides the hardness and toughness of box, which allows of clear raised\r\nlines, capable of bearing the action of the press, being cut on its\r\nsurface, this wood, from its not being subject to the attacks of the\r\nworm, has a great advantage over apple, pear-tree, beech,[IX-5] and\r\nother kinds of wood, formerly used for the purposes of engraving. Its\r\npreservation in this respect is probably owing to its poisonous nature,\r\nfor other kinds of wood of greater hardness and durability are\r\nfrequently pierced through and through by worms. The chips of box, when\r\nchewed, are certainly unwholesome to human beings. A fellow-pupil, who\r\nhad acquired a habit of chewing the small pieces which he cut out with\r\nhis graver, became unwell, and was frequently attacked with sickness. On\r\nmentioning the subject to his medical adviser, he was ordered to refrain\r\nfrom chewing the pieces of box; he accordingly took the doctor’s advice,\r\ngave up his bad habit, and in a short time recovered his usual\r\nhealth.[IX-6]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-5: One of the original blocks of Weever’s Funeral\r\n    Monuments, 1631, preserved in the Print Room of the British\r\n    Museum, is of beech.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-6: A few years ago I allowed a rabbit to have the run\r\n    of a small garden, where it soon eat up everything except a small\r\n    bush of box. Happening to leave home for two days without making\r\n    any provision for the rabbit, I found it in a dying state, and all\r\n    the leaves nibbled off the box. The rabbit died in the course of a\r\n    few hours, and on opening it the cause of its death was\r\n    apparent--the stomach was full of the leaves of the box.--See\r\n    Brand’s Popular Antiquities, vol. ii. page 265 (Bohn’s edit.), for\r\n    an account of yew poisoning two cows.]\r\n\r\nBox when kept long in a dry place becomes unfit for the purpose of\r\nengraving. I have at this time in my possession a drawing which has been\r\nmade on the block about ten years, but the wood has become so dry and\r\nbrittle that it would now be impossible to engrave the subject in a\r\nproper manner.\r\n\r\nWhen the wood does not cut clear, but crumbles as if it were too dry,\r\nthe defect may sometimes be remedied by putting the block into a deep\r\nearthenware jug or pan, and placing such jug or pan in a cool place for\r\nten or twelve hours. When the wood is too hard and dry to be softened in\r\nthe above manner, I would recommend that the back of the block should be\r\nplaced in water--in a plate or large dish--to the depth of the sixteenth\r\npart of an inch, for about an hour. If allowed to remain longer there is\r\na risk of the block afterwards splitting.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nBox, of whatever kind, when not well seasoned, is extremely liable to\r\nwarp and bend; but a little care will frequently prevent many of the\r\naccidents to which drawings on unseasoned wood are exposed by neglect.\r\nFor instance, when a block is received by the engraver from the designer\r\nor publisher, it ought, if not directly put in hand, to be placed on one\r\nof its edges, and not, as is customary with many, laid down flat, with\r\nthe surface on which the drawing is made upwards. If a block of\r\nunseasoned wood be permitted to lie in this manner for a week or two, it\r\nis almost certain to turn up at the edges, the upper surface becoming\r\nconcave, and the lower convex, as is shown in the annexed cut,\r\nrepresenting the section of such a block.\r\n\r\nThe same thing will occur in the process of engraving, though to a small\r\nextent, should the engraver’s hands be warm and moist; and also when\r\nworking by lamp-light without a globe filled with water between the lamp\r\nand the block. Such slight warping in the course of engraving is,\r\nhowever, easily remedied by laying the block with its face--that is, the\r\nsurface on which the drawing is made--downward on the desk or table at\r\nall times when the engraver is not actually employed on the subject. The\r\nblock so placed, provided that it be not of very dry wood, in a short\r\ntime recovers its former level. When a block of very dry wood becomes\r\n_dished_, or concave, on its upper surface, as shown in the preceding\r\ncut, there is little chance of its ever again becoming sufficiently flat\r\nto allow of its being well printed. When the deviation from a perfect\r\nlevel at the bottom is not so great as to attract the notice of the\r\npressman previous to taking an impression, the block not unfrequently\r\nyields to the action of the platten, and splits. The fracture remains\r\nperhaps unobserved for a short time, and when it is at length noticed,\r\nthe block is probably spoiled beyond remedy.\r\n\r\nWhen box is very dry it is extremely difficult to cut a clear line upon\r\nit, as it crumbles, and small pieces fly out at the sides of the line\r\ntraced by the graver. The small white spots so frequently seen in the\r\ndelicate lines of the sky in wood-cuts are occasioned by particles\r\nflying out in this manner. If a block consist partly of yellow wood and\r\npartly of wood with red rings, the yellow will cut clear, while in the\r\nred it will be almost impossible to cut a perfect line. When the same\r\npiece of wood is yellow and red alternately it is extremely difficult to\r\nproduce an even _tint_ upon it. Wood of this kind ought always to be\r\nrejected, both from the difficulty of engraving upon it with clearness,\r\nand from the uncertainty of the surface continuing perfectly flat, as\r\nthe red rings are more liable to shrink in drying than the other parts,\r\nand, from their thus not receiving a sufficient quantity of ink, to\r\nappear like so many rainbows in the impression.\r\n\r\nThe spaces between those rings are greater or less, accordingly as the\r\nseasons have been favourable or unfavourable to the growth of the tree.\r\nBesides the injurious effect which those red rings are apt to produce in\r\nan impression, wood of this kind is very unpleasant and uncertain to\r\nengrave on; for as the yellow parts cut pleasant and clear, the\r\nengraver, unless particularly on his guard, is betrayed to trust to the\r\nwhole piece as being of the same uniform tenacity, and before he is\r\naware of its inequality in this respect, or can check the progress of\r\nhis graver, its point has entered one of those soft red rings, and, to\r\nthe injury of his work, has either caused a small piece to fly out, or\r\ncarried the line further than he intended. Wood of this kind is unfit\r\nfor anything except very common work, and ought never to be used for\r\ndelicate engraving. There is no certain means of forming a judgment of\r\nbox-wood until it be cut into slices or trencher-like pieces from the\r\nlog; for many logs which externally appear sound and of a good colour,\r\nprove very faulty and cracked in the centre when sawn up. Turkey box is\r\nin particular so defective in this respect that a large slice can seldom\r\nbe procured without a crack. This, probably, is occasioned by the manner\r\nin which the tree is felled. Previous to their beginning to cut down a\r\ntree the Turkish wood-cutters fasten a rope to the top, by means of\r\nwhich they break the tree down when the bole is little more than half\r\ncut through. The consequence is that a _shiver_ frequently extends\r\nthrough the most valuable portion of the log.\r\n\r\nMany artists, who are not accustomed to make drawings on wood,\r\nerroneously suppose that the block requires some peculiar preparation.\r\nNothing more is required than to rub the previously planed and smoothed\r\nsurface with a little powdered Bath-brick, slightly mixed with water: as\r\nlittle water as possible is, however, to be used, as otherwise the block\r\nwill absorb too much, and be afterwards extremely liable to split. When\r\nthis thin coating is perfectly dry, it is to be removed by rubbing the\r\nblock with the palm of the hand. No part of the light powder ought to\r\nremain, for, otherwise, the pencil coming in contact with it will make a\r\ncoarse and comparatively thick line, which, besides being a blemish in\r\nthe drawing, is very liable to be rubbed off. The object of using the\r\npowdered Bath-brick is to render the surface less slippery, and thus\r\ncapable of affording a better _hold_ to the point of the black-lead\r\npencil.\r\n\r\nWhen the principal parts of the drawing are first washed in upon the\r\nblock in Indian ink, it is of great advantage to gently rub the surface\r\nof the block, when dry, with a little dry and finely powdered\r\nBath-brick, before the drawing is completed with the black-lead pencil.\r\nBy this means the hard edges of the Indian-ink wash will be softened,\r\nthe different tints delicately blended, and the subsequent touches of\r\nthe pencil be more distinctly seen. Some artists, previous to beginning\r\nto draw on the block, are in the habit of washing over the surface with\r\na mixture of flake-white and gum-water.[IX-7] This practice is, however,\r\nby no means a good one. The drawing indeed may appear very bright and\r\nshowy when first made on such a white surface, but in the progress of\r\nengraving a thin film of the preparation will occasionally rise up\r\nbefore the graver and carry with it a portion of the unengraved work,\r\nwhich the engraver is left to restore according to his ability and\r\nrecollection. This white ground also mixes with the ink in taking a\r\nfirst proof, and fills up the finer parts of the cut. If a white wash be\r\nused without gum, the drawing is very liable to be partially effaced in\r\nthe progress of engraving, and the engraver left to finish his work as\r\nhe can. The risk of this inconvenience ought to be especially avoided in\r\nmaking drawings on a block, as the wood engraver has not the opportunity\r\nof referring to another drawing or to an original painting in the manner\r\nof an engraver on copper.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-7: Instead of gum-water, French artists, who are\r\n    accustomed to make drawings on wood, use water in which parchment\r\n    shavings have been boiled.]\r\n\r\nThe less that is done to change the original colour of the wood--by\r\nwhite or any other preparation--so much the better for the engraver;\r\na piece of clear box is sufficiently light to allow of the most delicate\r\nlines being distinctly drawn upon it. When the surface of the block is\r\nwhitened, another inconvenience arises besides those already noticed. It\r\nis this: when the drawing is made upon a white ground, and the subject\r\npartially engraved, the effect of the whole becomes very confused and\r\nperplexing to the engraver in consequence of the parts already engraved\r\nappearing nearly of the original colour of the wood, while the ground of\r\nthe parts not yet cut is white, as first drawn. The engraver’s eye\r\ncannot correctly judge of the whole, and the inconvenience is increased\r\nby his neither having an original drawing to refer to, nor a proof to\r\nguide him: until the cut be completed he has no means of correctly\r\nascertaining whether he has left too much _colour_ or taken too much\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe engraver on copper or on steel can have an impression of his etching\r\nas soon as it is _bit_ in, and can take impressions of the plate at all\r\ntimes in the course of his progress; the wood engraver, on the contrary,\r\nenjoys no such advantages; he is obliged to wait until all be completed\r\nere he can obtain an impression of his work. If the wood engraver has\r\nkept his subject generally too dark, there is not much difficulty in\r\nreducing it; but if he has engraved it too light, there is no remedy. If\r\na small part be badly engraved, or the block has sustained an injury,\r\nthe defect may be repaired by inserting a small piece of wood and\r\nre-engraving it: this mode of repairing a block is technically termed\r\n“_plugging_.”[IX-8]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-8: This mode of repairing a block was practised by\r\n    the German wood engravers of the time of Albert Durer. The “plug”\r\n    which they inserted was usually square, and not circular as at\r\n    present. The French wood engravers of the time of Papillon\r\n    continued to employ square plugs. There are two or three instances\r\n    of cuts thus repaired, in the Adventures of Sir Theurdank,\r\n    Nuremberg and Augsburg, 1517-1519.]\r\n\r\nWhen a block requires to be thus amended or repaired, it is first to be\r\ndetermined how much is necessary to be taken out that the restoration\r\nmay accord with the adjacent parts; for sometimes, in order to render\r\nthe insertion less perceptible, it may be requisite to take out rather\r\nmore than the part imactually perfect or injured. This being decided on,\r\na hole is drilled in the block, as is represented in the next page, of a\r\nsize sufficient to admit “the _plug_.” The hole ought not to be drilled\r\nquite through the block, as the piece let in would, from the shaking and\r\nbattering of the press, be very likely to become loosened. Should it\r\nreceive more pressure at the top than bottom, it would sink a little\r\nbelow the engraved surface of the block, and thus appear lighter in the\r\nimpression than the surrounding parts; while should it be slightly\r\nforced up from below it, would appear darker,--in each case forming a\r\npositive blemish in the cut.[IX-9] When the shape of the part to be\r\nrestored is too large to be covered with one circular plug, it is better\r\nto add one plug to another till the whole be covered, than to insert one\r\nof a different shape, and thus fill the space at once. When a single\r\nplug is used the section appears thus; the plug being driven in like a\r\nwedge, and having a vacant space around it at the bottom. If an oblong\r\nspace of the form No. 1. is to be restored, it will be best effected by\r\nfirst inserting a plug at each end, as at No. 2, then adding two others,\r\nas at No. 3, and finally wedging them all fast by a central plug, as at\r\nNo. 4, like the key-stone in an arch. When a plug is firmly fixed, the\r\ntop is carefully cut down to the level of the block, and the part of the\r\nsubject wanting re-drawn and engraved. When these operations are well\r\nperformed no trace of the insertion can be discovered, except by one who\r\nshould know where to look for it.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-9: In a tail-piece at page 52 of Bewick’s Fables,\r\n    edition 1823, a plug which has been inserted appears lighter than\r\n    the adjacent parts, in consequence of its having sunk a little\r\n    below the surface; and in the cut to the fable of the Hart and the\r\n    Vine, in the same work, two large plugs, at the top, are darker\r\n    than the other parts in consequence of their having risen a little\r\n    above the surface.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE PLUG OUT.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 1.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 2.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 3.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 4.]\r\n\r\nWhen a cast is taken from a block which requires the insertion of a\r\nplug, the best mode is to have the part intended to be renewed cast\r\nblank. In this case a hole of sufficient size is to be drilled in the\r\nblock, and afterwards filled up with plaster to the level of the\r\nsurface. A cast being then taken, the part to be re-engraved remains\r\nblank, but of a piece with the rest of the metal, so that there is no\r\npossibility of its rising up above or sinking below the surface, as\r\nsometimes happens when a plug is inserted in a wood-block. When the part\r\nremaining blank in the cast is engraved in accordance with the work of\r\nthe surrounding parts, it is almost impossible to discover any trace of\r\nthe insertion. The following impression is from a cast of the block\r\nillustrating the “plug,” with the part which appears white in the former\r\ncut restored and re-engraved in this manner. A white circular line, near\r\nthe handle of the pail, has been purposely cut to indicate the place of\r\nthe plug.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nBefore beginning to engrave any subject, it is necessary to observe\r\nwhether the drawing be entirely, or only in part, made with a pencil. If\r\nit be what is usually called a _wash_ drawing, with little more than the\r\noutlines in pencil, it is not necessary to be so cautious in defending\r\nit from the action of the breath or the occasional touching of the hand;\r\nbut if it be entirely in pencil, too much care cannot be taken to\r\nprotect it from both.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to engrave a delicate pencil drawing the block ought\r\nto be covered with paper, with the exception of the part on which it is\r\nintended to begin. Soft paper ought not to be used for this purpose, as\r\nsuch is most likely to partially efface the drawing when the hand is\r\npressed upon the block. Moderately stout post-paper with a glazed\r\nsurface is the best; though some engravers, in order to preserve their\r\neyes, which become affected by white paper, cover the block with blue\r\npaper, which is usually too soft, and thus expose the drawing to injury.\r\nThe dingy, grey, and over-done appearance of several modern wood-cuts is\r\ndoubtless owing, in a great measure, to the block when in course of\r\nengraving having been covered with soft paper, which has partially\r\neffaced the drawing. The drawing, which originally may have been clear\r\nand _touchy_, loses its brightness, and becomes indistinct from its\r\nfrequent contact with the soft pliable paper; the spirited dark touches\r\nwhich give it effect are rubbed down to a sober grey, and all the other\r\nparts, from the same cause, are comparatively weak. The cut, being\r\nengraved according to the appearance of the drawing, is tame, flat, and\r\nspiritless.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nDifferent engravers have different methods of fastening the paper to the\r\nblock.[IX-10] Some fix it with gum, or with wafers at the sides; but\r\nthis is not a good mode, for as often as it is necessary to take a view\r\nof the whole block, in order to judge of the progress of the work, the\r\npaper must be torn off, and afterwards replaced by means of new wafers\r\nor fresh gum, so that before the cut is finished the sides of the block\r\nare covered with bits of paper in the manner of a wall or shop-front\r\ncovered with fragments of posting-bills. The most convenient mode of\r\nfastening the paper is to first wrap a piece of stiff and stout thread\r\nthree or four times round the edges of the block, and then after making\r\nthe end fast to remove it. The paper is then to be closely fitted to the\r\nblock, and the edges being brought over the sides, the thread is to be\r\nre-placed above it. If the turns of the thread be too tight to pass over\r\nthe last corner of the block, A, a piece of string, B, being passed\r\nwithin them and firmly pulled, in the manner here represented, will\r\ncause them to stretch a little and pass over on to the edge without\r\ndifficulty. When this plan is adopted the paper forms a kind of moveable\r\ncap, which can be taken off at pleasure to view the progress of the\r\nwork, and replaced without the least trouble.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-10: French wood engravers are accustomed to rub the\r\n    sides of the block with bees’-wax, which on being chafed with the\r\n    thumb-nail becomes slightly softened, and thus adheres to the\r\n    paper.]\r\n\r\nI have long been of opinion that many young persons, when beginning to\r\nlearn the art of wood engraving, have injured their sight by\r\nunnecessarily using a magnifying glass. At the very commencement of\r\ntheir pupilage boys will furnish themselves with a glass of this kind,\r\nas if it were as much a matter of course as a set of gravers; they\r\nsometimes see men use a glass, and as at this period they are prone to\r\nape their elders in the profession, _they_ must have one also; and as\r\nthey generally choose such as magnify most, the result not unfrequently\r\nis that their sight is considerably impaired before they are capable of\r\nexecuting anything that really requires much nicety of vision.\r\n\r\nI would recommend all persons to avoid the use of glasses of any kind,\r\nwhether single magnifiers or spectacles, until impaired sight renders\r\nsuch aids necessary; and even then to commence with such as are of small\r\nmagnifying power. The habit of viewing minute objects alternately with a\r\nmagnifying glass and the naked eye--applying the glass every two or\r\nthree minutes--is, I am satisfied, injurious to the sight. The\r\nmagnifying glass used by wood engravers is similar to that used by\r\nwatch-makers, and consists of a single lens, fitted into a short tube,\r\nwhich is rather wider at the end applied to the eye. As the glass seldom\r\ncan be fixed so firmly to the eye as to entirely dispense with holding\r\nit, the engraver is thus frequently obliged to apply his left hand to\r\nkeep it in its place; as he cannot hold the block with the same hand at\r\nthe same time, or move it as may be required, so as to enable him to\r\nexecute his work with freedom, the consequence is, that the engraving of\r\na person who is in the habit of using a magnifying glass has frequently\r\na cramped appearance. There are also other disadvantages attendant on\r\nthe habitual use of a magnifying glass. A person using such a glass must\r\nnecessarily hold his head aside, so that the eye on which the glass is\r\nfixed may be directly above the part on which he is at work. In order to\r\nattain this position, the eye itself is not unfrequently distorted; and\r\nwhen it is kept so for any length of time it becomes extremely painful.\r\nI never find my eyes so free from pain or aching as when looking at the\r\nwork directly in front, without any twisting of the neck so as to bring\r\none eye only immediately above the part in course of execution.\r\nI therefore conclude that the eyes are less likely to be injured when\r\nthus employed than when one is frequently distorted and pained in\r\nlooking through a glass. I am here merely speaking from experience, and\r\nnot professedly from any theoretic knowledge of optics; but as I have\r\nhitherto done without the aid of any magnifying power, I am not without\r\nreason convinced that glasses of all kinds ought to be dispensed with\r\nuntil impaired vision renders their use absolutely necessary. I am\r\ndecidedly of opinion that to use glasses _to preserve_ the sight, is to\r\nmeet half way the evil which is thus sought to be averted. A person who\r\nhas his sense of hearing perfect never thinks of using a trumpet or\r\nacoustic instrument in order to preserve it. All wood engravers, whether\r\ntheir eyes be naturally weak or not, ought to wear a shade, similar to\r\nthat represented in the following figure, No. 1, as it both protects the\r\neyes from too strong a light, and also serves to concentrate the view on\r\nthe work which the engraver is at the time engaged in executing.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 1.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 2.]\r\n\r\nWhen speaking on this subject, it may not be out of place to mention a\r\nkind of shade or screen for the nose and mouth, similar to that in the\r\npreceding figure, No. 2. Such a shade or screen is called by Papillon a\r\n_mentonnière_,[IX-11] and its object is to prevent the drawing on the\r\nblock being injured by the breath in damp or frosty weather. Without\r\nsuch a precaution, a drawing made on the block with black-lead pencil\r\nwould, in a great measure, be effaced by the breath of the engraver\r\npassing freely over it in such weather. Such a shade or screen is most\r\nconveniently made of a piece of thin pasteboard or stiff paper.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-11: Papillon’s description of a _mentonnière_ is\r\n    previously noticed at page 465.]\r\n\r\nThere are various modes of protecting the eyes when working by\r\nlamp-light, but I am aware of only one which both protects the eyes from\r\nthe light and the face from the heat of the lamp. This consists in\r\nfilling a large transparent glass-globe with clear water, and placing it\r\nin such a manner between the lamp and the workman that the light, after\r\npassing through the globe, may fall directly on the block, in the manner\r\nrepresented in the following cut. The height of the lamp can be\r\nregulated according to the engraver’s convenience, in consequence of its\r\nbeing moveable on the upright piece of iron or other metal which forms\r\nits support. The dotted line shows the direction of the light when the\r\nlamp is elevated to the height here seen; by lowering the lamp a little\r\nmore, the dotted line would incline more to a horizontal direction, and\r\nenable the engraver to sit at a greater distance. By the use of those\r\nglobes one lamp will suffice for three or four persons, and each person\r\nhave a much clearer and cooler light than if he had a lamp without a\r\nglobe solely to himself.[IX-12]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-12: Papillon preferred a kind of bull’s-eye\r\n    lens--_loupe_--of about three and a half inches diameter, flat on\r\n    one side and convex on the other, to a globe filled with\r\n    water--_un bocal_--for the purpose of bringing the light of the\r\n    lamp to a focus. This bull’s-eye he had enclosed in a kind of\r\n    frame, which could be inclined to any angle, or turned in any\r\n    direction by means of a ball-and-socket joint. He gives a cut of\r\n    it at page 75, vol. ii. of his Traité de la Gravure en Bois.--I\r\n    have tried the bull’s-eye lens, but though the light was equally\r\n    good as that from the globe, I found that the heat affected the\r\n    head in a most unpleasant manner.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SANDBAG AND BLOCK. GLOBE. LAMP.]\r\n\r\nIt has been said, and with some appearance of truth, that “the best\r\nengravers use the fewest tools;” but this, like many other sayings of a\r\nsimilar kind, does not generally hold good. He undoubtedly ought to be\r\nconsidered the best engraver who executes his work in the _best manner_\r\nwith the fewest tools; while it is no less certain that he is a bad\r\nengraver who executes his work badly, whether he use many or few. No\r\nwood engraver who understands his art will incumber his desk or table\r\nwith a number of useless tools, though, from a regard to his own time,\r\nhe will take care that he has as many as are necessary. There are some\r\nwho pride themselves upon executing a great variety of work with one\r\ntool, and hence, firmly believing in the truth of the saying above\r\nquoted, fancy that they are first-rate engravers. Such would be better\r\nentitled to the name if they executed their work well. A person who\r\nmakes his tools his _hobby-horse_, and who bestows upon their\r\nornaments--ebony or ivory handles, silver hoops, &c.--that attention\r\nwhich ought rather to be devoted to his subject, rarely excels as an\r\nengraver. He who is vain of the beautiful appearance of his tools has\r\nnot often just reason to be proud of his work.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere are only four kinds of cutting tools[IX-13] necessary in wood\r\nengraving, namely:--gravers; tint-tools; gouges or scoopers; and flat\r\ntools or chisels. Of each of these four kinds there are various sizes.\r\nThe following cut shows the form of a graver that is principally used\r\nfor outlining or separating one figure from another. A, is the back of\r\nthe tool; B, the face; C, the point; and D, what is technically called\r\nthe belly. The horizontal dotted line, 1, 2, shows the surface of the\r\nblock, and the manner in which part of the handle is cut off after the\r\nblade is inserted.[IX-14] This tool is very fine at the point, as the\r\nline which it cuts ought to be so thin as not to be distinctly\r\nperceptible when the cut is printed, as the intention is merely to form\r\na termination or boundary to a series of lines running in another\r\ndirection. Though it is necessary that the point should be very fine,\r\nyet the blade ought not to be too thin, for then, instead of cutting out\r\na piece of the wood, the tool will merely make a delicate opening, which\r\nwould be likely to close as soon as the block should be exposed to the\r\naction of the press. When the outline tool becomes too thin at the point\r\nthe lower part should be rubbed on a hone, in order to reduce the\r\nextreme fineness.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-13: A sharp-edged scraper, in shape something like a\r\n    copper-plate engraver’s burnisher, is used in the process of\r\n    _lowering_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-14: The handle, when received from the turner’s, is\r\n    perfectly circular at the rounded end; but after the blade is\r\n    inserted, a segment is cut off at the lower part, as seen in the\r\n    above cut.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nAbout eight or nine gravers of different sizes, beginning from the\r\noutline tool, are generally sufficient. The blades differ little in\r\nshape, when first made, from those used by copper-plate engravers; but\r\nin order to render them fit for the purpose of wood engraving, it is\r\nnecessary to give the points their peculiar form by rubbing them on a\r\nTurkey stone. In this cut are shown the faces and part of the backs of\r\nnine gravers of different sizes; the lower dotted line, A C, shows the\r\nextent to which the points of such tools are sometimes ground down by\r\nthe engraver in order to render them broader. When thus ground down the\r\npoints are slightly rounded, and do not remain straight as if cut off by\r\nthe dotted line A C. These tools are used for nearly all kinds of work,\r\nexcept for series of parallel lines, technically called “tints.” The\r\nwidth of the line cut out, according to the thickness of the graver\r\ntowards the point, is regulated by the pressure of the engraver’s hand.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: TINT-TOOL. GRAVER.]\r\n\r\nTint-tools are chiefly used to cut parallel lines forming an even and\r\nuniform _tint_, such as is usually seen in the representation of a clear\r\nsky in wood-cuts. They are thinner at the back, but deeper in the side\r\nthan gravers, and the angle of the face, at the point, is much more\r\nacute. About seven or eight, of different degrees of fineness, are\r\ngenerally sufficient. The following cut will afford an idea of the shape\r\nof the blades towards the point. The handle of the tint-tool is of the\r\nsame form as that of a graver. The figure marked A presents a side view\r\nof the blade; the others marked B show the faces. Some engravers never\r\nuse a tint-tool, but cut all their lines with a graver. There is,\r\nhowever, great uncertainty in cutting a series of parallel lines in this\r\nmanner, as the least inclination of the hand to one side will cause the\r\ngraver to increase the width of the white line _cut out_, and undercut\r\nthe raised one _left_, more than if in the same circumstances a\r\ntint-tool were used. This will be rendered more evident by a comparison\r\nof the points and faces of the two different tools: The tint-tool, being\r\nvery little thicker at B than at the point A, will cause a very trifling\r\ndifference in the width of a line in the event of a wrong inclination,\r\nwhen compared with the inequality occasioned by the unsteady direction\r\nof a graver, whose angle at the point is much greater than that of a\r\nproper tint-tool. Tint-tools ought to be sufficiently strong at the back\r\nto prevent their bending in the middle of the blade when used, for with\r\na weak tool of this kind the engraver cannot properly guide the point,\r\nand hence freedom of execution is lost. Tint-tools that are rather thick\r\nin the back are to be preferred to such as are thin, not only from their\r\nallowing of great steadiness in cutting, but from their leaving the\r\nraised lines thicker at the bottom, and consequently more capable of\r\nsustaining the action of the press. A tint-tool that is of the same\r\nthickness, both at the back and the lower part, cuts out the lines in\r\nsuch manner that a section of them appears thus: the black or raised\r\nlines from which the impression is obtained being no thicker at their\r\nbase than at the surface; while a section of the lines cut by a tool\r\nthat is thicker at the back than at the lower part appears thus. It is\r\nevident that lines of this kind, having a better support at the base,\r\nare much less liable than the former to be broken in printing. Gouges of\r\ndifferent sizes, from A the smallest to B the largest, as here\r\nrepresented, are used for scooping out the wood towards the centre of\r\nthe block; while flat tools or chisels, of various sizes, are chiefly\r\nemployed in cutting away the wood towards the edges. Flat tools of the\r\nshape seen in figure C are sometimes offered for sale by tool-makers,\r\nbut they ought never to be used; for the projecting corners are very apt\r\nto cut _under_ a line, and thus remove it entirely, causing great\r\ntrouble to replace it by inserting new pieces of wood.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: GOUGES.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CHISELS.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: C]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe face of both gravers and tint-tools ought to be kept rather long\r\nthan short; though if the point be ground _too fine_, it will be very\r\nliable to break. When the face is long--or, strictly speaking, when the\r\nangle, formed by the plane of the face and the lower line of the blade,\r\nis comparatively acute--thus, a line is cut with much greater clearness\r\nthan when the face is comparatively obtuse, and the small shaving cut\r\nout turns gently over towards the hand. When, however, the face of the\r\ntool approaches to the shape seen in the following cut, the reverse\r\nhappens; the small shaving is rather ploughed out than cleanly cut out;\r\nand the force necessary to push the tool forward frequently causes small\r\npieces to fly out at each side of the hollowed line, more especially if\r\nthe wood be dry. The shaving also, instead of turning aside over the\r\nface of the tool, turns over before the point, thus, and hinders the\r\nengraver from seeing that part of the pencilled line which is directly\r\nunder it. A short-faced tool of itself prevents the engraver from\r\ndistinctly seeing the point. When the face of a tool has become obtuse,\r\nit ought to be ground to a proper form, for instance, from the shape of\r\nthe figure A to that of B.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nGravers and tint-tools when first received from the maker are generally\r\ntoo hard,--a defect which is soon discovered by the point breaking off\r\nshort as soon as it enters the wood. To remedy this, the blade of the\r\ntool ought to be placed with its flat side above a piece of iron--a\r\npoker will do very well--nearly red-hot. Directly it changes to a straw\r\ncolour it is to be taken off the iron, and either dipped in sweet oil or\r\nallowed to cool gradually. If removed from the iron while it is still of\r\na straw colour, it will have been softened no more than sufficient; but\r\nshould it have acquired a purple tinge, it will have been softened too\r\nmuch; and instead of breaking at the point, as before, it will bend.\r\nA small grindstone is of great service in grinding down the faces of\r\ntools that have become obtuse. A Turkey stone, though the operation\r\nrequires more time, is however a very good substitute, as, besides\r\nreducing the face, the tool receives a point at the same time. Though\r\nsome engravers use only a Turkey stone for sharpening their tools, yet a\r\nhone in addition is of great advantage. A graver that has received a\r\nfinal polish on a hone cuts a clearer line than one which has only been\r\nsharpened on a Turkey stone; it also cuts more pleasantly, gliding\r\nsmoothly through the wood, if it be of good quality, without stirring a\r\nparticle on each side of the line.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe gravers and tint-tools used for engraving on a plane surface are\r\nstraight at the point, as is here represented; but for engraving on a\r\nblock rendered concave in certain parts by lowering, it is necessary\r\nthat the point should have a slight inclination upwards, thus. The\r\ndotted lines show the direction of the point used for plane surface\r\nengraving. There is no difficulty in getting a tool to _descend_ on one\r\nside of a part hollowed out or lowered; but unless the point be slightly\r\ninclined upwards, as is here shown, it is extremely difficult to make it\r\n_ascend_ on the side opposite, without getting _too much hold_, and thus\r\nproducing a wider white line than was intended.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs the proper manner of holding the graver is one of the first things\r\nthat a young wood engraver is taught, it is necessary to say a few words\r\non this subject. Engravers on copper and steel, who have much harder\r\nsubstances than wood to cut, hold the graver with the fore-finger\r\nextending on the blade beyond the thumb, thus, so that by its pressure\r\nthe point may be pressed into the plate. As box-wood, however, is much\r\nsofter than copper or steel, and as it is seldom of perfectly equal\r\nhardness throughout, it is necessary to hold the graver in a different\r\nmanner, and employ the thumb at once as a stay or rest for the blade,\r\nand as a check upon the force exerted by the palm of the hand, the\r\nmotion being chiefly directed by the fore-finger, as is shown in the\r\nfollowing cut.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe thumb, with the end resting against the side of the block, in the\r\nmanner above represented, allows the blade to move back and forward with\r\na slight degree of pressure against it, and in case of a slip it is ever\r\nready to check the graver’s progress. This mode of resting the thumb\r\nagainst the edge of the block is, however, only applicable when the cuts\r\nare so small as to allow of the graver, when thus guided and controlled,\r\nto reach every part of the subject. When the cut is too large to admit\r\nof this, the thumb then rests upon the surface of the block, thus:\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nstill forming a stay to the blade of the graver, and a check to its\r\nslips, as before.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 1.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 2.]\r\n\r\nIn order to acquire steadiness of hand, the best thing for a pupil to\r\nbegin with is the cutting of tints,--that is, parallel lines; and the\r\nfirst attempts ought to be made on a small block such as is represented\r\nin No. 1, which will allow each entire line to be cut with the thumb\r\nresting against the edge. When lines of this length can be cut with\r\ntolerable precision, the pupil should proceed to blocks of the size of\r\nNo. 2. He ought also to cut waved tints, which are not so difficult;\r\nbeginning, as in straight ones, with a small block, and gradually\r\nproceeding to blocks of greater size. Should the wood not cut smoothly\r\nin the direction in which he has begun, he should reverse the block, and\r\ncut his lines in the opposite direction; for it not unfrequently happens\r\nthat wood which cuts short and crumbles in one direction will cut clean\r\nand smooth the opposite way. It is here necessary to observe, that if a\r\ncertain number of lines be cut in one direction, and another portion, by\r\nreversing the block, be cut the contrary way, the tint, although the\r\nsame tool may have been used for all, will be of two different shades,\r\nnotwithstanding the pains that may have been taken to keep the lines of\r\nan even thickness throughout. This difference in the appearance of the\r\ntwo portions of lines cut from opposite sides is entirely owing to the\r\nwood cutting more smoothly in one direction than another, although the\r\ndifference in the resistance which it makes to the tool may not be\r\nperceptible by the hand of the engraver. It is of great importance that\r\na pupil should be able to cut tints well before he proceeds to any other\r\nkind of work. The practice will give him steadiness of hand, and he will\r\nthus acquire a habit of carefully executing such lines, which\r\nsubsequently will be of the greatest service. Wood engravers who have\r\nnot been well schooled in this elementary part of their profession often\r\ncut their tints carelessly in the first instance, and, when they\r\nperceive the defect in a proof, return to their work; and, with great\r\nloss of time, keep thinning and dressing the lines, till they frequently\r\nmake the tint appear worse than at first.\r\n\r\nWhen uniform tints, both of straight and waved lines, can be cut with\r\nfacility, the learner should proceed to cut tints in which the lines are\r\nof unequal distance apart. To effect this, tools of different sizes are\r\nnecessary; for in tints of this kind the different distances between the\r\nblack lines, are according to the width of the different tools used to\r\ncut them; though in tints of a graduated tone of colour, the difference\r\nis sometimes entirely produced by increasing the pressure of the graver.\r\nIn the annexed cut, No. 3, the black lines are of equal thickness, but\r\nthe width of the white lines between them becomes gradually less from\r\nthe top to the bottom. By comparing it with No. 4, the difference\r\nbetween a uniform tint, where the lines are of the same thickness and\r\nequally distant, and one where the distance between the lines is\r\nunequal, will be more readily understood.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 3.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 4.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 5.]\r\n\r\nA straight-line tint, either uniform, or with the lines becoming\r\ngradually closer without appearing darker, is generally adopted to\r\nrepresent a clear blue sky. In No. 3 the tint has been commenced with a\r\ncomparatively broad-pointed tool; and after cutting a few lines, less\r\npressure, thus allowing the black lines to come a little closer\r\ntogether, has been used, till it became necessary to change the tool for\r\none less broad in the face. In this manner a succession of tools, each\r\nfiner than the preceding, has been employed till the tint was\r\ncompleted.--To be able to produce a tint of delicately graduated _tone_,\r\nit is necessary that the engraver should be well acquainted with the use\r\nof his tools, and also have a correct eye. The following is a specimen\r\nof a tint cut entirely with the same _graver_, the difference in the\r\ncolour being produced by increasing the pressure in the lighter parts.\r\nTints of this kind are obtained with greater facility and certainty by\r\nusing a graver, and increasing the pressure, than by using several\r\ntint-tools. On comparing No. 3 with No. 5, it will be perceived that the\r\nblack lines in the latter decrease in thickness as they approach the\r\nbottom of the cut, while in the former they are of a uniform thickness\r\nthroughout. If a clear sky is to be represented, there is no other mode\r\nof making that part near the horizon appear to recede except by means of\r\nfine black lines becoming gradually closer as they descend, as seen in\r\nthe tint No. 3. As the black lines in this tint are closer at the bottom\r\nthan at the top, it might naturally be supposed that the colour would be\r\nproportionably stronger in that part. It is, however, known by\r\nexperience that the unequal distance of the lines in such a tint does\r\nnot cause any perceptible difference in the colour; as the upper lines,\r\nin consequence of their being more apart, print thicker, and thus\r\ncounterbalance the effect of the greater closeness of the others.\r\n\r\nThe two following cuts are specimens of tints represented by means of\r\nwaved lines: in No. 6 the lines are slightly undulated; in No. 7 they\r\nhave more of the appearance of zig-zag.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 6.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 7.]\r\n\r\nWaved lines are generally introduced to represent clouds, as they not\r\nonly form a contrast with the straight lines of the sky, but from their\r\nform suggest the idea of motion. It is necessary to observe, that if the\r\nalternate undulations in such lines be too much curved, the tint, when\r\nprinted, will appear as if intersected from top to bottom, like\r\nwicker-work with perpendicular stakes, in the manner shown in the\r\nfollowing specimen, No. 8. This appearance is caused by the unequal\r\npressure of the tool in forming the small curves of which each line is\r\ncomposed, thus making the black or raised line rather thicker in some\r\nparts than in others, and the white interstices wide or narrow in the\r\nsame proportion. The appearance of such a tint is precisely the same\r\nwhether cut by hand or by a machine.[IX-15] In executing waved tints it\r\nis therefore necessary to be particularly careful not to get the\r\nundulations too much curved.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-15: The sky in many of the large wood engravings\r\n    executed in London is now cut by means of a machine invented by\r\n    Mr. John Parkhouse. In many steel engravings the sky is ruled in\r\n    by means of a machine by persons who do little else.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 8.]\r\n\r\nAs the choice of proper tints depends on taste, no specific rules can be\r\nlaid down to guide a person in their selection. The proper use of lines\r\nof various kinds as applied to the execution of wood-cuts, is a most\r\nimportant consideration to the engraver, as upon their proper\r\napplication all indications of form, texture, and conventional colour\r\nentirely depend. Lines are not to be introduced merely as such,--to\r\ndisplay the mechanical skill of the engraver; they ought to be the signs\r\nof an artistic meaning, and be judged of accordingly as they serve to\r\nexpress it with feeling and correctness. Some wood engravers are but too\r\napt to pride themselves on the delicacy of their _lining_, without\r\nconsidering whether it be well adapted to express their subject; and to\r\nfancy that excellence in the art consists chiefly in cutting with great\r\nlabour a number of delicate unmeaning lines. To such an extent is this\r\ncarried by some of this class that they spend more time in expressing\r\nthe mere scratches of the designer’s pencil in a shade than a Bewick or\r\na Clennell would require to engrave a cut full of meaning and interest.\r\nMere delicacy of lines will not, however, compensate for want of natural\r\nexpression, nor laborious trifling for that vigorous execution which is\r\nthe result of feeling. “Expression,” says Flaxman, “engages the\r\nattention, and excites an interest which compensates for a multitude of\r\ndefects--whilst the most admirable execution, without a just and lively\r\nexpression, will be disregarded as laborious inanity, or contemned as an\r\nillusory endeavour to impose on the feelings and the understanding.--\r\nSentiment gives a sterling value, an irresistible charm, to the rudest\r\nimagery or the most unpractised scrawl. By this quality a firm alliance\r\nis formed with the affections in all works of art.”[IX-16] Perpetrators\r\nof laborious inanities find, however, their admirers; and an amateur of\r\nsuch delicacies is in raptures with a specimen of “exquisitely fine\r\nlining,” and when told that such wood-_peckings_ are, as works of art,\r\nmuch inferior to the productions of Bewick, he asks where his works are\r\nto be found; and after he has examined them he pronounces them “coarse\r\nand tasteless,--the rude efforts of a _country_ engraver,” and not to be\r\ncompared with certain delicate, but spiritless, wood engravings of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-16: Lectures on Sculpture, pp. 172-193.]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the direction of lines, it ought at all times to be\r\nborne in mind by the wood engraver,--and more especially when the lines\r\nare not _laid in_ by the designer,--that they should be disposed so as\r\nto denote the peculiar form of the object they are intended to\r\nrepresent. For instance, in the limb of a figure they ought not to run\r\nhorizontally or vertically,--conveying the idea of either a flat surface\r\nor of a hard cylindrical form,--but with a gentle curvature suitable to\r\nthe shape and the degree of rotundity required. A well chosen line makes\r\na great difference in properly representing an object, when compared\r\nwith one less appropriate, though more delicate. The proper disposition\r\nof lines will not only express the form required, but also produce more\r\n_colour_ as they approach each other in approximating curves, as in the\r\nfollowing example, and thus represent a variety of light and shade,\r\nwithout the necessity of introducing other lines crossing them, which\r\nought always to be avoided in small subjects: if, however, the figures\r\nbe large, it is necessary to break the hard appearance of a series of\r\nsuch single lines by crossing them with others more delicate.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn cutting curved lines, considerable difficulty is experienced by not\r\ncommencing properly. For instance, if in executing a series of such\r\nlines as are shown in the preceding cut, the engraver commences at A,\r\nand works towards B, the tool will always be apt to cut through the\r\nblack line already formed; whereas by commencing at B, and working\r\ntowards A, the graver is always outside of the curve, and consequently\r\nnever touches the lines previously cut.[IX-17] This difference ought\r\nalways to be borne in mind when engraving a series of curved lines, as,\r\nby commencing properly, the work is executed with greater freedom and\r\nease, while the inconvenience arising from slips is avoided. When such\r\nlines are introduced to represent the rotundity of a limb, with a break\r\nof white in the middle expressive of its greatest prominence, as is\r\nshown in the following figure A, it is advisable that they should be\r\nfirst _laid in_ as if intended to be continuous, as is seen in figure B,\r\nand the part which appears white in A _lowered_ out before beginning to\r\ncut them, as by this means all risk of their disagreeing, as in C, will\r\nbe avoided.\r\n\r\n  [Illustrations:\r\n  A B C]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-17: As the drawing is the reverse of the impression,\r\n    it is necessary to observe that the motion of the graver in this\r\n    case is from right to left on the block,--that is, the point B\r\n    forms the beginning, and not the termination, of the first line\r\n    when the work is properly commenced. The lines are represented in\r\n    the cut as they would appear when drawn on a block to be engraved\r\n    in the manner recommended.]\r\n\r\nThe rotundity of a column or similar object is represented by means of\r\nparallel lines, which are comparatively open in the middle where light\r\nis required, but which are engraved closer and thicker towards the sides\r\nto express shade. The effect of such lines will be rendered more evident\r\nby comparing the column in the annexed cut with the square base, which\r\nis represented by a series of equidistant lines, each of the same\r\nthickness as those in the middle of the column.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nMany more examples of tints and simple lines might be given; but, as no\r\nreal benefit would be derived from them, it is needless to increase the\r\nnumber, and make “much ado about nothing.” Every new subject that the\r\nengraver commences presents something new for him to effect, and\r\nrequires the exercise of his taste and judgment as to the best mode of\r\nexecuting it, so that the whole may have some claim to the character of\r\na work of art. If a thousand examples were given, they would not enable\r\nan engraver to execute a subject properly, unless he were endowed with\r\nthat indefinable _feeling_ which at once suggests the best means of\r\nattaining his end. Such feeling may indeed be excited, but can never be\r\nperfectly communicated by rules and examples. In this respect every\r\nartist, whether a humble wood engraver, or a sculptor or a painter of\r\nthe highest class, must be self-instructed; the feeling displayed in his\r\nworks must be the result of his own perceptions and ideas of beauty and\r\npropriety. It is the difference in feeling, rather than any greater or\r\nless degree of excellence in the mechanical execution, that\r\ndistinguishes the paintings of Raffaele from those of Le Brun, Flaxman’s\r\nstatues from those of Roubilliac, and the cuts in the Lyons Dance of\r\nDeath from many of the laborious inanities of the present day.\r\n\r\nClear, unruffled water, and all bright and smooth metallic substances,\r\nare best represented by single lines; for if cross-lines be introduced,\r\nexcept to indicate a strong shadow, it gives to them the appearance of\r\nroughness, which is not at all in accordance with the ideas which such\r\nsubstances naturally excite. Objects which appear to reflect brilliant\r\nflashes of light ought to be carefully dealt with, leaving _plenty of\r\nblack_ as a ground-work, for in wood engravings such lights can only be\r\neffectively represented by contrast with deep _colour_. Reflected lights\r\nare in general best represented by means of single lines running in the\r\ndirection of the object, with a few touches of white judiciously taken\r\nout. In this respect Clennell particularly excelled as a wood engraver.\r\nPainting itself can scarcely represent reflected lights with greater\r\neffect than he has expressed them in several of his cuts. In Harvey’s\r\nlarge cut of the Death of Dentatus, after Haydon’s noble picture, the\r\nshield of Dentatus affords an instance of reflected light most admirably\r\nrepresented.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs my object is to point out to the uninitiated the method of cutting\r\ncertain lines, rather than to engage in the fruitless task of showing\r\nhow such lines are to be generally applied, I shall now proceed to offer\r\na few observations on engraving in outline, a process with which the\r\nlearner ought to be well acquainted before he attempts subjects\r\nconsisting of complicated lines. The word _outline_ in wood engraving\r\nhas two meanings: it is used, first, to denote the distinct boundaries\r\nof all kinds of objects; and secondly, to denote the delicate white line\r\nthat is cut round any figure or object in order to form a boundary to\r\nthe lines by which such figure or object is surrounded, and to thus\r\nallow of their easier liberation: it forms as it were a terminal furrow\r\ninto which the lines surrounding the figure run. In speaking of this\r\nsecond outline in future, it will be distinguished as the _white\r\noutline_; while the other, which properly defines the different figures\r\nand forms, will be called the true or proper outline, or simply the\r\noutline, without any distinctive additional term. As the white outline\r\nought never to be distinctly visible in an impression, care ought to be\r\ntaken, more especially where the adjacent tint is dark, not to cut it\r\ntoo deep or too wide. In the first of the two following cuts, the white\r\noutline, intentionally cut rather wider than is necessary, is distinctly\r\nseen from its contrast with the dark parts immediately in contact with\r\nit. In the second cut of the same subject, with a different back-ground,\r\nit is less visible in consequence of the parts adjacent being light. It\r\nis, however, still distinctly seen in the shadow of the feet; but it is\r\nshown here purposely to point out an error which is sometimes committed\r\nby cutting a white outline where, as in these parts, it is not required.\r\nThe white outline is here quite unnecessary, as the two blacks ought not\r\nto be separated in such a manner; the proper intention of the white\r\noutline is not so much to define the form of the figure or object, but,\r\nas has been already explained, to make an incision in the wood as a\r\nboundary to _other lines_ coming against it, and to allow of their being\r\nclearly liberated without injury to the proper outline of the object:\r\nwhen a line is cut to such a boundary, the small shaving forced out by\r\nthe graver becomes immediately released, without the point of the tool\r\ncoming in contact with the true outline. The old German wood engravers,\r\nwho chiefly engraved large subjects on apple or pear tree, and on the\r\n_side_ of the wood, were not in the habit of cutting a white outline\r\nround their figures before they began to engrave them, and hence in\r\ntheir cuts objects frequently appear _to stick_ to each other. The\r\npractice is now, however, so general, that in many modern wood-cuts a\r\nwhite line is improperly seen surrounding every figure.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn proceeding to engrave figures, it is advisable to commence with such\r\nas consist of little more than outline, and have no shades expressed by\r\ncross-lines. The first step in executing such a subject is to cut a\r\nwhite line on each side of the pencilled lines which are to remain in\r\nrelief of the height of the plane surface of the block, and to form the\r\nimpression when it is printed. A cut when thus engraved, and previous\r\nto the parts which are white, when printed, being cut away, or, in\r\ntechnical language, _blocked out_, would present the following\r\nappearance.[IX-18] It is, however, necessary to observe that all the\r\nparts which require to be blocked away have been purposely retained\r\nin this cut in order to show more clearly the manner in which it is\r\nexecuted; for the engraver usually cuts away as he proceeds all the\r\nblack masses seen within the subject. A wide margin of solid wood round\r\nthe edges of the cut is, however, generally allowed to remain until a\r\nproof be taken when the engraving is finished, as it affords a support\r\nto the paper, and prevents the exterior lines of the subject from\r\nappearing too hard. This margin, where room is allowed, is separated\r\nfrom the engraved parts by a moderately deep and wide furrow, and is\r\ncovered with a piece of paper serving as a _frisket_ in taking a proof\r\nimpression by means of friction. In clearing away such of the black\r\nparts in the preceding cut as require to be removed, it is necessary\r\nto proceed with great care in order to avoid breaking down or cutting\r\nthrough the lines which are to be left in relief. When the cut is\r\nproperly cleared out and blocked away, it is then finished, and when\r\nprinted will appear thus:\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-18: The subject of this cut is the beautiful monument\r\n    to the memory of two children executed by Sir F. Chantrey, in\r\n    Lichfield Cathedral.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nSculptures and bas-reliefs of any kind are generally best represented by\r\nsimple outlines, with delicate parallel lines, running horizontally, to\r\nrepresent the ground. The following cut is from a design by Flaxman for\r\nthe front of a gold snuff-box made by Rundell and Bridge for George IV.\r\nabout 1827. The subject of this design was intended to commemorate the\r\nGeneral Peace concluded in 1814: to the left Agriculture is seen\r\nflourishing under the auspices of Peace; while to the right a youthful\r\nfigure is seen placing a wreath above the helmet of a warrior; the\r\ntrophy indicates his services, and opposite to him is seated a figure of\r\nVictory. The three other sides, and the top and bottom, were also\r\nembellished with figures and ornaments in relief designed by Flaxman.\r\nThe whole of the dies were cut in steel by Henning and Son--so well\r\nknown to admirers of art from their beautiful reduced copies and\r\nrestorations of the sculptures of the Parthenon preserved in the British\r\nMuseum--and from these dies the plates of gold composing the box were\r\nstruck, so that the figures appear in slight relief. A blank space was\r\nleft in the top of the box for an enamel portrait of the King, which was\r\nafterwards inserted, surrounded with diamonds, and the margin of the lid\r\nwas also ornamented in the same manner. This box is perhaps the most\r\nbeautiful of the kind ever executed in any country: it may justly\r\nchallenge a comparison with the drinking cups by Benvenuto Cellini, the\r\ndagger hafts designed by Durer, or the salts by Hans Holbein. The\r\nprocess of engraving in this style is extremely simple, as it is only\r\nnecessary to leave the lines drawn in pencil untouched, and to cut away\r\nthe wood on each side of them. An amateur may without much trouble teach\r\nhimself to execute cuts in this manner, or to engrave fac-similes of\r\nsmall pen-and-ink sketches such as the annexed.[IX-19]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-19: This small cut is a fac-simile, the size of the\r\n    original, of Sir David Wilkie’s first sketch for his picture of\r\n    the Rabbit on the Wall.]\r\n\r\nHaving now explained the mode of procedure in outline engraving, it\r\nseems necessary, before proceeding to speak of more complicated\r\nsubjects, to say a few words respecting drawings made on the block; for,\r\nhowever well the engraving may be executed, the cut which is a\r\nfac-simile of a bad drawing can never be a good one. An artist’s\r\nknowledge of drawing is put to the test when he begins to make designs\r\non wood; he cannot resort, as in painting, to the trick of colour to\r\nconceal the defects of his outlines. To be efficient in the engraving,\r\nhis principal figures must be distinctly made out; a drawing on the wood\r\nadmits of no _scumbling_; black and white are the only means by which\r\nthe subject can be represented; and if he be ignorant of the proper\r\nmanagement of chiaro-scuro, and incorrect and feeble in his drawing, he\r\nwill not be able to produce a really good design for the wood engraver.\r\nMany persons can paint a tolerably good picture who are utterly\r\nincapable of making a passable drawing on wood. Their drawing will not\r\nstand the test of simple black and white; they can indicate generalities\r\n“indifferently well” by means of positive colours, but they cannot\r\ndelineate individual forms correctly with the black-lead pencil. It is\r\nfrom this cause that we have so very few persons who professedly make\r\ndesigns for wood engravers; and hence the sameness of character that is\r\nto be found in so many modern wood-cuts. It is not unusual for many\r\nsecond and third rate painters, when applied to for a drawing for a\r\nwood-cut, to speak slightingly of the art, and to decline to furnish the\r\ndesign required. This generally results rather from a consciousness of\r\ntheir own incapacity than from any real contempt for the art. As greater\r\npainters than any now living have made designs for wood engravers in\r\nformer times, a second or third rate painter of the present day surely\r\ncould not be much degraded by doing the same. The true reason for the\r\nrefusal, however, is generally to be found in such painter’s incapacity.\r\n\r\nThe two next cuts, both drawn from the same sketch,[IX-20] but by\r\ndifferent persons, will show how much depends upon having a good,\r\nartist-like drawing. The first is meagre; the second, on the contrary,\r\nis remarkably spirited, and the additional lines which are introduced\r\nnot only give effect to the figure, but also in printing form a support\r\nto the more delicate parts of the outline.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No 1.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 2.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-20: The original sketch, from which the figure was\r\n    copied, is by Morland.]\r\n\r\nThough a learner in proceeding from one subject to another more\r\ncomplicated will doubtless meet with difficulties which may occasionally\r\ndamp his ardour, yet he will encounter none which will not yield to\r\nearnest perseverance. As it is not likely that any amateur practising\r\nthe art merely for amusement would be inclined to test his patience by\r\nproceeding beyond outline engraving, the succeeding remarks are more\r\nespecially addressed to those who may wish to apply themselves to wood\r\nengraving as a profession.\r\n\r\nWhen beginning to engrave in outline, it is advisable that the subjects\r\nfirst attempted should be of the most simple kind,--similar, for\r\ninstance, to the preceding figure marked No. 1. When facility in\r\nexecuting cuts in this style is obtained, the learner may proceed to\r\nengrave such as are slightly shaded, and have a back-ground indicated as\r\nin No. 2. He may next proceed to subjects containing a greater variety\r\nof lines, and requiring greater neatness of execution, but should by no\r\nmeans endeavour to get on too fast by attempting to do _much_ before he\r\ncan do a little _well_. Whatever kind of subject be chosen, particular\r\nattention ought to be paid to the causes of failure and success in the\r\nexecution. By diligently noting what produces a good effect in certain\r\nsubjects, he will, under similar circumstances, be prepared to apply the\r\nsame means; and by attending to the faults in his work he will be the\r\nmore careful to avoid them in future. The group of figures here,\r\nselected from Sir David Wilkie’s picture of the Rent Day, will serve as\r\nan example of a cut executed by comparatively simple means; the subject\r\nis also such a one as a pupil may attempt after he has made some\r\nprogress in engraving slightly shaded figures. There are no complicated\r\nlines which are difficult to execute; the hatchings are few, and of\r\nsimple character; and for the execution of the whole, as here\r\nrepresented, nothing is required but a _feeling_ for the subject; and a\r\nmoderate degree of skill in the use of the graver, combined with patient\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen the pupil is thus far advanced, he ought, in subjects of this kind,\r\nto avoid introducing more work, more especially in the features, than he\r\ncan execute with comparative facility and precision; for, by attempting\r\nto attain excellence before he has arrived at mediocrity, he will be\r\nvery likely to fail, and instead of having reason to congratulate\r\nhimself on his success, experience nothing but disappointment. To make\r\nwood engraving an interesting, instead of an irksome study to young\r\npersons, I would recommend for their practice not only such subjects as\r\nare likely to engage their attention, but also such as they may be able\r\nto finish before they become weary of their task. At this period every\r\nendeavour ought to be made to smooth the pupil’s way by giving him such\r\nsubjects to execute as will rather serve to stimulate his exertions than\r\nexhaust his patience. Little characteristic figures, like the one here\r\ncopied, from one of Hogarth’s plates of the Four Parts of the Day, seem\r\nmost suitable for this purpose. A subject of this kind does not contain\r\nso much work as to render a young person tired of it before it be\r\nfinished; while at the same time it serves to exercise him in the\r\npractice of the art and to engage his attention.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen a pupil feels no interest in what he is employed on, he will seldom\r\nexecute his work well; and when he is kept too long in engraving\r\nsubjects that merely try his patience, he is apt to lose all taste for\r\nthe art, and become a mere mechanical cutter of lines, without caring\r\nfor what they express.\r\n\r\nSuch a cut as the following--copied from an etching by Rembrandt--will\r\nform a useful exercise to the pupil, after he has attained facility in\r\nthe execution of outline subjects, while at the same time it will serve\r\nto display the excellent effect in wood engravings of well contrasted\r\nlight and shade. The hog--which is here the principal object--\r\nimmediately arrests the eye, while the figures in the back-ground,\r\nbeing introduced merely to aid the composition and form a medium\r\nbetween the dark colour of the animal and the white paper, consist\r\nof little more than outline, and are comparatively light. In engraving\r\nthe hog, it is necessary to exercise a little judgment in representing\r\nthe bristly hair, and in _touching_ the details effectively.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen a learner has made some progress, he may attempt such a cut as that\r\non the next page in order to exercise himself in the appropriate\r\nrepresentation of animal texture. The subject is a dray-horse, formerly\r\nbelonging to Messrs. Meux and Co., and the drawing was made on the block\r\nby James Ward, R.A., one of the most distinguished animal painters of\r\nthe present time. Such a cut, though executed by simple means, affords\r\nan excellent test of a learner’s skill and discrimination: the hide is\r\nsmooth and glossy; the mane is thick and tangled; the long flowing hair\r\nof the tail has to be represented in a proper manner; and the markings\r\nof the joints require the exercise of both judgment and skill. By\r\nattending to such distinctions at the commencement of his career, he\r\nwill find less difficulty in representing objects by appropriate texture\r\nwhen he shall have made greater progress, and will not be entirely\r\ndependent on a designer to _lay in_ for him every line. An engraver who\r\nrequires every line to be drawn, and who is only capable of executing a\r\nfac-simile of a design made for him on the block, can never excel.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs enough perhaps has been said in explanation of the manner of cutting\r\ntints, and of figures chiefly represented by single lines, I shall now\r\ngive a cut--Jacob blessing the children of Joseph--in which single-lined\r\nfigures and tint are combined. It is necessary to observe that this cut\r\nis not introduced as a good specimen of engraving, but as being well\r\nadapted, from the simplicity of its execution, to illustrate what I have\r\nto say. The figures are represented by single lines, which require the\r\nexercise of no great degree of skill; and by the introduction of a\r\nvaried tint as a back-ground the cut appears like a complete subject,\r\nand not like a sketch, or a detached group.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to remark here, that when comparatively light objects,\r\nsuch as the figures here seen, are to be relieved by a tint of any kind,\r\nwhether darker or lighter, such objects are now generally separated from\r\nit by a black outline. The reason for leaving such an outline in parts\r\nwhere the conjunction of the tint and the figures does not render it\r\nabsolutely _necessary_ is this: as those parts in a cut which appear\r\nwhite in the impression are to be cut away--as has already been\r\nexplained,--it frequently happens that when they are cut away _first_,\r\nand the tint cut afterwards, the wood breaks away near the termination\r\nof the line before the tool arrives at the blank or white. It is,\r\ntherefore, extremely difficult to preserve a distinct outline in this\r\nmanner, and hence a black _conventional_ outline is introduced in those\r\nparts where properly there ought to be none, except such as is formed by\r\nthe tint _relieving_ against the white parts, as is seen in the back\r\npart of the head of Jacob in the present cut, where there is no other\r\noutline than that which is formed by the tint relieving against his\r\nwhite cap. Bewick used to execute all his subjects in this manner; but\r\nhe not unfrequently carried this principle too far, not only running the\r\nlines of his tints into the white on the _light_ side of his\r\nfigures,--that is, on the side on which the light falls,--but also on\r\nboth sides of a light object.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nBefore dismissing this part of the subject, it is necessary to observe\r\nfurther, that when the white parts are cut away before the tint is\r\nintroduced, the conventional black outline is very liable to be cut\r\nthrough by the tool slipping. This will be rendered more intelligible by\r\nan inspection of the following cut,[IX-21] where the house is seen\r\nfinished, and the part where a tint is intended to be subsequently\r\nengraved appears black. Any person in the least acquainted with the\r\npractice of wood engraving, will perceive, that should the tool happen\r\nto slip when near the finished parts, in coming directly towards them,\r\nit will be very likely to cut the outline through, and to make a breach\r\nin proportion as such outline may be thin, and thus yield more readily\r\nto the force of the tool.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-21: In this cut the _white_ outline, mentioned at\r\n    page 587, is distinctly seen at the top of the buildings and above\r\n    the trees.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen the tint is cut _first_, instead of being left to be executed last,\r\nas it would be in the preceding cut, the mass of wood out of which the\r\nhouse is subsequently engraved serves as a kind of barrier to the tool\r\nin the event of its slipping, and allows of the tint being cut with less\r\nrisk quite up to the white outline. By attending to such matters, and\r\nconsidering what part of a subject can be most safely executed first,\r\na learner will both avoid the risk of cutting through his outline, and\r\nbe enabled to execute his work with comparative facility. The following\r\ncut is an example of the tint being cut first. For the information of\r\nthose who are unacquainted with the process of wood engraving, it is\r\nnecessary to remark that the parts which appear positively black are\r\nthose which remain untouched by the graver.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe following subject, copied from one of Rembrandt’s etchings, is\r\nchiefly represented by black lines crossing each other. Such lines,\r\nusually termed _cross-hatchings_, are executed with great facility in\r\ncopper and steel, where they are cut _into_ the metal; but in wood\r\nengraving, where they are left in _relief_, it requires considerable\r\ntime and attention to execute them with delicacy and precision. In order\r\nto explain more clearly the difficulty of executing cross-hatchings, let\r\nit be conceived that this cut is a drawing made on a block, and that the\r\nengraver’s object is to produce a fac-simile of it: now, as each black\r\nline is to be left in relief, it is evident that he cannot imitate the\r\ncross-hatchings seen in the arms, the neck, and other parts, by cutting\r\nthe lines continuously as in engraving on copper, which puts black _in_\r\nby means of an incision, while in wood engraving a similar line takes it\r\n_out_. As the wood engraver, then, can only obtain white by cutting out\r\nthe parts that are to appear so in the impression, while the black is to\r\nbe left in relief, the only manner in which he is enabled to represent\r\n_cross-hatchings_, or _black lines crossing each other_, is to cut out\r\nsingly with his graver every one of the white interstices. Such an\r\noperation, as will be evident from an inspection of this cut,\r\nnecessarily requires not only patience, but also considerable skill to\r\nperform it in a proper manner,--that is, to cut each white space cleanly\r\nout, and to preserve the lines of a regular thickness. From the supposed\r\nimpossibility of executing such cross lines, it has been conjectured\r\nthat many of the old wood-cuts containing such work were engraved in\r\nmetallic relief: this opinion, however, is sufficiently refuted, by the\r\nfact of hundreds of blocks containing cross-hatchings being still in\r\nexistence, and by the much more delicate and difficult work of the same\r\nkind displayed in modern wood engravings. Not only are cross-hatchings\r\nof the greatest delicacy now executed in England, but to such a degree\r\nof refinement is the process occasionally carried, that small black\r\n_touches_--such as may be perceived in the preceding cut in the folds of\r\nthe sleeve above the elbow of the right arm--are left in the white\r\ninterstices between the lines. Cross-hatchings, where the interstices\r\nare entirely white, are executed by means of a lozenge-pointed tool, and\r\nthe piece of wood is removed at two _cuts_, each beginning at the\r\nopposite angles. Where a small black touch is left within the\r\ninterstices, the operation becomes more difficult, and is performed by\r\ncutting round such minute touch of black with a finely pointed graver.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe various conjectures that have been propounded respecting the mode in\r\nwhich cross-hatchings have been effected in old wood-cuts require no\r\nargument to refute them, as they are directly contradicted both by\r\nundoubted historical facts, and by every day’s experience. Vegetable\r\nputties, punches, and metallic relief are nothing but the trifling\r\nspeculations of persons who are fonder of propounding theories to\r\ndisplay their own ingenuity than willing to investigate facts in order\r\nto arrive at the truth. It has happened rather unfortunately, that most\r\npersons who have hitherto written upon the subject have known very\r\nlittle about the practice of wood engraving, and have not thought it\r\nworth their while to consult those who were able to give them\r\ninformation. There is, however, no fear now of a young wood engraver\r\nbeing deterred from attempting cross-hatchings on learning from certain\r\nheretofore authorities on the subject that such work could not be\r\nexecuted on wood. He now laughs at _vegetable putties_, _square-pointed\r\npunches_ for indenting the block to produce cross-hatchings, and\r\n_metallic relief_: by means of his graver alone he produces a practical\r\nrefutation of every baseless theory that has been propounded on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe right leg of Dentatus in Mr. Harvey’s large wood engraving after Mr.\r\nHaydon’s picture is perhaps the most beautiful specimen of\r\ncross-hatching that ever was executed on wood; and, in my opinion, it is\r\nthe best engraved part of the whole subject. Through the kindness of Mr.\r\nHarvey, I have obtained a cast of this portion of the block, from which\r\nthe present impression is printed. The lines showing the muscular\r\nrotundity and action of the limb are as admirably _laid in_ as they are\r\nbeautifully engraved. In the wider and stronger cross-hatchings of the\r\ndrapery above, the small black touches previously mentioned are\r\nperceived in the lozenge-shaped interstices.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nFrom an opinion that the excellence of an engraving consists chiefly in\r\nthe difficulty of its execution, we now frequently find cross-hatchings\r\nin several modern wood-cuts, more especially in such as are manufactured\r\nfor the French market, where a better effect would have been produced by\r\nsimpler means. Cross-hatchings, _properly introduced_, undoubtedly\r\nimprove a subject; and some parts of large figures, such as the leg of\r\nDentatus, cannot be well expressed without their aid, as a series of\r\ncurved lines on a limb, when not crossed, generally cause it to appear\r\nstiff and rigid. By crossing them, however, by other lines properly\r\n_laid in_, the part assumes a most soft and natural appearance.\r\n\r\nAs the greatest advantage which wood engraving possesses over copper is\r\nthe effective manner in which strongly contrasted light and shade can be\r\nrepresented, Rembrandt’s etchings,--which, like his paintings, are\r\ndistinguished by the skilful management of the chiaro-scuro--form\r\nexcellent studies for the engraver or designer on wood who should wish\r\nto become well acquainted with the capabilities of the art. A delicate\r\nwood-cut, executed in imitation of a smooth steel-engraving of “sober\r\ngrey” tone, is sure to be tame and insipid; and whenever wood engravers\r\nattempt to give to their cuts the appearance of copper or steel-plates,\r\nand neglect the peculiar advantages of their own art, they are sure to\r\nfail, notwithstanding the pains they may bestow. Their work, instead of\r\nbeing commended as a successful application of the peculiar means of the\r\nart, is in effect condemned by being regarded as “a clever _imitation_\r\nof a copper-plate.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe above cut of Christ and the Woman of Samaria, copied from an etching\r\nby Rembrandt, will perhaps more forcibly illustrate what has been said\r\nwith respect to wood engraving being excellently adapted to effectively\r\nexpress strong contrasts of light and shade. The original etching--which\r\nhas been faithfully copied--is a good example of Rembrandt’s consummate\r\nskill in the management of chiaro-scuro; everything that he has wished\r\nto forcibly express immediately arrests the eye, while in the whole\r\ndesign nothing appears abrupt. The extremes of light and shade concentre\r\nin the principal figure, that of Christ, and to this everything else in\r\nthe composition is either subordinate or accessory. The middle tint\r\nunder the arched passage forms a medium between the darkness of Christ’s\r\nrobe and the shade under the curve of the nearest arch, and the light in\r\nthe front of his figure is gradually carried off to the left through the\r\nmedium of the woman and the distant buildings, which gradually approach\r\nto the colour of the paper. Were a tint, however delicate, introduced in\r\nthis subject to represent the sky, the effect would be destroyed; the\r\nparts which are now so effective would appear spotted and confused, and\r\nhave a crude, unfinished appearance. By the injudicious introduction of\r\na tinted sky many wood-cuts, which would otherwise be striking and\r\neffective, are quite spoiled.\r\n\r\nIt but too frequently happens when works are illustrated with wood-cuts,\r\nthat subjects are chosen which the art cannot successfully represent.\r\nWhether the work to be illustrated be matter of fact or fiction, the\r\ndesigner, unless he be acquainted both with the capabilities and defects\r\nof the art, seldom thinks of more than making a drawing according to his\r\nown fancy, and never takes into consideration the means by which it has\r\nto be executed. To this inattention may be traced many failures in works\r\nillustrated with wood-cuts, and for which the engraver is censured,\r\nalthough he may have, with great care and skill, accomplished all that\r\nthe art could effect. An artist who is desirous that his designs, when\r\nengraved on wood, should appear like impressions from _over-done_\r\nsteel-plates, ought never to be employed to make drawings for wood\r\nengravers: he does not understand the peculiar advantages of the art,\r\nand his designs will only have a tendency to bring it into contempt,\r\nwhile those who execute them will be blamed for the defects which are\r\nthe result of his want of knowledge.\r\n\r\nDelicate wood engravings which are made to look well in a proof on India\r\npaper by rubbing the ink partially off the block in the lighter\r\nparts--in the manner described by Papillon at page 466--generally\r\npresent a very different appearance when printed, either with or without\r\ntypes in the same page. Lines which are cut too thin are very liable to\r\nturn down in printing from their want of support; and hence cuts\r\nconsisting chiefly of such lines are seldom so durable as those which\r\ndisplay more black, and are executed in a more bold and effective style.\r\nA designer who understands the peculiarities of wood engraving will\r\navoid introducing delicate lines in parts where they receive no support\r\nfrom others of greater strength or closeness near to them, but are\r\nexposed to the unmitigated force of the press. Cuts in proportion to the\r\nquantity of _colour_ which they display are so much the better enabled\r\nto bear the action of the press; the delicate lines which they contain,\r\nfrom their receiving support from the others, are not only less liable\r\nto break down, but, from their contrast with the darker parts of the\r\nsubject, appear to greater advantage than in a cut which is of a\r\nuniformly grey tone. I am not, however, the advocate of _black_, and\r\nlittle else, in a wood-cut; on the contrary, I am perfectly aware of the\r\nabsurdity of introducing patches of black without either meaning or\r\neffect. What I wish to inculcate is, that a wood-cut to have a good\r\neffect must contain more of properly contrasted black and white than\r\nthose who wish their cuts to appear like imitations of steel or\r\ncopper-plate engravings are willing to allow. As wood engraving is not\r\nwell adapted to represent subjects requiring great delicacy of lines and\r\nvariety of tints, such will be generally avoided by a designer who\r\nunderstands the art; while, on the contrary, he will avail himself of\r\nits advantages in representing well contrasted light and shade in a\r\nmanner superior to either copper-plate or steel engraving. Of all modern\r\nengravers on wood, none understood the advantages of their art in this\r\nrespect better than Bewick and Clennell: the cuts of their engraving are\r\ngenerally the most effective that have ever been executed.\r\n\r\nNight-pieces, where the light is seen proceeding from a lantern, a lamp,\r\nor any other luminous object, can be well represented by means of wood\r\nengraving, although such subjects are very seldom attempted. An engraved\r\nwood-block, which contains a considerable proportion of positive black,\r\nprints much better than a copper-plate engraving of the same kind; in\r\nthe former the ink is distributed of an even thickness over the\r\n_surface_, and is evenly pressed upon the paper; in the latter the ink\r\nforms a little pool in the _hollowed parts_, and, instead of being\r\nevenly taken up by the paper which is _pressed into_ it, adheres only\r\npartially, thus giving in the corresponding parts a blurred appearance\r\nto the impression. For the effective representation of such scenes as\r\nMeg Merrilies watching by a feeble light the dying struggles of a\r\nsmuggler, or Dirk Hatterick in the Cave, from Sir Walter Scott’s Guy\r\nMannering, wood engraving is peculiarly adapted,--that is, supposing the\r\ndesigner, in addition to possessing a knowledge of chiaro-scuro, to be\r\nalso capable of drawing correctly, and of treating the subject with\r\nproper _feeling_. Some idea of the capability of the art in this respect\r\nmay be formed from the following cut--the Flight into Egypt,--copied\r\nfrom an etching by Rembrandt. The mere work in this cut is of a very\r\nsimple character; there are no lines of difficult execution; and the\r\nonly parts that are lowered are those which represent the rays of light\r\nseen proceeding from the lantern.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs the wood engraver can always get his subject _lighter_, but cannot\r\nreproduce the black which he has cut away, he ought to be careful not to\r\nget his subject too light before he has taken a proof; and even in\r\nreducing the _colour_ according to the touchings of the designer on the\r\nproof, he ought to proceed with great circumspection; and where his own\r\njudgment informs him that to take out all the black marked for excision\r\nwould be to spoil the cut, the safest mode would be to take out only a\r\npart, and not remove all at once; for by strictly adhering to the\r\ndirections of an artist who knows very little of the real advantages of\r\nwood engraving, it will not unfrequently happen that the cut so amended\r\nwill to himself, when printed, appear worse than it did in its first\r\nstate. In the following cut too much has been done in this respect; it\r\nhas been touched and retouched so often, in order to make it appear\r\ndelicate, that the spirit of the original drawing has been entirely\r\nlost. In this instance the fault was not that of the artist, but of the\r\nengraver, who “would not let well alone;” but, in order to improve his\r\nwork, as he fancied, kept _trimming_ the parts which gave effect to the\r\nwhole till he made it what it now appears. So far as relates to the\r\nexecution of the lines, the subject need not have been better; but, from\r\nthe engraver’s having taken away too much colour in places where it was\r\nnecessary, the whole has the appearance of middle tint, the excellence\r\nof the original drawing is lost, and in its stead we have a dull, misty,\r\nspiritless wood engraving.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn every cut there ought to be a principal object to first arrest the\r\nattention; and if this cannot be effected from want of interest in such\r\nobject considered singly, the designer ought to make the general subject\r\npleasing to the eye by skilful composition or combination of forms, and\r\nthe effective distribution of light and shade.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe preceding cut--a moonlight scene--when compared with the previous\r\none, will show how much depends on an engraver having a proper _feeling_\r\nfor his subject. So far as relates to the mere execution of the lines,\r\nthis cut is decidedly inferior to the former; but, viewed as a\r\nproduction of art, and as a spirited representation of the original\r\ndrawing, it is very much superior: in the former we see little more than\r\nmechanical dexterity; while in the latter we perceive that the engraver\r\nhas, from a greater knowledge of his art, produced a pleasing effect by\r\ncomparatively simple means. The former cut displays more mechanical\r\nskill; the latter more artistic feeling. The one contains much delicate\r\nwork, but is deficient in spirit; the other, which has been produced\r\nwith little more than half the labour, is more effective because the\r\nsubject has been better understood.\r\n\r\nThe following cut, representing a landscape, with the effect of the\r\nsetting sun, displays great delicacy of execution; but the labour here\r\nis not thrown away, as in the sea-piece just mentioned: manual dexterity\r\nin the use of the graver is combined with the knowledge of an artist,\r\nand the result is a wood engraving at once delicate in execution and\r\nspirited in its general effect.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nA volume might be filled with examples and comments on them, and I\r\nmight, like Papillon, _instruct_ the reader in the practice of the art,\r\nby informing him how many times the graver would have to enter the wood\r\nin order to produce a certain number of lines in relief; but I have no\r\ninclination to do either the one or the other: my object is to make a\r\nfew observations on some of the most important and least understood\r\npoints in the practice of wood engraving, and to illustrate them with\r\nexamples, rather than to enter into minute details, which would be\r\nuninteresting to the general reader, and useless to the learner who has\r\nmade any progress in the art. The person who wishes to acquire a\r\nknowledge of wood engraving, with the view of practising it\r\nprofessionally, must generally be guided by his own judgment and\r\nfeeling; for he who requires the aid of rules and examples in every\r\npossible case will never attain excellence. A learner ought not to put\r\nmuch trust in what is said about the beautiful wood-cuts--or _plates_,\r\nas some critics call them--which appear in modern publications. He ought\r\nto examine for himself, and not pin his faith to ephemeral\r\ncommendations, which are often the customary acknowledgment for a\r\npresentation copy of the work. It is not unusual to find very ordinary\r\nwood-cuts praised as displaying the very perfection of the art, while\r\nothers of much greater merit are entirely overlooked.\r\n\r\nThe person who wishes to excel as a wood engraver,--that is, to display\r\nin his cuts the knowledge and feeling of an artist, as well as the\r\nmechanical dexterity of a workman,--ought always to bear in mind that\r\nthose who rank highest in modern times, not only as engravers, but also\r\nas designers on wood, have generally adopted the simplest means of\r\neffecting their purpose, and have never introduced unmeaning\r\ncross-hatchings, when working from their own drawings, merely to display\r\ntheir skill in execution. In representing a peasant supping his\r\nporridge, they have not spent a day on the figure, and two in delicately\r\nengraving the bowl. It may almost be said that Bewick never employed\r\ncross-hatchings; for, in the two or three instances in which he\r\nintroduced such lines, it has been rather for the sake of experiment\r\nthan to improve the appearance of the cut. Though one of the finest\r\nspecimens of this kind of work ever executed on wood is to be found in\r\nMr. Harvey’s cut of Dentatus, yet, on other occasions, when he engraved\r\nhis own designs, he seldom introduced cross-hatchings when he could\r\naccomplish the same object by simpler means. A wood engraving, viewed as\r\na _work of art_, is _not_ good in proportion as many of its parts have\r\nthe appearance of fine lace. Bewick’s birds and tail-pieces are not, in\r\nmy opinion, less excellent because they do not display so much _work_ as\r\na modern wood-cut which contains numerous cross-hatchings. Several of\r\nthe best French designers on wood of the present day appear to have\r\nformed erroneous opinions on this subject; and hence we find in many of\r\ntheir designs much of the engraver’s time spent in the execution of\r\nparts which are unimportant, while others, where expression or feeling\r\nought to be shown, are treated in a careless manner. Many of their\r\ndesigns seem to have been made rather to test the patience of the\r\nengraver as a _workman_ than to display his ability as an _artist_. The\r\nfollowing cut, from a cast of a part of the Death of Dentatus, is\r\nintroduced to show in how simple and effective a manner Mr. Harvey has\r\nrepresented the shield of the hero. An inferior artist would be very\r\nlikely to represent such an object by means of complicated lines, which,\r\nwhile they would be less effective, would require nearly a week to\r\nengrave.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nConsidering the number of wood engravings that are yearly executed in\r\nthis country, it is rather surprising that there should hitherto have\r\nbeen so few persons capable of making a good drawing on wood. Till\r\nwithin the last few years, it might be said that there was probably not\r\nmore than one _artist_ in the kingdom possessing a knowledge of design\r\nwho professionally devoted himself to making drawings on the block for\r\nwood engravers. Whenever a good original design is wanted, there are\r\nstill but few persons to whom the English wood engraver can apply with\r\nthe certainty of obtaining it; for though some of our most distinguished\r\npainters have occasionally furnished designs to be engraved on wood, it\r\nhas mostly been as a matter of especial favour to an individual who had\r\nan interest in the work in which such designs were to appear. In this\r\nrespect we are behind our French neighbours; the more common kind of\r\nFrench wood-cuts containing figures are much superior to our own of the\r\nsame class; the drawing is much more correct, more attention is paid to\r\ncostume, and in the details we perceive the indications of much greater\r\nknowledge of art than is generally to be found in the productions of our\r\nsecond-rate occasional designers on wood. It cannot be said that this\r\ndeficiency results from want of encouragement; for a designer on wood,\r\nof even moderate abilities, is better paid for his drawings than a\r\nsecond-rate painter is for his pictures. The truth is, that a taste for\r\ncorrect drawing has hitherto not been sufficiently cultivated in\r\nEngland: our artists are painters before they can draw; and hence,\r\ncomparatively few can make a good design on wood. They require the aid\r\nof positive colours to deceive the eye, and prevent it from resting upon\r\nthe defects of their drawing. It is therefore of great importance that a\r\nwood engraver should have some knowledge of drawing himself, in order\r\nthat he may be able to correct many of the defects that are to be found\r\nin the commoner kind of subjects sent to him to be engraved.\r\n\r\nIn the execution of subjects which require considerable time, but little\r\nmore than the exercise of mechanical skill, it is frequently advisable\r\nto adopt the principle of _the division of labour_, and have the work\r\nperformed, as it were, by instalments, allotting to each person that\r\nportion of the subject which he is likely to execute best. In this\r\nmanner the annexed cut of Rouen Cathedral has been engraved by four\r\ndifferent persons; and the result of their joint labours is such a\r\nwork as not even the best engraver of the four could have executed by\r\nhimself. Each having to do but a little, and that of the kind of work in\r\nwhich he excelled, has worked _con amore_, and finished his task before\r\nhe became weary of it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ROUEN CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\nThough copper-plate engraving has a great advantage over wood when\r\napplied to the execution of maps, in consequence of the greater delicacy\r\nthat can be given to the different shades and lines, indicating hills,\r\nrivers, and the boundaries of districts, and also from the number of\r\nnames that can be introduced, and from the comparative facility of\r\nexecuting them; yet, as maps engraved on copper, however simple they may\r\nbe, require to be printed separately, by means of a rolling-press, the\r\nunavoidable expense frequently renders it impossible to give such maps,\r\neven when necessary, in books published at a low price. Under such\r\ncircumstances, where little more than outlines, with the course of\r\nrivers, and comparatively few names, are required, wood engraving\r\npossesses an advantage over copper, as such maps can be executed at a\r\nvery moderate expense, and printed with the letter-press of the work for\r\nwhich they are intended. As the names in maps engraved on wood are the\r\nmost difficult parts of the subject, the method of drilling holes in the\r\nblock and inserting the names in type--as was adopted in the maps to\r\nSebastian Munster’s Cosmography, Basle, 1550,[IX-22]--has recently been\r\nrevived. The names in the outline maps contained in the Penny Cyclopædia\r\nare inserted in this manner. Had those maps not been engraved on wood,\r\nit would have been impossible that any could have been given in the\r\nwork, as the low price at which it is published would not have allowed\r\nof their being engraved on copper, and, consequently, printed by means\r\nof a rolling-press at an additional expense.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-22: Some account of the maps in Sebastian Munster’s\r\n    Cosmography is previously given at page 204, and page 417.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen, however, a map is of small dimensions, and several names in\r\nletters of comparatively large size are required to be given, this\r\nmethod of piercing the block can scarcely be applied without great risk\r\nof its breaking to pieces under the press, in consequence of its being\r\nweakened in parts by the holes drilled through it being so near\r\ntogether.[IX-23] This inconvenience, however, may be remedied by\r\nengraving the names in _intaglio_ where they are most numerous, and\r\nafterwards cutting a _tint_ over them, so that when printed they may\r\nappear white on a dark ground. Other names beyond the boundary of the\r\nmap can be inserted, where necessary, in type. The preceding skeleton\r\nmap of England and Wales, showing the divisions of the counties and the\r\ncourse of the principal rivers, has been executed in this manner: all\r\nthe names on the land, and the courses of the rivers, were first\r\nengraved on the smooth surface of the block in _intaglio_--in less than\r\na third of the time which would have been required to engrave them in\r\nrelief; the tint was next cut; and lastly, the block was pierced, and\r\nall the other names inserted in type, with the exception of the word\r\n“ENGLAND” in the title, which was engraved in the same manner as the\r\nnames on the land.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-23: When there is any danger of the block splitting\r\n    from this cause, it is best to have a cast taken from it, as by\r\n    this means the whole is obtained of one solid piece.]\r\n\r\nAs what has been previously said about the practice of the art relates\r\nentirely to engraving where the lines are of the same height, or in the\r\nsame plane, and when the impression is supposed to be obtained by the\r\npressure of a flat surface, I shall now proceed to explain the practice\r\nof lowering, by which operation the surface of the block is either\r\nscraped away from the centre towards the sides, or, as may be required,\r\nhollowed out in other places. The object of thus lowering a block is,\r\nthat the lines in such places may be less exposed to pressure in\r\nprinting, and thus appear lighter than if they were of the same height\r\nas the others. This method, though it has been claimed as a modern\r\ninvention, is of considerable antiquity, having been practised in 1538,\r\nas has been previously observed at page 462. Instances of lowering are\r\nvery frequent in cuts engraved by Bewick; but until within the last five\r\nor six years the practice was not resorted to by south-country\r\nengravers. It is absolutely necessary that wood-cuts intended to be\r\nprinted by a steam-press should be lowered in such parts as are to\r\nappear light; for, as the pressure on the cut proceeds from the even\r\nsurface of a metal cylinder covered with a blanket, there is no means of\r\n_helping_ a cut, as is generally done when printed by a hand-press, by\r\nmeans of _overlays_. Overlaying consists in pasting pieces of paper\r\neither on the front or at the back of the outer tympan, immediately over\r\nsuch parts of the block as require to be printed dark; and the effect of\r\nthis is to increase the action of the platten on those parts, and to\r\ndiminish it on such as are not overlaid. When lowered blocks are printed\r\nat a common press, it is necessary that a blanket should be used in the\r\ntympans, in order that the paper may be pressed into the hollowed or\r\nlowered parts, and the lines thus _brought up_. The application of the\r\nsteam-press to printing lowered wood-cuts may be considered as an epoch\r\nin the history of wood engraving. Wood-cuts were first printed _by a\r\nsteam-press_ at Messrs. Clowes and Sons’ establishment,[IX-24] and since\r\nthat time _lowering_ has been more generally practised than at any\r\nformer period.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-24: The first work containing lowered cuts printed by\r\n    a steam-press was that on Cattle, published in numbers, under the\r\n    superintendence of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful\r\n    Knowledge, 1832.]\r\n\r\nBy means of simply lowering the edges of a block, so that the surface\r\nshall be convex instead of plane, the lines are made to diminish in\r\nstrength as they recede from the centre until they become gradually\r\nblended with the white paper on which the cut is printed. This is the\r\nmost simple mode of lowering, and is now frequently adopted in such cuts\r\nas are termed _vignettes_,--that is, such as are not bounded by definite\r\nlines surrounding them in the manner of a border. In the preceding cut,\r\nrepresenting a group from Sir David Wilkie’s painting of the Village\r\nFestival, in the National Gallery, the light appearance of the lines\r\ntowards the edges has been produced in this manner.\r\n\r\nMr. Landseer, in his Lectures on Engraving, observes that hard edges are\r\nincident to wood-cut vignettes. He was not aware of the means by which\r\nthis objectionable appearance could be remedied. The following are his\r\nobservations on this subject: “A principal beauty in most vignettes\r\nconsists in the delicacy with which they appear to relieve from the\r\nwhite paper on which they are printed. The objects of which vignettes\r\nconsist, themselves forming the boundary of the composition, their\r\nextremities should for the most part be tenderly blended--be almost\r\nmelted, as it were, into the paper, or ground. Now, in printing with the\r\nletter-press, the pressure is rather the strongest at the extremities of\r\nthe engraving, where we wish it to be weakest, and it is so from the\r\nunavoidable swelling of the damp paper on which the impressions are\r\nworked, and the softness of the blankets in the tympans of the press.\r\nHence, hard, instead of soft edges, are incident to vignettes engraven\r\non wood, which all the care of the printer, with all the modern accuracy\r\nof his machine, can rarely avoid.”\r\n\r\nMr. Landseer’s objection to vignettes engraved on wood applies only to\r\nsuch as are engraved on a plane surface, since by lowering the block\r\ntowards the edges, lines gradually blending with the white paper can be\r\nobtained with the greatest facility. For the representation of such\r\nsubjects,--supposing that their principal beauty consists in “the\r\ndelicacy with which they appear to relieve from the white paper,”--wood\r\nengraving is as well adapted as engraving on copper or steel. Though it\r\nis certainly desirable that the lines in a vignette should gradually\r\nbecome blended with the colour of the paper, yet something more is\r\nrequired in an engraving of this kind, whether on wood or on metal. Much\r\ndepends on its form harmonizing with the composition of the subject:\r\na beautiful drawing reduced to an irregular shape, and having the edges\r\nmerely softened, will not always constitute a good vignette. Of this we\r\nhave but too many instances in modern copper-plate engravings, as well\r\nas wood-cuts. Of all modern artists J. M. W. Turner, R.A., and W. Harvey\r\nappear to excel in giving to their vignettes a form suitable to the\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may not be out of place to say a few words here on the\r\noriginal meaning of the word _vignette_, which is now generally used to\r\nsignify either a wood-cut or a copper-plate engraving which is not\r\ninclosed by definite lines forming a border. The word is French, and is\r\nsynonymous with the Latin _viticula_, which means a little vine, or a\r\nvine shoot, such as is here represented.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: C]\r\n\r\nCapital letters in ancient manuscripts were called by old writers\r\n_viticulæ_, or _vignettes_, in consequence of their being frequently\r\nornamented with flourishes in the manner of vine branches or shoots. The\r\nletter C, forming the commencement of this paragraph, is an example of\r\nan old vignette; it is copied from a manuscript apparently of the\r\nthirteenth century, formerly belonging to the monastery of Durham, but\r\nnow in the British Museum. Subsequently the word was used to signify any\r\nlarge ornament at the top of a page; in the seventeenth century all\r\nkinds of printer’s ornaments, such as flowers, head and tail-pieces,\r\nwere generally termed vignettes; and more recently the word has been\r\nused to express all kinds of wood-cuts or copper-plate engravings which,\r\nlike the group from the Village Festival, are not inclosed within a\r\ndefinite border. Rabelais uses the word to denote certain ornaments of\r\ngoldsmith’s work on the scabbard of a sword; and our countryman Lydgate\r\nthus employs it in his Troy Book to denote the sculptured foliage and\r\ntracery at the sides of a window:\r\n\r\n  “And if I should rehearsen by and by\r\n  The corve knots, by craft and masonry,\r\n  The fresh embowing with virges right as lines,\r\n  And the housing full of backewines,\r\n  The rich coining, the lusty battlements,\r\n  _Vinettes_ running in casements.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustrations:\r\n  O\r\n  Q\r\n  H\r\n  I\r\n  E\r\n  F\r\n  F\r\n  D\r\n  G\r\n  V\r\n  B]\r\n\r\nThe additional specimens of ornamental capitals on the preceding page\r\nare chiefly taken from Shaw’s Alphabets, in which will be found a great\r\nvariety of capitals of all ages.\r\n\r\nBefore introducing any examples of concave lowering in the middle of a\r\ncut, it seems necessary to give first a familiar illustration of the\r\nprinciple, in order that what is subsequently said upon this subject may\r\nbe the more readily understood.--The crown-piece of George IV., which\r\nevery reader can refer to, will afford the necessary illustrations. As\r\nthe head of the King on the obverse, and the figures of St. George, the\r\nhorse, and the dragon, on the reverse, are in _relief_,--that is, higher\r\nthan the field,--it is evident, that if the coin were printed, each side\r\nseparately, by means of pressure from an even surface, whether plane or\r\ncylindrical, covered with a yielding material, such as a blanket or\r\nwoollen cloth, so as to press the paper against the field or lower\r\nparts, the impressions would appear as follows,--that is, with the parts\r\nin relief darkest, and the lower proportionably lighter from their being\r\nless exposed to pressure.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: IMPRESSIONS FROM A SURFACE WITH THE FIGURES IN\r\n  RELIEF.]\r\n\r\nIf casts be taken of each side of the same coin, the parts which in the\r\noriginal are raised, or in _relief_, will then be concave, or in\r\n_intaglio_;[IX-25] and if such casts be printed in the manner of\r\nwood-cuts, the impressions will appear as in the opposite page,--that\r\nis, the field being now highest will appear positively black, while the\r\nfigures now in _intaglio_, or _lowered_, as I should say when speaking\r\nof a wood-cut, will appear lighter in proportion to the concavity of the\r\ndifferent parts.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-25: The _casts_ are precisely the same as the _dies_\r\n    from which the coin is struck.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: IMPRESSIONS FROM A SURFACE WITH THE FIGURES LOWERED,\r\n  OR IN INTAGLIO.]\r\n\r\nUpon a knowledge of the principle here exemplified the practice of\r\nlowering in wood engraving entirely depends. When a block is properly\r\nlowered, there is no occasion for overlays; and when cuts are to be\r\nprinted at a steam-press,--where such means to increase the pressure in\r\nsome parts and diminish it in others cannot be employed without great\r\nloss of time,--it becomes absolutely necessary that the blocks should be\r\nlowered in the parts where it is intended that the lines should appear\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nIn order that a cut should be printed properly without overlays, either\r\nat a common press with a blanket in the tympans, or at a steam-press\r\nwhere the cylinder is covered with woollen cloth, it is necessary that\r\nthe parts intended to appear light should be lowered before the lines\r\nseen upon them are engraved; and the mode of proceeding in this case is\r\nas follows:--The designer being aware of the manner in which the cut is\r\nto be printed, and understanding the practice of lowering, first makes\r\nthe drawing on the block in little more than outline,[IX-26] and washes\r\nin with flake-white the parts which it is necessary to lower. The block\r\nis then sent to the engraver, who, with an instrument resembling a\r\nsharp-edged burnisher, or with a flat tool or chisel, scrapes or pares\r\naway the wood in the parts indicated. When the lowering is completed,\r\nthe designer finishes the drawing, and the cut is engraved. It is\r\nnecessary to observe, that unless the person who makes the drawing on\r\nthe block perfectly understand the principle of lowering, and the\r\npurposes for which it is intended, he will never be able to design\r\nproperly a subject intended to be printed by a steam-press.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-26: If the drawing were finished, the lines on the\r\n    parts intended to be light would necessarily be effaced in\r\n    lowering the block in such parts.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen an object is to be represented dark upon a light ground, or upon\r\nmiddle tint, the first operation in beginning to lower the block is to\r\ncut a delicate white outline round the dark object, and proceed with a\r\nflat tool or a scraper, as may be most convenient, to take a thin\r\nshaving or paring off those parts on which the background or middle tint\r\nis to be engraved. The extent to which the block must be lowered will\r\ndepend on the degree of lightness intended to be given to such parts. In\r\nBewick’s time, when the pressmen used leather balls to ink the cuts and\r\ntypes, it was only necessary to take a very thin shaving off the block\r\nin order to produce the desired effect; as such balls, from the want of\r\nelasticity in the leather, which was comparatively hard and unyielding,\r\nwould only touch lightly such parts as were below the level of the other\r\nlines and the face of the types: had the block been lowered to any\r\nconsiderable depth, such parts would not have received any ink, and\r\nconsequently would not have shown the lines engraved on them in the\r\nimpression. In the present day, when composition rollers are used, it is\r\nnecessary to lower the parts intended to appear light to a much greater\r\ndepth than formerly;[IX-27] as such rollers, in consequence of their\r\ngreater elasticity, are pressed, in the process of inking, to a\r\nconsiderably greater depth between the lines of a cut than the old\r\nleather balls. The preceding cut--a Shepherd’s Dog, drawn by\r\nW. Harvey,--is printed from a block in which both the fore-ground and\r\ndistance are lowered to give greater effect to the animal. If such a\r\ncut, printed in the same page with types, as it appears here, were inked\r\nwith leather balls, a considerable portion of the lowered parts would\r\nnot be visible. This cut illustrates the principle of printing from a\r\nsurface--such as that of a coin--in which the head or figure is in\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-27: In cuts printed by a steam-press it not\r\n    unfrequently happens that lowering to the depth of the sixteenth\r\n    part of an inch scarcely produces a perceptible difference in the\r\n    strength of the impression. In cuts inked with leather balls, and\r\n    printed at the common press, the lines in parts lowered to this\r\n    depth would not be visible.]\r\n\r\nIn the next cut, an Egret, from a drawing by W. Harvey, the figure of\r\nthe bird appears white on a dark ground,--the reverse of the cut of the\r\nShepherd’s Dog,--and is an example of lowering the block in the middle\r\nin the manner of a die with the figures in intaglio, or a cast from a\r\ncoin in which the head or figures are in relief.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn a cut of this kind the general form of the principal object required\r\nto be light is first lowered out, and the drawing of the figure being\r\nnext completed upon the hollowed part, the engraver proceeds to cut the\r\nlines, beginning with the back-ground and finishing the principal object\r\nlast. In cutting the lines in the hollowed part, the engraver uses such\r\na tool, slightly curving upwards towards the point, as has been\r\npreviously described at page 579. In lowering the principal object in a\r\ncut of this kind, the greatest attention is necessary in order that the\r\nhollowed parts may be gradually concave, and also of a sufficient depth.\r\nIn performing this operation, the engraver is solely guided by his own\r\njudgment; and unless he have some practical knowledge of the extent to\r\nwhich composition balls and rollers will penetrate in such hollowed\r\nparts, it is almost impossible that he should execute his work in a\r\nproper manner;--should he succeed, it will only be by chance, like a\r\nperson shooting at a mark blindfolded. In such cases, though no special\r\nrules can be given, it is necessary to observe that the part lowered\r\nwill, in proportion to its area, be exposed to receive nearly the same\r\nquantity of ink, and the same degree of pressure, as the lines on a\r\nlevel with the types. The _depth_ to which such parts require to be\r\nlowered will consequently depend on their extent; and the degree of\r\nlightness intended to be given to the lines engraved on them. This,\r\nhowever, will be best illustrated by the annexed diagram. If, for\r\ninstance, the part to be lowered extend from A to B, it will be\r\nnecessary to hollow the block to the depth indicated by the dotted line\r\nA c B. Should it extend from A to D, it will require to be lowered to\r\nthe depth of the dotted line A e D in order to obtain the same degree of\r\nlightness in colour as in the lowered part A c B of less area,--that is,\r\nsupposing the engraved lines in both cases to be of equal delicacy.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs overlaying such delicately engraved cuts as require the greatest\r\nattention in printing occupies much time, and lays the press idle during\r\nthe process, the additional sum charged per sheet for works containing a\r\nnumber of such cuts has frequently operated to the disadvantage of wood\r\nengraving, by causing its productions to be dispensed with in many books\r\nwhere they might have been introduced with great advantage, both as\r\ndirect and incidental illustrations. It is, therefore, of great\r\nimportance to adapt the art of wood engraving to the execution of cuts\r\nof all kinds, whether comparatively coarse or of the greatest delicacy,\r\nso that they may be properly printed at the least possible expense.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe preceding cut, with the two following, which have all been lowered,\r\nwould, if printed at a steam-press, appear nearly as well as they do in\r\nthe present work, where they have been printed by means of a common\r\npress with a blanket. But such a subject--a winter-piece, with an ass\r\nand her foal standing near an old outhouse,--cannot be properly\r\nrepresented without lowering the block; for no overlaying would cause\r\nthe lines indicating the thatch on the houses and the stacks, as seen\r\nthrough the snow, to appear so soft as they now do.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn this cut of a Salmon Trout, with a view of Bywell Lock, on the river\r\nTyne, both the fore-ground and the distance are lowered; the objects\r\nwhich appear comparatively dark in those parts are the least reduced,\r\nwhile those that appear lightest are such as are lowered to the greatest\r\nextent. The back of the fish, which appears dark in the impression, is\r\nin the block like a ridge, which is gradually lowered in a hollow curve\r\ntowards the lower line. In such a cut as this, particular care ought to\r\nbe taken not to lower too much those parts which come into immediate\r\ncontact with a strong black outline, such as the back of the Salmon; for\r\nwhere the lowering in such parts is too abrupt, there is great risk of\r\nthe lines engraved on them not being _brought up_, and thus causing the\r\nfigure in relief to appear surrounded with a white line, as in the\r\nimpressions from the crown-piece at page 618.\r\n\r\nBy means of lowering, the black pony, on which a boy is seen riding, in\r\nthe following cut, is much more effectively represented, than if the\r\nwhole subject were engraved on a plane surface. The grey horse, and the\r\nlight jacket of the rider, the ground, the garden wall, and the lightest\r\nof the trees, are all lowered in order to give greater effect to the\r\npony.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nA cut which is properly lowered may not only be printed by a steam-press\r\nwithout overlays, but will also afford a much greater number of good\r\nimpressions than one of the same kind engraved on a plane surface; for\r\nthe more delicate parts, being lower than those adjacent to them, are\r\nthus saved from too much pressure, without the necessity of increasing\r\nit in other places. The preceding cut will serve to show the advantages\r\nof lowering in this respect. It was originally engraved, from a drawing\r\nby William Harvey, for the Treatise on Cattle, published under the\r\ndirection of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. Though\r\ntwelve thousand impressions have already been printed from it by means\r\nof Messrs. Clowes and Sons’ steam-press, it has not sustained the\r\nslightest injury in any part; and the present impression is scarcely\r\ninferior to the first proof. With the exception of clearing out the ink\r\nin two or three places, it has required no preparation or retouching to\r\ngive it its present appearance. Had such a work as the Treatise on\r\nCattle been printed at a common press without the blocks having been\r\nlowered, the cost of printing would have been at least double the sum\r\ncharged by Messrs. Clowes; and the engraving, after so great a number of\r\nimpressions had been taken, would have been considerably injured, if not\r\nquite spoiled.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn complicated subjects, consisting of many figures, and in which the\r\nlight and shade are much diversified, it becomes necessary to combine\r\nthe two principles of lowering, which have been separately illustrated\r\nby the Dog and the Egret, and to adapt them according to circumstances,\r\nforming some parts convex, and making others concave, respectively, as\r\nthe objects engraved on them are to appear dark or light. In order to\r\nillustrate this process of combined lowering, I have chosen a subject\r\nfrom Rembrandt--the Descent from the Cross--in which several figures are\r\nintroduced, and in which the lights and shades are so much varied--in\r\nsome parts blended by a delicate middle tint, and in others strongly\r\ncontrasted--as to afford the greatest possible scope for the\r\nillustration of what is termed _lowering_ in a wood engraving.\r\n\r\nThe cut on the next page shows the appearance of an impression taken\r\nfrom the block before a single line had been engraved, except the\r\n_white_ outline bounding the figures. All that is here seen has been\r\neffected by the flat tool and the scraper; the lightest parts are those\r\nthat are most concave, the darkest those that are most convex. The parts\r\nwhich have the appearance of a middle tint are such as are reduced to a\r\nmedium between the strongest light and the darkest shade. The impression\r\nin its present state has very much the appearance of an unfinished\r\nmezzotint.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn order to render this example of complicated lowering more\r\nintelligible to those who have little knowledge of the subject, it seems\r\nnecessary to give a detailed account of the process, even at the risk of\r\nrepeating some previous explanations. In complicated as well as in\r\nsimple subjects intended to be lowered, the design is first drawn in\r\noutline on the wood. In such a subject as that which is here given, the\r\nDescent from the Cross, it is necessary to cut a delicate _white_\r\noutline--such as is seen in the ladder--round all those parts where the\r\ntrue outline appears dark against light, previous to lowering out those\r\nlight parts which come into immediate contact with such as are dark.\r\nWhen a white outline has been cut where required, a thin shaving is to\r\nbe taken off those parts which are intended to be a shade lighter than\r\nthe middle tints,--for instance, in the rays of light falling upon the\r\ncross, and in the lower part of the sky. After this, the light parts of\r\nthe ground and the figures are to be lowered; but, instead of taking a\r\nmere shaving off the latter, the depth to which they are to be hollowed\r\nout will depend on the form and size of the parts, and the strength of\r\nthe light intended to appear on them; and where a series of delicate\r\nlines are to run into _pure white_, great care must be taken that the\r\nwood be sufficiently _bevelled_ or rounded off to allow of their\r\nblending with the white, without their extremities forming a distinct\r\nline, more especially where rotundity is to be represented. In a block\r\nthus lowered, the parts intended to be lightest will be the most\r\nconcave, and those intended to be darkest the most in relief; and, when\r\nprinted, the impression will appear as in the following cut, in\r\nconsequence of the lowered parts, in proportion to their depth,\r\nreceiving both less ink and less pressure; while those that are to\r\nappear positively white are lowered to such an extent as to be neither\r\ntouched by the ink, nor exposed to the action of the platten or\r\ncylinder.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen the block has been thus prepared, the subject is drawn upon it in\r\ndetail, and the engraving of the lines proceeded with. The sky, and the\r\nlighter and more distant objects, should be engraved first: and care\r\nought to be taken not to get the lines too fine at the commencement,\r\nfor, should this happen, there is no remedy for the defect. By keeping\r\nthem comparatively strong, the darker objects can be executed in a\r\ncorresponding degree of boldness; and should the proof be generally too\r\ndark, the necessary alterations can be easily made. The above cut of the\r\nDescent from the Cross is printed from the finished block; all the\r\npositive lines here seen having been engraved subsequent to the process\r\nof lowering.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to observe that the process of engraving upon an uneven\r\nsurface--such as that of the lowered block of the Descent from the\r\nCross--is much more difficult than on a surface which is perfectly\r\nplane; for the graver in traversing such parts as are lowered is apt to\r\nlose its hold, and to slip in descending, while in ascending it is\r\nliable to take too much hold, and to _tear_ rather than to clearly cut\r\nout the wood in certain parts, thus rendering the raised lines rough at\r\nthe sides, and sometimes breaking them quite through. In order to remedy\r\nin some degree such inconveniences, it is necessary to use a graver\r\nslightly curving upwards towards the point.\r\n\r\nThe process of lowering, as previously explained, is peculiarly adapted\r\nto give the appearance of proper texture to objects of Natural History,\r\nand in particular to birds, where it is often so desirable to impart a\r\nsoft downy appearance to the plumage. Such softness can never be well\r\nrepresented by lines engraved on a perfectly level surface; for, however\r\nthin and fine they may be, they will always appear too distinct, and\r\nwant that softness which can only be obtained by lowering the block, and\r\nprinting it with a blanket in the tympans at a common press. Those who\r\nin engraving birds on a plane surface are fond of imitating the delicacy\r\nof copper-plate or steel engravings, always fail in their attempts to\r\nrepresent that soft appearance so peculiar to the plumage of birds,\r\nwhatever may be its colour. Bewick’s Birds, in this respect, have never\r\nbeen equalled; and the softness displayed in the plumage has been\r\nchiefly obtained by lowering, and thus preventing such parts receiving\r\ntoo much ink or too much pressure. The characteristic expression of the\r\nbird, and the variety of texture in the plumage, are not indeed entirely\r\ndependent on this process; but the appearance of softness, and the\r\ngeneral effect of the cut as a whole,--as exemplified in the Birds of\r\nBewick,--are not otherwise to be obtained. Any wood engraver who doubts\r\nthis, should attempt to copy, on an unlowered block, one of the best of\r\nBewick’s birds; on comparing a printed impression of his work with the\r\noriginal, he will be likely to discover that he has thought too highly\r\nof his own practice, and too lightly of Bewick’s.\r\n\r\nThough chiaro-scuro drawings can be faithfully copied by means of wood\r\nengraving; yet the art, as applied to the execution of such works, has\r\nmet with but little encouragement in this country, and has consequently\r\nbeen little practised. From 1754--the date of J. B. Jackson’s tract on\r\nthe Invention of Engraving and Printing in Chiaro-scuro--to 1819, when\r\nthe first part of Mr. Savage’s Hints on Decorative Printing was\r\npublished, the only chiaro-scuro wood engravings which appear to have\r\nbeen published in England were those executed about 1783, by an amateur\r\nof the name of John Skippe. The chiaro-scuros engraved by Mr. Skippe do\r\nnot appear to have been numerous; I have only seen three--St. John the\r\nEvangelist, St. Paul, and Hebe, all after drawings by Parmegiano. The\r\nlatter is printed from four blocks, and each of the others from three.\r\nIn point of execution, that of St. John is decidedly the best: it is\r\nmuch superior to any of the specimens given in J. B. Jackson’s work, and\r\nwill bear a comparison with some of the best chiaro-scuros of Nicholas\r\nLe Sueur.\r\n\r\nSavage’s Hints on Decorative Printing, in two parts, 1819-1823, contains\r\nseveral specimens, not only of chiaro-scuro wood engravings, but also of\r\nsubjects printed in positive colours from several wood-blocks, in\r\nimitation of coloured drawings. Some of the chiaro-scuros, properly so\r\ncalled, are well executed, though they generally seem too soft and\r\n_woolly_. The following are those which seem most worthy of notice:--A\r\nfemale Bacchante, from a bas-relief in the British Museum; Theseus, from\r\nthe statue in the Elgin Collection of Marbles, in the British Museum;\r\nCopy of a bust in marble in the British Museum; Bridge and Landscape;\r\nPassage-boats; and a River Scene. For the representation of such\r\nsubjects as the preceding, when drawn in sepia, wood engraving is\r\npeculiarly adapted.\r\n\r\nThe simplest manner of representing a chiaro-scuro drawing is by\r\nprinting a tint, with the lights cut out, from a second block, over the\r\nimpression of a cut engraved in the usual manner. Chiaro-scuros of this\r\nkind have the appearance of pen-and-ink drawings made on tinted paper,\r\nand heightened with touches of white. The illustrations to an edition of\r\nPuckle’s Club were thus printed in 1820,--the year after they had\r\nappeared printed in the usual manner in a new edition of the work--but\r\nmany of them are spoiled by the badly-chosen “fancy” colour of the tint.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the publication of the second part of Savage’s Hints,\r\nand the tinted illustrations of Puckle’s Club, no further attempts\r\nappear to have been made to improve or extend the practice of\r\nchiaro-scuro engraving and printing in colours till Mr. George Baxter\r\nturned his attention to the subject. His first attempts in chiaro-scuro\r\nengraving are to be found in a History of Sussex, printed by his father\r\nat Lewes, in 1835. Mr. Baxter tried various experiments, and at length\r\nsucceeded so much to his satisfaction, that he took out a patent for\r\nprinting in oil-colours. The manner in which he executes picture-prints\r\nin positive colours, after drawings or paintings in oil, is _nearly_ the\r\nsame as that in which Kirkall executed his chiaro-scuros. The ground,\r\nthe outlines, and the more minute details, are first printed in neutral\r\ntint from a plate engraved in aquatint; and over this impression the\r\nproper colours are printed from as many wood-blocks as there are\r\ndifferent tints. The best specimens of Mr. Baxter’s printing in\r\noil-colours, from wood-blocks over an aquatint ground, are to be found\r\nin the Pictorial Album, published by Chapman and Hall, 1837; and among\r\nthese the following appear to be most deserving of distinct\r\nenumeration:--Interior of the Lady Chapel, Warwick; Lugano; Verona; and\r\nJeannie Deans’s Interview with the Queen. In some of the most elaborate\r\nsubjects in this work, the colours have been communicated by not less\r\nthan twenty blocks, each separately printed. So far as regards the\r\nlandscapes, nothing of the same kind previously done will bear to be\r\ncompared with them. But since this period, Mr. Baxter has brought his\r\npeculiar art to still greater perfection, and both large and small\r\nexamples are to be met with abundantly. One of the most popular is his\r\n“Holy Trinity, after Raphael,” a small plate of which no fewer than\r\n700,000 copies have been sold. The subscribers to Bohn’s Scientific\r\nLibrary will find a good specimen in the View of Chimborazo, prefixed to\r\nHumboldt’s Views of Nature.\r\n\r\nAnother recent invention is that of “Knight’s Patent Illuminated Prints\r\nand Maps.” In every instance hitherto of surface-printing in colours,\r\neach colour, having a separate block, had to be worked off separately,\r\nwhich rendered such productions extremely expensive.[IX-28] The new\r\nprocess has one great advantage over all its predecessors, in cheapness,\r\nand the facility with which it can multiply impressions. The general\r\nnature of the process will be best understood from a description of the\r\nmode of completing a coloured print.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-28: Sir William Congreve’s mode of colour printing,\r\n    however, patented many years ago, and now practised by Mr. Charles\r\n    Whiting of Beaufort House, is one of the least expensive of all.\r\n    It consists in printing several colours at one time, and may be\r\n    thus described:--“A coloured design being made on a block, the\r\n    various colours are cut into their respective sections, like a\r\n    geographical puzzle, and placed in an ingeniously constructed\r\n    machine, which inks them separately, and prints them together. By\r\n    this mode speed is obtained in large operations, and the colours\r\n    are prevented from running into each other. It is extensively\r\n    applied to book-covers, decorative show-cards, the back of country\r\n    notes, and labels, where the object is to prevent forgery.”--_See\r\n    Bohn’s Lecture on Printing, page 104._]\r\n\r\nIn the first place, a subject is engraved upon wood in the usual manner,\r\nand the impression is coloured by a skilful artist. We will suppose four\r\nprincipal colours are introduced, red, blue, yellow, and brown. Separate\r\nand exact drawings of each colour are then made; and four polished\r\nplates are prepared, each plate carrying one colour. These four plates\r\nare then firmly fixed in an ingeniously contrived frame, or table,\r\nmoving upon the table of a common press, the motion being regulated by\r\nmachinery, which ensures the most exact register, after it has once been\r\nobtained, and affords the greatest facility in obtaining it. The colours\r\nare then applied to their respective plates in precisely the same manner\r\nas ink to type, by means of rollers; and four sheets of paper of the\r\nsize intended for the print (or, for convenience, one large sheet to be\r\nafterwards cut up) are then placed on the frisket, which is then turned\r\ndown on the plates, and the pull applied. The table is then turned one\r\nquarter round, and the process is repeated, till each colour has, in\r\nsuccession, been printed upon the four sheets. Six or seven colours are\r\nsometimes produced by the same process, and from the same plates, by\r\ncombination; and the union of two colours to produce a third is effected\r\nperfectly, in consequence of the rapidity of the process, which does not\r\nallow the colours to dry and become hard. The bright whites are, of\r\ncourse, formed by removing the surface in the requisite parts from all\r\nthe plates, and suffering the ground to appear. Eight, or indeed any\r\nnumber of colours, can be introduced by using another press, or presses;\r\nin which case the frisket with the sheet or sheets fixed, is passed from\r\none press to the other. The block of the drawing is always the last\r\nimpressed.\r\n\r\nFrom its extreme exactitude this invention seems peculiarly adapted for\r\ndesigns of patterns for shawls, ribbons, printed cottons, carpets, and\r\nsuch manufactures as have hitherto apparently been left to the fancy of\r\nthe workman, or his employers, who in matters of art have frequently\r\nquite as little taste as the workman.\r\n\r\nBut probably the most favourable field for the display of the\r\nperfections of this invention, would be in subjects where only light and\r\nshade, or at most what are called neutral tints, are required, such as\r\narchitectural drawings and sculptures, either statues or in relief. For\r\nsuch purposes the depth of tone obtainable, and the sharpness of the\r\nlights, seem peculiarly adapted.[IX-29]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-29: The best specimen of this art will be found in\r\n    Charles Knight’s Old England’s Worthies, a folio volume,\r\n    containing twelve large plates of Architecture and Costume,\r\n    printed in colours, and 240 portraits engraved on steel, folio\r\n    (now published by H. G. Bohn), 15_s._ The practice of the art has\r\n    not been continued, as it was only applicable to very large\r\n    editions (ten thousand and upwards), and was more expensive than\r\n    hand colouring where small editions were required. The machinery\r\n    has been sold off and destroyed.]\r\n\r\nWhat is termed metallic relief engraving consists in executing subjects\r\non plates of copper, or any other metal, in such a manner that the lines\r\nwhich form the impression shall be in relief, and thus allow of such\r\nplates being inked and printed in the same manner as a wood-cut. Since\r\nthe revival of wood engraving in this country several attempts have been\r\nmade to _etch_ in metallic relief, and thus save the time necessarily\r\nrequired to cut out all the lines in a wood engraving. In etching upon\r\ncopper, in order that the subject may be represented by lines _in\r\nrelief_,--the reverse of the usual procedure in copper-plate\r\nengraving,--and that the plate may be printed in the same manner as a\r\nwood-cut, there are several methods of proceeding. In one, the subject\r\nis _drawn_ upon the plate in Burgundy pitch, or any other substance\r\nwhich will resist the action of aquafortis, in the same manner as\r\ncopper-plate engravers in the ordinary process _stop out_ the parts\r\nintended to be white. When the substance in which the drawing is made\r\nbecomes _set_, or sufficiently hard, the plate is surrounded with a\r\n_wall_, as it is technically termed, and aquafortis being poured upon\r\nit, all the unprotected parts are corroded, and the drawing left in\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nThis was the method generally adopted by William Blake, an artist of\r\ngreat but eccentric genius, in the execution of his Songs of Innocence,\r\nthe Book of Thel,[IX-30] the Gates of Paradise, Urizen, and other works,\r\npublished between 1789 and 1800. The following account of the origin of\r\nthis new mode of engraving or etching in metallic relief, by corroding\r\nthe parts intended to appear white in the impression, is extracted from\r\nthe Life of William Blake, in Allan Cunningham’s Lives of British\r\nPainters, Sculptors, and Architects:--\r\n\r\n“He had made the sixty-five designs of his Songs of Innocence, and was\r\nmeditating, he said, on the best means of multiplying their resemblance\r\nin form and in hue; he felt sorely perplexed. At last he was made aware\r\nthat the spirit of his favourite brother Robert was in the room, and to\r\nthis celestial visitor he applied for counsel. The spirit advised him at\r\nonce: ‘Write,’ he said, ‘the poetry, and draw the designs upon the\r\ncopper, with a certain liquid, (which he named, and which Blake ever\r\nkept a secret,) then cut the plain parts of the plate down with\r\naquafortis, and this will give the whole, both poetry and figures, in\r\nthe manner of stereotype.’ The plan recommended by this gracious spirit\r\nwas adopted, the plates were engraved, and the work printed off. The\r\nartist then added a peculiar beauty of his own: he tinted both the\r\nfigures and the verse with a variety of colours, amongst which, while\r\nyellow prevails, the whole has a rich and lustrous beauty, to which I\r\nknow little that can be compared. The size of these prints is four and a\r\nhalf inches high by three inches wide. The original genius of Blake was\r\nalways confined, through poverty, to small dimensions. Sixty-five plates\r\nof copper were an object to him who had little money.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-30: The Book of Thel, which, with the titles,\r\n    consists of seven quarto pages of verse and figures engraved in\r\n    metallic relief, is dated 1789. A full list of the works of this\r\n    remarkable artist will be found in Bohn’s enlarged edition of\r\n    Lowndes’s Bibliographer’s Manual.]\r\n\r\nBlake subsequently executed, in the same manner, “the Gates of\r\nParadise,” consisting of sixteen small designs; and “Urizen,” consisting\r\nof twenty-seven designs. The size of the latter is four inches by six,\r\nand they are dated Lambeth, 1794. In 1800 he also engraved by a similar\r\nprocess, combined with the usual mode of etching _through_ a prepared\r\nground laid over the plate, two subjects to illustrate a song of his own\r\nwriting, which was printed with them also from metallic relief. The\r\ntitle of this song is “Little Tom the Sailor,” and the date is October\r\n5, 1800. It appears to have been a charitable contribution of Blake’s to\r\nthe “Widow Spicer of Folkstone,” the mother of little Tom; and we learn\r\nfrom the imprint at the bottom that it was printed for, and sold by her\r\nfor the benefit of her orphans.\r\n\r\nBlake’s metallic relief engravings were printed by himself by means of a\r\nrolling or copper-plate press, though the impression was obtained from\r\nthe lines in relief in the same manner as from a wood-cut. The only\r\ndifference in the printing consisted in the different manner in which\r\nthe pressure was applied. As it is difficult, according to Blake’s\r\nprocess, to corrode the large white parts to a depth sufficient to\r\nprevent their being touched by the dauber or ball in the process of\r\ninking, and thus presenting a soiled appearance in the impression, he\r\nwas accustomed to wipe the ink out where it had touched in the hollows.\r\nAs this occupied more time than the mere inking of the plate, his\r\nprogress in printing was necessarily slow.\r\n\r\nIn another mode of engraving in relief on a plate of copper, the plate\r\nis first covered with an etching ground in the usual manner, and to this\r\nground an outline of the subject is transferred by passing the plate\r\nwith a pencil-drawing above it through a rolling-press. The engraver\r\nthen proceeds to remove with his etching-point, or some other tool, as\r\nmay be necessary, all such parts as are intended to be _white_. When\r\nthis process, which may be termed _reverse etching_, is completed, the\r\nparts intended to be white are corroded by pouring aquafortis upon the\r\nplate in the usual manner, while the lines which represent the object\r\nremain in relief, in consequence of their being protected at the surface\r\nby the coating of etching ground.\r\n\r\nSeveral persons have made experiments in this mode of metallic relief\r\nengraving. It was tried by Bewick, and also by the late Robert Branston;\r\nbut they did not succeed to their satisfaction, and none of their\r\nproductions executed in this manner was ever submitted to the public.\r\nAbout twenty years ago, Mr. W. Lizars of Edinburgh appears to have\r\nturned his attention to the subject of metallic relief engraving, and to\r\nhave succeeded better than either Bewick or Branston. One of the\r\nearliest-published specimens of his engraving in this style is the\r\nportrait of Dr. Peter Morris, forming the frontispiece to Peter’s\r\nLetters to his Kinsfolk, printed at Edinburgh in 1819. This portrait has\r\nevery appearance of being executed by the process of reverse\r\netching,--that is, by first covering the plate with etching ground, and\r\nthen removing the parts that are to be white, and leaving the lines that\r\nare to appear black in relief. The plate was printed by a common\r\nprinting-press at the office of Ballantyne and Co. In the preface the\r\n“new invention” of Mr. Lizars is thus mentioned:--“The portrait of Dr.\r\nMorris is done in this new style; and, had the time permitted, the\r\nothers would have all been done so likewise. It is thrown off by the\r\ncommon printing-press, as the reader will observe--but this is only one\r\nof the distinguishing excellences of this new and splendid invention of\r\nMr. Lizars.”\r\n\r\nWithin the last three or four years several plans for executing\r\nengravings in metallic relief have been devised; and it has been\r\nprophesied of each, that it would in a short time totally supersede wood\r\nengraving. The projectors of those plans, however, seem to have taken\r\ntoo narrow a view of the subject; and to have thought that the mere\r\nnovelty of their invention was sufficient to ensure it success. They\r\nappear not to have considered, that it was necessary that their metallic\r\nrelief casts should not only be cheaper than wood-cuts, but that they\r\nshould be also as well executed.\r\n\r\nMr. Woone has taken out a patent for his invention, and the principle\r\nupon which it is founded is that of taking a cast from a copper-plate,\r\nwhereby the lines engraved in _intaglio_ are in the cast in _relief_.\r\nHis process of metallic relief engraving is as follows:--A smooth plate\r\nof metal is covered with a coating of plaster of Paris, about equal in\r\nthickness to the depth to which the lines are cut in engraving on copper\r\nor steel. Upon this surface of plaster the engraver, with a fine point,\r\nas in etching, cuts the lines of the subject _through_ to the plate\r\nbelow. When this plaster etching is completed, a cast is taken from it\r\nin type-metal; and, after being _cleared out_, the subject in metallic\r\nrelief can be printed at a common press in the manner of a wood-cut.\r\nAccording to this plan only _one_ cast can be taken of each subject, as\r\nthe plaster is destroyed during the process, so that there is nothing\r\nleft from which a second mould can be made, as in the case of a\r\nwood-cut. The chief advantage of this invention consists in the lines\r\nbeing of equal height in the cast, in consequence of their being etched\r\nthrough the plaster to the level surface of the plate beneath. As the\r\ncoating of plaster is, however, extremely thin, it is generally\r\nnecessary to clear out with a graver the interstices of the cast in\r\norder to prevent their being touched by the inking roller.\r\n\r\nA Mr. Schonberg has also made several experiments in metallic relief\r\nengraving by means of etching on stone, and afterwards taking a cast\r\nfrom his work. Though he has been for several years endeavouring to\r\nperfect his invention, he has not up to this time succeeded in producing\r\nanything which it would be fair to criticise.\r\n\r\nMany of the cuts of trees and shrubs in Loudon’s Arboretum et Fruticetum\r\nBritannicum are printed from casts in metallic relief, executed by Mr.\r\nRobert Branston. The mode of procedure, according to Mr. Branston’s\r\nmethod, is extremely simple; the subject is first etched on copper, and\r\nbit in by aquafortis in the usual manner; and from this etching a cast\r\nis afterwards taken in type-metal. As the plate is not corroded to an\r\nequal depth in every part, it is necessary to rub on a stone the faces\r\nof the casts thus obtained in order to reduce the raised lines to the\r\nsame level. There is also another inconvenience that attends casts in\r\nmetallic relief taken from an etched copper-plate; for, as the\r\naquafortis acts laterally as well as vertically, it is difficult to\r\ncorrode the lines to a sufficient depth, without at the same time\r\ngetting them too thick. It is hence necessary to clear out many of the\r\nhollow parts of such casts with a graver, in order to prevent their\r\nbeing touched by the balls or inking-roller, and thus giving to the\r\nimpression a soiled appearance.\r\n\r\nCasts in metallic relief from etchings always appear coarse; and, from\r\nthe experiments hitherto made, it seems impossible to execute _fine_\r\nwork in this manner. So far as relates to cheapness, such casts, however\r\nwell they may be executed, being of a level surface, cannot be printed\r\nproperly by a steam-press in the manner of lowered blocks, or casts from\r\nlowered blocks. For a work of extensive circulation, printed by means of\r\na steam-press, a lowered block, or a cast from it, would be cheaper at\r\nfive pounds, than a cast from an etching at four, even admitting that\r\nboth were equally well executed.\r\n\r\nThe principal feature in Mr. C. Hancock’s patent metallic relief\r\nengraving, which is quite original, is, that subjects resembling\r\nmezzotints can be inserted and printed with the text in the same manner\r\nas wood engravings. A mezzotint plate, if printed in the usual manner\r\nprevious to being engraved upon, would appear black. On the other hand,\r\nif submitted to the same kind of printing as a wood-cut, it would\r\nscarcely discolour the paper. Upon this plate Mr. Hancock draws his\r\nsubject with a broad steel point or burnisher, which polishes down the\r\nsmall prominences to a smooth surface in proportion to the pressure used\r\nin drawing. In proportion as the surface becomes smooth, so does it\r\nprint dark, and have the appearance of a mezzotint. The reader will\r\nperceive that, according to this plan, Mr. Hancock can take a proof of\r\nhis subject at any time, and procure either _dark_ or _light_ at\r\npleasure, as the subject may appear to require it. The sparkling light\r\ncan be touched in with the graver, in the same manner as on wood; so\r\nthat such touches appear much sharper than in common mezzotint, where\r\nthe lights are got by burnishing. As Mr. Hancock has not as yet brought\r\nanything before the public, it would be unfair to anticipate him, by\r\nintroducing anything more in this place than a description of his\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nWood engraving is necessarily confined, by the size of the wood, to the\r\nexecution of subjects of comparatively small dimensions; and this\r\nlimitation, together with the difficulty of printing even tints in\r\npositive colours, have combined to prevent it from being made\r\nextensively available in the production of works in chiaro-scuro, of\r\nlarge size, by the ordinary modes of surface-printing. Latterly,\r\nhowever, the demand which the progress of education has created for\r\nmaps, school prints, elementary examples of fine art, and illustrations\r\n_on a large scale_ for the illustrated newspapers, having called the\r\nattention of artists to the subject, many attempts have been made, and\r\nin some cases with success, to produce relief engravings on metal; and\r\nalso to combine that mode of engraving with analogous apparatus for the\r\nproduction of works in tints or colours, separate, combined, or mixed\r\nwith line plates, in such degrees as particular cases might require.\r\nSeveral of these persons have been already named, and their processes\r\ndescribed; it only therefore remains to state, that Mr. Stephen Sly, in\r\nconnexion with other artists, has for some years past been steadily\r\nengaged in making a series of experiments for giving a practical value,\r\nby various inventions, to the discoveries and experience of their\r\npredecessors in the art; and with every prospect of success. Their\r\nmethod of procedure is: 1. To produce a finished drawing, in simple or\r\ncrossed lines, with etching varnish on a plate prepared for the purpose;\r\n2. To bite away, with a compound acid, the spaces between the varnish\r\nlines; and 3. To deepen and finish the work so produced, by the use of\r\nengraving tools, in the ordinary manner. The great difficulties in the\r\nway of these apparently simple operations have been, 1. To cast _sound_\r\nand durable plates of a large size, and of a texture sufficiently\r\ncompact to produce sharp lines by the etching process, and at the same\r\ntime soft enough to permit the surfaces to be lowered, and the cutting\r\nto be executed with facility; 2. To remove the oxide formed by the\r\ncombination of the acid with the metal from between the lines; and 3. To\r\ncarry the biting to a depth sufficiently great to permit the plate, with\r\nthe addition of a small quantity of graver-work, to yield a clear\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nMetallic relief engraving has not unfrequently been practised at Paris\r\nof late years. I have now lying before me an impression from a plate\r\nengraved in this manner by Messrs. Best, Andrew, and Leloir, of that\r\ncity. The subject is a wild turkey, and it was engraved about three\r\nyears ago for Mr. Audubon. Though it is the best specimen of metallic\r\nrelief engraving that has come under my notice, I am yet of opinion that\r\nthe subject could be better engraved on wood, and at a less cost.\r\nOrnaments and borders are sometimes engraved on solid brass by means of\r\nchisels and gravers in the same manner as a wood-cut. The head of\r\nBuchanan, and the border on the wrapper of Blackwood’s Magazine, were\r\nengraved on brass in this manner, more than twenty years ago, by Messrs.\r\nVizetelly, Branston, and Co. They were originally engraved on wood by\r\nBewick. The greater durability of ornaments engraved on brass,\r\ncompensates for their additional cost. The _cheapest_ mode, however, is\r\nto have such ornaments first engraved on wood, and casts afterwards\r\ntaken from them in type metal. One great objection to _cutting_ on metal\r\nwith the graver is, that the metal _cuts the paper_ in printing from it.\r\n\r\nDuplicates of wood engravings may be readily obtained by means of casts\r\nfrom the original blocks; and within the last twenty years, the practice\r\nof thus multiplying subjects originally engraved on wood, has become\r\nvery prevalent both in this country and in France. Casts can be obtained\r\nfrom wood engravings by two different processes, and both are practised\r\nby two or three stereotype printers, to whom this business is usually\r\nentrusted. By the one mode, a mould is first made from the block in\r\nplaster of Paris, and from this mould or matrix a cast is afterwards\r\ntaken in type metal. By the other mode--termed by the French\r\n_clichage_[IX-31]--the mould or matrix is not formed of plaster; but is\r\nobtained by letting the block fall, with its engraved surface downwards,\r\ndirectly on a mass of metal,[IX-32] just sufficiently fluid to receive\r\nthe impression, and which becomes solid almost at the very instant it is\r\ntouched by the block. From this mould or matrix a cast is afterwards\r\ntaken in the same manner. In order to prevent the surface of the block\r\nbecoming charred by the heat, it is previously rubbed over with a\r\ncomposition of common yellow soap and red ochre.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 1 (from Wood).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: No. 2 (from Metal).]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-31: A cast from a form of types, as well as from an\r\n    engraved wood-block, is by French printers termed a _cliché_.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-32: The metal of which this matrix is formed, is made\r\n    several degrees harder than common type metal, by mixing with the\r\n    latter a greater portion of regulus of antimony, otherwise the\r\n    matrix and cast would adhere.]\r\n\r\nWhen it is particularly desirable to preserve the original block\r\nuninjured, the safest mode is that of forming a mould or matrix of\r\nplaster; for by the process of _clichage_ a delicately engraved block is\r\nextremely liable to receive damage. As a cast, whether from a matrix of\r\nmetal or of plaster, generally requires certain small specks of the\r\nmetal to be removed, or some of the lines to be cleared out, this\r\noperation is frequently entrusted to a person employed in a\r\nprinting-office where such cast is taken. Such person, however, should\r\nnever be allowed to do more than remove the specks; for, should he\r\nattempt to re-enter or re-cut the lines or tints on metal, he will be\r\nvery likely to spoil the work. It is extremely difficult, even to a\r\ndexterous engraver, to re-enter the lines that have been partially\r\nclosed up in a tint, so that they shall appear the same as the others\r\nwhich have come off clear. Should the printer’s _picker_ happen to\r\nre-enter them in a direction opposite to that in which they were\r\noriginally cut on the block, the work is certain to be spoiled. When a\r\ncast requires clearing out and retouching in this manner, the operation\r\nought to be performed by a wood engraver, and, if possible, by the\r\nperson who executed the original block. When the subject is not very\r\ncomplicated, it is extremely difficult to distinguish which of two\r\nimpressions is from a cast, and which is from the original block. Those\r\nwho profess to have great judgment in such matters are left to determine\r\nwhich of the preceding busts is printed from metal, and which from wood.\r\n\r\nWhen a duplicate of a modern, or a fac-simile of an old wood-cut is\r\nrequired, the best mode of obtaining a correct copy, is to transfer the\r\noriginal, if not too large or too valuable, to a prepared block; and the\r\nmode of effecting this is as follows:--The back of the impression to be\r\ntransferred is first well moistened with a mixture composed of equal\r\nparts of concentrated potash and essence of lavender; it is then placed\r\nabove a block whose surface has been slightly moistened with water, and\r\nrubbed with a burnisher. If the mixture be of proper strength, the ink\r\nof the old impression will become loosened, and be transferred to the\r\nwood. Recent impression of a wood-cut, before the ink is set, may be\r\ntransferred to a block without any preparation, merely by what is\r\ntechnically termed “rubbing down.” In order to transfer impressions from\r\ncopper-plates, it is necessary to use the _oil_ of lavender instead of\r\nthe _essence_: if a very old impression, apply the preparation to its\r\nface.\r\n\r\nSince the former edition of this work considerable improvements have\r\nbeen made in the mode of taking casts, of which the principal is\r\n_electrotyping_, by the galvanic precipitation of copper. By this\r\nprocess all the finer lines of the engraving are so perfectly preserved,\r\nthat impressions printed from the cast are quite undistinguishable from\r\nthose printed from the original block.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this subject we think it right to introduce the notice of\r\na new art, which, if it accomplishes all it professes, and as, judging\r\nby the annexed example, it seems capable of performing, will be a great\r\nacquisition. The art was first brought out as Collins’s process, but is\r\nnow called the _Electro-printing Block process_, and is managed under\r\nthe inventor’s direction by a company established at No. 27, New Bridge\r\nStreet, Blackfriars. The object of the process is to reduce or extend,\r\nby means of transfer to an elastic material, maps or engravings of any\r\nsize. The specimen given in the present volume is reduced from a\r\nlithograph copy of an early block print, four times its size,[IX-33] and\r\nthen electrotyped into a surface block, so as to print in the ordinary\r\nmanner of a wood-engraving. The reader will easily imagine that any\r\nplate transferred to an elastic surface distended equally, will, when\r\ncollapsed, yield a reduced impression, and _vice versâ_. The only\r\ndrawback to this process seems to be the want of depth in the\r\nelectro-type where there are large unengraved spaces. Such plates will\r\nwant good bringing-up and very careful printing.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-33: Taken from Mr. S. Leigh Sotheby’s _Principia\r\n    Typographica_, 3 vols. folio--to whose kindness we are indebted\r\n    for the reduced block.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe unequal manner in which wood-cuts are printed, is often injurious\r\nboth to publishers and engravers; for, however well a subject may have\r\nbeen engraved, or whatever may have been the expense incurred, both the\r\nengraver’s talents and the publisher’s money will, in a great measure,\r\nhave been thrown away unless the cut be properly printed. The want of\r\ncordial co-operation between printers and wood engravers is one of the\r\nchief causes of wood-cuts being so frequently printed in an improper\r\nmanner. One printer’s method of printing wood-cuts often differs so much\r\nfrom that of another, that it is generally necessary for an engraver who\r\nwishes to have justice done to his work, to ascertain the office at\r\nwhich a book is to be printed before he begins to execute any of the\r\ncuts. If they are intended to be printed at a steam-press, they require\r\nto be engraved in a manner suitable to that method of printing; and if\r\nit be further intended to take casts from them, and to print from such\r\ncasts instead of the original blocks, it is necessary for the engraver\r\nto execute his work accordingly. Should they have to be printed at a\r\ncommon press _with a blanket_, it is necessary that they should be\r\nlowered in such parts as are most liable to be printed too heavy from\r\nthe parchment of the tympan, when there is a blanket behind it,\r\npenetrating to a greater depth between the lines than when no blanket is\r\nused.[IX-34] When it is intended to print cuts in what is called the\r\n_best_ manner,--that is, at a common press without a blanket, and where\r\nthe effect is brought up by means of overlaying,--the engraver has\r\nnothing to do but to execute his subject on a plane surface to the best\r\nof his ability, and to leave the task of bringing up the dark, and\r\neasing the light parts to the printer,--who, if he have not an artist’s\r\neye, can only by chance succeed in producing the effect intended by the\r\ndraftsman and the engraver.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-34: The principal difference, so far as relates to\r\n    wood engravings, between printing by a steam-press with\r\n    cylindrical rollers, and printing by a common press with a\r\n    blanket, is, that the blanket or woollen cloth covering the\r\n    cylinder of the steam-press comes into immediate contact with the\r\n    paper, while in the common press the parchment of the tympan is\r\n    interposed between the paper and the blanket. It is necessary that\r\n    cuts intended to be printed by a steam-press should be lowered to\r\n    a greater depth than cuts intended to be printed with a blanket at\r\n    a common press, as the blanket on the cylinder penetrates to a\r\n    greater depth between the lines.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nShould a series of wood-cuts be engraved with the view of their being\r\nprinted at a steam-press, or at a common press with a blanket, and\r\nshould the publisher or proprietor of the work afterwards change his\r\nintention, and decide on having them printed in the _best_ manner,--that\r\nis, by the common press without a blanket, and with overlays,--such\r\ncuts, whatever pains might be taken, could not be properly and\r\nefficiently printed; for those parts which had been lowered in order to\r\nobviate the _in_-pressure of the blanket, would either be totally\r\ninvisible, or would only appear imperfectly,--that is, with the lines\r\nindistinct and broken, as if they had not been properly inked. The\r\nfollowing cut, which was lowered for machine-printing, or printing with\r\na blanket, but has been worked off at a common press without a blanket,\r\nwhen compared with the same subject printed in the manner originally\r\nintended,--that is, with a blanket,--will illustrate what has been\r\npreviously said on the subject. I by no means wish it to be understood,\r\nthat any printer would allow such a cut to appear quite so bad as it\r\ndoes in the present impression; he would do _something_ to remedy the\r\ndefects, but he could not, without employing a blanket, cause it to have\r\nthe appearance originally intended by the designer and engraver. It is\r\nprinted here without any aid of overlaying, in order that the difference\r\nmight be the more apparent to those who are unacquainted with the\r\nsubject. I have, however, not unfrequently seen excellent cuts spoiled\r\nfrom inattention to bringing up the lowered parts, even when printed at\r\nthe office of printers who have acquired a high character for _fine_\r\nwork, and whose names on this account are announced in advertisements in\r\nconnexion with those of the author, designer, and publisher, as a\r\nguarantee for the superior manner in which the cuts contained in the\r\nwork will be printed.[IX-35] The following cut, of the same subject as\r\nthat given on the previous page, shows the appearance of the engraving\r\nwhen properly printed in the manner intended; every line is here brought\r\nup by using a blanket, while from the block having been lowered, with a\r\nview to its being printed in this manner, there has been no occasion for\r\noverlays to increase the effect in the darker parts. The difference in\r\nthe two impressions is entirely owing to the different manner of\r\nprinting; for the one is printed from the block, and the other from a\r\ncast.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-35: I have known a printer, who _once_ had a high\r\n    character for his _fine_ work, charge and receive twelve guineas\r\n    per sheet for a book containing a number of wood-cuts which\r\n    required to be well printed, and I have known a similar work\r\n    better printed from lowered blocks for less than half the sum per\r\n    sheet. Publishers will at no distant time discover, that it is\r\n    their interest rather to have their cuts first properly engraved\r\n    than to pay a printer a large additional sum for the trouble of\r\n    overlaying them, and thus giving them the appearance which they\r\n    ought to have without such means and appliances, if the blocks\r\n    were originally executed as they ought to be.]\r\n\r\nSubjects engraved on lowered blocks, in the manner of the following cut,\r\nhave always an unfinished appearance when printed without a blanket, and\r\nthe feebleness and confusion apparent in the lighter parts, instead of\r\nbeing remedied by overlaying the darker parts, are thus rendered more\r\nobvious. The connecting medium between the extremes of black and white\r\nbeing either entirely omitted or very imperfectly given, causes the\r\nimpression to have that harsh and unfinished appearance which is\r\nfrequently urged as one of the greatest objections to engraving on wood.\r\nIt is indeed true, that many cuts have this objectionable appearance;\r\nbut it is also true that the fault does not originate in any deficiency\r\nin the art, but is either the result of want of knowledge on the part of\r\nthe engraver, or is occasioned by improper printing. When wood engravers\r\nfound that anything approaching to delicacy, in blending the extremes of\r\nblack and white in their work, was extremely liable to be either lost or\r\nspoiled in the printing, it is not surprising that they should have paid\r\ncomparatively little attention to the connecting tints. In many\r\nexcellently engraved cuts, printed at the common press with overlays,\r\nthe tint next in gradation to positive black is often perceived to be\r\ntoo dark, in consequence of the extra pressure on the adjacent parts;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, the delicate lines intended to blend with the\r\nwhite, are either too heavy, or appear broken and confused. It is\r\nchiefly from this cause, that so much black and white, without the\r\nrequisite connecting middle tints, is found in wood-cuts; for the\r\nengraver, finding that such tints were frequently spoiled in the\r\nimpression, omitted them whenever he could, in order to adapt his\r\nsubject to the usual method of printing. When, in consequence of an\r\nimprovement in the mode of printing wood-cuts, engravers can depend on\r\nfinding all in the impression that can be executed on the block, it will\r\nno longer be an objection to the art that its productions have a hard\r\nand unfinished appearance, and that it is only capable of efficiently\r\nrepresenting subjects displaying strong contrasts of black and white.\r\n\r\nShould a wood-cut engraved on a plane surface, with the intention of its\r\nbeing printed in the _best_ manner,--that is, at a common press with\r\noverlays, and _without_ a blanket,--be printed at a steam-press, or at a\r\ncommon press _with_ a blanket, it will present a very different\r\nappearance to the engraver’s proof.[IX-36] The following cut, which\r\nought properly to have been printed in the _best_ manner, is here\r\nprinted improperly _with a blanket_, and the result is anything but\r\nsatisfactory; the parts which ought to have been delicately printed are,\r\nin consequence of the equality of the pressure on every part of the\r\nunlowered surface brought up too heavy, and from their appearing too\r\ndark, the effect intended by the designer and engraver is destroyed. The\r\nsame cut, when printed at a common press with overlays, and without a\r\nblanket, as originally intended, would have the light parts relieved,\r\nand appear as it does on the following page.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-36: The cuts being arranged back to back, as at pages\r\n    641, 642, and thereby preventing the types appearing, as they do\r\n    on the next page, is an advantage not to be overlooked.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe want of something like a uniform method of printing wood-cuts, and\r\nthe high price charged by printers for what is called fine work, have\r\noperated most injuriously to the progress and extension of wood\r\nengraving. The practice, however, of printing wood-cuts by a\r\nsteam-press, or a press of any kind with a cylindrical roller instead of\r\na platten, seems likely to introduce a general change in the practice of\r\nthe art. By the adoption of this cheap and expeditious method of\r\nprinting, books containing the very best wood engravings can be afforded\r\nat a much cheaper rate than formerly. As cuts printed in this manner can\r\nreceive no adventitious aid from overlays, the wood engraver is required\r\nto finish his work perfectly before it goes out of his hands, and not to\r\ntrust to the taste of a pressman for its being properly printed. The\r\ngreat desideratum in wood engraving is to produce cuts which can be\r\nefficiently printed at the least possible expense; and, as a means\r\ntowards this end, it is necessary that cuts should require the least\r\npossible aid from the printer, and be executed in such manner that,\r\nwithout gross negligence, they will be certain to print well. The\r\ngreatest advantage that wood engraving possesses over engraving on\r\ncopper or steel is the cheap rate at which its productions can be\r\nprinted at one impression, in the same sheet with the letter-press. To\r\nincrease, therefore, by an incomplete method of engraving, the cost of\r\nprinting wood-cuts, is to abandon the great vantage ground of the art.\r\n\r\nThe mode of printing by the common press without a blanket, and of\r\n_helping_ a cut engraved on a plane surface by means of overlays, is not\r\nonly much more expensive than printing from a lowered block by the\r\nsteam-press, or a common press with a blanket and without overlaying,\r\nbut is also much more injurious to the engraving. When a cut requires to\r\nbe overlaid[IX-37] in order that it may be properly printed, a piece of\r\npaper is first pasted on the tympan, and on this an impression is taken,\r\nwhich remains as a substratum for the subsequent overlays. A second\r\nimpression is next taken, and in this the pressman cuts out the lighter\r\nparts, and notes such as are too indistinct and require _bringing up_.\r\nHe then proceeds to paste scraps of paper over the corresponding parts\r\nin the first impression, on a sheet of thin paper, either in front or at\r\nthe back of the parchment tympan, in order to increase in such parts the\r\npressure of the platten; and thus continues, sometimes for half a day,\r\npasting scrap over scrap, until he obtains what he considers a perfect\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-37: What is called _underlaying_ consists in pasting\r\n    one piece of paper or more on the lower part of a block, in order\r\n    to raise it, and increase the pressure. When a block is uneven at\r\n    the bottom, in consequence of warping, underlaying is\r\n    indispensable.]\r\n\r\nAs the block is originally of the same height as the type, it is evident\r\nthat the overlays must very much increase the pressure of the platten on\r\nsuch parts as they are immediately above. Such increase of pressure is\r\nnot only injurious to the engraving, occasionally breaking down the\r\nlines; but it also frequently squeezes the ink from the surface _into_\r\nthe interstices, and causes the impression in such parts to appear\r\nblotted. While a block, with a flat surface, printed in this manner will\r\nscarcely afford five thousand good impressions without retouching,\r\ntwenty thousand can be obtained from a lowered block printed by a\r\nsteam-press, or by a common press with a blanket and without overlays;\r\nthe darkest parts in a lowered block being no higher than the type, and\r\nnot being overlaid, are subject to no unequal pressure to break down the\r\nlines, while the lighter parts being lowered are thus sufficiently\r\nprotected. The intervention of the blanket in the latter case not only\r\nbrings up the lighter parts, but is also less injurious to the\r\nengraving, than the direct action of the wood or metal platten, with\r\nonly the thin cloth and the parchment of the tympans intervening between\r\nit and the surface of the block.\r\n\r\nWhen wood-cuts are printed with overlays, and the paper is knotty, the\r\nengraving is certain to be injured by the knots being indented in the\r\nwood in those parts where the pressure is greatest. When copies of a\r\nwork containing wood-cuts are printed on India paper, the engraving is\r\nalmost invariably injured, in consequence of the hard knots and pieces\r\nof bark with which such paper abounds, causing indentions in the wood.\r\nThe consequence of printing off a certain number of copies of a work on\r\nsuch paper may be seen in the cut of the Vain Glow-worm, in the second\r\nedition of the first series of Northcote’s Fables: it is covered with\r\nwhite spots, the result of indentions in the block caused by the knots\r\nand inequalities in bad India paper. Overlays frequently shift if not\r\nwell attended to, and cause pressure where it was never intended.\r\n\r\nIn order that wood engravings should appear to the greatest advantage,\r\nit is necessary that they should be printed on proper paper. A person\r\nnot practically acquainted with the subject may easily be deceived in\r\nselecting paper for a work containing wood engravings. There is a kind\r\nof paper, manufactured of coarse material, which, in consequence of its\r\nbeing pressed, has a smooth appearance, and to the view seems to be\r\nhighly suitable for the purpose. As soon, however, as such paper is\r\nwetted previous to printing, its smoothness disappears, and its\r\nimperfections become apparent by the irregular swelling of the material\r\nof which it is composed. Paper intended for printing the best kind of\r\nwood-cuts ought to be even in texture, and this ought to be the result\r\nof good material well manufactured. Paper of this kind will not appear\r\nuneven when wetted, like that which has merely a _good face_ put upon it\r\nby means of extreme pressure. The best mode of testing the quality of\r\npaper is to wet a sheet; however even and smooth it may appear when dry,\r\nits imperfections will be evident when wet, if it be manufactured of\r\ncoarse material, and merely pressed smooth.\r\n\r\nPaper of unequal thickness, however good the material may be, is quite\r\nunfit for the purpose of printing the best kind of wood engravings; for,\r\nif a sheet be thicker at one end than the other, there will be a\r\nperceptible difference in the strength of the impressions of the cuts\r\naccordingly as they may be printed on the thick or the thin parts, those\r\non the latter being light, while those on the former are comparatively\r\nheavy or dark. When it is known that an overlay of the thinnest tissue\r\npaper will make a perceptible difference in an impression, the necessity\r\nof having paper of even texture for the purpose of printing wood-cuts\r\nwell is obvious. As there is less chance of inequality of texture in\r\ncomparatively thin paper than in thick, the former kind is generally to\r\nbe preferred, supposing it to be equally well manufactured.\r\n\r\nMr. Savage, at page 46 of his Hints on Decorative Printing, recommends\r\nthat in a sheet which consists entirely of letter-press in one\r\n_form_,[IX-38] and of letter-press and wood-cuts in the other, the form\r\nwithout cuts should be worked first. His words are as follow:--“When\r\nthere are wood-cuts in one form, and none in the other, then the form\r\nwithout the cuts ought to be worked first; as working the cuts last\r\nprevents the indention of the types appearing on the engraving, which\r\nwould otherwise take place to its prejudice.”\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-38: The entire quantity of types, or of types and\r\n    wood-cuts, which is locked up together, and printed on one side of\r\n    a sheet at one impression, is called by printers a _form_.]\r\n\r\nMy opinion on this subject is directly the reverse of Mr. Savage’s, for,\r\nunder similar circumstances, I should advise that the form containing\r\nthe cuts should be printed first; and for the following reason:--When\r\nany parts of a wood-cut require to be printed light--whether by lowering\r\nthe block or by overlaying--the pressure in such parts must necessarily\r\nbe less than on those adjacent. If then the form containing such cuts be\r\nprinted first, the paper being perfectly flat, and without any\r\nindentions, all the lines will appear distinct and continuous, unless\r\nthe pressman should grossly neglect his duty. If, on the contrary, the\r\nform containing such cuts be printed last, there is a risk of the lines\r\nin the lighter parts appearing broken and confused, in consequence of\r\nthe inequality in the surface of the paper, caused by the indention of\r\nthe types on the opposite side. Imperfections of this kind are to be\r\nseen in many works containing wood-cuts; and they are in particular\r\nnumerous in the Treatise on Cattle published under the superintendence\r\nof the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. In many of the\r\ncuts in this work the lines representing the sky appear discontinuous\r\nand broken, and the imperfections are always according to the kind of\r\ntype on the other side of the paper. When both forms contain wood-cuts,\r\nI should recommend that to be first which contains the best. Mr.\r\nSavage’s reason, independent of the preceding objections, is scarcely a\r\ngood one; for admitting that the indention of the types of the second\r\nform does appear in the _clear_ and _distinct_ impressions from the cuts\r\nin the first, when the sheet is just taken from the press, are not such\r\ninequalities entirely removed when the sheet is _dried_ and pressed?\r\n\r\nIn order to produce good impressions in printing wood-cuts, much more\r\ndepends on the manner in which the subject is treated by the designer,\r\nand on the plate which the cut occupies in a page, than a person\r\nunacquainted with the nicety required in such matters would imagine.\r\nWood-cuts which are delicately engraved, or which consist chiefly of\r\noutline, are the most difficult to print in a proper manner, in\r\nconsequence of their want of dark masses to relieve the pressure in the\r\nmore delicate parts, and thus cause them to appear lighter in the\r\nimpression. There ought never to be a large portion of light delicate\r\nwork in a wood-cut without a few dark parts near to it, which may serve\r\nas stays or props to relieve the pressure. In illustration of what is\r\nhere said, I would refer to the cut of King Shahriyár unveiling\r\nShahrazád, at page 15 of Mr. Lane’s Translation of the Arabian Nights’\r\nEntertainments, where it will be seen, that certain dark parts are\r\nintroduced as if at measured distances. It is entirely owing to the\r\nintroduction of those dark parts that the pressman has been enabled to\r\nprint the cut so well: they not only give by contrast the appearance of\r\ngreater delicacy to the lightest parts; but they also serve to relieve\r\nthem from that degree of pressure, which, if the cut consisted entirely\r\nof such delicate lines, would most certainly cause them to appear\r\ncomparatively thick and heavy. Another instance of the advantage which a\r\ncut derives from its being placed in a certain situation in the page, is\r\nalso afforded by the same work. The cut to which I allude is that of the\r\nReturn of the Jinnee, at page 47, consisting chiefly of middle tint,\r\nwith a pillar of smoke rising up from the ground, and gradually becoming\r\nlighter towards the top. Had this cut been introduced at the head of the\r\npage without any text above it, the light parts would not have appeared\r\nso delicate as they do now when the cut is printed in its present\r\nsituation. The top of the cut, where the lines are required to be\r\nlightest, being near to the types, thus receives a support, and is by\r\nthem relieved from that degree of pressure which would otherwise cause\r\nthe lines to appear heavy. Towards the bottom of the cut, which also\r\nforms the bottom of the page, there are two or three dark figures which\r\nmost opportunely afford that necessary degree of support which in the\r\nupper part is derived from the types.\r\n\r\nThe engraver by whom a cut has been executed is unquestionably the best\r\nperson that the printer can apply to for any information as to the\r\nmanner in which it ought to be printed, as he alone can be perfectly\r\nacquainted with the _state of the block_, and with any peculiarity in\r\nthe engraving. If any light part should have been lowered to a very\r\ntrifling extent, it is sometimes almost impossible that the printer\r\nshould perceive such lowered part after the block has been covered with\r\nink; and hence, notwithstanding the proof which may have been sent by\r\nthe engraver as a guide, such a cut is very likely to be worked off, to\r\nthe great injury of the general effect of the subject, without the\r\nlowered part being properly brought up. In order to avoid such an\r\noccurrence, which is by no means unfrequent, it is advisable to send to\r\nthe engraver a printed proof of his cut, in order that he may note those\r\nparts where the pressman has failed in obtaining a perfect impression.\r\nFrom the want of this precaution wood-cuts are but too often badly\r\nprinted; while at the same time the engraver is blamed for executing his\r\nwork imperfectly, though in reality the defect is entirely occasioned by\r\nthe cut not being properly printed.\r\n\r\nThe best mode of cleaning a block after the engraver has taken his first\r\nproof is to rub it well with a piece of woollen cloth. So long as\r\nanything remains to be done with the graver, the block, after taking a\r\nproof, ought never to be cleaned with any liquid, as by such means the\r\nink on the surface would be dissolved, and the mixture getting between,\r\nthe lines would thus cause the cut to appear uniformly black, and render\r\nit difficult for the engraver to finish his work in a proper manner from\r\nhis inability to clearly distinguish the lines.[IX-39] Turpentine or lye\r\nought to be very sparingly used to clean a cut after the printing is\r\nfinished, and never unless the interstices be choked up with ink which\r\ncannot otherwise be removed. When the surface of the block becomes foul,\r\nin consequence of the ink becoming hardened upon it, it is most\r\nadvisable to clean it with a little soap and water, using as little\r\nwater as possible, and afterwards to rub the block well with a piece of\r\nwoollen cloth. When it is necessary to use turpentine in order to get\r\nthe hardened ink out of the interstices, the surface of the block should\r\nimmediately afterwards be slightly washed with a little soap and water,\r\nand afterwards rubbed with a piece of woollen cloth.[IX-40] _Warm_ water\r\nought never to be used, as it is much more apt than cold to cause the\r\nblock to warp and split. The practice of cleaning wood-cuts in the form\r\nby means of a _hard_ brush, dipped in turpentine or lye, is extremely\r\ninjurious to the finest parts, as by this means most delicate lines are\r\nnot unfrequently broken. The use of anything damp to clean the cuts when\r\nthe pressman finishes his day’s-work, is to be avoided; as a very small\r\ndegree of damp is sufficient to cause the block to warp when left locked\r\nup over night in the form. Whenever it is practicable, the cuts ought to\r\nbe taken out of the form at night, and placed on their edges till next\r\nmorning; as, by thus receiving a free circulation of air all round them,\r\nthey will be much less liable to warp, than if allowed to remain in the\r\nform. As wood-cuts are often injured by being carelessly printed in a\r\nrough proof, it is advisable not to insert them in the form till all the\r\nliteral corrections are made, and the text is ready for the press.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-39: When a block, after being printed, requires\r\n    retouching, it is generally necessary to cover it with fine\r\n    whiting, which, by filling up the interstices, thus enables the\r\n    engraver to distinguish the raised lines more clearly.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-40: When a block has been cleaned with turpentine,\r\n    and not afterwards washed with soap and water, it will not receive\r\n    the ink well when next used. The first fifty or sixty impressions\r\n    subsequently taken, are almost certain to have a grey and scumbled\r\n    appearance.]\r\n\r\nIt is a fact, though I am unable to satisfactorily account for it, that\r\nan impression from a wood-block, taken by a common press, without\r\noverlaying, or any other kind of preparation, is generally lighter in\r\nthe middle than towards the edges. Mr. Edward Cowper, who has\r\ncontributed so much to the improvement of machine-printing, when engaged\r\nin making experiments with common presses constructed with the greatest\r\ncare,[IX-41] informs me, that he frequently noticed the same defect.\r\nSuch inequality in the impression is not perceptible in cuts printed by\r\na steam-press, where the pressure proceeds from a _cylinder_ instead of\r\na flat platten of metal or wood. Besides the advantage which the\r\nsteam-press possesses over the common press in producing a uniformly\r\nregular impression, the ink in the former method is more equally\r\ndistributed over every part of the form in consequence of the\r\nundeviating regularity of the action of the inking rollers. Though an\r\nequal distribution of the ink be of great advantage when all the cuts in\r\na form require to be printed in the same manner,--that is, when all are\r\nof a similar _tone_ of colour,--yet when some are dark, and others\r\ncomparatively light, balls faced with composition are decidedly\r\npreferable to composition rollers, as by using the former the pressman\r\ncan give to each cut its proper quantity of ink.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote IX-41: Some of those presses were so truly constructed,\r\n    that if the table were wetted, and brought in contact with the\r\n    platten, it could be raised from its bed by allowing the platten\r\n    to ascend, in consequence of the two surfaces being so perfectly\r\n    plane and level.]\r\n\r\nI very much doubt, if soft composition rollers, such as are now\r\ngenerally used, be so well adapted as composition balls for inking\r\nwood-cuts engraved on a _plane_ surface. The material of which the\r\nrollers are formed is so soft and elastic, that it does not only pass\r\nover the surface of the block, but penetrates to a certain depth between\r\nthe lines, thus inking them at the sides, as well as on their surface.\r\nThe consequence of this is, that when the pressure is too great, the\r\npaper is forced in between the lines, and receives, to the great\r\ndetriment of the impression, a portion of the ink communicated by the\r\nsoft and elastic roller to their sides. For inking cuts delicately\r\nengraved on _unlowered_ blocks, I should recommend composition balls\r\ninstead of composition rollers, whenever it is required that such cuts\r\nshould be printed in the _best_ manner.\r\n\r\nThe great advantage which modern wood engraving possesses over every\r\nother branch of graphic art, is the cheap rate at which its productions\r\ncan be disseminated in conjunction with types, by means of the press.\r\nThis is the stronghold of the art; and whenever it has been abandoned in\r\nmodern times to compete with copper-plate engraving, in point of\r\ndelicacy or mere difficulty of execution, the result has been a failure.\r\nNo large modern wood-cuts, published separately, and resting on their\r\nown merits as works of art, have repaid the engraver. The price at which\r\nthey were published was too high to allow of their being purchased by\r\nthe humbler classes, while the more wealthy collectors of fine prints\r\nhave treated them with neglect. Such persons were not inclined to\r\npurchase comparatively expensive wood-cuts merely as curiosities,\r\nshowing how closely the peculiarities of copper-plate engraving could be\r\nimitated on wood.\r\n\r\nThough most of the large cuts designed by Albert Durer were either\r\npublished separately without letter-press, or in parts with brief\r\nexplanations annexed; yet we cannot ascribe the favour with which they\r\nwere unquestionably received, to the mere fact of their being executed\r\n_on wood_. They were adapted to the taste and feelings of the age, and\r\nwere esteemed on account of the interest of the subjects and the\r\nexcellence of the designs. Were a modern artist of comparatively equal\r\ntalent to publish a series of subjects of excellence and originality,\r\nengraved on wood in the best manner, I have little doubt of their being\r\nfavourably received; their success, however, would not be owing to the\r\ncircumstance of their being engraved on wood, but to their intrinsic\r\nmerits as works of art.\r\n\r\nOn taking a retrospective glance at the history of wood engraving, it\r\nwill be perceived that the art has not been regularly progressive. At\r\none period we find its productions distinguished for excellence of\r\ndesign and freedom of execution, and at another we find mere mechanical\r\nlabour substituted for the talent of the artist. As soon as this change\r\ncommenced, wood engraving, as a means of multiplying works of art began\r\nto decline. It continued in a state of neglect for upwards of a century,\r\nand showed little symptoms of revival until the works of Bewick again\r\nbrought it into notice.\r\n\r\nThe maxim that “a good thing is valuable in proportion as many can enjoy\r\nit,” may be applied with peculiar propriety to wood engraving; for the\r\nproductions of no other kindred art have been more generally\r\ndisseminated, nor with greater advantage to those for whom they were\r\nintended. In the child’s first book wood-cuts are introduced, to enable\r\nthe infant mind to connect words with things; the youth gains his\r\nknowledge of the forms of foreign animals from wood-cuts; and the\r\nmathematician avails himself of wood engraving to execute his diagrams.\r\nIt has been employed, in the representation of religious subjects, as an\r\naid to devotion; to celebrate the triumphs of kings and warriors; to\r\nillustrate the pages of the historian, the traveller, and the poet; and\r\nby its means copies of the works of the greatest artists of former\r\ntimes, have been afforded at a price which enabled the very poorest\r\nclasses to become purchasers. As at least one hundred thousand good\r\nimpressions can be obtained from a wood-cut, if properly engraved and\r\ncarefully printed; and as the additional cost of printing wood-cuts with\r\nletter-press is inconsiderable when compared with the cost of printing\r\nsteel or copper plates separately, the art will never want\r\nencouragement, nor again sink into neglect, so long as there are artists\r\nof talent to furnish designs, and good engravers to execute them.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  DIES ADDIDIT MEA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A.\r\n\r\n  Absolon, John, artist, 576*.\r\n  Accursius, Mariangelus, note written by, in a Donatus, 123.\r\n  Advertisements, wood-cuts prefixed to, 446 _n_.\r\n  Allegory of Death, a tract printed at Bamberg, 1462, 171.\r\n  Almanach de Paris, with wood-cuts, by Papillon, 459.\r\n  Almanacks, sheet, 1470, 1500, 225.\r\n  Alphabet of figures, engraved on wood, in the British Museum, 106;\r\n    cuts from, 109, 110, 111, 112;\r\n    with figures, of a Dance of Death, preserved in the public library\r\n      at Basle, 352.\r\n  Altdorffer, A. 320.\r\n  Amman, Jost, cuts designed by, in a book of trades and professions,\r\n      408, 409;\r\n    other cuts designed by him, 411.\r\n  Amonoph, a name on an Egyptian brick-stamp, 6 _n_.\r\n  Andreani, Andrea, chiaro-scuros engraved by, 432.\r\n  Andrews, G.
