After the present volume, the second is\r\nto treat of the Church, the School and the Family, describe the modern\r\nmilieu and note the facilities and obstacles which a society like our\r\nown encounters in this new milieu: here, the past and the present meet,\r\nand the work already done is continued by the work which is going on\r\nunder our eyes.--The undertaking is hazardous and more difficult than\r\nwith the two preceding parts. For the Ancient Régime and the Revolution\r\nare henceforth complete and finished periods; we have seen the end\r\nof both and are thus able to comprehend their entire course. On the\r\ncontrary, the end of the ulterior period is still wanting; the great\r\ninstitutions which date from the Consulate and the Empire, either\r\nconsolidation or dissolution, have not yet reached their historic term:\r\nsince 1800, the social order of things, notwithstanding eight changes\r\nof political form, has remained almost intact. Our children or\r\ngrandchildren will know whether it will finally succeed or miscarry;\r\nwitnesses of the denouement, they will have fuller light by which to\r\njudge of the entire drama. Thus far four acts only have been played;\r\nof the fifth act, we have simply a presentiment.--On the other hand, by\r\ndint of living under this social system, we have become accustomed to\r\nit; it no longer excites our wonder; however artificial it may be\r\nit seems to us natural. We can scarcely conceive of another that is\r\nhealthier; and what is much worse, it is repugnant to us to do so. For,\r\nsuch a conception would soon lead to comparisons and hence to a judgment\r\nand, on many points, to an unfavorable judgment, one which would be a\r\ncensure, not only of our institutions but of ourselves. The machine\r\nof the year VIII,[1101] applied to us for three generations, has\r\npermanently shaped and fixed us as we are, for better or for worse. If,\r\nfor a century, it sustains us, it represses us for a century. We\r\nhave contracted the infirmities it imports--stoppage of development,\r\ninstability of internal balance, disorders of the intellect and of\r\nthe will, fixed ideas and ideas that are false. These ideas are ours;\r\ntherefore we hold on to them, or, rather, they have taken hold of us.\r\nTo get rid of them, to impose the necessary recoil on our mind, to\r\ntransport us to a distance and place us at a critical point of view,\r\nwhere we can study ourselves, our ideas and our institutions as\r\nscientific objects, requires a great effort on our part, many\r\nprecautions, and long reflection.--Hence, the delays of this study; the\r\nreader will pardon them on considering that an ordinary opinion, caught\r\non the wing, on such a subject, does not suffice. In any event, when one\r\npresents an opinion on such a subject one is bound to believe it. I\r\ncan believe in my own only when it has become precise and seems to me\r\nproven.\r\n\r\nMenthon Saint-Bernard, September, 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK FIRST. NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. HISTORICAL IMPORTANCE OF HIS CHARACTER AND GENIUS.\r\n\r\nIf you want to comprehend a building, you have to imagine the\r\ncircumstances, I mean the difficulties and the means, the kind and\r\nquality of its available materials, the moment, the opportunity, and\r\nthe urgency of the demand for it. But, still more important, we must\r\nconsider the genius and taste of the architect, especially whether he\r\nis the proprietor, whether he built it to live in himself, and, once\r\ninstalled in it, whether he took pains to adapt it to how own way of\r\nliving, to his own necessities, to his own use.--Such is the social\r\nedifice erected by Napoleon Bonaparte, its architect, proprietor, and\r\nprincipal occupant from 1799 to 1814. It is he who has made modern\r\nFrance; never was an individual character so profoundly stamped on any\r\ncollective work, so that, to comprehend the work, we must first study\r\nthe character of the Man.[1102]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Napoleon's Past and Personality.\r\n\r\n     He is of another race and another century.--Origin of his\r\n     paternal family.--Transplanted to Corsica.--His maternal\r\n     family.--Laetitia Ramolino.--Persistence of Corsican\r\n     souvenirs in Napoleon's mind.--His youthful sentiments\r\n     regarding Corsica and France.--Indications found in his\r\n     early compositions and in his style.--Current monarchical or\r\n     democratic ideas have no hold on him.--His impressions of\r\n     the 20th of June and 10th of August after the 31st of May.\r\n     --His associations with Robespierre and Barras without\r\n     committing himself.--His sentiments and the side he takes\r\n     Vendémiaire 13th.--The great Condottière.--His character and\r\n     conduct in Italy.--Description of him morally and physically\r\n     in 1798.--The early and sudden ascendancy which he exerts.\r\n     Analogous in spirit and character to his Italian ancestors\r\n     of the XVth century.\r\n\r\nDisproportionate in all things, but, stranger still, he is not only\r\nout of the common run, but there is no standard of measurement for him;\r\nthrough his temperament, instincts, faculties, imagination, passions,\r\nand moral constitution he seems cast in a special mould, composed of\r\nanother metal than that which enters into the composition of his fellows\r\nand contemporaries. Evidently he is not a Frenchman, nor a man of the\r\neighteenth century; he belongs to another race and another epoch.[1103]\r\nWe detect in him, at the first glance, the foreigner, the Italian,[1104]\r\nand something more, apart and beyond these, surpassing all similitude\r\nor analogy.-Italian he was through blood and lineage; first, through\r\nhis paternal family, which is Tuscan,[1105] and which we can follow\r\ndown from the twelfth century, at Florence, then at San Miniato; next\r\nat Sarzana, a small, backward, remote town in the state of Genoa, where,\r\nfrom father to son, it vegetates obscurely in provincial isolation,\r\nthrough a long line of notaries and municipal syndics. \"My origin,\"\r\nsays Napoleon himself,[1106] \"has made all Italians regard me as a\r\ncompatriot.... When the question of the marriage of my sister Pauline\r\nwith Prince Borghése came up there was but one voice in Rome and in\r\nTuscany, in that family, and with all its connections: 'It will\r\ndo,' said all of them, 'it's amongst ourselves, it is one of our own\r\nfamilies...'\" When the Pope later hesitated about coming to Paris to\r\ncrown Napoleon, \"the Italian party in the Conclave prevailed against\r\nthe Austrian party by supporting political arguments with the following\r\nslight tribute to national amour propre: 'After all we are imposing\r\nan Italian family on the barbarians, to govern them. We are revenging\r\nourselves on the Gauls.'\" Significant words, which will one day throw\r\nlight upon the depths of the Italian nature, the eldest daughter of\r\nmodern civilization, imbued with her right of primogeniture, persisting\r\nin her grudge against the transalpines, the rancorous inheritor of Roman\r\npride and of antique patriotism.[1107]\r\n\r\nFrom Sarzana, a Bonaparte emigrates to Corsica, where he establishes\r\nhimself and lives after 1529. The following year Florence is taken and\r\nsubjugated for good. Henceforth, in Tuscany, under Alexander de Medici,\r\nthen under Cosmo I. and his successors, in all Italy under Spanish rule,\r\nmunicipal independence, private feuds, the great exploits of political\r\nadventures and successful usurpations, the system of ephemeral\r\nprincipalities, based on force and fraud, all give way to permanent\r\nrepression, monarchical discipline, external order, and a certain\r\nspecies of public tranquility. Thus, just at the time when the energy\r\nand ambition, the vigorous and free sap of the Middle Ages begins to\r\nrun down and then dry up in the shriveled trunk,[1108] a small detached\r\nbranch takes root in an island, not less Italian but almost barbarous,\r\namidst institutions, customs, and passions belonging to the primitive\r\nmedieval epoch,[1109] and in a social atmosphere sufficiently rude for\r\nthe maintenance of all its vigor and harshness.--Grafted, moreover, by\r\nfrequent marriages, on the wild stock of the island, Napoleon, on the\r\nmaternal side, through his grandmother and mother, is wholly indigenous.\r\nHis grandmother, a Pietra-Santa, belonged to Sarténe,[1110] a Corsican\r\ncanton par excellence where, in 1800, hereditary vendettas still\r\nmaintained the system of the eleventh century; where the permanent\r\nstrife of inimical families was suspended only by truces; where, in many\r\nvillages, nobody stirred out of doors except in armed bodies, and\r\nwhere the houses were crenellated like fortresses. His mother, Laetitia\r\nRamolini, from whom, in character and in will, he derived much more than\r\nfrom his father,[1111] is a primitive soul on which Civilization\r\nhas taken no hold. She is simple, all of a piece, unsuited to the\r\nrefinements, charms, and graces of a worldly life; indifferent to\r\ncomforts, without literary culture, as parsimonious as any peasant\r\nwoman, but as energetic as the leader of a band. She is powerful,\r\nphysically and spiritually, accustomed to danger, ready in desperate\r\nresolutions. She is, in short, a \"rural Cornelia,\" who conceived and\r\ngave birth to her son amidst the risks of battle and of defeat, in the\r\nthickest of the French invasion, amidst mountain rides on horseback,\r\nnocturnal surprises, and volleys of musketry.[1112]\r\n\r\n\"Losses, privations, and fatigue,\" says Napoleon, \"she endured all and\r\nbraved all. Hers was a man's head on a woman's shoulders.\"\r\n\r\nThus fashioned and brought into the world, he felt that, from first to\r\nthe last, he was of his people and country.\r\n\r\n\"Everything was better there,\" said he, at Saint Helena,[1113] \"even the\r\nvery smell of the soil, which he could have detected with his eyes shut;\r\nnowhere had he found the same thing. He imagined himself there again\r\nin early infancy, and lived over again the days of his youth, amidst\r\nprecipices, traversing lofty peaks, deep valleys, and narrow defiles,\r\nenjoying the honors and pleasures of hospitality, \"treated everywhere\r\nas a brother and compatriot,\" without any accident or insult ever\r\nsuggesting to him that his confidence was not well grounded.\" At\r\nBocognano,[1114] where his mother, pregnant with him, had taken\r\nrefuge, \"where hatred and vengeance extended to the seventh degree of\r\nrelationship, and where the dowry of a young girl was estimated by the\r\nnumber of her Cousins, I was feasted and made welcome, and everybody\r\nwould have died for me.\" Forced to become a Frenchman, transplanted\r\nto France, educated at the expense of the king in a French school, he\r\nbecame rigid in his insular patriotism, and loudly extolled Paoli, the\r\nliberator, against whom his relations had declared themselves. \"Paoli,\"\r\nsaid he, at the dinner table,[1115]\" was a great man. He loved his\r\ncountry. My father was his adjutant, and never will I forgive him\r\nfor having aided in the union of Corsica with France. He should have\r\nfollowed her fortunes and have succumbed only with her.\" Throughout his\r\nyouth he is at heart anti-French, morose, \"bitter, liking very few and\r\nvery little liked, brooding over resentment,\" like a vanquished man,\r\nalways moody and compelled to work against the grain. At Brienne, he\r\nkeeps aloof from his comrades, takes no part in their sports, shuts\r\nhimself in the library, and opens himself up only to Bourrienne\r\nin explosions of hatred: \"I will do you Frenchmen all the harm I\r\ncan!\"--\"Corsican by nation and character,\" wrote his professor of\r\nhistory in the Military Academy, \"he will go far if circumstances\r\nfavor him.\"[1116]--Leaving the Academy, and in garrison at Valence and\r\nAuxonne, he remains always hostile, denationalized; his old bitterness\r\nreturns, and, addressing his letters to Paoli, he says: \"I was born when\r\nour country perished. Thirty thousand Frenchmen vomited on our shores,\r\ndrowning the throne of liberty in floods of blood--such was the odious\r\nspectacle on which my eyes first opened! The groans of the dying, the\r\nshrieks of the oppressed, tears of despair, surrounded my cradle from\r\nmy birth... I will blacken those who betrayed the common cause with\r\nthe brush of infamy.... vile, sordid souls corrupted by gain!\"[1117]\r\nA little later, his letter to Buttafuoco, deputy in the Constituent\r\nAssembly and principal agent in the annexation to France, is one long\r\nstrain of renewed, concentrated hatred, which, after at first trying\r\nto restrain it within the bounds of cold sarcasm, ends in boiling over,\r\nlike red-hot lava, in a torrent of scorching invective.--From the age of\r\nfifteen, at the Academy and afterwards in his regiment, he finds refuge\r\nin imagination in the past of his island;[1118] he recounts its history,\r\nhis mind dwells upon it for many years, and he dedicates his work to\r\nPaoli. Unable to get it published, he abridges it, and dedicates the\r\nabridgment to Abbé Raynal, recapitulating in a strained style, with\r\nwarm, vibrating sympathy, the annals of his small community, its revolts\r\nand deliverances, its heroic and sanguinary outbreaks, its public\r\nand domestic tragedies, ambuscades, betrayals, revenges, loves,\r\nand murders,--in short, a history similar to that of the Scottish\r\nhighlanders, while the style, still more than the sympathies, denotes\r\nthe foreigner. Undoubtedly, in this work, as in other youthful writings,\r\nhe follows as well as he can the authors in vogue--Rousseau, and\r\nespecially Raynal; he gives a schoolboy imitation of their tirades,\r\ntheir sentimental declamation, and their humanitarian grandiloquence.\r\nBut these borrowed clothes, which incommode him, do not fit him;\r\nthey are too tight, and the cloth is too fine; they require too much\r\ncircumspection in walking; he does not know how to put them on, and they\r\nrip at every seam. Not only has he never learned how to spell, but he\r\ndoes not know the true meaning, connections, and relations of words,\r\nthe propriety or impropriety of phrases, the exact significance\r\nof imagery;[1119] he strides on impetuously athwart a pell-mell of\r\nincongruities, incoherencies, Italianisms, and barbarisms, undoubtedly\r\nstumbling along through awkwardness and inexperience, but also through\r\nexcess of ardor and of heat;[1120] his jerking, eruptive thought,\r\novercharged with passion, indicates the depth and temperature of its\r\nsource. Already, at the Academy, the professor of belles-lettres[1121]\r\nnotes down that \"in the strange and incorrect grandeur of his\r\namplifications he seems to see granite fused in a volcano.\" However\r\noriginal in mind and in sensibility, ill-adapted as he is to the society\r\naround him, different from his comrades, it is clear beforehand that the\r\ncurrent ideas which take such hold on them will obtain no hold on him.\r\n\r\nOf the two dominant and opposite ideas which clash with each other,\r\nit might be supposed that he would lean either to one or to the other,\r\nalthough accepting neither.--Pensioner of the king, who supported him at\r\nBrienne, and afterwards in the Military Academy; who also supported his\r\nsister at Saint-Cyr; who, for twenty years, is the benefactor of his\r\nfamily; to whom, at this very time, he addresses entreating or grateful\r\nletters over his mother's signature--he does not regard him as his born\r\ngeneral; it does not enter his mind to take sides and draw his sword in\r\nhis patron's behalf;' in vain is he a gentleman, to whom, d'Hozier\r\nhas certified; reared in a school of noble cadets, he has no noble or\r\nmonarchical traditions.[1122]--Poor and tormented by ambition, a reader\r\nof Rousseau, patronized by Raynal, and tacking together sentences of\r\nphilosophic fustian about equality, if he speaks the jargon of the day,\r\nit is without any belief in it. The phrases in vogue form a decent,\r\nacademical drapery for his ideas, or serve him as a red cap for the\r\nclub; he is not bewildered by democratic illusions, and entertains no\r\nother feeling than disgust for the revolution and the sovereignty of\r\nthe populace.--At Paris, in April,1792, when the struggle between the\r\nmonarchists and the revolutionaries is at its height, he tries to find\r\n\"some successful speculation,\"[1123] and thinks he will hire and sublet\r\nhouses at a profit. On the 20th of June he witnesses, only as a matter\r\nof curiosity, the invasion of the Tuileries, and, on seeing the king at\r\na window place the red cap on his head, exclaims, so as to be heard,\"\r\nChe Caglione!\" Immediately after this: \"How could they let that rabble\r\nenter! Mow down four or five hundred of them with cannons and the rest\r\nwould run away.\" On August 10, when the tocsin sounds, he regards the\r\npeople and the king with equal contempt; he rushes to a friend's house\r\non the Carrousel and there, still as a looker-on, views at his ease all\r\nthe occurrences of the day.[1124] Finally, the chateau is forced and he\r\nstrolls through the Tuileries, looks in at the neighboring cafés, and\r\nthat is all: he is not disposed to take sides, he has no Jacobin or\r\nroyalist inclination. His features, even, are so calm \"as to provoke\r\nmany hostile and distrustful stares, as someone who is unknown and\r\nsuspicious.\"--Similarly, after the 31st of May and the 2nd of June,\r\nhis \"Souper de Beaucaire\" shows that if he condemns the departmental\r\ninsurrection it is mainly because he deems it futile: on the side of\r\nthe insurgents, a defeated army, no position tenable, no cavalry, raw\r\nartillerymen, Marseilles reduced to its own troops, full of hostile\r\nsans-culottes and so besieged, taken and pillaged. Chances are against\r\nit: \"Let the impoverished regions, the inhabitants of Vivaris, of the\r\nCevennes, of Corsica, fight to the last extremity, but if you lose a\r\nbattle and the fruit of a thousand years of fatigue, hardship, economy,\r\nand happiness become the soldier's prey.\"[1125] Here was something\r\nwith which the Girondists could be converted!--None of the political or\r\nsocial convictions which then exercised such control over men's minds\r\nhave any hold on him. Before the 9th of Thermidor he seemed to be a\r\n\"republican montagnard,\" and we follow him for months in Provence, \"the\r\nfavorite and confidential adviser of young Robespierre,\" \"admirer\"\r\nof the elder Robespierre,[1126] intimate at Nice with Charlotte\r\nRobespierre. After the 9th of Thermidor has passed, he frees himself\r\nwith bombast from this compromising friendship: \"I thought him sincere,\"\r\nsays he of the younger Robespierre, in a letter intended to be shown,\r\n\"but were he my father and had aimed at tyranny, I would have stabbed\r\nhim myself.\" On returning to Paris, after having knocked at several\r\ndoors, he takes Barras for a patron. Barras, the most brazen of the\r\ncorrupt, Barras, who has overthrown and contrived the death of his two\r\nformer protectors.[1127] Among the contending parties and fanaticisms\r\nwhich succeed each other he keeps cool and free to dispose of himself as\r\nhe pleases, indifferent to every cause and concerning himself only\r\nwith his own interests.--On the evening of the 12th of Vendémiaire,\r\non leaving the Feydeau theatre, and noticing the preparations of the\r\nsectionists,[1128] he said to Junot:\r\n\r\n\"Ah, if the sections put me in command, I would guarantee to place them\r\nin the Tuileries in two hours and have all those Convention rascals\r\ndriven out!\"\r\n\r\nFive hours later, summoned by Barras and the Conventionalists, he takes\r\n\"three minutes\" to make up his mind, and, instead of \"blowing up the\r\nrepresentatives,\" he mows down the Parisians. Like a good condottière,\r\nhe does not commit himself, considers the first that offers and then\r\nthe one who offers the most, only to back out afterwards, and finally,\r\nseizing the opportunity, to grab everything.--He will more and\r\nmore become a true condottière, that is to say, leader of a band,\r\nincreasingly independent, pretending to submit under the pretext of\r\nthe public good, looking out only for his own interest, self-centered,\r\ngeneral on his own account and for his own advantage in his Italian\r\ncampaign before and after the 18th of Fructidor.[1129] He is, however,\r\na condottière of the first class, already aspiring to the loftiest\r\nsummits, \"with no stopping-place but the throne or the scaffold,\"[1130]\r\n\"determined[1131] to master France, and through France Europe. Without\r\ndistraction, sleeping only three hours during the night,\" he plays\r\nwith ideas, men, religions, and governments, exploiting people with\r\nincomparable dexterity and brutality. He is, in the choice of means\r\nas of ends, a superior artist, inexhaustible in glamour, seductions,\r\ncorruption, and intimidation, fascinating, and yet more terrible than\r\nany wild beast suddenly released among a herd of browsing cattle. The\r\nexpression is not too strong and was uttered by an eye-witness, almost\r\nat this very date, a friend and a competent diplomat: \"You know that,\r\nwhile I am very fond of the dear general, I call him to myself the\r\nlittle tiger, so as to properly characterize his figure, tenacity, and\r\ncourage, the rapidity of his movements, and all that he has in him which\r\nmaybe fairly regarded in that sense.\"[1132]\r\n\r\nAt this very date, previous to official adulation and the adoption of\r\na recognized type, we see him face to face in two portraits drawn from\r\nlife, one physical, by a truthful painter, Guérin, and the other moral,\r\nby a superior woman, Madame de Staël, who to the best European culture\r\nadded tact and worldly perspicacity. Both portraits agree so perfectly\r\nthat each seems to interpret and complete the other. \"I saw him for the\r\nfirst time,\"[1133] says Madame de Staël, \"on his return to France after\r\nthe treaty of Campo-Formio. After recovering from the first excitement\r\nof admiration there succeeded to this a decided sentiment of fear.\" And\r\nyet, \"at this time he had no power, for it was even then supposed that\r\nthe Directory looked upon him with a good deal of suspicion.\" People\r\nregarded him sympathetically, and were even prepossessed in his favor;\r\n\r\n\"thus the fear he inspired was simply due to the singular effect of his\r\nperson on almost all who approached him. I had met men worthy of respect\r\nand had likewise met men of ferocious character; but nothing in the\r\nimpression which Bonaparte produced on me reminded me of either. I soon\r\nfound, in the various opportunities I had of meeting him during his stay\r\nin Paris, that his character was not to be described in terms commonly\r\nemployed; he was neither mild nor violent, nor gentle nor cruel, like\r\ncertain personages one happens to know. A being like him, wholly unlike\r\nanybody else, could neither feel nor excite sympathy; he was both\r\nmore and less than a man; his figure, intellect, and language bore the\r\nimprint of a foreign nationality.. .. far from being reassured on seeing\r\nBonaparte oftener, he intimidated me more and more every day. I had a\r\nconfused impression that he was not to be influenced by any emotion of\r\nsympathy or affection. He regards a human being as a fact, an object,\r\nand not as a fellow-creature. He neither hates nor loves, he exists for\r\nhimself alone; the rest of humanity are so many ciphers. The force of\r\nhis will consists in the imperturbable calculation of his egoism. He is\r\na skillful player who has the human species for an antagonist, and\r\nwhom he proposes to checkmate... Every time that I heard him talk I\r\nwas struck with his superiority; it bore no resemblance to that of men\r\ninformed and cultivated through study and social intercourse, such as\r\nwe find in France and England. His conversation indicated the tact\r\nof circumstances, like that of the hunter in pursuit of his prey. His\r\nspirit seemed a cold, keen sword-blade, which freezes while it wounds.\r\nI felt a profound irony in his mind, which nothing great or beautiful\r\ncould escape, not even his own fame, for he despised the nation whose\r\nsuffrages he sought... \"--\"With him, everything was means or aims;\r\nspontaneity, whether for good or for evil, was entirely absent.\"\r\n\r\nNo law, no ideal and abstract rule, existed for him;\r\n\r\n\"he examined things only with reference to their immediate usefulness; a\r\ngeneral principle was repugnant to him, either as so much nonsense or as\r\nan enemy.\"\r\n\r\nNow, if we contemplate Guérin's portrait,[1134] we see a spare body,\r\nwhose narrow shoulders under the uniform wrinkled by sudden movements,\r\nthe neck swathed in its high twisted cravat, the temples covered by\r\nlong, smooth, straight hair, exposing only the mask, the hard features\r\nintensified through strong contrasts of light and shade, the cheeks\r\nhollow up to the inner angle of the eye, the projecting cheek-bones, the\r\nmassive, protuberant jaw, the sinuous, mobile lips, pressed together as\r\nif attentive, the large, clear eyes, deeply sunk under the broad, arched\r\neyebrows, the fixed, oblique look, as penetrating as a rapier, and the\r\ntwo creases which extend from the base of the nose to the brow, as if\r\nin a frown of suppressed anger and determined will. Add to this the\r\naccounts of his contemporaries[1135] who saw or heard the curt accent or\r\nthe sharp, abrupt gesture, the interrogating, imperious, absolute tone\r\nof voice, and we comprehend how, the moment they accosted him, they felt\r\nthe dominating hand which seizes them, presses them down, holds them\r\nfirmly and never relaxes its grasp.\r\n\r\nAlready, at the receptions of the Directory, when conversing with men,\r\nor even with ladies, he puts questions \"which prove the superiority\r\nof the questioner to those who have to answer them.\"[1136] \"Are you\r\nmarried?\" says he to this one, and \"How many children have you?\"to\r\nanother. To that one, \"When did you come here?\" or, again, \"When are you\r\ngoing away? He places himself in front of a French lady, well-known for\r\nher beauty and wit and the vivacity of her opinions, \"like the stiffest\r\nof German generals, and says: 'Madame, I don't like women who meddle\r\nwith politics!'\" Equality, ease, familiarity and companionship, vanish\r\nat his approach. Eighteen months before this, on his appointment as\r\ncommander-in-chief of the army in Italy, Admiral Decrès, who had known\r\nhim well at Paris,[1137] learns that he is to pass through Toulon: \"I at\r\nonce propose to my comrades to introduce them, venturing to do so on my\r\nacquaintance with him in Paris. Full of eagerness and joy, I start off.\r\nThe door opens and I am about to press forwards,\" he afterwards wrote,\r\n\"when the attitude, the look, and the tone of voice suffice to arrest\r\nme. And yet there was nothing offensive about him; still, this was\r\nenough. I never tried after that to overstep the line thus imposed on\r\nme.\" A few days later, at Albenga,[1138] certain generals of division,\r\nand among them Augereau, a vulgar, heroic old soldier, vain of his tall\r\nfigure and courage, arrive at headquarters, not well disposed toward the\r\nlittle parvenu sent out to them from Paris. Recalling the description of\r\nhim which had been given to them, Augereau is abusive and insubordinate\r\nbeforehand: one of Barras' favorites, the Vendémiaire general, a street\r\ngeneral, \"not yet tried out on the field of battle,[1139] hasn't a\r\nfriend, considered a loner because he is the only one who can thinks for\r\nhimself, looking peaky, said to be a mathematician and a dreamer!\" They\r\nenter, and Bonaparte keeps them waiting. At last he appears, with his\r\nsword and belt on, explains the disposition of the forces, gives them\r\nhis orders, and dismisses them. Augereau has remained silent; It is only\r\nwhen he gets out of doors does he recover himself and fall back on his\r\naccustomed oaths. He admits to Massena that \"that little bastard of a\r\ngeneral frightened him.\" He cannot \"comprehend the ascendancy which made\r\nhim feel crushed right away.\"[1140]\r\n\r\nExtraordinary and superior, made for command[1141] and for conquest,\r\nsingular and of an unique species, is the feeling of all his\r\ncontemporaries. Those who are most familiar with the histories of other\r\nnations, Madame de Staël and, after her, Stendhal, go back to the\r\nright sources to comprehend him, to the \"petty Italian tyrants of the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries,\" to Castruccio-Castracani, to the\r\nBraccio of Mantua, to the Piccinino, the Malatestas of Rimini, and\r\nthe Sforzas of Milan. In their opinion, however, it is only a chance\r\nanalogy, a psychological resemblance. Really, however, and)historically\r\nit is a positive relationship. He is a descendant of the great Italians,\r\nthe men of action of the year 1400, the military adventurers, usurpers,\r\nand founders of governments lasting their life-time. He inherits in\r\ndirect affiliation their blood and inward organization, mental and\r\nmoral.[1142] A bud, collected in their forest, before the age of\r\nrefinement, impoverishment, and decay, has been transported into a\r\nsimilar and remote nursery, where a tragic and militant régime is\r\npermanently established. There the primitive germ is preserved intact\r\nand transmitted from one generation to another, renewed and invigorated\r\nby interbreeding. Finally, at the last stage of its growth, it springs\r\nout of the ground and develops magnificently, blooming the same as ever,\r\nand producing the same fruit as on the original stem. Modern cultivation\r\nand French gardening have pruned away but very few of its branches and\r\nblunted a few of its thorns: its original texture, inmost substance,\r\nand spontaneous development have not changed. The soil of France and of\r\nEurope, however, broken up by revolutionary tempests, is more favorable\r\nto its roots than the worn-out fields of the Middle Ages and there it\r\ngrows by itself, without being subject, like its Italian ancestors, to\r\nrivalry with its own species; nothing checks the growth; it may absorb\r\nall the juices of the ground, all the air and sunshine of the region,\r\nand become the Colossus which the ancient plants, equally deep-rooted\r\nand certainly as absorbent, but born in a less friable soil and more\r\ncrowded together, could not provide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The Leader and Statesman\r\n\r\n     Intelligence during the Italian Renaissance and at the\r\n     present day.--Integrity of Bonaparte's mental machinery.\r\n     --Flexibility, force, and tenacity of his attention.--Another\r\n     difference between Napoleon's intellect and that of his\r\n     contemporaries.--He thinks objects and not words.--His\r\n     antipathy to Ideology.--Little or no literary or\r\n     philosophical education.--Self-taught through direct\r\n     observation and technical instruction.--His fondness for\r\n     details.--His inward vision of physical objects and places.\r\n     --His mental portrayal of positions, distances, and\r\n     quantities.\r\n\r\n\"The human plant,\" said Alfieri, \"is in no country born more vigorous\r\nthan in Italy\"; and never, in Italy, was it so vigorous as from 1300 to\r\n1500, from the contemporaries of Dante down to those of Michael\r\nAngelo, Caesar Borgia, Julius II., and Macchiavelli.[1143] The first\r\ndistinguishing mark of a man of those times is the soundness of his\r\nmental instrument. Nowadays, after three hundred years of service,\r\nours has lost somewhat of its moral fiber, sharpness, and versatility:\r\nusually the compulsory specialization has caused it to become lop-sided\r\nmaking it unfit for other purposes. What's more, the increase in\r\nready-made ideas and clichés and acquired methods incrusts it and\r\nreduces its scope to a sort of routine. Finally, it is exhausted by\r\nan excess of intellectual activity and diminished by the continuity of\r\nsedentary habits. It is just the opposite with those impulsive minds\r\nof uncorrupted blood and of a new stock.--Roederer, a competent and\r\nindependent judge, who, at the beginning of the consular government,\r\nsees Bonaparte daily at the meetings of the Council of State, and who\r\nnotes down every evening the impressions of the day, is carried away\r\nwith admiration:[1144]\r\n\r\n\"Punctual at every sitting, prolonging the session five or six hours,\r\ndiscussing before and afterwards the subjects brought forward, always\r\nreturning to two questions, 'Can that be justified?[1145]' 'Is that\r\nuseful?' examining each question in itself, in these two respects, after\r\nhaving subjected it to a most exact and sharp analysis; next, consulting\r\nthe best authorities, the pasts, experience, and obtaining information\r\nabout bygone jurisprudence, the laws of Louis XIV. and of Frederick the\r\nGreat.... Never did the council adjourn without its members knowing more\r\nthan the day before; if not through knowledge derived from him, at least\r\nthrough the researches he obliged them to make. Never did the members\r\nof the Senate and the Legislative Corps, or of the tribunals, pay their\r\nrespects to him without being rewarded for their homage by valuable\r\ninstructions. He cannot be surrounded by public men without being the\r\nstatesman, all forming for him a council of state.\"\r\n\r\n\"What characterizes him above them all,\" is not alone the penetration\r\nand universality of his comprehension, but likewise and especially \"the\r\nforce, flexibility, and constancy of his attention. He can work eighteen\r\nhours at a stretch, on one or on several subjects. I never saw him\r\ntired. I never found his mind lacking in inspiration, even when weary\r\nin body, nor when violently exercised, nor when angry. I never saw him\r\ndiverted from one matter by another, turning from that under discussion\r\nto one he had just finished or was about to take up. The news, good\r\nor bad, he received from Egypt, did not divert his mind from the civil\r\ncode, nor the civil code from the combinations which the safety of Egypt\r\nrequired. Never did a man more wholly devote himself to the work in\r\nhand, nor better devote his time to what he had to do. Never did a mind\r\nmore inflexibly set aside the occupation or thought which did not come\r\nat the right day or hour, never was one more ardent in seeking it, more\r\nalert in its pursuit, more capable of fixing it when the time came to\r\ntake it up.\"\r\n\r\nHe himself said later on:[1146]\r\n\r\n\"Various subjects and affairs are stowed away in my brain as in a chest\r\nof drawers. When I want to take up any special business I shut one\r\ndrawer and open another. None of them ever get mixed, and never does\r\nthis incommode me or fatigue me. If I feel sleepy I shut all the drawers\r\nand go to sleep.\"\r\n\r\nNever has brain so disciplined and under such control been seen, one so\r\nready at all times for any task, so capable of immediate and absolute\r\nconcentration. Its flexibility[1147] is wonderful, \"in the instant\r\napplication of every faculty and energy, and bringing them all to bear\r\nat once on any object that concerns him, on a mite as well as on an\r\nelephant, on any given individual as well as on an enemy's army. ...\r\nWhen specially occupied, other things do not exist for him; it is a sort\r\nof chase from which nothing diverts him.\" And this hot pursuit, which\r\nnothing arrests save capture, this tenacious hunt, this headlong course\r\nby one to whom the goal is never other than a fresh starting-point, is\r\nthe spontaneous gait, the natural, even pace which his mind prefers.\r\n\r\n\"I am always at work,\" says he to Roederer.[1148] \"I meditate a great\r\ndeal. If I seem always equal to the occasion, ready to face what\r\ncomes, it is because I have thought the matter over a long time before\r\nundertaking it. I have anticipated whatever might happen. It is no\r\nspirit which suddenly reveals to me what I ought to do or say in any\r\nunlooked-for circumstance, but my own reflection, my own meditation. ...\r\nI work all the time, at dinner, in the theatre. I wake up at night in\r\norder to resume my work. I got up last night at two o'clock. I stretched\r\nmyself on my couch before the fire to examine the army reports sent to\r\nme by the Minister of War. I found twenty mistakes in them, and made\r\nnotes which I have this morning sent to the minister, who is now engaged\r\nwith his clerks in rectifying them.\"--\r\n\r\nHis associates weaken and sink under the burden imposed on them and\r\nwhich he supports without feeling the weight. When Consul,[1149] \"he\r\nsometimes presides at special meetings of the section of the interior\r\nfrom ten o'clock in the evening until five o'clock in the morning..\r\n.. Often, at Saint-Cloud, he keeps the counselors of state from nine\r\no'clock in the morning until five in the evening, with fifteen minutes'\r\nintermission, and seems no more fatigued at the close of the session\r\nthan when it began.\" During the night sessions \"many of the members\r\nsuccumb through weariness, while the Minister of War falls asleep\";\r\nhe gives them a shake and wakes them up, \"Come, come, citizens, let us\r\nbestir ourselves, it is only two o'clock and we must earn the money\r\nthe French people pay us.\" Consul or Emperor,[1150] \"he demands of each\r\nminister an account of the smallest details: It is not rare to see\r\nthem leaving the council room overcome with fatigue, due to the long\r\ninterrogatories to which he has subjected them; he appears not to have\r\nnoticed, and talks about the day's work simply as a relaxation which has\r\nscarcely given his mind exercise.\" And what is worse, \"it often happens\r\nthat on returning home they find a dozen of his letters requiring\r\nimmediate response, for which the whole night scarcely suffices.\" The\r\nquantity of facts he is able to retain and store away, the quantity of\r\nideas he elaborates and produces, seems to surpass human capacity, and\r\nthis insatiable, inexhaustible, unmovable brain thus keeps on working\r\nuninterruptedly for thirty years.\r\n\r\nThrough another result of the same mental organization, Napoleon's brain\r\nis never unproductive; that's today our great danger.--During the past\r\nthree hundred years we have more and more lost sight of the exact and\r\ndirect meaning of things. Subject to the constraints of a conservative,\r\ncomplex, and extended educational system we study\r\n\r\n* the symbols of objects rather than on the objects themselves;\r\n\r\n* instead of the ground itself, a map of it;\r\n\r\n* instead of animals struggling for existence,[1151] nomenclatures and\r\nclassifications, or, at best, stuffed specimens displayed in a museum;\r\n\r\n* instead of persons who feel and act, statistics, codes, histories,\r\nliteratures, and philosophies;\r\n\r\nin short, printed words. Even worse, abstract terms, which from century\r\nto century have become more abstract and therefore further removed\r\nfrom experience, more difficult to understand, less adaptable and more\r\ndeceptive, especially in all that relates to human life and society.\r\nHere, due to the growth of government, to the multiplication of\r\nservices, to the entanglement of interests, the object, indefinitely\r\nenlarged and complex, now eludes our grasp. Our vague, incomplete,\r\nincorrect idea of it badly corresponds with it, or does not correspond\r\nat all. In nine minds out of ten, or perhaps ninety-nine out of a\r\nhundred, it is but little more than a word. The others, if they desire\r\nsome significant indication of what society actually is beyond the\r\nteachings of books, require ten or fifteen years of close observation\r\nand study to re-think the phrases with which these have filled their\r\nmemory, to interpret them anew, to make clear their meaning, to get at\r\nand verify their sense, to substitute for the more or less empty and\r\nindefinite term the fullness and precision of a personal impression. We\r\nhave seen how ideas of Society, State, Government, Sovereignty, Rights,\r\nLiberty, the most important of all ideas, were, at the close of the\r\neighteenth century, curtailed and falsified; how, in most minds, simple\r\nverbal reasoning combined them together in dogmas and axioms; what an\r\noffspring these metaphysical simulacra gave birth to, how many lifeless\r\nand grotesque abortions, how many monstrous and destructive chimeras.\r\nThere is no place for any of these fanciful dreams in the mind of\r\nBonaparte; they cannot arise in it, nor find access to it; his aversion\r\nto the unsubstantial phantoms of political abstraction extends beyond\r\ndisdain, even to disgust.[1152] That which was then called ideology, is\r\nhis particular bugbear; he loathes it not alone through calculation,\r\nbut still more through an instinctive demand for what is real, as a\r\npractical man and statesman, always keeping in mind, like the great\r\nCatherine, \"that he is operating, not on paper, but on the human hide,\r\nwhich is ticklish.\" Every idea entertained by him had its origin in\r\nhis personal observation, and he used his own personal observations to\r\ncontrol them.\r\n\r\nIf books are useful to him it is to suggest questions, which he never\r\nanswers but through his own experience. He has read only a little, and\r\nhastily;[1153] his classical education is rudimentary; in the way of\r\nLatin, he remained in the lower class. The instruction he got at the\r\nMilitary Academy as well as at Brienne was below mediocrity, while,\r\nafter Brienne, it is stated that \"for the languages and belles-lettres,\r\nhe had no taste.\" Next to this, the literature of elegance and\r\nrefinement, the philosophy of the closet and drawing-room, with which\r\nhis contemporaries are imbued, glided over his intellect as over a hard\r\nrock. None but mathematical truths and positive notions about geography\r\nand history found their way into his mind and deeply impressed it.\r\nEverything else, as with his predecessors of the fifteenth century,\r\ncomes to him through the original, direct action of his faculties in\r\ncontact with men and things, through his prompt and sure tact, his\r\nindefatigable and minute attention, his indefinitely repeated and\r\nrectified divinations during long hours of solitude and silence.\r\nPractice, and not speculation, is the source of his instruction, the\r\nsame as with a mechanic brought up amongst machinery.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing relating to warfare that I cannot make myself. If\r\nnobody knows how to make gunpowder, I do. I can construct gun-carriages.\r\nIf cannon must be cast, I will see that it is done properly. If tactical\r\ndetails must be taught, I will teach them.\"[1154]\r\n\r\nThis is why he is competent right from the beginning, general in the\r\nartillery, major-general, diplomatist, financier and administrator of\r\nall kinds. Thanks to this fertile apprenticeship, beginning with the\r\nConsulate, he shows officials and veteran ministers who send in their\r\nreports to him what to do.\r\n\r\n\"I am a more experienced administrator than they,[1155] when one has\r\nbeen obliged to extract from his brains the ways and means with which to\r\nfeed, maintain, control, and move with the same spirit and will two or\r\nthree hundred thousand men, a long distance from their country, one has\r\nsoon discovered the secrets of administration.\"\r\n\r\nIn each of the human machines he builds and manipulates, he perceives\r\nright away all the parts, each in its proper place and function, the\r\nmotors, the transmissions, the wheels, the composite action, the speed\r\nwhich ensues, the final result, the complete effect, the net product.\r\nNever is he content with a superficial and summary inspection; he\r\npenetrates into obscure corners and to the lowest depths \"through\r\nthe technical precision of his questions,\" with the lucidity of\r\na specialist, and in this way, borrowing an expression from the\r\nphilosophers, with him the concept should be adequate to its\r\npurpose.[1156]\r\n\r\nHence his eagerness for details, for these form the body and substance\r\nof the concept; the hand that has not grasped these, or lets them go,\r\nretains only the shell, an envelope. With respect to these his curiosity\r\nis \"insatiable.\"[1157] In each ministerial department he knows more than\r\nthe ministers, and in each bureau he knows as much as the clerks. \"On\r\nhis table[1158] lie reports of the positions of his forces on land and\r\non water. He has furnished the plans of these, and fresh ones are issued\r\nevery month\"; such is the daily reading he likes best.\r\n\r\n\"I have my reports on positions always at hand; my memory for an\r\nAlexandrine is not good, but I never forget a syllable of my reports on\r\npositions. I shall find them in my room this evening, and I shall not go\r\nto bed until I have read them.\"\r\n\r\nHe always knows \"his position\" on land and at sea better than is known\r\nin the War and Navy departments; better even than his staff-officers the\r\nnumber, size, and qualities of his ships in or out of port, the present\r\nand future state of vessels under construction, the composition and\r\nstrength of their crews, the formation, organization, staff of officers,\r\nmaterial, stations, and enlistments, past and to come, of each army\r\ncorps and of each regiment. It is the same in the financial and\r\ndiplomatic services, in every branch of the administration, laic or\r\necclesiastical, in the physical order and in the moral order. His\r\ntopographical memory and his geographical conception of countries,\r\nplaces, ground, and obstacles culminate in an inward vision which he\r\nevokes at will, and which, years afterwards, revives as fresh as on the\r\nfirst day. His calculation of distances, marches, and maneuvers is so\r\nrigid a mathematical operation that, frequently, at a distance of two\r\nor four hundred leagues,[1159] his military foresight, calculated two\r\nor four months ahead, turns out correct, almost on the day named, and\r\nprecisely on the spot designated.[1160] Add to this one other faculty,\r\nand the rarest of all. For, if things turn out as he foresaw they would,\r\nit is because, as with great chess-players, he has accurately measured\r\nnot alone the mechanical moves of the pieces, but the character and\r\ntalent of his adversary, \"sounded his draft of water,\" and divined his\r\nprobable mistakes. He has added the calculation of physical quantities\r\nand probabilities to the calculation of moral quantities and\r\nprobabilities, thus showing himself as great a psychologist as he is an\r\naccomplished strategist. In fact, no one has surpassed him in the art\r\nof judging the condition and motives of an individual or of a group of\r\npeople, the real motives, permanent or temporary, which drive or curb\r\nmen in general or this or that man in particular, the incentives to be\r\nemployed, the kind and degree of pressure to be employed. This central\r\nfaculty rules all the others, and in the art of mastering Man his genius\r\nis found supreme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. His acute Understanding of Others.\r\n\r\n     His psychological faculty and way of getting at the thought\r\n     and feeling of others.--His self-analysis.--How he imagines\r\n     a general situation by selecting a particular case,\r\n     imagining the invisible interior by deducting from the\r\n     visible exterior.--Originality and superiority of his style\r\n     and discourse.--His adaptation of these to his hearers and\r\n     to circumstances.--His notation and calculation of\r\n     serviceable motives.\r\n\r\nNo faculty is more precious for a political engineer; for the forces he\r\nacts upon are never other than human passions. But how, except\r\nthrough divination, can these passions, which grow out of the deepest\r\nsentiments, be reached? How, save by conjecture, can forces be estimated\r\nwhich seem to defy all measurement? On this dark and uncertain ground,\r\nwhere one has to grope one's way, Napoleon moves with almost absolute\r\ncertainty; he moves promptly. First of all, he studies himself; indeed,\r\nto find one's way into another's soul requires, preliminarily, that one\r\nshould dive deep into one's own.[1161]\r\n\r\n\"I have always delighted in analysis,\" said he, one day, \"and should I\r\never fall seriously in love I would take my sentiment to pieces. Why and\r\nHow are such important questions one cannot put them to one's self too\r\noften.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is certain,\" writes an observer, \"that he, of all men, is the one\r\nwho has most meditated on the why which controls human actions.\"\r\n\r\nHis method, that of the experimental sciences, consists in testing every\r\nhypothesis or deduction by some positive fact, observed by him under\r\ndefinite conditions; a physical force being ascertained and accurately\r\nmeasured through the deviation of a needle, or through the rise and\r\nfall of a fluid, this or that invisible moral force can likewise be\r\nascertained and approximately measured through some emotional sign, some\r\ndecisive manifestation, consisting of a certain word, tone, or gesture.\r\nIt is these words, tones, and gestures which he dwells on; he detects\r\ninward sentiments by the outward expression; he figures to himself\r\nthe internal by the external, by some facial appearance, some telling\r\nattitude, some brief and topical scene, by such specimen and shortcuts,\r\nso well chosen and detailed that they provide a summary of the\r\ninnumerable series of analogous cases. In this way, the vague, fleeting\r\nobject is suddenly arrested, brought to bear, and then gauged and\r\nweighed, like some impalpable gas collected and kept in a graduated\r\ntransparent glass tube.--Accordingly, at the Council of State, while the\r\nothers, either jurists or administrators, see abstractions, articles of\r\nthe law and precedents, he sees people as they are--the Frenchman, the\r\nItalian, the German; that of the peasant, the workman, the bourgeois,\r\nthe noble, the returned émigré,[1162] the soldier, the officer and the\r\nfunctionary--everywhere the individual man as he is, the man who plows,\r\nmanufactures, fights, marries, brings forth children, toils, enjoys\r\nhimself, and dies.--Nothing is more striking than the contrast between\r\nthe dull, grave arguments advanced by the wise official editor, and\r\nNapoleon's own words caught on the wing, at the moment, vibrating and\r\nteeming with illustrations and imagery.[1163] Apropos of divorce, the\r\nprinciple of which he wishes to maintain:\r\n\r\n\"Consult, now, national manners and customs. Adultery is no phenomenon;\r\nit is common enough--une affaire de canapé... There must be some curb on\r\nwomen who commit adultery for trinkets, poetry, Apollo, and the muses,\r\netc.\"\r\n\r\nBut if divorce be allowed for incompatibility of temper you undermine\r\nmarriage; the fragility of the bond will be apparent the moment the\r\nobligation is contracted;\r\n\r\n\"it is just as if a man said to himself, 'I am going to marry until I\r\nfeel different.'\"\r\n\r\nNullity of marriage must not be too often allowed; once a marriage is\r\nmade it is a serious matter to undo it.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose that, in marrying my cousin just arrived from the Indies, I wed\r\nan adventuress. She bears me children, and I then discover she is not my\r\ncousin--is that marriage valid? Does not public morality demand that it\r\nshould be so considered? There has been a mutual exchange of hearts, of\r\ntranspiration.\"\r\n\r\nOn the right of children to be supported and fed although of age, he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"Will you allow a father to drive a girl of fifteen out of his house? A\r\nfather worth 60,000 francs a year might say to his son, 'You are stout\r\nand fat; go and turn plowman.' The children of a rich father, or of one\r\nin good circumstances, are always entitled to the paternal porridge.\r\nStrike out their right to be fed, and you compel children to murder\r\ntheir parents.\"\r\n\r\nAs to adoption:\r\n\r\n\"You regard this as law-makers and not as statesmen. It is not a civil\r\ncontract nor a judicial contract. The analysis (of the jurist) leads\r\nto vicious results. Man is governed by imagination only; without\r\nimagination he is a brute. It is not for five cents a day, simply to\r\ndistinguish himself, that a man consents to be killed; if you want to\r\nelectrify him touch his heart. A notary, who is paid a fee of twelve\r\nfrancs for his services, cannot do that. It requires some other process,\r\na legislative act. Adoption, what is that? An imitation by which society\r\ntries to counterfeit nature. It is a new kind of sacrament.... Society\r\nordains that the bones and blood of one being shall be changed into the\r\nbones and blood of another. It is the greatest of all legal acts.\r\nIt gives the sentiments of a son to one who never had them, and\r\nreciprocally those of a parent. Where ought this to originate? From on\r\nhigh, like a clap of thunder!\"\r\n\r\nAll his expressions are bright flashes one after another.[1164] Nobody,\r\nsince Voltaire and Galiani, has launched forth such a profusion of them;\r\non society, laws, government, France and the French, some penetrate and\r\nexplain, like those of Montesquieu, as if with a flash of lightening.\r\nHe does not hammer them out laboriously, but they burst forth, the\r\noutpourings of his intellect, its natural, involuntary, constant action.\r\nAnd what adds to their value is that, outside of councils and private\r\nconversations, he abstains from them, employing them only in the service\r\nof thought; at other times he subordinates them to the end he has in\r\nview, which is always their practical effect. Ordinarily, he writes and\r\nspeaks in a different language, in a language suited to his audience;\r\nhe dispenses with the oddities, the irregular improvisations and\r\nimagination, the outbursts of genius and inspiration. He retains and\r\nuses merely those which are intended to impress the personage whom he\r\nwishes to dazzle with a great idea of himself, such as Pius VII., or the\r\nEmperor Alexander. In this case, his conversational tone is that of\r\na caressing, expansive, amiable familiarity; he is then before the\r\nfootlights, and when he acts he can play all parts, tragedy or comedy,\r\nwith the same life and spirit whether he fulminates, insinuates, or\r\neven affects simplicity. When he is with his generals, ministers, and\r\nprincipal performers, he falls back on the concise, positive, technical\r\nbusiness style; any other would be harmful. The keen mind only reveals\r\nitself through the brevity and imperious strength and rudeness of\r\nthe accent. For his armies and the common run of men, he has his\r\nproclamations and bulletins, that is to say, sonorous phrases\r\ncomposed for effect, a statement of facts purposely simplified and\r\nfalsified,[1165] in short, an excellent effervescent wine, good for\r\nexciting enthusiasm, and an equally excellent narcotic for maintaining\r\ncredulity,[1166] a sort of popular mixture to be distributed just at\r\nthe proper time, and whose ingredients are so well proportioned that\r\nthe public drinks it with delight, and becomes at once intoxicated.--His\r\nstyle on every occasion, whether affected or spontaneous, shows his\r\nwonderful knowledge of the masses and of individuals; except in two or\r\nthree cases, on one exalted domain, of which he always remains ignorant,\r\nhe has ever hit the mark, applying the appropriate lever, giving just\r\nthe push, weight, and degree of impulsion which best accomplishes his\r\npurpose. A series of brief, accurate memoranda, corrected daily, enables\r\nhim to frame for himself a sort of psychological tablet whereon he notes\r\ndown and sums up, in almost numerical valuation, the mental and moral\r\ndispositions, characters, faculties, passions, and aptitudes, the strong\r\nor weak points, of the innumerable human beings, near or remote, on whom\r\nhe operates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. His Wonderful Memory.\r\n\r\n     His Three Atlases.--Their scale and completeness.\r\n\r\nLet us try for a moment to show the range and contents of this\r\nintellect; we may have to go back to Caesar to his equal; but, for lack\r\nof documents, we have nothing of Caesar but general features--a summary\r\noutline. Of Napoleon we have, besides the perfect outline, the features\r\nin detail. Read his correspondence, day by day, then chapter by\r\nchapter;[1167] for example, in 1806, after the battle of Austerlitz, or,\r\nstill better, in 1809, after his return from Spain, up to the peace of\r\nVienna; whatever our technical shortcomings may be, we shall find that\r\nhis mind, in its comprehensiveness and amplitude, largely surpasses all\r\nknown or even credible proportions.\r\n\r\nHe has mentally within him three principal atlases, always at hand, each\r\ncomposed of \"about twenty note-books,\" each distinct and each regularly\r\nposted up.--\r\n\r\n1. The first one is military, forming a vast collection of topographical\r\ncharts as minute as those of an general staff, with detailed plans of\r\nevery stronghold, also specific indications and the local distribution\r\nof all forces on sea and on land--crews, regiments, batteries, arsenals,\r\nstorehouses, present and future resources in supplies of men, horses,\r\nvehicles, arms, munitions, food, and clothing.\r\n\r\n2. The second, which is civil, resembles the heavy, thick volumes\r\npublished every year, in which we now read the state of the budget, and\r\ncomprehend, first, the innumerable items of ordinary and extraordinary\r\nreceipt and expenditure, internal taxes, foreign contributions,\r\nthe products of the domains in France and out of France, the fiscal\r\nservices, pensions, public works, and the rest; next, all administrative\r\nstatistics, the hierarchy of functions and of functionaries, senators,\r\ndeputies, ministers, prefects, bishops, professors, judges, and those\r\nunder their orders, each where he resides, with his rank, jurisdiction,\r\nand salary.\r\n\r\n3. The third is a vast biographical and moral dictionary, in which, as\r\nin the pigeon-holes of the Chief of Police, each notable personage and\r\nlocal group, each professional or social body, and even each population,\r\nhas its label, along with a brief note on its situation, needs, and\r\nantecedents, and, therefore, its demonstrated character, eventual\r\ndisposition, and probable conduct. Each label, card, or strip of paper\r\nhas its summary; all these partial summaries, methodically classified,\r\nterminate in totals, and the totals of the three atlases, combined\r\ntogether, thus furnish their possessor with an estimate of his\r\ndisposable forces.\r\n\r\nNow, in 1809, however full these atlases, they are clearly imprinted on\r\nNapoleon's mind he knows not only the total and the partial summaries,\r\nbut also the slightest details; he reads them readily and at every hour;\r\nhe comprehends in a mass, and in all particulars, the various nations he\r\ngoverns directly, or through some one else; that is to say, 60,000,000\r\nmen, the different countries he has conquered or overrun, consisting of\r\n70,000 square leagues[1168]. At first, France increased by the addition\r\nof Belgium and Piedmont; next Spain, from which he is just returned,\r\nand where he has placed his brother Joseph; southern Italy, where, after\r\nJoseph, he has placed Murat; central Italy, where he occupies Rome;\r\nnorthern Italy, where Eugène is his delegate; Dalmatia and Istria, which\r\nhe has joined to his empire; Austria, which he invades for the second\r\ntime; the Confederation of the Rhine, which he has made and which\r\nhe directs; Westphalia and Holland, where his brothers are only his\r\nlieutenants; Prussia, which he has subdued and mutilated and which he\r\noppresses, and the strongholds of which he still retains; and, add\r\na last mental tableau, that which represents the northern seas, the\r\nAtlantic and the Mediterranean, all the fleets of the continent at sea\r\nand in port from Dantzic to Flessingen and Bayonne, from Cadiz to Toulon\r\nand Gaëta, from Tarentum to Venice, Corfu, and Constantinople.[1169]--On\r\nthe psychological and moral atlas, besides a primitive gap which he will\r\nnever fill up, because this is a characteristic trait, there are some\r\nestimates which are wrong, especially with regard to the Pope and to\r\nCatholic conscience. In like manner he rates the energy of national\r\nsentiment in Spain and Germany too low. He rates too high his own\r\nprestige in France and in the countries annexed to her, the balance of\r\nconfidence and zeal on which he may rely. But these errors are rather\r\nthe product of his will than of his intelligence, he recognizes them at\r\nintervals; if he has illusions it is because he fabricates them; left\r\nto himself his good sense would rest infallible, it is only his passions\r\nwhich blurred the lucidity of his intellect.--As to the other two\r\natlases, the topographical and the military, they are as complete and as\r\nexact as ever; No matter how much the realities they contain will swell\r\nand daily become ever more complex, they continue to correspond to it in\r\ntheir fullness and precision, trait for trait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. His Imagination and its Excesses.\r\n\r\n     His constructive imagination.--His projects and dreams.\r\n     --Manifestation of the master faculty and its excesses.\r\n\r\nBut this multitude of information and observations form only the\r\nsmallest portion of the mental population swarming in this immense\r\nbrain; for, on his idea of the real, germinate and swarm his concepts of\r\nthe possible; without these concepts there would be no way to handle and\r\ntransform things, and that he did handle and transform them we all know.\r\nBefore acting, he has decided on his plan, and if this plan is adopted,\r\nit is one among several others,[1170] after examining, comparing,\r\nand giving it the preference; he has accordingly thought over all the\r\nothers. Behind each combination adopted by him we detect those he has\r\nrejected; there are dozens of them behind each of his decisions, each\r\nmaneuver effected, each treaty signed, each decree promulgated, each\r\norder issued, and I venture to say, behind almost every improvised\r\naction or word spoken. For calculation enters into everything he does,\r\neven into his apparent expansiveness, also into his outbursts when in\r\nearnest; if he gives way to these, it is on purpose, foreseeing the\r\neffect, with a view to intimidate or to dazzle. He turns everything in\r\nothers as well as in himself to account--his passion, his vehemence, his\r\nweaknesses, his talkativeness, he exploits it all for the advancement\r\nof the edifice he is constructing.[1171] Certainly among his diverse\r\nfaculties, however great, that of the constructive imagination is\r\nthe most powerful. At the very beginning we feel its heat and boiling\r\nintensity beneath the coolness and rigidity of his technical and\r\npositive instructions.\r\n\r\n\"When I plan a battle,\" said he to Roederer, \"no man is more spineless\r\nthan I am. I over exaggerate to myself all the dangers and all the evils\r\nthat are possible under the circumstances. I am in a state of truly\r\npainful agitation. But this does not prevent me from appearing quite\r\ncomposed to people around me; I am like a woman giving birth to a\r\nchild.[1172]\r\n\r\nPassionately, in the throes of the creator, he is thus absorbed with\r\nhis coming creation; he already anticipates and enjoys living in his\r\nimaginary edifice. \"General,\" said Madame de Clermont-Tonnerre to him,\r\none day, \"you are building behind a scaffolding which you will take\r\ndown when you have done with it.\" \"Yes, Madame, that's it,\"\r\nreplied Bonaparte; \"you are right. I am always living two years in\r\nadvance.\"[1173] His response came with \"incredible vivacity,\" as if a\r\nsudden inspiration, that of a soul stirred in its innermost fiber.--Here\r\nas well, the power, the speed, fertility, play, and abundance of his\r\nthought seem unlimited. What he has accomplished is astonishing, but\r\nwhat he has undertaken is more so; and whatever he may have undertaken\r\nis far surpassed by what he has imagined. However vigorous his practical\r\nfaculty, his poetical faculty is stronger; it is even too vigorous for\r\na statesman; its grandeur is exaggerated into enormity, and its enormity\r\ndegenerates into madness. In Italy, after the 18th of Fructidor, he said\r\nto Bourrienne:\r\n\r\n\"Europe is a molehill; never have there been great empires and\r\ngreat revolutions, except in the Orient, with its 600,000,000\r\ninhabitants.\"[1174]\r\n\r\nThe following year at Saint-Jean d'Acre, on the eve of the last assault,\r\nhe added\r\n\r\n\"If I succeed I shall find in the town the pasha's treasure and arms\r\nfor 300,000 men. I stir up and arm all Syria.... I march on Damascus\r\nand Aleppo; as I advance in the country my army will increase with the\r\ndiscontented. I proclaim to the people the abolition of slavery, and\r\nof the tyrannical government of the pashas. I reach Constantinople with\r\narmed masses. I overthrow the Turkish Empire; I found in the East a new\r\nand grand empire, which fixes my place with posterity, and perhaps I\r\nreturn to Paris by the way of Adrianople, or by Vienna, after having\r\nannihilated the house of Austria.\" [1175]\r\n\r\nBecome consul, and then emperor, he often referred to this happy period,\r\nwhen, \"rid of the restraints of a troublesome civilization,\" he could\r\nimagine at will and construct at pleasure.[1176]\r\n\r\n\"I created a religion; I saw myself on the road to Asia, mounted on an\r\nelephant, with a turban on my head, and in my hand a new Koran, which I\r\ncomposed to suit myself.\"\r\n\r\nConfined to Europe, he thinks, after 1804, that he will reorganize\r\nCharlemagne's empire.\r\n\r\n\"The French Empire will become the mother country of other\r\nsovereignties... I mean that every king in Europe shall build a grand\r\npalace at Paris for his own use; on the coronation of the Emperor of\r\nthe French these kings will come and occupy it; they will grace\r\nthis imposing ceremony with their presence, and honor it with their\r\nsalutations.\"[1177] The Pope will come; he came to the first one; he\r\nmust necessarily return to Paris, and fix himself there permanently.\r\nWhere could the Holy See be better off than in the new capital of\r\nChristianity, under Napoleon, heir to Charlemagne, and temporal\r\nsovereign of the Sovereign Pontiff? Through the temporal the emperor\r\nwill control the spiritual,[1178] and through the Pope, consciences.\"\r\n\r\nIn November, 1811, unusually excited, he says to De Pradt:\r\n\r\n\"In five years I shall be master of the world; only Russia will remain,\r\nbut I will crush her.[1179]... Paris will extend out to St. Cloud.\"\r\n\r\nTo render Paris the physical capital of Europe is, through his own\r\nconfession, \"one of his constant dreams.\"\r\n\r\n\"At times,\" he says,[1180]\"I would like to see her a city of two, three,\r\nfour millions of inhabitants, something fabulous, colossal, unknown down\r\nto our day, and its public establishments adequate to its population....\r\nArchimedes proposed to lift the world if he could be allowed to place\r\nhis lever; for myself, I would have changed it wherever I could have\r\nbeen allowed to exercise my energy, perseverance, and budgets.\"\r\n\r\nAt all events, he believes so; for however lofty and badly supported\r\nthe next story of his structure may be, he has always ready a new\r\nstory, loftier and more unsteady, to put above it. A few months before\r\nlaunching himself, with all Europe at his back, against Russia, he said\r\nto Narbonne:[1181]\r\n\r\n\"After all, my dear sir, this long road is the road to India. Alexander\r\nstarted as far off as Moscow to reach the Ganges; this has occurred\r\nto me since St. Jean d'Acre.... To reach England to-day I need the\r\nextremity of Europe, from which to take Asia in the rear.... Suppose\r\nMoscow taken, Russia subdued, the czar reconciled, or dead through some\r\ncourt conspiracy, perhaps another and dependent throne, and tell me\r\nwhether it is not possible for a French army, with its auxiliaries,\r\nsetting out from Tiflis, to get as far as the Ganges, where it needs\r\nonly a thrust of the French sword to bring down the whole of that grand\r\ncommercial scaffolding throughout India. It would be the most gigantic\r\nexpedition, I admit, but practicable in the nineteenth century. Through\r\nit France, at one stroke, would secure the independence of the West and\r\nthe freedom of the seas.\"\r\n\r\nWhile uttering this his eyes shone with strange brilliancy, and he\r\naccumulates subjects, weighing obstacles, means, and chances: the\r\ninspiration is under full headway, and he gives himself up to it. The\r\nmaster faculty finds itself suddenly free, and it takes flight; the\r\nartist,[1182] locked up in politics, has escaped from his sheath; he is\r\ncreating out of the ideal and the impossible. We take him for what\r\nhe is, a posthumous brother of Dante and Michael Angelo. In the clear\r\noutlines of his vision, in the intensity, coherency, and inward logic\r\nof his dreams, in the profundity of his meditations, in the superhuman\r\ngrandeur of his conceptions, he is, indeed, their fellow and their\r\nequal. His genius is of the same stature and the same structure; he is\r\none of the three sovereign minds of the Italian Renaissance. Only, while\r\nthe first two operated on paper and on marble, the latter operates on\r\nthe living being, on the sensitive and suffering flesh of humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1101: Reforms introduced by Napoleon after his coup d'état 9\r\nNov. 1799.

This correspondance,\r\nunfortunately, is still incomplete, while, after the sixth volume, it\r\nmust not be forgotten that much of it has been purposely stricken out.\r\n\"In general,\" say the editors (XVI., p.4), \"we have been governed simply\r\nby this plain rule, that we were required to publish only what the\r\nEmperor himself would have given to the public had he survived himself,\r\nand, anticipating the verdict of time, exposed to posterity his own\r\npersonality and system.\"--The savant who has the most carefully examined\r\nthis correspondence, entire in the French archives, estimates that it\r\ncomprises about 80,000 pieces, of which 30,000 have been published in\r\nthe collection referred to; passages in 20,000 of the others have been\r\nstricken out on account of previous publication, and about 30,000 more,\r\nthrough considerations of propriety or policy.

Intense Passions.\r\n\r\n     Personality and character during the Italian Renaissance and\r\n     during the present time.--Intensity of the passions in\r\n     Bonaparte.--His excessive touchiness.--His immediate\r\n     violence.--His impatience, rapidity, and need of talking.\r\n     --His temperament, tension, and faults.\r\n\r\nOn taking a near view of the contemporaries of Dante and Michael\r\nAngelo, we find that they differ from us more in character than in\r\nintellect.[1201] With us, three hundred years of police and of courts\r\nof justice, of social discipline and peaceful habits, of hereditary\r\ncivilization, have diminished the force and violence of the passions\r\nnatural to Man. In Italy, in the Renaissance epoch, they were still\r\nintact; human emotions at that time were keener and more profound than\r\nat the present day; the appetites were ardent and more unbridled; man's\r\nwill was more impetuous and more tenacious; whatever motive inspired,\r\nwhether pride, ambition, jealousy, hatred, love, envy, or sensuality,\r\nthe inward spring strained with an energy and relaxed with a violence\r\nthat has now disappeared. All these energies reappear in this great\r\nsurvivor of the fifteenth century; in him the play of the nervous\r\nmachine is the same as with his Italian ancestors; never was there, even\r\nwith the Malatestas and the Borgias, a more sensitive and more impulsive\r\nintellect, one capable of such electric shocks and explosions, in which\r\nthe roar and flashes of tempest lasted longer and of which the effects\r\nwere more irresistible. In his mind no idea remains speculative and\r\npure; none is a simple transcript of the real, or a simple picture\r\nof the possible; each is an internal eruption, which suddenly and\r\nspontaneously spends itself in action; each darts forth to its goal and\r\nwould reach it without stopping were it not kept back and restrained\r\nby force[1202] Sometimes, the eruption is so sudden, that the restraint\r\ndoes not come soon enough. One day, in Egypt,[1203] on entertaining\r\na number of French ladies at dinner, he has one of them, who was\r\nvery pretty and whose husband he had just sent off to France, placed\r\nalongside of him; suddenly, as if accidentally, he overturns a pitcher\r\nof water on her, and, under the pretence of enabling her to rearrange\r\nher wet dress, he leads her into another room where he remains with her\r\na long time, too long, while the other guests seated at the table wait\r\nquietly and exchange glances. Another day, at Paris, toward the epoch\r\nof the Concordat,[1204] he says to Senator Volney: \"France wants a\r\nreligion.\" Volney replies in a frank, sententious way, \"France wants the\r\nBourbons.\" Whereupon he gives Volney a kick in the stomach and he falls\r\nunconscious; on being moved to a friend's house, he remains there ill in\r\nbed for several days.--No man is more irritable, so soon in a passion;\r\nand all the more because he purposely gives way to his irritation; for,\r\ndoing this just at the right moment, and especially before witnesses,\r\nit strikes terror; it enables him to extort concessions and maintain\r\nobedience. His explosions of anger, half-calculated, half-involuntary,\r\nserve him quite as much as they relieve him, in public as well as in\r\nprivate, with strangers as with intimates, before constituted bodies,\r\nwith the Pope, with cardinals, with ambassadors, with Talleyrand, with\r\nBeugnot, with anybody that comes along,[1205] whenever he wishes to set\r\nan example or \"keep the people around him on the alert.\" The public and\r\nthe army regard him as impassible; but, apart from the battles in which\r\nhe wears a mask of bronze, apart from the official ceremonies in which\r\nhe assumes a necessarily dignified air, impression and expression with\r\nhim are almost always confounded, the inward overflowing in the outward,\r\nthe action, like a blow, getting the better of him. At Saint Cloud,\r\ncaught by Josephine in the arms of another woman, he runs after\r\nthe unlucky interrupter in such a way that \"she barely has time to\r\nescape\";[1206] and again, that evening, keeping up his fury so as to\r\nput her down completely, \"he treats her in the most outrageous manner,\r\nsmashing every piece of furniture that comes in his way.\" A little\r\nbefore the Empire, Talleyrand, a great mystifier, tells Berthier that\r\nthe First Consul wanted to assume the title of king. Berthier, in eager\r\nhaste, crosses the drawing-room full of company, accosts the master of\r\nthe house and, with a beaming smile, \"congratulates him.\"[1207] At the\r\nword king, Bonaparte's eyes flash. Grasping Berthier by the throat, he\r\npushes him back against the wall, exclaiming, \"You fool! who told you\r\nto come here and stir up my bile in this way? Another time don't come\r\non such errands.\"--Such is the first impulse, the instinctive action,\r\nto pounce on people and seize them by the throat; we divine under each\r\nsentence, and on every page he writes, out-bursts and assaults of this\r\ndescription, the physiognomy and intonation of a man who rushes forward\r\nand knocks people down. Accordingly, when dictating in his cabinet, \"he\r\nstrides up and down the room,\" and, \"if excited,\" which is often the\r\ncase, \"his language consists of violent imprecations, and even of oaths,\r\nwhich are suppressed in what is written.\"[1208] But these are not\r\nalways suppressed, for those who have seen the original minutes of his\r\ncorrespondence on ecclesiastical affairs find dozens of them, the b...,\r\nthe p... and the swearwords of the coarsest kind.[1209]\r\n\r\nNever was there such impatient touchiness. \"When dressing himself,[1210]\r\nhe throws on the floor or into the fire any part of his attire which\r\ndoes not suit him.... On gala-days and on grand ceremonial occasions\r\nhis valets are obliged to agree together when they shall seize the\r\nright moment to put some thing on him... He tears off or breaks whatever\r\ncauses him the slightest discomfort, while the poor valet who has been\r\nthe means of it meets with a violent and positive proof of his anger. No\r\nthought was ever more carried away by its own speed. \"His handwriting,\r\nwhen he tries to write, \"is a mass of disconnected and undecipherable\r\nsigns;[1211] the words lack one-half of their letters.\" On reading it\r\nover himself, he cannot tell what it means. At last, he becomes almost\r\nincapable of producing a handwritten letter, while his signature is a\r\nmere scrawl. He accordingly dictates, but so fast that his secretaries\r\ncan scarcely keep pace with him: on their first attempt the perspiration\r\nflows freely and they succeed in noting down only the half of what he\r\nsays. Bourrienne, de Meneval, and Maret invent a stenography of their\r\nown, for he never repeats any of his phrases; so much the worse for\r\nthe pen if it lags behind, and so much the better if a volley of\r\nexclamations or of oaths gives it a chance to catch up.--Never did\r\nspeech flow and overflow in such torrents, often without either\r\ndiscretion or prudence, even when the outburst is neither useful nor\r\ncreditable the reason is that both spirit and intellect are charged to\r\nexcess subject to this inward pressure the improvisator and polemic,\r\nunder full headway,[1212] take the place of the man of business and the\r\nstatesman.\r\n\r\n\"With him,\" says a good observer,[1213] \"talking is a prime necessity,\r\nand, assuredly, among the prerogatives of high rank, he ranks first that\r\nof speaking without interruption.\"\r\n\r\nEven at the Council of State he allows himself to run on, forgetting the\r\nbusiness on hand; he starts off right and left with some digression\r\nor demonstration, some invective or other, for two or three hours at\r\na stretch,[1214] insisting over and over again, bent on convincing or\r\nprevailing, and ending in demanding of the others if he is not right,\r\n\"and, in this case, never failing to find that all have yielded to the\r\nforce of his arguments.\" On reflection, he knows the value of an assent\r\nthus obtained, and, pointing to his chair, he observes:\r\n\r\n\"It must be admitted that it is easy to be brilliant when one is in that\r\nseat!\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless he has enjoyed his intellectual exercise and given way to\r\nhis passion, which controls him far more than he controls it.\r\n\r\n\"My nerves are very irritable,\" he said of himself, \"and when in this\r\nstate were my pulse not always regular I should risk going crazy.\"[1215]\r\n\r\nThe tension of accumulated impressions is often too great, and it ends\r\nin a physical break-down. Strangely enough in so great a warrior and\r\nwith such a statesman, \"it is not infrequent, when excited, to see him\r\nshed tears.\" He who has looked upon thousands of dying men, and who\r\nhas had thousands of men slaughtered, \"sobs,\" after Wagram and after\r\nBautzen,[1216] at the couch of a dying comrade. \"I saw him,\" says his\r\nvalet, \"weep while eating his breakfast, after coming from Marshal\r\nLannes's bedside; big tears rolled down his cheeks and fell on his\r\nplate.\" It is not alone the physical sensation, the sight of a bleeding,\r\nmangled body, which thus moves him acutely and deeply; for a word, a\r\nsimple idea, stings and penetrates almost as far. Before the emotion of\r\nDandolo, who pleads for Venice his country, which is sold to Austria, he\r\nis agitated and his eyes moisten.[1217] Speaking of the capitulation\r\nof Baylen, at a full meeting of the Council of State,[1218] his voice\r\ntrembles, and \"he gives way to his grief, his eyes even filling with\r\ntears.\" In 1806, setting out for the army and on taking leave of\r\nJosephine, he has a nervous attack which is so severe as to bring on\r\nvomiting.[1219] \"We had to make him sit down,\" says an eye-witness, \"and\r\nswallow some orange water; he shed tears, and this lasted a quarter\r\nof an hour.\" The same nervous and stomachic crisis came on in 1808, on\r\ndeciding on the divorce; he tosses about a whole night, and laments like\r\na woman; he melts, and embraces Josephine; he is weaker than she is:\r\n\"My poor Josephine, I can never leave you!\" Folding her in his arms, he\r\ndeclares that she shall not quit him; he abandons himself wholly to the\r\nsensation of the moment; she must undress at once, sleep alongside of\r\nhim, and he weeps over her; \"literally,\" she says, \"he soaked the bed\r\nwith his tears.\"--Evidently, in such an organism, however powerful\r\nthe superimposed regulator, there is a risk of the equilibrium being\r\ndestroyed. He is aware of this, for he knows himself well; he is afraid\r\nof his own nervous sensibility, the same as of an easily frightened\r\nhorse; at critical moments, at Berezina, he refuses to receive the bad\r\nnews which might excite this, and, on the informer's insisting on it,\r\nhe asks him again,[1220] \"Why, sir, do you want to disturb\r\nme?\"--Nevertheless, in spite of his precautions, he is twice taken\r\nunawares, at times when the peril was alarming and of a new kind; he, so\r\nclear headed and so cool under fire, the boldest of military heroes\r\nand the most audacious of political adventurers, quails twice in a\r\nparliamentary storm and again in a popular crisis. On the 18th of\r\nBrumaire, in the Corps Législatif, \"he turned pale, trembled, and seemed\r\nto lose his head at the shouts of outlawry.... they had to drag\r\nhim out.... they even thought for a moment that he was going to\r\nfaint.\"[1221] After the abdication at Fontainebleau, on encountering the\r\nrage and imprecations which greeted him in Provence, he seemed for\r\nsome days to be morally shattered; the animal instincts assert their\r\nsupremacy; he is afraid and makes no attempt at concealment.[1222] After\r\nborrowing the uniform of an Austrian colonel, the helmet of a Prussian\r\nquartermaster, and the cloak of the Russian quartermaster, he still\r\nconsiders that he is not sufficiently disguised. In the inn at Calade,\r\n\"he starts and changes color at the slightest noise\"; the commissaries,\r\nwho repeatedly enter his room, \"find him always in tears.\" \"He wearies\r\nthem with his anxieties and irresolution\"; he says that the French\r\ngovernment would like to have him assassinated on the road, refuses to\r\neat for fear of poison, and thinks that he might escape by jumping out\r\nof the window. And yet he gives vent to his feelings and lets his\r\ntongue run on about himself without stopping, concerning his past, his\r\ncharacter, unreservedly, indelicately, trivially; like a cynic and one\r\nwho is half-crazy; his ideas run loose and crowd each other like the\r\nanarchical gatherings of a tumultuous mob; he does not recover his\r\nmastery of them until he reaches Fréjus, the end of his journey, where\r\nhe feels himself safe and protected from any highway assault; then only\r\ndo they return within ordinary limits and fall back in regular line\r\nunder the control of the sovereign intellect which, after sinking for\r\na time, revives and resumes its ascendancy.--There is nothing in him\r\nso extraordinary as this almost perpetual domination of the lucid,\r\ncalculating reason; his willpower is still more formidable than his\r\nintelligence; before it can obtain the mastery of others it must be\r\nmaster at home. To measure its power, it does not suffice to note its\r\nfascinations; to enumerate the millions of souls it captivates, to\r\nestimate the vastness of the obstacles it overcomes: we must again, and\r\nespecially, represent to ourselves the energy and depth of the passions\r\nit keeps in check and urges on like a team of prancing, rearing\r\nhorses--it is the driver who, bracing his arms, constantly restrains the\r\nalmost ungovernable steeds, who controls their excitement, who regulates\r\ntheir bounds, who takes advantage even of their viciousness to guide his\r\nnoisy vehicle over precipices as it rushes on with thundering speed.\r\nIf the pure ideas of the reasoning brain thus maintain their daily\r\nsupremacy it is due to the vital flow which nourishes them; their roots\r\nare deep in his heart and temperament, and those roots which give them\r\ntheir vigorous sap constitute a primordial instinct more powerful than\r\nintellect, more powerful even than his will, the instinct which leads\r\nhim to center everything on himself, in other words egoism.[1223]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Will and Egoism.\r\n\r\n     Bonaparte's dominant passion.--His lucid, calculating mind.\r\n     --Source and power of the Will.--Early evidences of an\r\n     active, absorbing egoism.--His education derived from the\r\n     lessons of things.--In Corsica.--In France during the\r\n     Revolution.--In Italy.--In Egypt.--His idea of Society and\r\n     of Right.--Maturing after the 18th of Brumaire.--His idea of\r\n     Man.--It conforms to his character\r\n\r\nIt is egoism, not a passive, but an active and intrusive egoism,\r\nproportional to the energy and extension of his faculties developed\r\nby his education and circumstances, exaggerated by his success and\r\nhis omnipotence to such a degree that a monstrous colossal I has been\r\nerected in society. It expands unceasingly the circle of a tenacious and\r\nrapacious grasp, which regards all resistance as offensive, which all\r\nindependence annoys, and which, on the boundless domain it assigns to\r\nitself, is intolerant of anybody that does not become either an appendix\r\nor a tool.--The germ of this absorbing personality is already apparent\r\nin the youth and even in the infant.\r\n\r\n\"Character: dominating, imperious, and stubborn,\"\r\n\r\nsays the record at Brienne.[1224] And the notes of the Military Academy\r\nadd;[1225]\r\n\r\n\"Extremely inclined to egoism,\"--\"proud, ambitious, aspiring in all\r\ndirections, fond of solitude,\"\r\n\r\nundoubtedly because he is not master in a group of equals and is ill at\r\nease when he cannot rule.\r\n\r\n\"I lived apart from my comrades,\" he says at a later date.[1226]--\"I had\r\nselected a little corner in the playgrounds, where I used to go and sit\r\ndown and indulge my fancies. When my comrades were disposed to drive me\r\nout of this corner I defended it with all my might. My instinct already\r\ntold me that my will should prevail against other wills, and that\r\nwhatever pleased me ought to belong to me.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to his early years under the paternal roof at Corsica, he\r\ndepicts himself as a little mischievous savage, rebelling against\r\nevery sort of restraint, and without any conscience.[1227] \"I respected\r\nnothing and feared nobody; I beat one and scratched another; I made\r\neverybody afraid of me. I beat my brother Joseph; I bit him and\r\ncomplained of him almost before he knew what he was about.\" A clever\r\ntrick, and one which he was not slow to repeat. His talent for\r\nimprovising useful falsehoods is innate; later on, at maturity, he\r\nis proud of this; he makes it the index and measure of \"political\r\nsuperiority,\" and \"delights in calling to mind one of his uncles who,\r\nin his infancy, prognosticated to him that he would govern the world\r\nbecause he was fond of lying.\"[1228]\r\n\r\nRemark this observation of the uncles--it sums up the experiences of a\r\nman of his time and of his country; it is what social life in Corsica\r\ninculcated; morals and manners there adapted themselves to each other\r\nthrough an unfailing connection. The moral law, indeed, is such because\r\nsimilar customs prevail in all countries and at all times where the\r\npolice is powerless, where justice cannot be obtained, where public\r\ninterests are in the hands of whoever can lay hold of them, where\r\nprivate warfare is pitiless and not repressed, where every man goes\r\narmed, where every sort of weapon is fair, and where dissimulation,\r\nfraud, and trickery, as well as gun or poniard, are allowed, which\r\nwas the case in Corsica in the eighteenth century, as in Italy in the\r\nfifteenth century.--Hence the early impressions of Bonaparte similar to\r\nthose of the Borgias and of Macchiavelli; hence, in his case, that first\r\nstratum of half-thought which, later on, serves as the basis of complete\r\nthought; hence, the whole foundation of his future mental edifice and of\r\nthe conceptions he subsequently entertains of human society. Afterwards,\r\non leaving the French schools and every time he returns to them and\r\nspends any time in them, the same impressions, often renewed, intensify\r\nin his mind the same final conclusion. In this country, report the\r\nFrench commissioners,[1229] \"the people have no idea of principle in the\r\nabstract,\" nor of social interest or justice. \"Justice does not exist;\r\none hundred and thirty assassinations have occurred in ten years....\r\nThe institution of juries has deprived the country of all the means for\r\npunishing crime; never do the strongest proofs, the clearest evidence,\r\nlead a jury composed of men of the same party, or of the same family\r\nas the accused, to convict him; and, if the accused is of the opposite\r\nparty, the juries likewise acquit him, so as not to incur the risk of\r\nrevenge, slow perhaps but always sure.\"--\"Public spirit is unknown.\"\r\nThere is no social body, except any number of small parties hostile to\r\neach other.... One is not a Corsican without belonging to some family,\r\nand consequently attached to some party; he who would serve none, would\r\nbe detested by all.... All the leaders have the same end in view, that\r\nof getting money no matter by what means, and their first care is to\r\nsurround themselves with creatures entirely devoted to them and to whom\r\nthey give all the offices.... The elections are held under arms, and\r\nall with violence.... The victorious party uses its authority to avenge\r\nitself on their opponents, and multiplies vexations and outrages... .\r\nThe leaders form aristocratic leagues with each other.... and mutually\r\ntolerate abuses. They impose no assessment or collection (of taxes) to\r\ncurry favor with electors through party spirit and relationships....\r\nCustoms-duties serve simply to compensate friends and relatives....\r\nSalaries never reach those for whom they are intended. The rural\r\ndistricts are uninhabitable for lack of security. The peasants carry\r\nguns even when at the plow. One cannot take a step without an escort; a\r\ndetachment of five or six men is often sent to carry a letter from one\r\npost-office to another.\"\r\n\r\nInterpret this general statement by the thousands of facts of which it\r\nis the summary; imagine these little daily occurrences narrated with all\r\ntheir material accompaniments, and with sympathetic or angry comments\r\nby interested neighbors, and we have the moral lessons taught to young\r\nBonaparte.[1230] At table, the child has listened to the conversation of\r\nhis elders, and at a word uttered, for instance, by his uncle, or at\r\na physiognomic expression, a sign of approbation, a shrug of the\r\nshoulders, he has divined that the ordinary march of society is not that\r\nof peace but of war; he sees by what ruses one maintains one's-self,\r\nby what acts of violence one makes ones way, by what sort of help one\r\nmounts upward. Left to himself the rest of the day, to the nurse Ilaria,\r\nor to Saveria the housekeeper, or to the common people amongst whom\r\nhe strays at will, he listens to the conversation of sailors or of\r\nshepherds assembled on the public square, and their simple exclamations,\r\ntheir frank admiration of well-planned ambuscades and lucky surprises,\r\nimpress more profoundly on him, often repeated with so much energy,\r\nthe lessons which he has already learned at home. These are the lessons\r\ntaught by things. At this tender age they sink deep, especially when\r\nthe disposition is favorable, and in this case the heart sanctions\r\nthem beforehand, because education finds its confederate in instinct.\r\nAccordingly, at the outbreak of the Revolution, on revisiting Corsica,\r\nhe takes life at once as he finds it there, a combat with any sort of\r\nweapon, and, on this small arena, he acts unscrupulously, going farther\r\nthan anybody.[1231] If he respects justice and law, it is only in\r\nwords, and even here ironically; in his eyes, law is a term of the code,\r\njustice a book term, while might makes right.\r\n\r\nA second blow of the coining-press gives another impression of the same\r\nstamp on this character already so decided, while French anarchy forces\r\nmaxims into the mind of the young man, already traced in the child's\r\nmind by Corsican anarchy; the lessons of things provided by a society\r\ngoing to pieces are the same as those of a society which is not yet\r\nformed.--His sharp eyes, at a very early period, see through the\r\nflourish of theory and the parade of phrases; they detect the real\r\nfoundation of the Revolution, namely, the sovereignty of unbridled\r\npassions and the conquest of the majority by the minority; conquering or\r\nconquered, a choice must be made between these two extreme conditions;\r\nthere is no middle course. After the 9th of Thermidor, the last\r\nveils are torn away, and the instincts of license and domination, the\r\nambitions of individuals, fully display themselves. There is no concern\r\nfor public interests or for the rights of the people; it is clear that\r\nthe rulers form a band, that France is their prey, and that they intend\r\nto hold on to it for and against everybody, by every possible means,\r\nincluding bayonets. Under this civil régime, a clean sweep of the broom\r\nat the center makes it necessary to be on the side of numbers.--In the\r\narmies, especially in the army of Italy, republican faith and patriotic\r\nabnegation, since the territory became free, have given way to natural\r\nappetites and military passions.[1232] Barefoot, in rags, with four\r\nounces of bread a day, paid in assignats which are not accepted in the\r\nmarkets, both officers and men desire above all things to be relieved\r\nof their misery; \"the poor fellows, after three years of longing on\r\nthe summits of the Alps, reach the promised land, and want to enjoy\r\nit.\"[1233] Another spur consists in the pride which is stimulated by\r\nthe imagination and by success; add to this the necessity for finding\r\nan outlet for their energy, the steam and high pressure of youth; nearly\r\nall are very young men, who regard life, in Gallic or French fashion, as\r\na party of pleasure and as a duel. But to feel brave and to prove that\r\none is so, to face bullets for amusement and defiantly, to abandon a\r\nsuccessful adventure for a battle and a battle for a ball, to enjoy\r\nones-self and take risks to excess, without dissimulating, and with\r\nno other object than the sensation of the moment,[1234] to revel in\r\nexcitement through emulation and danger, is no longer self-devotion,\r\nbut giving one's-self up to one's fancies; and, for all who are not\r\nharebrained, to give one's-self up to one's fancies means to make one's\r\nway, obtain promotion, pillage so as to become rich, like Massena,\r\nand conquer so as to become powerful, like Bonaparte.--All this is\r\nunderstood between the general and his army from the very first,[1235]\r\nand, after one year's experience, the understanding is perfect. One\r\nmoral is derived from their common acts, vague in the army, precise in\r\nthe general; what the army only half sees, he sees clearly; if he urges\r\nhis comrades on, it is because they follow their own inclination. He\r\nsimply has a start on them, and is quicker to make up his mind that the\r\nworld is a grand banquet, free to the first-comer, but at which, to be\r\nwell served, one must have long arms, be the first to get helped, and\r\nlet the rest take what is left.\r\n\r\nSo natural does this seem to him, he says so openly and to men who are\r\nnot his intimates; to Miot, a diplomat, and to Melzi a foreigner:\r\n\r\n\"Do you suppose, says he to them,[1236] after the preliminaries of\r\nLeoben, \"that to make great men out of Directory lawyers, the Carnots'\r\nand the Barras, I triumph in Italy? Do you suppose also that it is for\r\nthe establishment of a republic? What an idea! A republic of thirty\r\nmillion men! With our customs, our vices, how is that possible? It is\r\na delusion which the French are infatuated with and which will vanish\r\nalong with so many others. What they want is glory, the gratification of\r\nvanity--they know nothing about liberty. Look at the army! Our successes\r\njust obtained, our triumphs have already brought out the true character\r\nof the French soldier. I am all for him. Let the Directory deprive me of\r\nthe command and it will see if it is master. The nation needs a chief,\r\none who is famous though his exploits, and not theories of government,\r\nphrases and speeches by ideologists, which Frenchmen do not\r\ncomprehend.... As to your country, Monsieur de Melzi, it has still\r\nfewer elements of republicanism than France, and much less ceremony is\r\nessential with it than with any other... In other respects, I have\r\nno idea of coming to terms so promptly with Austria. It is not for my\r\ninterest to make peace. You see what I am, what I can do in Italy. If\r\npeace is brought about, if I am no longer at the head of this army which\r\nhas become attached to me, I must give up this power, this high position\r\nI have reached, and go and pay court to lawyers in the Luxembourg. I\r\nshould not like to quit Italy for France except to play a part there\r\nsimilar to that which I play here, and the time for that has not yet\r\ncome--the pear is not ripe.\"\r\n\r\nTo wait until the pear is ripe, but not to allow anybody else to gather\r\nit, is the true motive of his political fealty and of his Jacobin\r\nproclamations: \"A party in favor of the Bourbons is raising its head;\r\nI have no desire to help it along. One of these days I shall weaken the\r\nrepublican party, but I shall do it for my own advantage and not for\r\nthat of the old dynasty. Meanwhile, it is necessary to march with the\r\nRepublicans,\" along with the worst, and' the scoundrels about to purge\r\nthe Five Hundred, the Ancients, and the Directory itself, and then\r\nre-establish in France the Reign of Terror.--In effect, he contributes\r\nto the 18th of Fructidor, and, the blow struck, he explains very clearly\r\nwhy he took part in it:\r\n\r\n\"Do not believe[1237] I did it in conformity with the ideas entertained\r\nby those with whom I acted. I did--not want a return of the Bourbons,\r\nand especially if brought back by Moreau's army and by Pichegru...\r\nFinally, I will not take the part of Monk, I will not play it, and I\r\nwill not have others play it.... As for myself, my dear Miot, I declare\r\nto you that I can no longer obey; I have tasted command and I cannot\r\ngive it up. My mind is made up. If I cannot be master I will leave\r\nFrance.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no middle course for him between the two alter natives. On\r\nreturning to Paris he thinks of \"overthrowing the Directory,[1238]\r\ndissolving the councils and of making himself dictator\"; but, having\r\nsatisfied himself that there was but little chance of succeeding, \"he\r\npostpones his design\" and falls back on the second course. \"This is the\r\nonly motive of his expedition into Egypt.\"[1239]--That, in the actual\r\ncondition of France and of Europe, the expedition is opposed to public\r\ninterests, that France deprives itself of its best army and offers\r\nits best fleet to almost certain destruction, is of little consequence\r\nprovided, in this vast and gratuitous adventure, Bonaparte finds the\r\nemployment he wants, a large field of action and famous victories which,\r\nlike the blasts of a trumpet, will swell beyond the seas and renew his\r\nprestige: in his eyes, the fleet, the army, France, and humanity exist\r\nonly for him and are created only for his service.--If, in confirmation\r\nof this persuasion, another lesson in things is still necessary, it will\r\nbe furnished by Egypt. Here, absolute sovereign, free of any restraint,\r\ncontending with an inferior order of humanity, he acts the sultan and\r\naccustoms himself to playing the part.[1240] His last scruples towards\r\nthe human species disappear; \"I became disgusted with Rousseau\"; he\r\nis to say, later on, \"After seeing the Orient: the savage man is a\r\ndog,\"[1241] and, in the civilized man, the savage is just beneath the\r\nskin; if the intellect has become somewhat polished, there is no change\r\nin his instincts. A master is as necessary to one as to the other--a\r\nmagician who subjugates his imagination, disciplines him, keeps him from\r\nbiting without occasion, ties him up, cares for him, and takes him out\r\nhunting. He is born to obey, does not deserve any better lot, and has no\r\nother right.\r\n\r\nBecome consul and afterward emperor, he applies the theory on a grand\r\nscale, and, in his hands, experience daily furnishes fresh verifications\r\nof the theory. At his first nod the French prostrate themselves\r\nobediently, and there remain, as in a natural position; the lower class,\r\nthe peasants and the soldiers, with animal fidelity, and the\r\nupper class, the dignitaries and the functionaries, with Byzantine\r\nservility.--The republicans, on their side, make no resistance; on\r\nthe contrary, among these he has found his best governing\r\ninstruments--senators, deputies, state councilors, judges, and\r\nadministrators of every grade.[1242] He has at once detected behind\r\ntheir sermonizing on liberty and equality, their despotic instincts,\r\ntheir craving for command, for leadership, even as subordinates; and,\r\nin addition to this, with most of them, the appetite for money or for\r\nsensual pleasures. The difference between the delegate of the Committee\r\nof Public Safety and the minister, prefect, or subprefect under the\r\nEmpire is small; it is the same person in two costumes: at first in the\r\ncarmagnole, and later in the embroidered coat. If a rude, poor puritan,\r\nlike Cambon or Baudot, refuses to don the official uniform, if two\r\nor three Jacobin generals, like Lecourbe and Delmas, grumble at the\r\ncoronation parade, Napoleon, who knows their mental grasp, regards them\r\nas ignoramuses, limited to and rigid inside a fixed idea.--As to the\r\ncultivated and intelligent liberals of 1789, he consigns them with a\r\nword to the place where they belong; they are \"ideologists\"; in other\r\nwords, their pretended knowledge is mere drawing-room prejudice and the\r\nimagination of the study. \"Lafayette is a political ninny,\" the eternal\r\n\"dupe of men and of things.\"[1243] With Lafayette and some others, one\r\nembarrassing detail remains namely:\r\n\r\n* impartiality and generosity,\r\n\r\n* constant care for the common good,\r\n\r\n* respect for others,\r\n\r\n* the authority of conscience,\r\n\r\n* loyalty,\r\n\r\n* and good faith.\r\n\r\nIn short, noble and pure motives.\r\n\r\nNapoleon does not accept the denial thus given to his theory; when\r\nhe talks with people, he questions their moral nobleness. \"General\r\nDumas,\"[1244] said he, abruptly, to Mathieu Dumas, \"you were one of the\r\nimbeciles who believed in liberty?\" \"Yes, sire, and I was and am still\r\none of that class.\" \"And you, like the rest, took part in the Revolution\r\nthrough ambition?\" \"No, sire, I should have calculated badly, for I am\r\nnow precisely where I stood in 1790.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were not sufficiently aware of the motives which prompted you; you\r\ncannot be different from other people; it is all personal interest. Now,\r\ntake Massena. He has glory and honors enough; but he is not content.\r\nHe wants to be a prince, like Murat and like Bernadotte. He would\r\nrisk being shot to-morrow to be a prince. That is the incentive of\r\nFrenchmen.\"--\r\n\r\nHis system is based on this. The most competent witnesses, and those who\r\nwere most familiar with him certify to his fixed idea on this point.\r\n\r\n\"His opinions on men,\" writes M. de Metternich,[1245] \"centered on one\r\nidea, which, unfortunately for him, had acquired in his mind the force\r\nof an axiom; he was persuaded that no man who was induced to appear on\r\nthe public stage, or who was merely engaged in the active pursuits\r\nof life, governed himself, or was governed, otherwise than by his\r\ninterest.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to him, Man is held through his egoistic passions, fear,\r\ncupidity, sensuality, self-esteem, and emulation; these are the\r\nmainsprings when he is not under excitement, when he reasons. Moreover,\r\nit is not difficult to turn the brain of man; for he is imaginative,\r\ncredulous, and subject to being carried away; stimulate his pride or\r\nvanity, provide him with an extreme and false opinion of himself and\r\nof his fellow-men, and you can start him off head downward wherever you\r\nplease.[1246]--None of these motives is entitled to much respect,\r\nand beings thus fashioned form the natural material for an absolute\r\ngovernment, the mass of clay awaiting the potter's hand to shape it. If\r\nparts of this mass are obdurate, the potter has only to crush and pound\r\nthem and mix them thoroughly.\r\n\r\nSuch is the final conception on which Napoleon has anchored himself,\r\nand into which he sinks deeper and deeper, no matter how directly\r\nand violently he may be contradicted by palpable facts. Nothing will\r\ndislodge him; neither the stubborn energy of the English, nor the\r\ninflexible gentleness of the Pope, nor the declared insurrection of the\r\nSpaniards, nor the mute insurrection of the Germans, nor the resistance\r\nof Catholic consciences, nor the gradual disaffection of the French; the\r\nreason is, that his conception is imposed on him by his character;[1247]\r\nhe sees man as he needs to see him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Napoleon's Dominant Passion: Power.\r\n\r\n     His mastery of the will of others.--Degree of submission\r\n     required by him.--His mode of appreciating others and of\r\n     profiting by them.--Tone of command and of conversation.\r\n\r\nWe at last confront his dominant passion, the inward abyss into which\r\ninstinct, education, reflection, and theory have plunged him, and which\r\nis to engulf the proud edifice of his fortune--I mean, his ambition. It\r\nis the prime motor of his soul and the permanent substance of his will,\r\nso profound that he no longer distinguishes between it and himself, and\r\nof which he is sometimes unconscious.\r\n\r\n\"I,\" said he to Roederer,[1248] \"I have no ambition,\" and then,\r\nrecollecting himself, he adds, with his ordinary lucidity, \"or, if I\r\nhave any, it is so natural to me, so innate, so intimately associated\r\nwith my existence, that it is like the blood which flows in my veins and\r\nthe atmosphere I breathe.\"--\r\n\r\nStill more profoundly, he likens it to that unconscious, savage, and\r\nirresistible emotion which vibrates the soul from one end to the other,\r\nto this universal thrill moving all living beings, animal or moral, to\r\nthose keen and terrible tremors which we call the passion of love.\r\n\r\n\"I have but one passion,[1249] one mistress, and that is France. I sleep\r\nwith her. She has never been false to me. She lavishes her blood and\r\ntreasures on me. If I need 500,000 men, she gives them to me.\"\r\n\r\nLet no one come between him and her. Let Joseph, in relation to\r\nthe coronation, abstain from claiming his place, even secondary and\r\nprospective, in the new empire; let him not put forth his fraternal\r\nrights.[1250] \"It is to wound me in the most tender spot.\" This he does,\r\nand, \"Nothing can efface that from my souvenirs. It is as if he had told\r\nan impassioned lover that he had slept with his mistress, or merely that\r\nhe hoped to succeed with her. My mistress is power. I have worked too\r\nhard to obtain her, to let her be ravished from me, or even suffer\r\nanybody to covet her.\" This ambition, as avid as it is jealous, which\r\nbecomes exasperated at the very idea of a rival, feels hampered by the\r\nmere idea of setting a limit to it; however vast the acquired power,\r\nhe would like to have it still more vast; on quitting the most copious\r\nbanquet, he still remains insatiate. On the day after the coronation he\r\nsaid to Decrés:[1251]\r\n\r\n\"I come too late, there is no longer anything great to accomplish.\r\nI admit that my career is brilliant and that I have made my way\r\nsuccessfully. But what a difference alongside of antiquity! Take\r\nAlexander! After having conquered Asia, and proclaimed himself to the\r\npeople as the son of Jupiter, with the exception of Olympias, who knew\r\nwhat all this meant, and Aristotle, and a few Athenian pedants, the\r\nentire Orient believed him. Very well, should I now declare that I was\r\nthe son of God Almighty, and proclaim that I am going to worship him\r\nunder this title, every market woman would hoot at me as I walked along\r\nthe streets. People nowadays know too much. Nothing is left to do.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet, even on this secluded, elevated domain, and which twenty\r\ncenturies of civilization keeps inaccessible, he still encroaches, and\r\nto the utmost, in a roundabout way, by laying his hand on the Church,\r\nand next on the Pope; here, as elsewhere, he takes all he can get.\r\nNothing in his eyes, is more natural; he has a right to it, because he\r\nis the only capable one.\r\n\r\n\"My Italian people[1252] must know me well enough not to forget\r\nthat there is more in my little finger than in all their brains put\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\nAlongside of him, they are children, \"minors,\" the French also, and\r\nlikewise the rest of mankind. A diplomat, who often saw him and studied\r\nhim under all as aspects, sums up his character in one conclusive\r\nphrase:\r\n\r\n\"He considered himself an isolated being in this world, made to govern\r\nand direct all minds as he pleased.\"[1253]\r\n\r\nHence, whoever has anything to do with him, must abandon his\r\nindependence and become his tool of government.\r\n\r\n\"That terrible man,\" often exclaimed Decrés[1254] \"has subjugated us\r\nall! He holds all our imaginations in his hands, now of steel and now\r\nof velvet, but whether one or the other during the day nobody knows, and\r\nthere is no way to escape from them whatever they seize on they never\r\nlet go!\"\r\n\r\nIndependence of any kind, even eventual and merely possible, puts him in\r\na bad mood; intellectual or moral superiority is of this order, and he\r\ngradually gets rid of it;[1255] toward the end he no longer tolerates\r\nalongside of him any but subject or captive spirits. His principal\r\nservants are machines or fanatics, a devout worshipper, like Maret, a\r\ngendarme, like Savary,[1256] ready to do his bidding. From the outset,\r\nhe has reduced his ministers to the condition of clerks; for he is\r\nadministrator as well as ruler, and in each department he watches\r\ndetails as closely as the entire mass. Accordingly, he requires simply\r\nfor head of departments active pen pushers, mute executors, docile and\r\nspecial hands, no need for honest and independent advisers.\r\n\r\n\"I should not know what to do with them,\" he said, \"if they were not to\r\na certain extent mediocre in mind and character.\"\r\n\r\nAs to his generals, he admits himself that \"he likes to award fame only\r\nto those who cannot stand it.\" In any event, \"he must be sole master in\r\nmaking or unmaking reputations,\" according to his personal requirements.\r\nToo brilliant a soldier would become too important; a subordinate should\r\nnever be tempted to be less submissive. To this end he studies what he\r\nwill omit in his bulletins, what alterations and what changes shall be\r\nmade in them.\r\n\r\n\"It is convenient to keep silent about certain victories, or to convert\r\nthe defeat of this or that marshal into a success. Sometimes a general\r\nlearns by a bulletin of an action that he was never in and of a speech\r\nthat he never made.\"\r\n\r\nIf he complains, he is notified to keep still, or by way of recompense\r\nhe is allowed to pillage, levy contributions, and enrich himself. On\r\nbecoming duke or hereditary prince, with half a million or a million\r\nof revenue from his estate, he is not less held in subjection, for the\r\ncreator has taken precautions against his own creations.\r\n\r\n\"There are men,\"[1257] he said, \"who I have made independent, but I know\r\nwell where to find them and keep them from being ungrateful.\"\r\n\r\nIn effect, if he has endowed them magnificently it is with domains\r\nassigned to them in conquered countries, which insures their fortune\r\nbeing his fortune. Besides, in order that they may not enjoy any\r\npecuniary stability, he expressly encourages them and all his grand\r\ndignitaries to make extravagant outlays; thus, through their financial\r\nembarrassments be holds them in a leash. \"We have seen most of his\r\nmarshals, constantly pressed by their creditors, come to him for\r\nassistance, which he has given as he fancied, or as he found it for his\r\ninterest to attach some one to him.\"[1258]\r\n\r\nThus, beyond the universal ascendancy which his power and genius have\r\nconferred on him, he craves a personal, supplementary, and irresistible\r\nhold on everybody. Consequently,[1259] \"he carefully cultivates all the\r\nbad passions.... he is glad to find the bad side in a man, so as to get\r\nhim in his power\"; the thirst for money in Savary, the Jacobin defects\r\nof Fouché, the vanity and sensuality of Cambacérès, the careless\r\ncynicism and \"the easy immorality\" of Talleyrand, the \"dry bluntness\"\r\nof Duroc, the courtier-like insipidity of Maret, \"the silliness\" of\r\nBerthier; he brings this out, diverts himself with it, and profits by\r\nit. \"Where he sees no vice, he encourages weaknesses, and, in default\r\nof anything better, he provokes fear, so that he may be ever and\r\ncontinually the strongest.. ..He dreads ties of affection, and strives\r\nto alienate people from each other.... He sells his favors only by\r\narousing anxiety; he thinks that the best way to attach individuals\r\nto him is to compromise them, and often, even, to ruin them in public\r\nopinion.\"--\"If Caulaincourt is compromised,\" said he, after the murder\r\nof the Duc d'Enghien, \"it is no great matter, he will serve me all the\r\nbetter.\"\r\n\r\nOnce that the creature is in his clutches, let him not imagine that\r\nhe can escape or withhold anything of his own accord; all that he has\r\nbelongs to him. Zeal and success in the performance of duty, punctual\r\nobedience within limits previously designated, is not enough; behind the\r\nfunctionary he claims the man. \"All that may well be,\" he replies, to\r\nwhatever may be said in praise of him,[1260] \"but he does not belong to\r\nme as I would like.\" It is devotion which he exacts, and, by devotion,\r\nhe means the irrevocable and complete surrender \"of the entire person,\r\nin all his sentiments and opinions.\" According to him, writes a witness,\r\n\"one must abandon every old habit, even the most trifling, and be\r\ngoverned by one thought alone, that of his will and interests.\"[1261]\r\nFor greater security, his servitors ought to extinguish in themselves\r\nthe critical sense. \"What he fears the most is that, close to him or far\r\noff, the faculty of judging should be applied or even preserved.\"\r\n\r\n\"His idea is a marble groove,\" out of which no mind should\r\ndiverge.[1262] Especially as no two minds could think of diverging\r\nat the same time, and on the same side, their concurrence, even when\r\npassive, their common understanding, even if kept to themselves, their\r\nwhispers, almost inaudible, constitute a league, a faction, and, if they\r\nare functionaries, \"a conspiracy.\" On his return from Spain he declares,\r\nwith a terrible explosion of wrath and threats,[1263] \"that the\r\nministers and high dignitaries whom he has created must stop expressing\r\ntheir opinions and thoughts freely, that they cannot be otherwise than\r\nhis organs, that treason has already begun when they begin to doubt,\r\nand that it is under full headway when, from doubt, they proceed\r\nto dissent.\" If, against his constant encroachments, they strive to\r\npreserve a last refuge, if they refuse to abandon their conscience\r\nto him, their faith as Catholics or their honor as honest men, he is\r\nsurprised and gets irritated. In reply to the Bishop of Ghent, who, in\r\nthe most respectful manner, excuses himself for not taking a second\r\noath that is against his conscience, he rudely turns his back, and\r\nsays, \"Very well, sir, your conscience is a blockhead!\"[1264] Portalis,\r\ndirector of the publishing office,[1265] having received a papal\r\nbrief from his cousin, the Abbé d'Astros, respected a confidential\r\ncommunication; he simply recommended his cousin to keep this document\r\nsecret, and declared that, if it were made public, he would prohibit\r\nits circulation; by way of extra precaution he notified the prefect\r\nof police. But he did not specially denounce his cousin, have the man\r\narrested and the document seized. On the strength of this, the Emperor,\r\nin full council of state, apostrophizes him to his face, and, \"with one\r\nof those looks which go straight through one,\"[1266] declares that he\r\nhas committed \"the vilest of perfidies\"; he bestows on him for half an\r\nhour a hailstorm of reproaches and insults, and then orders him out of\r\nthe room as if a lackey who had been guilty of a theft. Whether he\r\nkeeps within his function or not, the functionary must be content to do\r\nwhatever is demanded of him, and readily anticipate every commission. If\r\nhis scruples arrest him, if he alleges personal obligations, if he had\r\nrather not fail in delicacy, or even in common loyalty, he incurs the\r\nrisk of offending or losing the favor of the master, which is the case\r\nwith M. de Rémusat,[1267] who is unwilling to become his spy, reporter,\r\nand denunciator for the Faubourg Saint-Germain, who does not offer, at\r\nVienna, to pump out of Madame d'André the address of her husband so\r\nthat M. d'André may be taken and immediately shot. Savary, who was\r\nthe negotiator for his being given up, kept constantly telling M. de\r\nRémusat, \"You are going against your interest--I must say that I do\r\nnot comprehend you!\" And yet Savary, himself minister of the police,\r\nexecutor of most important services, head manager of the murder of the\r\nDuc d'Enghien and of the ambuscade at Bayonne, counterfeiter of Austrian\r\nbank-notes for the campaign of 1809 and of Russian banknotes for that\r\nof 1812,[1268] Savary ends in getting weary; he is charged with too many\r\ndirty jobs; however hardened his conscience it has a tender spot; he\r\ndiscovers at last that he has scruples. It is with great repugnance\r\nthat, in February, 1814, he executes the order to have a small infernal\r\nmachine prepared, moving by clock-work, so as to blow up the Bourbons on\r\ntheir return into France.[1269] \"Ah,\" said he, giving himself a blow on\r\nthe forehead, \"it must be admitted that the Emperor is sometimes hard to\r\nserve!\"\r\n\r\nIf he exacts so much from the human creature, it is because, in playing\r\nthe game he has to play, he must absorb everything; in the situation in\r\nwhich he has placed himself, caution is unnecessary. \"Is a statesman,\"\r\nsaid he, \"made to have feeling? Is he not wholly an eccentric\r\npersonage, always alone by himself, he on one side and the world on the\r\nother?\"[1270]\r\n\r\nIn this duel without truce or mercy, people interest him only whilst\r\nthey are useful to him; their value depends on what he can make out of\r\nthem; his sole business is to squeeze them, to extract to the last drop\r\nwhatever is available in them.\r\n\r\n\"I find very little satisfaction in useless sentiments,\" said he\r\nagain,[1271] \"and Berthier is so mediocre that I do not know why I waste\r\nmy time on him. And yet when I am not set against him, I am not sure\r\nthat I do not like him.\"\r\n\r\nHe goes no further. According to him, this indifference is necessary in\r\na statesman. The glass he looks through is that of his own\r\npolicy;[1272] he must take care that it does not magnify or diminish\r\nobjects.--Therefore, outside of explosions of nervous sensibility,\r\n\"he has no consideration for men other than that of a foreman for his\r\nworkmen,\"[1273] or, more precisely, for his tools; once the tool is worn\r\nout, little does he care whether it rusts away in a corner or is cast\r\naside on a heap of scrap-iron. \"Portalis, Minister of Justice,[1274]\r\nenters his room one day with a downcast look and his eyes filled with\r\ntears. 'What's the matter with you, Portalis?' inquired Napoleon, 'are\r\nyou ill? 'No, sire, but very wretched. The poor Archbishop of Tours, my\r\nold schoolmate...' 'Eh, well, what has happened to him?' 'Alas, sire, he\r\nhas just died.' 'What do I care? he was no longer good for anything.'\"\r\nOwning and making the most of men and of things, of bodies and of souls,\r\nusing and abusing them at discretion, even to exhaustion, without being\r\nresponsible to any one, he reaches that point after a few years where he\r\ncan say as glibly and more despotically than Louis XIV. himself,\r\n\r\n\"My armies, my fleets, my cardinals, my councils, my senate, my\r\npopulations, my empire.\"[1275]\r\n\r\nAddressing army corps about to rush into battle:\r\n\r\n\"Soldiers, I need your lives, and you owe them to me.\"\r\n\r\nHe says to General Dorsenne and to the grenadiers of the guard:[1276]\r\n\r\n\"I hear that you complain that you want to return to Paris, to your\r\nmistresses. Undeceive yourselves. I shall keep you under arms until you\r\nare eighty. You were born to the bivouac, and you shall die there.\"\r\n\r\nHow he treats his brothers and relations who have become kings; how he\r\nreins them in; how he applies the spur and the whip and makes them trot\r\nand jump fences and ditches, may be found in his correspondence; every\r\nstray impulse to take the lead, even when justified by an unforeseen\r\nurgency and with the most evident good intention, is suppressed as a\r\ndeviation, is arrested with a brusque roughness which strains the loins\r\nand weakens the knees of the delinquent. The amiable Prince Eugene, so\r\nobedient and so loyal,[1277] is thus warned:\r\n\r\n\"If you want orders or advice from His Majesty in the alteration of\r\nthe ceiling of your room you should wait till you get them; were Milan\r\nburning and you asked orders for putting out the fire, you should let\r\nMilan burn until you got them... His Majesty is displeased, and very\r\nmuch displeased, with you; you must never attempt to do his work. Never\r\ndoes he like this, and he will never forgive it.\"\r\n\r\nThis enables us to judge of his tone with subalterns. The French\r\nbattalions are refused admission into certain places in Holland:[1278]\r\n\r\n\"Announce to the King of Holland, that if his ministers have acted on\r\ntheir own responsibility, I will have them arrested and all their heads\r\ncut off.\"\r\n\r\nHe says to M. de Ségur, member of the Academy commission which had just\r\napproved M. de Chateaubriand's discourse:[1279]\r\n\r\n\"You, and M. de Fontaines, as state councillor and grand master, I ought\r\nto put in Vincennes.... Tell the second class of the Institute that\r\nI will have no political subjects treated at its meetings.....If it\r\ndisobeys, I will break it up like a bad club.\r\n\r\nEven when not angry or scolding,[1280] when the claws are drawn in,\r\none feels the clutch. He says to Beugnot, whom he has just berated,\r\nscandalously and unjustly,--conscious of having done him injustice and\r\nwith a view to produce an effect on the bystanders,--\r\n\r\n\"Well, you great imbecile, you have got back your brains?\"\r\n\r\nOn this, Beugnot, tall as a drum-major, bows very low, while the smaller\r\nman, raising his hand, seizes him by the ear, \"a heady mark of favor,\"\r\nsays Beugnot, a sign of familiarity and of returning good humor. And\r\nbetter yet, the master deigns to lecture Beugnot on his personal tastes,\r\non his regrets, on his wish to return to France: What would he like? To\r\nbe his minister in Paris? \"Judging by what he saw of me the other day I\r\nshould not be there very long; I might die of worry before the end\r\nof the month.\" He has already killed Portalis, Cretet, and almost\r\nTreilhard, even though he had led a hard life: he could no longer\r\nurinate, nor the others either. The same thing would have happened to\r\nBeignot, if not worse....\r\n\r\n\"Stay here.... after which you will be old, or rather we all shall be\r\nold, and I will send you to the Senate to drivel at your ease.\"\r\n\r\nEvidently,[1281] the nearer one is to his person the more disagreeable\r\nlife becomes.[1282] \"Admirably served, promptly obeyed to the minute, he\r\nstill delights in keeping everybody around him in terror concerning the\r\ndetails of all that goes on in his palace.\" Has any difficult task been\r\naccomplished? He expresses no thanks, never or scarcely ever praises,\r\nand, which happens but once, in the case of M. de Champagny, Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs, who is praised for having finished the treaty of Vienna\r\nin one night, and with unexpected advantages;[1283] this time, the\r\nEmperor has thought aloud, is taken by surprise; \"ordinarily, he\r\nmanifests approbation only by his silence.\"--When M. de Rémusat, prefect\r\nof the palace, has arranged \"one of those magnificent fêtes in which\r\nall the arts minister to his enjoyment,\" economically, correctly, with\r\nsplendor and success, his wife never asks her husband[1284] if the\r\nEmperor is satisfied, but whether he has scolded more or less.\r\n\r\n\"His leading general principle, which he applies in every way, in great\r\nthings as well as in small ones, is that a man's zeal depends upon his\r\nanxiety.\"\r\n\r\nHow insupportable the constraint he exercises, with what crushing weight\r\nhis absolutism bears down on the most tried devotion and on the most\r\npliable characters, with what excess he tramples on and wounds the best\r\ndispositions, up to what point he represses and stifles the respiration\r\nof the human being, he knows as well as anybody. He was heard to say,\r\n\r\n\"The lucky man is he who hides away from me in the depths of some\r\nprovince.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, another day, having asked M. de Ségur what people would say of\r\nhim after his death, the latter enlarged on the regrets which would\r\nbe universally expressed. \"Not at all,\" replied the Emperor; and then,\r\ndrawing in his breath in a significant manner indicative of universal\r\nrelief, he replied,\r\n\r\n\"They'll say, 'Whew!'\"[1285]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. His Bad Manners.\r\n\r\n     His bearings in Society.--His deportment toward Women.--His\r\n     disdain of Politeness.\r\n\r\nThere are very few monarchs, even absolute, who persistently, and\r\nfrom morning to night, maintain a despotic attitude. Generally, and\r\nespecially in France, the sovereign makes two divisions of his time, one\r\nfor business and the other for social duties, and, in the latter case,\r\nwhile always head of the State, he is also head of his house: for he\r\nwelcomes visitors, entertains his guests, and, that his guests may not\r\nbe robots, he tries to put them at their ease.--That was the case with\r\nLouis XIV.[1286]--polite to everybody, always affable with men, and\r\nsometimes gracious, always courteous with women, and some times gallant,\r\ncarefully avoiding brusqueness, ostentation, and sarcasms, never\r\nallowing himself to use an offensive word, never making people feel\r\ntheir inferiority and dependence, but, on the contrary, encouraging them\r\nto express opinions, and even to converse, tolerating in conversation\r\na semblance of equality, smiling at a repartee, playfully telling a\r\nstory--such was his drawing-room constitution. The drawing-room as well\r\nas every human society needs one, and a liberal one; otherwise life dies\r\nout. Accordingly, the observance of this constitution in by-gone society\r\nis known by the phrase savoir-vivre, and, more rigidly than anybody\r\nelse, Louis XIV. submitted himself to this code of proprieties.\r\nTraditionally, and through education, he had consideration for others,\r\nat least for the people around him; his courtiers becoming his guests\r\nwithout ceasing to be his subjects.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing of this sort with Napoleon. He preserves nothing of the\r\netiquette he borrows from the old court but its rigid discipline and\r\nits pompous parade. \"The ceremonial system,\" says an eyewitness, \"was\r\ncarried out as if it had been regulated by the tap of a drum; everything\r\nwas done, in a certain sense, 'double-quick.'[1287]... This air of\r\nprecipitation, this constant anxiety which it inspires,\" puts an end\r\nto all comfort, all ease, all entertainment, all agreeable intercourse;\r\nthere is no common bond but that of command and obedience. \"The few\r\nindividuals he singles out, Savary, Duroc, Maret, keep silent and simply\r\ntransmit orders.... We did not appear to them, in doing what we were\r\nordered to do, and we did not appear to ourselves, other than veritable\r\nmachines, all resembling, or but little short of it, the elegant gilded\r\narm-chairs with which the palaces of Saint-Cloud and the Tuileries had\r\njust been embellished.\"\r\n\r\nFor a machine to work well it is important that the machinist should\r\noverhaul it frequently, which this one never fails to do, especially\r\nafter a long absence. Whilst he is on his way from Tilsit, \"everybody\r\nanxiously examines his conscience to ascertain what he has done that\r\nthis rigid master will find fault with on his return. Whether spouse,\r\nfamily, or grand dignitary, each is more or less disturbed; while\r\nthe Empress, who knows him better than any one, naively says, 'As\r\nthe Emperor is so happy it is certain that he will do a deal of\r\nscolding!'\"[1288] Actually, he has scarcely arrived when he gives a rude\r\nand vigorous wrench of the bolt; and then, \"satisfied at having excited\r\nterror all around, he appears to have forgotten what has passed and\r\nresumes the usual tenor of his life.\" \"Through calculation as well as\r\nfrom taste,[1289] he never ceases to be a monarch\"; hence, \"a mute,\r\nfrigid court.... more dismal than dignified; every face wears an\r\nexpression of uneasiness... a silence both dull and constrained.\"\r\nAt Fontainebleau, \"amidst splendors and pleasures,\" there is no real\r\nenjoyment nor anything agreeable, not even for himself. \"I pity\r\nyou,\" said M. de Talleyrand to M. de Rémusat, \"you have to amuse the\r\nunamusable.\" At the theatre he is abstracted or yawns. Applause is\r\nprohibited; the court, sitting out \"the file of eternal tragedies,\r\nis mortally bored.... the young ladies fall asleep, people leave the\r\ntheatre, gloomy and discontented.\"--There is the same constraint in the\r\ndrawing-room. \"He did not know how to appear at ease, and I believe that\r\nhe never wanted anybody else to be so, afraid of the slightest approach\r\nto familiarity, and inspiring each with a fear of saying something\r\noffensive to his neighbor before witnesses.... During the quadrille,\r\nhe moves around amongst the rows of ladies, addressing them with\r\nsome trifling or disagreeable remark,\" and never does he accost them\r\notherwise than \"awkwardly and ill at his ease.\" At bottom, he distrusts\r\nthem and is ill-disposed toward them.[1290] It is because \"the\r\npower they have acquired in society seems to him an intolerable\r\nusurpation.--\"Never did he utter to a woman a graceful or even a\r\nwell-turned compliment, although the effort to find one was often\r\napparent on his face and in the tone of his voice.... He talks to them\r\nonly of their toilet, of which he declares himself a severe and minute\r\njudge, and on which he indulges in not very delicate jests; or again, on\r\nthe number of their children, demanding of them in rude language whether\r\nthey nurse them themselves; or again, lecturing them on their social\r\nrelations.\"[1291] Hence, \"there is not one who does not rejoice when he\r\nmoves off.\"[1292] He would often amuse himself by putting them out of\r\ncountenance, scandalizing and bantering them to their faces, driving\r\nthem into a corner the same as a colonel worries his canteen women.\r\n\"Yes, ladies, you furnish the good people of the Faubourg Saint-Germain\r\nwith something to talk about. It is said, Madame A..., that you are\r\nintimate with Monsieur B..., and you Madame C...., with Monsieur D.\" On\r\nany intrigue chancing to appear in the police reports, \"he loses no time\r\nin informing the husband of what is going on.\"--He is no less indiscreet\r\nin relation to his own affairs;[1293] when it is over he divulges the\r\nfact and gives the name; furthermore, he informs Josephine in detail\r\nand will not listen to any reproach: \"I have a right to answer all your\r\nobjections with an eternal I!\"\r\n\r\nThis term, indeed, answers to everything, and he explains it by adding:\r\n\"I stand apart from other men. I accept nobody's conditions,\" nor any\r\nspecies of obligation, no code whatever, not even the common code\r\nof outward civility, which, diminishing or dissimulating primitive\r\nbrutality, allows men to associate together without clashing. He does\r\nnot comprehend it, and he repudiates it. \"I have little liking,\"[1294]\r\nhe says, \"for that vague, leveling word propriety (convenances), which\r\nyou people fling out every chance you get. It is an invention of fools\r\nwho want to pass for clever men; a kind of social muzzle which annoys\r\nthe strong and is useful only to the mediocre... Ah, good taste! Another\r\nclassic expression which I do not accept.\" \"It is your personal enemy\";\r\nsays Talleyrand to him, one day, \"if you could have shot it away with\r\nbullets, it would have disappeared long ago!\"--It is because good taste\r\nis the highest attainment of civilization, the innermost vestment\r\nwhich drapes human nudity, which best fits the person, the last garment\r\nretained after the others have been cast off, and which delicate tissue\r\ncontinues to hamper Napoleon; he throws it off instinctively, because\r\nit interferes with his natural behavior, with the uncurbed, dominating,\r\nsavage ways of the vanquisher who knocks down his adversary and treats\r\nhim as he pleases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. His Policy.\r\n\r\n     His tone and bearing towards Sovereigns.--His Policy.--His\r\n     means and ends.--After Sovereigns he sets populations\r\n     against him.--Final opinion of Europe.\r\n\r\nSuch behavior render social intercourse impossible, especially among the\r\nindependent and armed personages known as nations or States. This is why\r\nthey are outlawed in politics and in diplomacy and every head of a State\r\nor representative of a country, carefully and on principle, abstains\r\nfrom them, at least with those on his own level. He is bound to treat\r\nthese as his equals, humor them, and, accordingly, not to give way\r\nto the irritation of the moment or to personal feeling; in short, to\r\nexercise self-control and measure his words. To this is due the tone of\r\nmanifestos, protocols, dispatches, and other public documents the formal\r\nlanguage of legations, so cold, dry, and elaborated, those expressions\r\npurposely attenuated and smoothed down, those long phrases apparently\r\nspun out mechanically and always after the same pattern, a sort of soft\r\nwadding or international buffer interposed between contestants to lessen\r\nthe shocks of collision. The reciprocal irritations between States are\r\nalready too great; there are ever too many unavoidable and regrettable\r\nencounters, too many causes of conflict, the consequences of which are\r\ntoo serious; it is unnecessary to add to the wounds of interest the\r\nwounds of imagination and of pride; and above all, it is unnecessary to\r\namplify these without reason, at the risk of increasing the obstacles of\r\nto-day and the resentments of to-morrow.--With Napoleon it is just the\r\nopposite: his attitude, even at peaceful interviews, remains aggressive\r\nand militant; purposely or in-voluntarily, he raises his hand and the\r\nblow is felt to be coming, while, in the meantime, he insults. In his\r\ncorrespondence with sovereigns, in his official proclamations, in his\r\ndeliberations with ambassadors, and even at public audiences,[1295] he\r\nprovokes, threatens, and defies.[1296] He treats his adversary with a\r\nlofty air, insults him often to his face, and charges him with the most\r\ndisgraceful imputations.[1297] He divulges the secrets of his private\r\nlife, of his closet, and of his bed; he defames or calumniates his\r\nministers, his court, and his wife;[1298] he purposely stabs him in the\r\nmost sensitive part. He tells one that he is a dupe, a betrayed husband;\r\nanother that he is an abettor of assassination; he assumes the air of a\r\njudge condemning a criminal, or the tone of a superior reprimanding an\r\ninferior, or, at best, that of a teacher taking a scholar to task. With\r\na smile of pity, he points out mistakes, weak points, and incapacity,\r\nand shows him beforehand that he must be defeated. On receiving the\r\nenvoy of the Emperor Alexander at Wilna,[1299] be says to him:\r\n\r\n\"Russia does not want this war; none of the European powers are in favor\r\nof it; England herself does not want it, for she foresees the harm it\r\nwill do to Russia, and even, perhaps, the greatest... I know as well\r\nas yourself, and perhaps even better, how many troops you have. Your\r\ninfantry in all amounts to 120,000 men and your cavalry to about 60,000\r\nor 70,000; I have three times as many.... The Emperor Alexander is badly\r\nadvised. How can he tolerate such vile people around him--an Armfeld, an\r\nintriguing, depraved, rascally fellow, a ruined debauchee, who is known\r\nonly by his crimes and who is the enemy of Russia; a Stein, driven from\r\nhis country like an outcast, a miscreant with a price on his head; a\r\nBennigsen, who, it is said, has some military talent, of which I know\r\nnothing, but whose hands are steeped in blood?[12100].... Let him\r\nsurround himself with the Russians and I will say nothing.... Have you\r\nno Russian gentlemen among you who are certainly more attached to\r\nhim than these mercenaries? Does he imagine that they are fond of him\r\npersonally? Let him put Armfeld in command in Finland and I have nothing\r\nto say; but to have him about his person, for shame!.... What a\r\nsuperb perspective opened out to the Emperor Alexander at Tilsit, and\r\nespecially at Erfurt!.... He has spoilt the finest reign Russia ever\r\nsaw.... How can he admit to his society such men as a Stein, an Armfeld,\r\na Vinzingerode? Say to the Emperor Alexander, that as he gathers around\r\nhim my personal enemies it means a desire to insult me personally,\r\nand, consequently, that I must do the same to him. I will drive all his\r\nBaden, Wurtemburg, and Weimar relations out of Germany. Let him provide\r\na refuge for them in Russia!\"\r\n\r\nNote what he means by--personal insult[12101], how he intends to avenge\r\nhimself by reprisals of the worst kind, to what excess he carries his\r\ninterference, how he enters the cabinets of foreign sovereigns, forcibly\r\nentering and breaking, to drive out their councilors and control their\r\nmeetings: like the Roman senate with an Antiochus or a Prusias, like an\r\nEnglish Resident with the King of Oude or of Lahore. With others as at\r\nhome, he cannot help but act as a master. The aspiration for universal\r\ndominion is in his very nature; it may be modified, kept in check, but\r\nnever can it be completely stifled.\"[12102]\r\n\r\nIt declares itself on the organization of the Consulate. It explains\r\nwhy the peace of Amiens could not last; apart from the diplomatic\r\ndiscussions and behind his alleged grievances, his character, his\r\nexactions, his avowed plans, and the use he intends making of his\r\nforces form the real and true causes of the rupture. In comprehensible\r\nsometimes even in explicit terms, he tells the English: Expel the\r\nBourbons from your island and close the mouths of your journalists. If\r\nthis is against your constitution so much the worse for it, or so much\r\nthe worse for you. \"There are general principles of international law\r\nto which the (special) laws of states must give way.\"[12103] Change your\r\nfundamental laws. Suppress the freedom of the press and the right\r\nof asylum on your soil, the same as I have done. \"I have a very poor\r\nopinion of a government which is not strong enough to interdict\r\nthings objectionable to foreign governments.\"[12104] As to mine, my\r\ninterference with my neighbors, my late acquisitions of territory, that\r\ndoes not concern you: \"I suppose that you want to talk about Piedmont\r\nand Switzerland? These are trifles\"[12105] \"Europe recognizes that\r\nHolland, Italy, and Switzerland are at the disposition of France.[12106]\r\nOn the other hand, Spain submits to me and through her I hold Portugal.\r\nThus, from Amsterdam to Bordeaux, from Lisbon to Cadiz and Genoa, from\r\nLeghorn to Naples and to Tarentum, I can close every port to you; no\r\ntreaty of commerce between us. Any treaty that I might grant to you\r\nwould be trifling: for each million of merchandise that you would send\r\ninto France a million of French merchandise would be exported;[12107]\r\nin other words, you would be subject to an open or concealed continental\r\nblockade, which would cause you as much distress in peace as if you\r\nwere at war.\" My eyes are nevertheless fixed on Egypt; \"six thousand\r\nFrenchmen would now suffice to re-conquer it\";[12108] forcibly, or\r\notherwise, I shall return there; opportunities will not be lacking, and\r\nI shall be on the watch for them; \"sooner or later she will belong to\r\nFrance, either through the dissolution of the Ottoman empire, or through\r\nsome arrangement with the Porte.\"[12109] Evacuate Malta so that the\r\nMediterranean may become a French lake; I must rule on sea as on land,\r\nand dispose of the Orient as of the Occident. In sum, \"with my France,\r\nEngland must naturally end in becoming simply an appendix: nature has\r\nmade her one of our islands, the same as Oleron or Corsica.\"[12110]\r\nNaturally, with such a perspective before them, the English keep Malta\r\nand recommence the war. He has anticipated such an occurrence, and his\r\nresolution is taken; at a glance, he perceives and measures the\r\npath this will open to him; with his usual clear-sightedness he has\r\ncomprehended, and he announces that the English resistance \"forces him\r\nto conquer Europe....\" [12111]--\"The First Consul is only thirty-three\r\nand has thus far destroyed only the second-class governments. Who knows\r\nhow much time he will require to again change the face of Europe and\r\nresurrect the Western Roman Empire?\"\r\n\r\nTo subjugate the Continent in order to form a coalition against England,\r\nsuch, henceforth, are his means, which are as violent as the end in\r\nview, while the means, like the end, are given by his character. Too\r\nimperious and too impatient to wait or to manage others, he is\r\nincapable of yielding to their will except through constraint, and his\r\ncollaborators are to him nothing more than subjects under the name\r\nof allies.--Later, at St. Helena, with his indestructible imaginative\r\nenergy and power of illusion, he plays on the public with his\r\nhumanitarian illusions.[12112] But, as he himself avows, the\r\naccomplishment of his retrospective dream required beforehand the\r\nentire submission of all Europe; a liberal sovereign and pacificator,\r\n\"a crowned Washington, yes,\" he used to say, \"but I could not reasonably\r\nattain this point, except through a universal dictatorship, which I\r\naimed at.\"[12113] In vain does common sense demonstrate to him that such\r\nan enterprise inevitably rallies the Continent to the side of England,\r\nand that his means divert him from the end. In vain is it repeatedly\r\nrepresented to him that he needs one sure great ally on the\r\nContinent;[12114] that to obtain this he must conciliate Austria; that\r\nhe must not drive her to despair, but rather win her over and compensate\r\nher on the side of the Orient; place her in permanent conflict with\r\nRussia, and attach her to the new French Empire by a community of vital\r\ninterests. In vain does he, after Tilsit, make a bargain of this kind\r\nwith Russia. This bargain cannot hold, because in this arrangement\r\nNapoleon, as usual with him, always encroaching, threatening, and\r\nattacking, wants to reduce Alexander to the role of a subordinate and\r\na dupe.[12115] No clear-sighted witness can doubt this. In 1809,\r\na diplomat writes: \"The French system, which is now triumphant, is\r\ndirected against the whole body of great states,\"[12116] not alone\r\nagainst England, Prussia, and Austria, but against Russia, against\r\nevery power capable of maintaining its independence; for, if she\r\nremains independent, she may become hostile, and as a precautionary step\r\nNapoleon crushes in her a probable enemy.\r\n\r\nAll the more so because this course once entered upon he cannot stop;\r\nat the same time his character and the situation in which he has\r\nplaced himself impels him on while his past hurries him along to his\r\nfuture.[12117] At the moment of the rupture of the treaty of Amiens he\r\nis already so strong and so aggressive that his neighbors are obliged,\r\nfor their own security, to form an alliance with England; this leads him\r\nto break down all the old monarchies that are still intact, to conquer\r\nNaples, to mutilate Austria the first time, to dismember and cut up\r\nPrussia, to mutilate Austria the second time, to manufacture kingdoms\r\nfor his brothers at Naples, in Holland and in Westphalia.--At this same\r\ndate, all the ports of his empire are closed against the English, which\r\nleads him to close against them all the ports of the Continent, to\r\norganize against them the continental blockade, to proclaim against them\r\nan European crusade, to prevent the neutrality of sovereigns like\r\nthe Pope, of lukewarm subalterns like his brother Louis, of doubtful\r\ncollaborators or inadequate, like the Braganzas of Portugal and the\r\nBourbons of Spain, and therefore to get hold of Portugal, Spain, the\r\nPontifical States, and Holland, and next of the Hanseatic towns and the\r\nduchy of Oldenburg, to extending along the entire coast, from the\r\nmouths of the Cattaro and Trieste to Hamburg and Dantzic, his cordon of\r\nmilitary chiefs, prefects, and custom-houses, a sort of net of which he\r\ndraws the meshes tighter and tighter every day, even stifling not alone\r\nhis home consumer, but the producer and the merchant.[12118]--And all\r\nthis sometimes by a simple decree, with no other alleged motive than\r\nhis interest, his convenience, or his pleasure,[12119] brusquely\r\nand arbitrarily, in violation of international law, humanity, and\r\nhospitality. It would take volumes to describe his abuses of power, the\r\ntissue of brutalities and knaveries,[12120] the oppression of the ally\r\nand despoiling of the vanquished, the military brigandage exercised over\r\npopulations in time of war, and by the systematic exactions practiced on\r\nthem in times of peace.[12121]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after 1808, these populations rise against him. He has so\r\ndeeply injured them in their interests, and hurt their feelings to such\r\nan extent,[12122] he has so trodden them down, ransomed, and forced them\r\ninto his service. He has destroyed, apart from French lives, so many\r\nSpanish, Italian, Austrian, Prussian, Swiss, Bavarian, Saxon, and Dutch\r\nlives, he has slain so many men as enemies, he has enlisted such numbers\r\nat home, and slain so many under his own banners as auxiliaries, that\r\nnations are still more hostile to him than sovereigns. Unquestionably,\r\nnobody can live together with such a character; his genius is too vast,\r\ntoo baneful, and all the more because it is so vast. War will last as\r\nlong as he reigns; it is in vain to reduce him, to confine him at home,\r\nto drive him back within the ancient frontiers of France; no barrier\r\nwill restrain him; no treaty will bind him; peace with him will never\r\nbe other than a truce; he will use it simply to recover himself, and, as\r\nsoon as he has done this, he will begin again;[12123] he is in his\r\nvery essence anti-social. The mind of Europe in this respect is made up\r\ndefinitely and unshakably. One petty detail alone shows how unanimous\r\nand profound this conviction was. On the 7th of March the news reached\r\nVienna that he had escaped from the island of Elba, without its being\r\nyet known where he would land. M. de Metternich[12124] brings the news\r\nto the Emperor of Austria before eight o'clock in the morning, who says\r\nto him, \"Lose no time in finding the King of Prussia and the Emperor of\r\nRussia, and tell them that I am ready to order my army to march at once\r\nfor France.\" At a quarter past eight M. de Metternich is with the Czar,\r\nand at half-past eight, with the King of Prussia; both of them reply\r\ninstantly in the same manner. \"At nine o'clock,\" says M. de Metternich,\r\n\"I was back. At ten o'clock aids flew in every direction countermanding\r\narmy orders.... Thus was war declared in less than an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Fundamental Defaults of his System.\r\n\r\n     Inward principle of his outward deportment.--He subordinates\r\n     the State to him instead of subordinating himself to the\r\n     State.--Effect of this.--His work merely a life-interest.\r\n     --It is ephemeral.--Injurious.--The number of lives it cost.\r\n     --The mutilation of France.--Vice of construction in his\r\n     European edifice.--Analogous vice in his French edifice.\r\n\r\nOther heads of states have similarly passed their lives in doing\r\nviolence to mankind; but it was for something that was likely to last,\r\nand for a national interest. What they deemed the public good was not\r\na phantom of the brain, a chimerical poem due to a caprice of the\r\nimagination, to personal passions, to their own peculiar ambition and\r\npride. Outside of themselves and the coinage of their brain a real and\r\nsubstantial object of prime importance existed, namely, the State,\r\nthe great body of society, the vast organism which lasts indefinitely\r\nthrough the long series of interlinked and responsible generations. If\r\nthey drew blood from the passing generation it was for the benefit of\r\ncoming generations, to preserve them from civil war or from foreign\r\ndomination.[12125] They have acted generally like able surgeons, if\r\nnot through virtue, at least through dynastic sentiment and family\r\ntraditions; having practiced from father to son, they had acquired the\r\nprofessional conscience; their first and only aim was the safety and\r\nhealth of their patient. It is for this reason that they have not\r\nrecklessly undertaken extravagant, bloody, and over-risky operations;\r\nrarely have they given way to temptation through a desire to display\r\ntheir skill, through the need of dazzling and astonishing the world,\r\nthrough the novelty, keenness, and success of their saws and scalpels.\r\nThey felt that a longer and superior existence to their own was imposed\r\nupon them; they looked beyond them-selves as far as their sight would\r\nreach, and so took measures that the State after them might do without\r\nthem, live on intact, remain independent, vigorous, and respected\r\nathwart the vicissitudes of European conflict and the uncertain problems\r\nof coming history. Such, under the ancient régime, was what were called\r\nreasons of state; these had prevailed in the councils of princes for\r\neight hundred years; along with unavoidable failures and after temporary\r\ndeviations, these had become for the time being and remained the\r\npreponderating motive. Undoubtedly they excused or authorized many\r\nbreaches of faith, many outrages, and, to come to the word, many crimes;\r\nbut, in the political order of things, especially in the management of\r\nexternal affairs, they furnished a governing and a salutary principle.\r\nUnder its constant influence thirty monarchs had labored, and it is thus\r\nthat, province after province, they had solidly and enduringly built up\r\nFrance, by ways and means beyond the reach of individuals but available\r\nto the heads of States.\r\n\r\nNow, this principle is lacking with their improvised successor. On the\r\nthrone as in the camp, whether general, consul, or emperor, he remains\r\nthe military adventurer, and cares only for his own advancement. Owing\r\nto the great defect in the education of both conscience and sentiments,\r\ninstead of subordinating himself to the State, he subordinates the State\r\nto him; he does not look beyond his own brief physical existence to the\r\nnation which is to survive him. Consequently, he sacrifices the future\r\nto the present, and his work is not to be enduring. After him the\r\ndeluge! Little does he care who utters this terrible phrase; and worse\r\nstill, he earnestly wishes, from the bottom of his heart that everybody\r\nshould utter it.\r\n\r\n\"My brother,\" said Joseph, in 1803,[12126] \"desires that the necessity\r\nof his existence should be so strongly felt, and the benefit of\r\nthis considered so great, that nobody could look beyond it without\r\nshuddering. He knows, and he feels it, that he reigns through this idea\r\nrather than through force or gratitude. If to-morrow, or on any day, it\r\ncould be said, 'Here is a tranquil, established order of things, here\r\nis a known successor; Bonaparte might die without fear of change or\r\ndisturbance,' my brother would no longer think himself secure.... Such\r\nis the principle which governs him.\"\r\n\r\nIn vain do years glide by, never does he think of putting France in\r\na way to subsist without him; on the contrary, he jeopardizes lasting\r\nacquisitions by exaggerated annexations, and it is evident from the very\r\nfirst day that the Empire will end with the Emperor. In 1805, the five\r\nper cents being at eighty francs, his Minister of the Finances, Gaudin,\r\nobserves to him that this is a reasonable rate.[12127] \"No complaint\r\ncan now be made, since these funds are an annuity on Your Majesty's\r\nlife.\"--\"What do you mean by that?\"--\"I mean that the Empire has become\r\nso great as to be ungovernable without you.\"--\"If my successor is a fool\r\nso much the worse for him!\"--\"Yes, but so much the worse for France!\"\r\nTwo years later, M. de Metternich, by way of a political summing\r\nup, expresses his general opinion: \"It is remarkable that Napoleon,\r\nconstantly disturbing and modifying the relations of all Europe, has\r\nnot yet taken a single step toward ensuring the maintenance of his\r\nsuccessors.\"[12128] In 1809, adds the same diplomat:[12129] \"His death\r\nwill be the signal for a new and frightful upheaval; so many divided\r\nelements all tend to combine. Deposed sovereigns will be recalled by\r\nformer subjects; new princes will have new crowns to defend. A veritable\r\ncivil war will rage for half a century over the vast empire of the\r\ncontinent the day when the arms of iron which held the reins are\r\nturned into dust.\" In 1811, \"everybody is convinced[12130] that on\r\nthe disappearance of Napoleon, the master in whose hands all power is\r\nconcentrated, the first inevitable consequence will be a revolution.\"\r\nAt home, in France, at this same date, his own servitors begin to\r\ncomprehend that his empire is not merely a life-interest and will not\r\nlast after he is gone, but that the Empire is ephemeral and will not\r\nlast during his life; for he is constantly raising his edifice higher\r\nand higher, while all that his building gains in elevation\r\nit loses in stability. \"The Emperor is crazy,\" said Decrees to\r\nMarmont,[12131]\"completely crazy. He will ruin us all, numerous as we\r\nare, and all will end in some frightful catastrophe.\" In effect, he is\r\npushing France on to the abyss, forcibly and by deceiving her, through a\r\nbreach of trust which willfully, and by his fault, grows worse and worse\r\njust as his own interests, as he comprehends these, diverge from those\r\nof the public from year to year.\r\n\r\nAt the treaty of Luneville and before the rupture of the peace of\r\nAmiens,[12132] this variance was already considerable. It becomes\r\nmanifest at the treaty of Presbourg and still more evident at the treaty\r\nof Tilsit. It is glaring in 1808, after the deposition of the Spanish\r\nBourbons; it becomes scandalous and monstrous in 1812, when the war with\r\nRussia took place. Napoleon himself admits that this war is against\r\nthe interests of France and yet he undertakes it.[12133] Later, at St.\r\nHelena, he falls into a melting mood over \"the French people whom he\r\nloved so dearly.\"[12134] The truth is, he loves it as a rider loves his\r\nhorse; as he makes it rear and prance and show off its paces, when he\r\nflatters and caresses it; it is not for the advantage of the animal but\r\nfor his own purposes, on account of its usefulness to him; to be spurred\r\non until exhausted, to jump ditches growing wider and wider, and leap\r\nfences growing higher and higher; one ditch more, and still another\r\nfence, the last obstacle which seems to be the last, succeeded by\r\nothers, while, in any event, the horse remains forcibly and for ever,\r\nwhat it already is, namely, a beast of burden and broken down.--For, on\r\nthis Russian expedition, instead of frightful disasters, let us imagine\r\na brilliant success, a victory at Smolensk equal to that of Friedland,\r\na treaty of Moscow more advantageous than that of Tilsit, and the\r\nCzar brought to heel. As a result the Czar is probably strangled or\r\ndethroned, a patriotic insurrection will take place in Russia as in\r\nSpain, two lasting wars, at the two extremities of the Continent,\r\nagainst religious fanaticism, more irreconcilable than positive\r\ninterests, and against a scattered barbarism more indomitable than a\r\nconcentrated civilization. At best, a European empire secretly mined\r\nby European resistance; an exterior France forcibly superposed on\r\nthe enslaved Continent;[12135] French residents and commanders at\r\nSt. Petersburg and Riga as at Dantzic, Hamburg, Amsterdam, Lisbon,\r\nBarcelona, and Trieste. Every able-bodied Frenchman that can be employed\r\nfrom Cadiz to Moscow in maintaining and administering the conquest. All\r\nthe able-bodied youth annually seized by the conscription, and, if\r\nthey have escaped this, seized again by decrees.[12136] The entire male\r\npopulation thus devoted to works of constraint, nothing else in prospect\r\nfor either the cultivated or the uncultivated, no military or civil\r\ncareer other than a prolonged guard duty, threatened and threatening,\r\nas soldier, customs-inspector, or gendarme, as prefect, sub-prefect, or\r\ncommissioner of police, that is to say, as subaltern henchman and bully\r\nrestraining subjects and raising contributions, confiscating and burning\r\nmerchandise, seizing grumblers, and making the refractory toe the\r\nmark.[12137] In 1810, one hundred and sixty thousand of the refractory\r\nwere already condemned by name, and, moreover, penalties were imposed\r\non their families to the amount of one hundred and seventy millions\r\nof francs In 1811 and 1812 the roving columns which tracked fugitives\r\ngathered sixty thousand of them, and drove them along the coast from the\r\nAdour to the Niemen; on reaching the frontier, they were en-rolled in\r\nthe grand army; but they desert the very first month, they and their\r\nchained companions, at the rate of four or five thousand a day.[12138]\r\nShould England be conquered, garrisons would have to be maintained\r\nthere, and of soldiers equally zealous. Such is the dark future which\r\nthis system opens to the French, even with the best of good luck. It\r\nturns out that the luck is bad, and at the end of 1812 the grand army is\r\nfreezing in the snow; Napoleon's horse has let him tumble. Fortunately,\r\nthe animal has simply foundered; \"His Majesty's health was never\r\nbetter\";[12139] nothing has happened to the rider; he gets up on his\r\nlegs, and what concerns him at this moment is not the sufferings of his\r\nbroken-down steed, but his own mishap; his reputation as a horseman is\r\ncompromised; the effect on the public, the hooting of the audience, is\r\nwhat troubles him, the comedy of a perilous leap, announced with such a\r\nflourish of trumpets and ending in such a disgraceful fall. On reaching\r\nWarsaw[12140] he says to himself, ten times over:\r\n\r\n\"There is only a step from the sublime to the ridiculous.\"\r\n\r\nThe following year, at Dresden, he exposes still more foolishly, openly,\r\nand nakedly his master passion, the motives which determine him, the\r\nimmensity and ferocity of his pitiless pride.\r\n\r\n\"What do they want of me?\" said he to M. de Metternich.[12141] \"Do they\r\nwant me to dishonor myself? Never! I can die, but never will I yield an\r\ninch of territory! Your sovereigns, born to the throne, may be beaten\r\ntwenty times over and yet return to their capitals: I cannot do this,\r\nbecause I am a parvenu soldier. My domination will not survive the day\r\nwhen I shall have ceased to be strong, and, consequently, feared.\"\r\n\r\nIn effect, his despotism in France is founded on his European\r\nomnipotence; if he does not remain master of the Continent,\" he must\r\nsettle with the corps législatif.[12142] Rather than descend to an\r\ninferior position, rather than be a constitutional monarch, controlled\r\nby parliamentary chambers, he plays double or quits, and will risk\r\nlosing everything.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen your soldiers,\" says Metternich to him, \"they are children.\r\nWhen this army of boys is gone, what will you do then?\"\r\n\r\nAt these words, which touch his heart, he grows pale, his features\r\ncontract, and his rage overcomes him; like a wounded man who has made a\r\nfalse step and exposes himself, he says violently to Metternich:\r\n\r\n\"You are not a soldier You do not know the impulses of a soldier's\r\nbreast! I have grown up on the battle-field, and a man like me does not\r\ngive a damn for the lives of a million men!\"[12143]\r\n\r\nHis imperial pipe-dreams has devoured many more. Between 1804 and 1815\r\nhe has had slaughtered 1,700,000 Frenchmen, born within the boundaries\r\nof ancient France,[12144] to which must be added, probably, 2,000,000\r\nmen born outside of these limits, and slain for him, under the title of\r\nallies, or slain by him under the title of enemies. All that the poor,\r\nenthusiastic, and credulous Gauls have gained by entrusting their public\r\nwelfare to him is two invasions; all that he bequeaths to them as a\r\nreward for their devotion, after this prodigious waste of their blood\r\nand the blood of others, is a France shorn of fifteen departments\r\nacquired by the republic, deprived of Savoy, of the left bank of the\r\nRhine and of Belgium, despoiled of the northeast angle by which it\r\ncompleted its boundaries, fortified its most vulnerable point, and,\r\nusing the words of Vauban, \"made its field square,\" separated from\r\n4,000,000 new Frenchmen which it had assimilated after twenty years of\r\nlife in common, and, worse still, thrown back within the frontiers\r\nof 1789, alone, diminished in the midst of its aggrandized neighbors,\r\nsuspected by all Europe, and lastingly surrounded by a threatening\r\ncircle of distrust and rancor.\r\n\r\nSuch is the political work of Napoleon, the work of egoism served\r\nby genius. In his European structure as in his French structure this\r\nsovereign egoism has introduced a vice of construction. This fundamental\r\nvice is manifest at the outset in the European edifice, and, at the\r\nexpiration of fifteen years, it brings about a sudden downfall: in the\r\nFrench edifice it is equally serious but not so apparent; only at the\r\nend of half a century, or even a whole century, is it to be made clearly\r\nvisible; but its gradual and slow effects will be equally pernicious and\r\nthey are no less sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1201: See my \"Philosophy of Art\" for texts and facts, Part\r\nII., ch. VI.--Other analogies, which are too long for development here,\r\nmay be found, especially in all that concerns the imagination and\r\nlove. \"He was disposed to accept the marvelous, presentiments, and even\r\ncertain mysterious communications between beings....

(Bourrienne, VI., 387, gives one of his improvisations.\r\nCf. Madame de Rémusat, I., 102.)--As to love, his letters to Josephine\r\nduring the Italian campaign form one of the best examples of Italian\r\npassion and \"in most piquant contrast with the temperate and graceful\r\nelegance of his predecessor M. de Beauharnais.\" (Madame de Rémusat,\r\nI., 143).--His other amours, simply physical, are too difficult to deal\r\nwith; I have gathered some details orally on this subject which are\r\nalmost from first hands and perfectly authentic. It is sufficient to\r\ncite one text already published: \"According to Josephine, he had no\r\nmoral principle whatever; did he not seduce his sisters one after the\r\nother? \"--\"I am not a man like other men, he said of himself, \"and moral\r\nlaws and those of propriety do not apply to me.\" (Madame de Rémusat, I.,\r\n204, 206.)--Note again (II., 350) his proposals to Corvisart.--Such are\r\neverywhere the sentiments, customs, and morality of the great Italian\r\npersonages of about the year 1500.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1202: De Pradt, \"Histoire de l'ambassade dans le grand-duché\r\nde Varsovie,\" p.96. \"with the Emperor, desire springs out of his\r\nimagination; his idea becomes passion the moment it comes into his\r\nhead.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1203: Bourrienne, II., 298.--De Ségur, I., 426.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1204: Bodin, \"Recherches sur l'Anjou,\" II., 325.--\"Souvenirs\r\nd'un nonagénaire,\" by Besnard.--Sainte-Beuve, \"Causeries du Lundi,\"\r\narticle on Volney.--Miot de Melito, I., 297.

Napoleon relates that at the last conference\r\nof Campo-Fermio, to put an end to the resistance of the Austrian\r\nplenipotentiary, he suddenly arose, seized a set of porcelain on a stand\r\nnear him and dashed it to the floor, exclaiming, \"Thus will I shatter\r\nyour monarchy before a month is over!\" (Bourrienne questions this\r\nstory.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1205: Varnhagen von Ense, \"Ausgewahlte Schriften,\" III.,\r\n77 (Public reception of July 22, 1810). Napoleon first speaks to\r\nthe Austrian Ambassador and next to the Russian Ambassador with a\r\nconstrained air, forcing himself to be polite, in which he cannot\r\npersist. \"Treating with I do not know what unknown personage, he\r\ninterrogated him, reprimanded him, threatened him, and kept him for a\r\nsufficiently long time in a state of painful dismay. Those who stood\r\nnear by and who could not help feeling a dismayed, stated later that\r\nthere had been nothing to provoke such fury, that the Emperor had only\r\nsought an opportunity to vent his ill-humor; that he did it purposely\r\non some poor devil so as to inspire fear in others and to put down in\r\nadvance any tendency to opposition.

THE INSTITUTION OF GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. The Institution of Government.\r\n\r\n     Conditions on which the public power can act.--Two points\r\n     forgotten by the authors of the preceding constitutions.--\r\n     Difficulty of the undertaking and poor quality of the\r\n     available materials.\r\n\r\nEvery human society requires government, that is to say an authority. No\r\nother machinery is more useful. But a machinery is useful only if it\r\nis adapted to its purpose; if not it will not work, or may even work\r\ncontrary to its purpose. Hence, during its construction, one must first\r\nof all consider the magnitude of the work it has to do as well as the\r\nquality of the materials one has at one's disposal. It is very important\r\nto know beforehand whether it will lift 100 or of 100,000 kilograms,\r\nwhether the pieces fitted together will be of iron or of steel, of\r\nsound or of unsound timber.--But the legislators had not taken that into\r\nconsideration during the last ten years. They had set themselves up as\r\ntheoreticians, and likewise as optimists, without looking at the things,\r\nor else imagining the them as they wished to have them. In the national\r\nassemblies, as well as with the public, the task was deemed easy and\r\nsimple, whereas it was extraordinary and immense; for the matter in\r\nhand consisted in effecting a social revolution and in carrying on an\r\nEuropean war. The materials were supposed to be excellent, as manageable\r\nas they were substantial, while, in fact, they were very poor, being\r\nboth refractory and brittle, for these human materials consisted of\r\nthe Frenchmen of 1789 and of the following years; that is to say,\r\nof exceedingly sensitive men doing each other all possible harm,\r\ninexperienced in political business, Utopians, impatient, intractable,\r\nand overexcited. Calculations had been made on these prodigiously false\r\ndata; consequently, although the calculations were very exact, the\r\nresults obtained were found absurd. Relying on these data, the machine\r\nhad been planned, and all its parts been adjusted, assembled, and\r\nbalanced. That is why the machine, irreproachable in theory, remained\r\nunsuccessful in practice: the better it appeared on paper the quicker it\r\nbroke down when set up on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Default of previous government.\r\n\r\n     The consequences of the years 1789 to 1799.--Insubordination\r\n     of the local powers, conflict of the central powers,\r\n     suppression of liberal institutions, and the establishment\r\n     of an unstable despotism.--Evil-doing of the government thus\r\n     formed.\r\n\r\nA capital defect at once declared itself in the two principal\r\ncompositions, in the working gear of the superposed powers and in the\r\nbalance of the motor powers.--In the first place, the hold given to the\r\ncentral government on its local subordinates was evidently too feeble;\r\nwith no right to appoint these, it could not select them as it pleased,\r\naccording to the requirements of the service. Department, district,\r\ncanton, and commune administrators, civil and criminal judges,\r\nassessors, appraisers, and collectors of taxes, officers of the\r\nnational-guard and even of the gendarmerie, police-commissioners,\r\nand other agents who had to enforce laws on the spot, were nearly all\r\nrecruited elsewhere: either in popular assemblies or provided ready-made\r\nby elected bodies.[2101] They were for it merely borrowed instruments;\r\nthus originating, they escaped its control; it could not make them work\r\nas it wanted them to work. On most occasions they would shirk their\r\nduties; at other times, on receiving orders, they would stand inert;\r\nor, again, they would act outside of or beyond their special function,\r\neither going too far or acting in a contrary sense; never did they act\r\nwith moderation and precision, with coherence and consequence. For this\r\nreason any desire of the government to do its job proved unsuccessful.\r\nIts legal subordinates--incapable, timid, lukewarm, unmanageable, or\r\neven hostile--obeyed badly, did not obey at all, or willfully disobeyed.\r\nThe blade of the executive instrument, loose in the handle, glanced or\r\nbroke off when the thrust had to be made.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, never could the two or three motor forces thrusting\r\nthe handle act in harmony, owing to the clashing of so many of them; one\r\nalways ended in breaking down the other. The Constituent Assembly\r\nhad set aside the King, the Legislative Assembly had deposed him, the\r\nConvention had decapitated him. Afterward each fraction of the sovereign\r\nbody in the Convention had proscribed the other; the Montagnards had\r\nguillotined the Girondists, and the Thermidorians had guillotined\r\nthe Montagnards. Later, under the Constitution of the year III, the\r\nFructidorians had banished the Constitutionalists, the Directory had\r\npurged the Councils, and the Councils had purged the Directory.--Not\r\nonly did the democratic and parliamentary institution fail in its work\r\nand break down on trial, but, again, through its own action, it became\r\ntransformed into its opposite. In a year or two a coup d'état in Paris\r\ntook place; a faction seized the central power and converted it into\r\nan absolute power in the hands of five or six ringleaders. The new\r\ngovernment at once re-forged the executive instrument for its own\r\nadvantage and refastened the blade firmly on the handle; in the\r\nprovinces it dismissed those elected by the people and deprived the\r\ngoverned of the right to choose their own rulers; henceforth, through\r\nits proconsuls on mission, or through its resident commissioners, it\r\nalone appointed, superintended, and regulated on the spot all local\r\nauthorities.[2102]\r\n\r\nThus the liberal constitution, at its close, gave birth to a centralized\r\ndespotism, and this was the worst of its species, at once formless and\r\nmonstrous; for it was born out of a civil crime, while the government\r\nwhich used it had no support but a band of bigoted fanatics or political\r\nadventurers; without any legal authority over the nation, or any moral\r\nhold on the army, detested, threatened, discordant, exposed to the\r\nresistance of its own upholders, to the treachery of its own members,\r\nand living only from day to day, it could maintain itself only through a\r\nbrutal absolutism and permanent terror, while the public power of which\r\nthe first care is the protection of property, consciences, and lives,\r\nbecame in its hands the worst of persecutors, robbers, and murderers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. In 1799, the undertaking more difficult and the materials worse.\r\n\r\nTwice in succession had the experiment been tried, the monarchical\r\nconstitution of 1791, and the republican constitution of 1795; twice in\r\nsuccession had the same events followed the same course to attain the\r\nsame end; twice in succession had the theoretical, cunningly-devised\r\nmachine for universal protection changed into an efficient and brutal\r\nmachine for universal oppression. It is evident that if the same machine\r\nwere started the third time under analogous conditions, one might expect\r\nto see it work in the same manner; that is to say, contrary to its\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nNow, in 1799, the conditions were analogous, and even worse, for the\r\nwork which the machine had to do was not less, while the human materials\r\navailable for its construction were not so good.--Externally, the\r\ncountry was constantly at war with Europe; peace could not be secured\r\nexcept by great military effort, and peace was as difficult to preserve\r\nas to win. The European equilibrium had been too greatly disturbed;\r\nneighboring or rival States had suffered too much; the rancor and\r\ndistrust provoked by the invading revolutionary republic were too\r\nactive; these would have lasted a long time against pacified France even\r\nafter she had concluded reasonable treaties. Even should she abandon a\r\npolicy of propaganda and interference, return brilliant acquisitions,\r\ncease the domination of protectorates, and abandon the disguised\r\nannexation of Italy, Holland, and Switzerland, the nation was still\r\nbound to keep watch under arms. A government able to concentrate all its\r\nforces--that is to say, placed above and beyond all dispute and promptly\r\nobeyed-was indispensable, if only to remain intact and complete, to keep\r\nBelgium and the frontier of the Rhine.--Likewise internally, and for no\r\nother purpose than to restore civil order; for here, too, the\r\noutrages of the Revolution had been too great. There had been too\r\nmuch spoliation, too many imprisonments, exiles, and murders, too many\r\nviolations of every kind, too many invasions of the rights of property\r\nand of persons, public and private. It was so much more difficult\r\n\r\n* To insure respect for persons and all private and public possessions;\r\n\r\n* to restrain at once both Royalists and Jacobins;\r\n\r\n* to restore 140,000 émigrés to their country and yet satisfy 1,200,000\r\npossessors of national property;\r\n\r\n* to give back to 25,000,000 of orthodox Catholics the right, faculty,\r\nand means for worshipping, and yet not allow the schismatic clergy to be\r\nmaltreated;\r\n\r\n* to bring face to face in the same commune the dispossessed seigneur\r\nand the peasant holders of his domain;\r\n\r\n* to compel the delegates of the Committee of Public Safety and their\r\nvictims, the shooters and the shot of Vendémiaire, the Fructidorians and\r\nthe Fructidorized, the Whites and the Blues of La Vendée and Brittany,\r\nto live in peace side by side,\r\n\r\nbecause the future laborers in this immense work, from the village\r\nmayor to the state-senator and state-councilor, had borne a part in\r\nthe Revolution, either in effecting it or under subjection to\r\nit--Monarchists, Feuillantists, Girondists, Montagnards, Thermidorians,\r\nmoderate Jacobins or desperate Jacobins, all oppressed in turn and\r\ndisappointed in their calculations. Their passions, under this régime,\r\nhad become embittered; each brought personal bias and resentment into\r\nthe performance of his duties; to prevent him from being unjust and\r\nmischievous demanded a tightened curb.[2103] All sense of conviction,\r\nunder this régime, had died out; no body would serve gratis as in\r\n1789;[2104] nobody would work without pay; disinterestedness had lost\r\nall charm; ostentatious zeal seemed hypocrisy; genuine zeal seemed\r\nself-dupery; each looked out for himself and not for the community;\r\npublic spirit had yielded to indifference, to egotism, and to the need\r\nof security, of enjoyment, and of self-advancement. Human materials,\r\ndeteriorated by the Revolution, were less than ever suited to providing\r\ncitizens--they simply furnished functionaries. With such wheels combined\r\ntogether according to formula current between 1791 and 1795, the\r\nrequisite work could not possibly be done. As a consequence, definitely\r\nand for a long time, any use of the two great liberal mechanisms were\r\ndoomed. So long as the wheels remained of such poor quality and the\r\ntask so hard, both the election of local powers and the division of the\r\ncentral power had to be abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Motives for suppressing the election of local powers.\r\n\r\n     Motives for suppressing the election of local powers.--The\r\n     Electors.--Their egoism and partiality.--The Elected.--Their\r\n     inertia, corruption, and disobedience.\r\n\r\nAll were agreed on the first point. If any still doubted, they had only\r\nto open their eyes, fix them on the local authorities, watch them\r\nas soon as born, and follow them throughout the exercise of their\r\nfunctions.--Naturally, in filling each office, the electors had chosen\r\na man of their own species and caliber; their fixed and dominant\r\ndisposition was accordingly well known; they were indifferent to public\r\nmatters and therefore their candidate was as indifferent as themselves.\r\nHad they shown too great a concern for the nation this would have\r\nprevented their election; the State to them was a troublesome moralist\r\nand remote creditor. Their candidate must choose between them and this\r\nintruder, side with them against it, and not act as a pedagogue in its\r\nname or as bailiff on its behalf. When power is born on the spot and\r\nconferred to-day by constituents who are to submit to it to-morrow as\r\nsubordinates, they do not put the whip in the hands of one who will\r\nflog them; they demand sentiments of him in conformity with their\r\ninclinations; in any event they will not tolerate in him the opposite\r\nones. From the beginning, this resemblance between them and him is\r\ngreat, and it goes on increasing from day to day because the creature is\r\nalways in the hands of his creators; subject to their daily pressure, he\r\nat last becomes as they are; after a certain period they have shaped him\r\nin their image.--Thus the candidate-elect, from the start or very soon\r\nafter, became a confederate with his electors. At one time, and this\r\noccurred frequently, especially in the towns, he had been elected by a\r\nviolent sectarian minority; he then subordinated general interests\r\nto the interests of a clique. At another, and especially in the rural\r\ndistricts, he had been elected by an ignorant and brutal majority, when\r\nhe accordingly subordinated general interests to those of a village.--If\r\nhe chanced to be conscientious and somewhat intelligent and was anxious\r\nto do his duty, he could not; he felt himself weak and was felt to be\r\nweak;[2105] both authority and the means for exercising it were wanting\r\nin him. He had not the force which a power above communicates to its\r\ndelegates below; nobody saw behind him the government and the army; his\r\nonly resource was a national-guard, which either shirked or refused to\r\ndo its duty, and which often did not exist at all.--On the contrary, he\r\ncould prevaricate, pillage, and persecute for his own advantage and\r\nthat of his clique with impunity; for there was no restraint on him from\r\nabove; the Paris Jacobins would not be disposed to alienate the Jacobins\r\nof the province; they were partisans and allies, and the government\r\nhad few others; it was bound to retain them, to let them intrigue and\r\nembezzle at will.\r\n\r\nSuppose an extensive domain of which the steward is appointed, not by\r\nthe absent owner, but by his tenants, debtors, farmers, and dependents:\r\nthe reader may imagine whether rents will be paid and debts collected,\r\nwhether road-taxes will be worked out, what care will be taken of the\r\nproperty, what its annual income will be to the owner, how abuses of\r\ncommission and omission will be multiplied indefinitely, how great the\r\ndisorder will be, the neglect, the waste, the fraud, the injustice, and\r\nthe license.--The same in France,[2106] and for the same reason:\r\n\r\n* every public service disorganized, destroyed, or perverted;\r\n\r\n* no justice, no police;\r\n\r\n* authorities abstaining from prosecution, magistrates not daring to\r\ncondemn, a gendarmerie which receives no orders or which stands still;\r\n\r\n* rural marauding become a habit;\r\n\r\n* roving bands of brigands in forty-five departments;\r\n\r\n* mail wagons and coaches stopped and pillaged even up to the environs\r\nof Paris;\r\n\r\n* highways broken up and rendered impassable;\r\n\r\n* open smuggling, customs yielding nothing, national forests devastated,\r\nthe public treasury empty,[2107] its revenues intercepted and expended\r\nbefore being deposited, taxes decreed and not collected;\r\n\r\n* everywhere arbitrary assessments of real and personal estate, no less\r\nwicked exemptions than overcharges;\r\n\r\n* in many places no list prepared for tax assessments,\r\n\r\n* communes which here and there, under pretext of defending the republic\r\nagainst neighboring consumers, exempt themselves from both tax and\r\nconscription;\r\n\r\n* conscripts to whom their mayor gives false certificates of infirmity\r\nand marriage, who do not turn out when ordered out, who desert by\r\nhundreds on the way to headquarters, who form mobs and use guns in\r\ndefending themselves against the troops,--such were the fruits of the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe government could not constrain rural majorities with the officials\r\nchosen by the selfish and inept rural majorities. Neither could it\r\nrepress the urban minorities with agents elected by the same partial\r\nand corrupt urban minorities. Hands are necessary, and hands as firm as\r\ntenacious, to seize conscripts by the collar, to rummage the pockets\r\nof taxpayers, and the State did not have such hands. They were required\r\nright away, if only to prepare and provide for urgent needs. If the\r\nwestern departments had to be subdued and tranquilized, relief furnished\r\nto Massena besieged in Genoa, Mélas prevented from invading Provence,\r\nMoreau's army transported over the Rhine, the first thing was to restore\r\nto the central government the appointment of local authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Reasons for centralization.\r\n\r\n     Reasons for placing the executive central power in one\r\n     hand.--Sieyès' chimerical combinations.--Bonaparte's\r\n     objections.\r\n\r\nOn this second point, the evidence was scarcely less.--And clearly, the\r\nmoment the local powers owed their appointment to the central powers, it\r\nis plain that the central executive power, on which they depend, should\r\nbe unique. For, this great team of functionaries, driven from aloft,\r\ncould not have aloft several distinct drivers; being several and\r\ndistinct, the drivers would each pull his own way, while the horses,\r\npulling in opposite directions, would do nothing but prance. In this\r\nrespect the combinations of Sieyès do not bear examination. A mere\r\ntheorist and charged with preparing the plan of a new constitution,\r\nhe had reasoned as if the drivers on the box were not men, but robots:\r\nperched above all, a grand-elector, a show sovereign, with two places\r\nto dispose of and always passive, except to appoint or revoke two active\r\nsovereigns, the two governing consuls. One, a peace-consul, appointing\r\nall civil officers, and the other a war-consul, making all military and\r\ndiplomatic appointments; each with his own ministers, his own council of\r\nstate, his own court of judicature. All these functionaries, ministers,\r\nconsuls, and the grand-elector himself, were revocable at the will of\r\na senate which from day to day could absorb them, that is to say,\r\nmake them senators with a salary of 30,000 francs and an embroidered\r\ndress-coat.[2108] Sieyès evidently had not taken into account either the\r\nwork to be done or the men who would have to do it, while Bonaparte,\r\nwho was doing the work at this very time, who understood men and who\r\nunderstood himself, at once put his finger on the weak spot of this\r\ncomplex mechanism, so badly adjusted and so frail. Two consuls,[2109]\r\n\"one controlling the ministers of justice, of the interior, of the\r\npolice, of the treasury, and the other the ministers of war, of the\r\nnavy, and of foreign affairs.\" The conflict between them is certain;\r\nlook at them facing each other, subject to contrary influences and\r\nsuggestions: around the former \"only judges, administrators, financiers,\r\nand men in long robes,\" and round the latter \"only epaulets and men of\r\nthe sword.\" Certainly \"one will need money and recruits for his army\r\nwhich the other will not grant.\"--And it is not your grand-elector who\r\nwill make them agree. \"If he conforms strictly to the functions which\r\nyou assign to him he will be the mere ghost, the fleshless phantom of\r\na roi fainéant. Do you know any man vile enough to take part in such\r\ncontrivances? How can you imagine any man of talent or at all honorable\r\ncontentedly playing the part of a hog fattening himself on a few\r\nmillions?\"--And all the more because if he wants to abandon his part\r\nthe door stands open. \"Were I the grand-elector I would say to the\r\nwar-consul and to the peace-consul on appointing them, If you put in a\r\nminister or sign a bill I don't like I'll put you out.\" Thus does the\r\ngrand-elector become an active, absolute monarch.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" you may say, \"the senate in its turn will absorb the\r\ngrand-elector.\"--\"The remedy is worse than the disease; nobody,\r\naccording to this plan, has any guarantees,\" and each, therefore, will\r\ntry to secure them to himself, the grand-elector against the senate,\r\nthe consuls against the grand-elector, and the senate against the\r\ngrand-elector and consuls combined, each uneasy, alarmed, threatened,\r\nthreatening, and usurping to protect himself; these are the wheels\r\nwhich work the wrong way, in a machine constantly getting out of order,\r\nstopping, and finally breaking down entirely.\r\n\r\nThereupon, and as Bonaparte, moreover, was already master, all the\r\nexecutive powers were reduced to one, and this power was vested in\r\nhim.[2110] In reality, \"to humor republican opinion\"[2111] they gave him\r\ntwo associates with the same title as his own; but they were appointed\r\nonly for show, simply as consulting, inferior, and docile registrars,\r\nwith no rights save that of signing their names after his and putting\r\ntheir signatures to the procès verbal declaring his orders; he alone\r\ncommanded, \"he alone had the say, he alone appointed to all offices,\" so\r\nthat they were already subjects as he alone was already the sovereign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Irreconcilable divisions.\r\n\r\n     Difficulty of organizing a legislative power.--Fraudulent\r\n     and violent elections for ten years.--Spirit and diffusion\r\n     of hatred against the men and dogmas of the Revolution.\r\n     --Probable composition of a freely elected Assembly.--Its two\r\n     irreconcilable divisions.--Sentiments of the army.\r\n     --Proximity and probable meaning of a new coup d'État.\r\n\r\nIt remained to frame a legislative power as a counterpoise to this\r\nexecutive power, so concentrated and so strong.--In organized and\r\ntolerably sound communities this point is reached through an elective\r\nparliament which represents the public will; it represents this because\r\nit is a copy, a faithful reduction of that will on a small scale; it\r\nis so organized as to present a loyal and proportionate expression of\r\ndiverse controlling opinions. In this case, the electoral selection has\r\nworked well; one superior right, that of election, has been respected,\r\nor, in other words, the passions excited have not proved too strong,\r\nwhich is owing to the most important interests not having proved too\r\ndivergent.--Unfortunately, in France, rent asunder and discordant, all\r\nthe most important interests were in sharp antagonism; the passions\r\nbrought into play, consequently, were furious; no right was respected,\r\nand least of all that of election; hence the electoral test worked\r\nbadly, and no elected parliament was or could be a veritable expression\r\nof the public will. Since 1791, the elections, violated and deserted,\r\nhad brought intruders only to the legislative benches, under the name of\r\nmandatories. These were endured for lack of better; but nobody had any\r\nconfidence in them, and nobody showed them any deference. People knew\r\nhow they had been elected and how little their title was worth. Through\r\ninertness, fear, or disgust, the great majority of electors had not\r\nvoted, while the voters at the polls fought among themselves, the\r\nstrongest or least scrupulous expelling or constraining the rest. During\r\nthe last three years of the Directory the electoral assembly was often\r\ndivided; each faction elected its own deputy and protested against\r\nthe election of the other. The government then chose between the two\r\ncandidates elected, arbitrarily and always with barefaced partiality;\r\nand again, if but one candidate was elected, and that one an adversary,\r\nhis election was invalidated. In sum, for nine years, the legislative\r\nbody, imposed on the nation by a faction, was scarcely more legitimate\r\nthan the executive power, another usurper, and which, later on, filled\r\nup or purged its ranks. Any remedy for this defect in the electoral\r\nmachine was impossible; it was due to its internal structure, to the\r\nvery quality of its materials. At this date, even under an impartial and\r\nstrong government, the machine could not have answered its purpose,\r\nthat of deriving from the nation a body of sober-minded and respected\r\ndelegates, providing France with a parliament capable of playing its own\r\npart, or any part whatever, in the conduct of public business.\r\n\r\nFor, suppose\r\n\r\n* that the new governors show uncommon loyalty, energy, and vigilance,\r\nremarkable political abnegation and administrative omnipresence,\r\n\r\n* that the factions are contained without suppression of free speech,\r\n\r\n* the central powers neutral yet active,\r\n\r\n* no official candidature,\r\n\r\n* no pressure from above,\r\n\r\n* no constraint from below,\r\n\r\n* the police-commissioners respectful and gendarmes protecting the\r\nentrance to every electoral assembly,\r\n\r\n* all proceedings regular, no disturbance inside, voting perfectly free,\r\nthe electors numerous, five or six millions of Frenchmen gathered at the\r\npolls,\r\n\r\nand guess what choice they will make.\r\n\r\nAfter Fructidor, there is a renewal of religious persecution and of\r\nexcessive civil oppression; the brutality and unworthiness of the rulers\r\nhave doubled and diffused hatred against the men and the ideas of the\r\nRevolution.--In Belgium, recently annexed, the regular and secular\r\nclergy had just been proscribed in a mass,[2112] and a great rural\r\ninsurrection had broken out. The uprising had spread from the Waes\r\ncountry and the ancient seignory of Malines, around Louvain as far as\r\nTirlemont, and afterward to Brussels, to Campine, to South Brabant, to\r\nFlanders, to Luxembourg, in the Ardennes, and even to the frontiers of\r\nLiège; many villages had to be burned, and many of their inhabitants\r\nkilled, and the survivors keep this in mind. In the twelve western\r\ndepartments,[2113] at the beginning of the year 1800, the royalists were\r\nmasters of nearly the whole country and had control of forty thousand\r\narmed men in regimental order; undoubtedly these were to be overcome\r\nand disarmed, but they were not to be deprived of their opinions, as\r\nof their guns.--In the month of August, 1799,[2114] sixteen thousand\r\ninsurgents in Haute Garonne and the six neighboring departments, led by\r\nCount de Paulo, had unfurled the royal white flag; one of the cantons,\r\nCadours, \"had risen almost entirely;\" a certain town, Muret, sent\r\nall its able-bodied men. They had penetrated even to the outskirts of\r\nToulouse, and several engagements, including a pitched battle, were\r\nnecessary to subdue them. On one occasion, at Montréjean, 2000 were\r\nslain or drowned. The peasants fought with fury, \"a fury that bordered\r\non frenzy;\" \"some were heard to exclaim with their last breath, 'Vive\r\nle Roi!' and others were cut to pieces rather than shout, 'Vive la\r\nRépublique!'\"--From Marseilles to Lyons the revolt lasted five years\r\non both banks of the Rhône, under the form of brigandage; the royalist\r\nbands, increased by refractory conscripts and favored by the inhabitants\r\nwhom they spared, killed or pillaged the agents of the republic and\r\nthe buyers of national possessions.[2115] There were thus, in more\r\nthan thirty departments, intermittent and scattered Vendées. In all the\r\nCatholic departments there was a latent Vendée. Had the elections been\r\nfree during this state of exasperation it is probable that one-half\r\nof France would have voted for men of the ancient régime--Catholics,\r\nRoyalists, or, at least, the Monarchists of 1790.\r\n\r\nLet the reader imagine facing this party, in the same chamber, about\r\nan equal number of representatives elected by the other party; the only\r\nones it could select, its notables, that is to say, the survivors of\r\npreceding assemblies, probably Constitutionalists of the year IV and\r\nthe year V, Conventionalists of the Plain and of the Feuillants of 1792,\r\nfrom Lafayette and Dumolard to Daunou, Thibaudeau and Grégoire, among\r\nthem Girondists and a few Montagnards, Barère,[2116] with others, all of\r\nthem wedded to the theory the same as their adversaries to traditions.\r\nTo one who is familiar with the two groups, behold two inimical\r\ndoctrines confronting each other; two irreconcilable systems of opinions\r\nand passions, two contradictory modes of conceiving sovereignty, law,\r\nsociety, the State, property, religion, the Church, the ancient régime,\r\nthe Revolution, the present and the past; it is civil war transferred\r\nfrom the nation to the parliament. Certainly the Right would like to see\r\nthe First Consul a Monck, which would lead to his becoming a Cromwell;\r\nfor his power depends entirely on his credit with the army, then the\r\nsovereign force; at this date the army is still republican, at least in\r\nfeeling if not intelligently, imbued with Jacobin prejudices, attached\r\nto revolutionary interests, and hence blindly hostile to aristocrats,\r\nkings, and priests.[2117] At the first threat of a monarchical\r\nand Catholic restoration it will demand of him an eighteenth\r\nFructidor[2118]; otherwise, some Jacobin general, Jourdan, Bernadotte,\r\nor Augereau, will make one without him, against him, and they fall back\r\ninto the rut from which they wished to escape, into the fatal circle of\r\nrevolutions and coups d'état.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Establishment of a new Dictatorship.\r\n\r\n     The electoral and legislative combinations of Sieyès.\r\n     --Bonaparte's use of them.--Paralysis and submission of the\r\n     three legislative bodies.--The Senate as the ruler's tool.\r\n     --Senatus-consultes and Plebiscites.--Final establishment of\r\n     the Dictatorship.--Its dangers and necessity.--Public power\r\n     now able to do its work.\r\n\r\nSieyès comprehended this: he detects on the horizon the two specters\r\nwhich, for ten years, have haunted all the governments of France, legal\r\nanarchy and unstable despotism; he has found a magic formula with which\r\nto exorcise these two phantoms; henceforth \"power is to come from above\r\nand confidence from below.\"[2119]--Consequently, the new constitutional\r\nact withdraws from the nation the right to elect its deputies; it will\r\nsimply elect candidates to the deputation and through three degrees of\r\nelection, one above the other; thus, it is to take part in the choice\r\nof its candidates only through \"an illusory and metaphysical\r\nparticipation.\"[2120] The right of the electors of the first degree is\r\nwholly reduced to designating one-tenth among themselves; the right\r\nof those of the second degree is also reduced to designating one-tenth\r\namong themselves; the right of those of the third degree is finally\r\nreduced to designating one-tenth of their number, about six thousand\r\ncandidates. On this list, the government itself, by right and by way of\r\nincreasing the number, inscribes its own high functionaries; evidently,\r\non such a long list, it will have no difficulty in finding men who,\r\nas simple tools, will be devoted to it. Through another excess of\r\nprecaution, the government, on its sole authority, in the absence of any\r\nlist, alone names the first legislature. Last of all, it is careful to\r\nattach handsome salaries to these legislative offices, 10,000 f., 15,000\r\nf., and 30,000 f. a year; parties canvass with it for these places the\r\nvery first day, the future depositaries of legislative power being, to\r\nbegin with, solicitors of the antechamber.--To render their docility\r\ncomplete, there is a dismemberment of this legislative power in\r\nadvance; it is divided among three bodies, born feeble and passive by\r\ninstitution. Neither of these has any initiative; their deliberations\r\nare confined to laws proposed by the government. Each possesses only a\r\nfragment of function; the \"Tribunat\" discusses without passing laws, the\r\n\"Corps Législatif\" decrees without discussion, the conservative\"\r\nSénat\" is to maintain this general paralysis. \"What do you want?\" said\r\nBonaparte to Lafayette.[2121] \"Sieyès everywhere put nothing but ghosts,\r\nthe ghost of a legislative power, the ghost of a judiciary, the ghost\r\nof a government. Something substantial had to be put in their place. Ma\r\nfoi, I put it there,\" in the executive power.\r\n\r\nThere it is, completely in his hands; other authorities to him are\r\nmerely for show or as instruments.[2122] The mutes of the Corps\r\nLégislatif come annually to Paris to keep silent for four months;\r\none day he will forget to convoke them, and nobody will remark their\r\nabsence.--As to the Tribunat, which talks too much, he will at first\r\nreduce its words to a minimum \"by putting it on the diet of laws;\"\r\nafterward, through the interposition of the senate, which designates\r\nretiring members, he gets rid of troublesome babblers; finally, and\r\nalways through the interposition of the senate, titular interpreter,\r\nguardian, and reformer of the constitution, he ventilates and then\r\nsuppresses the Tribunat itself.--The senate is the grand instrument\r\nby which he reigns; he commands it to furnish the senatus-consultes of\r\nwhich he has need. Through this comedy played by him above, and through\r\nanother complementary comedy which he plays below, the plebiscite, he\r\ntransforms his ten-year consulate into a consulate for life, and then\r\ninto an empire, that is to say, into a permanent, legal, full, and\r\nperfect dictatorship. In this way the nation is handed over to the\r\nabsolutism of a man who, being a man, cannot fail to think of his own\r\ninterest before all others. It remains to be seen how far and for how\r\nlong a time this interest, as he comprehends it, or imagines it, will\r\naccord with the interest of the public. All the better for France should\r\nthis accord prove complete and permanent; all the worse for France\r\nshould it prove partial and temporary. It is a terrible risk, but\r\ninevitable. There is no escape from anarchy except through despotism,\r\nwith the chance of encountering in one man, at first a savior and then a\r\ndestroyer, with the certainty of henceforth belonging to an unknown will\r\nfashioned by genius and good sense, or by imagination and egoism, in\r\na soul fiery and disturbed by the temptations of absolute power, by\r\nsuccess and universal adulation, in a despot responsible to no one but\r\nhimself, in a conqueror condemned by the impulses of conquest to regard\r\nhimself and the world under a light growing falser and falser.\r\n\r\nSuch are the bitter fruits of social dissolution: the authority of the\r\nstate will either perish or become perverted; each uses it for his\r\nown purposes, and nobody is disposed to entrust it to an external\r\narbitrator, and the usurpers who seize it only remain trustee on\r\ncondition that they abuse it; when it works in their hands it is only to\r\nwork against its office. It must be accepted when, for want of better or\r\nfear of worse, through a final usurpation, it falls into the only hands\r\nable to restore it, organize it, and apply it at last to the service of\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2101: \"The Revolution,\" P.193 and following pages, also p.224\r\nand following pages.

PUBLIC POWER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Principal service rendered by the public power.\r\n\r\n     Principal service rendered by the public power.--It is an\r\n     instrumentality.--A common law for every instrumentality.\r\n     --Mechanical instruments.--Physiological instruments.--Social\r\n     instruments.--The perfection of an instrument increases with\r\n     the convergence of its effects.\r\n\r\nWhat is the service which the public power renders to the public?--The\r\nprincipal one is the protection of the community against the foreigner,\r\nand of private individuals against each other.--Evidently, to do this,\r\nit must in all cases be provided with indispensable means, namely:\r\ndiplomats, an army, a fleet, arsenals, civil and criminal courts,\r\nprisons, a police, taxation and tax-collectors, a hierarchy of agents\r\nand local supervisors, who, each in his place and attending to\r\nhis special duty, will co-operate in securing the desired\r\neffect.--Evidently, again, to apply all these instruments, the\r\npublic power must have, according to the case, this or that form or\r\nconstitution, this or that degree of impulse and energy: according to\r\nthe nature and gravity of external or internal danger, it is proper that\r\nit should be concentrated or divided, emancipated from control or under\r\ncontrol, authoritative or liberal. No indignation need be cherished\r\nbeforehand against its mechanism. Strictly speaking, it is a vast piece\r\nappliance in the human community, such as a machine in a factory or such\r\nas organ in the human body. If this organ is the only on that can carry\r\nout the task, let us accept it and its structure: whoever wants the end\r\nwants the means. All we can ask is that the means shall be adapted to\r\nthe end; in other terms, that the myriad of large or small local or\r\ncentral pieces shall be determined, adjusted, and coordinated in view of\r\nthe final and total effect to which they co-operate nearly or remotely.\r\n\r\nBut, whether simple or compound, every engine which does any work\r\nis subject to one condition; the better it is suited to any distinct\r\npurpose the less it is suited to other purposes; as its perfection\r\nincreases, so does its application become limited.--Accordingly, if\r\nthere are two distinct instruments applied to two distinct objects,\r\nthe more perfect they are, each of its kind, the more do their domains\r\nbecome circumscribed and opposed to each other; as one of them becomes\r\nmore capable of doing its own work it becomes more incapable of doing\r\nthe work of the other; finally, neither can take the place of the\r\nother, and this is true whatever the instrument may be, mechanical,\r\nphysiological, or social.\r\n\r\nAt the very lowest grade of human industry the savage possesses but one\r\ntool; with his cutting or pointed bit of stone he kills, breaks, splits,\r\nbores, saws, and carves; the instrument suffices, in the main, for all\r\nsorts of services. After this come the lance, the hatchet, the hammer,\r\nthe punch, the saw, the knife, each adapted to a distinct purpose and\r\nless efficacious outside of that purpose: one cannot saw well with a\r\nknife, and one cuts badly with a saw. Later, highly-perfected engines\r\nappear, and, wholly special, the sewing-machine and the typewriter:\r\nit is impossible to sew with the typewriter or write with the\r\nsewing-machine.--In like manner, when at the lowest round of the organic\r\nladder the animal is simply a shapeless jelly, homogeneous and viscous,\r\nall parts of it are equally suited to all functions; the amoebae,\r\nindifferently and by all the cells of its body, can walk, seize,\r\nswallow, digest, breathe, and circulate all its fluids, expel its waste,\r\nand propagate its species. A little higher up, in fresh-water polyp, the\r\ninternal sac which digests and the outer skin which serves to envelop\r\nit can, if absolutely necessary, change their functions; if you turn the\r\nanimal inside out like a glove it continues to live; its skin, become\r\ninternal, fulfills the office of a stomach; its stomach, become\r\nexternal, fulfills the office of an envelope. But, the higher we ascend,\r\nthe more do the organs, complicated by the division and subdivision of\r\nlabor, diverge, each to its own side, and refuse to take each other's\r\nplace. The heart, with the mammal, is only good for impelling the blood,\r\nwhile the lungs only furnish the blood with oxygen; one cannot possibly\r\ndo the work of the other; between the two domains the special structure\r\nof the former and the special structure of the latter interpose an\r\nimpassable barrier.--In like manner, finally, at the very bottom of the\r\nsocial scale--lower down than the Andamans and the Fuegians--we find a\r\nprimitive stage of humanity in which society consists wholly of a herd.\r\nIn this herd there is no distinct association in view of a distinct\r\npurpose; there is not even a family--no permanent tie between male and\r\nfemale; there is simply a contact of the sexes. Gradually, in this\r\nherd of individuals, all equal and all alike, particular groups define\r\nthemselves, take shape, and separate: we see appearing more and more\r\nprecise relationships, more and more distinct habitations, more and\r\nmore hereditary homesteads, fishing, hunting, and war groups, and\r\nsmall workshops; if the people is a conquering people, castes establish\r\nthemselves. At length, we find in this expanded and solidly-organized\r\nsocial body provinces, communes, churches, hospitals, schools, corporate\r\nbodies and associations of every species and dimension, temporary or\r\npermanent, voluntary or involuntary, in brief, a multitude of social\r\nengines constructed out of human beings who, on account of personal\r\ninterest, habit, and constraint, or through inclination, conscience,\r\nand generosity, co-operate according to a public or tacit statute in\r\neffecting in the material or spiritual order of things this or that\r\ndeterminate undertaking. In France, to-day, there are, besides the\r\nState, eighty-six departments, thirty-six thousand communes, four church\r\nbodies, forty thousand parishes, seven or eight millions of families,\r\nmillions of agricultural, industrial, and commercial establishments,\r\nhundreds of institutions of science and art, thousands of educational\r\nand charitable institutions, benevolent and mutual-aid societies, and\r\nothers for business or for pleasure by tens and hundreds and thousands,\r\nin short, innumerable associations of every kind, each with a purpose\r\nof its own, and, like a tool or a special organ, carrying out a distinct\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nNow, each of these associations so far as it is a tool or an organ is\r\nsubject to the same law; the better it is in one direction, the more\r\nmediocre it is in other directions; its special competency constitutes\r\nits general incompetence. This is why, among developed nations, no\r\nspecialized organization can replace another in a satisfactory manner.\r\n\"An academy of painting which should also be a bank would, in all\r\nprobability, exhibit very bad pictures and discount very bad bills. A\r\ngas company which should also be a kindergarten would, we expect, light\r\nthe streets poorly and teach the children badly.\" [2201] And the\r\nreason is that an instrument, whatever it may be, a mechanical tool, or\r\nphysiological organ, or human association, is always a system of pieces\r\nwhose effects converge to a given end; it matters little whether the\r\npieces are bits of wood and metal, as in the tool, cells and fibers,\r\nas in the organ, souls and understandings, as in the association;\r\nthe essential thing is the convergence of their effects; for the more\r\nconvergent these effects, the more efficient is the instrument in the\r\nrealization of its end. But, through this convergence, it takes one\r\ndirection exclusively and cannot take any other; it cannot operate at\r\nonce in two different senses; it cannot possibly turn to the right and\r\nat the same time turn to the left. If any social instrument devised\r\nfor a special service is made to act additionally for another, it will\r\nperform its own office badly as well the one it usurps. Of the two works\r\nexecuted by it, the first injures the second and the second injures the\r\nfirst one. The end, ordinarily, is the sacrifice of one to the other,\r\nand, most frequently, the failure of both.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Abusive Government Intervention.\r\n\r\n     Application of this law to the public power.--General effect\r\n     of its intervention.\r\n\r\nLet us follow out the effects of this law when it is the public power\r\nwhich, beyond its principal and peculiar task, undertakes a different\r\ntask and puts itself in the place of corporate bodies to do their\r\nwork; when the State, not content with protecting the community and\r\nindividuals against external or internal oppression, takes upon itself\r\nadditionally the government of churches, education, or charity, the\r\ndirection of art, science, and of commercial, agricultural, municipal,\r\nor domestic affairs.--Undoubtedly, it can intervene in all corporate\r\nbodies other than itself; it has both the right and the duty to\r\ninterfere; it is bound to do this through its very office as defender\r\nof persons and property, to repress in these bodies spoliation and\r\noppression, to compel in them the observance of the primordial statute,\r\ncharter, or contract, to maintain in the them rights of each member\r\nfixed by this statute, to decide according to this statute all conflicts\r\nwhich may arise between administrators and the administrated, between\r\ndirectors and stockholders, between pastors and parishioners, between\r\ndeceased founders and their living successors. In doing this, it affords\r\nthem its tribunals, its constables, and its gendarmes, and it affords\r\nthese to them only with full consent after having looking into and\r\naccepted the statute. This, too, is one of the obligations of its\r\noffice: its mandate hinders it from placing the public power at the\r\nservice of despoiling and oppressive enterprises; it is interdicted from\r\nauthorizing a contract for prostitution or slavery, and above all, for\r\nthe best of reasons, a society for brigandage and insurrections, an\r\narmed league, or ready to arm itself, against the community, or a part\r\nof the community, or against itself.--But, between this legitimate\r\nintervention which enables it to maintain rights, and the abusive\r\ninterference by which it usurps rights, the limit is visible and it\r\noversteps this limit when, to its function of justiciary, it adds a\r\nsecond, that of governing or supporting another corporation. In this\r\ncase two series of abuses unfold themselves; on the one side, the State\r\nacts contrary to its primary office, and, on the other, it discharges\r\nthe duties of its superadded office badly.[2202]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. The State attacks persons and property.\r\n\r\n     It acts against its function. Its encroachments are attacks\r\n     on persons and property.\r\n\r\nFor, in the first place, to govern another corporate body, for example\r\nthe Church, the State at one time appoints its ecclesiastical heads, as\r\nunder the old monarchy after the abolition of the Pragmatic Sanction by\r\nthe Concordat of 1516; at another, as with the Constituent Assembly in\r\n1791, without appointing its heads, it invents a new mode of appointment\r\nby imposing on the Church a discipline contrary to its spirit and even\r\nto its dogmas. Sometimes it goes further still and reduces a special\r\nbody into a mere administrative branch, transforming its heads into\r\nrevocable functionaries whose acts it orders and directs; such under\r\nthe Empire as well as under the Restoration, were the mayor and\r\ncommon-councilors in a commune, and the professors and head-masters of\r\nthe University. One step more and the invasion is complete: naturally,\r\neither through ambition or precaution, or through theory or prejudice,\r\non undertaking a new service it is tempted to reserve to itself or\r\ndelegate its monopoly. Before 1789 there existed one of these monopolies\r\nto the advantage of the Catholic Church, through the interdiction of\r\nother cults, also another to the advantage of each corporation of \"Arts\r\net Métiers,\" through the interdiction of free labor; after 1800, there\r\nexisted one for the benefit of the University through all sorts of\r\nshackles and constraints imposed on the establishment and maintenance\r\nof private schools.--Now, through each of these constraints the State\r\nencroaches on the domain of the individual; the more extended its\r\nencroachments the more does it prey upon and reduce the circle of\r\nspontaneous initiation and of independent action, which constitute the\r\ntrue life of the individual; if, in conformity with the Jacobin program,\r\nit pushes its interference to the end, it absorbs in itself all other\r\nlives;[2203] henceforth, the community consists only of automata\r\nmaneuvered from above, infinitely small residues of men, passive,\r\nmutilated, and, so to say, dead souls; the State, instituted to preserve\r\npersons, has reduced them to nonentities.\r\n\r\nThe effect is the same with property when the State supports other\r\norganizations than its own. For, to maintain these, it has no other\r\nfunds than those of the taxpayers; consequently, using its collectors,\r\nit takes the money out of their pockets; all, indiscriminately,\r\nwillingly or not, pay supplementary taxes for supplementary services,\r\nwhether this service benefits them or is repugnant to them. If I am a\r\nProtestant in a Catholic State, or a Catholic in a Protestant State, I\r\npay for religion which seems wrong to me and for a Church which seems\r\nto me mischievous. If I am a skeptic, a free-thinker, indifferent or\r\nhostile to positive religions in France, I pay to-day for the support of\r\nfour cults which I regard as useless or pernicious. If I am a provincial\r\nor a peasant, I pay for maintaining an \"Opéra\" which I never attend and\r\nfor a \"Sèvres\" and \"Gobelins\" of which I never see a vase or a piece of\r\ntapestry.--In times of tranquility the extortion is covered up, but\r\nin troubled times it is nakedly apparent. Under the revolutionary\r\ngovernment, bands of collectors armed with pikes made raids on villages\r\nas in conquered countries;[2204] the farmer, collared and kept down by\r\nblows from the butt end of a musket, sees his grain taken from his barn\r\nand his cattle from their stable; \"all scampered off on the road to\r\nthe town;\" while around Paris, within a radius of forty leagues, the\r\ndepartments fasted in order that the capital might be fed. With gentler\r\nformalities, under a regular government, a similar extortion occurs when\r\nthe State, employing a respectable collector in uniform, takes from our\r\npurse a crown too much for an office outside of its competency. If,\r\nas with the Jacobin State, it claims all offices, it empties the purse\r\nentirely; instituted for the conservation of property, it confiscates\r\nthe whole of it.--Thus, with property, as with persons, when the state\r\nproposes to itself another purpose than the preservation of these, not\r\nonly does it overstep its mandate but it acts contrary to its mandate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Abuse of State powers.\r\n\r\n     It badly fills the office of the bodies it supplant.--Cases\r\n     in which it usurps their powers and refuses to be their\r\n     substitute.--Cases in which it violates or profits by their\r\n     mechanism.--In all cases it is bad or mediocre substitute.\r\n     --Reasons derived from its structure compared with that of\r\n     other bodies.\r\n\r\nLet us consider the other series of abuses, and the way in which the\r\nState performs the service of the corporate bodies it supplants.\r\n\r\nIn the first place there is a chance that, sooner or later, it will\r\nshirk this work, for this new service is more or less costly, and,\r\nsooner or later, it seems too costly.--Undoubtedly the State has\r\npromised to defray expenses; sometimes even, like the Constituent and\r\nLegislative assemblies, the revenues for this having been confiscated,\r\nit has to furnish an equivalent; it is bound by contract to make good\r\nthe local or special sources of revenue which it has appropriated\r\nor dried up, to furnish in exchange a supply of water from the grand\r\ncentral reservoir, the public treasury.--But if water becomes low in\r\nthis reservoir, if the taxes in arrears stop the regular supply, if\r\na war happens to open a large breach in it, if the prodigality and\r\nincapacity of the rulers, multiply its fissures and leaks, then there is\r\nno money on hand for accessory and secondary services. The State, which\r\nhas adopted this service drops it: we have seen under the Convention\r\nand the Directory how, having taken the property of all corporations,\r\nprovinces, and communes, of institutions of education, art, and science,\r\nof churches, hospitals, and asylums, it performed their functions; how,\r\nafter having been a despoiler and a robber, it became insolvent and\r\nbankrupt; how its usurpation and bankruptcy ruined and then destroyed\r\nall other services; how, through the double effect of its intervention\r\nand desertion, it annihilated in France education, worship, and charity;\r\nwhy the streets in the towns were no longer lighted nor swept; why, in\r\nthe provinces, roads went to decay, and dikes crumbled; why schools\r\nand churches stood empty or were closed; why, in the asylum and in\r\nthe hospital, foundlings died for lack of milk, the infirm for lack\r\nof clothing and food, and the sick for lack of broth, medicines, and\r\nbeds.[2205]\r\n\r\nIn the second place, even when the State respects a service or provides\r\nthe means for it, there is a chance that it will pervert this simply\r\nbecause it comes under its direction.--When rulers lay their hands on an\r\ninstitution it is almost always for the purpose of making something\r\nout of it for their own advantage and to its detriment: they render\r\neverything subordinate to their interests or theories, they put some\r\nessential piece or wheel out of shape or place; they derange its action\r\nand put the mechanism out of order; they make use of it as a\r\nfiscal, electoral, or doctrinal engine, as a reigning or sectarian\r\ninstrument.--Such, in the eighteenth century, was the ecclesiastical\r\nstaff with which we are familiar,[2206] court bishops, drawing-room\r\nabbés imposed from above on their diocese or their abbey, non-residents,\r\ncharged with functions which they do not fulfill, largely-paid idlers,\r\nparasites of the Church, and, besides all this, worldly, gallant, often\r\nunbelievers, strange leaders of a Christian clergy and which, one would\r\nsay, were expressly selected to undermine Catholic faith in the minds\r\nof their flocks, or monastic discipline in their convents.--Such,\r\nin 1791,[2207] is the new constitutional clergy, schismatic,\r\nexcommunicated, interlopers, imposed on the orthodox majority to say\r\nmasses which they deem sacrilegious and to administer sacraments which\r\nthey refuse to accept.\r\n\r\nIn the last place, even when the rulers do not subordinate the interests\r\nof the institution to their passions, to their theories, or to their own\r\ninterests, even when they avoid mutilating it and changing its\r\nnature, even when they loyally fulfill, as well as they know how,\r\nthe supererogatory (distributive) mandate which they have adjudged to\r\nthemselves, they infallibly fulfill it badly, at least worse than the\r\nspecial and spontaneous bodies for which they substitute themselves,\r\nfor the structure of these bodies and the structure of the state are\r\ndifferent.--Unique of its kind, alone wielding the sword, acting from\r\nabove and afar by authority and constraints, the State acts over the\r\nentire territory through uniform laws, through imperative and minute\r\nregulations, by a hierarchy of obedient functionaries, which it\r\nmaintains under strict instructions. Hence, it is not adapted to\r\nbusiness which, to be well done, needs springs and processes of another\r\nspecies. Its springs, wholly exterior, are insufficient, too weak to\r\nsupport and push undertakings which require an internal motor like\r\nprivate interest, local patriotism, family affections, scientific\r\ncuriosity, charitable instincts, and religious faith. Its wholly\r\nmechanical processes, too rigid and too limited, cannot urge on\r\nenterprises which demand of whoever undertakes them delicate and safe\r\nhandling, supple manipulation, appreciation of circumstances, ready\r\nadaptation of means to ends, constant contrivance, the initiative, and\r\nperfect independence. On this account the State is a poor head of a\r\nfamily, a poor commercial or agricultural leader, a bad distributor of\r\nlabor and of subsistence, a bad regulator of production, exchanges, and\r\nconsumption, a mediocre administrator of the province and the commune,\r\nan undiscerning philanthropist, an incompetent director of the fine\r\narts, of science, of instruction, and of worship.[2208] In all these\r\noffices its action is either dilatory or bungling, according to routine\r\nor oppressive, always expensive, of little effect and feeble in returns,\r\nand always beyond or apart from the real wants it pretends to satisfy.\r\nThe reason is that it starts from too high a point therefore extending\r\nover too vast a field. Transmitted by hierarchical procedures, it lags\r\nalong in formalism, and loses itself in \"red-tape.\" On attaining its\r\nend and object it applies the same program to all territories alike\r\na program devised beforehand in the Cabinet, all of a piece, without\r\nexperimental groping and the necessary corrections;\r\n\r\n* a program which, calculated approximately according to the average and\r\nthe customary, is not exactly suited to any particular case;\r\n\r\n* a program which imposes its fixed uniformity on things instead of\r\nadjusting itself to its diversity and change;\r\n\r\n* a sort of model coat, obligatory in pattern and stuff, which the\r\ngovernment dispatches by thousands from the center to the provinces, to\r\nbe worn, willingly or not, by figures of all sizes and at all seasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Final Results of Abusive Government Intervention\r\n\r\n     Other consequences.--Suppressed or stunted bodies cease to\r\n     grow.--Individuals become socially and politically\r\n     incapable.--The hands into which public power then falls.\r\n     --Impoverishment and degradation of the social body.\r\n\r\nAnd much worse. Not only does the State do the work badly on a domain\r\nnot its own, roughly, at greater cost, and with smaller yield than\r\nspontaneous organizations, but, again, through the legal monopoly which\r\nit deems its prerogative, or through its unfair competition, it kills\r\nand paralyzes these natural organizations or prevents their birth; and\r\nhence so many precious organs, which, absorbed, curbed or abandoned, are\r\nlost to the great social body.--And still worse, if this system lasts,\r\nand continues to crush them out, the human community loses the faculty\r\nof reproducing them; entirely extirpated, they do not grow again;\r\neven their germ has perished. Individuals no longer know how to form\r\nassociations, how to co-operate under their own impulses, through their\r\nown initiative, free of outside and superior constraint, all together\r\nand for a long time in view of a definite purpose, according to regular\r\nforms under freely-chosen chiefs, frankly accepted and faithfully\r\nfollowed. Mutual confidence, respect for the law, loyalty, voluntary\r\nsubordination, foresight, moderation, patience, perseverance, practical\r\ngood sense, every disposition of head and heart, with which no\r\nassociation of any kind is efficacious or even viable, have died out\r\nfor lack of exercise. Henceforth spontaneous, pacific, and fruitful\r\nco-operation, as practiced by a free people, is unattainable; men\r\nhave arrived at social incapacity and, consequently, at political\r\nincapacity.--In fact they no longer choose their own constitution or\r\ntheir own rulers; they put with these, willingly or not, according as\r\naccident or usurpation furnishes them: now the public power belongs\r\nto the man, the faction, or the party sufficiently unscrupulous,\r\nsufficiently daring, sufficiently violent, to seize and hold on to it\r\nby force, to make the most of it as an egotist or charlatan, aided by\r\nparades and prestige, along with bravura songs and the usual din of\r\nready-made phrases on the rights of Man and the public salvation.--This\r\ncentral power itself has in its hands no body who might give it an\r\nimpetus and inspiration, it rules only over an impoverished, inert,\r\nor languid social body, solely capable of intermittent spasms or of\r\nartificial rigidity according to order, an organism deprived of its\r\nsecondary organs, simplified to excess, of an inferior or degraded\r\nkind, a people no longer anything but an arithmetical sum of separate,\r\nunconnected units, in brief, human dust or mud.--This is what the\r\ninterference of the State leads to.\r\n\r\nThere are laws in the social and moral world as in the physiological\r\nand physical world; we may misunderstand them, but we cannot elude them;\r\nthey operate now against us, now for us, as we please, but always\r\nalike and without heeding us; it is for us to heed them; for the two\r\nconditions they couple together are inseparable; the moment the first\r\nappears the second inevitably follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2201: Macaulay, \"Essays: Gladstone on Church and State.\"--This\r\nprinciple, of capital importance and of remarkable fecundity, may be\r\ncalled the principle of specialties.

Herbert\r\nSpencer largely develops it in connection with physiological organs\r\nand human societies in his \"Principles of Biology\" and \"Principles of\r\nSociology.\" I have attempted here to show the three parallel branches\r\nof its consequences, and, again, their common root, a constitutive and\r\nprimordial property inherent in every instrumentality.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2202: Cf. \"The Revolution,\" III., book VI., ch. 2 The\r\nencroachments of the State and their effect on individuals is there\r\ntreated.

THE NEW GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Precedents of the new organization.\r\n\r\n     Precedents of the new organization.--In practical\r\n     operation.--Anterior usurpations of the public power.\r\n     --Spontaneous bodies under the Ancient Regime and during the\r\n     Revolution.--Ruin and discredit of their supports.--The\r\n     central power their sole surviving dependence.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in France at the end of the eighteenth century the bent\r\nwas taken and the wrong bent. For three centuries and more the public\r\npower had increasingly violated and discredited spontaneous bodies:\r\n\r\nSometimes it had mutilated them and decapitated them; for example, it\r\nhad suppressed provincial governments (états) over three-quarters of the\r\nterritory, in all the electoral districts; nothing remained of the old\r\nprovince but its name and an administrative circumscription.\r\n\r\nSometimes, without mutilating the corporate body it had upset and\r\ndeformed it, or dislocated and disjointed it.--So that in the\r\ntowns, through changes made in old democratic constitutions, through\r\nrestrictions put upon electoral rights and repeated sales of municipal\r\noffices,[2301] it had handed over municipal authority to a narrow\r\noligarchy of bourgeois families, privileged at the expense of the\r\ntaxpayer, half separated from the main body of the public, disliked\r\nby the lower classes, and no longer supported by the confidence or\r\ndeference of the community. And in the parish and in the rural canton,\r\nit had taken away from the noble his office of resident protector\r\nand hereditary patron, reducing him to the odious position of a mere\r\ncreditor, and, if he were a man of the court, to the yet worse position\r\nof an absentee creditor.[2302]--So that in the parish and in the\r\nrural canton, it had taken away from the noble his office of resident\r\nprotector and hereditary patron, reducing him to the odious position of\r\na mere creditor, and, if he were a man of the court, to the yet worse\r\nposition of an absentee creditor.[2303] Thus, as to the clergy, it had\r\nalmost separated the head from the trunk by superposing (through\r\nthe concordat) a staff of gentleman prelates, rich, ostentatious,\r\nunemployed, and skeptical, upon an army of plain, poor, laborious, and\r\nbelieving curates.[2304]\r\n\r\nFinally, it had, through a protection as untimely as it was aggressive,\r\nsometimes conferred on the corporation oppressive privileges which\r\nrendered it offensive and mischievous, or else fossilized in an obsolete\r\nform which paralyzed its action or corrupted its service. Such was\r\nthe case with the corporations of crafts and industries to which, in\r\nconsideration of financial aid, it had conceded monopolies onerous to\r\nthe consumer and a clog on industrial enterprises. Such was the case\r\nwith the Catholic Church to which, every five years, it granted, in\r\nexchange for its voluntary gift (of money), cruel favors or obnoxious\r\nprerogatives, the prolonged persecution of Protestants, the censorship\r\nof intellectual speculation, and the right of controlling schools and\r\neducation.[2305] Such was the case with the universities benumbed by\r\nroutine; with latest provincial \"Ètats,\" constituted in 1789, as in\r\n1489. Such was the case with noble families subjected by law to the\r\nantique system of substitutions and of primogeniture, that is to say,\r\nto social constraint which, devised long ago for private as well as for\r\npublic interest in order to secure the transmission of local patronage\r\nand political power. This system, however, became useless and\r\ncorrupting, fecund in pernicious vanities,[2306] in detestable\r\ncalculations, domestic tyrannies, forced vocations, and private\r\nbickering, from the time when the nobles, become frequenters of the\r\ncourt, had lost political power and renounced local patronage.\r\n\r\nThus deprived of, or diverted from, their purpose, the corporate bodies\r\nhad become unrecognizable under the crust of the abuses which disfigured\r\nthem. Nobody, except a Montesquieu, could comprehend why they should\r\nexist; on the approach of the Revolution, they seemed, not organs, but\r\noutgrowths, deformities, and, so to say, superannuated monstrosities.\r\nTheir historical and natural roots, their living germs far below the\r\nsurface, their social necessity, their fundamental utility, their\r\npossible usefulness, were no longer visible. Only their present\r\ninconvenience was felt; people suffered by their friction and burden;\r\ntheir lack of harmony and incoherence created dissatisfaction; annoyance\r\ndue to their degeneracy were attributed to radical defects; they were\r\njudged to be naturally unsound and were condemned, in principle, because\r\nof the deviations and laws which the public power had imposed on their\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the public power, which had produced the evil by its\r\nintervention, pretended to remove it by a still greater intervention: in\r\n1789 it again intruded itself on corporate bodies, not to reform them,\r\nnot restore each to its proper channel, not to confine each with proper\r\nlimits, but to destroy them outright. Through a radical, universal, and\r\nextraordinary amputation, the like of which is not mentioned in history,\r\nwith the rashness of the theorist and the brutality of the butcher, the\r\nlegislator extirpated them all, as far as he could, even including the\r\nfamily, while his fury extended beyond the present into the future.\r\nTo legal abolition and total confiscation, he added the systematic\r\nhostility of his preventive laws, together with a fresh obstacle in\r\nthe shape of his new constructions; during three successive\r\nlegislatures[2307] he provided against their future regeneration,\r\nagainst the permanent instincts and necessities which might one day\r\nresuscitate stable families, distinct provinces, and an orthodox church,\r\nagainst artistic, industrial, financial, charitable, and educational\r\ncorporations, against every spontaneous and organized group, and against\r\nevery collective, local, or special enterprise. In place of these he\r\ninstalled synthetic bodies or institutions:\r\n\r\n* a Church without believers,\r\n\r\n* schools without pupils,\r\n\r\n* hospitals without incomes,\r\n\r\n* a geometrical hierarchy of improvised powers in the commune, district,\r\nand department,\r\n\r\nall badly organized, badly adjusted, out of gear at the start,\r\noverwhelmed with political functions, as incapable of performing\r\ntheir proper duties as their supplementary duties, and, from the very\r\nbeginning, either powerless or mischievous.[2308] Changes repeatedly\r\nmarred by arbitrariness from above or from below, set aside or perverted\r\nnow by the mob and again by the government, inert in the country,\r\noppressive in the towns, we have seen the state into which they had\r\nfallen at the end of the Directory; how, instead of a refuge for\r\nliberty, they had become haunts of tyranny or sinks of egoism; why, in\r\n1800, they were as much decried as their predecessors in 1788, why their\r\ntwo successive props, the old one and the most recent, historic custom\r\nand popular election, were now discredited and no longer resorted\r\nto.--After the disastrous experience of the monarchy and the still worse\r\nexperience of the republic, another prop had to be sought for; but only\r\none remained, that of the central power, the only one visible and\r\nwhich seemed substantial; in default of others they had recourse to\r\nthis.[2309] In any event, no protestation, even secret and moral, any\r\nlonger prevented the State from attaching other corporate bodies to\r\nitself, in order to use them for its own purposes as instruments or\r\nappendages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Doctrines of Government.\r\n\r\n     The theory.--Agreement of speculative ideas with practical\r\n     necessities.--Public rights under the Ancient Regime.--The\r\n     King's three original rights.--Labors of the jurists in\r\n     extending royal prerogatives.--Historical impediments.--The\r\n     primitive or ulterior limits of royal power.--The\r\n     philosophic and revolutionary principle of popular\r\n     sovereignty.--Unlimited extension of State power.\r\n     --Application to spontaneous bodies.--Convergence of ancient\r\n     and new doctrines.--Corporations considered as creations of\r\n     the public power.--Centralization through the universal\r\n     intervention of the State.\r\n\r\nThe theory here agreed with the need, and not alone the recent theory,\r\nbut again the ancient theory. Long before 1789, public right had\r\nelevated the prerogative of centralized power into a dogma and\r\nexaggerated it beyond measure.\r\n\r\nThere are three titles under which this power was conferred.--Feudal\r\nseignior, and suzerain, that is to say, commander-in-chief of the great\r\nresident army whose willing forces had served to reconstruct society in\r\nthe ninth century, the King, through the remotest of his origins--that\r\nis to say, through the immemorial confusion of sovereignty with\r\nproperty--was the owner of France, the same as an individual owns his\r\nprivate domain.[2310]--Married, moreover, to the Church since the first\r\nCapets, consecrated and crowned at Rheims, anointed by God like a second\r\nDavid,[2311] not only was he believed to be authorized from on high,\r\nlike other monarchs, but, from Louis le Gros, and especially after the\r\ntime of saint Louis, he appeared as the delegate from on high, invested\r\nwith a laic sacerdotalism, clothed with moral power, minister of eternal\r\njustice, redresser of wrongs, protector of the weak, benefactor of the\r\nhumble--in short, \"His Most Christian Majesty.\"--At length, after the\r\nthirteenth century, the recent discovery and diligent study of the\r\nancient codes of Justinian had shown in his person the successor of\r\nthe Caesars of Rome and of the Emperors of Constantinople. According\r\nto these codes the people in a body had transferred its rights to the\r\nprince; now, in antique cities, all rights were vested in the community,\r\nand the individual had none;[2312] accordingly, through this transfer,\r\nall rights, public or private, passed into the hands of the prince;\r\nhenceforth he could exercise them as he pleased, under no restriction\r\nand no control. He was above the law, since he made it; his powers were\r\nillimitable and his decision absolute.[2313]\r\n\r\nOn this triple frame the jurists, like State spiders, had, from Philippe\r\nle Bel down, spun their web, and the instinctive concordance of their\r\nhereditary efforts had attached all its threads to the omnipotence of\r\nthe King.--Being jurisconsults--that is to say, logicians--they were\r\nobliged to deduce, and their minds naturally recurred to the unique\r\nand rigid principle to which they might attach their arguments.--As\r\nadvocates and councilors of the crown they espoused the case of their\r\nclient and, through professional zeal, derived or forced precedents and\r\ntexts to his advantage.--By virtue of being administrators and judges\r\nthe grandeur of their master constituted their grandeur, and personal\r\ninterest counseled them to expand a prerogative in which, through\r\ndelegation, they took part.--Hence, during four centuries, they had spun\r\nthe tissue of \"regalian rights,\" the great net in the meshes of which,\r\nsince Louis XIV., all lives found themselves caught.[2314]\r\n\r\nNevertheless, however tightly spun was the web, there were openings\r\nin it, or, at least, very weak spots.--And first, of the consequences\r\nflowing from these three principles in their hands, two of them had\r\nhindered the third from unwinding its skein to the end: owing to the\r\nfact that the King was formerly Count de Paris and Abbot of St. Denis,\r\nhe could not become a veritable Augustus, an authentic Diocletian: his\r\ntwo French titles limited his Roman title. Without regard to the laws,\r\nso-called fundamental, which imposed his heir on him beforehand, also\r\nthe entire line of his successive heirs, the tutor, male or female,\r\nof his minor heir, and which, if he derogated from immemorial usage,\r\nannulled his will like that of a private individual, his quality of\r\nsuzerain and that of Most Christian, were for him a double impediment.\r\nAs hereditary general of the feudal army he was bound to consider and\r\nrespect the hereditary officers of the same army, his old peers and\r\ncompanions in arms--that is to say, the nobles. As outside bishop, he\r\nowed to the Church not alone his spiritual orthodoxy, but, again, his\r\ntemporal esteem, his active zeal, and the aid furnished him by his\r\nsecular arm. Hence, in applied right, the numerous privileges of the\r\nnobles and the Church, so many immunities and even liberties, so\r\nmany remains of antique local independence, and even of antique local\r\nsovereignty,[2315] so many prerogatives, honorific or serviceable,\r\nmaintained by the law and by the tribunals. On this side, the meshes of\r\nthe monarchical netting had not been well knit or remained loose;\r\nand the same elsewhere, with openings more or less wide, in the five\r\nprovincial governments (états), in the Pyrenees districts, in Alsace, at\r\nStrasbourg, but especially in Languedoc and in Brittany, where the\r\npact of incorporation, through a sort of bilateral contract, associated\r\ntogether on the same parchment and under the same seal the franchises of\r\nthe province and the sovereignty of the King.\r\n\r\nAdd to these original lacunae the hole made by the Prince himself in his\r\nnet already woven: he had with his own hand torn away its meshes, and\r\nby thousands. Extravagant to excess and always needy, he converted\r\neverything into money, even his own rights, and, in the military order,\r\nin the civil order, in commerce and in industry, in the administration,\r\nin the judicature, and in the finances. From one end of the territory to\r\nthe other, he had sold innumerable offices, imposts, dignities,\r\nhonors, monopolies, exemptions, survivorships, expectancies--in brief,\r\nprivileges which, once conferred for a money consideration, became legal\r\nproperty,[2316] often hereditary and transmissible by the individual or\r\nthe corporation which had paid for them. In this way the King alienated\r\na portion of his royalty for the benefit of the buyer. Now, in 1789, he\r\nhad alienated a great many of these portions; accordingly, his present\r\nauthority was everywhere restricted by the use he had previously made of\r\nit.--Sovereignty, thus, in his hands had suffered from the double effect\r\nof its historic origins and its historic exercise; the public power had\r\nnot become, or had ceased to be, omnipotence. On the one hand it had not\r\nreached its plenitude, and on the other hand it had deprived itself of a\r\nportion of its own completeness.\r\n\r\nThe philosophers wished to find a solution for this double weakness,\r\ninnate and acquired They had therefore transported sovereignty out of\r\nhistory into the ideal and abstract world, with an imaginary city of\r\nmankind reduced to the minimum of a human being Here men, infinitely\r\nsimplified, all alike, equal, separate from their surroundings and from\r\ntheir past, veritable puppets, were all lifting their hands in common\r\nrectangular motion to vote unanimously for the contrat social. In this\r\ncontract \"all classes are reduced to one,[2317] the complete surrender\r\nof each associate, with all his rights, to the community, each giving\r\nhimself up entirely, just as he actually is, himself and all his forces,\r\nof which whatever he possesses forms a part,\" each becoming with respect\r\nto himself and every act of his private life a delegate of the State, a\r\nresponsible clerk, in short, a functionary, a functionary of the people,\r\nhenceforth the unique, the absolute, and the universal sovereign. A\r\nterrible principle, proclaimed and applied for ten years, below by\r\nthe mob and above by the government! Popular opinion had adopted\r\nit; accordingly the passage from the sovereignty of the King to the\r\nsovereignty of the people was easy, smooth,[2318] and to the novice in\r\nreasoning, the old-fashioned taxable and workable subject, to whom the\r\nprinciple conferred a portion of the sovereignty, the temptation was too\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nAt once, according to their custom, the jurists put themselves at\r\nthe service of the new reign. And no dogma was better suited their to\r\nauthoritative instinct; no axiom furnished them so convenient a fulcrum\r\non which to set up and turn their logical wheel. This wheel, which they\r\nhad latterly managed with care and caution under the ancient Régime, had\r\nsuddenly in their hands turned with frightful speed and effect in order\r\nto convert the rigid, universal, and applied laws, the intermittent\r\nprocesses, the theoretical pretensions, and the worst precedents of the\r\nmonarchy into practice. This meant\r\n\r\n* the use of extraordinary commissions,\r\n\r\n* accusations of lésé majesté,\r\n\r\n* the suppression of legal formalities,\r\n\r\n* the persecution of religious beliefs and of personal opinions,\r\n\r\n* the right of condemning publications and of coercing thought,\r\n\r\n* the right of instruction and education,\r\n\r\n* the rights of pre-emption, of requisition, of confiscation, and of\r\nproscription,\r\n\r\nin short, pure and perfect arbitrariness. The result is visible in the\r\ndeeds of Treilhard, of Berlier, of Merlin de Douai, of Cambacérès, in\r\nthose of the Constituant and Legislative Assemblies, in the Convention,\r\nunder the Directory, in their Jacobin zeal or hypocrisy, in their talent\r\nfor combining despotic tradition with tyrannical innovation, in their\r\nprofessional skill in fabricating on all occasions a snare of plausible\r\narguments with which to properly strangle the individual, their\r\nadversary, to the profit of the State, their eternal master.\r\n\r\nIn effect, not only had they almost strangled their adversary, but\r\nlikewise, through an aftereffect, their master: France which, after\r\nfourteen months of suffocation, was approaching physical suicide.[2319]\r\nSuch success, too great, had obliged them to stop; they had abandoned\r\none-half of their destructive creed, retaining only the other half, the\r\neffect of which, less imminent, was less apparent. If they no longer\r\ndared paralyze individual acts in the man, they persisted in paralyzing\r\nin the individual all collective acts.--There must be no special\r\nassociations in general society; no corporations within the State,\r\nespecially no spontaneous bodies endowed with the initiative,\r\nproprietary and permanent: such is Article II. of the Revolutionary\r\nCreed, and the direct consequence of the previous one which posits\r\naxiomatically the sovereignty of the people and the omnipotence of the\r\nState. Rousseau,[2320] inventor of the first, had like-wise enunciated\r\nthe second; the constituent assembly had solemnly decreed it and applied\r\nit on a grand scale,[2321] and successive assemblies had applied it on\r\na still grander scale;[2322] it was a faith with the Jacobins, and,\r\nbesides, in conformity with the spirit of Roman imperial right and with\r\nthe leading maxim of French monarchical right. On this point the three\r\nknown jurisprudential systems were in accord, while their convergence\r\nbrought together around the same table the jurists of the three\r\ndoctrines in a common task, ex-parliamentarians and ex-members of the\r\nCommittee of Public Safety, former pro-scribers and the proscribed, the\r\npurveyors of Sinamari with Treilhard and Merlin de Douai, returned from\r\nGuiana, alongside of Simeon, Portalis, and Barbé-Marbois. There was\r\nnobody in this conclave to maintain the rights of spontaneous bodies;\r\nthe theory, on all three sides, no matter from whom it proceeded,\r\nrefused to recognize them for what they are originally and essentially,\r\nthat is to say, distinct organisms equally natural with the State,\r\nequally indispensable in their way, and, therefore, as legitimate as\r\nitself; it allowed them only a life on trust, derived from above and\r\nfrom the center. But, since the State created them, it might and ought\r\nto treat them as its creatures, keep them indefinitely under its thumb,\r\nuse them for its purposes, act through them as through other agencies,\r\nand transform their chiefs into functionaries of the central power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Brilliant Statesman and Administrator.\r\n\r\n     The Organizer.--Influence of Napoleon's character and mind\r\n     on his internal and French system.--Exigencies of his\r\n     external and European rôle.--Suppression of all centers of\r\n     combination and concord.--Extension of the public domain and\r\n     what it embraces.--Reasons for maintaining the private\r\n     domain.--The part of the individual.--His reserved\r\n     enclosure.--Outlets for him beyond that.--His talents are\r\n     enlisted in the service of public power.--Special aptitude\r\n     and temporary vigor, lack of balance, and doubtful future of\r\n     the social body thus formed.\r\n\r\nA new France, not the chimerical, communistic, equalized, and Spartan\r\nFrance of Robespierre and Saint-Just, but a possible real, durable, and\r\nyet leveled and uniform France, logically struck out at one blow, all\r\nof a piece, according to one general principle, a France, centralized,\r\nadministrative, and, save the petty egoistic play of individuals,\r\nmanaged in one entire body from top to bottom,--in short, the France\r\nwhich Richelieu and Louis XIV. had longed for, which Mirabeau after 1790\r\nhad foreseen,[2323] is now the work which the theories of the monarchy\r\nand of the Revolution had prepared, and toward which the final\r\nconcurrence of events, that is to say, \"the alliance of philosophy and\r\nthe saber,\" led the sovereign hands of the First Consul.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, considering his well-known character, the promptitude, the\r\nactivity, the reach, the universality, and the cast of his intellect, he\r\ncould not have proposed to himself a different work nor reduced himself\r\nto a lower standard. His need of governing and of administrating was too\r\ngreat; his capacity for governing and administrating was too great:\r\nhis was an exacting genius.--Moreover, for the outward task that he\r\nundertook he required internally, not only undisputed possession of all\r\nexecutive and legislative powers, not only perfect obedience from all\r\nlegal authorities, but, again, the annihilation of all moral authority\r\nbut his own, that is to say, the silence of public opinion and the\r\nisolation of each individual, and therefore the abolition, preventive\r\nand systematic, of any religious, ecclesiastic, pedagogic, charitable,\r\nliterary, departmental, or communal initiative that might, now or in the\r\nfuture gather men against him or alongside of him. Like a good general\r\nhe secures his rear. At strife with all Europe, he so arranges it as\r\nnot to allow in the France he drags along after him refractory souls or\r\nbodies which might form platoons in his rear. Consequently, and through\r\nprecaution, he suppresses in advance all eventual rallying points or\r\ncenters of combination Henceforth, every wire which can stir up and\r\nbring a company of men together for the same object terminates in his\r\nhands; he holds in his firm grasp all these combined wires, guards them\r\nwith jealous care, in order to strain them to the utmost. Let no one\r\nattempt to loosen them, and, above all, let no one entertain a thought\r\nof getting hold of them; they belong to him and to him alone, and\r\ncompose the public domain, which is his domain proper.\r\n\r\nBut, alongside of his proper domain, he recognizes another in which he\r\nhimself assigns a limit to the complete absorption of all wills by his\r\nown; he does not admit, of course in his own interest, that the public\r\npower, at least in the civil order of things and in common practice,\r\nshould be illimitable nor, especially, arbitrary.[2324]--This is due\r\nto his not being an utopian or a theorist, like his predecessors of the\r\nConvention, but a perspicacious statesman, who is in the habit of\r\nusing his own eyes. He sees things directly, in themselves; he does not\r\nimagine them through book formulae or party phrases, by a process of\r\nverbal reasoning, employing the gratuitous suppositions of humanitarian\r\noptimism or the dogmatic prejudices of Jacobin nonsense. He sees Man\r\njust as he is, not Man in himself, an abstract citizen, the philosophic\r\npuppet of the Contrat Social, but the real individual, the entire living\r\nman, with his profound instincts, his tenacious necessities, which,\r\nwhether tolerated or not by legislation, still subsist and operate\r\ninfallibly, and which the legislator must take into consideration if he\r\nwants to turn them to account.--This individual, a civilized European\r\nand a modern Frenchman, constituted as he is by several centuries\r\nof tolerable police discipline, of respected rights and hereditary\r\nproperty, must have a private domain, an enclosed area, large or small,\r\nwhich belongs and is reserved to him personally, to which the public\r\npower interdicts access and before which it mounts guard to prevent\r\nother individuals from intruding on it. Otherwise his condition seems\r\nintolerable to him; he is no longer disposed to exert himself, to set\r\nhis wits to work, or to enter upon any enterprise. Let us be careful not\r\nto snap or loosen this powerful and precious spring of action; let him\r\ncontinue to work, to produce, to economize, if only that he may be in\r\na condition to pay taxes; let him continue to marry, to bring forth and\r\nraise up sons, if only to serve the conscription. Let us ease his mind\r\nwith regard to his enclosure;[2325] let him exercise full proprietorship\r\nover it and enjoy it exclusively; let him feel himself at home in his\r\nown house in perpetuity, safe from any intrusion, protected by the\r\ncode and by the courts, not alone against his enemies, but against the\r\nadministration itself. Let him in this well-defined, circumscribed abode\r\nbe free to turn round and range as he pleases, free to browse at will,\r\nand, if he chooses, to consume all his hay himself. It is not essential\r\nthat his meadows should be very extensive: most men live with their nose\r\nto the ground; very few look beyond a very narrow circle; men are not\r\nmuch troubled by being penned up; the egoism and urgent needs of daily\r\nlife are already for them ready-made limits: within these natural\r\nbarriers they ask for nothing but to be allowed to graze in security.\r\nLet us give them this assurance and leave them free to consult their\r\nown welfare.--As to the rest, in very small number, more or less\r\nimaginative, energetic, and ardent, there is, outside the enclosure, an\r\nissue expressly provided for them: the new administrative and military\r\nprofessions offer an outlet to their ambition and to their vanity which,\r\nfrom the start, keeps on expanding until, suddenly, the first Consul\r\npoints to an infinite perspective on the horizon.[2326] According to an\r\nexpression attributed to him, henceforth,\r\n\r\n\"the field is open to all talents,\"\r\n\r\nand hence all talents, gathered into the central current and\r\nprecipitated headlong through competition, swell with their inflow the\r\nimmensity of the public power.\r\n\r\nThis done, the principal features of modern France are traced; a tool\r\nof a new and strange type arises, defines itself, and issues forth,\r\nits structure determining its destiny. It consists of a social body\r\norganized by a despot and for a despot, calculated for the use of one\r\nman, excellent for action under the impulsion of a unique will, with a\r\nsuperior intelligence, admirable so long as this intelligence remains\r\nlucid and this will remains healthy. It is adapted to a military life\r\nand not to civil life, and therefore badly balanced, hampered (géné) in\r\nits development, exposed to periodical crises, condemned to precocious\r\ndebility, but viable for a long time, and, for the present robust, alone\r\nable to bear the weight of the new reign and to furnish for fifteen\r\nsuccessive years the crushing labor, the conquering obedience, the\r\nsuperhuman, murderous, insensate effort which its master exacts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Napoleon's barracks.\r\n\r\n     General aspect and characteristics of the new State.\r\n     --Contrast between its structure and that of other\r\n     contemporary or pre-existing States.--The plurality,\r\n     complexity, and irregularity of ancient France.--The unity,\r\n     simplicity, and regularity of modern France.--To what class\r\n     of works it belongs.--It is the modern masterpiece of the\r\n     classic spirit in the political and social order of things.\r\n\r\nLet us take a nearer view of the master's idea and of the way in which,\r\nat this moment, he figures to himself the society which is assuming\r\nnew shape in his hands. All the leading features of the plan are fixed\r\nbeforehand in his mind: they are already deeply graven on it through his\r\neducation and through his instinct. By virtue of this instinct, which\r\nis despotic, by virtue of this education, which is classic and Latin,\r\nhe conceives human associations not in the modern fashion, Germanic and\r\nChristian, as a concert of initiations starting from below, but in the\r\nantique fashion, pagan and Roman, as a hierarchy of authorities imposed\r\nfrom above. He puts his own spirit into his civil institutions, the\r\nmilitary spirit; consequently, he constructs a huge barracks wherein,\r\nto begin with, he lodges thirty million, men, women, and children, and,\r\nlater on, forty-two million, all the way from Hamburg to Rome.\r\n\r\nThe edifice is, of course, superb and of a new style. On comparing it\r\nwith other societies in surrounding Europe, and particularly France as\r\nshe was previous to 1789, the contrast is striking.--Everywhere else the\r\nsocial edifice is a composition of many distinct structures--provinces,\r\ncities, seignories, churches, universities, and corporations. Each has\r\nbegun by being a more or less isolated block of buildings where, on\r\nan enclosed area, a population has lived apart. Little by little the\r\nbarriers have given way; either they have been broken in or have tumbled\r\ndown of their own accord; passages have been made between one and the\r\nother and new additions have been put up; at last, these scattered\r\nbuildings have all become connected and soldered on as annexes to the\r\ncentral pile. But they combine with it only through a visible and\r\nclumsy juxtaposition, through incomplete and bizarre communications: the\r\nvestiges of their former independence are still apparent athwart their\r\nactual dependence. Each still rests on its own primitive and appropriate\r\nfoundations; its grand lines subsist; its main work is often almost\r\nintact. In France, on the eve of 1789, it is easily recognized what she\r\nformerly was; for example, it is clear that Languedoc and Brittany were\r\nonce sovereign States, Strasbourg a sovereign town, the Bishop of Mende\r\nand the Abbess of Remiremont, sovereign princes;[2327] every seignior,\r\nlaic, or ecclesiastic, was so in his own domain, and he still possessed\r\nsome remnants of public power. In brief, we see thousands of states\r\nwithin the State, absorbed, but not assimilated, each with its own\r\nstatutes, its own legal customs, its own civil law, its own weights\r\nand measures; several with special privileges and immunities; some with\r\ntheir own jurisdiction and their own peculiar administration, with their\r\nown imposts and tariffs like so many more or less dismantled fortresses,\r\nbut whose old feudal, municipal, or provincial walls still rose lofty\r\nand thick on the soil comprehended within the national enclosure.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more irregular than this total aggregate thus formed;\r\nit is not really an entire whole, but an agglomeration. No plan, good or\r\nbad, has been followed out; the architecture is of ten different styles\r\nand of ten different epochs. That of the dioceses is Roman and of\r\nthe fourth century; that of the seignories is Gothic and of the ninth\r\ncentury; one structure dates from the Capetians, another from the\r\nValois, and each bears the character of its date. Because each has been\r\nbuilt for itself and with no regard to the others, adapted to an urgent\r\nservice according to the exigencies or requirements of time, place, and\r\ncircumstance; afterward, when circumstances changed, it had to adapt\r\nitself to other services, and this constantly from century to century,\r\nunder Philippe le Bel, under Louis XI., under Francis I., under\r\nRichelieu, under Louis XIV., through constant revision which never\r\nconsists of entire destruction, through a series of partial demolitions\r\nand of partial reconstructions, in such a way as to maintain itself,\r\nduring the transformation, in conciliating, well or ill, new demands and\r\nrooted habits, in reconciling the work of the passing generation with\r\nthe works of generations gone before.--The central seignory itself is\r\nmerely a donjon of the tenth century, a military tower of which the\r\nenclosure has extended so as to embrace the entire territory, and of\r\nwhich the other buildings, more or less incorporated with it, have\r\nbecome prolongations.--A similar medley of constructions--disfigured by\r\nsuch mutilations, adjuncts, and patches, a pell-mell so complicated\r\nwith such incongruous bits and fragments--can be comprehended only by\r\nantiquaries and historians; ordinary spectators--the public--pronounce\r\nit absurd; it finds no favor with that class of reasoners who, in social\r\narchitecture as in physical architecture, repudiate disorder, posit\r\ntheories, deduce consequences, and require that every work shall proceed\r\nfrom the application of a simple idea.\r\n\r\nAnd worse still, not only is good taste offended but, again, good\r\nsense often murmurs. Practically, the edifice fails in its object, for,\r\nerected for men to dwell in, it is in many places scarcely habitable.\r\nBecause it endures it is found superannuated, ill-adapted to prevailing\r\ncustoms; it formerly suited, and still suits, the feudal, scattered, and\r\nmilitant way of living; hence it no longer suits the unity and repose\r\nof modern life. New-born rights obtain no place in it alongside of\r\nestablished rights; it is either not sufficiently transformed or it\r\nhas been transformed in an opposite sense, in such a way as to be\r\ninconvenient or unhealthy, badly accommodating people who are useful and\r\ngiving good accommodations to useless people, costing too much to\r\nkeep up and causing discomfort and discontent to nearly all its\r\noccupants.--In France, in particular, the best apartments, especially\r\nthat of the King, are for a century past too high and too large, too\r\nsumptuous and too expensive. Since Louis XIV. these have imperceptibly\r\nceased to be government and business bureaus; they have become in\r\ntheir disposition, decoration, and furnishing, saloons for pomp and\r\nconversation, the occupants of which, for lack of other employment,\r\ndelight in discussing architecture and in tracing plans on paper for an\r\nimaginary edifice in which everybody will find himself comfortable. Now,\r\nunderneath these, everybody finds himself uncomfortable, the bourgeoisie\r\nin its small scanty lodgings on the ground-floor and the people in their\r\nholes in the cellar, which are low and damp, wherein light and air never\r\npenetrate. Innumerable vagabonds and vagrants are still worse off, for,\r\nwith no shelter or fireside, they sleep under the stars, and as they\r\nare without anything to care for, they are disposed to pull everything\r\ndown.--Under the double pressure of insurrection and theory the\r\ndemolition begins, while the fury of destruction goes on increasing\r\nuntil nothing is left of the razed edifice but the soil it stood on.\r\n\r\nThe new one rises on this cleared ground and, historically as well as\r\nstructurally, it differs from all the others.--In less than ten years\r\nit springs up and is finished according to a plan which, from the first\r\nday, is definite and complete. It forms one unique, vast, monumental\r\nblock, in which all branches of the service are lodged under one roof;\r\nin addition to the national and general services belonging to the public\r\npower, we find here others also, local and special, which do not belong\r\nto it, such as worship, education, charity, fine arts, literature,\r\ndepartmental and communal interests, each installed in a distinct\r\ncompartment. All the compartments are ordered and arranged alike,\r\nforming a circle around the magnificent central apartment, with which\r\neach is in communication by a bell; as soon as the bell rings and the\r\nsound spreads from division to sub-division, the entire service, from\r\nthe chief clerk down to the lowest employee, is instantly in motion;\r\nin this respect the arrangement, as regards despatch, co-ordination,\r\nexactitude, and working facilities, is admirable.[2328]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, its advantages and attractions for employees and\r\naspirants of every kind and degree are not mediocre. There is no\r\nseparation between the stories, no insurmountable barrier or enclosure\r\nbetween large and small apartments; all, from the least to the finest,\r\nfrom the outside as well as from the inside, have free access.\r\nSpacious entrances around the exterior terminate in broad, well-lighted\r\nstaircases open to the public; everybody can clamber up that pleases,\r\nand to mount these one must clamber; from top to bottom there is no\r\nother communication than that which they present. There is no concealed\r\nand privileged passage, no private stairway or false door; glancing\r\nalong the whole rectilinear, uniform flight, we behold the innumerable\r\nbody of clerks, functionaries, supernumeraries, and postulants, an\r\nentire multitude, ranged tier beyond tier and attentive; nobody advances\r\nexcept at the word and in his turn.--Nowhere in Europe are human lives\r\nso well regulated, within lines of demarcation so universal, so simple,\r\nand so satisfactory to the eye and to logic: the edifice in which\r\nFrenchmen are henceforth to move and act is regular from top to bottom,\r\nin its entirety as well as in its details, outside as well as inside;\r\nits stories, one above the other, are adjusted with exact symmetry;\r\nits juxtaposed masses form pendants and counterpoise; all its lines\r\nand forms, every dimension and proportion, all its props and buttresses\r\ncombine, through their mutual dependencies, to compose a harmony and\r\nto maintain an equilibrium. In this respect the structure is classic,\r\nbelonging to the same family of productions which the same spirit,\r\nguided by the same method, had produced in Europe for the previous one\r\nhundred and fifty years.[2329] Its analogues, in the physical order\r\nof things, are the architectural productions of Mansard, Le Notre, and\r\ntheir successors, from the structures and gardens of Versailles down to\r\nand embracing the Madeleine and the Rue de Rivoli. In the intellectual\r\norder, its analogues consist of the literary forms of the seventeenth\r\nand eighteenth centuries, the superb oratorical prose and correct,\r\neloquent poetry, especially epics and tragedies, including those still\r\nmanufactured according to rule about the year 1810. It corresponds\r\nto these and forms their pendant in the political and social order\r\nof things, because it emanates from the same deliberate purpose. Four\r\nconstitutions, in the same style, preceded it; but these were good only\r\non paper, while this one stands firm on the ground. For the first time\r\nin modern history we see a society due to ratiocination and, at the\r\nsame time, substantial; the new France, under these two heads, is the\r\nmasterpiece of the classic spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Modeled after Rome.\r\n\r\n     Its analogue in the antique world.--The Roman State from\r\n     Diocletian to Constantine.--Causes and bearing of this\r\n     analogy.--Survival of the Roman idea in Napoleon's mind.\r\n     --The new Empire of the West.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if we go back in time, beyond modern times, beyond the\r\nMiddle Ages, as far as the antique world, we encounter during the Roman\r\nemperors Diocletian's and Constantine's era another monument whose\r\narchitecture, equally regular, is developed on a still grander scale:\r\nback then we are in the natal atmosphere and stand on the natal soil of\r\nthe classic spirit.--At this time, the human material, more reduced\r\nand better prepared than in France, existed similarly in the requisite\r\ncondition. At this date, we likewise see at work the prearranging\r\nreasoning-faculty\r\n\r\n* which simplifies in order to deduce,\r\n\r\n* which leaves out historic customs and local diversities,\r\n\r\n* which considers the basic human being,\r\n\r\n* which treats individuals as units and the people as totals,\r\n\r\n* which forcibly applies its general outlines to all special lives, and\r\n\r\n* which glories in constituting, legislating, and administering by rule\r\naccording to the measurements of square and compass.\r\n\r\nAt this date, in effect, the turn of mind, the talent, the ways of the\r\nRoman architect, his object, his resources and his means of execution,\r\nare already those of his French successor; the conditions around him\r\nin the Roman world are equivalent; behind him in Roman history the\r\nprecedents, ancient and recent, are almost the same.\r\n\r\nIn the first place,[2330] there is, since emperor Augustus, the absolute\r\nmonarchy, and, since the Antonines, administrative centralization the\r\nresult of which is that\r\n\r\n* all the old national and municipal communities are broken up or\r\ncrushed out,\r\n\r\n* all collective existences chilled or extinguished,\r\n\r\n* local patriotism slowly worn away,\r\n\r\n* an increasing diminution of individual initiative,\r\n\r\nand, under the invasive interference, direction, and providence of the\r\nState, one hundred millions of men become more and more passive and\r\nseparated from each other.[2331]\r\n\r\nAnd as a result, in full enjoyment of peace and internal prosperity\r\nunder the appearances of union, force, and health, latent feebleness,\r\nand, as in France on the approach of 1789, a coming dissolution.\r\n\r\nThere is next, as after 1789 in France, the total collapse, not from\r\nbelow and among the people, but from above and through the army, a worse\r\ncollapse than in France, prolonged for fifty years of anarchy, civil\r\nwars, local usurpations, ephemeral tyrannies, urban seditions, rural\r\njacqueries, brigandage, famines, and invasions along the whole frontier,\r\nwith such a ruin of agriculture and other useful activities, with such\r\na diminution of public and private capital, with such a destruction of\r\nhuman lives that, in twenty years, the number of the population seems\r\nto have diminished one half.[2332] There is, finally, as after 1799, in\r\nFrance, the re-establishment of order brought about more slowly, but by\r\nthe same means, the army and a dictatorship, in the rude hands of three\r\nor four great military parvenus, Pannonians or Dalmatians, Bonapartes\r\nof Sirmium or of Scutari, they too, of a new race or of intact energy,\r\nadventurers and children of their own deeds, the last Diocletian, like\r\nNapoleon, a restorer and an innovator. Around them, as around\r\nNapoleon, to aid them in their civil undertakings, is a crowd of expert\r\nadministrators and eminent jurisconsults, all practitioners, statesmen,\r\nand businessmen, and yet men of culture, logicians, and philosophers.\r\nThey were imbued with the double governmental and humanitarian view,\r\nwhich for three centuries Greek speculation and Roman practice had\r\nintroduced into minds and imaginations. This view, at once leveling and\r\nauthoritative, tending to exaggerate the attributes of the State and the\r\nsupreme power of the prince,[2333] was nevertheless inclined\r\n\r\n* to put natural right in the place of positive law,[2334]\r\n\r\n* to preferring equity and logic to antiquity and to custom,\r\n\r\n* to reinstate the dignity of man among the qualities of mankind,\r\n\r\n* to enhance the condition of the slave, of the provincial, of the\r\ndebtor, of the bastard, of woman, of the child, and\r\n\r\n* to recover for the human community all its inferior members, foreign\r\nor degraded, which the ancient constitution of the family and of the\r\ncity had excluded from it.\r\n\r\nTherefore Napoleon could find the outlines of his construction in\r\nthe political, legislative, and judicial organizations extending from\r\nDiocletian to Constantine, and beyond these down to Theodosius. At the\r\nbase, popular sovereignty;[2335] the powers of the people delegated\r\nunconditionally to one man. This omnipotence conferred, theoretically or\r\napparently, through the free choice of citizens, but really through the\r\nwill of the army. No protection against the Prince's arbitrary edict,\r\nexcept a no less arbitrary rescript from the same hand. His successor\r\ndesignated, adopted, and qualified by himself. A senate for show, a\r\ncouncil of state for administration; all local powers conferred from\r\nabove; cities under tutelage. All subjects endowed with the showy\r\ntitle of citizen, and all citizens reduced to the humble condition of\r\ntaxpayers and of people under control. An administration of a hundred\r\nthousand officials taking all services into its hands, comprising public\r\ninstruction, public succor, and public supplies of food, together\r\nwith systems of worship. This was at first pagan cults, and after\r\nConstantine, the Christian cult. All these services were classified,\r\nranked, co-coordinated, carefully defined in such a way as not to\r\nencroach on each other, and carefully combined in such a way as to\r\ncomplete each other. An immense hierarchy of transferable functionaries\r\nwas kept at work from above on one hundred and eighty square leagues of\r\nterritory; thirty populations of different race and language-Syrians,\r\nEgyptians, Numidians, Spaniards, Gauls, Britons, Germans, Greeks,\r\nItalians--subject to the same uniform Régime. The territory was divided\r\nlike a checker-board, on arithmetical and geometrical principles, into\r\none hundred or one hundred and twenty small provinces; old nations or\r\nStates dismembered and purposely cut up so as to put an end forever to\r\nnatural, spontaneous, and viable groups. A minute and verified census\r\ntaking place every fifteen years to correctly assign land taxes. An\r\nofficial and universal language; a State system of worship, and, very\r\nsoon, a Church and State orthodoxy. A systematic code of laws, full\r\nand precise, admirable for the rule of private life, a sort of moral\r\ngeometry in which the theorems, rigorously linked together, are attached\r\nto the definitions and axioms of abstract justice. A scale of grades,\r\none above the other, which everybody may ascend from the first to the\r\nlast; titles of nobility more and more advanced, suited to more and more\r\nadvanced functions; spectabiles, illustres, clarissimi, perfectissimi,\r\nanalogous to Napoleon's Barons, Counts, Dukes, and Princes. A programme\r\nof promotion once exhibiting, and on which are still seen, common\r\nsoldiers, peasants, a shepherd, a barbarian, the son of a cultivator\r\n(colon), the grandson of a slave, mounting gradually upward to the\r\nhighest dignities, becoming patrician, Count, Duke, commander of the\r\ncavalry, Cæsar, Augustus, and donning the imperial purple, enthroned\r\namid the most sumptuous magnificence and the most elaborate ceremonial\r\nprostrations, a being called God during his lifetime, and after\r\ndeath adored as a divinity, and dead or alive, a complete divinity on\r\nearth.[2336]\r\n\r\nSo colossal an edifice, so admirably adjusted, so mathematical, could\r\nnot wholly perish; its hewn stones were too massive, too nicely squared;\r\ntoo exactly fitted, and the demolisher's hammer could not reach down\r\nto its deepest foundations.--This one, through its shaping and its\r\nstructure, through its history and its duration, resembles the stone\r\nedifices which the same people at the same epoch elevated on the same\r\nsoil, the aqueducts, amphitheatres, and triumphal arches, the Coliseum,\r\nthe baths of Diocletian and of Caracalla.\r\n\r\nThe medieval man, using their intact foundations and their shattered\r\nfragments, built here and there, haphazard, according to the necessities\r\nof the moment, planting his Gothic towers between Corinthian columns\r\nagainst the panels of walls still standing.[2337] But, under his\r\nincoherent masonry, he observed the beautiful forms, the precious\r\nmarbles, the architectural combinations, the symmetrical taste of an\r\nanterior and superior art; he felt that his own work was rude. The new\r\nworld, to all thinking minds, was miserable compared with the old one;\r\nits languages seemed a patois (crude dialect), its literature mere\r\nstammering or driveling, its law a mass of abuses or a mere routine, its\r\nfeudality anarchy, and its social arrangements, disorder.--In vain had\r\nthe medieval man striven to escape through all issues, by the temporal\r\nroad and by the spiritual road, by the universal and absolute monarchy\r\nof the German Cesars, and by the universal and absolute monarchy of the\r\nRoman pontiffs. At the end of the fifteenth century the Emperor still\r\npossessed the golden globe, the golden crown, the scepter of Charlemagne\r\nand of Otho the Great, but, after the death of Frederick II., he was\r\nnothing more than a majesty for show; the Pope still wore the tiara,\r\nstill held the pastoral staff and the keys of Gregory VII. and of\r\nInnocent III., but, after the death of Boniface VIII., he was nothing\r\nmore than a majesty of the Church. Both abortive restorations had merely\r\nadded ruins to ruins, while the phantom of the ancient empire alone\r\nremained erect amid so many fragments. Grand in its outlines and\r\ndecorations, it stood there, august, dazzling, in a halo, the unique\r\nmasterpiece of art and of reason, as the ideal form of human society.\r\nFor ten centuries this specter haunted the medieval epoch, and nowhere\r\nto such an extent as in Italy.[2338]\r\n\r\nIt reappears the last time in 1800, starting up in and taking firm hold\r\nof the magnificent, benighted imagination of the great Italian,[2339] to\r\nwhom the opportunity afforded the means for executing the grand Italian\r\ndream of the Middle Ages; it is according to this retrospective vision\r\nthat the Diocletian of Ajaccio, the Constantine of the Concordat, the\r\nJustinian of the Civil Code, the Theodosius of the Tuileries and of St.\r\nCloud reconstructed France.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that he copies--he restores; his conception is not\r\nplagiarism, but a case of atavism; it comes to him through the nature\r\nof his intellect and through racial traditions. In the way of social\r\nand political conceptions, as in literature and in art, his spontaneous\r\ntaste is ultra-classic. We detect this in his mode of comprehending the\r\nhistory of France; State historians, \"encouraged by the police,\" must\r\nmake it to order; they must trace it \"from the end of Louis XIV. to\r\nthe year VIII,\" and their object must be to show how superior the new\r\narchitecture is to the old one.[2340] \"The constant disturbance of the\r\nfinances must be noted, the chaos of the provincial assemblies,... the\r\npretensions of the parliaments, the lack of energy and order in the\r\nadministration, that parti-colored France with no unity of laws or of\r\nadministration, being rather a union of twenty kingdoms than one single\r\nState, so that one breathes on reaching the epoch in which people enjoy\r\nthe benefits of the unity of the laws, of the administration, and of the\r\nterritory.\" In effect, he breathes; in thus passing from the former to\r\nthe latter spectacle, he finds real intellectual pleasure; his eyes,\r\noffended with Gothic disorder, turn with relief and satisfaction to\r\nmajestic simplicity and classic regularity; his eyes are those of a\r\nLatin architect brought up in the \"École de Rome.\"\r\n\r\nThis is so true that, outside of this style, he admits of no other.\r\nSocieties of a different type seem to him absurd. He misconceives their\r\nlocal propriety and the historical reasons for their existence. He takes\r\nno account of their solidity. He is going to dash himself against\r\nSpain and against Russia, and he has no comprehension whatever of\r\nEngland.[2341]--This is so true that, wherever he places his hand he\r\napplies his own social system; he imposes on annexed territories and\r\non vassal[2342] countries the same uniform arrangements, his\r\nown administrative hierarchy, his own territorial divisions and\r\nsub-divisions, his own conscription, his civil code, his constitutional\r\nand ecclesiastical system, his university, his system of equality\r\nand promotion, the entire French system, and, as far as possible, the\r\nlanguage, literature, drama, and even the spirit of his France,--in\r\nbrief, civilization as he conceives it, so that conquest becomes\r\npropaganda, and, as with his predecessors, the Cesars of Rome, he\r\nsometimes really fancies that the establishment of his universal\r\nmonarchy is a great benefit to Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2301: De Tocqueville, \"L'Ancien régime et la Revolution.\" p.\r\n64 and following pages, also p.354 and following pages.--\"The Ancient\r\nRégime,\" p. 368.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2302: \"The Revolution,\" I., book I., especially pp. 16, 17,\r\n55, 61, 62-65.

At first, it is simply a classic reminiscence,\r\nas with his contemporaries; but suddenly it takes a turn and has an\r\nenvironment in his mind which is lacking in theirs, and which prevents\r\nthe idea from remaining a purely literary phrase. From the beginning\r\nhe speaks of Rome in the fashion of a Rienzi. (Proclamation of May\r\n20, 1796.) \"We are the friends of every people, and especially of the\r\nBrutuses, the Scipios, and of the great men whom we have chosen as\r\nmodels. To re-establish the Capitol, to place there with honor the\r\nstatues of heroes who render it famous, to arouse the Roman people\r\nbenumbed by centuries of slavery, such will be the fruit of our\r\nvictories.\"--Fifteen months afterwards, on becoming master of Italy,\r\nhis historic meditations turn into positive ambition henceforth, the\r\npossession of Italy and of the Mediterranean is to be with him a central\r\nand preponderant idea. (Letter to the Directory, Aug. 16, 1797, and\r\ncorrespondence on the subject of Corsica, Sardinia, Naples, and Genoa;\r\nletters to the pasha of Scutari, to the Maniotes, etc.) \"The islands of\r\nCorfu, Zante, and Cephalonia are of more interest to us than all Italy\r\nput together.... The Turkish empire is daily tottering; the possession\r\nof these islands will enable us to support it as long as possible, or to\r\ntake our portion of it. The time is not remote when we shall feel that,\r\nfor the real destruction of England, we must get possession of Egypt.\"\r\nFormerly, the Mediterranean was a Roman lake; it must become a French\r\nlake. (Cf. \"Souvenirs d'un Sexagénaire,\" by Arnault, vol. IV., p.102,\r\non his dream, in 1798, of making Paris a colossal Rome.)--At this\r\nsame date, his conception of the State is fixed and wholly Roman.\r\n(Conversations with Miot, June 1797, and letter to Talleyrand, Sep. 19,\r\n1797.) \"I do not see but one thing in fifty years well defined, and\r\nthat is the sovereignty of the people.... The organization of the French\r\nnation is still only sketched out....The power of the government,\r\nwith the full latitude I give to it, should be considered as really\r\nrepresenting the nation.\" In this government, \"the legislative power,\r\nwithout rank in the republic, deaf and blind to all around it, would\r\nnot be ambitious and would no longer inundate us with a thousand chance\r\nlaws, worthless on account of their absurdity.\" It is evident that\r\nhe describes in anticipation his future senate and legislative\r\ncorps.--Repeatedly, the following year, and during the expedition into\r\nEgypt, he presents the Romans as an example to his soldiers, and views\r\nhimself as a successor to Scipio and Cæsar.--(Proclamation of June 22,\r\n1798.): \"Be as tolerant to the ceremonies enjoined by the Koran as you\r\nare for the religion of Moses and Jesus.

He relies for this\r\nespecially on his civil code: \"That is the great advantage of the\r\ncode;... it is what has induced me to preach a civil code and made me\r\ndecide on establishing it.\" (Letter to Joseph, King of Naples, June 5,\r\n1806.)--\"The code Napoleon is adopted throughout Italy.

OBJECT AND MERITS OF THE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. RECOVERY OF SOCIAL ORDER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Rule as the mass want to be ruled.\r\n\r\n     How Napoleon comprehends the sovereignty of the people.--His\r\n     maxim on the will of the majority and on the office of\r\n     government.--Two groups of prominent and obvious desires in\r\n     1799.\r\n\r\nHowever clear and energetic his artistic convictions may be, his mind\r\nis absorbed by the preoccupations of the ruler: It is not enough for him\r\nthat his edifice should be monumental, symmetrical, and beautiful. As he\r\nlives in it and derives the greatest benefit from it, he wants first\r\nof all that it should be fit to live in, habitable for Frenchmen of\r\nthe year 1800. Consequently, he takes into account the habits and\r\ndispositions of his tenants, the pressing and permanent wants. But these\r\nneeds must not be theoretic and vague, but verified and defined; for he\r\nis as accurate as he is shrewd, and deals only with positive facts.\r\n\r\n\"My political system,\" says he to the Council of State,[3101] \"is\r\nto rule men as the mass want to be ruled... By constituting myself a\r\nCatholic I put an end to the war in La Vendée; by turning into a Moslem\r\nI established myself in Egypt: by turning ultramontane[3102] I gained\r\nover the priests in Italy. Were I to govern a population of Jews, I\r\nwould restore the temple of Solomon. I shall speak just in this fashion\r\nabout liberty in the free part of St. Domingo; I shall confirm slavery\r\nin the Ile-de-France and even in the slave section of St. Domingo, with\r\nthe reservation of diminishing and limiting slavery where I maintain\r\nit, and of restoring order and keeping up discipline where I maintain\r\nfreedom. I think that is the way to recognize the sovereignty of the\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, in France, at this epoch, there are two groups of preponderant\r\ndesires which evidently outweigh all others, one dating back the past\r\nten years, and the other for a century or more: the question is how to\r\nsatisfy these, and the sagacious constructor, who estimates them\r\nfor what they are worth, combines to this end the proportions, plan,\r\narrangement, and entire interior economy of his edifice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. The Revolution Ends.\r\n\r\n     Necessities dating from the Revolution.--Lack of security\r\n     for Persons, Property, and Consciences.--Requisite\r\n     conditions for the establishment of order.--End of Civil\r\n     war, Brigandage, and Anarchy.--Universal relief and final\r\n     security.\r\n\r\nThe first of these two needs is urgent, almost physical. For the last\r\nten years, the government has not done its duty, or has ruled in a\r\ncontrary sense. By turns or at the same time its impotence and injustice\r\nhave been deplorable. It has committed or allowed too many outrages\r\non persons, property, and consciences. All in all the Revolution did\r\nnothing else, and it is time that this should stop. Safety and security\r\nfor consciences, property, and persons is the loud and unanimous outcry\r\nvibrating in all hears.[3103]--To calm things down, many novelties are\r\nrequired: To start with, the political and administrative concentration\r\njust described, a centralization of all powers in one hand, local powers\r\nconferred by the central power, and, to exercise this supreme power\r\na resolute chief, equal in intelligence to his high position. Next, a\r\nregularly paid army,[3104] carefully equipped, properly clothed and\r\nfed, strictly disciplined and therefore obedient and able to do its duty\r\nwithout wavering or faltering, like any other instrument of precision.\r\nAn active police force and gendarmerie kept on a tight rein.\r\nAdministrators independent of those under their jurisdiction, and\r\njudges independent of those due to be tried. All appointed, maintained,\r\nwatched, and restrained from above, as impartial as possible,\r\nsufficiently competent, and, in their official spheres, capable\r\nfunctionaries. Finally, freedom of worship, and, accordingly, a treaty\r\nwith Rome and the restoration of the Catholic Church, that is to say, a\r\nlegal recognition of the orthodox hierarchy and of the only clergy which\r\nthe faithful may accept as legitimate, in other words, the institution\r\nof bishops by the Pope, and of priests by the bishops.\r\n\r\nThis done, the rest is easily accomplished. A well-led army corps\r\nmarches along and tramples out the embers of the conflagration now\r\nkindling in the West, while religious toleration extinguishes the\r\nsmoldering fires of popular insurrection. Henceforth, there is an end\r\nto civil war.[3105] Regiments ready to act in harmony with the\r\nmilitary commissions[3106] purge the South and the valley of the Rhône;\r\nthenceforth, there are no more roving bands in the rural districts,\r\nwhile brigandage on a grand scale, constantly repressed, ceases, and\r\nafter this, that on a small scale. No more chouans, chauffeurs, or\r\nbarbets;[3107] The mail-coach travels without a guard, and the highways\r\nare safe.[3108] There is longer any class or category of citizens\r\noppressed or excluded from the common law, the latest Jacobin decrees\r\nand the forced loan have been at once revoked: noble or plebeian,\r\necclesiastic or layman, rich or poor, former émigré or former terrorist,\r\nevery man, whatever his past, his condition, or his opinions, now enjoys\r\nhis private property and his legal rights; he has no longer to fear the\r\nviolence of the opposite party; he may relay on the protection of the\r\nauthorities,[3109] and on the equity of the magistrates.[3110] So long\r\nas he respects the law he can go to bed at night and sleep tranquilly\r\nwith the certainty of awaking in freedom on the morrow, and with the\r\ncertainty of doing as he pleases the entire day; with the privilege of\r\nworking, buying, selling, thinking, amusing himself,[3111] going and\r\ncoming at his pleasure, and especially of going to mass or of staying\r\naway if he chooses. No more jacqueries either rural or urban, no more\r\nproscriptions or persecutions and legal or illegal spoliations, no\r\nmore intestine and social wars waged with pikes or by decrees, no more\r\nconquests and confiscations made by Frenchmen against each other. With\r\nuniversal and unutterable relief people emerge from the barbarous and\r\nanarchical régime which reduced them to living from one day to another,\r\nand return to the pacific and regular régime which permits them to count\r\non the morrow and make provision for it. After ten years of harassing\r\nsubjection to the incoherent absolutism of unstable despotism, here,\r\nfor the first time, they find a rational and stable government, or, at\r\nleast, a reasonable, tolerable, and fixed degree of it. The First\r\nConsul is carrying out his declarations and he has declared that \"The\r\nRevolution has ended.\"[3112]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Return of the Emigrés.\r\n\r\n     Lasting effect of revolutionary laws.--Condition of the\r\n     Émigrés.--Progressive and final amnesty.--They return.--They\r\n     recover a portion of their possessions.--Many of them enter\r\n     the new hierarchy.--Indemnities for them incomplete.\r\n\r\nThe main thing now is to dress the severe wounds it has made and which\r\nare still bleeding, with as little torture as possible, for it has cut\r\ndown to the quick, and its amputations, whether foolish or outrageous,\r\nhave left sharp pains or mute suffering in the social organism.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and ninety-two thousand names have been inscribed on the\r\nlist of émigrés[3113] the terms of the law, every émigré is civilly\r\ndead, and his possessions have become the property of the Republic;\" if\r\nhe dared return to France, the same law condemned him to death; there\r\ncould be no appeal, petition, or respite; it sufficed to prove identity\r\nand the squad of executioners was at once ordered out. Now, at the\r\nbeginning of the Consulate, this murderous law is still in force;\r\nsummary proceedings are always applicable,[3114] and one hundred\r\nand forty-six thousand names still appear on the mortuary list. This\r\nconstitutes a loss to France of 146,000 Frenchmen, and not those of\r\nthe least importance--gentlemen, army and navy officers, members of\r\nparliaments, priests, prominent men of all classes, conscientious\r\nCatholics, liberals of 1789, Feuillantists of the Legislative assembly,\r\nand Constitutionalists of the years III and V. Worse still, through\r\ntheir poverty or hostility abroad, they are a discredit or even a danger\r\nfor France, as formerly with the Protestants driven out of the country\r\nby Louis XIV.[3115]--To these 146,000 exiled Frenchmen add 200,000\r\nor 300,000 others, residents, but semi-proscribed:[3116] First, those\r\nnearly related and allied to each émigré, excluded by the law from\r\n\"every legislative, administrative, municipal and judicial function,\"\r\nand even deprived of the elective vote. Next, all former nobles or\r\nennobled, deprived by the law of their status as Frenchmen and obliged\r\nto re-naturalize themselves according to the formalities.\r\n\r\nIt is, accordingly, almost the entire elite of old France which\r\nis wanting in the new France, like a limb violently wrenched and\r\nhalf-detached by the unskillful and brutal scalpel of the revolutionary\r\n\"sawbones\"; for both the organ and the body are not only living, but\r\nthey are still feverish and extremely sensitive; it is important to\r\navoid too great irritation; inflammation of any kind would be dangerous.\r\nA skilful surgeon, therefore, must mark the places for the stitches, not\r\nforce the junctures, but anticipate and prepare for the final healing\r\nprocess, and await the gradual and slow results of vital effort and\r\nspontaneous renewal. Above all he must not alarm the patient. The First\r\nConsul is far from doing this; on the contrary his expressions are all\r\nencouraging. Let the patient keep quiet, there shall be no re-stitching,\r\nthe wound shall not be touched. The constitution solemnly declares that\r\nthe French people shall never allow the return of the émigrés,[3117]\r\nand, on this point, the hands of future legislators are already tied\r\nfast; it prohibits any exception being added to the old ones.--But,\r\nfirst, by virtue of the same constitution, every Frenchman not an émigré\r\nor banished has the right to vote, to be elected, to exercise every\r\nspecies of public function; consequently, twelve days later,[3118] a\r\nmere order of the Council of State restores civil and political rights\r\nto former nobles and the ennobled, to the kinsmen and relations of\r\némigrés, to all who have been dubbed émigrés of the interior and whom\r\nJacobin intolerance had excluded, if not from the territory, at least\r\nfrom the civic body: here are 200,000 or 300,000 Frenchmen already\r\nbrought back into political communion if not to the soil.--They had\r\nsuccumbed to the coup-d'état of Fructidor; naturally, the leading\r\nfugitives or those transported, suffering under the same coup-d'état,\r\nwere restored to political rights along with them and thus to the\r\nterritory--Carnot, Barthélémy, Lafont-Ladébat, Siméon, Poissy d'Anglas,\r\nMathieu Dumas, in all thirty-nine, designated by name;[3119] very soon\r\nafter. Through a simple extension of the same resolution, others of the\r\nFructidor victims, a crowd of priests huddled together and pining\r\naway on the Ile-de-Ré, the most unfortunate and most inoffensive of\r\nall.[3120]--Two months later, a law declares that the list of émigrés\r\nis definitely closed;[3121] a resolution orders immediate investigation\r\ninto the claims of those who are to be struck off the list; a second\r\nresolution strikes off the first founders of the new order of things,\r\nthe members of the National Assembly \"who voted for the establishment\r\nof equality and the abolition of nobility;\" and, day after day, new\r\nerasures succeed each other, all specific and by name, under cover of\r\ntoleration, pardon, and exception:[3122] on the 19th of October 1800,\r\nthere are already 1200 of them. Bonaparte, at this date, had gained the\r\nbattle of Marengo; the surgical restorer feels that his hands are\r\nmore free; he can operate on a larger scale and take in whole bodies\r\ncollectively. On the 20th of October 1800, a resolution strikes off\r\nentire categories from the list, all whose condemnation is too grossly\r\nunjust or malicious,[3123] at first, minors under sixteen and the wives\r\nof émigrés; next, farmers, artisans, workmen, journeymen and servants\r\nwith their wives and children and at last 18,000 ecclesiastics who,\r\nbanished by law, left the country only in obedience to the law. Besides\r\nthese, \"all individuals inscribed collectively and without individual\r\ndenomination,\" those already struck off, but provisionally, by local\r\nadministrations; also still other classes. Moreover, a good many\r\nemigrants, yet standing on the lists, steal back one by one into France,\r\nand the government tolerates them.[3124] Finally, eighteen months later,\r\nafter the peace of Amiens and the Concord at,[3125] a sénatus-consulte\r\nends the great operation; an amnesty relieves all who are not yet\r\nstruck off, except the declared leaders of the militant emigration, its\r\nnotables, and who are not to exceed one thousand; the rest may come back\r\nand enjoy their civic rights; only, they must promise \"loyalty to the\r\ngovernment established under the constitution and not maintain directly\r\nor indirectly any connection or correspondence with the enemies of the\r\nState.\" On this condition the doors of France are thrown open to them\r\nand they return in crowds.\r\n\r\nBut their bodily presence is not of itself sufficient; it is moreover\r\nessential that they should not be absent in feeling, as strangers and\r\nmerely domiciliated in the new society. Were these mutilated fragments\r\nof old France, these human shreds put back in their old places, simply\r\nattached or placed in juxtaposition to modern France, they would prove\r\nuseless, troublesome and even mischievous. Let us strive, then, to have\r\nthem grafted on afresh through adherence or complete fusion; and first,\r\nto effect this, they must not be allowed to die of inanition; they\r\nmust take root physically and be able to live. In private life, how\r\ncan former proprietors, the noblesse, the parliamentarians, the upper\r\nbourgeoisie, support themselves, especially those without a profession\r\nor pursuit, and who, before 1789, maintained themselves, not by their\r\nlabor, but by their income? Once at home, they can no longer earn their\r\nliving as they did abroad; they can no longer give lessons in French, in\r\ndancing, or in fencing.--There is no doubt but that the sénatus-consulte\r\nwhich amnesties them restores to them a part of their unsold\r\npossessions;[3126] but most of these are sold and, on the other hand,\r\nthe First Consul, who is not disposed to re-establish large fortunes for\r\nroyalists,[3127] retains and maintains the largest portion of what they\r\nhave been despoiled of in the national domain: all woods and forests of\r\n300 arpents[3128] and over, their stock and property rights in the\r\ngreat canals, and their personal property already devoted to the public\r\nservice. The effective restitution is therefore only moderate; the\r\némigrés who return recover but little more than one-twentieth of their\r\npatrimony, one hundred millions[3129] out of more than two milliards.\r\nObserve, besides, that by virtue even of the law and as admitted by the\r\nFirst Consul,[3130] this alms is badly distributed; the most needy and\r\nthe greatest number remain empty-handed, consisting of the lesser and\r\nmedium class of rural proprietors, especially of country gentlemen\r\nwhose domain, worth less than 50,000 francs, brings in only 2000 or 3000\r\nfrancs income;[3131] a domain of this size came within reach of a great\r\nmany purses, and hence found purchasers more readily and with greater\r\nfacility than a large holding; the State was almost always the seller,\r\nand thenceforth the old proprietor could make no further claim or\r\npretension.--Thus, for many of the émigrés, \"the sénatus-consulte of the\r\nyear X is simply a permit to starve to death in France \"and,[3132] four\r\nyears later,[3133] Napoleon himself estimates that \"40,000 are without\r\nthe means of subsistence.\" They manage to keep life and soul together\r\nand nothing more;[3134] many, taken in and cared for by their friends\r\nor relations, are supported as guests or parasites, somewhat through\r\ncompassion and again on humanitarian grounds. One recovers his silver\r\nplate, buried in a cellar; another finds notes payable to bearer,\r\nforgotten in an old chest. Sometimes, the purchaser of a piece of\r\nproperty, an honest man, gives it back at the price he paid for it,\r\nor even gratis, if, during the time he had held it, he had derived\r\nsufficient profit from it. Occasionally, when the adjudication happens\r\nto have been fraudulent, or the sale too irregular, and subject to legal\r\nproceedings, the dishonest purchaser does not refuse a compromise.\r\nBut these cases are rare, and the evicted owner, if he desires to dine\r\nregularly, will wisely seek a small remunerative position and serve\r\nas clerk, book-keeper or accountant. M. des Echerolles, formerly a\r\nbrigadier-general, keeps the office of the new line of diligences at\r\nLyons, and earns 1200 francs a year. M. de Puymaigre, who, in 1789, was\r\nworth two millions, becomes a contrôleur des droits réunis at Briey with\r\na salary of 2400 francs.--In every branch of the new administration\r\na royalist is welcome to apply for a post;[3135] however slightly\r\nrecommended, he obtains the place. Sometimes he even receives one\r\nwithout having asked for it; M. de Vitrolles[3136] thus becomes, in\r\nspite of himself, inspector of the imperial sheepfolds; this fixes his\r\nposition and makes it appear as if he had given in his adhesion to the\r\ngovernment.--Naturally, the great political recruiter singles out the\r\ntallest and most imposing subjects, that is to say, belonging to the\r\nfirst families of the ancient monarchy, and, like one who knows his\r\nbusiness, he brings to bear every means, constraint and seduction,\r\nthreats and cajoleries, supplies in ready money, promises of promotion\r\nwith the influence of a uniform and gold-lace embroidery.[3137] It\r\nmatters little whether the enlistment is voluntary or extorted; the\r\nmoment a man becomes a functionary and is enrolled in the hierarchy, he\r\nloses the best portion of his independence; once a dignitary and placed\r\nat the top of the hierarchy, he gives his entire individuality up, for\r\nhenceforth he lives under the eye of the master, feels the daily and\r\ndirect pressure of the terrible hand which grasps him, and he forcibly\r\nbecomes a mere tool.[3138] These historic names, moreover, contribute to\r\nthe embellishment of the reign. Napoleon hauls in a good many of them,\r\nand the most illustrious among the old noblesse, of the court of the\r\nrobe and of the sword. He can enumerate among his magistrates, M.\r\nPasquier, M. Séguier, M. Molé; among his prelates, M. de Boisgelin,\r\nM. du Barral, M. du Belley, M. de Roquelaure, M. de Broglie; among his\r\nmilitary officers, M. de Fézensac, M. de Ségur, M. de Mortemart, M.\r\nde Narbonne;[3139] among the dignitaries of his palace, chaplains,\r\nchamberlains and ladies of honor--the Rohan, Croy, Chevreuse,\r\nMontmorency, Chabot, Montesquiou, Noailles, Brancas, Gontaut, Grammont,\r\nBeauvau, Saint-Aignan, Montalembert, Haussonville, Choiseul-Praslin,\r\nMercy d'Argenteau, Aubusson de la Feuillade, and many others, recorded\r\nin the imperial almanac as formerly in the royal almanac.\r\n\r\nBut they are only with him nominally and in the almanac. Except\r\ncertain individuals, M. de las Cases and M. Philippe de Ségur, who gave\r\nthemselves up body and soul, even to following him to Saint Helena, to\r\nglorifying, admiring and loving him beyond the grave, the others are\r\nsubmissive conscripts and who remain more or less refractory spirits. He\r\ndoes nothing to win them over. His court is not, like the old court, a\r\nconversational ball-room, but a hall of inspection, the most sumptuous\r\napartment in his vast barracks; the civil parade is a continuation of\r\nthe military parade; one finds one's self constrained, stiff, mute and\r\nuncomfortable.[3140]\r\n\r\nHe does not know how to entertain as the head of his household, how\r\nto welcome guests and be gracious or even polite to his pretended\r\ncourtiers; he himself declares that[3141] \"they go two years without\r\nspeaking to him, and six months without seeing him; he does not like\r\nthem, their conversation displeases him.\" When he addresses them it is\r\nto browbeat them; his familiarities with their wives are those of the\r\ngendarme or the pedagogue, while the little attentions he inflicts upon\r\nthem are indecorous criticisms or compliments in bad taste. They know\r\nthat they are spied upon in their own homes and responsible for whatever\r\nis said there; \"the upper police is constantly hovering over all\r\ndrawing-rooms.\"[3142] For every word uttered in privacy, for any lack of\r\ncompliance, every individual, man or woman, runs the risk of exile or\r\nof being relegated to the interior at a distance of forty leagues.[3143]\r\nAnd the same with the resident gentry in the provinces; they are obliged\r\nto pay court to the prefect, to be on good terms with him, or at least\r\nattend his receptions; it is important that their cards should be seen\r\non his mantel piece.[3144] Otherwise, let them take heed, for it is he\r\nwho reports on their conduct to the minister Fouché or to Savary who\r\nreplaced him. In vain do they live circumspectly and confine themselves\r\nto a private life; a refusal to accept an office is unpardonable; there\r\nis a grudge against them if they do not employ their local influence in\r\nbehalf of the reign.[3145] Accordingly, they are, under the empire as\r\nunder the republic, in law as in fact, in the provinces as well as at\r\nParis, privileged persons the wrong way, a suspicious class under\r\na special surveillance\" and subject to exceptional rigor.[3146] In\r\n1808,[3147] Napoleon orders Fouché \"to draw up ... among the old and\r\nwealthy families who are not in the system... a list of ten in each\r\ndepartment, and of fifty for Paris,\" of which the sons from sixteen to\r\neighteen years of age shall be forced to enter Saint-Cyr and from thence\r\ngo into the army as second lieutenants. In 1813, still \"in the highest\r\nclasses of society,\" and arbitrarily selected by the prefects, he takes\r\nten thousand other persons, exempt or redeemed from the conscription,\r\neven the married, even fathers of families, who, under the title of\r\nguards of honor, become soldiers, at first to be slaughtered in his\r\nservice, and next, and in the mean time, to answer for the fidelity\r\nof their relatives. It is the old law of hostages, a resumption of the\r\nworst proceedings of the Directory for his account and aggravated for\r\nhis profit.--Decidedly, the imperial Régime, for the old royalists,\r\nresembles too much the Jacobin régime; they are about as repugnant to\r\none as to the other, and their aversion naturally extends to the whole\r\nof the new society.--As they comprehend it, they are more or less robbed\r\nand oppressed for a quarter of a century. In order that their hostility\r\nmay cease, the indemnity of 1825 is essential, fifty years of gradual\r\nadaptation, the slow elimination of two or three generations of fathers\r\nand the slow elimination of two or three generations of sons.\r\n\r\nNothing is so difficult as the reparation of great social wrongs.\r\nIn this case the incomplete reparation did not prove sufficient; the\r\ntreatment which began with gentleness ended with violence, and, as a\r\nwhole, the operation only half succeeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Education and Medical Care.\r\n\r\n     Confiscation of collective fortunes.--Ruin of the Hospitals\r\n     and Schools.\r\n\r\nOther wounds are not less deep, and their cure is not less urgent;\r\nfor they cause suffering, not only to one class, but to the whole\r\npeople--that vast majority which the government strives to satisfy.\r\nAlong with the property of the émigrés, the Revolution has confiscated\r\nthat of all local or special societies, ecclesiastic or laic, of\r\nchurches and congregations, universities and academies, schools and\r\ncolleges, asylums and hospitals, and even the property of the communes.\r\nAll these fortunes have been swallowed up by the public treasury, which\r\nis a bottomless pit, and are gone forever.--Consequently, all services\r\nthus maintained, especially charitable institutions, public worship and\r\neducation, die or languish for lack of sustenance; the State, which has\r\nno money for itself, has none for them. And what is worse, it hinders\r\nprivate parties from taking them in charge; being Jacobin, that is to\r\nsay intolerant and partisan, it has proscribed worship, driven nuns out\r\nof the hospitals, closed Christian schools, and, with its vast power,\r\nit prevents others from carrying out at their own expense the social\r\nenterprises which it no longer cares for.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the needs for which this work provides have never been so\r\ngreat nor so imperative. In ten years,[3148] the number of foundlings\r\nincreased from 23,000 to 62,000; it is, as the reports state, a deluge:\r\nthere are 1097 instead of 400 in Aisne, 1500 in Lot-et-Garonne, 2035 in\r\nla Manche, 2043 in Bouches-du-Rhône, 2673 in Calvados. From 3000 to\r\n4000 beggars are enumerated in each department and about 300,000 in all\r\nFrance.[3149] As to the sick, the infirm, the mutilated, unable to earn\r\ntheir living, it suffices, for an idea of their multitude, to consider\r\nthe régime to which the political doctors have just subjected France,\r\nthe Régime of fasting and bloodletting. Two millions of Frenchmen have\r\nmarched under the national flag, and eight hundred thousand have died\r\nunder it;[3150] among the survivors, how many cripples, how many with\r\none arm and with wooden legs! All Frenchmen have eaten dog-bread for\r\nthree years and often have not had enough of that to live on; over\r\na million have died of starvation and poverty; all the wealthy and\r\nwell-to-do Frenchmen have been ruined and have lived in constant fear\r\nof the guillotine; four hundred thousand have wasted away in prisons;\r\nof the survivors, how many shattered constitutions, how many bodies and\r\nbrains disordered by an excess of suffering and anxiety, by physical and\r\nmoral wear and tear![3151]\r\n\r\nNow, in 1800, assistance is lacking for this crowd of civil and military\r\ninvalids, the charitable establishments being no longer in a condition\r\nto furnish it. Under the Constituent Assembly, through the suppression\r\nof ecclesiastical property and the abolition of octrois, a large portion\r\nof their revenue had been cut off, that assigned to them out of octrois\r\nand the tithes. Under the Legislative Assembly and the Convention,\r\nthrough the dispersion and persecution of nuns and monks, they were\r\ndeprived of a body of able male and female volunteer servants who,\r\ninstituted for centuries, gave their labor without stint. Under the\r\nConvention, all their possessions, the real-estate and the debts due\r\nthem, had been confiscated;[3152] and, in the restitution to them of the\r\nremainder at the end of three years, a portion of their real-estate is\r\nfound to have been sold, while their claims, settled by assignats or\r\nconverted into state securities, had died out or dwindled to such an\r\nextent that, in 1800, after the final bankruptcy of the assignats and\r\nof the state debt, the ancient patrimony of the poor is two-thirds or\r\none-half reduced.[3153] It is for this reason that the eight hundred\r\ncharitable institutions which, in 1789, had one hundred thousand or\r\none hundred and ten thousand occupants, could not support more than\r\none-third or one-half of them; on the other hand, it may be estimated\r\nthat the number of applicants tripled; from which it follows that, in\r\n1800, there is less than one bed in the hospitals and asylums for six\r\nchildren, either sick or infirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Old and New.\r\n\r\n     Complaints of the Poor, of Parents, and of Believers.\r\n     --Contrast between old and new educational facilities.\r\n     --Clandestine instruction.--Jacobin teachers.\r\n\r\nUnder this wail of the wretched who vainly appeal for help, for nursing\r\nand for beds, another moan is heard, not so loud, but more extensive,\r\nthat of parents unable to educate their children, boys or girls, and\r\ngive them any species of instruction either primary or secondary.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the Revolution \"small schools\" were innumerable: in\r\nNormandy, Picardy, Artois, French Flanders, Lorraine and Alsace, in the\r\nIle-de-France, in Burgundy and Franche-Comté, in the Dombes, Dauphiny\r\nand Lyonnais, in the Comtat, in the Cévennes and in Béarn,[3154] almost\r\nas many schools could be counted as there were parishes, in all probably\r\ntwenty or twenty-five thousand for the thirty-seven thousand parishes\r\nin France, and all frequented and serviceable; for, in 1789, forty-seven\r\nmen out of a hundred, and twenty-six girls or women out of a hundred,\r\ncould read and write or, at least, sign their names.[3155]--And these\r\nschools cost the treasury nothing, next to nothing to the tax-payer, and\r\nvery little to parents. In many places, the congregations, supported\r\nby their own property, furnished male or female teachers,--Frères de la\r\nDoctrine Chrétienne, Frères de Saint-Antoine, Ursulines, Visitandines,\r\nFilles de la Charité, Sæurs de Saint-Charles, Sæurs de la Providence,\r\nSæurs de la Sagesse, Sæurs de Notre-Dame de la Croix, Vatelottes,\r\nMiramiones, Manettes du Tiers Ordre, and many others. Elsewhere, the\r\ncurate of the parish was obliged through a parish regulation to teach\r\nhimself, or to see that his vicar taught. A very large number of\r\nfactories or of communes had received legacies for maintaining a school;\r\nthe instructor often enjoyed, through an endowment, a métayer farm or a\r\npiece of ground; he was generally provided with a lodging; if he was a\r\nlayman he was exempt, besides, from the most onerous taxes; as sexton,\r\nbeadle, chorister or bell-ringer, he had small perquisites; finally,\r\nhe was paid for each child four or five sous[3156] a month; sometimes,\r\nespecially in poor districts, he taught only from All Saints' day down\r\nto the spring, and followed another occupation during the summer. In\r\nshort, his salary and his comfort were about those of a rural vicar or\r\nof a suitably paid curate.\r\n\r\nHigher education (éducation secondaire) was provided for in the same\r\nmanner, and still better by local and private enterprise. More than one\r\nhundred and eight establishments furnished it completely, and more than\r\nfour hundred and fifty-four partially.[3157] Like the others, and\r\nnot less liberally than the smaller schools, these were supported\r\nby endowments, some of which were very ample and even magnificent;\r\na certain upper school in the provinces, Rodez,[3158] possessed\r\ntwenty-seven thousand livres income, and one in Paris, Louis-le-Grand,\r\nan income of four hundred and fifty thousand livres, each of these,\r\nlarge or small, having its own distinct endowment, in real property,\r\nlands and houses, and in revenues on privileges derived from the\r\nhotel-de-ville, the octroi and from transportation lines.--And, in\r\neach of them, the scholarships, or half-scholarships, were numerous-six\r\nhundred alone in Louis-le-Grand. In total, out of the seventy-two\r\nthousand scholars in the kingdom, there were forty thousand for whom a\r\nhigh-school education was gratuitous or half-gratuitous; nowadays, it is\r\nless than five thousand out of seventy-nine thousand.[3159] The reason\r\nwhy is that, before 1789, the revenues were not only large, but\r\nthe expenses were small. The salary of a head-master, teacher, or\r\nassistant-teacher was not large, say four hundred and fifty, six\r\nhundred, nine hundred, or twelve hundred livres per annum at most, just\r\nenough for a single man to live on; in effect, most of the teachers were\r\npriests or monks, Benedictines, regular canons, Oratorians, the latter\r\nalone officiating in thirty colleges. Not subject to the expenses and\r\nnecessities which a family imposes, they were abstemious through\r\npiety, or at least through discipline, habit, and respect for persons;\r\nfrequently, the statutes of the school obliged them to live in\r\ncommon,[3160] which was much cheaper than living apart.--The same\r\neconomical accord is found with all the wheels, in the arrangement and\r\nworking of the entire system. A family, even a rural one, never lived\r\nfar away from a high-school, for there were high-schools in nearly all\r\nthe small towns, seven or eight in each department, fifteen in Ain,\r\nseventeen in Aisne.[3161] The child or youth, from eight to eighteen,\r\nhad not to endure the solitude and promiscuity of a civil barracks; he\r\nremained within reach of his parents. If they were too poor to pay the\r\nthree hundred francs board required by the school, they placed their son\r\nin a respectable family, in that of some artisan or acquaintance in the\r\ntown; there, with three or four others, he was lodged, had his washing\r\ndone, was cared for and watched, had a seat at the family table and by\r\nthe fireside, and was provided with light; every week, he received from\r\nthe country his supply of bread and other provisions; the mistress of\r\nthe house cooked for him and mended his clothes, the whole for two or\r\nthree livres a month.[3162]--Thus do institutions flourish that arise\r\nspontaneously on the spot; they adapt themselves to circumstances,\r\nconform to necessities, utilize resources and afford the maximum of\r\nreturns for the minimum of expense.\r\n\r\nThis great organization disappears entirely, bodily and with all its\r\npossessions, like a ship that sinks beneath the waves. The teachers\r\nare dismissed, exiled, transported, and proscribed; its property is\r\nconfiscated, sold and destroyed, and the remainder in the hands of the\r\nState is not restored and again applied to its former service. Public\r\neducation, worse treated than public charity, does not recover a\r\nshred of its former endowment. Consequently, in the last years of the\r\nDirectory, and even early in the Consulate,[3163] there is scarcely any\r\ninstruction given in France; in fact, for the past eight or nine years\r\nit has ceased,[3164] or become private and clandestine. Here and there,\r\na few returned priests, in spite of the intolerant law and with the\r\nconnivance of the local authorities, also a few scattered nuns, teach\r\nin a contraband fashion a few small groups of Catholic children; five or\r\nsix little girls around a disguised Ursuline nun spell out the alphabet\r\nin a back room;[3165] a priest without tonsure or cassock secretly\r\nreceives in the evening two or three youths whom he makes translate the\r\nDe Viris.--During the intervals, indeed, of the Reign of Terror, before\r\nthe 13th of Vendémiaire and the 18th of Fructidor, sundry schools spring\r\nup again like tufts of grass in a mowed pasture-ground, but only in\r\ncertain spots and meagerly; moreover, as soon as the Jacobin returns to\r\npower he stubbornly stamps them out;[3166] he wants to have teaching all\r\nto himself.--Now the institution by which the State pretends to replace\r\nthe old and free establishments makes a figure only on paper. One école\r\ncentrale in each department is installed or decreed, making eighty eight\r\non the territory of ancient France; this hardly supplies the place of\r\nthe eight or nine hundred high-schools (collèges), especially as these\r\nnew schools are hardly viable, being in ruin at the very start,[3167]\r\npoorly maintained, badly furnished, with no preparatory schools nor\r\nadjacent boarding-houses,[3168] the programme of studies being badly\r\narranged and parents suspicious of the spirit of the studies.[3169]\r\nThus, there is little or no attendance at most of the courses of\r\nlectures; only those on mathematics are followed, particularly on\r\ndrawing, and especially mechanical and geometrical drawing, probably\r\nby the future surveyors and engineers of roads and bridges, by building\r\ncontractors and a few aspirants to the École Polytechnique. As to\r\nthe other courses, on literature, history, and the moral sciences, as\r\ncomprehended by the Republic and imposed by it, these obtain not over a\r\nthousand auditors in all France; instead of 72,000 pupils, only 7000 or\r\n8000 seek superior education, while six out of seven, instead of\r\nseeking self-culture, simply prepare themselves for some practical\r\npursuit.[3170]\r\n\r\nIt is much worse with primary instruction. This task is given to the\r\nlocal authorities. But, as they have no money, they generally shirk this\r\nduty, and, if they do set up a school, are unable to maintain it.[3171]\r\nOn the other hand, as instruction must be laic and Jacobin, \"almost\r\neverywhere,\"[3172] the teacher is an outcast layman, a fallen Jacobin,\r\nsome old, starving party member, unemployed, foul-mouthed and of\r\nill-repute. Families, naturally, refuse to trust their children with\r\nhim; even when honorable, they avoid him; and the reason is that, in\r\n1800, Jacobin and scoundrel have become synonymous terms. Henceforth,\r\nparents desire that their children should learn to read in the catechism\r\nand not in the declaration of rights:[3173] as they view it, the old\r\nmanual formed polite and civilized youths and respectful sons; the\r\nnew one forms only insolent rascals and precocious, slovenly\r\nblackguards.[3174] Consequently, the few primary schools in which the\r\nRepublic has placed its people and imposed its educational system remain\r\nthree-quarters empty; in vain does she close the doors of those in\r\nwhich other masters teach with other books; fathers persist in their\r\nrepugnance and distaste; they prefer for their sons utter ignorance\r\nto unsound instruction.[3175]--A secular establishment, created and\r\nprovided for by twenty generations of benefactors, gave gratis, or at\r\na much lower rate, the first crumbs of intellectual food to more\r\nthan 1,200,000 children.[3176] It was demolished; in its place, a few\r\nimprovised and wretched barracks distributed here and there a small\r\nration of moldy and indigestible bread. Thereupon, one long, low murmur,\r\na long time suppressed, breaks out and keeps on increasing, that of\r\nparents whose children are condemned to go hungry; in any event, they\r\ndemand that their sons and daughters be no longer forced, under penalty\r\nof fasting, to consume the patent flour of the State, that is to say\r\na nauseous, unsatisfactory, badly-kneaded, badly-baked paste which, on\r\ntrial, proves offensive to the palate and ruinous to the stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Religion\r\n\r\n     The Spirit and Ministrations of Catholicism.--How the\r\n     Revolution develops a sense of this.\r\n\r\nAnother plaint is heard, deeper and more universal, that of all souls\r\nin which regret for their established church and forms of worship still\r\nsubsists or is revived.\r\n\r\nIn every religious system discipline and rites depend upon faith, for it\r\nis faith alone which suggests or prescribes these; they are the outcome\r\nand expansion of this; it attains its ends through these, and manifests\r\nitself by them; they are the exterior of which it is the interior; thus,\r\nlet these be attacked and it is in distress; the living, palpitating\r\nflesh suffers through the sensitive skin.--In Catholicism, this skin\r\nis more sensitive than elsewhere, for it clings to the flesh, not alone\r\nthrough ordinary adhesiveness, the effect of adaptation and custom,\r\nbut again through a special organic attachment, consisting of dogmatic\r\ndoctrine; theology, in its articles of belief, has here set up\r\nthe absolute necessity of the sacraments and of the priesthood;\r\nconsequently, between the superficial and central divisions of religion\r\nthe union is complete. The Catholic sacraments, therefore, are not\r\nmerely symbols; they possess in themselves \"an efficacious power,\r\na sanctifying virtue.\" \"That which they represent, they really work\r\nout.\"[3177] If I am denied access to them, I am cut off from the\r\nfountains to which my soul resorts to drink in grace, pardon, purity,\r\nhealth and salvation. If my children cannot be regularly baptized, they\r\nare not Christians; if extreme unction cannot be administered to my\r\ndying mother, she sets out on the long journey without the viaticum; if\r\nI am married by the mayor only, my wife and I live in concubinage; if\r\nI cannot confess my sins, I am not absolved from them, and my burdened\r\nconscience seeks in vain for the helping hand which will ease the too\r\nheavy load; if I cannot perform my Easter duties, my spiritual life is a\r\nfailure; the supreme and sublime act by which it perfects itself through\r\nthe mystic union of my body and soul with the body, soul, and divinity\r\nof Jesus Christ, is wanting.--Now, none of these sacraments are valid if\r\nthey have not been conferred by a priest, one who bears the stamp of\r\na superior, unique, ineffaceable character, through a final sacrament\r\nconsisting of ordination and which is conferred only on certain\r\nconditions; among other conditions, it is essential that this priest\r\nshould have been ordained by a bishop; among other conditions, it is\r\nessential that this bishop[3178] should have been installed by the Pope.\r\nConsequently, without the Pope there are no bishops; without bishops\r\nno priests; without priests no sacraments; without the sacraments no\r\nsalvation. The ecclesiastical institution is therefore indispensable\r\nto the believer. The canonical priesthood, the canonical hierarchy is\r\nnecessary to him for the exercise of his faith.--He must have yet more,\r\nif fervent and animated with true old Christian sentiment, ascetic and\r\nmystic, which separates the soul from this world and ever maintains it\r\nin the presence of God. Several things are requisite to this end:\r\n\r\n* First, vows of chastity, poverty and obedience, that is to say, the\r\nsteady and voluntary repression of the most powerful animal instinct and\r\nof the strongest worldly appetites;\r\n\r\n* Next, unceasing prayer, especially prayer in common, where the emotion\r\nof the prostrate soul increases through the emotion of the souls that\r\nsurround it; in the same degree, active piety, meaning by this the doing\r\nof good works, education and charity, especially the accomplishment of\r\nrepulsive tasks, such as attending the sick, the infirm, the incurable,\r\nidiots, maniacs and repentant prostitutes;\r\n\r\n* Finally, the strict daily rule which, a sort of rigorous and minute\r\ncountersign, enjoining and compelling the repetition of the same acts\r\nat the same hours, renders habit the auxiliary of will, adds mechanical\r\nenthusiasm to a serious determination, and ends in making the task easy.\r\n\r\nHence, communities of men and of women, congregations and convents,\r\nthese likewise, the same as the sacraments, the priesthood and the\r\nhierarchy, form a body along with belief and thus constitute the\r\ninseparable organs of faith.\r\n\r\nBefore 1789, the ignorant or indifferent Catholic, the peasant at his\r\nplow, the artisan at his work-bench, the good wife attending to her\r\nhousehold, were unconscious of this innermost suture. Thanks to the\r\nRevolution, they have acquired the sentiment of it and even the physical\r\nsensation. They had never asked themselves in what respect orthodoxy\r\ndiffered from schism, nor how positive religion was opposed to natural\r\nreligion; it is the civil organization of the clergy which has led\r\nthem to distinguish the difference between the unsworn curé and the\r\ninterloper, between the right mass and the wrong mass; it is the\r\nprohibition of the mass which has led them to comprehend its importance;\r\nit is the revolutionary government which has transformed them into\r\ntheologians and canonists.[3179] Compelled, under the Reign of Terror,\r\nto sing and dance before the goddess Reason, and next, in the temple of\r\nthe \"Étre Supreme,\" subjected, under the Directory, to the new-fangled\r\nrepublican calendar, and to the insipidity of the decade festivals,\r\nthey have measured, with their own eyes, the distance which separates\r\na present, personal, incarnate deity, redeemer and savior, from a deity\r\nwithout form or substance, or, in any event, absent; a living, revealed,\r\nand time-honored religion, and an abstract, manufactured, improvised\r\nreligion; their spontaneous worship, which is an act of faith, and a\r\nworship imposed on them which is only frigid parade; their priest, in\r\na surplice, sworn to continence, delegated from on high to open out to\r\nthem the infinite perspectives of heaven or hell beyond the grave, and\r\nthe republican substitute, officiating in a municipal scarf, Peter or\r\nPaul, a lay-man like themselves, more or less married and convivialist,\r\nsent from Paris to preach a course of Jacobin morality.[3180]--Their\r\nattachment to their clergy, to the entire body regular and secular, is\r\ndue to this contrast. Previously, they were not always well-disposed to\r\nit; the peasantry, nowhere, were content to pay tithes, and the artisan,\r\nas well as the peasant, regarded the idle, well-endowed, meditative\r\nmonks as but little more than so many fat drones. The man of the people\r\nin France, by virtue of being a Gaul, has a dry, limited imagination;\r\nhe is not inclined to veneration, but is rather mocking, critical and\r\ninsubordinate at the powers above him, with a hereditary undertone of\r\ndistrust and envy at every man who wears a cloth suit and who eats and\r\ndrinks without doing manual labor.--At this time, his clergy do not\r\nexcite his envy, but his pity; monks and nuns, cure's and prelates,\r\nroofless, without bread, imprisoned, transported, guillotined, or, at\r\nbest, fugitives, hunted down and more unfortunate than wild beasts--it\r\nis he who, during the persecutions of the years II, IV and VI, harbors\r\nthem, conceals them, lodges them and feeds them. He sees them suffering\r\nfor their faith, which is his faith, and, before their constancy, equal\r\nto that of the legendary martyrs, his indifference changes into respect\r\nand next into zeal. From the year IV,[3181] the orthodox priests have\r\nagain recovered their place and ascendancy in his soul which the creed\r\nassigns to them; they have again become his serviceable guides, his\r\naccepted directors, the only warranted interpreters of Christian truth,\r\nthe only authorized dispensers and ministers of divine grace. He attends\r\ntheir mass immediately on their return and will put up with no other.\r\nBrutalized as he may be, or indifferent and dull, and his mind filled\r\nwith nothing but animal concerns, he needs them;[3182] he misses their\r\nsolemnities, the great festivals, the Sunday; and this privation is a\r\nperiodical want both for eyes and ears; he misses the ceremonial, the\r\nlights, the chants, the ringing of the bells, the morning and evening\r\nAngelus.--Thus, whether he knows it or not, his heart and senses are\r\nCatholic[3183] and he demands the old church back again. Before the\r\nRevolution, this church lived on its own revenues; 70,000 priests,\r\n37,000 nuns, 23,000 monks, supported by endowments, cost the State\r\nnothing, and scarcely anything to the tax-payer; at any rate, they cost\r\nnothing to the actual, existing tax-payer not even the tithes, for,\r\nestablished many centuries ago, the tithes were a tax on the soil, not\r\non the owner in possession, nor on the farmer who tilled the ground, who\r\nhas purchased or hired it with this tax deducted. In any case, the real\r\nproperty of the Church belonged to it, without prejudice to anybody,\r\nthrough the strongest legal and most legitimate of property titles,\r\nthe last will and testament of thousands of the dead, its founders and\r\nbenefactors. All is taken from it, even the houses of prayer which,\r\nin their use, disposition and architecture, were, in the most manifest\r\nmanner, Christian works and ecclesiastical objects, 38,000 parsonages,\r\n4000 convents, over 40,000 parochial churches, cathedrals and chapels.\r\nEvery morning, the man or woman of the people, in whom the need of\r\nworship has revived, passes in front of one of these buildings robbed of\r\nits cult; these declare aloud to them through their form and name what\r\nthey have been and what they should be to-day. This voice is heard\r\nby incredulous philosophers and former Conventionalists;[3184] all\r\nCatholics hear it, and out of thirty-five millions of Frenchmen,[3185]\r\nthirty-two millions are Catholics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. The Confiscated Property.\r\n\r\n     Reasons for the concordat.--Napoleon's economical\r\n     organization of the Church institution.--A good bargainer.\r\n     --Compromise with the old state of things.\r\n\r\nHow withstand such a just complaint, the universal complaint of the\r\ndestitute, of relatives, and of believers?--The fundamental difficulty\r\nreappears, the nearly insurmountable dilemma into which the Revolution\r\nhas plunged every steady government, that is to say the lasting effect\r\nof revolutionary confiscations and the conflict which sets two rights to\r\nthe same property against each other, the right of the despoiled owner\r\nand the right of the owner in possession. This time, again the fault is\r\non the side of the State, which has converted itself from a policeman\r\ninto a brigand and violently appropriated to itself the fortune of the\r\nhospitals, schools, and churches; the State must return this in money or\r\nin kind. In kind, it is no longer able; everything has passed out of\r\nits hands; it has alienated what it could, and now holds on only to the\r\nleavings. In money, nothing more can be done; it is itself ruined,\r\nhas just become bankrupt, lives on expedients from day to day and has\r\nneither funds nor credit. Nobody dreams of taking back property that is\r\nsold; nothing is more opposed to the spirit of the new Régime: not only\r\nwould this be a robbery as before, since its buyers have paid for it and\r\ngot their receipts, but again, in disputing their title the government\r\nwould invalidate its own. For its authority is derived from the same\r\nsource as their property: it is established on the same principle as\r\ntheir rights of possession and by virtue of the same accomplished facts\r\n\r\n* because things are as they are and could not be different,\r\n\r\n* because ten years of revolution and eight years of war bear down on\r\nthe present with too heavy a weight,\r\n\r\n* because too many and too deep interests are involved and enlisted on\r\nthe same side,\r\n\r\n* because the interests of twelve hundred thousand purchasers are\r\nincorporated with those of the thirty thousand officers to whom\r\nthe Revolution has provided a rank, along with that of all the new\r\nfunctionaries and dignitaries, including the First Consul himself, who,\r\nin this universal transposition of fortunes and ranks, is the greatest\r\nof parvenus and who must maintain the others if he wants to be\r\nmaintained by them.\r\n\r\nNaturally, he protects everybody, through calculation as well as\r\nsympathy, in the civil as in the military order of things, particularly\r\nthe new property-owners, especially the smaller and the average ones,\r\nhis best clients, attached to his reign and to his person through love\r\nof property, the strongest passion of the ordinary man, and through love\r\nof the soil, the strongest passion of the peasant.[3186] Their loyalty\r\ndepends on their security, and consequently he is lavish of guarantees.\r\nIn his constitution of the year VIII,[3187] he declares in the name\r\nof the French nation that after a legally consummated sale of national\r\nproperty, whatever its origin, the legitimate purchaser cannot be\r\ndivested of it.\" Through the institution of the Legion of Honor he\r\nobliges each member \"to swear, on his honor, to devote himself to the\r\nconservation of property sanctioned by the laws of the republic.\"[3188]\r\nAccording to the terms of the imperial constitution[3189] \"he swears\"\r\nhimself \"to respect and to enforce respect for the irrevocability of the\r\nsale of national possessions.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, a cannon-ball on the battle-field, an infernal machine\r\nin the street, an illness at home, may carry off the guarantor and the\r\nguarantees.[3190] On the other hand, confiscated goods preserve their\r\noriginal taint. Rarely is the purchaser regarded favorably in his\r\ncommune; the bargain he has made excites envy; he is not alone in his\r\nenjoyment of it, but the rest suffer from it. Formerly, this or that\r\nfield of which he reaps the produce, this or that domain of which he\r\nenjoys the rental, once provided for the parsonage, the asylum and\r\nthe school; now the school, the asylum and the parsonage die through\r\ninanition for his advantage; he fattens on their fasting. In his own\r\nhouse, his wife and mother often look melancholy, especially during\r\nEaster week; if he is old, or becomes ill, his conscience disturbs him;\r\nthis conscience, through habit and heredity, is Catholic: he craves\r\nabsolution at the last moment at the priest's hands, and says to himself\r\nthat, at the last moment, he may not probably be absolved.[3191] In\r\nother respects, he would find it difficult to satisfy himself that\r\nhis legal property is legitimate property; for, not only is it not so\r\nrightfully before the tribunal of conscience, but again it is not so\r\nin fact on the market; the figures, in this particular, are convincing,\r\ndaily and notorious. A patrimonial domain which brings in 3000 francs\r\nfinds a purchaser at 100,000 francs; alongside of this a national domain\r\nwhich brings in just as much, finds a purchaser only at 60,000 francs;\r\nafter several sales and resale, the depreciation continues and 40 % of\r\nthe value of the confiscated property is lost.[3192] A low, indistinct\r\nmurmur is heard, and reverberates from sale to sale, the muttering of\r\nprivate probity protesting against public probity, declaring to the\r\nnew proprietor that his title is defective; it lacks one clause and a\r\ncapital one, that of the surrender and cession, the formal renunciation,\r\nthe authentic withdrawal of the former owner. The State, the first\r\nseller, owes this voucher to the purchasers; let it procure this and\r\nnegotiate accordingly; let it apply for this to the rightful party, to\r\nthe owners whom it has dispossessed, to the immemorial and legitimate\r\nauthorities, I mean to the ancient corporations. These have been\r\ndissolved by revolutionary law and have no longer a representative who\r\ncan sign for them. Nevertheless, in spite of revolutionary law, one of\r\nthese corporations, with more vitality than the rest, still subsists\r\nwith its proper, if not legal, representative, its regular and\r\nundisputed chief. This chief is qualified and authorized to bind the\r\nbody; for, institutionally, he is supreme, and the conscience of all\r\nits members is in his hand. His signature is of the highest value; it\r\nis very important to obtain this, and the First Consul concludes the\r\nConcordat with the Pope.\r\n\r\nBy this Concordat, the Pope \"declares that neither himself nor his\r\nsuccessors shall in any manner disturb the purchasers of alienated\r\necclesiastical property, and that the ownership of the said property,\r\nthe rights and revenues derived there from, shall consequently remain\r\nin commutable in their hands or in those of their assigns.\"[3193]\r\nHenceforth the possession of this property is no longer a sin; at\r\nleast, it is not condemned by the spiritual authority, by that external\r\nconscience which, in Catholic countries, governs the inward conscience\r\nand often supplies its place; the Church, the moral head, removes with\r\nits own hands the moral scruple, the last small stone, troublesome\r\nand dangerous, which, lying underneath the cornerstone of lay society,\r\nbreaks the level of the entire structure and compromises the equilibrium\r\nof the new government.--In exchange, the State endows the Church. By\r\nthe same Concordat, and by the decrees which follow it, \"the\r\ngovernment[3194] ensures a suitable salary to bishops and cure's,\"\r\n15,000 francs to each archbishop, 10,000 francs to each bishop, 1500\r\nfrancs to each curé of the first class and 1000 francs to each curé of\r\nthe second class,[3195] also, later on,[3196] a maximum of 500 francs\r\nand a minimum of 300 francs to each assistant-priest or vicar. \"If\r\ncircumstances require it,[3197] the conseils-généraux of the large\r\ncommunes may grant to prelates or to curés an increase of salary out of\r\ntheir rural possessions or octrois.\" In all cases, archbishops, bishops,\r\ncurés and priests shall be lodged, or receive a lodging indemnity. So\r\nmuch for the support of persons.-As to real property,[3198] \"all the\r\nmetropolitan churches, cathedrals, parochial buildings and others, not\r\nalienated, and needed for the purposes of worship, shall be subject to\r\nthe disposition of the bishops.\"--The parsonages and gardens attached\r\nto these, not alienated, shall be given up to the curés and\r\nassistant-priests.\"--\"The possessions of the fabriques,[3199] not\r\nalienated, as well as the rentals they enjoyed, and which have not been\r\ntransferred, shall be restored to their original purpose.--As to the\r\noutlay and expenditure for worship,[31100] for the parochial center or\r\ncathedral, if its revenue is not sufficient, this shall receive aid\r\nfrom its commune or from its department; besides, \"an assessment of 10\r\n%.[31101] shall be laid on the revenues of all the real estate of\r\nthe communes, such as houses, woods, and rural possessions, for the\r\nformation of a common fund of subsidy,\" a general sum with which to\r\nprovide for \"acquisitions, reconstructions or repairs of churches,...\r\nseminaries and parsonages.\" Moreover,[31102] the government allows\r\n\"the French Catholics to make endowments, if so disposed, in favor of\r\nchurches.. . for the support of ministers and the exercise of worship,\"\r\nthat is to say to bequeath or make gifts to the fabriques or\r\nseminaries; in fine, it exempts seminarists, the future cure's, from the\r\nconscription.\r\n\r\nIt also exempts the \"Ignorantins,\" or brethren of the Christian schools,\r\nwho are the instructors of the common people. With respect to these and\r\nin relation to every other Catholic institution, it follows the same\r\nutilitarian principle, the fundamental maxim of laic and practical good\r\nsense: when religious vocations make their appearance and serve the\r\npublic, it welcomes and makes use of them; it grants them facilities,\r\ndispensations and favors, its protection, its donations, or at least\r\nits tolerance. Not only does it turn their zeal to account, but it\r\nauthorizes their association.[31103] Numerous societies of men or of\r\nwomen again spring up with the assent of the public authorities--the\r\n\"Ignorantins,\" the \"Filles de la Charité,\" the \"Seurs Hospitalières,\"\r\nthe \"Sæurs de Saint-Thomas,\" the \"Sæurs de Saint-Charles,\" the \"Sæurs\r\nVatelottes.\" The Council of State accepts and approves of their\r\nstatutes, vows, hierarchy, and internal regulations. They again\r\nbecome proprietors; they may accept donations and legacies. The\r\nState frequently makes presents to them. In 1808,[31104] thirty-one\r\ncommunities of Sisters of Charity, and mostly educational, thus obtain\r\nthe buildings and furniture they ask for, in full possession and\r\ngratuitously. The State, also, frequently supports them;[31105] it\r\nrepeatedly decides that in this asylum, or in that school, the \"sisters\"\r\ndesignated by the ancient foundation shall resume their work and be\r\npaid out of the income of the asylum or school. Better still, and\r\nnotwithstanding threatening decrees,[31106] Napoleon, between 1804 and\r\n1814, allows fifty-four communities to arise and exist, outside of the\r\ncongregations authorized by him, which do not submit their statutes to\r\nhim and which dispense with his permission to exist; he lets them live\r\nand does not disturb them; he judges[31107] \"that there is every sort\r\nof character and imagination, that eccentricities even should not be\r\nrepressed when they do no harm,\" that, for certain people, an ascetic\r\nlife in common is the only refuge; if that is all they desire they\r\nshould not be disturbed, and it is easy to feign ignorance of them; but\r\nlet them remain quiet and be sufficient unto themselves!--Such is the\r\nnew growth of the regular clergy alongside of the secular clergy, the\r\ntwo main branches of the Catholic trunk. Owing to the help, or to the\r\nauthorization, or to the connivance of the State, inside or outside of\r\nits limitations, both clerical bodies, legally or in reality, recover a\r\ncivil existence, and thus obtain, or at least nearly so, their physical\r\nmaintenance.[31108]\r\n\r\nAnd nothing more. Nobody, better than Napoleon, knows how to make a good\r\nbargain, that is to say, to give a little in order to gain a great\r\ndeal. In this treaty with the Church he tightens his purse-strings and\r\nespecially avoids parting with his ready money. Six hundred and fifty\r\nthousand francs for fifty bishops and ten archbishops, a little more\r\nthan four million francs for the three or four thousand cantonal curés,\r\nin all five million francs per annum, is all that the State promises to\r\nthe new clergy. Later on,[31109] he takes it on himself to pay those\r\nwho officiate in the branch chapels; nevertheless, in 1807, the entire\r\nappropriation for public worship costs the State only twelve million\r\nfrancs a year;[31110] the rest, as a rule, and especially the salaries\r\nof the forty thousand assistant-priests and vicars, must be provided\r\nby the fabriques and the communes.[31111] Let the clergy benefit by\r\noccasional contributions;[31112] let it appeal to the piety of believers\r\nfor its monstrances, chalices, albs and chasubles, for decorations\r\nand the other expenses of worship; they are not prohibited from being\r\nliberal to it, not only during the services, on making collections, but\r\nin their houses, within closed doors, from hand to hand. Moreover,\r\nthey have the right of making gifts or bequests before a notary, of\r\nestablishing foundations in favor of seminaries and churches; the\r\nfoundation, after verification and approval by the Council of State,\r\nbecomes operative; only,[31113] it must consist of state securities,\r\nbecause, in this shape, it helps maintain their value and the credit of\r\nthe government; in no case must it be composed of real estate;[31114]\r\nshould the clergy become land-owners it would enjoy too much local\r\ninfluence. No bishop, no curé must feel himself independent; he must be\r\nand always remain a mere functionary, a hired workman for whom the\r\nState provides work in a shop with a roof overhead, a suitable and\r\nindispensable atelier, in other words, the house of prayer well known in\r\neach parish as \"one of the edifices formerly assigned to worship.\"\r\nThis edifice is not restored to the Christian community, nor to\r\nits representatives; it is simply \"placed at the disposition of the\r\nbishop.\"[31115] The State retains the ownership of it, or transfers this\r\nto the communes; it concedes to the clergy merely the right of using\r\nit, and, in that, loses but little. Parish and cathedral churches in its\r\nhands are, for the most part, dead capital, nearly useless and almost\r\nvalueless; through their structure, they are not fitted for civil\r\noffices; it does not know what to do with them except to make barns of\r\nthem; if it sells them it is to demolishers for their value as building\r\nmaterial, and then at great scandal. Among the parsonages and\r\ngardens that have been surrendered, several have become communal\r\nproperty,[31116] and, in this case, it is not the State which loses its\r\ntitle but the commune which is deprived of its investment. In short, in\r\nthe matter of available real estate, land or buildings, from which the\r\nState might derive a rent, that which it sets off from its domain and\r\nhands over to the clergy is of very little account. As to military\r\nservice, it makes no greater concessions. Neither the Concordat nor\r\nthe organic articles stipulate any exemption for the clergy; the\r\ndispensation granted is simply a favor; this is provisional for the\r\nseminarians and only becomes permanent under ordination; now, the\r\ngovernment fixes the number of the ordained, and it keeps this down as\r\nmuch as possible;[31117] for the diocese of Grenoble, it allows only\r\neight in seven years.[31118] In this way, it not only saves conscripts,\r\nbut again, for lack of young priests, it forces the bishops to appoint\r\nold priests, even constitutionalists, nearly all pensioners on the\r\ntreasury, and which either relieves the treasury of a pension or\r\nthe commune of a subsidy.[31119]--Thus, in the reconstruction of the\r\necclesiastical fortune the State spares itself and the portion it\r\ncontributes remains very small: it furnishes scarcely more than\r\nthe plan, a few corner and foundation stones and the permission\r\nor injunction to build; the rest concerns the communes and private\r\nindividuals. They must exert themselves, continue and complete it, by\r\norder or spontaneously and under its permanent direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. Public Education.\r\n\r\n     State appropriations very small.--Toleration of educational\r\n     institutions.--The interest of the public in them invited.\r\n     --The University.--Its monopoly.--Practically, his\r\n     restrictions and conditions are effective.--Satisfaction\r\n     given to the first group of requirements.\r\n\r\nInvariably the government proceeds in the same manner with the\r\nreorganization of the other two collective fortunes.--As regards the\r\ncharitable institutions, under the Directory, the asylums and hospitals\r\nhad their unsold property restored to them, and in the place of what had\r\nbeen sold they were promised national property of equal value.[31120]\r\nBut this was a complicated operation; things had dragged along in the\r\nuniversal disorder and, to carry it out, the First Consul reduced and\r\nsimplified it. He at once sets aside a portion of the national domain,\r\nseveral distinct morsels in each district or department, amounting\r\nin all to four millions of annual income derived from productive\r\nreal-estate,[31121] which he distributes among the asylums, pro rata,\r\naccording to their losses. He assigns to them, moreover, all the rents,\r\nin money or in kind, due for foundations to parishes, curés, fabriques\r\nand corporations; finally, \"he applies to their wants\" various\r\noutstanding claims, all national domains which have been usurped by\r\nindividuals or communes and which may be subsequently recovered, \"all\r\nrentals be-longing to the Republic, the recognition and payment of which\r\nhave been interrupted.\"[31122] In short, he rummages every corner and\r\npicks out the scraps which may help them along; then, resuming and\r\nextending another undertaking of the Directory, he assigns to them,\r\nnot merely in Paris, but in many other towns, a portion of the product\r\nderived from theatres and octrois.[31123]--Having thus increased their\r\nincome, he applies himself to diminishing their expenses. On the one\r\nhand, he gives them back their special servants, those who cost the\r\nleast and work the best, I mean the Sisters of Charity. On the other\r\nhand, he binds them down rigidly to exact accounts; he subjects them\r\nto strict supervision; he selects for them competent and suitable\r\nadministrators; he stops, here as everywhere else, waste and peculation.\r\nHenceforth, the public reservoir to which the poor come to quench their\r\nthirst is repaired and cleaned; the water remains pure and no longer\r\noozes out; private charity may therefore pour into it its fresh streams\r\nwith full security; on this side, they flow in naturally, and, at this\r\nmoment, with more force than usual, for, in the reservoir, half-emptied\r\nby revolutionary confiscations, the level is always low.\r\n\r\nThere remain the institutions for instruction. With respect to these,\r\nthe restoration seems more difficult, for their ancient endowment is\r\nalmost entirely wasted; the government has nothing to give back but\r\ndilapidated buildings, a few scattered investments formerly intended\r\nfor the maintenance of a college scholarship,[31124] or for a village\r\nschoolhouse. And to whom should these be returned since the college and\r\nthe schoolhouse no longer exist?--Fortunately, instruction is an article\r\nof such necessity that a father almost always tries to procure it for\r\nhis children; even if poor, he is willing to pay for it, if not too\r\ndear; only, he wants that which pleases him in kind and in quality and,\r\ntherefore, from a particular source, bearing this or that factory stamp\r\nor label. If you want him to buy it do not drive the purveyors of it\r\nfrom the market who enjoy his confidence and who sell it cheaply; on the\r\ncontrary, welcome them and allow them to display their wares. This is\r\nthe first step, an act of toleration; the conseils-généraux demand\r\nit and the government yields.[31125] It permits the return of the\r\nIgnorantin brethren, allows them to teach and authorizes the towns to\r\nemploy them; later on, it graduates them at its University: in 1810,\r\nthey already possess 41 schoolhouses and 8400 pupils.[31126] Still more\r\nliberally, it authorizes and favors female educational congregations;\r\ndown to the end of the empire and afterwards, nuns are about the only\r\ninstructors of young girls, especially in primary education.--Owing to\r\nthe same toleration, the upper schools are likewise reorganized, and\r\nnot less spontaneously, through the initiative of private individuals,\r\ncommunes, bishops, colleges or pensionnats, at Reims, Fontainebleau,\r\nMetz, Évreux, Sorrèze, Juilly, La Fléche and elsewhere small seminaries\r\nin all the dioceses. Offer and demand have come together; instructors\r\nmeet the children half-way, and education begins on all sides.[31127]\r\n\r\nThought can now be given to its endowment, and the State invites\r\neverybody, the communes as well as private persons, to the undertaking.\r\nIt is on their liberality that it relies for replacing the ancient\r\nfoundations; it solicits gifts and legacies in favor of new\r\nestablishments, and it promises \"to surround these donations with the\r\nmost invariable respect.\"[31128] Meanwhile, and as a precautionary\r\nmeasure, it assigns to each its eventual duty;[31129] if the commune\r\nestablishes a primary school for itself, it must provide the tutor with\r\na lodging and the parents must compensate him; if the commune founds a\r\ncollege or accepts a lycée, it must pay for the annual support of the\r\nbuilding,[31130] while the pupils, either day-scholars or boarders, pay\r\naccordingly. In this way, the heavy expenses are already met, and the\r\nState, the general-manager of the service, furnishes simply a very small\r\nquota; and this quota, mediocre as a rule, is found almost null in fact,\r\nfor its main largess consists in 6400 scholarships which it establishes\r\nand engages to support; but it confers only about 3000 of them,[31131]\r\nand it distributes nearly all of these among the children of its\r\nmilitary or civilian employees This way a son's scholarship becomes\r\nadditional pay or an increased salary for the father; thus, the 2\r\nmillions which the State seems, under this head, to assign to the lycées\r\nare actually gratifications which it distributes among its functionaries\r\nand officials: it takes back with one hand what it be-stows with the\r\nother.--Having put this in place, it establishes the University. It is\r\nnot at its own expense, however, but at the expense of others, at the\r\nexpense of private persons and parents, of the communes, and above all\r\nat the expense of rival schools and private boarding-schools, of the\r\nfree institutions, and all this in favor of the University monopoly\r\nwhich subjects these to special taxation as ingenious as it is\r\nmultifarious.[31132] A private individual obtaining diploma to open on\r\na boarding school must pay from 200 to 300 francs to the University;\r\nlikewise, every person obtaining a diploma to open an institution shall\r\npay from 400 to 600 francs to the University; likewise every person\r\nobtaining permission to lecture on law or medicine.[31133] Every\r\nstudent, boarder, half-boarder or day-scholar in any school,\r\ninstitution, seminary, college or lycée, must pay to the University\r\none-twentieth of the sum which the establishment to which he belongs\r\ndemands of each of its pupils. In the higher schools, in the faculties\r\nof law, medicine, science and literature, the students pay entrance and\r\nexamination fees and for diplomas, so that the day comes when superior\r\ninstruction provides for its expenditures out of its receipts and even\r\nshows on its budget a net surplus of profit. The new University, with\r\nits expenses thus defrayed, will support itself alone; accordingly, all\r\nthat the State really grants to it, as a veritable gift, in ready cash,\r\nis 400,000 francs annual income on the public ledger, a little less than\r\nthe donation of one single college, Louis-le-Grand, in 1789.[31134]\r\nIt may even be said that it is exactly the fortune of the old college\r\nwhich, after being made use of in many ways, turned aside and with other\r\nmischance, becomes the patrimony of the new University.[31135] From\r\nhigh-school to University, the State has effected the transfer. Such is\r\nits generosity. This is especially apparent in connection with primary\r\ninstruction; in 1812, for the first time, it allows 25,000 francs for\r\nthis purpose, of which only 4,500 are received.[31136]\r\n\r\nSuch is the final liquidation of the great collective fortunes. A\r\nsettlement of accounts, an express or tacit bargain, intervenes between\r\nthe State and all institutions for instruction, worship and charity. It\r\nhas taken from the poor, from the young and from believers, 5 milliards\r\nof capital and 270 millions of revenue;[31137] it gives back to them, in\r\npublic income and treasury interest, about 17 millions per annum. As it\r\nhas the might and makes the law it has no difficulty in obtaining or in\r\ngiving itself its own discharge; it is a bankrupt who, having spent his\r\ncreditors money, bestows on these 6%. of their claim by way of alms.\r\n\r\nNaturally, it takes the opportunity to bring them under its strict and\r\npermanent dependence, in adding other claims to those with which the\r\nold monarchy had already burdened the corporations that administered\r\ncollective fortunes. Napoleon increases the weight of these chains and\r\nscrews them tighter. Not only does he take it upon himself to impose\r\norder, probity, and economy on the administrators, but, again, he\r\nappoints them, dismisses them, and prescribes or authorizes each of\r\ntheir acts. He puts words in their mouths; he wants to be the great\r\nbishop, the universal genius, the sole tutor and professor, in short,\r\nthe dictator of opinion, the creator and director of every political,\r\nsocial and moral idea throughout his empire.--With what rigidity and\r\npertinacious intent, with what variety and convergence of means, with\r\nwhat plenitude and certainty of execution, with what detriment and with\r\nwhat danger, present and to come, for corporations, for the public, for\r\nthe State, for himself, we shall see presently; he himself, living and\r\nreigning, is to realize this. For his interference, pushed to extremes,\r\nis to end in encountering resistance in a body which he considers as\r\nhis own creature, the Church: here, forgetting that she has roots of her\r\nown, deep down and out of his reach, he carries off the Pope, holds\r\nhim captive, sends cardinals into the interior, (Page 198/504)imprisons\r\nbishops, banishes priests, and incorporates seminarians in his\r\nregiments.[31138] He decrees the closing of all small seminaries,[31139]\r\nalienates forever the Catholic clergy like the royalist nobility,\r\nprecisely at the same moment and through the same absolutism, through\r\nthe same abuse of power, through the same recurrence to revolutionary\r\ntradition, to Jacobin infatuation and brutality, even to the frustration\r\nof his Concordat of 1802 as with his amnesty of 1802, even to\r\ncompromising his capital work of the attempted reconciliation and\r\nreunion of old France with the new France. His work, nevertheless,\r\nalthough incomplete, even interrupted and marred by himself, remains\r\nsubstantial and salutary. The three grand machines which the Revolution\r\nhad demolished with so little foresight, and which he had reconstructed\r\nat so little cost, are in working order, and, with deviations or\r\nshortcomings in result, they render to the public the required services,\r\neach its own, worship, charity and instruction. Full toleration and\r\nlegal protection to the three leading Christian cults, and even to\r\nJudaism, would of itself already satisfy the most sensitive of religious\r\ndemands; owing to the donation furnished by the State and communes and\r\nby private individuals, the necessary complement is not wanting.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic community, in particular, the most numerous of all,\r\nexercises and celebrates its system of worship in conformity with\r\nits faith, according to ecclesiastical canons under its own orthodox\r\nhierarchy; in each parish, or within reach of each parish, dwells one\r\nauthorized priest who administers valid sacraments; in his stole he says\r\nmass publicly in a consecrated edifice, plainly decorated at first but\r\ngradually beautified; not less publicly, various congregations of monks\r\nand nuns, the former in black robes and the \"sisters in wimples and\r\nwhite caps, serve in the schools and asylums.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in these well-equipped and well-governed asylums\r\nand hospitals, in the bureaux of charity, their resources are no longer\r\ninferior to their needs, while Christian charity and philanthropic\r\ngenerosity are constantly operating in all directions to fill the empty\r\ndrawers; legacies and private donations, after 1802, authorized by\r\nthe Council of State, multiply; we see them swelling the pages of the\r\n\"Bulletin des Lois.\"[31140] From 1800 to 1845, the hospitals and asylums\r\nare thus to receive more than 72 millions, and the charity bureaux over\r\n49 millions; from 1800 to 1878, all together will thus receive more\r\nthan 415 millions.[31141] The old patrimony of the poor is again\r\nreconstituted piece by piece; and on January 1st, 1833, asylums and\r\nhospitals, with their 51 millions of revenue, are able to support\r\n154,000 elderly and the sickly.[31142]\r\n\r\nLike public charity, public education again becomes effective; Fourcroy,\r\nafter 1806,[31143] lists 29 organized and full lycées; besides these,\r\n370 communal secondary schools and 377 private secondary schools are\r\nopen and receive 50,200; there are 25,000 children in the 4500 schools.\r\nFinally, in 1815,[31144] we find in France, restored to its ancient\r\nboundaries, 12 faculties of Law or Medicine with 6,329 students, 36\r\nlycées with 9000 pupils, 368 colleges with 28,000 pupils, 41 small\r\nseminaries with 5233 pupils, 1255 boarding-schools and private\r\ninstitutions with 39,623 pupils, and 22,348 primary schools with 737,369\r\nscholars; as far as can be gathered, the proportion of men and women\r\nable to read and to sign their name is raised under the empire up to and\r\nbeyond the figures[31145] it had reached previous to 1789.\r\n\r\nIn this manner are the worst damages repaired. The three new\r\nadministrative services, with a different set-up, do the job of the old\r\nones and, at the expiration of twenty-five years, give an almost equal\r\nreturn.--In sum, the new proprietor of the great structure sacked by\r\nthe Revolution has again set up the indispensable apparatus for warming,\r\nlighting and ventilation; as he knows his own interests perfectly,\r\nand is poorly off in ready money, he contributes only a minimum of the\r\nexpense; in other respects, he has grouped together his tenants\r\ninto syndicates, into barracks, in apartments, and, voluntarily or\r\ninvoluntarily, he has put upon them the burden of cost. In the meantime,\r\nhe has kept the three keys of the three engines in his own cabinet, in\r\nhis own hands, for himself alone; henceforth, it is he who distributes\r\nthroughout the building, on each story and in every room, light, air and\r\nheat. If he does not distribute the same quantity as before he at least\r\ndistributes whatever is necessary; the tenants can, at last, breathe\r\ncomfortably, see clearly and not shiver; after ten years of suffocation,\r\ndarkness and cold they are too well satisfied to wrangle with the\r\nproprietor, discuss his ways, and dispute over the monopoly by which he\r\nhas constituted himself the arbitrator of their wants.--The same thing\r\nis done in the material order of things, in relation to the highways,\r\ndikes, canals, and structures useful to the people: here also he repairs\r\nor creates through the same despotic initiative,\r\n\r\n* with the same economy,[31146]\r\n\r\n* the same apportionment of expense,[31147]\r\n\r\n* the same spontaneous or forced aid to those interested,\r\n\r\n* the same practical efficiency.[31148]\r\n\r\nSumming it up and if we take things as a whole, and if we offset the\r\nworse with the better, it may be said that the French people have\r\nrecovered the possessions they had been missing since 1789:\r\n\r\n* internal peace,\r\n\r\n* public tranquility,\r\n\r\n* administrative regularity,\r\n\r\n* impartial justice,\r\n\r\n* a strict police,\r\n\r\n* security of persons, property and consciences,\r\n\r\n* liberty in private life,\r\n\r\n* enjoyment of one's native land, and, on leaving it, the privilege of\r\ncoming back;\r\n\r\n* the satisfactory endowment, gratuitous celebration and full exercise\r\nof worship;\r\n\r\n* schools and instruction for the young;\r\n\r\n* beds, nursing and assistance for the sick, the indigent and for\r\nfoundlings;\r\n\r\n* the maintenance of roads and public buildings.\r\n\r\nSo that of the two groups of cravings which troubled men in 1800, the\r\nfirst one, that which dated from the Revolution, has, towards 1808 or\r\n1810, obtained reasonable satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3101: Roederer, III., 334 (August 6, 1800).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3102: The word means \"what is beyond the Alps\" but refers to a\r\nnumber of doctrines favoring the Pope's absolute authority.

Distributive Justice in Allotment of Burdens and Benefits.\r\n\r\n     Requirements previous to the Revolution.--Lack of\r\n     distributive justice.--Wrongs committed in the allotment of\r\n     social sacrifices and benefits.--Under the ancient Regime.\r\n     --During the Revolution.--Napoleon's personal and public\r\n     motives in the application of distributive justice.--The\r\n     circumstances favorable to him.--His principle of\r\n     apportionment.--He exacts proportion in what he grants.\r\n\r\nThe other group of needs, dating from long before 1789, involve wants\r\nwhich have survived the Revolution, because the Revolution has not\r\nsatisfied these. The first, the most tenacious, the most profound,\r\nthe most inveterate, the most frustrated of all is the desire for\r\ndistributive justice.--In political society, as in every other society,\r\nthere are burdens and benefits to be allotted. When the apportionment\r\nof these is unbiased, it takes place according to a very simple,\r\nself-evident principle:\r\n\r\nFor each individual the costs must be in proportion to the benefits and\r\nthe benefits to the costs, so that, for each one, the final expense\r\nand the final receipt may exactly compensate each other, the larger or\r\nsmaller share of expense being always equal to the larger or smaller\r\nshare of profits.\r\n\r\nNow, in France, this proportion had been wanting for many centuries; it\r\nhad even given way to the inverse proportion. If, towards the middle\r\nof the eighteenth century, two sum-totals of the budget, material and\r\nmoral, had been calculated, assets on one side and liabilities on the\r\nother:\r\n\r\nOn the one hand the sum of the apportionments exacted by the State,\r\ntaxes in ready money, enforced labor, military service, civil\r\nsubordination, every species of obedience and subjection, in short,\r\nevery sacrifice of leisure, comfort and self-esteem.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the sum of dividends distributed by the State of\r\nwhatever kind or shape, security for persons and property, use and\r\nconvenience of roads, delegations of public authority land liens on the\r\npublic treasury, dignities, ranks, grades, honors, lucrative salaries,\r\nsinecures, pensions, and the like, that is to say, every gratification\r\nbelonging to leisure, comfort, or pride--one might have concluded that\r\nthe more a man contributed to the receipts the less would his dividend\r\nbe, and the greater his dividend the less would he furnish to the\r\ngeneral contribution.\r\n\r\nConsequently, every social or local group consisted of two other\r\ngroups: a majority which suffered for the benefit of the minority, and\r\na minority which benefited at the expense of the majority, to such an\r\nextent that the privations of the greatest number defrayed the luxury\r\nof the small number. This was the case in all compartments as on every\r\nstory, owing to the multitude, enormity and diversity of honorific\r\nor useful privileges, owing to the legal prerogatives and effective\r\npreferences by which the court nobles benefited at the expense of the\r\nprovincial nobility,\r\n\r\n* the noblesse at the expense of plebeians,\r\n\r\n* the prelates and beneficiaries at the expense of poorly-paid curés and\r\nvicars,\r\n\r\n* the two highest orders of the clergy at the expense of the third,\r\n\r\n* the bourgeoisie at the expense of the people,\r\n\r\n* the towns at the expense of the rural districts,\r\n\r\n* this or that town or province at the expense of the rest,\r\n\r\n* the artisan member of a corporation at the expense of the free\r\nworkman,\r\n\r\nand, in general, the strong, more or less well-to-do, in league and\r\nprotected, at the expense of the weak, more or less needy, isolated and\r\nunprotected (indéfendus).[3201]\r\n\r\nOne hundred years before the Revolution a few clairvoyant, open-hearted\r\nand generous spirits had already been aroused by this scandalous\r\ndisproportion.[3202] Finally, everybody is shocked by it, for, in each\r\nlocal or social group, nearly everybody is a sufferer, not alone\r\nthe rural, the peasant, the artisan, and the plebeian, not alone the\r\ncitizen, the curé and the bourgeois notable,\" but again the gentleman,\r\nthe grand seignior, the prelate and the King himself.[3203] Each is\r\ndenouncing the privileges of all others that affect his interests, each\r\nstriving to diminish another's share in the public cake and to keep his\r\nown, all concurring in citing natural right and in claiming or accepting\r\nas a principle liberty and equality, but all concurring in misconception\r\nand solely unanimous in destroying and in allowing destruction,[3204] to\r\nsuch an extent that, at last, the attack being universal and no defense\r\nanywhere, social order itself perishes, entirely owing to the abuses of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOn the reappearance of the same abuses, the lack of distributive justice\r\nin revolutionary France became still more apparent than in monarchical\r\nFrance. Through a sudden transposition, the preferred of the former\r\nRégime had become the disgraced, while the disgraced of the former\r\nRégime had become the preferred; unjust favor and unjust disfavor still\r\nsubsisted, but with a change of object. Before 1789, the nation was\r\nsubject to an oligarchy of nobles and notables; after 1789, it\r\nbecame subject to an oligarchy of Jacobins big or little. Before\r\nthe Revolution, there were in France three or four hundred thousand\r\nprivileged individuals, recognizable by their red heels or silver\r\nshoe-buckles. After the Revolution, there were three or four hundred\r\nthousand of the privileged, recognizable by their red caps or their\r\ncarmagnoles.[3205] The most privileged of all, the three or four\r\nthousand verified nobles, presented at court and of racial antiquity,\r\nwho, by virtue of their parchments, rode in the royal carriages, were\r\nsucceeded by three or four thousand Jacobins of a fresh sprout, no less\r\nverified and accepted, who, by virtue of their civic patent, sat in\r\nthe club of the rue Saint-Honoré and the latter coterie was still\r\nmore dominant, more exclusive, more partial than the former one.\r\nConsequently, before the Revolution, the burden of taxation was light\r\nfor the rich or the well-to-do, crushing for the peasants or the common\r\npeople; after the Revolution, on the contrary, the peasants, the common\r\npeople, paid no more taxes,[3206] while from the rich and the well-to-do\r\nthe government took all, not alone their income but their capital.--On\r\nthe other hand, after having fed the court of Versailles, the public\r\ntreasury had to feed the rabble of Paris, still more voracious; and,\r\nfrom 1793 to 1796, the maintenance of this rabble cost it twenty-five\r\ntimes as much as, from 1783 to 1786, the maintenance of the court.[3207]\r\nFinally, at Paris as at Versailles, the subordinates who lived on the\r\nfavored spot, close to the central manger, seized on all they could get\r\nand ate much more than their allowance. Under the ancient Régime, \"the\r\nladies of honor, every time they travel from one royal country-house to\r\nanother, gain 80 %. on the cost of the journey,\" while the queen's first\r\nchambermaid gains, over and above her wages, 38,000 francs a year out\r\nof the sales of half-burnt candles.[3208] Under the new Régime, in the\r\ndistribution of food, \"the matadors of the quarter,\" the patriots of the\r\nrevolutionary committees, deduct their portions in advance, and a very\r\nample portion, to the prejudice of the hungry who await their turn, one\r\ntaking seven rations and another twenty.[3209] Thus did the injustice\r\nremain; in knocking it over, they had simply made matters worse; and had\r\nthey wished to build permanently, now was the time to put an end to it;\r\nfor, in every social edifice it introduced an imbalance. Whether the\r\nplumb-line deflects right or left is of little consequence; sooner or\r\nlater the building falls in, and thus had the French edifice already\r\nfallen twice, the first time in 1789, through imminent bankruptcy and\r\nhatred of the ancient Régime, and the second time in 1799, through an\r\nactual bankruptcy and hatred of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nAn architect like the French Consul is on his guard against a\r\nfinancial, social and moral danger of this sort. He is aware that, in a\r\nwell-organized society, there must be neither surcharge nor discharge,\r\nno favors, no exemptions and no exclusions. Moreover, \"l'Etat c'est\r\nlui;\"[3210] thus is the public interest confounded with his personal\r\ninterest, and, in the management of this double interest, his hands are\r\nfree. Proprietor; and first inhabitant of France in the fashion of\r\nits former kings, he is not obliged and embarrassed as they were by\r\nimmemorial precedents, by the concessions they have sanctioned or the\r\nrights they have acquired. At the public table over which he presides\r\nand which is his table, he does not, like Louis XV. or Louis XVI.,\r\nencounter messmates already installed there, the heirs or purchasers of\r\nthe seats they occupy,[3211] extending in long rows from one end of the\r\nroom to the other, each in his place according to rank, in an arm-chair,\r\nor common chair, or on a footstool, all being the legitimate and\r\nrecognized owners of their seats, all of them the King's messmates and\r\nall authorized by law, tradition and custom to eat a free dinner or pay\r\nfor it at less than cost, to find fault with the dishes passed around,\r\nto reach out for those not near by, to help themselves to what they want\r\nand to carry off the dessert in their pockets. At the new table there\r\nare no places secured beforehand. It is Napoleon himself who arranges\r\nthe table, and on sitting down, he is the master who has invited\r\nwhomsoever he pleases, who assigns to each his portion, who regulates\r\nmeals as he thinks best for his own and the common interest, and who\r\nintroduces into the entire service order, watchfulness and economy.\r\nInstead of a prodigal and negligent grand-seignior, here at last is\r\na modern administrator who orders supplies, distributes portions and\r\nlimits consumption, a contractor who feels his responsibility, a man of\r\nbusiness able to calculate. Henceforth, each is to pay for his portion,\r\nestimated according to his ration, and each is to enjoy his ration\r\naccording to his quota.--Judge of this by one example: In his own house,\r\ncustomarily a center of abuses and sinecures, there must be no more\r\nparasites. From the grooms and scullions of his palace up to its\r\ngrand officials, even to the chamberlains and ladies of honor, all his\r\ndomestics, with or without titles, work and perform their daily tasks\r\nin person, administrative or decorative, day or night, at the appointed\r\ntime, for exact compensation, without pickings or stealing and without\r\nwaste. His train and his parades, as pompous as under the old monarchy,\r\nadmit of the same ordinary and extraordinary expenses--stables, chapel,\r\nfood, hunts, journeys, private theatricals, renewals of plate and\r\nfurniture, and the maintenance of twelve palaces or châteaux. While,\r\nunder Louis XV., it was estimated that \"coffee with one roll for each\r\nlady of honor cost the King 2,000 livres a year,\" and under Louis XVI.,\"\r\nthe grand broth night and day\" which Madame Royale, aged two years,\r\nsometimes drank and which figured in the annual accounts at 5201\r\nlivres,[3212] under Napoleon \"in the pantries, in the kitchens, the\r\nsmallest dish, a mere plate of soup, a glass of sugared water, would\r\nnot have been served without the authorization or check of grand-marshal\r\nDuroc. Every abuse is watched; the gains of each are calculated and\r\nregulated beforehand.\"[3213] Consequently, this or that journey to\r\nFontainebleau which had cost Louis XVI. nearly 2 million livres, cost\r\nNapoleon, with the same series of fêtes, only 150,000 francs, while the\r\ntotal expense of his civil household, instead of amounting to 25 million\r\nlivres, remains under 3 million francs.[3214] The pomp is thus equal,\r\nbut the expense is ten times less; the new master is able to derive\r\na tenfold return from persons and money, because he squeezes the full\r\nvalue out of every man he employs and every crown he spends. Nobody has\r\nsurpassed him in the art of turning money and men to account, and he is\r\nas shrewd, as careful, as sharp in procuring them as he is in profiting\r\nby them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Equitable Taxation.\r\n\r\n     The apportionment of charges.--New fiscal principle and new\r\n     fiscal machinery.\r\n\r\nIn the assignment of public burdens and of public offices Napoleon\r\ntherefore applies the maxims of the new system of rights, and his\r\npractice is in conformity with the theory. For the social order, which,\r\naccording to the philosophers, is the only just one in itself, is at the\r\nsame time the most profitable for him: he adds equity because equity is\r\nprofitable to him.--And first, in the matter of public burdens, there\r\nshall be no more exemptions. To relieve any category of taxpayers or\r\nof conscripts from taxation or from military service would annually\r\nimpoverish the treasury by so many millions of crowns, and diminish\r\nthe army by so many thousands of soldiers. Napoleon is not the man to\r\ndeprive himself without reason of either a soldier or a franc; above\r\nall things, he wants his army complete and his treasury full; to supply\r\ntheir deficits he seizes whatever he can lay his hands on, both taxable\r\nmaterial as well as recruitable material. But all material is limited;\r\nif he took too little on the one hand he would be obliged to take too\r\nmuch on the other; it is impossible to relieve these without oppressing\r\nthose, and oppression, especially in the matter of taxation, is what,\r\nin 1789, excited the universal jacquerie, perverted the Revolution,\r\nand broke France to pieces.--At present, in the matter of taxation,\r\ndistributive justice lays down a universal and fixed law; whatever the\r\nproperty may be, large or small, and of whatever kind or form, whether\r\nlands, buildings, indebtedness, ready money, profits, incomes or\r\nsalaries, it is the State which, through its laws, tribunals, police,\r\ngendarmes and army, preserves it from ever ready aggression within and\r\nwithout; the State guarantees, procures and ensures the enjoyment of it.\r\nConsequently, property of every species owes the State its premium of\r\nassurance, so many centimes on the franc. The quality, the fortune, the\r\nage or the sex of the owner is of little importance; each franc assured,\r\nno matter in whose hands, must pay the same number of centimes, not one\r\ntoo much, not one too little.--Such is the new principle. To announce it\r\nis easy enough; all that is necessary is to combine speculative\r\nideas, and any Academy can do that. The National Assembly of 1789 had\r\nproclaimed it with the rattling of drums, but merely as a right and with\r\nno practical effect. Napoleon turns it into a reality, and henceforth\r\nthe ideal rule is applied as strictly as is possible with human\r\nmaterial, thanks to two pieces of fiscal machinery of a new type,\r\nsuperior of their kind, and which, compared with those of the ancient\r\nRégime, or with those of the Revolution, are masterpieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Formation of Honest, Efficient Tax Collectors\r\n\r\n     Direct real and personal taxation.--In what respect the new\r\n     machinery is superior to the old.--Full and quick returns.--\r\n     Relief to taxpayers.--Greater relief to the poor workman and\r\n     small farmer.\r\n\r\nThe collection of a direct tax is a surgical operation performed on\r\nthe taxpayer, one which removes a piece of his substance: he suffers on\r\naccount of this and submits to it only because he is obliged to. If the\r\noperation is performed on him by other hands he submits to it willingly\r\nor not. But that he should do it himself, spontaneously and with his own\r\nhands, it is not to be thought of. On the other hand, the collection of\r\na direct tax according to the prescriptions of distributive justice, is\r\na subjection of each taxpayer to an amputation proportionate to his bulk\r\nor, at least, to his surface; this requires delicate calculation and is\r\nnot to be entrusted to the patients themselves, for, not only are they\r\nsurgical novices and poor calculators, but, again, they are interested\r\nin calculating falsely. They have been ordered to assess their group\r\nwith a certain total weight of human substance, and to apportion to\r\neach individual in their group the lighter or heavier portion he must\r\nprovide. Everyone will soon understand that, the more that is cut\r\nfrom the others, the less will be required of him. And as each is more\r\nsensitive to his own suffering, although moderate, than to another's\r\nsuffering, even excessive, each, therefore, be his neighbor little or\r\nbig, is inclined, in order to unjustly diminish his own sacrifice by an\r\nounce, to add a pound unjustly to that of his neighbor.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, in the construction of the fiscal machine, nobody knew\r\nor had been disposed to take into account such natural and powerful\r\nsentiments; through negligence or through optimism, the taxpayer had\r\nbeen introduced into the mechanism in the quality of first agent; before\r\n1789, in the quality of a responsible and constrained agent; after 1789,\r\nin the quality of a voluntary and philanthropic agent. Hence, before\r\n1789, the machine had proved mischievous, and after 1789, impotent;\r\nbefore 1789, its working had been almost fatal,[3215] and after 1789\r\nits returns scarcely amounted to anything.[3216] Finally, Napoleon\r\nestablishes independent, special and competent operators, enlightened\r\nby local informers, but withdrawn from local influences. These are\r\nappointed, paid and supported by the central government, forced to\r\nact impartially by the appeal of the taxpayer to the council of the\r\nprefecture, and forced to keep correct accounts by the final auditing of\r\na special court (cour des comptes). The are kept interested, through\r\nthe security they have given as well as by commissions, in the integral\r\nrecovery of unpaid arrears and in the prompt returns of collected taxes.\r\nAll, assessors, auditors, directors, inspectors and collectors, being\r\ngood accountants, are watched by good accountants, kept to their\r\nduties by fear, and made aware that embezzlements, lucrative under the\r\nDirectory,[3217] are punished under the Consulate.[3218] They are soon\r\nled to consider necessity a virtue, to pride themselves inwardly on\r\ncompulsory rectitude, to imagine that they have a conscience and hence\r\nto acquiring one, in short, to voluntarily imposing on themselves\r\nprobity and exactitude through amour-propre and honorable scruples.--For\r\nthe first time in ten years lists of taxes are prepared and their\r\ncollection begun at the beginning of the year.[3219] Previous to 1789,\r\nthe taxpayer was always in arrears, while the treasury received only\r\nthree-fifths of that which was due in the current year.[3220] After\r\n1800, direct taxes are nearly always fully returned before the end of\r\nthe current year, and half a century later, the taxpayers, instead of\r\nbeing in arrears, are often in advance.[3221] To do this work required,\r\nbefore 1789, about 200,000 collectors, besides the administrative\r\ncorps,[3222] occupied one half of their time for two successive years\r\nin running from door to door, miserable and detested, ruined by their\r\nruinous office, fleecers and the fleeced, and always escorted by\r\nbailiffs and constables. Since 1800, from five thousand to six thousand\r\ncollectors, and other fiscal agents, honorable and respected, have only\r\nto do their office-work at home and make regular rounds on given days,\r\nin order to collect more than double the amount without any vexation and\r\nusing very little constraint. Before 1780, direct taxation brought\r\nin about 170 millions;[3223] after the year XI, it brought in 360\r\nmillions.[3224] By the same measure, an extraordinary counter-measure,\r\nthe taxable party, especially the peasant-proprietor, the small farmer\r\nwith nobody to protect him, diametrically opposite to the privileged\r\nclass, the drudge of the monarchy, is relieved of three-fourths of his\r\nimmemorial burden.[3225] At first, through the abolition of tithes and\r\nof feudal privileges, he gets back one-quarter of his net income, that\r\nquarter which he paid to the seignior and to the clergy; next, through\r\nthe application of direct taxation to all lands and to all persons,\r\nhis quota is reduced one-half. Before 1789, he paid, on 100 francs net\r\nincome, 14 to the seignior, 14 to the clergy, 53 to the State, and kept\r\nonly 18 or 19 for himself. After 1800, he pays nothing out of 100 francs\r\nof income to the seignior or to the clergy; he pays but little to the\r\nState, only 21 francs to the commune and department, and keeps 79 francs\r\nin his pocket.[3226]\r\n\r\nIf each franc insured pays so many centimes insurance premium, each\r\nfranc of manual gain and of salary should pay as many centimes as each\r\nfranc of industrial or commercial gain, also as each franc of personal\r\nor land revenue; that is to say, more than one-fifth of a franc, or 21\r\ncentimes.--At this rate, the workman who lives on his own labor, the\r\nday-laborer, the journeyman who earns 1 franc 15 centimes per day and\r\nwho works 300 days of the year, ought to pay out of his 345 francs wages\r\n69 francs to the public treasury. At this rate; the ordinary peasant\r\nor cultivator of his own field, owner of a cottage and a small tract\r\nof ground which he might rent at 100 francs a year, should pay into\r\nthe public treasury, out of his land income and from manual labor, 89\r\nfrancs.[3227] The deduction, accordingly, on such small earnings would\r\nbe enormous; for this gain, earned from day to day, is just enough to\r\nlive on, and very poorly, for a man and his family: were it cut down\r\none-fifth he and his family would be obliged to fast; he would be\r\nnothing but a serf or half-serf, exploited by the exchequer, his\r\nseignior and his proprietor. Because the exchequer, as formerly the\r\nproprietary seigniors, would appropriate to itself 60 days of labor out\r\nof the 300. Such was the condition of many millions of men, the great\r\nmajority of Frenchmen, under the ancient Régime. Indeed, the five direct\r\ntaxes, the taille, its accessories, the road-tax, the capitatim and the\r\nvingtièmes, were a tax on the taxpayer, not only according to the net\r\nrevenue of his property, if he had any, but again and especially \"of his\r\nfaculties\" and presumed resources whatever these might be, comprising\r\nhis manual earnings or daily wages.--Consequently, \"a poor laborer\r\nowning nothing,\"[3228] who earned 19 sous a day, or 270 livres a\r\nyear,[3229] was taxed 18 or 20 livres. Out of 300 days' work\r\nthere were 20 or 22 which belonged beforehand to the public\r\ntreasury.--Three-fifths[3230] of the French people were in this\r\nsituation, and the inevitable consequences of such a fiscal system have\r\nbeen seen--the excess of extortions and of suffering, the spoliation,\r\nprivations and deep-seated resentment of the humble and the poor. Every\r\ngovernment is bound to care for these, if not from compassion, at least\r\nthrough prudential considerations, and this one more than any other,\r\nsince it is founded on the will of the greatest number, on the repeated\r\nvotes of majorities counted by heads.\r\n\r\nTo this end, it establishes two divisions of direct taxation: one,\r\nthe real-estate tax, which has no bearing on the taxpayer without any\r\nproperty; and the other, the personal tax, which does affect him, but\r\nlightly: calculated on the rate of rent, it is insignificant on an\r\nattic, furnished lodging, hut or any other hovel belonging to a\r\nlaborer or peasant; again, when very poor or indigent, if the octroi is\r\nburdensome, the exchequer sooner or later relieves them; add to this the\r\npoll-tax which takes from them 1 franc and a half up to 4.50 francs per\r\nannum, also a very small tax on doors and windows, say 60 centimes per\r\nannum in the villages on a tenement with only one door and one window,\r\nand, in the towns, from 60 to 75 centimes per annum for one room above\r\nthe second story with but one window.[3231] In this way, the old tax\r\nwhich was crushing becomes light: instead of paying 18 or 20 livres for\r\nhis taille, capitatim and the rest, the journeyman or the artisan with\r\nno property pays no more than 6 or 7 francs;[3232] instead of paying\r\n53 livres for his vingtièmes for his poll, real and industrial tax, his\r\ncapitatim and the rest, the small cultivator and owner pays no more than\r\n21 francs. Through this reduction of their fiscal charges (corvée) and\r\nthrough the augmentation of their day wages, poor people, or those\r\nbadly off, who depended on the hard and steady labor of their hands,\r\nthe plowmen, masons, carpenters, weavers, blacksmiths, wheelwrights and\r\nporters, every hired man and artisan, in short, all the laborious and\r\ntough hands, again became almost free; these formerly owed, out of their\r\n300 working days, from 20 to 59 to the exchequer; they now owe only\r\nfrom 6 to 19,[3233] and thus gain from 14 to 40 free days during which,\r\ninstead of working for the exchequer, they work for themselves.--The\r\nreader may estimate the value to a small household of such an\r\nalleviation of the burden of discomfort and care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Various Taxes.\r\n\r\n     Other direct taxes.--Tax on business licenses.--Tax on\r\n     real-estate transactions.--The earnings of manual labor almost\r\n     exempt from direct taxation.--Compensation on another side.\r\n     --Indirect taxation.--In what respect the new machinery is\r\n     superior to the old.--Summary effect of the new fiscal\r\n     régime.--Increased receipts of the public treasury.--Lighter\r\n     burdens of the taxpayer.--Change in the condition of the\r\n     small taxpayer.\r\n\r\nThis infraction of the principle of distributive justice is in favor\r\nof the poor. Through the almost complete exemption of those who have no\r\nproperty the burden of direct taxation falls almost entirely on those\r\nwho own property. If they are manufacturers, or in commerce, they\r\nsupport still another burden, that of the license tax, which is a\r\nsupplementary impost proportioned to their probable gains.[3234]\r\nFinally, to all these annual and extra taxes, levied on the probable or\r\ncertain income derived from invested or floating capital, the exchequer\r\nadds an eventual tax on capital itself, consisting of the mutation\r\ntax, assessed on property every time it changes hands through gift,\r\ninheritance or by contract, obtaining its title under free donation\r\nor by sale, and which tax, aggravated by the timbre,[3235] is\r\nenormous[3236] since, in most cases, it takes 5, 7, 9, and up to 10\r\n1/2 % on the capital transmitted, that is to say, in the case of\r\nreal-estate, 2, 3 and even 4 years' income from it. Thus, in the first\r\nshearing of the sheep the exchequer cuts deep, as deep as possible; but\r\nit has sheared only the sheep whose fleece is more or less ample; its\r\nscissors have scarcely touched the others, much more numerous, whose\r\nwool, short, thin and scant, is maintained only by day-wages, the petty\r\ngains of manual labor.--Compensation is to come when the exchequer,\r\nresuming its scissors, shears the second time: it is the indirect tax\r\nwhich, although properly levied and properly collected, is, in its\r\nnature, more burdensome for the poor than for the rich and well-off.\r\n\r\nThrough this tax, and through to the previous action of customs-duties,\r\ntolls, octrois or monopolies, the State collects a certain percentage\r\non the price of various kinds of merchandise sold. In this way it\r\nparticipates in trade and commerce and itself becomes a merchant.\r\nIt knows, therefore, like all able merchants, that, to obtain large\r\nprofits, it must sell large quantities, that it must have a very large\r\nbody of customers, that the largest body is that which ensures to it and\r\nembraces all its subjects, in short, that its customers must consist\r\nnot only of the rich, who number merely tens of thousands, not only the\r\nwell-to-do, who number merely hundreds of thousands, but likewise the\r\npoor and the half-poor, who number millions and tens of millions. Hence,\r\nin the merchandise by the sale of which it is to profit, it takes care\r\nto include staple articles which everybody needs, for example, salt,\r\nsugar, tobacco and beverages in universal and popular use. This\r\naccomplished, let us follow out the consequences, and look in at the\r\nshops over the whole surface of the territory, in the towns or in the\r\nvillages, where these articles are disposed of. Daily and all day long,\r\nconsumers abound; their large coppers and small change constantly rattle\r\non the counter; and out of every large copper and every small piece of\r\nsilver the national treasury gets so many centimes: that is its share,\r\nand it is very sure of it, for it is already in hand, having received\r\nit in advance. At the end of the year, these countless centimes fill\r\nits cash-box with millions, as many and more millions than it gathers\r\nthrough direct taxation.\r\n\r\nAnd this second crop causes less trouble than the first one for the\r\ntaxpayer who is subject to it has less trouble and like-wise the State\r\nwhich collects it.--In the first place, the tax-payer suffers less. In\r\nrelation to the exchequer, he is no longer a mere debtor, obliged to pay\r\nover a particular sum at a particular date; his payments are optional;\r\nneither the date nor the sum are fixed; he pays on buying and in\r\nproportion to what he buys, that is to say, when he pleases and as\r\nlittle as he wants. He is free to choose his time, to wait until his\r\npurse is not so empty; there is nothing to hinder him from thinking\r\nbefore he enters the shop, from counting his coppers and small change,\r\nfrom giving the preference to more urgent expenditure, from reducing his\r\nconsumption. If he is not a frequenter of the cabaret, his quota, in\r\nthe hundreds of millions of francs obtained from beverages, is almost\r\nnothing; if he does not smoke or snuff, his quota, in the hundreds of\r\nmillions derived from the tax on tobacco, is nothing at all; because he\r\nis economical, prudent, a good provider for his family and capable of\r\nself-sacrifice for those belonging to him, he escapes the shearing of\r\nthe exchequer. Moreover, when he does come under the scissors, these\r\nhardly graze his skin; so long as tariff regulations and monopolies levy\r\nnothing on articles which are physically indispensable to him, as on\r\nbread in France, indirect taxation does not touch his flesh. In general,\r\nfiscal or protective duties, especially those which increase the price\r\nof tobacco, coffee, sugar, and beverages, do not affect his daily life,\r\nbut merely deprive him of some of its pleasures and comforts.--And, on\r\nthe other hand, in the collection of these duties, the exchequer may\r\nnot show its hand; if it does its business properly, the anterior\r\nand partial operation is lost sight of in the total operation which\r\ncompletes and covers this up; it screens itself behind the merchant. The\r\nshears are invisible to the buyer who presents himself to be sheared;\r\nin any event, he has no distinct sensation of them. Now, with the man of\r\nthe people, the common run of sheep, it is the positive, actual, animal\r\nsensation which is the cause of his cries, his convulsive shudders, and\r\ncontagious alarms and panics. As long as he is not being excited he can\r\nbe manipulated; at the utmost, he grumbles at the hard times; the high\r\nprices from which he suffers are not imputed to the government; he does\r\nnot know how to reckon, check off and consider for himself the surplus\r\nprice which the fiscal impost extorts from him. Even at the present day,\r\none might tell a peasant in vain that the State takes fifteen out of the\r\nforty sous which he pays for a pound of coffee, and five centimes out\r\nof every two sous he pays for a pound of salt; for him, this is simply a\r\nbarren notion, a vague calculation at random; the impression on his mind\r\nwould be very different if, standing before the grocer who weighs out\r\nhis coffee and salt, he saw with his own eyes, right before him, the\r\nclerk of the customs and of the salt-tax actually taking the fifteen\r\nsous and the five centimes off the counter.\r\n\r\nSuch are the good indirect taxes: in order that they may be correct,\r\nthat is to say, tolerable and tolerated, three conditions, as we see,\r\nare requisite. In the first place, the taxpayer, in his own interest,\r\nmust be free to buy or not to buy the merchandise taxed. Next, in the\r\ninterest of the taxpayer and of the exchequer, the merchandise must not\r\nbe so taxed as to be rendered too dear. After that, in the interest of\r\nthe exchequer, its interference must not be perceptible. Owing to\r\nthese precautions, indirect taxes can be levied, even on the smaller\r\ntaxpayers, without either fleecing or irritating them. It is for lack of\r\nthese precautions before 1789, when people were fleeced in such a\r\nclumsy way,[3237] that, in 1789, they first rebelled against indirect\r\ntaxation,[3238] against the meal-tax, the salt-tax, the tax on liquors,\r\nthe internal tariffs, and the town octrois, against fiscal officers,\r\nbureaux and registries, by murdering, pillaging, and burning, beginning\r\nin the month of March in Provence and after the 13th of July in Paris,\r\nand then throughout France, with such a universal, determined and\r\npersistent hostility that the National Assembly, after having vainly\r\nattempted to restore the suspended tax-levies and enforce the law on the\r\npopulace, ended in subjecting the law to the populace and in decreeing\r\nthe suppression of indirect taxation entirely.[3239]\r\n\r\nSuch, in the matter of taxation, is the work of the Revolution. Of\r\nthe two sources which, through their regular afflux, fill the public\r\nTreasury, and of which the ancient Régime took possession and managed\r\nbadly, violently, through loose and bungling measures, it has nearly\r\ndried up the first one, direct taxation, and completely exhausted the\r\nsecond one, indirect taxation. At present, as the empty Treasury must\r\nbe filled, the latter must be taken in hand the same as the former,\r\nits waters newly gathered in and gently conducted without loss. The\r\nnew government sets about this, not like the old one, in a rude,\r\nconventional manner, but as an engineer and calculator who knows the\r\nground, its inclination and other obstacles, in short, who comprehends\r\nhuman sensibility and the popular imagination.[3240]--And, first of all,\r\nthere is to be no more farming-out (of the collection of the revenues):\r\nthe State no longer sells its duties on salt or on beverages to a\r\ncompany of speculators, mere contractors, who care for nothing but\r\ntheir temporary lease and annual incomes, solely concerned with coming\r\ndividends, bleeding the tax-payer like so many leeches and invited to\r\nsuck him freely, interested in multiplying affidavits by the fines they\r\nget, and creating infractions, authorized by a needy government which,\r\nsupporting itself on their advances, places the public force at their\r\ndisposal and surrenders the people to their exactions. Henceforth, the\r\nexchequer collects for itself and for its own account. It is the same\r\nas a proprietor who, instead of leasing or renting out, improves his\r\nproperty and becomes his own farmer. The State, therefore, considers the\r\nfuture in its own interest; it limits the receipts of the current year\r\nso as not to compromise the receipts of coming years; it avoids ruining\r\nthe present tax-payer who is also the future taxpayer; it does not\r\nindulge in gratuitous chicanery, in expensive lawsuits, in warrants\r\nof execution and imprisonment; it is averse to converting a profitable\r\nlaborer into a beggar who brings in nothing, or into a prisoner for debt\r\nwho costs it something. Through this course, the relief is immense;\r\nten years previous to the Revolution,[3241] it was estimated that, in\r\nprincipal and in accessories, especially in costs of collection and in\r\nfines, indirect taxation cost the nation twice as much the king\r\nderived from it, that it paid 371 millions to enable him to receive\r\n184 millions, that the salt-tax alone took out of the pockets of the\r\ntaxpayer 100 millions for 45 millions deposited in his coffers. Under\r\nthe new government, fines became rarer; seizures, executions and sales\r\nof personal property still rarer, while the costs of collection, reduced\r\nby increasing consumption, are not to exceed one-twentieth in-stead\r\nof one-fifth of the receipts.[3242]--In the second place, the consumer\r\nbecomes free again, in law as in fact, not to purchase taxed goods. He\r\nis no longer constrained, as formerly, in the provinces subject to high\r\nsalt-tax, to accept, consume, and pay for duty-salt, 7 pounds per head\r\nat 13 sous the pound. Provincial, town or seignorial taxes on Bread,\r\na commodity which he cannot do without, no longer exist; there is no\r\npiquet, or duty on flour, as in Provence,[3243] no duties on the sale\r\nor of grinding wheat, no impediments to the circulation or commerce of\r\ngrain. And, on the other hand, through the lowering of fiscal\r\ncharges, in the suppression of internal duties, and the abolition of\r\nmultitudinous tolls, other commodities, apart from bread reached by a\r\ndifferent tax, now becomes affordable for those of small means. Salt,\r\ninstead of costing thirteen sous and over, no longer costs more than\r\ntwo sous the pound. A cask of Bordeaux wine no longer pays two hundred\r\nlivres before it is retailed by the tavern-keeper at Rennes.[3244]\r\nExcept in Paris, and even at Paris, so long as the extravagance of\r\nmunicipal expenditure does not increase the octroi the total tax on\r\nwine, cider and beer does not add, even at retail, more than 18 % to\r\ntheir selling price,[3245] while, throughout France, the vine-grower,\r\nor the wine-maker, who gathers in and manufactures his own wine, drinks\r\nthis and even his brandy, without paying one cent of tax under this\r\nheading.[3246]--Consequently, consumption increases, and, as there are\r\nno longer any exempt or half-exempt provinces, no more free salt\r\n(franc salé),[3247] no more privileges arising from birth, condition,\r\nprofession or residence, the Treasury, with fewer duties, collected or\r\ngained as much as before the Revolution: In 1809 and 1810, 20 millions\r\non tobacco, 54 millions on salt, 100 millions on liquors, and then, as\r\nthe taxpayer became richer and spent more, still larger and larger\r\nsums: in 1884, 305 millions on tobacco: in 1885, 429 millions on\r\nliquors,[3248] without counting another 100 millions again raised on\r\nliquors through town octrois.--And lastly, the exchequer, with extreme\r\nprudence, keeps out of sight and succeeds in almost saving the taxpayer\r\nfrom contact with, or the presence of, its agents. There is an end to\r\na domestic inquisition. The excise man no longer pounces in on the\r\nhousewife to taste the pickle, to find out whether the ham has been\r\ncured with bogus salt, to certify that all the dutiable salt has been\r\nused in \"the pot and the salt-cellar.\" The wine-inspector no longer\r\ncomes suddenly on the wine-grower, or even on the consumer, to gauge his\r\ncasks, to demand an account of what he drinks, to make an affidavit in\r\ncase of deficit or over-consumption, to impose a fine should a bottle\r\nhave been given to a sick person or to a poor one. The 50,000 customs\r\nofficers or clerks of the ferme, the 23,000 soldiers without a uniform\r\nwho, posted in the interior along a line of 1200 leagues, guarded the\r\nheavily taxed salt districts against the provinces which were less\r\ntaxed, redeemed or free, the innumerable employees at the barriers,\r\nforming a confused and complicated band around each province, town,\r\ndistrict or canton, levying on twenty or thirty different sorts of\r\nmerchandise forty-five principal duties, general, provincial, or\r\nmunicipal, and nearly sixteen hundred tolls, in short, the entire body\r\nof officials of the old system of indirect taxation has almost wholly\r\ndisappeared. Save at the entrance of towns, and for the octroi the eye\r\nno longer encounters an official clerk. The carters who, from Roussillon\r\nor Languedoc, transport a cask of wine to Paris, are no longer subject\r\nto his levies, humiliations and moods in twenty different places, nor\r\nto ascribe to him the dozen or fifteen days' useless extension of their\r\ntrip due to his predecessor, and during which they had to wait in his\r\noffice until he wrote a receipt or a permit. There is scarcely any one\r\nnow but the inn-keeper who sees his green uniform on his premises. After\r\nthe abolition of the house-inventory, nearly two millions of proprietors\r\nand wine métayers are forever free of his visits;[3249] from now on, for\r\nconsumers, especially for the people, he seems absent and non existent.\r\nIn effect, he has been transferred one or two hundred leagues off, to\r\nthe salt-establishments in the interior and on the coasts, and on\r\nthe frontier. There only is the system at fault, nakedly exposing\r\nits vice,--a war against exchanges, the proscription of international\r\ncommerce, prohibition pushed to extreme, the continental blockade,\r\nan inquisition of 20,000 customs officials, the hostility of 100,000\r\ndefrauders, the brutal destruction of seized goods, an augmentation\r\nin price of 100 % on cottons and 400% on sugar, a dearth of colonial\r\narticles, privation to the consumer, the ruin of the manufacturer and\r\ntrader, and accumulated bankruptcies one after the other in 1811 in all\r\nthe large towns from Hamburg to Rome.[3250] This vice, however, belongs\r\nto the militant policy and personal character of the master; the error\r\nthat taints the external side of his fiscal system does not reach\r\nthe internal side. After him, under pacific reigns, it is gradually\r\nmodified; prohibition gives way to protection and then changes from\r\nexcessive protection to limited protection. France remains, along with\r\nsecondary improvements and partial amendments, on the course marked out\r\nby the Consulate and the Empire; this course, in all its main lines,\r\nis clearly traced, straight, and yet adapted to all things, by the\r\nplurality, establishment, distribution, rate of taxation and returns of\r\nthe various direct and indirect taxes, nearly in conformity with the\r\nnew principles of political economy, as well as in conformity with the\r\nancient maxims of distributive justice, carefully directed between the\r\ntwo important interests that have to be cared for, that of the people\r\nwho pays and of the State which collects.\r\n\r\nConsider, in effect, what both have gained.--In 1789, the State had\r\na revenue of only 475 millions; afterwards, during the Revolution,\r\nit scarcely collected any of its revenues; it lived on the capital it\r\nstole, like a genuine brigand, or on the debts it contracted, like a\r\ndishonest and insolvent bankrupt. Under the Consulate and during the\r\nfirst years of the Empire, its revenue amounts to 750 to 800 millions,\r\nits subjects being no longer robbed of their capital, while it no longer\r\nruns in debt.--In 1789, the ordinary taxpayer paid a direct tax to his\r\nthree former or late sovereigns, namely, to the King, the clergy and the\r\nseigniors, more than three-quarters of his net income. After 1800, he\r\npays to the State less than one-quarter, the one sovereign alone who\r\nreplaces the other three. We have seen how relief came to the old\r\ntaxable subject, to the rural, to the small proprietor, to the man\r\nwithout any property, who lived on the labor of his own hands; the\r\nlightening of the direct tax restored to him from 14 to 43 free days,\r\nduring which, instead of working for the exchequer, he worked for\r\nhimself. If married, and the father of two children over 7 years of age,\r\nthe alleviation of one direct tax alone, that of the salt-tax, again\r\nrestores to him 12 days more, in all from one to two complete months\r\neach year during which he is no longer, as formerly, a man doing\r\nstatute-work, but the free proprietor, the absolute master of his time\r\nand of his own hands.--At the same time, through the re-casting of\r\nother taxes and owing to the increasing price of labor, his physical\r\nprivations decrease. He is no longer reduced to consuming only the\r\nrefuse of his crop, the wheat of poor quality, the damaged rye, the\r\nbadly-bolted flour mixed with bran, nor to drink water poured over the\r\nlees of his grapes, nor to sell his pigs before Christmas because the\r\nsalt he needs is too dear.[3251] He salts his pork and eats it, and\r\nlikewise butcher's meat; he enjoys his boiled beef and broth on\r\nSunday; he drinks wine; his bread is more nutritious, not so black\r\nand healthier; he no longer lacks it and has no fear of lacking it.\r\nFormerly, he entertained a lugubrious phantom, the fatal image of famine\r\nwhich haunted him day and night for centuries, an almost periodical\r\nfamine under the monarchy, a chronic famine and then severe and\r\nexcruciating during the Revolution, a famine which, under the republic,\r\nhad in three years destroyed over a million of lives.[3252] The\r\nimmemorial specter recedes and vanishes; after two accidental and local\r\nrecurrences, in 1812 and 1817, it never again appears in France.[3253]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.

It is the\r\nRevolution which has rendered this so burdensome; formerly, it was\r\nlight, for, in principle, it was voluntary. The militia, alone, was\r\nraised by force, and, in general, among the country people; the\r\npeasants furnished men for it by casting lots.[3254] But it was simply\r\na supplement to the active army, a territorial and provincial reserve,\r\na distinct, sedentary body of reinforcements and of inferior rank which,\r\nexcept in case of war, never marched; it turned out but nine days of the\r\nyear, and, after 1778, never turned out again. In 1789, it comprised\r\nin all 72,260 men, and for eleven years their names, inscribed on the\r\nregisters, alone constituted their presence in the ranks.[3255] There\r\nwere no other conscripts under the monarchy; in this matter, its\r\nexactions were not great, ten times less than those of the Republic and\r\nof the Empire, since both the Republic and the Empire, using the same\r\nconstraint, were to levy more than ten times the number of drafted men\r\nor conscripts.[3256]\r\n\r\nAlongside of this militia body, the entire army properly so called, the\r\n\"regular\" troops were, under, the ancient Régime, all recruited by free\r\nenlistment, not only the twenty-five foreign regiments, Swiss, Irish,\r\nGermans, and Liégeois, but again the hundred and forty-five French\r\nregiments, 177 000 men.[3257] The enlistment, indeed, was not free\r\nenough; frequently, through the maneuvers of the recruiting-agent, it\r\nwas tainted with inveigling and surprises, and sometimes with fraud\r\nor violence; but, owing to the remonstrances due to the prevailing\r\nphilanthropic spirit, these abuses had diminished; the law of 1788\r\nhad suppressed the most serious of them and, even with its abuses, the\r\ninstitution had two great advantages.--The army, in the first place,\r\nserved as an issue: through it the social body purged itself of its bad\r\nhumors, of its overheated or vitiated blood. At this date, although the\r\nprofession of soldier was one of the lowest and least esteemed, a barren\r\ncareer, without promotion and almost without escape, a recruit was\r\nobtainable for about one hundred francs bounty and a \"tip\"; add to this\r\ntwo or three days and nights of revel in the grog-shop, which indicates\r\nthe kind and quality of the recruits; in fact, very few could be\r\nobtained except among men more or less disqualified for civil and\r\ndomestic life, incapable of spontaneous discipline and of steady labor,\r\nadventurers and outcasts, half-savage or half-blackguard, some of them\r\nsons of respectable parents thrown into the army in an angry fit, and\r\nothers again, regular vagabonds picked up in beggars' haunts, mostly\r\nstray workmen and loafers, in short, \"the most debauched, the most\r\nhot-brained, the most turbulent people in an ardent, turbulent and\r\nsomewhat debauched community.\"[3258] In this way, the anti-social class\r\nwas utilized for the public good. Let the reader imagine an ill-kept\r\ndomain overrun by a lot of stray curs that might prove dangerous: they\r\nare enticed and caught; a collar, with a chain attached to it, is put on\r\ntheir necks and they become good watch-dogs.--In the second place, this\r\ninstitution preserved to the subject the first and most precious of all\r\nliberties, the full possession and the unrestricted management of one's\r\nown person, the complete mastery of body and being. This was assured to\r\nhim, guaranteed to him against the encroachments of the State. It was\r\nbetter guaranteed than by the wisest constitution, for the institution\r\nwas a recognized custom accepted by everybody. In other words, it was a\r\ntacit, immemorial convention,[3259] between the subject and the State,\r\nproclaiming that, if the State had a right to draw on purses it had\r\nno right to draft persons: in reality and in fact, the King, in his\r\nprincipal function, was merely a contractor like any other; he undertook\r\nnatural defense and public security the same as others undertook\r\ncleaning the streets or the maintenance of a dike. It was his business\r\nto hire military workmen as they hired their civil workmen, by\r\nmutual agreement, at an understood price and at current market rates.\r\nAccordingly, the sub-contractors with whom he treated, the colonel and\r\ncaptains of each regiment, were subject as he was to the law of supply\r\nand demand; he allowed them so much for each recruit,[3260] to replace\r\nthose dropped out, and they agreed to keep their companies full. They\r\nwere obliged to procure men at their own risk and at their own expense,\r\nwhile the recruiting-agent whom they dispatched with a bag of money\r\namong the taverns, enlisted artillerymen, horsemen or foot-soldiers,\r\nafter bargaining with them, the same as one would hire men to sweep or\r\npave the street and to clean the sewers.\r\n\r\nAgainst this practice and this principle comes the theory of the\r\nContrat-Social. It declares that the people are sovereign. Now, in\r\nthis divided Europe, where a conflict between rival States is always\r\nimminent, sovereigns are military men; they are such by birth,\r\neducation, and profession, and by necessity; the title carries along\r\nwith it and involves the function. Consequently, the subject, in\r\nassuming their rights, imposes upon himself their duties; in his quota\r\n(of responsibility) he, in his turn, is sovereign; but, in his turn\r\nand in his person, he is a soldier.[3261] Henceforth, if he is born an\r\nelector, he is born a conscript; he has contracted an obligation of a\r\nnew species and of infinite reach; the State, which formerly had a claim\r\nonly on his possessions, now has one on his entire body; never does\r\na creditor let his claims rest and the State always finds reasons or\r\npretexts to enforce its claims. Under the threats or trials of invasion\r\nthe people, at first, had consented to pay this one; they regarded it\r\nas accidental and temporary. After victory and when peace came, its\r\ngovernment continues to enforce the claim; it becomes settled and\r\npermanent. After the treaties of Luneville and Amiens, Napoleon\r\nmaintains it in France; after the treaties of Paris and Vienna, the\r\nPrussian government is to maintain it in Prussia. One war after another\r\nand the institution becomes worse and worse; like a contagion, it has\r\nspread from State to State. At the present time, it has overspread the\r\nwhole of continental Europe and here it reigns along with its natural\r\ncompanion which always precedes or follows it, its twin-brother,\r\nuniversal suffrage. Each more or less conspicuously \"trotted out\" and\r\ndragging the other along, more or less incomplete and disguised, both\r\nbeing the blind and formidable leaders or regulators of future history,\r\none thrusting a ballot into the hands of every adult, and the other\r\nputting a soldier's knapsack on every adult's back:\r\n\r\n* with what promises of massacre and bankruptcy for the twentieth\r\ncentury,\r\n\r\n* with what exasperation of international rancor and distrust,\r\n\r\n* with what waste of human labor,\r\n\r\n* through what perversion of productive discoveries,\r\n\r\n* through what perfection of destructive appliances,\r\n\r\n* through what a recoil to the lower and most unwholesome forms of old\r\nmilitant societies,\r\n\r\n* through what retrograde steps towards brutal and selfish instincts,\r\n\r\n* towards the sentiments, habits and morality of the antique city and of\r\nthe barbarous tribe\r\n\r\nis only too well known.[3262] It is sufficient for us to place the two\r\nmilitary systems face to face, that of former times and that of to-day:\r\nformerly, in Europe, a few soldiers, some hundreds of thousands; to-day,\r\nin Europe, 18 millions of actual or eventual soldiers, all the adults,\r\neven the married, even fathers of families summoned or subject to call\r\nfor twenty-five years of their life, that is to say, as long as they\r\ncontinue able-bodied men; formerly, for the heaviest part of the service\r\nin France, no lives are confiscated by decree, only those bought by\r\ncontract, and lives suited to this business and elsewhere idle or\r\nmischievous; about one hundred and fifty thousand lives of inferior\r\nquality, of mediocre value, which the State could expend with less\r\nregret than others, and the sacrifice of which is not a serious injury\r\nto society or to civilization. To-day, for the same service in France,\r\n4 millions of lives are taken by authority, and, if they attempt to\r\nescape, taken by force; all of them, from the twentieth year onward,\r\nemployed in the same manual and murderous pursuit, including the least\r\nsuited to the purpose and the best adapted to other purposes, including\r\nthe most inventive and the most fecund, the most delicate and the most\r\ncultivated, those remarkable for superior talent (Page 232/526)who\r\nare of almost infinite social value, and whose forced collapse, or\r\nprecocious end, is a calamity for the human species.\r\n\r\nSuch is the terminal fruit of the new Régime; military duty is here the\r\ncounterpart, and as it were, the ransom of political right; the modern\r\ncitizen may balance one with the other like two weights in the scale. On\r\nthe one side, he may place his prerogative as sovereign, that is to say,\r\nin point of fact, the faculty every four years of giving one vote among\r\nten thousand for the election or non-election of one deputy among six\r\nhundred and fifty; on the other side, he may place his positive, active\r\nservice, three, four or five years of barrack life and of passive\r\nobedience, and then twenty-eight days more, then a thirteen-days'\r\nsummons in honor of the flag, and, for twenty years, at each rumor of\r\nwar, anxiously waiting for the word of command which obliges him to\r\nshoulder his gun and slay with his own hand, or be slain. He will\r\nprobably end by discovering that the two sides of the scales do not\r\nbalance and that a right so hollow is poor compensation for so heavy a\r\nburden.\r\n\r\nOf course, in 1789, he foresaw nothing like that; he was optimistic,\r\npacific, liberal, humanitarian; he knew nothing of Europe nor of\r\nhistory, nothing of the past nor of the present. When the Constituent\r\nAssembly constituted him a sovereign, he let things go on; he did not\r\nknow what he engaged to do, he had no idea of having allowed such a\r\nheavy claim against him. But, in signing the social contract, he made\r\nhimself responsible; in 1793, the note came due and the Convention\r\ncollected it.[3263] Then comes Napoleon who put things in order.\r\nHenceforth, every male, able-bodied adult must pay the debt of blood; no\r\nmore exemptions in the way of military service:[3264] all young men who\r\nhad reached the required age drew lots in the conscription and set out\r\nin turn according to the order fixed by their drafted number.[3265] But\r\nNapoleon is an intelligent creditor; he knows that this debt is \"most\r\nfrightful and most detestable for families,\" that his debtors are real,\r\nliving men and therefore different in kind, that the head of the State\r\nshould keep these differences in mind, that is to say their condition,\r\ntheir education, their sensibility and their vocation; that, not only\r\nin their private interest, but again in the interest of the public,\r\nnot merely through prudence but also through equity, all should not be\r\nindistinguishably restricted to the same mechanical pursuit, to the same\r\nmanual labor, to the same prolonged and indefinite servitude of soul and\r\nbody. Already, under the Directory, the law had exempted young married\r\nmen and widowers or divorced persons who were fathers.[3266] Napoleon\r\nalso exempts the conscript who has a brother in the active army, the\r\nonly son of a widow, the eldest of three orphans, the son of a father\r\nseventy-one years old dependent on his labor, all of whom are family\r\nsupports. He joins with these all young men who enlist in one of his\r\ncivil militias, in his ecclesiastical militia or in his university\r\nmilitia, pupils of the École Normale, ignorantin brothers, seminarians\r\nfor the priesthood, on condition that they shall engage to do service\r\nin their vocation and do it effectively, some for ten years, others\r\nfor life, subject to a discipline more rigid, or nearly as rigid, as\r\nmilitary discipline.[3267] Finally, he sanctions or institutes volunteer\r\nsubstitutes, through private agreement between a conscript and the\r\nable-bodied, certified volunteer substitute for whom the conscript is\r\nresponsible.[3268] If such a bargain is made between them it is done\r\nfreely, knowing what they are about, and because each man finds the\r\nexchange to his advantage; the State has no right to deprive either of\r\nthem uselessly of this advantage, and oppose an exchange by which it\r\ndoes not suffer. So far from suffering it often gains by it. For, what\r\nit needs is not this or that man, Peter or Paul, but a man as capable as\r\nPeter or Paul of firing a gun, of marching long distances, of resisting\r\ninclemencies, and such are the substitutes it accepts. They must all\r\nbe[3269] \"of sound health and robust constitution,\" and sufficiently\r\ntall; as a matter of fact, being poorer than those replaced, they are\r\nmore accustomed to privation and fatigue; most of them, having reached\r\nmaturity, are worth more for the service than youths who have been\r\nrecruited by anticipation and too young; some are old soldiers: and in\r\nthis case the substitute is worth twice as much as the new conscript\r\nwho has never donned the knapsack or bivouacked in the open air.\r\nConsequently, those who are allowed to obtain substitutes are \"the\r\ndrafted and conscripts of all classes,... unable to endure the fatigues\r\nof war, and those who shall be recognized of greater use to the State\r\nby continuing their labors and studies than in forming a part of the\r\narmy....\"[3270]\r\n\r\nNapoleon had too much sense to be led by the blind existences of\r\ndemocratic formulae; his eyes, which penetrated beyond mere words, at\r\nonce perceived that the life of a simple soldier, for a young man well\r\nbrought up and a peasant or for day-laborer, is unequal. A tolerable\r\nbed, sufficient clothing, good shoes, certainty of daily bread, a piece\r\nof meat regularly, are novelties for the latter but not for the former,\r\nand, consequently, enjoyments; that the promiscuity and odor of the\r\nbarrack chamber, the corporal's cursing and swearing and rude orders,\r\nthe mess-dish and camp-bread, physical hardships all day and every\r\nother day, are for the former, but not for the latter, novelties\r\nand, consequently, sufferings. From which it follows that, if literal\r\nequality is applied, positive inequality is established, and that by\r\nvirtue even of the new creed, it is necessary, in the name of true\r\nequality as in the name of true liberty, to allow the former, who would\r\nsuffer most, to treat fairly and squarely with the latter, who will\r\nsuffer less. And all the more because, by this arrangement, the civil\r\nstaff preserves for itself its future recruits; it is from nineteen to\r\ntwenty-six that the future chiefs and under-chiefs of the great work\r\nof peaceful and fruitful labor, the savants, artists or scholars, the\r\njurisconsults, engineers or physicians, the enterprising men of commerce\r\nor of industry, receive and undertake for themselves a special and\r\nsuperior education, discover or acquire their leading ideas, and\r\nelaborate their originality or their competency. If talent is to be\r\ndeprived of these productive years their growth is arrested in full\r\nvegetation, and civil capacities, not less precious for the State than\r\nmilitary capacities, are rendered abortive.[3271]--Towards 1804,[3272]\r\nowing to substitution, one conscript out of five in the rural districts,\r\none conscript out of seven in the towns, and, on the average, one\r\nconscript out of ten in France, escapes this forced abortive condition;\r\nin 1806, the price of a substitute varies from eighteen hundred to four\r\nthousand francs,[3273] and as capital is scarce, and ready money still\r\nmore so, a sum like this is sufficiently large. Accordingly, it is the\r\nrich or well-to-do class, in other words the more or less cultivated\r\nclass, which buys off its sons: reliance may be placed on their giving\r\nthem more or less complete culture. In this way, it prevents the State\r\nfrom mowing down all its sprouting wheat and preserves a nursery\r\nof subjects among which society is to find its future élite.--Thus\r\nattenuated, the military law is still rigid enough: nevertheless\r\nit remains endurable. It is only towards 1807[3274] that it becomes\r\nmonstrous and grows worse and worse from year to year until it becomes\r\nthe sepulcher of all French youth, even to taking as canon fodder the\r\nadolescent under age and men already exempt or free by purchase. But,\r\nas before these excesses, it may still be maintained with certain\r\nmodifications; it suffices almost to retouch it, to establish exemptions\r\nand the privilege of substitution as rights, which were once simply\r\nfavors,[3275] reduce the annual contingent, limit the term of service,\r\nguarantee their lasting freedom to those liberated, and thus secure in\r\n1818 a recruiting law satisfactory and efficacious which, for more than\r\nhalf a century, will attain its ends without being too detrimental\r\nor too odious, and which, among so many laws of the same sort, all\r\nmischievous, is perhaps the least pernicious.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3201: \"The Ancient Régime,\" book II., ch. 2, 3, 4, and book V.\r\n(Laff.

Sum-total in 1886, 674 millions.--The rate of\r\ncorresponding taxes under the ancient régime (contrôle, insinuation\r\ncentième denier, formule) was very much lower; the principal one, or\r\ntax of centieme denier, took only 1 per 100, and on the mutations of\r\nreal-estate. This mutation tax is the only one rendered worse; it was\r\nimmediately aggravated by the Constituent Assembly, and it is rendered\r\nall the more exorbitant on successions in which liabilities are not\r\ndeducted from assets. (That is to say, the inheritor of an indebted\r\nestate in France must pay a mutation tax on its full value. He has the\r\nprivilege, however, of renouncing the estate if he does not choose to\r\naccept it along with its indebtedness.)--The taxpayer's resignation to\r\nthis tax is explained by the exchequer collecting it at a unique moment,\r\nwhen proprietorship just comes into being or is just at the point of\r\nbirth. In effect, if property changes hands under inheritance or through\r\nfree donation it is probable that the new owner, suddenly enriched, will\r\nbe only too glad to enter into possession of it, and not object to an\r\nimpost which, although taking about a tenth, still leaves him only a\r\nlittle less wealthy. When property is transferred by contract or sale,\r\nneither of the contracting parties, probably, sees clearly which pays\r\nthe fiscal tax; the seller may think that it is the buyer, and the buyer\r\nthat it is the seller. Owing to this illusion both are less sensible of\r\nthe shearing, each offering his own back in the belief that it is the\r\nback of the other.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3237: See \"The Ancient Régime,\" pp.358-362.

AMBITION AND SELF-ESTEEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Rights and benefits.\r\n\r\n     The assignment of right.--Those out of favor and the\r\n     preferred under former governments.--Under the Ancient\r\n     Regime.--During the Revolution.--French conception of\r\n     Equality and Rights.--Its ingredients and its excesses.--The\r\n     satisfaction it obtains under the new regime.--Abolition of\r\n     legal incapacity and equality in the possession of rights.\r\n     --Confiscation of collective action and equality in the\r\n     deprivation of rights.--Careers in the modern State.--Equal\r\n     right of all to offices and to promotion.--Napoleon's\r\n     distribution of employments.--His staff of officials\r\n     recruited from all classes and parties.\r\n\r\nNow that the State has just made a new allotment of the burdens and\r\nduties which it imposes it must make a new assignment of the rights\r\nand benefits it confers. Distributive justice, on both sides, and long\r\nbefore 1789, was defective, and, under the monarchy, exclusions had\r\nbecome as obnoxious as exemptions; all the more because, through a\r\ndouble iniquity, the ancient Régime in each group distinguished two\r\nother groups, one to which it granted every exemption, and the other\r\nwhich it made subject to every exclusion. The reason is that, from the\r\nfirst, the king, in the formation and government of the kingdom, in\r\norder to secure the services, money, collaboration or connivance which\r\nhe needed, was obliged to negotiate always with corporations, orders,\r\nprovinces, seignories, the clergy, churches, monasteries, universities,\r\nparliaments, professional bodies or industrial guilds and families, that\r\nis to say with constituted powers, more or less difficult to bring under\r\nsubjection and which, to be kept in subjection, stipulated conditions.\r\nHence, in France, so many different conditions: each distinct body had\r\nyielded through one or several distinct capitulations and possessed its\r\nown separate statute. Hence, again, such diversely unequal conditions:\r\nthe bodies, the best able to protect themselves, had, of course,\r\ndefended themselves the best. Their statutes, written or unwritten,\r\nguaranteed to them precious privileges which the other bodies, much\r\nweaker, could neither acquire nor preserve. These were not merely\r\nimmunities but likewise prerogatives, not alone alleviations of taxation\r\nand militia dispensations, but likewise political and administrative\r\nliberties, remnants of their primitive sovereignty, with many other\r\npositive advantages. The very least being precedence, preferences,\r\nsocial priority, with an incontestable right to rank, honors, offices,\r\nand favors. Such, notably, were the regions-states possessing their\r\nown government (pays d'états), compared with those which elected the\r\nmagistrates who apportioned taxation (pays d'élection),[3301] the\r\ntwo highest orders, the clergy and the nobles, compared with the\r\nthird-estate, and the bourgeoisie, and the town corporations compared\r\nwith the rest of the inhabitants. On the other hand, opposed to these\r\nhistorical favorites were the historical disinherited, the latter\r\nmuch more numerous and counting by millions--the taxable commons, all\r\nsubjects without rank or quality, in short, the ordinary run of men,\r\nespecially the common herd of the towns and particularly of the country,\r\nall the more ground down on account of their lower status, along with\r\nthe Jews lower yet, a sort of foreign class scarcely tolerated, with\r\nthe Calvinists, not only deprived of the humblest rights but, again,\r\npersecuted by the State for the past one hundred years.\r\n\r\nAll these people, who have been transported far outside of civic\r\nrelationships by historic right, are brought back, in 1789, by\r\nphilosophic right. After the declarations of the Constituent Assembly,\r\nthere are no longer in France either Bretons, Provençals, Burgundians\r\nor Alsatians, Catholics, Protestants or Israelites, nobles or plebeians,\r\nbourgeois or rurals, but simply Frenchmen,\r\n\r\n* all with the one title of citizens,\r\n\r\n* all endowed with the same civil, religious and political rights,\r\n\r\n* all equal before the State,\r\n\r\n* all introduced by law into every career, collectively, on an equal\r\nfooting and without fear or favor from anybody;\r\n\r\n* all free to follow this out to the end without distinction of rank,\r\nbirth, faith or fortune;\r\n\r\n* all, if they are good runners, to receive the highest prizes at the\r\nend of the race, any office or rank, especially the leading honors and\r\npositions which, thus far reserved to a class or coterie, had not been\r\nallowed previously to the great multitude.\r\n\r\nHenceforth, all Frenchmen, in theory, enjoy rights in common;\r\nunfortunately, this is only the theory. In reality, in all state\r\nrelationships (dans la cité), the new-comers appropriate to themselves\r\nthe offices, the pretensions, and more than the privileges of their\r\npredecessors; the latter, consisting of large and small land-owners,\r\ngentlemen, parliamentarians, officials, ecclesiastics, notables of\r\nevery kind and degree, are immediately deprived of the rights of man.\r\nSurrendered to rural jacqueries and to town mobs, they undergo, first,\r\nthe neglect and, next, the hostility of the State: the public gendarme\r\nhas ceased to protect them and refuses his services; afterwards, on\r\nbecoming a Jacobin, he declares himself their enemy, treats them\r\nas enemies, plunders them, imprisons them, murders them, expels or\r\ntransports them, inflicts on them civil death, and shoots them if they\r\ndare return; he deprives their friends or kindred who remain in France\r\nof their civil rights; he deprives the nobles or the ennobled of their\r\nquality as Frenchmen, and compels them to naturalize themselves afresh\r\naccording to prescribed formalities; he renews against the Catholics the\r\ninterdictions, persecutions and brutalities which the old government\r\nhad practiced against the Calvinist minority.--Thus, in 1799 as in 1789,\r\nthere are two classes of Frenchmen, two different varieties of men,\r\nthe first one superior, installed in the civic fold, and the second,\r\ninferior and excluded from it; only, in 1799, the greatest inequality\r\nconsigned the inferior and excluded class to a still lower, more remote,\r\nand much worse condition.\r\n\r\nThe principle (of equalite), nevertheless, subsists. Since 1789 it is\r\ninscribed at the top of every constitution; it is still proclaimed in\r\nthe new constitution. It has remained popular, although perverted and\r\ndisfigured by the Jacobins; their false and gross interpretation of\r\nit could not bring it into discredit; athwart the hideous grotesque\r\ncaricature, all minds and sentiments ever recur to the ideal form of\r\nthe cité to the veritable social contract, to the impartial, active, and\r\npermanent reign of distributive justice. Their entire education, all the\r\nliterature, philosophy and culture of the eighteenth century, leads\r\nthem onward to this conception of society and of rights; more profoundly\r\nstill, they are predisposed to it by the inner structure of their\r\nintelligence, by the original cast of their sensibility7 by the\r\nhereditary defects and qualities of their nature and of their race.-The\r\nFrenchman easily and quickly grasps some general trait of objects and\r\npersons, some characteristic in common; here, this characteristic is the\r\ninherent quality of man which he dexterously makes prominent, clearly\r\nisolates, and then, stepping along briskly and confidently, rushes\r\nahead on the high-road to consequences.[3302] He has forgotten that his\r\nsummary notion merely corresponds to an extract, and a very brief one,\r\nof man in his completeness; his decisive, precipitate process hinders\r\nhim from seeing the largest portion of the real individual; he has\r\noverlooked numerous traits, the most important and most efficacious,\r\nthose which geography, history, habit, condition, manual labor, or a\r\nliberal education, stamp on intellect, soul and body and which, through\r\ntheir differences, constitute different local or social groups. Not only\r\ndoes he overlook all these characteristics, but he sets them aside; they\r\nare too numerous and too complex; they would interfere with and disturb\r\nhis thoughts; however fitted for clear and comprehensive logic he is so\r\nmuch the less fitted for complex and comprehensive ideas; consequently,\r\nhe avoids them and, through an innate operation of which he is\r\nunconscious, he involuntarily condenses, simplifies and curtails\r\nhenceforth, his idea, partial and superficial as it is, seems to him\r\nadequate and complete; in his eyes the abstract quality of man takes\r\nprecedence of and absorbs all others; not only has this a value, but the\r\nsole value. One man, therefore, is as good as another and the law should\r\ntreat all alike.--Here, amour-propre (self-esteem, pride or arrogance),\r\nso keen in France, and so readily excited, comes in to interpret and\r\napply the formula:[3303]\r\n\r\n\"Since all men equal each other, I am as good as any man; if the law\r\nconfers a right on people of this or that condition, fortune or birth,\r\nit must confer the same right on me. Every door that is open to them\r\nmust be open to me; every door that is closed to me must be closed to\r\nthem. Otherwise, I am treated as an inferior and wounded in my deepest\r\nfeelings. When the legislator places a ballot in their hands he is bound\r\nto place another just like it in my hands, even if they know how to use\r\nit and I do not, even if a limited suffrage is of use to the community\r\nand universal suffrage is not. So much the worse if I am sovereign only\r\nin name, and through the imagination; I consent to my sovereignty being\r\nillusory, but with the understanding that the sovereignty of others is\r\nregarded likewise; so I prefer servitude and privation for all, rather\r\nthan liberties and advantages for a few, and, provided the same level is\r\npassed over all heads, I submit to the yoke for all heads, including my\r\nown.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the internal composition of the instinct of' equality, and such\r\nis the natural instinct of Frenchmen. It is beneficial or mischievous\r\naccording as one or the other of its ingredients predominates, at one\r\ntime the noble sentiment of equity and at another time the low envy of\r\nfoolish vanity;[3304] healthy or unhealthy, however, its power in France\r\nis enormous, and the new Régime gratifies it in every possible way, good\r\nor bad. No more legal disqualifications! On the one hand, the republican\r\nlaws of proscription or of exception were all repealed: we have seen an\r\namnesty and the return of the émigrés, the Concordat, the restoration\r\nof Catholic worship, the compulsory reconciliation of the\r\nconstitutionalists with the orthodox; the First Consul admits no\r\ndifference between them; his new clergy are recruited from both groups\r\nand, in this respect, he forces the Pope to yield.[3305] He gives twelve\r\nof the sixty episcopal thrones to former schismatics; he wants them to\r\ntake their places boldly; he relieves them from ecclesiastical penitence\r\nand from any humiliating recantation; he takes care that, in the other\r\nforty-eight dioceses, the priests who formerly took the civic oath shall\r\nbe employed and well treated by their superiors who, at the same epoch,\r\nrefused to take the civic oath. On the other hand, all the exclusions,\r\ninequalities and distinctions of the monarchy remain abolished. Not only\r\nare the Calvinist and even Israelite cults legally authorized, the same\r\nas the Catholic cult, but, again, the Protestant consistories and Jewish\r\nsynagogues[3306] are constituted and organized on the same footing as\r\nthe Catholic churches. Pastors and rabbis likewise become functionaries\r\nunder the same title as bishops and cure's; all are recognized or\r\nsanctioned by the government and all equally benefit by its patronage:\r\nit is an unique thing in Europe to find the small churches of the\r\nminority obtaining the same measure of indifference and good will from\r\nthe State as the great church of the majority, and, henceforth, in fact\r\nas in law, the ministers of the three cults, formerly ignored, tolerated\r\nor proscribed, enjoy their rank, titles and honors in the social as well\r\nas in the legal hierarchy, equally with the ministers of that cult which\r\nwas once the only one dominant or allowed\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in the civilian status, no inferiority or discredit must\r\nlegally attach to any condition whatever, either to plebeian, villager,\r\npeasant or poor man as such, as formerly under the monarchy; nor to\r\nnoble, bourgeois, citizen, notable or rich man, as recently under the\r\nRepublic. Each of these two classes is relieved of its degradation; no\r\nclass is burdened by taxation or by the conscription beyond its due; all\r\npersons and all property find in the government, in the administration,\r\nin the tribunals, in the gendarme, the same reliable protection.--So\r\nmuch for equity and the true spirit of equality.--Let us now turn\r\naround and consider envy and the bad spirit of equality. The plebiscite,\r\nundoubtedly, as well as the election of deputies to the Corps Legislatif\r\nare simply comedies; but, in these comedies, one rôle is as good as\r\nanother and the duke of the old or new pattern, a mere figurant\r\namong hundreds and thousands of others, votes only once like the\r\ncorner-grocer. Undoubtedly, the private individual of the commune\r\nor department, in institutions of charity, worship or education, is\r\ndeprived of any independence, of any initiation, of any control, as the\r\nState has confiscated for itself all collective action; but the classes\r\ndeprived of this are especially the upper classes, alone sufficiently\r\nenlightened and wealthy to take the lead, form projects and provide for\r\nexpenditure: in this usurpation, the State has encroached upon and eaten\r\ndeeper into the large body of superior existences scattered about than\r\ninto the limited circle where humbler lives clamber and crawl along;\r\nnearly the entire loss, all perceptible privation, is for the\r\nlarge landed proprietor and not for his hired hands, for the large\r\nmanufacturer or city merchant and not for their workmen or clerks,[3307]\r\nwhile the clerk, the workman, the journeyman, the handicraftsman, who\r\ngrumble at being the groundlings, find themselves less badly off since\r\ntheir masters or patrons, fallen from a higher point, are where they are\r\nand they can elbow them.\r\n\r\nNow that men are born on the ground, all on the same level, and are\r\nconfined within universal and uniform limits, social life no longer\r\nappears to them other than a competition, a rivalry instituted and\r\nproclaimed by the State, and of which it is the umpire; for, through\r\nits interference, all are comprised within its enclosure and shut up\r\nand kept there; no other field is open to run on; on the contrary, every\r\ncareer within these bounds, indicated and staked out beforehand, offers\r\nan opportunity for all runners: the government has laid out and\r\nleveled the ground, established compartments, divided off and prepared\r\nrectilinear lists which converge to the goal; there, it presides, the\r\nunique arbiter of the race, exposing to all competitors the innumerable\r\nprizes which it proposes for them.--These prizes consist of offices, the\r\nvarious employments of the State, political, military, ecclesiastical,\r\njudiciary, administrative and university, all the honors and dignities\r\nwhich it dispenses, all the grades of its hierarchy from the lowest\r\nto the highest, from that of corporal, college-regent, alderman,\r\noffice--supernumerary, assistant priest up to that of senator, marshal\r\nof France, grand master of the university, cardinal, and minister of\r\nState. It confers on its possessor, according to the greater or lesser\r\nimportance of the place, a greater or lesser portion of the advantages\r\nwhich all men crave and seek for money, power, patronage, influence,\r\nconsideration, importance and social pre-eminence; thus, according to\r\nthe rank one attains in the hierarchy, one is something, or of some\r\naccount; outside of the hierarchy, one is nothing.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the faculty for getting in and advancing one's self\r\nin these lists is the most precious of all: in the new Régime it is\r\nguaranteed by the law as a common right and is open to all Frenchmen. As\r\nno other outlet for them is allowed by the State it owes them this\r\none; since it invites them and reduces everybody to competing under its\r\ndirection it is bound to be an impartial arbiter; since the quality of\r\ncitizen, in itself and through it alone, confers the right to make one's\r\nway, all citizens indifferently must enjoy the right of succeeding in\r\nany employment, the very highest, and without any distinction as\r\nto birth, fortune, cult or party. There must be no more preliminary\r\nexclusions; no more gratuitous preferences, undeserved favors,\r\nanticipated promotions; no more special favors.--Such is the rule of\r\nthe modern State: constituted as it is, that is to say, monopolizer and\r\nomnipresent, it cannot violate this rule for any length of time with\r\nimpunity. In France, at least, the good and bad spirits of equality\r\nagree in exacting adherence to it: on this point, the French are\r\nunanimous; no article of their social code is more cherished by them;\r\nthis one flatters their amour-propre and tickles their imagination; it\r\nexalts hope, nourishes illusion, intensifies the energy and enjoyment\r\nof life.--Thus far, the principle has remained inert, powerless, held in\r\nsuspension in the air, in the great void of speculative declarations and\r\nof constitutional promises. Napoleon brings it down to the ground and\r\nrenders it practical; that which the assemblies had decreed in vain for\r\nten years he brings about for the first time and in his own interest. To\r\nexclude a class or category of men from offices and promotion would be\r\nequivalent to depriving one's self gratuitously of all the talents it\r\ncontains, and, moreover, to incurring, besides the inevitable rancor\r\nof these frustrated talents, the sullen and lasting discontent of the\r\nentire class or category. The First Consul would do himself a wrong were\r\nhe to curb his right to choose: he needs every available capacity, and\r\nhe takes them where he finds them, to the right, to the left, above or\r\nbelow, in order to keep his regiments full and enroll in his service\r\nevery legitimate ambition and every justifiable pretension.\r\n\r\nUnder the monarchy, an obscure birth debarred even the best endowed men\r\nfrom the principal offices. Under the Consulate and the Empire the two\r\nleading personages of the State are Lebrun, Maupeou's old secretary,\r\na productive translator,[3308] a lawyer, formerly councilor in a\r\nprovincial court of justice, then third-consul, then Duc de Plaisance\r\nand arch-chancellor of the Empire and Cambacérès, second-consul, then\r\nDuc de Parme and arch-chancellor of the Empire, both of them being\r\nprinces. Similarly, the marshals are new men and soldiers of fortune,\r\na few of them born in the class of inferior nobles or in the ordinary\r\nbourgeois class, mostly among the people or even amongst the populace,\r\nand, in its lowest ranks, Masséna, the son of a wine-dealer, once a\r\ncabin-boy and then common soldier and non-commissioned officer for\r\nfourteen years; Ney, son of a cooper, Lefebvre, son of a miller, Murat,\r\nson of a tavern-keeper, Lannes, son of an hostler, and Augereau, son\r\nof a mason and a female dealer in fruit and vegetables.--Under the\r\nRepublic, noble birth consigned, or confined, the ablest and best\r\nqualified men for their posts to a voluntary obscurity, only too glad\r\nwhen their names did not condemn them to exile, imprisonment or to the\r\nguillotine. Under the Empire, M. de Talleyrand is prince of Benevento,\r\nminister of foreign affairs and vice-grand-elector with a salary of five\r\nhundred thousand francs. We see personages of old nobility figuring in\r\nthe first ranks: among the clergy M. de Roquelaure, M. de Boisgelin,\r\nM. de Broglie, M. Ferdinand de Rohan; in the magistracy, M. Séguier, M.\r\nPasquier, M. Molé; on the domestic and decorative staff of the\r\npalace, Comte de Ségur, grand-master of ceremonies, Comte de\r\nMontesquiou-Fézensac, grand-chamberlain, also as chamberlains, Comtes\r\nd'Aubusson de la Feuillade, de Brigode, de Croy, de Coutades,\r\nde Louvois, de Brancas, de Gontaut, de Grammont, de Beauvau, de\r\nLur-Saluces, d'Haussonville, de Noailles, de Chabot, de Turenne,[3309]\r\nand other bearers of historic names.--During the Revolution, at each new\r\nparliamentarian, popular or military coup d'état the notabilities of\r\nthe vanquished party were always excluded from office and generally\r\noutlawed. After the coup d'état of Brumaire, not only are the vanquished\r\nof the old parties all brought back under the protection of the law,\r\nbut, again, their notables are promoted to the highest offices. Among\r\nthe monarchists of the Constituent Assembly Mabuet is made councilor of\r\nState, and Maury archbishop of Paris; forty-seven other ecclesiastics\r\nwho, like himself, refused to take the oath to the civil constitution\r\nof the clergy, are appointed, like him, to episcopal thrones. Among\r\nthe Feuillants of the Legislative Assembly, Vaublanc is made prefect,\r\nBeugnot a councilor of State and minister of the finances in the\r\ngrand-duchy of Berg, Matthieu Dumas a brigadier-general and director of\r\nreviews, Narbonne becomes the aid-de-camp and the intimate interlocutor\r\nof Napoleon, and then ambassador to Vienna; if Lafayette had been\r\nwilling, not to ask for but to accept the post, he would have been made\r\na marshal of France.--Among the few Girondists or Federalists who did\r\nnot perish after the 2nd June, Riouffe is prefect and baron, Lanjuinais\r\nis senator and count; among others proscribed, or half proscribed, the\r\nnew Régime restores to and places at the head of affairs the superior\r\nand special employees whom the Reign of Terror had driven away, or\r\nsingled out for slaughter, particularly the heads of the financial and\r\ndiplomatic services who, denounced by Robespierre on the 8th Thermidor,\r\nor arrested on the morning of the 9th already felt their necks under the\r\nblade of the guillotine; Reinhart and Otto are ambassadors, Mollien is\r\ncount and treasury minister, Miot becomes councilor of state, Comte de\r\nMelito minister of finances at Naples, while Gaudin is made minister of\r\nfinances in France and Duc de Gaëte. Among the transported or fugitives\r\nof Fructidor, Barthélemy becomes senator, Barbé-Marbois director of the\r\nTreasury and first president of the Cour des Comptes; Siméon, councilor\r\nof State and then minister of justice in Westphalia; Portalis is made\r\nminister of worship, and Fontanes grand-master of the University. The\r\nFirst Consul passes the sponge over all political antecedents: not\r\nonly does he summon to his side the moderates and half-moderates of the\r\nConstituent and Legislative Assemblies, of the Convention and of the\r\nDirectory, but again he seeks recruits among pure royalists and pure\r\nJacobins, among the men the most devoted to the ancient Régime and\r\namongst those most compromised by the Revolution, at both extremities\r\nof the most extreme opinions. We have just seen, on the one side, what\r\nhereditary favorites of a venerable royalty, what born supporters of the\r\ndeposed dynasty, are elevated by him to the first of his magisterial,\r\nclerical and court dignities. On the other hand, apart from Chasset,\r\nRoederer and Grégoire, apart from Fourcroy, Bérlier and Réal, apart from\r\nTreilhard and Boulay de La Meurthe, he employs others branded or noted\r\nfor terrible acts, Barère himself, at least for a certain period, and in\r\nthe sole office he was fitted for, that of a denunciator, gazetteer and\r\nstimulator of public opinion; everybody has a place according to his\r\nfaculties, and each has rank according to his usefulness and merit.\r\nBarère, consequently, becomes a paid spy and pamphleteer; Drouet,\r\nthe postmaster, who arrested the royal family at Varennes, becomes\r\nsub-prefect at Sainte-Menehould; Jean-Bon Saint-André, one of the\r\nCommittee of Public Safety, is made prefect at Mayence; Merlin de Douai,\r\nreporter of the law against suspects, is prosecuting attorney in the\r\ncourt of cassation; Fouché, whose name tells all, becomes minister of\r\nstate and Duke of Otranto; nearly all of the survivors of the Convention\r\nare made judges of première instance or of appeal, revenue-collectors,\r\ndeputies, prefects, foreign consuls, police commissioners, inspectors of\r\nreviews, head-clerks in the post-offices, custom-houses and tax-offices,\r\nwhile, in 1808, among these functionaries, one hundred and thirty were\r\nregicides.[3310]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Ambitions during the Ancient Regime.\r\n\r\n     The need of success.--Initiation and conditions of promotion\r\n     under the old monarchy.--Effect on minds.--Ambitions are\r\n     limited.--The external outlets open to them.\r\n\r\nTo make one's way, get ahead, and succeed in the world is now the\r\ndominant thought in the minds of men. Before 1789, this thought had\r\nnot acquired sovereign control in their minds; it found that there were\r\nrival ideas to contend with, and it had only half-developed itself; its\r\nroots had not sunk down deep enough to monopolize the activity of the\r\nimagination, to absorb the will and possess the mind entirely; and the\r\nreason is that it lacked both air and victuals. Promotion, under the old\r\nmonarchy, was slow, and in the first place, because the monarchy was old\r\nand because in every order which is not new each new generation finds\r\nthat every office is filled, and next, because, in this old order\r\nfounded on tradition and heredity, future vacancies were supplied long\r\nbeforehand. The great social staircase led to several stories; each man\r\ncould ascend every step of his own flight, but he could not mount above\r\nit; the landing reached, he found closed doors and nearly insurmountable\r\nbarriers. The story above was reserved to its own inhabitants; they\r\noccupied it now and were still to occupy it in time to come; the\r\ninevitable successors of the titular possessor were seen around him\r\non each step, his equals, peers and neighbors, one or the other often\r\ndesignated by name as his legal heir, the purchaser of his survivorship.\r\nIn those days, not only was the individual himself considered, his\r\nmerits and his services, but likewise his family and ancestry, his state\r\nand condition, the society he entered into, the \"salon\" he maintained,\r\nhis fortune and his followers; these antecedents and surroundings\r\ncomposed the quality of the personage; without this requisite quality,\r\nhe could not go beyond the landing-place. Strictly speaking, a personage\r\nborn on the upper steps of one story might sometimes succeed in mounting\r\nthe lowest steps of the next story, but there he stopped. In short, it\r\nwas always considered by those on the lower story that the upper story\r\nwas inaccessible and, moreover, uninhabitable.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, most of the public offices, in the finances, in the\r\nadministration, in the judiciary, in the parliaments, in the army,\r\nat court, were private property as is now the case with the places of\r\nadvocates, notaries and brokers; they had to be bought to enable one to\r\nfollow these pursuits, and were very dear; one had to possess a large\r\ncapital and be content beforehand to derive only a mediocre revenue from\r\nit, 10, 5 and sometimes 3 % on the purchase-money.[3311] The place once\r\nacquired, especially if an important one, involved official parade,\r\nreceptions, an open table, a large annual outlay;[3312] it often ran\r\nthe purchaser in debt; he knew that his acquisition would bring him more\r\nconsideration than crowns. On the other hand, to obtain possession of\r\nit, he had to secure the good-will of the body of which he became a\r\nmember, or of the patron who bestowed the office. That is to say, he\r\nmust be regarded by his future colleagues as acceptable, or by the\r\npatron as a guest, invited, and feasible friend, in other words, provide\r\nsponsors for himself, furnish guarantees, prove that he was well-off and\r\nwell-educated, that his ways and manners qualified him for the post,\r\nand that, in the society he was about to enter, he would not turn out\r\nunsuitable. To maintain one's self in office at court one was obliged to\r\npossess the tone of Versailles, quite different from that of Paris and\r\nthe provinces.[3313] To maintain one's self in a high parliamentary\r\nposition, one was expected to possess local alliances, moral authority,\r\nthe traditions and deportment handed down from father to son in the old\r\nmagistrate families, and which a mere advocate, an ordinary pleader,\r\ncould not arrive at.[3314] In short, on this staircase, each distinct\r\nstory imposed on its inmates a sort of distinct costume, more or less\r\ncostly, embroidered and gilded, I mean a sum of outward and inward\r\nhabits and connections, all obligatory and indispensable, comprising\r\ntitle, particle and name: the announcement of any bourgeois name by a\r\nlackey in the ante-chamber would be considered a discord; consequently,\r\none had one's self ennobled in the current coin, or assumed a noble\r\nname gratis. Caron, son of a watchmaker, became Beaumarchais; Nicolas, a\r\nfoundling, called himself M. de Champfort; Danton, in public documents,\r\nsigned himself d'Anton; in the same way, a man without a dress-coat\r\nhires or borrows one, no matter how, on going out to dine; all this\r\nwas tolerated and accepted as a sign of good behavior and of final\r\nconformity with custom, as in testimony of respect for the usages of\r\ngood society.\r\n\r\nThrough this visible separation of stories, people had acquired the\r\nhabit of remaining in the condition in which they were placed; they were\r\nnot irritated by being obliged to stay in it; the soldier who enlisted\r\ndid not aspire to become an officer; the young officer of the lower\r\nnoblesse and of small means did not aspire to the post of colonel or\r\nlieutenant-general; a limited perspective kept hopes and the imagination\r\nfrom fruitlessly launching forth into a boundless future: ambition,\r\nhumbled to the ground at the start, walked instead of flying; it\r\nrecognized at the outset that the summits were beyond its reach; to be\r\nable to mount upward one or two steps was enough.--In general, a man\r\nobtained promotion on the spot, in his town, corporation or parliament.\r\nThe assistant-counselor who pleaded his first case in the court of\r\nGrenoble or of Rennes calculated that, in twenty years, he would become\r\nfirst judge at Grenoble or at Rennes, rest twenty years or more in\r\noffice, and he aimed at nothing better. Alongside of the counselor of\r\na (court) presidency, or of an \"election\" magistrate, of a clerk in the\r\nsalt-tax bureau, or in the frontier custom-house, or in the bureau of\r\n\"rivers and forests,\" alongside of a clerk in the treasury or ministry\r\nof foreign affairs, or of a lawyer or prosecuting attorney, there was\r\nalways some son, son-in-law or nephew, fitted by domestic training, by\r\na technical apprenticeship, by moral adaptation, not only to perform\r\nthe duties of the office, but to be contented in it, pretend to nothing\r\nbeyond it, not to look above himself with regret or envy, satisfied with\r\nthe society around him, and feel, moreover, that elsewhere he would be\r\nout of his element and uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nLife, thus restricted and circumscribed, was more cheerful then than at\r\nthe present day; souls, less disturbed and less strained, less exhausted\r\nand less burdened with cares, were healthier. The Frenchman, exempt from\r\nmodern preoccupations, followed amiable and social instincts, inclined\r\nto take things easily, and of a playful disposition owing to his natural\r\ntalent for amusing himself by amusing others, in mutual enjoyment\r\nof each other's company and without calculation, through easy and\r\nconsiderate intercourse, smiling or laughing, in short, in a constant\r\nflow of inspiration, good-humor and gayety.[3315] It is probable that,\r\nif the Revolution had not intervened, the great parvenus of the time\r\nand of the Empire would, like their forerunners, have submitted to\r\nprevailing necessities and readily accommodated themselves to the\r\ndiscipline of the established Régime. Cambacérès, who had succeeded to\r\nhis father as counselor at the bar of Montpellier, would have become\r\npresident (of the tribunal) in his turn; meanwhile, he would have\r\ncomposed able jurisprudential treatises and invented some new pâté de\r\nbecfigues; Lebrun, former collaborator with Maupeou, might have become\r\ncounselor in the court of excise at Paris, or chief-clerk in the\r\nTreasury department; he would have kept up a philosophical salon, with\r\nfashionable ladies and polished men of letters to praise his elegant\r\nand faulty translations. Amongst the future marshals, some of them,\r\npure plebeians, Masséna, Augereau, Lannes, Ney, Lefebvre, might have\r\nsucceeded through brilliant actions and have become \"officers of\r\nfortune,\" while others, taking in hand specially difficult services,\r\nlike commandant Fischer who undertook the destruction of Mandrin's band,\r\nand again, like the hero Chevert, and the veteran Lückner, might have\r\nbecome lieutenant-generals. Rough as these men were, they would have\r\nfound, even in the lower ranks, if not full employment for their\r\nsuperior faculties, at least sufficient food for their strong and coarse\r\nappetites; they would have uttered just the same oaths, at just as\r\nextravagant suppers, with mistresses of just the same caliber.[3316]\r\nHad their temperament, character and genius been indomitable, had they\r\nreared and pranced to escape bridle and harness and been driven like\r\nordinary men, they need not have broken out of the traces for all that;\r\nthere were plenty of openings and issues for them on either side of\r\nthe highway on which others were trotting along. Many families often\r\ncontained, among numerous children, some hot-headed, imaginative youth,\r\nsome independent nature rebellious in advance, in short, a refractory\r\nspirit, unwilling or incapable of being disciplined; a regular life,\r\nmediocrity, even the certainty of getting ahead, were distasteful to\r\nhim; he would abandon the hereditary homestead or purchased office to\r\nthe docile elder brother, son-in-law or nephew, by which the domain or\r\nthe post remained in the family; as for himself, tempted by illimitable\r\nprospects, he would leave France and go abroad; Voltaire says[3317] that\r\n\"Frenchmen were found everywhere,\" in Canada, in Louisiana, as surgeons,\r\nfencing-masters, riding-masters, officers, engineers, adventurers\r\nespecially, and even filibusters, trappers and backwoodsmen, the\r\nsupplest, most sympathetic and boldest of colonizers and civilizers,\r\nalone capable of bringing the natives under assimilation by assimilating\r\nwith them, by adopting their customs and by marrying their women,\r\nmixing bloods, and forming new and intermediary races, like Dumas de La\r\nPailleterie, whose descendants have furnished original and superior men\r\nfor the past three generations, and like the Canada half-breeds by which\r\nthe aboriginal race succeeds in transforming itself and in surviving.\r\nThey were the first explorers of the great lakes, the first to trace the\r\nMississippi to its mouth, and found colonial empires with Champlain\r\nand Lasalle in North America and with Dupleix and La Bourdonnais in\r\nHindustan. Such was the outlet for daring, uncontrollable spirits,\r\nrestive temperaments under constraint and subject to the routine of an\r\nold civilization, souls astray and unclassed from their birth, in which\r\nthe primitive instincts of the nomad and barbarian sprouted afresh, in\r\nwhich insubordination was innate, and in which energy and capacity to\r\ntake the initiative remained intact.--Mirabeau, having compromised his\r\nfamily by scandals, was on the point of being dispatched by his father\r\nto the Dutch Indies, where deaths were common; it might happen that he\r\nwould be hanged or become governor of some large district in Java or\r\nSumatra, the venerated and adored sovereign of five hundred thousand\r\nMalays, both ends being within the compass of his merits. Had Danton\r\nbeen well advised, instead of borrowing the money with which to buy an\r\nadvocate's place in the Council at about seventy thousand livres, which\r\nbrought him only three cases in four years and obliged him to hang on to\r\nthe skirts of his father-in-law, he would have gone to Pondicherry or\r\nto the palace of some indigenous rajah or king as agent, councilor\r\nor companion of his pleasures; he might have become prime-minister to\r\nTippoo Sahib, or other potentate, lived in a palace, kept a harem and\r\nhad lacs of rupees; undoubtedly, he would have filled his prisons and\r\noccasionally emptied them by a massacre, as at Paris in September, but\r\nit would have been according to local custom, and operating only on\r\nthe lives of Sheikhs and Mahrattas. Bonaparte, after the fall of his\r\nprotectors, the two Robespierres, finding his career arrested, wanted\r\nto enter the Sultan's service; accompanied by Junot, Muiron, Marmont\r\nand other comrades, he could have carried to Constantinople rarer\r\ncommodities, much better compensated in the Orient than in the Occident,\r\nnamely military honor and administrative talent; he would have dealt\r\nin these two products, as he did in Egypt, at the right time and in the\r\nright place, at the highest price, without our conscientious scruples\r\nand without our European refinements of probity and humanity. No\r\nimagination can picture what he would have become there: certainly some\r\npasha, like Djezzar in Syria, or a khedive like Mahomet-Ali, afterwards\r\nat Cairo; he already saw himself in the light of a conqueror, like\r\nGhengis-Khan,[3318] a founder like Alexander or Baber, a prophet like\r\nMahomet; as he himself declares, \"one could work only on a grand scale\r\nin the Orient,\" and there he would have worked on a grand scale; Europe,\r\nperhaps, would have gained by it, and especially France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Ambition and Selection.\r\n\r\n     The Revolution provides an internal outlet and an unlimited\r\n     career.--Effect of this.--Exigencies and pretensions of the\r\n     modern man.--Theoretical rule of selection among rivals.\r\n     --Popular suffrage raised to be lord and judge.--Consequence\r\n     of its verdict.--Unworthiness of its choice.\r\n\r\nBut the Revolution arrived and the ambitions which, under the ancient\r\nRégime, found a field abroad or cooled down at home, arose on the natal\r\nsoil and suddenly expanded beyond all calculation. After 1789, France\r\nresembles a hive in a state of excitement; in a few hours, in the brief\r\ninterval of an August morning, each insect puts forth two huge wings,\r\nsoars aloft and \"all whirl together pell-mell;\" many fall to the ground\r\nhalf cut to pieces and begin to crawl upward as before; others, with\r\nmore strength or with better luck, ascend and glitter on the highways\r\nof the atmosphere.--Every great highway and every other road is open to\r\neverybody through the decrees of the Constituent-Assembly, not only for\r\nthe future, but even immediately. The sudden dismissal of the entire\r\nruling staff, executive, or consultative, political, administrative,\r\nprovincial, municipal, ecclesiastical, educational, military, judicial\r\nand financial, summon to take office all who covet it and who have a\r\ngood opinion of themselves. All previously existing conditions, birth,\r\nfortune, education, old family and all apprenticeships, customs and ways\r\nwhich retard and limit advancement, are abolished: There are no\r\nlonger any guarantees or sponsors; all Frenchmen are eligible to all\r\nemployments; all grades of the legal and social hierarchy are conferred\r\nby a more or less direct election, a suffrage becoming more and more\r\npopular, by a mere numerical majority. Consequently, in all branches of\r\nthe government under central or local authority and patronage, there is\r\nthe installation of a new staff of officials. The transposition\r\nwhich everywhere substitutes the old inferior to the old superior, is\r\nuniversal,[3319] \"lawyers for judges, bourgeois for statesmen, former\r\nplebeians for former nobles, soldiers for officers, officers for\r\ngenerals, curés for bishops, vicars for curés, monks for vicars,\r\nstock-jobbers for financiers, self-taught persons for administrators,\r\njournalists for publicists, rhetoricians for legislators, and the poor\r\nfor the rich.\" A sudden jump from the bottom to the top of the social\r\nladder by a few, from the lowest to the highest rung, from the rank of\r\nsergeant to that of major-general, from the condition of a pettifogger\r\nor starving newspaper-hack to the possession of supreme authority, even\r\nto the effective exercise of omnipotence and dictatorship--such is the\r\ncapital, positive, striking work of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, and as an after-effect, a revolution is going on in\r\nminds and the moral effect of the show is greater and more lasting than\r\nthe events themselves. The minds have been stirred to their very depths;\r\nstagnant passions and slumbering pretensions are aroused. The multitude\r\nof offices presented and expected vacancies \"has excited the thirst\r\nfor power, stimulated self-esteem, and fired the hopes of men the most\r\ninept. An fierce, gross presumption has freed the ignorant and the\r\nfoolish of any feeling of modesty or incompetence; they have deemed\r\nthemselves capable of everything because the law awards public office\r\nsimply to the able. Everybody had a perspective glimpse of gratified\r\nambition; the soldier dreamt only of displacing the officer, the officer\r\nof becoming general, the clerk of supplanting the head administrator,\r\nthe lawyer of yesterday of the supreme court, the curé of becoming\r\nbishop, the most frivolous littérateur of seating himself on the\r\nlegislative bench. Places and positions, vacant due to the promotion\r\nof so many parvenus, provided in their turn a vast career to the lower\r\nclasses. Seeing a public functionary issue out of nothingness, where\r\nis the shoeblack whose soul would not stir with ambition?\"--This new\r\nsentiment must be taken into account: for, whether reasonable or not, it\r\nis going to last, maintain its energy, stimulate men with extraordinary\r\nforce[3320] and become one of the great incentives of will and action.\r\nHenceforth, government and administration are to become difficult\r\nmatters; the forms and plans of the old social architecture are no\r\nlonger applicable; like construction is not possible with materials of a\r\ndifferent kind, whether with stable or unstable materials, with men\r\nwho do not dream of quitting their condition or with men who think of\r\nnothing but that.\r\n\r\nIn effect, whatever vacancy may occur, each aspirant thinks himself fit\r\nfor it, and only one of the aspirants can obtain it. Accordingly some\r\nrule of preference must be adopted outside of the opinion that each\r\ncandidate entertains of himself. Accordingly, at a very early date, one\r\nwas established, and there could be no better one, namely, that, among\r\nthe competitors for the place, the most competent to fill it should be\r\nchosen. Unfortunately, the judge, ordinary, extraordinary and supreme,\r\ninstituted to decide in this case, was the plurality of male, adult\r\nFrenchmen, counted by heads, that is to say a collective being in which\r\nthe small intelligent, élite body is drowned in the great rude mass;\r\nof all juries, the most incompetent, the easiest duped and misled,\r\nthe least able to comprehend the questions laid before it and the\r\nconsequences of its answer; the worst informed, the most inattentive,\r\nthe most blinded by preconceived sympathies or antipathies, the most\r\nwillingly absent, a mere flock of enlisted sheep always robbed or\r\ncheated out of their vote, and whose verdict, forced or simulated,\r\ndepended on politicians beforehand, above and below, through the\r\nclubs as well as through the revolutionary government, the latter,\r\nconsequently, maneuvering in such a way as to impose itself along with\r\ntheir favorites on the choice of the French people. Between 1792 and\r\n1799, the republican official staff just described is thus obtained.--It\r\nis only in the army where the daily and keen sense of a common physical\r\nand mortal danger ends in dictating the choice of the best, and raises\r\ntried merit to the highest rank; and yet it must be noted that Jacobin\r\ninfatuation bore down as rigorously on the army as elsewhere and on\r\ntwo occasions: at the outset through the election of a superior\r\nofficer conferred on subordinates, which handed rank over to the noisy\r\ndisputants and intemperate intriguers of the mess-room; and again\r\nduring the Reign of Terror, and even later,[3321] in the persecution\r\nor dismissal of so many patriotic and deserving officers, which led\r\nGouvion-Saint-Cyr and his comrades, through disgust, to avoid or decline\r\naccepting high rank, in the scandalous promotion of club brawlers and\r\ndocile nullities, in the military dictatorship of the civil proconsuls,\r\nin the supremacy conferred on Léchelle and Rossignol, in the\r\nsubordination forced on Kléber and Marceau, in the absurd plans of a\r\ndemagogue with huge epaulettes like Cartaux,[3322] in the grotesque\r\norders of the day issued by a swaggering inebriate like Henriot,[3323]\r\nin the disgrace of Bonaparte, and in the detention of Hoche.--In the\r\ncivil order of things, it was worse. Not only was the rule of regulating\r\npromotion by merit not recognized but it was applied in an inverse\r\nsense. In the central government as in the local government, and from\r\ntop to bottom of the hierarchy, from the post of minister of foreign\r\naffairs down to that of president of a petty revolutionary committee,\r\nall offices were for the unworthy. Their unfitness kept on increasing\r\ninasmuch as incessant weeding out worked against them, the functionary,\r\ndegraded by his work, growing worse along with his function.--Thus\r\nthe constitutional rights of merit and capacity ended in the practical\r\nprivilege of incapacity and demerit. And in the allotment of grades and\r\nsocial advantages, distributive justice had given way to distributive\r\ninjustice, while practice, contrary to theory, instituted permanently,\r\non the one hand, the exclusion or retirement of competent, instructed,\r\nexpert, well-bred, honorable and respected men and, on the other hand,\r\nbrought forward illiterate, inept and rude novices, coarse and vulgar\r\nbrutes, common blackguards, men used up or of tarnished reputations,\r\nrogues ready for anything, fugitives from justice, in short the\r\nadventurers and outcasts of every kind and degree.[3324] The latter,\r\nowing their success to perversion or lack of conscientiousness,\r\nderived their principal title from their vigorous fists and a fixed\r\ndetermination to hold on to their places as they had obtained them,\r\nthat is to say by main force and by the murder or exile of their\r\nrivals.--Evidently, the staff of officials which the Declaration of\r\nHuman Rights had promised was not the staff on duty ten years later\r\nthere was a lack of experience.[3325] In 1789, careers were open to\r\nevery ambition; down to 1799, the rivalry of ambitions had simply\r\nproduced a wild uproar and a brutal conquest. The great modern\r\ndifficulty remained: how to discipline the competition and to find an\r\nimpartial judge, an undisputed arbitrator of the competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Napoleon, Judge-Arbitrator-Ruler.\r\n\r\n     Napoleon as judge of competition.--Security of his seat.\r\n     --Independence of his decisions.--Suppression of former\r\n     influences and end of monarchical or democratic intrigues.\r\n     --Other influences against which he is on guard.--His favorite\r\n     rule.--Estimate of candidates according to the kind and\r\n     amount of their useful labor.--His own competency.--His\r\n     perspicacity.--His vigilance.--Zeal and labor of his\r\n     functionaries.--Result of competition thus viewed and of\r\n     functions thus exercised.--Talents utilized and jealousies\r\n     disarmed.\r\n\r\nBehold him, at last, this judge-arbitrator. On the 8th November, 1799,\r\nhe appears and takes his seat, and that very evening he goes to\r\nwork, makes his selections among the competitors and gives them their\r\ncommissions. He is a military chieftain and has installed himself;\r\nconsequently he is not dependent on a parliamentary majority, and any\r\ninsurrection or gathering of a mob is at once rendered abortive by his\r\ntroops before it is born. Street sovereignty is at an end; Parisians are\r\nlong to remember the 13th of Vendémaire and the way General Bonaparte\r\nshot them down on the steps of Saint-Roch. All his precautions against\r\nthem are taken the first day and against all agitators whatever, against\r\nall opponents disposed to dispute his jurisdiction. His arm-chair as\r\nfirst Consul and afterwards his throne as Emperor are firmly fixed;\r\nnobody but himself can undermine them; he is seated definitively and\r\nwill stay there. Profound silence reigns in the public crowd around\r\nhim; some among them dare whisper, but his police has its eye on them.\r\nInstead of conforming to opinion he rules it, masters it and, if need\r\nbe, he manufactures it. Alone by himself from his seat on high,\r\nin perfect independence and security, he announces the verdicts of\r\ndistributive justice. Nevertheless he is on his guard against the\r\ntemptations and influences which have warped the decisions of his\r\npredecessors; in his tribunal, the schemes and intrigues which formerly\r\nobtained credit with the people, or with the king, are no longer in\r\nvogue; from now on, the profession of courtier or of demagogue is a\r\npoor one.--On the one hand, there is no success, as formerly under the\r\nmonarchy, through the attentions of the ante-chamber, through elegant\r\nmanners, delicate flattery, fashionable drawing-rooms, or valets and\r\nwomen on an intimate footing; mistresses here enjoy no credit and there\r\nare neither favorites nor the favored; a valet is regarded as a useful\r\nimplement; great personages are not considered as extra-ornamental and\r\nhuman furniture for the palace. Not one among them dare ask for a place\r\nfor a protégé which he is incapable of filling, an advancement which\r\nwould derange the lists of promotions, a pass over the heads of others;\r\nif they obtain any favors, these are insignificant or political; the\r\nmaster grants them as an after-thought, to rally somebody, or a party,\r\nto his side; they personally, their ornamental culture, their high-bred\r\ntone, their wit, their conversational powers, their smiles and bows--all\r\nthis is lost on him, or charged to account. He has no liking for their\r\ninsinuating and discreet ways;[3326] he regards them as merely good\r\ndomestics for parade; all he esteems in them is their ceremonial\r\nsignificance, that innate suppleness which permits them to be at once\r\nservile and dignified, the hereditary tact which teaches them how to\r\npresent a letter, not from hand to hand, but on the rim of a hat, or\r\non a silver plate, and these faculties he estimates at their true\r\nworth.--On the other hand, nobody succeeds, as lately under the\r\nRepublic, through tribunal or club verbosity, through appeals to\r\nprinciples, through eloquent or declamatory tirades; \"glittering\r\ngeneralities,\" hollow abstractions and phrases made to produce an\r\nimpression have no effect; and what is better, political ideology, with\r\na solicitor or pleader, is a bad note. The positive, practical mind\r\nof the judge has taken in at a glance and penetrated to the bottom\r\nof arguments, means and valid pretensions; he submits impatiently to\r\nmetaphysics and pettifoggery, to the argumentative force and mendacity\r\nof words.--This goes so far that he distrusts oratorical or literary\r\ntalent; in any event when he entrusts active positions or a part in\r\npublic business then he takes no note of it. According to him, \"the men\r\nwho write well and are eloquent have no solidity of judgment; they are\r\nillogical and very poor in discussion,\"[3327] they are mere artists\r\nlike others, so many word-musicians, a kind of special, narrow-minded\r\ninstrument, some of them good solo players, like Fontanes, and who the\r\nhead of a State can use, but only in official music for grand cantatas\r\nand the decoration of his reign. Wit in itself, not alone the wit which\r\ngives birth to brilliant expressions and which was considered a prime\r\naccomplishment under the old regime, but general intelligence, has for\r\nhim only a semi-value.[3328] \"I am more brilliant[3329], you may say?\r\nEh, what do I care for your intelligence? What I care for is the\r\nessence of the matter. There is nobody so foolish that is not good for\r\nsomething--there is no intelligence equal to everything.\" In fact,\r\non bestowing an office it is the function which delegates; the proper\r\nexecution of the function is the prime motive in determining his choice;\r\nthe candidate appointed is always the one who will best do the work\r\nassigned him. No factitious, party popularity or unpopularity, no\r\nsuperficial admiration or disparagement of a clique, of a salon, or of\r\na bureau, makes him swerve from his standard of preference.[3330]\r\nHe values men according to the quality and quantity of their work,\r\naccording to their net returns, and he estimates them directly,\r\npersonally, with superior perspicacity and universal competency. He\r\nis special in all branches of civil or military activity, and even\r\nin technical detail; his memory for facts, actions, antecedence and\r\ncircumstances, is prodigious; his discernment, his critical analysis,\r\nhis calculating insight into the resources and shortcomings of a mind\r\nor of a soul, his faculty for gauging men, is extraordinary; through\r\nconstant verifications and rectifications his internal repertory, his\r\nbiographical and moral dictionary, is kept daily posted; his attention\r\nnever flags; he works eighteen hours a day; his personal intervention\r\nand his hand are visible even in the appointment of subordinates. \"Every\r\nman called to take part in affairs was selected by him;\"[3331] it is\r\nthrough him that they retain their place; he controls their promotion\r\nand by sponsors whom he knows. \"A minister could not have dismissed a\r\nfunctionary without consulting the emperor, while the ministers could\r\nall change without bringing about two secondary changes throughout the\r\nempire. A minister did not appoint even a second-class clerk without\r\npresenting a list of several candidates to the emperor and, opposite to\r\nit, the name of the person recommending him.\" All, even at a\r\ndistance, felt that the master's eyes were on them. \"I worked,\" says\r\nBeugnot,[3332] \"from night to morning, with singular ardor; I astonished\r\nthe natives of the country who did not know that the emperor exercised\r\nover his servitors, however far from him they might be, the miracle of\r\nthe real presence. I thought I saw him standing over me as I worked shut\r\nup in my cabinet.\"--\"Under him,\" writes Roederer, \"there is no man of\r\nany merit who, as a reward for long and difficult labor, does not feel\r\nhimself better compensated by a new task than by the most honorable\r\nleisure.\" Never did positions less resemble sinecures. Never was\r\nthe happiness of successful candidates or the misery of unsuccessful\r\ncandidates better justified. Never the compliance, the difficulty,\r\nthe risks of a required task have been compensated more fairly by the\r\nenjoyment of the allocated rewards nor moderated the bitterness of the\r\nfrustrated pretensions.[3333] Never were public functions assigned\r\nor fulfilled in a way to better satisfy the legitimate craving for\r\nadvancement, the dominant desire of democracy and of the century, and in\r\na way to better disarm the bad passions of democracy and of the\r\ncentury, consisting of an envious leveling, anti-social rancor and\r\nthe inconsolable regrets of the man who has failed. Never did human\r\ncompetition encounter a similar judge, so constant, so expert and so\r\njustified.--He is himself conscious of the unique part he plays. His\r\nown ambition, the highest and most insatiate of all, enables him to\r\ncomprehend the ambition of others; to place everywhere the man who suits\r\nthe post in the post which suits the man--this is what he has done for\r\nhimself and what he does for others. He knows that in this lies his\r\npower, his deep-seated popularity, his social utility.\r\n\r\n\"Nobody,\" says Napoleon,[3334] \"is interested in overthrowing a\r\ngovernment in which all the deserving are employed.\"\r\n\r\nThen, again, comes his significant exclamation at the end, his summary\r\nof modern society, a solemn grandiose figure of speech found in the\r\nlegendary souvenirs of a glorious antiquity, a classic reminiscence of\r\nthe noble Olympian games,\r\n\r\n\"Henceforth, all careers are open to talent!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. The Struggle for Office and Title.\r\n\r\n     Competition and prizes.--Multitude of offices.--How their\r\n     number is increased by the extension of central patronage\r\n     and of the French territory.--Situation of a Frenchman\r\n     abroad.--It gives him rank.--Rapidity of promotion.\r\n     --Constant elimination and multiplicity of vacancies in the\r\n     army.--Preliminary elimination in the civil service.\r\n     --Proscription of cultivated men and interruption of education\r\n     during the Revolution.--General or special instruction rare\r\n     in 1800.--Small number of competent candidates.--Easy\r\n     promotion due to the lack of competitors.--Importance and\r\n     attraction the prizes offered.--The Legion of Honor.--The\r\n     imperial nobility.--Dotations and majorities.--Emulation.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the career which he thus opens to them and the\r\nprizes he offers. These prizes are in full view, ranged along each\r\nracecourse, graduated according to distances and more and more striking\r\nand magnificent. Every ambition is provided for, the highest as well\r\nas the lowest, and these are countless; for they consist of offices of\r\nevery grade in the civil and military hierarchies of a great centralized\r\nState whose intervention is universal, under a government which\r\nsystematically tolerates no authority or influence outside of itself\r\nand which monopolizes every species of social importance for its own\r\nfunctionaries.[3335]--All these prizes, even the smallest and most\r\ninsignificant, are awarded by it. In the first place, Napoleon has two\r\nor three times as many offices to bestow, on the soil of old France\r\nalone, as the former kings; for, even in the choice of their staff of\r\nofficials, the latter were not always free; in many places they did not\r\nhave, or no longer had the right of appointment. At one time, this right\r\nbe longed from time immemorial to provincial or municipal corporations,\r\nlaic or ecclesiastic, to a certain chapter, abbey or collegiate church,\r\nto a bishop in his diocese, to the seignior in his seignory. At another\r\ntime the king, once possessing the right, had surrendered or alienated\r\nit, in whole or in part through gratuitous favor and the concession of\r\na survivorship or for money and through the sale of an office; in brief,\r\nhis hands were tied fast by hereditary or acquired privileges There are\r\nno privileges now to fetter the hands of the First Consul. The entire\r\ncivil organization dates from him. The whole body of officials is thus\r\nof his own selection, and under him it is much more numerous than that\r\nof the ancient Régime; for he has extended the attributions of the\r\nState beyond all former bounds. Directly or indirectly, he appoints by\r\nhundreds of thousands the mayors and councilors of municipalities and\r\nthe members of general councils, the entire staff of the administration,\r\nof the finances, of the judicature, of the clergy, of the University,\r\nof public works and of public charity. Besides all this, myriads of\r\nministerial and notarial officials lawyers, ushers, auctioneers, and\r\nby way of surplus, or as a natural result, the members of every great\r\nprivate association since no collective enterprise, from the Bank of\r\nFrance and the press to stage lines and tontines, may be established\r\nwithout his permission, nor exist without his tolerance. Not counting\r\nthe latter, and after deducting likewise the military or active duty\r\nand the functionaries who draw pay, the prefect from the earliest\r\nyears report that, since 1789, the number of people \"employed or under\r\ngovernment pay\" has more than doubled: In Doubs, in the year IX, instead\r\nof 916 there are 1820; in Meurthe in the year XIII, instead of 1828\r\nthere are 3091; in Ain, in 1806 instead of 955 there are 1771[3336].\r\nAs to the army, it has tripled, and according to the First Consul's own\r\ncalculations, instead of 9,000 or 10,000 officers as in 1789, there are\r\nmore than 20,000.--These figures go on increasing on the old territory\r\nthrough the very development of the new organization, through the\r\nenormous increase of the army, through the re-establishment of religious\r\nworship, through the installation of droits réunis, through the\r\ninstitution of the University, owing to the increasing number\r\nof officials, curés and assistant-priests, of professors and\r\nschool-teachers, and of retired and pensioned invalids.[3337]\r\n\r\nAnd these figures, which already swell of themselves, are to swell an\r\nadditional half through the extension of the ancient territory. Instead\r\nof 86 departments with a population of 26 millions, France ends in\r\ncomprising 130 departments with 42 million inhabitants--Belgium and\r\nPiedmont, then Hanover, Tuscany, Central Italy, Illyria, Holland and the\r\nHanseatic provinces, that is to say 44 departments and 16 millions of\r\nannexed Frenchmen;[3338] affording another large outlet for little and\r\nbig ambitions.--Add still another, as a surplus and not less extensive\r\noutlet, outside of France: for the subject princes and the vassal kings,\r\nEugène, Louis, Jerome, Murat, and Joseph, each with their governments,\r\nimport into their realms a more or less numerous body of French\r\nofficials, familiars, court dignitaries, generals, ministers,\r\nadministrators, even clerks and other indispensable subalterns, if for\r\nno other purpose than to bring the natives within the military and\r\ncivil compartments of the new Régime and teach them on the spot the\r\nconscription, the administration, the civil code, and systems of\r\naccounts like those of Paris. Even in the independent or allied States,\r\nin Prussia, in Poland, in the confederation of the Rhine, there are,\r\nat intervals or permanently, Frenchmen in position and in authority to\r\ncommand contingent forces, to garrison fortresses, to receive supplies\r\nand secure the payment of war contributions. Even with the corporal and\r\ncustom-house inspector on duty on coast at Dantzig and at Reggio, the\r\nsentiment of victorious priority equals the possession of rank; in their\r\neyes the natives of the country are semi-barbarians or semi-savages,\r\na backward or prejudiced lot, not even knowing how to speak their\r\nlanguage; they feel themselves superior, as formerly the señor soldado\r\nof the sixteenth century, or the civis romanus. Never since the great\r\nSpanish monarchy and the Old Roman empire has a conquering State and\r\npropagator of a new régime afforded its subjects such gratifications of\r\nself-esteem, nor opened so vast a career to their ambitions.\r\n\r\nFor, having once adopted their career, they know better than the\r\nSpaniards under Charles V. or the Romans under Augustus, how far they\r\ncan go and how fast they can get ahead. No obstacle impedes them; nobody\r\nfeels himself confined his post; each considers the one he occupies\r\nas provisional, each takes it only to await a better one, anticipating\r\nanother at a very early date; he dashes onward, springs aloft and\r\noccupies in advance the superior post which he means to secure on\r\nthe first vacancy, and, under this Régime, the vacancies are\r\nnumerous.--These vacancies, in the military service and in the grade\r\nof officers, may be estimated at nearly four thousand per annum;[3339]\r\nafter 1808 and 1809, but especially after the disaster of 1812 and 1813,\r\nplaces are no longer lacking but subjects fill them; Napoleon is\r\nobliged to accept youths for officers as beardless as his conscripts,\r\neighteen-year-old apprentices who, after a year or six months in the\r\nmilitary academy, might finish their apprenticeship on the battle-field,\r\npupils taken from the philosophy or rhetoric classes, willing children\r\n(de bonne volonté): On the 13th of December 1808, he draws 50 from his\r\nlycées, who don the gold-lace of under-officers at once; in 1809, he\r\ncalls out 250, to serve in the depot battalions; in 1810, he calls out\r\n150 of the age of nineteen who \"know the drill,\" and who are to be sent\r\non distant expeditions with the commission of second-lieutenant; in\r\n1811, 400 for the school of noncommissioned officers at Fontainebleau,\r\n20 for the Ile-de-Ré and 84 who are to be quartermasters; and, in 1812,\r\n112 more and so on. Naturally, thanks to annually increasing gaps made\r\nby cannon and bayonet, the survivors in this body of youth mount the\r\nfaster; in 1813 and 1814, there are colonels and lieutenant-colonels of\r\nthe age of twenty-five.\r\n\r\nIn the civil service, if fewer are killed everybody is almost equally\r\nover tasked. Under this reign one is soon used up, physically and\r\nmorally, even in pacific employments, and this also supplies vacancies.\r\nBesides, in default of deaths, wounds and violent elimination, there is\r\nanother elimination, not less efficacious, operating in this direction,\r\nand for a long time, in favor of men of ability, preparing places for\r\nthem and accelerating their advancement. Napoleon accepts none but\r\ncompetent candidates; now, in 1800, there is a dearth of acceptable\r\ncandidates for places in the civil service and not, as in 1789, or at\r\nthe present time, a superabundance and even too great a crowd.--In the\r\nmilitary service especially, capacity is innate; natural endowments,\r\ncourage, coolness, quick perception, physical activity, moral\r\nascendancy, topographical imagination form its principal elements; men\r\njust able to read, write and cipher became, in three or four years,\r\nduring the Revolution, admirable officers and conquering generals.--It\r\nis not the same in relation to civil capacity; this requires long and\r\ncontinuous study. To become a priest, magistrate, engineer, professor,\r\nprefect or school-teacher, one must have studied theology or law,\r\nmathematics or Latin, administration or the finances. If not, the\r\nfunctionary is not qualified to serve: he must, at the very least, know\r\nhow to spell, be able to write French, examine a law-case, draw up\r\na report, keep accounts, and if needs be, comprehend a plan, make an\r\nestimate and read off a map. Men of this stamp are rare at the beginning\r\nof the Consulate. As notables,[3340] the Revolution mowed them down\r\nfirst. Among all their sons and so many well-bred youth who have become\r\nsoldiers through patriotism, or who have left their families to prevent\r\nthese from becoming suspect, one half repose on the battlefield or have\r\nleft the hospital only for the cemetery; \"the muscadin[3341] died from\r\nthe first campaign.\" In any event, for them and their younger brothers,\r\nfor the children beginning to learn Latin and mathematics, for all who\r\nhoped to pursue liberal professions, for the entire generation about to\r\nreceive either a superior, a common, or even a primary instruction, and\r\nhence to furnish brains prepared for intellectual work, there was a lack\r\nof this for ten years. Not only were the endowments which provided\r\nfor instruction confiscated but the educational staff, nearly all\r\necclesiastic, was one of the most proscribed among those proscribed.\r\nWhilst military requisition and the closing of the schools suppressed\r\nthe pupils, massacres, banishment, imprisonment, destitution and the\r\nscaffold suppressed the teachers. Whilst the ruin of universities\r\nand colleges did away with theoretical apprenticeship, the ruin of\r\nmanufactures and of trade abolished practical apprenticeship. Through\r\nthe long interruption of all studies, general instruction as well as\r\nspecial competency became rare product in the market.--Hence it is that,\r\nin 1800, and during the three or four following years, whoever brought\r\nto market either one the other of these commodities was certain of a\r\nquick sale;[3342] the new government needed them more than anybody. The\r\nmoment the seller made up his mind, he was bought, and, whatever he may\r\nbe, a former Jacobin or a former émigré; he is employed. If he brings\r\nboth commodities and is zealous, he is promptly promoted; if, on\r\ntrial, he is found of superior capacity, he will, like Mollien, Gaudin,\r\nTronchet, Pasquier and Molé, attain to the highest posts, for he finds\r\nscarcely any competitors. These he would have had had things followed\r\ntheir usual course; it is the Revolution which has cleared the ground\r\naround him; without that the road would have been obstructed; competent\r\ncandidates would have swarmed. Reckon, if possible, how many men\r\nof talent who were destroyed, royalists, monarchists, feuillants,\r\nGirondists and even Jacobins. They were the élite of the noblesse, of\r\nthe clergy, of the bourgeoisie, of the youth and those of riper age.\r\nThus rid of their most formidable rivals the survivors pursue their way\r\nat top speed; the guillotine has wrought for them in advance; it has\r\neffected openings in their own ranks, made by bullets in every battle\r\nin the ranks of the army, and, in the civil hierarchy as in the military\r\nhierarchy, merit, if demonstrated by services, or not arrested by death,\r\nreaches the highest summit in very few years.\r\n\r\nThe prizes offered on these summits are splendid; no attraction is\r\nlacking. The great trainer who displays them has omitted none of\r\nthe seductions which excite and stimulate an ordinary mind. He has\r\nassociated with the positive values of power and wealth every\r\nvalue incident to imagination and opinion; hence his institution of\r\ndecorations and the Legion of Honor.[3343]\r\n\r\n\"They call it a toy,\"[3344] said he, \"but men are led by toys...\r\nFrenchmen are not changed by ten years of revolution.... See how the\r\npeople prostrate themselves before foreign decorations: they have been\r\nsurprised by them and accordingly do not fail to wear them.... The\r\nFrench cherish but one sentiment, honor: that sentiment, then, requires\r\nnourishing--they must have honors.\"\r\n\r\nA very few are satisfied with their own achievements; ordinary men\r\nare not even content with the approbation they perceive in the eyes of\r\nothers: it is too intermittent, too reserved, too mute; they need fame\r\nthat is brilliant and noisy; they want to hear the constant hum of\r\nadmiration and respect whenever they appear or whenever their name is\r\nmentioned. Even this does not suffice; they are unwilling that their\r\nmerit should rest in men's minds in the vague state of undefined\r\ngreatness, but that it should be publicly estimated, have its current\r\nvalue, enjoy undisputed and measured rank on the scale above all other\r\nlesser merits.--The new institution affords complete satisfaction to\r\nall these exigencies of human and French nature. On the 14th of July,\r\n1804,[3345] the anniversary of the taking of the Bastille, Napoleon\r\nadministers the oath to the legionaries and, after a solemn mass,\r\ndistributes the insignia under the dome of the Invalides in the presence\r\nof the empress and the court; and again one month later, August\r\n16, 1804, on the anniversary of the Emperor's birth, in the camp at\r\nBoulogne, facing the ocean and in full view of the flotilla assembled to\r\nconquer England, before one hundred thousand spectators and the entire\r\narmy, to the roll of eighteen hundred drums. No ceremony, probably, was\r\never more exciting. The eminent surgeon, Larrey, then decorated, a man\r\nof austere virtue, spoke of it with emotion to the end of his life and\r\nnever alluded that unique day but with a trembling voice. On that\r\nday, nearly all the men of superior and tried merit and talent in\r\nFrance[3346] are proclaimed, each with the title proportionate his\r\ndegree of eminence--chevaliers, officers, commanders, grand-officers,\r\nand, later on, grand-eagles; each on the same plane with his equals of a\r\ndifferent class, ecclesiastics alongside of laymen, civilians alongside\r\nof soldiers; each honored by the company of his peers, Berthollet,\r\nLaplace and Lagrange alongside of Kellermann, Jourdan and Lefebvre,\r\nOtto and Tronchet alongside of Masséna, Augereau, Ney, Lannes, Soult and\r\nDavout; four cardinals side by side with eighteen marshals, and likewise\r\neven down to corporal, and to Egyptian veterans blinded by ophthalmia\r\non the banks of the Nile, comprising common soldiers who, through\r\nsome brilliant achievement, had won a sword or a gun of honor, as, for\r\ninstance, Coignet,[3347] who, dashing ahead with fixed bayonet, kills\r\nfive Austrian artillerymen and takes their cannon himself alone. Six\r\nyears before this he was a stable-boy on a farm and could neither read\r\nnor write; he is now mentioned among the first of those promoted, a\r\ncolleague and almost a comrade of Monge, the inventor of descriptive\r\ngeometry, of de Fontanes, grand-master of the university, of marshals,\r\nadmirals, and the highest dignitaries, all sharing in common an\r\ninestimable treasure, the legitimate heirs of twelve years' accumulated\r\nglory by the sacrifice of so many heroic lives and all the more\r\nglorified because so few,[3348] and because, in these days, a man did\r\nnot obtain the cross by twenty years of plodding in a bureau, on account\r\nof routine punctuality, but by wonderful strokes of energy and audacity,\r\nby wounds, by braving death a hundred times and looking it in the face\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\nHenceforth, legally as well as in public opinion, they form the staff of\r\nthe new society, its declared, verified notables, enjoying precedences\r\nand even privileges. On passing along the street the sentinel\r\npresents arms; a company of twenty-five soldiers attends their\r\nfuneral procession; in the electoral colleges of the department or\r\narrondissement they are electors by right and without being balloted\r\nfor, simply by virtue of their rank. Their sons are entitled to\r\nscholarships in La Fléche, at Saint-Cyr, and in the lycées, and their\r\ndaughters at Ecouen or Saint-Denis. With the exception of a title, as\r\nformerly, they lack nothing for filling the place of the old nobility,\r\nand Napoleon re-creates this title for their benefit. The title itself\r\nof chevalier, count, duke or prince carries along with an idea of social\r\nsuperiority; when announced in a drawing room, when it precedes the\r\nfirst sentence of an address, those who are present do not remain\r\ninattentive; an immemorial prejudice inclines them to award\r\nconsideration or even deference. The Revolution tried in vain to destroy\r\nthis power of words and of history; Napoleon does better: he confiscates\r\nit; he arrogates to himself the monopoly of it, he steals the trade-mark\r\nfrom the ancient Régime; he himself creates 48,000 chevaliers, 1000\r\nbarons, 388 counts, 31 dukes and 4 princes. Furthermore, he stamps with\r\nhis own mark the old nobles whom he introduces into his nobility: he\r\ncoins them anew and often with an inferior title; this or that duke\r\nis lowered a notch and becomes simply a count: taken at par or at a\r\ndiscount the feudal coin must, in order to pass, receive the imperial\r\nstamp which gives it its recognized value in modern figures.\r\n\r\nBut, let the old-fashioned metal be what it may, whether gold, silver or\r\ncopper, even crude and plebeian, the new coin is of good alloy and very\r\nhandsome. Frequently, like the old currency, it displays coats of arms\r\nin high relief, a heraldic crown and the name of a locality; it no\r\nlonger bears the name of territory, and it does not call to mind a\r\nprimitive sovereignty. On the contrary, it bears the name of a victory\r\nor of a conquest and reminds one of recent exploits. Duc de\r\nMontebello or a Prince de la Moskowa is equivalent in the imagination\r\ncontemporaries to a Duc de Montmorency or a Prince de Rohan; for, if the\r\nprince or duke of the empire is without ancestors, he is or will be an\r\nancestor himself. To these prizes coveted by vanity Napoleon tacks on\r\nevery substantial and pecuniary advantage, in ready money or landed\r\nproperty, not alone large salaries, adjunctive sénatoreries, occasional\r\nmunificent gifts,\r\n\r\n* a million at one time to General Lasalle, but likewise vast revenues\r\nfrom the extraordinary domain[3349],\r\n\r\n* 32,463,817 francs a year divided amongst 4970 persons,\r\n\r\n* pensions from 250 to 5000 francs for all legionaries,\r\n\r\n* villas, large estates, private incomes, distinct and superb endowments\r\nfor those of the highest rank, a fortune of 100,000 livres income and\r\nmore to 34 of these,\r\n\r\n* a fortune of 450,000 livres in the public funds to Cambacérès, of\r\n683,000 livres in the public funds to Masséna, of 728,000 livres in the\r\npublic funds to Ney, of 910,000 livres in the public funds to Davout, of\r\n1,354,000 livres in the public funds to Berthier,\r\n\r\n* and besides all this, three \"sovereign principalities,\" Neufchatel to\r\nBerthier, Benevento to Talleyrand, and Ponte-Corvo to Bernadotte.--\r\n\r\nThis last attraction which, in these times of violent and premature\r\ndeath, is of no little account. Napoleon opens out hereditary and\r\nundefined prospects beyond the perspectives of life and of inferior\r\ninterests. Each of the titles conferred by him, that of prince, duke,\r\ncount, baron, and even that of chevalier, is transmissible in direct\r\ndescent, according to primogeniture from father to son, and sometimes\r\nfrom uncle to nephew, under specified conditions which are very\r\nacceptable, and of which the first is the institution of an inalienable\r\nmajority, inattackable, consisting of this or that income or real\r\nproperty, of bank stock or state securities, from 3000 francs for common\r\nchevaliers up to 200,000 francs for the dukes, that is to say, a certain\r\nfortune in perpetuity due to the sovereign's liberality, or to the\r\nprudence of the founder, and intended to support the dignity of the\r\ntitle from male to male and from link to link throughout the future\r\nchain of successive inheritors. Through this supreme reward, the subtle\r\ntempter has a hold on the men who care not alone for themselves but for\r\ntheir family: henceforth, the work as he does, eighteen hours a day,\r\nstand fire, and say to themselves, while sinking at their desks or\r\nfacing cannon-ball that their pre-eminence survives them in their\r\nposterity:\r\n\r\n\"In any event my son will succeed me and even become greater by my\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\nAll the temptations which serve to overcome the natural lethargy of\r\nhuman matter are simultaneously united and; with the exception of\r\npersonal conscience and the desire for personal independence, all other\r\ninternal springs are strained to the utmost. One unusual circumstance\r\ngives to eager ambitions a further increase of energy, impulse and\r\nenthusiasm.--All these successful or parvenu men are contemporaries:\r\nall have started alike on the same line and from the same average or\r\nlow condition in life; each sees old comrades superior to himself on the\r\nupper steps; he considers himself as good they are, suffers because he\r\nis not on their level, and strives and takes risks so as to mount up to\r\nthem. But, however high he mounts, he still sees higher yet others who\r\nwere formerly his equals; consequently, no rank obtained by them seems\r\nto him above his deserts, and no rank that he obtains suffices for his\r\npretensions.\r\n\r\n\"See that Masséna,\" exclaimed Napoleon,[3350] a few days before\r\nthe battle of Wagram; \"he has honors and fame enough, but he is not\r\nsatisfied; he wants be a prince like Murat and Bernadotte: he will risk\r\ngetting shot to-morrow simply to be a prince.\"--\r\n\r\nAbove these princes who have only the rank, the title and the money,\r\ncome the grand-dukes and reigning viceroys like Murat, grand-duke of\r\nBerg, and Eugene, viceroy of Italy. Above Eugene and Murat are the\r\nvassal-kings, Louis, Joseph, Jerome, then Murat himself, who, among\r\nthese, is in a better place, and Bernadotte, the only sovereign that is\r\nindependent; all more or less envied by the marshals, all more or less\r\nrivals of each other, the inferior aspiring to the superior throne,\r\nMurat inconsolable at being sent to Naples and not to Spain, and at\r\nhaving only five millions of subjects instead of thirteen millions.\r\nFrom top to bottom of the hierarchy and even to the loftiest places,\r\ncomprising thrones, the steps rise regularly above each other in\r\ncontinuous file, so that each leads to the following one, with nothing\r\nto hinder the first-comer, provided he is lucky, has good legs and does\r\nnot fall on the way, from reaching the top of the staircase in twenty\r\nor thirty years. \"It was commonly reported in the army--he has been\r\npromoted king of Naples, of Holland, of Spain, of Sweden, as formerly\r\nwas said of the same sort of man, who had been promoted sergeant in this\r\nor that company.\"--Such is the total and final impression which lingers\r\non in all imaginations; it is in this sense that the people interpret\r\nthe new Régime, and Napoleon devotes himself to confirming the popular\r\ninterpretation. Accordingly, the first duchy he creates is for Marshal\r\nLefebvre\r\n\r\n\"purposely,\" as he says,[3351] because \"this marshal had been a private\r\nand everybody in Paris had known him as a sergeant in the French\r\nguards.\"\r\n\r\n--With such an example before them, and so many others like it, not less\r\nstriking, there is no ambition that does not become exalted, and often\r\nto delirium.\r\n\r\n\"At this time,\" says Stendhal, who seized the master-idea of the reign,\r\n\"there was no apothecary's apprentice in his back shop, surrounded by\r\nhis drugs and bottles, filtering and pounding away in his mortar, who\r\ndid not say to himself that, if he chanced to make some great discovery,\r\nhe would be made a count with fifty thousand francs a year.\"\r\n\r\nIn those days there was no under-clerk who, in his labored penmanship,\r\ninscribed names on a piece of parchment, that did not imagine his own\r\nname appearing some day on a senatorial or ministerial diploma. At this\r\ntime the youthful corporal who dons his first stripes of gold braid\r\nalready fancies that he hears the beating of the drums, the blast of the\r\ntrumpet, and the salvos of artillery which proclaim him marshal of the\r\nEmpire.[3352]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Self-esteem and a good Reputation.\r\n\r\n     The inward spring from 1789 to 1815.--Its force.--Its\r\n     decline.--How it ends in breaking the machine down.\r\n\r\nA new force, extraordinary, is just apparent in history, a spiritual\r\nforce analogous to that which formerly stimulated souls in Spain in the\r\nsixteenth century, in European the time of the crusades, and in Arabia\r\nin the time of Mahomet. It stimulates the faculties to excess, increases\r\nenergy tenfold, transports man beyond or above himself, creates\r\nenthusiasts and heroes, blinding or rendering men crazy, and hence the\r\nirresistible conquerors and rulers. It stamps its imprint and leaves\r\nits memorials in ineffaceable characters on men and things from Cadiz\r\nto Moscow. It overrides all natural barriers and transcends all\r\nordinary limits. \"The French soldier,\" writes a Prussian officer after\r\nJena,[3353] \"are small and puny. One of our Germans could whip any four\r\nof them. But, under fire, they become supernatural beings. They are\r\nswept along by an indescribable ardor of which there is not a trace\r\namong our soldiers.... What can you do with peasants whom nobles lead\r\ninto battle, but whose danger they share without any interest in\r\ntheir passions or recompenses!\"--Coupled with the physical needs which\r\nrequires a certain amount of ease and of daily food, and which, if too\r\nstrenuously opposed, produces passing jacqueries, there is a still more\r\npotent longing which, on suddenly encountering its object, seizes on\r\nit, clings to it, gorges it, and produces revolutions that last: this\r\nlonging is the desire to contemplate one-self with satisfaction and\r\ncomplacency, forming of one's self a pleasing, flattering image, and of\r\ntrying to impress and plant this image in the minds of others; in short,\r\nthe ambition for a great self-esteem and of becoming greatly esteemed by\r\nothers.[3354] This sentiment, according to the quality of the person and\r\naccording to circumstances, gives birth sometimes to the noblest virtues\r\nand the most sublime devotion, and at other times to the worst misdeeds\r\nand the most dangerous delirium: the man becomes transfigured, the\r\nsleeping god or demon which both live within him is suddenly aroused.\r\nAfter 1789, both appear and both together; from this date onward, says\r\nan eye-witness,[3355] and, during one quarter of a century, \"for most\r\nFrenchmen and in whatever class,\" the object of life is displaced; each\r\nhas put it outside of himself; from now on, the essential thing for\r\neverybody is \"to have lived,\" or \"to have died for something,\" for\r\nan idea. A man becomes the slave of his idea, gives himself up to it;\r\nconsequently, he has experienced the intense satisfaction of considering\r\nhimself a noble being, of superior essence, foremost among the first,\r\nand of seeing himself regarded in that light and proclaimed and\r\nglorified as such.--This keen, profound and intense pleasure was first\r\nenjoyed by the French on listening to the Declaration of the Rights\r\nof Man; from then, and in good faith, they felt themselves citizens,\r\nphilosophers, the destroyers of prejudices and wrongs, zealots in behalf\r\nof truth, liberty and equality, and then, when the war of 1792 came, the\r\ndefenders of the country, missionaries and propagators of every grand\r\nprinciple.[3356]--Towards 1796, principles began to recede in the\r\nbackground;[3357] in the ideal portrait which man makes of himself the\r\nliberator and benefactor of mankind gradually gives way to the admirable\r\nand admired hero capable of great achievements. This inner portrait of\r\nhimself suffices for his happiness for some years to come: vanity[3358]\r\nproperly so called and a calculating ambition are not the incentives\r\nof action; if he obtains promotion it is without asking for it; his\r\naspiration is simply to display himself, to be lavish of himself and\r\nlive or die courageously and gaily[3359] along with his comrade; to be\r\nconsidered, outside the service, the equal, friend and brother of his\r\nsubordinates and of his chiefs.[3360] Pillage, nevertheless, has begun;\r\nfor, a long continuance of war depraves the conqueror; brutality,\r\nindifference to property and to life grows on him; if callous, or he\r\nwishes to become so, he eats, drinks and enjoys the passing hour;\r\nif provident and wary, he scrapes together what he can or levies\r\ncontributions and hoards money.--Under the Empire, and especially\r\ntowards 1808 and 1809, the ideal figure degenerates still more; from now\r\non, it is the successful or the coming officer, with his rank and its\r\naccouterments, his gold-embroidered uniform and badges, exercising\r\nauthority over so many hundreds and thousands of men and enjoying a\r\ncertain notable sum of regular salaries, besides other gratifications\r\nbestowed on him by the master, along with the profits he can make out of\r\nthe vanquished.[3361] All that he now cares for is rapid promotion, and\r\nin any way, noble or ignoble, at first, of course, on the main road,\r\nthat is in straining himself and risking his life, but likewise on a\r\nnew road, in an affectation of zeal, in practicing and professing blind\r\nobedience, in abandoning all political ideas, in devoting himself no\r\nlonger to France, but to the sovereign: sympathy for his comrades gives\r\nway to harsh rivalry; soldierly friendships, under the anticipation\r\nof advancement, die out. A vacancy due to death is for the benefit of\r\nsurvivors and they know it. \"At Talavera,\" says Stendhal, \"two officers\r\nstood together at their battery, while a ball comes and the captain\r\nfalls. 'Good,' says the lieutenant, 'now François is dead and I shall be\r\ncaptain.' 'Not yet,' says François, who was only stunned and who gets\r\nup on his feet. These two men were neither unfriendly nor inimical, only\r\nthe lieutenant wanted to rise a step higher in rank.\" And this shrewd\r\nobserver adds: \"Such was the furious egoism then styled love of glory\r\nand which, under this title, the Emperor had communicated to the\r\nFrench.\"\r\n\r\nOn this slope the slide is rapid and abject. Each, at first, thinks\r\nof himself; the individual makes of himself a center. The example,\r\nmoreover, comes from above. Is it for France or for himself that\r\nNapoleon works?[3362] So many immense enterprises, the conquest of\r\nSpain, the expedition into Russia, the installation of his brothers and\r\nrelations on new thrones, the constant partition and rearrangement of\r\nEurope, all those incessant and more and more distant wars, is it for\r\nthe public good and common safety that he accumulates them? What does\r\nhe himself desire if not to push his fortunes still farther?--He is too\r\nmuch ambitious (trop ambitionnaire), say his own soldiers;[3363] and yet\r\nthey follow him to the last. \"We have always marched along with him,\"\r\nreplied the old grenadiers,[3364] who had traversed Poland to penetrate\r\ninto Russia; \"we couldn't abandon him this time and leave him alone by\r\nhimself.\"--But others who see him nearer by, those who stand first and\r\nnext to him, do as he does; and, however high these have mounted, they\r\nwant to mount still higher, or, otherwise, to keep their places, or,\r\nat least, provide for themselves and hold on to something substantial.\r\nMasséna has accumulated forty millions and Talleyrand sixty;[3365] in\r\ncase of a political crash the money remains. Soult tried to have himself\r\nelected king of Portugal,[3366] and Bernadotte finds means to have\r\nhimself elected king of Sweden. After Leipsic, Murat bargains with the\r\nallies, and, to retain his Neapolitan kingdom, he agrees to furnish a\r\ncontingent against France; before the battle of Leipsic, Bernadotte is\r\nwith the allies and fights with them against France. In 1814, Bernadotte\r\nand Joseph, each caring for himself, the former by intrigues and with\r\nthe intriguers of the interior, also by feeling his way with the foreign\r\nsovereigns while the latter, in the absence of Napoleon, by \"singular\r\nefforts\" and \"assiduities\" beforehand with Marie Louise thinks of taking\r\nthe place of the falling emperor.[3367] Prince Eugene alone, or almost\r\nalone, among the great personalities of the reign, is really loyal, his\r\nloyalty remaining always intact exempt from concealed motives and above\r\nsuspicion. Everywhere else, the coming crash or sinister rumors are\r\nheard or anticipated; alarm descends from high places, spreads through\r\nthe army and echoes along the lines of the lowest ranks. In 1815, the\r\nsoldier has full confidence in himself and in Napoleon; \"but he is\r\nmoody, distrustful of his other leaders.... Every march incomprehensible\r\nto him makes him uneasy and he thinks himself betrayed.\"[3368] At\r\nWaterloo, dragoons that pass him with their swords drawn and old\r\ncorporals shout to the Emperor that Soult and Vandamme, who are at this\r\nmoment about going into battle, are haranguing their troops against him\r\nor deserting him; that General Dhénin, who has repulsed a charge of the\r\nenemy and whose thigh is fractured by a cannon-ball, has just passed\r\nover to the enemy. The mechanism which, for fifteen years, has worked so\r\nwell, breaks down of itself through its own action; its cog-wheels have\r\ngot out of gear; cracks show themselves in the metal which seemed\r\nso sound; the divinations of popular instinct verify this; the\r\nexaggerations of the popular imagination expand it and suddenly the\r\nwhole machine rattles down to the ground.\r\n\r\nAll this is due to Napoleon having introduced into it the craving for\r\nsuccess as central motor, as the universal main-spring, unscrupulous\r\nambition, in short, a crude egoism, and in the first place his own\r\negoism, [3369] and this incentive, strained to excess,[3370] puts the\r\nmachine out of order and then ruins it. After him, under his successors,\r\nthe same machinery is to work in the same manner, and break down in the\r\nsame way, at the expiration of a more or less extensive period. Thus\r\nfar, the longest of these periods has lasted less than twenty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3301: \"Most of the French provinces down to the time of\r\nRichelieu still possessed a special representative body which consented\r\nto and levied the taxes; most of these bodies were supported by the\r\nall-powerful minister and replaced by intendants who, from that time on,\r\nadministered, or rather exhausted, the country, divided into thirty-two\r\ngeneralities. A few provinces, however, Brittany, Burgundy, Languedoc,\r\na part of Provence, Flanders, Artois, and some small districts in the\r\nPyrenees kept their old representative body and were called pays d'état,\r\nwhilst other provinces were designated, by a strange abuse of language,\r\nunder the name of pays d'élection.\" (Translated from\" Madame de Staël et\r\nson Temps,\" vol.

DEFECT AND EFFECTS OF THE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I. LOCAL SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Human Incentives.\r\n\r\n     The two Stimuli of human action.--The egoistic instinct and\r\n     the social instinct.--Motives for not weakening the social\r\n     instinct.--Influence on society of the law it prescribes.\r\n     --The clauses of a statute depend on the legislator who adopts\r\n     or imposes them.--Conditions of a good statute.--It favors\r\n     the social instinct.--Different for different societies.\r\n     --Determined by the peculiar and permanent traits of the\r\n     society it governs.--Capital defect of the statute under the\r\n     new régime.\r\n\r\nSo long as a man takes an interest only in himself, in his own fortune,\r\nin his own advancement, in his own success, his interests are trivial:\r\nall that is, like himself, of little importance and of short duration.\r\nAlongside of the small boat which he steers so carefully there are\r\nthousands and millions of others of like it; none of them are\r\nworth much, and his own is not worth more. However well he may have\r\nprovisioned and sailed it, it will always remain what it is, slight and\r\nfragile; in vain will he hoist his flags, decorate it, and shove ahead\r\nto get the first place; in three steps he has reached its length.\r\nHowever well he handles and maintains it, in a few years it leaks;\r\nsooner or later it crumbles and sinks, and with it goes all his effort.\r\nIs it reasonable to work so hard for this, and is so slight an object\r\nworth so great an effort?\r\n\r\nFortunately, man has, for a better placement of his effort, other\r\naims, more vast and more substantial: a family, a commune, a church, a\r\ncountry, all the associations of which he is or becomes a member,\r\nall the collective undertakings in behalf of science, education, and\r\ncharity, of local or general utility, most of them provided with legal\r\nstatutes and organized as corporations or even as a legal entity. They\r\nare as well defined and protected as he is, but more precious and more\r\nviable: for they are of service to a large number of men and last for\r\never. Some, even, have a secular history, and their age predicts their\r\nlongevity. In the countless fleet of boats which so constantly sink,\r\nand which are so constantly replaced by others, they last like top\r\nrated liners. The men from the flotilla now and then sign on these large\r\nvessels, and the result of their labor is not, as it is at home, futile\r\nor short-lived; it will remain above the surface after he and his boat\r\nhave disappeared. It has entered into the common mass of work which owes\r\nits protection to its mass; undoubtedly the portion he contributes may\r\nbe worked over again later on; but its substance remains, and often also\r\nits form:\r\n\r\n* like a precept of Jesus,\r\n\r\n* like Archimedes' theorem\r\n\r\nwhich rests a definite acquisition, intact and permanently fixed for\r\ntwo thousand years, immortal from the first day.--Consequently, the\r\nindividual may take an interest, no longer merely in his own boat, but\r\nagain in some ship, in this or that particular one, in this or\r\nthat association or community, according to his preferences and his\r\naptitudes, according to attractiveness, proximity, and convenience of\r\naccess, all of which is a new motivation for his activities, opposing\r\nhis egoism, which, powerful as it may be, may still be overcome, since a\r\nsoul might be very generous or qualified by long and special discipline.\r\nOut of this issues every sacrifice, the surrender of one's-self to one's\r\nwork or to a cause,\r\n\r\n* the devotion of the sister of charity or of the missionary,\r\n\r\n* the abnegation of the scientist who buries himself for twenty years in\r\nthe minutia of a thankless task,\r\n\r\n* the heroism of the explorer who risks himself on a desert or among\r\nsavages,\r\n\r\n* the courage of the soldier who stakes his life in defense of his flag.\r\n\r\nBut these cases are rare; with the mass of men, and in most of their\r\nactions, personal interest prevails against common interest, while\r\nagainst the egoistic instinct the social instinct is feeble. Hence the\r\ndanger of weakening this. The temptation of the individual to prefer his\r\nown boat to the large ship is only too great; if it is desirable for him\r\nto go aboard and work there, he must be provided with the facilities\r\nand motives which prompt him to go aboard and do the work; at the very\r\nleast, he must not be deprived of them. Now, that depends on the State,\r\na sort of central flag-ship, the only one that is armed, and which has\r\nall subordinate vessels under its guns; for, whatever the society may\r\nbe, provincial or municipal, educational or charitable, religious or\r\nlaic, it is the State which sanctions or adopts its statues, good\r\nor bad, and which, by its laws, tribunals, and police, insures their\r\nexecution, whether rigidly or carelessly. Therefore, on this point, it\r\nis responsible; it must adopt or impose the proper statute, the\r\nmost suitable social form for strengthening the social instinct, for\r\nmaintaining disinterested zeal, for the encouragement of voluntary and\r\ngratuitous labor.\r\n\r\nThis form, of course, differs according to different societies; the same\r\ncharter or constitution is not proper for a church system and a commune,\r\nnor for a Protestant church and a Catholic church, nor for a town of\r\none hundred thousand inhabitants and a village of five hundred. Each\r\nassociation has its own peculiar and distinctive features, which grade\r\nit according to its kind, according to its spiritual or temporal aims,\r\naccording to its liberal or authoritative spirit, according to is small\r\nor large dimensions, according to the simplicity or complexity of\r\nits affairs, according to the capacity or incapacity of its members:\r\nfeatures which within it are both efficient and permanent; whatever the\r\nlegislator may do, these will remain and will regulate all activity.\r\nThus let him, in each case, keep this in mind. But in all cases his\r\noffice is the same; always, on drawing up and countersigning a statute,\r\nhe intervenes in the coming conflict between the social instinct and\r\nthe egoistic instinct; every provision which he enacts will contribute,\r\nnearby or at a distance, to the final ascendancy of the former or of\r\nthe latter. Now, the legislator the natural ally of the former, for the\r\nformer is his indispensable auxiliary. In every work or enterprise\r\nof public utility, if the legislator is the external promoter, social\r\ninstinct is the internal promoter; and on the inner spring becoming weak\r\nor breaking, the impulsion from outside remains without effect. Hence it\r\nis that, if the legislator would accomplish anything, otherwise than on\r\npaper, he must, before any object or interest, concern himself with the\r\nsocial instinct[4101]; thus preserving and humoring it; find room for it\r\nand its usefulness; let it have full play; getting all the service it is\r\ncapable of rendering, and especially not twist or release it.--In this\r\nrespect, any blunder might prove disastrous; and in every statute for\r\neach society, for each of the human vessels which gather together and\r\nserve as a retinue of individual vessels, there are two capital errors.\r\nOn the one hand, if the statute, in fact and practically, is or becomes\r\ntoo grossly unjust, if the rights and benefits which it confers are not\r\ncompensated by the duties and obligations it imposes; if it multiplies\r\nexcessive burdens for some and sinecures for others; if, at last,\r\nthe exploited individual discovers that he is overcharged beyond his\r\ndue,--thereafter he refuses on his own to add voluntarily to his load.\r\nLet others, let the favored and the privileged bear the gratuitous,\r\nextra weight. Far from stepping forward and offering his shoulders, he\r\ngets out of the way, hides himself, and lightens his load as much as he\r\ncan; he even rebels when he has a chance, and violently casts off every\r\nlegal burden, be it tax or due of any kind. Thus did the ancient régime\r\nperish.--On the other hand, if the statute withdraws the management of\r\nthe ship from those who are concerned; if, on this vessel, which belongs\r\nto them, it permanently installs a foreign crew, which assumes and\r\nexercises all command, then the owner of the vessel, reduced to the\r\nhumble condition of a mere subject and quiescent taxpayer, will no\r\nlonger feel concerned. Since the intruders exercise all authority, let\r\nthem have all the trouble; the working of the ship concerns them and not\r\nhim; he looks on as a spectator, without any idea of lending a hand; he\r\nfolds his arms, remains idle, and becomes critical.--Against the first\r\ndefect, the new régime is on its guard: there must be neither the\r\npreferred nor the disgraced, neither favors nor exemptions, neither\r\nexclusions nor releases, no more misappropriation, embezzlement, or\r\nrobbery, not alone in the State, but elsewhere in any direction,--in\r\nthe department, in the commune, in the Church, or in educational and\r\nbenevolent institutions. It excels in practicing distributive justice.\r\nThe second defect is its hidden flaw: the legislator having introduced\r\nthis into all local and special statutes, its effects differ according\r\nto different societies; but all these effects converge, paralyzing in\r\nthe nation the best half of the soul, and, worse still, to leading\r\nthe will astray and perverting the public mind, transforming generous\r\nimpulses into evil outbursts, and organizing lasting inertia, ennui,\r\ndiscontent, discord, feebleness, and sterility.[4102]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Local Community.\r\n\r\n     Local societies.--Their principal and distinctive\r\n     character.--Their type on a small scale.--A dwelling-house\r\n     in Annecy or Grenoble.--Compulsory association of its\r\n     inmates.--Its object and limits.--Private in character.\r\n\r\nLet us first consider local society whether a province, a department,\r\nor a county. For the past ten years (1789-99), the legislator has\r\nunceasingly deformed and assaulted. On his side, he refuses to open his\r\neyes; preoccupied with theories, he will not recognize it for what it is\r\nin reality, a society of a distinct species, different from the\r\nState, with its own peculiar aims, its limits marked out, its members\r\nprescribed, its statutes drawn up, everything formed and defined\r\nbeforehand. As it is local, it is founded on the greater or less\r\nproximity of its habitations. Thus, to comprehend it, we must take a\r\ncase in which this proximity is greatest that of certain houses in some\r\nof our southeastern towns, as, for example, Grenoble and Annecy. Here,\r\na house often belongs to several distinct owners, each possessing his\r\nstory, or apartment on a story, one owning the cellar and another the\r\nattic, each enjoying all the rights of property over his portion, the\r\nright of renting it, selling it, bequeathing it, and mortgaging it, but\r\nall holding it in common for the maintenance of the roof and the main\r\nwalls.--Evidently, their association is not a free one; willingly or\r\nnot, each forms a member of it, for, willingly or not, each benefits\r\nor suffers through the good or bad state of the roof and the principal\r\nwalls: therefore, all must furnish their quota of the indispensable\r\nexpenses; even a majority of votes would not rid them of these; one\r\nclaimant alone would suffice to hold them responsible; they have no\r\nright to impose on him the danger which they accept for themselves, nor\r\nto shirk expenses by which they profit as well as himself. Consequently,\r\non the report of an expert, the magistrate interferes, and, willingly or\r\nnot, the repairs are made; then, willingly or not, both by custom and in\r\nlaw, each pays his quote, calculated according to the locative value of\r\nthe portion belonging to him.--But here his obligations cease. In fact\r\nas in law, the community (of property) is restricted; the associates\r\ntake good care not to extend this, not to pursue other aims at the same\r\ntime, not to add to their primitive and natural purpose a different and\r\nsupplementary purpose, not to devote one room to a Christian chapel\r\nfor the residents of the house, another room for a kindergarten for the\r\nchildren that live in it, and a side room to a small hospital for those\r\nwho fall ill; especially, they do not admit that a tax may be imposed\r\nfor these purposes and each of them be subject to a proportional\r\nincrease of assessment at so many additional centimes per franc.[4103]\r\nFor, if the proprietor of the ground-floor is an Israelite, the\r\nproprietor of a room on the second story is a bachelor, the proprietor\r\nof the fine suite of rooms on the first story is rich, and has a doctor\r\nvisit him at the house, these must pay for a service for which they get\r\nno return.--For the same reason, their association remains private; it\r\ndoes not form part of the public domain; they alone are interested in\r\nit; if the State let us use its tribunals and officials, it is the same\r\nas it is with ordinary private individuals. It would be unjust both\r\nagainst it and against itself if it would exclude or exempting it from\r\ncommon right, if it put it on its administrative rolls. It would deform\r\nand disrupt its work if it interfered with its independence, if added\r\nto its functions or to its obligations. It is not under its tutelage,\r\nobliged to submit its accounts to the prefect; it delegates no powers\r\nand confers no right of justice, or police; in short, it is neither\r\nits pupil nor its agent. Such is the lien which permanent proximity\r\nestablishes between men; we see that it is of a singular species:\r\nneither in fact, nor in law, can the associates free themselves from\r\nit; solely because they are neighbors, they form a community for certain\r\nindivisible or jointly owned things, an involuntary and obligatory\r\ncommunity. To make amends, and even owing to this, I mean through\r\ninstitution and in the natural order of things, their community\r\nis limited, and limited in two ways, restricted to its object and\r\nrestricted to its members, reduced to matters of which proprietorship\r\nor enjoyment is forcibly in common, and reserved to inhabitants who, on\r\naccount of situation and fixed residence, possess this enjoyment or this\r\nproperty.i\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Essential Public Local Works.\r\n\r\n     Analysis of other local societies, commune, department, or\r\n     province.--Common interests which necessitate local action.\r\n     --Two objects in view: care of public roads and means of\r\n     protection against spreading calamities.--Why collaboration\r\n     is an obligation.--Neighbors involuntarily subject to a\r\n     common bond on account of proximity.--Willingly or not each\r\n     shares in its benefits.--What portion of the expense belongs\r\n     to each.--Equal advantages for each.--The unequal and\r\n     proportionate advantages for each in his private expenses,\r\n     industrial or commercial gains, and in the locative value of\r\n     his real estate.--Each person's quota of expense according\r\n     to his equal and proportionate share in advantages.\r\n\r\nAll local societies are of this kind, each limited to a certain\r\nterritory and included with others like it inside a larger area, each\r\npossessing two budgets depending on whether it is a distinct body or\r\nmember of a larger corporation, each, from the commune to the department\r\nor province, instituted on a basis of interests which make them jointly\r\nbut involuntarily liable.--There are two of these important interests\r\nwhich, as in the Annecy building, elude human arbitrariness, which\r\ndemand common action and distribution of the expense, because, as in the\r\nAnnecy building, they are the inevitable results of physical proximity:\r\n\r\nFirst, comes care for the public highways, by land or by water, river\r\nnavigation, canals, towing-paths, bridges, streets, public squares,\r\nby-roads, along with the more or less optional and gradual improvements\r\nwhich public roads demand or prescribe, such as their laying-out,\r\nsidewalks, paving, sweeping, lighting, drainage, sewers, rolling,\r\nditches, leveling, embankments, and other engineering works, which\r\nestablish or increase safety and convenience in circulation, with\r\nfacilities for and dispatch in transportation.\r\n\r\nNext, comes protection against the spread of calamities, such as fires,\r\ninundations, contagious diseases, epidemics, along with the more or\r\nless optional and remote precautions which this protection exacts or\r\nrecommends, night watchers in Russia, dikes in Holland, levees in\r\nthe valleys of the Po and the Loire, cemeteries and regulations for\r\ninterment, cleanliness of the streets, ventilation of holes and\r\ncorners, drainage of marshes, hydrants, and supplies of drinkable water,\r\ndisinfecting of contaminated areas, and other preventive or necessary\r\nhygienic measures which remove or prevent insalubrities growing out of\r\nneighborhood or contact.\r\n\r\nAll this has to be provided for, and the enterprise, if not wholly\r\nand in its developments, at least in itself and in what is necessary,\r\nimposes itself, collectively, on all the inhabitants of the\r\nconscription, from the highest to the lowest. For, in the absence of a\r\npublic road, none of them can do his daily work, travel about, or even\r\nleave his premises; while transportation ceases and trade is suspended;\r\nhence, commerce and other pursuits languish, industry is arrested,\r\nagriculture becomes impracticable or fruitless; the fields are no longer\r\ncultivated; while provisions, food, including bread,[4104] everything is\r\nwanting; the dwellings becoming uninhabitable, more so than the Annecy\r\nhouses when the roofs fall in and let in the rain.--On the other hand,\r\nfor lack of protection against calamities, these get a free rein: the\r\nday arrives when an equinoctial tide submerges the flat coastal area,\r\nwhen the river overflows and devastates the countryside, when the\r\nconflagration spreads, when small-pox and the cholera reach a contagious\r\npoint, and life is in danger, far more seriously imperiled than when, in\r\nthe Annecy domicile, the main walls threaten to tumble down.[4105]\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, I can personally accept this miserable condition of things,\r\nresign myself to it, and consent, as far as I am concerned, to shut\r\nmyself up within my own walls, to fast there, and run the risk, more or\r\nless imminent, of being drowned, burnt, or poisoned; but I have no\r\nright to condemn another to do this, nor to refuse my contribution to a\r\nprotection by which I am to profit. As to my share of the expense it is\r\nfixed beforehand, and fixed through my share in the benefit:\r\n\r\nWhoever receives, owes, and in proportion to what he receives;\r\n\r\nsuch is an equitable exchange; no society is prosperous and healthy\r\nwithout this; it is essential that, for each member of it, the duties\r\nshould exactly compensate the advantages, and that the two sides of the\r\nscale should balance. In the local community, the care taken of public\r\nroads and the precautions taken against natural calamities are useful in\r\ntwo ways: one, which especially improves the condition of persons, and\r\nthe other, which especially improves the condition of things. The first\r\nis equal and the same for all. The poor man, quite as much as the rich\r\none, needs to go and come and to look after his affairs; he uses the\r\nstreet, pavement, sidewalks, bridges, highways, and public fountains\r\nquite as much; he equally benefits by the sweeping and lighting of the\r\npublic gardens. It may be claimed that, in certain respects, he derives\r\nmore benefits from all this; for he suffers sooner and more keenly when\r\nbad roads stop transportation, arrest labor, and increase the cost of\r\nfood; he is more subject to contagion, to epidemics, to all physical\r\nills; in case of a fire, the risks of a workman in his garret, at the\r\ntop of steep, narrow stairs, are greater than those of the opulent\r\nproprietor on the first story, in a mansion provided with a broad range\r\nof steps. In case of inundation, the danger is more suddenly mortal for\r\nthe humble villager, in his fragile tenement, than for the gentleman\r\nfarmer in his massive constructions. Accordingly, under this heading,\r\nthe poor man owes as much as the rich one; the rich man, at least, owes\r\nno more than the poor one; if, each year, the poor man cannot pay but\r\none franc, the rich one, each year, should not pay more than that sum\r\nlikewise.--The second advantage, on the contrary, is not equal for all,\r\nbut more or less great for each, according to what he spends on the\r\nspot, according to his industrial or commercial gains, and according to\r\nhis local income. Indeed, the more perfect the public highway is, the\r\nmore are the necessities and conveniences of life; whatever is agreeable\r\nand useful, even distant and remote, more within reach, and at my\r\ndisposition, in my very hands, I enjoy it to the utmost, the measure of\r\nmy enjoyment of it being the importance of my purchases, everything\r\nI consume, in short, my home expenditure.[4106] If I am, besides,\r\nindustrial or in commerce, the state of the public highway affects me\r\neven more; for my transportation, more or less costly, difficult and\r\nslow, depends on that, and next, the receipt of my raw materials and\r\ngoods, the sale of my manufactures, the dispatch of my merchandise,\r\nbought and sold, while the measure of this special interest, so direct\r\nand so intense, is the annual sum-total of my business, or, more\r\nstrictly speaking, the probable sum of my profits.[4107] If, finally,\r\nI own real estate, a house or land, its locative value increases or\r\ndiminishes according to the salubrity and convenience of its site,\r\ntogether with its facilities for cultivating, selling, and distributing\r\nits crops, for its various outlets, for its security against floods and\r\nfires, and, after this, to improvements in public transit, and to the\r\ncollective works which protect both soil and buildings against natural\r\ncalamities.[4108] It follows that the inhabitant who benefits from these\r\nservices, owes a second contribution, greater or lesser according to the\r\ngreater or lesser advantage which he derives from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Local associations.\r\n\r\n     Local society, thus constituted, is a collective legal\r\n     entity.--The sphere of its initiation and action.--Its\r\n     relation to the State.--Distinction between the private and\r\n     the public domain.\r\n\r\nSuch is in itself local society and, with or without the legislator's\r\npermission, we find it to be a private syndicate,[4109] analogous\r\nto many others.[4110] Whether communal or departmental, it concerns,\r\ncombines, and serves none but the inhabitants of one circumscription;\r\nits success or failure does not interest the nation, unless indirectly,\r\nand through a remote reaction, similar to the slight effect which, for\r\ngood or ill, the health or sickness of one Frenchman produces on the\r\nmass of Frenchmen. That which directly and fully affects a local society\r\nis felt only by that society, the same as that which affects a private\r\nindividual is felt only by him; it is a close corporation, and belongs\r\nto itself within its physical limits, the same as he, in his, belongs to\r\nhimself; like him, then, it is an individual, less simple, but no less\r\nreal, a human combination, endowed with reason and will, responsible\r\nfor its acts, capable of wronging and being wronged; in brief, a legal\r\nentity. Such, in fact, it is, and, through the explicit declaration\r\nof the legislator, who constitutes it a legal entity, capable of\r\npossessing, acquiring, and contracting, and of prosecuting in the courts\r\nof law: he likewise confers on the eighty-six departments and on the\r\nthirty-six thousand communes all the legal capacities and obligations of\r\nan ordinary individual. The State, consequently, in relationship to them\r\nand to all collective persons, is what it is with respect to a private\r\nindividual, neither more nor less; its title to intervene between them\r\nis not different. As justiciary, it owes them justice the same as to\r\nprivate persons, nothing more or less; only to render this to them, it\r\nhas more to do, for they are composite and complex. By virtue even of\r\nits mandate, it is bound to enter their domiciles in the performance of\r\nits duty, to maintain probity and to prevent disorder, to protect there\r\nnot alone the governed against the governors and the governors against\r\nthe governed, but again the community, which is lasting, against its\r\ndirectors, who are temporary, to assign to each member his quota of dues\r\nor of charges, and his quote of influence or of authority, to regulate\r\nthe way in which the society shall support and govern itself, to decide\r\nupon and sanction the equitable statute, to oversee and impose its\r\nexecution, that is to say, in sum to maintain the right of each person\r\nand oblige each to pay what he owes.--This is difficult and delicate.\r\nBut, being done, the collective personality is, as much as any\r\nindividual, complete and defined, independent and distinct from the\r\nState; by the same title as that of the individual, it has its own\r\ncircle of initiation and of action, its separate domain, which is its\r\nprivate affair. The State, on its side, has its own affairs too, which\r\nare those of the public; and thus, in the nature of things, both circles\r\nare distinct; neither of them should prey upon or encroach on the\r\nother.--Undoubtedly, local societies and the State may help each other,\r\nlend each other their agents, and thus avoid employing two for one; may\r\nreduce their official staff, diminish their expenses, and, through\r\nthis interchange of secondary offices, do their work better and more\r\neconomically. For example, the commune and the department may let the\r\nState collect and deposit their \"additional centimes,\" borrow from it\r\nfor this purpose its assessors and other accountants, and thus receive\r\ntheir revenues with no drawback, almost gratis, on the appointed day.\r\nIn the like manner, the State has very good reason for entrusting the\r\ndepartmental council with the re-distribution of its direct taxes among\r\nthe districts, and the district council with the same re-distribution\r\namong the communes: in this way it saves trouble for itself, and there\r\nis no other more effective mode of ensuring an equitable allocation.\r\nIt will similarly be preferable to have the mayor, rather than anybody\r\nelse, handle petty public undertakings, which nobody else could do as\r\nreadily and as surely, with less trouble, expense, and mistakes, with\r\nfewer legal document, registers of civil status, advertisements of laws\r\nand regulations, transmissions by the orders of public authorities to\r\ninterested parties, and of local information to the public authorities\r\nwhich they need, the preparation and revision of the electoral lists and\r\nof conscripts, and co-operation in measures of general security. Similar\r\ncollaboration is imposed on the captain of a merchant vessel, on the\r\nadministrators of a railway, on the director of a hotel or even of a\r\nfactory, and this does not prevent the company which runs the ship, the\r\nrailway, the hotel, or the factory, from enjoying full ownership and\r\nthe free disposition of its capital; from holding meetings, passing\r\nresolutions, electing directors, appointing its managers, and regulating\r\nits own affairs, preserving intact that precious faculty of possessing,\r\nof willing and of acting, which cannot be lost or alienated without\r\nceasing to be a personality. To remain a personality (i.e. a legal\r\nentity), such is the main interest and right of all persons, singly\r\nor collectively, and therefore of local communities and of the State\r\nitself; it must be careful not to abdicate and be careful not to\r\nusurp.--It renounces in favor of local societies when, through optimism\r\nor weakness, it hands a part of the public domain over to them; when\r\nit gives them the responsibility for the collection of its taxes, the\r\nappointment of its judges and police-commissioners, the employment of\r\nits armed forces, when it delegates local functions to them which\r\nit should exercise itself, because it is the special and responsible\r\ndirector, the only one who is in a suitable position, competent, well\r\nprovided, and qualified to carry them out. On the other side, it causes\r\nprejudice to the local societies, when it appropriates to itself a\r\nportion of their private domain, when it confiscates their possessions,\r\nwhen it disposes of their capital or income arbitrarily, when it imposes\r\non them excessive expenses for worship, charity, education, and any\r\nother service which properly belongs to a different association; when it\r\nrefuses to recognize in the mayor the representative of the commune and\r\nthe government official, when it subordinates the first of these two\r\ntitles to the second, when it claims the right of giving or taking away,\r\nthrough with the second which belongs to it, the first which does\r\nnot belong to it, when in practice and in its grasp the commune\r\nand department cease to be private companies in order to become\r\nadministrative compartments.--According to the opportunity and the\r\ntemptation, it glides downhill, now toward the surrender of its duty,\r\nand now toward the meddlesome interference of an intruder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Local versus State authority.\r\n\r\n     Case in which the State abdicates.--Anarchy during the\r\n     Revolution.--Case in which the State usurps.--Regime of the\r\n     year VIII.--Remains of local independence under the ancient\r\n     regime.--Destroyed under the new regime.--Local society\r\n     after 1800.\r\n\r\nFrom and after 1789, the State, passing through intermittent fits and\r\nstarts of brutal despotism, had resigned its commission. Under its\r\nalmost nominal sovereignty, there were in France forty-four thousand\r\nsmall States enjoying nearly sovereign power, and, most frequently,\r\nsovereignty in reality.[4111] Not only did the local community manage\r\nits private affairs, but again, in the circumscription, each exercised\r\nthe highest public functions, disposed of the national guard, of the\r\npolice force, and even of the army, appointed civil and criminal judges,\r\npolice commissioners,[4112] the assessors and collectors of taxes. In\r\nbrief, the central State handed over, or allowed the seizure of the\r\npowers of which it ought never to deprive itself, the last of its means\r\nby which alone it acts effectively and on the spot,\r\n\r\n* its sword, which it alone should wield,\r\n\r\n* its scales of justice, which it alone should hold,\r\n\r\n* its purse, for it to fill, and we have seen with what harm to\r\nindividuals, to the communes, and to itself, with what a lamentable\r\nseries of disastrous results:\r\n\r\n* universal, incurable, persistent anarchy,\r\n\r\n* impotence of the government,\r\n\r\n* violation of the laws,\r\n\r\n* complete stoppage of revenue, an empty treasury,\r\n\r\n* despotism of the strong, oppression of the weak,\r\n\r\n* street riots,\r\n\r\n* rural brigandage,\r\n\r\n* extortions and waste at the town halls,\r\n\r\n* municipal usurpations and abdications,\r\n\r\n* ruin of the highways, and all useful public works and buildings, and\r\n\r\n* the ruin and distress of the communes.[4113]\r\n\r\nIn contrast with this, and through disgust, the new Régime takes the\r\nother side, and even goes to the other extreme; the central State, in\r\n1800, no longer a party that has resigned, as formerly, becomes the\r\ninterloper. Not only does it take back from local communities the\r\nportion of the public domain which had been imprudently conceded to\r\nthem, but, again, it lays its hand on their private domain; it\r\nattaches them to it by way of appendices, while its systematic, uniform\r\nusurpation, accomplished at one blow, spread over the whole territory,\r\nagain plunges them all, communes and departments alike, into a chaos in\r\nwhich, under the old monarchy, they would never have fallen.\r\n\r\nBefore 1789, collective legal entities (persons), provincial and\r\ncommunal, still existed. On the one hand, five or six great local\r\nbodies, represented by elective assemblies, full of life and\r\nspontaneously active, among others those of Languedoc and Brittany,\r\nstill provided for and governed themselves. The other provinces, which\r\nthe central power had reduced to administrative districts, retained, at\r\nleast, their historic cohesion, their time-honored name, the lament for,\r\nor at least the souvenir of, their former autonomy, and, here and there,\r\na few vestiges or fragments of their lost independence; and, better yet,\r\nthese old, paralyzed, but not mutilated bodies, had just assumed new\r\nlife, and under their renewed organism were striving to give the\r\nblood in their veins a fresh start. Twenty-one provincial assemblies,\r\ninstituted over the entire territory, between 1778 and 1787, and\r\nprovided with powers of considerable importance, undertook, each in its\r\nown sphere, to direct provincial interests. Communal interest, also,\r\nhad its representatives in the urban or rural communes. In the towns, a\r\ndeliberative assembly, composed of the leading notables and of delegates\r\nelected by all the corporations and communities in the place, formed an\r\nintermittent municipal council the same as to-day, but much more ample,\r\nwhich voted and passed resolutions on important occasions; there was a\r\nboard of management at the head of it, \"the town corps,\" comprising\r\nthe various municipal officials, the mayor, his lieutenant, sheriffs,\r\nprosecuting attorney, treasurer, and clerk,[4114] now elected by the\r\ndeliberative assembly, now the legal purchasers, heirs, and proprietors\r\nof their office, the same as a notary or advocate of to-day owns\r\nhis office, protected against administrative caprices by a royal\r\nacquittance, and, for a money consideration, titular in their towns, the\r\nsame as a parliamentarian in his parliament, and hence planted in, or\r\ngrafted upon, the commune like a parliamentarian among his peers, and,\r\nlike him, defenders of local interests against the central power.--In\r\nthe village, the heads of families met together on the public square,\r\ndeliberated in common over common affairs, elected the syndic, likewise\r\nthe collectors of the taille, and deputies to the intendant; of their\r\nown accord, but with his approval, they taxed themselves for the support\r\nof the school, for repairs to the church or fountain, and for beginning\r\nor carrying on a suit in court.--All these remains of the ancient\r\nprovincial and communal initiative, respected or tolerated by\r\nmonarchical centralization, are crushed out and extinguished. The First\r\nConsul very soon falls upon these local societies and seizes them in his\r\nclaws; in the eyes of the new legislator they scarcely seem to exist;\r\nthere must not be any local personalities for him. The commune and\r\ndepartment, in his eyes, are merely territorial districts, physical\r\nportions of the public domain, provincial workshops to which the central\r\nState transfers and uses its tools, in order to work effectively and on\r\nthe spot. Here, as elsewhere, he takes the business entirely in his own\r\nhands; if he employs interested parties it is only as auxiliaries, at\r\nodd times, for a few days, to operate with more discernment and more\r\neconomy, to listen to complaints and promises, to become better informed\r\nand the better to apportion changes; but, except this occasional and\r\nsubordinate help, the members of the local society must remain passive\r\nin the local society; they are to pay and obey, and nothing more. Their\r\ncommunity no longer belongs to them, but to the government; its chiefs\r\nare functionaries who depend on him, and not on it; it no longer issues\r\nits mandate; all its legal mandatories, all its representatives and\r\ndirectors, municipal or general councilors, mayors, sub-prefects\r\nor prefects, are imposed on it from above, by a foreign hand, and,\r\nwillingly or not, instead of choosing them, it has to put up with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. Local Elections under the First Consul.\r\n\r\n     Lists of notables.--Sénatus-consultes of the year X.\r\n     --Liberal institution becomes a reigning instrument.\r\n     --Mechanism of the system of appointments and candidatures.\r\n     --Decree of 1806 and suppression of candidatures.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning, an effort was made to put in practice the\r\nconstitutional principle proposed by Sieyès: Power in future, according\r\nthe accepted formula, must come from above and confidence from below. To\r\nthis end, in the year IX, the assembled citizens appointed one-tenth\r\nof their number, about 500,000 communal notables, and these, likewise\r\nassembled, appointed also one-tenth of their number, about 50,000\r\ndepartmental notables. The government selected from this list the\r\nmunicipal councilors of each commune, and, from this second list, the\r\ngeneral councilors of each department.--The machine, however, is\r\nclumsy, difficult to set going, still more difficult to manage, and too\r\nunreliable in its operation. According to the First Consul, it is an\r\nabsurd system, \"a childish piece of ideology; a great nation should\r\nnot be organized in this way.\"[4115] At bottom,[4116] \"he does not want\r\nnotables accepted by the nation. In his system, he is to declare who\r\nthe notables of the nation shall be and stamp them with the seal of the\r\nState; it is not for the nation to present them to the head of the State\r\nstamped with the national seal.\" Consequently, at the end of a year, he\r\nbecomes, through the establishment of electoral colleges, the veritable\r\ngrand-elector of all the notables; he has transformed, with his usual\r\naddress, a liberal institution into a reigning instrumentality.[4117]\r\nProvisionally, he holds on to the list of communal notables, \"because it\r\nis the work of the people, the result of a grand movement which must\r\nnot prove useless, and because, moreover, it contains a large number\r\nof names.... offering a wide margin from which to make good\r\nselections.[4118] He brings together these notables in each canton, and\r\ninvites them to designate their trusty men, the candidates from which he\r\nwill choose municipal councilors. But, as there are very few cultivated\r\nmen in the rural districts, \"nearly always it is the old seignior who\r\nwould get himself designated\";[4119] it is essential that the hand of\r\nthe government should not be forced, that its faculty of choosing should\r\nnot be restricted. Thus, the presentation of municipal councilors\r\nof that category must cease, there must no longer be any preliminary\r\ncandidates. Now, according the sénatus-consulte, this category is a\r\nlarge one, for it comprises all communes of less than 5000 souls, and\r\ntherefore over 35,000 municipal councils out of 36,000, whose members\r\nare appointed arbitrarily, without the citizens whom they represent\r\ntaking any part in their nomination.--Four or five hundred average\r\nor large communes still remain, in which for each municipal post, the\r\ncantonal assembly designates two candidates between whom the government\r\nchooses. Let us see this assembly duly installed and at work.\r\n\r\nIts president, as a precautionary step, is imposed upon it. He is\r\nappointed in advance by the government, and is well informed as to what\r\nthe government wants. He alone controls the police of the chamber and\r\nthe order of all deliberations. On opening the session, he draws a list\r\nfrom his pocket, which list, furnished by the government, contains the\r\nnames of one hundred of the heaviest taxpayers of the canton, from whom\r\nthe assembly must select its candidates. The lists lies spread out on\r\nthe table, and the electors advance in turn, spell the names, and try to\r\nread it over. The president would not be very adroit and show but little\r\nzeal did he not help them in reading it, and if he did not point out by\r\nsome sign, a tone of the voice, or even a direct word, what names\r\nwere agreeable to the government. Now, this government, which has five\r\nhundred thousand bayonets at command, dislikes opposition: the electors\r\nknow it, and look twice before expressing any counter opinion; it is\r\nvery probable that most of the names suggested by the government are\r\nfound on their ballots; were only one-half of them there, these would\r\nsuffice; of the two candidates proposed for each place, if one is\r\nacceptable this one will be elected; after making him a candidate the\r\ngovernment makes sure that he will become titular. The first act of\r\nthe electoral comedy is played, and it is not long before no trouble\r\nwhatever is taken to play it. After January, 1806, by virtue of a\r\ndecree which has passed himself, Napoleon is the only one[4120] who will\r\ndirectly fill every vacancy in the municipal councils; from now on these\r\ncouncils are to owe their existence wholly to him. The two qualities\r\nwhich constitute them, and which, according to Sieyès, are derived from\r\ntwo distinct sources, are now derived from only one source. Only the\r\nEmperor can confer upon them both public confidence and legal power.\r\n\r\nThe second act of the comedy begins; this act is more complicated, and\r\ncomprises several scenes which end, some of them, in the appointment of\r\nthe arrondissement councils, and others in that of the council-general\r\nof the department. We will take only the latter, the most\r\nimportant;[4121] there are two, one following the other, and in\r\ndifferent places.--The first one[4122] is played in the cantonal\r\nassembly above described; the president, who has just directed the\r\nchoice of municipal candidates, draws from his portfolio another list,\r\nlikewise furnished to him by the prefect, and on which six hundred names\r\nof those who pay the heaviest taxes in the department are printed. It is\r\nfrom among these six hundred that the cantonal assembly must elect ten\r\nor twelve members who, with their fellows, chosen in the same way by\r\nthe other cantonal assemblies, will form the electoral college of the\r\ndepartment, and take their seats at the chief town of the prefecture.\r\nThis time again, the president, who is the responsible leader of\r\nthe cantonal flock, takes care to conduct it; his finger on the list\r\nindicates to the electors which names the government prefers; if need\r\nbe, he adds a word to the sign he makes, and, probably, the voters will\r\nbe as docile as before; and all the more because the composition of the\r\nelectoral college only half interests them. This college, unlike the\r\nmunicipal council, does not touch or hold any of them on their sensitive\r\nside; it is not obliged to tighten or loosen their purse-strings; it\r\ndoes not vote the \"additional centimes\"; it does not meddle with their\r\nbusiness; it there only for show, to simulate the absent people, to\r\npresent candidates, and thus perform the second electoral scene in the\r\nsame way as the first one, but at the chief town of the prefecture and\r\nby new actors. These extras are also led by a head conductor, appointed\r\nby the government, and who is responsible for their behavior, \"a\r\npresident who has in sole charge the police of their assembled college,\"\r\nand must direct their voting. For each vacancy in the council-general of\r\nthe department, they are to present two names; certainly, almost without\r\nany help, and with only a discrete hint, they will guess the suitable\r\nnames. For they are smarter, more open-minded, than the backward and\r\nrural members of a cantonal assembly; they are better informed and\r\nbetter \"posted,\" they have visited the prefect and know his opinion, the\r\nopinion of the government, and they vote accordingly. It is certain that\r\none-half, at least, of the candidates whom they present on the list are\r\ngood, and that suffices, since twice the required number of candidates\r\nhave to be nominated. And yet, in Napoleon's eye, this is not\r\nsufficient. For the nomination of general councilors,[4123] as well as\r\nthat of municipal councilors, he suppresses preliminary candidature, the\r\nlast remnant of popular representation or delegation. According to\r\nhis theory, he is himself the sole representative and delegate of the\r\npeople, invested with full powers, not alone in the State, but again\r\nin the department and commune, the prime and the universal motor of the\r\nentire machine, not merely at the center, but again at the extremities,\r\ndispenser of all public employments, not merely to suggest the candidate\r\nfor these and make him titular, but again to create directly and at\r\nonce, both titular and candidate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Municipal and general councillors under the Empire.\r\n\r\n     Quality of municipal and general councilors under the\r\n     Consulate and the Empire.--Object of their meetings.--Limits\r\n     of their power.--Their real role.--Role of the prefect and\r\n     of the government.\r\n\r\nObserve the selections which he imposes on himself beforehand; these\r\nselections are those to which he has tied down the electoral bodies.\r\nBeing the substitute of these bodies, he takes, as they do, general\r\ncouncilors from those in the department who pay the most taxes, and\r\nmunicipal councilors from those most taxed in the canton. One the\r\nother hand, by virtue of the municipal law, it is from the municipal\r\ncouncilors that he chooses the mayor. Thus the local auxiliaries and\r\nagents he employs are all notables of the place, the leading landowners\r\nand largest manufacturers and merchants. He systematically enrolls the\r\ndistributors of labor on his side, all who, through their wealth and\r\nresidence, through their enterprises and expenditure on the spot,\r\nexercise local influence and authority. In order not to omit any of\r\nthese, and be able to introduce into the general council this or that\r\nrich veteran of the old régime, or this or that parvenu of the new\r\nrégime who is not rich, he has reserved to himself the right of adding\r\ntwenty eligible members to the list, \"ten of which must be taken from\r\namong citizens belonging to the Legion of Honor, or having rendered\r\nimportant services, and ten taken from among the thirty in the\r\ndepartment who pay the most taxes.\" In this way none of the notables\r\nescape him; he recruits them as he pleases and according to his needs,\r\nnow among men of the revolution who he does not want to see discredited\r\nor isolated,[4124] now among men of the old monarchy whom he wants\r\nto rally to himself by favor or by force. Such is the Baron de\r\nVitrolles,[4125] who, without asking for the place, becomes mayor of\r\nVersailles and councilor-general in Basses-Alps, and then, a little\r\nlater, at his peril, inspector of the imperial sheepfolds. Such is the\r\nCount de Villèle, who, on returning to his estate of Morville, after an\r\nabsence of fourteen years, suddenly, \"before having determined where he\r\nwould live, either in town or in the country,\" finds himself mayor\r\nof Morville. To make room for him, his predecessor is removed and the\r\nlatter, \"who, since the commencement of the Revolution, has performed\r\nthe functions of mayor,\" is let down to the post of assistant. Shortly\r\nafter this the government appoints M. de Villèle president of the\r\ncantonal assembly. Naturally the assembly, advised underhandedly,\r\npresents him as a candidate for the general council of Haute-Garonne,\r\nand the government places him in that office.--\"All the notable\r\nland-owners of the department formed part of this council, and the\r\nRestoration still found us there seven years afterwards. General orders\r\nevidently existed, enjoining the prefects to give preference in their\r\nchoice to the most important land-owners in the country.\" Likewise,\r\nNapoleon everywhere selects the mayors from the rich and\r\nwell-to-do class\"; in the large towns he appoints only \"people with\r\ncarriages.\"[4126] Many of them in the country and several in the towns\r\nare legitimists[4127], at least at heart, and Napoleon knows it; but,\r\nas he says; \"these folks do not want the earthquake\"; they are too\r\nmuch interested, and too personally, in the maintenance of order.[4128]\r\nMoreover, to represent his government, he needs decorative people; and\r\nit is only these who can be so gratis, be themselves, look well, at\r\ntheir own expense, and on the spot. Besides, they are the most informed,\r\nthe best able to supervise accounts, to examine article by article the\r\nbudgets of the department and commune, to comprehend the necessity of\r\na road and the utility of a canal, to offer pertinent observations,\r\nto proclaim wise decisions, to obey orders as discreet and useful\r\ncollaborators. All this they will not refuse to do if they are sensible\r\npeople. In every form of government, it is better to be with the\r\ngovernors than with the governed, and in this case, when the broom\r\nis wielded from above and applied so vigorously and with such\r\nmeticulousness to everybody and everything, it is well to be as near the\r\nhandle as possible.\r\n\r\nAnd what is still better, they will volunteer, especially at the\r\nbeginning, if they are good people. For, at least during the first\r\nyears, one great object of the new government is the re-establishment\r\nof order in the local as well as in the general administration. It is\r\nwell-disposed and desires to mend matters; it undertakes the suppression\r\nof robbery, theft, embezzlement, waste, premeditated or unintentional\r\narrogation of authority, extravagance, negligence and failure.\r\n\r\n\"Since 1790,\"[4129] says the First Consul to the minister of the\r\ninterior, \"the 36,000 communes represent, in France, 36,000 orphans.\r\n.. girls abandoned or plundered during ten years by their municipal\r\nguardians, appointed by the Convention and the Directory. In changing\r\nthe mayors, assistants, and councilors of the commune, scarcely more\r\nhas been done than to change the mode of stealing; they have stolen\r\nthe communal highway, the by-roads, the trees, and have robbed the\r\nChurch;[4130] they have stolen the furniture belonging to the commune\r\nand are still stealing under the spineless municipal system of year\r\nVIII.\"\r\n\r\nAll these abuses are investigated and punished;[4131] he thieves are\r\nobliged to restore and will steal no more. The county budget, like of\r\nthe State, must now be prepared every year,[4132] with the same method,\r\nprecision, and clearness, receipts on one side and expenses on the\r\nother, each section divided into chapters and each chapter into\r\narticles, the state of the liabilities, each debt, the state of the\r\nassets and a tabular enumeration of distinct resources, available\r\ncapital and unpaid claims, fixed income and variable income, certain\r\nrevenue and possible revenue. In no case must \"the calculation of\r\npresumable expenditure exceed the amount of presumable income.\" In no\r\ncase must \"the commune demand or obtain an extra tax for its ordinary\r\nexpenses.\" Exact accounts and rigid economy, such are everywhere\r\nindispensable, as well as preliminary reforms, when a badly kept house\r\nhas to be transformed into one which is kept in good order. The First\r\nConsul has at heart these two reforms and he adheres to them. Above\r\nall there must be no more indebtedness; now, more than one-half of the\r\ncommunes are in debt. \"Under penalty of dismissal, the prefect is to\r\nvisit the communes at least twice a year, and the sub-prefect four times\r\na year.[4133] A reward must be given to mayors who free their commune\r\nof debt in two years, and the government will appoint a special\r\ncommissioner to take charge of the administration of a commune which,\r\nafter a delay of five years, shall not be liberated. The fifty mayors\r\nwho, each year, shall have most contributed to unencumber their commune\r\nand assure that is has resources available, shall be summoned to Paris\r\nat the expense of the State, and presented in solemn session to the\r\nthree consults. A column, raised at the expense of the government and\r\nplaced at the principal entrance of the town or village, will transmit\r\nto posterity the mayor's name, and, besides, this inscription: 'To the\r\nguardian of the commune, a grateful country.'\"\r\n\r\nInstead of these semi-poetic honors adapted to the imaginations of the\r\nyear VIII, take the positive honors adapted to the imaginations of the\r\nyear XII, and the following years, brevets and grades, decorations of\r\nthe Legion d'Honneur, the titles of chevalier, baron, and count,[4134]\r\npresents and endowments,--the rewards offered to the representatives of\r\nlocal society, the same as to the other functionaries, but on the same\r\ncondition that they will likewise be functionaries, that is to say,\r\ntools in the hands of the government. In this respect, every precaution\r\nis taken, especially against those who, forming a collective body,\r\nmay be tempted to consider themselves a deliberative assembly, such\r\nas municipal and general councils, less easily handled than single\r\nindividuals and, at times, capable of not being quite so docile. None of\r\nthese can hold sessions of more than fifteen days in the year; each must\r\naccept its budget of receipts and expenses, almost complete and ready\r\nmade, from the prefecture. In the way of receipts, its powers consist\r\nwholly in voting certain additional and optional centimes, more or less\r\nnumerous, at will, \"within the limits established by law\";[4135] again,\r\neven within these limits, its decision can be carried out only after an\r\nexamination and approval at the prefecture. There is the same regulation\r\nin regard to expenses; the council, indeed, municipal or general, is\r\nsimply consultative; the government delegates the mayor, sub-prefect, or\r\nprefect, who prescribes what must be done. As the preliminary steps are\r\ntaken by him, and he has constant direction of the local council for two\r\nweeks, and finally the right of confirmation, he controls it, and\r\nthen for eleven months and a half, having sole charge of the daily and\r\nconsecutive execution of its acts, he reigns in the local community.\r\nUndoubtedly, having received and expended money for the community, he\r\nis accountable and will present his yearly accounts at the following\r\nsession; the law says[4136] that in the commune, \"the municipal council\r\nshall listen to and may discuss the account of municipal receipts and\r\nexpenses.\" But read the text through to the end, and note the part which\r\nthe law, in this case, assigns to the municipal council. It plays\r\nthe part of the chorus in the antique tragedy: it attends, listens,\r\napproves, or disapproves, in the background and subordinate, approved\r\nor rebuked, the principal actors remain in charge and do as they please;\r\nthey grant or dispute over its head, independently, just as it suits\r\nthem. In effect, it is not to the municipal council that the mayor\r\nrenders his accounts, but \"to the sub-prefect, who finally passes them,\"\r\nand gives him his discharge. Whatever the council may say, the approval\r\nis valid; for greater security, the prefect, if any councilor proves\r\nrefractory, \"may suspend from his functions\" a stubborn fellow like\r\nhim, and restore in the council the unanimity which has been partially\r\ndisturbed.--In the department, the council-general must likewise\r\n\"listen\" to the accounts for the year; the law, owing to a significant\r\nomission, does not say that is may discuss them. Nevertheless, a\r\ncircular of the year IX requests it to \"make every observation on the\r\nuse of the additional centimes\" which the importance of the subject\r\ndemands, to verify whether each sum debited to expenses has been used\r\nfor the purpose assigned to it, and even \"to reject expenses, stating\r\nthe reasons for this decision, which have not been sufficiently\r\njustified.\" And better still, the minister, who is a liberal, addresses\r\na systematic series of questions to the general councils, on all\r\nimportant matters,[4137] \"agriculture, commerce, and manufactures,\r\nasylums and public charities, public roads and other works, public\r\ninstruction, administration properly so called, state of the number of\r\npopulation, public spirit and opinions,\" collecting and printing their\r\nobservations and desires. After the year IX, however, this publication\r\nstops; it renders the general councils too important; it might rally the\r\nentire population of the department to them and even of all France that\r\ncould read; it might hamper the prefect and diminish his ascendancy.\r\nFrom now on, it is the prefect alone who replies to these questions, and\r\nof which the government gives an analysis or tables of statistics;[4138]\r\nthen, the publication of these ceases; decidedly, printing always has\r\nits drawbacks--manuscript reports are much better; local affairs are\r\nno longer transacted outside the bureaus, and are managed with closed\r\ndoors; any report that might spread outside the prefect's cabinet or\r\nthat of the minister, is carefully toned down or purposely stifled, and,\r\nunder the prefect's thumb, the general council becomes an automaton.\r\n\r\nIn private, dealing directly with the Emperor's representative, it\r\nappears as if one is dealing directly with the Emperor. Consider these\r\nfew words--in the presence of the Emperor; they carry an immeasurable\r\nweight in the scales of contemporaries. For them, he has every\r\nattribute of Divinity, not only omnipotence and omnipresence, but again\r\nomniscience, and, if he speaks to them, what they feel far surpasses\r\nwhat they imagine. When he visits a town and confers with the\r\nauthorities of the place on the interests of the commune or department,\r\nhis interlocutors are bewildered; they find him as well informed as\r\nthemselves, and more clear-sighted; it is he who explains their affairs\r\nto them. On arriving the evening before, he calls for the summaries of\r\nfacts and figures, every positive and technical detail of information,\r\nreduced and classified according to the method taught by himself and\r\nprescribed to his administrators.[4139] During the night he has read\r\nall this over and mastered it; in the morning, at dawn, he has taken\r\nhis ride on horseback; with extraordinary promptness and accuracy, his\r\ntopographical glance has discerned \"the best direction for the projected\r\ncanal, the best site for the construction of a factory, a harbor, or a\r\ndike.\"[4140] To the difficulties which confuse the best brains in the\r\ncountry, to much debated, seemingly insoluble, questions, he at once\r\npresents the sole practical solution; there it is, ready at hand, and\r\nthe members of the local council had not seen it; he makes them touch it\r\nwith their fingers. They stand confounded and agape before the universal\r\ncompetence of this wonder genius. \"He's more than a man\" exclaimed the\r\nadministrators of Dusseldorf to Beugnot.[4141] \"Yes,\" replied Beugnot,\r\n\"he's the devil!\" In effect, he adds to mental ascendancy the ascendancy\r\nof force; we always see beyond the great man in him the terror-striking\r\ndominator; admiration begins or ends in fear; the soul is completely\r\nsubjugated; enthusiasm and servility, under his eye, melt together into\r\none sentiment of impassioned obedience and unreserved submission.[4142]\r\nVoluntarily and involuntarily, through conviction, trembling, and\r\nfascinated, men abdicate their freedom of will to his advantage. The\r\nmagical impression remains in their minds after he has departed. Even\r\nabsent, even with those who have never seen him, he maintains his\r\nprestige and communicates it to all who command in his name. Before the\r\nprefect, the baron, the count, the councilor of state, the senator\r\nin embroidered uniform, gilded and garnished with decorations, every\r\nmunicipal or general council loses his free will and becomes incapable\r\nof saying no, only too glad if not obliged to say yes \"inopportunely,\"\r\nto enter upon odious and disagreeable undertakings, to simulate at\r\none's own expense, and that of others, excessive zeal and voluntary\r\nself-sacrifice, to vote for and hurrah at patriotic subscriptions of\r\nwhich it must contribute the greatest portion and for supplementary\r\nconscriptions[4143] which seize their sons that are except or bought out\r\nof service.[4144] It allows itself to be managed; it is simply one of\r\nthe many wheels of our immense machine, one which receives its\r\nimpulsion elsewhere, and from above, through the interposition of\r\nthe prefect.--But, except in rare cases, when the interference of\r\nthe government applies it to violent and oppressive schemes, it\r\nis serviceable; fixed in position, and confining itself to turning\r\nregularly and noiselessly in its little circle, it may, in general,\r\nstill render the double service demanded of it in the year IX, by a\r\npatriotic minister. According to the definition which Chaptal then gave\r\nthe general councils, fixing their powers and competence, they exist for\r\ntwo purposes and only two:[4145] they must first \"insure to the governed\r\nimpartiality in the assessment of taxes along with the verification\r\nof the use of the latest levies in the payment of local expenses,\" and\r\nnext, they must, with discretion and modesty, \"obtain for the government\r\nthe information which alone enables it to provide for the necessities\r\nof each department and improve the entire working of the public\r\nadministration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. Excellence of Local Government after Napoleon.\r\n\r\n     The institution remains intact under the Restoration.\r\n     --Motives of the governors.--Excellence of the machine.\r\n     --Abdication of the administrator.\r\n\r\nSuch is the spirit of the institution and such is its form. After\r\n1814 and 1815, after the fall of the Empire and the Restoration, the\r\ninstitution subsists and remains as it was before in form and in\r\nspirit: it is always the government which appoints and directs all the\r\nrepresentatives of local society, in the department, in the commune, and\r\nin the intermediate circumscriptions, the prefect, sub-prefects, mayors\r\nand assistants, the councilors of the department, of the arrondissement\r\nand of the commune. Whatever the ruling power may be it is repugnant to\r\nany change; never does it voluntarily restrict itself in its faculty of\r\nbestowing or withholding offices, authority, consideration, influence,\r\nor salaries, every desirable and every desired good thing; as far as it\r\ncan, it retains these in its own hands to distribute them as it pleases,\r\nand in its own interest to bestow them on its partisans and to deprive\r\nits adversaries of them, to attract clients and create minions. The\r\nfour thousand offices of prefect, sub-prefect, and councilors of the\r\nprefecture, department, and arrondissement, the four hundred thousand\r\noffices of mayor, assistants, and municipal councilors, and added to\r\nthese, the innumerable salaried employments of auxiliary or secondary\r\nagents, from the secretary-general of the prefecture down to the\r\nsecretary of the mayor, from the scribes and clerks of the prefecture\r\nand sub-prefecture down to the staff of the municipal police and of the\r\noctroi in the towns, from the city or department architect down to the\r\nlowest road-surveyor, from the watchmen and superintendents of a canal\r\nor harbor down to the field-guards and stone-breakers or the highway,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, the constitutional government disposes of\r\nthem in the same fashion as the imperial government, with the same\r\ninterference in the most trifling details and in the most trifling\r\naffair. Commune or department, such local society remains under the\r\nsecond Régime what it was under the first one, an extension of the\r\ncentral society, an appendix of the State, an adjunct of the great\r\nestablishment of which the seat is at Paris. In these adjuncts,\r\ncontrolled from above, nothing is changed, neither the extent and limits\r\nof the circumscription, nor the source and hierarchy of powers, nor\r\nthe theoretic framework, nor the practical mechanism, not even the\r\nnames.[4146] After the prefects of Empire come the prefects of the\r\nRestoration, the same in title and uniform, installed in the same\r\nmansion, to do the same work, with equal zeal, that is to say, with\r\ndangerous zeal, to such an extent that, on taking leave of their final\r\naudience, on setting out for their department, M. de Talleyrand,\r\nwho knows men and institutions profoundly, gives them, as his last\r\ninjunction, the following admirable order: \"And, especially, no zeal!\r\n\"--According to the recommendation of Fouché, \"the Bourbons slept in the\r\nbed of Napoleon,\" which was the bed of Louis XIV., but larger and more\r\ncomfortable, widened by the Revolution and the Empire, adapted to the\r\nfigure of its latest occupant, and enlarged by him so as to spread over\r\nthe whole of France. When, after twenty-five years of exile, one returns\r\nhome, it is pleasant to find such a bed in the house ready made, taking\r\ndown and remaking the old one would give double trouble; moreover, in\r\nthe old one, one was less at his ease; let us profit by all that rebels\r\nand the usurper have done that was good. In this particular, not\r\nalone the king, but again the most antiquated of the Bourbons\r\nare revolutionaries and Bonapartists; despotic traditionally, and\r\nmonopolists through their situation, they accept with no regrets the\r\nsystematic demolition effected by the Constituent Assembly, and the\r\nsystematic centralization instituted by the First Consul. The Duc\r\nd'Angoulême, when, in 1815, he was paraded about the country, among the\r\nbridges, canals, and splendid roads of Languedoc, on being reminded that\r\nthese fine works were formerly executed by the \"Ètats\" of the province,\r\ndryly replied \"We prefer the departments to the provinces.\"[4147]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of a few antiquarian and half-rustic royalists,\r\nnobody objects; there is no thought of reconstructing the machine on\r\nanother plan; in sum, nobody is dissatisfied with the way it works. It\r\nworks well, most effectively; under the Restoration as under the Empire,\r\nit renders to those who are interested the service demanded of it; it\r\ngoes on providing better and better for the two grand objects of local\r\nsociety, care for the public highways and protection against natural\r\ncalamities. In 1814, its net results are already admirable and do it\r\ncredit--reparation of the ruins accumulated by the Revolution,[4148]\r\nthe continuation and completion of former projects, new and striking\r\nenterprises, dikes against the sea and the rivers, basins, moles, and\r\njetties in the harbors, quays, and bridges, locks and canals, public\r\nedifices, 27,200 kilometers of national roads and 18,600 kilometers of\r\ndepartmental roads,[4149] without counting the district roads just\r\nlaid out; all this done regularly, exactly, and economically, Charles\r\nNicolas, \"Les Budgets de la France depuis le commencement du XIXe\r\nsiècle.\" In 1816, the four direct contributions returned, in principal,\r\n249 millions, and, in additional centimes, 89 millions only. For a long\r\ntime the additional centimes applied to the local service and voted by\r\nthe department or by the commune are not many and do not exceed 5 %. of\r\nthe principal. by competent functionaries, employed and superintended,\r\nwho at first through fear are compelled to be prudent, and then through\r\nhabit and honor have become honest accountants; there is no waste, no\r\nunderhand stealing, no arbitrary charges; no sum is turned aside between\r\nreceipts and expenses to disappear and be lost on the road, or flow out\r\nof its channel in another direction. The sensitive taxpayer, large or\r\nsmall, no longer smarts under the painful goad which formerly pricked\r\nhim and made him jump. Local taxation, annexed to the general tax,\r\nis found to be reformed, lightened, and duly proportioned. Like the\r\nprincipal, the \"additional centimes\" are an equitable charge, graduated\r\naccording to the sum of net revenue; like the principal, they are\r\nassessed according to the assumed sum of this net revenue by the\r\ncouncils of the arondissements among the communes, and by the communal\r\nassessors among the inhabitants. They are collected by the same\r\ncollector, with the same formalities, and every taxpayer who thinks\r\nhimself taxed too heavily finds a court of appeal in the council of the\r\nprefecture, before which he can make his claim and obtain the release\r\nor reduction of his quota.--Thus no crying iniquity exists, nor keen\r\nsuffering; on the other hand, there are the infinite conveniences and\r\ndaily enjoyment of possessions, the privation of which, to the modern\r\nman, is equal to the lack of fresh, pure air, physical security and\r\nprotection against contagion, facilities for circulation and transport,\r\npavements, light, the salubrity of healthy streets purged of their\r\nfilth, and the presence and vigilance of the municipal and rural police.\r\nAll these benefits, the objects of local society, are due to the machine\r\nwhich works with little cost, without breaking down or stopping for any\r\nlong time, as lately under the Republic, and without any extortion and\r\nclashing, as in the times of the ancient Régime. It works by itself,\r\nalmost without the help of the parties interested, and which, in\r\ntheir eyes, is not its least merit; with it, there is no bother, no\r\nresponsibility, no elections to attend to, no discussions to maintain,\r\nno resolutions to pass. There is only one bill to be settled, not even\r\na specified bill, but a surplus of centimes added to each franc, and\r\nincluded with the principal in the annual quota. Just like an owner who,\r\nby his correct, exact, and somewhat slow although punctual and capable\r\nsupervisors, are relieved of the care of his property. He may dismiss\r\nthe head steward of his domain in a fit of ill-humor, but, if he changes\r\nhis stewards, he does not change the system; he is too accustomed to it,\r\nand his indolence demands it; he is not tempted to take care and trouble\r\non himself, nor is he qualified to become his own intendant.\r\n\r\nAnd what is worse, in the present case the master has forgotten that\r\nhe is the owner of his domain, he hardly remembers that he is a\r\npersonality. Whether large or small, department or commune, local\r\nsociety has no longer the consciousness of being a natural body,\r\ncomposed of involuntarily united members with common interests; this\r\nsentiment, already weakened and drooping at the end of the ancient\r\nrégime, lost under the multiplied attacks of the Revolution and under\r\nthe prolonged compression of the Empire. During twenty-five years it\r\nhas suffered too much; it has been too arbitrarily manufactured or\r\nmutilated, too frequently recast, and made and unmade.--In the\r\ncommune, everything has been upset over and over again, the territorial\r\ncircumscription, the internal and external system, all collective\r\nproperty. To the 44,000 municipalities improvised by the Constituent\r\nAssembly, there succeeded under the Directory 6000 or 7000 cantonal\r\nmunicipalities, a sort of local syndicate, represented in each commune\r\nby a subaltern agent, and then, under the Consulate, 36,000 distinct and\r\npermanent communes. Sovereign at the start, through the improvidence\r\nand abdication of the Constituent Assembly, the communes become, in the\r\nhands of the Convention, so many timorous subjects surrendered to the\r\nbrutality of perambulating pashas and resident agas, imposed upon them\r\nby Jacobin tyranny; then under the Empire, a docile herd governed in a\r\ncorrect way from above, but possessing no authority of their own, and\r\ntherefore indifferent to their own affairs and utterly wanting in public\r\nspirit. Other more serious blows affect of the them still more deeply\r\nand acutely. Through a decree of the Legislative Assembly, in every\r\ncommune where a third of the inhabitants demand a partition of the\r\ncommunal property, the commune is stripped, and its time-honored\r\npatrimony is set off in equal lots, in portions according to families\r\nor per head, and converted into small private holdings. (Page\r\n319/584)Through a decree of the Convention, the whole of the communal\r\nfortune, its debts and assets, are swallowed up by the public fortune\r\nand engulfed along with that in the sale of real property, in the\r\ndiscredit of the assignats, and in the final bankruptcy. After this\r\nprolonged process, communal property, even when disgorged and restored\r\nby the exchequer, is not what it was before; once out of the monster's\r\nstomach, the remains of it, dismembered, spoilt, half-digested, are no\r\nlonger held sacred and inviolable; a settlement of accounts intervenes;\r\n\"there are a good many communes,\" says Napoleon[4150] \"whose debts have\r\nbeen paid and whose property was not sold; there are many others whose\r\nproperty has been sold and whose debts are not paid.... The result is\r\nthat many pieces of property in certain communes are not considered\r\nreputable.\" Consequently, he first deprives these of one-tenth of their\r\nincome from land, and then one-quarter of the produce of their extra\r\ncuttings of timber,[4151] and finally, their capital, the whole of their\r\nreal property,[4152] estimated at 370 millions; in exchange, he gives\r\nthem 138 millions in the rentes; the loss to them as well as the gain\r\nto him, is thus 232 millions, while the sale of communal properties at\r\nauction, begun in 1813, continues under the Restoration in 1814, 1815,\r\nand even in 1816. A human community treated in this way for one quarter\r\nof a century, ceases to be a personality, and becomes a mere material\r\nobject; as far as this is concerned, its members have come to believe,\r\nthat it is and must be so and cannot be otherwise.\r\n\r\nAbove the commune, nearly dead, is the department, completely dead; here\r\nlocal patriotism is stamped out at the beginning by the destruction\r\nof the provinces. Among so many political crimes and other outrages\r\ncommitted by the Revolution against France, this is one of the worst.\r\nThe Constituent Assembly has dismantled long-established associations,\r\nthe accumulated work of ten centuries, historic and powerful names,\r\neach of which aroused enthusiasm in thousands of breasts and cemented\r\ntogether thousands of wills, centers of spontaneous co-operation,\r\nfiresides warm with generous feeling, zeal, and devotion, a practical\r\nschool of high political education, an admirable theater for available\r\ntalent, noble careers open to legitimate ambition, in short, the small\r\npatrimony whose instinctive cult forms the first step out of egoism and\r\na march onward toward thoughtful devotion to the large patrimony.\r\nCut apart by geometrical shears, and designated by an entirely new\r\ngeographical term, small sections of the province became so many\r\nfactitious agglomerations of juxtaposed inhabitants, human assemblages\r\nwithout any soul; and, for twenty years, the legislator fails to\r\ncommunicate to them that semblance of spirit, the judicial quality of\r\nwhich it disposes; it is only after 1811 that the departments arrive at\r\ncivil proprietorship and personality: this dignity, besides, the State\r\nconfers only to disburden itself and to burden them, to impose expenses\r\non them which hardly concern them but which do concern it, to compel\r\nthem in its place to support the costly maintenance of its prisons,\r\npolice quarters, courts of justice, and prefectorial mansions; even at\r\nthis late date, they are not yet, in the eyes of jurisconsults or\r\nbefore the Council of State, incontestable proprietors and complete\r\npersonalities;[4153] they are not to be fully qualified in this sense\r\nuntil the law of 1838.\r\n\r\nLocal society, accordingly, proves abortive over the whole 27,000\r\nsquare leagues of territory; it is simply a legal figment, an artificial\r\ngrouping together of neighbors who do not find themselves bound and\r\nincorporated together by neighborhood; in order that their society might\r\nbecome viable and stimulating would require both commune and department\r\nto have in mind and at heart the following idea, which they no longer\r\nentertained:\r\n\r\n\"We are all aboard the same ship, it is ours and we are its crew. We are\r\nhere to manage it ourselves, with our own hands, each according to his\r\nrank and position, each taking his part, little or big, in doing his own\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4101: My understanding, today in 1999, that all people other\r\nanimals by nature are 'built' as egoists, that is to look out for\r\nthemselves, to preserve their life, protect their property and family.\r\nAs far as the social (or gregarious) instincts are concerned then there\r\nare several which manifest themselves in the correct and timely order\r\nduring our entire existence. Some will regulate falling in love, others\r\nprocreation, others relationship between man and woman, others between\r\nparents and children, at yet others the group and its choice and\r\nsubmission to a leader. One of the results is that everyone wants to be\r\nimportant and accepted, another that a mob has drives or instincts which\r\nmay galvanize it into compassion, anger, fear and action. To this must\r\nbe added that all people can remember, not only what they have tried,\r\nbut also what they have seen or heard about. They also tend to imagine\r\nthat others react in the same way as they themselves do. This allows\r\nthem to look ahead and imagine various possible scenarios. They are also\r\naware of how they would want to be dealt with by others.

In 1771, especially, he takes them\r\nback, and, it seems, to keep them forever; but he always reserves the\r\nright of alienating them for money. For example (Augustin Thierry,\r\n\"Documens sur l'histoire du tiers État,\" III., 319), an act of the royal\r\ncouncil, dated October 1, 1772, accepts 70,000 francs from the town of\r\nAmiens for the repurchase of the installment of its magistracies, and\r\ndefining these magistracies, as well as the mode of election according\r\nto which the future incumbents shall be appointed.

LOCAL SOCIETY SINCE 1830.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Introduction of Universal suffrage.\r\n\r\n     Local society since 1830.--Introduction of a new internal\r\n     motor.--Subordinate to the external motor.--Advantageous\r\n     under the system of universal suffrage.\r\n\r\nNeither lips nor heart are capable of pronouncing the above invigorating\r\nand conclusive phrase after a silence of 30 years. That local society\r\nought to be a private association, does not interest those who are\r\nconcerned, while the legislator does not permit it. Indeed, after the\r\nyear VIII (1799), the State (Napoleon) introduces into the machine the\r\nnew motivation described above. After the revolution of 1830,[4201] the\r\nmunicipal and general councilors become elective and are appointed by\r\na limited suffrage; after the revolution of 1848, they are elected\r\nby universal suffrage.[4202] After the revolution of 1870,[4203] each\r\nmunicipal council elects its own mayor, while the council-general,\r\nwhose powers are enlarged, leaves in its place, during its vacations, a\r\nstanding committee who arrange with, and govern along with, the prefect.\r\nHere, in local society, is a superadded internal motor, working from\r\nbelow, whilst the first one is external and works from above; from\r\nnow on, both are to work together and in accord.--But, in reality, the\r\nsecond (the council-general) remains subordinate; moreover, it does not\r\nsuit the machine[4204] and the machine does not suit it; it is only\r\na superfluity, an inconvenient and cumbersome intruder, nearly always\r\nuseless, and often mischievous. Its influence is feeble and of little\r\neffect; too many brakes are attached to it; its force diminishes through\r\nthe complexity of its numerous wheels; it fails in giving action; it\r\ncannot but little more than impede or moderate other impulses, those of\r\nthe external motor, sometimes as it should, and sometimes the contrary.\r\nMost frequently, even nowadays (1889), it is of no efficiency whatever.\r\nThree-quarters of the municipal councils, for three-fourths of their\r\nbusiness, hold sessions only to give signatures. Their pretended\r\ndeliberations are simply a parade formality; the incentive and direction\r\ncontinue to come from without, and from above; under the third Republic,\r\nas under the Restoration and the first Empire, it is always the central\r\nState which governs the local society; amid all the wrangling and\r\ndisputes, in spite of passing conflicts it is, and remains, the\r\ninitiator, mover, leader, controller, accountant, and executor of every\r\nundertaking, the preponderating power in the department as well as in\r\nthe commune, and with what deplorable results we all know.--There is\r\nstill another and more serious result. Nowadays, its interference is an\r\nadvantage, for should it renounce its preponderance this would pass over\r\nto the other power which, since this has become vested in a numerical\r\nmajority, is mere blind and brutal force; abandoned to itself and\r\nwithout any counter-weight, its ascendancy would be disastrous, we\r\nwould see reappearing along with the blunders of 1789, the outrages,\r\nusurpations, and distress of 1790, 1791 and 1792.[4205]--In any event,\r\nthere is this advantage in despotic centralization, that it still\r\npreserves us from democratic autonomy. In the present state of\r\ninstitutions and minds, the former system, objectionable as it may be,\r\nis our last retreat against the greater evil of the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Universal suffrage.\r\n\r\n     Application of universal suffrage to local society.--Two\r\n     assessments for the expenses of local society.--The fixed\r\n     amount of one should in equity be equal to the average sum\r\n     of the other.--Practically, the sum of one is kept too low.-\r\n     -How the new régime provides for local expenditure.--The\r\n     \"additional centimes.\"--How the small taxpayer is relieved\r\n     in town and country.--His quota in local expenditure reduced\r\n     to the minimum.--His quota of local benefits remains\r\n     intact.--Hence the large or average taxpayer bears, beside\r\n     his own burden, that of the relieved small taxpayer.--Number\r\n     of those relieved.--The extra burden of the large and\r\n     average taxpayer is alms-giving.--The relief of the small\r\n     taxpayer is a levy of alms.\r\n\r\nIn effect, direct universal suffrage, counted by heads, is in local\r\nsociety a discordant element, a monstrous system, to which it is\r\nadverse. Constituted as this is, not by human judgment, but by the\r\npreponderance of numbers and their force, its mechanism is determined\r\nbeforehand; it excludes certain wheels and connections.[4206] That\r\nis why the legislator must write laws which reflect the nature of our\r\nexistence, or, at least, translate this as closely as he can, without\r\nany gross contradiction. Nature herself presents him with ready-made\r\nstatutes.[4207] His business is to read these properly; he has already\r\ntranscribed the apportionment of burdens; he can now transcribe the\r\napportionment of rights.\r\n\r\nSo, we have seen, local society renders two distinct services[4208],\r\nwhich, that the expenses of both may be met, require two distinct\r\nassessments, one personal and the other real, one levied on everybody\r\nand of which the amount is alike for all, and the other levied only on\r\nthose whose amount is based on what he spends, on the importance of his\r\nbusiness, and on the income from his real estate.--In strict equity,\r\nthe amount of the former should be equal to the average amount of the\r\nlatter; in effect, as has been shown, the services defrayed by the\r\nformer are as many, as diverse, and as precious, still more vital, and\r\nnot less costly than those of which the latter is the price. Of the\r\ntwo interests which they represent, each, did it stand alone, would be\r\nobliged to secure the same services, to take upon itself the whole of\r\nthe work; neither would obtain more in the dividend, and each would have\r\nto pay the whole of the expense. Accordingly, each gains as much as the\r\nother in the physical solidarity which binds them together. Hence, in\r\nthe legal bond which unites them they enter into it on an equal footing,\r\non condition that each is burdened or relived as much as the other, on\r\ncondition that if the latter assumes one-half of the expense the former\r\nshall assume the other half, on condition that if the latter quota on\r\neach one hundred francs expended against calamities and for public roads\r\nis 50 francs, the former quota shall also be 50 francs.--Practically,\r\nhowever, this is impossible. Three times out of four the former levy\r\nwith this apportionment would not be returned; through prudence as\r\nwell as humanity, the legislator is bound not to overburden the poor.\r\nRecently, in organizing the general tax and the revenue of the State,\r\nhe has looked out for them; now, in organizing the local tax and the\r\nrevenue of the department or of the commune, he looks out for them to a\r\nstill greater extent.\r\n\r\nIn the new financial scheme, so many centimes, added to each franc of\r\ndirect tax, form the principal resource of the department and commune,\r\nand it is through this extra charge that each taxpayer pays his quota\r\nof local expenditure. Now, there is no surcharge on the personal tax,\r\nno additional centimes. Under this heading, the laborer without any\r\nproperty or income, the workman who lives in lodgings, on his wages, and\r\nfrom day to day, contributes nothing to the expenses of his commune or\r\ndepartment. In vain do \"additional centimes\" pour down on other branches\r\nof direct taxation; they are not grafted on this one, and do not suck\r\naway the substance of the poor.[4209]--There is the same regard for the\r\nhalf poor, in relation to the artisan who furnishes his own room, but\r\nwho lodges in an upper story, and in relation to the peasant whose hovel\r\nor cottage has but one door and one window.[4210] Their rate of taxation\r\non doors and windows is very low, purposely reduced, kept below one\r\nfranc a year, while the rate of their personal tax is scarcely higher.\r\n\"Additional centimes\" may be imposed on so small a principal and be\r\nmultiplied in vain, never will they reach more than an insignificant\r\namount.-Not only are the destitute relieved of both principal and\r\n\"additional centimes,\" the verified poor, those who are registered and\r\nare helped, or should be, that is to say 2,470,000 persons;[4211] but,\r\nagain, others, by hundreds of thousands, whom the municipal council\r\njudges incapable of paying.--Even when people possess but a small piece\r\nof land, they are also relieved of the land tax and of the numerous\r\nadditional centimes which increase it. Such is the case with those\r\nwho are infirm or burdened with a family. The exchequer, so as not to\r\nconvert them into beggars and vagabonds, avoids expropriation, selling\r\nout their concrete hovel, vegetable garden, and small field of potatoes\r\nor cabbages; it gives them receipts gratis, or, at least, refrains\r\nfrom prosecuting them.[4212] In this way the poor peasant, although\r\na land-owner, again exempts himself, or is exempted from his local\r\nindebtedness. In truth, he pays nothing, or nearly nothing, otherwise\r\nthan by prestations (payments) in money or in kind; that is to say, by\r\nthree days' work on the district roads, which, if he pays in kind, are\r\nnot worth more than 50 sous.[4213] Add to this his portion, very small\r\nand often null, of the additional centimes on the tax on doors and\r\nwindows, on the personal tax, and on the tax on real estate, in all 4\r\nor 5 francs a year. Such is the amount by which the poor or half-poor\r\ntaxpayer in the villages liberates himself toward his department and\r\ncommune.--In the towns, he apparently pays more, owing to the octroi.\r\nBut, at first, there are only 1525 communes out of 36,000 in which the\r\noctroi[4214] has been established; while in the beginning, under the\r\nDirectory and Consulate, it was revived only on his account, for his\r\nbenefit, in behalf of public charity, to defray the expenses of asylums\r\nand hospitals ruined by revolutionary confiscation. It was then \"an\r\noctroi for charity,\" in fact as well as in name, like the surplus tax on\r\ntheater seats and tickets, established at the same time and for the same\r\npurpose; it still to-day preserves the stamp of its first institution.\r\nBread, the indispensable provision for the poor, is not subjected to the\r\noctroi nor the materials for making it, either grain or flour, nor\r\nmilk, fruits, vegetables, or codfish, while there is only a light tax\r\non butcher's meat. Even on beverages, where the octroi is heavier, it\r\nremains, like all indirect taxes, nearly proportional and semi-optional.\r\nIn effect, it is simply an increase of the tax on beverages, so many\r\nadditional centimes per franc on the sum of indirect taxation, as\r\nwarrantable as the impost itself, as tolerable, and for the same\r\nmotives.[4215] For the greater the sobriety of the taxpayer, the less is\r\nhe affected by this tax. At Paris, where the increase is excessive,\r\nand adds to the 6 centimes paid to the state, on each quart of wine, 12\r\ncentimes paid to the city; if he drinks but one quart a day, he pays,\r\nunder this heading, into the city treasury 43 francs 80 centimes per\r\nannum: but, as compensation for this, he is free of personal tax of 11\r\n3/4%, which this adds to the amount of each rental of the 11 3/4%,\r\nwhereby this would have added to his rent, and therefore 47 francs per\r\nannum as a rent of 400 francs. Thus what he has paid with one hand\r\nhe gets back with the other. Now, at Paris, all rentals under 400\r\nfrancs[4216] are thus free of any personal tax; all rentals between 400\r\nand 1000 francs are more or less free, and, in the other octroi towns,\r\nan analogous discharge reimburses to the small taxpayers a portion more\r\nor less great of the sum they pay to the octroi.--Accordingly, in the\r\ntowns as in the country, they are favored at one time through fiscal\r\nrelief and at another through administrative favor, now through\r\ncompulsory deduction and now through total or partial reimbursement.\r\nAlways, and very wisely, the legislator apportions the burden according\r\nto the strength of the shoulders; he relieves them as much as he can, at\r\nfirst, of the general tax, and next, which is still better, of the local\r\ntax. Hence, in local expenditure, their quota diminishes out of all\r\nproportion and is reduced to the minimum. Nevertheless, their quota of\r\nlocal benefit remains full and entire; at this insignificant price\r\nthey enjoy the public highways and profit by all the precautions taken\r\nagainst physical ills; each profits by this personally, equally with any\r\nmillionaire. Each personally receives as much in the great dividend of\r\nsecurity, health, and convenience, in the fruit of the vast works of\r\nutility and enjoyment due to improved communications, which preserve\r\nhealth, assist traffic, and beautify the locality, and without which, in\r\ntown as well as in the country, life would be impossible or intolerable.\r\n\r\nBut these works which cost so much, these defensive operations and\r\napparatus against inundations, fires, epidemics, and contagions, these\r\n500,000 kilometers of district and department roads, these dikes, quays,\r\nbridges, public gardens, and promenades, this paving, drainage, sweeping\r\nand lighting, these aqueducts and supplies of drinkable water, all\r\nthis is paid for by somebody, and, since it is not done by the small\r\ntaxpayer, it is the large or average taxpayer who pays for it. The\r\nlatter then, bears, besides his obligatory weight, a gratuitous surplus\r\nburden, consisting of the weight of which the other is relieved.\r\n\r\nEvidently the greater the number of the relieved, the heavier will be\r\nthis overweight, and the relieved count by millions. Two millions and\r\na half of declared poor[4217] are relieved of any direct tax, and,\r\ntherefore, of all the centimes which have just increased the burden.\r\nOut of 8 millions of real-estate owners,[4218] 3 millions, considered\r\nas insolvent, pay neither the real estate tax nor the centimes which it\r\ncomprises. In the octroi towns, it is not the minority but the majority\r\nof the inhabitants who are relieved in the way just described; in\r\nParis,[4219] out of 685,000 rentals, 625,000, in other terms twelve out\r\nof thirteen lodgings, are exempt, wholly or in part, from the personal\r\ntax, the principal and \"additional centimes.\" On each franc of this\r\nprincipal there are 96 of these superadded centimes for the benefit of\r\nthe town and department and because the department and the town expend\r\na good deal, and because receipts are essential for the settlement of\r\nthese accounts, this or that sum is noted beforehand in every chapter of\r\nreceipts, and the main thing now is to have this paid in, and it must\r\nbe paid by somebody; it matters little whether the peasants are few or\r\nnumerous; if among thirteen taxable persons there is only one that pays,\r\nso much the worse for him, for he must pay for himself and the other\r\ntwelve. Such is the case in Paris, which accounts for the \"additional\r\ncentimes\" here being so numerous,[4220] owing to there being less than\r\n60,000 rentals for the acquittance of the entire tax, and, besides\r\npaying their own debt, they must discharge the indebtedness of 625,000\r\nother rentals, the tax on which is reduced or null.--Frequently, before\r\nthe Revolution, some rich convent or philanthropic seignior would pay\r\nthe taxes of his poor neighbors out of his own pocket; willingly or not,\r\n60,000 Parisians, more or less well lodged, now hand over the same sum,\r\nbestow the same charity, on 625,000 thousand badly or only tolerably\r\nlodged Parisians; among these 60,000 benefactors whom the exchequer\r\nobliges to be benevolent, 34,800 who pay from 1000 to 3000 francs rent,\r\nbestow, under this heading, a pretty large sum for charitable purposes,\r\nwhile 14,800, who pay more than 3000 francs rent, pay a very large one.\r\nOther branches of direct taxation, in the country as well as in\r\nthe city, present the same spectacle: it is always the rich or\r\nthe well-to-do taxpayers who, through their over-tax, more or less\r\ncompletely relieve the poor or straitened taxpayers; it is always the\r\nowners of large or small properties, those who pay heavy or average\r\nlicenses, the occupants of lodgings with more than five openings,[4221]\r\nand whose locative value surpasses 1000 francs, who in local expenditure\r\npay besides their own dues the dues of others and, through their\r\nadditional centimes, almost entirely defray the expenses of the\r\ndepartment and commune.--This is nearly always the case in a local\r\nsociety, except when it chances to possess an abundant income, arising\r\nfrom productive real estate, and is able to provide for its wants\r\nwithout taxing its members; apart from this rare exception, it is forced\r\nto tax some in order to relieve others. In other words, the same as with\r\nother enterprises, it manufactures and sells its product but, just the\r\nreverse of other enterprises, it sells the product, an equal quantity\r\nof the same product, that is to say, equal protection against the same\r\ncalamities, and the equal enjoyment of the same public highway, at\r\nunequal prices, very dear to a few, moderately dear to many, at cost\r\nprice to a large number, and with a discount to the mass; to this last\r\nclass of consumers the discount goes on increasing like the emptiness\r\nof their purse; to the last of all, extremely numerous, the goods are\r\ndelivered almost gratis, or even for nothing.\r\n\r\nBut to this inequality of prices may correspond the inequality of\r\nrights, and compensation will come, the balance may be restored,\r\ndistributive justice may be applied, if, in the government of the\r\nenterprise, the parts assigned are not equal, if each member sees his\r\nportion of influence growing or diminishing along with the weight of his\r\ncharge, if the regulations, graduating authority according to the scale\r\nof the levies, assigns few votes to those who pay the lowest quotas of\r\nexpense and receive alms, and many votes to those who give alms and pay\r\nthe largest quotas of the expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Equity in taxation.\r\n\r\n     Possible compensation in the other side of the scale.--What\r\n     the distribution of rights should be according to the\r\n     principle of distributive justice.--In every association of\r\n     stock-owners.--In local society confined to its natural\r\n     object.--In local society charged with supplementary\r\n     functions.--The local statue in England and Prussia.--The\r\n     exchange equitable when burdens are compensated by rights.\r\n\r\nSuch is the rule in every association of interests, even in stock\r\ncompanies in which the distribution of charges allows of no favor or\r\ndisfavor to any associate. It must be noted that, in these companies,\r\nco-operation is not compulsory, but voluntary; the associates are not,\r\nas in the local society, conscripts enlisted under the constraint of\r\nphysical solidarity, but subscribers bound together under the impulsion\r\nof a deliberate preference, each remaining in its of his own free will\r\njust as he entered it; if he wishes to leave it he has only to sell his\r\nstock; the fact of his keeping this confirms his subscription, and, thus\r\nholding on to it, he daily subscribes anew to the statute. Here, then,\r\nis a perfectly free association; its is accordingly perfectly equitable,\r\nand its statute serves as a model for others.\r\n\r\nNow this statute always makes a distinction between the small and the\r\nlarge stockholders; it always attributes a greater share of authority\r\nand influence to those who share most largely in the risks and expenses;\r\nin principle, the number of votes in confers on each associate is\r\nproportionate to the number of shares of which he is the owner or\r\nbearer.--All the stronger is the reason why this principle should be\r\nembodied in the statutes of a society which, like the local community,\r\ndiminishes the burden of the small taxpayer through its reductions,\r\nand increases by its extra taxation the burden of the large or average\r\ntaxpayer; when the appointment of managers is handed over to universal\r\nsuffrage, counted by heads, the large and average taxpayers are\r\ndefrauded of their dues and deprived of their rights, more so by far and\r\nmore deeply wronged than the bearer or owner of a thousand shares in an\r\nomnibus or gas company if, on voting at a meeting of stockholders, his\r\nvote did not count for more than that of the owner or bearer of a single\r\nshare.--\r\n\r\nHow is it then when a local society adds to its natural and unavoidable\r\npurpose an optional and supplementary purpose;\r\n\r\n* when, increasing its load, it undertakes to defray the cost of public\r\ncharity and of primary education;\r\n\r\n* when, to support this additional cost, it multiplies the additional\r\ncentimes;\r\n\r\n* when the large or average taxpayer pays alone, or nearly alone, for\r\nthis benevolent work by which he does not benefit;\r\n\r\n* when the small taxpayer pays nothing, or next to nothing, to this\r\nbenevolent work by which he does benefit;\r\n\r\n* when, in voting for the expense thus apportioned, each taxpayer,\r\nwhatever the amount of his contribution, has one vote and only one?\r\n\r\nIn this case, powers, benefits, reductions, and exemptions, all the\r\nadvantages are on one side, that of the poor and half-poor forming the\r\nmajority and who if not restrained from above, will persistently abuse\r\ntheir numerical force to augment their advantages, at the increasing\r\nexpense of the rich or well-do-do minority. In the future, in the local\r\nsociety, the average or large taxpayer is no longer an associate but a\r\nvictim; were he free to choose he would not enter into it; he would like\r\nto go away and establish himself elsewhere; but were he to enter\r\nothers, near or remote, his condition would be no better. He remains,\r\naccordingly, where he is, physically present, but absent in feeling;\r\nhe takes no part in deliberate meetings; his zeal has died out; he\r\nwithholds from public affairs that surplus of vigilant attention, that\r\nspontaneous and ready collaboration which he would have contributed\r\ngratis; he lets matters go along without him, just as it happens;\r\nhe remains there just what he is, a workable, taxable individual in\r\ncapricious hands, in short, a passive subject who gives and has become\r\nresigned.--For this reason, in countries where an encroaching democracy\r\nhas not yet abolished or perverted the notion of equity, the local\r\nstatute applies the fundamental rule of an equitable exchange; it lays\r\ndown the principle that\r\n\r\nhe who pays commands, and in proportion to the sum he pays.[4222]\r\n\r\nIn England, a surplus of votes is awarded to those most heavily taxed,\r\neven six votes to one voter; in Prussia, local taxation is divided into\r\nthirds, and, accordingly, the taxpayers into three groups, the first one\r\ncomposed of heavy taxpayers, few in number, and who pay the first third,\r\nthe second composed of average taxpayers, average in number, and who pay\r\nthe second third, and the third composed of the great number of small\r\ntaxpayers, who pay the last third.[4223] To each of these groups is\r\nassigned the same number of suffrages in the commune election, or the\r\nsame number of representatives in the commune representation. Through\r\nthis approximate balance of legal burdens and of legal rights, the\r\ntwo sides of the scales are nearly level, the level which distributive\r\njustice demands, and the level which the state, special interpreter,\r\nsole arbiter and universal minister of distributive justice, should\r\nestablish when, in the local community, it imposes, rectifies, or\r\nmaintains the articles in accordance with which it derives its income\r\nand governs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. On unlimited universal suffrage.\r\n\r\n     How unlimited universal suffrage found its way into local\r\n     society.--Object and mode of the French legislator.\r\n\r\nIf the government, in France, does just the opposite, it is at the\r\nheight of a violent and sudden revolution, forced by the party in power\r\nand by popular prejudice, through deductive reasoning, and through\r\ncontagion. According to revolutionary and French usage, the legislator\r\nwas bound to institute uniformity and to make things symmetrical;\r\nhaving placed universal suffrage in political society, he was likewise\r\ndetermined to place it in local society. He had been ordered to apply an\r\nabstract principle, that is to say, to legislate according to a summary,\r\nsuperficial, and verbal notion which, purposely curtailed and simplified\r\nto excess, did not correspond with its aim. He obeyed and did nothing\r\nmore; he made no effort outside of his instructions. He did not propose\r\nto himself to restore local society to its members, to revive it, to\r\nmake it a living body, capable of spontaneous, co-ordinate, voluntary\r\naction, and, to this end, provided with indispensable organs. He did\r\nnot even take the trouble to imagine, how it really is, I mean by\r\nthis, complex and diverse and inversely to legislators before 1789,\r\nand adversely to legislators before and after 1789 outside of France,\r\nagainst all the teachings of experience, against the evidence of nature,\r\nhe refused to recognize the fact that, in France, mankind are of two\r\nspecies, the people of the towns and the people of the country, and\r\nthat, therefore, there are two types of local society, the urban\r\ncommune and the rural commune. He was not disposed to take this capital\r\ndifference into consideration; he issued decrees for the Frenchman in\r\ngeneral, for the citizen in himself, for fictive men, so reduced that\r\nthe statute which suits them can nowhere suit the actual and complete\r\nman. At one stroke, the legislative shears cut out of the same stuff,\r\naccording to the same pattern, thirty-six thousand examples of the same\r\ncoat, one coat indifferently for every commune, whatever its shape,\r\na coat too small for the city and too large for the village,\r\ndisproportionate in both cases, and useless beforehand, because it\r\ncould not fit very large bodies, nor very small ones. Nevertheless, once\r\ndispatched from Paris, people had to put the coat on and wear it;\r\nit must answer for good or for ill, each donning his own for lack of\r\nanother better adjusted; hence the strangest attitudes for each, and, in\r\nthe long run, a combination of consequences which neither governors nor\r\nthe governed had foreseen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Rural or urban communes.\r\n\r\n     No distinction between the rural and the urban commune.\r\n     --Effects of the law on the rural commune.--Disproportion\r\n     between the intelligence of its elected representatives and\r\n     the work imposed upon them.--The mayor and the municipal\r\n     council.--Lack of qualified members.--The secretary of the\r\n     mayoralty.--The chief or under chief of the prefectorial\r\n     bureau.\r\n\r\nLet us consider these results in turn in the small and in the great\r\ncommunes; clear enough and distinct at the two extremities of the scale,\r\nthey blend into each other at intermediate degrees, because here\r\nthey combine together, but in different proportions, according as the\r\ncommune, higher or lower in the scale, comes nearer to the village or\r\nto the city.--On this territory, too, subdivided since 1789, and, so to\r\nsay, crumbled to pieces by the Constituent Assembly, the small communes\r\nare enormous in number; among the 36,000, more than 27,000 have less\r\nthan 1000 inhabitants, and of these, more than 16,000 have less than 500\r\ninhabitants.[4224] Whoever has traveled over France, or lived in this\r\ncountry, sees at once what sort of men compose such purely rural groups;\r\nhe has only to recall physiognomies and attitudes to know to what extent\r\nin these rude brains, rendered torpid by the routine of manual labor and\r\noppressed by the cares of daily life, how narrow and obstructed are\r\nthe inlets to the mind; how limited is their information in the way of\r\nfacts; how, in the way of ideas, the acquisition of them is slow; what\r\nhereditary distrust separates the illiterate mass from the lettered\r\nclass; what an almost insurmountable wall the difference of education,\r\nof habits, and of manners interposes in France between the blouse\r\nand the dress-coat; why, if each commune contains a few cultivated\r\nindividuals and a few notable proprietors, universal suffrage sets them\r\naside, or at least does not seek them out for the municipal council or\r\nthe mayoralty.--Before 1830, when the prefect appointed the municipal\r\ncouncilors and the mayor, these were always on hand; under the monarchy\r\nof July and a limited suffrage, they were still on hand, at least for\r\nthe most part; under the second Empire, whatever the elected municipal\r\ncouncil might be, the mayor, who was appointed by the prefect, and even\r\noutside of this council, might be one of the least ignorant and least\r\nstupid even in the commune. At the present day (1889), it is only\r\naccidentally and by chance that a noble or bourgeois, in a few provinces\r\nand in certain communes, may become mayor or municipal councilor; it is,\r\nhowever, essential that he should be born on the soil, long established\r\nthere, resident and popular. Everywhere else the numerical majority,\r\nbeing sovereign, tends to select its candidates from among the average\r\npeople: in the village, he is a man of average rural intelligence, and,\r\nmostly, in the village a municipal council which, as narrow-minded as\r\nits electors, elects a mayor equally as narrow-minded as itself\r\nSuch are, from now on, the representatives and directors of communal\r\ninterests; except when they themselves are affected by personal\r\ninterests to which they are sensitive, their inertia is only equaled by\r\ntheir incapacity[4225]\r\n\r\nFour times a year a bundle of elaborately drawn papers, prepared by\r\nthe prefecture, are submitted to these innately blind paralytics, large\r\nsheets divided into columns from top to bottom, with tabular headings\r\nfrom right to left, and covered with printed texts and figures in\r\nwriting--details of receipts and expenses, general centimes, special\r\ncentimes, obligatory centimes, optional centimes, ordinary centimes,\r\nextra centimes, with their sources and employment; preliminary\r\nbudget, final budget, corrected budget, along with legal references,\r\nregulations, and decisions bearing on each article. In short, a\r\nmethodical table as specific as possible and highly instructive to a\r\njurist or accountant, but perfect jargon to peasants, most of whom can\r\nscarcely write their name and who, on Sundays, are seen standing before\r\nthe advertisement board[4226] trying to spell out the Journal Officiel,\r\nwhose abstract phrases, beyond their reach, pass over their heads in\r\naerial and transient flight, like some confused rustling of vague and\r\nunknown forms. To guide them in political life, much more difficult than\r\nin private life, they require a similar guide to the one they take in\r\nthe difficult matters of their individual life, a legal or business\r\nadviser, one that is qualified and competent, able to understand the\r\nprefecture documents, sitting alongside of them to explain their budget,\r\nrights and limits of their rights, the financial resources, legal\r\nexpedients, and consequences of a law; one who can arrange their\r\ndebates, make up their accounts, watch daily files of bills, attend to\r\ntheir business at the county town, throughout the entire series of\r\nlegal formalities and attendance on the bureaus,--in short, some\r\ntrusty person, familiar with technicalities, who they might choose to\r\nselect.--Such a person was found in Savoy, before the annexation to\r\nFrance, a notary or lawyer who, practicing in the neighborhood or at the\r\nprincipal town, and with five or six communes for clients, visited them\r\nin turn, helped them with his knowledge and intelligence, attended their\r\nmeetings and, besides, served them as scribe, like the present secretary\r\nof the mayoralty, for about the same pay, amounting in all to about the\r\nsame total of fees or salaries.[4227]--At the present time, there is\r\nnobody in the municipal council to advise and give information to its\r\nmembers; the schoolmaster is their secretary, and he cannot be, and\r\nshould not be, other than a scribe. He reads in a monotonous tone of\r\nvoice the long financial enigma which French public book-keeping, too\r\nperfect, offers to their divination, and which nobody, save one who is\r\neducated to it, can clearly comprehend until after weeks of study. They\r\nlisten all agog. Some, adjusting their spectacles, try to pick out among\r\nso many articles the one they want, the amount of taxes they have\r\nto pay. The sum is too large, the assessments are excessive; it is\r\nimportant that the number of additional centimes should be reduced, and\r\ntherefore that less money should be expended. Hence, if there is any\r\nspecial item of expense which can be got rid of by a refusal, they set\r\nit aside by voting No, until some new law or decree from above obliges\r\nthem to say Yes. But, as things go, nearly all the expenses designated\r\non the paper are obligatory; willingly or not, these must be met, and\r\nthere is no way to pay them outside of the additional centimes; however\r\nnumerous these are, vote them they must and sanction the centimes\r\ninscribed. They accordingly affix their signatures, not with trust but\r\nwith mistrust, with resignation, and out of pure necessity. Abandoned\r\nto their natural ignorance, the twenty-seven thousand petty municipal\r\ncouncilors of the country are no more passive, more inert, more\r\nconstrained than ever; deprived of the light which, formerly, the choice\r\nof the prefect or a restricted suffrage could still throw into the\r\ndarkness around them, there remains to them only one safe tutor\r\nor conductor; and this final guide is the official of the bureaus,\r\nespecially this or that old, permanent chief, or under clerk, who is\r\nperfectly familiar with his files of papers. With about four hundred\r\nmunicipal councils to lead, one may imagine what he will do with them:\r\nnothing except to drive them like a flock of sheep into a pen of printed\r\nregulations, or urge them on mechanically, in lots, according to his\r\ninstructions, he himself being as automatic and as much in a rut as they\r\nare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. The larger Communes.\r\n\r\n     Effects of the law on the urban commune.--Disproportion\r\n     between the administrative capacity of its elected\r\n     representatives and the work imposed on them.--Lack of a\r\n     special and permanent manager.--The municipal council and\r\n     the mayor.--The general council and the intermediary\r\n     committee.--The prefect.--His dominant rule.--His obligatory\r\n     concessions.--His principal aim.--Bargains between the\r\n     central authority and the local Jacobins.--Effect on this on\r\n     local government, on the officials, and in local finances.\r\n\r\nLet us now look at the other side of the scale, on the side of the large\r\nurban communes, of which there are 223, with above 10,000 inhabitants,\r\n90 of these above 20,000 inhabitants, 9 of the latter above 100,000\r\ninhabitants, and Paris, which has 2,300,000.[4228] We see at the first\r\nglance cast upon an average specimen of these human anthills, a town\r\ncontaining from 40,000 to 50,000 souls, how vast and complex the\r\ncollective undertaking becomes, how many principal and accessory\r\nservices the communal society must co-ordinate and unite together in\r\norder to secure to its members the advantages of public roads and insure\r\ntheir protection against spreading calamities:\r\n\r\n* Maintenance and repairs of these roads, the straightening, laying-out,\r\npaving, and drainage, the constructions and expense for sewers, quays,\r\nand rivers, and often for a commercial harbor;\r\n\r\n* the negotiations and arrangements with departments and with the state\r\nfor this or that harbor, canal, dike, or insane asylum; the contracts\r\nwith cab, omnibus, and tramway companies and with telephone and\r\nhouse-lighting companies; the street-lighting, artesian wells and\r\naqueducts;\r\n\r\n* the city police, supervision and rules for using public highways,\r\nand orders and agents for preventing men from injuring each other when\r\ncollected together in large assemblies in the streets, in the markets,\r\nat the theater, in any public place, whether coffee-houses or taverns;\r\n\r\n* the firemen and machinery for conflagrations; the sanitary measures\r\nagainst contagion, and precautions, long beforehand to insure hygiene\r\nduring epidemics;\r\n\r\n* and, as extra burdens and abuses, the establishment, direction and\r\nsupport of primary schools, colleges, public lectures, libraries,\r\ntheaters, hospitals, and other institutions which should be supported\r\nand governed by different associations; at the very least, the\r\nappropriations to these establishments and therefore a more or less\r\nlegitimate and more or less imperative intervention in their internal\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nSuch are the great undertakings which form a whole, which bear alike on\r\nthe present, past, and future budget of the commune, and which, as so\r\nmany distinct branches of every considerable enterprise, require, for\r\nproper execution, to have their continuity and connection always present\r\nin the thoughtful and directing mind which has them in charge.[4229]\r\nExperience shows that, in the great industrial or financial companies,\r\nin the Bank of France, in the Crédit Lyonnais, and in the insurance,\r\nnavigation, and railroad companies, the best way to accomplish this end\r\nis a permanent manager or director, always present, engaged or accepted\r\nby the administrative board on understood conditions, a special, tried\r\nman who, sure of his place for a long period, and with a reputation to\r\nmaintain, gives his whole time, faculties, and zeal to the work,\r\nand who, alone, possessing at every moment a coherent and detailed\r\nconception of the entire undertaking, can alone give it the proper\r\nstimulus, and bring to bear the most economical and the most perfect\r\npractical improvements. Such is also the municipal administration in\r\nthe Prussian towns on the Rhine. Then, in Bonn, for instance,[4230] the\r\nmunicipal council, elected by the inhabitants \"goes in quest\" of some\r\neminent specialist whose ability is well known. It must be noted that\r\nhe is taken wherever he can be found, outside the city, in some remote\r\nprovince; they bargain with him, the same as with some famous musician,\r\nfor the management of a series of concerts. Under the title of\r\nburgomaster, with a salary of 10,000 francs per annum, he becomes for\r\ntwelve years the director of all municipal services, leader of the\r\ncivic orchestra, solely entrusted with executive power, wielding the\r\nmagisterial baton which the various instruments obey, many of these\r\nbeing salaried functionaries and others benevolent amateurs,[4231]\r\nall in harmony and through him, because they know that he is watchful,\r\ncompetent, and top quality, constantly occupied with am overall view,\r\nresponsible, and in his own interest, as a point of honor, wholly\r\ndevoted to his work which is likewise their work, that is to say, to the\r\ncomplete success of the concert.\r\n\r\nNothing in a French town corresponds to this admirable type of a\r\nmunicipal institution. Here, also, and to a much greater extent in the\r\nvillage, the effect of universal suffrage has been to discredit the true\r\nnotables and to incite the abdication or insure the exclusion of men\r\nwho, by their education, the large proportion of the taxes they pay,\r\nand still greater influence or production on labor and on business, are\r\nsocial authorities, and who should become legal authorities. In every\r\ncountry where conditions are unequal, the preponderance of a numerical\r\nmajority necessarily ends in the nearly general abstention or almost\r\ncertain defeat of the candidates most deserving of election. But here\r\nthe case is different; the elected, being towns-people (citadins) and\r\nnot rural, are not of the species as in the village. They read a daily\r\nnewspaper, and believe that they understand not only local matters but\r\nall subjects of national and general importance, that is to say, high\r\nlevel economy, philosophy and law; somewhat resembling the schoolmaster\r\nwho, being familiar with the rules of arithmetic, thinks that he can\r\nteach the differential calculus, and the theory of functions. At\r\nany rate, they talk loud and argue on every subject with confidence,\r\naccording to Jacobin traditions, being, indeed, so many budding\r\nJacobins. They are the heirs and successors of the old sectarians,\r\nissuing from the same stock and of the same stamp, a few in good faith,\r\nbut mainly narrow-minded, excited, and bewildered by the smoke of the\r\nglittering generalities they utter. Most of them are mere politicians,\r\ncharlatans, and intriguers, third-class lawyers and doctors, literary\r\nfailures, semi-educated stump-speakers, bar-room, club, or clique\r\norators, and vulgar climbers. Left behind in private careers, in which\r\none is closely watched and accepted for what he is worth, they launch\r\nout on a public career because, in this business, popular suffrage\r\nat once ignorant, indifferent, is a badly informed, prejudiced and\r\npassionate judge and prefers a moralist of easy conscience, instead of\r\ndemanding unsullied integrity and proven competency. Nothing more is\r\ndemanded from candidates but witty speech-making, assertiveness and\r\nshowing off in public, gross flattery, a display of enthusiasm and\r\npromises to place the power about to be conferred on them by the people\r\nin the hands of those who will serve its antipathies and prejudices.\r\nThus introduced into the municipal council, they constitute its majority\r\nand appoint a mayor who is their figurehead or creature, now the bold\r\nleader and again the docile instrument of their spite, their favors, and\r\ntheir headlong action, of their blunders and presumption, and of their\r\nmeddlesome disposition and encroachments.--In the department, the\r\ncouncil general, also elected by universal suffrage, also bears the\r\nmarks of its origin; its quality, without falling so low, still descends\r\nin a certain degree, and through changes which keep on increasing:\r\npoliticians install themselves there and make use of their place as\r\na stepping-stone to mount higher; it also, with larger powers and\r\nprolonged during its vacations by its committee, is tempted to regard\r\nitself as the legitimate sovereign of the extensive and scattered\r\ncommunity which it represents.--Thus recruited and composed, enlarged\r\nand deteriorated, the local authorities become difficult to manage, and\r\nfrom now on, to carry on the administration, the prefect must come to\r\nsome understanding with them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Local society in 1880.\r\n\r\n     Present state of local society.--Considered as an organism,\r\n     it is stillborn.--Considered as a mechanism, it gets out of\r\n     order.--Two successive and false conceptions of local\r\n     government.--In theory, one excludes the other.--\r\n     Practically, their union ends in the actual system.--Powers\r\n     of the prefect.--Restrictions on these through subsequent\r\n     changes.--Give and take.--Bargaining.--Supported by the\r\n     government and cost to the State.\r\n\r\nBefore 1870, when he appointed the mayors and when the council general\r\nheld its sessions only fifteen days in the year, the prefect was\r\nalmost omnipotent; still, at the present day, (1889), \"his powers are\r\nimmense,\"[4232] and his power remains preponderant. He has the right\r\nto suspend the municipal council and the mayor, and to propose their\r\ndismissal to the head of the state. Without resorting to this extremity,\r\nhe holds them with a strong hand, and always uplifted over the commune,\r\nfor he can veto the acts of the municipal police and of the road\r\ncommittee, annul the regulations of the mayor, and, through a skillful\r\nuse of his prerogative, impose his own. He holds in hand, removes,\r\nappoints or helps appoint, not alone the clerks in his office, but\r\nlikewise every kind and degree of clerk who, outside his office, serves\r\nthe commune or department,[4233] from the archivist, keeper of\r\nthe museum, architect, director, and teachers of the municipal\r\ndrawing-schools, from the directors and collectors of charity\r\nestablishments, directors and accountants of almshouses, doctors of the\r\nmineral springs, doctors and accountants of the insane asylums and for\r\nepidemics, head-overseers of octrois, wolf-bounty guards, commissioners\r\nof the urban police, inspectors of weights and measures, town\r\ncollectors, whose receipts do not exceed thirty thousand francs, down\r\nto and comprising the lowest employees, such as forest guards of the\r\ndepartment and commune, lock-keepers and navigation guards, overseers\r\nof the quays and of commercial ports, toll-gatherers on bridges and\r\nhighways, field-guards of the smallest village, policemen posted on\r\nthe corner of a street, and stone-breakers on the public highway. When\r\nthings and not persons are concerned, it is he, again, who, in every\r\nproject, enterprise, or proceeding, is charged with the preliminary\r\nexamination and final execution of it, who proposes the department\r\nbudget and presents it, regularly drawn up, to the council general, who\r\ndraws up the communal budget and presents that to the municipal council,\r\nand who, after the council general or municipal council have voted on\r\nit, remains on the spot the sole executor, director, and master of the\r\noperation to which they have assented. Their total, effective part in\r\nthis operation is very insignificant, it being reduced to a bare act of\r\nthe will; in reaching a vote they have had in their hands scarcely any\r\nother documents than those furnished and arranged by him; in gradually\r\nreaching their decision step by step, they have had no help but his,\r\nthat of an independent collaborator who, governed by his own views\r\nand interests, never becomes the mere instrument. They lack for their\r\ndecision direct, personal, and full information, and, beyond this,\r\ncomplete, efficient power; it is simply a dry Yes, interposed between\r\ninsufficient resources, or else cut off, and the fruit of which is\r\nabortive or only half ripens. The persistent will of the prefect alone,\r\ninformed, and who acts, must and does generally prevail against this\r\nill-supported and ill-furnished will. At bottom, and as he stands, he\r\nis, in his mental and official capacity, always the prefect of the year\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, after the laws lately passed, his hands are not so free.\r\nThe competency of local assemblies is extended and comprises not only\r\nnew cases but, again, of a new species, while the number of their\r\nexecutive decisions has increased five-fold. The municipal council,\r\ninstead of holding one session a year, holds four, and of longer\r\nduration. The council general, instead of one session a year, holds two,\r\nand maintains itself in the interim by its delegation which meets every\r\nmonth. With these increased authorities and generally present, the\r\nprefect has to reckon, and what is still more serious, he must reckon\r\nwith local opinion; he can no longer rule with closed doors; the\r\nproceedings of the municipal council, the smallest one, are duly posted;\r\nin the towns, they are published and commented on by the newspapers\r\nof the locality; the general council furnishes reports of its\r\ndeliberations.--Thus, behind elected powers, and weighing with these on\r\nthe same side of the scales, here is a new power, opinion, as this grows\r\nin a country leveled by equalized centralization, in heaving or stagnant\r\ncrowd of disintegrated individuals lacking any spontaneous, central,\r\nrallying point, and who, failing natural leaders, simply push and\r\njostle each other or stand still, each according to personal, blind, and\r\nhaphazard impressions--a hasty, improvident, inconsistent, superficial\r\nopinion, caught on the wing, based on vague rumors, on four or\r\nfive minutes of attention given each week, and chiefly to big words\r\nimperfectly understood, two or three sonorous, commonplace phrases, of\r\nwhich the listeners fail to catch the sense, but the sound which, by din\r\nof frequent repetition, becomes for them a recognized signal, the blast\r\nof a horn or a shrieking whistle which assembles the herd and arrests or\r\ndrives it on. No opposition can make head against this herd as it\r\nrushes along in too compact and too heavy masses.--The prefect, on the\r\ncontrary, is obliged to cajole it, yield to it, and satisfy it; for\r\nunder the system of universal suffrage, this same herd, besides\r\nlocal representatives, elects the central powers, the deputies, the\r\ngovernment; and when the government sends a prefect from Paris into the\r\nprovinces, it is after the fashion of a large commercial establishment,\r\nwith a view to keep and increase the number of its customers, to stay\r\nthere, maintain its credit, and act permanently as its traveling-clerk,\r\nor, in other terms, as its electoral agent, and, still more precisely,\r\nas the campaign manager of coming elections for the dominant party and\r\nfor the ministers in office who have commissioned and appointed him,\r\nand who, from top to bottom, constantly stimulate him to hold on to\r\nthe voters already secured and to gain fresh ones.--Undoubtedly, the\r\ninterests of the state, department, and commune must be seriously\r\nconsidered, but, first and above all, he is the recruiting officer\r\nfor voters. By virtue of this position and on this he treats with\r\nthe council general and the standing committee, with the municipal\r\ncouncilors and mayors, with influential electors, but especially\r\nwith the small active committee which, in each commune, supports the\r\nprevailing policy and offers its zeal to the government.\r\n\r\nGive and take. These indispensable auxiliaries must obtain nearly all\r\nthey ask for, and they ask a great deal. Instinctively, as well as by\r\ndoctrine and tradition, the Jacobins are exacting, disposed to regard\r\nthemselves as the representatives of the real and the ideal people, that\r\nis to say, as sovereigns by right, above the law, entitled to make it\r\nand therefore to unmake it, or, at least, strain it and interpret it as\r\nthey please. Always in the general council, in the municipal council,\r\nand in the mayoralty, they are tempted to usurp it; the prefect has as\r\nmuch as he can do to keep them within the local bounds, to keep them\r\nfrom meddling with state matters and the general policy; he is often\r\nobliged to accept their lack of consideration, to be patient with them,\r\nto talk to them mildly; for they talk and want the administration to\r\nreckon with them as a clerk with his master; if they vote money for any\r\nservice it is on condition that they take part in the use of the funds\r\nand in the details of the service, in the choice of contractors and in\r\nhiring the workmen; on condition that their authority be extended and\r\ntheir hands applied to the consecutive execution of what does not\r\nbelong to them but which belongs to the prefect.[4234] Bargaining,\r\nconsequently, goes on between them incessantly and they come to\r\nterms.--The prefect, it must be noted, who is bound to pay, can do so\r\nwithout violating the letter of the law. The stern page on which the\r\nlegislator has printed his imperative text is always provided with an\r\nample margin where the administrator, charged with its execution, can\r\nwrite down the decisions that he is free to make. In relation to each\r\ndepartmental or communal affair, the prefect can with his own hand write\r\nout what suits him on the white margin, which, as we have already seen,\r\nis ample enough; but the margin at his disposition is wider still and\r\ncontinues, beyond anything we have seen, on other pages; he is chargé\r\nd'affaires not only of the department and commune, but again of the\r\nState. Titular conductor or overseer of all general services, he is, in\r\nhis circumscription, head inquisitor of the republican faith[4235],\r\neven in relation to private life and inner sentiments, the responsible\r\ndirector of orthodox or heretical acts or opinions, which are laudable\r\nor blamable in the innumerably army of functionaries by which the\r\ncentral state now undertakes the complete mastery of human life, the\r\ntwenty distinct regiments of its vast hierarchy--with the staff of the\r\nclergy, of the magistracy, of the preventive and repressive police, of\r\nthe customs; with the officials of bridges and highways, forest domains,\r\nstock-breeding establishments, postal and telegraph departments, tobacco\r\nand other monopolies; with those of every national enterprise which\r\nought to be private, Sévres and Gobelins, deaf and dumb and blind\r\nasylums, and every auxiliary and special workshop for war and navigation\r\npurposes, which the state supports and manages. I pass some of them and\r\nall too many. Only remark this, that the indulgence or severity of\r\nthe prefecture in the way of fiscal violations or irregularities is\r\nan advantage or danger of the highest importance to 377,000 dealers in\r\nwines and liquors; that an accusation brought before and admitted in\r\nthe prefecture may deprive 38,000 clergymen of their bread,[4236] 43,000\r\nletter-carriers and telegraph messengers, 45,000 sellers of tobacco and\r\ncollecting-clerks, 75,000 stone-breakers, and 120,000 male and female\r\nteachers;[4237] directly or indirectly, the good or ill favor of the\r\nprefecture is of consequence, since recent military laws, to all adults\r\nbetween 20 and 45 years, and, since recent school laws, to all children\r\nbetween 6 and 13 years of age. According to these figures, which go on\r\nincreasing from year to, calculate the breadth of the margin on which,\r\nalongside of the legal text which states the law for persons and things\r\nin general, the prefect in his turn gives the law for persons and things\r\nin particular. On this margin, which belongs to him, he writes what he\r\npleases, at one time permissions and favors, exemptions, dispensations,\r\nleaves of absence, relief of taxes or discharges, help and subventions,\r\npreferences and gratuities, appointments and promotions, and at another\r\ntime disgrace, hardship, legal proceedings, dismissals, and special\r\nfavors. To guide his hand in each case, that is to say, to spread all\r\nthe favors on one side and all the disfavors on the other, he has, among\r\nthe local Jacobins, special informers and important applicants. If not\r\nrestrained by a very strong sentiment of distributive justice and very\r\ngreat solicitude for the public good he can hardly resist them, and in\r\ngeneral when he takes up his pen it is to write under the dictation of\r\nhis Jacobin collaborators.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMOCRACY IN FRANCE IN 1889, SUMMARY.\r\n\r\nThus has the institution of the year VIII deviated (The France of the\r\nrevolution corrected and decreed by Napoleon), no longer attaining its\r\nobject. The prefects, formerly appointed to a department, like a\r\npacier of the Middle Ages, imposed on it from above, ignorant of local\r\npassions, independent, qualified and fitted for the office, was, during\r\nfifty years, in general, able to remain the impartial minister of the\r\nlaw and of equity, maintaining the rights of each, and exacting from\r\neach his due, without heeding opinions and without respect to persons.\r\nNow he is obliged to become an accomplice of the ruling faction, govern\r\nfor the advantage of some to the detriment of others, and to put into\r\nhis scales, as a preponderating weight, every time he weighs judgment,\r\na consideration for persons and opinions. At the same time, the entire\r\nadministrative staff in his hands, and under his eye, deteriorates; each\r\nyear, on the recommendation of a senator or deputy, he adds to it,\r\nor sees, intruders there, whose previous services are null, feeble in\r\ncapacity and of weak integrity who do poor work or none at all, and who,\r\nto hold their post or get promoted, count not on their merits but on\r\ntheir sponsors. The rest, able and faithful functionaries of the old\r\nschool, who are poor and to whom no path is open, become weary and lose\r\ntheir energy; they are no longer even certain of keeping their place; if\r\nthey stay, it is for the dispatch of current business and because they\r\ncannot be dispensed with; perhaps to-morrow, however, they will cease to\r\nbe considered indispensable; some political denunciation, or to give a\r\npolitical favorite a place, will put them by anticipation on the retired\r\nlist. From now on they have two powers to consult, one, legitimate and\r\nnatural, the authority of their administrative chiefs, and the other\r\nillegitimate and parasite, consisting of democratic influence from both\r\nabove and below. For them, as for the prefect, public welfare descends\r\nto the second rank and the electoral interest mounts upward to the\r\nfirst rank. With them as with him self-respect, professional honor,\r\nthe conscientious performance of duty, reciprocal loyalty go down;\r\ndiscipline relaxes, punctuality falters, and, as the saying goes, the\r\ngreat administrative edifice is no longer a well-kept house, but a\r\nbarracks.\r\n\r\nNaturally, under the democratic regime, the maintenance and service\r\nof this house becomes more and more costly;[4238] for, owing to the\r\nadditional centimes, it is the rich and well-to-do minority which\r\ndefrays the larger portion of the expense. Owing to universal suffrage,\r\nthe poor or half-poor majority which dominate the elections so that the\r\nlarge majority with impunity can overtax the minority. At Paris, the\r\nparliament and the government, elected by this numerical majority,\r\ncontrive demands in its behalf, force expenditure, augment public works,\r\nschools, endowments, gratuities, prizes, a multiplication of offices to\r\nincrease the number of their clients, while it never tires in decreeing,\r\nin the name of principles, works for show, theatrical, ruinous, and\r\ndangerous, the cost of which they do not care to know, and of which\r\nthe social import escapes them. Democracy, above as well as below, is\r\nshort-sighted; it seizes whatever food it comes across, like an animal,\r\nwith open jaws and head down; it refuses to anticipate and to calculate;\r\nit burdens the future and wastes every fortune it undertakes to manage,\r\nnot alone that of the central state, but, again, those of all local\r\nsocieties. Up to the advent of universal suffrage, the administrators\r\nappointed above or elected below, in the department or in the commune,\r\nkept tight hold of the purse-strings; since 1848, especially since\r\n1870, and still later, since the passage of the laws of 1882, which, in\r\nsuppressing the obligatory consent of the heaviest taxed, let slip\r\nthe last of these strings, this purse, wide open, is emptied in the\r\nstreet.--In 1851,[4239] the departments, all together, expended 97\r\nmillions; in 1869, 192 millions; in 1881, 314 millions. In 1836, the\r\ncommunes, all together, save Paris, expended 117 millions, in 1862, 450\r\nmillions, in 1877, 676 millions. If we examine the receipts covering\r\nthis expenditure, we find that the additional centimes which supplied\r\nthe local budgets, in 1820, with 80 millions, and, in 1850, with 131\r\nmillions, supplied them, in 1870, with 249 millions, in 1880, with\r\n318 millions, and, in 1887, with 364 millions. The annual increase,\r\ntherefore, of these superadded centimes to the principal of the direct\r\ntaxes is enormous, and finally ends in an overflow. In 1874,[4240] there\r\nwere already 24 departments in which the sum of additional centimes\r\nreached or surpassed the sum of the principal. \"In a very few years,\"\r\nsays an eminent economist,[4241] \"it is probable that, for nearly all\r\nof the departments,\" the overcharge will be similar. Already, for a long\r\ntime, in the total of personal taxation,[4242] the local budgets\r\nraised more than the state, and, in 1888, the principal of the tax real\r\nproperty, 183 millions, is less than the total of centimes joined with\r\nit, 196 millions. Coming generations are burdened over and beyond the\r\npresent generation, while the sum of loans constantly increases, like\r\nthat of taxation. The indebted communes, except Paris, owed, altogether,\r\nin 1868, 524 millions francs[4243], in 1871, 711 millions, and in 1878,\r\n1322 millions francs.[4244] Paris, in 1868, already owed 1326 millions,\r\nMarch 30, 1878, it owed 1988 millions. In this same Paris, the annual\r\ncontribution of each inhabitant for local expenses was, at the end\r\nof the first Empire, in 1813, 37 francs per head, at the end of the\r\nRestoration,[4245] francs, after the July monarchy, in 1848, 43 francs,\r\nand, at the end of the second Empire, in 1869, 94 francs. In 1887,45 it\r\nis 110 francs per head. [4246]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. Final result in a tendency to bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, is the history of local society from 1789 down to 1889.\r\nAfter the philosophic demolition of the Revolution and the practical\r\nconstructions of the Consulate, it could no longer be a small patrimony,\r\nsomething to take pride in, an object of affection and devotion to its\r\ninhabitants. The departments and communes have become more or less vast\r\nlodging-houses, all built on the same plan and managed according to the\r\nsame regulations one as passable as the other, with apartments in them\r\nwhich, more or less good, are more or less dear, but at rates which,\r\nhigher or lower, are fixed at a uniform tariff over the entire\r\nterritory, so that the 36,000 communal buildings and the 86 department\r\nhotels are about equal, it making but little difference whether one\r\nlodges in the latter rather than in the former. The permanent taxpayers\r\nof both sexes who have made these premises their home, have not obtained\r\nrecognition for what they are, invincibly and by nature, a syndicate of\r\nneighbors, an involuntary, obligatory and private association, in which\r\nphysical solidarity engenders moral solidarity, a natural, limited\r\nsociety whose members own the building in common, and each possesses a\r\nproperty right more or less great, according to the greater or lesser\r\ncontribution he makes to the expenses of the establishment. Up to this\r\ntime no room has yet been found, either in the law or in minds, for this\r\nvery plain truth; its place is taken and occupied in advance by the\r\ntwo errors which, in turn or both at once, have led the legislator and\r\nopinion astray.\r\n\r\nTaking things as a whole, it is admitted up to 1830 that the legitimate\r\nproprietor of the local building is the central state, that it may\r\ninstall its delegate therein, the prefect, with full powers; that,\r\nfor better government, he consents to be instructed by the leading\r\ninterested and most capable parties on the spot; that he should fix the\r\npetty rights he concedes to them within the narrowest limits; that he\r\nshould appoint them; that, if he calls them together for consultation,\r\nit is from time to time and generally for form's sake, to add the\r\nauthority of their assent to the authority of his omnipotence, on the\r\nimplied condition that he shall not give heed to their objections if he\r\ndoes not like them, and not follow their advice if he does not choose to\r\naccept it.--Taking things as a whole, it is admitted that, since\r\n1848, the legitimate proprietors of the building are its adult male\r\ninhabitants, counted by heads, all equal and all with an equal part in\r\nthe common property, comprising those who contribute nothing or nearly\r\nnothing to the common expenditure of the house, the numerous body of\r\nsemi-poor who lodge in it at half price, and the not less numerous body\r\nto whom administrative charity furnishes house comforts, shelter,\r\nlight, and frequently provisions, gratuitously.--Between both these\r\ncontradictory and false conceptions, between the prefect of the year\r\nVIII, and the democracy of 1792, a compromise has been effected;\r\nundoubtedly, the prefect, sent from Paris, is and remains the titular\r\ndirector, the active and responsible manager of the departmental or\r\ncommunal building; but, in his management of it he is bound to keep\r\nin view the coming elections, and in such a way as will maintain\r\nthe parliamentary majority in the seats they occupy in parliament;\r\nconsequently, he must conciliate the local leaders of universal\r\nsuffrage, rule with their help, put up with the intrusion of their bias\r\nand cupidity, take their advice daily, follow it often, even in\r\nsmall matters, even in payments day by day of sums already voted, in\r\nappointing an office-clerk, in the appointment of an unpaid underling,\r\nwho may some day or other take this clerk's place.[4247]--Hence the\r\nspectacle before our eyes: a badly kept establishment in which profusion\r\nand waste render each other worse and worse, where sinecures multiply\r\nand where corruption enters in; a staff of officials becoming more\r\nand more numerous and less and less serviceable, harassed between two\r\ndifferent authorities, obliged to possess or to simulate political\r\nzeal and to neutralize an impartial law by partiality, and, besides\r\nperforming their regular duties, to do dirty work; in this staff, there\r\nare two sorts of employees, the new-comers who are greedy and who,\r\nthrough favor, get the best places, and the old ones who are patient and\r\npretend no more, but who suffer and grow disheartened; in the building\r\nitself, there is great demolition and reconstruction, architectural\r\nfronts in monumental style for parade and to excite attention, entirely\r\nnew decorative and extremely tiresome structures at extravagant cost;\r\nconsequently, loans and debts, heavier bills at the end of each year\r\nfor each occupant, low rents, but still high, for favorites in the\r\nsmall rooms and garrets, and extravagant rents for the larger and more\r\nsumptuous apartments; in sum, forced receipts which do not offset the\r\nexpenses; liabilities which exceed assets; a budget which shows only\r\na stable balance on paper,--in short, an establishment with which the\r\npublic is not content, and which is on the road to bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4201: Laws of March 21, 1831, and July 18, 1837, June 22,\r\n1833, and May 10, 1838.

Among the latter, 468,641 have a locative value\r\ninferior to 300 francs a year; 74,360 are between 500 and 750 francs;\r\n21,147 are between 750 and 1000 francs. All these lodgings are more or\r\nless exempt from the personal tax: those between 1000 and 400 francs\r\npay it with a more or less great reduction: those under 400 francs pay\r\nnothing. Above 1000 francs, we find 17,202 apartments from between 1000\r\nand 1250 francs; 6198 from between 1250 and 1500 francs; 21,453 from\r\n1500 to 3000 francs.
