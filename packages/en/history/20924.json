The Norman bays which they replaced were\r\ninjured by the fall of the central Tower in 1322. The six eastern bays\r\n(the Presbytery) are in the Early English Style, and were built by\r\nBishop Northwold (1235-1252).\r\n\r\nHaving entered the South aisle of the Choir by the iron gate marked 1\r\non the plan, and passed, on the right, the monuments of Bishop Allen,\r\nand the Stewards, we come to 2. Bishop de Luda's monument (1298)\r\nrestored on the north side by Dean Peacock. 3. Bishop Barnet's tomb\r\n(1373). 4. Tomb of John Tiptoft, Earl of Worcester, and his two wives\r\n(1470). 5. Tomb of Bishop Hotham (1337) who left money for the\r\nrebuilding of the three Decorated bays of the Choir. 6. On the south\r\nside of the aisle is the monument erected in 1879 to Canon Selwyn. 7.\r\nBishop West's Chapel, built about 1534, containing the graves of\r\nBishops West, Keene, and Sparke, and on the south side the remains of\r\nseven benefactors of the monastery removed from the Conventual Church\r\nin 1154; and built in the north wall is the tomb of Cardinal de\r\nLuxemburg, Bishop of Ely, who died 1443. 8. In the Retro-Choir is the\r\ntomb of Dr. Mill, Canon of Ely, and Regius Professor of Hebrew at\r\nCambridge, who died in 1853. 9. Grave of Bishop and Mrs. Allen (1845).\r\n10. The east wall on which are traces of painting of which no account\r\ncan be given. 11. Bishop Alcock's Chapel, containing his grave; he\r\ndied in 1500; he was founder of Jesus College, Cambridge. 12. Tomb of\r\nBishop Northwold, founder of the Presbytery, who was Abbot of Bury\r\nbefore he became Bishop of Ely; died in 1254. 13.

His constant aim has been to render it a\r\nfaithful as well as a convenient and useful companion to strangers and\r\nothers when examining this interesting Cathedral; and, in order to\r\nrender each succeeding edition more complete, his study has been to\r\ngive from time to time the best information in his power upon the\r\nimprovements which have for many years been in progress. He tenders\r\nhis best thanks for the kindness of many friends who have afforded him\r\ninformation, and has availed himself of the important remarks of the\r\nlate Sir G.G. Scott at the Etheldreda Festival in 1873, and of the\r\nvaluable work of Mr. Stewart to correct as well as to verify and\r\nsupport his own statements, for which his grateful acknowledgments are\r\ndue. The whole has been revised, and some additions have been made,\r\nwhich he is induced to hope will enhance its value, and render it more\r\nworthy of public favor.\r\n\r\n_April, 1880._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+Advertisement+\r\n\r\nTO THE FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Hand-book is intended simply as a \"guide\" for those who visit Ely\r\nfor the purpose of seeing the Cathedral, the remains of the ancient\r\nMonastery, and other objects of similar interest.\r\n\r\nThe Compiler acknowledges himself greatly indebted for much valuable\r\ninformation to the elaborate works of Mr. Bentham and Mr. Millers;\r\nand, although he is conscious that his task has been performed but\r\nimperfectly, he still ventures to hope that, in the absence of the\r\nlarger works above referred to, his little compilation will prove both\r\ninteresting and useful.\r\n\r\n_May, 1852._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntroduction                                        Page 1\r\n\r\nHistorical Summary                                      14\r\n\r\nThe See of Ely                                          17\r\n\r\nList of Abbots, Bishops, &c.                            19\r\n\r\nOfficers of the Diocese                                 22\r\n\r\nDean and Chapter                                        23\r\n\r\nList of Priors and Deans                                24\r\n\r\nList of Clergy and Officers                             26\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral--West Front                               27\r\n\r\n               Galilee or Portico                       30\r\n\r\n               Interior of the Tower                    31\r\n\r\n               South-west Transept, Baptistry, &c.      34\r\n\r\n               Nave                                     35\r\n\r\n               Nave Aisles                              40\r\n\r\n               Transept                                 45\r\n\r\n               Octagon                                  49\r\n\r\n               Choir                                    58\r\n\r\n               North Aisle of Choir                     77\r\n\r\n               Retro-Choir                              80\r\n\r\n               South Aisle of Choir                     81\r\n\r\n               Lady Chapel, or Trinity Church           88\r\n\r\n               Upper parts of the Church                91\r\n\r\n               Exterior                                 91\r\n\r\n               Dimensions of the Cathedral              99\r\n\r\nThe Monastic Buildings, &c.                            101\r\n\r\n               Prior Crauden's Chapel                  105\r\n\r\nThe Bishop's Palace                                    110\r\n\r\nSt. Mary's Church                                      112\r\n\r\nThe Grange                                             115\r\n\r\nSt. John's Hospital                                    115\r\n\r\nAppendix I.

In the present instance our object is\r\nto give our readers an outline--a very brief one it is true--of the\r\nhistory and foundation of the monastery at Ely twelve centuries ago,\r\nwhich led to the subsequent erection of one of the noblest Cathedrals\r\nin the kingdom, in order to enable them to understand more fully some\r\nof the remarks in our description of this grand edifice as we now see\r\nit. To those who desire a more elaborate detail or fuller description\r\nthan we can offer in our limited space, we would recommend a reference\r\nto _The History and Antiquities of Ely Cathedral_, by the Rev. James\r\nBentham; or a more recent work, _The Architectural History of Ely\r\nCathedral_, by the Rev. D.J. Stewart, M.A., formerly Minor Canon of\r\nEly.\r\n\r\nChristianity was first introduced into East Anglia about the end of\r\nthe sixth century, by Redwald, the grandson of Uffa, founder of that\r\nkingdom; but it appears that little progress was made in his time,\r\nalthough Ethelbert, king of Kent, is said to have founded a monastery\r\nat Ely about A.D. 604. Eorpwald, and after him, Sigebert, sons of\r\nRedwald, greatly promoted the cause of Christianity, and it was during\r\nthe reign of Sigebert that the truths of the Gospel spread over the\r\nkingdom; three monasteries were founded, one at Bury St. Edmunds,\r\nanother at Burgh Castle, near Yarmouth, and a third at Soham; and the\r\nfirst Bishop of East Anglia was consecrated. The pagan king of Mercia\r\nfrequently disturbed the tranquility of the kingdom, and Sigebert and\r\nhis cousin Egric (to whom Sigebert had resigned his kingdom) were both\r\nslain in repelling an invasion. Anna met with the same fate; he was a\r\nprince greatly esteemed for his good qualities; he married Heriswitha,\r\nsister of St. Hilda, the foundress of Whitby Abbey, and had a numerous\r\nfamily, among whom may be named Sexburga, who was married to\r\nErcombert, king of Kent; Withburga, who founded a nunnery at Dereham;\r\nand AEthelryth, or, as she is more commonly called, Etheldreda, the\r\nrenowned foundress of the monastery at Ely, who was born about the\r\nyear 630, at Exning, in Suffolk, a short distance from Newmarket.\r\n\r\nBefore commencing our sketch of the life of Etheldreda, we may by way\r\nof explanation say that what is now the Isle of Ely, was \"anciently\r\ncalled _Suth Girwa_,\"[1] and is a large tract of high ground\r\nen-compassed with fens that were formerly overflowed with water, of\r\nwhich Ely is the principal place, and gives name to the whole. The\r\nboundaries as now recognised are Lincolnshire on the north, Norfolk on\r\nthe east, Huntingdonshire and Northamptonshire on the west, and\r\nCambridgeshire on the south, of which county it forms the northern\r\nportion, with a jurisdiction partially separate; within its bounds\r\nthere are, besides the city of Ely, several towns and villages, as\r\nWisbech, March, Chatteris, &c. and the former great waste of marsh\r\nand fen has become, by means of drainage, a fertile corn-growing\r\ndistrict of great importance. Ely is believed to have taken its name\r\nfrom _Elig_ in the Saxon tongue, signifying a willow; or from _Elge_\r\nin the Latin of Bede the historian, from the abundance of eels\r\nproduced in the surrounding waters. We now continue our sketch.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Bentham's History, i. 47.]\r\n\r\nEtheldreda, or Audrey, a princess of distinguished piety, devoted\r\nherself to the service of God in early life, but urged by her parents,\r\nwas married to Tonbert, or Tonberet, Earldorman, or Prince of the\r\nSouth Gyrvii, or Fenmen, A.D. 652, who settled upon her the whole Isle\r\nof Ely as a dower. Three years after her marriage Tonbert died, and\r\nleft Etheldreda in sole possession, who, after a short time, committed\r\nthe care of her property to Ovin, her steward, and retired to Ely for\r\nthe purpose of religious meditation, for which it was well adapted, as\r\nbeing surrounded by fens and waters it was difficult of access. She\r\nwas again solicited to enter the marriage state, and, although for\r\nsome time reluctant, she was induced by her uncle Ethelwold, then king\r\nof East Anglia, to give her hand to Egfrid, son of Oswy, king of\r\nNorthumberland, and she afterwards became queen by the accession of\r\nher husband to his father's kingdom. After the lapse of twelve years\r\nshe gained the permission of her husband to withdraw from his court,\r\nand retired to the Abbey of Coldingham, where she took the veil;\r\nthence withdrew to Ely, and repaired the old church founded by\r\nEthelbert, at a place called Cratendune, about a mile from the present\r\ncity, (of which place however nothing is now known); but, shortly\r\nafter, a more commodious site was chosen nearer the river, where the\r\nfoundations of her church were laid, and the monastery was commenced.\r\n\r\nThe history of this distinguished princess as related by various\r\nwriters, would be interesting and amusing, if space allowed; it is to\r\nbe found in _Bede's Ecclesiastical History_, in the _Liber Eliensis_,\r\na very valuable manuscript written or compiled by Thomas, a monk of\r\nEly, who lived in the twelfth century; and Mr. Bentham also relates it\r\nat some length in his work;[2] but it would extend far beyond the\r\nlimits allowed in this sketch; we have, however, we hope given\r\nsufficient to throw some light upon remarks we may make in subsequent\r\npages. She governed her house in such a manner as to gain the esteem\r\nboth of its members and the inhabitants of the surrounding country;\r\nliving and dying an example of piety and holiness, for we read that\r\n\"in her last sickness, when sensible of her approaching end, she was\r\ncalm and composed, and retained her memory and understanding to the\r\nlast, and expired in the very act of her calling, in the presence of\r\nher flock; and whilst she was instructing them how to live, by her\r\nexample also taught them how to die.\"[3] She was interred, in\r\naccordance with her own wish, in the grave-yard of the monastery, but\r\nafter a period of sixteen years her remains were translated, with much\r\nreverence and ceremony, to the church she had founded. The account of\r\nthis translation might interest some of our readers, but is too long\r\nfor insertion here.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Bentham's History, i. 45, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Ibid. i. 59.]\r\n\r\nThe following lines, written at an early date, picture the fen country\r\nas a series of lakes and water-courses, (as it was until drained six\r\ncenturies after,) studded with islands, on one of which the monastery\r\nof Ely stood, and the music of its '_nones_' or '_vespers_' sounding\r\nsoft and sweet over the solitude.\r\n\r\n     Sweetly sang the Monks at Ely,\r\n       Knuet, the king, row'd nigh:\r\n     \"Listen how the winds be bringing\r\n     From yon church a holy singing!\r\n       Row, men, nearer by.\"\r\n\r\n     Newborn sunbeams kiss the turrets\r\n       Of the minster high,\r\n     All the beauties of the morning,--\r\n     Grey at first, then golden dreaming,--\r\n       Deck the vernal sky.\r\n\r\n     Loudly sang the Monks of Ely\r\n       On that Thursday morn:\r\n     'Twas the Feast of \"God Ascended\"--\r\n     Of the wond'rous drama ended;--\r\n       God for sinners born!\r\n\r\n     Hark! \"_I will not leave you orphans,\r\n       I will not leave you long_,\"\r\n     Grand the minster music sounded\r\n     And the fen-land air resounded\r\n       With the holy song!\r\n\r\n     Sweetly sang the Monks at Ely\r\n       Knuet, the king, row'd nigh:\r\n     \"Listen to the angels bringing\r\n     Holy _thoughts_ that seem like singing!\r\n       Row yet nearer by.\"\r\n\r\nWe will now continue our narrative, briefly taking in review the\r\nhistory of the monastery as it is handed down to us. About A.D. 673\r\nEtheldreda commenced the foundation of a monastery for both sexes, and\r\nwas installed the first abbess; she gave the whole Isle of Ely to the\r\nmonastery as an endowment, and died A.D. 679. She was succeeded by her\r\nelder sister Sexburga, then a widow, who died A.D. 699, and was buried\r\nbeside her sister in the church of the monastery. Erminilda, daughter\r\nof Sexburga, and widow of Wulfure, king of Mercia, next succeeded; and\r\nthe fourth abbess was Werburga, daughter of Erminilda, the time of\r\nwhose death is not known. Although St. Etheldreda's monastery\r\ncontinued to enjoy a regular succession of abbesses for nearly two\r\ncenturies, not a single name of its superiors is preserved; protected\r\nby its situation in the midst of waters, it was little molested by\r\nexternal troubles until A.D. 870, when it was destroyed--like that of\r\nPeterborough--by the Danes, the monastery burnt, and the inhabitants\r\nput to the sword.\r\n\r\nAfter the destruction of the monastery a century elapsed before steps\r\nwere taken for its restoration. At length Ethelwold, then Bishop of\r\nWinchester, who is spoken of as \"a great builder of churches and of\r\nvarious other works,\" re-founded the monastery in the year 970, by the\r\ndirection of Edgar \"the peaceful,\" who then sat on the throne of\r\nEngland. After some time Ethelwold arranged with the king for the\r\nsurrender of the whole district of the Isle of Ely, by way of purchase\r\nand exchange, for the use of the monastery. The king, for certain\r\nconsiderations, gave his royal charter[4] restoring the revenues,\r\nrights, and privileges to the monastery for ever. This charter (which\r\nwas afterwards confirmed by king Edward the Confessor,) formed the\r\nbase of that temporal power given to the church and monastery of Ely\r\nby St. Etheldreda, and exercised (with some interruption) by the\r\nabbots and bishops down to the year 1836, when it was discontinued by\r\nan Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: This Charter is given at length in the Saxon language,\r\nwith an English translation, in the Appendix to Bentham's History.]\r\n\r\nOn the re-foundation of the monastery it was placed under the\r\nBenedictine rule, which required the separation of the sexes, whereas\r\nunder the previous order both men and women had resided in the same\r\nestablishment. Brithnoth, prior of Winchester, was instituted as the\r\nfirst abbot of the restored monastery, by Ethelwold, and appears to\r\nhave been zealous in his duty; he governed the house eleven years, but\r\nin the year 981 he met an untimely death at the instigation of\r\nElfrida, queen dowager of king Edgar. He was succeeded by Elsin,\r\nLeofric, Leofsin, Wilfric, Thurstan, (the last Saxon abbot, who\r\nsurrendered the monastery to the Conqueror in 1071,) Theodwin,\r\nGodfrey, (a monk, as Administrator _ad interim_,) and Simeon, the\r\nninth abbot, who was a relative of king William, and prior of\r\nWinchester; he recovered for his monastery some of the lands which had\r\nbeen given to the Normans during the siege of the fen district. This\r\nwas the \"Camp of Refuge\" for all the English who refused submission to\r\nthe arbitrary rule of the foreigners, and thus it was the last strong\r\nhold of the Saxons, and cost the Norman king much loss of time, blood,\r\nand treasure, before he obtained possession, which was, however, at\r\nlast effected by the treachery of the abbot Thurstan. Simeon, though a\r\nvery old man when he was appointed abbot, laid the foundation of a new\r\nchurch (the present Cathedral) A.D. 1083, as his brother Walkelin,\r\nbishop of Winchester, had done there about four years before; he lived\r\nto the age of one hundred years, and died in 1093; after this a\r\nvacancy of seven years occurred, during which the revenues were\r\nclaimed for the use of the king (William II.) after whose death the\r\nwork was continued by Richard, the tenth and last abbot, who was\r\nappointed on the accession of Henry I. A.D. 1100, and governed the\r\nmonastery seven years, and his church is said by Thomas of Ely[5] to\r\nhave been one of the noblest in the kingdom, and a marvel of\r\narchitectural skill; and was sufficiently far advanced to allow him to\r\ntranslate into it on the 17th of October, 1106, the remains of\r\nEtheldreda and her companions and canonized successors, placing them\r\nbehind the high altar in the new presbytery, with great pomp and\r\nceremony. Further progress was made under Herve le Breton, formerly\r\nBishop of Bangor, who was appointed administrator to the monastery\r\nafter the death of Richard.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Liber Eliensis, ii.]\r\n\r\nHitherto, spiritual jurisdiction over the Isle of Ely had been claimed\r\nby the Bishop of Lincoln, but Abbot Richard obtained the consent of\r\nthe king (Henry I.) to a scheme for converting the abbacy into a\r\nbishopric; and after much negociation, the change was effected in\r\n1109, by the appointment of Herve (then administrator) as the first\r\nBishop of Ely. He set himself energetically to the task of settling\r\nthe government of his See, and of apportioning the lands and revenues\r\nof the monastery between the monks and himself, with a keen eye to his\r\nown interests and those of his successors.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the conversion of the abbacy into a bishopric, when the\r\nConventual Church became a Cathedral, the number of monks was about\r\nfifty, though the usual number was seventy; of these the chief in\r\nsubordination to the Bishop, was the Prior, (sometimes styled the Lord\r\nPrior) who had the superintendence over all the inferior members; and\r\nnext, the Sub-Prior, or Prior's deputy, to assist him when present and\r\nact for him in his absence. The other officers were, the Sacrist, who\r\nhad the care of the books, vestments, plate, and ornaments belonging\r\nto the church, as well as the superintendence of the buildings; the\r\nCellarer, who procured all the necessaries for the living of the\r\ncommunity; the Chamberlain, who provided their clothes, beds, and\r\nbedding; the Almoner, who distributed the charities of the monastery;\r\nthe Precentor, who regulated the singing and the choristers; the\r\nHosteller, who entertained strangers; the Infirmarer, who had the\r\ncharge of the sick; and the Treasurer, who received the rents and\r\nother means of revenue, and made the disbursements.\r\n\r\nWe have endeavoured briefly to bring down our history from the period\r\nof the introduction of Christianity into East Anglia, and the\r\nfoundation of the monastery, to the time when the present Cathedral\r\nwas commenced and some way advanced; we will follow it up with a brief\r\naccount of the periods of erection of this noble edifice, reserving\r\nthe more particular description of the several parts for our survey of\r\nthe building.\r\n\r\nThere is no Cathedral in England which possesses finer examples of the\r\nvarious successive styles of ecclesiastical architecture than that of\r\nEly; affording excellent opportunities of judging of the comparative\r\nmerits of each. The Norman portion of the building--the Nave and\r\nTransept--is lighter in character than earlier examples of the same\r\nstyle; indeed, in many places it bears marks of transition from the\r\nround to the pointed style. Of each of the several periods of what is\r\nusually termed Pointed, or Gothic, Ely Cathedral possesses pure and\r\nperfect specimens: the Galilee, or western porch, and the Presbytery\r\nwere built when the Early English style was perfected: the Octagon,\r\nthe three bays of the stalled Choir, and the Lady Chapel, when the\r\nDecorated English prevailed: and the chapels of bishops Alcock and\r\nWest when the Perpendicular style was adopted. \"It will be thus seen\r\nthat this remarkable structure completely illustrates the history of\r\nchurch architecture in England from the Conquest to the Reformation,\"\r\nviz., Norman, A.D. 1066-1150; Transitional, 1150-1200; Early English,\r\n1200-1300; Decorated, 1300-1460; Florid, or Perpendicular,\r\n1460-1550.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The periods were thus divided by the late Mr. Sharpe:\r\nNorman, A.D. 1066-1145; Transitional, 1145-1190; Lancet, 1190-1245;\r\nGeometrical, 1245-1315; Curvilinear, 1315-1360; Rectilinear,\r\n1360-1550.]\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral was commenced, as before stated, in A.D. 1083, by\r\nSimeon, in the Norman style; the Choir, with its apse or semicircular\r\nend--altered however to a square end before it had proceeded far--the\r\ncentral Tower, the great Transept, and part of the Nave were begun by\r\nhim, but were not finished at his death in 1093; of this work, only\r\nthe ground-story of the great Transept now remains; the original plan,\r\nas was usual in Norman churches, comprehended an eastern arm of\r\nmoderate length, a Transept, with a central Tower at the crossing, and\r\na Nave; the Choir usually occupying the crossing and one or more bays\r\nof the Nave, the eastern arm being used as a presbytery or sanctuary.\r\n\r\nAfter a delay of seven years, the work was carried on by Abbot Richard\r\n(1100-1107), who probably completed them, with the exception of the\r\nNave, which was finished about 1174, affording a fine specimen of\r\nlater Norman, and by its extension westward gave the church the form\r\nof a Latin cross, then much used. It is not improbable that the\r\nConventual Church, which the new building was intended to supersede,\r\nstood on the site of the present Nave, and was removed from time to\r\ntime to make room for the new and enlarged building then in progress.\r\n\r\nA few years later the great western Tower with the wings, forming a\r\nsecond Transept, were begun, but whether by Bishop Harvey or by the\r\nmonks themselves during the episcopate of Bishop Nigel (1133-1169), we\r\ncannot say; they were carried on during the episcopate of Bishop Ridel\r\n(1174-1189), and completed as high as the first battlements during\r\nthat of his successor, Longchamp (1189-1197), producing a fine example\r\nof what is called the Transitional style. During this latter period\r\nthe Romanesque had been rapidly giving way to the Pointed style, and\r\nthus as the building progressed one style merged into the other.\r\n\r\nAfter some years further progress was made towards the west, as the\r\nGalilee, or western porch, is stated to have been erected by Bishop\r\nEustace (1198-1215), of whom it is recorded that \"he built from the\r\nfoundation the new Galilee of the Church at Ely, towards the west, at\r\nhis own cost.\" \"This has given rise to much difference of opinion.\r\nSome persons think that by the 'Galilee towards the west,' is meant\r\nthe western porch, while others holding that so fine a work is\r\ninconsistent with so early a date, suppose the Galilee to have been\r\nthe northern half (now lost) of the western Transept.... My own\r\nimpression has always been that it was the west porch which still\r\nexists.\"[7] Be this as it may, it is a beautiful specimen of the Early\r\nEnglish style; and Bishop Northwold (1229-1254) took down the east end\r\nof the church and lengthened it by the six eastern arches, usually\r\ncalled the Presbytery, with its magnificent eastern facade, in the\r\nsame style; they were begun A.D. 1234, and finished and dedicated in\r\n1252, being \"one of the noblest pieces of architecture of that\r\nglorious architectural period.\" About the same time a spire of timber\r\ncovered with lead was erected on the Tower.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Lecture on Ely Cathedral by the late Sir G.G. Scott, at\r\nthe Etheldreda Festival, Oct. 1873.]\r\n\r\nWe now come to the period in which the \"two great and famous\r\nproductions of the fourteenth century--the two special objects of\r\npride which our Cathedral boasts--the Lady Chapel and the central\r\nOctagon, with the three adjoining bays eastward,\"[8] were erected;\r\n\"each work is of the highest and of undisputed merit, and forms a most\r\nmarked feature in the building;\"[9] affording most admirable specimens\r\nof the Decorated English style. In 1321 the foundation stone of the\r\nvast and magnificent Lady Chapel was laid by Alan de Walsingham, then\r\nsub-prior, in the time of Bishop Hotham (1316-1337), the work was\r\ncontinued under Bishop Montacute (1337-1345), and finished in 1349,\r\nunder Bishop L'Isle (1345-1362). In the year following the\r\ncommencement of this work the fall of the great central Tower took\r\nplace, ruining the adjoining bays all round, and especially those of\r\nthe Norman Presbytery. This catastrophe was not altogether unexpected,\r\nfor the monks had discontinued the use of the Choir and held their\r\nservices in St. Catherine's Chapel, in the western part of the\r\nCathedral. The Tower fell with such noise and violence as \"to make the\r\nwhole city to tremble, and to cause men to think that an earthquake\r\nhad taken place.\" The work of rebuilding was soon undertaken, and\r\nunder the skilful directions of the same Alan de Walsingham (who was\r\ndoubtless the architect of both these erections,) the grand work was\r\naccomplished; the stone-work of the Octagon was finished (if indeed it\r\never was quite finished) in 1328, and the woodwork and roof about\r\n1342. The plan of the Octagon included in its area one bay on each of\r\nits four sides. The expense of rebuilding the three bays on the\r\neastern side was defrayed by a sum of money left by Bishop Hotham.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Ibid.]\r\n\r\nThe spire erected on the western Tower by Bishop Northwold was taken\r\ndown in the latter part of the fourteenth century, and was replaced by\r\nan octagonal story, flanked with turrets, in the Decorated style,\r\nabove which a spire was again placed. This was an injudicious step,\r\nand has been thought to have been the primary cause of the ruin of the\r\nnorth-western Transept, the great additional weight being more than\r\nthe four supporting arches (which were lofty) were intended to bear.\r\nOf the period when the Transept fell, or was taken down, we have no\r\nrecord; but the character of the buttress on the site of the western\r\nwall shows that it must have been at an early period, probably about\r\nA.D. 1400, as the strengthening arches placed within the original ones\r\nappear to have been erected a few years after.\r\n\r\nWe have no further additions to the fabric to particularise in this\r\nsketch, with the exception of the chapel of Bishop Alcock,\r\n(1486-1500), in the Perpendicular style; and that of Bishop West\r\n(1515-1533), in the same style, but when it was approaching to\r\nRenaissance; but the alterations of windows and other parts, together\r\nwith necessary repairs, have been numerous and various at different\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nThe Choir was under the Octagon until 1770, when it was removed to the\r\neast end of the church; it was again altered in 1852 to its present\r\nposition. Many costly and extensive restorations[10] and alterations\r\nhave been made within the last thirty-five years, and others are still\r\nin progress. The Galilee, or western porch, has been cleansed and\r\nfloored, and the arch of communication with the Tower beautifully\r\nrestored; the western Tower has been strengthened, the interior thrown\r\nmore open, a painted ceiling put up, and a new floor laid; the\r\nsouth-west Transept has been opened, repaired, ceiled, paved and\r\ncleansed; the apsidal Chapel of St. Catherine has been rebuilt and\r\npaved; the roof of the Nave has been re-covered with lead, the\r\ninterior walls have been cleansed, a new and beautiful painted ceiling\r\ncompleted, and a new floor laid in the Nave and aisles; the Octagon\r\nand Lantern have undergone a thorough repair, and the decoration of\r\nthe dome and lantern has been effected; the great Transept has been\r\nrepaired, the polychrome roof re-painted, and a new floor laid in the\r\nnorthern portion. The whole of the eastern portion of the church has\r\nbeen cleansed and restored; the beautiful Purbeck marble pillars have\r\nbeen re-polished; the floor of the Choir has been re-laid with veined\r\nand black marble combined with encaustic tiles; an enriched oaken\r\nscreen has been erected at the entrance of the Choir, near which a new\r\nand elegant stone pulpit has been placed; the original stalls have\r\nbeen repaired, and improved by the introduction of a series of carved\r\npanels, and new sub-stalls erected; and a new and elaborate reredos or\r\naltar screen has been placed in the Choir. More than eighty windows,\r\nexclusive of the eight lights at the east end of the church, have been\r\nfilled with stained glass by various artists, and several others,\r\nwhich had for many years been stopped up, have been re-opened; the\r\norgan has been very considerably enlarged and improved, put into a new\r\nand elegant case, and placed in another position; and several stoves\r\nhave been introduced for warming the Cathedral when necessary. The\r\nwhole has been done at considerable expense, to meet which the funds\r\nhave been raised by subscriptions, towards which the late Bishops\r\nSparke, Allen, Turton, and Browne, the late Deans Peacock and Goodwin,\r\nthe Canons and their families and connections, with many noblemen,\r\ngentlemen, and others, have been contributors: the capitular body have\r\ndone much towards the work in general, but particularly towards the\r\nrepairs of the fabric, the enlargement of the organ, and the warming\r\nof the Cathedral. For a more detailed account of works and expenses we\r\nrefer our readers to Appendix II. at the end of the work.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The Restorations, which have been for some years in\r\nprogress, have been executed throughout with the most scrupulous care,\r\npreserving every portion of uninjured surface, and re-producing what\r\nis mutilated or destroyed as nearly as possible in exact conformity\r\nwith the indications of the ancient work afforded by the parts which\r\nremain, and in the same material. They were at first carried out under\r\nthe directions of the late Dean Peacock, assisted from time to time by\r\nProfessor Willis, and by the occasional advice of Professional\r\nfriends: but towards the end of the year 1847, Sir G.G. Scott was\r\nappointed architect to the works, and under his direction the\r\nrearrangement of the Choir was effected, and other restorations in\r\nprogress carried out until his death. The windows have been filled\r\nwith stained glass chiefly through the munificence and exertions of\r\nthe late Canon E.B.

The successive Bishops of Ely, however, until the year\r\n1836, possessed a jurisdiction of considerable importance, and had\r\nalmost sovereign authority within the district known as the Isle of\r\nEly, which was styled \"_The Royal Franchise or Liberty of the Bishops\r\nof Ely_.\"\r\n\r\nOn the conversion of the abbacy into a bishopric A.D. 1109, a division\r\nof the property and revenues took place, and the bishop took care to\r\nprotect his own interests and those of his successors, but the charge\r\nand repairs of the church and monastery fell to the share of the prior\r\nand monks, the bishop retaining a certain jurisdiction over them. The\r\nCounty of Cambridge, with the exception of a few parishes, was\r\ntransferred from the See of Lincoln to the new See of Ely, and the\r\nManor of Spaldwick, in the County of Huntingdon, was given to the\r\nBishop of Lincoln in compensation.

Even in\r\nits present state it must be admired for its impressive though\r\nirregular grandeur, but when the north wing was standing,\r\ncorresponding with the south, which remains comparatively\r\nperfect--before the erection of the octagonal story on the Tower, and\r\nthe Galilee or portico, which, however beautiful in itself, has no\r\nproper connection with the rest--it must have presented a frontage\r\nexceedingly grand, and inferior to but few others in the kingdom.\r\nSuch, we believe, was the original design, but succeeding bishops or\r\nrulers made such alterations and additions as their tastes dictated,\r\nand in the style then prevailing. This may in some measure account for\r\nthe alterations of windows and other parts from their original\r\ndesigns, and the transitions from one style to another, producing\r\nexamples partaking of two periods, but not perfect in either.\r\n\r\nThe stone used in the erection of the Cathedral was brought from\r\nBarnack, near Stamford, and is of a much harder nature than what was\r\ncommonly used; it gives proof of great soundness and durability in the\r\nexcellent preservation of some of the mouldings. The soft white stone\r\nused for some of the interior decorations is called \"clunch,\" and is\r\nfound within a few miles of Ely; it is well adapted for the purposes\r\nto which it is applied, it is easily worked and capable of being\r\nhighly finished, but will not bear exposure to the weather. Most of\r\nthe pillars with their capitals and bases, as well as many of the\r\nmouldings and ornaments in the Early English portion of the church,\r\nare of Purbeck marble.\r\n\r\nThe lower portions both of the Tower and wings were built by Bishop\r\nRidel (1174-1189), and completed as high as the first battlements,\r\nduring the episcopate of his successor, Longchamp (1189-1197), who\r\nhowever, spent none of his money on the fabric; the lower part of this\r\nwork is late Norman, but the upper portions show indications of\r\ntransition towards the pointed style. The architecture of the Tower is\r\nworthy of attention, as it shews some beautiful specimens of arcading\r\nin bands between rows of windows, all enriched with mouldings of\r\nvarious kinds; the western face shows three rows of windows, the\r\nothers but two, as the lower one would have been hidden by the roof of\r\nthe nave and of the wing on each side, these last being originally of\r\na higher pitch than the remaining one now is. The upper band consists\r\nof circular openings with quatrefoils in the centre, and above that is\r\na corbel-table. A spire of timber covered with lead was erected on the\r\nTower about the middle of the thirteenth century, but it was\r\nafterwards removed, and the upper portion of the Tower, in the\r\nDecorated style, was added, and it was again surmounted by a spire.\r\nThese additions were found to be injurious, and it became necessary to\r\nstrengthen the lower portions of the Tower to support it; nor is it\r\nimprobable that the fall of the north-western Transept was in some\r\ndegree owing to the great additional weight, or that it was so far\r\ninjured as to require removal. The spire was, we believe, finally\r\nremoved about the end of the last century.\r\n\r\nThe octagonal story does not harmonize with the lower portion. There\r\nis a large window with transoms in each of the four principal sides,\r\nthe upper portions only being glazed; it is flanked by octagonal\r\nturrets, which rise a little higher than the centre, they are faced\r\nwith shallow arcading and connected with the centre portion by small\r\nflying buttresses; in each turret is a winding stair, but only that in\r\nthe south-eastern turret is used. In the top of this turret is placed\r\nthe clock bell.\r\n\r\nThe wings of the western Tower formed a second Transept to the church,\r\nand were doubtless perfectly similar; the remaining wing has towers at\r\nthe angles; that at the south-west angle is larger than the other,\r\nthough they are of equal height, and rise considerably higher than the\r\nwing. Both wing and towers are covered with ranges of arcading one\r\nabove another, commencing a few feet from the bottom; the three lowest\r\ntiers are round-headed, the fourth are trefoil-headed, the fifth and\r\nall above are pointed and profusely adorned with mouldings; and the\r\nwhole surface is enriched with diaper patterns. The roof was formerly\r\nof a higher pitch, as may be seen by the marks on the Tower.\r\n\r\nSome years ago there was a communication by a covered viaduct over the\r\nroad, between this Transept and the east wing of the Bishop's Palace,\r\nwhich enabled him to visit the Cathedral under cover; and the road\r\nover which it passed is still called \"The Gallery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Stewart has pointed out the fact that the Galilee porch is not\r\nparallel to the axis of the Nave, but has a marked inclination to the\r\nnorth, while the Choir on the other hand (like that of Exeter),\r\ninclines to the south. This doubtless was for a symbolical reason. The\r\nground plans of churches, by so frequently assuming a cross form,\r\ntypify the doctrine of the Atonement--the Choir or Chancel marking the\r\nposition of the Saviour's Head, the Transepts His Arms, and the Nave\r\nHis Body. By an expansion of this idea the Choir is made to bend\r\nsouthwards to shew the inclination of the Redeemer's Head upon the\r\ncross; while, as it would seem here the Porch is turned in an opposite\r\ndirection to indicate the position of His feet.\"[22]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Hewitt's description of Ely Cathedral, p. 13.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+The Galilee[23] or Western Porch.+\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: The name \"Galilee\" is thus accounted for by the late\r\nRev. G. Millers in his \"Description of Ely Cathedral,\" p. 43. \"As\r\nGalilee, bordering on the Gentiles, was the most remote part of the\r\nHoly Land from the Holy City of Jerusalem, so was this part of the\r\nbuilding most distant from the sanctuary, occupied by those unhappy\r\npersons, who, during their exclusion from the mysteries, were reputed\r\nscarcely, if at all better than heathens.\"\r\n\r\nAnother writer gives as a reason for the name, that upon a woman\r\napplying for leave to see a monk, her relation, she was answered in\r\nthe words of Scripture, \"Behold he goeth before you into Galilee,\r\nthere you shall see him.\"]\r\n\r\nThis has been stated to have been erected by Bishop Eustace\r\n(1198-1215), but although he is known to have made large additions to\r\nthe building and to have built the Church of St. Mary, it has been\r\nthought the present building is not quite so early as that date, and\r\nthat it was \"the work of some unknown benefactor, who had probably\r\nseen Hugh de Northwold's presbytery, and determined to lengthen the\r\nchurch westward as it had been extended in the opposite\r\ndirection?\"[24] and that it occupies the site of a former building.\r\nSir G. Scott seemed to think it was the work of Bishop Eustace.[25]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Stewart, p. 53.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Mr. Scott's Lecture.]\r\n\r\nIt is a beautiful specimen, and may fairly be ranked among the most\r\nexquisite Early English works we possess. \"Nothing,\" says Mr. Parker,\r\n\"can exceed the richness, freedom and beauty of this work; it is one\r\nof the finest porches in the world.\"[26] Externally, both sides are\r\nadorned with four tiers of arcading of different heights, one above\r\nanother; in front, the recesses of the arches are deeper, and were\r\nprobably intended for the reception of statues; some of them are\r\nornamented with dog-tooth mouldings, and have trefoils in the\r\nspandrils. It is of two stories without windows in the sides; in the\r\nupper story there is a triple lancet window at the west end, the\r\nmiddle light being higher than the one on either side; the lower story\r\nreceives light through the western opening. The arch of entrance is\r\nvery elegant, and worthy of notice; it is receding, with rich and\r\nvarious mouldings, which on each side rest upon slender columns; a\r\ncentral group of shafts separates the opening into two smaller arches,\r\nwith good tracery in the tympanum. The length on each side,\r\ninternally, is occupied by two large pointed arches, comprehending\r\nunder each two tiers of subordinate ones, the upper tier of five and\r\nthe lower of three, which contains both outer and inner arches of\r\ndifferent heights, supported by very slender columns; all the shafts\r\nwere originally of Purbeck marble, with elegant capitals; the ribs of\r\nthe vaulting are of free-stone, but the vault is of clunch. The arch\r\nof communication with the Tower is also very beautiful; it is similar\r\nin form to the exterior arch, but the ornaments in the mouldings are\r\nricher and more delicate: this has just been restored, and the Purbeck\r\nmarble pillars--some of which had disappeared and others had become\r\ndecayed--have been replaced by pillars of Devonshire marble with\r\nPurbeck plinths and capitals; the vesica in the tympanum has been\r\nfilled with stained glass representing St. Etheldreda, the foundress;\r\nthe original oaken doors have been repaired, faced, and ornamented\r\nwith scrollwork in iron: this has been effected at a cost of more than\r\nL1000. contributed by Mrs. Waddington, of Twyford House, Winchester,\r\nas a memorial to her husband.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Parker's \"Introduction to the study of Gothic\r\nArchitecture,\" p. 91.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+The Interior of the Tower+\r\n\r\nhas been considerably improved by the removal of a floor which had\r\nbeen inserted just above the lower arches, thus opening it to the\r\ngreat lantern, bringing into view a series of beautiful colonnades\r\nand arches, for many years hidden, except to those who explored the\r\nupper portions, besides relieving it of the weight of a large quantity\r\nof stone and materials.[27] The tops of the four fine arches which\r\noriginally supported the Tower can now be partially seen; they were\r\nspacious openings, but are contracted by interior arches in a\r\ndifferent style, which were inserted in the early part of the\r\nfifteenth century, for the purpose of strengthening the building. The\r\nbeautiful painted ceiling of the Tower was designed, and all its\r\nessential parts executed, with a rare union of artistic skill and\r\narchaeological knowledge, by H.S. le Strange, Esq., of Hunstanton Hall,\r\nNorfolk, at the expense of H.R. Evans, Esq., then Registrar to the\r\nDean and Chapter; the centre contains a figure of the Saviour in an\r\naureole: He is represented as holding a globe in His left hand, and is\r\nsurrounded by the sun, moon, and stars; on either side are Cherubim\r\nand Seraphim bearing scrolls containing the words \"Holy! Holy! Lord\r\nGod of Sabaoth.\" The eastern centre contains a shield on which is the\r\n_dextra Domini_, the \"right hand of the Lord,\" as an emblem of the\r\nCreator; the corners are enriched with foliage, and the whole is\r\nsurrounded by a border containing the words \"Thou art worthy, O Lord,\r\nto receive glory, and honour, and power; for Thou hast created all\r\nthings, and for Thy pleasure they are and were created.\" This was\r\nfinished in 1855. The floor, of which the pattern forms a labyrinth,\r\nwas completed in 1870.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: At the time these works were in progress (Oct., 1845),\r\nMr. Bassevi, the eminent architect of the Fitzwilliam Museum, at\r\nCambridge, visited the Tower, and unfortunately fell from one floor to\r\nanother, and was killed. He was buried in the north aisle of the\r\nChoir, and an elegant monumental brass, by Messrs. Waller has been\r\nlaid over his remains.]\r\n\r\nThe window over the entrance from the Galilee, was inserted A.D. 1800,\r\nand improved in 1807 at the expense of Bishop Yorke, who filled two\r\nportions of the upper part with stained glass, the other two being\r\nfilled at the cost of Dr. Waddington, then a Prebendary of the\r\nCathedral; the remainder has lately been completed by Mr.\r\nClutterbuck; the subjects are taken from the history of our Lord.\r\nThis, with the wall decoration below, has been done at the expense of\r\nJ.T. Waddington, Esq., and of his widow. Beneath the window are four\r\nshields of arms; the upper one on the south side shows the arms of\r\nBishop Yorke impaled with the arms of the see; on the north side are\r\nthose of Bishop Yorke with those of Dr. Waddington; the lower ones\r\ncontain on the south, the arms of J.T. Waddington, Esq., and on the\r\nnorth side, the same impaled with those of the family of Cocksedge, of\r\nwhich Mrs. Waddington was a member.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further the visitor should pause, and observe the\r\ngreat length of the Cathedral, the noble appearance of the lofty\r\narches, and the sublime grandeur of the whole. When we look around and\r\nsee the lofty Tower with its decorated ceiling above; on the right,\r\nthe south-west Transept, rich in the extreme with its several arcades\r\nof plain, intersecting, and trifoliated arches; and in front, through\r\nthe long vista of the Nave, the noble Octagon, and the enriched Choir,\r\nto the extreme end of the church, we cannot but pause and admire the\r\nskill of man shewn in such a work; but when we consider to whose\r\nhonour and glory such skill is exerted, we no longer wonder that man's\r\nbest energies should be called forth to construct and ornament such a\r\ntemple,\r\n\r\n     \"Where through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault\r\n     The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.\"--_Gray_.\r\n\r\nMay those who visit this temple for the purpose of examining it as a\r\nbuilding made with hands, ever bear in mind the great and solemn\r\npurpose for which it was erected--the worship of Almighty God--and let\r\ntheir aspirations of prayer and praise ascend to Him in thankfulness\r\nfor the privilege afforded to them of freely and openly worshipping\r\nHim, who as freely invites all to become partakers of a home made\r\nwithout hands, eternal in the heavens.\r\n\r\n\r\n+The South-west Transept+\r\n\r\nwas, until a few years ago, separated from the Tower by a wall of stud\r\nand plaster, and used as a receptacle for materials required for the\r\nrepair of the fabric, but is now thrown open in all its beauty; it has\r\nbeen repaired and restored at considerable expense.\r\n\r\nThe architecture of this portion of the Cathedral is worthy of special\r\nnotice; the various forms of the arches, and the beautiful mouldings\r\nand ornaments on some of them, cannot but attract attention. The\r\npanelled ceiling has been painted by T. Gambier Parry, Esq., of\r\nHighnam Court, Gloucester; the floor has been re-laid with encaustic\r\ntiles and marble; a new font[28] in the transitional style, has been\r\nplaced here, at the cost of the late Canon Selwyn, and this Transept\r\nwill in future be used as the Baptistry of the Cathedral. Several\r\nwindows, which had for many years been blocked up with stone and\r\nrubbish, have been re-opened, and those of the lower tier at the south\r\nend filled with stained glass by Mr. Wailes:\r\n\r\n     The west window contains--the Meeting of Jacob and Rachel;\r\n     the Choice of Esther; and the Crowning of Esther; and was\r\n     the gift of Dean Peacock.\r\n\r\n     The east window comprises--the Meeting of Isaac and Rebecca;\r\n     of Boaz and Ruth; and the Marriage at Cana: given by\r\n     Hamilton Cooke, Esq., of Carr House, Doncaster.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: A font, the gift of Dean Spencer, in 1693, formerly\r\nstood under the third arch on the south side of the Nave, but having\r\nno accordance in style with the architecture of the building, it has\r\nbeen removed, and placed in a newly erected church at Prickwillow,\r\nnear Ely.]\r\n\r\nAdjoining this Transept on the east is the apsidal +Chapel of St.\r\nCatharine+, for many years in ruins, but rebuilt in 1848, and the\r\nfloor laid in a combination of marble and encaustic tiles, with\r\nborders of incised Portland stone, the incisions being filled with\r\ncoloured cement; the windows have been filled with stained glass by\r\nMr. Wilmshurst:\r\n\r\n     The east window, representing the Baptism of our Lord, by\r\n     John, after a picture by Bassans; given by the Rev. W.G.\r\n     Townley, of Upwell, Norfolk, as a memorial of his brother,\r\n     R.G. Townley, Esq., of Fulbourn, for several years one of\r\n     the representatives of the county in Parliament.\r\n\r\n     The subject of the other window is from the words of our\r\n     Lord, \"Suffer little children to come unto me;\" from a\r\n     picture by Overbeck: the gift of Canon Selwyn.\r\n\r\nWe now proceed on our course, and enter\r\n\r\n+The Nave,+\r\n\r\nwhich is of ample dimensions, being 203 feet in length; it has a\r\nlighter appearance than many churches of Norman architecture, and may\r\nbe considered a late specimen of that style, having been finished\r\nabout 1174. The length originally comprised thirteen bays, one of\r\nwhich has been included in the plan of the Octagon; there are no\r\nsingle cylindrical columns as in many churches, but the pillars are\r\nclustered and alternate in size and pattern; the arches appear to be\r\nsomewhat higher than semicircular, being stilted, or some little way\r\nrectilinear before they take the circular bend. Those of the second\r\ntier comprehend in each two smaller ones, supported by a much lighter\r\ncolumn; each compartment in the upper tier is divided into three small\r\narches, the middle one being larger and higher than that on either\r\nside of it. Over the whole aisle on each side runs a broad gallery\r\nusually called the \"triforium,\" lighted by Perpendicular windows in\r\nthe outer wall; and above is the \"clerestory,\" or \"clear-story,\"\r\naffording a narrow passage in the thickness of the main wall, lighted\r\nby the original Norman windows; thus the height is divided into three\r\nparts--ground-story, triforium, and clerestory; and the breadth into\r\nthe same number--nave, north aisle, and south aisle; probably designed\r\nas a type of the Trinity, as it is thought by many that these\r\nsymbolical considerations were used in the building of churches in\r\nearly ages.\r\n\r\nA new floor has been laid in the Nave[29] in a design which introduces\r\nseveral kinds of stone and marble, each bay in a pattern differing\r\nfrom the adjoining one; the large slab of marble which laid in the\r\nsecond bay from the east, and from which the memorial brass has long\r\ndisappeared, remains _in situ_, it is not known to whose memory it was\r\noriginally placed, but evidently to some dignified ecclesiastic.\r\nTowards the west the floor has been lowered so as to shew the bases of\r\nthe columns which had for many years been hidden. A semicircular\r\nroof-shaft runs from the floor to the top of the wall between the\r\nbays, but the roof, until lately, was open to view from the floor to\r\nthe rafters; a new painted ceiling has been executed,[30] which adds\r\nmuch to the grandeur of the building.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Bishop Turton by his will left the sum of L500 towards\r\nthis object, and Bishop Harold Browne gave a like sum towards the\r\ncompletion of the paving of the Nave and aisles.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: A portion of the expense of this work was defrayed by a\r\nbequest by the Rev. G. Millers, a Minor Canon, augmented by the\r\nliberality of his Executors to L400.]\r\n\r\nThis ceiling was commenced in 1858, by Henry Styleman le Strange,\r\nEsq., of Hunstanton Hall, and the six western bays were designed and\r\nthe chief parts executed by him, and finished in 1861; his lamented\r\ndecease in the following year gave rise to some fears as to its\r\ncompletion, but his friend T. Gambier Parry, Esq., undertook to finish\r\nthe work so ably begun, as a token of affection to his memory, and it\r\nnow presents a beautiful series of pictures in compartments, forming,\r\nas it were, a carefully studied epitome of the sacred history of man\r\nas recorded in Holy Scripture; and exhibiting specimens of skill and\r\ntaste executed by two gentlemen of independent fortune that may be\r\nalmost considered marvellous.\r\n\r\nIt may be mentioned that the ceiling is upwards of 200 feet long, and\r\nis 86 feet from the floor, and the general size of the principal\r\nfigures in the painting is nine feet.\r\n\r\nThe central subjects are arranged in chronological order from the\r\nwest, each being surrounded by a border varying in form, and\r\ncontaining a legend; in the ten western bays the subjects are\r\nsupported by figures which are for the most part representations of\r\nPatriarchs and Prophets, carrying scrolls[31] upon which are written\r\nwords of their own, bearing more or less forcibly upon the coming of\r\nthe Messiah. The eleventh subject has, properly speaking, no\r\nsupporters, but the Shepherds and the Magi are so arranged as to carry\r\non the artistic effect of a central group with conspicuous lateral\r\nfigures. In the twelfth and last subject, the picture extends entirely\r\nacross the ceiling; in the centre is the Lord Jesus in His glorified\r\nhumanity, seated on a throne, round about which is a \"rainbow like\r\nunto an emerald.\" Above His head is the choir of Seraphim, painted in\r\nprismatic colours, and reflected in the \"sea of glass before the\r\nthrone.\" On the right and left are the figures of the twelve apostles\r\nseated; beyond them, on the dexter side, are two archangels, St.\r\nGabriel, \"the angel of redemption,\" holding the standard of the cross,\r\nand St. Raphael, holding a sword with its point downwards, expressive\r\nof victory and peace; at their feet rise three figures, typical of the\r\nblessed received into glory. On the sinister side are also two\r\narchangels, St. Uriel holding his sword downwards, and St. Michael\r\nspearing the dragon, expressive of the condemnation of, and victory\r\nover, sin. The figure of our Lord is connected with the tree of Jesse\r\nby its last branches, which break into scrolls and golden fruit at His\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: In the key to the ceiling as represented in the two\r\nfollowing pages, we have placed the words of the legends under the\r\nprincipal subjects, and the contents of the scrolls under the names of\r\nthe persons represented.]\r\n\r\nThe arch which separates the Nave from the Octagon has also been\r\ndecorated, as well as the wall which connects the arch with the\r\nceiling; the design contains the evangelistic symbols of St. Matthew\r\nand St. John, and the text \"Blessed be the Name of His Majesty for\r\never, and all the earth shall be filled with His Majesty. Amen and\r\nAmen.\"\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's Note: In the original book, the following text in\r\nbrackets is placed sideways along the right and left sides of a box\r\naround the rest of the text.

We first\r\nobserve a range of small semicircular arches running under the\r\nwindows, with a chevron moulding over some of them; in the first bay\r\nfrom the west there is a row of intersecting arches over them. The\r\nvaulting is supported by semi-columns placed at the back of the\r\npillars on one side, and on the other by wall-shafts between the\r\nwindows, and forms a great contrast to the rich vaulting of the\r\neastern portions of the Cathedral. Several traces of early fresco work\r\nmay be observed in the vault of the tenth bay from the west, and in\r\nother places.\r\n\r\nUnder the fourth window is a doorway, which is, on the exterior,\r\nrichly ornamented, filling all available space, the whole of the\r\nimposts, arch mouldings and capitals being thickly sculptured with\r\ninterlaced carving. In the tympanum is a figure of the Saviour in an\r\naureole (or 'glory' of a pointed oval shape), held up by two angels\r\nsitting, holding an open book surmounted by a cross in His left hand,\r\nHis right being elevated in the act of benediction. The mouldings\r\nabove, as well as the capitals, jambs, and pilasters, are enriched\r\nwith running foliage, and with a series of medallions containing\r\nbirds, animals, flowers, &c., some of which are very curious. This was\r\nformerly the Prior's entrance from the cloisters; it now opens into a\r\nprivate garden belonging to the Deanery.[32]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: A new door, with scrollwork in iron, has been put in at\r\nthe cost of the Bedfordshire Archaeological Society.]\r\n\r\nNear this doorway stands a curious relic, deserving attention. It is\r\nthe lower portion of a stone cross with a square pedestal, found some\r\nyears ago at Haddenham, in the Isle of Ely, where it was used as a\r\nhorse-block; the inscription on the pedestal is in Roman capitals,\r\nexcept the E, which is Saxon:\r\n\r\n     \"LUCEM-TUAM-OVINO-DA-DEUS-ET-REQUI[=E].-AMEN.\"\r\n\r\nA translation of it is thus given by Mr. Bentham: \"Grant, O God, to\r\nOvin, thy light and rest. Amen.\" On reference to the history of St.\r\nEtheldreda, foundress of the monastery at Ely,[33] to which allusion\r\nwas made in the introduction to this work, it will be seen that her\r\nsteward bore the name of Ovin, and it is not improbable that the cross\r\nwas erected either to his honour during his life, or to his memory\r\nsoon after his death; probably in the early part of the eighth\r\ncentury: this would make it earlier by nearly four hundred years than\r\nanything else in the church. The Bissexcentenary, or twelve-hundredth\r\nanniversary of the foundation of the monastery at Ely by St.\r\nEtheldreda was commemorated by a grand Festival in October, 1873.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Bentham's History, i. 45, &c.]\r\n\r\nThe doorway at the east end of the aisle, under the last window,\r\nformerly the entrance for the monks from the cloisters, now the south\r\nentrance to the Cathedral, is also worthy of special observation; the\r\nhead is trefoiled, and ornamented with figures holding pastoral\r\nstaves; above, two dragons are represented with their necks entwined;\r\nthe mouldings are rich and various, and the capitals and jambs are\r\nsculptured with grotesque ornaments. By some persons it has been\r\nthought that these doorways were insertions, as they do not accord\r\nwith the lines of the adjoining wall, perhaps brought from some other\r\nbuilding, and re-erected here when the cloisters were built.\r\n\r\nOn the second pillar from the east end of the Nave in both aisles, may\r\nbe observed a niche with a canopy, indicating the position of the\r\nrood-screen at the western extremity of the original Choir, which\r\nextended eastward across and beyond the space now covered by the\r\nOctagon.\r\n\r\nThe windows of the aisles, as also those of the triforium, were\r\noriginally Norman, but were altered at some subsequent period to a\r\nlater style; those, however, of this aisle have, with one exception,\r\nbeen restored to their original form, and all are filled with stained\r\nglass. We will endeavour to describe them in their order, beginning at\r\nthe western end of the aisle.\r\n\r\n     _1st._ The days of Creation; Adam expelled from Eden; the\r\n     punishment of Mankind; the Offerings of Cain and\r\n     Abel--executed by Messrs.

Sparke.\r\n\r\nA tablet on the wall, near the eastern window of this aisle, bears the\r\nfollowing inscription:--\r\n\r\n          \"1676,\r\n      _Roger Clopton,\r\n    Rector of Downham,\r\n Gave two hundred pounds,\r\nBy which The greatest Part\r\n   of the Nave of This\r\n       Church Was\r\n         paved._\"\r\n\r\nThe Nave and aisles do not now require a gift of this kind, having\r\nbeen recently paved at considerable expense, but the floor of the\r\nOctagon, South Transept, and Choir aisles will require a large sum to\r\ncomplete them, and if some kind friends will follow the example of\r\nRoger Clopton it will indeed be a timely benefaction, and now very\r\nmuch to be desired as an important step towards the completion of the\r\nwork of restoration.\r\n\r\nBefore examining the Octagon we will make some observations on\r\n\r\n+The Great Transept.+\r\n\r\nThis includes both arms, although for distinction it is frequently\r\nspoken of as the north and south Transept. This is the oldest portion\r\nof the Cathedral, having been begun by Abbot Simeon A.D. 1083, of\r\nwhose work, however, but little more than the ground story remains.\r\nBefore the fall of the Norman Tower in 1322, each arm was longer by\r\none bay, which is now included in the plan of the Octagon, in the same\r\nmanner as the Nave. Both arms have aisles, but those of the south, and\r\none in the north, are enclosed for various purposes. In each arm there\r\nis a simple cylindrical shaft, of which no other specimen occurs in\r\nany other part of the church. The capitals of the columns and the\r\narches above the lower tier are similar to those of the Nave. The roof\r\nin both is of bare rafters with rich cornices, painted with flowers\r\nand devices, and angels with wings expanded under the principals;\r\nboth arms have recently undergone a thorough repair, the rafters and\r\ncornices have been re-painted and gilded in their original style,\r\nwhich, with the stained glass lately inserted in the windows, produces\r\nan amount of colour the effect of which is very striking.\r\n\r\nWe will first refer for details to the north arm; of which the western\r\naisle is open, and is lighted by three Norman windows, all of which\r\nhave been recently filled with stained glass:\r\n\r\n     The south window--executed by M. Lusson, of Paris; the\r\n     subjects taken from the Parables; as a memorial of the Rev.\r\n     A. Moore, of Walpole, who designed and executed three\r\n     windows in the Cathedral.\r\n\r\n     The middle window, by the same artist; subject, the Good\r\n     Samaritan: given by John Muriel, Esq.\r\n\r\n     The northern window was executed by the Rev. A. Moore; the\r\n     subject taken from the parable of the Prodigal Son.\r\n\r\nAt the north end of the Transept is a small colonnade, the arches of\r\nwhich are irregular, those opposite the lower windows being higher\r\nthan the others to allow free passage to the light. At the north-east\r\ncorner is a doorway communicating with a staircase leading to the\r\nupper parts of the church. In the year 1699 the fall of a portion of\r\nthe north-west corner took place, but it was so well rebuilt as not to\r\nbe discernable in the interior. The windows in the triforium on the\r\neast side are original; those of the triforium on the west side, and\r\nthe upper ones at the north end, are Perpendicular insertions; the\r\nrest are all in their original form, or have been restored to it;\r\nthose in the north end have been filled with stained glass:\r\n\r\n     The two lower, and the western window of the second tier, by\r\n     Mr. Wailes, at the cost of the late Canon E.B. Sparke.\r\n\r\n     The eastern window of the second tier, by the Rev. A. Moore.\r\n     The subjects of these four windows are incidents in the\r\n     history of St. Paul.\r\n\r\n     The windows in the upper tier--by Messrs. Ward and\r\n     Hughes--also at the cost of the late Canon E.B. Sparke,\r\n     contain figures of eminent persons in New Testament history,\r\n     with arms, &c. in the tracery. Those in the western window\r\n     represent Silas; Clement, bishop; Apollos; Judas Barsabas;\r\n     Dionysius, areopagite; and Philip, deacon: in the eastern\r\n     window, Titus, bishop; St. Paul; Timothy; St. Mark; St.\r\n     Barnabas; and St. Luke.\r\n\r\nThe eastern aisle is divided by walls behind the columns into\r\ncompartments; the northern one forms a communication with the entrance\r\nto the Lady Chapel; the middle one a vestry for the Grammar Scholars;\r\nand the third a vestry for the Lay-Clerks; remains of fresco paintings\r\nmay be seen on the walls of both these compartments.\r\n\r\n     The stained glass window in the middle compartment contains\r\n     subjects from the history of our Saviour; executed by\r\n     Messrs. Clayton and Bell: presented by--Heywood, Esq., as a\r\n     memorial to his mother.\r\n\r\n     The window in the third compartment, by the same artists,\r\n     represents the Entombment and the Ascension, and is the gift\r\n     of C.L. Higgins, Esq., of Turvey Abbey.\r\n\r\nThe floor of this portion has been recently re-laid by the munificence\r\nof the late Canon E.B. Sparke.\r\n\r\nWe now cross the Octagon (which we will examine afterwards) to the\r\nsouth arm of the Transept. At the south end is a colonnade, but\r\ndiffering in design to that in the north arm, the arches being all of\r\nequal height, but not so high as the others; over these is a row of\r\nintersecting arches. It is probable that these galleries were added at\r\na period subsequent to the erection of the Transept, and intended as a\r\nmeans of communication from one triforium to the other; in the south\r\neast corner is a staircase leading to the triforium. Some remains of\r\nancient decoration may be observed on the walls and capitals, portions\r\nof which have been renewed.\r\n\r\nThe eastern aisle was formerly divided by a wall behind each column\r\ninto three compartments, with wooden screens in front; but these were\r\nall removed in 1814, when it was enclosed as we now see it to form the\r\nLibrary, which is lighted on the east by three Early English windows,\r\nand on the south by a Norman one. The western aisle appears to have\r\nbeen closed for many years, as on the walls built in the arches (and\r\nwhich until lately completely filled the openings,) there is an arcade\r\nof intersecting Norman arches. Of this aisle, thus inclosed, one\r\nportion is used as a vestry by the Vergers, having an entrance from\r\nthe south aisle of the Nave; the remaining portion as a vestry for the\r\nClergy. The carved oak door to this vestry deserves attention; it is\r\nnot exactly known whether it originally belonged to the Cathedral, the\r\ncarved devices are similar to those in the chapel of Bishop Alcock, in\r\nthe north aisle of the Choir; there is no doubt that it belonged to\r\nsome building erected by that prelate, if not to this, probably to the\r\nchapel of Jesus College, Cambridge, of which Bishop Alcock was the\r\nfounder. It was found at Landbeach, and sent to the Cathedral by Canon\r\nFardell.\r\n\r\nThe windows of the western aisle and those of the clerestory on both\r\nsides are in their original form, and so are those of the two lower\r\ntiers at the south end, but the others are of later age; in the gable\r\nis a low window of seven lights, very different to the upper windows\r\nin the north arm: those in the south end and two in the western aisle\r\nhave been filled with stained glass:\r\n\r\n     The eastern window of the lower tier of the south end, by M.\r\n     Henri Gerente, contains incidents in the history of Joseph;\r\n     presented by the late Canon E.B. Sparke.\r\n\r\n     The western window by the same artist, contains incidents\r\n     from the history of Moses: contributed by some of the then\r\n     Lessees under the Bishop.\r\n\r\n     The eastern window of the second tier, by Messrs. Henri and\r\n     Alfred Gerente, contains subjects from the history of\r\n     Abraham, with parallels: the gift of Incumbents of livings\r\n     in the diocese, and in the patronage of the Bishop.\r\n\r\n     The western window, by M. Alfred Gerente, contains subjects\r\n     from the history of Jacob; the gift of Incumbents of livings\r\n     formerly in the patronage of the Bishop, but not in his\r\n     diocese.\r\n\r\n     The gable window contains six figures of the Patriarchs,\r\n     with a figure of our Lord in the centre; some of which were\r\n     executed by Mr. Howes and others by Mr. Preedy: the gift of\r\n     some of the Peers and Prelates educated at the University of\r\n     Cambridge.\r\n\r\n     The middle window of the western aisle, by M. Lusson; the\r\n     subjects taken from the Book of Jeremiah: given by the Rev.\r\n     G. Rous, Laverton, as a memorial of Dr. Hugh Thomas,\r\n     nineteenth Dean of Ely.\r\n\r\n     The north window is also by a French artist, and given by\r\n     the late Canon E.B. Sparke.\r\n\r\nThe piece of tessellated pavement in the floor was found some years\r\nago between the Choir and the Lady Chapel, under the present level of\r\nthe earth, and was placed here for preservation; when the floor of\r\nthis arm of the Transept is re-laid, this may perhaps be again\r\ninserted, or removed to some other place.\r\n\r\n\r\n+The Octagon.+\r\n\r\nWe now come to this special glory of the Cathedral, \"in which,\" says\r\nMr. Millers, \"elegance, magnificence, and strength are so happily\r\nblended, that it is impossible to determine in which respect it is\r\nmost admirable.\" We follow up the description nearly in his own words.\r\nHere stood originally a square Norman tower, which in the year 1322,\r\nfrom the unequal pressure of the four parts of the church, gave way\r\nand fell eastward, crushing in its fall several adjoining arches. \"It\r\ncould not have happened at a more favourable conjuncture; as the\r\nconvent was rich, spirited, and liberal; and though another great work\r\nhad been begun the preceding year, (the erection of a new Lady\r\nChapel,) the repair of this great dilapidation was immediately\r\nundertaken, and completed in a few years, by Alan de Walsingham, at\r\nthat time sacrist,[34] an officer under whose particular charge were\r\nall the monastic buildings. It has continued above five hundred years,\r\nand may it yet continue a noble proof of his consummate skill as an\r\narchitect!\" The conception was original, being perhaps the first\r\nbuilding of the kind ever erected. By throwing the weight upon eight\r\nstrong piers and arches instead of four, he has probably guarded\r\nagainst the recurrence of a similar accident; at the same time he has\r\ngiven a larger space, a more agreeable form, and greater scope for\r\nembellishment, which is, however, most judiciously confined within\r\nsuch limits as not to interfere with sober and impressive grandeur. No\r\none can behold it without admiring the skill which has suspended,\r\nrather than supported, a very heavy timber roof over so wide an area\r\nwithout a pillar.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: He was made Sub-Prior, then Prior, and elected Bishop,\r\nA.D. 1344, but the election was not confirmed.]\r\n\r\n\"It is not equilateral; there are four longer and four shorter sides,\r\nalternate and respectively equal. Four lofty arches, in the four\r\nlonger sides, open into the four principal parts of the church:\r\nalternately with these, in the four shorter sides, are as many more,\r\nmuch lower, opening obliquely into the aisles above and below the\r\nTransept. The arches are all supported by elegant clustered and\r\nconjoined columns, and their capitals are wreaths of flowers and\r\nfoliage.\"\r\n\r\nIn the shorter sides there is room for some ornamentation, but the\r\nornaments are chaste and not profuse. The four low arches in them are\r\nunder canopies resting on good carved heads, which remain perfect.\r\nThose on the north-east are said to be intended for Edward III. and\r\nhis queen Phillippa, in whose time the building was erected; on the\r\nsouth-eastern arch are represented the heads of a bishop and a priest,\r\nperhaps meant for Bishop Hotham and Prior Crauden, superiors at the\r\nperiod of erection. On the north-west arch are the heads of another\r\npriest, apparently younger, and of some secular person with long hair;\r\nthe former is supposed to represent Alan de Walsingham, the skilful\r\narchitect of this noble work; and the latter the chief mason. On the\r\nremaining arch are two figures, the meaning of which we can scarcely\r\ncomprehend.\r\n\r\nA little above each of these lower arches are three brackets, or\r\ncorbels, with canopies; the original figures (if any) placed on these\r\nbrackets have long since disappeared, but the spaces have lately been\r\nfilled with sitting figures of the Apostles,[35] executed in stone by\r\nMr. Redfern, each holding a symbolical instrument. If we start from\r\nthe Choir and proceed to the right hand we shall find them placed in\r\nthe following order:--\r\n\r\n      {  St. Matthew--box.\r\nS.E.  {  St. John--chalice and dragon.\r\n      {  St. James, minor--club.\r\n\r\n      {  St. Philip--small cross.\r\nS.W.  {  St. Paul--sword.\r\n      {  St. Bartholomew--knife.\r\n\r\n      {  St. Thomas--mason's square.\r\nN.W.  {  St. Peter--keys.\r\n      {  St. Andrew--cross.\r\n\r\n      {  St. Jude--spear.\r\nN.E.  {  St. James, major--pilgrim's staff.\r\n      {  St. Simon--saw.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: These were contributed by the Bishop of Carlisle (5),\r\nDr. Kennedy, Sir G.G. Scott, Captain Horton, Canon Underwood, and\r\nothers.]\r\n\r\nThere are also sixteen small stone heads, four connected with each\r\ngroup of three Apostles, which are not very clearly seen, perhaps,\r\nfrom the floor of the Cathedral, but which, when examined, shew by the\r\nconventual prophetic cap given to them, that they are intended to\r\nrepresent the sixteen Prophets of the Old Testament. Above these\r\ncanopies, in each of the four sides, is a gallery or passage with an\r\nembattled parapet, and above that a large window of four lights with\r\ngeometrical tracery; it is extremely sharp pointed, and towards the\r\ntop each window is faced internally with a trellis or lattice-work of\r\nstone, which adds to its elegance without intercepting the light.\r\nThese windows rise to the same height as the higher arches; they have\r\nbeen filled with stained glass by Mr. Wailes, and the subjects are\r\nchiefly representations of persons who were instrumental in the\r\nfoundation, erection, or restoration of the Cathedral, of the reigning\r\nsovereigns at the respective periods, and of others who figured in the\r\ntraditionary history of the foundress.\r\n\r\n     The window in the south-east angle is designed to\r\n     commemorate the principal persons who figured in the\r\n     traditionary history of the foundress. The figures in the\r\n     upper tier represent Anna, father of St. Etheldreda; St.\r\n     Etheldreda as queen; Tonbert, her first, and Egfrid, her\r\n     second husband. In the lower tier, St. Etheldreda as abbess;\r\n     Wilfred Bishop of York; St. Erminilda, the third abbess; and\r\n     St. Sexburga, the second abbess. The tracery contains other\r\n     figures and emblems, with the arms of the donor, the late\r\n     Canon E.B. Sparke.\r\n\r\n     The window in the north-east angle, in continuation of the\r\n     same design, contains in the upper tier figures representing\r\n     St. Withburga, St. Edmond, St. Werberga, fourth abbess of\r\n     Ely, and Archbishop Dunstan. In the lower tier, Bishop\r\n     Ethelwold; Brithnoth, Duke of Northumberland; Abbot\r\n     Brithnoth, and King Edgar. The tracery contains the arms of\r\n     the University of Cambridge, with other figures and devices:\r\n     contributed by subscriptions from the Bachelors and\r\n     Undergraduates of the University of Cambridge.\r\n\r\n     The window in the north-west angle also contains eight\r\n     representative figures, viz., in the upper tier, (reading\r\n     from right to left) are William I., Henry I., Henry III.,\r\n     and Edward II.; and under these, Abbot Simeon, who commenced\r\n     the present Cathedral; Harvey, the first Bishop of Ely;\r\n     Bishop Northwold, who erected the Presbytery; and Alan de\r\n     Walsingham, the skilful architect of the Octagon. The\r\n     tracery contains medallions in which are pictured the\r\n     shrine of St. Etheldreda; Abbot Simeon laying the foundation\r\n     stone of the Cathedral; Alan de Walsingham and monks weeping\r\n     over the ruins of the central tower; the arms of the\r\n     University of Cambridge, of the See of Ely, of Bishop\r\n     Sparke, with other devices. Half the cost of this window was\r\n     defrayed by subscriptions from some graduates of the\r\n     University of Cambridge, and the other half by a portion of\r\n     the accumulation of the money given by Bishop Sparke[36] for\r\n     the east window.\r\n\r\n     [Footnote 36: Bishop Sparke gave L1500 stock in the Reduced\r\n     Three per cents. about 1833, but the east window was not\r\n     completed until 1857; the amount had in the mean time\r\n     accumulated considerably, and proved sufficient to defray\r\n     the cost of the east window, of six windows in the\r\n     clerestory of the Choir, of the four windows of the\r\n     triforium of the Presbytery, and half the cost of the\r\n     north-west window of the Octagon.]\r\n\r\n     The window in the south-west angle also contains eight\r\n     figures in the four principal lights, arranged in the\r\n     following order--the Queen in her coronation robes; the\r\n     Prince Consort in his robes as Chancellor of the University\r\n     of Cambridge; and under these are represented Dr. Turton,\r\n     the then bishop, and Dr. Peacock, the then dean of Ely;\r\n     these figures being commemorative of the present extensive\r\n     restorations: the other four represent King Edward III. and\r\n     his queen Philippa, in whose reign the Octagon was built;\r\n     and under these, Bishop Hotham and Prior Crauden, the great\r\n     officers of the Cathedral at that period. The tracery\r\n     contains the arms of the University of Cambridge in the\r\n     centre, and on either side the arms respectively of those\r\n     whose figures are represented in the window. The cost of a\r\n     portion of this was graciously defrayed by Her Majesty;\r\n     Bishop Turton and Dean Peacock gave the cost of their own\r\n     figures respectively, and the remainder was paid by the\r\n     capitular body.\r\n\r\nMidway up each vaulting shaft is a canopied niche of unusual but very\r\nbeautiful character; these niches rest upon sculptured corbels\r\nrepresenting some striking incidents of St. Etheldreda's life, by\r\nbeginning at the right-hand side of the north-west arch, and\r\ncontinuing our course to the right-hand round the Octagon, we may\r\nexamine them in detail.\r\n\r\n     The first represents her marriage.\r\n\r\n     The second, her taking the veil at the Monastery of\r\n     Coldingham at the hands of Wilfred, bishop of York; her\r\n     crown laid upon the altar.\r\n\r\n     The third, her pilgrim's staff taking root and bearing\r\n     leaves and branches over her whilst she slept by the way.\r\n\r\n     The fourth, her preservation, with her attendant nuns, on a\r\n     rock surrounded by a miraculous inundation, when pursued by\r\n     the king and his attendants.\r\n\r\n     The fifth, her installation as abbess of Ely, by Wilfred.\r\n\r\n     The sixth, her death and burial.\r\n\r\n     The seventh, a legendary tale of one Brithstan delivered\r\n     from bonds by her merits.\r\n\r\n     The eighth, the translation of her body.\r\n\r\nThese were probably placed there to break the apparent great\r\npreponderance of vertical lines. The vaulting is of wood, and its\r\nfan-shaped compartments terminate at a distance from the centre, thus\r\nallowing an aperture thirty feet wide, over which rises the Lantern,\r\nan exact octagon, having on each of its sides a large pointed window\r\nof four openings with rich tracery, all filled with stained glass,\r\nwhich has the effect of subduing the light; below these windows are a\r\nseries of panels with decorated heads, and under them another series\r\nof smaller ones; above the ceiling is a chamber formerly used for\r\nbells. The Lantern also is of English oak, and its construction a\r\ncurious piece of carpentry. The whole has been thoroughly repaired,\r\nand in a great measure restored in exact conformity with the original,\r\nat a considerable expense.[37]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: This great work is designed as a memorial of Dean\r\nPeacock, and a more fitting one could scarcely be found, as it is one\r\nof the great works he had in contemplation. \"The Dean and Chapter felt\r\nthat they could not propose any record of the zealous exertions of the\r\nlate Dean, so appropriate as the restoration of the central portion of\r\nthe Cathedral Church; which, after the great improvements executed\r\nunder his superintendence in the eastern and western portions of the\r\nfabric, would form as it were a keystone of the whole work.\"\r\nSubscriptions amounting to about L10,000, were given by many noblemen\r\nas well as other friends of Dean Peacock; the capitular body\r\ncontributing very largely towards the work.]\r\n\r\nWhen the white and yellow-wash was cleared away from the woodwork of\r\nthe Octagon and Lantern in 1850, some remnants of ancient colouring\r\nwere discovered. In the archives of the Cathedral are preserved the\r\naccounts of the materials used in this painting, the prices of the\r\ncolours, and the wages paid to the workmen. The name of the principal\r\nartist was Walter; he is dignified by the name of \"Pictor,\" but he\r\nonly received Eightpence per week, \"_praeter mensam et robam_\" the\r\n\"_roba_\" being the painter's dress of the period, which was very like\r\na modern gentleman's dressing gown. The colouring of this \"Walter\"\r\nbetween the years 1335 and 1351 seems to have been of a very simple\r\ncharacter. The only evidence of designs that remained in 1850 were on\r\nthe flat panels of the vaulting, which was covered with an imitation\r\nof ordinary gothic flowing tracery. The pattern was a series of\r\nquatrefoils painted in stone-colour on the wood, outlined black, and\r\nfilled with green. The bosses of the Lantern, which are not carved,\r\nhad been evidently painted and gilt, but the patterns of foliage were\r\nrough and too much injured to afford any distinct composition.\r\n\r\nThe small amount of colouring which remained on some of the mouldings\r\nof the Octagon was principally of a bright red, but only in small\r\npatches, the ground-work having peeled off and the colour with it.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to describe briefly the recent decoration of the Octagon\r\nand Lantern we cannot do better than quote the substance of a paper\r\nread during the Conference in June, 1875, explaining the history and\r\nnature of the ornamentation which has been carried out with such\r\nloving care and artistic skill under Gambier Parry, Esq., who designed\r\nthe whole and painted the chief figures.\r\n\r\n\"The internal repair of the Lantern and Octagon was begun in February,\r\n1874, and required a year for its completion. The ornamentation is in\r\nthe style of the fourteenth century. The central boss of the lantern\r\ngroining is a half-length figure of Christ in glory, considerably\r\nabove life size, and with the conventual clouding around it; it is\r\nboldly carved in oak. The right hand is raised in the attitude of\r\nblessing, and with the left the inner garment is drawn open to exhibit\r\nthe wound in the right side. Around this figure is painted a group of\r\nSeraphim on a grey blue ground. The panels of the window hoods are\r\npainted red, marking the distinction already made by the architectural\r\nconstruction, and on them are painted Cherubim and golden stars. The\r\nwindows of the lantern were filled, some years ago, with coloured\r\nglass, the colouring of which is harsh, and in strong contrast with\r\nthe mellow and rich painting of the woodwork, and injurious to the\r\ngeneral effect.\r\n\r\n\"Below the windows are thirty-two openings surmounted with rich\r\ntracery. They are filled by panels on which is painted the angel\r\nchoir. The figures are composed in groups of four, under each window,\r\nand are represented playing mediaeval instruments. The two eastern and\r\ntwo western bays are intended to be severally grouped together,\r\nforming distinct series of eight figures. The instruments in the hands\r\nof the figures over the transepts are the psaltery and cithern, the\r\nregale, tabret, lute, violin, bagpipe and trumpet, (illustrating the\r\n150th Psalm.) Below this range of figures are smaller panels, simply\r\nornamented with the sacred monogram, the cross and the crown, resting\r\non a fine and richly carved cornice, which forms the base of the\r\nlantern. The groining of the Octagon forms eight hoods, four above the\r\nwindows, and four above the great arches of the Choir, Nave and\r\nTransepts. Beneath these last are remarkable statues of the four\r\nevangelists, about life size, seated in the attitude of writing, with\r\na pen in one hand and a long scroll in the other; a writing table by\r\nthe side of each figure with the ink horn attached to it by a strap,\r\nand a loop to hold the pen, is very complete. The space between the\r\ngreat arch and the groining of the Choir is filled with rich tracery,\r\non the central panel of which is painted the Crucifixion, with angels\r\nholding the chalice and palm branch on the right and left. The long\r\nspandrils of the groining are painted with conventional scrollwork of\r\nleaves and flowers in a style contemporaneous with the architecture.\r\nThe monogram and crown of St. Etheldreda are found in several parts of\r\nthe ornamental design. The total expense of the decoration has been\r\nabout L2500.\"\r\n\r\nAn elegantly carved pulpit has been placed near the entrance to the\r\nChoir; it is of Ancaster stone resting upon columns of Purbeck marble,\r\nthe front relieved by alabaster figures of St. Peter and St. Paul; the\r\nsteps are of Purbeck marble, guarded by very elaborate scrollwork in\r\niron. It was designed by Sir G.G. Scott, and executed by Messrs.\r\nRattee and Kett; the figures by Mr. Redfern, and the iron work by\r\nMessrs. Potter and Son. It was supplied by a legacy left by the\r\ndaughter of Bishop Allen, and adds much towards the general\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the Octagon the visitor would do well to contemplate\r\nthis portion of the building, as affording an extraordinary example of\r\nthe skill and judgment of the man who designed and carried into effect\r\nso grand and unique a specimen of architecture, covering, as it does,\r\na large area without supporting columns; no heavy mass of stone-work\r\nmeets the eye, but the pillars, though strong and of great height are\r\nso constructed as to give an appearance of lightness and elegance; the\r\nvaulting is rich though simple, and the lantern above deserves notice\r\nfrom its singular position, apparently without support, but starting\r\nas it were from the ends of the ribs of the groining: taken as a whole\r\nit may be fairly considered as without parallel in this country.\r\n\r\nThe architectural views from the Octagon in every direction are\r\nexceedingly fine, and will repay the visitor for a pause of a few\r\nminutes to notice them; on all sides are examples of great beauty and\r\nvariety. There are many other points in the Cathedral which afford\r\nattractive scenes as shewn in the effects of light and shade, the\r\nintersections of arches, perspective, &c., which may be found by the\r\nvisitor in his survey, if watched for, but we cannot undertake to\r\npoint them out.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next portion of the building to which our attention is attracted\r\nis\r\n\r\n+The Choir,+\r\n\r\nwhich, previous to 1322 was under the central Tower, and extended,\r\nincluding the rood-loft, from the second column at the eastern end of\r\nthe Nave, as it now is, (it then extended one bay further eastward,)\r\nto about the same distance, or rather more, on the opposite side; and\r\nafter the erection of the Octagon was again placed there; in 1770 it\r\nwas removed to the six eastern arches of the Cathedral, the space\r\nunder the Octagon and the two bays eastward of it being used as a\r\nsermon-place.[38] It was again removed in 1852, and now commences at\r\nthe eastern side of the Octagon, extending to the length of seven\r\nbays, (the stalled portion occupying three of them,) leaving the two\r\neastern bays as a retro-choir.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Previous to the last removal, the custom was that only\r\none sermon was preached in the morning to the congregations severally\r\nfrom the Choir, St. Mary's Church, and Holy Trinity Church, who\r\nassembled together, and occupied generally seats provided by\r\nthemselves, in the Octagon and the two bays east of it, the third\r\nbeing taken up by the screen dividing it from the Choir with the organ\r\nloft over. The sermons were usually preached by the Canon in residence\r\nat the time.]\r\n\r\nThis will be better understood by reference to the accompanying plans,\r\n(for the use of which we are indebted to the kindness of the Editor of\r\nthe \"Architectural Quarterly Review,\") one shewing the position of the\r\nChoir previous to the year 1770, and the other the arrangement made at\r\nthe last alteration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL PLAN:\r\n\r\nA Octagon, with the arrangement of Choir previous to 1770.\r\nB Presbytery.\r\nC The Nave.\r\nD North Transept.\r\nE South Transept.\r\nF Part of Cloisters (ruined.)\r\nG Western Tower.\r\nH West Porch or Galilee.\r\nI St. Catharine's Chapel.\r\nK The Lady Chapel.\r\nL The Font.\r\nM Rood Screen.\r\nN Foundations of Norman apse.\r\nO Foundations of N.W.

The screen was designed\r\nby Sir G.G. Scott, and executed by Mr. Rattee; the statuettes by M.\r\nAbeloos, and the brass gates with the foliage in the lower panels by\r\nMr. Hardman: the whole testifies highly to the taste of the designer\r\nas well as to the skill of those who executed the several parts.\r\n\r\nIn making a particular survey of the Choir, it would perhaps be better\r\nto examine carefully the architecture of the six eastern bays first,\r\nand then the three western bays, which were built subsequently to the\r\nothers, before examining the reredos, monuments, &c.; this is simply a\r\nsuggestion, we leave the visitor to follow his own inclination, and\r\ncontinue our description in the order of our course from west to east.\r\n\r\nThe architecture of the three first bays is greatly to be admired as a\r\nspecimen of the Decorated style, perhaps not surpassed by any other in\r\nthe kingdom; they were erected about the same time as the Octagon, and\r\nmost probably under the superintendence of the same skilful architect,\r\nand for which purpose Bishop Hotham left a sum of money at his death;\r\nthey were built during the episcopate of his successors, Bishops\r\nMontacute (1337-1345), and L'Isle (1345-1361). The lower columns are\r\nnearly, the capitals entirely, of the same form with those of the\r\nOctagon, but the arches are more ornamented, some of them having\r\nbosses of foliage attached to their mouldings; and those of the\r\ntriforium are, as Mr. Bentham observes, \"embellished with tracery work\r\nof such elegance and delicacy as seems scarcely consistent with\r\nstrength.\" Between each of the lower arches is a corbel or elongated\r\nbracket profusely adorned with foliage carved in high relief, richly\r\ncoloured and gilded; from this rises a column between the upper\r\narches, and from the top of this column spring the ribs of the\r\nvaulting, which spread in lavish ramifications over it, dividing it\r\ninto angular compartments, and at the angles are flowers and other\r\nornaments, curiously carved, and originally were coloured. In the\r\nspandrils of the lower and triforium arches (with the exception of the\r\nfirst bay on the south side, which contains the arms of the see, those\r\nof Bishop Hotham, and another shield), are sunk trefoils, some of\r\nwhich are painted dark blue relieved with small stars in gold, having\r\nan elegant appearance. The range of pierced parapet at the bases of\r\nthe triforium and clerestory has been entirely renewed; and on the\r\nsouth side, the triforium roof (which on both sides is of bare\r\nrafters,) has been recently painted and ornamented in a style similar\r\nto those of the Transept. The windows in the clerestory are large,\r\nfilling the whole opening, having in each four lights with rich\r\ntracery, and the same kind of trellis-work we noticed in the large\r\nwindows in the Octagon; these windows, on both sides have been\r\nrecently filled with stained glass, executed by Mr. Wailes, the\r\nexpense defrayed out of the balance of the accumulated fund for the\r\neast window; the subjects are illustrative of two verses of the \"Te\r\nDeum,\" with figures of angels and the arms of the donor, &c., in the\r\ntracery:\r\n\r\n     NORTH SIDE--\"_The noble army of Martyrs_\"--represented in\r\n     the western window by figures of St. George, St. Agnes, St.\r\n     Catharine, and St. Alban; middle window--St. Lawrence, St.\r\n     Cecilia, St. Justin, and St. Prisca; eastern window--St.\r\n     Ignatius, St. Polycarp, St. Lucian, and St. Stephen.\r\n\r\n     SOUTH SIDE--\"_The Holy Church throughout all the World_,\"\r\n     the Eastern Church being represented in the western window\r\n     by figures of St. Chrysostom, St. Basil, St. Athanasius, and\r\n     St. Gregory Nazienzen; the Western Church in the middle\r\n     window, by figures of St. Jerome, St. Ambrose, St.\r\n     Augustine, and St. Gregory the great; the British Church in\r\n     the eastern window, by figures of St. Columba, St. David,\r\n     the Venerable Bede, and St. Augustine of Canterbury.\r\n\r\nThe absence of a bishop's throne is peculiar to this Cathedral; the\r\nbishop occupies the return stall on the south side, and the dean that\r\non the north; those seats being generally appropriated to the dean and\r\nsub dean. When the abbacy was converted into a bishopric (A.D. 1109)\r\nthe bishop took the seat previously held by the abbot, the prior\r\nretaining his own; and, on the re-foundation in 1541, the dean took\r\nthe seat previously used by the priors, and here occupies\r\ntraditionally the side opposite to his customary position.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of the entrance, therefore, is the seat of the\r\nbishop, and on the left hand that of the dean, both surmounted by\r\nlofty pinnacles of tabernacle work; and the ancient stalls, formerly\r\nused under the Octagon, extend on both sides to the length of the\r\nthree western bays. These, which we believe form the sole existing\r\nspecimen of stalls of that date in England, have been cleansed from\r\ntheir coats of paint and restored, and harmonise well with the new\r\nwork: the canopies are rich and elaborate, and the panels in the upper\r\nportions have recently been filled with sculptured groups illustrative\r\nof Scripture history, those on the north side from the New, and those\r\non the south side from the Old Testament; they are beautifully\r\ndesigned, and contribute greatly to the good effect of the whole.\r\nThese sculptures have been executed in oak by M. Abeloos, of Louvain,\r\n(with one exception, \"the Nativity,\" by Mr. Philip,) and are the gifts\r\nof various benefactors. They are placed in chronological order and,\r\nas we proceed from west to east, the subjects may be noticed in the\r\npositions described as follows.\r\n\r\nNORTH SIDE.\r\n\r\nThe Annunciation.\r\nThe Salutation.\r\nThe Nativity.\r\nThe Presentation in the Temple.\r\nThe Adoration of the Magi.\r\nThe Murder of the Innocents.\r\nThe Flight into Egypt.\r\nJesus disputing with the Doctors.\r\nThe Baptism.\r\nThe Temptation.\r\nThe Miracle at Cana in Galilee.\r\nThe Transfiguration.\r\nMary anointing the Lord's feet.\r\nThe Betrayal.\r\nOur Lord before Caiaphas.\r\nJesus mocked.\r\nPilate washing his hands.\r\nJesus scourged.\r\n\"Behold the Man.\"\r\nThe Crucifixion.\r\nThe Entombment.\r\nThe Resurrection.\r\nOur Lord at Emmaus.\r\nThe incredulity of Thomas.\r\nThe Ascension.\r\n\r\nSOUTH SIDE.\r\n\r\nThe Creation of Man.\r\nThe Creation of Woman.\r\nAdam and Eve in Paradise.\r\nThe Fall of Man.\r\nThe Expulsion from Paradise.\r\nAdam and Eve at Work.\r\nCain killing Abel.\r\nNoah building the Ark.\r\nThe Deluge.\r\nNoah's Sacrifice.\r\nPromise to Abraham.\r\nIsaac carrying the wood.\r\nAbraham's Sacrifice.\r\nIsaac blessing Jacob.\r\nJacob's Dream.\r\nJoseph sold by his Brethren.\r\nThe Burning Bush.\r\nThe Passover.\r\nMoses striking the Rock.\r\nMoses raising the brazen serpent.\r\nReturn of the Spies.\r\nDavid anointed by Samuel.\r\nQueen of Sheba's visit to Solomon.\r\nJonah.\r\nElijah's ascent to Heaven.\r\n\r\nThe sub-stalls are new, and of good design; the stall-ends in the\r\nupper range have a series of statuettes of the principal among the\r\nancient benefactors, or of the builders of various portions of the\r\nchurch, each under a canopy, and for finials they have figures of\r\nangels with instruments of music. Each of the statuettes (where\r\nfinished) is represented as holding some type or model of the\r\nparticular portion with which its prototype is more intimately\r\nconnected. They were designed and modelled by Mr. J. Philip, and\r\nexecuted partly by him and partly by Mr. Rattee; we append a list of\r\nthem in the order in which they are placed, commencing from the west,\r\nas before:\r\n\r\nNORTH SIDE.\r\n\r\nSt. Etheldreda.\r\nKing Edgar.\r\nAbbot Simeon.\r\nAbbot Richard.\r\nBishop Hervey.\r\nBishop Ridel.\r\n\r\nSOUTH SIDE.\r\n\r\nBishop Alcock.\r\nAlan de Walsingham.\r\nPrior Crauden.\r\nBishop Hotham.\r\nBishop Northwold.\r\nBishop Eustachius.\r\n\r\nThe fronts of the stalls are generally of open work, shewing the\r\nhinged seats, or misereres as they are usually called, behind; in both\r\nseries of stalls these are curiously and grotesquely carved beneath.\r\nOn the faces of the stall-ends of the lower tier are various\r\nemblematical devices, crests, and shields, beautifully carved; our\r\nlist is made in the same order as of the statuettes.\r\n\r\nNORTH SIDE.\r\n\r\nCrest of Dean Peacock.\r\nCrest of the late Canon Sparke.\r\nCrest of Canon Fardell.\r\nArms of Canon Ashley.\r\nBull--emblem of St. Luke.\r\nEagle--emblem of St. John.\r\n\r\nSOUTH SIDE.\r\n\r\nArms of the See of Ely.\r\nArms of Canon Selwyn.\r\nArms of Canon Mill.\r\nPelican--ancient Church symbol.\r\nLion--emblem of St. Mark.\r\nAngel--emblem of St. Matthew.\r\n\r\nAn elegant brass lectern the gift of the late Canon Sparke, has been\r\nplaced in the Choir, as a memorial of H.S. le Strange, Esq., who\r\npainted the ceiling of the Tower and the western portion of the Nave\r\nceiling.\r\n\r\nThe organ is placed in a position differing from that of most others\r\nin England, although not unusual in Continental Cathedrals. The pedal\r\nand swell organs have been placed in the triforium on the north side,\r\nand the great organ, with the choir organ beneath it, project in front\r\nof the third bay, resting upon an over-hanging chamber behind the\r\nstalls. The organ was reconstructed, with great additions, by Messrs.\r\nHill and Son, of London, when the removal took place in 1851, and\r\nseveral important additions were made in 1867, by the same firm.[39]\r\nThe magnificent organ-case, with its sculptures, was executed by Mr.\r\nRattee; the pipes in front have been gilded and ornamented by Mr.\r\nCastell, of London, and much of the woodwork having been left in its\r\nnatural colour forms an agreeable contrast, and the effect produced,\r\nfrom almost every point of view, is rich and beautiful; while from its\r\nunusual position it loses little of its power or sweetness of tone,\r\nbut sends forth its pealing sounds reverberating through the lofty\r\narches with fine effect. We know nothing more sublime than the voices\r\nof a congregation, guided and supported by such an instrument,\r\npraising and adoring the great Creator and Father of all, and are led\r\nto exclaim with the poet Milton--\r\n\r\n     \"There let the pealing organ blow,\r\n     To the full voiced choir below,\r\n     In service high and anthems clear,\r\n     As may with sweetness through mine ear,\r\n     Dissolve me into ecstacies,\r\n     And bring all heaven before mine eyes.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: See Appendix I.]\r\n\r\nThe division between the Early English work of Bishop Northwold and\r\nthat part generally spoken of as Hotham's work is marked by two steps\r\nin the floor, and by two strong piers rising from the floor to the\r\nvault, which were in fact the original Norman shafts near the\r\ncommencement of the apse or east end taken down by Hugh de Northwold,\r\neighth bishop, who added the six beautiful eastern bays at his own\r\nexpense; these form a pure and good example of Early English work, and\r\nwere completed A.D. 1252, and dedicated in the same year, in the\r\npresence of King Henry III., and many nobles and prelates. This was\r\ncalled the \"Presbytery,\" or \"Sanctuary,\" a common name at that time\r\nfor the east end of a church.\r\n\r\n\"The character of the three western bays is singularly yet beautifully\r\narranged to harmonize, in point of elevation of its parts, with the\r\nsix eastern arches; this and the very great excellence of the details,\r\nrender this part of the edifice a most valuable study.\"[40] The\r\nabsolute contact here of the two styles, Early English and Decorated,\r\naffords the spectator an opportunity of contrasting them, and of\r\njudging of the comparative merits of each. By many, the eastern bays\r\nare preferred for their chaste and elegant appearance, not being so\r\nprofusely ornamented as those of the western ones, but, as Mr. Millers\r\nobserves, \"everything seems in its proper place and fitly\r\nproportioned: all harmonize, and taken altogether, give a general\r\ncharacter of lightness and elegance. This is nowhere more conspicuous\r\nthan in the roof; the plain ribs of which, diverging from their\r\nimposts, instead of crossing each other and spreading into intricate\r\nforms, go straight to a longitudinal midline running from west to\r\neast, and decorated with coloured figures or flowers where the\r\nspringers meet it. There is a precise line of separation between this\r\nand the more elaborate ceiling of Bishop Hotham's work; being thus\r\nbrought into contact the two may be compared with singular\r\nadvantage.\"[41]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Rickman.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: Millers' Description of Ely Cathedral, p. 74.]\r\n\r\nThe bases of the piers of the lower arches are octagonal, but the\r\nshafts are cylindrical, surrounded by slenderer detached ringed shafts\r\nwith foliated capitals, all of Purbeck marble. The triforium (except\r\nin the first and second bays on both sides,) extends over the aisles,\r\nand is lighted by large windows with Decorated tracery in the outer\r\nwall; and the arches are separated by a cluster of slender shafts into\r\ntwo smaller ones with trefoil heads; and between the two is a\r\nquatrefoil; all highly adorned with mouldings. Between each of these\r\nlower arches is an enriched corbel of Purbeck marble, adorned with\r\nfoliage in high relief, from which rises the vaulting-shaft, in a\r\ngroup of three, between the arches of the triforium to the base of the\r\nclerestory, having a capital of leafage, and from the top of which\r\nspring the ribs of the vaulting. The spandrils throughout are\r\nrelieved with trefoils and quatrefoils, deeply sunk and backed with\r\nPurbeck marble; and, on the whole, the contrast of light and shade,\r\ndepth and projection, produces a very fine effect. The clerestory\r\narches are of the same span, but each is divided into three smaller\r\nones, the centre arch being higher than those on either side, in order\r\nto admit light through the windows behind, which are three\r\nlancet-shaped lights under one arch in the outer wall, and are, we\r\nbelieve, original; these windows have been filled with stained glass,\r\nwhich is another important step towards the general improvement.\r\n\r\nThe windows of the aisles and triforium were originally three\r\nlancet-shaped lights under one arch, but were replaced in the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries by larger windows of a flamboyant\r\ncharacter. In the first and second bays on both sides the triforium\r\nwindows are placed in the inner wall, probably to give more light to\r\nthe high altar, the position of which was indicated by a boss in the\r\nceiling with a figure of St. Peter; and also to give greater effect to\r\nthe rich and gorgeous shrine of St. Etheldreda, said to have been of\r\npure silver adorned with jewels, which at that period stood near the\r\naltar and to her place of sepultre, indicated by a boss in the ceiling\r\nwith her effigy on it. The tracery in these windows bears a similarity\r\nto those in the corresponding arches of Hotham's work, but is not so\r\nornamented. All have been filled with stained glass by Mr. Wailes, the\r\nexpense defrayed out of the east window fund:\r\n\r\n     The western window on the north side--The descent of the\r\n     Holy Ghost, with figures and emblems.\r\n\r\n     The eastern window--The Ascension, with figures, &c.\r\n\r\n     The western window on the south side--Incidents from the\r\n     history of Moses, with figures, &c.\r\n\r\n     The eastern window--Incidents from the history of Elijah,\r\n     with devices, &c.\r\n\r\n\"The east end,\" says Mr. Millers, \"is eminently beautiful, and will\r\nnot by any means shrink from comparison with the more gorgeous\r\ntermination of any church built after great end windows came into\r\nfashion. There are two tiers of lights; the lower consists of three\r\nvery high lancet-shaped lights, nearly all equal; the second of five,\r\nthe middle one being higher, and those on the sides gradually\r\nlower.\"[42] They are enriched by slender columns, with leafy capitals,\r\nand ornamented with toothed and other mouldings, presenting altogether\r\nmore gracefulness and elegance than one large window filling nearly\r\nthe whole end. In the last century Bishop Mawson had formed a design\r\nof filling this window (for it is generally considered as one window\r\nof eight lights,) with stained glass, and selected an artist to carry\r\nit into effect; the work, however, was not then finished; a figure of\r\nSt. Peter, and the arms of the bishop and contemporary members of the\r\nChapter, are the only remains of it known to be in existence, and\r\nthese were lately removed from the centre lancet and placed in the\r\neast window of the north triforium of the Nave. The window has at\r\nlength been completed by the liberality of Bishop Sparke, who gave in\r\nhis lifetime a large sum for that purpose.[43] The bishop died some\r\nfew years after making his munificent donation, and his two sons, Rev.\r\nJ.H. Sparke and Rev. E.B. Sparke, then Canons of the cathedral, as\r\nTrustees of the fund, took steps to carry his wishes into effect.\r\nSeveral designs were prepared, and one by Mr. Wailes was selected, but\r\nthe execution was deferred for some years in order that advantage\r\nmight be taken of further experience, and thus, if possible, to\r\nrealize some of those gorgeous effects which have made the thirteenth\r\ncentury windows of Canterbury, Chartres, Bourges, and elsewhere, so\r\njustly celebrated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Millers' Description of Ely Cathedral, p. 76.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: See note p. 53.]\r\n\r\nThe eastern lancets were executed by Mr. Wailes in 1857, and the\r\nrepresentatives of the donor have good reason to be satisfied with the\r\nresult. The general effect produced is magnificent; the three lower\r\nlancets in particular present that happy combination of sparkling\r\nbrilliancy with that somewhat mysterious indefiniteness in the\r\ndistribution of colour which is so well suited to the architectural\r\neffect. It is sufficient to compare the present window with others in\r\nthe Cathedral, not excluding the productions of Mr. Wailes himself, to\r\nshew the great advance which the art of glass-painting has recently\r\nmade, both in the richness of the colours employed and their\r\narrangement--the improvement arising, doubtless, from a more accurate\r\nstudy of the great masters of the middle ages.\r\n\r\nThe figures and groups in the three noble lancets are executed with\r\ngreat spirit; and although numerous, are arranged, more especially in\r\nthe central window, in masses which the eye can readily follow, and by\r\noccupying so large a portion of the entire surface, leave little room\r\nfor the monotonous repetitions of foliage or other patterns; the\r\ndistribution of colour is also thus sufficiently varied without its\r\nmasses in one part of the window unduly preponderating over those in\r\nanother, a condition which is never grossly violated without serious\r\ninjury to just architectural effect.\r\n\r\nIn the central window of the clerestory range, the spaces between the\r\nmedallions and the border are filled with a diapered ground, which,\r\nthough rich in colour, is somewhat formal in effect; whilst the field\r\nin the side windows, within the border, is too narrow to allow the\r\nfigures to be sufficiently separated and relieved from the rest of the\r\nground. It arises, probably, from these or other causes that the\r\ngeneral effect which the upper lancets produce, though otherwise good,\r\nis by no means so rich and sparkling as that of the lower windows.\r\n\r\n     The subjects of the three lower lights are illustrative of\r\n     the history of our blessed Lord; commencing at the bottom of\r\n     the south lancet--where is represented a figure of Jesse,\r\n     from whose body issues a genealogical tree--and continuing\r\n     in ascending order, through a series of nine medallions,\r\n     following in the same manner through a similar number in\r\n     the north lancet, and five others in the central lancet;\r\n     alternately with these five are quatrefoils containing\r\n     representation of types from the Old Testament of the events\r\n     of the Passion represented in the other medallions; and in\r\n     the segmental spaces round these quatrefoils are represented\r\n     eighteen other incidents of the last days of the Saviour. In\r\n     the segmental spaces in the south lancet the figures of the\r\n     kings are disposed in pairs; and in the north lancet these\r\n     spaces are filled with the figures of Moses, Elias, and the\r\n     prophets; and at the bottom a kneeling figure of the donor.\r\n     The five upper windows, two on the north and two on the\r\n     south, contain figures of the apostles; at the top of the\r\n     central window our Lord is represented as sitting in glory,\r\n     beneath which are depicted four incidents which occurred\r\n     after the Crucifixion.\r\n\r\nThe floor of the Choir has been re-laid with marble combined with\r\nMinton's encaustic tiles, and a large marble slab has been placed over\r\nthe grave of Bishop Hotham, inlaid with brass and bearing the arms of\r\nthe see and those of the bishop, surrounded by an inscription. At the\r\nfoot of this another has been laid over the grave of Prior Crauden,\r\nsuperior of the monastery at the time of the erection of the Octagon;\r\nthis is the original gravestone of the prior, but it had been removed\r\nwith several others to another part of the church; the brass insertion\r\nhas been renewed, shewing a kneeling figure with a large foliated\r\ncross issuing from his bosom, with the initials I.C. on either side,\r\nand surrounded by an inscription.\r\n\r\nIn the wide treading of one of the steps at the end of the stalled\r\nchoir are placed the arms of some of the benefactors to the\r\nrestoration of the Cathedral;[44] executed by Messrs. Minton. In the\r\nPresbytery, where the absence of stall-work allows space for more\r\nelaborate design, it will be seen much care and skill has been used,\r\nand the effect produced is very good. The communion table is raised\r\nfive steps above the level of the floor, each step being laid in\r\nmosaic and encaustic tiles of beautiful and varied patterns, used in\r\nconjunction with veined, and faced with black, marble.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: In the centre are the arms of the Duke of Bedford; on\r\nthe south side those of Alexander Beresford Hope, Esq., and the Rev.\r\nT. Halford; on the north those of J. Dunn Gardner, Esq., and J.C.\r\nSharpe, Esq.]\r\n\r\nThe new reredos or altar screen is remarkable for its chaste but\r\nelaborate design and richness of detail, as well as skill in\r\nexecution; and is not, perhaps, surpassed by any modern work of the\r\nkind; our limited space will not allow us to attempt anything like an\r\nadequate description of this beautiful work, but we will endeavour\r\nbriefly to point out the prominent features, and recommend to the\r\nvisitor a careful examination of its various details.\r\n\r\nIt comprises a centre with wings, having openings with geometrical\r\ntracery and foliated mouldings, surmounted by an elegant cresting. The\r\nfront of the central portion is of the most beautiful design, executed\r\nin alabaster, enriched with colour and gilding, and will doubtless\r\nclaim the first attention of the visitor. The sides of the space\r\noccupied by the altar is covered with diaper work exhibiting a series\r\nof roses, apparently connected together by their stems running through\r\nthe pattern under the bars of the diaper-work; above this, the whole\r\nwidth is divided into five compartments--the centre one being wider\r\nthan the others--separated by enriched columns, around which are\r\nspiral belts with cornelians and blood-stones on a gold ground, and\r\nhaving elegant foliated capitals, copied from natural objects; on\r\nthese capitals stand a series of angels bearing instruments of the\r\npassion--cross, crown of thorns, nails, spear, &c., and each having\r\nunder his feet a dragon or other reptile, typical of the triumph over\r\nSatan by the Sacrifice of the Atonement. The lower part of each\r\ncompartment is occupied by quatrefoils ornamented with ball-flowers,\r\nand filled in with mosaic work of _verd antique_, _rosso antico_,\r\n_gialo antico_, and _lapis lazuli_: above these are panels containing\r\nalto-relievo sculptures of great excellence, the subjects taken from\r\nthe life of the Saviour; beginning on the north side, we find Christ's\r\nentry into Jerusalem, Christ washing His disciples' feet, the\r\nInstitution of the Sacrament, Christ's agony in the Garden, and Christ\r\nbearing His cross: another series of spiral pillars stand in the front\r\nand on the sides of these panels with capitals similar to those\r\nalready mentioned. These pillars have their spiral course in the\r\nopposite direction to the former, which adds to the general beauty of\r\nthe whole. Above the sculptured panels, each of the four side\r\ncompartments is surmounted by two small gables with their outer\r\nmouldings foliated, crowned with a finial, and finished at the bottom\r\nby a grotesque figure of a dragon or other animal; the inner face of\r\neach gable contains within a circle a head in bas-relief, those on the\r\nnorth side representing the major prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel,\r\nand Daniel; those on the south represent four doctors of the church,\r\nJerome, Ambrose, Augustine, and Gregory; the other portions being\r\nfilled in with mosaic work. The centre compartment has three\r\nprojecting canopies, the faces of which are enriched with mosaic, the\r\nangles are crocketed, and finished at the bottom with roses and\r\ngrotesque figures. Above the centre canopy, on a lofty enriched\r\npinnacle, stands a figure of our Lord; on the north side, on a lower\r\npinnacle, stands a figure of Moses; and on the south side a figure of\r\nElias, the three being typical of the Transfiguration.\r\n\r\nThe upper portion of the white stone screen behind the alabaster work\r\nis also divided into five compartments of open work with geometrical\r\ntracery; in front rise five gables, the centre being larger and higher\r\nthan the others. The outer mouldings of the centre gable are enriched\r\nwith foliated crocketing with which is intermixed the early church\r\nsymbol--pelican feeding her young--and the apex surmounted by a figure\r\nof our Lord enthroned: the inner portion of the gable contains, in a\r\ntrefoil, a basso-relievo of the Annunciation, in alabaster. The four\r\nside compartments are also surmounted by gables, on the top of which\r\nstand respectively the figures of the four Evangelists, in alabaster,\r\ntheir respective emblems being worked in the crockets; on the inner\r\nfaces of the gables, within trefoils, are busts in relief, those on\r\nthe north side represent Mary Magdelene and Mary the mother of James;\r\nthose on the south, St. John the Baptist and St. John the divine; the\r\nremaining space in each gable being filled in with mosaic. Outside and\r\nbetween these gables rise spiral pillars, on the tops of which are\r\nplaced figures of the virtues, Faith, Hope, and Charity, on the north\r\nside; and of the graces, Justice, Prudence, and Fortitude, on the\r\nsouth side, executed in alabaster.\r\n\r\nThe wings also are of white stone, and not so high as the centre; in\r\neach are three openings with geometrical tracery; and below these\r\nopenings the wall is covered with diaper-work of an elegant pattern.\r\n\r\nThe portion of this screen, which forms the reredos, is the munificent\r\ngift of John Dunn Gardner, Esq., of Chatteris, in this county, and\r\ndesigned as a memorial to his first wife. The work took upwards of\r\nfive years to execute, and cost about L4000. Some of the more\r\nimportant of the sculptures, mosaics, and other decorations, were\r\nsuggested by the donor, and the whole was designed by Sir G.G. Scott,\r\nand affords a magnificent example of his skill and taste. The\r\nstone-work, including the architectural carving, was executed by Mr.\r\nRattee and his successors, at Cambridge; the sculptures by Mr. Philip;\r\nthe mosaics by Mr. Field; and the gilding and painting by Mr. Hudson.\r\n\r\nThe Reredos was expressly designed with reference to a painted window\r\nplaced behind it: it is hardly necessary to say that it is greatly\r\nbenefitted by the general reduction of the glare of light, which\r\nrendered the outlines of much of the statuary and more delicate\r\nornaments undistinguishable at a distance, but still more by the\r\ntransmission through it of glimpses of the most beautiful colours,\r\nwhich change with every movement, however slight, in the position of\r\nthe eye, and whose very indistinctness and transitory character\r\ncontributes not a little to the effect which they tend to produce on\r\nthe mind.\r\n\r\nThe altar being raised above the level of the floor shews to advantage\r\nthe magnificent altar cloth, which is of rich crimson velvet,\r\nembroidered with much taste and skill by Miss Agnes and Miss Ellen\r\nBlencowe, and is thought to be worthy of the best ages of Mediaeval\r\nembroidery. \"Its length is divided into three parts; the middle\r\ncontaining a very beautiful figure of our Lord as risen, contained\r\nwithin a pointed aureole of a deep blue colour, and bordered by\r\nradiating beams. Broad orphreys embroidered in flowers divide the\r\nmiddle compartment from the sides, which are of red velvet powdered\r\nwith conventional flowers;\"[45] the largest were copied from ancient\r\nexamples at East Langdon, Kent, and the others from Ottery,\r\nSomersetshire. The following passage is worked in gold on the\r\nsuper-frontal:--\r\n\r\n     [Maltese cross symbol] \"+Agnus Dei qui tollis peccata mundi\r\n     dona nobis pacem. Agnus Dei, miserere nobis.+\"[46] [Maltese\r\n     cross symbol]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: Ecclesiologist.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: \"O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world,\r\ngrant us Thy peace. Lamb of God, have mercy upon us.\"]\r\n\r\nWe now direct our attention to the monuments in the Choir, and\r\ncommence with the first arch on the south side of the Presbytery which\r\nis occupied by the once gorgeous monument of Bishop de Luda, or Louth\r\n(1290-1298), it consists of a lofty central arch with smaller openings\r\non the sides; above the arches are enriched gables with pinnacles and\r\nfinials; over the centre arch in a trefoil is a figure of the Saviour;\r\nthe restoration of the north side of this monument will afford some\r\nidea of its original appearance; the effect has been somewhat subdued\r\nby the softened light from the east window. The indent in the\r\ngravestone under the arch leaves no doubt of its having been once\r\nfinished with a brass effigy.\r\n\r\nThe next arch contains the tomb of Bishop Barnet (1366-1373); it is of\r\nPurbeck marble, with quatrefoils on the sides, and had originally the\r\neffigy of the bishop engraved in brass on the table of the tomb.\r\n\r\nUnder the third arch is the high monument of John Tiptoft, earl of\r\nWorcester, one of the patrons of Caxton, the first English printer;\r\nthis is in the Perpendicular style, but less beautiful than that of\r\nBishop Redman, on the opposite side: on the table of the tomb are the\r\neffigies of the earl and his two wives; the two latter only were\r\nburied here, the earl having been beheaded and buried in London in\r\n1470.\r\n\r\nThe tomb of Bishop Hotham (1316-1337) has been partially restored and\r\nplaced in the next arch, on the south side of the altar; it formerly\r\nstood under a high canopy on the north side, but originally in the\r\nfirst arch of his own work. There was probably a recumbent figure on\r\nthe top, but it has long since disappeared.\r\n\r\nOpposite to this, on the north side of the altar, on a base of Purbeck\r\nmarble, are placed the interesting remains of the tomb of Bishop\r\nNorthwold (1229-1254), the munificent founder of the Presbytery, which\r\nwere originally placed over his grave in the centre of his own work.\r\nIt is a large slab of Purbeck marble, highly adorned with carving;\r\nperhaps one of the finest specimens of its period: the effigy of the\r\nprelate is represented as resting beneath a cinquefoil canopy in his\r\nrobes, bearing his crosier, with a lion and dragon under his feet;\r\nbeneath this is a representation of the martyrdom of St. Edmund, a\r\nprince of East Anglia, by the Danes, commemorative of his having been\r\nlord abbot of Bury before he was preferred to the see of Ely; the\r\nniches in the sides of the prelate's stall have statuettes--on the\r\nleft, St. Etheldreda, an abbess crowned, and a nun; on the right, a\r\nking, an abbot, and a monk: at the top on each side of the head are\r\nangels with censers, and other symbolical figures.\r\n\r\nThe monument or shrine which was formerly placed over the tomb of\r\nBishop Hotham, has been in part restored, and now occupies the third\r\narch on the north side. This, with the tomb now on the south side of\r\nthe altar under it, originally stood in the first arch of his own\r\nwork, near his place of sepultre; it is in the Decorated style, and\r\nwas richly coloured and gilded. Part of it was cut away in order to\r\nmake room for the stalls when the choir occupied the six eastern\r\narches, but this has been rebuilt. This is now thought to have been\r\npart of the sub-structure of the shrine of St. Etheldreda, as adapted\r\nby Alan de Walsingham.\r\n\r\nThe second arch from the west, is occupied by the tomb of Bishop\r\nKilkenny (1254-1256,) who died at Sugho, in Spain, while on an embassy\r\nto the Spanish Court; his body was buried there, his heart being only\r\ninterred here. The tomb is of Purbeck marble, and is a fine example of\r\nthe Early English style. The bishop is represented as in the act of\r\nbenediction, with a pastoral staff, and in full pontificals; his head\r\nis shown as resting on a cushion, and is surmounted by a trefoil arch\r\nwith a crocketed gable, and a censer-bearing angel on each side.\r\n\r\nIn the next, or more western arch, is the beautiful monument of Bishop\r\nRedman (1501-1505). It is a fine specimen of the Perpendicular Style,\r\nand is richly ornamented with niches and canopies, and a variety of\r\nshields with arms, and emblems of the passion; the effigy of the\r\nbishop is recumbent on a high tomb under a rich canopy, with a space\r\nleft at the foot for a chantry priest. Passing through this space we\r\nenter the\r\n\r\n+North Aisle of the Choir,+\r\n\r\nand first proceeding towards the western end of it, we notice the new\r\nback screens which have been erected to mask the stall work in two of\r\nthe bays, and against which have been placed the monuments of Bishop\r\nFleetwood (1714-1723), and of his son Dr. Charles Fleetwood (1737);\r\nthe third bay is occupied by the new and elegant staircase to the\r\norgan; it is of open work, richly carved, with foliated mouldings and\r\nornaments.\r\n\r\nOpposite to this, in the north wall, is a beautiful door-arch,\r\nformerly the means of communication with the Lady Chapel; it has\r\nstatues in large niches on each side, many smaller niches, crockets,\r\nand finials, and over the keystone a sitting figure; the mouldings and\r\nornaments were originally beautified by colours and gilding, but all\r\nare injured and defaced, and the figures have disappeared.\r\n\r\nA little further eastward is the memorial brass laid over the grave of\r\nMr. Bassevi, the eminent architect of the Fitzwilliam Museum at\r\nCambridge, who was accidentally killed by a fall in the western Tower\r\nin 1845.\r\n\r\nThe monuments of Bishop Redman and Kilkenny, which we noticed in our\r\nsurvey of the Choir, are in their original places; and we now pass in\r\nsuccession those of Bishops Patrick (1691-1707), Mawson (1754-1770),\r\nand Laney (1667-1675). In 1770 many monuments were removed from the\r\nPresbytery to make room for the Choir, and a few were again removed\r\nfor the purpose of carrying out the recent arrangements. In the last\r\nbay but one (now opening to the Retro-Choir) stood the monument of\r\nBishop Gray (1454-1478), but the gravestone only remains, from which\r\nthe brass has been removed. The arms of this prelate may be observed\r\nin the sides of three of the windows of this aisle, no doubt altered\r\nby him to their present form.\r\n\r\n     The first or western window of the Presbytery has been\r\n     filled with stained glass executed by M. Lusson, of Paris,\r\n     illustrative of the history of St. John the Baptist; the\r\n     gift of the Rev. Chancellor Sparke.\r\n\r\n     The second window, executed by Messrs. Clayton and Bell,\r\n     contains subjects illustrative of the miracles; designed as\r\n     a memorial of the Rev. J.H. Sparke, many years Canon of the\r\n     Cathedral, and Chancellor of the Diocese.\r\n\r\n     The third window, by the same artist, also contains subjects\r\n     illustrative of the miracles; designed as a memorial of\r\n     Agneta, widow of Chancellor Sparke.\r\n\r\n     The fourth window, executed by Mr. Hughes, contains subjects\r\n     from the parables--the wheat and tares, the vineyard, and\r\n     the lost sheep; and the miraculous draught of fishes,\r\n     designed as a memorial of Eliza, widow of Canon Fardell.\r\n\r\n     The fifth window, executed by Mr. Ward, contains in the two\r\n     western lights subjects from the parable of the ten virgins;\r\n     and in the others illustrations of the passage in Matt. XXV.\r\n     35, 36. \"I was an hungered and ye gave me meat,\" &c.;\r\n     designed as a memorial of Rev. H. Fardell, Canon of Ely.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this aisle, occupying the space of one bay, is the\r\n+Chapel of Bishop Alcock+, (1486-1500), who was comptroller of works\r\nunder Henry VII., and founder of Jesus College, Cambridge. The chapel\r\nis in the Perpendicular style, and was built A.D. 1488, as appears\r\nfrom a stone found underground some years ago, and inserted in the\r\nwall under the east window, bearing the following inscription,\r\nscarcely legible:\r\n\r\n     \"+Johanes Alkoc epus Eliesis hanc fabrica fieri fecit.\r\n     M.cccclxxxviii.+\"\r\n\r\nThe ornamental portion is curiously executed, but the pinnacles are\r\ndisproportioned and crowded, presenting a confused and heavy\r\nappearance; the vaulted ceiling is rich and elaborate, with a large\r\npendent of curious workmanship in the centre. The principal entrance\r\nis on the west, but there is a door on the south side; and the\r\nbishop's tomb is on the north side with a window behind containing\r\nsome fragments of stained glass. It is probable from its appearance\r\nthat the monument contained two effigies, one representing the bishop\r\nin his pontifical robes and another on a higher ledge, which\r\nrepresented a body in a state of decay, as contrasting life and death.\r\nA carved oak door at the foot of the monument appears as an entrance\r\nto a chantry, or as by some supposed to have been a confessional. The\r\nbishop was buried in the centre of the chapel; his favorite device--a\r\nrebus of his name--a cock standing on a globe, and his arms may be\r\nseen in the window and in several other places. The chapel has been\r\nmuch defaced and many figures and ornaments have disappeared, but\r\nsomething has been done towards restoration at the cost of the Master\r\nand Fellows of Jesus College; the new portion of the floor was laid at\r\nthe cost of the Rev. Lord Aylwyne Compton; and we hope ere long to see\r\nthe east window filled with stained glass, which will contribute much\r\nto its improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n+The Retro-Choir.+\r\n\r\nThis occupies the space of the two eastern bays of the Cathedral,\r\nallowing a passage behind the altar-screen from one aisle to the\r\nother, and affords a good position for a closer inspection of the\r\nlower portions of the east window, under which are some remains of\r\nancient decoration on the wall.\r\n\r\nNearly under the central window, a memorial brass has been laid over\r\nthe grave of Canon Fardell, who died in 1854, and of his widow, who\r\ndied in 1861; to whose memories respectively the two stained glass\r\nwindows were inserted in the north aisle of the Choir, noticed in p.\r\n79. Near this stands an ancient oaken chest, covered with elaborate\r\nand curious ironwork, with four locks.\r\n\r\nBehind the new altar-screen, beneath a large and costly slab of\r\nAlexandrine mosaic, is the grave of Bishop Allen (1836-1845), to whose\r\nmemory a monument in white marble has been erected in the south aisle\r\nof the Choir. A little further southward is a monument erected over\r\nthe grave of Dr. Mill, Canon of Ely, and Regius Professor of Hebrew in\r\nthe University of Cambridge, who died in 1853. It is an altar tomb of\r\nserpentine and alabaster, ornamented with marble mosaic and polished\r\nstones, bearing a recumbent effigy of Dr. Mill in his robes; at the\r\nfeet are two kneeling figures, one an oriental character, and the\r\nother a student; the figure is in copper and was formed by the\r\nelectrotype process. It was designed by Sir G.G. Scott, and executed\r\nby Mr. Philip.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern bay on the south side is a monument of Cardinal de\r\nLuxemburg, Archbishop of Rouen, and Bishop of Ely (1438-1443). This\r\nmonument was for many years hidden by a screen, but on the removal of\r\nthe Choir the screen was taken away and the monument partially\r\nrestored, the figure remains but the head is gone. The Cardinal-bishop\r\ndied at Hatfield, and his body was buried at Ely, but his heart was\r\nconveyed to his Cathedral at Rouen. The niches and canopies with their\r\nfinials in the tympanum of the arch above this monument will attract\r\nattention, being chaste and elegant; they are similar to those in the\r\ninterior of Bishop West's chapel, but are in a more perfect state.\r\n\r\n\r\n+South Aisle of the Choir.+\r\n\r\nThe eastern portion of this aisle is occupied by the elegant mortuary\r\n+Chapel of Bishop West+, (1515-1534), filling the space of one bay in\r\na similar way to that of Bishop Alcock in the north aisle. It is a\r\nrich specimen of that gorgeous style by some called the \"Florid\r\nEnglish,\" by others the \"Perpendicular,\" but when that style was\r\nverging into \"Renaissance.\" The niches and canopies are very numerous,\r\nand almost endless in variety of size, shape, and decoration. There\r\nare places for upwards of two hundred statues, large and small; and\r\nsome of the carved heads were of medallion size, and well executed. It\r\nis impossible to contemplate this beautiful oratory, even in its\r\nmutilated state, but with feelings of admiration; the taste of the\r\ndesigner, no less than the execution of the sculptor, are wonderful,\r\nand although every part is covered with niches, pedestals, and\r\ncanopies, interspersed with relievos, grotesque designs and ornaments,\r\nthe whole appears light and airy. The ceilings of the canopies are\r\ncovered with tracery that can only be compared to lace-work\r\nexquisitely varied and finished; the ceiling and pendents are\r\ndeserving attention; the former is divided into lozenge shaped\r\ncompartments of different sizes, all are coloured, and on many of them\r\nare painted the arms of the see, and those of the founder of the\r\nchapel; the pendents are formed by figures of angels holding the same\r\narms and those of Henry VIII. Over the door on the inside is this\r\ninscription:\r\n\r\n     \"GRACIA DEI SUM QUOD ID SUM, A.D. 1534.\"\r\n\r\nand the same without the date and the word \"id\" is to be seen in\r\nseveral other places both within and without. The gates are worthy of\r\nnotice as originals, and as specimens of wrought-iron work of that\r\nperiod. This chapel, which is the burial place of Bishop West, may be\r\ncompared with that built by him in the parish church of his\r\nbirth-place, Putney; but every part of it has suffered the most\r\nbarbarous mutilation, not a figure can be found perfect, all have been\r\nremoved or defaced, probably in consequence of an order in council\r\nmade A.D. 1547-8, against the Romish superstition, and for removing\r\nimages out of churches; or it might have been done by the Puritans in\r\nthe time of the Protector (Cromwell), whose soldiers it is stated,\r\nmade use of the Cathedral as stabling for their horses.\r\n\r\nBishop Keene (1771-1781), was also buried here; and Bishop Sparke\r\n(1812-1836) and Mrs. Sparke were interred in this chapel, to whose\r\nmemories the monument at the east end has been erected, and the\r\nstained glass window behind is inserted:\r\n\r\n     The window was executed by Mr. Evans, of Shrewsbury, and\r\n     contains figures of the four Evangelists, with St. John the\r\n     Baptist in the centre; the tracery being filled with\r\n     appropriate emblems and ornamental devices.\r\n\r\nA slab of black marble, inlaid with a foliated cross, the arms of the\r\nsees of Chester and Ely, and surrounded by an inscription in brass,\r\nhas been laid over the grave of Bishop Sparke, and the gravestones of\r\nBishops West and Keene have been replaced, and the remainder of the\r\nfloor laid with encaustic tiles.\r\n\r\nSome fragments of stained glass may be seen in a window on the south\r\nside, under which stand the remains of Bishop West's monument. Just\r\nabove this, in seven small arches, closed with as many stones\r\ninscribed with names and dates, are immured the remains of seven\r\neminent persons[47] of the tenth and eleventh centuries, who were\r\noriginally interred in the Conventual church, but from which they were\r\nremoved in 1154, and the small chests which contained their remains,\r\nwere placed in the north wall of the Choir of the present Cathedral;\r\nand when the position of the Choir was altered in 1770 they were again\r\nremoved, and deposited in their present resting places.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: Wolstan, Archbishop of York; Osmund, a Swedish bishop;\r\nEdnoth, Bishop of Dorchester (Lincoln); Alfwyn, Elfgar, and Athelstan,\r\nseverally Bishops of Elmham; and Brithnoth, Duke of Northumberland. An\r\ninteresting account of the removal of these remains may be found in\r\nthe Addenda to Bentham's History, vol. ii. p. 23, &c.]\r\n\r\nThe perspective view westward through the south aisles of the Choir\r\nand the Nave is worthy of notice for the various intersections of the\r\narches and groinings, as seen from a narrow window in the west side of\r\nthe chapel, or from the door.\r\n\r\nThe architecture of the south aisle is similar to the north aisle, and\r\nthe windows were probably altered to their present form about the same\r\nperiod as those in the north aisle. Five of them (as on the other\r\nside) have been filled with stained glass:\r\n\r\n     The first window from the chapel, executed by Messrs.\r\n     Clayton and Bell, contains subjects taken from the Parables;\r\n     designed as a memorial of Astley Sparke, Esq., (son of the\r\n     Rev. Chancellor Sparke,) who was killed in the celebrated\r\n     cavalry charge at Balaclava in 1854.\r\n\r\n     The second window was executed by Mr. Cottingham, and\r\n     contains subjects from the history of Lazarus; the joint\r\n     gift of Lady Buxton and of her son, Sir Robert Buxton,\r\n     Bart., of Shadwell Park, Norfolk.\r\n\r\n     The third window contains incidents in the history of the\r\n     Saviour, and of St. John; executed by Messrs. Clayton and\r\n     Bell: the gift of Mrs. Pratt, youngest daughter of Bishop\r\n     Sparke.\r\n\r\n     The fourth window, by the same artists, contains subjects\r\n     illustrative of the history of St. Peter; the gift of the\r\n     same lady, as a memorial of her husband, Colonel Pratt.\r\n\r\n     The fifth window, by the same artists, contains subjects\r\n     illustrative of the history of our Lord: given by the same\r\n     lady.\r\n\r\nUnder the second window from the chapel is an arched recess, which is\r\nthought to have formed an entrance to the church for the convenience\r\nof the sisters and others attendant on the sick in the Infirmary which\r\nstood near, but it has been closed on the exterior for many years. The\r\ninterior may have been since used as a receptacle for relics; now it\r\nis occupied as a receptacle for a beautiful life-size effigy of Dr.\r\nSelwyn, for upwards of forty years Canon of Ely, and for many years St\r\nMargaret Professor of Divinity at Cambridge;[48] who died in 1875. The\r\nfigure is represented as vested in cassock, surplice, and stole, with\r\nthe hands joined as in prayer, in white statuary marble, and resting\r\non a moulded base of Purbeck marble. The cost was defrayed by\r\nsubscriptions from several noblemen and gentlemen formerly Eton\r\nscholars.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: The Professor left the sum of L10,000 towards the\r\nerection of Divinity Schools in connection with the University of\r\nCambridge, which have just been completed.]\r\n\r\nNear this we may notice an ancient gravestone, or part of a monument\r\nfound under the floor of the nave in St. Mary's Church, in 1829. It\r\nrepresents an angel with wings raised above the head, bearing a small\r\nnaked figure, probably representing the soul of a bishop, as a crozier\r\nappears at the side; the angel has on a kind of cope with an\r\nornamental border; and around the head is a large circular aureole,\r\nand the canopy shows a mass of buildings with semicircular arches.\r\nThere is an inscription on the rim, \"_St. Michael oret p' me_.\" To\r\nwhose memory it was executed it is impossible to say, but it is\r\ndoubtless of great interest.\r\n\r\nA good view of the organ may be had from this aisle by looking over\r\nthe tomb in the fourth bay from the chapel.\r\n\r\nSeveral other monuments to former prelates of the church, and to other\r\npersons, may be observed in this aisle: one to Bishop Gunning\r\n(1675-1684), worthy of remembrance as the author of the \"Prayer for\r\nall sorts and conditions of men.\" Near the foot of this monument is a\r\npiscina in the wall. A little further we find one to Bishop Heton\r\n(1600-1609), occupying the fifth bay, and is perhaps the only instance\r\nsince the Reformation, of the effigy of a bishop in a cope ornamented\r\nwith saints; the figures on the left border are those of St.\r\nBartholomew, St. Matthias, St. Andrew, St. Peter, and St. John.\r\n\r\nBefore passing on to the few remaining monuments we will notice the\r\nonly two specimens of ancient memorial brasses, of which there were\r\nmany in the Cathedral, as appears by the numerous incised stones in\r\ndifferent parts of the church, many of them were evidently of a rich\r\nand elaborate character, but all, with the above exception, have\r\ndisappeared by the act of the mercenary or the fanatic. The first is a\r\nmemorial to Bishop Goodrich (1534-1554), a singular instance of a hot\r\nreformer commemorated by a brass in which are pourtrayed all the\r\necclesiastical vestments, he holds his crozier in his left hand, and\r\nin his right he carries a Bible from which depends the great seal of\r\nEngland, the bishop having been appointed Lord High Chancellor in\r\n1551; the inscription has been removed. The other is in memory of\r\nHumphrey Tyndall, fourth dean of the Cathedral (1591-1614), who is\r\nrepresented in his robes, with a square-cut beard; an inscription is\r\nengraved in the border, and the following lines beneath the feet of\r\nthe effigy:\r\n\r\n     \"THE BODY OF THE WOORTHY & REVERENDE PRELATE\r\n     VMPHRY TYNDALL, DOCTOR OF DIVINITY, THE FOVRTH DEAN\r\n     OF THIS CHVRCH, AND MASTER OF QVEENES COLLEDGE IN\r\n     CAMBRIDGE DOTH HERE EXPECT THE COMING OF OVR SAVIOVR.\r\n\r\n     \"In presence, gouerment, good actions and in birth,\r\n     Graue, wise, couragious, Noble was this earth,\r\n     The poor, the church, the colledge saye here lyes\r\n     'A friende, A Deane, A maister, true, good, wise.'\"\r\n\r\nWe have now an opportunity of noticing the piers which separate Bishop\r\nNorthwold's work from that of Bishop Hotham; \"they are,\" as Mr.\r\nMillers observes, \"a combination of the two sorts of column severally\r\nin use at the respective times at which the two fabrics were erected;\r\nthe east side has the small shafts distinct from the main column, and\r\nthe west side is clustered, and where they meet is a niche for a\r\nstatue.\"[49] In the niche on this side is a tablet to the memory of\r\nthe Rev. James Bentham, Canon of Ely, and author of \"The History and\r\nAntiquities of Ely Cathedral,\" a work of acknowledged merit, the\r\nresult of many years' labour and research. He died in 1794, aged 86.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: Millers' Description of Ely Cathedral, p. 89.]\r\n\r\nThe monument to Robert Steward, Esq., who died A.D. 1570, is next in\r\nour route, and beyond that one to Sir Mark Steward, who died A.D.\r\n1603, both examples of no particular style. In the last bay is the\r\nmonument erected to the memory of Bishop Allen, whose gravestone we\r\nnoticed in passing the retro-choir; on the table of the monument is a\r\nreclining figure of the prelate in his robes, in white marble,\r\nconsidered to be a good likeness.\r\n\r\nBack-screens to mask the stalls, similar to those in the north aisle,\r\nhave been erected on this side, against which have been placed the\r\nmonuments of Bishop Moore (1707-1714), Bishop Butts (1738-1748), and\r\nBishop Greene (1723-1738). On the pillar between the two last is a\r\ntablet to the memory of William Lynne, gentleman, of Bassingbourne,\r\nthe first husband of Elizabeth, daughter of William Steward, of Ely,\r\nand afterwards mother of Oliver Cromwell.\r\n\r\nThe new screens with gates at the western end of the aisles are worthy\r\nof notice as specimens of modern work in wrought iron; they were\r\nexecuted by Mr. Skidmore, of Coventry, from designs by Sir G.G. Scott.\r\nThat in the south aisle was given by G.A. Lowndes, Esq., of Barrington\r\nHall, Essex; and that in the north aisle by Dean Peacock.\r\n\r\nNear the Library door is a simple memorial stone[50] to Dean Peacock,\r\nthe great promoter of the recent restorations, who died in 1858, and\r\nwas buried in the Cemetery. Just below this is an elegant memorial\r\nbrass to the Rev. Solomon Smith, M.A., for over forty years a Minor\r\nCanon of the Cathedral, and for many years Incumbent of St. Mary's.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 50: See note, p. 50.]\r\n\r\nSeveral other memorial remains may be observed in various parts of the\r\nchurch, but to enumerate them or to point them out would exceed our\r\nlimits, one we may notice in passing, that of Dean Caesar (1614-1636),\r\nwhich has been removed from a position it long occupied in the north\r\naisle of the Choir, to the junction of that aisle with the closed end\r\nof the eastern aisle of the north Transept, near the new pulpit.\r\n\r\nWe may also notice a new oaken lectern or reading desk near the\r\npulpit, containing a beautifully carved figure representative of the\r\nfirst beatitude, under a cinquefoil canopy, the gift of the Very Rev.\r\nthe Dean.\r\n\r\n\"Of fifty-four bishops of Ely,\" says Mr. Millers, \"thirty-five are\r\nknown to have been buried in this Cathedral, and two in the Lady\r\nChapel. Of these thirty-seven, there are memorials of twenty; some of\r\nthem very scanty and much mutilated, and many removed from the spots\r\nwhere the bodies of those whom they commemorate repose. Of the other\r\nseventeen, there were no doubt, similar memorials, but they 'are\r\nperished as though they had never been.'\"[51] Since the above was\r\nwritten two others have been buried in the Cathedral--Bishop Sparke\r\nin West's chapel, and Bishop Allen behind the altar screen, as we have\r\nnoticed; Bishop Turton (1845-1864), was buried at Kensal Green.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 51: Millers' Description of Ely Cathedral, p. 85.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n+The Lady Chapel.+\r\n\r\nWe will now direct the attention of the visitor to this most\r\ninteresting building, which stands on the north side of the Cathedral,\r\nparallel with the Choir, and is approached through a doorway at the\r\nnorth-east corner of the north Transept. This chapel was erected in\r\nthe early part of the fourteenth century, the first stone being laid\r\non Lady-day, 1321, by Alan de Walsingham, then sub-prior, and the\r\nwhole was completed A.D. 1349. The works were carried on chiefly under\r\nthe charge of John de Wisbech, one of the monks, who, it is stated,\r\nwhilst assisting in digging the foundations, found a brazen pot of old\r\ncoins buried in the earth, and which proved a great assistance in\r\ncarrying on the work. This was, perhaps, one of the most beautiful and\r\nelaborate specimens of the Decorated style in England; and as Mr.\r\nStewart observes, \"must have been a perfect storehouse of statuary and\r\nelaborate tabernacle work.\" Even in its present dilapidated state it\r\nwill amply repay a careful examination. It was dedicated to St. Mary,\r\nand after the Reformation, was (in 1566) assigned by the Dean and\r\nChapter for the use of the inhabitants of the parish of Holy Trinity\r\nin lieu of their own church then in ruins, and has since been\r\nfrequently called \"Trinity Church.\"\r\n\r\nThis is, perhaps, the widest single-span church in the kingdom, being\r\n46 feet in width; the length is 100 feet, and the height 60 feet to\r\nthe centre of the ceiling. Its length is divided into five severies,\r\nin each of which, on both sides, is a window of great size with four\r\nlights and rich tracery, in some of which are fragments of the\r\noriginal stained glass, sufficient to indicate that they were all, at\r\none period, entirely so filled. The end windows are noble and\r\nspacious, the west window having eight lights, and the east window\r\nseven, both have transoms, and each with tracery differing from the\r\nother, and from the windows in the sides. Both are insertions of a\r\nsomewhat later date than the building, the east window by Bishop\r\nBarnet about 1373, and the other a little later.\r\n\r\nThe walls everywhere display a rich profusion and variety of ornament,\r\nonce beautified with colouring and gilding, but some years ago covered\r\nwith whitewash; a few faint traces of its former splendour may yet be\r\nfound in various parts of the chapel, enough perhaps to shew that it\r\nmust have been gorgeous in the extreme.\r\n\r\nA low bench table runs along the walls and carries a series of niches\r\nwith canopies richly decorated, the piers of which rise from the\r\nfloor, but each is divided into two by a slender pillar rising from\r\nthe bench table; the arcade on the north side consists of nineteen\r\ntabernacles separated by square pilasters of Purbeck marble; there are\r\nfive sets of three each under the windows, and the remaining four fill\r\nup the intermediate spaces between the five groups. The canopy of each\r\nof the fifteen tabernacles consists of a head of singular beauty,\r\nradiated and inclined forwards, on the apex is, or was, the figure of\r\na saint; above these is a hood-mould crocketed, and terminating with a\r\nfinial. The other four are wider, and instead of the figure of a saint\r\non the apex each terminates in a group of three elaborately carved\r\nbrackets or corbels, which support two other ranges of niches in\r\npairs, surmounted by ornamented canopies, and between them runs a\r\nroof-shaft, from which spring the ribs of the vaulting, which is\r\nsimilar to that of the stalled Choir. The spandrils of the tabernacle\r\nwork is filled with diaper work and alto relievos which are supposed\r\nto represent some legendary history, most probably that of the virgin.\r\n\r\nThe south side is similar to the north, except that the range of\r\ntabernacles is broken by doorways. The west end contains eight of\r\nthese tabernacles, and at the east end a larger niche occupied the\r\ncentre with others on the sides, but these were altered at a later\r\nperiod. The altar is elevated above the level of the floor, and the\r\nniches on the side walls are raised in accordance. Large niches are\r\nplaced on the sides of all the windows, and a pierced parapet standing\r\non an entablature formed of a receding hollow, runs under the side\r\nwindows only.\r\n\r\nThe backs of the niches and indeed many parts of the chapel show\r\nremains of rich colouring; the ceiling was painted a rich blue studded\r\nwith silver stars, the bosses at the intersections of the ribs\r\nrepresented flowers, foliage, and grotesque masks, and some of those\r\nalong the mid-rib represented emblems of the nativity, crucifixion,\r\nthe virgin, &c.; they had been richly coloured and gilded, but, like\r\nother parts of the building, have been defaced and injured; and every\r\nperson who sees it must feel a deep regret that so beautiful a\r\nbuilding should ever reach such a stage of desecration.\r\n\r\nA few modern monumental tablets are placed on the walls, but they\r\ndiminish rather than increase the decoration: some others have been\r\nremoved to the entrance, and in 1865 the close pews were taken away\r\nand replaced by open seats; the organ has been enlarged and its\r\nposition changed, which does not improve the appearance of the church;\r\nsome of the windows have been re-glazed and other improvements\r\neffected. The present Incumbent is the Rev. E.H. Lowe, M.A.\r\n\r\nThe position of the Lady Chapel here is rather unusual, it is\r\ngenerally placed at the east end of the Church; but in some few\r\ninstances that honourable position was appropriated to the shrine of\r\nthe local saint; here it was occupied by the shrine of St. Etheldreda,\r\nwhose final resting place was within the apse of the original Choir,\r\nbefore the Presbytery was built.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n+The Upper parts of the Church.+\r\n\r\nTo those who may feel disposed to explore the upper parts of the\r\nchurch, facilities are afforded by a staircase commencing at the\r\nsouth-west Transept leading to the western Tower; and by another\r\nleading from the north Transept; but permission must be obtained, for\r\nwhich an application should be made to the Verger in attendance. The\r\nascent, though tedious, is not dangerous, if due caution be used. Many\r\nparts will be found worthy of attention; the timber work of the\r\nOctagon is a very curious piece of carpentry executed in English oak,\r\nand very massive. A fine view of the interior may be had by standing\r\nagainst the upper tier of the windows at the east end, and looking\r\nwestward; and another from the great Tower, by looking eastward\r\nthrough one of the openings near the clock face in the Nave. An\r\nextensive view of the surrounding country may be obtained from the\r\nsummit of the Tower, exhibiting a complete panorama of the district,\r\nwith several churches peeping from among the trees, and the river Ouse\r\ntracing its meandering course towards the sea, while corn-fields,\r\nmeadows, and pastures contribute towards the beauty of the scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Exterior of the Cathedral.+\r\n\r\nAfter a careful examination of the interior, the visitor will do well\r\nto look round the exterior. We will continue our observations for his\r\nguidance and assistance, starting from the western front where we\r\nbegan; or by leaving the Cathedral by the north door into the\r\nchurch-yard, we turn to the left hand towards the north-west corner of\r\nthe building, and proceed eastward.\r\n\r\nWhile we are on the spot it may be well to observe the burial-ground\r\nnear us, where lie the remains of generation after generation of\r\nformer inhabitants of the town. Reader, let thy foot tread lightly\r\nhereabout, for the dust it presses on is all that remains of the\r\nearthly portion of creatures once breathing and living like yourself.\r\nWhat a lesson is afforded us when we contemplate, on the one hand the\r\nworks of men of ages long past, but still standing as monuments of\r\ntheir skill and piety, and on the other the graves of the silent dead;\r\nthe heads which planned and the hands which executed, where are they?\r\nLong since consigned to earth. All must feel, more or less, the\r\ninfluence of impressions to which such thoughts and scenes give rise,\r\nand may such feelings cause us to remember that we are but dust, and\r\nthat we must, perhaps soon, become as those who lie beneath our feet!\r\n\r\n     \"Our time is fixed, and all our days are numbered,\r\n     How long, how short, we know not.\"--_Blair_.\r\n\r\nThe church-yard has been closed from burials for some years, and a\r\ncemetery has been formed a short distance from the town for the use of\r\nboth parishes, as well as for the precincts which are extra-parochial.\r\nMany of the gravestones have been laid down, others removed, but a few\r\ninscriptions might be found which would afford food for meditation to\r\nthose who may feel inclined to examine them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of our survey we examined the western front, and\r\nwill now turn our attention to the remains of the north-west Transept.\r\nSome persons have doubted whether this wing ever existed, but Sir.\r\nG.G. Scott, in his able Lecture on the Cathedral, delivered at the\r\nEtheldreda Festival in October, 1873, gave good reasons for believing\r\nthat it was built at the same time as the Tower and the south wing;\r\nand we cannot but think the ruins give strong evidence of its having\r\nbeen similar in all respects to that on the south side. There is in\r\nthis, as in the other, a grand semicircular arch on the eastern side,\r\nand portions of another which probably communicated with some chapel,\r\nof which however there are neither remains nor record. It would appear\r\nthat after the fall of the original wing a new building was begun on\r\nthe same spot, not however of the same dimensions, and carried but a\r\nfew feet and then discontinued. A band of panelling in the western\r\nface of the buttress corresponds with the work on the monument of\r\nBishop Redman, who died in 1505, but the fall of the Transept took\r\nplace some years, probably a century, before that. The arches built\r\nwithin the original arches of the Tower to afford additional support\r\nare believed to have been erected in the early part of the fifteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nWe have reasons to hope that steps will ere long be taken to raise a\r\nfund towards rebuilding this Transept;[52] which would indeed be a\r\ngrand improvement, and worthy the support, not only of the Diocese of\r\nEly but of the nation at large.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 52: At the meeting of the Diocesan Conference at Ely, in\r\nJuly, 1874, the subject of the Restorations of the Cathedral was\r\ndiscussed, and the following Resolution passed unanimously.--\"That it\r\nis desirable that a Diocesan Committee of Clergy and Laity, with\r\nBranch Committees in each Archdeaconry, be formed to co-operate with\r\nthe Bishop, Dean, and Chapter, for raising funds to carry on the\r\nRestoration of the Cathedral by rebuilding in the first instance,\r\nafter the completion of the works now in hand, the north-west\r\nTransept.\"--_Ely Conference Report, 1874._]\r\n\r\nA good view of the Nave may be obtained as it is unobstructed through\r\nits whole length. A band of treble billet moulding runs under the\r\nlower windows; a double hatched moulding under the second tier; and\r\nimmediately below the parapet is the ornament called the corbel table;\r\nthese with the billet moulding round the clerestory windows, are in\r\nexcellent preservation. The parapet on the wall of the aisle is\r\nembattled, that above the clerestory windows is plain. Although at one\r\ntime battlements ran the whole length on both sides, those on the\r\nnorth were removed nearly one hundred years ago. The windows in the\r\nclerestory retain their original form, but those of the two lower\r\ntiers have been altered. Over one of the lower windows there appears a\r\ndate (1662), probably referring to the period of some important\r\nrepairs or alterations on this side. The removal of the ruins of the\r\nold Church of St. Cross, which stood near this spot, took place in\r\nthe reign of Elizabeth, when the use of the Lady Chapel was granted to\r\nthe parish of Holy Trinity.\r\n\r\nWe next turn our attention to the Octagon, which forms a grand central\r\npoint from which radiate the four principal parts of the church--the\r\nNave, the Choir, and the north and south arms of the Transept. Here\r\noriginally stood a large square Norman Tower, which fell down in 1322,\r\nand was replaced by the present building; it is not an exact octagon,\r\nhaving four longer sides adjoining the four main portions of the\r\nbuilding, and four shorter sides at the angles. The design was a grand\r\none, but whether it was ever fully carried out is somewhat doubtful,\r\nthe stone-work is carried up to a height a little above the roof of\r\nthe Nave, &c., but the Lantern above is of English oak covered with\r\nlead. From a strong buttress, surmounted by a pinnacle, at each of the\r\nangles formed by the walls of the Nave and Choir aisles with those of\r\nthe Transept spring two massive flying buttresses, abutting octagonal\r\nturrets at each angle of the Octagon; these turrets were probably\r\noriginally designed to be finished with pinnacles, and thus form a\r\ncorona; between them runs a pierced parapet formerly surmounted by a\r\nbold cresting of leaves and other ornaments; and there are bases of\r\npillars at the cardinal points. These pinnacles with the cresting have\r\njust been completed in Clipsham stone, by Mr. Wood, of Ely, in a\r\nmanner highly creditable to his skill, and greatly to the improvement\r\nof the appearance of the building. Beneath the parapet, instead of a\r\ncorbel table, there is a deep hollow, with running leaves, and small\r\nball flowers at intervals. The sides of the Octagon are adorned with\r\nan arcade of pointed arches, some of which are pierced and glazed to\r\nadmit light; the longer sides have six, and the shorter three, of\r\nthese arches. In each of the turrets is a winding stair communicating\r\nrespectively with the main parts of the building. The Lantern above is\r\nof two stories, the lower, (which is open to the interior of the\r\nOctagon) is lighted by windows assimilating with the large windows in\r\nthe angles of the Octagon; the upper story is lighted by louvres as\r\nadapted to a belfry, for which purpose this chamber was originally\r\ndesigned; the lower windows have been reconstructed, a series of\r\nflying buttresses (which had been taken away) have been re-placed\r\nagainst the angle divisions, which are finished with embattled turrets\r\ninstead of pinnacles, and between them runs an open-work parapet. The\r\nwhole of the Lantern has been repaired, and the exterior wood work\r\nre-covered with lead.\r\n\r\nThe portion of the north Transept which fell down in 1699, although\r\nsoon afterwards carefully restored, and the mouldings and ornaments\r\nnicely replaced, may yet be distinguished from the old work: the\r\nTuscan door-arch, however, in its northern face, is quite out of place\r\nhere, not according with the style of the building in which it is\r\nplaced. The restorations were executed under the directions of Sir\r\nChristopher Wren. The northern face of the Transept shows two pairs of\r\nNorman windows, the second pair being longer than those in the lower\r\ntier; above these is an arcade of small arches, and over these are two\r\nhigh Perpendicular windows, which reach partly into the gable. Over\r\nthe doorway in the eastern aisle is an original Norman window, and in\r\nthe western aisle is a replaced one.\r\n\r\nThe west front of the Lady Chapel[53] is richly decorated with niches,\r\nand has a noble window, under which is an arcade of small arches\r\nformed entirely in the thickness of the wall, in the back of some of\r\nwhich may be seen traces of coloured decoration; the gable point is\r\nadorned with a niche rising above the pierced parapet running up the\r\nsides. On each side of the building are five large windows, the\r\ntracery of which is much decayed, having been executed in a softer\r\nkind of stone than the walls. Between each two windows is a deep\r\nprojecting buttress surmounted by a crocketed pinnacle; at the angles\r\nare double buttresses, on which are two kinds of tabernacles, both are\r\nsquare and occupy the breadth of the buttress, the upper one is\r\nrecessed in the body of the buttress, the lower one is open on three\r\nsides, and had small pillars at the front angles rising from the\r\nset-off and carrying the projecting canopy; the tops being finished\r\nwith crocketed pinnacles. The east end is not so richly ornamented as\r\nthe west; the window is a very fine one but not so large as the\r\nwestern one, and there are no niches on the sides nor beneath it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 53: Now in course of restoration.]\r\n\r\nThe north side of the Choir is somewhat hidden by the Lady Chapel,\r\nwhich stands parallel to it, although the latter is much shorter; but\r\na better view may be had by going between them. An opportunity is also\r\nthus afforded of observing the original Norman windows of the\r\ntriforium of the Transept.\r\n\r\nThe windows of the aisle are uniform in size and shape, those of the\r\ntriforium are nearly similar, but all were originally lancet-shaped,\r\nbut altered to their present form in the latter part of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. The aisle roof of the two western bays of Bishop Northwold's\r\nwork (the six eastern bays) was perhaps originally as high as the\r\nother parts, but altered at a later period; the tracery of these\r\nwindows on the north side remains, but on the south side there is a\r\ndifference which should be noticed. The lighter style of architecture\r\nand the large windows of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries made\r\nthe support of buttresses necessary, in this instance they are deep,\r\nand surmounted by crocketed pinnacles; on the sides of many of them\r\nare gargoyles, or water-spouts of grotesque figures; flying buttresses\r\nare sometimes used in addition, reaching from the side buttresses to\r\nthe clerestory walls, thus forming an important addition to the\r\nsupport as well as to the external beauty of the fabric: of this the\r\nexterior of the Choir of Ely Cathedral is a splendid proof.\r\n\r\nThe east end of the Cathedral is one of the finest specimens extant of\r\nan Early English east front. It is divided into three stories; the\r\nlowest has three lancet windows of nearly equal height; the next tier\r\nhas five windows of the same shape, side by side, the centre one being\r\nhigher and those on the sides gradually lower; the third story, which\r\nis within the gable, contains three lancet windows, not seen in the\r\nChoir, but giving light to the space between the ceiling and the roof.\r\nThere are several niches for statues, but no figures; and the\r\nspandrils of the window arches are relieved by quatrefoils and other\r\nornaments. The gable point is adorned with an ornamented cross, which\r\nhas been restored at the expense of Lady Mildred Hope; and a crocketed\r\npinnacle at the south-east corner has been given by A.J.B. Beresford\r\nHope, Esq. Rather more than a century ago this end was about two feet\r\nout of the perpendicular, but was skilfully restored by Mr. Essex, the\r\narchitect.\r\n\r\nThe eastern faces of the aisles appear as wings to the end of the\r\nChoir, and are flanked with double buttresses at the angles, upon\r\nwhich are set larger pinnacles crocketed. The windows lighting the two\r\nchapels at the end of the aisles were probably inserted when the\r\nchapels were erected; that in the north aisle is set in the wall,\r\nwhile that in the south aisle projects beyond the wall nearly to the\r\ndepth of the buttress.\r\n\r\nThe south side of the Choir is similar to the north, with the\r\nexception before mentioned--the two western bays of Bishop Northwold's\r\nwork, in each of which the opening in the triforium is formed into two\r\narches of a style differing from the adjoining portion of the\r\nbuilding, but which have the appearance of originality. The walls of\r\nthe triforium, both in the Choir and Nave were not originally so high\r\nas we now see them, but no doubt were heightened when the larger\r\nwindows were inserted.\r\n\r\nThe south end of the Transept differs from the north in the\r\narrangement of the windows; in the gable is a low Perpendicular window\r\nof seven lights, sunk within a deep recess; the north end has in the\r\nupper tier two large Perpendicular windows side by side. There is also\r\na difference in the gable and pinnacles. Some corbels in the lower\r\npart of the wall would indicate the former existence of an adjoining\r\nstructure but what it was we cannot undertake to say.\r\n\r\nConsiderable anxiety has been felt as to the stability of some\r\nportions of the south side, and it has been found necessary to\r\nunderpin some of the buttresses of the Choir and the walls of the\r\nTransept with large slabs of Yorkshire stone. It has also been deemed\r\ndesirable to circumscribe the two round towers of the south west\r\nTransept with iron bands.\r\n\r\nThe south entrance to the Cathedral is through a portion of the\r\neastern side of the +Cloisters+. The arch of entrance however, does\r\nnot harmonise with the other portions of the Transept, and was\r\ndoubtless an insertion, probably at the same time as a similar one in\r\nthe north Transept, and by the same architect. It passes through a\r\nbeautiful Norman door-arch in the south wall of the Nave, as described\r\nin p. 41. Near this are the remains of an enriched arch, recently\r\ndiscovered when the wall was repaired; if it is in its original\r\nposition it must have formed a communication from the Cloisters to\r\nthat portion of the western aisle of the south Transept which now\r\nforms the Vergers' vestry.\r\n\r\nThe south side of the Nave is nearly similar to the north, but there\r\nis no corbel table under the embattled parapet of the aisle: the aisle\r\nwindows have, with one exception, been restored to their original\r\nform; those in the second tier retain their altered shape; but those\r\nof the clerestory, as on the north side, are original.\r\n\r\nThe apsidal +Chapel of St. Catharine+, adjoining the south-west\r\nTransept, has been rebuilt in accordance with the original structure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n+Dimensions of the Cathedral.+\r\n\r\nINTERIOR.\r\n                                                                    Ft.

In order to bring them all\r\nconveniently before the visitor we will retrace our steps for a short\r\ndistance round the east end of the Cathedral, and commence with the\r\nbuildings on the north side of the Lady Chapel.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+The Monastic Buildings.+\r\n\r\n_&c. &c._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will commence our notice of these remains of former ages by\r\nobserving that as they now, in a great measure, form private\r\nresidences, they can only be seen by visitors externally; it will be\r\nsufficient, therefore, for us to point out the several localities, and\r\nstate, as far as we are able, their original uses, and present\r\nappropriation.\r\n\r\nOn the north side of the Lady Chapel stands an old square tower, now\r\nused as a belfry for the parish of the Holy Trinity, but it is not\r\ncertain for what purpose it was originally used. Adjoining this is a\r\nbuilding recently erected on the site of a former one, comprising a\r\npractice-room and school-room for the Choristers, with a residence for\r\nthe master; beyond this, eastward, is an arched gateway communicating\r\nwith the public street: this was closed up for many years, but has\r\nlately been re-opened; over it is the muniment room of the Dean and\r\nChapter. Next is a residence for one of the Vergers, and beyond that\r\nis another dwelling house; the next portion is in a dilapidated state,\r\nand at the present time is used as a mason's yard and workshop for\r\ncarrying on the works in progress: these occupy the site of the\r\nancient +Sacristy+. A little further in the same direction stands the\r\nresidence of one of the prebendaries, on the site of the ancient\r\n+Almonry+; there are in this building some remains of Early English\r\nvaulting, and at the east end may be observed the remains of a triplet\r\nwindow of the same period; the middle window has been destroyed by the\r\ninsertion of a modern window, now blocked up, but the stone work of\r\nthe side windows can easily be traced.\r\n\r\nWe next proceed round the east end of the Cathedral to the south end\r\nof the Transept, a few yards south of which may be observed a range of\r\nEarly English arches, each containing a double arch, which is again\r\nsubdivided, but all have been long blocked up; this was a portion of\r\nwhat was called the \"Dark Cloister.\" To the eastward of these is\r\nanother range of arches with piers about twelve feet in height, some\r\nof which are comparatively perfect; these piers are alternately\r\ncylindrical and octagonal, the octagonal columns presenting\r\nalternately a side or an angle in front. The arches are profusely\r\nenriched with mouldings; the walls above were pierced with a row of\r\nsmall windows with semicircular heads. These piers and arches may be\r\nseen on both sides of the road-way, corresponding with each other like\r\nthe nave of a church, and afford a good example of \"highly refined\r\nNorman work.\" A beautiful arch at the end leads to another series, and\r\nbeyond this, in one of the prebendal houses, is a vaulted room which\r\nseems to have been erected about the period of the transition from the\r\nNorman style to the Early English.\r\n\r\nThey form a church-like building, and by some historians have been\r\ndescribed as the remains of the Conventual Church erected at the\r\nrestoration of the monastery by Ethelwold, A.D. 970, and including the\r\nruins of St. Etheldreda's own church, founded A.D. 673. This, if\r\ncorrect, would make it one of the oldest specimens of the Saxon style\r\nin the kingdom. This statement has been contradicted by others, and\r\nProfessor Willis, who had devoted much attention to these buildings,\r\nstated that they are the remains of the +Infirmary+ of the monastery,\r\nwith a chapel attached, and erected many years subsequent to the\r\nperiod mentioned; the portion we have likened to the nave of a\r\nchurch--now affording an approach to several residences--was the body\r\nof the Infirmary; the portion east of the arch was no doubt the\r\nchapel, and the vaulted room spoken of, the chancel. This statement\r\nderives some confirmation from the existence, in a similar position,\r\nof the Infirmary at Peterborough, and at some other places. The style\r\nof architecture too denotes a period subsequent to the erection of the\r\nnave of the Cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe house on the north side, adjoining the chapel before mentioned,\r\nnow a prebendal residence, appears to have undergone little alteration\r\nsince its erection; the parapet, and the almost flat roof covered with\r\nlead, appear to be original. This was probably used by the master of\r\nthe Infirmary as a residence, and a hall to entertain the aged and\r\ninfirm separately from the sick monks, being near the chapel and the\r\nInfirmary. The next house westward, now the residence of a Minor\r\nCanon, is said to have been the \"Painted Chamber,\" but to what use it\r\nwas applied we are not able to say.\r\n\r\nThe residence on the south side of the Infirmary, opposite to the last\r\nmentioned, now the residence of a prebendary, stands on the site of\r\nthe \"Cellarer's Lodging\"; and the next house, eastward, also a\r\nprebendal residence, on the site of the \"Black Hostelry,\" or near it.\r\n\r\nThe +Dormitory+ of the monks was generally a long narrow room,\r\nstanding north and south, near the church, convenient for the monks'\r\nattendance on the nocturnal services; here it was situated near what\r\nhas been pointed out as part of the \"Dark Cloister,\" not far from the\r\nsouth end of the Transept, and probably the communication was by a\r\npassage leading to a winding stair still standing in the south-east\r\nangle of the Transept.\r\n\r\nThe +Chapter House+ is believed to have stood between the north end of\r\nthe Dormitory and the Transept, similar to Peterborough, having its\r\nentrance from the east side of the Cloisters; nothing however remains\r\nto shew its exact position; both Mr. Bentham and Mr. Millers describe\r\nit as having stood on the space now occupied by the Dean's flower\r\ngarden, where are some remains of a building in the Norman style, but\r\nwhich has since been stated to have been the Monks' kitchen; but in\r\nconsequence of the many alterations which have been made at different\r\nperiods, the demolition and removal of some buildings, and the ruin of\r\nothers, it is difficult to speak with certainty. The monastery was a\r\nlarge one, and the buildings numerous for the various requirements, of\r\nmany of which no traces remain, nor is it known where they were\r\nsituated.\r\n\r\nThe only part remaining of the +Cloisters+ is the north-east angle,\r\nthrough one part of which is the south entrance to the Cathedral. The\r\ninner wall of the north side and part of the east side are yet\r\nstanding, with the openings partially bricked up, but the roof is\r\ngone. These are not the original Cloisters, but occupy nearly the same\r\nposition as the earlier ones.\r\n\r\nThe +Refectory+, according to Professor Willis and others, stood at\r\nthe south side of the Cloisters, on part of the space now occupied by\r\nthe Dean's garden, a portion of a very thick wall, in which are some\r\nEarly English corbels, is still remaining.\r\n\r\nOur attention will next be directed to the Deanery, sometime thought\r\nto have been the Refectory, but was more probably the +Guest-hall+ for\r\nthe entertainment of strangers and others visiting the monastery. It\r\nis a large building, standing like several others upon vaults, and\r\nappears to have been built in the latter part of the thirteenth\r\ncentury; it has, however, undergone considerable alterations at\r\ndifferent times, and now presents but few remains of that period,\r\nalthough the walls, buttresses, and vaults bear strong characteristics\r\nof it. This formed the northern side of a small court, around which\r\nwere buildings forming the residence of the priors of the monastery,\r\nof which also the next house, now the residence of a prebendary,\r\nformed a part; the vaulting of this is very ancient, probably in the\r\nearly part of the Norman era, but the superstructure is of a later\r\nperiod. There is a fine fourteenth-century fire place in the house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAdjoining this house, at the south-west corner, next the garden,\r\nstands a building generally known as \"+Prior Crauden's Chapel+,\"\r\nhaving been founded by John de Crauden, prior of Ely (1321-1341), as a\r\nprivate chapel attached to his residence, and built under the\r\ndirection of Alan de Walsingham, the skilful architect of the Octagon.\r\nIt is most interesting for the rich remains of architectural beauty\r\nwhich it displays. \"It is,\" says Mr. Rickman, \"one of the most curious\r\nand valuable Decorated remains in the kingdom; its ornaments are of\r\nthe best character, and well executed, and the whole design is of\r\ngreat excellence.\" It belongs to the Deanery, but was for many years\r\nused in connection with the adjoining house, having been converted\r\ninto three rooms by floors inserted; these floors have been removed,\r\nand the chapel in some degree restored; some of the windows which had\r\nbeen closed have been re-opened, and the eastern one filled with\r\nstained glass, the gift of Mrs. Smart. It is now used as a private\r\nchapel for the Grammar School.\r\n\r\nThe Chapel stands upon a vault, the floor of which is nearly upon a\r\nlevel with the surrounding ground; the vault has a groined ceiling\r\nsupported by plain columns, and the original entrance was directly\r\nunder the west window of the Chapel, but is now on the north side. The\r\nentrance to the chapel is by a staircase which winds within the\r\nbuttress at the north-west angle. The length is divided into four\r\ncompartments by clustered columns, from the tops of which sprung the\r\nribs of the vaulting. The first compartment is plain, and was probably\r\nthe ante-chapel: the second is ornamented with a double niche, richly\r\ndecorated with small columns, pinnacles, crockets, &c.; in the lower\r\nniche the wall is pierced for a small window; the upper one probably\r\ncontained a figure: the third and fourth compartments have long\r\npointed windows, separated into two lights by a mullion. The east end\r\nhas ornamented niches in the angles, it projects a little beyond the\r\ncompartments, forming a recess, in which is the large window, divided\r\ninto five lights, with elaborate tracery. The floor is elevated at the\r\neast end for the altar, and is formed of mosaic tiles; upon the raised\r\nportion is represented the Fall of man, and the remainder is\r\nornamented with various other figures and devices; some portions are\r\nnearly perfect, but the colouring is greatly faded. Some remains of\r\nfresco painting were discovered on the walls when the restorations\r\nwere in progress, and probably the chapel had originally been richly\r\nembellished with colours and gilding, in the style of the period in\r\nwhich it was built.\r\n\r\nWe have now an opportunity of glancing at some of the other portions\r\nof the monastic buildings, which formerly extended from the Prior's\r\nLodge to the gateway, but are now somewhat short of it, as a garden\r\nintervenes.\r\n\r\nThe first, adjoining the Deanery, formerly the Registry, but\r\noriginally part of the residence of the former priors, was called\r\n\"+The Lodge+,\" and contained the great hall, named \"The Fair Hall,\"\r\nthe high sharp-pointed windows of which still remain in the first\r\nstory; from the corner of this hall a gallery or passage led to the\r\nprior's chapel just mentioned. This formed the western side of the\r\nsmall court before spoken of, around which the residence of the\r\npriors was built. This is now the residence of the Rev. R. Winkfield,\r\nHead Master of the Grammar School, and the adjoining house, formerly\r\nthe school house, is used as a dormitory, &c. for the pupils. Next to\r\nthis is the residence of the Rev. W.E. Dickson, Minor Canon and\r\nPrecentor, which brings us to the end of this series of the buildings.\r\nThese all stand upon vaults or crypts, which were probably used as\r\ncellars or store-houses, and the superstructure as lodgings for guests\r\nof the prior, being near his residence; these buildings formed the\r\nwestern side of the monastery, and were built about 1180, but raised\r\nand altered by Alan de Walsingham, about 1320.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis brings us in our progress to the great gate of the monastery,\r\ncalled \"+Ely Porta+,\" or more frequently, the \"Porter's Lodge.\" It is\r\na large and massive pile, having square towers at the angles, and was\r\nbegun by Prior Buckton shortly before his death in 1397, and probably\r\nfinished by his successor, Walpol, as it is sometimes spoken of as\r\n\"Walpol's Gate.\" On the eastern side the opening is a single arch of\r\ngreat span, but on the western side there are two, a large one--but\r\nsmaller than that on the eastern side--for carriages, and a still\r\nsmaller one for foot passengers. The north end of the building is\r\noccupied as the residence of the Porter, who is also a Verger of the\r\nCathedral; the south end with the rooms above, including a large one\r\nover the archway, is used for the Cathedral Grammar School, or +King's\r\nSchool+, founded in 1541, by Henry VIII., and is under the control of\r\nthe Dean and Chapter. The foundation is for twenty-four boys, who are\r\nelected without restriction as to birth or residence, and are entitled\r\nto some privileges in reduction of school fees. The school has lately\r\nbeen re-modelled by the Dean and Chapter, in order to bring it up to\r\nthe requirements of the age, and extensive alterations have been made\r\nto provide accommodation for boarders.[54] The school is not\r\nrestricted to the foundation boys, but is open to all who are prepared\r\nto accede to the terms, and is now in a flourishing condition.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: We understand it is intended to make some further\r\nalterations, and to build a new \"hostel,\" on a plot of ground nearly\r\nopposite the gateway on the western side, forming a block of buildings\r\nto include accommodation for sixty boys, with masters' and servants'\r\noffices, as well as the dormitories, studies, and day rooms for the\r\nboys.]\r\n\r\nWe will now cast our eyes over the Park, which was much improved by\r\nthe exertions of Dean Peacock; it was formerly divided into several\r\ninclosures by walls or hedges, but is now in two pieces, separated by\r\niron fencing, and has been planted in various parts with ornamental\r\ntrees; a pathway runs round the south-eastern portion, and another\r\nacross it, and by a pair of iron gates (closed at night) a\r\ncommunication is formed with a street at the lower part of the city.\r\nOn the south side is an artificial mound generally called \"Cherry\r\nHill,\" the origin of which is uncertain; but it was probably occupied\r\nby a mill for the use of the monastery; Mr. Millers thought it once\r\nformed the site of a castle erected for the defence of the monastery,\r\nwhich in early times experienced some of the vicissitudes of war; it\r\nis covered with trees and shrubs, and a winding path leads to the top,\r\nwhere there is a kind of summer-house. A good view of the adjacent\r\ncountry may be had from the summit, particularly towards the east,\r\nsouth, and west.\r\n\r\nFrom the foot of this hill, extending to some length westward, is a\r\nrange of buildings used in part as stables and coach-houses, and\r\npartly as workshops and store-houses for stone and materials required\r\nfor the repair of the Cathedral and buildings; this was the small\r\ngrange within the precincts, a larger one stood more to the westward,\r\noutside the monastery.\r\n\r\nWe will pass through the gateway and examine its western front which\r\nremains nearly in its original state; there are some niches and\r\ncanopies, and several shields but their bearings are nearly all\r\nobliterated. The gates are closed at night.\r\n\r\nWhile here we may notice at a short distance to the left, at the\r\nsouth-west corner of the open space, the new Theological College,\r\ndesigned for candidates for Holy Orders desirous of religious\r\npreparation, theological instruction, and pastoral training; and is\r\nopen to students who have graduated at one of the Universities: of\r\nwhich the Rev. Dr. Luckock, Canon of the Cathedral, is principal. The\r\nbuilding is of red brick with stone dressings, and contains chapel,\r\nlecture room, studies and dormitories for the accommodation of twelve\r\nstudents, with the usual offices.\r\n\r\nOur course will now take us northwards towards the Cathedral, outside\r\nthe western boundary of the monastery, thus giving the opportunity of\r\nobserving the other side of the buildings we noticed after Prior\r\nCrauden's chapel: that they are of great antiquity is evident by the\r\nflat Norman buttresses on part of the western wall; but they have at\r\nvarious times undergone considerable alterations which have done much\r\nto obliterate their original appearance, and alter the character of\r\nthe buildings. We first pass the house occupied by the Rev. W.E.\r\nDickson, then those occupied by the Rev. R. Winkfield, including the\r\nhouse standing a few feet in retreat, originally part of the prior's\r\nresidence, which adjoins the western end of the Deanery; the remaining\r\nspace to the south-west Transept being occupied as a private garden by\r\nthe Dean. On our left are the gardens belonging to the Bishop's\r\nPalace; and this brings us to the west end of the Cathedral, from\r\nwhence we started on our tour of observation.\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral is too much encumbered by buildings to allow us to take\r\nthe whole of it into view from any one position; but several good\r\npoints of view may be found at moderate distances, ranging from\r\nsouth-west to east, which will, we think, amply repay those who may\r\nhave leisure and inclination to go a short distance to observe them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving endeavoured to point out, to the best of our ability, the\r\nobjects most worthy of notice in the Cathedral, as well as others\r\naround it within the precincts of the ancient monastery, we will add a\r\nbrief notice of a few other buildings which are without the precincts,\r\nbut should not be passed without some observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n+The Bishop's Palace.+\r\n\r\nThis is a large mansion consisting of a centre and two wings, nearly\r\nadjoining the west end of the Cathedral, being separated from it only\r\nby a public road. But little is known of a palace here prior to the\r\ntime of Bishop Alcock, who erected the present wings with a noble hall\r\nor gallery about the end of the fifteenth century: his arms, and those\r\nof the see may be seen in the face of the eastern wing. The gallery\r\nadjoining the western wing was erected by Bishop Goodrich in the third\r\nyear of the reign of Edward VI., whose arms appear in stone on the\r\ncentre of the lower panels of the bay window; on the panel to the\r\nright of this are the arms of Bishop Goodrich, and on the left panel,\r\nthe same arms impaling those of the see; on the left-hand splay panel\r\nis carved the \"Duty towards God,\" and on the right-hand splay panel\r\nthe \"Duty towards our neighbour.\" The more modern part of the house\r\nnext the garden is said to have been erected by Bishop Keene, but was\r\nperhaps only altered by him, as there was on the eastern side of the\r\npart projecting into the garden, a stone door arch apparently much\r\nolder than this part of the house; and another on the eastern side\r\nnear the chapel; this has been removed, and now forms the servants'\r\nentrance from \"the Green.\"\r\n\r\nThe interior of the house has been much improved, and the chapel in\r\nthe eastern wing fitted up with taste, the windows being filled with\r\nstained glass. The gardens are neat and kept in excellent order. There\r\nare in the Palace several portraits of bishops and others, also a\r\ncurious painting called the \"_Tabula Eliensis_\" representing the forty\r\nknights who were quartered on the monastery by William I., each with\r\nhis shield of arms, and a monk as his companion. There is also a\r\npicture 6 ft. 6 in. long and 2 ft. 2 in. high, representing the\r\nfuneral of Bishop Cox, in 1581. Bishop Turton left by his will two\r\npictures, to remain in the palace; and there is a good library\r\nbelonging to the see.\r\n\r\nFormerly the bishops of Ely had residences at several other places,\r\nviz., palaces at Somersham and Downham; Wisbech Castle, and the\r\nManor-houses at Doddington, Fen Ditton, and other places in\r\nCambridgeshire; and Hatfield, and Hadham, in Hertfordshire; there were\r\nten manor-houses and places of residence belonging to the Bishop of\r\nEly at the time of Bishop Barnet. The London residence of the bishops\r\nof Ely was formerly in Ely Place, Holborn, which was occupied\r\nsuccessively by forty-one bishops, extending over a period of nearly\r\nfive hundred years; it is now in Dover Street, Piccadilly, in a house\r\nbuilt by Bishop Keene, on the site of Albemarle House and other\r\nmessuages, which were purchased for the see in 1772.\r\n\r\nThe \"Green\" in front of the palace was formerly a piece of waste\r\nground; a few years ago it was laid out and planted with shrubs, and\r\nfenced off with a neat iron railing, at the expense of Bishop Turton,\r\nreserving to the public the right of free admission from eight a.m.,\r\nuntil an hour after sunset; this improvement has, we regret to say,\r\nthrough an unfortunate misunderstanding, been done away, and it now\r\npresents an appearance of desolation and neglect much to be\r\ndeprecated. We hope something may be done in order to remedy this sad\r\nstate, and render it more worthy of its position in front of one of\r\nthe noblest Cathedrals in England, and of the residence of the chief\r\npastor of a large and important diocese.\r\n\r\nThe house standing in a garden with iron gates, nearly opposite the\r\nbay window in the palace stands upon the site of the residence of the\r\nchaplains of an ancient chantry founded by Bishop Northwold, called\r\n\"The Chantry on the Green.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n+St. Mary's Church.+\r\n\r\nThis church will be found a short distance to the westward of the\r\nPalace, standing in a large grave-yard with a row of lime trees in\r\nfront. It is a neat building having a Nave with aisles, a Chancel and\r\na Tower surmounted by a spire at the west end. The Church is a mixture\r\nof the Transitional and Early English styles, but the Tower and Spire\r\nare in the Decorated style. It was built by Bishop Eustachius in the\r\nearly part of the thirteenth century on the site of a former church.\r\n\"It contains,\" says Mr. Millers, \"some curious architectural remains,\r\nparticularly the north and south[55] door arches, which are pointed\r\nand decorated with different sorts of Norman mouldings; but the\r\ncolumns have slender detached shafts, united under one capital\r\nwreathed with foliage, as in the Early English style. Of this mixture\r\nthere is no other specimen at Ely, and I have not met with an account\r\nof such an one in any other place.\" \"In the Tower of the Cathedral we\r\nhave the Norman style with pointed arches; in the Galilee, built a\r\nvery few years after, we have the Early English style; but each of\r\nthese is perfectly and characteristically distinct: in the interval,\r\nbetween the erection of one and the other, the public taste had\r\nundergone a change. It seems as if the work before us had been erected\r\nin that interval, and that the architect was disposed to adopt the new\r\nstyle without quitting the old one.\"[56] The Galilee of the Cathedral\r\nwas erected about 1215, and it is not improbable that this church was\r\nerected shortly before, and as it is stated during the episcopate of\r\nthe same bishop.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: This door was blocked up when the Church was repaired in\r\n1829.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: Millers' Description of Ely Cathedral, p. 148, 149.]\r\n\r\nThe columns of the Nave are simple and cylindrical, the capitals are\r\nNorman, and nearly similar to some of those in what has been called\r\n\"The Infirmary,\" but the high pointed arches which they support are of\r\na shape usual in the age in which this church was built, and some of\r\nthe mouldings are Early English. The windows in the aisles and\r\nclerestory are Perpendicular, probably inserted at a later period,\r\nwhen the church was repaired. The Chancel is Early English, with an\r\ninserted Perpendicular east window; there is a double sedile under\r\none trefoil arch, and a double piscina in the south wall.\r\n\r\nA chapel on the south side is also Early English; it has a triple\r\nlancet east window, and a west window of two lights with a quatrefoil\r\nin the head; there is here also a double piscina in the south wall. A\r\nportion of this chapel was partitioned off for use as a vestry, but is\r\nnow thrown open to the church.\r\n\r\nThe church was repaired and pewed, and a gallery erected on the south\r\nside in 1829-30, but this gallery, with another at the west end\r\nerected many years before, have lately been removed, the tower arch\r\nopened, and the nave restored, the floor raised, and the passages and\r\nother portions laid with Staffordshire tiles; the nearly flat\r\nplastered ceiling is divided into compartments by moulded ribs of\r\nwood, and the panels painted in distemper, among the patterns of which\r\nmay be seen the sacred monogram, the arms of the see and of the Dean\r\nand Chapter. The pews erected in 1829 have been removed and replaced\r\nby open seats of oak, free to all, and a new oaken pulpit resting on a\r\npillar of stone, the gift of the Bishop, placed against the chancel\r\narch on the south side. A new font, the gift of one friend, and an\r\nelegant brass lectern the gift of another, have assisted in the\r\ngeneral improvement. A fine-toned organ, built by Bishop and Sons,\r\nremoved from Trinity Church, Paddington, has been erected at the east\r\nend of the north aisle, on a site formerly occupied by a large faculty\r\npew belonging to \"Chantry House,\" alluded to in p. 112.\r\n\r\nThe chancel has been partially rebuilt and thoroughly restored, and\r\nfitted with appropriate seats in oak, at the cost of the\r\nEcclesiastical Commissioners.\r\n\r\nThe church is warmed by hot water, and lighted by gas. A fine peal of\r\neight bells hang in the Tower. There are no ancient monuments, but a\r\nfew modern tablets on the walls record the deaths of some former\r\nresidents of the parish; and a new and elegant memorial brass has been\r\nput up in the chancel to the Rev. Solomon Smith, M.A., Minor Canon of\r\nthe Cathedral, and for forty years incumbent of the parish.\r\n\r\nThe restoration of the church, the purchase of the organ, the\r\nfittings, &c., has been effected by subscriptions at a cost of nearly\r\nL2500, but a further sum is still required to repair and restore the\r\ntower and spire, improve the church-yard, &c.\r\n\r\nThe living is a vicarage, in the patronage of the Dean and Chapter;\r\nthe present incumbent is the Rev. John Franey, M.A. Minor Canon of the\r\nCathedral.\r\n\r\n\r\n+The Grange.+\r\n\r\nThe premises adjoining the church-yard on the west stand on part of\r\nthe ground formerly occupied by \"The Grange\" of the monastery, and the\r\nhouse is stated to have been at one time the residence of the\r\nProtector, Cromwell. The \"Sextry Barn,\" one of the largest in the\r\ncounty, perhaps in the kingdom, stood here, and is stated to have been\r\n291 ft. 6 in. long, and 39 ft. 5 in. wide, inside; it was built about\r\nthe middle of the thirteenth century, and taken down in 1842, and the\r\nspace once occupied by the monastic \"farm-yard\" is now covered by\r\nmodern buildings, part of which at least, are used for as good\r\npurposes; on one part excellent and commodious National Schools for\r\nboth boys and girls have been erected, and on another a series of\r\nsubstantial and comfortable Almshouses for aged men and women,\r\ninhabitants of Ely.\r\n\r\n\r\n+St. John's Hospital.+\r\n\r\nThe site of this hospital is a few hundred yards further west; the\r\nremains of it are very scanty, but sufficient to show that the\r\nbuildings were of an early age, although not enough to enable us to\r\ngive an opinion as to their form or extent; what is left has been\r\nconverted into use as farm buildings, one portion near the dwelling\r\nhouse, and another a short distance from it. There were formerly two\r\nhospitals in Ely, this dedicated to St. John the Baptist, and another\r\nto St. Mary Magdelene, the site of which is now unknown. According to\r\nMr. Bentham, the revenues of the two were united, and the communities\r\nassociated by Bishop Northwold about A.D. 1240, by whose ordinance the\r\nunited hospital was to consist of thirteen chaplains and brethren, who\r\nwere to have a common refectory and dormitory, and to wear an uniform\r\nhabit, and be under the immediate government of the Sacrist of Ely. It\r\nseems that this was not, like other hospitals of the kind, dissolved\r\nby Henry VIII., for it was held under the mastership of Edward Leedes,\r\nthe second prebendary of the eighth stall, who was also chancellor of\r\nthe diocese under Bishop Goodrich, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth; he\r\nwas at the same time chaplain to Archbishop Parker, and Master of\r\nClare Hall, Cambridge; he afterwards obtained from the queen a grant\r\nof the hospital, and with the consent of Bishop Cox, he surrendered\r\nthe whole site and possession to his college; his grant to the college\r\nwas confirmed by the Dean and Chapter in 1562, and the property is now\r\nin the hands of the Master, Fellows, and Scholars of Clare College,\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.\r\n\r\nTHE CATHEDRAL ORGAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following brief account of this fine instrument, furnished by the\r\nRev. the Precentor, may be interesting to many:--\r\n\r\nAt a very early period the Cathedral or Conventual Church contained an\r\norgan or organs: this clearly appears from records preserved among the\r\nmuniments of the Chapter; and at the dissolution of the Abbey we read\r\nthat there were \"two pair of organs in the Quire, and one pair in the\r\nLady Chapel.\" It is highly probable, from indications in the\r\nstone-work, that one, at least, of these Pre-Reformation organs was\r\nplaced in the triforium of the present nave, on the north side. It is\r\nwell known that the Quire at that period extended westward across the\r\nOctagon: the organ therefore was situated near the gates, and above\r\nthe stalls of the ancient Quire, nearly as it is now in the modern\r\nQuire. The Great Rebellion swept away organs from Ely, as from all\r\nother English Cathedrals; and during this dreary period the Choral\r\nService was suppressed and prohibited. After the Restoration, viz.,\r\nabout the year 1685, a new organ was erected by the celebrated Harris;\r\nand it is remarkable that this organ remained in daily use up to the\r\nyear 1831, without material alteration, not even a swell having been\r\nadded to the original great and choir. It is worthy of mention, that\r\nduring the extensive repairs of the Cathedral, conducted by the able\r\narchitect, Essex, about the middle of the last century, a proposition\r\nto place the organ at the eastern end of the Quire was seriously urged\r\nby him on the consideration of the Dean and Chapter. He alleged that\r\nthe instrument would \"conceal much cold unornamented wall!\" The\r\ncondition of Harris' organ had become dangerously crazy when Messrs.\r\nElliot and Hill were employed to rebuild it, or rather to insert a new\r\ninstrument in the old case. This they did with great ability and\r\nsuccess, and the organ which comprised ten stops in the great, five in\r\neach of choir and swell, and one set of pedal pipes, was a fine\r\nspecimen of the art as it was understood and practised about forty\r\nyears ago. When the restorations were commenced which have resulted in\r\nthe present splendid embellishment of the Cathedral, the organ-screen\r\nwas removed; and in 1851 the organ was re-modelled and altered to the\r\nCC compass, enclosed in its costly and exquisite case of carved oak,\r\nand _suspended_ from the triforium of the Choir, above the stalls on\r\nthe north, or (at Ely) Decani side. Provision was made for an adequate\r\npedal organ, lodged in the triforium gallery, where an admirable site\r\nwas also secured for the swell-box: the choir organ is _beneath_ the\r\ngreat, and behind it, in a picturesque stone tribune or loft, the\r\norganist was seated at the manuals. Three stops, viz. a manual Double\r\nof wood and metal, 16 feet tone; a metal Quint of 6 feet; and a\r\nPosaune of 8 feet; were added to the great organ, which then possessed\r\na tone of great power and beauty.\r\n\r\nBy the liberality of the Chapter, the completion and great enlargement\r\nof the organ was effected in the year 1867. Messrs. Hill have\r\nintroduced a new swell of 13 stops throughout, with a pedal organ of\r\nadequate dimensions. To this pedal organ the principal inhabitants of\r\nthe city of Ely contributed the important addition of a Sub-base of 32\r\nfeet tone, at a cost of upwards of L80. The whole instrument has 40\r\nsounding stops, and it will be seen from an inspection of the list\r\nthat every stop, even to the clarionet, is complete and entire,\r\nextending through the full compass of its manual. The tone of the full\r\norgan, with swell coupled, is very grand. The reeds, like all the\r\nstops of this class manufactured by Messrs. Hill, are positively\r\nmodels of smoothness, equality, and power. The two 8 feet reeds of the\r\ngreat, and the 16 feet reed, with the Horn, of the swell, are\r\nspecimens of which the builders may well be somewhat proud. All the\r\ncompound stops are very brilliant. Equal temperament has been applied\r\nto the tuning.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT ORGAN--CC to F in Alt.\r\n\r\n                                      Ft.

The Choir restored and re-arranged.\r\n\r\n     2. Central Lantern restored (Peacock Memorial).\r\n\r\n     3. South-east Transept restored.\r\n\r\n     4. South-west Transept restored.\r\n\r\n     5. Roof of North Transept restored and painted. (The\r\n     painting at the expense of tradesmen employed upon the\r\n     Cathedral.)\r\n\r\n     6. The Nave ceiled and painted. (The painting by the late\r\n     Mr. le Strange and Mr. Gambier Parry.)\r\n\r\n     7. Nave roof repaired and re-leaded.\r\n\r\n     8. St. Catherine's Chapel rebuilt.\r\n\r\n     9. Bishop Alcock's Chapel restored.\r\n\r\n     10. Galilee Porch re-paved.\r\n\r\n     11. The Western Tower opened, ceiled, (the ceiling painted\r\n     by Mr. le Strange), re-roofed, strengthened, &c., (part of\r\n     the expense borne by the late H.R. Evans, Esq., and his son,\r\n     the present H.R. Evans, Esq.)\r\n\r\n     12. About seventy windows filled with painted glass.\r\n\r\nThe expense of the restoration of the Cathedral cannot be given with\r\nperfect accuracy, but the account which is here subjoined will be near\r\nenough for all practical purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL RESTORATION.\r\n\r\n                                                          L   _s._ _d._\r\n\r\nContributed by the public to the \"Ely Cathedral\r\nRestoration Fund\"                                       9578   0    0\r\n\r\nExpended by the Dean and Chapter (about)              11,000   0    0\r\n\r\n\r\nPEACOCK MEMORIAL.\r\n\r\nContributed by the friends of Dean Peacock to the\r\nrestoration of the Lantern                              2407   0    0\r\n\r\nExpended by the Dean and Chapter (about)                4200   0    0\r\n\r\nIt would thus appear that since the commencement of the great works in\r\n1845 to the present time, the sum of L27,185 has been expended, of\r\nwhich L15,200 has been furnished by the Dean and Chapter. It ought to\r\nbe added that the sum contributed by the public includes a donation of\r\nL500 by the Bishop of the Diocese, and about L1000 contributed by\r\nmembers of the Chapter in their individual capacity.\r\n\r\nIt must be observed, however, that the sum just mentioned by no means\r\nrepresents all that has been done for the Cathedral. The following\r\nworks and gifts are not included:--\r\n\r\n     1. The painted windows, which have been supplied partly by\r\n     individual donors, partly by a bequest of Bishop Sparke.\r\n     Amongst the donors are Her Majesty the Queen and the Prince\r\n     Consort. To the bequest of Bishop Sparke the Cathedral is\r\n     indebted for the East windows, and those in the clerestory\r\n     of the Choir, and the fund is not yet exhausted.\r\n\r\n     2. The carved panels above the Stalls in the Choir, now\r\n     amounting to 37, and supplied almost entirely by individual\r\n     donors, at a cost of about L18 each.\r\n\r\n     3. Bishop Alcock's Chapel, restored by Jesus College,\r\n     Cambridge.\r\n\r\n     4. A pinnacle at the south-east corner of the Choir, built\r\n     by A.J.B. Beresford Hope, Esq.\r\n\r\n     5. The magnificent Reredos, presented by J. Dunn-Gardner,\r\n     Esq.\r\n\r\n     6. The contribution of Canon E.B. Sparke towards the\r\n     restoration of the south-west Transept, and that by the two\r\n     Messrs. Evans to the works in the western Tower.\r\n\r\n     7. The Font, presented by Canon Selwyn.\r\n\r\n     8. The Gates of the Choir Aisles, presented by Alan Lowndes,\r\n     Esq. and Dean Peacock.\r\n\r\n     9. The Brass Eagle Lectern, presented by Canon E.B. Sparke.\r\n\r\n     10. The Tombs of Bishop Allen and Dr. Mill.\r\n\r\n     11. A legacy of L100 by the late Mr. Millers, Minor Canon of\r\n     the Cathedral, and a contribution of L300 by his residuary\r\n     legatees, applied to the ceiling of the Nave.\r\n\r\nNeither does the sum mentioned as having been contributed by the\r\npublic include a legacy of L500 from the late Miss Allen, daughter of\r\nBishop Allen, (which has been appropriated to a new pulpit, now in\r\nprogress from the designs of G.G. Scott, Esq.,) and a legacy of equal\r\namount, from Bishop Turton, for the purpose of re-paving the Nave.\r\n\r\nIt may be safely stated that the expense of the works and the gifts\r\nabove specified has not been less than L13,000; the windows alone have\r\ncost nearly L9000. The entire sum already expended upon the Cathedral\r\nwill thus be found to exceed L40,000.\r\n\r\nIn order to bring the Cathedral into such a condition as would appear\r\nsatisfactory to those who have taken part in its restoration, the\r\nfollowing works require to be done:--\r\n\r\n     1. The Nave, Octagon, and Transepts must be paved. Towards\r\n     this work Bishop Turton gave by his will (as before stated)\r\n     the sum of L500. The whole expense will probably be not less\r\n     than L2500.\r\n\r\n     2. The stone-work of the Octagon must be completed by the\r\n     restoration of the pinnacles and parapet. The external\r\n     effect of Alan de Walsingham's Lantern cannot be rightly\r\n     estimated until this restoration has been made; the cost\r\n     will be about L2500.\r\n\r\n     3. The Lantern must be internally decorated. This work,\r\n     though highly necessary for completing the effect of the\r\n     interior, will probably cost not more than L500.\r\n\r\n     4. The Galilee porch requires extensive repair, partly from\r\n     the decay of the Purbeck marble which is largely used in its\r\n     construction, and partly from the unskilful treatment to\r\n     which it has been submitted in former times. A grand\r\n     commencement of this work has been made by Mrs. John Thomas\r\n     Waddington, of Twyford Lodge, Winchester, at whose sole\r\n     expense the portal which forms the eastern side of the\r\n     Galilee is undergoing complete restoration, as a memorial of\r\n     her late husband. The restoration of the remainder of the\r\n     Galilee would probably cost L2000.\r\n\r\n     5. The warming of the Cathedral is another work, for which\r\n     it would be impossible to set down less than L500; probably\r\n     it would cost much more; but this is a work which, if\r\n     considered desirable, may fairly be left to the Dean and\r\n     Chapter.\r\n\r\n     6. The proper lighting of the Cathedral is a matter for\r\n     consideration; this also might be regarded as a work\r\n     devolving upon the capitular body: but when the extremely\r\n     artistic character of the standards or coronae, which such a\r\n     building requires, is taken into account, perhaps it may be\r\n     fairly added to the list of works in which the friends of\r\n     the Cathedral may be asked to co-operate.\r\n\r\nFrom this statement then it would appear that an expenditure of from\r\nL7000 to L8000 would complete the principal necessary works of the\r\nCathedral, with the exception of the rebuilding of the north-west\r\nTransept, which it will probably be deemed desirable to omit from\r\nconsideration, at all events until all the other works specified have\r\nbeen finished.\r\n\r\nCall the sum necessary L7000; this is not much to raise for so good a\r\npurpose; and when it is considered what the effect of the expenditure\r\nof such a sum will be, it seems difficult to believe that the money\r\nwill not be forthcoming.\r\n\r\nThe Dean and Chapter have not shown themselves hitherto insensible to\r\nthe primary claim which the Cathedral has upon them, nor are they\r\nlikely to do so in the completion of the great work which they have\r\nnow had in hand so long. But the Cathedral has claims upon others\r\nbeside the Capitular body. It has claims, which it is believed will be\r\nonce more acknowledged by the wealthy landowners of the Diocese, by\r\nthe Colleges of Cambridge, several of which are intimately connected\r\nwith Ely, and finally by lovers of architectural beauty and\r\necclesiastical propriety throughout the country.\r\n\r\nTo all persons, therefore, who take an interest in Ely Cathedral on\r\nDiocesan or any other grounds, an appeal is now made, and they are\r\nrespectfully urged to make one final effort for the purpose of\r\ncompleting a work which has been so well begun, and hitherto so\r\nprosperously carried out.\r\n\r\nH. GOODWIN.\"\r\n\r\n\"_The Deanery, Ely, January, 1866._\"\r\n\r\nSince the issue of the foregoing memorandum further progress has been\r\nmade in the Restoration of the Cathedral.\r\n\r\n     1. The Nave and Aisles have been re-paved.\r\n\r\n     2. The great Western doors have been repaired and\r\n     decorated.\r\n\r\n     3. The Cathedral has been warmed and lighted.\r\n\r\n     4. Many stained windows have been inserted in the Choir.\r\n\r\n     5. The fourth large window in the Octagon has been filled\r\n     with painted glass.\r\n\r\n     6. The foundation of the south side of the Choir and the\r\n     south-eastern Transept have been underpinned and thoroughly\r\n     repaired.\r\n\r\n     7. The great Western Tower has been braced with iron bands,\r\n     and, it is believed, effectually secured.\r\n\r\n     8. The stone pulpit in the Octagon has been erected.\r\n\r\n     9. Many figures in wood have been placed on the Choir\r\n     screen, the decoration of which is now completed.\r\n\r\n     10. Nine stone figures have been placed in the ancient\r\n     niches in the Octagon; three more are needed to complete the\r\n     design.\r\n\r\n     11. The whole of the carved panels over the stalls in the\r\n     Choir have been completed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeveral works still remain to be effected before the restoration can\r\nbe considered as complete.\r\n\r\n     1. The paving of the Octagon and Transepts. The cost of the\r\n     paving of the Nave has much exceeded the sum anticipated.\r\n     The completion of this work will cost from L1000 to L2000\r\n     additional.\r\n\r\n     2. The re-paving of the aisles of the Choir, a work of no\r\n     pressing importance at present, but which will demand great\r\n     care and consideration whenever it is undertaken.\r\n\r\n     3. The decoration of the blank space of wall beneath the\r\n     great East Window, on which there remain some traces of\r\n     painted figures. If these are found too faint and uncertain\r\n     for restoration, the space might perhaps be covered with a\r\n     copy of some appropriate painting in mosaic.\r\n\r\n     4. The restoration of the exterior of the east end of the\r\n     Choir. Window shafts to the number of about fifty have\r\n     disappeared or are broken. The south-east angle turret has\r\n     been crowned with a pinnacle, but the corresponding turret\r\n     at the north-east still remains truncated. In the eastern\r\n     face of the Choir there are twelve niches, which probably\r\n     were once all filled with figures.\r\n\r\n     5. The restoration of the Galilee is still very incomplete.\r\n     The shafts of Purbeck marble, which are so numerous\r\n     throughout it, require to be repaired or replaced. The\r\n     niches in the west face, intended for figures, are all\r\n     empty.\r\n\r\n     6. The pitch of the roof of the Galilee and of the\r\n     south-western Transept ought to be raised to give their full\r\n     effect to the proportions of the great western Tower.\r\n\r\n     7. The rebuilding of the fallen Transept (north-west) is a\r\n     work much to be desired, perhaps hardly to be anticipated,\r\n     yet surely not to be despaired of.\r\n\r\n     8. The completion of the pinnacles and parapet of the\r\n     Octagon. This is very important to give full effect to the\r\n     central portion of the Cathedral, which suffers unduly in\r\n     estimation from the original design being so imperfectly\r\n     carried out.\r\n\r\n     9. Exterior repairs of Trinity Church, formerly the Lady\r\n     Chapel, which is still under the charge of the Capitular\r\n     body. The cost of restoring the interior decoration of this\r\n     elaborate specimen of art, if it be deemed desirable, may be\r\n     left at present out of calculation.\r\n\r\nA generous offer has been made for the interior decoration of the\r\nLantern and vault of the Octagon, which there is every reason to hope\r\nwill be executed at no distant time.\r\n\r\nC.
