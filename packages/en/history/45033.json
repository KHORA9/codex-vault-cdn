Now‐a‐days\r\nthe journey can be made by almost any one who can command thirty or forty\r\npounds, and the only really grand tour left is that around the world. M.\r\nVerne tells us—inferentially, at all events—that it can be made in eighty\r\ndays, while Puck, as we know, speaks of putting a “girdle round the earth\r\nin forty minutes.” But this statement of the popular French author, like\r\nmany others put forth in his graphic and picturesque works, must be taken\r\n_cum grano salis_. It _could_ be, undoubtedly, but it is very questionable\r\nwhether any one has yet accomplished the feat. Could one ensure the\r\nabsolute “connection” as it is technically termed, of all the steamship\r\nlines which would have to be employed it might be done; or better, one\r\nvessel with grand steaming and sailing qualities might perform the “Voyage\r\nRound the World” in the given time. But M. Jules Verne, it will be\r\nremembered, paints his hero as landing at various points, and as\r\nperforming acts of bravery and chivalry _en route_, such as the episode of\r\nrescuing a Hindoo widow from the Suttee; finding time to lounge and drink\r\nin San Francisco “saloons,” and being attacked by Indians, who would wreck\r\nthe overland train; and still, with all delays, he is able to reach London\r\nin time to win his wager. The very idea of describing a journey round the\r\nworld as an act of eccentricity is peculiarly French. The Englishman who\r\ncan afford to make it is especially envied by his friends, and not\r\nconsidered mildly mad. We have before us a list of books of travel, all\r\npublished within the last few years, and in circulation at the ordinary\r\nlibraries. Thirteen of these works describe voyages round the world, and\r\nthey are mostly the productions of amateur rather than of professional\r\nwriters. So easy, indeed, is the trip now‐a‐days, that two of these\r\nrecords are modestly and deprecatingly described as “Rambles,” while one\r\nof the best of them is the work of a clever and enthusiastic lady,(1)\r\nwhose excellent husband, in and out of Parliament, has earnestly and\r\npersistently studied “poor Jack’s” best interests. This lady is evidently\r\nno fresh‐water sailor, and would put to shame the land‐lubber described in\r\na very old song:—\r\n\r\n  “A tar, all pitch, did loudly bawl, sir,\r\n    ‘All hands aloft!’—‘Sweet sir, not I.\r\n  Though drowning I don’t fear at all, sir,\r\n    I hate a rope exceedingly.’”(2)\r\n\r\nAnother work, by a young lady in her teens, is entitled, “By Land and\r\nOcean; or, the Journals and Letters of a Young Girl who went to South\r\nAustralia with a Lady, thence _alone_ to Victoria, New Zealand, Sydney,\r\nSingapore, China, Japan, and across the Continent of America.” Perhaps the\r\nmost remarkable, however, of modern female travellers is a German lady,(3)\r\nwho left Paris with only seven and a half francs in her pocket, and yet\r\nmanaged to go round the entire globe. It must be admitted that she had\r\nmany friends abroad who helped her, and passed her on to others who could\r\nand did assist her in every way. Still, the voyages and travels she made\r\ndenote the possession of a goodly amount of pluck.\r\n\r\nThe item of speed is of great importance, and may well be considered in\r\nconnection with a voyage round the globe. Verne’s title would have been\r\ndeemed the raving of a lunatic had it been published before the age of\r\nsteam, while in the first days of that great power which has now\r\nrevolutionised the world it would have been regarded as absurd. The wooden\r\nCunarder which, forty years ago, conveyed Charles Dickens on his first\r\ntrip to America took double the ordinary time occupied now in making the\r\nvoyage; and as a journalist has said, between such a vessel “and such\r\nships as the _Arizona_ (Guion line), the _Germanic_ (White Star line), the\r\n_City of Berlin_ (Inman line), and the _Gallia_ (Allan line), there is\r\nundoubtedly not less difference than between the Edinburgh or Glasgow\r\nmail‐coaches and a modern express train.” The _Arizona_ has made the\r\n_round_ trip—that is, the voyage from Queenstown, Ireland, to Sandy Hook,\r\nNew York, and back again—in fifteen days. The Inman line has been\r\nspecially celebrated for quick passages, whilst their “crack” steamer, the\r\n_City of Berlin_, has made the single trip outwards in seven days,\r\nfourteen hours, and twelve minutes, and inwards in seven days, fifteen\r\nhours, and forty‐eight minutes. The _City of Brussels_ and the _City of\r\nRichmond_ have done nearly as well, while other steamships of the same\r\nline have made the trip in a very few hours and minutes more time. Think\r\nof considering minutes in a voyage of 3,000 miles! The magnificent\r\nsteamship named after the Orient Company has made the voyage from England\r\nto Australia in thirty‐seven and a half days, or not very far from half\r\nthe time occupied by other steamships a few years ago. This grand vessel\r\nis said to be only exceeded in size by the _Great Eastern_; she has a\r\ndisplacement of 9,500 tons and indicated horse‐power of 5,400, and carries\r\ncoal enough for her entire voyage—some 3,000 to 4,000 tons. But she is not\r\nto remain unchallenged, for, at the time these pages are being written,\r\nthe Barrow Shipbuilding Company is constructing for the Inman line\r\nAtlantic service a still larger iron vessel, with engines of 8,500 horse‐\r\npower, capable of propelling her at the rate of sixteen or seventeen\r\nknots; she will have four masts and three funnels. And yet another vessel\r\nof equal or greater power has been put on the stocks for the Cunard\r\nCompany. Again, the largest _steel_ steamship, or ship of any kind, has\r\nbeen launched at Dumbarton. She is intended largely for the cattle trade\r\nbetween the River Plate, Canada, and England. She is over 4,000 gross\r\ntonnage, and has been christened the _Buenos Ayrean_. The sums of money\r\ninvested in the construction of these superb vessels are enormous. The\r\n_Orient_ is said to have cost, _without_ her fittings, little less than\r\n£150,000, her engines alone involving the expenditure of one‐third of that\r\namount. And yet a third‐class or steerage ticket to the Antipodes by her\r\ncosts only fifteen guineas, while the emigrant can go out to the United\r\nStates or Canada by almost any one of the finest steamships of the various\r\nAtlantic services for six guineas.\r\n\r\nMany routes might, of course, be taken round the world, England being the\r\neventual goal in all cases. As quaint Sir John Mandeville says, in the\r\nfirst chapter of his “Travels”:—“In the Name of God Glorious and\r\nAllemyghty, he that wil passe over the See to go to the City of Jerusalem,\r\nhe may go by many Weyes, bothe on See and Lande, aftre the Contree that\r\nhee cometh fro: manye of hem comen to an ende. But troweth not that I wil\r\ntelle you alle the Townes and Cytees and Castelles that Men schaslle go\r\nby: for then scholde I make to longe a Tale; but alle only summe Contrees\r\nand most princypalle Stedes that Men schulle gone thorgh, to gon the\r\nrighte Way.”\r\n\r\n“Although,” says Mr. Simpson, the popular artist, in his work entitled\r\n“Meeting the Sun,” “the reference here is to Jerusalem only, yet in the\r\nPrologue he states that he was born in the ‘Town of Seynt Albanes,’ and\r\n‘passed the See in the Yeer of Lord Jesu Christ MCCCXII, in the Day of\r\nSeynt Michelle, and hidne to have ben longe tyme over the See, and have\r\nreign and gon thorgh manye diverse Landes and many Provynces and Kingdomes\r\nand Iles, and have passed throghe Tartarye, Percye, Ermonye, the litylle\r\nand the gret; throghe Lybye, Caldee, and a gret partie of Ethiope, throghe\r\nAmazoyne, Inde the lasse and the more, a gret partie; and thorghe out many\r\nothers Iles, that ben abouten Inde; where dwellen many dyverse Folkes, and\r\nof dyverse Maneres and Lawes, and of dyverse Schappes of Men.’” He adds\r\nfurther on in his “Boke” that going all round the world was not unknown\r\neven before his time.\r\n\r\n“The world is wide,” yet the practical lines for a journey of this sort\r\nare very limited. There is the Siberian overland route, leading by St.\r\nPetersburg, Moscow, from which it goes about straight east through Siberia\r\nto Lake Baikal; and then there is about a month’s journey south, over the\r\nMongolian Desert to Peking; or it may be varied by descending the great\r\nAmoor River, on which the Russians have a number of steamers, to\r\nNicolaiefsk; thence sailing to San Francisco, and home by America and the\r\nAtlantic. “When,” says Mr. Simpson, “the Shah and Baron Reuter have made\r\nrailways through Persia it may add slightly to the choice; perhaps when\r\nRussia civilises the whole of Central Asia it may open up a new route as\r\nfar as China; but till that happy period, unless the traveller is willing,\r\nand at the same time able, to become a dervish, or something of that sort,\r\nlike M. Vambéry, he had better not take the chance of risk in these\r\nregions. Many attempts have been made to pass from India to China, and\r\n_vice versâ_, but as yet no one has succeeded. The difficulties of such an\r\nenterprise are very great, not so much from the races of people as from\r\nthe physical character of that region of the earth. These difficulties\r\ncan, however, be overcome; and in evidence of this, we have perhaps one of\r\nthe most wonderful expeditions of modern times in the journey of the two\r\nJesuit missionaries, Huc and Gabet, from Peking to Lhassa. When they were\r\nordered to leave the capital of the Great Lama, they wished to do so in\r\nthe direction of Calcutta, as being by far the nearest, and, at the same\r\ntime, the easiest way; but in vain. By a policy rigidly insisted upon by\r\nthe Chinese Government, no one is allowed to pass anywhere along the\r\nfrontiers between China and India.” This writer adds, that when travelling\r\nin Tibet he heard of many parties who wished to cross the frontier in that\r\nquarter, with the purpose only of having a few days’ shooting of some\r\nparticular animal which they wanted to bring home; but he never knew of\r\nany one who was able to gratify his wish. One man told him that he had\r\ntaken some pieces of very bright red cloth and other tempting bribes for\r\nthe officials on the Chinese side, but it was all to no purpose. “It is\r\nnot easy to understand why this intense jealousy should exist, but about\r\nthe fact there can be no doubt.”\r\n\r\nBut dismissing any and all ideas of journeying by land through Europe,\r\nAsia, or Africa, our trip will be almost entirely by sea, the trans‐\r\ncontinental route across America being excepted. Practically that route is\r\nto‐day the best if you would reach quickly and pleasantly any part of the\r\nPacific. The great railway is an enormous link binding the Atlantic and\r\nPacific Oceans together. The Suez Canal and the Panama route have been\r\nmentioned in these pages—the first very fully; and place must certainly be\r\nhad for a description of a railroad which is so intimately connected with\r\nthe sea. But first we must reach it.\r\n\r\nThe passage across the “Great Atlantic Ferry” is now one of ease, and in\r\nthe case of first‐class passengers almost luxury. How different was it\r\nabout forty years ago, even on the best steamships of that period! Charles\r\nDickens has graphically described his experiences on board the\r\n_Britannia_, one of the earliest of the Cunard fleet, in one of his least‐\r\nread works(4)—at least in the present generation. The little cupboard\r\ndignified by the name of “state‐room;” the dingy saloon likened “to a\r\ngigantic hearse with windows in the sides;” the melancholy stove at which\r\nthe forlorn stewards were rubbing their hands; the stewardess, whom\r\nDickens blesses “for her piously fraudulent account of January voyages;”\r\nthe excitement before leaving the dock; the captain’s boat and the dapper\r\nlittle captain; the last late mail bags, and the departure, are all\r\nsketched from nature, as the great novelist alone could depict them. And\r\nnow they are off.\r\n\r\n  “‘The sea! the sea! the open sea!\r\n  That is the place where we all wish to be,\r\n  Rolling about so merrily!’\r\n  So all sing and say, by night and by day,\r\n  In the _boudoir_, the street, at the concert, and play,\r\n  In a sort of coxcombical roundelay.\r\n  You may roam through the City, transversely or straight,\r\n  From Whitechapel turnpike to Cumberland Gate,\r\n  And every young lady who thrums a guitar,\r\n  Every mustachioed shopman who smokes a cigar,\r\n    With affected devotion, promulgates his notion,\r\n  Of being a “Rover” and “Child of the Ocean”—\r\n  Whate’er their age, sex, or condition may be,\r\n  They all of them long for the “Wide, wide sea!”\r\n    But however they dote, only set them afloat,\r\n  In any craft bigger at all than a boat,\r\n  Take them down to the Nore, and you’ll see that before\r\n  The “wessel” they “woyage” in has made half her way\r\n  Between Shellness Point and the pier at Herne Bay,\r\n  Let the wind meet the tide in the slightest degree,\r\n  They’ll be all of them heartily sick of the sea!”\r\n\r\nSo says “Ingoldsby,” and it is, no doubt, true of some London Jack Tars\r\nand Cheapside buccaneers, who, on leaving port, are much more nautically\r\n“got up” than any of the crew. These stage sailors become very limp when\r\nthe sea‐water takes the starch out of them. Barham tells us of one Anthony\r\nBlogg:—\r\n\r\n  “So I’ll merely observe, as the water grew rougher\r\n  The more my poor hero continued to suffer,\r\n  Till the sailors themselves cried, in pity, ‘Poor buffer!’”\r\n\r\nThe great steamships of most lines running to distant foreign parts are\r\n_comparatively_ easy and steady in their motions, and there is really more\r\nchance of being attacked by the _mal de mer_ on an English or Irish\r\nChannel boat than there is on the voyage across the Atlantic. The waves in\r\nsuch channels are more cut up and “choppy” than are those of the broad\r\nocean. The employment of the twin‐boat, _Calais‐Douvres_, has mitigated\r\nmuch of the horrors of one of our Channel lines. It is curious to note the\r\nfact that Indians often use a couple of canoes in very much the same\r\nmanner as did the designer of the doubled‐hulled vessel just mentioned.\r\nThe writer has seen, in the Straits of Fuca, natives conveying all their\r\npossessions on the top of planks, placed over and lashed to two canoes.\r\nOne suggestion for the improvement of the steamboat service across the\r\nChannel to France is to construct an enormous vessel, 650 feet long and\r\n150 wide, a ship as long as the _Great Eastern_ and twice her beam, to be\r\npropelled by both paddles and screws. She is to be capable of carrying\r\nseveral trains, and is to have a roofed station on board, with all the\r\nnecessary saloons. Floating platforms are to connect this great steam\r\nferry‐boat with the shore rails, so that it can start or arrive at any\r\ntime of the tide.\r\n\r\n“Are you a good sailor?” asks one passenger of another just after leaving\r\nLiverpool. “Oh, I suppose I’m no worse than anybody else,” is, perhaps,\r\nthe answer; while some are bold enough to answer, “Yes.” But Dickens\r\nnoticed that the first day very few remained long over their wine, and\r\nthat everybody developed an unusual love of the open air. Still, with the\r\nexception of one lady, “who had retired with some precipitation at dinner‐\r\ntime, immediately after being assisted to the finest cut of a very yellow\r\nboiled leg of mutton with very green capers,” there were few invalids the\r\nfirst night.\r\n\r\nThe subject of sea sickness is an unpleasant one, and cannot occupy much\r\nspace here. Every old and many a new traveller has a remedy for it, so\r\npossibly the mention of our mode of prevention may be permitted here. It\r\nis simply for the sufferer to wear a very tight belt round the waist. It\r\nhas been recommended to many fellow‐passengers, and its use has proved\r\ninvariably beneficial. The unusual motion, and sometimes the smells of the\r\nvessel, are the cause of the nausea felt. The tightened belt steadies the\r\nwhole body, and, provided the sufferer be not bilious, soon braces him up\r\ncorporally and mentally. If he _is_ bilious (which he often is on account\r\nof leave‐takings and festivities prior to his departure) the worst thing\r\npossible is generally recommended him—the ordinary brandy on board. _Very_\r\nfine old liqueur cognac in small doses can, however, be taken with\r\nadvantage. An authority (Dr. Chapman) recommends the application of ice,\r\nenclosed in an india‐rubber bag, to the spinal cord. In various\r\ntravellers’ works, marmalade, cayenne pepper, port wine, chutnee, and West\r\nIndia pickles, are prescribed for the malady. The invalid would do much\r\nbetter by eating fresh or canned fruits of a cooling nature. But to return\r\nto the voyage. Dickens describes the first night at sea in feeling\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n“To one accustomed to such scenes,” says he, “this is a very striking time\r\non shipboard. Afterwards, and when its novelty had long worn off, it never\r\nceased to have a peculiar interest and charm for me. The gloom through\r\nwhich the great black mass holds its direct and certain course; the\r\nrushing water, plainly heard, but dimly seen; the broad white glistening\r\ntrack that follows in the vessel’s wake; the men on the look‐out forward,\r\nwho would be scarcely visible against the dark sky but for their blotting\r\nout some score of glistening stars; the helmsman at the wheel, with the\r\nilluminated card before him shining, a speck of light amidst the darkness,\r\nlike something sentient and of Divine intelligence; the melancholy sighing\r\nof the wind through block and rope and chain; the gleaming forth of light\r\nfrom every crevice, nook, and tiny piece of glass about the decks, as\r\nthough the ship were filled with fire in hiding, ready to burst through\r\nany outlet, wild with its resistless power of death and ruin.”\r\n\r\nIrresistibly comic, as well as true, is his description of the ship during\r\nbad weather. “It is the third morning. I am awakened out of my sleep by a\r\ndismal shriek from my wife, who demands to know whether there’s any\r\ndanger. I rouse myself and look out of bed. The water‐jug is plunging and\r\nleaping like a lively dolphin; all the smaller articles are afloat, except\r\nmy shoes, which are stranded on a carpet‐bag, high and dry, like a couple\r\nof coal‐barges. Suddenly I see them spring into the air, and behold the\r\nlooking‐glass, which is nailed to the wall, sticking fast upon the\r\nceiling. At the same time the door entirely disappears, and a new one is\r\nopened in the floor. Then I begin to comprehend that the state‐room is\r\nstanding on its head.\r\n\r\n“Before it is possible to make any arrangement at all compatible with this\r\nnovel state of things the ship rights. Before one can say ‘Thank Heaven!’\r\nshe wrongs again. Before one can cry she _is_ wrong, she seems to have\r\nstarted forward, and to be a creature actively running of its own accord,\r\nwith broken knees and failing legs, through every variety of hole and\r\npitfall, and stumbling constantly. * * * And so she goes on staggering,\r\nheaving, wrestling, leaping, diving, jumping, pitching, throbbing,\r\nrolling, and rocking, and going through all these movements sometimes by\r\nturns, and sometimes all together, until one feels disposed to roar for\r\nmercy.”\r\n\r\nDickens gives a droll account of a ridiculous situation in which he was\r\nplaced. “About midnight we shipped a sea, which forced its way through the\r\nskylights, burst open the doors above, and came raging and roaring down\r\ninto the ladies’ cabin, to the unspeakable consternation of my wife and a\r\nlittle Scotch lady—who, by the way, had previously sent a message to the\r\ncaptain by the stewardess, requesting him, with her compliments, to have a\r\nsteel conductor immediately attached to the top of every mast and to the\r\nchimney, in order that the ship might not be struck by lightning. They and\r\nthe handmaid before‐mentioned, being in such ecstasies of fear that I\r\nscarcely knew what to do with them, I naturally bethought myself of some\r\nrestorative or comfortable cordial; and nothing better occurring to me at\r\nthe moment than hot brandy‐and‐water, I procured a tumblerful without\r\ndelay. It being impossible to stand or sit without holding on, they were\r\nall heaped together in one corner of a long sofa—a fixture extending\r\nentirely across the cabin—where they clung to each other, in momentary\r\nexpectation of being drowned. When I approached this place with my\r\nspecific, and was about to administer it, with many consolatory\r\nexpressions, to the nearest sufferer, what was my dismay to see them all\r\nroll slowly down to the other end! And when I staggered to that end, and\r\nheld out the glass once more, how immensely baffled were my good\r\nintentions by the ship giving another lurch, and their all rolling back\r\nagain! I suppose I dodged them up and down this sofa for at least a\r\nquarter of an hour, without reaching them once; and by the time I did\r\ncatch them the brandy‐and‐water was diminished by constant spilling to a\r\ntea‐spoonful.”\r\n\r\nWhat a difference to the accommodations and comfort of most modern\r\nsteamships, with their luxurious saloons placed amidships, where there is\r\nleast motion; their spacious and airy state‐rooms, warmed by steam, water\r\nlaid on, and fitted with electric bells; their music‐room with piano and\r\nharmonium, their smoking‐room, bath‐rooms, library, and even barber’s\r\nshop. The table is as well served as at the best hotel ashore, and the\r\n_menu_ for the day is as extensive as that of a first‐class restaurant,\r\nwhile everything that may be required in the drinkables, from modest\r\nbottled beer to rare old wine, is to be obtained from the steward. And\r\nprovided that the passengers assimilate reasonably well, there will be\r\nenjoyable games, music, and possibly private theatricals and other\r\nregularly organised entertainments. The idea of a “Punch and Judy” in the\r\nmiddle of the Atlantic seems rather funny; but we have known of an\r\ninstance in which even this form of amusement has been provided on board a\r\ngreat steamship! On long voyages it is not by any means uncommon for some\r\none to start a MS. daily or weekly journal, to which many of the\r\npassengers contribute. Such have often been published afterwards for\r\nprivate circulation, as affording reminiscences of a pleasant voyage.\r\n\r\nThen there is the pleasure of discovering “a sail in sight,” and of\r\nwatching it grow larger by degrees as the vessels approach each other. The\r\n“look out” is kept by some passengers almost as persistently as by the\r\nsailors detailed for the purpose. Perhaps, again, the captain or officers\r\nhave let out the fact that they should pass one of their own or some rival\r\ncompany’s vessel that day. How many eyes are strained after that first\r\nmere thread of smoke on the horizon! What ringing cheers as the two great\r\nsteamships near each other! What an amount of anxious enthusiasm when it\r\nis known that a boat is coming off from the other vessel, and what\r\nfeverish excitement to learn all the news! They may have been seven or\r\neight days without any, and in that time what may not have occurred in the\r\nhistory of nations!\r\n\r\nThen, again, the sea itself, in its varying beauty or grandeur, has for\r\nmost travellers a great interest. Is there not a chance of seeing an\r\niceberg, a whale, or even the great sea serpent?\r\n\r\nIn March‐April, 1869, the writer crossed the Atlantic in splendid weather.\r\nThe ocean was, for the ten days occupied on the passage, almost literally\r\nas calm as a lake; even the lady passengers emerged from their cabins two\r\nor three days before they would otherwise have ventured forth. Among them\r\nwas one lady seventy‐five years of age, who was running away—so she\r\ninformed the passengers—from her husband, and going to join her children\r\nin the States. This female had “stood it” for fifty years, but now, she\r\nsaid, she was going to end her days in peace. Here was a champion of\r\n“woman’s rights!” Alas! on arrival in New York there was no one to receive\r\nher, and she was taken back on board the steamer. What became of her\r\nafterwards we know not.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE STEERAGE OF AN ATLANTIC STEAMSHIP FORTY YEARS AGO.]\r\n\r\nThe woes of steerage passengers have been graphically described by Charles\r\nDickens. He tells us that “unquestionably any man who retained his\r\ncheerfulness among the steerage accommodations of that noble and fast‐\r\nsailing packet, the _Screw_, was solely indebted to his own resources, and\r\nshipped his good humour like his provisions, without any contribution or\r\nassistance from the owners. A dark, low, stifling cabin, surrounded by\r\nberths filled to overflowing with men, women, and children, in various\r\nstages of sickness and misery, is not the liveliest place of assembly at\r\nany time; but when it is so crowded, as the steerage cabin of the _Screw_\r\nwas every passage out, that mattrasses and beds are heaped on the floor,\r\nto the extinction of everything like comfort, cleanliness, and decency, it\r\nis liable to operate not only as a pretty strong barrier against\r\namiability of temper, but as a positive encourager of selfish and rough\r\nhumours.” Dickens follows with a dismally correct picture of the\r\npassengers, with their shabby clothes, paltry stores of poor food and\r\nother supplies, and their wealth of family. He adds that every kind of\r\nsuffering bred of poverty, illness, banishment, and tedious voyaging in\r\nbad weather was crammed into that confined space, and the picture, almost\r\nrevolting in its naked truthfulness, was not overdrawn in those days. It\r\ncould not be written, however, of any steerage whatever in our times, for\r\npartly from governmental care, partly from the general improvement in\r\nmeans of travel, partly from competition and the praiseworthy desire of\r\nthe owners to earn a high character for their vessels’ accommodations, the\r\nsteerage of to‐day is _comparatively_ decent; although it is not yet that\r\nwhich it should be, nor has the progress of improvement kept anything like\r\npace with railway accommodation of the cheaper kind. Yet one would think\r\nit to the interest of owners(5) to make the steerage an endurable place of\r\ntemporary abode.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 nearly 118,000 steerage passengers left the port of Liverpool for\r\nthe United States. It should be noted that this was from _one_ port,\r\nundeniably the principal one for emigration, but still by no means the\r\nonly British one used for that purpose. Observe further that it was for\r\nAmerica alone that these emigrants were bound. According to the United\r\nStates census of 1870, there were at that time 5,600,000 human beings in\r\nthe country who were foreign born, and this number has since gone on\r\nincreasing to a very large extent. Nine‐tenths of them at the least\r\ncrossed the Great Ferry in ships bearing the Union Jack, and of these,\r\nthree‐fourths or more crossed as steerage passengers. Hence the importance\r\nof the question.\r\n\r\nLatterly a considerable amount of attention has been given to the sub‐\r\ndivision of the steerage space, so that, when practicable, friends and\r\nfamilies may remain together. Married people and single women have now\r\nseparate quarters. The sleeping accommodations are the weak point. They\r\nare simply rough wooden berths, and the passenger has to furnish his own\r\nbedding, as well as plate, mug, knife, fork, spoon, and water‐can. The\r\nprovisions are now‐a‐days generally ample, and on some lines are provided\r\n_ad libitum_. The bill of fare is pretty usually as follows. Breakfast:\r\ncoffee, fresh bread or biscuit, and butter, _or_ oatmeal porridge and\r\nmolasses; Dinner: soup, beef or pork, and potatoes—fish may be substituted\r\nfor the meat; on Sunday pudding is often added; Tea: tea, biscuit and\r\nbutter. Three quarts of fresh water are allowed daily. A passenger who has\r\na few shillings to spend can often obtain a few extras from the steward,\r\nand many, of course, take a small stock of the minor luxuries of life on\r\nboard with him.\r\n\r\nTo those of small means who are contemplating emigration, the\r\n“Intermediate” (second‐class) on board some of the Atlantic steamers to\r\nthe States and Canada can be commended. For a couple of guineas over the\r\nsteerage rates, excellent state‐rooms, generally with four to six berths\r\nin each, furnished with bedding and lavatory arrangements, are provided.\r\nThe intermediate passenger has a separate general saloon, and the table is\r\nwell provided with good plain living. As the steerage passenger has to\r\nprovide so many things for himself, it is almost as cheap to travel\r\nsecond‐class.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: AT DINNER IN THE FIRST‐CLASS DINING SALOON OF AN ATLANTIC\r\n                        STEAMSHIP DURING A STORM.]\r\n\r\nAlmost every reader will remember Martin Chuzzlewit and Mark Tapley on\r\nboard the wretched _Screw_. How, for example, “the latter awoke with a dim\r\nidea that he was dreaming of having gone to sleep in a four‐post bedstead\r\nwhich had turned bottom upwards in the course of the night,” for which\r\nthere seemed some reason, as “the first objects he recognised when he\r\nopened his eyes were his own heels looking down at him, as he afterwards\r\nobserved, from a nearly perpendicular elevation.” “This is the first time\r\nas ever I stood on my head all night,” observed Mark.\r\n\r\nThe lesson taught by Dickens regarding the necessity of keeping up one’s\r\nspirits on board ship, and better, of helping to keep up those of others,\r\nas exemplified by poor Tapley, is a very important one. If anything will\r\n_test_ character, life on board a crowded ship will do it. Who that has\r\nread can ever forget Mark, when he calls to the poor woman to “hand over\r\none of them young ’uns, according to custom.” “‘I wish you’d get\r\nbreakfast, Mark, instead of worrying with people who don’t belong to you,’\r\nobserved Martin, petulantly.” “‘All right,’ said Mark; ‘_she’ll_ do that.\r\nIt’s a fair division of labour, sir. I wash her boys and she makes our\r\ntea. I never _could_ make tea, but any one can wash a boy.’ The woman, who\r\nwas delicate and ill, felt and understood his kindness—as well she might,\r\nfor she had been covered every night with his great coat, while he had for\r\nhis own bed the bare boards and a rug.” “If a gleam of sun shone out of\r\nthe dark sky,” continues Dickens, “down Mark tumbled into the cabin, and\r\npresently up he came again with a woman in his arms, or half‐a‐dozen\r\nchildren, or a man, or a bed, or a saucepan, or a basket, or something\r\nanimate or inanimate that he thought would be the better for the air. If\r\nan hour or two of fine weather in the middle of the day tempted those who\r\nseldom or never came on deck at other times to crawl into the long‐boat,\r\nor lie down upon the spare spars and try to eat, there in the centre of\r\nthe group was Mr. Tapley, handing about salt beef and biscuit, or\r\ndispensing tastes of grog, or cutting up the children’s provisions with\r\nhis pocket‐knife for their greater ease and comfort, or reading aloud from\r\na venerable newspaper, or singing some roaring old song to a select party,\r\nor writing the beginnings of letters to their friends at home for people\r\nwho couldn’t write, or cracking jokes with the crew, or nearly getting\r\nblown over the side, or emerging half‐drowned from a shower of spray, or\r\nlending a hand somewhere or other: but always doing something for the\r\ngeneral entertainment.”\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: NEW YORK BAY, LOOKING ACROSS TO STATEN ISLAND.]\r\n\r\nDickens drew his picture from life, and although an extreme case, there\r\nare many Mark Tapleys yet to be met. And indeed, unless the emigrant can\r\nremain happy and jovial amid the unmistakable hardships of even the best\r\nregulated steerage, he had better have stopped at home. If he can stand\r\nthem well, he is of the stuff that will make a good colonist or settler,\r\nready to “rough it” at any time. Before leaving the subject of steerage\r\npassengers and emigrants, it may be well to note that the United States\r\nGovernment does all in its power on their arrival in New York to protect\r\nthem from imposition and furnish them with trustworthy information. At the\r\ndepôt at Castle Gardens, where third‐class passengers land, there are\r\ninterpreters, money‐changers, railway‐ticket offices, and rooms for their\r\naccommodation; and it is very much their own fault if they slide into the\r\npitfalls of New York—for New York _has_ pitfalls, like every other great\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThe risks of the voyage across the Atlantic are not really as great as\r\nthose of ships passing southwards through the Bay of Biscay, which is the\r\nterror of passengers to Australia, India, China, and other points in the\r\nOrient. At the beginning of 1880 the fine S.S. _Chimborazo_ returned with\r\ndifficulty to Plymouth, three persons having been washed overboard, and\r\none killed from injuries received on board. Off Ushant a formidable gale\r\narose, and the vessel began to roll heavily, while on the following\r\nmorning the storm had become a hurricane, and the water was taken on board\r\nand below in volumes, threatening a fate similar to that experienced by\r\nthe _London_. Just before 9 A.M. an enormous sea broke over the ship,\r\nheeling her over and washing the deck with resistless force. The steam\r\nlaunch, six heavy boats, the smoking room, saloon companion, and\r\neverything on the spar deck, were in three seconds carried overboard among\r\nthe breakers as though they were mere children’s toys, while, in addition\r\nto the losses of life already mentioned, seventeen other passengers were\r\nmore or less injured. Just before the ship was struck the smoking‐room was\r\nfull of passengers, who were requested by the captain to leave it to give\r\nplace to some helpless sheep who were floundering about, and to this fact\r\nthey owed their lives. “As,” said a leading journal, “the stricken ship\r\nentered Plymouth Harbour on Tuesday morning, her shattered stanchions and\r\nskylights, her damaged steering apparatus, and the heap of wreckage lying\r\nupon her deck, proclaimed the fury of the tremendous ordeal through which\r\nshe had passed, and awakened many a heartfelt and silent prayer of\r\ngratitude among her rescued passengers, as they contemplated the evidences\r\nof the peril from which they had so narrowly escaped.” It is in moments\r\nsuch as these that the poverty of human words is keenly felt. There can be\r\nno doubt that, but for the excellent seamanship displayed by Captain\r\nTrench and his officers there would have been a sadder story to relate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   OCEAN TO OCEAN.—THE CONNECTING LINK.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Great Trans‐Continental Railway—New York to Chicago—Niagara in\r\n    Winter—A Lady’s Impressions—A Pullman Dining Car—Omaha—“The Great\r\n     Muddy”—Episodes of Railway Travel—Rough Roads—Indian Attempts at\r\n    Catching Trains—Ride on a Snow Plough—Sherman—Female Vanity in the\r\n         Rocky Mountains—Soaped Rails—The Great Plains—Summer and\r\n           Winter—The Prairie on Fire—A Remarkable Bridge—Coal\r\n      Discoveries—The “Buttes”—The Gates of Mormondom—Echo and Weber\r\n    Cañons—The Devil’s Gate—Salt Lake—Ride in a “Mud Waggon”—The City\r\n     of the Saints—Mormon Industry—A Tragedy of Former Days—Mountain\r\n         Meadow Massacre—The “Great Egg‐shell”—Theatre—The Silver\r\n      State—“Dead Heads”—Up in the Sierra Nevada—Alpine Scenery—The\r\n     Highest Newspaper Office in the World—“Snowed up”—Cape Horn—Down\r\n    to the Fruitful Plains—Sunny California—Sacramento—Oakland and the\r\n       Golden City—Recent Opinions of Travellers—San Francisco as a\r\n                            Port—Whither Away?\r\n\r\n\r\nSufficient mention of New York has already been made in this work. The\r\ntourist or traveller bound round the world, viâ the great trans‐\r\ncontinental railway and San Francisco, has at starting from the commercial\r\nmetropolis of America, and as far as Omaha, a choice of routes, all the\r\nfares being identical for a “through ticket” to the Pacific. You may go\r\namong the Pennsylvanian mountains and valleys, and catch many a glimpse of\r\nthe coal and coal “ile” fields; the country generally being thickly\r\nwooded. The Pennsylvania, Pittsburg, and Fort Wayne Railway passes through\r\nreally grand scenery, and the construction of the road has been a work of\r\ngreat difficulty, involving extensive cuttings and embankments and long\r\ntunnels. The road takes a serpentine course among the mountains, and at\r\none point, known as the “Horse‐shoe Bend,” the line curves round so much\r\nthat it almost meets itself again. A train following your own appears to\r\nbe going in the opposite direction. The only city of any importance on\r\nthis route, before Chicago is reached, is Pittsburg, the busy, coaly,\r\nsooty, and grimy—a place reminding one of Staffordshire, and abounding in\r\niron and cutlery works. It is situated among really charming scenery, near\r\nwhere the Monongahela, Alleghany, and Ohio rivers meet, and is an ugly\r\nblot among the verdant and peaceful surroundings. After leaving Pittsburg\r\nthe railroad passes through a charmingly fresh and fruitful country,\r\nwatered by the Ohio. “Long stretches of green meadows, shut in by hill and\r\ndale, shady nooks, cosy farm‐houses, and handsome villas, steamers,\r\nbarges, boats, and timber‐rafts—almost as large as those famous Rhine\r\nrafts—on the river, make up a varied and most attractive scene.” Next you\r\nreach Indiana, a country of fairly good soil, bad swamps, fearful fever\r\nand ague, and an indolent and shiftless people. In general terms it is a\r\ngood country to leave.\r\n\r\nBut the tourist’s popular route from New York to Chicago is that briefly\r\nknown as “The Great Central.” At Niagara it passes over a bridge spanning\r\nthe river below the great Falls, where a tolerable view is obtainable.\r\nMost tourists naturally stop a day or two at the Falls, where there are\r\nfine hotels. They have been so often described that every schoolboy knows\r\nall about them. They are especially worth seeing under their winter\r\naspect, when miniature icebergs and floes are falling, crashing, and\r\ngrinding with the water. Below the Falls these will bank up to a\r\nconsiderable height, and the river is in places completely frozen over.\r\nFrom the rocks huge stalactites of hundreds of tons of ice depend. The\r\ncontrast of the dashing green waters with the crystal ice and virgin snow\r\naround is very beautiful. Some idea of the volume of water may be gathered\r\nfrom this fact: the Niagara River a mile and a half above the Falls is two\r\nand a half miles wide, and is there very deep. At the Falls all this water\r\nis narrowed to about 800 yards in breadth. A traveller already\r\nmentioned(6) thus describes her impressions:—\r\n\r\n“Nor do I think that the most powerful imagination can, with its greatest\r\neffort, attain even an approximate notion of the awful sublimity of this\r\nnatural wonder. Like all other stupendous things which the mind has been\r\nunaccustomed to measure and to contemplate, Niagara requires time to grow\r\nupon one. The mind also demands time to struggle up to its dimensions, and\r\ntime to gather up its harmonies into the mighty tones which finally fill\r\nthe soul with their overwhelming cadences, and whose theme, ever‐varying\r\nbut still the same—as in the hands of a Handel or a Beethoven—thunders\r\nthrough the whole extent of one’s being—‘Almighty Power!’\r\n\r\n“The chief impression produced upon the mind by Niagara is the perpetuity\r\nof immeasurable force and grandeur. This it is which lends such a strange\r\nfascination to the Falls; however pressingly one is desirous of getting\r\naway, one is obliged to turn back again, and yet again, like the disturbed\r\nneedle to the magnetic pole. There is nothing in the way of natural\r\nscenery which has stamped itself so clearly, indelibly, and awfully on my\r\nmind as this gigantic magnificence; as this mighty body of waters, gliding\r\nstealthily but rapidly on its onward course above the Falls, springing\r\nforward more wildly, more exultingly, as it nears the brink, until it\r\nleaps over into the abyss to swell the mighty canticle, which, for\r\nthousands and thousands of years, by day and by night, through every\r\nseason, has ascended in tones of subdued thunder to the Creator’s throne.”\r\n\r\nPassing over all intermediate points, the traveller at length reaches the\r\nGarden City, Chicago. This, which used to be counted a western city—it is\r\n900 miles west of New York—is now considered almost an eastern one. And it\r\nmust be remembered that this place of half a million souls is a port.\r\nLarge sailing‐vessels and steamers enter and leave it daily, and through\r\nLake Michigan and the chain of other lakes can reach the ocean direct.\r\nThere are miles on miles of wharfs, and it is generally considered one of\r\nthe “livest” business places in America. Handsomely laid‐out and built,\r\nthe city now hardly bears a trace of the terrific conflagration which in\r\n1871 laid three‐fourths of the finest streets in ruins.\r\n\r\nFrom Chicago to Omaha the various routes have little to interest the\r\nordinary traveller, and so, while speeding on together, let us dine in a\r\nPullman hotel car. On entering you will be presented with a bewildering\r\nbill of fare, commencing with soups and finishing with ice‐cream and black\r\ncoffee. The dinner is served on little separate tables, while the purity\r\nof the cloths and table napkins, the brightness of the plate, and the\r\ncrystal clearness of the glass‐ware, leave nothing to desire. You can have\r\na glass of iced water, for they have an ice‐cellar; you can obtain\r\nanything, from a bottle of beer to one of Burgundy, port, or champagne;\r\nand cigars are also kept “en board;” while at the particular point\r\nindicated you will not pay more than seventy‐five cents (about three\r\nshillings) for the dinner. It must be admitted that the liquid\r\nrefreshments are generally very dear: a “quarter” (_i.e._, twenty‐five\r\ncents, the fourth of a dollar) for any small drink, fifty cents for a very\r\nsmall bottle of Bass, and wines expensive in proportion. Still you dine at\r\nyour ease and leisure, instead of rushing out with a crowd at the “eating\r\nstations,” where the trains usually stop three times a day. We have the\r\nauthority of Mr. W. F. Rae for stating that “no royal personage can be\r\nmore comfortably housed than the occupant of a Pullman car, provided the\r\ncar be an hotel one.”(7)\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: A PULLMAN RAILWAY CAR.]\r\n\r\nAt Omaha, on the Missouri, the Pacific Railway _proper_ commences,\r\nalthough the various New York and other lines, as we have seen, connect\r\nwith it. The river, irreverently known on the spot as “The Great Muddy,”\r\nfrom the colour of its water and its numerous sand and mud banks, is\r\ncrossed at this point by a fine bridge. _Apropos_ of the said banks, which\r\nare constantly shifting, a story is told of a countryman who, years ago,\r\nbefore the age of steam ferries, wanted to cross the Missouri near this\r\npoint. He did not see his way till he observed a sand‐bank “washing‐up,”\r\nas they call it, to the surface of the water near the shore on which he\r\nstood. He jumped on it, and it shifted so rapidly that it took him clear\r\nacross the river, and he was able to land on the opposite side! The story\r\nis an exaggerated version of fact. The shifting sand‐banks make navigation\r\nperilous, and good river pilots command a high figure.\r\n\r\nThe literature of the railway has hardly yet been attempted. It is true\r\nthat scarcely a day passes without something of interest transpiring in\r\nconnection therewith: now some grand improvement, now a terrible accident\r\nor narrow escape, and now again the opening of some important line. The\r\nhumours of railroad travel—good and bad—often enliven the pages of our\r\ncomic journals, while the strictly mechanical aspect of the subject is\r\nfully treated in technical papers. But the facts remain that all this is\r\nof a transient nature, and that the railway can hardly be said yet to have\r\na literature of its own.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: MADISON STREET, CHICAGO.]\r\n\r\nThe following episodes mainly refer to the grand railway under notice,\r\nwhich is by all odds the longest direct road on the surface of the globe.\r\nFrom New York to San Francisco the distance by this railway is 3,300\r\nmiles, and the ticket for the through journey is about two feet long! This\r\nwould be more justly described as a series of tickets or coupons. The\r\nwriter has crossed the American continent twice by this route, his first\r\ntrip having been made on its completion in 1869, when, as correspondent of\r\na daily journal, he had ample facilities for examining it in detail. In\r\nChicago he had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Pullman, who kindly furnished\r\nhim with information which in those days, at all events, was new to the\r\nBritish public. He was even then trying to get his famous carriages\r\nintroduced into England; as events proved, it took him several years to\r\nget them even tested. In this connection he is credited with a _bon mot_.\r\nHe was speaking of our land in the highest terms, but, like many\r\nAmericans, did not think we adopted new ideas with sufficient readiness.\r\n“It is a grand country,” said he, “a grand country. But you have to be\r\nborn _very_ young there;” meaning that otherwise you might grow grey in\r\nthe consummation of even a promising scheme.\r\n\r\nWhen the writer first crossed the continent the railway was very much in\r\nthe rough. Rails laid at the rate of seven, and, on one occasion, _ten_\r\nmiles a day, can hardly be implicitly relied upon; much of the road was\r\nflimsily ballasted, and many of the bridges were temporary wooden\r\nstructures of a shaky order. The train had sometimes to literally crawl\r\nalong; passengers would often get off and walk some distance ahead, easily\r\nbeating the locomotives, and be found seated on the boulders at the side\r\nof the road, having had time for a quarter of an hour’s smoke. Mr. James\r\nMortimer Murphy, in his “Rambles in Northwestern America,” gives some\r\nsimilar experiences on a still rougher line on which he travelled from\r\nWallula, on the Columbia River, to a point in Washington Territory. The\r\nrailroad was only fifteen miles long, and had wooden rails. Having secured\r\nan interview with the president, secretary, conductor, and brakesman of\r\nthe road—represented by one and the same individual—he was booked as a\r\npassenger, and placed on some rough iron in an open truck, with\r\ninstructions to cling to the sides, and be most careful not to stand on\r\nthe floor if he cared anything about his limbs. The miserable little\r\nengine gave a grunt or two, several wheezy puffs, a cat‐like scream, and\r\nfinally got the train under weigh, proceeding at the headlong speed of two\r\nmiles an hour, “rocking,” says the narrator, “like a canoe in a cross sea.\r\nThe gentleman who represented all the train officials did not get on the\r\ntrain, but told the engineer to go on, and he would overtake him in the\r\ncourse of an hour. Before I had proceeded half a mile I saw why I was not\r\npermitted to stand on the floor of the truck, for a piece of hoop‐iron,\r\nwhich covered the wooden rails in some places, curled up into what is\r\ncalled a ‘snake head,’ and pushed through the wood with such force that it\r\nnearly stopped the train. After this was withdrawn the engine resumed its\r\ncourse, and at the end of seven hours hauled one weary passenger, with\r\neyes made sore from the smoke, and coat and hat nearly burnt off by the\r\nsparks, into a station composed of a rude board shanty, through whose\r\napertures the wind howled, having made the entire distance of fifteen\r\nmiles in that time.” The drivers of the passing “prairie schooners,” as\r\nthe waggons drawn by eight or more pairs of mules or oxen are called,\r\noccasionally challenged the president of the line to run a race with them\r\nin his old machine; but he scorned their offers, and kept quietly walking\r\nbeside his train. This eccentric railway has since been superseded by one\r\nmuch more desirable, while in justice to the great line referred to, it\r\nmust be said that it is now, and long has been, in admirable condition,\r\nand that it is crossed by numerous express, emigrant, and freight trains\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\nThe Indians have never given the trans‐continental railway companies much\r\ntrouble since the completion of the lines. Early in its history a story is\r\ntold, however, of the Chien or Dog Indians, from whom the town of Cheyenne\r\ntakes its name. They had a strong prejudice against the iron horse with\r\nthe fiery eyes, and determined to vanquish him. Some thirty of them\r\nmounted their ponies, and urging them up the line, valiantly charged a\r\ncoming train. It is perhaps unnecessary to state that fragments of defunct\r\nred men were found shortly afterwards strewed about the road, and that the\r\ntribe has not since repeated the experiment. Perhaps better is the true\r\nstory of the Piute Indians of Nevada, who tried to catch a train, and\r\nfound that they had “caught a Tartar” instead. Annoyed by the snorting\r\nmonster, they laid in ambush, and as it approached dexterously threw a\r\nlasso, such as is used for catching cattle, over the “smoke stack,” or\r\nfunnel of the locomotive, while a number of them held on to the other end\r\nof the rope. The engine went on its way unharmed; but it is said that the\r\neccentric gymnastics performed by the Indians, as they were pulled at\r\ntwenty‐five miles an hour over the rocks and boulders at the side of the\r\ntrack, were more amusing to the passengers than to themselves.\r\n\r\nMost readers will have heard of the celebrated “Cape Horn,” high up among\r\nthe Sierra Nevada mountains, where the Central Pacific Railway rounds the\r\nedge of a fearful cliff. The traveller is there between six and seven\r\nthousand feet above the sea level; and at the particular point of which\r\nmention is now made there is a precipice descending almost perpendicularly\r\nto a depth of fifteen hundred feet. Above, again, rise the walls of the\r\nsame rocky projection to a still greater height. The sublimity of the spot\r\nis undoubted, but as regards the passengers, the ridiculous too often\r\nappears upon the scene. Most ladies and many timid men audibly shudder at\r\nthis juncture, and after taking a hasty glance downwards at the turbulent\r\nTruckee River dashing round the base of the precipice, retire to the other\r\nside of the carriage, where there is nothing but the prospect of a rough‐\r\nhewn rocky wall a foot or so off the carriages. Is it with the idea of\r\nballasting the train? Perhaps like the ostrich, they think themselves out\r\nof danger, when danger is hidden!\r\n\r\nNot very far from the above spot, on the western side of the mountains,\r\nwhere the grades are particularly steep, an accident occurred a few years\r\nago which had more of the comic element than the serious. A train,\r\nproceeding at a rapid rate, broke in two, the locomotive and several\r\ncarriages dashing on, while the second half of the train followed at\r\nslower speed. At length the foremost car of this part of the train left\r\nthe rails, and breaking off from the couplings, turned bottom upwards on\r\nthe embankment, just coming to an anchor at the edge of a ravine, into\r\nwhich, had it fallen, no one could have been saved. A husband of\r\nFalstaffian proportions was in one of the foremost carriages which had\r\nproceeded with the locomotive, and as soon as they stopped he scrambled\r\noff, running back to the scene of the accident, hurrying and stumbling and\r\nshinning himself on and over the rough roadway and obtrusive sleepers, for\r\nhis wife was in one of the hindmost cars, and he feared the worst. At last\r\nhe approached the wreck, where his wife was seen standing, calmly waving a\r\nhandkerchief, she having climbed out through one of the windows, almost\r\nunhurt. She had just been tending the one damaged person of the whole\r\nnumber. That individual, in his anxiety to grasp something as the carriage\r\noverturned, had seized on the hot stove, and was badly, though not\r\nseriously, burned.\r\n\r\nNot altogether a nuisance is an institution inseparably connected with\r\nAmerican trains—the peripatetic boy who offers you one minute a newspaper,\r\nthe next a novel, and then anything from a cigar or a box of sweetmeats to\r\na “prize package.” These latter are of all values, from a twenty‐five cent\r\npackage of stationery to a bound book at a dollar and a half, about one in\r\na hundred of which may possibly contain a money prize. The writer had been\r\na good customer as regards paper‐covered novels, and his plan was to sell\r\nthe books back at half‐price, then purchasing a new story, and this, of\r\ncourse, suited the boys well enough. In consequence of these and other\r\npurchases, he was one day allowed to win a five‐dollar “greenback” in a\r\nprize package. He was somewhat annoyed afterwards to find that he had been\r\nused really as the “decoy duck.” The news of his winnings flew through the\r\ncarriage, and even through the train, and the enterprising youngster soon\r\nsold a dozen or so of the same packages, and, it may be added, the same\r\nnumber of purchasers. There were no more prizes that day!\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: ON THE PACIFIC RAILWAY: A SCENE IN THE SIERRA NEVADA\r\n                               MOUNTAINS.]\r\n\r\nA newspaper is published regularly on the overland trains of the Pacific\r\nRailway. There are telegraph stations everywhere on the route, and the\r\nlatest news is handed “aboard” to the editor, leader‐writer, compositor,\r\nand pressman—represented by, or condensed into, one and the same\r\nindividual—as soon as the train arrives, and is immediately “set up” and\r\nprinted. Thus “specials,” “extra specials,” and “special extra specials”\r\nfollow one another in rapid succession, and keep the train alive with\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nA term which has come into vogue here originated on the Pacific Railway\r\nduring the writer’s stay in California. A terrible accident occurred near\r\nOakland, in which one train of the long cars usual in the United States\r\nmet and literally “telescoped” another. The expression was used in a\r\nrather curious way in San Francisco for some time afterwards. If a\r\nbusiness man in a hurry ran into another person—say, for example, coming\r\nround a corner—the latter would ejaculate, “Hi! are you trying to\r\n_telescope_ a fellow?”\r\n\r\nThe writer will not soon forget his ride from Laramie to Sherman, a\r\nstation on one of the ridges of the Rocky Mountains, which the Pacific\r\nRailway crosses at an altitude of over 8,000 feet. Armed with a pass from\r\nthe company, the courteous station‐master at the former place made no\r\nobjection to his accompanying a locomotive with a snow‐plough attached in\r\nfront, then starting ahead of the regular train. The plough was a rough\r\nspecimen of its kind, in form not greatly unlike the ram of an ironclad,\r\nand was constructed of sheet‐iron, covering a strong wooden frame. But it\r\ndid its work efficiently, scattering the soft snow on either side in waves\r\nand spray, reminding one of the passage of some great ocean steamship\r\nthrough the billows. The snow had drifted in places till it was five or\r\nsix feet deep on the road, but this proved child’s play to the plough, and\r\nthe services of the navvies, who, seated on the coal, were swinging their\r\nlegs over the side of the tender, were not required. The greatest danger\r\non the line, now so amply protected by great snow sheds—literally wooden\r\ntunnels—and snow fences, arises from snow which has thawed, frozen, re‐\r\nthawed, and re‐frozen until it is literally packed ice. The wheels of a\r\nlocomotive, arrived at such a point, either revolve helplessly, without\r\nprogressing, or run clean off the metals.\r\n\r\nThe mention of the effect of ice on the rails recalls a story told by\r\nColonel Bulkley, when the latter was chief of the Russo‐American Telegraph\r\nExpedition. The colonel during the civil war in the States was at the head\r\nof a constructing party, who built temporary lines of telegraph to follow\r\nthe advancing northern army. The driver of a train which passed through\r\nthe district in which they were engaged had been ordered to stop nightly\r\nand pick the party up, but one night neglected to do so, and the weary\r\nconstructors had to tramp a dozen miles in the dark to the nearest\r\nvillage. The men naturally determined that this should not occur again,\r\nand so next morning armed themselves with several boxes of bar soap. What\r\nfor? To soap the rails! Colonel Bulkley tells gleefully how they rubbed it\r\non for about a quarter of a mile, how the train arrived at the place, and\r\nafter gliding on a certain distance, from the momentum it had acquired,\r\ncame nearly to a standstill, and how the men jumped on and told the joke\r\nto everybody. The engineer next day did not forget to remember them.\r\n\r\n“Some writers strongly advise the traveller to make a halt at Sherman\r\nstation,” says Mr. Rae. “The inducements held out to him are mountain\r\nscenery, invigorating air, fishing and hunting. A sojourn among the peaks\r\nof the Rocky Mountains has the attraction of novelty to recommend it. Life\r\nthere must be, in every sense of the word, a new sensation. But some\r\nsensations are undesirable, notwithstanding their undoubted freshness.\r\nThat splendid trout swarm in the streams near Sherman admits of no\r\ndispute. Yet the disciple of Isaak Walton should not be tempted to indulge\r\nrashly in his harmless and charming sport. It is delightful to hook large\r\nfish; but it is less agreeable to be pierced through by arrows. Now, the\r\nlatter contingency is among the probabilities which must be taken into\r\nconsideration. A few weeks prior to my journey, one of the conductors of\r\nthe train by which I travelled, learned, by practical experience, that\r\nfishing among the Rocky Mountains has palpable and painful drawbacks.\r\nHaving taken a few days’ holiday, he went forth, fishing‐rod in hand, to\r\namuse himself. While whipping the stream in the innocence of his heart, he\r\nwas startled to find himself made the target for arrows shot by wild\r\nIndians. He sought safety in flight, and recovered from his wounds, to the\r\nsurprise as much as to the gratification of his friends. His story did not\r\nrender me desirous of sharing his fate.”\r\n\r\nThe Great Plains, over which the “prairie schooners”(8) toil, and the\r\ntrains now fly, have a dreary interest of their own. In summer they are\r\nhot and dusty, and the contemplation of nearly unlimited sage‐brush, and\r\nthe occasional prairie dog or hen, is not enlivening; while the constant\r\nrecurrence of skeletons bleaching in the sun—skeletons of overworked\r\nmules, horses, and oxen, and sometimes of the human animal—is apt to make\r\none melancholy. But on a winter moonlight evening, when covered with snow,\r\nwhich has thawed in the day, and become _glacé_ at night, they resemble\r\none vast glittering lake, with the brush‐covered hillocks standing for\r\nislands. The buffaloes, once so common, are rarely or never seen near the\r\nrailway. In that more fertile portion of the plains nearer the Missouri,\r\nin Nebraska and adjoining states, it is also possible that the oft‐times\r\ngrand sight of the prairie on fire may be witnessed from the train. The\r\nwriter was, one evening in May, 1868, in company with others, in a Pullman\r\ncar, when huge massive clouds of smoke hanging over the horizon appeared\r\nin view. Soon it became evident, as the train approached the spot, that\r\nthe prairie was on fire for miles, although fortunately at some distance\r\nfrom the line. The flames rose fiercely to the peaceful, starlit sky; the\r\nhomesteads of settlers, trees, and hillocks stood out black against the\r\nline of destroying fire; while over all a canopy of smoke hung heavily,\r\naffording a scene not soon to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nWestward from the high point where Sherman stands, the railway line makes\r\na rapid descent to the Laramie Plains, the trains going down, not merely\r\nby their own weight, but with brakes tightly screwed down. At Dale Creek,\r\non this section of the line, a wonderful bridge is crossed. It is 650 feet\r\nlong, and in the centre of the deep ravine it bridges is 126 feet high. It\r\nis built entirely of wood, was erected in thirty days, and is a perfect\r\npuzzle of trestle‐work. “More than one passenger,” says Mr. Rae, “who\r\nwould rather lose a fine sight than risk a broken neck, breathes more\r\nfreely, and gives audible expression to his satisfaction, when once the\r\ncars have passed in safety over this remarkable wooden structure.” Now the\r\ntrain is again proceeding rapidly; in twenty miles, the descent of 1,000\r\nfeet is accomplished. Next, Laramie City is reached, round which is a good\r\ngrazing country. This is succeeded by the plains known as “The Great\r\nAmerican Desert,” another barren sage‐brush‐covered stretch of country.\r\nAnd yet—in addition to the fact that even sage‐brush is good for\r\nsomething, a decoction of it being recommended in cases of ague—the desert\r\nhas been proved to contain its treasures. At Carbon, and other stations on\r\nthe line, fine deposits of coal have been found, and are worked to\r\nadvantage. It was at first feared that all the coal for the railway would\r\nhave to be transported from far distant points.\r\n\r\nAmong the wonders of the plains are the huge rocks and bluffs known as the\r\n“Buttes,” which often rise from comparatively level ground, and in\r\ndetached spots. Seen in the gloaming, their often grotesque forms appear\r\nweird and unearthly, and the effect is increased by the fact that all\r\naround is silent and desolate, and their mocking echoes to the snorting\r\niron horse are the only sounds that are heard. Some of these rock‐masses\r\nare columnar, and others pyramidal, in form; some assume the shape of\r\nheads, human or otherwise. Now they rise in huge walls, with as wonderful\r\ncolouring as have the cliffs at Alum Bay in the Isle of Wight; they are\r\noften several hundred feet in height. One, particularly noted by the\r\nwriter, had almost the exact form of an enormous dog seated on its\r\nhaunches.\r\n\r\nAs the train approaches the confines of Mormondom some specially grand\r\nscenery is met and passed. The stern and rugged ravine known as Echo\r\nCañon(9) is shut in by abrupt and almost perpendicular sandstone and\r\nconglomerate cliffs, with many a crag standing sentinel‐like, and rising\r\nhigh towards heaven, over the impetuous, brawling Weber river. Close to\r\nthe Mormon town of Echo there is a cliff 1,000 feet high, which _overhangs\r\nits base_ fifty feet. There is also a rock known as “The Sphinx of the\r\nValley,” from a resemblance to the original. Weber Cañon succeeds the\r\nfirst‐named, and in this is to be noted a remarkable and nearly\r\nperpendicular cleft in the cliff—well known as “The Devil’s Slide.”\r\nFurther on, and the train arrives at “The Devil’s Gate,” where the stern\r\nrock‐walls narrow, and the dark hills approach each other closely. Here\r\nthe river becomes a boiling and furious rapid, white with foam, hurrying\r\nonward with terrible impetuosity, and rolling _tons_ of boulders before\r\nits resistless course. Some of the early railway bridges were quite washed\r\naway by it, and many difficulties were met in the construction of the\r\nline, heavy tunneling almost obviously having been necessary in some\r\nplaces. But all obstacles were successfully overcome. Emerging from the\r\ngloomy, rugged cañon, the more or less fertile and cultivated Weber valley\r\nis, by contrast, a perfect glimpse of Paradise.\r\n\r\nFew travellers, however much they may have to hurry, will pass through\r\nUtah without a flying visit to Salt Lake City, now a very different place\r\nfrom what it was when Captain Burton wrote his “City of the Saints.” The\r\nMormon capital is not on the main line of the Pacific Railway, but is\r\nconnected with it by a short branch of forty miles in length. Ogden is the\r\n“junction” for Salt Lake, and has a very tolerable station, with dining‐\r\nrooms, book‐stands, and other conveniences. The last time the writer\r\npassed through this part of Utah in winter, the (spirit) thermometer on\r\nthe platform at Ogden marked ‐16° Fahr., or 48° below the freezing‐point\r\nof water. On the first visit, the branch railway was barely commenced, and\r\nhe proceeded to the “city” in a “mud‐waggon,” a kind of packing‐case on\r\nwheels—for he can hardly say on springs—which was driven at a furious\r\nrate. How many miles he travelled perpendicularly—in jolts—he knows not,\r\nbut he was very tired on arrival at his destination. Yet the journey had\r\nmuch of interest in it. There was, for instance, almost all the way in\r\nsight, and sometimes within a few hundred yards, the Great Salt Lake—the\r\nDead Sea of America—whose waters are said to be one‐third salt. This is\r\nprobably an exaggeration, but its shores are white with a mineral\r\nefflorescence, and it took the Mormons years to irrigate much of the\r\nsurrounding land, and thus literally wash the salty deposits out of it.\r\nThe fresh water for the purpose had to be diverted and brought in hill‐\r\nside ditches, &c., in many cases from a considerable distance. The result\r\nhas repaid them, for the road from Ogden to Utah passes through several\r\nprosperous towns, and by scores of pleasant homesteads embowered in\r\ngardens and orchards of peach and apple trees, the marks of industrious\r\nfarm cultivation being everywhere apparent.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: CAMP DOUGLAS GARRISON, NEAR SALT LAKE CITY.]\r\n\r\nAt one period there was some opposition among the Mormons to the\r\nconstruction of the trans‐continental railway through their territory, as\r\nthey feared that influx of strangers which has actually come to pass. The\r\nlate Brigham Young, however, was either more enlightened, or saw that it\r\nwas no use fighting against the inevitable, and actually took contracts to\r\nassist in making the railroad, besides afterwards building the branch line\r\nto the city. It was cleverly said by the _New York Herald_ that “railway\r\ncommunications corrupt good Mormons,” to which President Young is stated\r\nto have replied that “he did not care anything for a religion which could\r\nnot stand a railroad.” And in fact, up to a comparatively recent date,\r\nseveral thousand fresh recruits, principally from Great Britain and the\r\nnorthern nations of Europe, have been conveyed over it annually.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place for any discussion of the Mormon mystery. It is easy\r\nto laugh at it, and say with Artemus Ward that, “While Brigham’s religion\r\nwas singular, his wives were plural.” The fact remains that, in hundreds\r\nof cases, Mormons had and have but one wife; although, theoretically, they\r\napprove of polygamy. The further point remains that no Mormon was allowed\r\nto have more than one helpmeet unless he could prove that his means were\r\namply sufficient for her support. Industry was the keystone of Brigham\r\nYoung’s teachings, however otherwise mixed with fanaticism and\r\nsuperstition, and the result has been that thousands of people, mostly\r\npoor, who settled in an unpromising‐looking country, have now homes and\r\nfarms of their own, and that by sheer hard work the desert has been made\r\nliterally “to blossom as the rose.”\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: A STREET IN SALT LAKE CITY.]\r\n\r\nSalt Lake City has been laid out with care, and the streets are wide and\r\nwell kept; while, excepting those of a small business centre, every house\r\nhas a very large garden attached. The days of the “avenging angels,” or\r\nDanites, is over, and every man’s life and property are nowadays safe\r\nthere, although at one time many suspected or obnoxious persons were, as\r\nour American cousins say, “found missing.” On one terrible occasion—the\r\nMountain Meadow massacre—a whole train of emigrants who, on their way to\r\nCalifornia, had encamped near the city, were murdered by Indians, whom,\r\nthere is no doubt, the Mormons had incited to the deed. A dignitary of the\r\nMormon Church, Bishop Lee, suffered the death‐penalty at the hands of the\r\nUnited States authorities for his share in the transaction. The emigrants,\r\nthen passing with their families by the hundred, had, there is no doubt,\r\nmuch aggravated the Mormons by jeering and mockery, and sometimes by\r\npurloining their cattle and goods. There has been for many years a\r\ngarrison of United States troops kept at Camp Douglas, a short distance\r\nfrom Salt Lake City, for the protection of Gentiles,(10) and the\r\nregulation of affairs generally.\r\n\r\nOne of the best features of this strange community is the marked absence\r\nof drunkenness and profligacy. Most Mormons are teetotallers, and drink\r\nlittle more than tea or coffee, or the crystal water which runs in deep\r\nbrooks through every street, and has its birth in the heights of the\r\nbeautiful snow‐clad Wahsatch Mountains, which are a great feature in the\r\nscenery of Salt Lake Valley. Salt Lake City has a remarkable building,\r\nknown by the faithful as “The Tabernacle,” and by the irreverent as the\r\n“Big Egg‐shell,” from the oval form of its roof. It holds 8,000 persons,\r\nor, under pressure, even more. It has an organ in point of size the second\r\nin America. The writer attended a service there, given in honour of some\r\nmissionary Mormons who were about to part for Europe. The Salt Lake\r\ntheatre is another feature of the place, and has a good company of Mormon\r\namateur actors and actresses. We once saw there some twenty‐five of\r\nBrigham Young’s family in the front rows of the pit. Formerly, it is said,\r\npayment at the doors was taken “in kind,” and a Mormon would deposit at\r\nthe box‐office a ham, a plump sucking‐pig—not alive—a bag of dried\r\npeaches, or a dozen mop‐handles, maybe, for his seats!\r\n\r\nTaking a last glimpse of the great Salt Lake, passing Corinne, where, when\r\nit was only six weeks old, a bank and a newspaper office, both in tents,\r\nhad been established, the train proceeds through a more or less barren\r\ndistrict on its way to Nevada, the Silver State, a country where, for the\r\nmost part, life is only endurable when one is making money rapidly. Those\r\nwho would see some of the silver mines with comparative ease “get off” the\r\ntrain at Reno, thence proceeding by branch rail to Virginia City and Gold\r\nHill, places where that form of mining life may be studied to perfection.\r\nSo great has been the yield of the Nevada and other silver mines of\r\nadjoining territories, that, as most of us know, the value of silver has\r\nactually depreciated. Some of the millionaires of San Francisco gained\r\ntheir wealth in Nevada.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the distances between leading places is so great that\r\nthe fares charged, albeit generally moderate, cannot suit slender purses,\r\nwhile empty pockets are nowhere. In consequence many attempt to smuggle\r\nthemselves through. The writer remembers, in about the part of the route\r\nunder notice, a “dead‐head” who had for several stations managed to elude\r\nthe notice of the guard, but who was at last detected, and put off at a\r\npoint a dozen or more miles from the nearest settlement. The “dead‐head,”\r\nlike the stowaway on board ship, of whom as many as fourteen have been\r\nconcealed on a single vessel, and not one of them discovered by the proper\r\nauthorities till far out at sea, is an unrecognised institution on the\r\nrailways of the United States. Perhaps because our ticket system is more\r\nrigidly enforced, few attempt to take a free passage on English railways,\r\nalthough it is stated that a sailor was found, some little time since,\r\nasleep _under_ a carriage, his arms and legs coiled round the brake‐rods,\r\nhaving succeeded in nearly making the trip from London to Liverpool\r\nundiscovered. But, then, sailors are hardened to jars and shocks and\r\nnoises, by being accustomed to the warring of the elements and so forth.\r\nThe reader may remember that when, some few years ago, a Great Western\r\ntrain intersected and completely cut in two another which crossed its\r\npath, a sailor was found asleep on the seat of a _half_ third‐class\r\ncarriage, and that he was quite angry when awoke and told of his narrow\r\nescape. All this bears a strong resemblance to digression, so let us\r\nreturn to our subject—“dead heads.” Examples of this tribe have boasted\r\nthat they have travelled all over the States for nothing. Good‐natured\r\nguards—always “conductors” in America—will often wink at his presence, but\r\nmore rigid officials have been known to stop the train outside a long\r\ntunnel, or on one side of a dangerous open trestle‐work bridge, and\r\nperemptorily tell the vagrant to “get!” He has often worked his way clear\r\nacross the American continent. Turned off one train, kicked off another,\r\nleft in the snow half‐way between far distant stations, charitably allowed\r\na short ride on an open freight car, walking where he may not ride,\r\nstealing where it is easier than begging, and _vice versâ_, he has at last\r\narrived in California, where, to do a glorious country and a generous\r\npeople justice, not even a tramp is allowed to starve. After all, does not\r\nthe vagabond deserve something for his enterprise? Perhaps in that land,\r\nnow far more of corn and hops and wine than of gold, he may, under more\r\nauspicious circumstances, become a better and more prosperous man.\r\n\r\nFew tourists or travellers of leisure will fail to pay a flying visit to\r\nthe grand and beautiful lakes and tarns lying among the eternal snows of\r\nthe Sierra Nevada mountains, which separate the Silver from the Golden\r\nState, and are crossed by the Pacific Railway at an elevation of 7,042\r\nfeet above the sea level. From the Summit and Truckee stations there are\r\nall necessary facilities for reaching Donner, Tahoe, and other lakes, and\r\nfor a stay among some of the grandest scenery in the world. The space\r\noccupied by this chapter would not describe in the barest details the\r\ngrand mountain peaks, in one case rising to an altitude of 14,500 feet;\r\nthe forests of magnificent trees; the quieter valleys “in verdure clad;”\r\nthe waterfalls and cataracts and torrents of this Alpine region, which is\r\nwithin half a day’s journey of San Francisco, and but three or four hours\r\nfrom districts which for eight months of the year have the temperature of\r\nSouthern Italy. Sufficiently good coaches convey you to leading points,\r\nwhere there are comfortable inns, or, in the summer months, travellers can\r\ndo a little tent‐life and open‐air camping with advantage, the climate\r\namong the mountains being pure, bracing, and yet warm. On the leading\r\nlakes there are boats to be had, and on one or two there are small\r\nsteamers plying regularly. Fishing and hunting can be indulged in to the\r\nheart’s content. The Sierra mountain trout is unsurpassed anywhere; while\r\nthe sportsman can bag anything from a Californian quail to a grizzly\r\nbear—the latter, more especially, _if he can_. At most of the ordinary\r\nplaces of resort he will get the morning papers of San Francisco the same\r\nday, while Truckee boasts of a journal of its own, published, be it\r\nobserved, 7,000 feet up the mountains!(11)\r\n\r\nOne of the writer’s recollections of the Sierra region is not so pleasant,\r\nbut then it was under its winter aspect. He had been warned on leaving San\r\nFrancisco that the railway might be “snowed up,” as it was in 1871‐2, when\r\nfor several weeks there was a blockade, and he was recommended to go to\r\nNew York _viâ_ Panama. That voyage he had once made, and, besides, had a\r\ndesire to see the continent in winter, when the journey from the Sierra\r\nNevada Mountains to New York is made through 3,000 miles of snow. So he\r\nstarted, and for twelve hours or so all went well; but at the very\r\n“summit” of the railway line, _i.e._, its highest point among the Sierra\r\nNevada, and near the station of the same name, the train came suddenly to\r\na standstill in the gloom of a long “snow‐shed” tunnel. Worse, as it\r\nseemed to some, the engine deserted it, and ran away, while the conductor\r\nwas also absent for a long time. The carriages were not too well lighted,\r\nalthough quite warm enough, thanks to the glowing stoves, while memories\r\nof former blockades and half‐starved passengers did not aid in reassuring\r\nthe frozen‐in travellers. Few slept that night, and, indeed, in one\r\ncarriage, where there were several squalling babies and scolding females,\r\nit would have been difficult. Some of the older travellers, who had\r\nsomething of Mark Tapleyism about them, did their best to cheer the rest,\r\nand passed their wicker‐covered demijohns—flasks are hardly enough for a\r\nseven days’ journey, which might be indefinitely extended—to those who had\r\nnot provided themselves; one individual did his best to relieve the\r\nmonotony with a song; but it fell rather flat, and melancholy reigned\r\nsupreme.(12) But not for long. About seven next morning there was a\r\ncommotion; a whistle in the distance; another nearer, which, hoarse as it\r\nwas, sounded like heavenly music; and in a few minutes the good locomotive\r\narrived, coupled with the train, and took it to the nearest station, where\r\nbreakfast was ready for all who would partake. And that breakfast! Trout,\r\nchicken, venison, hot bread, buckwheat cakes, and molasses, and all the\r\nusual, and some other of the unusual, adjuncts of a regular American meal.\r\nThe traveller must not expect all these luxuries at places nearer the\r\ncentre of the continent, where, in some cases, all that you will get are\r\nbeans and bacon, hot bread, tea or coffee, and perhaps stewed (dried)\r\napples or peaches. At such places the excuse is sufficient, for everything\r\nis brought from a considerable distance, while the stations themselves\r\nhave only been erected for the railway, and sometimes do not boast a\r\nsingle dwelling other than those immediately connected with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE PACIFIC RAILWAY: THE INTERIOR OF A SNOW‐SHED IN THE\r\n                             SIERRA NEVADA.]\r\n\r\nAnd so we descend, first to the foot‐hills, and then to the plains of\r\nsunny California. Evidences of mining, past and present, are to be often\r\nseen: flumes and ditches through which the water is rushing rapidly, old\r\nshafts, and works, and mills, and boarding‐houses. But the glory is\r\ndeparted, or rather changed for the more permanent vineyard and grain‐\r\nfield and orchard. Some of the finest wines and fruits are raised among\r\nthese said foot‐hills. And now we cross the American river, and are in\r\nSacramento, the legislative capital of the State, a city surrounded by\r\npleasant suburbs, handsome villas, and splendid mansions. Thence to San\r\nFrancisco there is the choice of a ride on the Sacramento River to the\r\nBay, or one of two railways—once so near the Bay City, few care to delay,\r\nand so press on. The railway bears you through a highly‐cultivated country\r\nto Oakland, the Brooklyn of San Francisco, and place of residence for many\r\nof its merchant princes. Here all the year round flowers are in full\r\nbloom. When leaving California in winter we noted roses, daisies,\r\nverbenas, pansies, violets, hollyhocks, calla lillies, and camellias, all\r\ngrowing in the open‐air. This is not particularly surprising, for in our\r\nown country, in Devonshire and Cornwall, particularly at Penzance, a\r\nmodified statement of the same nature might be made. At Oakland the\r\nrailway runs out on a wooden pier or bridge, one mile and a quarter long,\r\nto the bay.\r\n\r\nOf San Francisco and its glorious bay these pages have already furnished\r\nsome account. It is the grand depôt for all that concerns commerce and\r\ntravel between every part of America and much of Europe and the Pacific\r\ngenerally. The successful miner, trader, or farmer, from Nevada, Oregon,\r\nColorado, and all outlying territories, spends his money there; as the\r\nmetropolis of the coast‐trade of all kind _centres_ there. Hence its\r\nsuccess and cosmopolitan character.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the cosmopolitan characteristics of the Golden City, a\r\ntraveller (Mr. Carlisle), says that one of the good points, coming, as did\r\nhe, from the remoteness of Japan, is the proximity of the city to Europe\r\nas regards the receipt of news.\r\n\r\n“The city of San Francisco is eight hours behind London in the matter of\r\ntime, and one turns this to good advantage. When her corn‐merchants go\r\ndown to their offices in the morning they find on their desks a report of\r\nthe Liverpool market of that morning; each morning paper has two or three\r\ncolumns filled with telegrams of the preceding evening from all parts of\r\nEurope, and not unfrequently there appears among these telegrams a notice\r\nof the following kind:—‘The _Times_ of to‐day has an article in which it\r\nsays,’ &c., &c., giving the substance of that morning’s leader.” The\r\npresent writer can illustrate this point by an actual occurrence in his\r\nown experience. Every reader will remember the terrible explosion in the\r\nRegent’s Park, which did so much damage, and which happened about half‐\r\npast three in the morning. He was then occupying the post of “telegraphic\r\neditor,” &c., on the staff of the _Alta California_, the oldest journal\r\npublished on that coast. The news of the explosion reached him by telegram\r\nat 11.30 the _evening before_, that is, _apparently_, before it happened!\r\nThe _Alta_ therefore was able to give the sad intelligence to all its\r\nreaders—some few of them as early as four o’clock—the next morning, while\r\nthe London newspapers of the early editions could naturally have nothing\r\nabout it, as they were printed before its occurrence.\r\n\r\nMr. W. F. Rae, a writer before quoted in regard to the character which the\r\ncity unfortunately acquired in early days, says of it:—“From being a bye‐\r\nword for its lawlessness and licentiousness, the city of San Francisco has\r\nbecome in little more than ten years as moral as Philadelphia, and far\r\nmore orderly than New York.” The fact is that one must obtain a “permit”\r\nto carry a revolver at all, and that permission cannot properly be\r\nobtained by anyone of dissipated or dangerous character. A heavy fine is\r\ninflicted on any one wearing a pistol without having secured the necessary\r\nauthority. The same writer says:—“That the Golden State is of\r\nextraordinary richness is well known to every traveller. To some, as to\r\nme, it may have been a matter of rejoicing to discover that California is\r\nalso a land teeming with unexpected natural beauties and rare natural\r\ndelights.” He quotes approvingly Lieutenant‐Governor Holden’s speech at a\r\nfestive meeting held in Sacramento, California, on the completion of the\r\nPacific Railway. “Why, sir,” said the Lieutenant‐Governor, a gentleman who\r\nhad himself done much towards the successful consummation of that grand\r\nenterprise, “we have the bravest men, the handsomest women, and the\r\nfattest babies of any place under the canopy of heaven!” Baron Hübner, in\r\nhis published work,(13) says of the climate, “It is a perpetual spring;”\r\nand then, alluding to the decreased yield of gold, remarks truly, “Its\r\nreal riches lie in the fertility of the soil.” And once more, Margharita\r\nWeppner, the German lady‐traveller before mentioned, says, speaking of a\r\nfruit‐show she visited:—“What I saw there could only be found in\r\nCalifornia, for I have never seen anything to equal it, even in the\r\ntropics.” She adds, enthusiastically:—“This beautiful city of the golden\r\nland I prefer to any other in America. My preference is due to the\r\nagreeable kind of life which its people lead, and to the extraordinary\r\nsalubrity of the climate.” The present writer has preferred to collate\r\nfrom these independent sources rather than from his own long experience;\r\nbut he can testify to the truth of every one of the above statements. One\r\nof the grandest features in San Francisco’s present and assured future\r\nsuccess is the fact that the steamship companies of the whole Pacific make\r\nit their leading port.\r\n\r\nFrom San Francisco the traveller bent on seeing the world can proceed to\r\nNew Zealand and Australia, calling at Honolulu in the Hawaïan Islands, and\r\nFiji, on the way; _or_ he can make his way to China, calling at Japan, in\r\nsteamships having perhaps the most roomy accommodation in the world; _or_\r\nhe can reach Panama and South American ports, calling at Mexican ports _en\r\nroute_, by steamships which pass over the most pacific part of the Pacific\r\nOcean; _or_, again, he can make delightful trips northwards to Californian\r\nand Oregonian and British Columbian ports; _or_, once again, southwards to\r\nports of Southern California. These lines are running constantly, and the\r\nabove list is far from complete. Whither away?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n           THE PACIFIC FERRY—SAN FRANCISCO TO JAPAN AND CHINA.\r\n\r\n\r\n           The American Steamships—A Celestial Company—Leading\r\n    Cargoes—Corpses and Coffins—Monotony of the Voyage—Emotions Caused\r\n      by the Sea—Amusements on Board “Chalked”—Cricket at Sea—Balls\r\n       Overboard—A Six Days’ Walking Match—Theatricals—Waxworks—The\r\n               Officers on Board—Engineer’s Life—The Chief\r\n         Waiter—“Inspection”—Meeting the _America_—Excitement—Her\r\n           Subsequent Fate—A Cyclone—At Yokohama—Fairy Land—The\r\n            Bazaars—Japanese Houses—A Dinner _Menu_—Music and\r\n     Dancing—Hongkong, the Gibraltar of China—Charming Victoria—Busy\r\n                       Shanghai—English Enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\nA very ordinary trip now‐a‐days for those rounding the world is that from\r\nSan Francisco to China, calling at Japan on the way. The steamships of the\r\nPacific Mail Company are those principally employed, and a voyage on such\r\na vessel as the _China_, which is one of the crack vessels of the service,\r\nis one almost invariably of pleasure. The _China_ is a steamship of over\r\n4,000 tons, and cost 800,000 dollars, or, roughly, £160,000 sterling. She\r\nwill often carry 2,000 tons of tea on a return voyage, to say nothing of\r\nperhaps from five to fifteen hundred Chinamen. A traveller(14) already\r\nreferred to states, that with only 580 on board half a ton of rice had to\r\nbe served out daily, with a modicum of meat and vegetables. One of the\r\nleading cargoes on the outward trip from San Francisco is corpses and\r\ncoffins, few Chinamen being ever buried out of their native land. In the\r\nsplendid and roomy saloons of these steamers there are always Chinese\r\nwaiters, who are said to be most obliging, and noiseless in their motions.\r\nNegro waiters are civil and assiduous enough in their attendance, but are\r\nalways fussy; in this respect “John” is a great improvement on “Sambo.”\r\n\r\n“An additional proof,” said a leading journal “of the new vitality infused\r\ninto that long inert mass, the Chinese Empire, has just been supplied from\r\nSan Francisco,” and the writer goes on to describe a new development of\r\ntheir mercantile enterprise. It seems that there has been in existence for\r\nsome time past an association termed the Chinese Merchants’ Steamship\r\nCompany, the stockholders of which are wealthy native merchants and\r\nmandarins, who own many coasting steamers. The company is now about to\r\nstart a line from China to the Sandwich Islands and San Francisco, and it\r\nis not improbable that the Chinese emigrants may prefer these steamers to\r\nany other. The manager of this Celestial “P. and O.” is one Tong Ken Sing,\r\na shrewd native of Singapore; and, continues the writer, “under the\r\nenlightened control of this man of his epoch, who is equally at home with\r\ntails and taels, the company is sure to succeed.”\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the “Golden Gate,” the entrance to the Bay of San Francisco,\r\nand passing the rocky Farralones, islands whence a company brings a\r\nmillion of sea‐birds’ eggs to the city yearly, the voyager by this route\r\nwill not see land till Japan is reached. The steamships stop nowhere _en\r\nroute_. The passengers must depend on their own resources aboard for\r\namusement, and every passing sail becomes an object of greatest interest.\r\nYet still there is always the sea itself, in its varying aspects of placid\r\nor turbulent grandeur. “The appearance of the open sea,” says Frédol, “far\r\nfrom the shore—the boundless ocean—is to the man who loves to create a\r\nworld of his own, in which he can freely exercise his thoughts, filled\r\nwith sublime ideas of the Infinite. His searching eye rests upon the far‐\r\ndistant horizon; he sees there the ocean and the heavens meeting in a\r\nvapoury outline, where the stars ascend and descend, appear and disappear\r\nin their turn. Presently this everlasting change in nature awakens in him\r\na vague feeling of that sadness ‘which,’ says Humboldt, ‘lies at the root\r\nof all our heartfelt joys.’” When the Breton fisherman or mariner puts to\r\nsea, his touching prayer is, “_Keep me, my God! my boat is so small, and\r\nThy ocean so wide!_” “We find in the sea,” says Lacepède, “unity and\r\ndiversity, which constitute its beauty; grandeur and simplicity, which\r\ngive it sublimity; puissance and immensity, which command our wonder.”\r\nThat immense expanse of water is no mere liquid desert; it teems with\r\nlife, however little that life may be visible. The inhabitants of the\r\nwater through which the good ship ploughs her way are as numerous as those\r\nof the solid earth; although, unless the great sea‐serpent makes its\r\nfitful appearance, the experience of a traveller over the Pacific by this\r\nroute will be repeated. Says he:—\r\n\r\n“Few signs of life are visible outside the vessel. Occasionally a whale is\r\nreported in sight, but for many days most of the passengers are inclined\r\nto think it is only something very ‘like one,’ till, as the days pass,\r\nevery person has caught a glimpse of a spout of water suddenly shooting up\r\nfrom the sea without any apparent reason, or of a black line cutting\r\nthrough the blue surface for a moment, and then disappearing to unknown\r\ndepths. Occasionally, too, one or more sea‐birds are seen following in the\r\nvessel’s wake, sweeping gracefully across and again across the white band\r\nof foam, and with difficulty keeping down their natural pace to that of\r\nthe steam‐driven monster. These birds are of two kinds only: the ‘Mother\r\nCarey’s Chicken,’ and another, called by the sailors the ‘Cape Hen’—a\r\nbrown bird, rather larger and longer in the wing than a sea‐gull. Both\r\nbirds are visible when we are in mid‐ocean, 1,000 miles at least from the\r\nnearest dry land.” The writer of these pages has seen whales, in the North\r\nPacific, keep up with the vessel on which he was a passenger for half an\r\nhour or more together. On one occasion a large whale was swimming abreast\r\nof the steamer so closely that rifle and pistol shots were fired at it,\r\nsome undoubtedly hitting their mark, yet the great mammal did not show the\r\nslightest symptoms of even temporary annoyance, and there is reason to\r\nbelieve was not much more hurt by the shots than would the targets at\r\nWimbledon be affected by a shower of peas.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a little diversity and profit are got out of passengers by\r\nthe sailors when they go for the first time on the fo’castle. The latter\r\ndraw on the deck a chalk line quickly round the former, and each visitor\r\nso “chalked,” as it is called, must pay a fine in the shape of a bottle of\r\nrum. This secures one, however, the freedom of the ship ever after.\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: A CRICKET‐MATCH ON BOARD SHIP.]\r\n\r\nOne of the deck games popular on long voyages is a form of quoits, played\r\nwith rings and chalked spaces, or, in some cases, on a spike driven into\r\nthe deck. A traveller(15) gives an amusing account of a cricket club\r\nformed on the vessel in which he was a passenger. Fancy playing cricket at\r\nsea! He says:—“The _Lord Warden_ cricket‐ground is on the main deck, and,\r\nowing to the somewhat limited space at the disposal of the ten members,\r\nsingle‐wicket matches are the invariable rule. The stumps, which are fixed\r\nin a frame so as to remain steady on the deck, are about two feet in\r\nheight, and of course bails are provided, but never used. Of bats the club\r\nboasts not a few, of varied construction. Of these the majority are\r\nfashioned out of a thick deal plank, and soon go to pieces; but one of\r\nelm, which was christened off Cape de Verde, survived many weeks of hard\r\nusage, and was more precious to the club than the most expensive of\r\nCobbett’s productions. It was fully intended by a member of the Marylebone\r\nClub to obtain for this tough little piece of elm a final resting‐place in\r\nthe Pavilion at Lord’s, but unfortunately the ‘leviathan hitter,’ in\r\nattempting a huge drive, let it slip out of his hands, and it is lost to\r\nus for ever.” The boatswain furnished spun‐yarn balls at sixpence each,\r\nbut these seldom had a long life, four or five being frequently hit\r\noverboard in the course of an afternoon’s play; nearly 300 were exhausted\r\non the voyage. “The wicket,” continues the narrator, “is pitched just in\r\nfront of the weather poop‐ladder, the bowling‐crease being thirteen yards\r\nfurther forward, by the side of the deck‐house. Behind the bowler stands\r\nan out‐field, while mid‐on or mid‐off, according to which tack the ship is\r\non, has his back to the midshipmen’s berth, and has also occasionally to\r\nclimb over the boom‐board above it, and search for a lost ball among a\r\nchaos of boats and spare spars.... Run‐getting on board ship is a matter\r\nof difficulty, the ball having the supremacy over the bat, which is\r\nexactly reversed on shore. A cricketer who thinks but little of the side‐\r\nhill at Lord’s would find himself thoroughly non‐plussed by the incline of\r\na ship’s deck in a stiff breeze. A good eye and hard straight driving\r\neffected much, but a steady defence and the scientific ‘placing’ of the\r\nball under the winch often succeeded equally well, especially on a wet\r\nwicket. The highest score of the season was eighteen, which included two\r\nhits on to the forecastle, feats of very rare occurrence.” The games were\r\nhighly popular, and were watched by appreciative assemblages of the\r\npassengers. On the same vessel a glee club was organised, and an evening\r\nin Christmas week was devoted to theatricals, by the “Shooting Stars of\r\nthe Southern Seas.” Dancing is common enough on board, and, of course, is\r\noften pursued under difficulties; a sudden lurch of the ship may throw a\r\nnumber of couples off their feet or tumble them in a chaotic heap.\r\n\r\nAnother traveller(16) gives us some amusing notes on the private\r\ntheatricals performed on board the famous old steamship _Great Britain_.\r\nHe was stage manager, and says:—“I had a great deal to do, as I was\r\nresponsible for dresses, and had to see that everybody was ready. I had\r\namong other things to procure a chignon. I was in a dilemma, as I did not\r\nlike to ask a lady for the loan of one, even where no doubt existed as to\r\nher wearing false hair; so at last I procured some oakum from the\r\ncarpenter, and made three large sausages, and it was pronounced a success.\r\nThe stage is erected in the saloon, and we had footlights, with a gorgeous\r\nscreen of flags, &c.” Special prologues were written for these\r\nentertainments, one of which, on the occasion of performing the “Taming of\r\na Tiger” and the “Area Belle,” ran as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “Far from Australia or from British home,\r\n  Across wide ocean’s trackless breast we roam;\r\n  And though our ship both swift and steady speeds,\r\n  Yet dreary week to dreary week succeeds.\r\n  Our joys restricted, and our pleasures few,\r\n  We all must own the prospect’s rather blue.\r\n  At such a time to fill the vacant place,\r\n  A chosen few have taken heart of grace,\r\n  And tho’ unused the actor’s part to fill,\r\n  Will show, if not the deed, at least the will.”\r\n\r\nThen came mention of some of the amateurs who had already played before\r\nthe passengers:—\r\n\r\n  “Yet not all novices—the veteran Flood\r\n  You’ve seen before, and you’ve pronounced him good;\r\n  The modest Griffiths, and the blushing Lance,\r\n  Joy of the fair and hero of the dance;”\r\n\r\nand so forth. The performance took place while the vessel was constantly\r\nrolling. Mr. Laird says that he had to think almost as much of his\r\nequilibrium as of anything else; but as he had always to appear trembling\r\nbefore the presence of his master in the piece, it did pretty well, except\r\nin one lurch, when he went flying in an undignified manner across the\r\nstage into the arms of the prompter.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion an entertainment, entitled “Mrs. Jarley’s Waxworks,”\r\nwas presented. Five children were dressed up to represent different\r\ncharacters, and pretence was made of winding them up to make them go. The\r\nbest was a cannibal, converted to be a missionary; another personated Fair\r\nRosamond; and a third the Marquis of Lorne. The missionary handed tracts\r\nabout, and Queen Eleanor alternately presented a dagger and a cup of cold\r\npoison to Fair Rosamond. A regularly‐organised concert followed, while a\r\nfarce and spoken epilogue concluded this, the last performance on board\r\nthe _Great Britain_. After speaking of the voyage and the fun on board, it\r\ncontinued:—\r\n\r\n  “And now our sweet communion must shortly see its close,\r\n  And never more, till next time, shall we share in joys like those;\r\n  No more the fragrant sea‐pie or delectable burgoo,\r\n  No more on the same plate be seen fish, cheese, and Irish stew.\r\n       *     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n  No longer Mrs. Jarley’s works our mimic stage shall grace,\r\n  Or the little missionary‐eater show his little face.\r\n  Of Mrs. J. I would not say one harsh word if I could;\r\n  No use to tread upon her toes, because they’re only wood.\r\n  No more the sailor’s plaintive song with tears our eyes shall dim,\r\n  No more on Sunday morning shall we sing the Evening Hymn;”\r\n\r\nthe fact being that a clergyman on board had once inadvertently chosen the\r\nlatter for morning service! The epilogue concluded by wishing good luck to\r\nall the officers and men and to the good old ship.\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: LEAVING THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA.]\r\n\r\nBaron Hübner has given us, in his published work before quoted, some\r\ninteresting reminiscences of, and graphic notes on, his voyage to Japan\r\nfrom San Francisco. A few extracts may be permitted.\r\n\r\n“_July 4._—The sky is pearly grey. The vessel is all painted white: masts,\r\ndeck‐cabins, deck, tarpaulins, benches—all are white. This deck, from poop\r\nto prow, is all in one piece, and makes a famous walk. Almost all the\r\nmorning I am alone there. The first‐class passengers get up very late; the\r\nsecond‐class—that is, the Chinese—not at all. They go to bed at San\r\nFrancisco, and never leave their berths till they reach their destination.\r\nYou never see one of them on deck. The sailors, having done their duty,\r\ndisappear likewise. And how easy that duty is in such weather! On leaving\r\nthe Golden Gate the sails were hoisted, and have remained untouched ever\r\nsince. The breeze is just strong enough to fill them and keep us steady.\r\nThe result is a complete calm. The smoke ascends up to heaven in a\r\nstraight line. So the sailors have a fine time of it. They sleep, smoke,\r\nor play down‐stairs with their companions. The two men at the helm—these\r\ntwo are Americans—are equally invisible, for a watch‐tower hides them from\r\nsight, as well as the rudder and the officer of the watch. I have thus got\r\nthe deck of this immense ship entirely to myself. I pace it from one end\r\nto the other, four hundred feet backwards and forwards. The only\r\nimpediment is a transverse bar of iron, as high as one’s head, which binds\r\nin the middle the two sides of the ship. It is painted white, like all the\r\nrest, and is difficult to see. In every position in life there is always\r\nthe worm in the bud or thorn in the flesh—or, at any rate, some dark spot.\r\nOn board the _China_ the dark spot for me is that detestable white bar.\r\nNot only am I perpetually knocking my head against it, but it reminds me\r\nunpleasantly of the frailty of human things. It is very thin, and yet, if\r\nI am to believe the engineer, it is this bar alone which, in very bad\r\nweather, prevents the enormous shell of the boat from breaking in half.\r\nThere are moments when one’s life hangs on a thread; here it hangs on an\r\niron bar. That is better, perhaps, but it is not enough.”\r\n\r\nThe fine vessels of the company then running were, although perhaps the\r\nmost commodious in the world, hardly the safest. The distance between San\r\nFrancisco and Japan is 5,000 miles, and, barring a few hundred miles on\r\nthe coasts of the latter, the ocean is almost one grand calm lake. But\r\ncyclones occur in the Japanese seas when the high‐built American boats are\r\nnot safe.\r\n\r\nBaron Hübner gives us some notes on the passengers on board, which\r\nincluded nine nationalities. Among them was a dignified and venerable\r\nParsee merchant, a merchant prince in his way, who had wished to study\r\nEuropean manners, and so had proceeded as far as San Francisco. What he\r\nsaw there impressed him so unfavourably, that he immediately took passage\r\nback again. What he observed, indeed, filled him with disgust. “The men,”\r\nsaid he, “what a lack of dignity! Never in the streets of our towns will\r\nyou be shocked by the sight of drunkards and bad women.”\r\n\r\nHübner gives also some sketches of the officers on board. The chief\r\nengineer is described as a thoughtful and meditative man—a Roman Catholic,\r\ndeeply imbued with the spirit of religious fervour, and spending his time\r\nin the alternate study of theology and practical mechanics. His cabin,\r\nopening on the one side to the deck and on the other to the machinery,\r\ncontained a well‐selected, though small, library of scientific and\r\nclassical books, and was adorned by pots of flowers, which he managed to\r\nkeep alive by constant care, in spite of the sea‐breezes, for they had\r\nbeen given to him by his young and beautiful wife, whose portrait hung\r\nupon the wall. For a couple of weeks only in each three months could he\r\nsee his better half.\r\n\r\n  “Sweetly blows the western wind\r\n    Softly o’er the rippling sea,\r\n  And thy sailor’s constant mind\r\n    Ever turns to thee.\r\n  Though the north wind may arise,\r\n    And the waves dash madly by,\r\n  Though the storm should rend the skies,\r\n    And vivid lightnings round me fly;\r\n  Then I love thee more and more,\r\n    Then art thou more dear to me,\r\n  And I sigh for that dear shore\r\n    Distant o’er the sea.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron describes the waiters on board as follows:—“The head waiter is a\r\nnative of Hamburg. He and his white comrade lead an easy life; they\r\nconfine their labours to overlooking the Chinese men, and pass the rest of\r\ntheir time in flirting with the ladies’‐maids. These are the only two\r\nidlers in the service. Thirty‐two Chinamen do the duties of waiters on the\r\npassengers and at table. Although short, they look well enough with their\r\nblack caps, their equally black pig‐tails, which go down to their heels,\r\ntheir dark‐blue tunics, their large white trousers, their gaiters or white\r\nstockings, and their black felt shoes with strong white soles. They form\r\nthemselves into symmetrical groups, and do everything with method. Fancy a\r\nhuge cabin, in which the small table of twenty‐two guests is lost, with\r\nall these little Chinamen fluttering round them and serving them in the\r\nmost respectful manner, without making any noise. The Hamburg chief, idly\r\nleaning against a console, with one hand in his trousers’ pocket, directs\r\nwith the forefinger of the other the evolutions of his docile squadron.”\r\nThe daily inspection, common on all well‐regulated passenger ships, is\r\nthus described:—\r\n\r\n“_July 6._—Every day, at eleven o’clock in the morning and at eight\r\no’clock in the evening, the captain, followed by the purser, makes the\r\nrounds of the ship. In that of the morning all the cabin‐doors are opened,\r\nonly excepting those of the ladies; but the moment these have gone out the\r\ncaptain visits them with equal care. If any matches are discovered they\r\nare pitilessly confiscated. This morning the captain invited me to\r\naccompany him, and I could convince myself with my own eyes of the perfect\r\norder and discipline which reign everywhere. Nothing was more tempting\r\nthan that department which one greatly avoids, the kitchens. The head cook\r\nand his assistants, all Germans, did the honours of their domain. Every\r\nman was at his post, and only anxious to show the visitors the most secret\r\ncorners of his department. It was like an examination of conscience\r\ncarefully made. The provision and store‐rooms were admirable. Everything\r\nwas of the first and best quality; everything was in abundance; everything\r\nwas classed and ticketed like the drugs in a chemist’s shop. The Chinese\r\nquarter is on the lower deck. We have about 800 on board. They are all in\r\ntheir berths, smoking and talking, and enjoying the rare pleasure in their\r\nlives of being able to spend five weeks in complete idleness. In spite of\r\nthe great number of men penned into so comparatively small a space, the\r\nventilation is so well managed that there is neither closeness nor bad\r\nsmells. The captain inspects every hole and corner, literally\r\neverything—and everywhere we found the same extraordinary cleanliness. One\r\nsmall space is reserved for the opium‐eaters or smokers; and we saw these\r\nvictims of a fatal habit, some eagerly inhaling the poison, others already\r\nfeeling its effects. Lying on their backs and fast asleep, their deadly‐\r\npale features gave them the look of corpses.”\r\n\r\nA common occurrence, but always of great interest to the passengers, is\r\nthus described:—\r\n\r\n“_July 7._—Contrary to our usual sleepy habits, we are all to‐day in a\r\nstate of excitement and agitation. The _China_ is to come to the point\r\nwhere it ought to meet the _America_, which was to leave Hong‐Kong five‐\r\nand‐twenty days ago. Our top‐sails are filled with little Chinamen, whose\r\neager eyes are fixed on the horizon. The captain and officers are standing\r\nclose to the bowsprit, their telescopes pointed in the same direction.\r\nEven my Spanish friend has left his engine, his flower‐pots, and his\r\nwife’s portrait, to gaze at the blue sea, slightly rippled, but, as usual,\r\nwithout a speck of a sail. No _America_! The captain’s heart is in his\r\nshoes. He consults his charts, his instruments, his officers, all in vain.\r\nThe day passes without the steamer being signalled. The dinner is silent\r\nand sad. Every one seems preoccupied, and the captain is evidently\r\nanxious. It seems that the directors of the company make a point of their\r\ntwo boats meeting. It is to them a proof that their captains have followed\r\na straight course, and that the San Francisco boat has crossed, without\r\nany accident, a third of the Pacific. The passengers gladly avail\r\nthemselves of this precious opportunity to write to their friends. For the\r\ncaptains themselves it is a question of honour. They like to show their\r\nskill in this way, and their cleverness in being able, despite the\r\nvariable and imperfectly‐understood currents of the Pacific, to make a\r\nstraight course across this enormous sheet of water.\r\n\r\n“_July 8._—At five o’clock in the morning the second officer rushed into\r\nmy cabin—‘The _America_(17) is in sight!’ I throw on my clothes and tumble\r\non deck. The morning is beautiful, and this colossal steamer, the largest\r\nafter the _Great Eastern_, draws near majestically. The usual salutes are\r\nexchanged, and the _America’s_ gig brings us an extract from their log,\r\nthe list of the passengers, the newspapers from Hong‐Kong, Shanghai, and\r\nYokohama, and, which is essential, takes charge of our letters for America\r\nand Europe. A few moments after she resumes her course. What a grand and\r\nimposing sight! At six o’clock she has already disappeared behind the\r\nhorizon. At the moment of meeting we had run exactly 1,500 miles—that is,\r\nhalf the distance between England and New York.”\r\n\r\nThe _China_ encountered a cyclone, or rather the outer edge of one, which\r\nis graphically described by Hübner. He says:—“At this moment the ocean was\r\nreally magnificent. In the boiling sea the foam was driven horizontally\r\ntowards the east. The water was positively inky, with here and there\r\nwhitish gleams of light. The sky was iron‐grey; to the west a curtain of\r\nthe same colour, but darker. The thermometer was still falling rapidly. In\r\nthe air above the waves I suddenly saw a cloud of white flakes; they were\r\nlittle bits of Joss paper which the Chinese were throwing into the sea to\r\nappease their gods. I passed before the open door of the engineer; he was\r\nwatering his plants. The passengers were all gathered together in the\r\nsaloon. Some of them were moved almost to tears. At twelve o’clock the sky\r\ncleared a little, and the faces brightened considerably. I have often\r\nremarked that people when in danger, whether real or imaginary, are like\r\nchildren; the slightest thing will make them laugh or cry. The Bombay\r\nmaster‐baker, the Chinese merchant, and the two Japanese, struck me by\r\ntheir imperturbability. The first whispered in my ear, ‘The company is\r\nvery unwise to have a Chinese crew; the Malays are much better. Chinese\r\nsailors are scared at the least danger, and would be the first to make off\r\nin the lifeboats.’ Fung‐Tang has an equally bad opinion of his fellow‐\r\ncountrymen. He says to me, ‘Chinese good men, very good; bad sailors, very\r\nbad!’ I reply, ‘If we go to the bottom, what will become of Fung‐Tang?’ He\r\nreplies, ‘If good, place above; if bad, _below stairs_, punished.’\r\n\r\n“_July 20._—In the middle of the night the ocean suddenly calmed. The\r\n_China_ has got out of the region of the cyclone. The weather is\r\ndelicious; the sea like glass. But at four o’clock in the afternoon we\r\nsuddenly find ourselves amidst colossal waves; and yet there is not a\r\nbreath of wind. They tell us that this was probably yesterday the centre\r\nof the typhoon. It has exhausted itself or gone elsewhere; but the sea\r\nwhich it lashed into fury is still agitated, like the pulse of a fever\r\npatient after the fit is over.”\r\n\r\nYokohama, whose very name signifies “across the sea and shore,” has been\r\nbefore briefly described in these pages. Travellers have given some\r\ninteresting accounts of it, and as in a tour round the world it would form\r\none of the leading stopping‐places, some further allusion to it may be\r\npermitted.\r\n\r\nBaron Hübner says in effect that at every step one takes there one asks if\r\nit be not all a dream, a fairy tale, a story of the thousand‐and‐one\r\nnights. Arriving there from San Francisco, the step from American to\r\nOriental civilisation is particularly noticed. The Baron refers\r\nparticularly to the courtesy and extreme cleanliness of the people. Even\r\nthe coolies, bearing great cases or baskets slung on bamboos resting on\r\ntheir athletic shoulders, stop to chatter and laugh so pleasantly that\r\nlabour seems to have lost half its curse. “Misery,” says he, “is unknown\r\namongst them; so also is luxury.” If the Japanese have arrived at this\r\nhappy mean it would be a great pity to disturb their peaceful condition by\r\nthe introduction of a so‐called civilisation, and its attendant expenses\r\nand new wants.\r\n\r\n“What adds to the charm of the scene,” says the same authority, “is the\r\nsmiling look of the country, and the intense beauty, at this season\r\n(summer), of the setting sun. The sky is positively crimson, with great\r\nclouds of Sèvres blue; the long promontory of Thanagawa is inundated with\r\nmother‐of‐pearl; and on the purpled violet sea the pale shadows of the\r\nships and junks stand out against the sky, the one rocked by the swell,\r\nthe others gliding across the water like phantoms.” The winter in Japan is\r\ncold enough, as Mrs. Brassey discovered;(18) for icicles were hanging from\r\nthe shrouds and riggings of the _Sunbeam_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Brassey gives some life‐like pictures from Yokohama.\r\n\r\n“Having landed,” says she, “we went with the Consul to the native town to\r\nsee the curio shops, which are a speciality of the place. The inhabitants\r\nare wonderfully clever at making all sorts of curiosities, and the\r\nmanufactories of so called ‘antique bronzes’ and ‘old china’ are two of\r\nthe most wonderful sights in Yokohama. The way in which they scrape,\r\ncrack, chip, mend, and colour the various articles, cover them with dust,\r\npartially clean them, and imitate the marks and signatures of celebrated\r\nmakers, is more creditable to their ingenuity than to their honesty.\r\nStill, there are a good many genuine old relics from the temples and from\r\nthe large houses of the reduced Daimios to be picked up, if you go the\r\nright way to work, though the supply is limited.\r\n\r\n“Dealers are plentiful, and travellers, especially from America, are\r\nincreasing in numbers. When we first made acquaintance with the shops we\r\nthought they seemed full of beautiful things, but even one day’s shopping,\r\nin the company of experienced people, has educated our taste and taught us\r\na great deal; though we have still much to learn. There are very\r\nrespectable‐looking lacquer cabinets, ranging in price from 5s. to £20.\r\nBut they are only made for the foreign market. No such things exist in a\r\nJapanese home.”\r\n\r\nA really fine piece of old lacquer is often worth a couple of hundred\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n“It is said that the modern Japanese have lost the art of lacquer‐making;\r\nand as an illustration I was told that many beautiful articles of lacquer,\r\nold and new, had been sent from this country to the Vienna Exhibition in\r\n1873, but the price put on them was so exorbitant that few were sold, and\r\nnearly all had to be sent back to Japan. Just as the ship with these\r\nthings on board reached the Gulf of Jeddo, she struck on a rock and sank\r\nin shallow water. A month or two ago a successful attempt was made to\r\nraise her and to recover the cargo, when it was found that the new lacquer\r\nhad been reduced to a state of pulp, while the old was not in the least\r\ndamaged. I tell you the tale as it was told to me.\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: A STREET IN JAPAN.]\r\n\r\n“After a long day’s shopping, we went to dine, in real Japanese fashion,\r\nat a Japanese tea‐house. The establishment was kept by a very pleasant\r\nwoman, who received us at the door, and who herself removed our\r\nexceedingly dirty boots before allowing us to step on to her clean mats.\r\nThis was all very well, as far as it went; but she might as well have\r\nsupplied us with some substitute for the objectionable articles, for it\r\nwas a bitterly cold night, and the highly‐polished wood passages and steep\r\nstaircase felt very cold to our shoeless feet. The apartment we were shown\r\ninto was so exact a type of a room in any Japanese house that I may as\r\nwell describe it once for all. The wood‐work of the roof and the framework\r\nof the screens were all made of a handsome dark polished wood, not unlike\r\nwalnut.\r\n\r\n“The exterior walls under the verandah, as well as partitions between the\r\nother rooms, were simply wooden lattice‐work screens covered with white\r\npaper, and sliding in grooves, so that you could walk in or out at any\r\npart of the wall you chose, and it was, in like manner, impossible to say\r\nwhence the next comer would make his appearance; doors and windows are by\r\nthis arrangement rendered unnecessary, and do not exist. You open a little\r\nbit of your wall if you want to look out, and a bigger bit if you want to\r\nstep out. The floor was covered with several thicknesses of very fine\r\nmats, each about six feet long by three broad, deliciously soft to walk\r\nupon. All mats in Japan are of the same size, and everything connected\r\nwith house‐building is measured by this standard. Once you have prepared\r\nyour foundations and wood‐work of the dimensions of so many mats, it is\r\nthe easiest thing in the world to go to a shop and buy a house ready‐made,\r\nwhich you can then set up and furnish in the scanty Japanese fashion in a\r\ncouple of days.\r\n\r\n“On one side of the room was a slightly raised daïs, about four inches\r\nfrom the floor. This was the seat of honour. On it had been placed a\r\nstool, a little bronze ornament, and a china vase, with a branch of\r\ncherry‐blossom and a few flag‐leaves gracefully arranged. On the wall\r\nbehind hung pictures, which are changed every month, according to the\r\nseason of the year. There was no other furniture of any sort in the room.\r\nFour nice‐looking Japanese girls brought us thick cotton quilts to sit\r\nupon, and braziers full of burning charcoal to warm ourselves by. In the\r\ncentre of the group another brazier was placed, protected by a square\r\nwooden grating, and over the whole they laid a large silk eider‐down\r\nquilt, to retain the heat: this is the way in which all the rooms, even\r\nbed‐rooms, are warmed in Japan, and the result is that fires are of very\r\nfrequent occurrence. The brazier is kicked over by some restless or\r\ncareless person, and in a moment the whole place is in a blaze.”\r\n\r\nThe following gives a description of a Japanese meal:—“Presently the\r\neider‐down and brazier were removed, and our dinner was brought in. A\r\nlittle lacquer table, about six inches high, on which were arrayed a pair\r\nof chop‐sticks, a basin of soup, a bowl for rice, a saki cup, and a basin\r\nof hot water, was placed before each person, whilst the four Japanese\r\nmaidens sat in our midst, with fires to keep the _saki_ hot and to light\r\nthe tiny pipes with which they were provided, and from which they wished\r\nus to take a whiff after each dish. Saki is a sort of spirit distilled\r\nfrom rice, always drunk hot out of small cups. In this state it is not\r\ndisagreeable, but we found it exceedingly nasty when cold.\r\n\r\n“Everything was well cooked and served, though the ingredients of some of\r\nthe dishes, as will be seen from the following bill of fare, were rather\r\nstrange to our ideas. Still, they were all eatable, and most of them\r\nreally palatable.\r\n\r\n                                  Soup.\r\n                          Shrimps and Seaweeds.\r\n               Prawns, Egg Omelette, and Preserved Grapes.\r\n          Fried Fish, Spinach, Young Rushes, and Young Ginger.\r\n           Raw Fish, Mustard and Cress, Horseradish, and Soy.\r\n     Thick Soup of Egg, Fish, Mushrooms, and Spinach; Grilled Fish.\r\n                    Fried Chicken and Bamboo Shoots.\r\n                     Turnip‐Tops and Root, Pickled.\r\n                   Rice _ad libitum_ in a large bowl.\r\n                        Hot Saki, Pipes, and Tea.\r\n\r\n“The meal concluded with an enormous lacquer box of rice, from which all\r\nour bowls were filled; the rice being thence conveyed to our mouths by\r\nmeans of chop‐sticks. We managed very well with these substitutes for\r\nspoons and forks, the knack of using which, to a certain extent, is soon\r\nacquired. The long intervals between the dishes were beguiled with songs,\r\nmusic, and dancing, performed by professional singing and dancing girls.\r\nThe music was somewhat harsh and monotonous, but the songs sounded\r\nharmonious, and the dancing was graceful, though it was rather posturing\r\nthan dancing, great use being made of the fan and the long trailing\r\nskirts. The girls, who were pretty, wore peculiar dresses to indicate\r\ntheir calling, and seemed of an entirely different stamp from the quiet,\r\nsimply‐dressed waitresses whom we found so attentive to our wants. Still,\r\nthey all looked cheery, light‐hearted, simple creatures, and appeared to\r\nenjoy immensely the little childish games they played amongst themselves\r\nbetween whiles.\r\n\r\n“After dinner we had some real Japanese tea, tasting exactly like a little\r\nhot water poured on very fragrant new‐mown hay. Then, after a brief visit\r\nto the kitchen, which, though small, was beautifully clean, we received\r\nour boots, and were bowed out by our pleasant hostess and her attentive\r\nhandmaidens.”\r\n\r\nRecommending the perusal of the interesting works last quoted, let us\r\nfinish our trip on paper at its natural termination, so far as the route\r\nfrom San Francisco is concerned, in China, to which country the American\r\nvessels take us in a week or so.\r\n\r\nHong Kong is a commercial port of the first order, but has not come up to\r\nthe expectations once made of it. It has not progressed in the same ratio\r\nas has Shanghai. Its situation is picturesque. “Fancy to yourself the rock\r\nof Gibraltar, on a large scale, looking to the north. There facing us is\r\n_terra firma_. Let us scramble up to the flag‐staff, proudly standing on\r\nthe highest peak of the mountain. The sun, which is already low, bathes\r\nsky, earth, and sea in crude, fantastic, exaggerated lights. Woe be to the\r\npainter who should dare reproduce such effects! Happy would he be if he\r\ncould succeed!\r\n\r\n“Towards the south, the sun and the fogs are fighting over the islands,\r\nwhich at this moment stand out in black groups on a liquid gold ground,\r\nframed in silver. Towards the north we look over the town, officially\r\ncalled Victoria, and vulgarly Hong Kong. It is stretched out at our feet,\r\nbut we only perceive the roofs, the courts, and the streets; further on\r\nthe roadstead is crowded with frigates, corvettes, gun‐boats, steamers\r\nbelonging to the great companies, and an infinity of smaller steam and\r\nsailing vessels of less tonnage. In front of us, at three or four miles\r\ndistance, is a high chain of rocks, bare and rugged, but coloured by the\r\nsetting sun with tints of rose colour and crimson, resembling a huge coral\r\nbracelet. That is the continent. Towards the west are the two passages\r\nwhich lead to Canton and Macao; to the north‐east is a third passage, by\r\nwhich we ourselves have come. The sea here is like a lake, bordered on one\r\nside by the rocks of _terra firma_, and on the other by the peaks and\r\nsummits of the Hong Kong cliffs. I have seen in many other lands softer\r\nand more harmonious effects of light, but I never saw any so strange.\r\n\r\n“Victoria is charming, sympathetic, and imposing: English and yet\r\ntropical—a mixture of cottages and palaces. Nowhere can be found a happier\r\ncombination between the poetry of nature and the prose of commercial life;\r\nbetween English comfort and the intoxicating exuberance of the south. The\r\nstreets, which are well macadamised, well kept, and beautifully clean, run\r\nin a serpentine fashion along the rock, sometimes between houses, of which\r\nthe rather pretentious façades are coquettishly veiled by the verandahs,\r\nsometimes between gardens, bamboo hedges, or stone balustrades. It is like\r\nVentnor or Shanklin seen through a magnifying‐glass and under a jet of\r\nelectric light. Everywhere there are fine trees—banians, bamboos, and\r\npines. One may go on foot from one end of Hong Kong to the other, and yet\r\nalways be in the shade. No one dreams of walking. Nothing is to be seen\r\nbut chairs or palanquins. The coolies, their heads sheltered by enormous\r\nstraw hats, carry you at a rattling pace. Nothing can be more delicious\r\nthan a night promenade in an open sedan‐chair. In the lower part of the\r\ntown the scene is most animated and busy; officers and soldiers in red\r\nuniforms and with swarthy complexions (Sepoys), Parsees, Hindoos, Chinese,\r\nMalays, European ladies in elegant toilets, and men and women with\r\nyellowish skins, dressed like Europeans (half‐caste Portuguese). The\r\nhigher you climb the quieter you find it. Insensibly the town turns into\r\ncountry. Scramble up still a little higher, and you are in the middle of\r\nrocks, bare of trees, but covered with odoriferous shrubs, and traversed\r\nby a fine macadamised road, with glimpses of views here and there of\r\nmarvellous beauty.”(19)\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: THE CUSTOM HOUSE, SHANGHAI.]\r\n\r\nShanghai, as another leading port, would naturally be visited by the\r\ntourist of leisure, and it affords a wonderful example of English\r\nenterprise. It is by nature the port of Suchow, ninety miles up the great\r\nYang‐tse‐Kiang river. Near the city its flat, green, cultivated banks\r\nrecall the Humber in Yorkshire. The port is crowded with foreign shipping:\r\ngreat American steamships, the boats of the English P. and O. Company,\r\nthose of the French “Messageries,” merchant steamers straight from London,\r\nLiverpool, and Glasgow, and sailing vessels in numbers. In a picturesque\r\npoint of view the place has little to recommend it, but commercially it is\r\na lively place, nine‐tenths of the capital employed being English, and the\r\nwhite population counting at least six Englishmen to all the rest of the\r\nforeigners put together. There are three “concessions,” _i.e._, tracts\r\nceded by the Chinese to the English, French, and Americans, for commercial\r\npurposes. Stone being scarce, these concessions are fringed by enormous\r\nwooden wharves, slips, and piers, outside the warehouses, depôts, and\r\nstores. There are streets of well‐filled shops, where everything is to be\r\nobtained that could be bought in the Strand or Oxford Street. In this\r\npoint of view, Hübner tells us, neither Yokohama nor any other European\r\ntown in Asia, saving Calcutta and Bombay, can bear a comparison with\r\nShanghai. The Chinese do not adopt numerals for their shops and\r\nwarehouses, but use mottoes and descriptive titles, and the great English\r\nhouses have adopted the custom of the country. Messrs. Dent & Co. have for\r\ntheir _nom de maison_, “Precious and Obliging,” while Messrs. Jardine &\r\nCo. are known, not as number 45, or what‐not, but as “Honest and\r\nHarmonious.”\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: VIEW OF HONOLULU, SANDWICH ISLANDS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE PACIFIC FERRY.—ANOTHER ROUTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n       The Hawaiian Islands—King and Parliament—Pleasant Honolulu—A\r\n     Government Hotel—Honeysuckle‐covered Theatre—Productions of the\r\n           Islands—Grand Volcanoes—Ravages of Lava Streams and\r\n     Earthquakes—Off to Fiji—A Rapidly Christianised People—A Native\r\n     Hut—Dinner—Kandavu—The Bush—Fruit‐laden Canoes—Strange Ideas of\r\n      Value—New Zealand—Its Features—Intense English Feeling—The New\r\n        Zealand Company and its Iniquities—The Maories—Trollope’s\r\n               Testimony—Facts about Cannibalism—A Chief on\r\n             Bagpipes—Australia—Beauty of Sydney Harbour—Its\r\n         Fortifications—Volunteers—Its War‐fleet of One—Handsome\r\n    Melbourne—Absence of Squalor—No Workhouses Required—The Benevolent\r\n        Asylums—Splendid Place for Working Men—Cheapness of Meat,\r\n      &c.—Wages in Town and Country—Life in the Bush—“Knocking Down\r\n                   One’s Cheque”—Gold, Coal, and Iron.\r\n\r\n\r\nA popular route now to New Zealand and Australia is that _viâ_ San\r\nFrancisco, Honolulu, and Fiji, the bulk of the voyage being usually over\r\nthe quieter parts of the Pacific; it takes the passenger, of course,\r\nthrough the tropics.\r\n\r\nHonolulu, the capital of the Hawaiian or Sandwich Islands, is now a\r\ncivilised and pleasant city, while the natural attractions of the islands\r\nthemselves are many and varied. One need not now fear the fate of poor\r\nCaptain Cook. Most of the natives, of whom there are 50,000, are clothed\r\nin semi‐European style: the men in coats and trousers of nankeen, and the\r\nwomen more picturesquely clad in long robes fastened round the neck, and\r\npretty often of pink or some other bright colour. There is a white\r\npopulation of some 10,000 souls scattered over the islands, a large\r\nproportion of whom are English and American. Honolulu is the Government\r\ncentre and residence of King Kalakau, who used to be called “Calico” in\r\nthe United States, and who, in fact, is a very slightly tinted, good‐\r\nlooking, and most intelligent gentleman. The Ex‐Queen Emma, who visited\r\nEngland some years ago, has a villa beautifully situated a few miles out\r\nof town. The king devotes his energies to bettering the condition of his\r\npeople, and some few years ago, when the money was voted to build a new\r\npalace, declined to accept it, at least for two years. The Hawaiian\r\nParliament consists of a House of seventeen nobles and twenty‐eight\r\ncommoners, who, strange to say, sit in the same hall, their votes being of\r\nequal weight. There are always several Europeans or Americans in this\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\nMr. Guillemard thus describes Honolulu(20):—“The town, which is built on\r\nthe low land bordering the shore—partly, indeed, on land reclaimed from\r\nthe sea, thanks to the industry of the architects of the coral reef—looks\r\nmean and insignificant from the harbour, but on going ashore to breakfast\r\nwe get glimpses of fine public buildings and numerous shops and stores, of\r\nneat houses nestling among bowers of shrubs and flowers, and evidences of\r\na busy trade and considerable population. The streets are narrow, and the\r\nhouses built of wood, without any attempt at decoration or even\r\nuniformity. In the by‐streets or lanes pretty verandah‐girt villas peep\r\nout from shrubberies of tropical foliage, honeysuckle, roses, lilies, and\r\na hundred flowers strange to English eyes. Tiny fountains are sending\r\nsparkling jets of water up in the hot, still air; and other music is not\r\nwanting, for here and there we hear the tinkle of a distant piano, telling\r\nus that early rising is the rule in Honolulu, and suggesting as a\r\nconsequence a _siesta_ at mid‐day.\r\n\r\n“But here we are at the grand Hawaiian Hotel, a fine verandahed building,\r\nstanding back from the road in a pretty garden, the green lawn, cool deep\r\nshade, and trickling fountain of which are doubly grateful after the glare\r\nof the scorching sunlight, scorching even though it is not yet seven a.m.\r\nThe theatre, half‐hidden by its wealth of honeysuckle and fan‐palm, is not\r\nfifty yards distant, but is quite thrown into insignificance by the hotel.\r\nThis was built by Government, at a cost of £25,000, and is admirably\r\nplanned and appointed.” Its large airy rooms and cool verandahs, shaded\r\nwith masses of passion flowers, its excellent food and iced American\r\ndrinks, all combine to make it a capital resting‐place.\r\n\r\nIn the streets Mr. Guillemard noted bevies of gaily‐attired girls on\r\nhorseback, their robes being gathered in at the waist with bright scarves,\r\nwhich fling their folds far over the horses’ tails. Their jaunty straw\r\nhats were wreathed with flowers, and now and then some dark‐eyed beauty\r\nwould be found wearing a necklace of blossoms. The girls rode astride up\r\nand down the main streets, making them ring again with their merry\r\nlaughter. Mosquitoes were abundant, and, as some compensation, so also\r\nwere delicious melons, guavas, mangoes, bananas, and commoner fruit.\r\n\r\nThe sugar‐cane was first grown on these islands in 1820; now over\r\n20,000,000 pounds of sugar are produced annually by the aid of Hawaiian\r\nand Chinese labour and steam‐mills. Not a quarter of the land suitable for\r\nthis purpose is yet under cultivation, though some of the plantations are\r\nof thousands of acres in extent. Hides and wool are staple exports.\r\n\r\nA few hours’ sail from Honolulu some of the largest and most wonderful\r\nvolcanoes in the world are to be found. Two of them, Mauna Loa and Mauna\r\nKea, are each over 13,000 feet in elevation. The eruptions from the great\r\ncrater of Kilauea, which is _ten miles_ in circumference, are something\r\nfearful. One explosion ejected streams of red mud three miles, killing\r\nthirty‐one people and 500 head of cattle. This was followed by several\r\nearthquakes, which destroyed a number of houses. These, again, were\r\nsucceeded by a great earthquake wave, during the continuance of which\r\nthree villages were swept away and seventy people killed. Next a new\r\ncrater formed upon Mauna Loa, from which rose four fountains of red‐hot\r\nlava to a height of 600 feet. A lava stream, eight to ten miles long, and\r\nhalf a mile wide in some places, carried all before it. In one place it\r\ntumbled, in a molten cataract of fiery liquid, over a precipice several\r\nhundred feet in height. The interior of Hawaii is a vast underground lake\r\nof fire, and were it not for the safety‐valves provided by Nature in the\r\nform of craters, it would be shaken to pieces by successive earthquakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VOLCANOES OF MAUNA LOA AND MAUNA KEA, SANDWICH ISLANDS\r\n                             (FROM THE SEA).]\r\n\r\nAnd now the passenger has before him a fortnight of the most tranquil part\r\nof the ocean called the Pacific. He must not be surprised if the heat\r\nrises to 90° or so in the saloon. The distance from San Francisco to\r\nSydney direct is 6,500 miles, and Fiji is naturally _en route_; the detour\r\nto New Zealand considerably increases the length of the voyage. It will be\r\nremembered that these islands were formally annexed to Britain in 1874,\r\nafter vain attempts at a mixed native and European government. The\r\npopulation was then 140,000; in a year or two afterwards 40,000 of the\r\npoor natives fell victims to the measles, another of the importations\r\napparently inseparable from civilisation. The Wesleyan missionaries, in\r\nparticular, have worked with so much zeal in these islands that more than\r\nhalf the people are Christians. There are 600 chapels in the 140 islands\r\ncomprising the Fiji group. Formerly the natives were the worst kind of\r\ncannibals. They not merely killed and ate the victims of their island\r\nwars, but no shipwrecked or helpless person was safe among them. Numbers\r\nwere slain at the caprice of the chiefs, especially at the building of a\r\nhouse or canoe, or at the reception of a native embassy. Widows were\r\nstrangled at the death of their husbands, and slaves killed on the decease\r\nof their masters. The introduction of Christianity and partial\r\ncivilisation has changed all that for the better; and the natives of to‐\r\nday are described as mild and gentle, and little given to quarrelling.\r\nAmong their customs is that of powdering the hair (always closely cropped)\r\nwith lime, which is often coloured. Their huts are of dried reeds, lashed\r\nto a strong framework of poles, and have lofty arched roofs, but are\r\nwithout windows or chimneys. Each has two low doors, through which one\r\nmust crawl. The best native huts have a partition between the dwelling and\r\nbed room, and all are carpeted with mats. The only furniture consists of\r\none article, a short piece of wood on two small legs, used for a pillow!\r\nClay pots are used for cooking their principal diet, yams and fish. Many\r\nof them nowadays have houses well furnished with mats, curtains, baskets,\r\njars, &c.\r\n\r\nMr. Guillemard describes a tropical dinner, served to himself and\r\ncompanions in one of these huts. A couple of banana‐leaves formed the\r\ndishes, on which boiled fish and half a dozen yams, or sweet potatoes,\r\nwere offered. A large block of rock‐salt was handed them to use _à\r\ndiscretion_. Then followed ripe cocoa‐nuts. Dried leaves of somewhat\r\ntasteless wild tobacco, rolled up rapidly and neatly, and tied round with\r\na fibre, formed the post‐prandial cigars, which were lighted by the women\r\nat the fire, and passed from their lips to the guests’.\r\n\r\nThe natural productions of this group are extensive, and comprise bread‐\r\nfruit, taro, cocoa‐nuts, yams, bananas, plantains, guavas, oranges and\r\nlemons, wild and cultivated tobacco, sugar, cotton, and coffee. The india‐\r\nrubber tree is cultivated, and among the leading exports are dried cocoa‐\r\nnut and pearl‐shell. As there are at the present time comparatively few\r\nwhite settlers—perhaps not over 2,500 in all the islands—there are\r\ninnumerable openings for settlement, and Fiji, with many other\r\nneighbouring islands, will doubtless soon afford fresh examples of British\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nThe point touched by the steamers is Kandavu, on one of the southernmost\r\nislands, where Mount Washington, a fine mountain, rears its head 3,000\r\nfeet into the clouds. A visitor says:—“From the eastern point of land run\r\nout miles of coral reef, on which the ocean rollers are breaking grandly,\r\nand outside this barrier we take our pilot on board. The entrance to\r\nKandavu harbour is narrow and intricate, and here the _Macgregor_, one of\r\nthe mail steamers, struck on a submerged reef, and remained for several\r\ndays hard and fast aground.” The passage has been properly buoyed and\r\nlighted, and the New Company have built offices and stores, and\r\nestablished a coaling station here.\r\n\r\n“The view of Port Ugaloa from the entrance is very beautiful. On our left\r\nthe coral reef encloses a still lagoon of the softest, lightest green;\r\nbefore us hills and mountains, covered from base to summit with the\r\nrichest vegetation, are tipped with fleecy cloud; and on our right,\r\ndividing the waters of the bay, is Ugaloa Island, its slopes feathery with\r\nthe foliage of the cocoa‐palm and banana, half hidden in which appear here\r\nand there the low brown huts of the natives.... The brothers L. accompany\r\nme ashore on Ugaloa, landing close to a small collection of huts scattered\r\nabout just above the coral‐strewn beach. It is Sunday afternoon, and a\r\nnative missionary is preaching to some fifty men, women, and children,\r\nsquatting on their hams on the mat‐covered floor of a neat, white‐washed\r\nmission house. Amongst the congregation is a tall native, with a thick\r\ncane, keeping silence by tapping the heads of the inattentive. The\r\npreacher is eloquent and energetic in gesture; but Fiji is hardly a pretty\r\nlanguage to listen to, being decidedly characterised by queer guttural\r\nsounds, and spoken very fast. The sermon over, a hymn is read out and sung\r\nto a rather monotonous dirge‐like chant, and the congregation disperse. We\r\nare at once surrounded by an olive‐skinned crowd; the ladies’ dresses are\r\nminutely examined, for a white lady has scarcely been seen in Kandavu\r\nbefore the present year. The gentlemen have to display their watches and\r\nchains, and by means of shouting and signs every one is soon carrying on a\r\nvigorous conversation. Why is it that one always elevates the voice when\r\ntrying to make one’s native tongue intelligible to a foreigner?\r\n\r\n“We wander away into the bush, and are soon lost in a wilderness of ferns,\r\ncreepers, bananas, cocoa‐palms, and chestnut‐trees. We meet with a young\r\nnative, and make signs to him that we are thirsty, and wish to refresh\r\nourselves with the juice of a green cocoa‐nut. Clutching the trunk with\r\nboth hands, he almost runs up a palm, and our wants are soon plentifully\r\nsupplied. He receives his _douceur_ with apparent nonchalance, and\r\nproceeds to tie it up in a corner of his sulu with a fibre of banana bark.\r\n\r\n“Monday morning breaks fine and clear, and our slumbers are early\r\ndisturbed by the chattering of a hundred natives, a whole squadron of\r\nwhose fruit‐laden canoes are alongside the steamer. Queer crank‐looking\r\ncraft are these, roughly dug out of the trunk of a tree, and kept steady\r\non the water by an outrigger consisting of a log half the length of the\r\ncanoe, attached to it amidships by a few light poles projecting some four\r\nor five feet from its side. They are usually propelled by means of a long\r\noar worked between the poles, after the fashion of sculling a boat from\r\nthe stern; but sometimes we see the ordinary short paddle being plied at\r\nbow and stern. Some of the larger craft hoist a large long sail, but they\r\ndo not seem very weatherly under canvas, which they use but little\r\ncompared with the Society Islanders.\r\n\r\n“The scene on deck is amusing enough. Forward, fifty natives, their olive\r\nskins blackened and begrimed with dust, are hard at work replenishing the\r\ncoal bunkers from the hold, and thoroughly earning their shilling a day;\r\non the poop as many more, laden with lemons, huge bunches of bananas,\r\ncocoa‐nuts, shells, coral, matting, tappa—a soft, white fabric, called by\r\nthe natives ‘marse’—and a few clubs and other weapons, are driving a brisk\r\ntrade with the passengers. Everything is to be had for a shilling.\r\n‘Shillin’ is the only English word that all the natives understand; in\r\nfact, this useful coin seems to be the ‘almighty dollar’ of Kandavu. You\r\ntake a lemon, and ask, ‘How much?’ ‘Shillin’ is the reply; but you can\r\nobtain the man’s whole stock of sixty, basket and all, for the same\r\nmoney!”\r\n\r\nOur next stopping place is one of particular interest to the British\r\ncolonist. New Zealand, albeit one of the youngest, is now among the most\r\npromising of England’s outposts. Auckland, in the North Island, is the\r\nport at which the steamers touch. The harbour is very fine, and residents\r\ncompare it to the Bay of Naples.\r\n\r\nEvery schoolboy knows that New Zealand includes two large and one small\r\nisland, respectively known as North, Middle, and Stewart’s Island. One\r\ngreat feature of the coast line consists of its indentations; the colony\r\nis rich in fine natural harbours and ports. The area of the islands is\r\nnearly as great as that of Britain and Ireland combined, and about half of\r\nthat area consists of excellent soil. The climate is that of England, with\r\na difference: there are many more fine days, while winter is not so cold\r\nby half. The islands are volcanic; on the North Island, Mount Ruapahu, a\r\nperpetually snow‐capped peak, rises to a height of 9,000 feet, while in\r\nthe same range, the Tongariro mountain, an active volcano, rises to a\r\nheight of 6,000 feet. The highest mountain range is on the Middle Island,\r\nwhere Mount Cook rises to a height of 14,000 feet. One can understand that\r\nin such a country there should be an abundance of evergreen forests of\r\nluxuriant growth. These are interspersed with charming fern‐clad slopes\r\nand treeless grassy plains. Water is everywhere found; but none of the\r\nrivers are navigable by large vessels for more than fifty miles or so. One\r\ngreat advantage found in the country is the absence of noxious reptiles or\r\ninsects: of the latter there is not one as offensive as an English wasp.\r\nThe pigs, introduced by Captain Cook, run wild over the island, and there\r\nis plenty of large and small game: the red and fallow deer, the pheasant,\r\npartridge, and quail. Everything that grows in England will thrive there,\r\nwhile the vine, maize, taro, and sweet potato grow in many districts. A\r\ntraveller(21) says of the (Thames) gold fields:—“Mines here, like\r\neverywhere else, are now dull. At one time there was a population of\r\n22,000, but now this is only 13,000. Everybody one sees seems to have lost\r\nin the gold‐diggings, and it is a mystery to me who is the lucky person\r\nthat wins—one never seems to meet him.” This somewhat random statement may\r\nbe taken _cum grano salis_, as the gold‐fields have yielded largely at\r\ntimes. Nevertheless, mining is always more or less a lottery.\r\n\r\nMr. Anthony Trollope testifies to the intense British feeling in New\r\nZealand, where he felt thoroughly at home. Australia he found tinged with\r\na form of boasting Yankeeism. “The New Zealander,” says he,(22) “among\r\nJohn Bulls is the most John Bullish. He admits the supremacy of England to\r\nevery place in the world, only he is more English than any Englishman at\r\nhome.”\r\n\r\nDiscovered by Tasman in 1642, England only commenced to take an interest\r\nin the islands more than a century and a quarter later, when Cook surveyed\r\nthe coasts. The missionaries came first, in 1814, and a British Resident\r\nwas appointed in 1833. All this time a desultory colonisation was going\r\non, and the natives were selling parcels of their best lands for a few\r\ncast‐iron hatchets or muskets, shoddy blankets, or rubbishy trinkets. In\r\n1840 a Lieutenant‐Governor was appointed from home, and his presence was\r\nindeed necessary. The previous year a corporation, calling itself the New\r\nZealand Company, had made pretended purchases of tracts of the best parts\r\nof the country, amounting to _one‐third_ of its whole area! The\r\nunscrupulous and defiant manner in which this company treated the natives\r\nand the Government brought about many complications, and led to very\r\nserious wars with natives not to be trifled with. The New Zealand Company\r\nwas “bought out” by the Government in 1852 for £268,000. During 1843‐7,\r\nand in 1861 and after, England had to fight the Maories—foes that she\r\nlearned to respect. At last, weary of war, all our troops were withdrawn,\r\nand the colonists, who of course knew the bush and bush life better than\r\nnine‐tenths of the soldiers, were left to defend their homes and property,\r\nand in the end to successfully finish the fight. The natives now are\r\ngenerally peaceful and subdued, while many are even turning their\r\nattention to agriculture and commerce. Nine years ago they numbered\r\n37,500, but are fast dying out.\r\n\r\nPhysically and intellectually, the Maories are the finest semi‐savage\r\nnatives on the face of the earth. Mr. Trollope is an author and traveller\r\nwhose words carry weight, and he has given us the following concise\r\nsummary of their qualities and character:—“They are,” says he, “an active\r\npeople, the men averaging 5 feet 6½ inches in height, and are almost equal\r\nin strength and weight to Englishmen. In their former condition they wore\r\nmatting; now they wear European clothes. Formerly they pulled out their\r\nbeards, and every New Zealander of mark was tattooed; now they wear\r\nbeards, and the young men are not tattooed. Their hair is black and\r\ncoarse, but not woolly like a negro’s, or black like a Hindoo’s. The nose\r\nis almost always broad and the mouth large. In other respects their\r\nfeatures are not unlike those of the European race. The men, to my eyes,\r\nwere better‐looking than the women, and the men who were tattooed better‐\r\nlooking than those who had dropped the custom. The women still retain the\r\nold custom of tattooing the upper lip. The Maories had a mythology of\r\ntheir own, and believed in a future existence; but they did not recognise\r\none supreme God. Virtue with them, as with other savages, consisted\r\nchiefly in courage and a command of temper. Their great passion was\r\nrevenge, which was carried on by one tribe against another to the extent\r\nsometimes of the annihilation of tribes. The decrease of their population\r\nsince the English first came among them has been owing as much to civil\r\nwar as to the injuries with which civilisation has afflicted them. They\r\nseem from early days to have acquired that habit of fighting behind\r\nstockades or in fortified pahs which we have found so fatal to ourselves\r\nin our wars with them. Their weapons, before they got guns from us, were\r\nnot very deadly. They were chiefly short javelins and stones, both flung\r\nfrom slings. But there was a horror in their warfare to the awfulness of\r\nwhich they themselves seem to have been keenly alive. When a prisoner was\r\ntaken in war he was cooked and eaten.\r\n\r\n“I do not think that human beings were slaughtered for food in New\r\nZealand, although there is no doubt that the banquet when prepared was\r\nenjoyed with a horrid relish.\r\n\r\n“I will quote a passage from Dr. Thompson’s work in reference to the\r\npractice of cannibalism, and will then have done with the subject.\r\n‘Whether or not cannibalism commenced immediately after the advent of the\r\nNew Zealanders from Hawaiki, it is nevertheless certain that one of\r\nTasman’s sailors was eaten in 1642; that Captain Cook had a boat’s crew\r\neaten in 1774; that Marion de Fresne and many other navigators met this\r\nhorrible end; and that the pioneers of civilisation and successive\r\nmissionaries have all borne testimony to the universal prevalence of\r\ncannibalism in New Zealand up to the year 1840. It is impossible to state\r\nhow many New Zealanders were annually devoured; that the number was not\r\nsmall may be inferred from two facts authenticated by European witnesses.\r\nIn 1822, Hougi’s army ate three hundred persons after the capture of\r\nTotara, on the River Thames, and in 1836, during the Rotura war, sixty\r\nbeings were cooked and eaten in two days.’ I will add from the same book a\r\ntranslation of a portion of a war‐song:—‘Oh, my little son, are you\r\ncrying? are you screaming for your food? Here it is for you, the flesh of\r\nHekemanu and Werata. Although I am surfeited with the soft brains of Putu\r\nRikiriki and Raukauri, yet such is my hatred that I will fill myself\r\nfuller with those of Pau, of Ngaraunga, of Pipi, and with my most dainty\r\nmorsel, the flesh of the hated Teao.’”\r\n\r\nMr. Laird testifies to their cleanliness, but states that they are, like\r\nmost savages, and for that matter, most white men, very improvident. If a\r\nbad potato or other crop occurred, they would eat it all at once, and half\r\nstarve afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe same author tells a good story of the nonchalance of a leading Maori\r\nchief who was invited to dinner at Government House during the visit of\r\nH.R.H. the Duke of Edinburgh. After dinner the Duke’s chief bagpiper came\r\nin and played. The chief was asked how he liked the music. He replied\r\nbriefly: “Too much noise for me; but suit white man well enough.”\r\n\r\nAnd now we are approaching that great continent which has had, has, and\r\nwill increasingly have, so much interest for the emigrant, who must be,\r\nmore or less, a voyager and man of the sea. Australia, a country nearly as\r\nlarge as the United States, must be for many a day to come a very Paradise\r\nfor the poor man.\r\n\r\nThe American steamers from San Francisco land one at Sydney, of which\r\ncharming place Mr. Trollope says:—“I despair of being able to convey to my\r\nreaders my own idea of the beauty of Sydney Harbour;” he considers that it\r\nexcels Dublin Bay, Spezzia, and New York. And the colonists, left to\r\nthemselves—for England maintains no troops there now—have fortified it\r\nstrongly. Mr. Trollope tells us of five separate armed fortresses, with\r\nArmstrong guns, rifled guns, guns of eighteen tons’ weight, with loopholed\r\nwalls and pits for riflemen, as though Sydney was to become another\r\nSebastopol. “It was shown,” says he, “how the whole harbour and city were\r\ncommanded by these guns. There were open batteries and casemated\r\nbatteries, shell‐rooms and gunpowder magazines, barracks rising here and\r\ntrenches dug there. There was a boom to be placed across the harbour, and\r\na whole world of torpedoes ready to be sunk beneath the water, all of\r\nwhich were prepared and ready for use in an hour or two. It was explained\r\nto me that ‘they’ could not possibly get across the trenches, or break the\r\nboom, or escape the torpedoes, or live for an hour beneath the blaze of\r\nthe guns. ‘They’ would not have a chance to get at Sydney. There was much\r\nmartial ardour, and a very general opinion that ‘they’ would have the\r\nworst of it.” New South Wales and Victoria have about 8,000 volunteers and\r\na training‐ship for sailor boys; while an enormous monitor, the\r\n_Cerberus_, presented by the mother country, forms its war‐fleet of one.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: VIEW IN COLLINS STREET, MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA.]\r\n\r\nOf Melbourne, Victoria, mention has already been made. There are many\r\ncities with larger populations, but few have ever attained so great a size\r\nwith such rapidity. Though it owes nothing to natural surroundings, “the\r\ninternal appearance of the city is,” Mr. Trollope assures us, “certainly\r\nmagnificent.” It is built on the Philadelphian rectangular plan; it is the\r\nwidth of the streets which give the city a fine appearance, together with\r\nthe devotion of large spaces within the limits for public gardens. “One\r\ncannot walk about Melbourne without being struck by all that has been done\r\nfor the welfare of the people generally. There is no squalor to be\r\nseen—though there are quarters of the town in which the people no doubt\r\nare squalid.... But he who would see such misery in Melbourne must search\r\nfor it specially.” There are no workhouses; their place is supplied in the\r\ncolony of Victoria generally by “Benevolent Asylums.” In Melbourne about\r\n12,000 poor are relieved yearly, some using the institution there as a\r\ntemporary, and others as a permanent place of refuge. These places are\r\nchiefly, but not entirely, supported by Government aid. “Could a pauper,”\r\nsays Trollope, “be suddenly removed out of an English union workhouse into\r\nthe Melbourne Benevolent Asylum, he might probably think that he had\r\nmigrated to Buckingham Palace,” so well are the inmates fed and cared for.\r\nThere are no workhouses proper in any part of Australia, and the charity\r\nbestowed on these asylums is not given painfully or sparingly.\r\n\r\nThe wideness of the streets, however, and grandeur of general dimensions,\r\nhave their drawbacks, among which the time consumed in reaching distant\r\nparts of the city counts first. Melbourne has a fine and entirely free\r\nPublic Library and a University, as, indeed, has Sydney. Melbourne is the\r\ncentre of a system of railways, and the well‐to‐do people all live out of\r\ntown; in the south and east of the city there are miles of villas and\r\nmansions.\r\n\r\nMr. Trollope says:—“There is perhaps no town in the world in which an\r\nordinary working man can do better for himself and for his family with his\r\nwork than he can at Melbourne.” The rates of wages for mechanics are\r\nslightly greater than at home, and all the necessaries of life are\r\ncheaper. With meat at 4d. per pound, butter from 6d. upwards, bread, tea,\r\nand coffee about the same prices or rather under, coals the same or a\r\ntrifle higher, potatoes, vegetables, and fruits generally considerably\r\ncheaper, all can live well and plentifully. Meat three times a day is\r\ncommon all over Australia, and in some parts the price is as low as 1½d.\r\nor 2d. per pound. Wages for good mechanics and artisans average about 10s.\r\na day; gardeners receive about 50s., and labourers about 30s. per week;\r\nmen‐servants, in the house, £40 to £50 per annum; cooks, £35 to £45 per\r\nyear; girls, as housemaids, &c., 8s. or 10s. per week. It is usual to hire\r\nthe last named by this short term. Some of these prices rule all over the\r\ncountry, but are liable to rule lower, rather than higher, outside of\r\nMelbourne.\r\n\r\nIn the country sheep‐shearers can earn 7s. to 14s. per day for about four\r\nmonths in the year; shepherds, £30 to £40 per year, with rations. The\r\ncommon labourer can count on 15s. to 20s. per week, with rations: these\r\nconsist generally of 14 lbs. meat (usually mutton), 8 lbs. flour, 2 lbs.\r\nsugar, and a quarter of a pound of tea. Of course, where fruit or\r\nvegetables are plentiful they would be added. The meat, bread, and tea\r\ndiet, however, is that characteristic of the whole country. In the great\r\nsheep runs and cattle ranges(23) it would be the shepherd’s diet\r\ninvariably.\r\n\r\nMr. Trollope advises the poor man to save for three or four years, and\r\nthen invest in land, which in some places is to be had at 3s. 9d. an acre,\r\npayable to the Government in five instalments of ninepence per acre. Of\r\ncourse, he would require money for the erection of a house, farm\r\nimplements, &c. The great trouble with most men working in the bush as\r\nshepherds or shearers, or at the mines, or elsewhere at distant points, is\r\nthat the enforced absence from civilisation and social life makes them\r\ninclined for reckless living when they have accumulated a sum of money.\r\nThe tavern‐keepers of the nearest town or station reap all the benefit,\r\nand there are numbers of men who, for ten or eleven months of the year\r\nperfectly steady and sober, periodically give themselves up to drink until\r\ntheir earnings are melted, it is called “knocking down” one’s cheque, and\r\nit is a common practice for them to hand such cheque to the publican, who\r\nlets them run on recklessly in drink and food until _he_ considers it\r\nexhausted. A good story is told by Mr. Trollope of a man who had been\r\naccustomed to do this at regular intervals, but who on one occasion,\r\nhaving some loose silver, “planted” his cheque in an old tree, and\r\nproceeded to the usual haunt, where he set to work deliberately to get\r\ndrunk. The publican showed evident doubt as to the propriety of supplying\r\nhim freely. Why had not the man brought his cheque as usual? The tavern‐\r\nkeeper at last put him to bed; but the man, though drugged and stupefied,\r\nhad his wits about him sufficiently to observe and remember that the host\r\nhad examined his clothes, his hat, and boots, for the lacking cheque. Next\r\nmorning he was ignominiously expelled from the house, but he didn’t mind:\r\nthe cheque was found by him safely in the tree by the roadside, and he\r\nsurprised his master by returning to the station a week or two before he\r\nwas expected richer than he had ever come home before. Let us hope he was\r\ncured of that form of folly for ever.\r\n\r\nThe gold yield of Australia for the twenty years between 1851 and 1871 was\r\n50,750,000 ozs. But gold‐fields die out sooner than most mines, and\r\nAustralia has a more permanent source of prosperity for the future in its\r\ncoal and iron‐fields, which are in close proximity to each other. The coal\r\nis already worked to great profit, and is one of the principal steamship\r\nfuels of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe steamship route homeward from Australia is that by the Indian Ocean\r\n(usually touching at Ceylon), then reaching the Mediterranean _viâ_ the\r\nRed Sea and Suez Canal. These points of interest have already been fully\r\ndescribed in early chapters of this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              WOMAN AT SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\n       Poets’ Opinions on Early Navigation—Who was the First Female\r\n      Navigator?—Noah’s Voyage—A Thrilling Tale—A Strained Vessel—A\r\n    Furious Gale—A Birth at Sea—The Ship Doomed—Ladies and Children in\r\n         an Open Boat—Drunken Sailors—Semi‐starvation, Cold, and\r\n       Wet—Exposed to the Tropical Sun—Death of a Poor Baby—Sharks\r\n      about—A Thievish Sailor—Proposed Cannibalism—A Sail!—The Ship\r\n             passes by—Despair—Saved at Last—Experiences of a\r\n    Yachtswoman—Nearly Swamped and Carried Away—An Abandoned Ship—The\r\n      _Sunbeam_ of Service—Ship on Fire!—Dangers of a Coal Cargo—The\r\n    Crew Taken off—Noble Lady Passengers—Two Modern Heroines and their\r\n    Deeds—The Story of Grace Darling—The Longstone Light and Wreck of\r\n         the _Forfarshire_—To the Rescue!—Death of Grace Darling.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Hearts sure of brass they had who tempted first\r\n  Rude seas that spare not what themselves have nursed.”\r\n\r\nSo sings Waller, and his words are only the repetition of a sentiment much\r\nmore grandly expressed by Horace, who wrote now near two thousand years\r\nago:—“Surely oak and threefold brass surrounded his heart who first\r\ntrusted a frail vessel to the merciless ocean.” And once more, just to\r\nshow the unanimity of the poets on this point, Dr. Watts has said:—\r\n\r\n  “It was a brave attempt! advent’rous he\r\n  Who in the first ship broke the unknown sea.”\r\n\r\nNow, if all this is said of man, what shall be said of the woman who first\r\ntrusted herself on the great deep? Who was she? It would be most difficult\r\nto satisfactorily answer this question, but there can be no doubt that\r\n“Noah’s wife, and the three wives of his sons,” whose voyage and enforced\r\nresidence in the ark lasted no less than twelve months and three days(24)\r\nare the earliest females on record who embarked in a great vessel on a\r\nboundless expanse of waters.\r\n\r\nThese pages have already presented episodes in the lives of many seafaring\r\nladies, but till now no chapter has been specially devoted to the subject.\r\nIn these days of general travel ladies make, as we have often seen, long\r\nvoyages to and from far distant parts. One of them, some nineteen years\r\nago, underwent the horrors of shipwreck, and her subsequent sufferings\r\nwere admirably told by her under the title of “Ten Terrible Days.” The\r\naccount, which should be read in its entirety, is here, for obvious\r\nreasons, considerably condensed.\r\n\r\nOne day late in the year 1861 a grain‐laden vessel, a fine clipper, might\r\nhave been seen slowly and gracefully sailing out of the noble bay of San\r\nFrancisco. On her as passengers were two or three ladies with children,\r\namong them Mrs. William Murray, the authoress, who had been recommended to\r\ntake the long voyage home in a roving clipper, in preference to taking a\r\npassage in the over‐crowded steamers running to Panama and New York. Let\r\nher open the story. “The sun,” says she, “was shining as it always does in\r\nCalifornia, until the sea and the rocks and the vast city seemed literally\r\nglittering with sunlight. One long look back to the happy home of the last\r\nsix years, to the home still of the husband and brothers obliged to remain\r\nbehind, and at last I had only the sea that parted us to look at through\r\nmy tears. Our friends had seen us set sail in what seemed a gallant ship.\r\nIt had been chosen from all others as the one to send us home in for its\r\nshow of perfectness. There were men in San Francisco who knew that the\r\nship was unseaworthy (having been frightfully strained in her last voyage\r\nto China), and that she was in no fit condition to be trusted with the\r\nlives of helpless women and children, yet they let us sail without a word\r\nof warning.”\r\n\r\nThe dreaded Horn had been easily rounded in good weather, and on the\r\nevening of January 4th, 1862, they had been eighty‐six days out; in ten\r\nmore they expected to be in England. The sailors had predicted a stormy\r\nnight, and a terrific gale followed closely on that prophecy. The wind\r\nincreased in fury, and the ship rolled till those on board were often\r\nthrown from their feet. That night a child was born on board, and the\r\nkindly lady passengers did all in their power for the poor mother.\r\n\r\n“At dawn,” says Mrs. Murray, “taking my little girl by the hand, I went on\r\ndeck. The storm had in some measure abated, but the sea looked black and\r\nsullen, and the swell of the vast heavy waves seemed to mock our frailty.\r\nThe sailors had been up all night, and were as men playing at some\r\nferocious game: some working in desperation at the pumps, and singing at\r\nthe pitch of their voices wild sea‐songs to time their common efforts;\r\nothers employed in throwing hundreds of bags of grain into the sea, that\r\nthey might thus lighten the ship. This, I think, more than all, showed me\r\nour peril. I wandered about, too miserable to remain in any one spot, till\r\nthe captain assembled us all once more in the cabin to get some food,\r\nsaying that it was impossible to save the ship, and that we should have\r\nneed of all our fortitude. I remembered my own vain attempt to eat some\r\nbread, but the poor little children took their breakfast and enjoyed it.\r\n\r\n“We were then each provided with a large bag made of sailcloth, and were\r\nadvised by the captain to fill it with the warmest articles of clothing we\r\npossessed.\r\n\r\n“All my worldly possessions were on board, comprising many memorials of\r\ndear friends, portraits of loved ones I shall never see again, and my\r\nmoney loss I knew would be no trifle. In perfect bewilderment I looked\r\nround, and filled my bag with stockings and a couple of warm shawls. On\r\nthe top of a box I saw a little parcel that had been entrusted to me by a\r\nlady in California to deliver to her mother in Liverpool. I put that in my\r\nbag, and she got it.... There had been no thought of removing the\r\nbreakfast, and with the rolling of the ship, which was every moment\r\nbecoming worse, everything had fallen on the floor, and was dashing about\r\nin all directions. Boxes, water‐jugs, plates, dishes, chairs, glasses,\r\nwere pitching from one end of the saloon to the other. Children screaming,\r\nsailors shouting and cursing, and loud above all there was the creaking of\r\ntimbers, and the sullen sound of water fast gaining upon us in the hold of\r\nthe ship, which groaned and laboured like a living thing in agony.”\r\n\r\nHow the ridiculous will intrude even at such times is shown in the\r\nfollowing. A little boy was discovered helping himself out of the\r\nmedicine‐chest, particularly busy with the contents of a broken calomel\r\nbottle! Lamp‐oil served as an emetic in this emergency, and the\r\nyoungster’s life was saved. And now the first mate, upon whose decision\r\nand firmness much depended, having lost his presence of mind, had drunk\r\ndeeply of whisky. He was intoxicated, and so, too, were many of the\r\nsailors, who had followed his example. The captain, meantime, had been\r\nbusily employed in ordering out food and water to supply the boats,\r\ncollecting the ship’s papers, &c. The lowering of the boats he had\r\nentrusted to his officers. On hearing of the drunkenness on deck, his\r\nfirst thought was to get the women and children off at once, for should\r\nthe sailors seize the boats, what would become of them? Two boats had\r\nalready been smashed whilst lowering them into the sea, and there were\r\nonly two remaining. Forty‐seven people to cram into two frail boats,\r\nfifteen hundred miles from land: delicately‐nurtured women, helpless\r\nchildren, drunken and desperate men.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: “THE PASSENGERS WERE LET DOWN BY ROPES” (_p. 58_).]\r\n\r\nBy the help of the most sober of the sailors, the captain’s own boat was\r\nlowered; some small mattresses, pillows, blankets, a cask of water, sacks\r\nof biscuit, and nautical instruments, were first put in; then the\r\npassengers were let down by ropes. “It seems marvellous,” says Mrs.\r\nMurray, “when I think of it now, that in our descent we were not dashed to\r\npieces against the ship’s side. We had to wait for each descent a\r\nfavourable moment while she was leaning over. Then the word of command was\r\ngiven, and we were slung down like sheep. My heart stood still whilst my\r\nlittle one was going down, and then I followed. It was a terrible sight\r\nfor a woman to see that poor creature whose baby was born the night\r\nbefore, looking like a corpse in a long dressing‐gown of white flannel,\r\nwith the poor little atom of mortality tightly clasped in her arms. I\r\nthought she would die before the day was over.”\r\n\r\nAt last they were all in the boat: four women, five children, the second\r\nmate, and sixteen sailors. The captain stayed on the ship, providing for\r\nthe safety of the drunken creatures who could not take care of themselves,\r\nand then he came off. How small the boat looked by the side of the tall\r\nship! And they had to get quickly out of her reach, for she was rolling so\r\nheavily that the waters near her boiled up like a maelström.\r\n\r\nAway they drifted, a mere speck upon the ocean. Before night there came a\r\nstorm of thunder, lightning, wind, and rain, that lasted through the\r\ndarkness, and by which they were drenched through and through. “I sat up,”\r\nsays the narrator, “for some twelve or fourteen hours on a narrow plank,\r\nwith my child in my arms, utterly miserable, cold, and hopeless, soaked to\r\nthe skin, blinded by the salt spray, my face and hands smarting\r\nintolerably with the unusual exposure.”\r\n\r\nDuring the storm and confusion the greater part of their biscuit had been\r\nsoaked with salt water, and made useless. It was also discovered that the\r\nfood collected for the captain’s boat had been thrown by mistake into the\r\nother, therefore it was necessary at once to put them on allowance: half a\r\npint of water and half a biscuit a day to each person. Except the biscuit,\r\nthere were only a few small tins of preserved strawberries and Indian\r\ncorn, and these were given to the ladies. “How the poor children cried\r\nwith hunger as the days dragged on!”\r\n\r\nThe boat leaked from the beginning, and the sailors by turns baled the\r\nwater out in little cans. Exposed to the glare of a tropical sun for hours\r\ntogether, nearly mad with thirst, bearing her child in her weak arms, for\r\nshe was too much exhausted to stand, Mrs. Murray says that often she would\r\nsit for hours without any thought at all, vacantly gazing on the ocean.\r\n\r\n“We had,” says she, “three days of dead calm. The sun glared down upon us\r\npitilessly, and I thought how pleasant it would be to throw myself into\r\nthe sea, and sink calmly to death beneath its waves. I lost all wish to\r\nlive—for life seemed horrible. I cannot describe the days as they passed\r\nseparately, one by one; when I look back upon them, they all seem to have\r\nbeen one misery. I remember that on the third day out poor Kitty’s baby\r\ndied—indeed, it had been dying from the first. It never had a chance of\r\nliving, for it had no fit attention and no sustenance. The poor mother\r\ncried bitterly when at last it became cold on her bosom, but its death was\r\na merciful release. Wrapped in a shawl of bright colours, it was thrown\r\noverboard, but was so light that it could not sink, and floated for hours\r\non a sea so calm in the hot sun that scarce a ripple could be seen. At\r\nlast it disappeared suddenly, the prey of some hungry shark, and when\r\nafterwards the horrid monsters crowded round our boat they added to our\r\nmisery. Hitherto the children had been plunged into the sea every morning\r\nto preserve them in health, but we dared not continue this practice with\r\nthose horrid creatures on our lee.... I must not forget one incident,\r\ntrifling in itself, but which might have caused the death of one of the\r\nsailors. On the day of the wreck I had caused two or three bottles of ale\r\nand one of claret to be put in the boat, thinking it might be of great use\r\nto us. On the third or fourth night out, when we were shivering helplessly\r\nafter a drenching shower of rain, we thought that a bottle of ale should\r\nbe opened for the women and children, but not a bottle of any sort was to\r\nbe found.” The rage of the captain was awful, and but for the intercession\r\nof the ladies, he swore that he would have thrown the man overboard.\r\n\r\nIt was on the morning of the tenth day that the frightful thought of\r\neating the children came into the heads of three or four desperate men,\r\nand the captain and a few trustworthy companions had made up their minds\r\nto slay the would‐be murderers that very night in their sleep. The last\r\nand fatal hour of their great agony seemed to be come. On the morning of\r\nthe tenth day a sail was reported, and a white towel hoisted to attract\r\nher attention. She came near enough for the captain to make out that she\r\ncarried the Hamburg flag, and then “passed by on the other side.” Curses\r\nloud and deep came from the sailors’ lips. Then the women looked into each\r\nother’s faces and the children cried, and the wolfish eyes of the would‐be\r\ncannibals were again fixed upon them.\r\n\r\nBut Heaven was merciful, and again a sail was reported. Nearer and nearer\r\nshe came, faster rowed the hungry sailors, when there rose a wild shout,\r\n“She has stopped!” and surely there she was at rest in the water, waiting\r\nto see what manner of beings they were. “Row faster, my men, and keep down\r\nthe women and children,” sang out the captain, for he was fearful that if\r\ntheir number was discovered the vessel might pass them, as had that seen\r\nin the morning.\r\n\r\n“Oh, what a lovely afternoon,” says Mrs. Murray, “that was when we were\r\nsaved—such a blaze of sunshine, such blue skies, such a glistening,\r\nglowing sea, as if even the treacherous ocean were rejoicing with us. At\r\nlength we were close alongside of the ship, and saw crowds of human beings\r\nclustering about to look at us—dark, swarthy faces, for they were all\r\nSpaniards, but full of pity, wonderment, and horror. They took us all in,\r\none by one, and when they saw the women and little children they wept.\r\nThey could not speak our language, and looked upon us with bewilderment,\r\nbut when I (who fortunately could speak Spanish), kneeling down on deck,\r\nsaid ‘Gracias a Dios’ (Thank God), their tongues were loosened, and there\r\nwas a flood of questions and crowding round us, with weeping and laughing\r\nand shaking of hands. How good were those kind‐hearted men! How I thank\r\nthem all, every one, now as I write, from the worthy captain down to the\r\nlowest of his crew. And they brought us bread and wine and water—precious\r\nwater, how good it was!”\r\n\r\nA few of Mrs. Brassey’s experiences on her husband’s yacht will be read\r\nwith interest. One day, after their five o’clock dinner, she and some of\r\nher children very nearly met with a most serious accident. “We were all\r\nsitting,” writes that lady, “or standing about the stern of the vessel,\r\nadmiring the magnificent dark blue billows following us, with their\r\ncurling white crests mountains high. Each wave, as it approached, appeared\r\nas if it must overwhelm us, instead of which it rushed grandly by, rolling\r\nand shaking us from stem to stern, and sending fountains of spray on\r\nboard.... A new hand was steering, and just at the moment when an\r\nunusually big wave overtook us he unfortunately allowed the vessel to\r\nbroach to a little. In a second the sea came pouring over the stern, above\r\nAllnut’s head. The boy was nearly washed overboard, but he managed to\r\ncatch hold of the rail, and with great presence of mind stuck his knees\r\ninto the bulwarks. Kindred, our boatswain, seeing his danger, rushed\r\nforward to save him, but was knocked down by the return wave, from which\r\nhe emerged gasping.\r\n\r\n“The coil of rope on which Captain Lecky and Mabelle were seated was\r\ncompletely floated by the sea. Providentially, however, he had taken a\r\ndouble turn round his wrist with a reefing point, and, throwing his other\r\narm round Mabelle, held on like grim death; otherwise, nothing could have\r\nsaved them. She was perfectly self‐possessed, and only said quietly, ‘Hold\r\non, Captain Lecky, hold on!’ to which he replied, ‘All right.’ I asked her\r\nafterwards if she thought she was going overboard, and she answered, ‘I\r\ndid not _think_ at all, mamma, but felt sure we were gone.’ Captain Lecky,\r\nbeing accustomed to very large ships, had not in the least realised how\r\nnear we were to the water in our little vessel, and was proportionately\r\ntaken by surprise. All the rest of the party were drenched, with the\r\nexception of Muriel, whom Captain Brown held high above the water in his\r\narms, and who lost no time in remarking, in the midst of the general\r\nconfusion ‘I’m not at all wet, I’m not!’ Happily, the children don’t know\r\nwhat fear is. The maids, however, were very frightened, as some of the sea\r\nhad got down into the nursery, and the skylights had to be screwed down.\r\nOur studding‐sail‐boom, too, broke with a loud crack when the ship\r\nbroached to, and the jaws of the fore‐boom gave way.\r\n\r\n“Soon after this adventure we all went to bed, full of thankfulness that\r\nit had ended as well as it did; but also not, so far as I am concerned, to\r\nrest in peace. In about two hours I was awakened by a tremendous weight of\r\nwater suddenly descending upon me and flooding the bed. I immediately\r\nsprang out, only to find myself in another pool on the floor. It was pitch\r\ndark, and I could not think what had happened; so I rushed on deck, and\r\nfound that, the weather having moderated a little, some kind sailor,\r\nknowing my love of fresh air, had opened the skylight rather too soon, and\r\none of the angry waves had popped on board, deluging the cabin.”\r\n\r\nThe _Sunbeam_ encountered a wreck, and the account given of its inspection\r\nwill be read with interest. Mrs. Brassey says:—“When I went on deck, at\r\nhalf‐past six, I found a grey, steamy, calm morning, promising a very hot\r\nday, without wind.\r\n\r\n“About 10.30 a.m. the cry of ‘Sail on the port helm!’ caused general\r\nexcitement, and in a few minutes every telescope and glass in the ship had\r\nbeen brought to bear upon the object which attracted our attention, and\r\nwhich was soon pronounced to be a wreck. Orders were given to starboard\r\nthe helm and to steer direct for the vessel; and many were the conjectures\r\nhazarded and the questions asked of the fortunate holders of glasses.\r\n‘What is she?’ ‘Is there any one on board?’ ‘Does she look as if she had\r\nbeen long abandoned?’ Soon we were near enough to send a boat’s crew on\r\nboard, whilst we watched their movements anxiously from the bridge. We\r\ncould now read her name—the _Carolina_—surmounted by a gorgeous yellow\r\ndecoration on her stern. She was of between two and three hundred tons\r\nburden, and was painted a light blue with a red streak. Beneath her white\r\nbowsprit the gaudy image of a woman served as a figure‐head. The two masts\r\nhad been snapped short off about three feet from the deck, and the\r\nbulwarks were gone, only the covering board and stanchions remaining, so\r\nthat each wave washed over and through her. The roof and supports of the\r\ndeck‐house and the companions were still left standing, but the sides had\r\ndisappeared, and the ship’s deck was burst up in such a manner as to\r\nremind one of a quail’s back.... We saw the men on board poking about,\r\napparently very pleased with what they had found; and soon our boat\r\nreturned to the yacht for some breakers, as the _Carolina_ had been laden\r\nwith port wine and cork, and the men wished to bring some of the former on\r\nboard. I changed my dress, and putting on my sea‐boots, started for the\r\nwreck.\r\n\r\n“We found the men rather excited over their discovery. The wine must have\r\nbeen very new and very strong, for the smell from it as it slopped about\r\nall over the deck was almost enough to intoxicate anybody. One pipe had\r\nalready been emptied into the breakers and barrels, and great efforts were\r\nmade to get some of the casks out whole; but this was found to be\r\nimpossible, without devoting more time to the operation than we chose to\r\nspare. The men managed to remove three half empty casks with their heads\r\nstove in, which they threw overboard, but the full ones would have\r\nrequired special appliances to raise them through the hatches. It proved\r\nexceedingly difficult to get at the wine, which was stowed underneath the\r\ncork, and there was also a quantity of cabin bulkheads and fittings\r\nfloating about under the influence of the long swell of the Atlantic. It\r\nwas a curious sight, standing on the roof of the deck‐house, to look into\r\nthe hold, full of floating bales of cork, barrels, and pieces of wood, and\r\nto watch the sea surging up in every direction through and over the deck,\r\nwhich was level with the water’s edge. I saw an excellent modern iron\r\ncooking‐stove washing about from side to side; but almost every other\r\nmovable article, including spars and ropes, had apparently been removed by\r\nprevious boarders.” It would have delayed them too long to tow her into\r\nport, or they might have recovered some £1,500 as salvage, while to blow\r\nher up would have required more powder than they had on board. So she was\r\nleft helplessly drifting about, a danger to any vessel running into her\r\nfull steam or sail almost as great as a sunken rock.\r\n\r\nLater, the owner of the _Sunbeam_ was of real service, for a fine vessel\r\nwas encountered, under full sail and on fire, her cargo being smelting\r\ncoal. Her red Union Jack was upside down, while her signals read the\r\nterrible announcement, “Ship on fire!” These were followed by the signal,\r\n“Come on board at once,” and a boat’s crew was at once despatched to the\r\nrescue. They were purposely well armed, and for the sufficient reason that\r\nthere was little sign of fire or smoke on board, and it was thought that\r\nthere might be a mutiny on board. In a few minutes the boat returned with\r\nthe chief mate, a fine‐looking Norwegian, who reported his vessel the\r\n_Monkshaven_, sixty‐eight days from Swansea, and bound for Valparaiso. The\r\nfire had been discovered five days previously, and the morning following\r\nthe first day the crew had got all their clothes and provisions on deck,\r\nand had thrown everything of a combustible nature—tar, oil, pitch, spare\r\nspars, and so forth—overboard. The hatches had then been battened down,\r\nbut all efforts to subdue the fire were unavailing. The officers and men\r\nhad been living on deck under a canvas screen, the water being a foot deep\r\neven there. When the hatches were opened for a moment, dense clouds of\r\nhot, suffocating yellow smoke immediately poured forth, driving back all\r\nwho approached. In such cases it is often difficult to find the location\r\nof the fire, which may at any time burst open the deck or burn a hole\r\nthrough the hull. The dangerous nature of such cargoes may be inferred\r\nfrom the fact that of every three vessels going out to Valparaiso or\r\nCallao, one catches fire, although, of course, the flames are often got\r\nunder control. They had encountered a terrific gale, and while burning had\r\nsignalled a large American steamship, which had contemptuously steamed\r\naway from them. When the men had all been transferred to the yacht—for it\r\nwas found impossible to save the barque—the poor fellows were almost wild\r\nwith joy and excitement. Soon after the fated vessel was blazing like a\r\ntar‐barrel, and the yacht steamed round her near enough for all on board\r\nto feel the heat. Fifteen extra mouths to feed was a serious addition to\r\nthe passengers and crew of the _Sunbeam_, and the water ration had to be\r\ncut down, but otherwise they had all they could wish, and a week later\r\nwere transferred to the Pacific Company’s mail steamer _Illimani_, then\r\nhomeward bound. The satisfaction which must have been felt by Mr. and Mrs.\r\nBrassey at having the ability as well as the will to save fifteen lives\r\nmay well be imagined.\r\n\r\nOne of woman’s noblest attributes is her readiness to help in the hour of\r\nneed, and its exercise has been by no means confined to the land. Late in\r\n1879 the British India Steam Navigation Company’s steamer _Eldorado_ had a\r\nhairbreadth escape from destruction in the Bay of Biscay. The rascally\r\nLascar crew abandoned their posts and gave themselves up to despair, and\r\nthe passengers “passed” coal to the stoke‐hole and worked hard at baling;\r\nmany ladies even volunteered to assist, and two American ladies acted as\r\nstewardesses and dispensed coffee and provisions to the rest.\r\n\r\n         [Illustration: THE RESCUE FROM THE ST. LAWRENCE RIVER.]\r\n\r\nHow often of late years have female swimmers saved life? The case to be\r\ncited, and which occurred in fresh water, is only one of scores that might\r\nbe recorded here. On the 5th December, 1879, two men had to cross the St.\r\nLawrence River, from La Rue Island to a wharf on the main shore. It was an\r\nintensely cold day, and a heavy gale was blowing strongly from the north‐\r\neast up the river. The men loaded their punt with a sleigh, and had\r\nmanaged to reach the middle of the channel, when a sudden and violent gust\r\nof wind swamped the punt and turned her over. The men clung to her while\r\nbottom upward, and tried to “tread” the water so as to get her to the\r\nshore, but in vain; the cold was so intense that their legs were benumbed\r\nabove the knees, and they gave themselves up for lost. They remained in\r\nthis perilous position for a considerable time, shouting loudly for help\r\ntill their throats were sore. Making a final effort, they shouted again,\r\nand this time their cries were heard at the house of a Mr. Darling, who,\r\nwith his family, resided close to the shore. That gentleman was ill in\r\nbed, but his wife and daughters, Maggie and Jessie, were at home, the men\r\nand boys being at work in the fields at a distance. On hearing the last\r\npainful shout of the drowning men, they quickly opened the door, to see\r\nthem struggling in the great river—a stream the width and volume of which\r\nsurpass anything in Europe. The first suggestion from the mother was to\r\nfetch the men from the fields, but before this could be done brave Maggie\r\nand Jessie—the latter a girl of sixteen years—had, without a word,\r\nlaunched the skiff, and were rowing with all their strength through the\r\ntroubled waters and driving storm. They had the greatest difficulty in\r\nreaching the exhausted and helpless men, but at last their noble effort\r\nwas rewarded, and in ten minutes the poor fellows were being chafed and\r\nwarmed by their father’s fire. Brave Maggie and Jessie! worthy successors,\r\nindeed, to your namesake, the heroine of the Longstone Light!\r\n\r\nThe story of Grace Darling must be familiar to our readers. The\r\ncircumstances which called forth her courage and humanity were as follow:—\r\n\r\nThe _Forfarshire_, a steamer of moderate size, left Hull for Dundee on the\r\nevening of September 5th, 1838, having on board a considerable amount of\r\nfreight and sixty‐three passengers and crew. Soon after leaving the Humber\r\nthe boilers began to leak, and on Thursday morning the weather became very\r\ntempestuous, while a thick mist enveloped the vessel. The steamer managed\r\nto pass the Fern Islands, on the way north, early on Thursday evening, but\r\nhad all she could do to make headway in a very heavy sea, while the\r\nalarming fact was discovered that her boilers’ leakage was increasing. As\r\nthe night advanced the weather became more and more boisterous, and\r\nsomewhere off Berwick it was found that the water from above was deluging\r\nthe furnace fires. Off St. Abb’s Head, the engineer reported that the\r\nmachinery would work no longer; the sails were accordingly set, and the\r\nvessel allowed to drive before the wind, which took her southward. Before\r\ndaybreak on Friday morning the roar of breakers near at hand was heard;\r\nand the captain tried hard to avert the appalling catastrophe which seemed\r\ninevitable, and steer the vessel between the islands and the mainland,\r\nthrough a channel known as the Fair Way. But the _Forfarshire_ would not\r\nanswer her helm, and was driven hither and thither by a furious sea. The\r\nscene at this juncture baffles description. Utter darkness enveloped the\r\ndoomed vessel, over which the sea broke in tremendous waves, and the noise\r\nof which almost drowned the agonising shrieks of the passengers. The\r\nvessel, a few minutes later, struck a rock, her bows banging and crashing\r\nupon it. At this moment a rush was made by eight of the crew to a boat,\r\nwhich they lowered successfully, one almost naked and frenzied passenger\r\njumping into it after them. The ship was now at her last extremity.\r\n\r\n  “Then some leaped overboard with dreadful yell,\r\n    As eager to anticipate their grave;\r\n  And the sea yawned around her like a hell,\r\n    And down she sucked with her the whirling wave,\r\n  Like one who grapples with his enemy,\r\n    And strives to strangle him before he die.”\r\n\r\nA moment or two after the first shock, another great sea struck her,\r\nraising her high in the air and then bringing her down with a terrific\r\ncrash on the jagged reef, and with a shock so tremendous that she\r\nliterally broke in two. The whole of the upper part of the vessel,\r\nincluding the chief cabin, filled with passengers, was swept away, and\r\nsank almost immediately. Every soul on that part of the vessel was\r\nengulfed in an ocean grave. Good George Herbert says truly, “He that will\r\nlearn to pray, let him go to sea.”\r\n\r\nThe fore part of the vessel remained spitted on a rocky projection; and\r\nhad the _Forfarshire_ drifted a few yards further to the south‐west she\r\nwould have escaped her terrible fate, as the rock there descends almost\r\nprecipitously into deep water. Meantime, at the Fern Lighthouse, a mile\r\noff, nothing had been seen of the actual occurrence, but at seven o’clock\r\nthe vessel was noticed lying on the rock. The weather was so bad that the\r\nlighthouse‐keeper, Mr. Darling, doubted the possibility of rendering\r\nassistance. But his daughter Grace entreated her father to go off in the\r\nboat at all risks, and offered herself to take one oar. Mr. Darling, thus\r\nurged, though knowing the danger of the attempt, agreed, and mother and\r\ndaughter aided him in launching the boat. After a hard pull through the\r\nboiling foam, they reached the rock, where they found nine persons\r\nshivering in the cold and wet, and trembling for their lives. As\r\nillustrative of the heroism displayed in this rescue, it may be mentioned\r\nthat had it not been ebb tide the boat could not have passed between the\r\nislands; and Darling and his daughter knew that the tide would be flowing\r\non their return, and that their united strength would have been quite\r\ninsufficient to pull back to the lighthouse. But for the assistance of the\r\nsurvivors all would have had to remain on the fatal rock. The joy of the\r\nrescued people may well be imagined, and their surprise, and indeed\r\namazement, at finding that one of their deliverers was a young girl. At\r\nthe lighthouse food and warmth soon restored their exhausted powers. Among\r\nthose rescued was a bereaved mother, who had seen her two only children\r\nperish before her eyes.\r\n\r\nGrace Darling’s name and fame are historic; she lived but a short time\r\nafter the tragic event just recorded, but long enough to receive the\r\nhonours due to her for an act of unparalleled heroism, even receiving the\r\nacknowledgments of the Queen and a handsome sum of money from the public.\r\n\r\n  “She who amid the tempest shone,\r\n      The angel of the wave,”\r\n\r\nwas not, as might be supposed, a robust girl, but, on the contrary, quite\r\ndelicate.

Mr. Pinkerton, an ingenious correspondent of that\r\nvaluable medium of inquiry, _Notes and Queries_,(25) argues as follows,\r\nand his opinion is entitled to respect. He says:—“I have arrived at the\r\nconclusion that the phrase is derived from the Scriptural account of the\r\nprophet Jonah. The word _locker_, on board ship, generally means the place\r\nwhere any particular thing is retained or kept, as ‘the bread locker,’\r\n‘shot locker,’ &c. In the ode in the second chapter of the Book of Jonah,\r\nwe find that the prophet, praying for deliverance, describes his situation\r\nin the following words:—‘In the midst of the seas; and the floods\r\ncompassed me about; the depth closed me round about; the earth with her\r\nbars was about me.’\r\n\r\n“The sea, then, might not misappropriately be termed by a rude mariner\r\nJonah’s locker: that is, the place where Jonah was kept or confined.\r\nJonah’s locker, in time, might readily be corrupted to _Jones’s_ locker,\r\nand Davy, as a very common Welsh accompaniment of the equally Welsh name\r\nJones, added; the true derivation of the phrase having been forgotten.”\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, it is of the hidden treasures of the ocean locker and\r\nits explorers we would now speak. And first let us take a glance at the\r\npearl, coral, and sponge fisheries,(26) as they are somewhat incorrectly\r\ncalled, inasmuch as it will pave the way to the subject of divers and\r\ndiving.\r\n\r\nThe pearl oyster (_Meleagrina margaritifera_) is the most valuable and\r\ninteresting of all the nacre (mother‐of‐pearl) bearing shells. The shell\r\nis nearly round, and greenish in colour on the outside; it furnishes at\r\nonce the finest pearls, under favourable circumstances, and the nacre so\r\nuseful in many industrial arts. Fine pearl and nacre have, in short, the\r\nsame origin. The nacre invests the whole interior of the shell, being the\r\nsame secretion which, in the pearl, has assumed the globular form; in one\r\nstate it is deposited as nacre on the walls of the bivalve, in the other\r\nas a pearl in the fleshy interior of the animal. Between nacre and pearls,\r\ntherefore, there is only the difference of the form of the deposition. The\r\nfinest pearls—“solidified drops of dew,” as the Orientals poetically term\r\nthem—are secretions of nacrous material spread over foreign bodies which\r\nhave accidentally got beneath the mantle of the mollusc. The animal, if\r\nirritated by the intrusion of only a grain of sand, and being unable to\r\nremove it, covers it with a natural secretion, and the pearl gradually\r\ngrows in size. Almost invariably some foreign body is found in their\r\ncentre, if broken, which has served as a nucleus to this concretion, the\r\nbody being, perhaps, a sterile egg of the mollusc, the egg of a fish, or a\r\ngrain of sand, round which has been deposited in concentric layers the\r\nbeautiful and much prized gem.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese and other Eastern nations turn this fact in the natural\r\nhistory of this bivalve to practical use in making pearls and cameos. By\r\nintroducing into the mantle of the mollusc, or into the interior of its\r\nbody, a round grain of sand, glass, or metal, they induce a deposit which\r\nin time yields a pearl, in the one case free, and in the other adhering to\r\nthe shell.\r\n\r\nPearls are sometimes produced in whole chaplets by the insertion of grains\r\nof quartz connected by a string into the mantle of a species of\r\n_Meleagrina_; in other cases, a dozen enamelled figures of Buddha seated\r\nhave been produced by inserting small plates of embossed metal in the\r\nvalves of the same species. The pearls are very naturally small at first,\r\nbut increase by the annual layers deposited on the original nucleus, their\r\nbrilliancy and shade of colour varying with that of the nacre from which\r\nthey are produced. Sometimes they are diaphanous, silky, lustrous, and\r\nmore or less iridescent; occasionally they turn out dull, obscure, and\r\neven smoky.\r\n\r\nThe pearl oyster is met with in very different latitudes. They are found\r\nin the Persian Gulf, on the Arabian coast, and in Japan, in the American\r\nseas, and in the islands of the South Sea; but the most important\r\nfisheries are found in the Bay of Bengal, Ceylon, and other parts of the\r\nIndian Ocean. The Ceylon fisheries are under Government inspection, and\r\neach year, before the fisheries commence, an official inspection of the\r\ncoast takes place. Sometimes the fishing is undertaken on account of the\r\nState, at other times it is let to parties of speculators. In 1804 the\r\npearl fishery was granted to a capitalist for £120,000; but, to avoid\r\nimpoverishing all the beds at once, the same part of the gulf is not\r\nfished every year; and, indeed, sometimes the oysters disappoint the\r\nscientists and practical finders by migrating.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: PEARL OYSTER (_Meleagrina margaritifera_).]\r\n\r\nThe great fishery for mother‐o’‐pearl takes place in the Gulf of Manaar, a\r\nlarge bay to the north‐east of Ceylon. It occupies 250 boats, which come\r\nfrom different parts of the coast; they reach the ground at daybreak, the\r\ntime being indicated by a signal gun. Each boat’s crew consists of twenty\r\nhands and a negro. The rowers are ten in number. The divers divide\r\nthemselves into two groups of five men each, who labour and rest\r\nalternately; they descend from forty to fifty feet, seventy being about\r\nthe utmost they can accomplish, and eighty seconds the longest period the\r\nbest diver can remain under water, the ordinary period being only thirty\r\nseconds. In order to accelerate their descent a large stone is attached to\r\na rope. The oars are used to form a stage, across which planks are laid\r\nover both sides of the boat; to this stage the diving‐stone is suspended.\r\nThis stone is in the form of a pyramid, weighing thirty or more pounds;\r\nthe cord which sustains it sometimes carries in its lower part a sort of\r\nstirrup to receive the foot of the diver. At the moment of his descent he\r\nplaces his right foot in this stirrup, or, where there is no such\r\nprovision, he rests it on the stone with the cord between his toes. In his\r\nleft foot he holds the net which is to receive the bivalves; then seizing\r\nwith his right hand a signal cord conveniently arranged for this purpose,\r\nand pressing his nostrils with the left hand, he dives, holding himself\r\nvertically, and balancing himself over his foot. Each diver is naked,\r\nexcept for a band of calico which surrounds his loins. Having reached the\r\nbottom, he withdraws his foot from the stone, which ascends immediately to\r\nthe stage. The diver throws himself on his face, and begins to gather all\r\nthe proper shells within his reach, placing them in his net. When he\r\nwishes to ascend he pulls the signal cord, and is drawn up with all\r\npossible expedition. A good diver seldom remains more than thirty seconds\r\nunder water at one time, although some can remain considerably longer, but\r\nhe repeats the operation three or four, and, in favourable circumstances,\r\neven fifteen or twenty times. The labour is extremely severe, and they are\r\nshort‐lived. On returning to the boat they sometimes discharge water\r\ntinged with blood by the mouth, nose, and ears. They are also exposed to\r\ngreat danger from sword‐fish and sharks, which lie in wait for and\r\nfrequently devour the unhappy victim. They continue to fish till mid‐day,\r\nbut are expected to return long before dark. Mrs. Brassey explains that\r\nwhen a boat with pearls reaches the shore the shells are divided into\r\nequal heaps, one‐fourth going to the boat’s crew and three‐fourths to the\r\nGovernment inspector. They keep whichever heap he chooses to kick, so\r\nthat, being uncertain in which heap the best pearls are, the chances are\r\ngood enough. The heaps are then divided and sold by auction in thousands,\r\nand then sub‐divided again. Gambling is such an Oriental proclivity that\r\nthe merest beggar will buy a few of the shells, hoping to find a pearl of\r\ngreat value; and should he fail to do so, he still has got his oyster!\r\n“Some of the oysters are taken in sealed‐up sacks to Colombo, Kandy, and\r\nother inland places, in order to enable people to indulge their love of\r\ngambling and speculation.” Sir Emerson Tennant tells us that the depleted\r\npearl oyster‐shells of the Condatchy fisheries, which date back two\r\nthousand years, form an immense bank on the beach, extending for miles. In\r\npast times the Ceylon fisheries were more valuable than at present. In\r\n1797 they are said to have produced £144,000, and in 1798 as much as\r\n£192,000. In 1802 the fisheries were farmed for £120,000; but for many\r\nyears the banks have been less productive, and are now said to yield only\r\nthe sum of £20,000 per annum.\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: DIVING FOR PEARLS.]\r\n\r\nThe natives of the Bay of Bengal, those of the Chinese coast, of Japan,\r\nand the Indian Archipelago, all devote themselves to the pearl fishery,\r\nthe produce being estimated to realise at least £800,000. Fisheries\r\nanalogous to those of Ceylon take place on the Persian coast, on the\r\nArabian Gulf, along the coast of Muscat, and in the Red Sea. Arrived on\r\ntheir fishing‐ground, the fishermen of the Red Sea range their barques at\r\na proper distance from each other, and cast anchor in water from eight to\r\nnine fathoms deep. The process is pursued here in a very simple manner.\r\nWhen about to descend, the divers pass a cord, the extremity of which\r\ncommunicates with a bell placed in the barque, under the armpits; they put\r\ncotton in their ears, and press the nostrils together with a piece of wood\r\nor horn; they close their mouths hermetically, attach a heavy stone to\r\ntheir feet, and at once sink to the bottom of the sea, where they gather\r\nindiscriminately all shells within their reach, which they throw into a\r\nbag suspended round their haunches. When they require to breathe they\r\nsound the bell, and immediately they are assisted in their ascent. On the\r\noyster‐banks off the isle of Bahrein the pearl fishery produces about\r\n£240,000; and if we add to this the product of the other fisheries in the\r\nneighbourhood, the sum total yielded by the Arabian coast would probably\r\nnot fall short of £350,000. In South America similar fisheries exist.\r\nBefore the Mexican conquest the pearl fisheries were located between\r\nAcapulco and the Gulf of Tchuantepic; subsequently they were established\r\nround the islands of Cubagua, Margarita, and Panama. The results became so\r\nfull of promise that populous cities were not slow to raise themselves\r\nround these several places. Under the reign of Charles V. America sent to\r\nSpain pearls valued at £160,000; in the present day the annual yield is\r\nestimated to be worth £60,000.\r\n\r\nPearls form, of course, the most important product of the animal. When\r\nthey are adherent to the valves they are detached with pincers; but as a\r\nrule they are found in the oyster’s soft tissues. In this case the\r\nsubstance is boiled, and afterwards sifted, in order to obtain the most\r\nminute of the pearls; for those of considerable size are sometimes\r\noverlooked in the first operation. Months after the mollusc is putrefied\r\nmiserable Indians may be observed busying themselves with the corrupt\r\nmass, in search of small pearls which may have been overlooked by the\r\nworkmen.\r\n\r\nThe pearls adherent to the valve are more or less irregular in their\r\nshape; they are sold by weight. Those found in the body of the animal, and\r\nisolated, are called _virgin pearls_. They are globular, ovoid, or\r\npyriform, and are sold by the individual pearl. In cleaning them, they are\r\ngathered together in a heap in a bag, and worked with powdered nacre, in\r\norder to render them perfectly pure in colour and round in shape, and give\r\nthem a polish; finally, they are passed through a series of copper sieves,\r\nin order to size them. These sieves, to the number of a thousand, are made\r\nso as to be inserted one within the other, each being pierced with holes,\r\nwhich determine the size of the pearl and the commercial number which is\r\nto distinguish it. Thus, the sieve No. 20 is pierced with twenty holes,\r\nNo. 50 with fifty holes, and so on up to No. 1,000, which is pierced with\r\nthat number of holes. The pearls which are retained in Nos. 20 to 80, said\r\nto be _mill_, are pearls of the first order; those which pass and are\r\nretained between Nos. 100 and 800 are vivadoe, or pearls of the second\r\norder; and those which pass through all the others, and are retained in\r\nNo. 1,000, belong to the class _tool_, or seed pearls, and are of the\r\nthird order. They are afterwards threaded; the small and medium‐sized\r\npearls on white or blue silk, arranged in rows, and tied with ribbon into\r\na top‐knot of blue or red silk, in which condition they are exposed for\r\nsale in rows, assorted according to their colours and quality. The small\r\nor seed pearls are sold by measure or weight.\r\n\r\nWe cannot wonder at the estimation in which these beautiful productions of\r\nnature have always been held. Our Lord speaks of “a merchantman seeking\r\ngoodly pearls,” and once of a “pearl of great price.” The ancients held\r\nthem in great esteem. Ahasuerus had a chamber with tapestry covered with\r\nvaluable pearls. Julius Cæsar offered to Servilia, the mother of Brutus,\r\nan “Orient pearl,” valued at money representing a million sesterces;(27)\r\nCleopatra’s expensive draught is estimated by Pliny at the equivalent of\r\n£80,729; Lollia Paulina, wife of Caligula, used to put on about £200,000\r\nsterling’s worth of them on high days and holidays.\r\n\r\nIn our own country Sir Thomas Gresham powdered up a pearl worth £65,000,\r\nin Queen Elizabeth’s time, and drank it up _à la_ Cleopatra, excepting\r\nonly that he took it in wine instead of in vinegar. It was done in vain‐\r\nglory to outshine the Spanish ambassador, with whom he had wagered to give\r\na more expensive entertainment than he could.\r\n\r\nScottish pearls, which are slightly bluish in tint, were much celebrated\r\nin the Middle Ages, and were sent to London from the rivers Tay and Isla;\r\nthe trade carried on in the present century, the Rev. Mr. Bertram tells\r\nus, has become of considerable importance.\r\n\r\nThe pearl, according to the same authority, is found in a variety of the\r\nmussel which is characterised by the valves being united by a broad hinge.\r\n“The pearl fisheries of Scotland,” he adds, “may become a source of wealth\r\nto the people living on the large rivers, if prudently conducted.” Mr.\r\nUnger, a dealer in gems in Edinburgh, having discerned the capabilities of\r\nthe Scotch pearl as a gem of value, has established a scale of prices\r\nwhich he gives for them, according to their size and quality; and the\r\nbeautiful pearls of our Scottish streams are now admired beyond the Orient\r\npearl. Empresses and queens, and royal and noble ladies, have made large\r\npurchases of these gems. Mr. Unger estimates the sum paid to pearl‐finders\r\nin the summer of 1864 at £10,000. The localities successfully fished have\r\nbeen the classic Doon, the Forth, the Tay, the Don, the Spey, the Isla,\r\nand most of the Highland rivers of note.\r\n\r\nPassing on to another of ocean’s beautiful treasures, coral, it must be\r\nunderstood that the valuable coral of commerce used for purposes of\r\nornament has little in common with that of the coral islands, while in a\r\nscientific point of view it does not come under the same classification at\r\nall. The coral used in jewellery, carvings, and ornaments belongs to the\r\ngroup _Corallinæ_, of the order _Gorgonidæ_, while that of the reefs or\r\nislands belongs to the large group of Madrepores.\r\n\r\n                          [Illustration: CORAL.]\r\n\r\n                      [Illustration: CORAL ISLAND.]\r\n\r\nThe coral was long considered a sea‐plant, but what was once taken for a\r\nflower is, in fact, a kind of polyp, which lives in colonies. A branch of\r\nliving coral is an aggregation of animals united among themselves by a\r\ncommon tissue, yet seemingly enjoying a separate existence. The branch\r\nundoubtedly owes its origin to an egg, and consists of two distinct\r\nparts—the one hard, brittle, and stony; the other external, and soft and\r\nfleshy. The latter is a united family of polyps, animals having feelers or\r\ntentacles, and very sensitive, and further, possessing generative or\r\nbudding powers. The subject is, however, of a nature too scientific to be\r\nfully treated here. The Greeks called it a “daughter of the sea,” and as\r\nin so many other things, they were right. The fisheries are principally\r\nconfined to the Mediterranean, and the fishing is conducted mainly by\r\nsailors from Genoa, Leghorn, and Naples. It is so fatiguing that it is a\r\ncommon saying in Italy that a sailor obliged to go to the coral fishery\r\nmust either be a thief or an assassin. The saying conveys a good idea\r\nenough of the occupation. The best men can only earn four to six hundred\r\nfrancs (£16 to £24) in the season of six months. They work eighteen hours\r\nper diem, and are allowed very little more rations than unlimited biscuit\r\nand water. “The barques sent to the fishing range from six to fifteen\r\ntons; they are strong, and well adapted for the labour; their rig is a\r\ngreat lateen sail and a jib or staysail. The stern is reserved for the\r\ncapstan, the fishers, and the crew; the fore part of the vessel is\r\nreserved for the requirements of the padrone or master.\r\n\r\n“The lines, wood, and irons employed in the coral fisheries are called the\r\nengine; it consists of a cross of wood formed of two bars strongly lashed\r\nor bolted together at their centre; below this a great stone is attached,\r\nwhich bears the lines, arranged in the form of a sac. These lines have\r\ngreat meshes, loosely knotted together, resembling the well‐known swab.\r\n\r\n                      [Illustration: CORAL FISHING.]\r\n\r\n“The apparatus carries thirty of these sacs, which are intended to grapple\r\nall they come in contact with at the bottom of the sea. They are spread\r\nout in all directions by the movement of the boat. The coral is known to\r\nattach itself to the summit of a rock, and to develop itself, forming\r\nbanks there, and it is to these rocks that the swab attaches itself so as\r\nto tear up the precious harvest. Experience, which in time becomes almost\r\nintuitive, guides the Italian fisher in discovering the coral banks....\r\n\r\n“When the padrone thinks he has reached a coral bank, he throws his engine\r\noverboard. As soon as the apparatus is fairly at the bottom the speed of\r\nthe vessel is slacked, the capstan is manned by six or eight men, while\r\nthe others guide the helm and trim the sails. Two forces are thus brought\r\nto act upon the lines, the horizontal action of the vessel and the\r\nvertical action of the capstan. In consequence of the many inequalities of\r\nthe rocky bottom, the engine advances by jerks, the vessel yielding more\r\nor less according to the concussion caused by the action of the capstan or\r\nsail. The engine seizes upon the rugged rocks at the bottom, and raises\r\nthem to let them fall again. In this manner the swab, floating about,\r\npenetrates beneath the rocks where the coral is found, and is hooked on to\r\nit. To fix the lines upon the coral and bring them home is a work of very\r\ngreat labour. The engine long resists the most energetic and repeated\r\nefforts of the crew, who, exposed half naked to the burning sun of the\r\nMediterranean, work the capstan to which the cable and engine are\r\nattached, while the padrone urges and excites them to increased exertion;\r\nthe sailors meanwhile trim the sails, and sing with a slow and monotonous\r\ntone a song, the words of which improvise in a sort of psalmody the names\r\nof the saints most revered among the seafaring Italian population.\r\n\r\n“The lines are finally brought home, tearing or breaking blocks of rock,\r\nsometimes of enormous size, which are brought on board. The cross is now\r\nplaced on the side of the vessel, the lines are arranged on the deck, and\r\nthe crew occupy themselves in gathering the results of their labour. The\r\ncoral is gathered together, the branches of the precious alcyonarian are\r\ncleansed and divested of the shells and other parasitic products which\r\naccompany them; finally, the produce is carried to and sold in the ports\r\nof Messina, Naples, Genoa, or Leghorn, where the workers in jewellery\r\npurchase them. Behold, fair reader, with what hard labour, fatigue, and\r\nperil, the elegant bijouterie with which you are decked is torn from the\r\ndeepest bed of the ocean.” Coral is worth from as little as two or three\r\nshillings a _ton_ to as high as £10 sterling per pound.\r\n\r\nAlthough the corals of the so‐called coral islands are merely good as\r\ncuriosities, they are very interesting in a scientific and artistic point\r\nof view. Darwin(28) has reasoned very conclusively on the formation of the\r\nreefs. He says:—“The earlier voyagers fancied that the coral‐building\r\nanimals instinctively built up their great corals to afford themselves\r\nprotection in the inner parts; but so far is this from the truth, that\r\nthose massive kinds to whose growth on the exposed outer shores the very\r\nexistence of the reef depends cannot live within the lagoon, where other\r\ndelicately‐branching kinds flourish.” Moreover, in this view, many species\r\nof distinct genera and families are supposed to combine for one end; and\r\nof such a combination not a single instance can be found in the whole of\r\nNature. The theory that has been most generally received is that atolls\r\nare based on submarine craters, but when the form and size of some of them\r\nare considered this idea loses its plausible character. Thus, the Suadiva\r\natoll is forty‐four geographical miles in diameter in one line by thirty‐\r\nfour in another; Rimsky is fifty‐four by twenty miles across; Bow atoll is\r\nthirty miles long, and, on an average, six miles broad. This theory,\r\nmoreover, is totally inapplicable to the Northern Maldivian atolls in the\r\nIndian Ocean, one of which is eighty‐eight miles in length, and between\r\nten and twenty in breadth.\r\n\r\nThe various theories which had been propounded as to the existence of the\r\ncoral islands being unsatisfactory, Mr. Darwin was led to re‐consider the\r\nwhole subject. Numerous soundings taken all round the Cocos atoll showed\r\nthat at ten fathoms the prepared tallow in the hollow of the sounding rod\r\ncame up perfectly clean, and marked with the impression of living polyps.\r\nAs the depth increased these impressions became less numerous, but\r\nadhering particles of sand succeeded, until it was evident that the bottom\r\nconsisted of smooth mud. From these observations it was obvious to him\r\nthat the utmost depth at which the coral polyps can construct reefs is\r\nbetween twenty and thirty fathoms. Now, there are enormous areas in the\r\nIndian Ocean in which every island is a coral formation, raised to the\r\nheight to which the waves can throw up fragments and the winds pile up\r\nsand; and the only theory which seems to account for all the circumstances\r\nembraced is that of the subsidence of vast regions in this ocean. “As\r\nmountain after mountain and island after island slowly sank beneath the\r\nwater,” he says, “fresh bases could be successively afforded for the\r\ngrowth of the corals. I venture to defy any one to explain in any other\r\nmanner how it is possible that numerous islands should be distributed\r\nthroughout vast areas, all the islands being low, all built of coral,\r\nabsolutely requiring a foundation within a limited depth below the\r\nsurface.”\r\n\r\nDarwin’s description of the island of Cocos, or Keeling, is as\r\nfollows:—“The ring‐formed reef of the lagoon island is surmounted in the\r\ngreater part of its length by linear islets. On the northern or leeward\r\nside there is an opening through which vessels can pass to the anchorage\r\nwithin. On entering, the scene was very curious and rather pretty; its\r\nbeauty, however, entirely depended on the brilliancy of the surrounding\r\ncolours. The shallow, clear, and still water of the lagoon, resting in its\r\ngreater part on white sand, is, when illuminated by a vertical sun, of the\r\nmost vivid green. This brilliant expanse, several miles in width, is on\r\nall sides divided, either by a line of snow‐white breakers from the dark\r\nheaving waters of the ocean, or from the blue vault of heaven by the\r\nstrips of land crowned by the level tops of the cocoa‐nut tree. As a white\r\ncloud here and there affords a pleasing contrast to the azure sky, so in\r\nthe lagoon bands of living coral darken the emerald‐green water.\r\n\r\n“The next morning I went ashore on Direction Island. The strip of dry land\r\nis only a few hundred yards in width; on the lagoon side there was a white\r\ncalcareous beach, the radiation from which, under this sultry climate, was\r\nvery oppressive. On the outer coast, a solid, broad, flat coral rock\r\nserved to break the violence of the open sea. Excepting near the lagoon,\r\nwhere there is some sand, the land is entirely composed of rounded\r\nfragments of coral. In such a loose, dry, stony soil, the climate of the\r\nintertropical regions alone could produce so vigorous a vegetation.\r\n\r\n“On some of the smaller islets nothing could be more elegant than the\r\nmanner in which the young and full‐grown cocoa‐nut trees, without\r\ndestroying each other’s symmetry, were mingled into one wood. A beach of\r\nglittering white sand formed a border to those fairy spots.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Brassey writes enthusiastically of some coral fields in the South\r\nPacific. “It is really impossible to describe the beauty of the scene\r\nbefore us. Submarine coral forests of every colour, studded with sea‐\r\nflowers, anemones, and echinidæ, of a brilliancy only to be seen in\r\ndreamland; shoals of the brightest and swiftest fish darting and flashing\r\nin and out; shells, every one of which was fit to hold the place of honour\r\nin a conchologist’s collection moving slowly along with their living\r\ninmates: this is what we saw when we looked down from the side of the boat\r\ninto the depths below. The surface of the water glittered with every\r\nimaginable tint, from the palest aquamarine to the brightest emerald, from\r\nthe pure light blue of the turquoise to the deepest dark blue of the\r\nsapphire, and was dotted here and there with patches of red, brown, and\r\ngreen coral, rising from the mass below. Before us, on the shore, there\r\nspread the rich growth of tropical vegetation, shaded by palms and cocoa‐\r\nnuts, and enlivened by the presence of native women in red, blue, and\r\ngreen garments, and men in motley costumes, bringing fish, fowls, and\r\nbunches of cocoa‐nuts, borne, like the grapes brought back from the land\r\nof Canaan by the spies, on poles.\r\n\r\n“At 5 p.m. we went for a row in the _Glance_ and the _Flash_ to the coral\r\nreef, now illumined by the rays of the setting sun. Who can describe these\r\nwonderful gardens of the deep, on which we now gazed through ten and\r\ntwenty fathoms of crystal water! Who can enumerate or describe the strange\r\ncreatures moving about and darting hither and thither amid the masses of\r\ncoral forming their submarine home! There were shells of rare shape,\r\nbrighter than if they had been polished by the hand of the most skilful\r\nartist; crabs of all sizes scuttling and sliding along; sea‐anemones\r\nspreading their delicate feelers in search of prey, and many other kinds\r\nof zoophytes crawling slowly over the reef, and scarlet, blue, yellow,\r\ngold, violet, spotted, striped, and winged fish, short, long, pointed, and\r\nblunt, of the most varied shapes, were darting about like birds among the\r\ncoral trees.”\r\n\r\nDarwin speaks of the grandeur of the outer shore of these lagoon islands.\r\nHe says:—“There is a simplicity in the barrier‐like beach, the margin of\r\ngreen bushes and tall cocoa‐nuts, the solid flat of dead coral rock,\r\nstrewed here and there with great loose fragments, and the line of furious\r\nbreakers all rounding away towards either hand. The ocean, throwing its\r\nwaters over the broad reef, appears an invincible, all‐powerful enemy; yet\r\nwe see it resisted, and even conquered, by means which at first seem most\r\nweak and insufficient. It is not that the ocean spares the rock of coral;\r\nthe great fragments scattered over the reef and heaped on the beach whence\r\nthe tall cocoa‐nut‐trees spring plainly bespeak the unrelenting power of\r\nthe waves. Nor are any periods of repose granted; the long swell caused by\r\nthe gentle but steady action of the trade‐winds, always blowing in one\r\ndirection over a wide area, causes breakers almost equalling in force\r\nthose during a gale of wind in the temperate regions, and which never\r\ncease to rage. It is impossible to behold these waves without feeling a\r\nconviction that an island, though built of the hardest rock—let it be\r\nporphyry, granite, or quartz—would ultimately yield and be demolished by\r\nsuch an irresistible power. Yet these low, insignificant coral islets\r\nstand, and are victorious; for here another power, as an antagonist, takes\r\npart in the contest. The organic forces separate the atoms of carbonate of\r\nlime one by one from the foaming breakers, and unite them into a\r\nsymmetrical structure. Let the hurricane tear up its thousand huge\r\nfragments, yet what will that tell against the accumulated labour of\r\nmyriads of architects at work night and day, month after month? Thus do we\r\nsee the soft and gelatinous body of a polyp, through the agency of the\r\nvital laws, conquering the great mechanical power of the waves of an ocean\r\nwhich neither the art of man nor the inanimate works of nature could\r\nsuccessfully resist.” The poet summed the matter rightly when he wrote:—\r\n\r\n  “Millions of millions thus, from age to age,\r\n  With simplest skill and toil unwearyable,\r\n  No moment and no movement unimproved,\r\n  Laid line on line, on terrace terrace spread,\r\n  To swell the heightening, brightening, gradual mound,\r\n  By marvellous structure climbing towards the day....\r\n  I saw the living pile ascend,\r\n  The mausoleum of its architects,\r\n  Still dying upward as their labour closed....\r\n  Frail were their frames, ephemeral their lives,\r\n  Their masonry imperishable. All\r\n  Life’s needful functions, food, exertion, rest,\r\n  By nice economy of Providence\r\n  Were overruled to carry on the process\r\n  Which out of water brought forth solid rock.”\r\n\r\nAnd now we arrive at the last of the valuable fisheries in which divers\r\nare concerned—that of the sponge. The ancients recognised the fact that\r\nthe sponge exhibited vitality, but were rather undecided as to whether it\r\nshould be counted animal or vegetable. Rondelet—the friend of the\r\ncelebrated Rabelais, whom the merry curate of Meudon designated under the\r\nname of _Rondibilis_—himself a physician and naturalist of Montpellier,\r\nlong promulgated the idea that these productions belonged to the vegetable\r\nkingdom. Linnæus late in life withdrew the sponges from among the\r\nvegetables, for he had satisfied himself, in short, that they fairly\r\nbelonged to the animal kingdom. Sponges live at the bottom of the sea in\r\nfrom 500 to 1,250 fathoms of water, among the clefts and crevices of the\r\nrocks, always adhering and attaching themselves, not only to inorganic\r\nbodies, but even growing on algæ and animals, spreading, erect, or\r\npendent, according to the body which supports them and their natural\r\nhabit.\r\n\r\nFiguier tells us that all naturalists are now satisfied of the animal\r\nnature of sponges, although they once were thought to represent the lowest\r\nand most obscure grade of animal existence, and that so close to the\r\nconfines of the vegetable world that it was considered difficult to some\r\nspecies to determine whether they were on the one side or the other.\r\n“Several of them, however,” says Mr. Gosse, “if viewed with a lens under\r\nwater while in a living state, display vigorous currents constantly\r\npouring forth from certain orifices, and we necessarily infer that the\r\nwater thus ejected must be constantly taken in through some other channel.\r\nOn tearing the mass open, we see that the whole substance is perforated in\r\nall directions by irregular canals leading into each other, of which some\r\nare slender, and communicate with the surface by minute but numerous\r\npores, and others are wide, and open by ample orifices; through the former\r\nthe water is admitted, through the latter it is ejected.”\r\n\r\n         [Illustration: SPONGE FISHING OFF THE COAST OF GREECE.]\r\n\r\nAt the present time sponge fishing takes place principally in the Grecian\r\nArchipelago and the Syrian coasts. The Greeks and Syrians sell the product\r\nof their fishing to the western nations, and the trade has been immensely\r\nextended in recent times. Fishing usually commences towards the beginning\r\nof June on the coast of Syria, and finishes at the end of October. But the\r\nmonths of July and August are peculiarly favourable to the sponge harvest,\r\nif we may use the term. Latakia furnishes about ten boats to the fishery,\r\nBatoum twenty, Tripoli twenty‐five to thirty, Kalki fifty, Simi about 170\r\nto 180, and Kalminos more than 200. The boat’s crew consists of four or\r\nfive men, who scatter themselves along the coast for two or three miles,\r\nin search of sponges under the cliffs and ledges of rock. Sponges of\r\ninferior quality are gathered in shallow waters. The finer kinds are found\r\nonly at a depth of from twenty to thirty fathoms. The first are fished for\r\nwith three‐toothed harpoons, by the aid of which they are torn from their\r\nnative rock, but not without deteriorating them more or less. The finer\r\nkinds of sponges, on the other hand, are collected by divers; aided by a\r\nknife, they are carefully detached. Thus the price of a sponge brought up\r\nby diving is much more considerable than that of a harpooned sponge. Among\r\ndivers, those of Kalminos and of Psara are particularly renowned. They\r\nwill descend to the depth of twenty‐five fathoms, remain down a shorter\r\ntime than the Syrian divers, and yet bring up a more abundant harvest. The\r\nfishing of the Archipelago furnishes few fine sponges to commerce, but a\r\ngreat quantity of very common ones. The Syrian fisheries furnish many of\r\nthe finer kinds, which find a ready market in France; they are of medium\r\nsize. On the other hand, those which are furnished from the Barbary coast\r\nare of great dimensions, of a very fine tissue, and much sought for in\r\nEngland. Sponge fishing is carried on at various other stations in the\r\nMediterranean, but without any intelligent direction, and in consequence\r\nit is effected without any conservative foresight. At the same time,\r\nhowever, the trade in this product goes on yearly increasing; but it is\r\nonly a question of time when the trade shall cease, the demand which every\r\nyear clears the submarine fields of these sponges causing such destruction\r\nthat their reproduction will soon cease to be adequate.\r\n\r\nThe finer varieties of toilet sponge produce a high price, often as much\r\nas forty shillings the pound weight for very choice specimens, a price\r\nwhich few commercial products obtain, and which prohibits their use, in\r\nshort, to all but the wealthy. It is, therefore, very desirable that\r\nattempts should be made to carry out the submarine enterprise of M.\r\nLamiral. With the assistance of the Acclimatisation Society of Paris, some\r\nexperiments have already been made in this direction.\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: SPONGE, GROWING.]\r\n\r\nOn the Bahama banks and in the Gulf of Mexico the sponges grow in water of\r\nsmall depth. The fishermen—Spanish, American, and English—sink a long mast\r\nor perch into the water moored near the boat, down which they drop upon\r\nthe sponges; by this means they are easily gathered.\r\n\r\nThe fine, soft Syrian sponge is distinguished by its lightness, its fine\r\nflaxen colour, its form, which is that of a cup, its surface convex,\r\nvoluted, pierced by innumerable small orifices, the concave part of which\r\npresents canals of much greater diameter, which are prolonged to the\r\nexterior surface in such a manner that the summit is nearly always pierced\r\nthroughout in many places. This sponge is sometimes blanched by the aid of\r\ncaustic alkalies; but this preparation not only helps to destroy its\r\ntexture, but also changes its colour. This sponge is specially employed\r\nfor the toilet, and its price is high. Specimens which are round‐shaped,\r\nlarge, and soft, sometimes produce very large prices. There are many other\r\nvarieties known to the commercial world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n             DAVY JONES’S LOCKER, AND THOSE WHO DIVE INTO IT.\r\n\r\n\r\n       Scientific Diving—General Principles—William Phipps and the\r\n      Treasure Ship—Founder of the House of Mulgrave—Halley’s Wooden\r\n      Diving‐bell and Air Barrels—Smeaton’s Improvements—Spalding’s\r\n     Death—Operations at Plymouth Breakwater—The Diver’s Life—“Lower\r\n    away!”—The Diving‐_Belle_ and her Letter from Below—Operations at\r\n            the Bottom—Brunel and the Thames Tunnel—The Diving\r\n       Dress—Suffocation—Remarkable Case of Salvage—The “Submarine\r\n          Hydrostat”—John Gann of Whitstable—Dollar Row—Various\r\n    Anecdotes—Combat at the Bottom of the Sea—A Mermaid Story—Run down\r\n                       by the _Queen of Scotland_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe art of unassisted diving having been considered, the reader’s\r\nattention is invited to divers and diving aided by scientific appliances.\r\nBut for these developments, how could one hope to recover anything large\r\nor valuable that had once disappeared beneath the waves? How properly\r\nbuild gigantic breakwaters, piers, and bridges, or examine and clear\r\nchoked ports and channels?(29) Some of the grandest achievements of modern\r\npractical science would have been impossible without their aid.\r\n\r\nEvery reader understands the general principle involved in the\r\nconstruction of the diving‐bell. Invert a tumbler in a deep vessel of\r\nwater, and the liquid will only ascend to a certain height inside, however\r\nfar down you place the glass. Insert a tube in a hole drilled in your\r\ntumbler, and blow downwards, and the water recedes still lower. This is\r\nwhat happens when the air is pumped down into the modern diving‐bell. In\r\ndescending in a diving‐bell and remaining under water you will feel a\r\nslight inconvenience in breathing, and perhaps a tingling in the ears;\r\nthis comes, not from scarcity of air, but from the fact that the\r\natmosphere of the interior of the bell is really _denser_ than it is\r\noutside; the air, forced downwards by the powerful air‐pump, is pressed\r\n_upwards_ by the water. Readers may remember that Robert Fulton and his\r\nfriends remained under water in his submarine boat for over two hours, the\r\nair in that case being supplied from a large globe containing highly\r\ncondensed air, which was allowed to escape as required. The foul air\r\npassed off from tubes in bubbles to the surface.\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: A DIVER AT WORK (WITH SUBMARINE LAMP).]\r\n\r\nAs early as the year 1663 an Englishman named William Phipps, the son of a\r\nblacksmith, invented a plan for recovering from the bottom of the sea the\r\ntreasures out of a Spanish vessel which had sunk on the coast of\r\nHispaniola. Charles II. lent him a ship and all that was necessary for his\r\nenterprise, but the matter did not turn out successfully, and William\r\nPhipps fell into a state of the greatest poverty. Notwithstanding this\r\nnothing could discourage his ardour, and to set himself afloat again he\r\nopened a subscription list in England, of which the Duke of Albemarle was\r\none of the subscribers. In 1667 Phipps embarked in a ship of 200 tons\r\nburden, having undertaken beforehand to divide the profits between the\r\ntwenty shareholders who represented the associated capital. At first\r\nstarting his search proved altogether unavailing, and he was just\r\nbeginning to despair, when he fell in with the golden vein. The fortunate\r\ndiver returned to England with £200,000; £20,000 he kept for himself, and\r\nno less than £90,000 came to the share of the Duke of Albemarle. Phipps\r\nwas knighted by the king, and became the founder of the noble house of\r\nMulgrave, which has played no inconsiderable part in the affairs of the\r\nUnited Kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt is little more than a century and a half ago since the celebrated\r\nastronomer, Halley—about the first to commence those experiments in\r\nsubmarine exploration which have been continued to the present\r\nepoch—descended to a depth of fifty feet in a diving‐bell which he had\r\nconstructed. It was built of wood, and covered with sheet lead. The air\r\nthat was vitiated by respiration escaped from the chamber through an air‐\r\ncock, while the pure element was supplied by barrels, which descended and\r\nascended alternately on both sides of the bell, like buckets in a well.\r\nThese barrels, lined with metal, each contained some thirty‐six gallons of\r\ncondensed air; they were connected with the interior of the bell by\r\nleathern tubes. As soon as one of these air receptacles was exhausted\r\nanother was let down. Halley himself relates that in 1721, by the aid of\r\nthis apparatus, he was able to descend with four other persons to a depth\r\nof nine or ten fathoms, and to remain under water an hour and a half.\r\n\r\nIt is to Smeaton, the celebrated engineer of the famed Eddystone\r\nLighthouse, that the diving‐bell owes its leading characteristics, as he\r\nwas the first to abolish Halley’s rather clumsy contrivance and apply the\r\npower of the air‐pump; he also constructed the first cast‐iron bell. In\r\n1779 he made use of the diving‐bell to repair the piles of Hexham Bridge,\r\nin the north of England, the foundations of the structure having been\r\nundermined by the violence of the current. A few years after a sad\r\naccident occurred from the use of Halley’s barrel apparatus.\r\n\r\nIn 1783, Mr. Spalding, of Edinburgh, who had made some improvements upon\r\nthe mechanical arrangements of Halley’s bell, but had retained the barrel\r\nair service, engaged to recover some of the cargo of an East‐Indiaman\r\nwhich had been sunk on the Kish Bank, Ireland. He and his assistant went\r\ndown, and after the first supply of air was exhausted the barrels were\r\nsent down as usual. No signal having been given for some time, the bell\r\nwas drawn up, and Mr. Spalding and his assistant were found to be dead. It\r\nis supposed that by some means they failed to discharge the air from the\r\nbarrels into the bell, and were consequently suffocated. The barrel\r\nservice was always more or less dangerous, from its liability to get out\r\nof gear, and if Spalding had adopted the invention of Smeaton, he would\r\nnot have lost his life in the manner he did.\r\n\r\nThe improved diving‐bell was soon generally adopted by engineers, and\r\nplayed an important part in the works which have so altered the port of\r\nRamsgate. The great engineer Rennie made constant use of the diving‐bell\r\nin fixing the foundations of the eastern jetty, and in protecting it in\r\nparts against the attacks of the sea by a shield of solid masonry. It was\r\nextensively used in the construction of the Plymouth Breakwater. M.\r\nEsquiros, who visited the divers during the progress of that great work,\r\ngave an interesting account of their _modus operandi_:—\r\n\r\n“But we now,” says he, “approached the breakwater—that causeway of\r\ngiants—by the side of which we soon discovered an old dismasted ship. This\r\nvessel is rough in appearance, and covered over with a kind of pent‐house\r\nroof. In it live, as in a floating house, the operatives who are still\r\nworking at the breakwater. They pass, alternately, one month on board ship\r\nand one month on shore. One of their little sources of profit consists in\r\nthe sale of small fancy articles, which they say that they cut out with\r\nthe blades of their pocket‐knives from the rocks which they bring up from\r\nthe bottom of the sea. Very soon I heard the loud throbbing of machinery,\r\nsnorting and puffing like so many marine monsters; it was the wheezy noise\r\nof the air‐pumps which supply the bells when buried under water....\r\n\r\n“I then noticed a small boat managed by a sailor rowing it, which glided\r\nunder the mouth of the bell, and from this hollow I saw emerge a pair of\r\nlarge loose boots, reaching above the knees, which, being followed by\r\nanother pair of large boots, convinced me that two men were jumping down\r\ninto the skiff. The boat itself, in fact, at once got clear of the dome,\r\nunder which it had been half hidden, and I saw it come back to the vessel\r\nwith two workmen on board, wet up to the waist and covered with mud. They\r\nhad just finished making their half‐day under the water, and appeared to\r\nbe fatigued. Their swarthy complexions were tinged on the cheeks and\r\nforehead with a bright sanguine hue. The position of the bell was not at\r\nall altered; it was as if they wished to give it an opportunity to dry\r\nitself and breathe a little fresh air. It was then dinner hour for the men\r\nemployed at the works. I had just been a spectator of the process of\r\nraising the bell to the surface; I now had to see it let down again to the\r\nbottom of the sea.\r\n\r\n“The same little boat which brought the two workmen to the great floating\r\nhouse took them back again, after an hour’s rest, to the vicinity of the\r\ndiving‐bell, which, hung just over the water, looked very much like an\r\nimmense iron box open at the bottom. The procedure in making ready for the\r\ndescent has really something rather imposing about it, and to an excited\r\nimagination might very well suggest the preparations for the execution of\r\na sentence of death. Nothing is wanting for the purpose; the scaffold, the\r\nsecret cell, and the gulf of the menacing waves are all there. The divers,\r\nthank goodness! do not in the least anticipate such a fate, but, on the\r\ncontrary, seem proud to walk safely over the bottom of the sea, where so\r\nmany others have found their grave. Be this as it may, the boat soon\r\nplaces itself underneath the bell, raised as it is three or four feet\r\nabove the surface. The two workmen climb one after the other up into the\r\ninside, helped by an iron ring hung to the arched roof, which can easily\r\nbe laid hold of by the hands. They take their places on two wooden benches\r\nfixed at a certain height in the hollow of the bell. Sometimes four, or\r\neven six, workmen have to find seats in this curious vehicle. When all\r\nthis is done the boat goes away, and in another moment the voice of the\r\nforeman gives the order, ‘Lower away.’...\r\n\r\n“In places where the water is troubled by sand, the diver often passes\r\nthrough a kind of twilight or submarine fog, which compels him to light\r\nhis lamp. More often, on the contrary, the light is sufficiently strong to\r\nenable him to read a newspaper in small type. A story is told even of a\r\nlady who wrote a letter in the diving‐bell, and dated it thus: ‘16th June,\r\n18—, at the bottom of the sea.’ Her courage obtained for her among the\r\ndivers the _sobriquet_ of the Diving _Belle_.\r\n\r\n“I also wished to make my mind easy as to the lot of the poor workmen whom\r\nI had seen descending in the bell. The foreman assured me that they\r\nenjoyed every comfort in it. Have they not seats to rest themselves on, a\r\nwooden ledge on which to place their feet, an assortment of tools and\r\nnecessary utensils suspended on a cord or hooked on to the walls of their\r\nhut, which is nearly as well furnished as that of Robinson Crusoe’s? From\r\nall this explanation I was bound to conclude, unless the foreman was\r\nmixing up a little irony in what he told me, that the divers were quite\r\n‘at home’ in the bell. The fact is, that really they pass in it a great\r\npart of their existence. Almost all of them suffer a great deal at first\r\nfrom a violent pain, which they themselves define as ‘a toothache gone\r\ninto the ears,’ and they have a humming in the head, ‘as if some one had\r\nlet fly a swarm of bees there;’ but these troublesome symptoms disappear\r\nafter the second or third descent. Their confidence in this dry chamber,\r\nalmost isolated in the midst of the turmoil of the ocean, approaches\r\nsometimes to temerity. In 1820, Dr. Collodon, of Geneva, who had gone down\r\nin a diving‐bell on the coast of Ireland, bethought himself that at the\r\ndepth at which he then was, a stone, or any other trifling cause\r\nobstructing the action of the air‐valve, would be sufficient to enable the\r\nwater to invade the bell. He confided this not very reassuring reflection\r\nto one of the divers who was with him. The latter, smiling, answered him\r\nby merely pointing out with his finger one of the glazed loopholes which\r\nwere over their heads. The doctor examined it attentively, and\r\nascertained, in fact, that the glass was cracked sufficiently to allow\r\nbubbles of air to escape pretty freely. This was a very different and more\r\nserious cause of uneasiness than the rather improbable contingency of an\r\nobstruction of the air‐valve. The diver was well aware of the cracked\r\nglass, and cared nothing about it.”\r\n\r\nSome time since, when the present writer descended in the diving‐bell\r\nexhibited in London, a seal which then disported in the tank would rub its\r\nnose outside against the little glass windows, and look in, as though\r\nwondering what on earth a visitor was doing there in _his_ element! The\r\nsame poor animal afterwards came to grief in a very sad way. When the\r\nwater was drained off out of the tank the seal got into the pipes below,\r\nand thence to the sewers. It was found, still alive, some time after, in\r\nthe sewers of the Euston Road, a considerable distance away, but succumbed\r\nlater to the mephitic influences of the filthy stream.\r\n\r\nM. Esquiros continues:—“‘They are just beginning to work’ was soon\r\nremarked to me by the superintendent, who followed, even under the waves,\r\nevery movement of his labourers. The nature of their operations varies, of\r\ncourse, very much according to the undertaking in which they are engaged.\r\nThe two divers who had just gone down had for their task to clear away\r\nround the adjacent portion of the foundation of the breakwater. As soon as\r\nthey reach the bottom they jump off their seat, and, armed with a pickaxe,\r\nbegin to dig into the moist sand in order to get out the stones. It often\r\nhappens that the movement of the tide or some other cause disturbs the\r\nwater round the rocky base of the breakwater. The workmen have then much\r\ntrouble in seeing clearly, and complain that ‘the water is muddy.’\r\nGenerally, however, the water is so transparent, that even a cloud passing\r\nacross the sky is visible at the bottom of the sea. The workmen also can\r\nlabour with nearly as much ease and quite as much energy as if they were\r\non land. The movements they themselves make in conjunction with the\r\ncircumstances which surround them occasionally cause something like a\r\nthick mist to rise before their eyes, hiding from them the nearest\r\nobjects; they get quit of it by calling for an ‘air bath.’ The air‐pump\r\nredoubles its pace in working, and sends down to them through the pump an\r\nextra current of air, which soon blows away the mist.\r\n\r\n“I was very soon enabled to judge for myself as to their industry; sacks\r\nwhich they had filled with muddy sand, and buckets laden with stones, came\r\nup to the surface every moment, drawn by cords. One might have fancied it\r\nto be the mouth of a mine, to which invisible arms were constantly sending\r\nup fragments of rock; but here the mine was the sea. The nature of their\r\ndigging did not allow them to work very long together in the same place.\r\nThe divers had already requested by signal to have their position shifted\r\non the bed of the sound. How would they manage to comply with their wish?\r\nAs regards air and locomotion, the men shut up in the bell depend entirely\r\non the apparatus working on the surface. The chief organ of movement is a\r\nsort of _traveller_ on four wheels, running over two tramways, allowing it\r\nto come and go in every direction. Immediately on the signal being given\r\nfrom below, the bell was raised from the bottom of the sea, like a heavy\r\nballoon. This operation was, of course, carried out by means of chains,\r\nand the diving‐bell remained for a minute or two motionless in mid‐water,\r\nlike the pendulum of a stopped clock. But the traveller begins to move,\r\nand as it also acts as a crane, the pulley on the surface and the bell\r\nunder water shift their position at the same time. The divers call this\r\n‘travelling.’ They can thus move from north to south, from east to west,\r\nbackwards and forwards. As they are in motion, if they come upon a piece\r\nof rock which encumbers the bed of the sound, they give the signal to\r\nstop, and the bell becomes stationary, and then descends again slowly\r\ntowards the block of stones. If they have been carried on a little too\r\nfar, and want to retrace their steps, they communicate afresh with the men\r\nworking on the surface, and the obliging machinery soon brings them to the\r\nexact point desired.”\r\n\r\nThe diving‐bell has many times rendered service to engineers, by enabling\r\nthem to descend and ascertain the nature of damages going on, which might\r\notherwise have ruined their work. When Brunel was building the famous\r\nThames Tunnel, and the current had broken through its arched roof, he went\r\ndown in a diving‐bell to see for himself the extent of the disaster. After\r\na descent of nearly thirty feet, he reached a serious opening in the\r\nmasonry, but the hole was too narrow to allow the bell to enter. It was\r\ntherefore necessary for some one to dive into it, and brave Brunel\r\nimmediately declared his intention of doing it. Taking hold of the end of\r\na rope, he plunged into the hole, where it is said he remained nearly two\r\nminutes, mentally noting the damage done. So intent was he on this\r\nexamination that he let go the rope just as his companions above, alarmed\r\nat his long stay below, were hauling it up. He had just time to catch hold\r\nof it again, and was happily drawn safely into the bell.\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: DIVERS ATTACKED BY A SWORD‐FISH.]\r\n\r\nThe diving dress was a later development, and owed much of its present\r\npractical shape to French men of science. The object of the dress, which\r\nis of canvas or india‐rubber and metal, is, of course, to give each\r\nindividual wearing it the utmost liberty of motion, while having at the\r\nsame time a proper supply of vital air. The condensed air‐reservoir is\r\nmade of steel, and capable of resisting great pressures. The diver carries\r\nthis apparatus on his back; from it a respiratory tube issues, and is\r\nterminated by an india‐rubber mouth‐piece, which is held between the lips\r\nand teeth of the diver.\r\n\r\nThe diver’s is a rough life, most assuredly. During the diving business on\r\nthe _Royal George_, Private John Williams, early in the season, tore his\r\nhands very severely in attempting to sling a mass of the wreck with jagged\r\nsurfaces and broken bolts. After a few days’ rest he reappeared in his\r\nsubmarine habit, and dived as before, but from excessive pain in the ears\r\nwas again _hors de combat_ till the 11th of July, when, on re‐descending,\r\nhe was grievously injured by the bursting of his air‐pipe a few inches\r\nabove the water. This casualty was indicated by a loud hissing noise on\r\ndeck. A few seconds elapsed before the rupture could be traced and the\r\nopening temporarily stopped. With great alertness he was drawn up, and on\r\nbeing relieved of his helmet, presented a frightful appearance. His face\r\nand neck were much swelled and very livid, blood was flowing profusely\r\nfrom his mouth and ears, and his eyes were closed and protruding. Though\r\npartially suffocated, he possessed sufficient sensibility to speak of the\r\nmishap. A sudden shock, it seems, struck him motionless, and then followed\r\na tremendous pressure, as if he were being crushed to death. A month in\r\nthe Haslar Hospital restored him to health, and on returning to the wreck\r\nhe at once recommenced his laborious occupation.\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: DIVERS AT WORK.]\r\n\r\nThe following is a remarkable example of a salvage effected by the help of\r\ndivers. “The packet boats _Ganges_ and _l’Impératrice_ came into collision\r\nin the outer port of Marseilles. The _Impératrice_ had one of her wheels\r\nbroken and the officers’ quarters damaged. One of the cabins contained a\r\nchest full of gold, which fell into the thick mud which forms the bottom\r\nof the port of Marseilles. It was important that this precious package\r\nshould be recovered the next day. The sea was rough, and the exact spot\r\nwhere the accident occurred unknown. The box was not strong; its colour\r\nwas black. At the supposed spot a plumb of sixty kilogrammes was sunk.\r\nThis plumb carried two cords divided into metres; two divers dragged them\r\nin separate directions, and taking each the knot corresponding to one\r\nmetre, they described consecutive circles, examining the ground at each\r\nstep. After searching three hours, the gold was found, and restored to its\r\nowner, who had watched the operations with intense anxiety. This salvage\r\nwas effected on February 19th, 1867, by M. Barbotin, contractor for\r\nsubmarine work at Marseilles.”\r\n\r\nThe diving‐bell proper has been much improved by another Frenchman, M.\r\nPayerne. His “Submarine Hydrostat” will descend or fall at the will of\r\nthose inside. Thirty men may work in it with ease for a number of hours\r\nwithout inconvenience. It is, therefore, of great service in clearing\r\nports, and in facilitating the execution of other submarine work. “The\r\nprinciple of the machine is very ingenious. Externally, it has the\r\nappearance of one large rectangular box, surmounted by another smaller\r\none, completely closed in except at the bottom. The interior consists of\r\nthree principal compartments. The _hold_ communicates by a large shaft\r\nwith the upper compartment. Between these is a third compartment, or\r\n_orlop deck_, which only communicates with the others by means of stop‐\r\ncocks. The hydrostat is twenty feet in height, and its base, which has the\r\nbottom of the sea for a floor, covers an area of 625 square feet. It may\r\nbe made to rise and fall at will, and it will readily float about like a\r\nraft.” This ingenious machine has proved of much service. The port of\r\nFécamp was choked up with shingle, which closed it against all vessels\r\nbeyond a certain tonnage. The hydrostat was employed, and the port\r\ncleaned, and again opened to commerce.\r\n\r\nThe old divers are fond of recounting the glories of their craft, and are\r\nspecially impressed with any information as to the fate of the vessels of\r\nthe Armada. This spirit has been fostered no less by the successes of the\r\nancestor of the Mulgraves than by the good fortune of John Gann, of\r\nWhitstable. The old diver was, many years since, employed on the Galway\r\ncoast, and used to pass his evenings in a public‐house frequented by\r\nfishermen. One of these men, repeating a tradition which had long existed\r\nin the district, told Gann that one of the Spanish vessels had been\r\nwrecked not far from that coast, and intimated that he himself could point\r\nout the spot. Gann, having finished his special job, made terms with the\r\nfisherman, and they were both out for many weeks dragging the spot\r\nindicated for any traces of the wreck. They were at last rewarded by\r\ncoming upon obstructions with their grapnels. Gann brought out his diving\r\napparatus, and sure enough the truth of the tradition was vindicated by\r\nthe finding of a number of dollars, which had originally been packed in\r\nbarrels. The barrels, however, had rotted away, and left the gold stacked\r\nin barrel shape. With the money so recovered John Gann built at\r\nWhitstable, his native place, a row of houses, which, to commemorate the\r\ncircumstance, he called Dollar Row.\r\n\r\nCorporal Harris, almost entirely by his own diligence, removed in little\r\nmore than two months the wreck of the _Perdita_, mooring lighter, which\r\nwas sunk in 1783, in the course of Mr. Tracy’s unsuccessful efforts to\r\nweigh the _Royal George_. It was about sixty feet in length, and embedded\r\nin mud fifty fathoms south of that vessel. The exposed timbers stood only\r\ntwo feet six inches above the level of the bottom, so that the exertions\r\nof Harris in removing the wreck were Herculean. Completely overpowered by\r\nfatigue, he claimed a respite for a day or two to recruit his energies,\r\nand then resumed work with his accustomed assiduity and cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nThere was a sort of abnegation, an absence of jealousy, in the character\r\nof Harris which, as the rivalry among the divers made them somewhat\r\nselfish, gave prominence to his kindness. He met a comrade named Cameron\r\nat the bottom, who led him to the spot where he was working. For a\r\nconsiderable time Cameron had fruitlessly laboured in slinging an awkward\r\ntimber of some magnitude, when Harris readily stood in his place, and in a\r\nfew minutes, using Cameron’s breast‐line to make the necessary signals,\r\nsent the mass on deck. It was thus recorded to Cameron’s credit; but the\r\ncircumstance, on becoming known, was regarded with so much satisfaction\r\nthat honourable mention was made of it in the official records.\r\n\r\nLance‐Corporal Jones, engaged on the wreck of the _Royal George_, one day\r\nlodged on deck from his slings a crate containing eighty 12‐pounder shot.\r\nWith singular success he laid the remainder of the kelson open for\r\nrecovery, and then, sinking deeper, drew from the mud, in two hauls,\r\nnearly thirty‐five feet of the keel. He also weighed a small vessel of six\r\ntons burden, belonging to a Mr. Cussell, which drove, under a strong\r\ncurrent, upon one of the lighters. Becoming entangled, the craft soon\r\nfilled and foundered, grappling, in her descent, with the ladder of one of\r\nthe divers, grounding at a short distance from the interval between the\r\nlighters. Jones was selected to try his skill in rescuing her. At once\r\ndescending, he fixed the chains under her stern, and while attempting to\r\nhold them in position, by passing them round the mast, the tide turned,\r\nthe vessel swung round, and the mast fell over the side, burying Jones\r\nunder her sails and rigging. Perilous as was his situation, his\r\nfearlessness and presence of mind never for a moment forsook him. Working\r\nfrom under the canvas, and carefully extricating himself from the crowd of\r\nropes that ensnared him, he at last found himself free. A thunderstorm now\r\nset in, and, obedient to a call from above, he repaired to the deck; but\r\nas soon as the squall had subsided he again disappeared, and cleverly\r\njamming the slings, the boat was hove up; but she had become a complete\r\nwreck, and was taken on shore.\r\n\r\nA dangerous but curious incident occurred on the _Royal George_ diving\r\noperations between Corporal Jones and Private Girvan, two rival divers,\r\nwho, in a moment of irritation, engaged in a conflict at the bottom of the\r\nsea, having both got hold of the same floor timber of the wreck, which\r\nneither would yield to the other. Jones, at length, fearful of a collision\r\nwith Girvan, who was a powerful man, got his bull‐rope fast, and attempted\r\nto escape by it, but before he could do so Girvan seized him by the legs\r\nand tried to draw him down. A scuffle ensued, and Jones succeeded in\r\nextricating himself from the grasp of his antagonist. He then took a\r\nfirmer hold of the bull‐rope and gave a kick at Girvan, which broke one of\r\nthe lens of Girvan’s helmet, and as water instantly rushed into his dress,\r\nhe was likely to have been drowned, had he not at once been hauled on\r\nboard. Two or three days, however, at Haslar Hospital restored him; and\r\nthe two submarine combatants resumed work together with the greatest\r\ncordiality.\r\n\r\nA diver’s “Nursery Tale” must not be omitted. The hero, “Jack” (this is\r\nthe name of a diver who “lived once upon a time”), had been busy for some\r\nweeks in gathering up the relics of a shipwreck, when on a certain day he\r\nsaw appear at one of the windows of his bell the pale face of a woman,\r\nwith long hair intertwined with sea‐weed. He had often heard tell of the\r\nbeauty of mermaids, who are, as every one knows, lovelier than the most\r\nlovely of women; but Jack never believed that any creature so perfect as\r\nthis could have existed. With a voice softer than the murmuring of the\r\nwaves under a gentle breeze, she said to him, “I am one of the spirits of\r\nthe sea. On account of your kind disposition I have marked you out among\r\nthe rest of your companions, and I will protect you, but on one condition\r\nonly, and that is, that you shall be sure to recognise me under any shape\r\ninto which I may be pleased to change myself.” The beautiful spirit\r\ndisappeared, and Jack remained very much surprised, but with a strong\r\nfeeling of joy thrilling within him. He prospered exceedingly in all that\r\nhe undertook. But at last prosperity spoiled him. He kicked and ill‐\r\ntreated a polyp, a kind of devil‐fish, but still an animal, and one that\r\nhad done him no harm, not knowing that the beautiful spirit was disguised\r\nunder that mass of ugliness. A few days afterwards an accident occurred\r\nand Jack was drowned. Moral: Take the advice of kindly mermaids—when you\r\nmeet them.\r\n\r\nAnd now for our last yarn, a true one. Some years ago a large vessel,\r\nhaving on board a valuable cargo, including gold bars, was run down and\r\nsunk by a steamship in the Thames between Northfleet and Gravesend. She\r\nwas afterwards successfully raised by Captain George Wilson, of Milton,\r\nthe famous oyster place, near Sittingbourne, in Kent, and which is also\r\nfamous for its divers. It is principally, however, to the names of the\r\nvessels concerned that attention is directed. The _United Kingdom_ was run\r\ndown by the _Queen of Scotland_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE OCEAN AND SOME OF ITS PHENOMENA.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The Saltness of the Sea—Its Composition—Tons of Silver in the\r\n        Ocean—Currents and their Causes—The Great Gulf Stream—Its\r\n     Characteristics—A Triumph of Science—The Tides—The Highest Known\r\n           Tides and Waves—Whirlpools—The Maelström—A Norwegian\r\n        Description—Edgar Allan Poe and his Story—Rescued from the\r\n    Vortex—The “Souffleur” at the Mauritius—The Colour of the Sea—Its\r\n            Causes—The Phosphorescence of the Ocean—Fields of\r\n                Silver—Principally Caused by Animal Life.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany features and phenomena of the ocean have been incidentally noted in\r\nthe foregoing pages; but there are points, hitherto untouched, which\r\ndeserve our attention.\r\n\r\nIts saltness is due, not merely to the presence of chloride of sodium, or\r\nwhat we call common salt, but to a large number of other minerals,\r\nincluding the chlorides of magnesium and potassium, the sulphates of\r\nmagnesia and lime, carbonate of lime, sulphuretted hydrogen, bromide of\r\nmagnesia, hydrochlorate of ammonia, iodine, iron, copper, and even silver,\r\nvarying in proportion according to locality. The copper plates of a ship\r\nexamined at Valparaiso showed unmistakable traces of silver deposits.\r\nCalculations have been made showing that the ocean contains 2,000,000 tons\r\nof silver. In 1,000 grains of sea‐water there are thirty‐eight grains of\r\nthese ingredients and some little organic matter. The saltness of the sea\r\nis generally greater towards the poles, but to this statement there are\r\nexceptions. In parts of the Irish Channel the water contains salts equal\r\nto the fortieth of its weight, the saline matter rising to one‐sixteenth\r\nof its weight off the coast of Spain. In many places the ocean is less\r\nsalt at the surface than at the bottom. Its saltness increases its density\r\nand its buoyancy.\r\n\r\nMaury, a recognised authority, finds in the saline properties of the sea\r\none of the principal forces from which the currents in the ocean proceed.\r\n“The brine of the ocean,” says he, “is the ley of the earth; from it the\r\nsea derives dynamical powers, and the currents their main strength.” Let\r\nus suppose a long tank or, say, swimming‐bath, divided in the middle by a\r\nwater‐tight wall, on one side of which should be fresh and on the other\r\nsalt water, at equal levels. It is obvious that were the division removed\r\nthe waters would not stand side by side as before, for the denser water\r\nwould have a tendency not merely to mingle with the lighter, but to form a\r\ncurrent _under_ it. So salt waters of different densities.\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: CHART OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN.]\r\n\r\n“The ocean,” says Figuier, “is a scene of unceasing agitation; ‘its vast\r\nsurface rises and falls,’ to use the image suggested by Schleiden, ‘as if\r\nit were gifted with a gentle power of respiration; its movements, gentle\r\nor powerful, slow or rapid, are all determined by differences of\r\ntemperature.’” Heat increases its volume, and therefore lightens it; cold\r\nincreases its density, and it will naturally descend. These are, then,\r\namong the obvious reasons of its currents. The duration and force of winds\r\nand the tides are both disturbing influences. Such an oceanic marvel as\r\nthe great _Gulf Stream_ could only be explained after a careful study of\r\nall the operating causes of its existence. Dr. Maury has well described\r\nit. He says:—“There is a river in the bosom of the ocean: in the severest\r\ndroughts it never fails, and in the mightiest floods it never overflows;\r\nits banks and its bottom are of cold water, while its current is of warm;\r\nit takes its rise in the Gulf of Mexico, and empties itself into the\r\nArctic seas; this mighty river is the Gulf Stream. In no other part of the\r\nworld is there such a majestic flow of water; its current is more rapid\r\nthan the Amazon, more impetuous than the Mississippi, and its volume is\r\nmore than a thousand times greater.” This great current of water\r\nparticularly influences the climates of Northern Europe, and especially\r\nthose of Britain and Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf Stream, as it issues from the Florida Channel, has a breadth of\r\nthirty‐four miles, a depth of 2,200 feet, and moves at the rate of four\r\nand a half miles an hour. “Midway in the Atlantic, in the triangular space\r\nbetween the Azores, Canaries, and Cape de Verd Islands, is the great\r\nSargassum Sea, covering an area equal to the Mississippi Valley; it is so\r\nthickly matted over with the Gulf weed (_Sargassum bacciferum_) that the\r\nspeed of vessels passing through it is actually retarded, and to the\r\ncompanions of Columbus it seemed to mark the limits of navigation: they\r\nbecame alarmed. To the eye, at a little distance, it seemed sufficiently\r\nsubstantial to walk upon.” The difference of temperature between the Gulf\r\nStream and the waters it traverses constantly gives birth to tempests and\r\ncyclones. In 1780 a terrible storm ravaged the Antilles, in which 20,000\r\npersons perished. The ocean quitted its bed, and inundated whole cities;\r\nthe trunks of great trees and large parts of buildings were tossed wildly\r\nin the air. Numerous catastrophes of this kind have earned the Gulf Stream\r\nthe title of the “King of the Tempests.” So well had Maury studied the\r\nGulf Stream and its storms, that he was enabled to point out the exact\r\nposition of a vessel overtaken by a terrible gale. “In the month of\r\nDecember, 1859,” says Figuier, “the American packet _San Francisco_ was\r\nemployed as a transport to convey a regiment to California. It was\r\novertaken by one of these sudden storms, which placed the ship and its\r\nfreight in a most dangerous position—a single wave, which swept the deck,\r\ntore out the masts, stopped the engines, and washed overboard 129 persons,\r\nofficers, and soldiers. From that moment the unfortunate steamer floated\r\nupon the waters, a waif abandoned to the fury of the wind. The day after\r\nthe disaster the _San Francisco_ was seen in this desperate situation by a\r\nship, which reached New York, although unable to assist her. Another ship\r\nmet her some days after, but, like the other, could render no assistance.\r\nWhen the report reached New York two steamers were despatched to her\r\nassistance; but in what direction were they to go? what part of the ocean\r\nwere they to explore? The authorities at the Washington Observatory were\r\nappealed to. Having consulted his charts as to the direction and limits of\r\nthe Gulf Stream at that period of the year, Dr. Maury traced on a chart\r\nthe spot to which the disabled steamer was likely to be driven by the\r\ncurrent, and the course to be taken by the vessels sent to her\r\nassistance.” The steamers went straight to the exact spot, and found the\r\nwreck; and although by that time the crew and passengers had been taken\r\noff by three passing vessels, it was certainly a triumph of science.\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: WAVES OFF THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.]\r\n\r\nThe tides are produced by two pairs of great waves which travel round the\r\nearth each day—a greater pair caused by the attraction of the moon, a\r\nlesser pair caused by the sun. The moon, by reason of its nearness to the\r\nearth, produces by far the greater influence, but the tides are also\r\nsubject to all kinds of local influences. The eastern coast of Asia and\r\nwestern side of Europe are exposed to extremely high tides; while in the\r\nSouth Sea Islands they scarcely reach the height of twenty inches. There\r\nis hardly any tide in the Mediterranean, separated as it is from the ocean\r\nby a narrow strait. “The highest tide which is known occurs in the Bay of\r\nFundy, which opens up to the south of the isthmus uniting Nova Scotia and\r\nNew Brunswick. There the tide reaches forty, fifty, and even sixty feet,\r\nwhile it only attains the height of seven or eight in the bay to the north\r\nof the same isthmus. It is related that a ship was cast ashore upon a rock\r\nduring the night so high, that at daybreak the crew found themselves and\r\ntheir ship suspended in mid‐air, far above the water.” The winds have an\r\nimmense influence on the height of tides, and also on the waves. The\r\nhighest known waves are found off the Cape of Good Hope (p. 89) at the\r\nperiod of high tide, under the influence of a strong north‐west wind which\r\nhas traversed the Atlantic, pressing its waters round the Cape. “The\r\nbillows there,” says Maury, “lift themselves up in long ridges, with deep\r\nhollows between them. They run high and fast, tossing their white caps\r\naloft in the air, looking like the green hills of a rolling prairie capped\r\nwith snow, and chasing each other in sport. Still, their march is stately\r\nand their roll majestic. Many an Australian‐bound trader, after doubling\r\nthe Cape, finds herself followed for weeks at a time by these magnificent\r\nrolling swells, furiously driven and lashed by the ‘brave west winds.’\r\nThese billows are said to attain the height of thirty, and even forty\r\nfeet; but no very exact measurement of the height of waves is recorded.”\r\nThose off Cape Horn are rather less in height. _Spray_ is dashed over the\r\nEddystone Light, 130 feet high. After a great storm in Barbadoes in 1780,\r\nsome old and heavy cannons were found on the shore, which had been thrown\r\nup from the bottom of the sea. If waves in their reflux meet with\r\nobstacles, whirlpools result, such as those in the Straits of Messina,\r\nbetween the rocks of Charybdis and Scylla made famous by Homer, Ovid, and\r\nVirgil, and once much dreaded, but now little feared.\r\n\r\nThe best known whirlpool, the Maelström, off Lofoden, in Norway, is the\r\nresult of opposing currents. One of the most circumstantial accounts of it\r\nis that of a Norwegian, Jonas Ramus, who calls it the Moskoe‐strom\r\n(channel or stream):—“Between Lofoden and Moskoe,” says he, “the depth of\r\nthe water is between thirty‐six and forty fathoms; but, on the other side,\r\ntowards Ver (Vurrgh), this depth decreases so as not to afford a\r\nconvenient passage for a vessel without the risk of splitting on the\r\nrocks, which happens even in the calmest weather. When it is flood the\r\nstream runs up the country between Lofoden and Moskoe with a boisterous\r\nrapidity; but the roar of its impetuous ebb to the sea is scarcely\r\nequalled by the loudest and most dreadful cataracts, the noise being heard\r\nseveral leagues off; and the vortices or pits are of such an extent and\r\ndepth that if a ship comes within its attraction it is inevitably absorbed\r\nand carried down to the bottom, and there beaten to pieces against the\r\nrocks; and when the water relaxes the fragments thereof are thrown up\r\nagain. But these intervals of tranquillity are only at the turn of the ebb\r\nand flood and in calm weather, and last but a quarter of an hour, its\r\nviolence gradually returning. When the stream is most boisterous, and its\r\nfury heightened by a storm, it is dangerous to come within a Norwegian\r\nmile of it. Boats, yachts, and ships have been carried away by not\r\nguarding against it before they were within its reach. It likewise happens\r\nfrequently that whales come too near the stream, and are overpowered by\r\nits violence, and then it is impossible to describe their howlings and\r\nbellowings, in their fruitless struggles to disengage themselves. A bear\r\nonce attempting to swim from Lofoden to Moskoe, was caught by the stream\r\nand borne down, while he roared terribly, so as to be heard on shore.\r\nLarge stocks of firs and pine‐trees, after being absorbed by the current,\r\nrise again, broken and torn to such a degree as if bristles grew upon\r\nthem. This plainly shows the bottom to consist of craggy rocks, among\r\nwhich they are whirled to and fro. This stream is regulated by the flux\r\nand reflux of the sea, it being constantly high and low water every six\r\nhours. In the year 1645, early in the morning of Sexagesima Sunday, it\r\nraged with such noise and impetuosity that the very stones of the houses\r\non the coast fell to the ground.” Kuchu and others promulgated the idea\r\nthat the maelström is a watery abyss penetrating the globe, and issuing in\r\nsome very remote part. This is the view held by most of the Norwegian\r\npeasantry and fishermen to‐day.\r\n\r\nWho that has read the works of Edgar Allan Poe will ever forget his\r\nthrilling and detailed story of a descent into the maelström?(30) It bears\r\nthe impress of close study, and is founded largely on recorded facts. Two\r\nbrothers, the most daring fishermen of their coast, were accustomed to\r\nfish in closer proximity to the maelström than all the rest, because,\r\nalthough a desperate speculation, they would get more fish in a day than\r\nthe others could at the distant fishing grounds in a week. The risk of\r\nlife stood for labour, and courage for capital.\r\n\r\nIn a terrible hurricane they were driven through the surf into the inner\r\ncircle of the whirlpool, where (as is likely to be the case in actual\r\nfact) the wind nearly ceased, the surface of the water being lower than\r\nthat of the surrounding ocean. “If you have never been at sea in a heavy\r\ngale, you can form no idea of the confusion of mind occasioned by the wind\r\nand spray together. They blind, deafen, and strangle you, and take away\r\nall power of action or reflection.” Now the two fishermen brothers were in\r\na measure respited, as death‐condemned felons in prison are allowed petty\r\nindulgences forbidden them while their doom is yet uncertain. Round and\r\nround the belt the vessel flew rather than floated, getting nearer and\r\nnearer to the fatal inner vortex, and making wild lurches towards the\r\nabyss. “The boat appeared to be hanging, as if by magic, midway down, upon\r\nthe interior surface of a funnel vast in circumference, prodigious in\r\ndepth, and whose perfectly smooth sides might have been mistaken for\r\nebony, but for the bewildering rapidity with which they spun round, and\r\nfor the gleaming and ghastly radiance they shot forth as the rays of the\r\nfull moon ... streamed in a flood of golden glory along the black walls,\r\nand far away down into the inmost recesses of the abyss.” Round and round\r\nthey swept in dizzying swings and jerks. Above and below them were\r\nwhirling fragments of vessels, timbers, boxes, barrels, and trunks of\r\ntrees. And now a hope arose from the recollection of one circumstance:\r\nthat of the great variety of buoyant matter thrown up by the moskoe‐strom\r\non the coast of Lofoden, some articles were not disfigured or damaged at\r\nall. Further, light and cylindrical articles were the least likely to be\r\nabsorbed into any watery vortex: for the last statement there are good\r\nscientific reasons. “I,” says the survivor, “no longer hesitated what to\r\ndo. I resolved to lash myself securely to the water‐cask upon which I now\r\nheld, to cut it loose from the counter, and to throw myself with it into\r\nthe water. I attracted my brother’s attention by signs, pointed to the\r\nfloating barrels that came near us, and did everything in my power to make\r\nhim understand what I was about to do. I thought at length that he\r\ncomprehended my design, but whether this was the case or not, he shook his\r\nhead despairingly, and refused to move from his station by the ring‐bolt.\r\nIt was impossible to reach him; the emergency admitted of no delay; and\r\nso, with a bitter struggle, I resigned him to his fate, fastened myself to\r\nthe cask by means of the lashings which secured it to the counter, and\r\nprecipitated myself with it into the sea without another moment’s\r\nhesitation.” The smack soon after made a few gyrations in rapid\r\nsuccession, then sank to the bottom for ever, bearing with it the\r\nunfortunate brother. “The barrel to which I was attached had sunk very\r\nlittle farther than half the distance between the bottom of the gulf and\r\nthe spot at which I leaped overboard before a great change took place in\r\nthe character of the whirlpool. The slope of the sides of the vast funnel\r\nbecame momentarily less and less steep. The gyrations of the whirl grew\r\ngradually less and less violent.” By degrees the waters rose, and he found\r\nhimself in full view of the shores of Lofoden, and above the spot where\r\nthe pool of the moskoe‐strom _had been_. He was picked up by a boat; those\r\non board were old mates and daily companions, but they knew him no more\r\nthan they would have known a traveller from the spirit‐land. His hair,\r\nwhich had been raven black the day before, was now as white as snow.\r\n\r\nThus far Poe. It shows how the vivid imagination of a great poet, dealing\r\nwith facts, can put those facts before the reader in artistically life‐\r\nlike and graphic form.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: WHIRLPOOL OF CORRIEVRECKAN, OFF THE HEBRIDES.]\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable whirlpool is that of Corrievreckan, off the Hebrides,\r\nin the south of Scotland, shown in an illustration on page 93.\r\n\r\nA phenomenon of another character is exhibited on the south side of the\r\nMauritius, at a point called “The Souffleur,” or “The Blower.” “A large\r\nmass of rock,” says Lieutenant Taylor, of the United States navy, “runs\r\nout into the sea from the mainland, to which it is joined by a neck of\r\nrock not two feet broad. The constant beating of the tremendous swell\r\nwhich rolls in has undermined it in every direction, till it has exactly\r\nthe appearance of a Gothic building with a number of arches. In the centre\r\nof the rock, which is about thirty‐five or forty feet above the sea, the\r\nwater has forced two passages vertically upward, which are worn as smooth\r\nand cylindrical as if cut by a chisel. When a heavy sea rolls in, it of\r\ncourse fills in an instant the hollow caverns underneath; and finding no\r\nother egress, and being borne in with tremendous violence, rushes up these\r\nchimneys, and flies, roaring furiously, to a height of full sixty feet.\r\nThe moment the wave recedes, the vacuum beneath causes the wind to rush\r\ninto the two apertures with a loud humming noise, which is heard at a\r\nconsiderable distance.\r\n\r\n“My companion and I arrived there before high water; and, having climbed\r\nacross the neck of rock, we seated ourselves close to the chimneys, where\r\nI proposed making a sketch, and had just begun, when in came a thundering\r\nsea, which broke right over the rock itself, and drove us back much\r\nalarmed.\r\n\r\n“Our negro guide now informed us that we must make haste to re‐cross our\r\nnarrow bridge, as the sea would get up as the tide rose. We lost no time,\r\nand got back dry enough; and I was obliged to make my sketches from the\r\nmainland.\r\n\r\n“In about three‐quarters of an hour the sight was truly magnificent. I do\r\nnot exaggerate in the least when I say the waves rolled in, long and\r\nunbroken, full twenty‐five feet high, till, meeting the headland, they\r\nbroke clear over it, sending the spray flying over to the mainland; while,\r\nfrom the centre of this mass of foam, the Souffleur shot up with a noise\r\nwhich we afterwards heard distinctly between two and three miles. Standing\r\non the main cliff, more than a hundred feet above the sea, we were quite\r\nwet.”\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: “THE SOUFFLEUR,” ISLAND OF MAURITIUS.]\r\n\r\nTo the combined influences of tides and waves may also be attributed the\r\nmonsoon hurricanes which so often visit the Indian Ocean. The air may have\r\nbeen just previously without a breath, when immense waves, accompanied by\r\nwhirlwinds, come rolling in. “At the period of the changing monsoons, the\r\nwinds, breaking loose from their controlling forces, seem to rage with a\r\nfury capable of breaking up the very foundations of the deep,” and ships\r\nare often literally whirled round, or bodily lifted up, their crews being\r\nutterly impotent.\r\n\r\nTurning to another subject, partially discussed before—the colour of the\r\nsea—it may be remarked that by itself as sea water it is really\r\ncolourless. Its varying colours are caused by reflection, by the varied\r\nbottoms it covers, or by the presence of actual animal, vegetable, and\r\nmineral bodies. The ocean,\r\n\r\n  “When winds breathe soft along the silent deep,”\r\n\r\nis azure blue or ultramarine, becoming greener in‐shore. There are some\r\ndays when it is generally green, others sombre and grey. A bottom of white\r\nsand will give a greyish or apple‐coloured green; of chalk, a pure clear\r\ngreen; if the bottom is brownish‐yellow sand, the green is naturally\r\nduller in character. In the Bay of Loango the waters appear of a deep red,\r\nfrom the red bottom. The Red Sea owes its colour to actual floating\r\nmicroscopic algæ and to red coral bottoms. Sea water, concentrated in the\r\nsalt marshes of the south of France by the heat of the sun, is also red:\r\nthis is due to the presence of a red‐shelled animal of microscopic size.\r\nThese minute creatures do not appear till the salt water has attained a\r\ncertain concentration, while they die when it has reached a further\r\ndensity. Navigators often traverse patches of green, red, white, or\r\nyellow‐coloured water, their coloration being due to the presence of\r\nmicroscopic crustaceans, medusæ, zoophytes, and marine plants.\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: A SHIP SAILING IN PHOSPHORESCENT SEA.]\r\n\r\nThe pleasing phenomenon known as the phosphorescence of the sea is\r\ngenerally, though by no means entirely, due to myriads of minute globular\r\ncreatures, called _Noctiluca_. Captain Kingman reported having traversed a\r\nzone twenty‐three miles in length, and so filled with phosphorescent\r\nmatter that during the night it presented the appearance of a vast field\r\nof snow. “There was scarcely a cloud in the heavens,” he tells us; “yet\r\nthe sky for about 10° above the horizon appeared as black as if a storm\r\nwere raging; stars of the first magnitude shone with a feeble light, and\r\nthe ‘milky way’ of the heavens was almost entirely eclipsed by that\r\nthrough which we were sailing.” Several varieties of molluscs and\r\nacalephes shine by their own light, while phosphorescence is often due to\r\nthe decomposition of animal matter.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: PHOSPHORESCENCE ON THE SURFACE OF THE SEA.]\r\n\r\nA French author thus describes the effect produced by the molluscs known\r\nto scientists as _Pyrosoma_, on a voyage to the Isle of France. He\r\nsays:—“The wind was blowing with great violence, the night was dark, and\r\nthe vessel was making rapid way, when what appeared to be a vast sheet of\r\nphosphorus presented itself, floating on the waves, and occupying a great\r\nspace ahead of the ship. The vessel having passed through this fiery mass,\r\nit was discovered that the light was occasioned by organised bodies\r\nswimming about in the sea at various depths around the ship. Those which\r\nwere deepest in the water looked like red‐hot balls, while those on the\r\nsurface resembled cylinders of red‐hot iron. Some of the latter were\r\ncaught; they were found to vary in size from three to seven inches. All\r\nthe exterior of the creatures bristled with long thick tubercles, shining\r\nlike so many diamonds, and these seemed to be the principal seats of their\r\nluminosity. Inside also there appeared to be a multitude of oblong narrow\r\nglands, exhibiting a high degree of phosphoric power. The colour of these\r\nanimals when in repose is an opal yellow, mixed with green; but on the\r\nslightest movement the animal exhibits a spontaneous contractile power,\r\nand assumes a luminous brilliancy, passing through various shades of deep‐\r\nred, orange‐green, and azure‐blue.” A ship plunging through these\r\nphosphorescent fields seems to advance through a sheet of white flame, a\r\nfield of luminous silver, scattering a spray of sparks in all directions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  DAVY JONES’S LOCKER.—SUBMARINE CABLES.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The First Channel Cable—Nowadays 50,000 Miles of Submarine Wire—A\r\n       Noble New Englander—The First Idea of the Atlantic Cable—Its\r\n    Practicability Admitted—Maury’s Notes on the Atlantic Bottom—Deep\r\n       Sea Soundings—Ooze, formed of Myriads of Shells—English Co‐\r\n      operation with Field—The First Cable of 1857—Paying Out—2,000\r\n    Fathoms down—The Cable Parted—Bitter Disappointment—The Cable Laid\r\n         and Working—Another Failure—The Employment of the _Great\r\n       Eastern_—Stowing Away the Great Wire Rope—Departure—Another\r\n           Accident—A Traitor on Board—Cable Fished up from the\r\n      Bottom—Failure—Inauguration of the 1866 Expedition—Prayer for\r\n         Success—A _Lucky_ Friday—Splicing to the Shore Cable—The\r\n     Start—Each Day’s Run—Approaching Trinity Bay—Success at Last—The\r\n                  Old and the New World Bound Together.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1850 a copper wire, insulated with gutta‐percha, was submerged\r\nbetween England and France, and that connecting link between the two\r\ngreatest countries of Europe was the first considerable success of its\r\nkind. To‐day Great Britain is connected with the European continent by a\r\ndozen cables, and there are over 50,000 miles of submerged wires silently\r\nconveying their messages over the face of the globe. Thirty years of\r\npractical scientific labour has united the whole world. You can telegraph\r\nor “wire” your commands to distant China or Japan; you can ask the market\r\nrates of wheat in the farthest west of the New World; you can correspond\r\nwith your wife in England if you are at the Antipodes. Puck’s idea of\r\nputting the “girdle round the earth” has been more than accomplished. The\r\nstory of the successes won at the very bottom of the ocean would take long\r\nto tell; here we can only follow the story of one of the grandest—that of\r\nthe Atlantic cable.\r\n\r\nIn the month of November, 1819, a noble American, whose career deserves to\r\nbe put on record, first saw the light. Cyrus W. Field has deservedly\r\nearned an honourable and honoured name in two worlds for indomitable\r\nperseverance and pluck.(31)\r\n\r\nThe New Englander has to‐day, and has always had, many of the best\r\nqualities of the Old Englander. In Field they were conspicuously\r\ndisplayed. In his “bright lexicon” there was—\r\n\r\n  “No such word as _fail_,”\r\n\r\nfor the worst disappointment only stirred him to fresh exertion.\r\n\r\n  “’Tis not in mortals to command success;\r\n  But we’ll do more, Sempronius—we’ll deserve it.”\r\n\r\nField was born in Stockbridge, Massachusetts, a rural village nook which\r\nlies calmly and peacefully cradled among the green Berkshire hills, a spot\r\nwhich would delight the eyes of a true artist. He was the son of a country\r\npastor, who, in spite of a paltry stipend of a hundred and fifty pounds a\r\nyear, and thanks to the scholastic advantages offered to every one in the\r\nUnited States, gave nine children a superior education. Several of these\r\nchildren distinguished themselves in after life, but none more than the\r\nsubject of this sketch.\r\n\r\nWhile to this energetic man is due the actual success, it is to Professor\r\nMorse, who had said that “telegraphic communication might with certainty\r\nbe established across the Atlantic Ocean,” and to an excellent Roman\r\nCatholic bishop, that the idea is to be fairly credited. Bishop Mullock,\r\nof Newfoundland, while lying becalmed in his yacht off Cape North, the\r\nextreme point of the province of Cape Breton, bethought himself how his\r\npoor neglected island might reap some advantage from being taken into the\r\ntrack of communication between Europe and America, for he saw that Nature\r\nhad provided an easy approach to the mainland for a cable. Fired with the\r\nidea, he wrote to one of the St. John’s papers, and his letter is to‐day a\r\nmodel of lucid explanation. About the same time Mr. Frederick N. Gisborne,\r\na practical telegraph operator, promulgated the idea of connecting St.\r\nJohn’s with the mainland, and one evening interested Mr. Cyrus Field, then\r\njust retired from business on a competency, in his scheme. “After he\r\nleft,” writes his brother, “Mr. Field took the globe which was standing in\r\nthe library, and began to turn it over. It was while thus studying the\r\nglobe that the idea first occurred to him that the telegraph might be\r\ncarried further still, and be made to span the Atlantic Ocean.” Maury, the\r\ndistinguished marine scientist, and Professor Morse, had also come to the\r\nsame conclusion, and at about the same time as had others in England. The\r\nhistory of the financial difficulties and ultimate triumphs connected with\r\nthe inauguration of the first cable would not interest the reader; suffice\r\nit to say that half‐a‐dozen New York millionaires subscribed the first\r\ncapital—a million and a half dollars. The cable across the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence was successfully laid in 1856, after one previous failure.\r\n\r\nAnd now Field began to clear the way by consulting the highest scientific\r\nauthorities on both sides of the Atlantic. Was it possible to carry a\r\ncable across the ocean? If laid, would it be able to convey messages? The\r\nfirst query related to mechanical difficulties only, such as the depth of\r\nthe ocean, the nature of the ocean bed, the influence of currents and\r\nwinds. The second referred to pure science and the conditions under which\r\nthe electric fluid acts—Would the lightning flash from shore to shore\r\nacross an intervening waste of sea? The answer to the first question was\r\nsupplied by Maury, who pointed out that between Ireland and Newfoundland\r\nthe bottom of the sea formed a plateau, or elevated table‐land, which, as\r\nhe said, seemed to have been placed there especially for the purpose of\r\nsupporting the wires of an electric telegraph, and protecting them from\r\ninjury. Its slope, he said, was quite regular, gradually increasing from\r\nthe shores of Newfoundland to the depth of from 1,500 to 2,000 fathoms as\r\nyou approach the Irish coast. It was neither too deep nor too shallow:\r\ndeep enough to protect the cable from danger by ships’ anchors, icebergs,\r\nand currents; shallow enough to secure that the wires should be readily\r\nlodged upon the bottom. From Professor Morse an equally satisfactory\r\nanswer was obtained. He declared his faith in the undertaking as a\r\npracticable one: that it might, could, and would be achieved.\r\n\r\nThe Company undertook to make a series of careful soundings to ascertain\r\nthe exact nature of the ocean bottom over which the cable connecting\r\nNewfoundland with Ireland would have to be laid. Mr. Field applied for\r\nthis purpose to the American Government, who immediately despatched the\r\n_Arctic_, under Lieutenant Berryman, on this useful and most necessary\r\nservice. She sailed from New York on the 18th of July, 1856; and on the\r\nfollowing day Mr. Field left in the steamship _Baltic_ for England, to\r\norganise the Atlantic Telegraph Company. The _Arctic_ proceeded to St.\r\nJohn’s, and thence went on her way across the deep, in three weeks\r\nreaching the coast of Ireland, and clearly demonstrating, as the result of\r\nher survey, the existence of a great plateau under the ocean, extending\r\nall the way from the New World to the Old. To make assurance doubly sure,\r\nMr. Field solicited the British Admiralty “to make what further soundings\r\nmight be necessary between Ireland and Newfoundland, and to verify those\r\nmade by Lieutenant Berryman.” In response to this appeal the Admiralty\r\nsent out the _Cyclops_, under Lieutenant Dayman, a very capable officer,\r\nwho executed his task with great zeal and success. He showed that the\r\ndepth of the water on the so‐called telegraphic plateau—the elevated\r\ntable‐land which Providence had raised between the two continents—nowhere\r\nexceeded 2,500 fathoms, or 15,000 feet. Such a depth is almost trivial\r\ncompared with the enormous depths in other parts of the Atlantic, where\r\nyou might hide from all human eyes the loftiest snow‐clad peak of the\r\nHimalayas, yet no inconsiderable depth if you reflect that the peak of\r\nTeneriffe, were it here “cast into the sea,” would sink out of sight,\r\nisland, mountain, and all; and even the coloured crest of Mont Blanc would\r\nrise but a few hundred feet above the waves. The single exception to this\r\nuniform depth occurs about 200 miles off the Irish coast, where within an\r\narea of about a dozen miles the depth sinks from 550 to 1,750 fathoms. In\r\n14° 48’ W., says Dayman, we have 550 fathoms rock, and in 150° 6’ W. we\r\nhave 1,750 fathoms ooze. In little more than ten miles of distance a\r\nchange of depth takes place amounting to fully 7,200 feet. It was supposed\r\nthat this tremendous declivity would be the chief point of danger in\r\nlaying down the cable; and to remove, if possible, the anxiety which\r\nexisted, Lieutenant Dayman made a further survey. The result showed that\r\nthe dip was not a sudden one; the precipitous bank or submarine cliff\r\nturned out to be a gradual slope of nearly sixty miles. Over this long\r\nslope, said a writer in the _Times_, the difference between its greatest\r\nheight and greatest depth is only 8,760 feet, so that the average incline\r\nis, in round numbers, about 145 feet per mile. A good gradient on a\r\nrailway is now generally considered to be 1 in 100 feet, or about 53 feet\r\nin a mile; so that the incline on this supposed bank is only about three\r\ntimes that of an ordinary railway. It was found upon these surveys that\r\nthe ocean bed consisted of a soft ooze, as soft as the moss which clings\r\nto old damp stone on the river’s brink. And of what does this ooze\r\nconsist? The microscope revealed the astonishing fact that it is made up\r\nof myriads of shells, too minute to be discovered by the naked eye, yet\r\neach perfect in itself, unbroken and uninjured. These organisms live near\r\nthe surface of the water, but in death sink down to the bottom, and there\r\nfind a calm and peaceful resting‐place. Well has it been said that a\r\nmighty work of life and death has for ages been going on in the tranquil\r\nbosom of ocean. Myriads upon myriads, ever since the morning of creation,\r\nhave been falling—falling like snow‐flakes, till their remains cover with\r\na thick stratum of beautiful organisms the ocean bed. “The bearing of this\r\ndiscovery,” says Dr. Field, “on the problem of a submarine telegraph was\r\nobvious. For it, too, was to lie on the ocean bed, beside and among those\r\nrelics that had so long been drifting down upon the watery plain. And if\r\nthese tiny shells slept there unharmed, surely an iron cord might rest\r\nthere in safety. There were no swift currents down there; no rushing waves\r\nagitated that sunless sea. There the waters moved not, and there might\r\nrest the great nerve that was to pass from continent to continent. And so\r\nfar as injury from the surrounding elements was concerned, there it might\r\nremain, whispering the thoughts of successive generations of men, till the\r\nsea should give up its dead.” Everything showed that the project of an\r\nAtlantic cable was feasible. All that remained was to raise the capital\r\nnecessary for its development. But this could be done only by the\r\nformation of a large and influential company, the enterprise having\r\noutgrown the resources of Mr. Field and his little band of New York\r\nmerchants. While engaged in submitting his scheme to the consideration of\r\nthe capitalists of London, Mr. Field found counsel and encouragement from\r\nmany men distinguished in the world of science, and among his principal\r\nsupporters had the good fortune to rank Glass and Elliot, now so well\r\nknown as manufacturers of sea‐cables, and the celebrated engineers whose\r\nnames are associated with the scientific marvels of the age—Brett, Bidder,\r\nRobert Stephenson, and Brunel. The last‐named was then building the\r\ncolossal ship afterwards called the _Great Eastern_; and one day taking\r\nMr. Field down to see her gigantic hull as it lay in the yard at\r\nBlackwall, he exclaimed—and, as results have proved, prophetically—“There\r\nis the ship to lay your Atlantic cable!”\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: SECTION OF THE FIRST ATLANTIC CABLE.]\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic Telegraph Company was formed; and 2,500 miles of cable were\r\nmanufactured and stowed on board the English naval vessel _Agamemnon_ and\r\nthe United States ship _Niagara_. It was on the evening of August 7th,\r\n1857, that the squadron sailed; and according to arrangement the _Niagara_\r\nat once began to pay out the cable very slowly; but before five miles had\r\nbeen accomplished the heavy shore end of the cable got entangled with the\r\nmachinery through the carelessness of one of the men in charge, and\r\nparted. The _Niagara_ put back, and the cable was “under run” the whole\r\ndistance. At last the end was raised from the water and “spliced” to the\r\ngigantic coil, and as it dropped safely to its resting‐place among the\r\n“salt sea ooze” the noble ship once more went on her way. Saturday, we are\r\ntold, was a day of beautiful weather. The squadron made good progress at a\r\nrate of from four to five miles an hour, and the cable was paid out at a\r\nspeed somewhat exceeding that of the ship, to allow for any irregularities\r\nof surface on the bottom of the sea. Meantime a constant communication was\r\nkept up with the land. Every moment the electric fluid flashed between\r\nship and shore. Not only did the electricians wire back to Valentia the\r\nprogress they were making, but the officers on board sent messages to\r\ntheir friends in America to go out by the steamer from Liverpool. The very\r\nheavens seemed to regard the enterprise with favour. All went merrily as a\r\nmarriage bell. Without a kink the coil came up from the vessel’s hold, and\r\nunwinding easily, passed over the stern into the sea. Once or twice,\r\nhowever, a momentary alarm was caused by the cable being thrown off the\r\nwheels, an accident due to the insufficient width and depth of the sheaves\r\nand to the fact that they were filled with tar, which hardened in the air.\r\nThis defect was remedied in later expeditions. Still it worked well, and\r\nas long as the terrible brakes withheld their iron grasp might work\r\nthrough to the end. On the following day, Sunday, the course of affairs\r\nwas not less smooth; and on Monday the expedition was upwards of 200 miles\r\nfrom land. The shallow water of the coast had been safely traversed. The\r\nships had passed over the submarine declivity which has been already\r\ndescribed, and had reached the deeper waters of the Atlantic, where the\r\ncable sank to a depth of not less than 2,000 fathoms. Still the iron cord\r\nburied itself in the profound silence, and every instant the flash of\r\nlight in the telegraph room recorded the continuous passage of the\r\nmysterious electric current. About four o’clock on Tuesday morning,\r\nhowever, a sudden interruption occurred. It seems from the published\r\nnarrative that the cable was running cut fully at the rate of six miles an\r\nhour, while the ship was making only four. To check this waste, the\r\nengineer applied the brakes very firmly, with the effect of stopping the\r\nmachine. Hence a heavy strain told on the submerged portion of the cable.\r\nThe stern of the ship was down in the trough of the sea, and as it rose\r\nupward on the swell the pressure became too great, and the cable parted.\r\nInstantly a cry of grief and dismay ran through the ship. She was checked\r\nin her onward career, and in five minutes all gathered on deck with\r\nfeelings which can be better imagined than described. One who was present\r\nwrote:—“The unbidden tear started to many a manly eye. The interest taken\r\nin the enterprise by all—every one, officers and men—exceeded anything I\r\never saw, and there is no wonder that there should have been so much\r\nemotion at our failure.” Captain Hudson says:—“It made all hands of us\r\nthrough the day like a household or family which had lost their dearest\r\nfriend, for officers and men had been deeply interested in the success of\r\nthe enterprise.” The cable broke in 2,000 fathoms water, when about 330\r\nnautical miles were laid, at a distance of 280 miles from Valentia. This\r\nwas the first of a series of disappointments, ending, however, in eventual\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\nThe same vessels sailed again in June of the next year, and as arranged\r\nbefore starting, reached a point of junction in mid‐stream, where the ends\r\nof the two cables were spliced, and the ships parted, the _Agamemnon_\r\nsteering for Valentia, and the _Niagara_ for Trinity Bay, Newfoundland.\r\nBoth vessels arrived at their ports of destination on August 5th, and the\r\nfact of the completion of the enterprise was for the first time “cabled”\r\nunder the wide Atlantic two days later, to the great rejoicing, it may\r\nfairly be said, of two worlds. Congratulatory messages were flashed from\r\neither end, and success seemed secured. Alas! less than a month later all\r\ncommunication ceased; the electric current would not pass through the\r\ngreat wire‐rope; there was a leakage somewhere. But it had been shown\r\nconclusively that messages _could_ be transmitted under the given\r\nconditions. This was something.\r\n\r\nPassing over all the financial arrangements connected with a new attempt,\r\nwhich was not made till 1865, we find Brunel’s prediction fulfilled. The\r\nlargest ship in the world was chartered to lay another cable.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: EXTERIOR AND SECTION OF THE 1865 ATLANTIC CABLE.]\r\n\r\nThe work of stowing away the cable on board the _Great Eastern_, where it\r\nwas coiled up in three immense tanks—one aft, one amidships, and one\r\nforward—began in January and was not completed until June. It will give\r\nthe reader an idea of the enormous size and capacity of the _Great\r\nEastern_ when he is told that though the cable measured 2,700 miles, a\r\nvisitor to the mammoth ship was at first unaware of its being on board!\r\nHere is the account given by a writer who went to see the ship and its\r\nnovel cargo. Its details are interesting. “It is time,” he says, after a\r\ngeneral survey of the wonders of the huge vessel—“it is time we should\r\nlook after what we have mainly come to see—the telegraph cable. To our\r\nintense astonishment we beheld it—nowhere, although informed that there\r\nare nearly 2,000 miles of it already on board, and that the remaining\r\npiece, which is long enough to stretch from Land’s End to John o’ Groat’s,\r\nis in course of shipment. We walk up and down on the deck of the _Great\r\nEastern_ without seeing this chain which is to bind together the Old World\r\nand the New, and it is only on having the place pointed out to us that we\r\nfind out where the cable lies.” The writer then describes the process of\r\ntaking it on board:—“On the side opposite to where we landed, deep below\r\nthe deck of our giant, is moored a vessel surmounted by a timber structure\r\nresembling a house, and from this vessel the wonderful telegraph cable is\r\ndrawn silently into the immense womb of the _Great Eastern_. The work is\r\ndone so quietly and noiselessly, by means of a small steam‐engine, that we\r\nscarcely notice it. Indeed, were it not pointed out to us, we would never\r\nthink that that little iron cord, _about an inch in diameter_, which is\r\nsliding over a few rollers and through a wooden table, is a thing of\r\nworld‐wide fame—a thing which may influence the life of whole nations,\r\nnay, which may affect the march of civilisation. Following the direction\r\nin which the iron rope goes, we now come to the most marvellous sight....\r\nWe find ourselves in a little wooden cabin, and look down over a railing\r\nat the side into an immense cavern below. This cavern is one of the three\r\n‘tanks’ in which the two‐thousand‐mile cable is finding a temporary home.\r\nThe passive agent of electricity comes creeping in here in a beautiful\r\nsilent manner, and is deposited in coils, layer above layer. It is almost\r\ndark at the immense depth below, and we can only dimly discern the human\r\nfigures through whose hands the coil passes to its bed. Suddenly, however,\r\nthe men begin singing. They intone a low, plaintive song of the sea,\r\nsomething like Kingsley’s\r\n\r\n  “Three fishers went sailing away to the west,\r\n    Away to the west, as the sun went down,”\r\n\r\nthe sounds of which rise up from the dark deep cavern with startling\r\neffect, and produce an indescribable impression. We move on; but the song\r\nof the sailors who are taking charge of the Atlantic telegraph cable is\r\nhaunting us like a dream. In vain that our guide conducts us all over the\r\nbig ship, through miles of galleries, passages, staircases, and\r\npromenades; through gorgeous saloons full of mirrors, marbles, paintings,\r\nand upholstery, made ‘regardless of expense’; and through buildings\r\ncrowded with glittering steam apparatus of gigantic dimensions, where the\r\nlatent power of coal and water creates the force which propels this\r\nmonster vessel across the seas. In vain our attention is directed to all\r\nthese sights; we do not admire them; our imagination is used up. The echo\r\nof the sailors’ song in the womb of the _Great Eastern_ will not be\r\nbanished from our mind. It raises visions of the future of the mystic iron\r\ncoil under our feet: how it will roll forth again from its narrow berth;\r\nhow it will sink to the bottom of the Atlantic or hang from mountain to\r\nmountain far below the stormy waves; and how two great nations, the\r\noffspring of one race and the pioneers of civilisation, will speak through\r\nthis wonderful coil, annihilating distance and time. Who can help dreaming\r\nhere on the spot where we stand? For it is truly a marvellous romance of\r\ncivilisation, this _Great Eastern_ and this Atlantic telegraph cable. Even\r\nshould our age produce nothing else, it alone would be the triumph of our\r\nage.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE PAYING‐OUT MACHINERY ON BOARD THE “GREAT EASTERN.”]\r\n\r\nThe _Great Eastern_ left the Thames on July 13th, 1865. After sundry\r\nmishaps, she turned her mighty prow towards the sunset, and proceeded on\r\nher stately way. All went well until the 29th of July, when a little after\r\nnoon a new cry of alarm was raised. And well it might be, for the\r\ninsulation was completely destroyed and the electric current overflowing\r\nuselessly into the sea. As the faulty piece had gone overboard, it was\r\nnecessary once more to reverse the vessel’s course, and haul in the cable\r\nuntil the defective part was recovered. This was a difficult task, for\r\nthey were in water two miles deep. Difficulties did not, however, daunt\r\nthe pioneers of this great enterprise, and after working all the\r\nafternoon, the injured cable was got on board about ten o’clock at night.\r\nIt was at once stowed away, and the next morning, Sunday, was welcomed\r\nwith an eager feeling of relief and delight after the suspense of the\r\npreceding four‐and‐twenty hours. On Monday the miles of cable which had\r\nbeen hauled up and were coiled in huge heaps upon the deck were closely\r\nexamined to discover the origin of the mischief. This was soon detected.\r\nNear the end a piece of wire was thrust through the very core, as if\r\ndriven into it. The recurrence of such a mishap actually suggested\r\nsuspicions of treachery. It was observed that the same gang of workmen\r\nwere in the tank as at the time of the first fault. Mr. Canning sent for\r\nthe men, and showing them the cable and the wire, asked for an\r\nexplanation. All replied that it must have been done intentionally, and\r\nregretted that there was a traitor among them—the unknown traitor, of\r\ncourse, being one of those who thus expressed their sorrow. It seemed\r\ndifficult to believe that any person could be base enough to plot in this\r\nstealthy way against the success of a beneficent enterprise, but such a\r\nthing had been done before in a cable in the North Sea, when the\r\nperpetrator of the crime was discovered and punished. In the present case\r\nthere were not wanting motives to prompt the commission of such an act.\r\nThe fall in the stock, we are told, on the London Exchange, caused by a\r\nloss of the cable, could hardly be less than half a million sterling. It\r\nwas, however, found impossible to fix the deed on any one, for nothing was\r\nproved; and the instigator and the perpetrator both remaining unknown, of\r\ncourse a painful feeling of suspicion was left in the minds of Mr. Field\r\nand his colleagues. They saw that they must be on their guard; and it was\r\nagreed, therefore, that the gentlemen on board should take turn in keeping\r\nwatch in the tank. The _Great Eastern_ continued her voyage, and for three\r\ndays, during which they accomplished 500 miles, no further trouble\r\noccurred. A few days later, however, a defect was found in the cable, and\r\nit became necessary to haul in a short portion of that last paid out.\r\nUnfortunately the machinery proved too weak for the purpose, and a breeze\r\nspringing up, the cable chafed until it snapped right asunder. With one\r\nbound it flew through the stoppers, and plunged into the sea. “The shock\r\nof the instant,” Dr. Russell tells us, “was as sharp as the snapping of\r\nthe cable itself,” so great was the disappointment felt on board.\r\n\r\nThe apparently wild attempt was immediately made to _recover_ the cable.\r\nIt was settled that the _Great Eastern_ should steam to windward, and\r\neastward of the position she occupied when the cable went down, lower a\r\ngrapnel, and slowly drift across the track in which the lost treasure was\r\nsupposed to be lying. So the leviathan ship stood away some thirteen or\r\nfourteen miles, and then lay‐to in smooth water. The grapnel consisted of\r\ntwo five‐armed anchors, of several hundredweight, one of which was\r\nshackled and secured to wire rope, of which there were five miles on\r\nboard, and committed to the deep. “Away slipped the rope, yard after yard,\r\nfathom after fathom; ocean, like the horse‐leech’s daughter still crying\r\nfor ‘more’ and ‘more,’ still descending into the black waste of waters.\r\nOne thousand fathoms—still more! One thousand five hundred fathoms—still\r\nmore! Two thousand fathoms—more, still more! Two thousand five hundred\r\nfathoms (15,000 feet)—aye, that will do; the grapnel has reached the bed\r\nof the Atlantic; the search has commenced.” Next morning these efforts\r\nbore fruit, for the great sea‐serpentine cable was caught, and raised\r\nseven hundred fathoms (4,200 feet), towards the surface, unhappily to\r\nagain fall to the bottom. A second attempt resulted in raising it a mile\r\nand a half, when a swivel gave way, and it again sank to the bottom. These\r\nexperiments had used up a considerable quantity of the wire rope, and\r\nevery expedient had to be adopted to patch up and strengthen the fishing\r\napparatus, which gave full employment to the mechanics on board. Great\r\nforge‐fires were made on deck, which at night illumined the ocean for a\r\ndistance round, and helped to make a striking and effective scene. A third\r\nand fourth attempt was made to raise the cable; but in spite of the\r\nindomitable perseverance of Field and his associates, without success, and\r\nthe bows of the great ship were sorrowfully directed towards home.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these failures no abatement of public confidence in the\r\neventual success of the enterprise was shown on the return of the\r\nexpedition to England. Nearly a quarter of a million pounds sterling was\r\nsubscribed _privately_ towards the next attempt, and when the subscription\r\nbooks were thrown open to the public, the whole capital required was\r\nfurnished in a fortnight. Some minor improvements were introduced in the\r\nsuccessful 1866 cable; among other points, it was galvanised.\r\n\r\nWhen the day arrived for the final great effort, the undertaking was\r\ninaugurated solemnly by special prayer and supplication. Dr. Field says of\r\nthat moment:—\r\n\r\n“Was there ever a fitter place or a fitter hour for prayer than here, in\r\nthe presence of the great sea to which they were about to commit their\r\nlives and their precious trust? The first expedition ever sent forth had\r\nbeen consecrated by prayer. On that very spot, nine years before, all\r\nheads were uncovered and all forms bent low at the solemn words of\r\nsupplication; and there had the Earl of Carlisle—since gone to his\r\nhonoured grave—cheered them on with high religious hopes, describing the\r\nships which were sent forth on such a mission as ‘beautiful upon the\r\nwaters as were the feet upon the mountains of them that publish the gospel\r\nof peace.’\r\n\r\n“Full of such a spirit, officers and directors assembled at Valentia on\r\nthe day before the expedition sailed, and held a religious service. It was\r\na scene long to be remembered. There were men of the closet and men of the\r\nfield, men of science and men of action, men pale with study and men\r\nbronzed by sun and storm. All was hushed and still. Not a single gun broke\r\nthe deep silence of the hour, as, with humble hearts, they bowed together\r\nbefore the God and Father of all. They were about to ‘go down to the sea\r\nin ships,’ and they felt their dependence on a higher Power. Their\r\npreparations were complete. All that man could do was done. They had\r\nexhausted every resource of science and skill. The issue now remained with\r\nHim who controls the winds and waves. Therefore was it most fit that\r\nbefore embarking they should thus commit themselves to Him who alone\r\nspreadeth out the heavens and ruleth the raging sea.\r\n\r\n“In all this there is something of antique stamp, something which makes us\r\nthink of the sublime men of an earlier and better time: of the Pilgrim\r\nFathers kneeling on the deck of their little ship at Leyden, as they were\r\nabout to seek a refuge and a home in the forests of the New World, and of\r\nColumbus and his companions celebrating a solemn service before their\r\ndeparture from Spain. And so with labour and with prayer was this great\r\nexpedition prepared to sail once more from the shores of Ireland, bearing\r\nthe hopes of science and of civilisation, with courage and skill looking\r\nout from the bows of the ship across the stormy waters, and a religious\r\nfaith, like that of Columbus, standing at the helm.\r\n\r\n“On Friday the 13th of July, 1866, the fleet finally bade adieu to the\r\nland. Was Friday an unlucky day? Some of the sailors thought so, and would\r\nhave been glad to leave a day before or after. But Columbus sailed on\r\nFriday, and discovered the New World on Friday; and so this expedition put\r\nto sea on Friday, and, as a good Providence would have it, reached land on\r\nthe other side of the Atlantic on the same day of the week! As the ships\r\ndisappeared below the horizon, Mr. Glass and Mr. Varley went up on their\r\nwatch‐tower, not to look, but to listen for the first voice from the sea.\r\nThe ships bore away for the buoy where lay the end of the shore line, but\r\nthe weather was thick and foggy, with frequent bursts of rain, and they\r\ncould not see far on the water. For an hour or two the ships went sailing\r\nround and round, like sea‐gulls in search of prey. At length the _Medway_\r\ncaught sight of the buoy tossing on the waves, and firing a signal gun,\r\nbore down straight upon it. The cable was soon hauled up from its bed, 100\r\nfathoms deep, and lashed to the stern of the _Great Eastern_; and the\r\nwatchers on shore, who had been waiting with some impatience, saw the\r\nfirst flash, and Varley read, ‘Got the shore‐end all right; going to make\r\nthe splice.’ Then all was still, and they knew that that delicate\r\noperation was going on. Quick, nimble hands tore off the covering from a\r\nfoot of the shore‐end and of the main cable till they came to the core,\r\nthen swiftly unwinding the copper wires they laid them together as closely\r\nand carefully as a silken braid. Then this delicate child of the sea was\r\nwrapped in swaddling clothes, covered up with many coatings of gutta‐\r\npercha and hempen rope and strong iron wires, the whole bound round and\r\nround with heavy bands, and the splicing was complete. Signals are now\r\nsent through the whole cable on board the _Great Eastern_ and back to the\r\ntelegraph house at Valentia, and the whole length, 2,440 nautical miles,\r\nis reported perfect, and so with light hearts they bear away. It is nearly\r\nthree o’clock. As they turn to the west, the following is the ‘order of\r\nbattle’: the _Terrible_ goes ahead, standing off on the starboard bow, the\r\n_Medway_ is on the port, and the _Albany_ on the starboard quarter. From\r\nthat hour the voyage was a steady progress. Indeed, it was almost\r\nmonotonous from its uninterrupted success. The weather was variable,\r\nalternating with sunshine and rain, fogs and squalls; but there was no\r\nheavy sea to interrupt their course, and the distance run was about the\r\nsame from day to day, as the following table will show:—\r\n\r\n                  Distance Run.    Cable Paid Out.\r\n                  Miles.

On the last voyage it\r\nwas thought that she had once or twice run too fast, and thus exposed the\r\ncable to danger. It was therefore decided to go slowly but surely. Holding\r\nher back to this moderate pace, her average speed from the time the splice\r\nwas made until they saw land was a little less than five nautical miles an\r\nhour, while the cable was paid out at an average of not quite five and\r\nhalf miles. Thus the total slack was about eleven per cent., showing that\r\nthe cable was laid almost in a straight line, allowing for the swells and\r\nhollows at the bottom of the sea. “Friday, July 27.—Shortly after 2 p.m.\r\nyesterday two ships, which were soon made out to be steamers, were seen to\r\nthe westward; and the _Terrible_, steaming on ahead, in about an hour\r\nsignalled to us that H.M.S. _Niger_ was one of them, accompanied by the\r\n_Albany_. The _Niger_, Captain Bunce, sent aboard to the _Terrible_ as\r\nsoon as he came up with her. The _Albany_ shortly afterwards took up her\r\nposition on our starboard quarter, and signalled that she spoke the\r\n_Niger_ at noon, bearing E. by N., and that the _Lily_ was anchored at the\r\nstation in the entrance of Trinity Bay, as arranged with the Admiral. The\r\n_Albany_ also reported that she had passed an iceberg about sixty feet\r\nhigh. At twenty minutes after 4 p.m. the _Niger_ came on our port side,\r\nquite close, and Captain Bunce, sending the crew into the rigging and\r\nmanning the yards, gave us three cheers, which were heartily returned by\r\nthe _Great Eastern_. She then steamed ahead towards Trinity Bay. The\r\n_Albany_ was signalled to go on immediately to Heart’s Content, clear the\r\nN.E. side of the harbour of shipping, and place a boat with a red flag for\r\nCaptain Anderson to steer to for anchorage. Just before dinner we saw on\r\nthe southern horizon, distant about ten miles, an iceberg, probably the\r\none that the _Albany_ had met with. It was apparently about fifty or sixty\r\nfeet in height. The fog came on very thickly about 8 p.m., and between\r\nthat and 10 we were constantly exchanging guns and burning blue lights\r\nwith the _Terrible_, which, with the _Niger_, went in search of the _Lily_\r\nstation‐ship. The _Terrible_ being signalled to come up and take her\r\nposition, informed us that they had made the _Lily_ out, and that she bore\r\nthen about ENE., distant about four miles. Later in the night Captain\r\nCommerell said that if Captain Anderson would stop the _Great Eastern_ he\r\nwould send the surveyor, Mr. Robinson, R.N., who came up in the _Niger_,\r\naboard of us; and about 3 the engines were slowed, and the _Terrible_\r\nshortly afterwards came alongside with that officer. Catalina Light, at\r\nthe entrance of Trinity Bay, had been made out three hours before this,\r\nand the loom of the coast had also been seen. Fog still prevailing!\r\nAccording to Mr. Robinson’s account, if they had got one clear day in\r\nseven at the entrance of Trinity Bay they considered themselves fortunate.\r\nHere we are now (6 a.m.) within ten miles of Heart’s Content, and we can\r\nscarcely see more than a ship’s length. The _Niger_, however, is ahead,\r\nand her repeated guns tell us where we are with accuracy. Good fortune\r\nfollows us, and scarcely has 8 o’clock arrived, when the massive curtain\r\nof fog raises itself gradually from both sides of Trinity Bay, disclosing\r\nto us the entrance of Heart’s Content, the _Albany_ making for the\r\nharbour, the _Margaretta Stevenson_, surveying vessel, steaming out to\r\nmeet us, the pre‐arranged pathway all marked with buoys by Mr. T. H. Kerr,\r\nR.N., and a whole fleet of fishing boats fishing at the entrance. We could\r\nnow plainly see that Heart’s Content, so far as its capabilities\r\npermitted, was prepared to welcome us. The British and American flags\r\nfloated from the church and telegraph station and other buildings. We had\r\ndressed ship, fired a salute, and given three cheers, and Captain\r\nCommerell, of H.M.S. _Terrible_, was soon on board to congratulate us on\r\nour success. At 9 o’clock, ship’s time, just as we had cut the cable and\r\nmade arrangements for the _Medway_ to lay the shore end, a message\r\narrived, giving us the concluding words of a leader in this morning’s\r\n_Times_: ‘It is a great work, a glory to our age and nation, and the men\r\nwho have achieved it deserve to be honoured amongst the benefactors of\r\ntheir race.’ ‘Treaty of peace signed between Prussia and Austria!’ It was\r\nnow time for the chief engineer, Mr. Canning, to make preparations for\r\nsplicing on board the _Medway_. Accompanied by Mr. Good, M.P., Mr.\r\nClifford, Mr. Willoughby Smith, and Messrs. Temple and Deane, he went on\r\nboard; the _Terrible_ and _Niger_ having sent their paddle‐box boats to\r\nassist. Shortly afterwards the _Great Eastern_ steamed into the harbour\r\nand anchored on the NE. side, and was quickly surrounded by boats laden\r\nwith visitors. Mr. Cyrus Field had gone on shore before the _Great\r\nEastern_ had left the offing, with a view of telegraphing to St. John’s to\r\nhire a vessel to repair the cable unhappily broken between Cape Ray, in\r\nNewfoundland, and Cape North, in Breton Island. Before a couple of hours\r\nthe shore end will be landed, and it is impossible to conceive a finer day\r\nfor effecting this our final operation. To‐morrow Heart’s Content will\r\nawaken to the fact that it is a highly‐favoured place in the world’s\r\nesteem, the western landing‐place of that marvel of electric communication\r\nwith the eastern hemisphere which is now happily, and we hope finally,\r\nestablished.” The foregoing simple record tells the great story of this\r\nmemorable voyage. In England the progress of the expedition was known from\r\nday to day, but on the American side of the ocean all was uncertainty.\r\nSome had gone to Heart’s Content hoping to witness the arrival of the\r\nfleet, but not so many as the year before, for the memory of the last\r\nfailure was too fresh, and they feared another disappointment. But still a\r\nfaithful few were there who kept their daily watch. The correspondents of\r\nthe American papers reported only a long and anxious suspense till that\r\nmorning when the first ship was seen in the offing. And now the hull of\r\nthe _Great Eastern_ looms up all glorious in that morning sky. They are\r\ncoming! Instantly all was wild excitement on shore. Boats put off to row\r\ntowards the fleet. The _Albany_ was the first to round the point and enter\r\nthe bay. The _Terrible_ came close behind. The _Medway_ stopped an hour or\r\ntwo to join on the heavy shore end, while the _Great Eastern_, gliding\r\ncalmly in as if she had done nothing remarkable, dropped her anchor in\r\nfront of the telegraph house, having trailed behind her a chain of two\r\nthousand miles, to bind the Old World to the New. That same afternoon, as\r\nsoon as the shore end was landed, Captain Anderson and the officers of the\r\nfleet went in a body to the little church of Heart’s Content to render\r\nthanks for the success of the expedition. A sermon was preached on the\r\ntext, “There shall be no more sea,” and all joined in the sublime prayers\r\nand thanksgivings of the Church of England. Thus the voyage ended as it\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: THE “GREAT EASTERN” LAYING THE ATLANTIC CABLE.\r\n          (_From Cassell’s “Illustrated History of England.”_)]\r\n\r\nAlthough the expedition reached Newfoundland on Friday the 27th, yet as\r\nthe cable across the Gulf of St. Lawrence was broken, the news was not\r\nreceived in New York until the 29th. It was early Sunday morning, before\r\nthe Sabbath bells had rung their call to prayer, that the tidings came.\r\nThe first announcement was brief—“Heart’s Content, July 27th.—We arrived\r\nhere at nine o’clock this morning. All well. Thank God the cable is laid,\r\nand is in perfect working order.—CYRUS W. FIELD.” Soon followed the\r\ndespatch to the Associated Press, giving the details of the voyage, and\r\nending with a just tribute to the skill and devotion of all who had\r\ncontributed to its success. Said Mr. Field: “I cannot find words suitable\r\nto convey my admiration for the men who have so ably conducted the\r\nnautical, engineering, and electrical departments of this enterprise,\r\namidst difficulties which must be seen to be appreciated; in fact, all on\r\nboard of the telegraph fleet, and all connected with the enterprise, have\r\ndone their best to have the cable made and laid in a perfect condition.”\r\nOther despatches followed in quick succession, giving the latest events of\r\nthe war in Europe. All this confirmed the great triumph, and filled the\r\nbreasts of many with wonder and gratitude that Sabbath day as they went up\r\nto the house of God and rendered thanks to Him who is Lord of the earth\r\nand sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE OCEAN AND ITS LIVING WONDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Perfection in Nature’s Smallest Works—A Word on Scientific\r\n       Classification—Protozoa—Blind Life—Rhizopoda—Foraminifera—A\r\n           Robbery Traced by Science—Microscopic Workers—Paris\r\n    Chalk—Infusoria—The “Sixth Sense of Man”—Fathers of Nations—Milne‐\r\n       Edwards’ Submarine Explorations—The Salt‐water Aquarium—The\r\n    Compensating Balance Required—Brighton and Sydenham—Practical Uses\r\n     of the Aquarium—Medusæ: their Beauty—A Poet’s Description—Their\r\n       General Characteristics—Battalions of “Jelly‐fish”—Polyps—A\r\n    Floating Colony—A Marvellous Organism—The Graceful Agalma—Swimming\r\n         Apparatus—Natural Fishing Lines—The “Portuguese Man‐of‐\r\n    War”—Stinging Powers of the Physalia—An Enemy to the Cuttle‐fish.\r\n\r\n\r\nPliny says that “Nature is nowhere more perfect than in her smaller\r\nworks.” How gradually, yet beautifully, do the lower forms of life ascend\r\nto the higher! Here we may well remember the following: Scientific\r\nnaturalists, men of logical minds arranging the facts of Nature with\r\nmethodical and almost mathematical precision, have distributed the forms\r\nof animal life into divisions, classes, orders, families, genera, and\r\nspecies. These divisions, however convenient, are, it must be noted,\r\nmerely of human invention, subject to alteration as knowledge\r\nincreases—subject even to positive mistake. Linnæus tells us that _Natura\r\nnon facit saltus_—Nature does not jump or leap from one stage to another,\r\nbut passes almost insensibly, life merging into other life.\r\n\r\nA word commonly employed in connection with the lower forms of marine life\r\nalso requires some passing notice. The term _zoophyte_, derived from two\r\nGreek words signifying respectively _animal_ and _plant_, would seem\r\nappropriate enough in describing generally many of the organisms found in\r\nthe great deep. But the term as now used signifies an animal, and nothing\r\nbut one, however plant‐like it may appear.\r\n\r\nThe simplest forms of marine animal life are found in the extensive group\r\nknown as the Protozoa. Varied as they are, they may be generally described\r\nas devoid of articulate skeleton, or nervous system; they are animals, a\r\nlarge part of them microscopic, with a vegetative existence. “In their\r\nobscure and blind life,” says Figuier, “have they consciousness or\r\ninstinct? Do they know what takes place at the three‐thousandth part of an\r\ninch from their microscopic bodies? To the Creator alone does the\r\nknowledge of this mystery belong.”\r\n\r\nThe limits of this work preclude the possibility of details. To the\r\ndivision Protozoa belong the sponges, already described, the Rhizopods\r\n(_Rhizopoda_), _root‐footed_ animals, and the _Infusoria_, animalcules so\r\nsmall that a drop of water may contain millions.\r\n\r\nThe Rhizopods are found both in fresh and salt water, but the marine forms\r\nare by far the more numerous. They are simply minute lumps of diaphanous\r\njelly, the quantity of matter in them being so infinitesimal, and their\r\ntransparency so great, that the eye, assisted by the powers of the\r\nmicroscope, can only take cognisance of them by the most careful\r\narrangement of light. But for all that, they are known to have feet or\r\nfeelers, to have digestive apparatus—some of them being, for their size,\r\nquite voracious feeders—which may be seen stuffed with microscopic _algæ_,\r\nor sea‐weeds. It is believed that they are multiplied by parting with\r\nportions of their bodies, which become separate beings.\r\n\r\nThe _Reticulosa_, or _Foraminifera_, form an order of this group. They are\r\nsmall calcareous shells, as a rule, nearly invisible to the naked eye, and\r\nenclosing, or once having enclosed, a living organism. The sand of the\r\nsea‐shore is often one‐half composed of them. M. d’Orbigny found in three\r\ngrammes (forty‐six grains troy) of sand from the Antilles no less than\r\n440,000 of these minute shells. Ehrenberg, the German microscopist, was\r\nonce invited by the Prussian Government to assist in tracing the robbery\r\nof a special case of wine. It had been packed in sand only found in an\r\nancient sea‐board of Germany, and from this fact and knowledge of locality\r\nthe thief was detected. The _Foraminifera_, small as they are, have helped\r\nto form enormous deposits, obstruct navigation in gulfs and straits, and\r\nfill up ports, as may be seen at Alexandria. In various geological strata\r\nthey are found; they exist in immense quantities in the chalk cliffs of\r\nthis country. In the Paris chalk their remains are so abundant that a\r\nblock of little more than a cubic yard has been computed to contain _three\r\nthousand millions_! “As,” says Figuier, “the chalk from these quarries has\r\nserved to build Paris, as well as the towns and villages of the\r\nsurrounding departments, it may be said that Paris, and other great\r\ncentres of population which adjoin it, are built with the shells of these\r\nmicroscopic animals.”\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: FORAMINIFERA IN A PIECE OF ROCK.]\r\n\r\nThe _Infusoria_ almost baffle the attempts of naturalists to classify\r\nthem, while their very existence would have escaped us but for the\r\ndiscovery of the microscope, “the sixth sense of man,” as Michelet happily\r\ntermed it. In the tropics, water collected at a great depth was found to\r\ncontain 116 species; in the Antarctic regions the very ice was found to\r\ncontain nearly fifty different species. The very largest kinds can hardly\r\nbe seen by the naked eye. They are generally nearly colourless, but some\r\nof them are nevertheless green, blue, red, brown, and even blackish. Some\r\nof those most commonly noted, on account of their superior size, are\r\nfurnished with hairy _cilia_, which act as paddles, while certain of them\r\nappear to be employed in conveying food to the mouth.\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: INHABITANTS OF THE BRITISH SEAS.\r\n\r\n   1.

Sea weeds.]\r\n\r\nThe _Infusoria_ reproduce their species in several ways: by a kind of\r\nbudding, like plants, by sexual reproduction, and by fission—_i.e._, the\r\nspontaneous division of the animal into two parts. “By this mode of\r\npropagation,” says Dujardin, “an Infusorian is the half of the one which\r\npreceded it, the fourth of the parent of that, the eighth of its\r\ngrandparent, and so on.” The process is represented in the accompanying\r\nfigures, A and B being the adult, C the same in course of separation, and\r\nD after completion. “This mode of generation, however,” says Figuier,\r\n“enables us to comprehend the almost miraculous multiplication of these\r\nbeings. The amount defies calculation, if we wished to be at all precise.\r\nWe may, however, arrive at a proximate estimate of the number which may be\r\nderived from a single individual by this process of fission. It has been\r\nfound that at the end of a month two _Stylonichiæ_ would have a progeny of\r\nmore than 1,048,000 individuals, and that in a lapse of forty‐two days a\r\nsingle _Paramecium_ could produce much more than 1,364,000 forms like\r\nitself.” In a year it would have the proud satisfaction of being the\r\nfather of an Infusorian nation!\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PROPAGATION OF AN INFUSORIAN BY SPONTANEOUS DIVISION.]\r\n\r\nMany of the _Infusoria_ are subject to metamorphoses, while others can\r\nremain long periods, and in a dried and torpid state, and then awake to\r\naction. One of the largest of these curious organisms, which sometimes\r\nactually attains to the size of the twelfth of an inch, is the\r\n_Kondylostoma patens_, remarkable for its voracity. It lives upon sea‐\r\nweed, and is common to every shore, from the Mediterranean to the Baltic.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: KONDYLOSTOMA PATENS (MAGNIFIED 300 TIMES).]\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the sea are, there can be no doubt, much more numerous\r\nthan those of the earth. Charles Darwin has remarked that our terrestrial\r\nforests do not maintain nearly so many living beings as do marine forests\r\nin the very bosom of the ocean. Its surface and its depths, its plains and\r\nits mountains, its valleys and precipices, teem with organisms, the like\r\nof which have no counterpart on the land, and which are only partly\r\nunderstood to‐day, although the invention and adoption of the aquarium\r\nhave greatly facilitated the study of them.\r\n\r\nMany years ago Dr. Milne‐Edwards, in a voyage round the coast of Sicily,\r\nemployed a diver’s apparatus to enable him to descend and examine the\r\nbottom of the sea. It included a metallic casque and helmet, with visor or\r\nwindow of glass fitting closely by means of water‐tight packing round the\r\nneck. It communicated with an air‐pump above by a flexible tube; the diver\r\nhad a rope attached by which he could be hoisted immediately, and a signal\r\ncord to give alarm in case of need; he wore heavy lead shoes, which gave\r\nhim steadiness and enabled him to maintain his upright position in the\r\nwater. Milne‐Edwards made the descent in several fathoms of water, and\r\nwith perfect safety. Ariel’s song had not to be applied to him:—\r\n\r\n  “Full fathoms five thy father lies;\r\n    Of his bones are coral made;\r\n  Those are pearls that were his eyes.\r\n    Nothing of him that doth fade\r\n  But doth suffer a sea change”—\r\n\r\nfor he was enabled safely and successfully to examine in the most hidden\r\nrecesses and retreats of the rocks and sea many wonderful creatures, the\r\nknowledge of which had been hitherto hidden from the scientific world.\r\n\r\nThe invention, or introduction rather, of the salt‐water aquarium enables\r\nany one nowadays to study in comfort and at leisure the habits and\r\npeculiarities of marine animals. There is a drawing extant of an aquarium\r\nbearing the date 1742. Sir John Graham Dalyell, a well‐known author, had a\r\nmodest one early in this century. A sea‐anemone taken from the sea in\r\n1828, and placed in this glass tank, was, according to his biographer,\r\nalive and well in 1873; so that M. Figuier in claiming its first\r\nsuggestion for M. Charles des Moulins is wrong. The fact is that the\r\nancients kept, not for scientific, but for gastronomic purposes, fish and\r\nmolluscs in tanks, and fed and studied their habits and needs in order to\r\nfit them for the table. These were practical aquaria.\r\n\r\nM. des Moulins, however, and, in our own country, Gosse and Warington,\r\ndeserve full credit for advocating the establishment of these beautiful\r\nsources of rational pleasure and improvement, and for showing how they\r\nmight best be kept in working order. To Des Moulins is also due the\r\nproposition that the animal life therein required the presence of\r\nvegetable life to keep it in natural condition. In the fresh‐water\r\naquarium duckweed was found to act efficiently, and a similar idea is now\r\nadopted in regard to marine plants in the salt‐water aquarium. Sea‐weeds\r\ndo not usually bear transplanting, but sea water is so impregnated with\r\nseeds or germs, that by placing a few stones or rocks in the tank a crop\r\nof marine vegetation is ensured.\r\n\r\n  “On shell or stone is dropped the embryo seed,\r\n  And quickly vegetates a vital breed.”\r\n\r\nOur own fish‐houses at the Zoological Gardens were first opened in 1853,\r\nwhile those of the French Acclimatisation Society in the Bois de Boulogne\r\nwere inaugurated in 1861. Now almost every capital possesses one on a\r\ngrand scale. That at Naples is especially noted. At the Continental\r\nfishery exhibitions, held at Amsterdam, The Hague, Boulogne, Havre,\r\nArcachon, &c., temporary aquaria always form part of the attractions.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the great aquarium at Brighton are as follows: Its area\r\nis 716 feet by 100 feet, the great tank alone containing 110,000 gallons\r\nof water, and having a plate glass front 130 feet long, through which the\r\nhabits of very large fish may be studied. The rock‐work of the tanks is\r\nartificial, and admirably adapted to give shelter to the fish and\r\ncrustaceans which disport in them. The management of a large aquarium\r\ninvolves constant care, and it is quite possible to kill its inhabitants\r\nby too frequently changing the water—by over‐kindness, in fact.\r\n\r\nThe aquaria at Brighton and the Crystal Palace are very differently\r\nconstructed and managed. At the former there is no actual circulation of\r\nwater from one tank to another, but it can, if necessary, be renewed from\r\nthe sea; the mass of the water in the reserve tanks is small as compared\r\nwith that in the show tanks, and aëration is effected by pumping air into\r\nthe tanks through tubes of large diameter. At the Crystal Palace aquarium\r\na constant circulation is maintained from one tank to another; the bulk of\r\nwater in the reservoir is five times as much as that in the show tanks,\r\nwhile aëration is accomplished by carrying a main over their entire\r\nlength, from which, under pressure, a small stream of water pours from a\r\ntap into each, breaking the surface of the water, and carrying down to the\r\nbottom of the tanks and distributing over the body of their contents\r\nmyriads of minute bubbles of air, which present an enormous oxydising\r\nsurface to the water, rendering it bright and sparkling. It does not\r\nanswer to change the water too constantly, while some obnoxious specimens,\r\nlike the flat‐fish, foul it greatly, the remedy for which is found in\r\nputting animals in who in the economy of Nature act as scavengers. Various\r\nsmall animals have to be supplied as food for the larger ones. “As the\r\nanimal life and vegetable life mutually support each other, the kind of\r\nmaterial necessary for maintaining the ‘compensating system’ must be\r\nwatchfully supplied. Mr. W. R. Hughes, of Birmingham, recommends the\r\ngrowth of sea lettuce (_Alva latissima_) in tanks, as suitable both for\r\noxygenating the water and for food for the fishes; the stock plants being\r\nintroduced in the autumn months, when they are loaded with spores.” The\r\nwriter of the article in the “Encyclopædia Britannica,” from which most of\r\nthe above is taken, ventures to hope that the aquarium may become useful\r\nin a practical sense, and may determine many questions in regard to fish\r\nlife and growth concerning which we are ignorant to‐day. “It would,” says\r\nhe, “tend to the better regulation of our fisheries and to the\r\naugmentation of our food supplies, if we knew as much about the herring or\r\nthe haddock as we do about the salmon.” It is well known that fish,\r\nvaluable as food, are too often captured at improper seasons and in a\r\nwasteful manner.\r\n\r\nPassing on to higher forms of animal life, the polyps and acalephæ of the\r\nolder authors, now classified as the _Cœlenterata_, we find creatures of a\r\nsuperior organisation to those lately under notice. Regarded generally,\r\ntheir bodies are soft and gelatinous, they possess alimentary canals and\r\ndigestive apparatus, and in nearly all cases the sexes are separate,\r\ngeneration being sometimes sexual and sometimes by gemmation or budding.\r\nThis brief introduction to the subject must be taken only in a general,\r\nnot a special sense, for there are numerous exceptions to be found among\r\nthe animals classified as Cœlenterata.\r\n\r\n“The sub‐kingdom Cœlenterata naturally divides itself into two groups—that\r\nof the _Hydrozoa_, and that of the _Actinozoa_. The fresh‐water hydra will\r\nserve as an example of the first, and the common sea‐anemone of the second\r\ngroup. The essential difference between the two is, that in the former the\r\nstomachal cavity is not separated from the general cavity of the body, and\r\nthe reproductive buds are external; while in the latter the stomachal\r\ncavity is let down, as it were, as a partially‐closed sac, into the\r\ngeneral cavity of the body, and the reproductive buds make their\r\nappearance between the walls of the general cavity of the alimentary or\r\nstomachal sac, and consequently internally. But in both there is a free\r\ncommunication between these two cavities—a communication obvious in the\r\nHydrozoa, and which may be often verified in the case of the sea‐anemones,\r\nby the young anemones making their appearance at the mouth of the parent\r\nanemone, having just escaped from the general cavity out into the\r\nalimentary cavity of its body.”\r\n\r\n                         [Illustration: MEDUSÆ.]\r\n\r\nThe class Hydrozoa includes seven orders, first and principally of which\r\nlet us speak of the Medusæ, of which the ordinary “jelly‐fish” is a\r\nfamiliar example. This great order (_Medusidæ_) is characterised by having\r\na disc, more or less convex above, resembling a mushroom or expanded\r\numbrella, the edges of the umbrella, as well as the mouth and suckers,\r\ncommonly having tentacula, or feelers, and cilia. Taken from the sea, a\r\nMedusa weighing fifty ounces will rapidly dissolve away to a few grains of\r\nsolid matter. These floating umbrellas or mushrooms, as they might be\r\ntermed, are of many forms, but they are all to be counted among the most\r\nbeautiful works of the Creator. Sometimes the animal is transparent as\r\ncrystal, sometimes opaline, now of a delicate rose or azure‐blue colour,\r\nnow yellow, now violet, and now, again, reflecting the prismatic colours.\r\n“The Medusæ are animals without much consistence, containing much water,\r\nso that we can scarcely comprehend how they resist the agitation of the\r\nwaves and the force of the currents; the waves, however, float without\r\nhurting them, the tempest scatters without killing them. When the sea\r\nretires, or they are withdrawn from their native waters, their substance\r\ndissolves, the animal is decomposed, they are reduced to nothing; if the\r\nsun is strong this disorganisation occurs in the twinkling of an eye, so\r\nto speak.” If they are touched ever so lightly while swimming, they\r\ncontract their tentacula, fold up their umbrella, and sink into the depths\r\nof the sea. At one period of the year the Medusæ are charged with numbers\r\nof minute eggs, which are suspended in festoons—crystalline roes they\r\nmight be termed—from their bodies, and which in due time become living\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\nAfter all, it is to the poets we must go if we would describe the beauties\r\nof Nature aright. Michelet, speaking of the Medusa, says:—“Why was this\r\nname, of terrible associations, given to a creature so charming? Often\r\nhave I had my attention arrested by these castaways, which we see so often\r\non the shore. They are small, about the size of my hand, but singularly\r\npretty, of soft light shades, of an opal‐white, where it lost itself as in\r\na cloud of tentacles; a crown of tender lilies—the wind had overturned it;\r\nits crown of lilac hair floated about, and the delicate umbel, that is,\r\nits body proper, was beneath; it had touched the rock—dashed against it;\r\nit was wounded, torn in its fine locks, which are also its organs of\r\nrespiration, absorption, and even of love.... The delicious creature, with\r\nits visible innocence and the iridescence of its soft colours, was left\r\nlike a gliding, trembling jelly. I paused beside it, nevertheless; I\r\nglided my hand under it, raised the motionless body cautiously, and\r\nrestored it to its natural position for swimming. Patting it in the\r\nneighbouring water, it sank to the bottom, giving no sign of life. I\r\npursued my walk along the shore, but at the end of ten minutes I returned\r\nto my Medusa. It was undulating under the wind; it had really moved\r\nitself, and was swimming about with singular grace, its hair flying round\r\nit as it swam; gently it retired from the rock, not quickly, but still it\r\nwent, and I soon saw it a long way off.”\r\n\r\nThe Medusæ are found in all seas, and usually inhabit the depths, although\r\noften seen on the surface. They voyage usually in considerable battalions,\r\nand sometimes cover miles and miles of sea. They constitute one of the\r\nprincipal supports of the whale. They are themselves singularly voracious,\r\nand snap up their prey—small molluscs, young crustaceans, and annilids—at\r\na mouthful. Their mouths are in the centre of the lower side of the\r\numbrella. They vary from a very small size to as much as a yard in\r\ndiameter, while to describe the known varieties would occupy the remainder\r\nof this volume, so numerous are they. It has been ascertained that these\r\njelly‐like creatures breathe through the skin, have a distinct circulation\r\nand some nervous sensations. Most of them produce a stinging pain when\r\nthey touch the human body, and until lately they were, adopting Cuvier’s\r\nclassification, designated _Acalephæ_, or “sea‐nettles,” in consequence.\r\n\r\n                      [Illustration: PRAYA DIPHYES.]\r\n\r\nNearly all the other Hydrozoa are marine productions, and comprise among\r\nthem numerous beautiful forms. Take, for example, the polyp known as\r\n_Praya diphyes_, a double, bell‐shaped body, with a long tail, as it were,\r\nof feelers, a floating fishing‐line; or, another delicate organisation of\r\nthe same family, _Galeolaria aurantiaca_, the orange galeolaria. Here are\r\n_two_ floating bladders with a connecting _chain of polyps_; the floats\r\naiding to support, as it were, a whole colony! But the large order\r\n_Physophoridæ_ deserves more than a mere passing notice, on account of the\r\ngraceful forms of delicate tissue and colour which are included under it.\r\n\r\nThese inhabitants of the sea are essentially swimmers, having mostly true\r\nswimming bladders, more or less numerous and of varied form; they always\r\nfloat on the surface. M. de Quatrefages, the distinguished French\r\nnaturalist, describing one of these organisms, _Apolemia contorta_, tells\r\nthe reader “to figure to himself an axis of flexible crystals, sometimes\r\nmore than a mètre (forty inches) in length, all round which are attached,\r\nby means of long peduncles or footstalks equally transparent, some\r\nhundreds of bodies, sometimes elongated, sometimes flat, and formed like\r\nthe bud of a flower. If we add to this garland of pearls of a vivid red\r\ncolour and infinity of fine filaments, varying in thickness, and giving\r\nlife and motion to all these parts, we have even now only a very slight\r\nand imperfect idea of this marvellous organism.”\r\n\r\nThe _Agalma rubra_ is thus described by Vogt, a great authority. “I know,”\r\nsays he, “nothing more graceful than this agalma, as it floats near the\r\nsurface of the waters, its long, transparent, garland‐like lines extended,\r\nand their limits distinctly indicated by bundles of a brilliant vermilion\r\nred, while the rest of the body is concealed by its very transparency; the\r\nentire organism always swims in a slightly oblique position near the\r\nsurface, but is capable of steering itself in any direction with great\r\nrapidity. I have had in my possession some of these garlands more than\r\nthree feet in length, in which the series of swimming‐bladders measured\r\nmore than four inches, so that in the great vase in which I kept them the\r\ncolumn of swimming‐bladders touched the bottom, while the aërial vesicle\r\nfloated on the surface. Immediately after its capture the columns\r\ncontracted themselves to such a point that they were scarcely perceptible,\r\nbut when left to repose in a spacious vase, all its shrunken appendages\r\ndeployed themselves round the vase in the most graceful manner imaginable,\r\nthe column of swimming‐bladders removing, immovable in their vertical\r\nposition, the float at the surface, while the different appendages soon\r\nbegan to play. The polyps, planted at intervals along the common trunk, of\r\nrose‐colour, began to agitate themselves in all directions, taking a\r\nthousand odd forms; ... but what most excited my curiosity was the\r\ncontinuous action of the fishing‐lines, retiring altogether sometimes with\r\nthe utmost precipitation. All who have witnessed these living colonies\r\nwithdraw themselves reluctantly from the strange spectacle, where each\r\npolyp seems to play the part of the fisherman who throws his line,\r\nfurnished with baited hooks, withdrawing it when he feels a nibble, and\r\nthrowing again when he discovers his disappointment.” The agalma is\r\ndescribed as well armed; its tendrils have enormous stinging powers.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: AGALMA RUBRA (THREE‐FIFTHS NATURAL SIZE).]\r\n\r\nOne family of the Physophoridæ includes the interesting creature known as\r\nthe “Portuguese man‐of‐war,” from a slight resemblance to a small vessel\r\nwith a sail up; it is also known among sailors as the sea‐bladder. The\r\nbladder is eleven or twelve inches long, and from one to three broad. Its\r\nappearance is glassy and transparent, and of a purply tint. Above the\r\nbladder is a crest, limpid and pure as crystal, and veined in purple or\r\nviolet; it is the crest which the sailors believe fulfils the office of a\r\nsail. “This bladder‐like form, with its aërial crest, is only a\r\nhydrostatic apparatus, whose office is to lighten the animal and modify\r\nits specific gravity.” From the bottom of the bladder a crowded mass of\r\norgans, most of which take the form of very slender, highly contractile,\r\nmovable threads, depend; they are often several feet, and occasionally\r\nseveral yards, long. Their stinging powers are great; these elegant\r\ncreatures are terrible antagonists. One French writer says that, “One day,\r\nwhen sailing at sea in a small boat, I perceived one of these little\r\ngalleys, and was curious to see the form of the animal; but I had scarcely\r\nseized it when all its fibres seemed to clasp my hand, covering it as with\r\nbird‐lime, and scarcely had I felt it in all its freshness (for it is very\r\ncold to the touch), when it seemed as if I had plunged my arm up to the\r\nshoulder in a cauldron of boiling water. This was accompanied with a pain\r\nso strange, that it was only with a violent effort I could restrain myself\r\nfrom crying aloud.” Another traveller,(32) while bathing and swimming in\r\nthe surf of the Antilles, was attacked by one. “I promptly detached it,”\r\nsays he, “but many of its filaments remained glued to my skin, and the\r\npain I immediately experienced was so intense that I nearly fainted.” In\r\nthis case no very serious damage resulted, but during the voyage of the\r\n_Princess Louise_ round the world a seaman was nearly killed by one.\r\nFrédol, the historian of the expedition, says that one of the officers\r\nnoticed a magnificent Physalia, which was floating near the ship. “A young\r\nsailor leaped naked into the sea to seize the animal. Swimming towards it,\r\nhe seized it; the creature surrounded the person of its assailant with its\r\nnumerous thread‐like filaments, which were nearly a yard in length; the\r\nyoung man, overwhelmed by a feeling of burning pain, cried out for\r\nassistance. He had scarcely strength to reach the vessel and get aboard\r\nagain before the pain and inflammation were so violent that brain fever\r\ndeclared itself, and great fears were entertained for his life.” It is a\r\ndisputed point whether the Physalia is poisonous or not when eaten. It was\r\na commonly‐received idea in the Antilles that they are, and that the\r\nnegroes sometimes made use of them, after being dried and powdered, to\r\npoison both men and animals. The fishermen there believe that fish which\r\nhave eaten parts of the Physalia become unfit for human food. A French\r\nphysician, M. Ricord‐Madiana, settled in Guadaloupe, made many experiments\r\nto attempt the settlement of the question. He found that ants and flies\r\npartook of them with impunity; a dog, a puppy, and a fowl, swallowed parts\r\nof them nearly with impunity, the first named only seeming to have\r\nseverely felt the sting in his mouth, but recovering perfectly soon after.\r\nThe ardent experimentalist next ate, and caused his servant to eat, the\r\nchicken which had fed on Physalia, and no inconvenience followed;\r\nsubsequently he ate twenty‐five grains of the dried and powdered animal in\r\na little bouillon, and he was unharmed. Yet there is some evidence on the\r\nother side which would indicate that on occasions, at least, it is\r\npoisonous.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the Physalia are only known in part, though they have been\r\nstudied by many scientists. Among the many denizens of the ocean, “none,”\r\nsays Gosse,(33) “take a stronger hold on the fancy of the beholder;\r\ncertainly none is more familiar than the little thing he daily marks\r\nfloating in the sun‐lit waves, as the ship glides swiftly by, which the\r\nsailor tells him is the ‘Portuguese man‐of‐war.’ Perhaps a dead calm has\r\nsettled over the sea, and he leans over the bulwarks of the ship,\r\nscrutinising this ocean‐rover at leisure, as it hastily rises and falls on\r\nthe long, sluggish heavings of the glassy surface. Then he sees that the\r\ncomparison of the stranger to a ship is a felicitous one, for at a little\r\ndistance it might well be mistaken for a child’s mimic boat, shining in\r\nall the gaudy painting in which it left the toy‐shop.\r\n\r\n“Not unfrequently one of these tiny vessels comes so close alongside that\r\nby means of the ship’s bucket, with the assistance of a smart fellow who\r\nhas jumped into the ‘chains’ with a boat‐hook, it is captured and brought\r\non deck for examination. A dozen voices are, however, lifted, warning you\r\nby no means to touch it, for well the experienced sailor knows its\r\nterrible powers of defence. It does not now appear so like a ship as when\r\nit was at a distance. It is an oblong bladder of tough membrane, varying\r\nconsiderably in shape, for no two agree in this respect; varying also in\r\nsize, from less than an inch to the size of a man’s hat. Once, on a voyage\r\nto Mobile, when rounding the Florida reef, I was nearly a whole day\r\npassing through a fleet of these little Portuguese men‐of‐war, which\r\nstudded the smooth sea as far as the eye could reach, and must have\r\nextended for many miles.” It is often to be seen on the coasts of Devon\r\nand Cornwall, brought thither by the Gulf Stream.\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: PHYSALIA ANTARCTICA.]\r\n\r\nThe Physalia is the natural enemy of the cuttle‐fish and the flying‐fish.\r\nOne an inch in length will numb and kill a fish larger than a herring.\r\n“Each tentacle, by a movement as rapid as a flash of light, or sudden as\r\nan electric shock, seizes and benumbs them, winding round their bodies as\r\na serpent winds itself round its victim.” Mr. Bennet, who accompanied the\r\nexpedition under Admiral Fitzroy as naturalist, describes them as seizing\r\ntheir prey by means of the tentacles, which are alternately contracted to\r\nhalf an inch, and then shot out with amazing velocity to several feet,\r\ndragging the helpless and entangled prey to the sucker‐like mouth and\r\nstomach‐like cavities among the tentacles. Others have observed bold\r\nlittle fish unharmed among the feelers, a proof that even a Physalia can\r\nbe good‐natured sometimes.\r\n\r\nAn attendant satellite of the Physalia is the Velella, a smaller animal of\r\nthe same family, especially abundant in tropical seas, but often seen\r\nelsewhere. It also possesses stinging powers.\r\n\r\nIt is to the moderns we must look for anything like scientific study of\r\nthese lower forms of Nature. The later poets, too, have caught the spirit\r\nof the age, and in some phases their utterances are artistically truer,\r\nand therefore truer to nature, than those of the merely _hard_ scientists.\r\nCrabbe has beautifully described this boon of our age, the study of Nature\r\naided by the light of science. It is nowadays the privilege as well as it\r\nis to the profit of any intelligent person—\r\n\r\n  “The ocean’s produce to explore.\r\n  As floating by, or rolling on the shore,\r\n  Those living jellies which the flesh inflame,\r\n  Fierce as a nettle, and from that their name:\r\n  Some in huge masses, some that you may bring\r\n  In the small compass of a lady’s ring;\r\n  Figured by hand Divine—there’s not a gem\r\n  Wrought by man’s art to be compared to them;\r\n  Soft, brilliant, tender, through the wave they glow,\r\n  And make the moonbeams brighter where they flow.\r\n  Involved in sea‐wrack, here you find a race\r\n  Which science doubting, knows not where to place.\r\n  On shell or stone is dropped the embryo seed,\r\n  And quickly vegetates a vital breed;\r\n  While thus with pleasing wonder you inspect\r\n  Treasures the vulgar in their scorn reject.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n             THE OCEAN AND ITS LIVING WONDERS (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Madrepores—Brain, Mushroom, and Plantain Coral—The Beautiful\r\n      Sea‐anemones; their Organisation and Habits; their Insatiable\r\n           Voracity—The Gorgons—Echinodermata—The Star‐fish—Sea\r\n      Urchins—Wonderful Shell and Spines—An Urchin’s Prayer—The Sea\r\n        Cucumber—The Trepang, or Holothuria—Trepang Fishing—Dumont\r\n         d’Urville’s Description—The Commerce in this Edible—The\r\n      Molluscs—The Teredo, or Ship‐worm—Their Ravages on the Holland\r\n     Coast—The Retiring Razor‐fish—The Edible Mussel—History of their\r\n      Cultivation in France—The Bouchots—Occasional Danger of Eating\r\n            Mussels—The Prince of Bivalves—The Oyster and its\r\n     Organisation—Difference in Size—American Oysters—High Priced in\r\n     some Cities—Quantity Consumed in London—Courteous Exchange—Roman\r\n          Estimation of them—The “Breedy Creatures” brought from\r\n     Britain—Vitellius and his Hundred Dozen—A Sell: Poor Tyacke—The\r\n          First Man who Ate an Oyster—The Fisheries—Destructive\r\n     Dredging—Lake Fusaro and the Oyster Parks—Scientific Cultivation\r\n    in France—Success and Profits—The Whitstable and other Beds—System\r\n                                 pursued.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the interesting and comparatively familiar forms of ocean’s\r\ntreasures must be counted the Madrepores, often regarded as corals, but\r\nquite distinct as a scientific group from the precious coral of commerce.\r\nThe Madreporidæ are very numerous, and are formed by colonies of polyps.\r\nThe poet has truly described them:—\r\n\r\n  “I saw the living pile ascend\r\n  The mausoleum of its architects,\r\n  Still dying upward as their labour closed:\r\n  Slime the material, but the slime was turned\r\n  To adamant by their petrific touch.”\r\n\r\nThe polyps of the madrepores resemble flowers when their upper disc is\r\nexpanded and their feelers are out in the water. When contracted, they are\r\nconcealed from sight in the calcareous cells, which have grown with\r\nthemselves, and form part of the madrepora. These beautiful and curious\r\nnatural productions assume many distinct forms. Some of them are\r\narborescent, as in _Stylaster flabelliformis_, which puts forth a perfect\r\nforest of trunks and branches. Others are star‐like in shape; many are\r\nmore or less cylindrical and oval, as in the well‐known “Brain coral”\r\n(_Meandrina cerebriformis_). Another genus is entitled _Fungia_, from a\r\nsupposed resemblance to the mushroom, there being this difference between\r\nterrestrial and marine mushrooms—that the former have leaflets below, and\r\nthe latter have them above. One of the most pleasing forms is found in the\r\nPlantain Madrepore, where the polyps are arranged in tufts.\r\n\r\n                       [Illustration: MADREPORES.]\r\n\r\nThe Sea‐anemones (_Actinidæ_) will be now, thanks to the popularity of the\r\naquarium, tolerably familiar to most readers. Although undoubtedly animal,\r\nthey much more resemble flowers. They are to be found of the most\r\nbrilliant colours and graceful forms.\r\n\r\nThe body of the Sea‐anemone is “cylindrical in form, terminating beneath\r\nin a muscular disc, which is generally large and distinct, enabling them\r\nto cling vigorously to foreign bodies. It terminates above in an upper\r\ndisc, bearing many rows of tentacles, which differ from each other only in\r\ntheir size. These tentacles are sometimes decorated with brilliant\r\ncolours, forming a species of collar, consisting of contractile and\r\nsometimes retractile tubes, pierced at their points with an orifice,\r\nwhence issue jets of water, which are ejected at the will of the animal.\r\nArranged in circles, they are distributed with perfect regularity round a\r\ncentral mouth. These are their arms.” The stomach of the sea‐anemone is\r\nboth the seat of digestion and of reproduction. The young are actually\r\nejected from the mouth with the rejecta of their food. “The daisy‐like\r\nanemones in the Zoological Gardens of Paris,” Frédol tells us, “frequently\r\nthrow up young ones, which are dispersed, and attach themselves to various\r\nparts of the aquarium, and finally become miniature anemones exactly like\r\nthe parent. An actinia, which had taken a very copious repast, ejected a\r\nportion of it about twenty‐four hours later, and in the middle of the\r\nejected food were found thirty‐eight young individuals.” According to one\r\nauthor, an accouchement is here a fit of indigestion! Sea‐anemones may be\r\nmutilated, cut limb from limb, or torn to pieces, and each piece will\r\nbecome a new anemone in the end. “They adhere,” says Dr. Johnson, “to\r\nrocks, shells, and other extraneous bodies by means of a glutinous\r\nsecretion from their enlarged base, but they can leave their hold and\r\nremove to another station whensoever it pleases them, either by gliding\r\nalong with a slow and almost imperceptible movement (half an inch in five\r\nminutes), as is their usual method, or by reversing the body and using the\r\ntentacula for the purpose of feet, as Reaumur asserts, and as I have once\r\nwitnessed; or, lastly, inflating the body with water, so as to render it\r\nmore buoyant, they detach themselves, and are driven to a distance by the\r\nrandom motion of the waves. They feed on shrimps, small crabs, whelks, and\r\non very many species of shelled mollusca, and probably on all animals\r\nbrought within their reach whose strength or agility is insufficient to\r\nextricate them from the grasp of their numerous tentacula.... The size of\r\nthe prey is frequently in unseemly disproportion to the preyer, being\r\noften equal in bulk to itself. I had once brought me a specimen of\r\n_Actinia crassicornis_ that might have been originally two inches in\r\ndiameter, which had somehow contrived to swallow a valve of _Pecten\r\nmaximus_ of the size of an ordinary saucer. The shell, fixed within the\r\nstomach, was so placed as to divide it completely into two halves, so that\r\nthe body, stretched tensely over, had become thin and flattened like a\r\npancake. All communication between the inferior portion of the stomach and\r\nthe mouth was, of course, prevented; yet, instead of emaciating and dying\r\nof atrophy, the animal had availed itself of what undoubtedly had been a\r\nvery untoward accident to increase its enjoyment and its chance of double\r\nfare. A new mouth, furnished with two rows of numerous tentacula, was\r\nopened up on what had been the base, and led to the under stomach; the\r\nindividual had, indeed, become a sort of Siamese Twin, but with greater\r\nintimacy and extent in its unions.” The Actinia are at once gluttonous and\r\nvoracious. They seize even mussels and crabs, and when they want to eject\r\nthe hardest parts of the latter can turn their stomachs inside out, as one\r\nmight turn out one’s pocket! Their tentacles can act on the offensive; the\r\nhand of the man who has touched them becomes inflamed, and small fish are\r\nliterally killed by contact with them.\r\n\r\nIn Provence, Italy, and Greece, some varieties are used for food, the\r\nGreen Actinia being in special repute.\r\n\r\n                      [Illustration: SEA‐ANEMONES.\r\n1. _Actinoloba dianthus_. 2. _Cereus gemmaceus_. 3. _Actinia bicolor_. 4.\r\n   _Sagartia viduata_. 5. _Cereus papillossus_. 6. _Actinia picta_. 7.\r\n     _Actinia equina_. 8. _Sagartia rosea_. 9. _Sagartia coccinea_.]\r\n\r\nThe Gorgons are interesting curiosities of the coral type; some are\r\nscarcely the twelfth of an inch in height, while others attain a height of\r\nseveral feet. The beautiful Fan Gorgon, which is often eighteen or more\r\ninches high, is so called on account of its form, and there are other very\r\nbeautiful examples of arborescent gorgons. Their organism is double; the\r\none external, sometimes gelatinous; sometimes, on the contrary, fleshy and\r\ncretaceous. It is animated with life.\r\n\r\nA vast natural group is that of the _Echinodermata_, which includes five\r\norders, or families, embracing among them the star‐fish, the sea‐eggs, or\r\nsea‐urchins, and the sea‐cucumbers, or “sea‐slugs” (Holothurias), the\r\nlatter of which are important items in the food of many Asiatics. The\r\ngeneric term Echinodermata signifies an animal bristling with spines, but\r\nthe group includes many to whom it could not be applied.\r\n\r\nThe Star‐fish (_Asterias_) is met in almost every sea, and in all\r\nlatitudes, although more richly varied in tropical seas. They vary in\r\ncolour from a yellowish‐grey to orange, red, or violet. The body of the\r\nasterias is a most curious organisation, having sometimes as many as\r\n11,000 juxta‐imposed pieces, while it possesses spines and tubercles.\r\nObserve one stranded on the shore, and it may appear destitute of\r\nlocomotive powers. But this is not so, for they can slowly creep over\r\nsmall spaces, and even up the vertical sides of rocks. Frédol says:—“If an\r\nasterias is turned upon its back, it will at first remain immovable, with\r\nits feet shut up. Soon, however, out come the feet like so many little\r\nfeelers; it moves them backward and forward, as if feeling for the ground;\r\nit soon inclines them towards the bottom of the vase, and fixes them one\r\nafter the other. When it has a sufficient number attached, the animal\r\nturns itself round. It is not impossible, whilst walking on the sea‐shore,\r\nto have the pleasure of seeing one of these star‐fishes walking upon the\r\nsand,” although they are very commonly left dead there.\r\n\r\nThe star‐fish’s mouth is on its lower side, and almost directly abuts on\r\nits stomach. It is a voracious feeder, and will even attack molluscs.\r\nFormerly it was believed that the animal would open an oyster with one of\r\nits rays, or legs, but this was unlikely, as the oyster might be likely\r\nenough to have the best of it in such a case by shutting his shells on the\r\nintruder. It is now pretty well understood that it injects an acrid poison\r\ninto the oyster’s shell, which obliges it to open.\r\n\r\n                        [Illustration: STAR‐FISH.]\r\n\r\nThe “Urchins” seem to owe their name to Aristotle, and their spiny\r\ncovering and armature have in all ages attracted the attention of\r\nnaturalists. Some of them have 3,000 or 4,000 prickles, and their\r\norganisation is really wonderful. They are enclosed in a globular hollow\r\nbox, which grows with their growth. Gosse explains how. The box can never\r\nbe cast off, and it is obvious that the deposits made from inside would\r\nonly narrow the space, which really requires to be enlarged. “The growing\r\nanimal feels its tissues swelling day by day, by the assimilation of food.\r\nIts cry is ‘Give me space! a larger house, or I die!’ How is this problem\r\nsolved? Ah! there is no difficulty. The inexhaustible wisdom of the\r\nCreator has a beautiful contrivance for the emergency. The box is not made\r\nin one piece, nor in ten, nor a hundred. Six hundred distinct pieces go to\r\nmake up the hollow case, all accurately fitted together, so that the\r\nperfect symmetry of outline remains unbroken; and yet, thin as their\r\nsubstance is, they retain their relative positions with unchanging\r\nexactness, and the slight brittle box retains all requisite strength and\r\nfirmness, for each of these pieces is enveloped by a layer of living\r\nflesh; a vascular tissue passes up between the joints, where one meets\r\nanother, and spreads itself over the whole exterior surface.” Their spines\r\nare instruments of defence and of locomotion; each has several muscles to\r\nwork it.\r\n\r\nThe poet‐scientist, Michelet, has beautifully painted the animal’s nature,\r\nand makes it describe itself as follows. “I am born,” says the unobtrusive\r\nEchinoderm, “without ambition; I ask for none of the brilliant gifts\r\npossessed by those gentlemen the molluscs. I would neither make mother‐of‐\r\npearl nor pearls; I have no wish for brilliant colours, a luxury which\r\nwould point me out; still less do I desire the grace of your giddy\r\nmedusas, the waving charm of whose flaming locks attracts observation and\r\nexposes one to shipwreck. Oh, mother! I wish for one thing only, _to\r\nbe_—to be without these exterior and compromising appendages; to be\r\nthickset, strong, and round, for that is the shape in which I should be\r\nthe least exposed; in short, to be a centralised being. I have very little\r\ninstinct for travel. To roll sometimes from the surface to the bottom of\r\nthe sea is enough of travel for me. Glued firmly to my rock, I could there\r\nsolve the problem, the solution of which your favourite, man, seeks for in\r\nvain—that of safety. To strictly exclude enemies and admit all friends,\r\nespecially water, air, and light, would, I know, cost me some labour and\r\nconstant effort. Covered with movable spines, enemies will avoid me. Now,\r\nbristling like a bear, they call me an urchin.”(34)\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: URCHINS IN A ROCK.]\r\n\r\nThe term “sea‐cucumber” accurately describes the shape of the Holothuria,\r\nwhich is in general terms a worm‐like cylinder, varying as much as from an\r\ninch or two to thirty, and, in exceptional cases, forty inches in length.\r\nThe skin of the animal is usually thick and leathery; it is crowned by a\r\nmouth with a fringe of tentacula, which expand like a flower when it is\r\nunmolested. They particularly avoid the glare of light. One large eatable\r\nspecies is common in the Mediterranean, and is used for food in Naples and\r\nelsewhere. But it is in the Indian, Malayan, and Chinese seas that the\r\n_Holothuria edulis_, known there as the _trepang_, is an important adjunct\r\nto the food of the natives. Thousands of junks are employed in the trepang\r\nfisheries. The Malay fisherman will harpoon them with a long bamboo\r\nterminating in a sharp hook at a distance of thirty yards. In four or five\r\nfathoms of water native divers are employed, who seize them in their\r\nhands, and will bring up several at a time. They are then boiled, and\r\nflattened with stones; after which process they are spread out on bamboo\r\nmats to dry, first in the sun and afterwards by smoking. They are then put\r\nin sacks and shipped principally to Chinese ports, where they are\r\nconsidered a luxury.\r\n\r\nThe great French navigator, Dumont d’Urville, witnessed the processes\r\nemployed while in Raffles Bay. An hour after the arrival of four prows all\r\nthe men were at work ashore cooking them in boilers placed over roughly‐\r\nconstructed stone furnaces, after which they were dried on hurdled roofs.\r\nCaptain d’Urville went on board one of the Malay vessels, where he was\r\nreceived with cordiality by the padrone, or captain. “He,” says that\r\nnavigator, “showed us over his little ship. The keel appeared to us\r\nsufficiently solid; even the lines did not want elegance; but great\r\ndisorder seemed to reign in the stowage department. From a kind of bridge,\r\nformed by hurdles of bamboos and junk, we saw the cabin, which looked like\r\na poultry house: bags of rice, packets and boxes were huddled together.\r\nBelow was the store of water, of cured trepang, and the sailors’ berths.\r\nEach boat was furnished with two rudders, one at each end, which lifted\r\nitself when the boat touched the bottom. The craft was furnished with two\r\nmasts, without shrouds, which could be lowered on to the bridge at will by\r\nmeans of a hinge; they carry the ordinary sail; the anchors are of wood,\r\nfor iron is rarely used by the Malays; their cables are made of rattan\r\nfibre; the crew of each bark consists of about thirty‐seven, each shore\r\nboat having a crew of six men. At the moment of our visit they were all\r\noccupied in fishing operations, some of them being anchored very near to\r\nus. Seven or eight of their number, nearly naked, were diving for trepang;\r\nthe padrone alone was unoccupied. An ardent sun darted its rays upon their\r\nheads without appearing to incommode them, an exposure which no European\r\ncould hold up under. It was near mid‐day, and the moment, as our Malay\r\ncaptain assured us, most favourable for the fishing. In fact, we saw that\r\neach diver returned to the surface with at least one animal, and sometimes\r\ntwo, in his hands. It appears that the higher the sun is above the\r\nhorizon, the more easily is the creature distinguished at the bottom. The\r\ndivers were so rapid in their movements that they scarcely touched the\r\nboat, into which they threw the animals before they dived again. When the\r\nboat was filled with them, it proceeded to the shore, and its place was\r\nsupplied by an empty one.” The Holothuria taken there were five to six\r\ninches long. D’Urville tasted it when prepared, and says that it resembled\r\nlobster. His men, however, took more kindly to it than did he.\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: SEA‐CUCUMBER (_Holothuria tubulosa_).]\r\n\r\nWe must now examine a most important class of pulpy animals, the Mollusca,\r\nof which the bivalve molluscs are by far the most important to man. In\r\nconsequence of their very softness and delicacy, Nature has provided them\r\nwith a shell coat of calcareous mail.\r\n\r\nThe sub‐class _Acephala_, are as their names indicate, _headless_\r\nmolluscs, and though sometimes _partially_ naked, are usually very well\r\nprotected by shells. When it is known that there are over 4,000 species of\r\nbivalve molluscs, the impossibility of describing more than a few typical\r\nand prominent examples will be seen.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Teredo_ consists of marine worm‐like animals having a special\r\nand irresistible inclination for boring wood, whatever its hardness. Ships\r\nhave been thus silently and secretly undermined, till the planks have been\r\neither like sponges or have crumbled into dust under the very feet of\r\ntheir crews. The holes bored by these imperceptible miners riddle the\r\nentire interior of a piece of wood, without any external indication of\r\ntheir ravages. Piles and piers have been utterly ruined, and vessels have\r\nsometimes gone to the bottom through them. At the beginning of the last\r\ncentury half the coast of Holland was threatened with inundation and\r\npractical annihilation because the piles which support its dykes were\r\nattacked by the teredo, and hundreds of thousands of pounds damage was\r\ndone by this wretched worm. It has been now discovered that the worm has a\r\ngreat antipathy to oxide of iron, and wood impregnated with it is secure\r\nfrom its ravages. Other animals of the same group are capable of boring\r\neven rock.\r\n\r\nAnother important bivalve is the well known Solen or “razor‐fish,”\r\nvarieties of which are common all over the globe. “These molluscs,” says\r\nFiguier, “live with their shells buried vertically in the sand, a short\r\ndistance from the shore; the hole which they have hollowed, and which they\r\nnever quit, sometimes attains as much as two yards in depth; by means of\r\ntheir foot, which is large, conical, swollen in the middle and pointed at\r\nits extremity, they raise themselves with great agility to the entrance of\r\ntheir burrow. They bury themselves rapidly, and disappear on the slightest\r\napproach of danger.\r\n\r\n“When the sea retires, the presence of the Solen is indicated by a small\r\norifice in the sand, whence escape at intervals bubbles of air. In order\r\nto attract them to the surface, the fishermen throw into the hole a pinch\r\nof salt; the sand immediately becomes stirred, and the animal presents\r\nitself just above the point of its shell. It must be seized at once, for\r\nit disappears again very quickly, and no renewed efforts will bring it to\r\nthe surface a second time. Its retreat is commonly cut short by a knife\r\nbeing passed below it; for it burrows into the ground with such velocity\r\nthat it is difficult to capture it with the hand alone. The fish itself is\r\na kind of marine worm.”\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: THE RAZOR FISH (_Solen ensis_).]\r\n\r\nBut of the Acephalous Mollusca none are more important to man than the\r\nmussel and oyster, the pearl‐bearing varieties of which latter have been\r\nalready considered. Both are familiar to every reader.\r\n\r\nThe _Mytilus edulis_, the edible mussel of commerce, the “poor man’s\r\noyster,” is provided with a byssus, a bundle of hairs or threads, by which\r\nit can anchor to the rock. In its natural state it is much less fitted for\r\nhuman food than when cultivated. Their civilisation, as it might be\r\ntermed, dates back to the year 1236, when the master of a barque, an\r\nIrishman named Walton, was wrecked in the bay or creek of Aiguillon, a few\r\nmiles distant from Rochelle. The exile at first supported himself by\r\nhunting sea‐fowl in the neighbouring marshes, where he also soon began,\r\nbeing an observant man, to notice certain peculiarities of mussel life.\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: THE MUSSEL (_Mytilus edulis_).]\r\n\r\nWalton remarked that many of the mussels attached themselves by preference\r\nto that part of posts or stones a little _above_ the mud of the marshes,\r\nand that those so situated soon became plumper and fatter, and more\r\nsuitable for edible purposes, than those buried _in_ the mud. He soon saw\r\nthe possibilities of a new branch of industry. “The practices he\r\nintroduced,” wrote a distinguished French writer, long ago, “were so\r\nhappily adapted to the requirements of the new industry, that, after six\r\ncenturies, they are still the rules by which the rich patrimony he created\r\nfor a numerous population is governed.” He placed long rows of twelve‐foot\r\nposts, about six feet high out of the watery mud, and a yard apart, each\r\npair of which always formed a letter V; in other words, a number of them\r\nradiated from a common centre. The posts were interlaced with a basket‐\r\nwork of branches, so as to form continuous hurdles; these are now termed\r\n_bouchots_. He also had isolated posts, and one of his great ideas was, as\r\nin oyster culture to‐day, to arrest the spat, which would otherwise have\r\nwashed away to sea with the tide, and been lost. “At the present time\r\nthese lines of hurdles form a perfect little forest at Aiguillon; there\r\nare about a quarter of a million piles alone. In July the _bouchotiers_,\r\nas the men employed in this culture are termed, launch their punts, and\r\nproceeding to the marshes, detach with a hook the thickly agglomerated\r\nmasses of young mussels from the piles, which they gather in baskets and\r\ntake to the bouchots, which form a perfect hedge of fascines and branches,\r\nof different heights. Each stage receives the mollusc suitable to it. In\r\nthe first stage of its existence the mussel cannot endure exposure to the\r\nair, and remains constantly under water, except at the period of spring\r\ntides. These are gathered in sacks made of old matting, or suspended in\r\ninterstices of the basket‐work. The mussels are advanced stage after stage\r\nuntil they reach the highest bouchots, which remain out of water at all\r\ntides.” The whole bay yielded close on half a million pounds sterling some\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\n“While,” says Figuier, “commending the mussel as an important article of\r\nfood, we must not conceal the fact that it has produced in certain persons\r\nvery grave effects, showing that for them its flesh has the effects of\r\npoison. The symptoms, commonly observed two or three hours after the\r\nrepast, are weakness or torpor, constriction of the throat and swelling of\r\nthe head, accompanied by great thirst, nausea, frequent vomitings, and\r\neruptions of the skin and severe itching.\r\n\r\n“The cause of these attacks is not very well ascertained; they have in\r\nturn been ascribed to the presence of the coppery pyrites in the\r\nneighbourhood of the mussel; to certain small crabs which lodge themselves\r\nas parasites in the shell of the mussel; to the spawn of star‐fish or\r\nmedusæ that the mussel may have swallowed. But, probably the true cause of\r\nthis kind of poisoning is found in the predisposition of individuals. The\r\nremedy is very simple; an emetic, accompanied by drinking plentifully of\r\nslightly acidulated beverage.” They are eaten very freely in most parts of\r\nthe seaboard of the United States, and the present writer has eaten them\r\nconstantly, boiled, stewed with tomatoes, &c., and in soup, without the\r\nslightest bad effects.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ISOLATED PILES COVERED WITH THE SPAWN OF MUSSELS.]\r\n\r\n_The_ bivalve _par excellence_ must always be _Ostrea edulis_, the common\r\noyster. This mollusc, which some might be inclined to place low in the\r\nscale of nature, has really a complex and delicate organisation. It has a\r\nmouth, heart, stomach, liver, and intestines; its blood is colourless, but\r\nit has a true circulation; and it breathes under water, as do fishes.\r\n“Having no head,” says Figuier, “the oyster can have no brain; the nerves\r\noriginate near the mouth, where a great ganglion is visible, whence issue\r\na pair of nerves which distribute themselves in the regions of the stomach\r\nand liver, terminating in a second ganglion, situated behind the liver.\r\nThe first nervous branch distributes its sensibility to the mouth and\r\ntentacles; the second, to the respiratory branchiæ. With organs of the\r\nsenses oysters are unprovided. Condemned to a sedentary life, riveted to a\r\nrock, where they have been rooted, as it were, in their infancy, they\r\nneither see nor hear; touch appears to be their only sense, and that is\r\nplaced in the labial tentacles of the mouth.” The oyster may carry\r\nhundreds of thousands of eggs—some say as many as 2,000,000; it ejects\r\nthem after a process of incubation. Nothing is more curious than to\r\nwitness a bank of oysters in the spawning season, which is usually from\r\nthe month of June to the end of September.(35) Every adult—for the oyster\r\nis sexless—throws forth a living dust, a perfect cloud of embryotic life.\r\nThe spat is soon scattered far and wide, and unless the young oyster\r\nattach itself to some solid body, it falls a victim to other marine\r\nanimals. Microscopic in size when it leaves the parent, it is at the end\r\nof a month about the size of a large pea; in a year it may be an inch and\r\na half in diameter; in three it is getting on to a quite respectable size,\r\nand after a short course in the oyster park it is ready for the table.(36)\r\n\r\nOysters are of all sizes, and there are some so large that they require to\r\nbe carved. In New York, the paradise of oyster‐eaters, they range from the\r\nsize of a half‐crown to five or six inches long. The shores of Long\r\nIsland, a distance round of 115 miles, are one continuous oyster‐field,\r\nwhile the one State of Virginia is said to possess nearly 2,000,000 acres\r\nof oyster‐beds. The Americans are great lovers of the bivalve, which is\r\nprobably one of the most wholesome forms of _easy_ nourishment which can\r\npossibly be taken. In a stew with milk, and a little oatmeal, or as soup,\r\nthey are especially good for invalids, and when one can take nothing else,\r\nhe can usually relish oysters. And, as all gastronomers know, they rather\r\nincrease than diminish appetite; hence the modern French practice of\r\ntaking half a dozen _before_ the soup is served. “There is no alimentary\r\nsubstance,” says a French writer, “not even excepting bread, which does\r\nnot produce indigestion under given circumstances; but oysters never....\r\nWe may eat them to‐day, to‐morrow, eat them always and in profusion,\r\nwithout fear of indigestion.” The few who cannot eat them, and there _are_\r\nsuch, are really to be commiserated. How highly they are esteemed in some\r\ncountries is shown by the fact that some years ago they cost in St.\r\nPetersburg a paper rouble, or about a shilling _each_; in Stockholm,\r\nfivepence each. In England only two or three years ago they had risen to\r\nnearly four‐fifths of the latter price; but now, thanks to the extensive\r\ncultivation, and to the importation of excellent American oysters on a\r\nlarge scale, they are within the reach of all.\r\n\r\nOf the quantity of oysters consumed in London alone who can give even an\r\napproximate guess? Fancy, if you can, also, that curiously courteous\r\nexchange which goes on every Christmas between our oyster‐eating country\r\ncousins and our turkey and goose loving Londoners. The turkey, the brace\r\nof pheasants or hares, has arrived. “Such a present,” says the author of\r\n“The Oyster,” “is promptly repaid by a fine cod packed in ice, and two\r\nbarrels of oysters. How sweet are these when eaten at a country home, and\r\nopened by yourselves, the barrel being paraded on the table with its head\r\nknocked out, and with the whitest of napkins round it. * * * How sweet it\r\nis, too, to open some of the dear natives for your pretty cousin, and to\r\nsee her open her sweet little mouth about as wide as Lesbia’s sparrow did\r\nfor his lump of—not sugar, it was not then invented—but lump of honey! How\r\nsweet it is, after the young lady has swallowed her half‐dozen, to help\r\nyourself! The oyster never tastes sweeter than when thus operated on by\r\nyourself, so that you do not ‘job’ the knife into your hand!”\r\n\r\nThe Greeks have not said much in praise of oysters, but then they regarded\r\nBritain much as we now do Greenland. The Romans, however, highly\r\nappreciated them. Horace, Martial, and Juvenal, Cicero, Seneca, and Pliny,\r\nhave all enlarged upon the various qualities of the oyster; and it was to\r\nSergius Orata that we owe the introduction of oyster‐beds, for he it was\r\nthat invented the layers or stews for oysters at Baia. “That was in the\r\ndays when luxury was rampant, and when men of great wealth, like Licinius\r\nCrassus, the leviathan slave‐merchant, rose to the highest honours; for\r\nthis dealer in human flesh in the boasted land of liberty served the\r\noffice of consul along with Pompey the Great, and on one occasion required\r\nno less than 10,000 tables to accommodate all his guests. How many barrels\r\nof oysters were eaten at that celebrated dinner, the ‘Ephemerides’—as\r\nPlutarch calls _The Times_ and _Morning Post_ of that day—have omitted to\r\nstate; but as oysters then took the place that turtle soup now does at our\r\ngreat City feeds, imagination may busy itself as it likes with the\r\ncalculation. All we know is, that oysters then fetched very long prices at\r\nRome, as the author of the ‘Tabella Ciberia’ has not failed to tell us;\r\nand then, as now, the high price of any luxury of the table was sure to\r\nmake a liberal supply of it necessary when a man like Crassus entertained\r\nhalf the city as his guests, to rivet his popularity.\r\n\r\n“But the Romans had a weakness for the ‘breedy creatures’ as our dear old\r\nfriend Christopher North calls them in his inimitable ‘Noctes.’ In the\r\ntime of Nero, some sixty years later, the consumption of oysters in the\r\n‘Imperial City’ was nearly as great as it now is in the ‘World’s\r\nMetropolis;’ and there is a statement, which I remember to have read\r\nsomewhere, that during the reign of Domitian, the last of the twelve\r\nCæsars, a greater number of millions of bushels were annually consumed at\r\nRome than I should care to swear to. These oysters, however, were but\r\nMediterranean produce—the small fry of Circe, and the smaller Lucrinians;\r\nand this unreasonable demand upon them quite exhausted the beds in that\r\ngreat fly‐catcher’s reign; and it was not till under the wise\r\nadministration of Agricola in Britain, when the Romans got their far‐famed\r\nRutupians from the shores of Kent, from Richborough, and the Reculvers—the\r\n_Rutupi Portus_ of the ‘Itinerary’ of which the latter, the Regulbium,\r\nnear Whitstable, in the mouth of the Thames, was the northern\r\nboundary–that Juvenal praised them as he does; and he was right; for in\r\nthe whole world there are no oysters like them; and of all the ‘breedy\r\ncreatures’ that glide, or have ever glided, down the throats of the human\r\nrace, our ‘natives’ are probably the most delectable.” The Roman emperors\r\nlater on never failed to have British oysters at their banquets.\r\n\r\nVitellius ate oysters four times daily, and at each meal is said to have\r\ngot through 1,200 of his own natives! Seneca, who praised the charms of\r\npoverty, ate several hundred a week. Horace is enthusiastic about them; he\r\nnotes the people who first provided him with them, and the name of the\r\ngourmet who at the first _bite_(37) was able to tell whence the particular\r\nbreed came.\r\n\r\n  “When I but see the oyster’s shell,\r\n  I look and recognise the river, marsh, or mud\r\n  Where it was raised.”\r\n\r\nThe shell is often an indication of the particular locality whence it is\r\nbrought, and no doubt the modern oyster dealer, if not the ordinary eater,\r\ncan always tell rightly. For although London swears by her Milton and\r\nColchester “natives,” Edinburgh has her Pandores and Aberdours, and Dublin\r\nher Carlingfords and “Powldoodies of Burran.”\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: OYSTERS (_Ostrea edulis_).\r\nA, Oysters of twelve to fifteen months; B, five or six months; C, three or\r\n   four months; D, one to two months; and E, twenty days after birth.]\r\n\r\n“There is one little spot,” says the author of the entertaining but\r\nveracious little work quoted before, “on the shores of Cornwall which I\r\ncannot pass over, because from it came one of the colonies on the banks of\r\nthe Thames from which the Whitstable boats still draw their annual supply.\r\nInto Mount’s Bay, the Helford River, upon which stands the little town of\r\nHelstone, empties itself, opposite Mount St. Michael’s, into the sea, and\r\nin the estuary of that little river, a person of the name of Tyacke,\r\nwithin the memory of the ‘oldest inhabitant,’ rented certain oyster‐beds,\r\nfamous among Cornish gourmets for a breed of oysters, which, it is said,\r\nthe Phœnicians, ‘a long time ago,’ had discovered to be infinitely\r\npreferable to the watery things they got at home. These Helford oysters\r\nare regularly brought to London.... Determined to make his venture, Tyacke\r\nloaded a fishing‐smack with the best produce of his beds, and coasted\r\nalong the southern shores, till passing round the Isle of Thanet he found\r\nhimself in the mouth of the Thames. Little did the elated oyster‐dredger\r\nthink that mouth would swallow up the whole of his cargo; but so it came\r\nto pass. It had long been evident to those on board that oysters which\r\ntravel, no less than men, must have rations allowed on the voyage, if they\r\nare to do credit to the land of their birth. Now the voyage had been long\r\nand tedious, and the oysters had not been fed; so Tyacke got into his\r\nboat, and obtained an interview with the owner of the spot when he reached\r\nthe shore. He asked permission to lay down his oysters, and feed them.\r\nThis was granted, and after a few days the spores of _ulva latissima_ and\r\n_enteromorpha_, and of the host of delicate fibrous plants which there\r\nabound, and all of which are the oyster’s delight, made the whole green\r\nand fat, and in the finest condition for re‐shipment. Four days, it is\r\nsaid, will suffice to make a lean oyster, on such a diet, both green and\r\nplump; and Tyacke, joyful at the improvement which he daily witnessed, let\r\nhis stock feed on for a week. It was towards evening that he bethought\r\nhimself, as the tide was out, that if he meant to reach Billingsgate by\r\nthe next morning it would be wise to re‐ship his oysters before turning in\r\nfor the night. The boat was lowered; but, as he attempted to land, he was\r\nwarned off by the owner of the soil, who stood there with several fierce‐\r\nlooking fellows, armed with cutlasses and fowling‐pieces, evidently\r\nanticipating the Cornishman’s intention, and determined to frustrate it at\r\nall hazards.\r\n\r\n“‘What do you want here?’ he asked of Tyacke.\r\n\r\n“‘The oysters I put down to feed,’ was the reply; ‘they were placed there\r\nby your permission, and now I am anxious to re‐ship them, to be in time\r\nfor to‐morrow’s market.’\r\n\r\n“‘True,’ replied the Kentishman, ‘I gave you leave to lay down the oysters\r\nand feed them, but not a word was said about re‐shipping them. Where they\r\nare, there they stay; and if you persist in trespassing, I shall know what\r\nto do.’\r\n\r\n“Poor Tyacke found himself much in the predicament of many a flat who has\r\nbeen picked up by a sharp. A century ago law was not justice, nor justice\r\nlaw. Perhaps it may not be so even now, and the story of the lawyer who\r\nate the oyster in dispute, and gave each of the disputants a shell, may\r\nhold as good in our day as it did in that when the author of the ‘Beggars’\r\nOpera’ put it into verse.”\r\n\r\nIt is said that the oyster, a delicate, refined animal, is particularly\r\nfond of music. One of the oyster’s historians says that an old ballad is\r\nstill sung by many a hardy seaman as he trolls his dredging nets:—\r\n\r\n  “The herring loves the merry moonlight,\r\n    The mackerel loves the wind,\r\n  But the oyster loves the dredger’s song,\r\n    For he comes of a gentle kind.”\r\n\r\nShakspere, it may be remembered, alludes to “an oyster crossed in love.”\r\n\r\nRaised out of his native waters, the oyster makes the voyage to the first\r\nstation in his destined travels in company with his kind, and if it\r\noccupies a long time, is attentively supplied with refreshing sea‐water.\r\nIf taken proper care of, he arrives at the wharf as lively as when first\r\ntaken from his native element. Witness the excellent American “Blue\r\nPoints,” now commonly sold in England. Arrived in port, the oyster too\r\noften, however, first becomes sensible of the miseries of slavery, for\r\nhere he is shovelled into carts and barrows, and tumbled into sacks, and\r\nhe may consider himself greatly fortunate if he gets a drink of salted,\r\nnot sea, water.\r\n\r\nAn old adage tells us that “He was a bold man who first ate an oyster.”\r\nMr. Bertram tells us how the discovery was made. “Once upon a time a man\r\nof melancholy mood was walking by the shores of a picturesque estuary, and\r\nlistening to the murmur of the ‘sad sea waves’—or, as Mr. Disraeli would\r\nsay, of ‘the melancholy main’—when he espied a very old and ugly oyster‐\r\nshell, all coated over with parasites and weeds. Its appearance was so\r\nunprepossessing that he kicked it aside with his foot; whereupon the\r\nmollusc, astonished at receiving such rude treatment on its own domain,\r\ngaped wide with indignation, preparatory to closing its bivalve still more\r\nclosely. Seeing the beautiful cream‐coloured layers that shone within the\r\nshelly covering, and fancying that the interior of the shell was probably\r\ncurious or beautiful, he lifted up the aged ‘native’ for further\r\nexamination, inserting his finger and thumb within the valves. The irate\r\nmollusc, thinking, no doubt, that this was intended as a further insult,\r\nsnapped its nacreous portcullis close down upon his finger, causing him\r\nconsiderable pain. After relieving his wounded digit, our inquisitive\r\ngentleman very naturally put it in his mouth. ‘Delightful!’ he exclaimed,\r\nopening wide his eyes; ‘what is this?’ and again he sucked his finger.\r\nThen flashed upon him the great truth that he had discovered a new\r\npleasure—had, in fact, opened up to his fellows a source of immeasurable\r\ndelight. He proceeded at once to realise the thought. With a stone he\r\nopened the oyster’s threshold, and warily ventured on a piece of the\r\nmollusc itself. ‘Delicious!’ he exclaimed; and there and then, with no\r\nother condiment than its own juice, without the usual accompaniment, as we\r\nnow take it, of ‘foaming brown stout’ or ‘pale Chablis’ to wash it\r\ndown—and, sooth to say, it requires neither—did that solitary, nameless\r\nman indulge in the first oyster‐banquet!”(38)\r\n\r\nThe authorities all agree, as above, that however good some cooked oysters\r\nmay be, if you would have them in their most delicious condition, you must\r\ntake them _au naturel_. In Wilson’s “Noctes Ambrosianæ” we find the\r\nfollowing:—“I never, at any time o’ the year, had recourse to the cruet\r\ntill after the lang hunder; and in September, after four months’ fast frae\r\nthe creturs, I can easily devour them by theirsels, just in their ain\r\nliccor, ontill anither fifty; and then, to be sure, just when I am\r\nbeginning to be a wee stawed, I apply first the pepper to a squad; and\r\nthen, after a score or twa in that way, some dizzen and a half wi’\r\nvinegar, and finish off, like you, wi’ a wheen to the mustard, till the\r\nbrodd is naething but shells.... There’s really no end in nature to the\r\neatin’ of eisters.”\r\n\r\nOyster‐fishing is pursued in many different ways in different countries.\r\nRound Minorca, divers descend, hammer in hand, and bring up as many as\r\nthey can carry. On the English and French coasts a most destructive\r\nprocess is employed; a dredge‐net, heavily weighted with an iron frame, is\r\nthrown overboard; it tears off a number of the precious bivalves from the\r\nbottom, and leaves a larger number buried in the mud. “In France,” says\r\nFiguier, “oyster‐dredging is conducted by fleets of thirty or forty boats,\r\neach carrying four or five men. At a fixed hour, and under the\r\nsurveillance of a coastguard in a pinnace bearing the national flag, the\r\nflotilla commences the fishing. In the estuary of the Thames the practice\r\nis much the same, although no official surveillance is observed. Each bark\r\nis provided with four or five dredges, each resembling in shape a common\r\nclasp purse. These dredges are formed of network, with a strong iron\r\nframe, the iron frame serving the double purpose of acting as a scraper\r\nand keeping the mouth open, while giving a proper pressure as it travels\r\nover the oyster‐beds.... The tension of the rope is the signal for hauling\r\nin, and very heterogeneous are the contents of the dredge—seaweeds, star‐\r\nfishes, lobsters, crabs, actinia, and stones. In this manner the common\r\noyster‐beds on both sides of the Channel were ploughed up by the oyster‐\r\ndredger pretty much as the ploughman on shore turns up a field.” The\r\nconsequence was that the fields became nearly exhausted. This led to the\r\nscientific cultivation now in vogue, which has proved most thoroughly\r\nsuccessful in a commercial point of view.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, the Neapolitan Lake Fusaro—the Acheron of so many of the\r\nclassical poets—is a great oyster‐park, dating from the days of the\r\nRomans. It is a salt, marshy pond, shaded by magnificent trees; its\r\ngreatest depth is nowhere more than six feet; its bottom is black, the mud\r\nbeing of volcanic origin. The general idea involved in the oyster\r\ncultivation there is the protection of the embryo oyster. The fishermen of\r\nLake Fusaro warehouse, as it were, in protected spots, the oysters ready\r\nto discharge the spawn or spat. Upon the bottom of the lake, and all\r\naround it, there are round pyramidal heaps of stones and artificial\r\nrockeries, surrounded by piles. Other piles have lines suspended from one\r\nto the other, each cord bearing a faggot or faggots of young branches and\r\ntwigs. In the spawning season the young fry, issuing from the parents on\r\nthe stones or rocks, are arrested by these means. They have, as it were, a\r\nresting‐place provided for them on the piles and faggots.\r\n\r\nThe system pursued in France is that introduced by M. Coste, and founded\r\non his study of the Fusaro park. In 1858 he reported to the Emperor that\r\nof twenty‐three oyster‐beds which had once existed at Rochelle, Marennes,\r\nRochefort, the Isles of Ré and Oleron, only five were left, and that at\r\nother places formerly famed for oysters a similar mournful statement must\r\nbe made. “The impulse given by this report has been productive of the most\r\nsatisfactory results in France. All along the coast the maritime\r\npopulations are now actively engaged in oyster culture. Oyster‐parks, in\r\nimitation of those at Fusaro, have sprung up. In his appeal to the\r\nEmperor, M. Coste suggested that the State, through the Administration of\r\nMarine, and by means of the vessels at its command, should take steps for\r\nsowing the whole French coast in such a manner as to re‐establish the\r\noyster‐banks now in ruins, extend those which were prosperous, and create\r\nothers anew wherever the nature of the bottom would permit. The first\r\nserious attempt to carry out the views of the distinguished Academician\r\nwere made in the Bay of St. Brieuc. In the month of April in the same year\r\nin which his report was received operations commenced by planting\r\n3,000,000 mother‐oysters which had been dredged in the common ground;\r\nbrood from the oyster‐grounds at Cancale and Tréquiers being distributed\r\nin ten longitudinal lines on tiles, fragments of pottery, and valves of\r\nshells. At the end of eight months the progress of the beds was tested,\r\nand the dredge in a few minutes brought up 2,000 oysters fit for the\r\ntable, while two fascines, drawn up at random, contained nearly 20,000,\r\nfrom one to two inches in diameter.” The publicity given to these facts\r\nexcited great and practical interest, and in a short time the culture\r\nassumed gigantic proportions. The Bay of Arcachon was transformed into a\r\nvast field of production, no less than 1,200 capitalists, mostly very\r\nsmall ones, associated with an equal number of fishermen, having up to\r\n1870 planted no less than 988 acres of oysters. In this way the State\r\norganised two model farms for experimental purposes, at the trifling\r\noriginal cost of £114; it was estimated to be worth £8,000 in 1870, and\r\nhad 5,000,000 oysters, large and small. 1,200 parks were then in active\r\noperations on the Isle of Ré, and 2,000 more in course of construction.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: DREDGING FOR OYSTERS.]\r\n\r\nIn our own country the Whitstable Company has been most successful. “The\r\nlayings at Whitstable,” Mr. Bertram tells us, “occupy about a mile and a\r\nhalf square, and the oyster‐beds have been so prosperous as to have\r\nobtained the name of the ‘happy fishing grounds.’ Whitstable lies in a\r\nsandy bay formed by a small branch of the Medway, which separates the Isle\r\nof Sheppey from the mainland. Throughout this bay, from the town of\r\nWhitstable at its eastern extremity to the old town of Faversham, which\r\nlies several miles inland, the whole of the estuary is occupied by oyster‐\r\nfarms, on which the maritime population, to the extent of 3,000 people and\r\nupwards, is occupied, the sum paid for labour by the various companies\r\nbeing set down at £160,000 per annum, besides the employment given at\r\nWhitstable in building and repairing boats, dredges, and other requisites\r\nfor the oyster‐fishing. The business of the various companies is to feed\r\noysters for the London and other markets, to protect the spawn or flotsam,\r\nas the dredgers call it, which is emitted on their own beds, and to\r\nfurnish, by purchase or otherwise, the new brood necessary to supply the\r\nbeds which have been taken up for consumption.” The little Bay of Pont, on\r\nthe Essex coast, a piece of water sixteen miles long by three wide, now\r\ngives employment to 150 or more boats, the crews of which are exclusively\r\nemployed in obtaining brood oysters from eighteen months to two years old\r\nto supply the oyster farmers.\r\n\r\nThe Thames, or “native” system, is as follows:—Every year there is a\r\nregular examination of the beds, which are so carefully dredged that\r\nalmost every individual oyster is examined. The younger ones are placed\r\nwhere they can thrive best, the same being true of all grades. Dead and\r\nsickly oysters are removed, and star‐fish and all kinds of enemies killed.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: THE SCALLOP (_Pecten_).]\r\n\r\nThe Scallop (_Pecten_) is not a true oyster, though it may be cooked and\r\ntreated like one, with satisfactory results. Its name is derived from the\r\nchanneled edges and surfaces peculiar to it, which somewhat resemble the\r\narrangements of the teeth of a comb. Centuries ago they were known as\r\nPilgrims’ Shells; for in the middle ages the pilgrims were wont to\r\nornament their habits or hats with these bivalves, of which there are not\r\nfar from a couple of hundred known species. They are much more lively\r\nanimals than the oyster, being able to shift about from place to place\r\nwith some degree of agility; this they do by forcibly ejecting water\r\nbetween their shells, moving on by a kind of recoil. Another curious\r\nbivalve mollusc is the _Spondylus_, a genus found mostly in the warmer\r\nseas, some of the species of which are highly prized by conchologists.\r\nTheir strong, brilliantly‐coloured shells bristle with spines and feet.\r\nOne of the most remarkable species is that known to naturalists as\r\n_Spondylus regius_, at all times scarce, and at one time extremely rare.\r\nIn connection with the last‐named mollusc, a story is told by M. Chenu,\r\nregarding an enthusiastic collector. “M. R——,” says Chenu, “was Professor\r\nof Botany to the Faculty of Paris, and was, as sometimes happens, more\r\nlearned than rich; he wished, on the invitation of a stranger, to purchase\r\none of these shells at a very high price, which might be from 3,000 to\r\n6,000 francs (approximately £120 to £240); the bargain was made, and the\r\nprice agreed upon; it was only necessary to pay. The money in the\r\nProfessor’s hands made only a part of the sum the merchant was to receive\r\nfor his shell, and he would not part with it without payment. M. R——, now\r\nconsulting his desire to possess the shell more than his weak resources,\r\nmade up secretly a parcel of his scanty plate, and went out to sell it.\r\nWithout consulting his wife, he replaced his silver plate by articles of\r\ntin, and ran to the merchant to secure his coveted Spondylus, which he\r\nbelieved to be _S. regius_.\r\n\r\n                        [Illustration: SPONDYLUS.]\r\n\r\n“The hour of dinner arrived, and we may imagine the astonishment of Madame\r\nR——, who could not comprehend the strange metamorphosis of her plate. She\r\ndelivered herself of a thousand painful conjectures on the subject. M.\r\nR——, on his part, returned home happy with his shell, which he had\r\ncommitted to the safe custody of a box placed in his coat pocket. But as\r\nhe approached the house he paused, and began for the first time to think\r\nof the reception he might meet with. The reproaches which awaited him,\r\nhowever, were compensated when he thought of the treasure he carried home.\r\nFinally, he reached home, and Madame R——’s wrath was worthy of the\r\noccasion; the poor man was overwhelmed with the grief he had caused his\r\nwife; his courage altogether forsook him. He forgot his shell, and in his\r\ntrepidation, seated himself on a chair without the necessary adjustment of\r\nhis garment. He was only reminded of his treasure by hearing the crushing\r\nsound of the breaking box which contained it. Fortunately the damage done\r\nwas not very great—two spines only of the shell were broken; but the good\r\nman’s grief made so great an impression on Madame R——, that she no longer\r\nthought of her own loss, but directed all her efforts to console the\r\nsimple‐minded philosopher.”\r\n\r\nIt may be added that these curious bivalve molluscs are very commonly\r\nassociated with branches of coral, to which they adhere firmly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n             THE OCEAN AND ITS LIVING WONDERS (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n                The Univalves—A Higher Scale of Animal—The\r\n          Gasteropoda—Limpets—Used for Basins in the Straits of\r\n    Magellan—Spiral and Turret Shells—The Cowries—The Mitre Shells—The\r\n     Purpuras—Tyrian Purple—The Whelk—The Marine Trumpet—The Winged‐\r\n     feet Molluscs—The Cephalopodous Molluscs—The Nautilus—Relic of a\r\n        Noble Family—The Pearly Nautilus and its Uses—The Cuttle‐\r\n     fish—Michelet’s Comments—Hugo’s Actual Experiences—Gilliatt and\r\n     his Combat—A Grand Description—The Devil‐Fish—The Cuttle‐Fish of\r\n    Science—A Brute with Three Hearts—Actual Examples contrasted with\r\n      the Kraken—A Monster nearly Captured—Indian Ink and Sepia—The\r\n                      Argonauta—The Paper Nautilus.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, the bivalves having had their turn, let us direct our attention\r\nto a higher class of animals, to which nature has been more generous.\r\nThey, unlike the first‐named molluscs, have heads. “This head,” says\r\nFiguier, “is still carried humbly; it is not yet _os sublime dedit_; it is\r\ndrawn along an inch or so from the ground, and in no respect resembles the\r\nproud and magnificent organ which crowns and adorns the body of the\r\ngreater and more powerfully organised animals.” The Acephalous, or\r\n“headless,” must now make way for the Cephalous, or headed mollusca. These\r\nagain are divided by the scientists into three great classes, the\r\n_Gasteropoda_, _Pteropoda_, and _Cephalopoda_.\r\n\r\nThe title of the _Gasteropoda_ is derived from two Greek words signifying\r\n_belly_ and _foot_; the _raison d’être_ of that title being that these\r\nanimals progress by means of flattened discs placed under their bellies.\r\nThe snail, slug, and cowrie, are leading types of this class.\r\n\r\nIn the _Pteropoda_ (from Greek words signifying _wing_ and _foot_)\r\nlocomotion is effected by membranous fins or wings.\r\n\r\nLastly, the _Cephalopoda_ are so called because they have prominently, as\r\na class, heads and feet, locomotion being effected by a set of tentacles\r\n(arms or legs, as you will). The cuttle‐fish and devil‐fish (or octopus)\r\nare types of this important series of animals.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: THE LIMPET (_Patella_).]\r\n\r\nThe vastness of the subject precludes the possibility of details, and for\r\nevident reasons a few of those inhabiting the sea itself can only be\r\nconsidered here. Among the “Gasteropods,” as they are familiarly termed,\r\nthe limpets constitute a numerous family. The scientific name _Patella_ (a\r\ndeep dish or knee‐cap) was given to them by Linnæus, the form of their\r\nshells fully warranting the title. Some of them are oval, others circular;\r\nbut all terminate in an elliptic cone. Otherwise they are varied enough,\r\nsome being smooth, but others having ridges or scales on the outer\r\nsurface, the edges being often dentated. Their colours are very varied.\r\nThe head of the animal itself has two horns and two eyes; its foot is a\r\nthick fleshy disc, and when it means to hold on to a rock we all know how\r\ndifficult it is to dislodge it, for the said foot becomes a kind of\r\nsucker. Some of those from the coast of Africa and the Antilles, &c., have\r\nelegant forms, as witness _Patella umbella_, _P. granatina_, _P.\r\nlongicosta_, and others. Although often eaten, they are very tough and\r\nindigestible. In Southern seas they attain to a great size; for example,\r\nin the Straits of Magellan the natives use for culinary purposes species\r\nas large as a slop‐basin.\r\n\r\n                          [Illustration: TURBO.]\r\n\r\n                         [Illustration: TROCHUS.]\r\n\r\nWell‐known shells are also those of many species of _Trochus_; the spiral\r\nshell has literally a _spiral animal_ inside it. So also some of the fifty\r\nspecies of _Turbo_, which are often marbled in beautiful colours outwardly\r\nand superbly nacred within. So again the winding pyramidal shells of the\r\n_Turritella_, many of which are found in every sea. And once more, what\r\nmantelpiece of old was not adorned with a pair or more of cowrie shells\r\n(_Cypræ_), natives of every sea! They range from the little whitish money\r\ncowrie, actually used in place of coin in parts of Africa to‐day, to\r\nhandsome shells of large size. The animal which inhabits this shell is\r\nelongated, and has a head with a pair of long tentacles, each having a\r\nvery large eye. The foot, as one example specially will show (_Cypræ\r\ntigris_) is an oval sucker, capable of great tenacity.\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: THE COWRIE (_Cypræa tigris_).]\r\n\r\nIn every conchologist’s collection will be found some of the mitre shells,\r\nso called from their resemblance to a bishop’s mitre, and principally\r\nobtained from Indian and Australian seas. So, again, the _Voluta_, with\r\ntheir oval and graceful forms. The animal inhabiting the latter has a very\r\nlarge head, provided with two tentacles and a mouth furnished with hooked\r\nteeth. The foot is very large and projects from the whole mouth of the\r\nshell, which is often ornamented with gay colours and varied marks and\r\nflutings. So also the _Conus_ genus, the title of which sufficiently\r\nindicates its general form, and some of the shells of which command high\r\nprices. These generally tropical shells are more uniform in shape than\r\nmany just mentioned, but they are most beautifully varied in colour and\r\nminor details. The “residents” have large heads with _snouts_, while their\r\nmouths are furnished with horny teeth. Every good collection, too, is sure\r\nto contain examples of the genus _Cassis_, principally from the Indian\r\nOcean.\r\n\r\n                         [Illustration: VOLUTA.]\r\n\r\n                          [Illustration: CONUS.]\r\n\r\nAmong the one‐shell molluscs the Purpuras bear an honoured name; for did\r\nthey not furnish the Greeks and Romans with the brilliant purple colouring\r\nmatter which was reserved for the mantles of princes and patricians! The\r\ngenus _Purpura_ is characterised as possessing an oval shell, thick\r\npointed. The animal itself has a large head, furnished with two swollen\r\nconical tentacles close together, and bearing an eye towards the middle of\r\ntheir external side. By means of a large foot they creep about in pursuit\r\nof bivalves. The larger and more important kinds come from the warmer\r\nseas, especially those surrounding the West Indies and Australia.\r\n\r\nThe purple mentioned in the Scriptures in connection with fine linen was\r\nthat of the Phœnicians, and came from Tyre. Sir William Wilde discovered\r\nnot far from the ruins of that city several circular excavations in a\r\nrocky cliff, and in these he found a great number of crushed and broken\r\nshells of Purpura. He believed that they had been bruised in great masses\r\nby the Tyrian workmen for the manufacture of the dye. Shells of the same\r\nspecies (_Murex trunculus_) are commonly found on the same coast at the\r\npresent day. Aristotle says that the Tyrian dye was taken from two\r\nmolluscs inhabiting the Phœnician coasts and seas. According to the great\r\nGreek philosopher, one of these had a very large shell, consisting of\r\nseven turns of the spire, studded with spines, and terminating in a strong\r\nbeak; the other had a much smaller shell. It is thought that the latter is\r\nto be found in the _Purpura lapillus_, which abounds in the English\r\nChannel. Reaumur and Duhamel both obtained a purple colour from it, which\r\nthey applied as a dye, and found permanent. The real secret of the\r\nproduction of the Tyrian purple remains undiscovered to‐day.\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: PURPURA LAPILLUS.]\r\n\r\nThe genus _Buccinum_ resembles that of the _Purpura_ in many respects. The\r\ncommon whelk belongs to the series. Thus one of the humblest of our shell‐\r\nfish is allied to the animal from which a nearly priceless dye was once\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n                          [Illustration: MUREX.]\r\n\r\n                          [Illustration: HARPA.]\r\n\r\n                        [Illustration: CLEODORA.]\r\n\r\nThe genus _Harpa_ includes some beautifully marked and coloured shells, of\r\nwhich _H. ventricosa_ is an attractive example. These are chiefly found in\r\nthe Indian Ocean. The Rock Shells (_Murex_) abound in every sea, but are\r\nfiner and more branching in the warmer ones. They are remarkable for\r\nbright colours and fantastic forms. The shell is oblong with a long spire\r\nattached, its surface often covered with rows of branching spines. The\r\ngenus _Triton_, of which about one hundred species are known, is ranged\r\nwith the genus _Murex_, on account of points of similarity. The Marine\r\nTrumpet (_Triton variegatum_) which sometimes attains a length of sixteen\r\ninches, is a fine example. The genus _Strombus_ includes among its species\r\nthe great roughly ornamental shells, often used for grottoes or rockeries.\r\nSome of the streets of Vera Cruz are said to be paved with them. Oddest\r\nand most remarkable of all the marine shells to be found in the\r\nnaturalist’s collection are those of the genus _Pteroceras_. They are of\r\nfresh and brilliantly shaded colours.\r\n\r\n                        [Illustration: STROMBUS.]\r\n\r\n                         [Illustration: TRITON.]\r\n\r\nAnd now to the _Pteropoda_, practically “winged feet” molluscs, the\r\nposition of which in scientific nomenclature many think unsatisfactory.\r\nThis is, however, of little consequence to the general reader. These\r\ncurious little molluscs can pass through the deep blue seas they usually\r\ninhabit rapidly, reminding us strongly of the movements of a butterfly or\r\nsome other winged insect. They can “ascend to the surface very suddenly,\r\nturn themselves in a determinate space, or rather swim without appearing\r\nto change their place, while sustaining themselves at the same height.”\r\n“If,” continues Figuier, “anything alarms them, they fold up their\r\nflappers and descend to such a depth in their watery world as will give\r\nthem the security they seek. Thus they pass their lives in the open sea\r\nfar from any other shelter except that yielded by the gulf weed and other\r\nalgæ. In appearance and habits these small and sometimes microscopic\r\ncreatures resemble the fry of some other forms of mollusca. They literally\r\nswarm both in tropical and arctic seas; and are sometimes so numerous as\r\nto colour the ocean for leagues. They are the principal food of whales and\r\nsea‐birds in high latitudes, rarely approaching the coast. Only one or two\r\nspecies have been accidentally taken on our shores, and those evidently\r\ndriven thither by currents into which they have been entangled, or by\r\ntempests which have stirred the waters with a power beyond theirs. Dr.\r\nLeach states that in 1811, during a tour to the Orkneys, he observed on\r\nthe rocks of the Isle of Staffa several mutilated specimens of _Clio\r\nborealis_. Some days after, having borrowed a large shrimp net, and rowing\r\nalong the coast of Mull, when the sea, which had been extremely stormy,\r\nhad become calm, he succeeded in catching one alive, which is now in the\r\nBritish Museum.” Professor Huxley has told us that they have auditory\r\norgans, are sensible of light and heat, and probably of odours, but that\r\nthey possess very imperfect eyes and tentacles. They have respiratory\r\norgans, hearts and livers, and are undeniably social and gregarious,\r\nswarming together in great numbers.\r\n\r\nWe now approach the highest class of the mollusca—on paper, only, be it\r\nobserved, for in actual life most of them are either nearly\r\nunapproachable, or, at all events, are most undesirable acquaintances.\r\n\r\n“The cephalopodous molluscs,” says Figuier, a writer who in descriptive\r\npowers is an artistic scientist and a scientific artist, “are indeed\r\nhighly organised for molluscs, for they possess in a high degree the sense\r\nof sight, hearing, and touch. They appear with the earlier animals which\r\npresent themselves on the earth, and they are numerous even now, although\r\nthey are far from playing the important part that was assigned to them in\r\nthe early ages of organic life upon our planet. The Ammonites and\r\nBelemnites existed by thousands among the beings which peopled the seas\r\nduring the secondary epoch in the history of the globe.” The Cephalopods\r\nwere divided by Professor Owen into two great orders, _Tetrabranchiata_,\r\nor animals having four gills, and the _Dibranchiata_, having two gills.\r\nThe first order has at this epoch but one genus, that of _Nautilus_. This\r\ngroup of animals belongs emphatically to the earlier ages of our globe,\r\n“is becoming gradually extinct, and presents in our days only some species\r\nvery rare and few, especially when we compare them with the prodigious\r\nnumbers of these beings which animated the seas of the ancient world.” It\r\nis a fact that the empty shells of the nautilus are more commonly found\r\nfloating on the ocean than those which are inhabited. No doubt the living\r\nnautilus falls a prey either to larger marine animals, or, likely enough,\r\nto sea‐fowl. Is it not also possible that the lone animal, knowing the\r\nfate of its ancestors, and how they lie buried in barren strata,\r\noverwhelmed with melancholy apprehensions of his own future, jumps\r\noverboard and drowns himself? This suggestion is _not_ to be found among\r\nthe recognised authorities.\r\n\r\nOn the sea this scion of a decayed family is a graceful object, and in\r\nfine weather projects his head and tentacles, and takes a general\r\ninspection of the ocean. On land, however, he does not shine to so much\r\nadvantage, for there he has to drag himself over the ground, head down and\r\nbody and shell up. The shell has a regularly convoluted form, and is\r\ndivided into cells; doubtless this it was that gave the idea to the\r\ninventor of water‐tight compartments. Through these passes a tube for\r\nrespiration. In the outermost partition is the owner of the ship, covered\r\nby its mantle as a captain would be with pea‐jacket or sou’‐wester. The\r\nanimal possesses numerous tentacles, and has two great eyes, enabling it\r\nto keep a good “look‐out.”\r\n\r\nThe Pearly Nautilus, common in the Indian seas, is sometimes used for\r\nfood. Its shell occasionally attains to a height of eight inches, and is\r\nsaid to be even now used by Hindoo priests as the conch with which they\r\nsummon their followers to prayers. A very fine nacre is yielded, which is\r\nused in ornamental work. The Orientals make drinking‐cups of it, and adorn\r\nit with engraved devices. Many a retired old sea‐captain has such about\r\nhis house to‐day; and before the world became so familiar with Asiatic\r\nproductions they were often found in the houses of the wealthy.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: THE COMMON NAUTILUS (_Nautilus pompilius_.)]\r\n\r\nThe order _Dibranchiata_ contains six families, mostly of formidable and\r\nrepulsive nature. They include cuttle‐fish, squids, and argonauts, and\r\nthese must mainly occupy our attention. What wonderful things have not\r\nbeen written about them! The French have found in them a fertile theme.\r\n\r\n“It is now,” says Michelet, “however, necessary to describe a much graver\r\nworld—a world of rapine and of murder. From the very beginning, from the\r\nfirst appearance of life, violent death appeared; sudden refinement,\r\nuseful but cruel purification of all which has languished, or which may\r\nlinger or languish, of the slow and feeble creation whose fecundity had\r\nencumbered the globe.\r\n\r\n“In the more ancient formations of the Old World we find two murderers—a\r\nnipper and a sucker. The first is revealed to us by the imprint of the\r\ntrilobite, an order now lost, the most destructive of extinct beings. The\r\nsecond subsists in one gigantic fragment, a beak nearly two feet in\r\nlength, which was that of a great sucker, or cuttle‐fish (_sepia_). If we\r\nmay judge from such a beak, this monster—if the other parts of the body\r\nwere in proportion—must have been enormous; its ventose invincible arms,\r\nof perhaps twenty or thirty feet, like those of some monstrous spider. In\r\nmaking war on the molluscs he remains mollusc also; that is to say, always\r\nan embryo. He presents the strange—almost ridiculous, if it were not also\r\nterrible—appearance of an embryo going to war; of a fœtus furious and\r\ncruel, soft and transparent, but tenacious, breathing with a murderous\r\nbreath—for it is not for food alone that it makes war: it has the wish to\r\ndestroy. Satiated, and even bursting, it still destroys. Without defensive\r\narmour, under its threatening murmurs there is no peace; its safety is to\r\nattack. It regards all creatures as a possible enemy. It throws about its\r\nlong arms, or rather thongs, armed with suckers, at random.”\r\n\r\nVictor Hugo’s description of the monster, the devil‐fish (or octopus),\r\nwith whom poor Gilliatt has that terrible encounter, will not fade from\r\nthe mind of any one who has once read it. The poet‐novelist tells us that\r\nhe founded his narration on facts that came under his own notice. “Near\r\nBreck‐Hou, in Sark,” says he, “they show a cave where a devil‐fish, a few\r\nyears since, seized and drowned a lobster‐fisher.... He who writes these\r\nlines has seen with his own eyes, at Sark, in the cavern called the\r\nBoutiques, a _pieuvre_ (cuttle‐fish) swimming, and pursuing a bather. When\r\ncaptured and killed, this specimen was found to be four English feet\r\nbroad, and one could count its four hundred suckers. The monster thrust\r\nthem out convulsively, in the agony of death.”\r\n\r\nHugo’s wonderful description of the monster, though often technically\r\nwrong, principally from exaggeration, must have some place here. He grasps\r\nthe facts of nature with the appreciation of the artist rather than of the\r\nscientist.\r\n\r\n“It is difficult,” writes he, “for those who have not seen it to believe\r\nin the existence of the devil‐fish. Compared to this creature the ancient\r\nhydras are insignificant. At times we are tempted to imagine that the\r\nvague forms which float in our dreams may encounter in the realm of the\r\nPossible attractive forces, having power to fix their lineaments, and\r\nshape living beings out of these creatures of our slumbers....\r\n\r\n“If terror were the object of its creation, nothing could be more perfect\r\nthan the devil‐fish.\r\n\r\n“The whale has enormous bulk, the devil‐fish is comparatively small; the\r\ntararaca makes a hissing noise, the devil‐fish is mute; the rhinoceros has\r\na horn, the devil‐fish has none; the scorpion has a dart, the devil‐fish\r\nhas no dart; the shark has sharp fins, the devil‐fish has no fins; the\r\nvespertilio‐bat has wings with claws, the devil‐fish has no wings; the\r\nporcupine has his spines, the devil‐fish has no spines; the sword‐fish has\r\nhis sword, the devil‐fish has no sword; the torpedo has its electric\r\nspark, the devil‐fish has none; the toad has its poison, the devil‐fish\r\nhas none; the viper has its venom, the devil‐fish has no venom; the lion\r\nhas its talons, the devil‐fish has no talons; the griffon has its beak,\r\nthe devil‐fish has no beak; the crocodile has its jaws, the devil‐fish has\r\nno teeth.\r\n\r\n“The devil‐fish has no muscular organisation, no menacing cry, no\r\nbreastplate, no horn, no dart, no claw, no tail with which to hold or\r\nbruise, no cutting fins, or wings with nails, no prickles, no sword, no\r\nelectric discharge, no poison, no talons, no beak, no teeth. Yet he is, of\r\nall creatures, the most formidably armed. What, then, is the devil‐fish?\r\nIt is the sea‐vampire.\r\n\r\n“The swimmer who, attracted by the beauty of the spot, ventures among\r\nbreakers in the open sea, where the still waters hide the splendours of\r\nthe deep, or in the hollows of unfrequented rocks, in unknown caverns\r\nabounding in sea‐plants, testacea and crustacea, under the deep portals of\r\nthe ocean, runs the risk of meeting it. If that fate should be yours, be\r\nnot curious, but fly. The intruder enters there dazzled, but quits the\r\nspot in terror.\r\n\r\n“This frightful apparition, which is always possible among the rocks in\r\nthe open sea, is a greyish form which undulates in the water. It is the\r\nthickness of a man’s arm, and its length nearly five feet. Its outline is\r\nragged. Its form resembles an umbrella closed, and without handle. This\r\nirregular mass advances slowly towards you. Suddenly it opens, and eight\r\nradii issue abruptly from around a face with two eyes. These radii are\r\nalive; their undulation is like lambent flames; they resemble, when\r\nopened, the spokes of a wheel of four or five feet in diameter. A terrible\r\nexpansion! It springs upon its prey.\r\n\r\n“The devil‐fish harpoons its victim.\r\n\r\n“It winds around the sufferer, covering and entangling him in its long\r\nfolds. Underneath it is yellow; above, a dull, earthy hue; nothing could\r\nrender that inexplicable shade dust‐coloured. Its form is spider‐like, but\r\nits tints are like those of the chameleon. When irritated it becomes\r\nviolet. Its most horrible characteristic is its softness. Its folds\r\nentangle; its contact paralyses.\r\n\r\n“It has an aspect like gangrened or scabrous fish. It is a monstrous\r\nembodiment of disease.\r\n\r\n“It adheres closely to its prey, and cannot be torn away—a fact which is\r\ndue to its power of exhausting air. The eight antennæ, large at their\r\nroots, diminish gradually, and end in needle‐like points. Underneath each\r\nof these feelers range two rows of pustules, decreasing in size, the\r\nlargest ones near the head, the smaller at the extremities. Each row\r\ncontains twenty‐five of these. There are, therefore, fifty pustules to\r\neach feeler, and the creature possesses in the whole four hundred. These\r\npustules are capable of acting like cupping glasses. They are\r\ncartilaginous substances, cylindrical, horny, and livid. Upon the large\r\nspecies they diminish gradually from the diameter of a five‐franc piece to\r\nthe size of a split pea. These small tubes can be thrust out and withdrawn\r\nby the animal at will. They are capable of piercing to a depth of more\r\nthan one inch.\r\n\r\n“This sucking apparatus has all the regularity and delicacy of a key‐\r\nboard. It stands forth at one moment and disappears the next. The most\r\nperfect sensitiveness cannot equal the contractibility of these\r\nsuckers—always proportioned to the internal movement of the animal and its\r\nexterior circumstances. The monster is endowed with the qualities of the\r\nsensitive plant.\r\n\r\n“This animal is the same as those which mariners call poulps, which\r\nscience designates _Cephalopoda_, and which ancient legends call krakens.\r\nIt is the English sailors who call them ‘devil‐fish,’ and sometimes\r\nbloodsuckers. In the Channel Islands they are called _pieuvres_.\r\n\r\n“They are rare at Guernsey, very small at Jersey; but near the island of\r\nSark are numerous and very large....\r\n\r\n“When swimming the devil‐fish rests, so to speak, in its sheath. It swims\r\nwith all its parts drawn close. It may be likened to a sleeve sewn up with\r\na closed fish within. The protuberance which is the head pushes the water\r\naside, and advances with a vague undulatory movement. Its two eyes, though\r\nlarge, are indistinct, being of the colour of the water.\r\n\r\n“When in ambush, or seeking its prey, it retires into itself, grows\r\nsmaller, and condenses itself. It is then scarcely distinguishable in the\r\nsubmarine twilight. At such times it looks like a mere ripple in the\r\nwater. It resembles anything except a living creature. The devil‐fish is\r\ncrafty. When its victim is unsuspicious, it opens suddenly. A glutinous\r\nmass, endowed with a malignant will, what can be more horrible?\r\n\r\n“It is in the most beautiful azure depths of the limpid water that this\r\nhideous, voracious polyp delights. It always conceals itself—a fact which\r\nincreases its terrible associations. When they are seen, it is almost\r\ninvariably after they have been captured. At night, however, and\r\nparticularly in the hot season, the devil‐fish becomes phosphorescent.\r\n\r\n“The devil‐fish not only swims, it walks. It is partly fish, partly\r\nreptile. It crawls upon the bed of the sea. At these times it makes use of\r\nits eight feelers, and creeps along in the fashion of a species of swift‐\r\nmoving caterpillar.\r\n\r\n“It has no blood, no bones, no flesh. It is soft and flabby: a skin with\r\nnothing inside. Its eight tentacles may be turned inside out, like the\r\nfingers of a glove. It has a single orifice in the centre of its radii,\r\nwhich appears at first to be neither the vent nor the mouth. It is, in\r\nfact, both one and the other. The orifice performs a double function. The\r\nentire creature is cold.\r\n\r\n“The jelly‐fish of the Mediterranean is repulsive. Contact with that\r\nanimated gelatinous substance which envelops the bather, in which the\r\nhands sink, and the nails scratch ineffectively, which can be torn without\r\nkilling it, and which can be plucked off without entirely removing it—that\r\nfluid and yet tenacious creature which slips through the fingers, is\r\ndisgusting; but no horror can equal the sudden apparition of the devil‐\r\nfish, that Medusa with its eight serpents.”\r\n\r\nLet us examine the creatures scientifically.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of these formidable animals are soft and fleshy, while the head\r\nprotrudes; it is gifted with the usual organs of sense, the eyes being\r\nparticularly prominent. “Not to oppress the reader with anatomical\r\ndetails,” says Figuier, “we shall just remark that the gaze of the cuttle‐\r\nfish is decided and threatening. Its projecting eyes and golden‐coloured\r\niris are said to have something fascinating in them.” The mouth is armed\r\nwith a pair of horny mandibles or beaks, not unlike those of a parrot, and\r\nis surrounded by a number of fleshy tentacles, provided, in most species,\r\nwith numerous suckers, and even claws. The arms or tentacles serve for all\r\npurposes—locomotion, swimming, offence, and defence. The suckers occupy\r\nall the _internal_ surface of the eight tentacular arms, and _each_ arm\r\ncarries about 240 of them. “The cuttle‐fish,” says the writer last quoted,\r\n“would be at no loss to reply to the question of the Don Diego of\r\nCorneille—\r\n\r\n  “‘Rodrique, as‐tu du cœur?’\r\n\r\nfor they have three hearts.” After that it need not be stated that they\r\npossess respiratory organs and a blood circulation. Man and woman can\r\nblush and change colour; _so can the cuttle‐fish_; but it turns darker\r\ninstead of paler, and its emotion has another effect—numerous little warts\r\nsuddenly appear on its surface.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the exaggerations of some writers, the size of many of these\r\nanimals is very large, as has been attested by trustworthy authorities.\r\nMr. Beale,(39) engaged in searching for shells on the rocks of Bonin\r\nIsland, was seized by one which measured across its expanded arms four\r\nfeet, the body not being larger than a clenched hand. He describes its\r\ncold, slimy grasp as sickening. His tormentor was killed by a cut from a\r\nlarge knife, but its arms had to be released bit by bit. In the museum of\r\nMontpellier there is one six feet long. Péron, a French naturalist, saw in\r\nthe Australian seas one eight feet long. The travellers Quoy and Gaimard\r\npicked up in the Atlantic Ocean the skeleton of an enormous mollusc,\r\nwhich, according to their calculations, must have weighed 200 lbs. In the\r\nCollege of Surgeons a beak or mandible of a cuttle‐fish is preserved,\r\nwhich is larger than a human hand. In 1853 a gigantic specimen was\r\nstranded on the coast of Jutland, which furnished many barrow‐loads of\r\nflesh and other organic matter.\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: THE OCTOPUS (_Octopus vulgaris_.)]\r\n\r\nWho has not heard of the kraken, the terror of the northern seas?\r\nNaturalists and others long ago gave credence to the assertions of certain\r\nScandinavian writers who believed themselves in the existence of a great\r\nsea‐monster capable of arresting and annihilating vessels. This kraken was\r\nmade to embrace a three‐masted vessel in its arms. “If,” says laughing De\r\nMontfort, “my kraken takes with them, I shall make it extend its arms to\r\nboth shores of the Straits of Gibraltar.” A Bishop of Bergen assured the\r\nworld that a whole regiment could easily manœuvre on the back of the\r\nkraken. All this, however, probably arose from the observation of some\r\nextraordinarily large specimen. An apparently well‐authenticated fact is\r\nthe following, vouched for by a French naval officer, and the then French\r\nConsul at the Canaries.\r\n\r\nThe steam corvette _Alecton_ fell in, between Teneriffe and Madeira, with\r\na sea‐monster of the cuttle kind, said to be fifty feet long, without\r\ncounting its eight arms; it had two fleshy fins; they estimated its weight\r\nat close on two tons. The commander allowed shots to be fired at it, one\r\nof which evidently hit the animal in a vital part, for the waves were\r\nstained with blood. A strong musky odour was noticed. This is\r\ncharacteristic of many of the cephalopods.\r\n\r\n“The musket shots not having produced the desired results, harpoons were\r\nemployed, but they took no hold on the soft, impalpable flesh of the\r\nmarine monster. When it escaped from the harpoon, it dived under the ship,\r\nand came up again at the other side. They succeeded at last in getting the\r\nharpoon to bite, and in passing a bowline hitch round the posterior part\r\nof the animal. But when they attempted to hoist it out of the water the\r\nrope penetrated deeply into the flesh, and separated it into two parts,\r\nthe head with the arms and tentacles dropping into the sea and making off,\r\nwhile the fins and posterior parts were brought on board: they weighed\r\nabout forty pounds.” The crew wished to pursue it in a boat, but the\r\ncommander refused, fearing that they might be capsized. “It is probable,”\r\nsays M. Moquin‐Tandon,(40) “that this colossal mollusc was sick, or\r\nexhausted by a recent struggle with some other monster of the deep.”\r\n\r\nMost of the cephalopods secrete a blackish fluid, which they can eject in\r\nmoments of danger, and thus cloud themselves in obscurity. This fluid was\r\nknown to the Romans, who made ink from it. It is the leading ingredient in\r\nIndian ink and sepia to‐day. A story is told of an English officer abroad\r\nwho went out just before dinner‐time for a walk on the beach, where he\r\ncame across a cuttle‐fish sheltering under a hollow rock. For a time each\r\nwatched the other in mute astonishment, but the cuttle‐fish had the best\r\nof it in the end. The aroused animal suddenly ejected a fountain of its\r\nblack fluid over the officer’s trousers, which was the more annoying\r\ninasmuch as they were of white duck!\r\n\r\nThe bone of the cuttle, powdered, has long been used, in combination with\r\nchalk, &c., as a dentifrice, so that the “monstrum horrendum” of Virgil is\r\nof some use in the world.\r\n\r\nThe sixth family of the _Dibranchiata_ contains only one genus,\r\n_Argonauta_, of which the paper nautilus is a pleasing example. “Floating\r\ngracefully on the surface of the sea, trimming its tiny sail to the\r\nbreeze, just sufficient to ruffle the surface of the waves, behold the\r\nexquisite living shallop! The elegant little bark which thus plays with\r\nthe current is no work of human hands, but a child of nature: it is the\r\nargonaut, whose tribes, decked in a thousand brilliant shades of colour,\r\nare wanderers of the night in innumerable swarms on the ocean’s surface!”\r\nThe Greek and Roman poets saw in it an elegant model of the ship which the\r\nskill and audacity of the man constructed who first braved the fury of the\r\nwaves. To meet it was considered a happy omen. “O fish justly dear to\r\nnavigators!” sang Oppian; “thy presence announces winds soft and friendly:\r\nthou bringest the calm, and thou art the sign of it!” Aristotle and Pliny\r\nboth gave careful descriptions of it. In India the shell fetches a great\r\nprice, and women consider it a fine ornament. Dancing‐girls carry them,\r\nand gracefully wave them over their heads.\r\n\r\nThe paper nautilus has more than its little sail to assist its\r\nprogression; it is able to eject water against the waves, and so move\r\nonward. They are timid and cautious creatures, live in families, and are\r\nalmost always found far out at sea: they never approach the shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n             THE OCEAN AND ITS LIVING WONDERS (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n           The Crustaceans, a Crusty Set—Young Crabs and their\r\n      Peculiarities—Shells and no Shells—Powers of Renewal—The Biter\r\n     Bit—Cocoa‐nut eating Crabs—Do Crabs like Boiling?—The Land Crab\r\n    and his Migrations—Nigger Excitement—The King Crab—The Hut Crab—A\r\n     True Yarn—The Hermit or Soldier Crab—Pugnaciousness—Crab War and\r\n      Human War—Prolific Crustaceans—Raising Lobster‐pots—Technical\r\n        Differences—How do Lobsters shed their Shells?—Fishermen’s\r\n         Ideas—Habits of the Lobster—Its Fecundity—The Supply for\r\n        Billingsgate—The Season‐“Lobster Frolics” in British North\r\n            America—Eel‐grass—Cray‐fish, Prawns, and Shrimps.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Crustacea we find the lowest form of articulate animals. They\r\npossess feet, breathe through gills, and derive their name from their hard\r\ncrusty covering, which is mainly carbonate of lime with colouring matter.\r\nThey have nearly all of them claws, which most of them know well how to\r\nemploy offensively. “They have been compared,” says Figuier, “to the\r\nheavily‐armed knights of the middle ages—at once audacious and cruel;\r\nbarbed in steel from head to foot, with visor and corselet, arm‐pieces and\r\nthigh‐pieces—scarcely anything, in fact, is wanting to complete the\r\nresemblance.” They possess the power of throwing off their calcareous\r\ncovering, when they become, for the nonce, as vulnerable as they had been\r\nbefore formidable.(41)\r\n\r\n“Among all the curious and quaint forms of animal life to be found in the\r\nsea,” says Lord, “few for grotesque oddity can equal the baby crabs, or\r\n_Zoëa_, as they are sometimes called. These interesting infants are not\r\nthe least like their papa or mamma, and no respectable or fully‐matured\r\nmale or female _crab_ would ever own them as his or her offspring. An\r\nelfish little creature is the juvenile crab, with a head scarcely\r\ndeserving the name, and a pair of goggle bull’s‐eyes as of two policemen’s\r\nlanterns rolled into one, a tail vastly too long for him, and an anti‐\r\ngarotte spear, quite as long as his absurd little body, attached to the\r\nspot where his coat‐collar should be.... Master Crab’s internal economy is\r\njust as curious as his external skeleton. One pair of jaws one would be\r\ndisposed to think sufficient for any living creature of reasonable\r\nrequirements, but he possesses eight, and instead of exposing his teeth to\r\nthe examination of the critical in matters of dentition, he carries them\r\nsafely stowed away in the interior of his stomach, where they would be\r\nexcessively hard to get at in cases of crustacean toothache. With such\r\nappliances as these the food cannot well be otherwise than perfectly\r\nmasticated. A crab’s liver is an odd organ to contemplate, and constitutes\r\na considerable portion of the soft interior of the shell‐like box in which\r\nthe heart and other viscera are lodged. That well‐known delicacy known as\r\nthe ‘cream’ or ‘fat’ of the crab is liver, and nothing else. The lungs, or\r\ngills, are formed by those fringe‐like appendages popularly known as the\r\n‘dead men’s fingers.’ The shell‐shifting process before referred to is\r\ncommon to all crustaceans; and our friend the crab, when he feels his\r\ncorselet getting rather tight for him, manages by some extraordinary\r\nprocess not only to extricate himself from it, together with his shell‐\r\ngauntlets, and the powerful nippers with which he is provided, but\r\nperforms other feats, compared with which those of the Davenport Brothers\r\nsink into utter insignificance.”\r\n\r\nNearly all the crustaceans are hardy and destructive, and fight not merely\r\ntheir enemies, but among each other. It matters little to them whether\r\nthey lose a claw or a tail, for after a few weeks of repose those members\r\ngrow again. Tandon records the fact that lobsters “which in an unfortunate\r\nencounter lost a limb, sick and debilitated, reappear at the end of a few\r\nmonths with a perfect limb, vigorous, and ready for service.” On the\r\nSpanish coast a certain crab is caught for its claw alone, which is\r\nconsidered excellent eating; this is pulled off, and the mutilated animal\r\nthrown back into the sea, likely enough to be retaken, and the same\r\nprocess repeated at some future time. Crustaceans are nearly all\r\ncarnivorous, and are by no means particular what they eat. Some of them,\r\nhowever, show considerable appreciation for the oyster. Sometimes they eat\r\neach other. Mr. Rymer Jones tells a story of one which attacked and\r\ncommenced to eat one slightly smaller than himself, and was then himself\r\nattacked and eaten by a companion, realising the old adage concerning\r\nfleas—\r\n\r\n  “And these have smaller still to bite ’em,\r\n    And so proceed, _ad infinitum_.”\r\n\r\nSome crustaceans, however, adopt a vegetable diet. The Robber Crab of the\r\nPolynesian Islands can not merely open a cocoa‐nut, but also enjoy its\r\ncontents. The crab begins by tearing off the fibre at the extremity where\r\nthe fruit is, always choosing the right hand. When this is removed, it\r\nstrikes it with its great claws until an opening is made; it then inserts\r\nits slender claws, and by wriggling and turning itself about removes the\r\ncontents of the nut.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: CRABS (_Cancer pagurus_).]\r\n\r\nThe proper mode of boiling crabs has long been a subject on which doctors\r\nhave disagreed. Who, then, shall decide? That there is cruelty associated\r\nwith the taking away of life it would be hard to deny, but the correctness\r\nof choice between gradual stewing in slowly‐heated water and being plunged\r\nat once into the seething, bubbling cauldron requires “the revelations of\r\na boiled crab” to clear up; and until a crustacean production under that\r\nor a like title appears, we shall continue to plunge our armour‐clad\r\nvictims in water at 212 degrees of Fahrenheit’s thermometer, and leave the\r\nquestion as to the propriety of our so doing to those who are disposed to\r\ngrapple with the subject for its own sake.\r\n\r\nThe West India Islands possess in the Land Crab (_Gecarcinus ruricola_) a\r\nkind of crustacean highlander, who retreats into the uplands at certain\r\ntimes in the year. “As the spawning season approaches a mighty gathering\r\nof the clans takes place, and whole legions, unwarned by fiery cross or\r\nblazing beacon, hasten forth to join the living tide flowing onward\r\ntowards the sea. Through the tangled jungle, down the rock‐strewed ravine,\r\nover fallen tree‐trunks, and among the dense undergrowth of the forest, in\r\nceaseless, creeping, crawling, scuttling thousands, still they come\r\nonward, and ever onward, as the bright stars shine out to light them on\r\ntheir way. Banks, hedges, walls, and even houses, are passed straight over\r\nin this crustacean steeplechase, no flags being needed to keep the mail‐\r\nclad competitors to the true course. Instinct the guide, and the blue sea\r\nfor a goal, nothing stops the race.\r\n\r\n“Cuffee and his companions, who have been gossiping and story‐telling\r\nbeneath their cocoa‐leaf roofs until half asleep, appear to become most\r\nviolent and incurable lunatics, on suddenly becoming aware of the\r\nnocturnal exodus. They leap high in the air, shout, scream, and dance like\r\nfiends, whilst the most ready‐witted of the crew dash off to ‘de massa’\r\nwith the startling news. ‘Hi, golly, sa! de crab! de crab! He come for\r\nsure, this time, sure ’nuff. Plenty catch um bime by;’ and Cuffee keeps\r\nhis word to the letter, and captures the pilgrims by the basketful, in\r\nspite of their claws. And black‐faced, woolly‐headed Aunt Lilly, the cook,\r\nshows her teeth, like ivory dominoes in an ebony box, as visions of white‐\r\nsnow‐like rice, cocoa‐nut milk, capsicum‐pods, and stewpans, pass in\r\npleasing and appetising review before her; and ‘massa’ himself takes an\r\nextra pull at the cold‐sangaree jug, sleeps pleasantly, and dreams of the\r\ncrab‐feast on the morrow.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE WEST INDIAN LAND CRAB (_Gecarcinus ruricola_).]\r\n\r\nThe King Crab of the eastern seas grows sometimes to an enormous size,\r\nwhile the lance‐shaped spear with which he is furnished is used by the\r\nMalays as a warlike instrument. Then, for a contrast, there’s the little\r\nnut‐crab, with his queer little legs tucked up under his body, which\r\nrambling jack‐tars sometimes gather for their friends at home, under the\r\nidea that their shells, when cut and polished, will make handsome brooches\r\nand shirt‐pins. Major Lord tells a good story of a dry old salt of a\r\nquartermaster, on the Indian station, who “chanced one day, when on shore\r\nfor a cruise, to become possessed of a goodly number of these lucky\r\nstones, as he called them, and by way of securing his treasures, placed\r\nthem in an old silk handkerchief, and stowed them away, with a few dollars\r\nand sundry cakes of cavendish, in the corner of his chest. It so happened\r\nthat some piratical shipmate, not proof against the allurements of\r\nhoneydew and silver, but totally indifferent to natural history, seized\r\nhis opportunity and spirited off the tobacco and money, but left the\r\nlucky‐stones behind. The next day, when our old friend came for his\r\naccustomed supply of the weed, he, to his horror, astonishment, and\r\nindignation, found the supposed pebbles in active motion, performing foot‐\r\nraces over his best jacket, the handkerchief spread open, and, alas!\r\nempty. ‘Well!’ exclaimed he; ‘blow me if this aint too much of the monkey!\r\nWhy, look ye here, messmates! These here blessed stones have come to life,\r\nevery man Jack of ’em. They’ve chawed up all my bacca, and spent every mag\r\nof my money! and now I’ll heave the beggars to Davy Jones’s locker.\r\nOverboard is where I means to pitch ’em.’ And so he did, no doubt to the\r\nintense gratification of the falsely‐accused crabs.”\r\n\r\n         [Illustration: THE HERMIT CRAB (_Pagurus Bernhardus_).]\r\n\r\nThe Hermit, or Soldier, Crab, with the exception of a kind of cuirass, or\r\nhead‐piece, has a soft, yielding skin. Knowing his own weakness, he\r\ninvariably entrenches himself in some safe place, not unfrequently\r\nemptying the shell of some other marine animal. When he outgrows his\r\nborrowed habitation he looks out for some larger dwelling. He is a very\r\ntimid creature, and retires at the least alarm. On the other hand, among\r\nhis kind he is strong, voracious, and cruel. Two hermit crabs cannot meet\r\nwithout a fight brewing, but it rarely comes off. “Each extends his long\r\npincers, and seems to try to touch the other, much as a spider does, when\r\nit seeks to seize a fly on its most vulnerable side; but each finding the\r\nother armed in proof and perfectly protected, though eager to fight,\r\nusually adopts the better part of valour, and prudently withdraws. They\r\noften have true passages of arms, nevertheless, in which claws are spread\r\nout and displayed in the most threatening manner, the two adversaries\r\ntumbling head over heels, and rolling one upon the other, but they get\r\nmore frightened than hurt.” Mr. Gosse, however, describes a struggle which\r\nhad a tragic end. A hermit met a brother hermit pleasantly lodged in a\r\nshell much more spacious than his own. He seized it by the head with his\r\npowerful claws, tore it from its asylum with the speed of lightning, and\r\ntook its place not less promptly, leaving the dispossessed unfortunate\r\nstruggling on the sand in convulsions of agony. “Our battles,” says\r\nBonnet, “have rarely such important objects in view; _they_ fight each\r\nother for a house.” A young poet of to‐day(42) sings of _our_ wars—\r\n\r\n  “Tell me, tell me, is this glory?\r\n    Is it honour, is it fame?\r\n  Has mankind, through ages hoary,\r\n    Given to war its fitting name?\r\n  Twist it, turn it, warp it, bind it,\r\n    Greet its triumphs with acclaim,\r\n  Yet at last the world will find it\r\n    Only murder, all the same!”\r\n\r\nBoth crabs and lobsters are amazingly prolific, and lay an enormous number\r\nof eggs: it is computed that each female produces from 12,000 to 20,000 in\r\na season; and yet these shell‐fish are always dear in London! In France,\r\nFiguier tells us, the size of the marketable lobster is regulated by law,\r\nand fixed at a minimum of eight inches in length: all under that length\r\nare contraband. The London market is supplied from every part of our\r\ncoasts, and very largely from Norway. At Kamble, near Southampton, one\r\nowner has storing‐ponds, or tanks, for 50,000 at a time; and he has his\r\nown smacks constantly running to the coasts of France, Scotland, and\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\nThe Lobster (_Homarus vulgaris_) is found in great abundance all round our\r\ncoasts. Who that has frequented our seaside watering‐places has not either\r\ngone out to assist in hauling up the lobster‐pots, or, at all events, seen\r\nthe fishermen returning with their spoils? And what _can_ be finer than a\r\nlobster boiled, say not more than half an hour after his capture from the\r\nbriny? He tastes very unlike the poor creature which has been conveyed by\r\nboat or train to London, and knocked about in barrows, carts, markets, and\r\nshops, until he wishes they would boil him, and have done with it at once.\r\nLobster‐pots are, practically, wicker‐basket traps. The hole at the bottom\r\nallows free ingress, but makes it difficult for the victim to get out.\r\nThey are baited with garbage, and the position of each on the rocks or\r\nsand below is marked by a buoy. Each fisherman has his own private mark on\r\nthem; and woe to the lobster‐thief, as to the crab‐thief! Sometimes nets\r\nare used for catching lobsters.\r\n\r\nMr. Pennant says that large lobsters are in their best season from the\r\nmiddle of October to the beginning of May. The smaller ones are good all\r\nthe summer. If they are four‐and‐a‐half inches long from the top of the\r\nhead to the end of the back shell they are called “sizable” lobsters; if\r\nunder four inches, “half‐size,” and two are reckoned as one of size. Under\r\nfour inches, they are called “pawks.”\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that up to a certain age lobsters shed their shells\r\nannually, but the mode of performance is not quite understood to‐day. “It\r\nis supposed that the old shell is cast, and that the animal retires to\r\nsome lurking‐place till the new covering acquires consistence to contend\r\nwith his armour‐clad congeners.... The most probable conjecture is that\r\nthe shell sloughs off piecemeal, as it does in the cray‐fish. The greatest\r\nmystery of all, perhaps, is the process by which the lobster withdraws the\r\nfleshy part of its claws from their calcareous covering. Fishermen say the\r\nlobster pines before casting its shell, and thus gets thin, so as to\r\npermit of its withdrawing its members from it.” He sheds tears first, and\r\nshell second.\r\n\r\nThe common English lobster, as seen in the fishmonger’s shop, is very\r\nunlike his relatives beneath the waves. “The curled‐up form,” says Major\r\nLord, “in which he is seen when so exposed is not that usually assumed in\r\nhis own element, except in the act of exerting its immense powers of\r\nretrograde motion. These are so great that one sudden downward sweep of\r\nits curiously‐constructed oar‐like tail is sufficient to send it like an\r\narrow, three or four and twenty feet, with the most extraordinary\r\nprecision, thereby enabling our friend to retreat with the greatest\r\nrapidity into nooks, corners, and crevices among the rocks, where pursuit\r\nwould be hopeless. His eyes being arranged on foot‐stalks, or stems, are\r\nfree from the inconvenient trammels of sockets, and possess a radius of\r\nvision commanding both front and rear, and from their compound form (being\r\nmade up of a number of square lenses) are extremely penetrating and\r\npowerful. The slightest shadow passing over the pool in which the lobster\r\nmay chance to be crawling or swimming will frequently cause one of these\r\nbackward shoots to be made, and the lobster vanishes into some cleft or\r\ncavity with a rapidity of motion which no harlequin could ever, in his\r\nwildest dreams, hope to achieve. Down among the deep channels, between the\r\ncrags at the sea’s bottom, alarms, except from the sea‐robbers themselves,\r\nare not to be dreaded. Here the lobsters are at home, and in such spots\r\nthe wicker trap, or the trunk net, may be laid down for them: nets of this\r\nkind are in general use. They are made by fastening a number of stout\r\nwooden hoops to longitudinal bars, and covering them with network. Their\r\ninternal construction is much like that of the crab‐pot, only there are\r\ntwo entrances instead of one, and twine is used instead of willows or\r\ntwigs to prevent the prisoners from escaping. Heavy stones are attached to\r\nthem as sinkers. Fish offal is used as bait, and corks at the end of lines\r\nserve to point out their position and haul them up by. Lobsters are\r\nprolific creatures, and it is well that they are so, considering the\r\nenormous quantities consumed every day in England alone.\r\n\r\n“It has been computed that each fully‐matured female will produce from\r\n18,000 to 20,000 eggs, and there is little doubt but that with proper\r\nmanagement and the expenditure of a very small capital artificial\r\nfecundation of the ova might be most successfully and profitably conducted\r\nin this country. Much attention has of late been paid to this subject in\r\nFrance, and many most interesting experiments in connection with it have\r\nbeen tried. The number of lobsters brought every season to Billingsgate\r\nMarket will serve to give some idea of the importance of lobster fishing,\r\nand the sums of money which must change hands in connection with it.\r\nCalculations show that from the coasts of England, Ireland, Scotland, and\r\nthe Channel Islands 150,000 lobsters per season reach Billingsgate,\r\nexclusive of the supply of Norway lobsters, which are even more abundantly\r\nsupplied, over 600,000 per season being imported. It not unfrequently\r\nhappens that one day’s supply for that great emporium of sea dainties\r\nreaches as high as 25,000, and here at early morning, long before mighty\r\nLondon is fairly up for the day, a scene of bustle and activity may be\r\nwitnessed which well repays the early riser. Steam in clouds floats above\r\nthe vast loads of newly‐boiled crustaceans and molluscs; and carts of\r\nevery size and pattern block the way.”\r\n\r\nThe regular lobster season lasts from the month of March to August. About\r\nthe middle or latter end of the last‐mentioned month the shifting of\r\nshells takes place, and the fish is unfit for human food; but, like the\r\nsilkworms after a change of skin, they commence feeding in the most\r\nvoracious manner directly the new garment is durable enough to admit of\r\ntheir taking their walks abroad, and their temporary seclusion and\r\ncompulsory abstinence are amply made up by a course of heavy feeding. The\r\nlost plumpness and condition soon return. Unlike some crustaceans who are\r\ncoldly indifferent to the welfare of their offspring, the mamma lobster\r\nkeeps her little brood about her until the youthful lobsterkins are big\r\nenough to start in life for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe coasts of British North America, as well as many portions of the\r\nseaboard of the United States, abound in mail‐clad inhabitants of many\r\nkinds. In some localities great amusement is at times afforded by their\r\ncapture—a sort of picnic, or lobster frolic, being organised. A boat, with\r\nplenty of eatables and drinkables, and a capacious pot, are provided, and\r\nlong poles with their ends split prepared. On the boat being propelled\r\nslowly through the shallow water, a sharp look‐out is kept on the regions\r\nbelow, and on the lobster being discovered, the split end of the pole is\r\nlowered quietly, and with the greatest caution, until just over the\r\nunsuspecting victim’s back, when by a sudden downward thrust the forceps‐\r\nlike instrument securely nips him, and he is brought to the surface in\r\nspite of his claws and the pinches he inflicts on the tough, unyielding\r\nwood. Some overhanging rock or pleasant nook on the shore is usually\r\nselected as a place in which to dine and cook the proceeds of the lobster\r\nhunt.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: LOBSTER (_Homarus vulgaris_) AND PRAWNS (_Palæmon\r\n                               serratus_).]\r\n\r\nThe bays, shallows, and mouths of rivers on the coast of Prince Edward’s\r\nIsland abound in a species of seaweed known amongst the inhabitants as\r\n“eel‐grass,” on which vast numbers of lobsters feed as in a rich sea‐\r\ngarden. To these favoured hunting grounds the lobster‐catchers betake\r\nthemselves, and by wading little more than half‐leg deep gather as many as\r\nthey require. A bushel basket has been filled in this way in less than an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nLike the branching growths of submarine life which form the connecting\r\nlink between the vegetable and animal kingdoms, we find crustaceans\r\ndwelling, so to speak, on the border‐lands of other races, and linking the\r\nshrimp, crab, and lobster families together; partaking of the nature of\r\neach, but being identical with neither; such are the so‐called _Squat\r\nLobsters_, or _Galathea_. Their singular alertness renders capture\r\nsomewhat difficult. Like the lobster, they possess extraordinary powers of\r\nvision and retrograde movement. The horns are extremely long, and so\r\nsensitive that the slightest touch seems to reveal at once the nature of\r\nan approaching object, and enables the alarmed squat to seek a safe\r\nsanctuary between the rock clefts, from which it is by no means easy to\r\nwithdraw him.\r\n\r\nThe _spined lobster_, _crawfish_, _cray_, or _crowder_, will, from its\r\nthorn‐coated shell, long horns, powerful nippers, and generally formidable\r\nappearance, be familiar to most of our readers. Like most other\r\ncrustaceans, the cray delights in a home among rugged sunken rocks, and is\r\ntaken in the traps laid for ordinary lobsters and crabs. Their flesh,\r\nbeing of harder texture and sweeter flavour, is objected to by professed\r\nlobster‐eaters; still, a well‐conditioned spined lobster is by no means to\r\nbe despised. Some portions of the Pacific Ocean, and the warm seas of the\r\nEast, contain them in vast numbers. Many spots on the coast of South\r\nAmerica, and the bays and inlets of the island of Juan Fernandez,\r\nliterally swarm with them. Some idea may be formed of the abundance of\r\nanimated creatures of this and other kinds to be taken in these seas by\r\nthe following account of the fishing to be obtained in them, given by the\r\nHon. F. Walpole:—“The fishing afforded the best return for labour, and a\r\nboat might be filled in four hours with hook and line only. Fish swarmed\r\nof every size and colour, and seemingly of every variety of appetite, for\r\nthey took any bait. The bottom was literally lined with crawfish of a\r\nlarge size; some must have weighed five pounds at least. There needed no\r\nhook—a piece of anything let down on a string to the bottom was enough;\r\nthey saw it, grasped it, and kept their hold till you had seized them by\r\ntheir long feelers and borne them into the boat, where they crawled about\r\nand extended their feelers as if in search of more bait.... We had\r\ncrawfish for breakfast, crawfish for dinner, crawfish for supper, and\r\ncrawfish for any incidental meal we could cram in between.” The coral\r\nreefs fringing the island of Mauritius afford shelter to numbers of the\r\nfamily of crawfish, which in both size and splendour of colouring far\r\nexcel those taken in our seas.\r\n\r\nThe prawn and shrimp are included in the same order as the lobster and the\r\ncrab, and species of these crustaceans are found in all seas. They are the\r\nscavengers of the ocean, and pick and devour any dead matter in the sea;\r\nhence they are particularly valuable in the aquarium. The art of shrimping\r\nwill no doubt be familiar to all our readers, from visits made to our\r\nsouth‐coast watering‐places. In tropical climates the prawn attains the\r\nsize of a small lobster—up to nine or ten inches in length, three being\r\nconsidered sufficient for a meal. Prawns are sold in Dublin six and seven\r\ninches in length, and are considered splendid feeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   OCEAN LIFE.—THE HARVEST OF THE SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Fishes and their Swimming Apparatus—The Bladder—Scientific\r\n     Classification—Cartilaginous Fish—The Torpedo—A Living Galvanic\r\n    Battery—The Shark—His Love for Man in a Gastronomic Sense—Stories\r\n        of their Prowess—Catching a Shark—Their Interference with\r\n     Whaling—The Tiger‐Shark—African Worship of the Monster—The Dog‐\r\n     fish—The Sturgeon—Enormous Fecundity—Caviare—The Bony Fishes—The\r\n     Flying Fish: its Feats; its Enemies—Youth of a Salmon—The Parr,\r\n       the Smolt, and the Grilse—Flourishes in the Sea—The Ponds at\r\n      Stormontfield—The Salmon’s Enemies—The Ettrick Shepherd—Canned\r\n         Salmon, and where it comes from—The Fish a Drug in N.

The fish must have their\r\nturn in a work treating of their natural home, the ocean.(43) Fishes,\r\nintended always to live in water, have wonderful organs to aid them in\r\nswimming. “The anterior limbs,” says Figuier, “which correspond with the\r\narms in man and the wings in birds, are attached to each side of the\r\ntrunk, immediately behind the head, and form the pectoral fins. The\r\nposterior limbs occupy the lower surface of the body, and form the ventral\r\nfins. The latter, which are always over the ventral line, may be placed\r\nbefore, beneath, or, as is most usual, behind the former. Fishes possess,\r\nbesides these two pair of fins, odd fins. The fins which are found on the\r\nback or dorsum are called the back or dorsal fins, those at the end of the\r\ntail are the caudal fins; finally, there is frequently another attached to\r\nthe lower extremity of the body, which is called the anal fin. These fins\r\nare always nearly of the same structure, consisting generally of a fold of\r\nthe skin, supported by slender, flexible, cartilaginous, or osseous rays,\r\nconnected by a thin membrane.” The muscles which move these fins are\r\npowerful. Further, nearly all species of fish possess a swimming bladder,\r\nover which the animal has control, and can thereby increase or diminish\r\nthe specific gravity of its body. Immediately behind the head are the gill\r\nopenings; respiration is effected by water, in its natural state always\r\ncharged with air, being taken in at the mouth, which passes over the\r\ngills, and is afterwards ejected. The eyes in fish are usually very large.\r\n\r\nThe scientific classification of fishes usually adopted is that of Muller.\r\nHe divided them into five groups, the _Leptocardia_, _Cyclostomata_,\r\n_Selachia_, _Ganoidea_, and _Teleostea_. The first of these is represented\r\nby a single genus, _Amphioxus_, a little slender gelatinous fish, rarely\r\nover two inches in length, and commonly found on all sandy coasts. The\r\nsecond order is characterised as serpentine, void of fins, and with a\r\nmouth formed for suction. The lamprey is a familiar example.\r\n\r\nThe third order, _Selachia_, includes a number of cartilaginous fish,\r\nvarying much in form; the rays, dog‐fish, skate, torpedo, shark, and saw‐\r\nfish belong to this important division. The torpedo has the power of\r\ngiving a strong electrical shock. Redi, an Italian naturalist of the\r\nseventeenth century, first studied them carefully. He caught and landed an\r\nelectric ray, and pressing it with his hand, experienced a tingling\r\nsensation, which extended to his arms and shoulders, and was followed by a\r\ndisagreeable trembling. This electric power dies with the animal. Dr.\r\nWalsh made some interesting experiments with them. He placed a living\r\ntorpedo on a clean wet towel, and connected brass wires with it. Round the\r\ntorpedo were eight persons, standing on isolating substances. One end of\r\nthe wire was placed in a basin full of water. The first person had a\r\nfinger of one hand in this basin, and a finger of the other in a second\r\nbasin, also full of water. The second person had a finger in the last‐\r\nnamed basin, and a finger of the other hand in a third basin, and so on\r\nround the circle of eight persons. The end of the second wire was plunged\r\ninto the last basin of the series, thus establishing a complete electric\r\ncircuit. At the moment when the experimenter touched the torpedo a\r\ntolerably strong shock was felt by all participating. When the torpedo was\r\nplaced on an isolated supporter, it showed its energy by communicating to\r\nseveral persons forty or fifty shocks in the short space of a minute and a\r\nhalf.\r\n\r\nThe family _Carcharidæ_ includes the true sharks, some species of which\r\nattain to a length of twenty, or even thirty, feet. They are the terror of\r\nall other fish and molluscs. “But the prey which has the greatest charm\r\nfor him is man; the shark loves him dearly, but it is with the affection\r\nof the gourmand. If we may believe some travellers, when several varieties\r\nof human food comes in its way, the shark prefers the European to the\r\nAsiatic, and both to the negro.” He has been known to jump clean aboard a\r\nfisherman’s boat, and even to snap up a sailor from the shrouds. Commerson\r\nrelates the following:—The corpse of a negro had been suspended from a\r\nyard‐arm _twenty feet_ above the level of the sea. A shark was seen making\r\nevery effort to reach the body, which eventually he did, and tore it limb\r\nfrom limb in presence of the horror‐stricken crew. The mouth of the shark\r\nis placed in the lower part of the head, and the animal has to turn itself\r\nin the water before he can seize an object above him. On the African coast\r\nthe negroes take advantage of this fact; they swim towards him, and seize\r\nthe moment when he turns to rip up his belly with a large strong knife.\r\nThe adult shark has six rows of murderous‐looking teeth, forming a perfect\r\narsenal of deadly weapons.\r\n\r\nCaptain Basil Hall describes the mode by which sharks are sometimes\r\ncaptured. “The sharp‐curved dorsal fin of a huge shark was seen rising\r\nabout six inches above the water, and cutting the glazed surface of the\r\nsea by as fine a line as if a sickle had been drawn along it. ‘Messenger,\r\nrun to the cook for a piece of pork,’ cried the captain, taking the\r\ncommand with as much glee as if an enemy’s cruiser had been in sight.\r\n‘Where’s your hook, quartermaster?’ ‘Here, sir, here,’ cried the fellow,\r\nfeeling the point, and declaring it was as sharp as any lady’s needle, and\r\nin the next instant piercing with it a huge junk of pork weighing four or\r\nfive pounds. The hook, which is as large as one’s little finger, has a\r\ncurvature about as large as a man’s hand when half closed, and is six or\r\neight inches in length, while a formidable line, furnished with three or\r\nfour feet of chain attached to the end of the mizen topsail halyard, is\r\nnow cast into the ship’s wake.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes the very instant the bait is cast over the stern the shark\r\nflies at it with such eagerness that he actually springs partially out of\r\nthe water. This, however, is rare. On these occasions he gorges the bait,\r\nthe hook, and a foot or two of the chain, without any mastication, and\r\ndarts off with the treacherous prize with such prodigious velocity that it\r\nmakes the rope crack again as soon as the coil is drawn out. Much\r\ndexterity is required in the hand which holds the line at this moment. A\r\nbungler is apt to be too precipitate, and jerk away the hook before it has\r\ngot far enough into the shark’s stomach. The secret of the sport is to let\r\nthe monster gulp down the whole bait, and then to give the line a violent\r\npull, by which the barbed point buries itself in the coat of the stomach.\r\nWhen the hook is first fixed it spins out like the log‐line of a ship\r\ngoing twelve knots.\r\n\r\n“The suddenness of the jerk with which the shark is brought up often turns\r\nhim quite over. No sailor, however, thinks of hauling one on board merely\r\nby the rope fastened to the hook. To prevent the line breaking, the hook\r\nsnapping, or the jaw being torn away, a running bowline is adopted. This\r\nnoose is slipped down the rope and passed over the monster’s head, and is\r\nmade to join at the point of junction of the tail with the body; and now\r\nthe first part of the fun is held to be completed. The vanquished enemy is\r\neasily drawn up over the taffrail, and flung on deck, to the delight of\r\nthe crew.” Even then he is sometimes a very formidable enemy. The flesh of\r\nthe shark, though sometimes eaten, is coarse and leathery.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: THE COMMON SHARK (_Carcharias vulgaris_).]\r\n\r\nOn several of the smaller islands of the Spanish Main whaling stations are\r\nestablished. After the huge fish have been captured, they are towed by the\r\nboats to one of these stations, and the blubber is stripped off and\r\ncarried on shore to the boiling‐house in large white blocks, where a\r\nsimple apparatus is set up for “trying‐out” the oil. It sometimes happens\r\nthat immediately after the whale has been killed the sharks surround it in\r\nsuch numbers, and devour the blubber with such rapacity, that if the\r\ndistance be great and the currents adverse, the greater part has been\r\neaten off before the whale can be towed ashore; and the labour of the\r\nfishermen is thus thrown away.\r\n\r\nThe tiger‐shark is a more formidable monster than others of its tribe,\r\nbecause of its power of seizing its prey without turning on its back or\r\nside. It is enabled to do this from the great size of its mouth, and from\r\nits position, which is near the end of the snout, instead of underneath,\r\nas in other varieties of the shark.\r\n\r\n“As soon as the carcase of the whale has been stripped of its blubber, it\r\nis towed out at high water to a sufficient distance from the station to\r\nensure of its being carried away by the falling tide. This is necessary,\r\nfor the stench from so large a mass of putrefying flesh, exposed as it has\r\nbeen to the intense action of a tropical sun for three or four days, is\r\nmore than unpleasant.\r\n\r\n“Now is the opportunity for the shark‐hunters. They take possession of the\r\nremains, tow them to some convenient nook of the Bocas, as the channels\r\nbetween the islands are called, and there anchor them. All is now\r\nprepared, and nothing remains but eagerly and silently to watch for the\r\nassembly of the ravenous brutes to their midnight orgies.”\r\n\r\nThe liver of the shark yields a most valuable oil, largely used in the\r\ncolony as a substitute for cod‐liver oil. The liver of a shark fifteen\r\nfeet long will yield from twelve to sixteen gallons of oil.\r\n\r\nThe canoes used for shark‐hunting are some twenty feet in length. In the\r\nbow a deep groove is cut, to guide the rope after the fish has been\r\nstruck. A coil of fifteen fathoms of rope, carefully arranged under the\r\nthwarts, is secured at one end to a piece of strong chain, at the other\r\nend of which is a harpoon. A lance is kept on board to assist in giving\r\nthe _coup de grâce_ to the shark when he has exhausted himself\r\nsufficiently.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of many parts of the African coasts worship the shark, and\r\nconsider its stomach the road to heaven. Three or four times a year they\r\nrow out and offer the shark poultry and goats to satisfy his appetite.\r\nThis is not all; a child is once a year sacrificed to the monster, which\r\nhas been specially fattened for this occasion from its birth to the age of\r\nten. On the _fête_ day, the unfortunate little victim is bound to a post\r\non a sandy point at low water; as the tide rises the sharks arrive. The\r\nchild may shriek, and the mother may weep, but it is of no avail; even its\r\nown parent thinks that the horrible sacrifice will ensure her child’s\r\nentry into heaven.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: THE DOG‐FISH (_Acanthias vulgaris_).]\r\n\r\nThe dog‐fish—from which we derive the skin known as _shagreen_, used for\r\nspectacle and other cases—the furious and voracious hammerhead, and the\r\nsaw‐fish, belong to the same great order. The last named will attack any\r\ninhabitant of the deep whatever, and even dares to measure his strength\r\nwith the whale. Its length is from twelve to fifteen feet, while its\r\nweapon of defence is sometimes as much as two yards in length.\r\nOccasionally it dashes itself against the side of a ship with such fury as\r\nto leave its sword broken in the timber.\r\n\r\nOf the fourth great order, _Ganoidea_, the sturgeon is the most prominent\r\nexample. It is essentially a sea‐fish, although ascending rivers at stated\r\nperiods, as does the salmon. It is particularly noticeable for the number\r\nof bony plates or scales on its back and belly. In the sea the sturgeon\r\nfeeds on herrings, mackerel, and other fish; in the rivers on salmon. It\r\nis caught in traps, or in nets. The prepared roe, cleaned, washed in\r\nvinegar, and partially dried, is the caviare of the Russians. The eggs of\r\na female sturgeon will weigh over one‐third of its entire body, and as\r\nthey sometimes reach a weight of nearly 3,000 pounds, the preparation of\r\ncaviare becomes an important and profitable industry.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: THE GLOBE‐FISH (_Tetrodon_) AND SUN‐FISH (_Orthagoriscus\r\n                                 mola_).]\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: THE PIPE FISH (_Syngnathus acus_).]\r\n\r\nThe fifth order, _Teleostea_, or bony fishes, constitutes a lengthy\r\nseries. Among it must be placed the globular and phosphorescent sun‐fish,\r\nthe spiny globe‐fish, the bony trunk‐fish, and the cuirassed pipe‐fish,\r\nthe sea‐horse, which has a head not unlike a horse, and floats vertically,\r\nthe flying‐fish, the eels, herrings, salmon, carp, cod, flat‐fish,\r\nmullets, tunnies, and others too numerous to mention. It is for man’s\r\npurposes the most important of all the orders.\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: THE FLYING‐FISH (_Exocœtus exiliens_.)]\r\n\r\nThe flying‐fish have been incidentally mentioned before in this work.\r\nCaptain Basil Hall observed a flight of 200 yards; they have come on board\r\na vessel fourteen or fifteen feet, and into the chains of a line‐of‐battle\r\nship twenty feet above the water. They are considerably harassed by the\r\nattacks of other fish, and when they take to the air often fall victims to\r\ngulls and other sea‐birds. Sharks and dolphins are their particular\r\nenemies. Their glittering, silvery brilliancy is most beautiful in the\r\nbrightness of tropical seas.\r\n\r\nAmong the most important bony fishes must certainly be first placed the\r\nsalmon, which includes three well‐known species, _Salmo salar_ (the salmon\r\nitself), _S. fario_ (the salmon trout), and _S. trutta_ (the trout). The\r\nearly life of the salmon is interesting. The infant fry is primarily, of\r\ncourse, very helpless, and during the first two or three weeks of its\r\nexistence carries about with it, as a provision for food, a portion of the\r\nyolk of the egg from which it was hatched. This generally lasts it from\r\ntwenty to forty days. It is two years before the youngster ventures out to\r\nsea. In the first stage the young salmon is called a _parr_; during the\r\nsecond it is a _smolt_, _i.e._, a parr plus a covering of silvery scales.\r\nThe smolt, which in the course of its two or more years’ stay in the river\r\nhas only attained a growth of six or eight inches, returns from the sea in\r\na couple of months weighing three or four pounds, and after six months ten\r\nor twelve pounds. It is now a _grilse_.\r\n\r\nDr. Bertram says of the salmon’s growth:—\r\n\r\n“The sea‐feeding must be favourable, and the condition of the fish well\r\nsuited to the salt‐water to ensure such rapid growth—a rapidity which\r\nevery visit of the fish to the ocean serves but to confirm. Various fish,\r\nwhilst in the grilse state, have been marked to prove this; and at every\r\nmigration they returned to their breeding‐stream with added weight and\r\nimproved health. What the salmon feeds upon whilst in the salt‐water is\r\nnot well known, as the digestion of the fish is so rapid as to prevent the\r\ndiscovery of food in their stomachs when they are captured and opened.\r\nGuesses have been made, and it is likely that these approximate to the\r\ntruth; but the old story of the rapid voyage of the salmon to the North\r\nPole and back again turns out, like the theory upon which was built up the\r\nherring migration romance, to be a mere myth.\r\n\r\n“None of our naturalists have yet attempted to elucidate that mystery of\r\nsalmon life which converts one‐half of the fish into sea‐going smolts,\r\nwhilst as yet the other moiety remain as parr. It has been investigated so\r\nfar at the breeding‐ponds at Stormontfield, but without resolving the\r\nquestion. There is another point of doubt as to salmon life which I shall\r\nalso have a word to say about—namely, whether or not that fish makes two\r\nvisits annually to the sea; likewise, whether it be probable that a smolt\r\nremains in the salt water for nearly a year before it becomes a grilse. A\r\nsalmon only stays, as it is popularly supposed, a very short time in the\r\nsalt water; and as it is one of the quickest‐swimming fishes we have, it\r\nis able to reach a distant river in a very short space of time, therefore\r\nit is most desirable we should know what it does with itself when it is\r\nnot migrating from one water to the other; because, according to the\r\nopinion of some naturalists, it would speedily become so deteriorated in\r\nthe river as to be unequal to the slightest exertion....\r\n\r\n“At every stage of its career the salmon is surrounded by enemies. At the\r\nvery moment of spawning, the female is watched by a horde of devourers,\r\nwho instinctively flock to the breeding‐grounds in order to feast on the\r\nova. The hungry pike, the lethargic perch, the greedy trout, the very\r\nsalmon itself, are lying in wait, all agape for the palatable roe, and\r\ngreedily swallowing whatever quantity the current carries down. Then the\r\nwaterfowl eagerly pounces on the precious deposit the moment it has been\r\nforsaken by the fish; and if it escape being gobbled up by such\r\ncormorants, the spawn may be washed away by a flood, or the position of\r\nthe bed may be altered, and the ova be destroyed, perhaps for want of\r\nwater. As an instance of the loss incidental to salmon‐spawning in the\r\nnatural way, I may just mention that a whiting of about three‐quarters of\r\na pound weight has been taken in the Tay with three hundred impregnated\r\nsalmon ova in its stomach! If this fish had been allowed to dine and\r\nbreakfast at this rate during the whole of the spawning season it would\r\nhave been difficult to estimate the loss our fisheries would have\r\nsustained by his voracity. No sooner do the eggs ripen, and the young fish\r\ncome to life, than they are exposed, in their defenceless state, to be\r\npreyed upon by all the enemies already enumerated; while, as parr, they\r\nhave been taken out of our streams in such quantities as to be available\r\nfor the purpose of pig‐feeding and manure! Some economists estimate that\r\nonly one egg out of every thousand becomes a full‐sized salmon. Mr. Thomas\r\nTod Stoddart calculated that 150,000,000 of salmon ova are annually\r\ndeposited in the river Tay; of which only 50,000,000, or one‐third, come\r\nto life and attain the parr stage; that 20,000,000 of these parr become in\r\ntime smolts, and that their number is ultimately diminished to 100,000; of\r\nwhich 70,000 are caught, the other 30,000 being left for breeding\r\npurposes. Sir Humphry Davy calculated that if a salmon produced 17,000\r\nroe, only 800 of these would arrive at maturity. It is well, therefore,\r\nthat the female fish yields 1,000 eggs for each pound of her weight; for a\r\nlesser degree of fecundity, keeping in view the enormous waste of life\r\nindicated by these figures, would long since—especially taking into\r\naccount the destructive modes of fishing that used a few years ago to be\r\nin use—have resulted in the extinction of this valuable fish.\r\n\r\n“The first person who ‘took a thought about the matter’—_i.e._, as to\r\nwhether the parr was or was not the young of the salmon—and arrived at a\r\nsolid conclusion, was James Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd, who, in his usual\r\nimpulsive way, proceeded to verify his opinions. He had, while herding\r\nsheep, many opportunities of watching the fishing streams, and, like most\r\nof his class, he wielded his fishing‐rod with considerable skill. While\r\nangling in the tributaries of some of the Border salmon‐streams, he had\r\noften caught the parr as it was changing into the smolt, and had, after\r\nclose observation, come to the conclusion that the little parr was none\r\nother than the infant salmon. Mr. Hogg did not keep his discovery a\r\nsecret, and the more his facts were controverted by the naturalists of the\r\nday the louder became his proclamations. He had suspected all his life\r\nthat parr were salmon in their first stage. He would catch a parr with a\r\nfew straggling scales upon it; he would look at this fish, and think it\r\nqueer; instantly he would catch another, a little better covered with\r\nsilver scales, but all loose, and not adhering to the body. Again, he\r\nwould catch a smolt, manifestly a smolt, all covered with the white silver\r\nscales, yet still rather loose upon the skin, which would come off in his\r\nhand. Removing these scales, he found the parr with the blue finger‐marks\r\nbelow them, and that the fish were young salmon then became as manifest to\r\nthe shepherd as that a lamb, if suffered to live, would become a sheep.\r\nWondering at this, he marked a great number of the lesser fish, and\r\noffered rewards (characteristically enough, of whisky) to the peasantry to\r\nbring him such as had evidently undergone the change predicted by him.\r\nWhen this conclusion was settled in his mind, the Shepherd at once\r\nproclaimed his new‐gained knowledge. ‘What will the fishermen of Scotland\r\nthink’ said he, ‘when I assure them, on the faith of long experience and\r\nobservation, and on the word of one who can have no interest in instilling\r\nan untruth into their minds, that every insignificant parr with which the\r\ncockney fisher fills his basket is a salmon lost!’ These crude attempts of\r\nthe impulsive Shepherd of Ettrick—and he was hotly opposed by the late Mr.\r\nBuist, of Stormontfield—were not without their fruits; indeed, they were\r\nso successful as quite to convince him that parr were young salmon in\r\ntheir first stage.”\r\n\r\nThe following amusing dialogue on the habits of the salmon once took place\r\nbetween the Ettrick Shepherd and a friend:—\r\n\r\n“_Shepherd_:—‘I maintain that ilka saumon comes aye back again frae the\r\nsea till spawn in its ain water.’\r\n\r\n“_Friend_:—‘Toots, toots, Jamie! hoo can it manage till do that? Hoo, in\r\nthe name o’ wonder, can a fish, travelling up a turbid water frae the sea,\r\nknow when it reaches the entrance to its birthplace, or that it has\r\narrived at the tributary that was its cradle?’\r\n\r\n“_Shepherd_:—‘Man, the great wonder to me is no hoo the fish get back, but\r\nhoo they find their way till the sea first ava, seein’ that they’ve never\r\nbeen there afore!’”\r\n\r\nThe canned salmon, now generally popular in England, and which, though\r\nsome few years ago an expensive luxury, is now within the reach of all,\r\ncomes principally from the Columbia River, Oregon, and other parts of the\r\nNorth Pacific coasts. In North‐Western America the fish is a perfect drug\r\nin the market. In a city like San Francisco it sells for eight cents (4d.)\r\nper pound. Higher up the coast a large fish is obtained for a quarter to\r\nhalf a dollar. Further north a piece of tobacco or a few needles will\r\npurchase a twenty or thirty pound salmon. They are so abundant that the\r\nwriter has seen them on the beaches of streams and creeks falling into\r\nFrazer River, British Columbia, by the score, bleeding, gasping, and\r\ndying, having literally crowded each other out of the water. “Schools” of\r\nthem are often so densely packed together, that they impede the progress\r\nof canoes and boats.\r\n\r\nThe salmon fisheries of the Columbia, Oregon, itself one of the grandest\r\nrivers in the world, give employment to 4,000 men during the season, and\r\nnearly all the canned salmon consumed in Europe comes from it.(44) There\r\nare dozens of rivers on the north‐west coast equally available, and the\r\nbusiness even now is in its infancy; while salted, pickled, or smoked\r\nsalmon, hardly ever reaches England from there at all. As will appear,\r\nthere are splendid opportunities on that coast for hundreds of new‐comers,\r\nit may almost be said with or without capital. It is needless to state\r\nthat the former is always to be preferred. Where isn’t it?\r\n\r\nSome ten or a dozen varieties of salmon and salmon‐trout, Mr. Murphy tells\r\nus, enter the rivers of North‐Western America, but only one is selected\r\nfor commercial purposes. Two of the most delicate‐eating varieties—the\r\nsilvery‐white and spring salmons—are never packed in tins, because their\r\nschools are less abundant and the fish themselves smaller. The hook‐nosed\r\nand dog salmons are rarely eaten, except by Indians; while the man has not\r\nyet been discovered who would tackle the hump‐back. The blue‐back, or\r\nweak‐toothed salmon, an inferior fish also, is only exported to the\r\nSandwich Islands, where the natives are said to really prefer its lean and\r\nfibrous flesh to the more delicately‐flavoured and succulent kinds. The\r\nsalmon principally caught is distinguished by the Indians as the “Tyhee,”\r\nor chief; it is abundant, large, and most excellent eating; it possesses\r\nthose “all‐round” qualifications which particularly fit it for commerce\r\nand cooking. It is the _Salmo quinnat_ of the naturalists.\r\n\r\nThe fishery season on the Columbia lasts from the beginning of April to\r\nthe end of July, and the fisheries extend along the river for a hundred\r\nmiles or more. Some of the curing establishments employ their own men to\r\ntend the nets, while others purchase from fishermen, the price for fish\r\nweighing from fifteen to forty pounds ranging from 25 cents to 50 cents\r\n(approximately one to two shillings). These prices would seem ridiculously\r\nlow were it not for the abundance of the fish and the ease with which they\r\nare taken. A party of four men may secure from 300 to 2,000 salmon in\r\ntwenty‐four hours! Take the lowest estimate—300 at 25 cents. This gives 75\r\ndollars (or £15) to divide among the four fishermen. But this would be a\r\nvery poor catch. A thousand fish are no uncommon haul. This at the lowest\r\nprice paid would give 250 dollars (£50) to be divided. Of course there is\r\nthe wear and tear of boat and fishing gear to be considered.\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of the fish are caught in weirs. The Indians, also,\r\nknowing that the salmon avoids currents if possible, build out into the\r\nriver from the shore, for ten or a dozen feet, walls of stone a few inches\r\nin height. The salmon crowd into the quieter water caused thereby, and are\r\neasily captured in nets or by spearing. They are so numerous in places\r\nthat the Indian can often flap them out of the water, by a sudden\r\ndexterous jerk of his paddle, to his squaw on the beach, who then\r\nimmediately knocks them on the head and guts them.\r\n\r\nAt the curing houses, mostly owned by Americans, the labour is chiefly\r\nperformed by Chinamen under the superintendence of white men. “John”\r\nquickly and cleverly guts the fish and cuts off its head; then cuts it\r\ninto chunks, which are boiled, first in salt and afterwards in fresh\r\nwater. Next the tins are filled, and soldered down, all but one little\r\nhole in their tops. The tins are then immersed in boiling water, and when\r\nevery particle of air is excluded, a few drops of solder effectually seal\r\nthem up till wanted for the table. The process is in effect the same\r\nemployed in the preservation of meats and fruits in tins.\r\n\r\nMany British and Irish waterfalls are celebrated for their salmon leaps.\r\nIn Inverness‐shire at Kilmorack, at Ballyshannon in Donegal, and Leixlip\r\nnear Dublin, in Pembrokeshire and elsewhere, the leaps are noted, and at\r\nmany of them there are osier baskets placed below to catch the fish when\r\nthey fail and fall. Sportsmen have even shot them, on the wing as it were,\r\nin their leap. At the Falls of Kilmorack “Lord Lovat conceived the idea of\r\nplacing a furnace and frying‐pan on a point of rock overhanging the river.\r\nAfter their unsuccessful effort some of the unfortunate salmon would fall\r\naccidentally into the frying‐pan. The noble lord could thus boast that the\r\nresources of his country were so abundant, that on placing a furnace and\r\nfrying‐pan on the banks of its rivers, the salmon would leap into it of\r\ntheir own accord, without troubling the sportsman to catch them. It is\r\nmore probable, however, that Lord Lovat knew that the way to enjoy salmon\r\nin perfection is to cook it when fresh from the water, and before the\r\nricher parts of the fish have ceased to curd.”\r\n\r\nIn our own land, the Tweed, Tay, Spey, and Severn, are all noted rivers\r\nfor salmon; the Tay fish sometimes weigh sixty pounds. It is a curious\r\nfact that the full‐grown salmon never feeds in the rivers. “Juvenile\r\nexperience on the part of the fish, recurring as a phantasm, causes them\r\nto snap at a shining artificial minnow or a gaudy fly, but they never rise\r\nout of the water; the bait must dip to them, and when hooked they shake\r\nthe intruder as a terrier does a rat.” Their superabundant store of fat\r\nenables them to live on themselves, as it were, as do the Asiatic and\r\nAfrican doomba sheep when avalanches and heavy snow‐falls stop their\r\nsupplies of herbage.(45) They become much thinner during their stay in\r\nfresh water; their colour becomes duller, and their flavour much\r\ndepreciated. Izaak Walton’s statement that “the further they get from the\r\nsea they be both fatter and better” is utterly erroneous, for they fatten\r\nonly in the sea. In March, 1845, the Duke of Athole took a ten‐pound\r\nsalmon in the Tay after it had spawned, and attached a medal to it and\r\nthen let it go to sea. The same individual, with its decoration, was\r\nfished up five weeks and a few days afterwards, when it had been to the\r\nrefreshing salt water. It had more than doubled its weight, for it weighed\r\ntwenty‐one pounds.\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: THE SALMON (_Salmo salar_).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\n            OCEAN LIFE.—THE HARVEST OF THE SEA (_concluded_).\r\n\r\n\r\n       The _Clupedæ_—The Herring—Its Cabalistic Marks—A Warning to\r\n    Royalty—The “Great Fishery”—Modes of Fishing—A Night with the Wick\r\n    Fishermen—Suicidal Fish—The Value of Deep‐sea Fisheries—Report of\r\n        the Commissioners—Fecundity of the Herring—No fear of Fish\r\n       Famine—The Shad—The Sprat—The Cornish Pilchard Fisheries—The\r\n            “Huer”—Raising the “Tuck”—A Grand Harvest—Gigantic\r\n         Holibut—Newfoundland Cod Fisheries—Brutalities of Tunny\r\n    Fishing—The Mackerel—Its Courage, and Love of Man—Garum Sauce—The\r\n    formidable Sword‐fish—Fishing by Torchlight—Sword through a Ship’s\r\n       side—General Remarks on Fish—Fish Life—Conversation—Musical\r\n              Fish—Pleasures and Excitements—Do Fish sleep?\r\n\r\n\r\nA great and important group of the bony fish is comprised under the family\r\nname _Clupedæ_. It includes such useful fish as the herring, pilchard,\r\nshad, and anchovy. The family is as interesting to the merchant as to the\r\ngastronomist.\r\n\r\nThe herring hardly needs description here, but it may just be remarked,\r\n_en passant_, that its back, indigo‐coloured after death, is greenish\r\nduring life. The curious markings often found on the herring have been\r\nconsidered by ignorant fishermen to signify mysterious words of cabalistic\r\nimport. On one November day, near three hundred years ago, two herrings\r\nwere caught on the coast of Norway, which bore marks resembling Gothic\r\nprinted characters. “They were presented to the then King of Norway,\r\nFrederick II., who was so frightened by the characters he saw on the backs\r\nof the innocent fish that he turned ghastly pale, for he thought that they\r\nannounced his approaching death and that of his queen.” A council of\r\n_savants_ was convened, and the learned ones solemnly reported that the\r\nwords implied, “Very soon you will cease to fish herrings, as well as\r\nother people.” Some more politic scientists gave another explanation, but\r\nit was useless, for the king died next year, and his late subjects became\r\nfirmly convinced that the two herrings had been celestial messengers\r\ncharged to announce that monarch’s sudden end.\r\n\r\nThe herring abounds in the entire Northern Ocean from the coasts of France\r\nand England to Greenland and Lapland. They are very gregarious, and travel\r\nin immense shoals, their appearance in any specified locality being\r\nuncertain and always sudden. On the coast of Norway the electric telegraph\r\nis used to announce to the fishing towns the approach of the shoals, which\r\ncan always be perceived at a distance by the wave they raise. In the\r\nfiords of Norway the herring fisheries are the principal means of\r\nexistence for the seaboard population. So in 1857 the paternal Norwegian\r\nGovernment laid a submarine cable round the coast 100 miles in length,\r\nwith stations ashore at intervals conveniently placed for the purpose of\r\nnotifying the fishermen. In Holland the industries of catching and curing\r\nthe fish are highly profitable; the fishery is in consequence known as\r\n“the great,” while whaling is known as the “small fishery.” To a simple\r\nDutch fisherman, George Benkel, who died in 1397, Holland owes the\r\nintroduction of the art of preserving and curing the herring. Two hundred\r\nyears after his death, the Emperor Charles V. solemnly ate a herring on\r\nhis tomb, as homage to the memory of the creator of a great national\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: THE HERRING (_Clupea harengus_).]\r\n\r\nIn our country there is also an important trade in the fish. Yarmouth\r\nsends out 400 vessels of from forty to sixty tons, the larger carrying a\r\ncrew of twelve. In 1857 three fishing boats of this seaport brought home\r\n3,762,000 fish. In Scotland the one town of Wick had a few years ago 920\r\nboats employed in the fisheries.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch use lines 500 feet in length, with fifty or more nets to each.\r\nThe upper part of these nets is buoyed with empty barrels or cork, while\r\nthey are kept down by lead or stone weights; they can be lowered by\r\nlengthening the cord to which the buoys are attached. The meshes of the\r\nnets are so arranged that if the herring is too small to be caught in the\r\nfirst meshes, he passes through and gets caught in the succeeding one. Dr.\r\nBertram went out in a Wick boat to the fishing grounds. He says:—“At last,\r\nafter a lengthened cruise, our commander, who had been silent for half an\r\nhour, jumped up and called to action. ‘Up men, and at them!’ was the order\r\nof the night. The preparations for shooting the nets at once began by\r\nlowering sail. Surrounding us on all sides was to be seen a moving world\r\nof boats; many with sails down, their nets floating in the water, and\r\ntheir crews at rest. Others were still flitting uneasily about, their\r\nskippers, like our own, anxious to shoot in the right place. By‐and‐by we\r\nwere ready; the ‘dog,’ a large inflated bladder to mark the far end of the\r\ntrain, is heaved overboard, and the nets, breadth after breadth, follow as\r\nfast as the men can pay them out, till the immense train is all in the\r\nwater, forming a perforated wall a mile long and many feet in depth, the\r\n‘dog’ and the marking bladder, floating and dipping in long zig‐zag lines,\r\nreminding one of the imaginary coils of the great sea‐serpent. After three\r\nhours of quietude beneath a beautiful sky, the stars—\r\n\r\n  “The eternal orbs that beautify the night”—\r\n\r\nbegan to pale their fires, and the grey dawn appearing indicated that it\r\nwas time to take stock. We found that the boat had floated quietly with\r\nthe tide till we were a long distance from the harbour. The skipper had a\r\npresentiment that there were fish in his net, and the bobbing down of a\r\nfew of the bladders made it almost a certainty; and he resolved to examine\r\nthe drifts. ‘Hurrah!’ exclaimed Murdoch of Skye; ‘there’s a lot of fish,\r\nskipper, and no mistake.’ Murdoch’s news was true; our nets were silvery\r\nwith herrings—so laden, in fact, that it took a long time to haul them in.\r\nIt was a beautiful sight to see the shimmering fish as they came up like a\r\nsheet of silver from the water, each uttering a weak death‐chirp as it was\r\nflung into the bottom of the boat. Formerly the fish were left in the\r\nmeshes of the net till the boat arrived in the harbour; but now, as the\r\nnet is hauled on board, they are at once shaken out. As our silvery\r\ntreasure showers into the boat, we roughly guess our capture at fifty\r\ncranes—a capital night’s work.” Wick boats are not, however, always so\r\nfortunate. The herring fleet has been overtaken more than once by fearful\r\nstorms, when valuable lives, boats, and nets, have been sacrificed.\r\n\r\nEarly in December, 1879, an apparent epidemic of suicide attacked the\r\nherrings and sprats in Deal Roads, and they rushed ashore in such myriads\r\nat Walmer that the fishermen got tired of carting them off, and they were\r\nleft on the beach for all who cared to help themselves. Nature seems now\r\nand then to put bounds to over‐population, but if this be the case, no\r\nherring famines need be feared, for economical Nature would never have\r\nplayed into the hands of the fishermen who are always at war with her.\r\nSuch wholesale suicides occur among other forms of animal life. In Africa\r\nregiments of ants have been seen deliberately marching into streams, where\r\nthey were immediately devoured by fish. Rats have migrated in myriads,\r\nstopping nowhere, neither day nor night, and have been preyed upon by both\r\nlarge birds and beasts of prey. In the Seychelles some years ago several\r\nhundred turtles conspired to die together on the island in front of the\r\nharbour, and carried out their decision. Were they the victims of\r\nhydrophobia, delirium tremens, or some other disease? Even the gay and\r\nsprightly butterfly has been known to migrate in immense clouds from the\r\nland straight out to sea, without the remotest chance of ever reaching\r\nanother shore. What could be the reason for such a suicidal act?\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to over‐estimate the value of deep sea fisheries; in\r\nwhich, according to trustworthy statistics, England and Wales alone employ\r\nnearly 15,000 boats, with nearly double that number of “hands,” added to\r\nwhom are over 14,000 others to whom they give occasional employment on the\r\ncoasts. The report of Commissioners Frank Buckland and Spencer Walpole,\r\nwho were instructed to investigate the modes of fishing in the two\r\ncountries named, and how far they were conducted on proper principles, has\r\ntherefore both importance and interest. It was feared that in certain\r\ndirections deep‐sea fishing, which undeniably leads to the capture of\r\nmyriads of young and useless fish, might have the same effect as wasteful\r\nfishing and dredging did in the case of the salmon and oyster.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners assure us that there is neither ground for alarm nor for\r\nlegislative interference. The beneficent sea is practically inexhaustible.\r\n“Bearing in mind,” wrote a commentator on the Report, “how much has been\r\nsaid regarding the wilful destruction of spawn, it is startling to hear\r\nthat nobody ‘has ever seen the eggs of soles, turbot, plaice, and other\r\nlike fish after their extrusion from the parent,’ while, with respect to\r\nthe finny tribe in general, the Commissioners add: ‘So far as we know,\r\nthere is, with one exception—herring spawn—no clearly‐established instance\r\nof the spawn of any edible fish being raised in a trawl net or taken in\r\nany other net.’ With these words one bugbear of the sea disappears.\r\nNature, whatever may be her shortcomings elsewhere, knows how to take care\r\nof herself here. She carries on her life‐giving processes beyond our\r\nreach, and is veiled in a mystery which even the keen observation of the\r\npresent time cannot penetrate, for the Commissioners remind us that,\r\ngenerally speaking, ‘little is known either of the seasons in which sea\r\nfish spawn or of the places in which the spawn is cast; still less of the\r\ntime which the spawn, after it is cast, takes to vivify.’ But if the spawn\r\nevades the power of man, the young fish are not so fortunate. It is\r\nunquestionable that an immense waste of fry of all kinds goes on round our\r\ncoasts. The trawler, the shrimper, the seine net, and the fixed engine,\r\ncombine against these little creatures, tons upon tons of which are\r\nannually destroyed. At first sight it would seem that a grave matter here\r\npresents itself. The Commissioners, however, proceed so to reason away its\r\nimportance that in the end it assumes very small dimensions indeed.\r\nStarting from the indisputable fact that all animals have ‘a tendency to\r\nincrease at a greater rate than their means of subsistence,’ Messrs.\r\nBuckland and Walpole go on to show that this especially applies to sea\r\nfish; and they take as an example the fecund herring. Assuming that the\r\nBritish waters contain sixty thousand millions of female herrings, each of\r\nwhich deposits twenty thousand eggs, it follows that the total number of\r\neggs which, but for natural and artificial checks, would come to maturity\r\nis twelve hundred millions of millions—an expression which is easy to put\r\non paper, but which the mind can no more comprehend than it can grasp the\r\nidea of eternity. Enough that these countless hordes, if compressed by\r\nfive hundreds into foot cubes, would build a wall round the earth two\r\nhundred feet broad and one hundred high. The inference from such\r\nastounding figures is that man’s destructiveness can do little. He takes\r\none herring for every half‐million of eggs, while the original stock would\r\nbe kept up were only one egg to mature out of ten thousand. All fish, it\r\nis true, are not as prolific as the herring, but the argument applies to\r\neach kind in its degree, and may be summed up generally by the statement\r\nthat the proportion of spawn and fry which must perish is so great as to\r\nreduce the operations of man to limits barely appreciable. On the\r\nimportant related question whether the supply of fish is decreasing, the\r\nCommissioners entertain no doubt whatever. They say, ‘so far from the\r\nstock of fish decreasing, we believe that the supply of fish, taken on the\r\nwhole, is at least as great as it has ever been; there are some reasons\r\nfor even thinking that it is actually increasing.’ On the other hand, they\r\nrefer to a general impression that the take of flat‐fish, such as soles\r\nand plaice, is becoming less; the local explanation referring almost\r\nuniversally to the destruction of fry. Yet while the Commissioners do not,\r\nexcept in the case of soles, contest the alleged decrease, they refuse to\r\nrecognise the assigned cause, nor, generally speaking, do they see any\r\nreason for legislative action of a restrictive nature.” The prospects of\r\nour ocean fishing, both as an industry and as a food supply, are,\r\ntherefore, encouraging. The harvest of the sea is constant, and though\r\nthere must be local fluctuations, the return for the labour of those “who\r\nreap where they have not sowed” is sure.\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: HERRING FISHING.]\r\n\r\nOf the shad, though not as commonly known as the herring, there are twenty\r\nknown species. In the season this fish regularly approaches the mouths of\r\ngreat rivers for the purpose of spawning. It is found in the spring in the\r\nRhine, Seine, Garonne, Volga, Elbe, and in many of our own rivers. In some\r\nIrish rivers the masses of shad taken have been so great that hardly any\r\namount of exertion has been sufficient to land the net. It sometimes\r\nattains a very considerable size, weighing from four to six pounds. The\r\nshad taken at sea is considered coarser eating than that caught in rivers.\r\n\r\nThe sprat has been by some taken for the young of the herring, and the\r\ncontroversy on the subject has at times waxed warm. Some anatomists\r\ndeclare that their peculiarities show no difference but size. It has a\r\nserrated belly, which Bertram looks upon as the tuck in the child’s frock,\r\na provision for growth. “The slaughter of sprats,” says he, “is as decided\r\na case of killing the goose with the golden eggs as the grilse slaughter\r\ncarried on in our salmon rivers.” But Figuier reminds that writer that the\r\nyoung herrings are caught without the serrated belly, and that the curer’s\r\npurchase is regulated by the sprat’s rough, and the herring’s smooth,\r\nbelly. Sprats are often so abundant as to be unsaleable, and are then\r\nactually used for manure.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: THE PILCHARD (_Clupea pilchardus_).]\r\n\r\nThe pilchard visits our coasts at all times, the leading fisheries being\r\nin Cornwall. Wilkie Collins has given us a lively and interesting picture\r\nof the “look‐out” for their approach and capture.(46) He says: “A stranger\r\nin Cornwall, taking his first walk along the cliffs in August, could not\r\nadvance far without witnessing what would strike him as a very singular\r\nand even alarming phenomenon. He would see a man standing on the extreme\r\nedge of a precipice just over the sea, gesticulating in a very remarkable\r\nmanner, with a bush in his hand, waving it to the right and to the left,\r\nbrandishing it over his head, sweeping it past his feet; in short, acting\r\nthe part of a maniac of the most dangerous description. It would add\r\nconsiderably to the stranger’s surprise if he were told that the insane\r\nindividual before him was paid for flourishing the bush at the rate of a\r\nguinea a week.(47) And if he advanced a little, so as to obtain a nearer\r\nview of the madman, and observed a well‐manned boat below turning\r\ncarefully to the right and left as the bush turned, his mystification\r\nwould probably be complete, and his ideas as to the sanity of the\r\ninhabitants would be expressed with grievous doubt.\r\n\r\n“But a few words of explanation would make him alter his opinion. He would\r\nlearn that the man was an important agent in the pilchard fishery of\r\nCornwall, that he had just discovered a shoal swimming towards the land,\r\nand that the men in the boats were guided by his gesticulations alone in\r\ntheir arrangements for securing the fish on which so many depend for a\r\nlivelihood.” These watchers are known locally as “huers.” They can easily\r\ndetect the approach of the shoals, as they darken the water, producing the\r\neffect of a cloud. As they approach the fish may themselves be seen\r\nleaping and playing on the surface by hundreds; sometimes they are so\r\nabundant that the fish behind force those in front ashore, and they are\r\ntaken by hand or in baskets.\r\n\r\nThe boats, each of about fifteen tons burden, carry a large, long seine\r\nnet, kept up by corks and down by lead. The grand object in the fishery,\r\nguided by the “huer” on the cliffs ashore, is to drive the shoals into\r\nshallow waters and bays.\r\n\r\n“The grand object is now to enclose the entire shoal. The leads sink one\r\nside of the net perpendicularly to the bottom, the corks buoy the other to\r\nthe surface of the water. When it has been taken all round the shoal, the\r\ntwo extremities are made fast, and the fish are imprisoned within an\r\noblong barrier of netting. The art is now to let as few of the pilchards\r\nescape as possible while the process is being completed. Whenever the\r\n‘huer’ observes that they are startled, and separating at any particular\r\npoint, he waves his bush, and thither the boat is steered, and there the\r\nnet is shot at once; the fish are thus headed and thwarted in every\r\ndirection with extraordinary address and skill. This labour completed, the\r\nsilence of intense expectation that has hitherto prevailed is broken,\r\nthere is a shout of joy on all sides—the shoal is secured.” The seine is\r\nnow regarded as a great reservoir of fish, and may remain in the water for\r\na week or more. The pilchards are collected from it in a smaller net known\r\nas the “tuck.” When this net has travelled round the whole circuit of the\r\nseine, everything is prepared for the great event—hauling the fish to the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n“Now all is excitement on sea and shore; every little boat in the place\r\nputs off crammed with idle spectators; boys shout, dogs bark, and the\r\nshrill voices of the former are joined by the deep voices of the\r\n‘seiners.’ There they stand, six or eight stalwart, sunburnt fellows,\r\nranged in a row in the seine‐boat, hauling with all their might at the\r\n‘tuck’‐net, and roaring out the nautical ‘Yo, heave ho!’ in chorus. Higher\r\nand higher rises the net; louder and louder shout the boys and the idlers;\r\nthe ‘huer,’ so calm and collected hitherto, loses his self‐possession, and\r\nwaves his cap triumphantly. ‘Hooray! hooray! Yoy—hoy, hoy! Pull away,\r\nboys! Up she comes! Here they are!’ The water boils and eddies; the\r\n‘tuck’‐net rises to the surface; one teeming, convulsed mass of shining,\r\nglancing, silvery scales, one compact mass of thousands of fish, each one\r\nof which is madly striving to escape, appears in an instant. Boats as\r\nlarge as barges now pull up in hot haste all round the nets, baskets are\r\nproduced by dozens, the fish are dipped up in them, and shot out, like\r\ncoals out of a sack, into the boats. Presently the men are ankle‐deep in\r\npilchards; they jump upon the benches, and work on till the boats can hold\r\nno more. They are almost gunwale under before they leave for the shore.”\r\nAt the little fishing cove of Trereen, Mr. Wilkie Collins tells us, 600\r\nhogsheads, each of 2,400 fish and upwards, were taken in little more than\r\na week.\r\n\r\nThe sardine also comes under the _Clupedæ_ family. It derives its\r\ncommercial name from Sardinia, but is found all over the Mediterranean,\r\nthe coast of Brittany, &c. On the latter coast the fish are caught in\r\nfloating nets, and arranged in osier baskets, layer after layer, each boat\r\nreturning to port when it has secured 25,000.\r\n\r\nSpace will not permit of more than a passing notice to the flat‐fish, or\r\n_Pleuronectidæ_. These fish swim by means of a caudal fin, and they can\r\nascend or descend in the water readily, but they cannot turn to right or\r\nleft with the same facility as other fish. Most flat‐fish, soles, turbot,\r\nflounders, and plaice, are taken by trawl nets. Some of the larger are\r\nspeared.\r\n\r\nThe holibut (or halibut) is a fish which attains a great size, sometimes\r\nas much as seven feet in length, and weighing 300 pounds. One brought to\r\nEdinburgh measured seven‐and‐a‐half feet in length by three feet in\r\nbreadth; it weighed 320 pounds. In Norway and Greenland a long cord, from\r\nwhich branch thirty or so smaller cords, each furnished with a barbed\r\nhook, is employed for their capture. The main cord is attached to floating\r\nplanks, which indicate the place where it is let down.\r\n\r\nThe _Gadidæ_ family includes some most important fish, commercially\r\nconsidered, such as the whiting, haddock, and cod, the general form and\r\npeculiarities of which are familiar to all.\r\n\r\nThe cod fish is a most voracious feeder, and is provided with a vast\r\nstomach; it eats molluscs, crabs, and small fish, and has been known even\r\nto swallow pieces of wood. It is essentially a sea fish, and is never seen\r\nin rivers. From the days of John Cabot, the English, French, Dutch, and\r\nAmericans have prosecuted the great fisheries on the banks of\r\nNewfoundland; 2,000 English vessels, manned by 32,000 seamen, are employed\r\nin the pursuit. The modern cod‐smack is clipper‐built, has large tank\r\nwells for carrying the fish alive, and costs about £1,500. The fish is\r\ntaken in nets, or by line. Bertram tells us that each man has a line of\r\nfifty fathoms in length, and attached to this are a hundred hooks, baited\r\nwith mussels, pieces of herring, or whiting. “On arriving at the fishing\r\nground, the fishermen heave overboard a cork buoy, with a flagstaff about\r\nsix feet in height attached to it. The buoy is kept stationary by a line,\r\ncalled the ‘pow end,’ reaching to the bottom of the water, where it is\r\nheld by a stone or grapnel fastened to the lower end. To the ‘pow end’ is\r\nalso fastened the fishing‐line, which is then paid out as fast as the boat\r\nsails, which may be from four to five knots an hour. Should the wind be\r\nunfavourable for the direction in which the crew wish to set the line,\r\nthey use the oars. When the line, or ‘taes,’ is all out, the end is\r\ndropped, and the boat returns to the buoy. The ‘pow’ line is hauled up\r\nwith the anchor and fishing‐line attached to it. The fishermen then haul\r\nin the line, with the fish attached to it. Eight hundred fish might be,\r\nand often have been, taken by eight men in a few hours by this operation;\r\nbut many fishermen say now that they consider themselves fortunate when\r\nthey get a fish on every fifth hook on an eight‐lined ‘taes’ line.” On our\r\nown coasts the cod is principally taken by deep‐sea lines, with many\r\nshorter lines depending from them armed with large hooks. One man has in\r\nten hours taken 400, and eight men have taken eighty score in one day off\r\nthe Doggerbank. The Norfolk and Lincoln coasts afford a large supply; the\r\nfish taken is stowed in well‐boats, and brought to Gravesend, whence they\r\nare transhipped into market boats and sent to Billingsgate. The store‐\r\nboats with their wells, through which the water circulates, cannot come\r\nhigher, as the fresh water of the Thames, and possibly some of that which\r\nis _not_ too fresh, would kill the fish.\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: THE COD (_Morrhua vulgaris_).]\r\n\r\nThe haddock is also taken with lines. In the village of Findhorn,\r\nMorayshire, large numbers of fine haddocks are dried and smoked with the\r\nfumes of hard wood and sawdust. Hence the term, “Finnan haddies,” which,\r\nwhen obtained, are the finest for gastronomic purposes, being of superior\r\nflavour.\r\n\r\nThe mackerel (_Scomber scombrus_) is a most valuable fish for man. The\r\ntunny, bonita, and mackerel have yielded immense supplies of excellent\r\nfood, the first‐named being esteemed in parts of France far above any\r\nother fish. It is called the salmon of Provence. They attain a far larger\r\ngrowth than the mackerel, specimens having been found of seven, eight, and\r\neven nine feet in length, and weighing up to 400 pounds. They are\r\nspecially abundant in the Mediterranean, where they are usually caught in\r\nnets. In Provence they are driven, much as are the pilchards in Cornwall,\r\ninto an enclosed space called the _madrague_, where at last the fish finds\r\nitself ensnared in shallow water. Then “the carnage commences. The unhappy\r\ncreatures,” says Figuier, “are struck with long poles, boat‐hooks, and\r\nother weapons. The tunny‐fishing presents a very sad spectacle at this its\r\nlast stage; fine large fish perish under the blows of a multitude of\r\nfishermen, who pursue their bloody task with most dramatic effect. The\r\nsight of the poor creatures, some of them wounded and half dead, trying in\r\nvain to struggle with their ferocious assailants, is very painful to see.\r\nThe sea red with blood, long preserves traces of this frightful\r\nslaughter.”\r\n\r\nThe bonita is principally a tropical fish, not unlike the mackerel, but\r\nmore than double its size. It is the great enemy of the flying‐fish, and\r\npossesses electrical or stinging powers, for any one attempting to hold\r\nthe living fish is violently shaken as in palsy, and one’s very tongue is\r\ntied, and unable to make more than a spasmodic sputter.\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: THE MACKEREL (_Scomber scombrus_).]\r\n\r\nThe mackerel is common to all European seas. It is the _macquereau_ of the\r\nFrench, the _macarello_ of the modern Romans, the _makril_ of the Swedes,\r\nthe _bretal_ of some parts of Brittany, the _scombro_ of the Venetians,\r\nthe _lacesto_ of the Neapolitans, and the _cavallo_ of the Spaniards. It\r\nis one of the most universally‐esteemed fish.\r\n\r\nThe mackerel is very voracious, and has courage enough to attack fish much\r\nlarger than itself. It will even attack man, and is said to love him,\r\ngastronomically speaking. A Norwegian bishop who lived in the sixteenth\r\ncentury records the case of a sailor attacked by a shoal of mackerel,\r\nwhile he was bathing. His companions came to the rescue; but though they\r\nsucceeded in driving off the fish, their assistance came too late; he died\r\na few hours afterwards.\r\n\r\nThis fish is generally taken by drift‐nets, usually 20 feet deep, and 120\r\nlong, well buoyed with cork, but without weights to sink them. The meshes\r\nare made of fine tarred twine. They are in their best condition in June\r\nand July. The ancients used to make a sauce piquant from their fat, which\r\nwas called _garum_, and sold for the equivalent of sixteen shillings the\r\npint. It was acrid and nauseous, but had the property of stimulating jaded\r\nappetites. Seneca charged it with destroying the coats of the stomach, and\r\ninjuring the health of the high livers of his day. A traveller of the\r\nsixteenth century, Pierre Belon, found it highly esteemed in\r\nConstantinople.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: FISHING FOR TUNNY OFF THE COAST OF PROVENCE.]\r\n\r\nThe formidable sword‐fish is also tolerable eating, especially when young,\r\nand there are fisheries for its capture in the Mediterranean. The\r\nfishermen of Messina and Reggio fish by night, using large boats carrying\r\ntorches, and a mast, at the top of which one of their number is stationed\r\nto announce the approach of their prey, which is harpooned by a man\r\nstanding in the bows. This fish attains a length of five or six feet, its\r\nsword forming three‐tenths of its length. It is one of the whale’s natural\r\nenemies, and it objects even to ships passing through its element. There\r\nare numerous cases cited of ship’s bottoms having been pierced by it. In\r\n1725, some carpenters having occasion to examine a ship just returned from\r\nthe tropics, found the sword of one of these animals buried in its lower\r\ntimbers. They averred that to drive a pointed iron bolt of the same size\r\nto the same depth would require eight or nine blows with a thirty‐pound\r\nhammer. It was further evident from the position of the weapon that the\r\nfish had followed the ship while under full sail; it had penetrated the\r\nmetal sheathing and three‐and‐a‐half inches of the timber.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: FISHING FOR SWORD‐FISH.]\r\n\r\nAnd now, before leaving the minor and intermediate types of ocean life for\r\nthe monsters of the deep, a few general observations may be permitted.\r\nPliny described 94 species of fish; Linnæus described 478; the scientists\r\nof to‐day know upwards of 13,000, one‐tenth of which are fresh‐water fish.\r\nThe reader will then understand why only a few of the more important,\r\nuseful, or curious have been described in these pages.\r\n\r\nA hard man of science once described fish‐life as “silent, monotonous, and\r\njoyless.” Modern science has disproved each and all of these statements.\r\nAs regards the first, there are species actually known which “indulge in\r\njews’‐harps, trumpets, and drums.... Musical fish are a fact of positive\r\nknowledge, for not only can they be heard in shoals thrumming their\r\njews’‐harps in unison, but other kinds have been taken in the very act of\r\ntrumpeting and drumming.” Bertram, as we have seen, speaks of the “death‐\r\nchirp” of the captured herring. The application of the telephone has\r\nproved that a fish, placed alone in some water, actually talked to itself!\r\nMr. S. E. Peal, in a letter to a scientific journal, tells us of a large\r\nfish, _Barbes macrocephalus_, which converses with a peculiar “cluck,” or\r\npersuasive sound, which may be heard as far as forty feet from the water.\r\nHe also mentions a bivalve of Eastern Assam which actually “sings loudly\r\nin concert.”\r\n\r\nHow fish‐life could be called monotonous and joyless will puzzle any one\r\nwho has watched them in a large aquarium, where their every movement tells\r\nof pleasure, or at least excitement. Imagine, then, their life in the\r\nocean itself. All around them is life—life in constant activity. The\r\nancients said, and Pliny assented to the dictum, that in the water might\r\nbe found anything or everything that was found out of it, and as much more\r\nbesides. Then there is the excitement of the chase, in which they may be\r\neither the pursued or the pursuers. “Not only,” said a writer in a leading\r\ndaily journal, “can they indulge themselves in running away from sharks,\r\nas we should do from tigers if they swarmed in the streets, in\r\ncontemplating the while the elephant of the seas sauntering along through\r\nhis domain, or finding diversion and instruction in the winged process of\r\nthe flying‐fish or the tree‐climbing of perch, the buffooneries of sun‐\r\nfish and pipe‐fish, the cunning artifices of the ‘angler‐fish,’ the\r\nelectric propensities of some, the luminosity of others, the venomous\r\nnature of these or the grotesque appearance of those—not only is all the\r\nvariety of experience to be found on the earth to be found also in the\r\nwater, but even in a wider range and a greater diversity. The sea floor is\r\nstrewn with marvels, and the rocks are instinct with wonders.” Fish‐life\r\nis, then, full of excitement and interest.\r\n\r\nAn accomplished ichthyologist, Mr. F. Francis, has stirred up the vexed\r\nquestion, “Do fish sleep?” Only a very few fish, the dog‐fish being one of\r\nthe few exceptions, can close their eyes at all. Still, on the other hand,\r\nsome human beings, and notably infants, can sleep with one or both eyes\r\nopen, while the hare is credited with being able to take his nap in the\r\nlatter condition. Fish would seem to require sleep from their constant\r\nactivity; but in actual fact, no scientific watcher has yet caught one\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MONSTERS OF THE DEEP.(48)\r\n\r\n\r\n       Mark Twain on Whales—A New Version of an Old Story—Whale as\r\n     Food—Whaling in 1670—The Great Mammal’s Enemy, the “Killer”—The\r\n             Animal’s Home—The So‐called Fisheries—The Sperm\r\n      Whale—Spermaceti—The Chase—The Capture—A Mythical Monster—The\r\n           Great Sea‐Serpent—Yarns from Norway—An Archdeacon’s\r\n        Testimony—Stories from America—From Greenland—Mahone Bay—A\r\n       Tropical Sea‐Serpent—What is the Animal?—Seen on a Voyage to\r\n    India—Off the Coast of Africa—Other Accounts—Professor Owen on the\r\n                         Subject—Other Theories.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years ago, when an invalid wrote to Mark Twain seeking advice as to\r\nthe value of fish as “brain food,” the answer of that humourist was plain\r\nindeed:—“Fish‐food is good: abounds in phosphorus and nutrition. In your\r\ncase I must recommend a small whale!” Unfortunately, Mark Twain fell into\r\na very common error. The whale is _not_ a fish; it is a mammal: it suckles\r\nits young. The writer has eaten whale—that is, a little bit of one. Whale\r\nbrain, enclosed in batter, and treated as a fritter, is not to be\r\ndespised.\r\n\r\nThe British whaler of about 1670 is quaintly described by Frederic Martin,\r\nwho visited Spitzbergen and Greenland that year. He says:—“Whoever of the\r\nships’ crews sees a dead whale cries out, ‘Fish mine!’ and therefore the\r\nmerchants must pay him a ducat for his care and vigilance. Many of them\r\nclimb often into the mast in hopes to have a ducat, but in vain. When the\r\ndead whale is thus fastened to the ship, two sloops hold on the other side\r\nof the fish, or whale, and in each of them doth stand a man or boy that\r\nhas a long hook in his hands, wherewith he doth hold the boat to the ship,\r\nand the harpooner stands before in the sloop or upon the whale, with a\r\nleathern suit on, and sometimes they have boots on. Underneath the hook\r\nare some sharp nails fixed, that they may be able to stand firm. These two\r\nmen that cut the fat off have their peculiar wages for it, viz., about\r\nfour or five rix dollars. First they cut a large piece from behind the\r\nhead, by the eyes, which they call the _kenter‐piece_, that is as much as\r\nto say, the _winding‐piece_; for as they cut all the other fat all in rows\r\nfrom the whale towards the end, so they cut this great _kenter‐piece_\r\nlarger and wider than all the rest. This piece, when it is cut round about\r\nfrom the whale, reaches from the water to the cradle (that is, the round\r\ncircle that goes round about the middle of the mast, and is made in the\r\nshape of a basket), whence you may guess of the bigness of a whale. A\r\nstrong and thick rope is fixed to this kenter‐piece, and the other end is\r\nfixed to underneath the cradle, whereby the whale is as it were borne up\r\nout of the water, that they may come at it, and by reason of the great\r\nweight of the whale the ship leans towards that side. One may judge how\r\ntough the fat is, for in this piece a hole is made, through which the rope\r\nis fastened, yet not deep into the fat, wherewith they turn the fish at\r\npleasure. Then they cut another piece down hard by this, which is also\r\nhauled up into the ship, where it is cut into pieces a foot square. The\r\nknives used are, with their hafts, about the length of a man,” and so on.\r\n\r\nMr. Brierly tells us that the most important natural enemy of the whale on\r\nthe coast of Australia is the “killer,” a kind of large porpoise, with a\r\nblunt head and large teeth. These “killers” often attack the whale, and\r\nworry it like a pack of dogs, and sometimes kill it. The whalemen regard\r\nthese creatures as important allies, for when they see from the look‐out\r\nthat a whale has been “hove‐to” by them they are pretty sure of capturing\r\nit. The killers show no fear of the boats, but will attack the whale at\r\nthe same time; and if a boat is stove in, which often happens, they will\r\nnot hurt the men when in the water. The Australian natives about Twofold\r\nBay say the killers are the spirits of their own people, and when they see\r\nthem will pretend to point out particular individuals they have known.\r\nSome are very large, exceeding twenty‐five feet; they blow from the head,\r\nin the same manner as the whale.\r\n\r\nThe homes of whales are hardly known. Where the northern whale breeds has\r\nlong been a puzzling question among whalemen. It is a cold‐water animal.\r\nMaury asks:—“Is the nursery for the great whale in the Polar Sea, which\r\nhas been so set about and hemmed in with a ledge of ice that man may not\r\ntrespass there? This providential economy still further prompts the\r\nquestion, Whence comes all the food for the young whales there? Do the\r\nteeming whalers of the Gulf Stream convey it there also, in channels so\r\nfar in the depths of the sea that no enemy may waylay and spoil it in the\r\nlong journey? It may generally be believed that the northern whale, which\r\nis now confined to the Polar Sea, descended annually into the temperate\r\nregion of the Atlantic, as far as the Bay of Biscay, and that it was only\r\nthe persecution of the whale‐fishers which compelled it to seek its frozen\r\nretreat. This opinion is now shown to be erroneous, and to have rested\r\nonly on the confounding of two distinct species of whale. Like other\r\nwhales, the northern is migratory, and changes its quarters according to\r\nthe seasons; and the systematic registers of the Danish colonists of\r\nGreenland show that often the same individual appears at the same epoch in\r\nthe same fiord. The females of the southern whale visit the coasts of the\r\nCape in June to bring forth their young, and return to the high seas in\r\nAugust or September. It was supposed that the migration of the northern\r\nwhale was for a similar purpose. This, however, is not now considered to\r\nbe the case. Its movements are attributed to climatal changes alone, and\r\nespecially to the transport of ice into Baffin’s Bay. It lives entirely in\r\nthe midst of glaciers, and therefore is found in the south during winter\r\nand in the north during summer. The whale‐fishery has diminished its\r\nnumbers, but not altered its mode of life. It is stated now that the whale\r\nbelieved to have visited the North Atlantic Ocean is a totally different\r\nspecies, a much more violent and dangerous animal than the northern whale,\r\nalso smaller, and less rich in oil. The fishery for the latter ceased\r\ntowards the end of the last century, but it is thought to be not wholly\r\nextinct. On September 17th, 1854, a whale, with its little one, appeared\r\nbefore St. Sebastian, in the Bay of Biscay; the mother escaped, but the\r\nyoung one was taken, and from a drawing of a skeleton of the latter MM.\r\nEschricht and Rheinhardt, of Copenhagen, are convinced that it belonged to\r\na species distinct from the Greenland whale; so that the name of\r\n‘Mysticete’ has been applied to various whales.”\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: THE NORTHERN WHALE (_Balina mysticetus_).]\r\n\r\nThe sperm whale, says Maury, is a warm water animal; the _right_ whale\r\ndelights in cold water. The log‐books of the American whalers show that\r\nthe torrid zone is to the right whale as a sea of fire, through which it\r\ncannot pass; and that the right whale of the northern hemisphere and that\r\nof the southern are two different animals; and that the sperm whale has\r\nnever been known to double the Cape of Good Hope—he doubles Cape Horn.\r\n\r\nMr. Beale has done more to elucidate the habits and form of this whale\r\nthan any other writer. Its great peculiarity of form is the head,\r\npresenting a very thick, blunt extremity, about a third of the whole\r\nlength of the animal. The head, viewed in front, has a broad, flattened\r\nsurface, rounded and contracted above, considerably expanded on the sides,\r\nand gradually contracted below, resembling in some degree the cut‐water of\r\na ship. On the right side of the nose is a cavity for secreting and\r\ncontaining an oily fluid, which after death concretes into the substance\r\ncalled spermaceti, of which in a large whale there is not unfrequently a\r\nton. The mouth extends nearly the whole length of the head, and the throat\r\nis capacious enough to give passage to the body of a man, presenting a\r\nstrong contrast to the contracted gullet of the Greenland whale.\r\nImmediately beneath the black skin of the sperm whale is the blubber, or\r\nfat, termed “the blanket,” of a light yellowish colour, producing when\r\nmelted the sperm oil. A specimen taken in 1829 near Whitstable measured\r\nsixty‐two feet in length. The oil was worth £320, exclusive of the\r\nspermaceti.(49) Many years since the _Samuel Enderby_, whaler, returned\r\nfrom the south with a cargo of sperm oil worth £40,000.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: CUTTING UP THE WHALE.]\r\n\r\nThis whale swallows quantities of small fishes, and has been known to\r\neject from its stomach a fish as large as a moderate‐sized salmon. This\r\nspecies is gregarious; and the herds, called “schools,” are females and\r\nyoung males. Mr. Beale saw 500 or 600 in one school. With each female\r\nschool are one to three large “bulls,” or “schoolmasters,” as they are\r\ntermed by the whalers. The full‐grown males almost always go in search of\r\nfood. A large whale will yield eighty, and sometimes one hundred, barrels\r\nof oil. Among the habits of the whale are “breaching,” or leaping clear\r\nout of the water and falling back on its side, so that the breach may be\r\nseen on a clear day from the mast‐head at six miles’ distance; in “going\r\nahead” the whale attains ten or twelve miles an hour, which Mr. Beale\r\nbelieves to be its greatest velocity; “lob‐tailing” is lashing the water\r\nwith its tail. The dangers and hairbreadth escapes in the capture are very\r\nnumerous.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 there were discovered among rubbish in a tower of Durham Castle\r\nthe bones of a sperm whale, which, from a letter of June 20th, 1661, in\r\nthe Surtees Collection, is shown to have been cast ashore at that time,\r\nand _skeletonised_ in order to ornament this old tower. Clusius describes,\r\nin 1605, a sperm whale thrown ashore seven years before, near Scheveling,\r\nwhere Cuvier supposed its head to be still preserved, and there is an\r\nantiquity of the kind still shown there.\r\n\r\nThe whale chase is an exciting scene. Sometimes the whale places himself\r\nin a perpendicular position, with the head downwards, and rearing his tail\r\non high, beats the water with awful violence. The sea foams, and vapours\r\ndarken the air; the lashing is heard several miles off, like the roar of a\r\ndistant tempest. Sometimes he makes an immense spring, and rears his whole\r\nbody above the waves, to the admiration of the experienced whaler, but to\r\nthe terror of those who see for the first time this astonishing spectacle.\r\nOther motions, equally expressive of his boundless strength, attract the\r\nattention of navigators at the distance of miles. The whole structure of\r\nthe whale exhibits most admirable adaptation to his situations and the\r\nelement in which he lives, in the toughness and thickness of his skin and\r\ndisposition of the coating of blubber beneath, which serves the purpose—if\r\nwe may be permitted to use so homely a simile—of an extra great‐coat to\r\nkeep him warm, and prevent his warm red blood from being chilled by the\r\nicy seas. But provision is especially made to enable him to descend\r\nuninjured to very great depths. The orifices of the nostrils are closed by\r\nvalves, wonderfully suited to keep out the water from the lungs,\r\nnotwithstanding the pressure. In one species they are shaped like cones,\r\nwhich fit into the orifice like corks in the neck of a bottle, and the\r\ngreater the pressure the tighter they hold. The most surprising fact in\r\nthe whale, probably, is the power of descending to enormous depths below\r\nthe surface of the sea, and sustaining that almost inconceivable pressure\r\nof the superincumbent water. On one occasion which fell under Mr.\r\nScoresby’s own observation a whale was struck from a boat. The animal\r\ninstantly descended, dragging down with him a rope nearly _one mile long_.\r\nHaving let out this much of the rope, the situation of the boat’s crew\r\nbecame critical. Either they must have cut the line, and submitted to a\r\nvery serious loss, or have run the risk of being dragged under water by\r\nthe whale. The men were desired to retire to the stern, to counterbalance\r\nthe pulls of the whale, which dragged the bow down sometimes to within an\r\ninch of the water. In this dangerous dilemma the boat remained some time,\r\nvibrating up and down with the tugs of the monster, but never moving from\r\nthe place where it lay when the harpoon was first thrown. This fact proves\r\nthat the whale must have descended at once perpendicularly, as had he\r\nadvanced in any direction he must have pulled the boat along with him. Mr.\r\nScoresby and the crew were rescued by the timely arrival of another boat\r\nfurnished with fresh ropes and harpoons. A whale when struck will dive\r\nsometimes to a depth of 800 fathoms; and as the surface of a large animal\r\nmay be estimated at 1,500 square feet, at this depth it will have to\r\nsustain a pressure equal to 211,000 tons. The transition from that which\r\nit is exposed to at the surface, and which may be taken at about 1,300\r\ntons, to so enormous an increase, must be productive of the utmost\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\nStrange incidents are related of harpooning. On September 24th, 1864, as\r\nthe _Alexander_, belonging to Dundee, was steaming about in Davis’s\r\nStraits, a whale of about twelve tons was observed not far distant from\r\nher. Boats were put out, and the crew secured the animal. When they\r\ncleansed it, they found embedded in its body, two or three inches beneath\r\nthe skin, a piece of a harpoon about eighteen inches long; on the one side\r\nwere engraved the words—“_Traveller_,” _Peterhead_, and on the other,\r\n“1838.” This vessel was lost in 1856, in the Cumberland Straits whale‐\r\nfishery; it is therefore clear that the harpoon must have remained in the\r\nanimal from that time.\r\n\r\nA sailor gives the following description of sleeping _inside_ a whale;\r\nnot, however, quite as Jonah may have done. He says:(50)—“We were on a\r\nlittle expedition in the long‐boat one voyage, and we had to encamp for\r\nthe night with as much comfort as our scant means would afford. The shore\r\nwas terrible for its wildness and desolation—it was indeed lonely, sad,\r\nand sandy, but what was strange and welcome, was, great carcases of\r\nwhales, stranded like wrecks on the far‐reaching shore, in some cases the\r\nbackbone holding together like a good keel and the great ribs still round,\r\ngiving you an idea of an elongated hogshead without the staves. We landed\r\nfor the night, unbent our sails and stretched them over the bleached ribs\r\nof a whale’s skeleton, and after supper took a comfortable sleep under the\r\nmost curious roof‐tree I ever rested under.” This was on the north‐west\r\ncoast of Africa; and the sailor came to the conclusion that whales come\r\nashore to die. “And to my mind,” says he, “it is as poetical as it is\r\nwelcome. I like to think of these mighty travellers in the mighty deep\r\nhugging the shore when the fires of life burn low, and the mighty waves,\r\ntheir playmates from their childhood, giving their last lift up on the\r\nbeach!”\r\n\r\nAnd now for that great mythical or actual animal the sea‐serpent.\r\n\r\nFor ages an animal of immense size and serpentine form has been believed\r\nto inhabit the ocean, though rarely seen. A strong conviction of its\r\nexistence has always prevailed in Norway and the fiords, where it has been\r\nreported to have been frequently seen. It is also said that the coasts of\r\nNew England have been frequently visited by this marine monster many times\r\nduring this century.\r\n\r\nBishop Pontoppidan, who, about the middle of the eighteenth century, wrote\r\na history of Norway, his native land, collected a quantity of testimonies\r\nas to its occasional appearance. Among other evidence he mentions that of\r\nCaptain de Ferry, of the Norwegian Navy, who saw the serpent, while in a\r\nboat rowed by eight men, near Molde, in August, 1774. A declaration of\r\nthis was made by the captain and two of the crew before a magistrate. The\r\nanimal was described as of the general form of a serpent stretched on the\r\nsurface in receding coils or undulations, and the head, which resembled\r\nthat of a horse, elevated some two feet out of the water.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1846 many respectable persons stated that in the vicinity\r\nof Christiansand and Molde they had seen the marine serpent. The\r\naffidavits of numerous persons were given in the papers, which, with some\r\ndiscrepancies in minute particulars, agree in testifying that an animal of\r\ngreat length (from about fifty to a hundred feet) had been seen at various\r\ntimes, in many cases more than once. All agreed that the eyes were large\r\nand glaring; that the body was dark‐brown and comparatively slender; and\r\nthat the head, which for size was compared to a ten‐gallon cask, was\r\ncovered with a long spreading mane.\r\n\r\nAn account of one of these encounters, which took place on the 28th May,\r\n1845, was published by the Rev. P. W. Demboll, Archdeacon of Molde, those\r\npresent being J. C. Lund, bookseller and printer, G. S. Krogh, merchant,\r\nChristian Flang, Lund’s apprentice, and John Elgenses, labourer. These men\r\nwere fishing on the Romsdal Fjord, and the appearance took place about\r\nseven in the evening, a little distance from shore, near the ballast place\r\nand the Molde Hove. Lund fired at the animal, which followed them till\r\nthey came to shallow water, when it dived and disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn 1817 the Linnæan Society of New England published “A Report relative to\r\na Large Marine Animal, supposed to be a Serpent, seen near Cape Ann,\r\nMassachusetts, in August,” of that year. A good deal of care was taken to\r\nobtain evidence, and the deposition of eleven witnesses of fair and\r\nunblemished characters were certified on oath before the magistrates. The\r\nlength was estimated at fifty to a hundred feet, and the head compared to\r\nthat of a sea‐turtle, a rattlesnake, and a serpent generally, but in this\r\ncase there was no appearance of a mane.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the _Boston Daily Advertiser_ for November 25th, 1840, there is\r\na communication from the Hon. T. H. Perkins of that city, attesting his\r\nown personal observation of the marine serpent at Gloucester Harbour, near\r\nCape Ann, in 1817. This communication took the form of a letter written to\r\na friend in 1820.\r\n\r\nCaptain Perkins speaks of the animal’s motion being the vertical movement\r\nof the caterpillar, and not that of the common snake either on land or\r\nwater, and this confirms the account of Mr. M‘Clean, the minister of a\r\nparish in the Hebrides, who saw in 1809 a serpentine monster about eighty\r\nfeet in length. He distinctly states that it seemed to move by undulations\r\nup and down, which is not only contrary to all that is known of serpents,\r\nbut from the structure of their vertebræ impossible. Hans Egede mentions\r\nthe appearance of a marine snake off the coast of Greenland in 1734.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of May, 1833, a party, consisting of Captain Sullivan,\r\nLieutenant Maclachlan and Ensign Malcolm of the Rifle Brigade, Lieutenant\r\nLyster of the Artillery, and Mr. Ince the ordnance store‐keeper at\r\nHalifax, started from that town in a small yacht for Mahone Bay, on a\r\nfishing excursion. When about half‐way they came upon a shoal of grampuses\r\nin an unusual state of excitement, and to the surprise of the party they\r\nperceived the head and neck of a snake, at least eighty feet in length,\r\nfollowing them. An account of this occurrence was published in the\r\n_Zoologist_ for 1847. The editor stated that he was indebted for it to Mr.\r\nW. H. Ince, who received it from his brother, Commander J. M. R. Ince,\r\nR.N. It was written by one of the eye‐witnesses, Mr. Henry Ince, and\r\nsigned as follows:—\r\n\r\nW. Sullivan, Captain Rifle Brigade,        June 21, 1831.\r\nA. Maclachlan, Lieut.  „      „            August 5, 1824.\r\nG. P. Malcolm, Ensign  „      „            August 13, 1830.\r\nB. O’Neal Lyster, Lieut. Artillery,        June 7, 1816.\r\nHenry Ince, Storekeeper at Halifax.\r\n\r\nThe dates affixed to the names were those on which the gentlemen received\r\ntheir respective commissions.\r\n\r\nGreat interest was excited in 1848 by an account of a great sea‐serpent\r\nseen in lat. 24° 44’ S., and long. 9° 20’ E., in the tropics, and not very\r\nfar from the coast of Africa, by the officers and crew of her Majesty’s\r\nfrigate _Dædalus_. It was not, as in other cases, in bright and fine\r\nweather, but on a dark and cloudy afternoon, and with a long ocean swell.\r\nCaptain Peter M‘Quhæ, in his report to the Admiralty, published in the\r\n_Times_ for the 13th of October, describes it with confidence as “an\r\nenormous serpent, with head and shoulders kept about four feet constantly\r\nabove the surface of the sea;” and he adds: “As nearly as we could\r\napproximate by comparing it with the length of what our main topsail‐yard\r\nwould show in the water, there was at the very least sixty feet of the\r\nanimal _à fleur d’eau_, no portion of which was to our perception used in\r\npropelling it through the water, either by vertical or horizontal\r\nundulation. It passed rapidly, but so close under our lee‐quarter that had\r\nit been a man of my acquaintance I should have easily recognised his\r\nfeatures with the naked eye; but it did not, either in approaching the\r\nship or after it had passed our wake, deviate in the slightest degree from\r\nits course to the south‐west, which it held on at the pace of from twelve\r\nto fifteen miles per hour, apparently on some determined purpose. The\r\ndiameter of the serpent was about fifteen or sixteen inches behind the\r\nhead, which was without doubt that of a snake; and it was never during the\r\ntwenty minutes that it continued in sight of our glasses once below the\r\nsurface of the water; its colour a dark brown with yellowish white about\r\nthe throat. It had no fins, but something like the mane of a horse, or\r\nrather a bunch of sea‐weed washed about its back.”\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: THE GREAT SEA‐SERPENT WHEN FIRST SEEN FROM H.M.S.\r\n                               _DÆDALUS_.\r\n (_After a Drawing by Captain M‘Quhæ, sent to the Lords of the Admiralty,\r\n                            October, 1848._)]\r\n\r\nDrawings prepared from a sketch by Captain M‘Quhæ were published in the\r\n_Illustrated London News_ of 28th October, 1848. Lieutenant Drummond, the\r\nofficer of the watch at the time, also printed his own impression of the\r\nanimal, which differs in some slight points from the Captain’s account,\r\nparticularly in ascribing a more elongated form to the head, in the\r\nmention of a back‐fin (whereas Captain M‘Quhæ expressly says no fins were\r\nseen), and the lower estimate of the length of the portion of the animal\r\nvisible. Lieutenant Drummond’s words are:—“The appearance of its head,\r\nwhich with the back fin was the only portion of the animal visible, was\r\nlong, pointed, and flattened at the top, perhaps ten feet in length; the\r\nupper jaw projecting considerably; the fin was perhaps twenty feet in the\r\nrear of the head, and visible occasionally. The Captain also asserted that\r\nhe saw the tail, or another fin about the same distance behind it. The\r\nupper part of the head and shoulders appeared of a dark brown colour, and\r\nbeneath the jaw a brownish white. It pursued a steady and undeviating\r\ncourse, keeping its head horizontal with the water, and in rather a raised\r\nposition, disappearing occasionally beneath a wave for a very brief\r\ninterval, and not apparently for the purposes of respiration. It was going\r\nat the rate of perhaps from twelve to fourteen miles an hour, and when\r\nnearest was perhaps 100 yards distant. In fact, it gave one quite the idea\r\nof a large snake or eel.” Lieutenant Drummond’s account is the more worthy\r\nof regard, as it was derived from his journal, and so gives the exact\r\nimpressions of the hour, while Captain M‘Quhæ’s description was written\r\nfrom memory after his arrival in England.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: HEAD OF SEA‐SERPENT. (_After a Drawing by Captain\r\n                                M‘Quhæ._)]\r\n\r\nThese statements caused much discussion at the time. It was suggested by\r\nMr. J. D. Morriss Stirling, a gentleman long living in Norway, and also by\r\na writer in the _Times_ of November 2, 1848, under the signature of “F. G.\r\nS.,” that the monster had an affinity with the great fossil reptiles known\r\nto geologists as the _Enaliosauria_, and particularly adduced the genus\r\n_Plesiosaurus_, or gigantic lizard, with a serpent‐like neck. This is also\r\nthe opinion of Professor Agassiz, as given in the report of his lectures\r\nin Philadelphia, in 1849, and reaffirmed in his “Geological Researches.”\r\n\r\nA master in science, Professor Richard Owen, now appeared upon the field,\r\nand in a most able article in the _Times_, November 11, 1848, gave his\r\nverdict against the serpentine character of the animal, and pronounced it\r\nto have been, in his judgment, a seal. He argued this partly from the\r\ndescription of its appearance, and partly from the fact that no remains of\r\nany dead marine serpent had ever been found. He says: “On weighing the\r\nquestion whether creatures meriting the name of ‘great sea serpent’ do\r\nexist, or whether any of the gigantic marine saurians of the secondary\r\ndeposits may have continued to live up to the present time, it seems to me\r\nless probable that no part of the carcase of such reptiles should have\r\never been discovered in a recent or unfossilised state, than that men\r\nshould have been deceived by a cursory view of a partly submerged and\r\nrapidly moving animal, which might only be strange to themselves. In other\r\nwords, I regard the negative evidence from the utter absence of any of the\r\nrecent remains of great sea serpents, Krakens, or Enaliosauria, as\r\nstronger against their actual existence than the positive statements which\r\nhave hitherto weighed with the public mind in favour of their existence. A\r\nlarger body of evidence from eye‐witnesses might be got together in proof\r\nof ghosts than of the sea serpent.”\r\n\r\nHowever, Captain M‘Quhæ gallantly returned to the charge, and combated the\r\nidea that he had mistaken one of the _Phoca_ species for a snake; and he\r\nwas strongly corroborated by Mr. R. Davidson, Superintending Surgeon,\r\nNagpore Subsidiary Force, in a letter from Kamptee, published in the\r\n_Bombay Bi‐monthly Times_, for January, 1849. This gentleman says that an\r\nanimal, “of which no more generally correct description could be given\r\nthan that by Captain M‘Quhæ,” passed within thirty‐five yards of the ship\r\n_Royal Saxon_ while he and its commander, Captain Petrie, were standing on\r\nthe poop, when they were returning to India in 1829.\r\n\r\nAgain, a letter was printed in the _Zoologist_ for 1852, communicated by\r\nCaptain Steele, 9th Lancers, to his brother, Lieutenant‐Colonel Steele of\r\nthe Coldstream Guards, stating that while on his way to India in the\r\n_Bartram_ he and _every one on board_ saw “the head and neck of an\r\nenormous snake.” This was corroborated in a letter from one of the\r\nofficers of the ship, who says:—“His head appeared to be about sixteen\r\nfeet above the water, and he kept moving it up and down, sometimes showing\r\nhis enormous neck, which was surmounted with a huge crest in the shape of\r\na saw.”\r\n\r\nAnother theory was put forward in the London _Sun_ of the 9th July, 1849,\r\nby Captain Herriman, of the British ship _Brazilian_, who, on the 24th\r\nFebruary, 1849, was becalmed on almost the same spot that Captain M‘Quhæ\r\nsaw his monster while on a voyage from the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\n“I perceived,” wrote Captain Herriman, “something right abeam, about half\r\na mile to the westward, stretched along the water to the length of about\r\ntwenty‐five to thirty feet, and perceptibly moving from the ship with a\r\nsteady sinuous motion. The head, which seemed to be lifted several feet\r\nabove the water, had something resembling a mane running down to the\r\nfloating portion, and within six feet of the tail it forked out into a\r\nsort of double fin.” On approaching in a small boat, however, Captain\r\nHerriman discovered that his monster was nothing more formidable than “an\r\nimmense piece of sea‐weed, evidently detached from a coral reef, and\r\ndrifting with the current, which sets constantly to the westward in this\r\nlatitude, and which, together with the swell left by the subsidence of the\r\ngale, gave it the sinuous snake‐like motion.”\r\n\r\nIn the _Times_ of 5th February, 1858, a letter from Captain Harrington, of\r\nthe ship _Castilian_, stating that he and his crew had seen a gigantic\r\nserpent on the 12th December, 1857, about ten miles N.E. of St. Helena,\r\nbrought out another witness on the sea‐weed hypothesis. This was Captain\r\nFred. Smith, of the ship _Pekin_, who gave a very similar account to that\r\nof Captain Herriman, stating that in lat. 26° S., long. 6° E., on the 28th\r\nDecember, 1848, he captured what he believed to be a serpent, but what\r\nturned out to be a gigantic piece of weed covered with snaky‐looking\r\nbarnacles.\r\n\r\nThis last imputation brought up “An Officer of H.M. ship _Dædalus_,” whose\r\ntestimony, in the _Times_ of 16th February, 1858, puts _hors de combat_\r\nthe sea‐weed theory in that renowned case. He states that, “at its nearest\r\nposition, being not more than 200 yards from us, _the eye_, _the mouth_,\r\nthe nostril, the colour and form, all being _most distinctly visible to\r\nus_ ... my impression was it was rather of a lizard than a serpentine\r\ncharacter, as its movement was steady and uniform, _as if propelled by\r\nfins_, not by any undulatory power.”\r\n\r\nThat there is some mighty denizen of the vasty deep, sometimes but seldom\r\nseen, is more than possible, and highly probable; but to which of the\r\nrecognised classes of created being can this huge rover of the ocean be\r\nreferred? First of all, is it an animal at all? On two occasions monstrous\r\npieces of weed have been mistaken for the Kraken, but on each occasion the\r\ndistance from the vessel is estimated at half a mile; while Captain M‘Quhæ\r\nsays that he was within 200 yards, and Mr. Davidson within thirty‐five\r\nyards of the animal. Under these circumstances we may fairly dismiss the\r\nsea‐weed hypothesis.\r\n\r\nProfessor Owen would place the sea‐serpent among the mammalia, but _Phoca\r\nproboscidea_ is the only seal which will bear comparison with the\r\n_Dædalus_ animal in dimensions, it reaching from twenty to thirty feet.\r\nThe officers declare, however, that at least sixty feet of their animal\r\nwas visible at the surface. Again, the fore paws of the seal are placed at\r\nabout one‐third of the total length from the muzzle, and yet no appearance\r\nof fins was seen. To continue, the great _Phoca proboscidea_ has no mane,\r\nthe only seals possessing what may be dignified with the title being the\r\ntwo kinds of sea lions—the _Otaria jubata_ and _Platyrhynchus\r\nleoninus_—which are far too small to come into the count.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that the great unknown is a reptile, and his marine\r\nhabits present no difficulty. In the Indian and Pacific Oceans there are\r\nnumerous specimens of true snakes (_Hydrophidæ_), which are exclusively\r\ninhabitants of the sea. None of these, however, are known to exceed a few\r\nfeet in length, and none of them, so far as is known, have found their way\r\ninto the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThe most probable solution of the riddle is the hypothesis of Mr. Morriss\r\nStirling and Professor Agassiz, that the so‐called sea‐serpent will find\r\nits closest affinities with those extraordinary animals the\r\n_Enaliosauria_, or marine lizards, whose fossil skeletons are found so\r\nabundantly through the Oolite and the Lias. If the Plesiosaur could be\r\nseen alive you would find nearly its total length on the face of the water\r\npropelled at a rapid rate, without any undulation, by an apparatus\r\naltogether invisible—the powerful paddles beneath—while the entire\r\nserpentine neck would probably be projected obliquely, carrying the\r\nreptilian head, with an eye of moderate aperture, and a mouth whose gape\r\ndid not extend behind the eye. Add to this a body of leathery skin like\r\nthat of the whale, give the creature a length of some sixty feet or more,\r\nand you would have before you almost the very counterpart of the\r\napparition that wrought such amazement on board the _Dædalus_.\r\n\r\nIn evidence of the existence of such an animal, Captain the Hon. George\r\nHope states that when in H.M.S. _Fly_, in the Gulf of California, the sea\r\nbeing perfectly smooth and clear, he saw at the bottom a large marine\r\nanimal with the head and general figure of an alligator, except that the\r\nneck was much longer, and that, instead of legs, the animal had four large\r\nflappers, something like those of turtles.\r\n\r\nThe two strong objections to this theory are—first, the hypothetical\r\nimprobability of such forms having been transmitted from the era of the\r\nsecondary strata to the present time; and, second, the entire absence of\r\nany parts of the carcases or unfossilised skeletons of such animals in\r\nmuseums. Many fossil types, however, of marine animals have been\r\ntransmitted, with or without interruption, from remote geological epochs\r\nto the present time; among these may be mentioned the Port Jackson Shark\r\n(_Cestracion_), and the gar‐pike (_Lepidosteus_), which have come down to\r\nus without interruption, the _Chimæra percopsis_ of Lake Superior, and\r\nsoft‐shelled tortoises (_Trionychidæ_), with more or less apparent\r\ndisappearance. The non‐occurrence of dead animals is of little weight as\r\ndisproving the existence of the sea‐serpent; its carcase would float only\r\na short time, and the rock‐bound coasts of Norway would be very unlikely\r\nto retain any fragment cast up by the waves; many whales being known to\r\nnaturalists only from two or three specimens in many centuries.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the best naturalists is that the existence of the sea‐\r\nserpent is possibly a verity, and that it may prove to be some modified\r\ntype of the secondary _Enaliosaurians_, or possibly some intermediate form\r\nbetween them and the elongated _Cetaceans_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BY THE SEA‐SHORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n           English Appreciation of the Sea‐side—Its Variety and\r\n    Interest—Heavy Weather—The Green Waves—On the Cliffs—The Sea from\r\n     there—Madame de Gasparin’s Reveries—Description of a Tempest—The\r\n       Voice of God—Calm—A Great Medusa off the Coast—Night on the\r\n     Sea—Boating Excursion—In a Cavern—Colonies of Sea‐anemones—Rock\r\n       Pools—Southey’s Description—Treasures for the Aquarium—A Rat\r\n     Story—Rapid Influx of Tide and its Dangers—Melancholy Fate of a\r\n                         Family—Life Under Water.\r\n\r\n          “In hollows of the tide‐worn reef,\r\n      Left at low water glistening in the sun,\r\n      Pellucid pools, and rocks in miniature,\r\n      With their small fry of fishes, crushed shells,\r\n      Rich mosses, tree‐like sea‐weed, sparkling pebbles,\r\n      Enchant the eye, and tempt the eager hand\r\n      To violate the fairy paradise.”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sea‐side is nowhere more thoroughly appreciated than in our own rock\r\nand water girt island, as the popularity of so many of our coast watering‐\r\nplaces fully attests. The wonders of the shore are so many and varied that\r\nthey would require volumes like the present to do them full justice. Here,\r\nthen, the subject can only be briefly discussed.(51)\r\n\r\n“The sea‐side,” says Gosse, a writer who is both artist and scientist in\r\nhis powers of description, “is never dull. Other places soon tire us; we\r\ncannot always be admiring scenery, though ever so beautiful, and nobody\r\nstands gazing into a field or on a hedgerow bank, though studded with the\r\nmost lovely flowers, by the half‐hour together. But we can and do stand\r\nwatching the sea, and feel reluctant to leave it: the changes of the tide\r\nand the ever rolling, breaking, and retiring waves are so much like the\r\nphenomena of life, that we look on with an interest and expectation akin\r\nto that with which we watch the proceedings of living beings.” The sea‐\r\nshore, in all its varied aspects, has beauties and characteristics all its\r\nown.\r\n\r\n“How grandly,” says the same writer, “those heavy waves are rolling in\r\nupon this long shingle‐beach. Onward they come, with an even, deliberate\r\nmarch that tells of power, out of that lowering sky that broods over the\r\nsouthern horizon. Onward they come! onward! onward! each following its\r\nprecursor in serried ranks, ever coming nearer and nearer, ever looming\r\nlarger and larger, like the resistless legions of a great invading army,\r\nsternly proud in its conscious strength; and ever and anon, as one and\r\nanother dark billow breaks in a crest of foam, we may fancy we see the\r\nstandards and ensigns of the threatening host waving here and there above\r\nthe mass.\r\n\r\n“Still they drive in, and each in turn curls over its green head, and\r\nrushes up the sloping beach in a long‐drawn sheet of the purest, whitest\r\nfoam. The drifted snow itself is not more purely spotlessly white than is\r\nthat sheet of foaming water. How it seethes and sparkles! how it boils and\r\nbubbles! how it rings and hisses! The wind sings shrilly out of the\r\ndriving clouds, now sinking to a moan, now rising to a roar; but we cannot\r\nhear it, for its tones are drowned in the ceaseless rushing of the mighty\r\nwaves upon the beach and the rattle of the recoiling pebbles. Along the\r\ncurvature of the shore the shrill, hoarse voice runs, becoming softer and\r\nmellower as it recedes; while the echo of the bounding cliffs confines and\r\nrepeats and mingles it with the succeeding ones till all are blended on\r\nthe ear in one deafening roar.\r\n\r\n“But let us climb these slippery rocks, and picking our way cautiously\r\nover yonder craggy ledges, leaping the chasms that yawn between and reveal\r\nthe hissing waters below, let us strive to attain the vantage‐ground of\r\nthat ridge which we see some fifty feet above the beach. It is perilous\r\nwork this scrambling over rocks, alternately slimy with treacherous\r\nseaweed, and bristling with sharp needle‐points of honeycombed limestone;\r\nnow climbing a precipice, with the hands clutching these same rough\r\npoints, and the toes finding a precarious hold in their interstices; now\r\ndescending to a ledge awfully overhung; now creeping along a narrow shelf\r\nby working each foot on a few inches at a time, while the fingers\r\nnervously cling to the stony precipice, and the mind strives to forget the\r\nrugged depths below, and what would happen if—ah! that ‘if!’ let us cast\r\nit to the winds. Another long stride across a gulf, a bound upward, and\r\nhere we are.\r\n\r\n“Yes, here we stand on the bluff, looking out to seaward in the very eye\r\nof the wind. We might have supposed it a tolerably smooth slope of stone\r\nwhen we looked at the point from the sea, or from the various parts of the\r\nshore where we can see this promontory. But very different is it on a\r\nclose acquaintance. It is a wilderness of craggy points and huge\r\ncastellated masses of compact limestone marble, piled one on another in\r\nthe most magnificent confusion. We have secured a comfortable berth,\r\nwhere, wedged in between two of these masses, we can without danger lean\r\nand look wistfully down upon the very theatre of the elemental war. Is not\r\nthis a sight worth the toil and trouble and peril of the ascent? The rock\r\nbelow is fringed with great insular peaks and blocks, bristling up amidst\r\nthe sea, of various sizes and of the most fantastic and singular forms,\r\nwhich the sea at high water would mostly cover, though now the far‐\r\nreceding tide exposes their horrid points, and the brown leprous coating\r\nof barnacles with which their lower sides are covered is broadly seen\r\nbetween the swelling seas.\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: ON THE SEA‐SHORE: CALM AND STORM.]\r\n\r\n“Heavily rolls in the long deep swell of the ocean from the south‐west;\r\nand as it approaches, with its huge undulations driven up into foaming\r\ncrests before the howling gale, each mighty wave breasts up against these\r\nrocks, as when an army of veteran legions assaults an impregnable\r\nfortress. Impregnable, indeed! for having spent its fury in a rising wall\r\nof mingled water and foam, it shoots up perpendicularly to an immense\r\nelevation, as if it would scale the heights it could not overthrow, only\r\nto be the next moment a broken ruin of water murmuring and shrieking in\r\nthe moats below. The insular blocks and peaks receive the incoming surge\r\nin an overwhelming flood, which immediately, as the spent wave recedes,\r\npours off through the interstices in a hundred beautiful jets and\r\ncascades; while in the narrow straits and passages the rushing sea boils\r\nand whirls about in curling sheets of snowy whiteness, curdling the\r\nsurface; or where it breaks away, of the most delicate pea‐green hue, the\r\ntint produced by the bubbles seen through the water as they crowd to the\r\nair from the depths where they were formed—the evidence of the unseen\r\nconflict fiercely raging between earth and sea far below.\r\n\r\n“The shrieking gusts, as the gale rises yet higher and more furious, whip\r\noff the crests of the breaking billows, and bear the spray like a shower\r\nof salt sleet to the height where we stand; while the foam, as it forms\r\nand accumulates around the base of the headland, is seized by the same\r\npower in broad masses and carried against the sides of the projecting\r\nrocks, flying hither and thither like fleeces of wool, and adhering like\r\nso much mortar to the face of the precipice, till it covers great spaces,\r\nto the height of many fathoms above the highest range of the tide. The\r\ngulls flit wailing through the storm, now breasting the wind, and beating\r\nthe air with their long wings as they make slow headway; then yielding the\r\nvain essay, they turn and are whirled away, till, recovering themselves,\r\nthey come up again with a sweep, only to be discomfited. Their white\r\nforms, now seen against the leaden‐grey sky, now lost amidst the snowy\r\nfoam, then coming into strong relief against the black rock; their piping\r\nscreams now sounding close against the ear, then blending with the sounds\r\nof the elements, combine to add a wildness to the scene which was already\r\nsufficiently savage.\r\n\r\n“But the spring‐tide is nearly at its lowest; a rocky path leads down from\r\nour eminence to a recess in the precipice, whence in these conditions\r\naccess may be obtained to a sea cavern that we may possibly find\r\nentertainment in exploring.”\r\n\r\nMadame de Gasparin, in her visit to Italy, thus describes her impressions\r\nof a thunderstorm, the reveries of an enthusiastic poet‐traveller.(52) She\r\nsays:—“Last night a storm burst over Chiaveri. Three tempests in one! and\r\nwe in the very centre of the action.\r\n\r\n“The thunder, marching on for a long time with that solemn roll which\r\nreveals the depths of the skies, suddenly explodes with a crash; the\r\nlightnings fall straight and serried—no longer a series of fantastic zig‐\r\nzags, but a very focus of electric light. Sometimes the brilliancy flashes\r\nout behind the castle, and the outline of its square tower, black as ink,\r\nis thrown upon the palazzi opposite to it. Sometimes the fire kindles in\r\nthe east, and the square, the houses, the fortress, are all lighted up by\r\na flame of unbearable white, which scorches the eyes. The air is rent by\r\nthe winds in fury, the boom of the waves resounds through an undertone of\r\nwild complaint. Angels of destruction are passing by this night; one hears\r\nthe hiss of their swords. What is human life? A nothing. What is man\r\nhimself? A worm. In hours like these the boldest among us calls his ways\r\nto remembrance.\r\n\r\n“I can understand seriousness; I have no patience with fear.\r\n\r\n“There was a time when, during heavy storms, my mother was wont to say to\r\nme: ‘Come!’ We used to go out in the full fury of the tempest. ‘Listen,’\r\nmy mother would say; ‘it is the voice of God!’ Then she made me join my\r\nhands; she prayed, and peace descended into my soul.”\r\n\r\nAnd again of a storm elsewhere Madame de Gasparin says:—“The mighty voice\r\nfills the air with clamour. Not another word; there it is in its frenzy.\r\n\r\n“There it is, stretching out to the furthest horizons. The clouds which\r\nare driving along alternately dye it grey or black; then the mists are\r\nrent, they let the sun pass through, and the intense blue is lit up to the\r\nvery depths of immensity.\r\n\r\n“Near the shore squadrons of green waves of baleful perfidious hue—heavy\r\nopaque masses, uplifted by a convulsive throb, shone athwart by a pale\r\nray—roll over and break with thundering noise; and foaming cataracts,\r\nprecipitated in torrents, dash up, then, suddenly quieted, come and lave\r\nthe shore with their clear waters.\r\n\r\n“Terrible in its rage this sea! full of spite, like a wicked fairy.\r\nHowling to the four quarters of the sky, heedlessly breaking proud ships\r\nto pieces, intoxicated with cries, calamities, frenzied with might; and\r\nthen, as in irony, tracing magic circles, enclosing, inundating you, and\r\nthrilling with pleasure, running back, leaving the sand strewn with\r\nrainbowed bubbles.\r\n\r\n“We stand motionless, mere nothings in presence of this brute force. But\r\nour soul thrills, feeling herself greater than the sea, stronger than the\r\nwaves—she who can lay hold on God.\r\n\r\n                              * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n“But a ray or light has shone out....\r\n\r\n“And now that the sun is lavishingly scattering diamonds over the sea, now\r\nthat the wrath of the waves breaks into sparkling laughter, let us run on\r\nthe shore, and defy the spray.\r\n\r\n“And so, sometimes flying from, and sometimes braving the wind, we rush\r\ninto the uproar, we push on to that mass of rocks upon which the waves are\r\ncrashing. Swelling at a distance, they rear themselves up—they are giants!\r\nHardly have they reached the rocks than they crumble away, and the silly\r\nfoam throws its flakes on the pine‐trees holding on to the mountain side.\r\nThis is succeeded by a heavenly calm.”\r\n\r\n            “The peaceful main,\r\n  One molten mirror, one illumined plane,\r\n  Clear as the blue, sublime, o’er‐arching sky.”\r\n\r\n“Down we gazed,” says Gosse, in one of his charming sea‐side works, “on\r\nthe smooth sea, becoming more and more mirror‐like every moment, as the\r\nslight afternoon breeze died away into a calm, and allowing us from our\r\nvantage height to see far down into its depths. Presently I was gratified\r\nwith the sight of one and then another of that enormous Medusa, the Great\r\nRhizostome, urging its diagonal course at the shining surface. Its great\r\nbluish‐white disc, like a globe of fifteen or eighteen inches in diameter,\r\nmoves foremost by alternate contractions and expansions, which remind one\r\nof the pulse of an enormous heart, especially as at each stroke a volume\r\nof fluid is shot out of the cavity, by the impact of which on the\r\nsurrounding water the huge body is driven vigorously forward. Meanwhile\r\nthe compound peduncle, with its eight arms that hang down to the depth of\r\ntwo feet below, is dragged after the disc, its weight and the resistance\r\nof the water to its bulk combining to give that slanting direction which\r\nthis great Medusa always assumes when in motion. We watched the great\r\nunwieldy creatures a long time, even till evening had faded into night,\r\nand were left almost the only wanderers on the hill. But what a night it\r\nwas! So calm, so balmy, so solemnly still and noiseless; even the wash of\r\nthe ripple at the foot of the cliff was hushed. There was no moon, but\r\nmany stars were twinkling and blinking, and in the north‐west a strong\r\nflush of light filled the sky, which was rapidly creeping along over the\r\nnorth cliffs. Then those cliffs themselves, all distinctness of feature\r\nlost in the darkness, stood like a great black wall in front of us, which\r\nbeing reflected in the placid sea so truly that no difference could be\r\ntraced between substance and shadow, the dark mass, doubled in height,\r\nseemed to rise from a line only a few hundred yards off; and thus\r\neverything looked strange and unnatural and unrecognisable, although our\r\nreason told us the cause.\r\n\r\n“Let us now scramble down the cliff‐side path, tangled with briers and\r\nferns, where the swelling buds of the hawthorn and honeysuckle are already\r\nbursting, while the blackbird mellowly whistles in the fast‐greening\r\nthicket, and the lark joyously greets the mounting sun above us. Yonder on\r\nthe shingle lies a boat newly painted in white and green for the\r\nattraction of young ladies of maritime aspirations; she is hauled up high\r\nand dry, but the sinewy arms of an honest boatman, who, hearing footsteps,\r\nhas come out of his little grotto under the rock to reconnoitre, will soon\r\ndrag her down to the sea’s margin, and ‘for the sum of a shilling an\r\nhour,’ will pull us over the smooth and pond‐like sea whithersoever we may\r\nchoose to direct him.\r\n\r\n“‘Jump aboard, please, sir. Jump in, ladies. Jump in, little master.’ And\r\nnow, as we take our seats on the clean canvas cushions astern, the boat’s\r\nbottom scrapes along with a harsh grating noise over the white shingle‐\r\npebbles, and we are afloat.\r\n\r\n“First to the caverns just outside yonder lofty point. The lowness of the\r\ntide will enable us to take the boat into them, and the calmness of the\r\nsea will preclude much danger of her striking upon the rocks, especially\r\nas the watchful boatman will be on the alert, boat‐hook in hand, to keep\r\nher clear. Now we lie in the gloom of the lofty arch, gently heaving and\r\nsinking and swaying on the slight swell, which, however smooth at the\r\nsurface, is always perceptible when you are in a boat among rocks, and\r\nwhich invests such an approach with a danger that a landsman does not at\r\nall appreciate.\r\n\r\n“Yet the water, despite the swell, is glassy, and invites the gaze down\r\ninto its crystalline depths, where the little fishes are playing and\r\nhovering over the dark weeds.\r\n\r\n“The sides of the cavern rise around us in curved planes, washed smooth\r\nand slippery by the dashing of the waves of ages, and gradually merge into\r\nthe massive angles and projections and groins of the broken roof, whence a\r\ntuft or two of what looks like samphire depends. But notice the colonies\r\nof the smooth anemone or beadlet (_Actinia mesembryanthemum_) clustered\r\nabout the sides, many of them adhering to the stone walls several feet\r\nabove the water. Those have been left uncovered for hours, and are none\r\nthe worse for it. They are closed, the many tentacles being concealed by\r\nthe involution of the upper part of the body, so that they look like balls\r\nor hemispheres, or semi‐ovals of flesh; or like ripe fruits, so plump and\r\nglossy and succulent and high‐coloured, that we are tempted to stretch\r\nforth the willing hand to pluck and eat. Some are greengages, some Orleans\r\nplums, some magnum‐bonums, so varied are their rich hues; but look beneath\r\nthe water, and you see them not less numerous, but of quite another guise.\r\nThese are all widely expanded; the tentacles are thrown out in an arch\r\nover the circumference, leaving a broad flat disc, just like a many‐\r\npetalled flower of gorgeous hues; indeed, we may fancy that here we see\r\nthe blossoms and there the ripened fruit. Do not omit, however, to notice\r\nthe beads of pearly blue that stud the margin all around at the base of\r\nthe over‐arching tentacles. These have been supposed by some to be eyes;\r\nthe suggestion, however, rests upon no anatomical ground, and is, I am\r\nafraid, worthless, though I cannot tell you what purpose they do serve.”\r\n\r\n                      [Illustration: SEA ANEMONES.\r\n     1, 2, 3. _A. sulcata_. 4. _Phymactis sanctæ Helenæ_. 5. _Actinia\r\n                      capensis_. 6. _A.

There are the little shrubberies of pink\r\ncoralline, Southey’s “arborets of jointed stone”; there are the crimson\r\nbanana‐leaves of the _Delesseria_, the purple tufts of Polysiphoniæ and\r\nCeramia, the broad emerald green leaves of _Ulva_, and the wavy, feathery\r\n_Ptitola_ and _Dasya_. Then everywhere is to be found the lovely _Chondrus\r\ncrispus_, with its expanding fan‐shaped fronds cut into segments, every\r\nsegment of every frond reflecting a lovely iridescent azure.\r\n\r\n                       [Illustration: DELESSERIA.]\r\n\r\n                          [Illustration: ULVA.]\r\n\r\nMr. Gosse was reclining one evening on the turf, looking down on a\r\nDevonshire cove that formed the extremity of a great cavern. Though it was\r\nlow tide, the sea did not recede sufficiently to admit of any access to\r\nthe cove from the shore. Presently he saw a large rat come deliberately\r\nforaging down to the water’s edge, peep under every stone, go hither and\r\nthither very methodically, pass into the crevices, exploring them in\r\nsuccession. At length he came out of a hole in the rock, with some white\r\nobject in his mouth as big as a walnut, and ran slowly off with it by a\r\nway the observer had not seen him go before, till he could follow him no\r\nlonger with his eyes because of the projections of the precipice. What\r\ncould he possibly have found? He evidently knew what he was about. From\r\nhis retirement into the cavern, when the sea had quite insulated it, the\r\nsagacious little animal had doubtless his retreat in its recesses, far up,\r\nof course, out of the reach of the sea, where he would be snugly lodged\r\nwhen the waves dashed and broke wildly through the cove, kindling millions\r\nof fitful lamps among the clustering polypes below.\r\n\r\nThe influx of the tide is frequently, as we all know, very rapid on the\r\nsands, and cuts off the communication between rocky islets and the shore\r\nin rather a treacherous fashion. Mr. Gosse, in giving an account of such\r\ninflux on a part of the Devonshire coast says:—\r\n\r\n“In the evening we strolled down to look at the place, and were beguiled\r\ninto staying till it was quite late by the interest which attached to the\r\ncoming‐in of the tide. There was a breeze from the southward, which hove\r\nthe sea against the opposite entrance of the cavern to that on which we\r\nwere standing; and the funnel‐shaped cliffs on that side concentrated the\r\nsuccessive waves, which drove through a sort of ‘bore,’ and covered with\r\nturbulent water large tracts which but a few moments before were dry. We\r\nwere pushed from stone to stone, and from spot to spot, like a retreating\r\nenemy before a successful army; but we lingered, wishing to see the\r\njunction of the waters and the insulation of the rock. It is at this point\r\nthat the advance is so treacherous. There was an isthmus of some twenty\r\nfeet wide of dry sand, when my wife, who had seen the process before,\r\nsaid, ‘It will be all over by the time you have counted a hundred.’ Before\r\nI had reached fifty it was a wide wash of water.”\r\n\r\nA melancholy fate overtook a large family party near here some years ago.\r\nThey had walked over the sands to Fern Cliff, and made their picnic in a\r\ncavern close by, forgetful of the silent march of the tide. When they\r\ndiscovered their isolation escape was cut off, and the overhanging rock\r\nforbade all chance of climbing. They were all drowned, and the bodies\r\npicked up one by one, as the sea washed them in.\r\n\r\nAll the species of anemone found on the rocks above the water are to be\r\nseen below it, and all displaying their beauties in an incomparably more\r\ncharming fashion. The whole submerged wall is nothing else than a parterre\r\nof most brilliant flowers, taken bodily and set on end. “The eye is\r\nbewildered with their number and variety, and knows not which to look at\r\nfirst. Here are the rosy anemones (_Sagartia rosea_), with a firm fleshy\r\ncolumn of rich sienna‐brown, paler towards the base, and with the upper\r\npart studded with indistinct spots, marking the situation of certain\r\norgans which have an adhesive power. The disc is of a pale neutral tint,\r\nwith a crimson mouth in the centre, and a circumference of crowded\r\ntentacles of the most lovely rose‐purple, the rich hue of that lovely\r\nflower that bears the name of General Jacqueminot. In those specimens that\r\nare most widely opened this tentacular fringe forms a blossom whose petals\r\noverhang the concealed column, expanding to the width of an inch or more;\r\nbut there are others in which the expansion is less complete in different\r\ndegrees, and these all give distinct phases of loveliness. We find a few\r\namong the rest which, with the characteristically‐coloured tentacles, have\r\nthe column and disc of a creamy white; and one in which the disc is of a\r\nbrilliant orange, inclining to scarlet. Most lovely little creatures are\r\nthey all! Commingling with these charming roses there are others which\r\nattain a larger size, occurring in even greater abundance. They are\r\nfrequently an inch and a half in diameter when expanded, and some are even\r\nlarger than this. You may know them at once by observing that the outer\r\nrow of tentacles, and occasionally also some of the others, are of a\r\nscarlet hue, which, when examined minutely, is seen to be produced by a\r\nsort of core of that rich hue pervading the pellucid tentacle. The species\r\nis commonly known as the scarlet‐fringed anemone (_Sagartia miniata_). The\r\ninner rows of tentacles, which individually are larger than those of the\r\nouter rows, are pale, marked at the base with strong bars of black. The\r\ndisc is very variable in hue, but the column is for the most part of the\r\nsame rich brown as we saw in the rosy. Yet, though these are\r\ncharacteristic colours, there are specimens which diverge exceedingly from\r\nthem, and some approach so near the roses as to be scarcely\r\ndistinguishable from them.” The loveliness of these submarine gardens\r\ncannot be over‐rated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     BY THE SEA‐SHORE (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n       A Submerged Forest—Grandeur of Devonshire Cliffs—Castellated\r\n        Walls—A Natural Palace—Collection of Sea‐weeds—The Title a\r\n     Miserable Misnomer—The Bladder Wrack—Practical Uses—The Harvest‐\r\n          time for Collectors—The Huge Laminaria—Good for Knife‐\r\n      handles—Marine Rope—The Red‐Seeded Group—Munchausen’s Gin Tree\r\n        Beaten—The Coralline a Vegetable—Beautiful Varieties—Irish\r\n      Moss—The Green Seeds—Hints on Preserving Sea‐weeds—The Boring\r\n      Pholas—How they Drill—Sometimes through each other—The Spinous\r\n         Cockle—The “Red‐noses”—Hundreds of Peasantry Saved from\r\n     Starvation—“Rubbish,” and the difficulty of obtaining it—Results\r\n    of a Basketful—The Contents of a Shrimper’s Net—Miniature Fish of\r\n                                the Shore.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Gosse tells us in his “Tenby,” of a veritable submerged forest near\r\nAmroth. Pieces of soft and decayed wood constantly come to the surface,\r\nand are called by the peasantry “sea turf.” It is very commonly perforated\r\nby the shells of _Pholas candida_, being ensconed therein as closely as\r\nthey can lie without mutual invasion. Other pieces are quite solid,\r\nresisting the knife like the good old oak timbers of a ship. Occasionally,\r\nduring storms, whole trunks and roots and branches are torn away, come\r\nfloating to the surface of the sea, and are cast on the shore. Some of\r\nthem have been found “at the recess of the autumnal spring tides, which\r\nhave marks of the axe still fresh upon them, proving that the encroachment\r\nof the sea has been effected since the country was inhabited by civilised\r\nman.” Several kinds of trees, including elm, willow, alder, poplar, and\r\noak, have been found among the large fragments cast up. An account of the\r\nencroachments of the sea on various parts of our coasts would fill a large\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\nMr. Gosse well describes some of the Devonshire coast scenery. “Now,” says\r\nhe, “we are under Lidstep Head, a promontory in steepness and height\r\nrivalling its ‘proud’ opponents. I never before saw cliffs like these. The\r\nstratification is absolutely perpendicular, and as straight as a line,\r\ntaking the appearance at every turn of enormous towers, castles, and\r\nabbeys, in which the fissures bear the closest resemblance to loopholes\r\nand doors. Great areas open enclosed as if with vast walls. The sea\r\nsurface was particularly smooth, and we ventured to pull into one of\r\nthese, exactly as if into a ruined castle or vast abbey; chamber opening\r\nbeyond chamber, bounded and divided by what I must call _walls_ of rock,\r\nenormous in height, and as straight as the architect’s plumb would have\r\nmade them, with the smooth sea for the floor. If the tide had been high,\r\ninstead of being low‐water of a spring tide, we might have rowed all about\r\nthis great enclosed court; but as it was, the huge square upright rocks\r\nwere appearing above water, like massive altars and tables. The sea was\r\nperfectly clear, and we could look down to the foundations of the\r\nprecipices where the purple‐ringed Medusæ were playing. Altogether, it was\r\na place of strange grandeur; we felt as if we were in a palace of the sea\r\ngenii, as if we were where we ought not to be, and when a gull shrieked\r\nover our heads, and uttered his short, hollow, mocking laugh, we started\r\nand looked at one another as though something uncanny had challenged us,\r\nthough the sun was shining broadly over the tops of those Cyclopean walls.\r\n\r\n“We left this natural palace with regret; but the tide was near its lowest\r\nebb, and I wished to be on the rocks for whatever might be obtainable in\r\nnatural history. The lads, therefore, gave way, and we swiftly shot past\r\nthis coast of extraordinary sublimity. Presently we came to the Droch,\r\nwhere a more majestic cavern than any we had yet seen appears. Up on a\r\nbeach of yellow sand its immense span is reared with a secondary entrance;\r\nthe arch of uniting stone is thrown across with a beautiful lightness, and\r\nappears as if hewn with the mason’s chisel. Dark domes are seen within,\r\nfar up in the lofty vaulted roof, and pools of still, clear glassy water\r\nmirror the rude walls. This is certainly a glorious cave.”\r\n\r\nEasiest of all maritime objects to collect are the so‐called “sea‐weeds,”\r\nwhich the Rev. J. G. Wood rightly terms a “miserable appellation,” to be\r\nemployed under protest. They are in reality beautiful sea‐plants of oft‐\r\ntimes delicate form and colour; and even the larger and commoner varieties\r\nhave much of interest about them, some having actual uses. One of the\r\nfirst to strike the eye on almost any beach is the common bladder‐wrack\r\n(_Fucus vesiculosus_), that dark olive‐brown sea‐weed familiar to all\r\nvisitors to our coasts. It is distinguished by its air‐vessels, which\r\nexplode when trodden on or otherwise roughly compressed, and which are the\r\ndelight of all youngsters at the sea‐side. This slimy and slippery weed\r\nmakes rock‐walking perilous in a moderate degree, a fact which does not\r\ngenerally stop young British maidens and their companions from slipping\r\nabout over its tangled masses. A larger species (_Fucus serratus_)\r\nsometimes grows to a length of six feet. It is used as manure, and even as\r\nfood for cattle; while it is excellent to pack lobsters, crabs, &c., if\r\nthey have to be sent inland. These and kindred _algæ_, the generic term\r\nfor sea‐weed, are known as _Melanosperms_, or black‐seeded, so called from\r\nthe dark olive tint of the seeds or spores from which they spring, and\r\nwith which they abound.\r\n\r\n                      [Illustration: BLADDER WRACK.\r\n                         (_Fucus vesiculosus_.)]\r\n\r\nThe best time for the collector who would reap a harvest is at spring‐\r\ntides, when, Mr. Wood tells us, an hour or two’s careful investigation of\r\nthe beach will sometimes produce as good results as several days’ hard\r\nwork with the dredge. “It is better to go down to the shore about half an\r\nhour or so before the lowest tide, so as to follow the receding waters and\r\nto save time.” The naturalist or amateur collector then finds at these low\r\ntides a new set of vegetation, contrasting with the more delicate forms\r\nleft higher on the beach, as forest‐trees with ferns and herbage. Huge\r\nplants, some of them measuring eleven feet in length, of the oar‐weed\r\n(_Laminaria digitata_), are lying about in profusion. It is known by its\r\nscientific name on account of the flat thin‐fingered fronds it bears. Its\r\nstem is used for handles to knives and other implements, so tough and\r\nstrong is it. One good stem will furnish a dozen handles, and when dry it\r\nis as hard as horn.\r\n\r\n                        [Illustration: LAMINARIA.]\r\n\r\nAmong the same group is to be found a most singular rope‐like marine\r\nplant, hardly thicker than an ordinary pin at the base, where it adheres\r\nto the rock, but swelling to the size of a large swan’s‐quill in the\r\ncentre. When grasped by the hand it feels as though oiled, being naturally\r\nslimy, and covered by innumerable fine hairs. It is found from the length\r\nof one to twenty, thirty, and even forty feet. It may be mentioned that\r\nsea‐weeds have no true roots, but adhere by discs or suckers. They derive\r\ntheir nourishment from the sea‐water, not from the rock or soil.\r\n\r\nAnother sub‐class of _algæ_ are named the _Rhodosperms_, or red‐seeded,\r\nand they are among the most beautiful known to collectors. They are\r\ndelicate, and some turn brown when exposed to too much light. Above low\r\nwater‐mark may be found growing largish masses of a dense, reddish,\r\nthread‐like foliage, sometimes adhering to the rock, and sometimes to the\r\nstems of the great _Laminaria_. This is one of a large genus,\r\n_Polysiphonia_ (“many‐tubed”) the specific name being _Urceolata_, or\r\npitchered—it is actually covered with little jars, or receptacles of\r\ncoloured liquid.\r\n\r\n“That popular author and extensive traveller, Baron Munchausen,” says Mr.\r\nWood, “tells us that he met with a tree that bore a fruit filled with the\r\nbest of gin. Had he travelled along our own sea‐coasts, or, indeed, along\r\nany sea‐coasts, and inspected the vegetation of the waves there, he would\r\nhave found a plant that might have furnished him with the groundwork of a\r\nstory respecting a jointed tree composed of wine‐bottles, each joint being\r\na separate bottle filled with claret. It is true that the plant is not\r\nvery large, as it seldom exceeds nine or ten inches in height, but if\r\nexamined through a microscope it might be enlarged to any convenient\r\nsize.” The scientific name of this marine plant signifies the “jointed\r\njuice‐branch.” It may be found adhering to rocks, or large seaweed, and\r\nreally resembles a jointed series of miniature red wine bottles.\r\n\r\nThe common coralline (_Corallina officinalis_) is also one of the red sea‐\r\nweeds, although long thought to be a true coral. It is a curious plant; it\r\ndeposits in its own substance so large an amount of carbonate of lime that\r\nwhen the vegetable part of its nature dies the chalky part remains. When\r\nalive it is of a dark purple colour, which fades when removed from the\r\nwater, and the white stony skeleton alone remains. It is, however, a true\r\nvegetable, as may be seen by dissolving away the chalky portions in acid;\r\nthere is then left a vegetable framework precisely like that of other algæ\r\nbelonging to the same sub‐class. It is a small plant, rarely exceeding a\r\nheight of five or so inches, but it grows in luxuriant patches wherever it\r\ncan find a suitable spot.\r\n\r\nA beautiful marine plant is the _Delesseria sanguinea_, with its beautiful\r\nscarlet leaves, the branches being five or six inches in length. It has a\r\nvery “ancient and fish‐like smell,” once noticed not to be forgotten. Then\r\nagain every one will remember in the little seaweed bouquets and\r\nlandscapes on card sold at the fashionable seaside watering‐places, a gay,\r\nbright, pinky‐red kind, which is sure to be remarked for its charming\r\nbeauty. This is the _Plocamium coccineum_, which is found to be even more\r\nbeautiful under the microscope, for it is there seen that even the tiniest\r\nbranchlets, themselves hardly thicker than a hair, have each their rows of\r\nfiner branches.\r\n\r\nSome seaweeds are eaten, as for example the so‐called “Carrageen,” or\r\nIrish moss, which is used in both jelly and size, and is one of the\r\n_Rhodosperm_ algæ. To preserve it for esculent purposes it is washed in\r\nfresh water and allowed to dry; it becomes then horny and stiff. If boiled\r\nit subsides into a thick jelly, which is considered nutritious, and is\r\nused by both invalids and epicures. Calico‐printers use it for size. It is\r\nused, boiled in milk, to fatten calves.\r\n\r\nA pretty little seaweed, _Griffithsia selacea_, has the property of\r\nstaining paper a fine pinkish‐scarlet hue when its membrane bursts.\r\nContact with fresh water will usually cause the membrane to yield, and\r\nthen the colouring‐matter is exuded with a slight crackling noise.\r\n\r\nThe _Chlorosperms_, or green‐seeded algæ, have the power of pouring out\r\nlarge quantities of oxygen under certain conditions, and are therefore\r\nvery valuable in the aquarium. Among them are the sea‐lettuce, before\r\nmentioned, the common sea grass, and a large number of smaller and more\r\ndelicate forms.\r\n\r\n“If,” says Mr. Wood, “the naturalist wishes to dry and preserve the algæ\r\nwhich he finds, he may generally do so without much difficulty, although\r\nsome plants give much more trouble than others. It is necessary that they\r\nshould be well washed in fresh water, in order to get rid of the salt,\r\nwhich, being deliquescent,(53) would attract the moisture on a damp day,\r\nor in a damp situation, and soon ruin the entire collection. When they are\r\nthoroughly washed the finest specimens should be separated from the rest\r\nand placed in a wide, shallow vessel, filled with clear fresh water.\r\nPortions of white card, cut to the requisite size, should then be slipped\r\nunder the specimen, which can be readily arranged as they float over the\r\nimmersed card. The fingers alone ought to answer every purpose, but a\r\ncamel’s‐hair brush and a needle will often be useful. When the specimen is\r\nproperly arranged the card is lifted from the water, carrying upon it the\r\npiece of seaweed. There is little difficulty in getting the plants to\r\nadhere to the paper, as most of the algæ are furnished with a gelatinous\r\nsubstance which acts like glue and fixes them firmly down.” If not, the\r\nuse of hot water will generally accomplish the desired end. Animal glue or\r\ngum‐water cannot he recommended.\r\n\r\nEvery visitor to the sea‐shore has observed rocks drilled with innumerable\r\nholes, almost as though by art. A few good blows with a stout hammer on\r\nthe chisel‐head serve to split off a great slice of the coarse red\r\nsandstone. The holes run through its substance, but they are all empty, or\r\nfilled only with the black fœtid mud which the sea has deposited in their\r\ncavities. These are too superficial; they are all deserted; the stone lies\r\ntoo high above low‐water mark; we must seek a lower level. Try here, where\r\nthe lowest spring‐tide only just leaves the rocks bare. See! now we have\r\nuncovered the operators. Here lie snugly ensconced within the tubular\r\nperforations, great mollusca, with ample ivory‐like shells, which yet\r\ncannot half contain the whiter flesh of their ampler bodies, and the long\r\nstout yellow siphons that project from one extremity, reaching far up the\r\nhole towards the surface of the rock.\r\n\r\nWe lift one from its cavity, all helpless and unresisting, yet manifesting\r\nits indignation at the untimely disturbance by successive spasmodic\r\ncontractions of those rough yellow siphons, each accompanied with a\r\nforcible _jet d’eau_, a polite squirt of sea‐water into our faces; while\r\nat each contraction in length, the base swells out till the compressed\r\nvalves of the sharp shell threaten to pierce through its substance.\r\n\r\nStrange as it seems, these animals have bored these holes in the stone,\r\nand they are capable of boring in far harder rock than this, even in\r\ncompact limestone. The actual mode in which this operation is performed\r\nlong puzzled philosophers. Some maintained that the animal secreted an\r\nacid which had the power of dissolving not only various kinds of stone,\r\nbut also wood, amber, wax, and other substances in which the excavations\r\nare occasionally made. But it is hard to imagine a solvent of substances\r\nso various, and to know how the animal’s own shells were preserved from\r\nits action, while, confessedly, no such acid had ever been detected by the\r\nmost careful tests. Others maintain that the rough points which stud the\r\nshell enable it to serve as a rasp, which the animal, by rotating on its\r\naxis, uses to wear away the stone or other material; but it was difficult\r\nto understand how it was that the shell itself was not worn away in the\r\nabrasion.\r\n\r\nActual observation in the aquarium has, however, proved that the second\r\nhypothesis is the true one. M. Cailliaud in France, and Mr. Robertson in\r\nEngland, have demonstrated that the Pholas uses its shell as a rasp,\r\nwearing away the stone with the asperities with which the anterior parts\r\nof the valves are furnished. Between these gentlemen a somewhat hot\r\ncontention was maintained for the honour of priority in this valuable\r\ndiscovery. M. Cailliaud himself used the valves of the dead shell, and\r\nimitating the natural conditions as well as he could, actually bored an\r\nimitative hole, by making them rotate. Mr. Robertson at Brighton exhibited\r\nto the public living Pholades in the act of boring in masses of chalk. He\r\ndescribes it as “a living combination of three instruments, viz., a\r\nhydraulic apparatus, a rasp, and a syringe.” But the first and last of\r\nthese powers can be considered only as an accessory to the removing of the\r\ndetritus out of the way when once the hole was bored, the rasp being the\r\nreal power. If you examine these living shells you will see that the fore\r\npart, where the foot protrudes, is set with stony points arranged in\r\ntransverse and longitudinal rows; the former being the result of elevated\r\nridges radiating from the hinge, the latter that of the edges of\r\nsuccessive growths of the shell. These points have the most accurate\r\nresemblance to those set on a steel rasp in a blacksmith’s shop. It is\r\ninteresting to know that the shell is preserved from being itself\r\npermanently worn away by the fact that it is composed of arragonite, a\r\nsubstance much harder than those in which the Pholas burrows. Yet we see\r\nby comparing specimens one with another, that such a destructive action\r\ndoes in time take place, for some have the rasping points much more worn\r\nthan others, many of the older ones being nearly smooth.\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: PHOLADES IN A BLOCK OF GNEISS.]\r\n\r\nThe animal turns in its burrow from side to side when at work, adhering to\r\nthe interior by the foot, and therefore only partially rotating to and\r\nfro. The substance is abraded in the form of fine powder, which is\r\nperiodically ejected from the mouth of the hole by the contraction of the\r\nbranchial siphon, a good deal of the more unpalpable portions being\r\ndeposited by the current as it proceeds, and lodging as a soft mud between\r\nthe valves and the stone. Mr. Hudson, who watched some Pholades at work in\r\na tide‐pool in the chalk, observed the periodic ejection of the cloud of\r\nchalk powder, and noticed the heaps of the same material deposited about\r\nthe mouth of each burrow. The discharges were made with no regularity as\r\nto time. Mrs. Merrifield records a curious fact:—“A lady watching the\r\noperations of some Pholades which were at work in a basin of sea‐water,\r\nperceived that two of them were boring at such an angle that their tunnels\r\nwould meet. Curious to ascertain what they would do in this case, she\r\ncontinued her observations, and found that _the larger and stronger Pholas\r\nbored straight through the weaker one_, as if it had been merely a piece\r\nof chalk rock.”\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: SPINOUS COCKLE.\r\n                           (_Cardium edule._)]\r\n\r\n“What,” says Mr. Gosse, “is that object that lies on yonder stretch of\r\nsand, over which the shallow water ripples, washing the sand around it and\r\npresently leaving it dry? It looks like a stone; but there is a fine\r\nscarlet knob on it, which all of a sudden has disappeared. Let us watch\r\nthe movement of the receding wave, and run out to it. It is a fine example\r\nof the great spinous cockle (_Cardium rusticum_) for which all these sandy\r\nbeaches that form the bottom of the great sea‐bed of Torbay are\r\ncelebrated. Indeed, the species is scarcely known elsewhere, so that it is\r\noften designated in books as the Paignton cockle. A right savoury _bonne\r\nbouche_ it is, when artistically dressed. Old Dr. Turton—a great authority\r\nin his day for Devonshire natural history, especially on matters relating\r\nto shells and shell‐fish—says that the cottagers about Paignton well know\r\nthe ‘red‐noses,’ as they call the great cockles, and search for them at\r\nlow spring tides, when they may be seen lying in the sand with the fringed\r\nsiphons appearing just above the surface. They gather them in baskets and\r\npanniers, and after cleansing them a few hours in cold spring‐water, fry\r\nthe animals in a batter made of crumbs of bread. The creatures have not\r\nchanged their habits nor their habitats, for they are still to be seen in\r\nthe old spots just as they were a century ago; nor have they lost their\r\nreputation; they are, indeed, promoted to the gratification of more\r\nrefined palates now, for the cottagers, knowing on which side their bread\r\nis buttered, collect the sapid cockles for the fashionables of Torquay,\r\nand content themselves with the humbler and smaller species (_Cardium\r\nedule_), which rather affects the muddy flats of estuaries than sand\r\nbeaches, though not uncommon here. This latter, though much inferior in\r\nsapidity to the great spinous sort, forms a far more important item in the\r\ncategory of human food, from its very general distribution, its extreme\r\nabundance, and the ease with which it is collected. Wherever the receding\r\ntide leaves an area of exposed mud, the common cockle is sure to be found,\r\nand hundreds of men, women, and children may be seen plodding and groping\r\nover the sinking surface, with naked feet and bent backs, picking up the\r\nshell‐fish by thousands, to be boiled and eaten for home consumption, or\r\nto be cried through the lanes and alleys of the neighbouring towns by\r\nstentorian boys who vociferate all day long, ‘Here’s your fine cockles,\r\nhere! Here they are! Here they are! Twopence a quart!’” It is on the\r\nnorth‐western coast of Scotland, however, that the greatest abundance of\r\nthese mollusca occurs, and there they form not a luxury but even a\r\nnecessary of life to the poor semi‐barbarous population. The inhabitants\r\nof these rocky regions enjoy an unenviable notoriety for being habitually\r\ndependent on this mean diet. “Where the river meets the sea at Tongue,”\r\nsays Macculloch, in his “Highland and Island Homes of Scotland,” “there is\r\na considerable ebb, and the long sandbanks are productive of cockles in an\r\nabundance which is almost unexampled. At that time (a year of scarcity)\r\nthey presented every day at low water a singular spectacle, being crowded\r\nwith men, women, and children, who were busily digging for these shell\r\nfish as long as the tide permitted. It was not unusual to see thirty or\r\nforty horses from the surrounding country, which had been brought down for\r\nthe purpose of carrying away loads of them to distances of many miles.\r\nThis was a well‐known season of scarcity, and, without this resource, I\r\nbelieve it is not too much to say that many individuals must have died for\r\nwant.”\r\n\r\nOne of the easiest forms of collecting is from the _débris_, as it were,\r\nof fishermen’s nets and baskets; but it is exceedingly difficult to induce\r\ntrawlers to bring home any of their “rubbish.” Money, that in general\r\n“makes the mare to go” in any direction you wish, seems to have lost its\r\nstimulating power when the duty to be performed, the _quid pro quo_, is\r\nthe putting a shovelful of “rubbish” into a bucket of water instead of\r\njerking it overboard. No, they haven’t got time. You try to work on their\r\nfriendship; you sit and chat with them, and think you have succeeded in\r\nworming yourself into their good graces sufficiently to induce them to\r\nundertake the not very onerous task of bringing in a tub of “rubbish.”\r\n\r\nThe thing is not, however, utterly hopeless. Occasionally Mr. Gosse had a\r\ntub of “rubbish” brought to him; but much more generally worthless than\r\notherwise. The boys are sometimes more open to advances than the men,\r\nespecially if the master carries his own son with him, in which case the\r\nlad has a little more opportunity to turn a penny for himself than when he\r\nis friendless. “If ever,” says Gosse, “you should be disposed to try your\r\nhand on a bucket of trawler’s ‘rubbish,’ I strongly recommend you, in the\r\npreliminary point of ‘catching your hare,’ to begin with the cabin‐boy.\r\n\r\n“The last basketful I overhauled made an immense heap when turned out upon\r\na board, but was sadly disappointing upon examination. It consisted almost\r\nentirely of one or two kinds of hydroid zoophytes, and these of the\r\ncommonest description. It does not follow hence, however, that an\r\nintelligent and sharp‐eyed person would not have succeeded in obtaining a\r\nfar greater variety; a score of species were doubtless brushed overboard\r\nwhen this trash was bundled into the basket; but being small, or requiring\r\nto be picked out singly, they were neglected, whereas the long and tangled\r\nthreads of the _Plumularia falcata_ could be caught up in a moment like an\r\narmful of pea‐haulm in a field, its value being estimated, as usual with\r\nthe uninitiated, by quantity rather than by quality, by bulk rather than\r\nvariety.”\r\n\r\n         [Illustration: THE WEEVER FISH. (_Trachinus communis._)]\r\n\r\nMr. Gosse found on several occasions when examining the contents of\r\nshrimpers’ nets, a pretty little flat‐fish, a constant inhabitant of sandy\r\nbeaches and pools, and often found in company with shrimps, some of which\r\nit hardly exceeded in size, although sometimes reaching a maximum growth\r\nof four or five inches. Small as it is, it is allied to the magnificent\r\nturbot. The naturalist above mentioned took it home, and observed its\r\nhabits at leisure. “In a white saucer,” says he, “it was a charming little\r\nobject, though rather difficult to examine, because, the instant the eye\r\nwith the lens was brought near, it flounced in alarm, and often leaped out\r\nupon the table. When its fit of terror was over, however, it became still,\r\nand would allow me to push it hither and thither, merely waving the edges\r\nof its dorsal and ventral fins rapidly as it yielded to the impulse.” This\r\nis the Top‐knot, so called from an elongation of the dorsal fin. The\r\nlittle Sand Launce, with its pearly lustrous sides, is a commonly‐found\r\nfish on the shore. It has a remarkable projection of the lower jaws, a\r\nkind of spade, as it were, by the aid of which it manages to scoop out a\r\nbed in the wet sand, and so lie hidden. The Lesser Weever, called by\r\nEnglish fishermen Sting‐bull, Sting‐fish, and Sea‐cat, because of its\r\npower of inflicting severe inflammatory wounds, a little fish of four or\r\nfive inches long, is another denizen of the sands. So also the young of\r\nthe Skate. The Wrasse, the Globy, the Blenny, and many other small fish,\r\nare met with in the pools and caverns of our shores.\r\n\r\nOf crabs, prawns, and crustaceans, of shell‐fish and rock fish, and the\r\nmollusca generally, these pages have already given a sufficient account.\r\nThey are even more at home in the sea than on the shore.\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: THE DEVIL’S FRYING PAN, COAST OF CORNWALL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SKETCHES OF OUR COASTS.—CORNWALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The Land’s End—Cornwall and her Contributions to the Navy—The\r\n      Great Botallack Mine—Curious Sight Outwardly—Plugging Out the\r\n      Atlantic Ocean—The Roar of the Sea Heard Inside—In a Storm—The\r\n    Miner’s Fears—The Loggan Stone—A Foolish Lieutenant and his Little\r\n     Joke—The Penalty—The once‐feared Wolf Rock—Revolving Lights—Are\r\n         they Advantageous to the Mariner—Smuggling in Cornwall—A\r\n     Coastguardsman Smuggler—Landing 150 Kegs under the Noses of the\r\n        Officers—A Cornish Fishing‐town—Looe, the Ancient—The Old\r\n            Bridge—Beauty of the Place from a Distance—Closer\r\n    Inspection—Picturesque Streets—The Inhabitants—Looe Island and the\r\n     Rats—A Novel Mode of Extirpation—The Poor of Cornwall Better Off\r\n    than Elsewhere—Mines and Fisheries—Working on “Tribute”—Profits of\r\n          the Pilchard Season—Cornish Hospitality and Gratitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Land’s End has a particular interest to the reader of this work, for\r\nits very name indicates a point beyond which one cannot go, except we step\r\ninto the great ocean. Round the spot a certain air of mystery and interest\r\nalso clings. What is this ending place like? It is the extreme western\r\ntermination of one of the most rugged of England’s counties, one which has\r\nproduced some of her greatest men, and has always been intimately\r\nconnected with the history of the sea. Cornwall has afforded more hardy\r\nsailors to the royal navy and merchant marine than any other county\r\nwhatever, Devonshire, perhaps, excepted. One must remember her sparse\r\npopulation in making any calculation on this point. Her fishermen and\r\nminers are among the very best in the world. Some sketches therefore of\r\nCornish coasts and coast life may be acceptable.(54)\r\n\r\nOne of the great features of the Land’s End is the famed Botallack Mine,\r\nwhich stretches out thousands of feet beyond the land, and under the sea.\r\nWilkie Collins, in an excellent description of his visit to the old mine\r\nsays:—“The sight was, in its way, as striking and extraordinary as the\r\nfirst view of the Cheese‐Wring itself. Here we beheld a scaffolding\r\nperched on a rock that rose out of the waves—there a steam‐pump was at\r\nwork raising gallons of water from the mine every minute, on a mere ledge\r\nof land half down the steep cliff side. Chains, pipes, conduits, protruded\r\nin all directions from the precipice; rotten‐looking wooden platforms,\r\nrunning over deep chasms, supported great beams of timber and heavy coils\r\nof cable; crazy little boarded houses were built where gull’s nests might\r\nhave been found in other places. There did not appear to be a foot of\r\nlevel space anywhere, for any part of the works of the mine to stand upon;\r\nand yet, there they were, fulfilling all the purposes for which they had\r\nbeen constructed, as safely and completely, on rocks in the sea, and down\r\nprecipices in the land, as if they had been cautiously founded on the\r\ntracts of the smooth solid ground above!”\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: THE BOTALLACK MINE, CORNWALL.]\r\n\r\nThe Botallack is principally a copper and tin mine, and has in days gone\r\nby yielded largely. Mr. Collins descended it to some depth, and found the\r\nsalt water percolating from the ocean above, through holes and crannies.\r\nIn one place he noted a great wooden plug the thickness of a man’s leg\r\ndriven into a cranny of the rock. It was placed there to prevent the sea\r\nfrom swamping the mine! Fancy placing a plug to literally keep out the\r\nAtlantic Ocean!\r\n\r\n“We are now,” says Mr. Collins in his narrative, “400 yards out _under the\r\nbottom of the sea_, and twenty fathoms, or 120 feet below the sea level.\r\nCoast trade vessels are sailing over our heads. Two hundred and forty feet\r\nbeneath us men are at work, and there are galleries deeper yet, even below\r\nthat.... After listening for a few moments, a distant, unearthly noise\r\nbecomes faintly audible—a long, low, mysterious moaning, that never\r\nchanges, that is felt on the ear as well as heard by it—a sound that might\r\nproceed from some incalculable distance—from some far invisible height—a\r\nsound unlike anything that is heard on the upper ground, in the free air\r\nof heaven, a sound so sublimely mournful and still, so ghostly and\r\nimpressive when listened to in the subterranean recesses of the earth,\r\nthat we continue instinctively to hold our peace, as if enchanted by it,\r\nand think not of communicating to each other the strange awe and\r\nastonishment which it has inspired in us both from the very first.\r\n\r\n“At last the miner speaks again, and tells us that what we hear is the\r\nsound of the surf lashing the rocks a hundred and twenty feet above us,\r\nand of the waves that are breaking on the beach beyond. The tide is now at\r\nthe flow, and the sea is in no extraordinary state of agitation, so the\r\nsound is low and distant just at this period. But when storms are at their\r\nheight, when the ocean hurls mountain after mountain of water on the\r\ncliffs, then the noise is terrific; the roaring heard down in the mine is\r\nso inexpressibly fierce and awful that the boldest men at work are afraid\r\nto continue their labour; all ascend to the surface to breathe the upper\r\nair and stand on the firm earth, dreading, though no such catastrophe has\r\never happened yet, that the sea will break in on them if they remain in\r\nthe caverns below.”\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: THE LOGGAN STONE.]\r\n\r\nOne of the great sights of the Land’s End is the famous Loggan Stone.\r\nAfter climbing up some perilous‐looking places you see a solid, irregular\r\nmass of granite, which is computed to weigh eighty‐five tons, resting by\r\nits centre only on another rock, the latter itself supported by a number\r\nof others around. “You are told,” says Wilkie Collins, “by the guide to\r\nturn your back to the uppermost stone; to place your shoulders under one\r\nparticular part of its lower edge, which is entirely disconnected all\r\nround with the supporting rock below, and in this position to push upwards\r\nslowly and steadily, then to leave off again for an instant, then to push\r\nonce more, and so on, until after a few moments of exertion you feel the\r\nwhole immense mass above you moving as you press against it. You redouble\r\nyour efforts, then turn round and see the massy Loggan Stone set in motion\r\nby nothing but your own pair of shoulders, slowly rocking backwards and\r\nforwards with an alternate ascension and declension, at the outer edges,\r\nof at least three inches. You have treated eighty‐five tons of granite\r\nlike a child’s cradle; and like a child’s cradle those eighty‐five tons\r\nhave rocked at your will!”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1824 a lieutenant in the royal navy, commanding a gunboat then\r\ncruising off that coast, heard that it was generally believed in Cornwall\r\nthat no human power could or should ever overturn the Loggan Stone. Fired\r\nwith an ignoble ambition, he took a number of his crew ashore, and by\r\napplying levers did succeed in upsetting it from its pivot. His little\r\njoke was observed by two labourers, who immediately reported it to the\r\nlord of the manor.\r\n\r\nAll Cornwall was in arms, and the indignation was general, from that of\r\nphilosophers, who believed that the Druids had placed it on its balance,\r\nto those who regarded it as one of the sights of the county, and as a\r\nholiday resort. The guides who showed it to visitors, and the hotel‐\r\nkeepers, were furious. Representations were made to the Admiralty, and the\r\nunfortunate lieutenant was ordered to replace it.\r\n\r\nFortunately the great stone had not toppled completely over, or it would\r\nhave crashed down a precipice into the sea, but it had stuck wedged in a\r\ncrevice of the rock below. By means of strong beams, chains, pulleys, and\r\ncapstans, and a hard week’s work for a number of men, it was replaced,\r\nalthough it is said never to have regained its former balance. The\r\nlieutenant was nearly ruined by it, and is said not to have completely\r\npaid the cost of this reparation at the day of his death.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven miles from the Land’s End there lies a dark porphyry rock,\r\nthe highest point of which rises seventeen feet above low water. It is\r\ncalled “The Wolf,” and previous to the construction of a sea‐tower upon it\r\nno rock had been more fatal to the mariner. It is beaten by a terrific\r\nsea, being exposed to the full force of the Atlantic, and it lies just in\r\nthe track of vessels entering or leaving the channel. In 1860 the Trinity\r\nHouse commenced the erection of a lighthouse on it, 116 feet high, with a\r\nrevolving dioptric light. “The first flash,” said a leading journal, “from\r\nthe Wolf Lighthouse was shot forth on the 1st of January, 1870, and within\r\nthe last ten years it is difficult to calculate what good it has done, by\r\nstanding like a beneficent monitor in the centre of the greatest highway\r\nfor shipping in the world.” The Wolf light flashes alternately red and\r\nwhite at half‐minute intervals. A great authority on the subject, Sir\r\nWilliam Thomson, however, expostulates vigorously against all revolving\r\nlights, asserting that, for example, the Wolf is more difficult “to pick\r\nup,” in nautical parlance, than the fixed beacon of the Eddystone.\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: THE LIZARD LIGHT.]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. C. A. Johns, writing about 1840,(55) says that smuggling was\r\nstill practised till within a few years previously. Most families on the\r\ncoast were more or less engaged in it, and many of the houses had, and\r\nstill have, secret underground chambers, which could be entered only\r\nthrough the parlour cupboard, which was furnished with a false back. Old\r\ngrey‐headed adventurers talked with evident pleasure of the exciting\r\nadventures of their younger days, and of their frequent hairbreadth\r\nescapes. One sturdy veteran in particular, who since he had dropped his\r\nprofession of smuggler had on many occasions risked his life in the effort\r\nto save the crews of shipwrecked vessels, told how he was chased by a\r\nking’s boat, how he threw himself overboard and swam for dear life, and\r\nhow he eluded, by diving, blow after blow dealt by an oar or cutlass, at\r\nlast to escape safely to land. The rowers who pursued may not have put\r\nforth their utmost strength, and the blows may have been dealt with\r\npurposed inaccuracy, for in those days there were many sailors in the navy\r\nwho had been smugglers, and had a fellow‐feeling for their kind. “I can\r\nmyself,” says Mr. Johns, “recollect having conversed some forty years ago\r\nwith a coastguardsman who had been a smuggler, and who had with his\r\ncomrades been captured by a revenue cutter. He and another were tried and\r\nconvicted, and sentenced, as was then customary, to five years’ service in\r\nthe navy. While on board the vessel in which they were to proceed to a\r\nforeign station, anchored at Spithead, they escaped from confinement, and\r\nthrew themselves into the sea by night, with the intention of swimming\r\nashore. They had not, however, gone far when they were descried by the\r\nsentinel on board, who gave the alarm, and they were fired at. My\r\ninformant reached the shore in safety, hid himself for a short time, and\r\nbeing afraid to return to his own neighbourhood, entered into the\r\npreventive service, and was at the very time I saw him, after the lapse of\r\nsome years, visiting his friends in his native village, and close to the\r\nscene of his early feats of daring. His comrade was not so fortunate;\r\neither he was struck by a bullet, or became exhausted before he reached\r\nthe shore, and was drowned. At all events, he was never seen again.”\r\n\r\nAbout the same period, Mr. Johns tells us, he was, one fine summer\r\nevening, loitering about the beach, near a small fishing‐village, in a\r\nremote part of the county. It was about four o’clock, the sea was as\r\nsmooth as glass, and the wind so light that whatever vessels and boats\r\nwere in sight were either stationary or sluggishly impelled by oars. One\r\nfishing‐boat only, about a hundred yards from shore, had its sails hanging\r\nidly from the mast, but yet appeared to be creeping towards a quay which\r\nran out between the beach on which he was standing and the houses in which\r\nthe coastguard resided. At the very instant that she had advanced so far\r\nthat the pier was interposed between her hull and the houses a great\r\nsplashing, as of boxes or kegs, or something else, rapidly thrown in the\r\nwater, was heard. Simultaneously a number of men ran down the beach into\r\nthe water up to their waists, and then scampered up to their houses, each\r\nbearing an armful of something. In a few minutes the boat capsized;\r\nprobably this was done on purpose, but as it was in shallow water no harm\r\nresulted. Some innocent‐looking fishermen soon righted her and baled her\r\nout. Mr. Johns learned later on that no less than 150 kegs of spirits were\r\nlanded on that occasion right under the very noses of the coastguard. It\r\nwas a desperate venture, but the fishermen‐smugglers had calculated that\r\nthe officers would not expect any attempt of the kind in calm weather, and\r\nhad reckoned rightly. Smuggling was almost invariably carried on in stormy\r\nweather, or on dark, cloudy nights. On some occasions the people of these\r\nfishing‐towns and the country behind rose _en masse_ and resisted the\r\nrevenue officers, even to the extent of stoning and firing upon them.\r\n\r\n                          [Illustration: LOOE.]\r\n\r\nThe antiquities of Cornwall have called forth a very considerable quantity\r\nof learned literature, but, with the exception of the picturesque and\r\ngraphic matter furnished by Wilkie Collins, Philip Henry Gosse, and, in\r\nlesser degree, by the writer just quoted, the county is not popularly\r\nknown. Mr. Collins’s description of Looe, an ancient Cornish fishing‐town,\r\nwill be read with interest. He says: “The first point for which we made in\r\nthe morning was the old bridge, and a most picturesque and singular\r\nstructure we found it to be. Its construction dates back as far as the\r\nbeginning of the fifteenth century. It is three hundred and eighty‐four\r\nfeet long, and has fourteen arches, no two of which are on the same scale.\r\nThe stout buttresses built between each arch are hollowed at the top into\r\ncurious triangular places of refuge for pedestrians, the roughly‐paved\r\nroadway being just wide enough to allow the passage of one cart at a time.\r\nOn some of these buttresses, towards the middle, once stood an oratory, or\r\nchapel, dedicated to St. Anne, but no traces of it now remain. The old\r\nbridge, however, still rises sturdily enough on its old foundations; and,\r\nwhatever the point from which its silver‐grey stones and quaint arches of\r\nall shapes and sizes may be beheld, forms no mean adjunct to the charming\r\nlandscape around it.\r\n\r\n“Looe is known to have existed as a town in the reign of Edward I., and it\r\nremains to this day one of the prettiest and most primitive places in\r\nEngland. The river divides it into East and West Looe, and the view from\r\nthe bridge, looking towards the two little colonies of houses thus\r\nseparated, is in some respects almost unique. At each side of you rise\r\nhigh ranges of beautifully‐wooded hills; here and there a cottage peeps\r\nout among the trees, the winding path that leads to it being now lost to\r\nsight in the thick foliage, now visible again as a thin serpentine line of\r\nsoft grey. Midway on the slopes appear the gardens of Looe, built up the\r\nacclivity on stone terraces one above another, thus displaying the\r\nveritable garden architecture of the mountains of Palestine, magically\r\ntransplanted to the side of an English hill. Here, in this soft and genial\r\natmosphere, the hydrangea is a common flower‐bed ornament, the fuchsia\r\ngrows lofty and luxuriant in the poorest cottage garden, the myrtle\r\nflourishes close to the sea‐shore, and the tender tamarisk is the wild\r\nplant of every farmer’s hedge. Looking down the hills yet, you see the\r\ntown straggling out towards the sea along each bank of the river in mazes\r\nof little narrow streets; curious old quays project over the water at\r\ndifferent points; coast‐trade vessels are being loaded and unloaded, built\r\nin one place and repaired in another, all within view; while the prospect\r\nof hills, harbour, and houses thus quaintly combined together is closed at\r\nlength by the English Channel, just visible as a small strip of blue water\r\npent in between the ridges of two promontories which stretch out on either\r\nside to the beach.\r\n\r\n“Such is Looe as beheld from a distance; and it loses none of its\r\nattractions when you look at it more closely. There is no such thing as a\r\nstraight street in the place, no martinet of an architect has been here,\r\nto drill the old stone houses into regimental regularity. Sometimes you go\r\ndown steps into the ground floor, sometimes you mount an outside staircase\r\nto get to the bed‐rooms. Never were such places devised for hide‐and‐seek\r\nsince that exciting nursery game was first invented. No house has fewer\r\nthan two doors leading into two different lanes; some have three, opening\r\nat once into a court, a street, and a wharf, all situated at different\r\npoints of the compass. The shops, too, have their diverting\r\nirregularities, as well as the town. Here you might call a man Jack‐of‐\r\nall‐trades, as the best and truest compliment you could pay him—for here\r\none shop combines in itself a smart drug‐mongering, cheese‐mongering,\r\nstationery, grocery, and oil and Italian line of business; to say nothing\r\nof such cosmopolitan commercial miscellanies as wrinkled apples, dusty\r\nnuts, cracked slate pencils, and fly‐blown mock jewellery. The moral good\r\nwhich you derive, in the first pane of a window, from the contemplation of\r\nbrief biographies of murdered missionaries, and serious tracts against\r\nintemperance and tight lacing, you lose in the second, before such fleshly\r\ntemptations as ginger‐bread, shirt studs, and fascinating white hats for\r\nSunday wear at two‐and‐ninepence a‐piece. Let no man rightly say that he\r\nhas seen all that British enterprise can do for the extension of British\r\ncommerce until he has carefully studied the shop‐fronts of the tradesmen\r\nof Looe.\r\n\r\n“Then, when you have at last threaded your way successfully through the\r\nstreets, and have got out on the beach, you see a pretty miniature bay\r\nformed by the extremity of a green hill on the right, and by fine jagged\r\nslate rocks on the left. Before this seaward quarter of the town is\r\nerected a strong bulwark of rough stones, to resist the incursion of high\r\ntides. Here the idlers of the place assemble to lounge and gossip, to look\r\nout for any outward‐bound ships that are to be seen in the Channel, and to\r\ncriticise the appearance and glorify the capabilities of the little fleet\r\nof Looe fishing‐boats riding snugly at anchor before them at the entrance\r\nof the bay.\r\n\r\n“The inhabitants number some fourteen hundred, and are as good‐humoured\r\nand unsophisticated a set of people as you will meet with anywhere. The\r\nfisheries and the coast trade form their principal means of subsistence.\r\nThe women take a very fair share of the hard work out of the men’s hands.\r\nYou constantly see them carrying coals from the vessels to the quay in\r\ncurious hand‐barrows; they laugh, scream, and run in each other’s way\r\nincessantly; but these little irregularities seem to assist rather than\r\nimpede them in the prosecution of their tasks. As to the men, one\r\nabsorbing interest appears to govern them all. The whole day long they are\r\nmending boats, painting boats, cleaning boats, rowing boats, or, standing\r\nwith their hands in their pockets, looking at boats. The children seem to\r\nbe children in size, and children in nothing else. They congregate\r\ntogether in sober little groups, and hold mysterious conversation, in a\r\ndialect which we cannot understand. If they ever tumble down, soil their\r\npinafores, throw stones, or make mud‐pies, they practise these juvenile\r\nvices in a midnight secresy that no stranger’s eye can penetrate.”\r\n\r\nA mile or so out at sea rises a green triangularly‐shaped eminence, called\r\nLooe Island. Several years since a ship was wrecked on the island, but not\r\nonly were the crew saved, but several free passengers of the rat species,\r\nwho had got on board, nobody knew how, where, or when, were also preserved\r\nby their own strenuous exertions, and wisely took up permanent quarters\r\nfor the future on the _terra firma_ of Looe Island. In course of time\r\nthese rats increased and multiplied; and, being confined all round within\r\ncertain limits by the sea, soon became a palpable and tremendous nuisance.\r\nDestruction was threatened to the agricultural produce of all the small\r\npatches of cultivated land on the island—it seemed doubtful whether any\r\nman who ventured there by himself might not share the fate of Bishop\r\nHatto, and be devoured by rats. Under these circumstances, the people of\r\nLooe decided to make one determined and united effort to extirpate the\r\nwhole colony of invaders. Ordinary means of destruction had been tried\r\nalready, and without effect. It was said that the rats left for dead on\r\nthe ground had mysteriously revived faster than they could be picked up\r\nand skinned or cast into the sea. Rats desperately wounded had got away\r\ninto their holes, and become convalescent, and increased and multiplied\r\nagain more productively than ever. The great problem was, not how to kill\r\nthe rats, but how to annihilate them so effectually that the whole\r\npopulation might certainly know that the reappearance of even one of them\r\nwas altogether out of the question. This was the problem, and it was\r\nsolved practically and triumphantly in the following manner:—All the\r\ninhabitants of the town were called to join in a great hunt. The rats were\r\ncaught by every conceivable artifice; and, once taken, were instantly and\r\nferociously _smothered in onions_; the corpses were then decently laid out\r\non clean china dishes, and straightway eaten with vindictive relish by the\r\npeople of Looe. Never was any invention for destroying rats so complete\r\nand so successful as this. Every man, woman, and child that could eat\r\ncould swear to the death and annihilation of all the rats they had eaten.\r\nThe local returns of dead rats were not made by the bills of mortality,\r\nbut by the bills of fare; it was getting rid of a nuisance by the unheard‐\r\nof process of stomaching a nuisance! Day after day passed on, and rats\r\ndisappeared by hundreds, never to return. They had resisted the ordinary\r\nforce of dogs, ferrets, traps, sticks, stones, and guns, arrayed against\r\nthem; but when to these engines of assault were added, as auxiliaries,\r\nsmothering onions, scalding stew‐pans, hungry mouths, sharp teeth, good\r\ndigestions, and the gastric juice, what could they do but give in? Swift\r\nand sure was the destruction which now overwhelmed them—everybody who\r\nwanted a dinner had a strong personal interest in hunting them down to the\r\nvery last. In a short space of time the island was cleared of the\r\nusurpers. Cheeses remained intact; ricks were uninjured. And this is the\r\ntrue story of how the people of Looe got rid of the rats!\r\n\r\nMany causes, Mr. Collins tell us, combined to secure the poor of Cornwall\r\nfrom that last worse consequence of poverty to which the poor in most of\r\nthe other divisions of England are more or less exposed. The number of\r\ninhabitants in the county is stated by the last census at 341,269—the\r\nnumber of square miles that they have to live on being 1,327. This will be\r\nfound, on proper computation and comparison, to be considerably under the\r\naverage population of a square mile throughout the rest of England. Thus,\r\nthe supply of men for all purposes does not appear to be greater than the\r\ndemand in Cornwall. The remote situation of the county guarantees it\r\nagainst any considerable influx of strangers to compete with the natives\r\nfor work on their own ground. Mr. Collins met a farmer there who was so\r\nfar from being besieged in harvest time by claimants for labour on his\r\nland, that he was obliged to go forth to seek them in a neighbouring town,\r\nand was doubtful whether he should find men enough left him unemployed at\r\nthe mines and the fisheries to gather in his crops in good time at two\r\nshillings a day and as much “victuals and drink” as they cared to have.\r\n\r\nAnother cause which has of late years contributed, in some measure, to\r\nkeep Cornwall free from the burthen of a surplus population of working men\r\nmust not be overlooked. Emigration has been more largely resorted to in\r\nthat county than, perhaps, in any other in England. Out of the population\r\nof the Penzance Union alone nearly five per cent. left their native land\r\nfor Australia or New Zealand in 1849. The potato blight is assigned as the\r\nchief cause of this, for it has damaged seriously the growth of a\r\nvegetable from the sale of which in the London markets the Cornish\r\nagriculturist derived large profits, and on which (with their fish) the\r\nCornish poor depended as a staple article of food.\r\n\r\nIt is by the mines and fisheries that Cornwall is compensated for a soil\r\ntoo barren in many parts of the country to be ever cultivated except at\r\nsuch an expenditure of capital as no mere farmer can afford. From the\r\ninexhaustible treasures in the earth, and from the equally inexhaustible\r\nshoals of pilchards which annually visit the coast, the working population\r\nof Cornwall derived their regular means of support where agriculture would\r\nfail them. At the mines the regular rate of wages is from forty to fifty\r\nshillings a month; but miners have opportunities of making more than this.\r\nBy what is termed working “on tribute,” that is, agreeing to excavate the\r\nmineral lodes for a percentage on the value of the metal they raise, some\r\nof them have been known to make as much as six and even ten pounds a\r\nmonth. Even when they are unlucky in their working speculations, or\r\nperhaps thrown out of employment altogether by the shutting up of a mine,\r\nthey have a fair opportunity of obtaining farm labour, which is paid for\r\n(out of harvest time) at the rate of nine shillings a week. But this is a\r\nresource of which they are rarely obliged to take advantage. A plot of\r\ncommon ground is included with the cottages that are let to them; and the\r\ncultivation of this helps to keep them and their families in bad times,\r\nuntil they find an opportunity of resuming work; when they may perhaps\r\nmake as much in one month as an agricultural labourer can in twelve.\r\n\r\nThe fisheries not only employ all the inhabitants of the coast, but in the\r\npilchard season many of the farm people work as well. Ten thousand\r\npersons, men, women, and children, derive their regular support from the\r\nfisheries, which are so amazingly productive that the “drift,” or deep‐sea\r\nfishing, in Mount’s Bay alone, is calculated to realise, on the average,\r\n£30,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nTo the employment thus secured for the poor in the mines and fisheries is\r\nto be added, as an advantage, the cheapness of rent and living in\r\nCornwall. Good cottages are let at from fifty or sixty shillings to some\r\nfew pounds a year. Turf for firing grows in abundance on the vast tracts\r\nof common land overspreading the country. All sorts of vegetables are\r\nplenteous and cheap, with the exception of potatoes, which have so\r\ndecreased, in consequence of the disease, that the winter stock is now\r\nimported from France, Belgium, and Holland. The early potatoes, however,\r\ngrown in May and June, are still cultivated in large quantities, and\r\nrealise on exportation a very high price. Corn generally sells a little\r\nabove the average. Fish is always within the reach of the poorest people.\r\nIn a good season a dozen pilchards are sold for one penny. Happily for\r\nthemselves the poor in Cornwall have none of the foolish prejudices\r\nagainst fish so obstinately adhered to by the lower classes in many other\r\nparts of England. Their national pride is in their pilchards; they like to\r\ntalk of them, and especially to strangers; and well they may, for they\r\ndepend for the main support of life on the tribute of these little fish,\r\nwhich the sea yields annually in almost countless shoals.\r\n\r\n“Of Cornish hospitality,” says Wilkie Collins, “we experienced many\r\nproofs, one of which may be related as an example. Arriving late at a\r\nvillage, we found some difficulty in arousing the people of the inn. While\r\nwe were waiting at the door we heard a man, who lived in a cottage near at\r\nhand, and of whom we had asked our way on the road, inquiring of some\r\nfemale member of his family whether she could make up a spare bed. We had\r\nmet this man proceeding in our direction, and had so far outstripped him\r\nin walking, that we had been waiting outside the inn about a quarter of an\r\nhour before he got home. When the woman answered this question in the\r\nnegative, he directed her to put clean sheets on his own bed, and then\r\ncame out to tell us that if we failed to obtain admission at the public‐\r\nhouse, a lodging was ready for us for the night under his own roof. We\r\nfound on inquiry afterwards that he had looked out of window after getting\r\nhome, while we were still disturbing the village by a continuous series of\r\nassaults on the inn door, had recognised us in the moonlight, and had\r\ntherefore not only offered us his bed, but had got out of it himself to do\r\nso. When we finally succeeded in gaining admittance to the inn, he\r\ndeclined an invitation to sup with us, and wishing us a good night’s rest,\r\nreturned to his home. I should mention, at the same time, that another bed\r\nwas offered to us at the vicarage, by the clergyman of the parish, and\r\nthat after this gentleman had himself seen that we were properly\r\naccommodated by our landlady, he left us, with an invitation to breakfast\r\nwith him the next morning. This is hospitality practised in Cornwall, a\r\ncounty where, it must be remembered, a stranger is doubly a stranger, in\r\nrelation to provincial sympathies; where the national sympathy is almost\r\nentirely merged in the local feeling; where a man speaks of himself as\r\n_Cornish_ in much the same spirit as a Welshman speaks of himself as\r\nWelsh.\r\n\r\n“In like manner, another instance drawn from my own experience will best\r\ndisplay and describe the anxiety which we found generally testified by the\r\nCornish poor to make the best and most grateful return in their power for\r\nanything which they considered as a favour kindly bestowed. Such anecdotes\r\nas I here relate in illustration of popular character cannot, I think, be\r\nconsidered trifling; for it is by trifles, after all, that we gain our\r\ntruest appreciation of the marking signs of good or evil in the\r\ndispositions of our fellow‐beings, just as in the beating of a single\r\nartery under the touch we discover an indication of the strength or\r\nweakness of the whole vital frame.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: VIEW ON THE CORNISH COAST.]\r\n\r\n“On the granite cliffs at the Land’s End I met with an old man, seventy‐\r\ntwo years of age, of whom I asked some questions relative to the\r\nextraordinary rocks scattered about this part of the coast. He immediately\r\nopened his whole budget of local anecdotes, telling them in a high\r\nquavering treble voice, which was barely audible above the dash of the\r\nbreakers beneath, and the fierce whistling of the wind among the rocks\r\naround us. However, the old fellow went on talking incessantly, hobbling\r\nalong before me, up and down steep paths, and along the very brink of a\r\nfearful precipice, with as much coolness as if his sight was as clear and\r\nhis step as firm as in his youth. When he had shown me all that he could\r\nshow, and had thoroughly exhausted himself with talking, I gave him a\r\nshilling at parting. He appeared to be perfectly astonished by a\r\nremuneration which the reader will doubtless consider the reverse of\r\nexcessive, thanked me at the top of his voice, and then led me in a great\r\nhurry, and with many mysterious nods and gestures, to a hollow in the\r\ngrass, where he had spread on a clean handkerchief a little stock‐in‐trade\r\nof his own, consisting of barnacles, bits of rock and ore, and specimens\r\nof dried sea‐weed. Pointing to these, he told me to take anything I liked\r\nas a present in return for what I had given him. He would not hear of my\r\nbuying anything; he was not, he said, a regular guide, and I had paid him\r\nmore already than such an old man was worth. What I took out of his\r\nhandkerchief I must take as a present only. I saw by his manner that he\r\nwould be really mortified if I contested the matter with him, so as a\r\npresent I received one of his pieces of rock. I had no right to deprive\r\nhim of the pleasure of doing a kind action because there happened to be a\r\nfew more shillings in my pocket than in his.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\n             SKETCHES OF OUR COASTS.—CORNWALL (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n     Wilkie Collins’s Experiences as a Pedestrian—Taken for “Mapper,”\r\n    “Trodger,” and Hawker—An Exciting Wreck at Penzance—The Life‐line\r\n        sent out—An Obstinate Captain—A Brave Coastguardsman—Five\r\n    Courageous Young Ladies—Falmouth and Sir Walter Raleigh—Its Rapid\r\n          Growth—One of its Institutions—A Dollar Mine—Religious\r\n     Fishermen—The Lizard and its Associations for Voyagers—Origin of\r\n    the Name—Mount St. Michael, the Picturesque—Her Majesty’s Visit—An\r\n            Heroic Rescue at Plymouth—Another Gallant Rescue.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Collins’s experiences as a pedestrian are amusing. Says he:—“We enter\r\na small public‐house by the road‐side to get a draught of beer. In the\r\nkitchen we behold the landlord and a tall man, who is a customer. Both\r\nstare as a matter of course; the tall man especially, after taking one\r\nlook at our knapsacks, fixes his eyes firmly on us, and sits bolt upright\r\non the bench without saying a word—he is evidently prepared for the worst\r\nwe can do. We get into conversation with the landlord, a jovial, talkative\r\nfellow, who desires greatly to know what we are, if we have no objection.\r\nWe ask him what he thinks we are? ‘Well,’ says the landlord, pointing to\r\nmy friend’s knapsack, which has a square ruler strapped to it for\r\narchitectural drawing, ‘Well, I think you are both of you _Mappers_;\r\nmappers, who come here to make new roads; you may be coming to make a\r\nrailroad, I dare say. We’ve had mappers in the county before this. I know\r\na mapper myself. Here’s both your good healths.’ We drink the landlord’s\r\ngood health in return, and disclaim the honour of being ‘mappers;’ we walk\r\nthrough the country, we tell him, for pleasure alone, and take any roads\r\nwe can get, without wanting to make new ones. The landlord would like to\r\nknow, if that is the case, why we carry these loads at our backs? Because\r\nwe want to carry our luggage about with us. Couldn’t we pay to ride? Yes,\r\nwe could. And yet we like walking better? Yes, we do. This last answer\r\nutterly confounds the tall customer, who has been hitherto listening\r\nintently to the dialogue. It is evidently too much for his credulity; he\r\npays his reckoning, and walks out in a hurry without uttering a word. The\r\nlandlord appears to be convinced, but it is only in appearance; he looks\r\nat us suspiciously in spite of himself. We leave him standing at his door,\r\nkeeping his eye on us as long as we are in sight, still evidently\r\npersuaded that we are ‘mappers,’ but ‘mappers’ of a bad order, whose\r\nperseverance is fraught with some unknown peril to the security of the\r\nQueen’s highway.\r\n\r\n“We get on into another district. Here public opinion is not flattering.\r\nSome of the groups gathered together in the road to observe us begin to\r\nspeculate on our characters before we are quite out of hearing. Then this\r\nsort of dialogue, spoken in serious, subdued tones, just reaches us.\r\nQuestion—‘What can they be?’ Answer—‘_Trodgers!_’\r\n\r\n“This is particularly humiliating, because it happens to be true. We\r\ncertainly do trudge, and are therefore properly, though rather\r\nunceremoniously, called trudgers, or ‘trodgers.’ But we sink to a lower\r\ndepth yet a little further on. We are viewed as objects of pity. It is a\r\nfine evening. We stop and lean against a bank by the road‐side to look at\r\nthe sunset. An old woman comes tottering by on high pattens, very\r\ncomfortably and nicely clad. She sees our knapsacks, and instantly stops\r\nin front of us, and begins to moan lamentably. Not understanding at first\r\nwhat this means, we ask respectfully if she feels at all ill? ‘Ah! poor\r\nfellows, poor fellows!’ she sighs in answer, ‘obliged to carry all your\r\nbaggage on your own backs! very hard! poor lads! very hard indeed!’ and\r\nthe good old soul goes away groaning over our evil plight, and mumbling\r\nsomething which sounds very like an assurance that she has no money to\r\ngive us.\r\n\r\n“In another part of the county we rise again gloriously in worldly\r\nconsideration. We pass a cottage; a woman looks out after us over the low\r\ngarden wall, and rather hesitatingly calls us back. I approach her first,\r\nand am thus saluted: ‘If you please, sir, what have you got to sell?’\r\nAgain, an old man meets us on the road, stops, cheerfully taps our\r\nknapsacks with his stick, and says, ‘Aha! you’re tradesmen, eh! things to\r\nsell? I say, have you got any tea?’ (pronounced _tay_). Further on we\r\napproach some miners breaking ore. As we pass by we hear one asking\r\namazedly, ‘What have they got to sell in those things on their backs?’ and\r\nanother answering, in the prompt tones of a guesser who is convinced that\r\nhe guesses right, ‘Guinea‐pigs!’\r\n\r\n“It is, unfortunately, impossible to convey to the reader any adequate\r\nidea by mere description of the extraordinary gravity of manner, the looks\r\nof surprise, and the tones of conviction which accompanied these various\r\npopular conjectures as to our calling and station in life, and which added\r\nimmeasurably at the time to their comic effect. Curiously enough, whenever\r\nthey took the form of questions, any jesting in returning an answer never\r\nseemed either to be appreciated or understood by the country people.\r\nSerious replies fared much the same fate as jokes. Everybody asked whether\r\nwe could pay for riding, and nobody believed we preferred walking, if we\r\ncould. So we soon gave up any idea of affording any information at all,\r\nand walked through the country comfortably as mappers, trodgers,\r\ntradesmen, guinea‐pig mongers, and poor back‐burdened vagabond lads,\r\naltogether, or one at a time, just as the peasantry pleased.”\r\n\r\nPenzance is itself the most westerly port of England. It has a noble pier,\r\n700 feet long, and a lighthouse, the red light of which can be seen nine\r\nmiles off. It has a lifeboat, the crew of which has done many a gallant\r\ndeed. Out of a population of twelve or thirteen thousand in and about the\r\ntown, at least twenty‐five per cent. are hardy men of the sea—fishermen or\r\nsailors. It was the scene, only a couple of years ago, of a most exciting\r\nevent.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: ROCKET LINE THROWN TO A WRECK NEAR PENZANCE.]\r\n\r\nA French brig, the _Ponthieu_, went ashore near the town, during the\r\nprevalence of a strong south‐west gale. The Marazion rocket apparatus was\r\nworked successfully, and the line was thrown over the wreck, but the crew,\r\nbeing ignorant of the mode of working it, fastened it loosely on board,\r\ninstead of hauling it in taut. One of the crew managed, however, to get\r\nsafely ashore by it. The Penzance lifeboat was then got out, but on her\r\narrival at the ill‐fated vessel, the French crew, though in infinite\r\nperil, great seas washing over them, took no notice, the captain\r\napparently forbidding them to leave, or even throw a line to the boat. The\r\nwind and sea rapidly increased in fury; the vessel was evidently doomed,\r\nand must soon break up. In vain the life‐boatmen entreated. They were\r\nactually warned off, and had, after earnest warning, to leave. But seeing\r\nthe inevitable loss of life that must ensue, the brave coxswain of the\r\nboat determined to return. Result: five lives saved. The captain still\r\nremained obstinate, and at length a coastguardsman, all honour to him!\r\nvolunteered for the perilous duty of going out to the wreck by the rocket\r\nline, taking with him a letter from the French Consul, urging the captain\r\nto leave. In the presence of hundreds of intensely‐excited spectators, the\r\ncoastguard made his way, often under the waves for several seconds, and in\r\nperil of being washed off. The captain was watching him from the brig, but\r\nstood motionless, even when his deliverer had arrived under the bows. Just\r\nthen a furious sea broke over the hero of the rocket line, and washed him\r\naway, and it was feared by all on shore that he must perish. Happily,\r\nhowever, he regained the rope, and more dead than alive, was washed\r\nashore. Meanwhile the brig was fast breaking up. The masts fell over the\r\nside. The stern, on which the captain was standing, was first battered in,\r\nand then clean carried away. It was supposed that the captain had\r\nperished, but presently he was seen among the wreckage, mounting to the\r\nforeyard, the sail of which somewhat sheltered him. The coastguardsmen\r\nfired two more rockets, and one line falling close to the captain, he\r\nseized it, but even then seemed irresolute whether to save himself or\r\nperish with his brig. After a quarter of an hour the love of life\r\nconstrained him to fasten the rope round his body, and the foolhardy man\r\nwas dragged ashore. Within an hour nothing was to be seen of the vessel\r\nbut a few floating spars. The cheers which greeted the captain’s rescue\r\nwere but feeble compared with those that had welcomed the return of the\r\ncoastguardsman whose life had been risked in attempting to save him. Brave\r\nGould!\r\n\r\nThe coastguardsmen, however, do not enjoy a monopoly of bravery in\r\nCornwall. There are courageous women there, some of them very young.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: LIFE‐BOAT GOING TO A WRECK ON DOOM BAR, PADSTOW.]\r\n\r\nTowards the end of October, 1879, a well‐earned presentation was made at\r\nPadstow, to five young ladies of an equal number of silver medals and\r\ntestimonials inscribed on vellum, the vote of the National Life‐boat\r\nInstitution. The four Misses Prideaux Brune and Miss Nora O’Shaughnessy\r\nhad taken a boat through a heavy sea, at the risk of their own lives, to\r\nsave an exhausted sailor from a capsized boat, two of the companions of\r\nwhom had perished before their arrival. Samuel Bate, late the assistant\r\ncoxswain of the Padstow life‐boat, was towing the ladies’ boat astern of\r\nhis fishing smack, when seeing the accident, they requested to be cast\r\noff, and that being done, though against his convictions, he states that\r\nthey rowed “like tigers” to the rescue through a furious sea, and he has\r\nno doubt that the man would have perished like his companions but for\r\ntheir prompt arrival. Such noble‐hearted girls make us still more proud of\r\nCornwall, which has given England—aye, the world—so many noble men.\r\n\r\nThe Cornish coast, in spite of its picturesque character and points of\r\ninterest, is not so well known by tourists and artists as it should be.\r\n\r\nFalmouth has an interesting history. When Sir Walter Raleigh visited it on\r\nhis return from the Guinea coast, where guinea‐pigs came from, he found\r\nbut one solitary house outside of the family mansion of an ancient county\r\nfamily. His quick eye noted the admirable harbour and entrance, the former\r\ncapable of holding 500 vessels, and he represented to the Council the\r\nadvantage of making it a port. From that time its fortunes grew; soon it\r\nbecame a packet station for the arrival and departure of the foreign\r\nmails. Now on the lofty headland, St. Anthony’s Point, a lighthouse,\r\nflashing brilliantly every twenty seconds, serves to guide the entering\r\nships and steamships, which have sometimes numbered 2,000 in one year. It\r\nhas a patent slip, dry and other docks, and all conveniences for shipping\r\ninterests. Connected with the town is an extensive oyster and trawling\r\nfishery, and it has a little fleet of pilot cutters. It has a sailors’\r\nBethel, with library and reading‐room; and the Royal Cornwall Sailors’\r\nHome is a prominent institution. Another of the “institutions” of Falmouth\r\nmight be copied to advantage elsewhere. Every boatman who rescues a\r\ndrowning person is entitled to receive a reward of one guinea.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. C. A. Johns tells us that near Gunwalloe, Cornwall, the land\r\nrises, and the coast becomes bold for a short distance. The cliffs, though\r\nnot lofty, are precipitous, and offer no chance of escape to any\r\nunfortunate vessel which may chance to be driven in within reach of the\r\nrocks. About the year 1785, a vessel laden with wool, and having also on\r\nboard two and a half tons of money, was driven ashore a few hundred yards\r\nwest of the church, and soon went to pieces. Ever since, at intervals,\r\nafter a storm, dollars have been picked up on the beach, but never in\r\nsufficient numbers to compensate for the time wasted in the search. No\r\nmeasures, however, on a large scale for recovering the precious cargo were\r\nadopted until the year 1845, when people were startled to hear that a\r\nparty of adventurers were going to sink a dollar‐mine in the sea.\r\n\r\nThis is not the only unsuccessful search for treasure which has been made\r\nat Gunwalloe. In the sand‐banks near the church, or, as others say, at\r\nKennack Cove, the notorious buccaneer Captain Avery is reported to have\r\nburied several chests of treasure previous to his leaving England on the\r\nvoyage from which he never returned. So strongly did this opinion prevail\r\nthat Mr. John Knill, collector of the Customs at St. Ives, procured, about\r\nthe year 1770, a grant of treasure trove, and expended some money in a\r\nfruitless search.\r\n\r\nThe vessel had gone to pieces between two rocks at a short distance from\r\nthe base of the cliff, and here it was proposed to construct a kind of\r\ncoffer‐dam, from which the water was to be pumped out, and the dollars to\r\nbe picked up at leisure. Mad though the scheme was, operations were\r\nactually commenced; a path was cut in the face of the cliff, iron rods\r\nwere fixed into the rocks, and several beams of timber laid down, when a\r\nbreeze set in from the south‐west, and in the course of a few hours the\r\nwork of as many weeks was destroyed. The wood‐work was ripped up as\r\neffectually as though it had been a mere wicker cage, and the coast was\r\nsoon lined with the fragments. It is not likely the attempt will be\r\nrenewed. The speculators were in this instance strangers, which accounts\r\nfor the enterprise having been taken in hand at all, for any one\r\nacquainted with the coast must have been well aware that though the sea is\r\ntolerably calm sometimes for many consecutive days, it is never so for a\r\nperiod long enough to allow the completion of a work which requires time,\r\nand which, in the most favourable weather, is beset with difficulties;\r\nindeed, an ordinary breeze setting on this shore excites the sea to such a\r\nstate of fury that certainly no unfinished mechanical structure could\r\nwithstand the force of the breakers.\r\n\r\nThe lower classes of Cornwall are generally Methodists, and decidedly\r\nreligious. In Scotland also, strict Sabbatarianism is the rule among the\r\npoor. _The Northern Ensign_, in reply to a journalist who had been\r\nadvocating the prosecution of the herring fishery on the Sabbath day, had\r\nan article showing that there is no class in Scotland, taken as a whole,\r\nwho love, revere, and enjoy the Sabbath more than the men and women who\r\nlive by the sea. At Wick, the largest herring fishery station in the\r\nworld, where the fishers congregate from all parts of the coast, at ten\r\no’clock one Sabbath morning not a single fisherman was to be seen in the\r\nstreet; in half an hour after knots of men and women were wending their\r\nway to the various places of worship, and when the church bell announced\r\nthe hour of meeting the streets were almost impassable—men, women, and\r\nchildren, all cleanly dressed, and not in working clothes, streamed this\r\nway and that to church.\r\n\r\nNo visitor to Cornwall ever misses the Lizard, the most southerly headland\r\npromontory in Britain, a piece of rocky land which has caused more vivid\r\nand varied emotions than any other on our coasts. The emigrant leaving, as\r\nhe often thinks, and often wrongly thinks, his native land for ever; the\r\nsoldier bound for distant battle‐fields, and the sailor for far distant\r\nforeign ports; the lover just parted from his beloved one; the husband\r\nfrom his wife; have each and all strained their eyes for a last parting\r\nglimpse of an isle they loved so much and yet might never see again! And\r\nwhen the lighthouses’ flash could no longer be discerned, how sadly did\r\none and all “turn into” their berths to think, aye, “perchance to dream,”\r\nof the happy past and the doubtful future. How different the emotions of\r\nthe homeward bound, the emigrant with his gathered gold, the bronzed\r\nveteran who has come out of the fiercest conflict unscathed, and the\r\nsailor who has safely passed the ordeal of fearful climes; the lover ready\r\nnow for the girl he adores; and the husband jubilant with such good news\r\nfor his faithful spouse. The first glimpse of that strangely‐named rocky\r\npoint is the signal for heartiest huzzas and congratulation.\r\n\r\nThe Lizard Rock owes its name, according to various authorities, firstly\r\nto its form; secondly to the serpent‐like colour of its cliffs; and\r\nthirdly is said to be derived from the Cornish word Liazherd, signifying a\r\nprojecting headland. Its two splendid lights can be seen out at sea at a\r\ndistance of twenty miles.\r\n\r\n         [Illustration: WRECK OF A STEAM‐SHIP NEAR LIZARD POINT.]\r\n\r\nMount’s Bay, a few miles further west, has a fine anchorage, but is more\r\ninteresting to the visitor as containing an isolated pyramidal collection\r\nof grand rocks, which, with their castle, are the delight of the landscape\r\nartist. The old castle on the rocky islet rises to a height of 230 feet.\r\nThe island is connected with Marazion, a village on the mainland, 400\r\nyards distant, by a causeway of stones. In 1846 her Majesty Queen Victoria\r\nand Prince Albert paid a visit to the spot, and the event is commemorated\r\non a tablet let into the wall of the pier, and by a brass foot‐plate\r\nplaced on the spot first touched by the Royal feet when they conveyed Her\r\nMajesty ashore. There is a snug little harbour, and the pier just named\r\nwill allow several hundred vessels to unload at the same time. The\r\npopulation of Mount St. Michael is composed almost entirely of pilots and\r\nfishermen.\r\n\r\nPlymouth, Devon, with its grand breakwater and many associations, has\r\noften been mentioned in these pages. Comparatively recently it was the\r\nscene of a most gallant rescue. Five boys were playing on the beach in\r\nfront of the Hoe, when they entered a cave in the rocks, and remained\r\nthere until the tide, which flowed in with unusual rapidity on account of\r\na gale outside, completely hemmed them in. Their screams were heard from\r\nthe road and promenade above, and hundreds of people quickly congregated.\r\nThe waves were dashing furiously on the beach, and surging into the cave\r\nwhere the terrified lads were crouching, shivering with wet and cold, and\r\ntrembling at their apparently inevitable fate. No boat could live in the\r\nsurf, or dare approach the rocks. But seamen’s proverbial ingenuity came\r\nto the rescue; ropes were procured, and two seafaring men, George Andrews\r\nand Thomas Penny by name, were lowered over the precipitous crags through\r\nthe blinding spray and dashing foam to the mouth of the rocky recess.\r\nHere, still attached to the ropes, they allowed themselves to be washed by\r\nthe sea into the cave far enough to seize a boy, when, the signal being\r\ngiven, they were hauled out and up. This was repeated, until amid\r\nenthusiastic cheering, the fifth and last boy was saved.\r\n\r\nHas the reader ever visited Dartmouth, one of the loveliest spots in\r\nBritain? The men, and, if history tells us aright, the women too, of that\r\nancient town rendered a good account of themselves when the French, in\r\n1404, after burning and sacking Plymouth, thought they would have an easy\r\nprey. The inhabitants of Dartmouth pluckily resisted the invaders, and\r\nwith such success, that the commander of the fleet, three barons, and\r\ntwenty knights, were taken prisoners. But then out of a comparatively\r\nsmall population, then as now, a large proportion were men of the sea.\r\n\r\n                       [Illustration: SOUTHAMPTON.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SKETCHES OF OUR SOUTH COASTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n       Southampton: its Antiquity—Extensive Commerce—Great Port for\r\n    Leading Steamship Lines—Vagaries of a Runaway Steamer—The Isle of\r\n       Wight—Terrible Loss of the _Eurydice_—Finding of the Court‐\r\n            martial—Raising Her from the Bottom—“London by the\r\n    Seaside”—Newhaven and Seaford—Beachy Head—An Attempt to Scale it—A\r\n    Wreck there—Knowledge Useful on an Emergency—Saved by Samphire—The\r\n    Coast‐guard: Past and Present—Their Comparatively Pleasant Lot To‐\r\n    day—The Coast‐guard in the Smuggler Days—Sympathies of the Country\r\n                              against them.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouthampton, one of the most important towns in the South of England, is a\r\nplace of great antiquity, having been in existence prior to the Conquest,\r\nwhile many Roman remains are to be found in its neighbourhood. What\r\nschoolboy is not familiar with the story of King Canute and his courtiers,\r\nwho flattered their royal master that even the winds and waves would do\r\nhis bidding? The Danish monarch was made of too stern material to believe\r\nsuch nonsense; and to convince his fawning courtiers that he did not\r\npossess attributes which belong to the Creator alone, he is said to have\r\nseated himself by the seaside, and in a loud voice commanded the waves to\r\nstay. But the fleecy billows obeyed him not, and in due course reached the\r\nfeet of the king and his obsequious court. The spot upon which this\r\nmemorable circumstance occurred is still pointed out in the neighbourhood\r\nof Southampton.\r\n\r\nNearly surrounding the town remains of the ancient buttresses and towers\r\nof the wall which once environed it are still to be seen; while on the\r\nwestern shore the old Water‐gate, from which the merchants embarked, still\r\nexists. In the old Domesday Book it is described as an important burgh.\r\nSouthampton grew in importance at the time of the Crusades, when thousands\r\nof troops and crusaders and mailed knights embarked thence, or, weather‐\r\nbound, remained encamped in the place. It soon became a great port of call\r\nfor Flemish and other merchant‐traders.\r\n\r\nSouthampton has great natural advantages for communication with the sea.\r\nThe town is situated on a swelling point of land, bounded by the\r\nconfluences of the rivers Test and Itchen, and communicating with the\r\nSolent and English Channel by the fine arm of the sea known as Southampton\r\nWater, surrounded by charming scenery, and navigable for the largest\r\nsteamers. At its mouth is Calshot Castle, a coastguard station at the\r\nwater’s edge, while half‐way between that point and the town are the\r\npicturesque ruins of Netley Abbey. It has a tidal dock covering sixteen\r\nacres, and several graving and other docks. Consequently, it is the point\r\nof departure for the fine vessels of the Peninsular and Oriental line, the\r\nRoyal Mail (West Indies and Central America), the North German Lloyds’,\r\nHamburgh, and Havre steamships for New York, and the Union Line for\r\nAfrican ports, besides an infinity of smaller steamships and steamboats\r\nfor Havre, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Wight. Its inhabitants\r\nconsider it the Liverpool of the South; and even if this is rather an\r\nexaggerated view of the case, it has undoubtedly grown to be one of the\r\nprincipal ports of the kingdom. It ranks fifth in the list.(56)\r\n\r\nAnd now for the story of a steamboat which attempted to run away from\r\nSouthampton on her own account. This strange circumstance occurred some\r\nfew years ago, and might well have been attended with disastrous results.\r\nThe steam‐tug _Belmont_ was towing out to sea the _Walton Hood_, a\r\npassenger vessel bound for Australia, and after taking her down to the\r\nChannel, the sails were set on the ship, and the _Belmont_ proceeded to\r\ncast her off, previous to returning to Southampton. In doing so, by some\r\nunexplained cause the ship collided with the tug, striking her with a\r\nviolent crash, which knocked over her mast and funnel, and threw her upon\r\nher side. The shock also had the effect of increasing the activity of the\r\ncrew, who, one and all, leaped on board the _Walton Hood_, leaving their\r\nsteamer in charge of a dog and two cats. The steam of the _Belmont_ was\r\nup, and after a succession of plunges and croakings she righted, and\r\ncleared the ship. Tearing away her bulwarks, she took a sweep round and\r\nmade a bolt for the land. Her fate now appeared inevitable, whilst her\r\nstrange manœuvres made her look like an insane vessel, rushing wildly from\r\nsome pursuer. Her mast and funnel hung over the side, her bulwarks were\r\nsmashed, and the long tiller was dashing wildly to and fro; the dog on\r\nboard was barking, howling, and yelling fiercely, rendering the scene both\r\nludicrous and serious. Something evidently had to be done to save her. The\r\ncaptain and crew, having recovered their composure, obtained a boat from\r\nthe ship and started in pursuit. “Pull away, my boys; give it her!” was\r\nthe quick command. “Aye, aye, sir!” was the ready response, and the tough\r\noars bent to the stalwart efforts of the oarsmen. The boat sped onward in\r\nthe chase, but ere this the steam‐tug had on her own account altered her\r\ncoarse, and by some cause or other came round, and made again for the\r\npoint whence she had started. Having described a complete circle, she\r\nagain started off on a voyage _en zigzag_, and then made direct for\r\nCalshot lighthouse. Here the men on the look‐out descried her position,\r\nand having launched and manned their own boat, also started in pursuit.\r\nThe race now became truly exciting, the course of the steam‐tug being\r\nutterly uncertain and irresponsible, according as her helm shifted to and\r\nfro at the sport of the waters of the Channel. By this time, however, she\r\nhad run some distance, and at length her speed gradually diminished, her\r\nsteam giving out, when her paddles stopped from sheer exhaustion. The crew\r\nfrom the lighthouse were the first to board her, and her own crew coming\r\nup about twenty minutes after, she was at length got into working order,\r\nand brought safely into dock. It appears that the crew had some\r\njustification for leaving her, the vessel leaking seriously, and being in\r\nimminent peril of going down.\r\n\r\nFrom Southampton Water to the beautiful Isle of Wight is a natural\r\ntransition. To fully describe its coasts and fishing‐villages and\r\nwatering‐places, and other points of interest, would occupy a large\r\nvolume. Cowes and Ryde, with their regattas and generally festive look;\r\nOsborne, with its royal residence; Shanklin and Blackgang “Chines”;\r\nVentnor and Niton; Alum Bay and “the Needles,” will be familiar to the\r\nlarger number of our readers. Inseparably connected with the gay little\r\nisland must ever be remembered an event which cast a gloom not merely over\r\nthe households of hundreds of direct sufferers, but over the length and\r\nbreadth of the entire land. Need it be said that we refer to the terrible\r\nloss of that fine training‐ship the _Eurydice_, with its living freight of\r\nthree hundred young and promising sailor lads, in sight of land and home,\r\nand just as they were nearing, after long foreign service, the haven of\r\ntheir hopes.\r\n\r\n  “For there came down a squall, and the snow swept the wave\r\n  Like a white winding‐sheet for the brave man’s lone grave;\r\n  And with scarce time to glance a farewell at the sky,\r\n  The three hundred went down without e’en a cry.”\r\n\r\nOn the morning of March 25th, 1878, the country awoke to one of the most\r\npainful and unlooked‐for catastrophes that have befallen the navy during\r\nthe present century—that of the _Captain_ hardly excepted, for certain\r\ndoubts had always been felt as to how the bulky ironclad would behave in a\r\nheavy gale. “One of the finest corvettes of her class that ever floated,”\r\nsaid a competent authority, “commanded by a captain and officered by men\r\nof the highest professional experience, and with a crew young, but\r\nsufficiently trained, and numerous enough in nautical parlance to have\r\n‘torn her to pieces’, capsizes, with the loss of every soul on board her\r\nbut two. Such a calamity, taken in all its bearings and with such a loss\r\nof life, is unparalleled in the modern history of the navy. It is true\r\nthat about forty years ago a man‐of‐war schooner (the _Pincher_), very\r\nmuch over‐masted, was, off the ‘Owers,’ not very far from the same spot,\r\ncapsized in a heavy squall, and all her hands were lost, although she was\r\nin company with a corvette at the time. But the _Eurydice_ was not over‐\r\nmasted, and she went down in broad daylight and in smooth water. Yet where\r\nis the officer or the man—let him be the best seaman in the world—who can\r\nsay, ‘Such would not have been the _Eurydice’s_ fate had I commanded her?’\r\nThe fact is, the disaster, truly lamentable as it is, might have happened\r\nto any seaman. With a fair wind, smooth water, and within a short distance\r\nof her anchorage, running along too close under the high land of the Isle\r\nof Wight to notice the hurricane‐like squall rushing down upon her in time\r\nto prepare for it, the ship was literally forced under water, the\r\naccumulating weight of which eventually capsized her beyond recovery.\r\nAdverse comments have been made on the ports being open; but with a fair\r\nwind, smooth water, and Spithead close by, what danger could possibly be\r\napparent, to cause them to be closed after a sea‐voyage so nearly ended?\r\nHad the _Eurydice_ met with the same squall at sea she would have\r\nweathered it.”(57)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H.M.S. “EURYDICE” ON HER BEAM‐ENDS JUST AFTER THE SQUALL.]\r\n\r\nThe court‐martial which assembled on the 27th of August, 1878, on board\r\nthe _Duke of Wellington_ flagship, under the presidency of Admiral\r\nFanshawe, C.B., Commander‐in‐Chief at Portsmouth, reported that the ship\r\nhad foundered from pressure of wind upon her sails during a sudden and\r\nexceptionally dense snowstorm, which overtook her when its approach was\r\npartially hidden by the proximity of the ship to high land. “Some of the\r\nupper half‐ports on the main‐deck were open at the time, which materially\r\nconduced to the catastrophe; but the court considers that the upper half‐\r\nports having been open was justifiable and usual under the state of the\r\nwind and weather up to the time of the actual occurrence of the storm.”\r\nThe finding of the court‐martial mentioned the fact that the captain was\r\nfrequently on deck during the afternoon; and attributed blame to no one on\r\nboard. It considered the ship, which had had ten years’ sea service, to\r\nhave been thoroughly stable. A large number of other authorities, however,\r\nthought very differently—that she was top‐heavy, and that she was\r\nundoubtedly carrying too much sail.\r\n\r\nAfter exactly twenty‐three weeks from the day of her foundering the\r\n_Eurydice_ was, on Sunday, the 1st of September, safely towed into\r\nPortsmouth harbour. “As an example of perseverance and determination to\r\nsucceed, the recovery of the ship is unique. The elements, which\r\nthroughout the operations may truly be said to have fought against the\r\nefforts to float her being successful, made a final attempt to render\r\nthose endeavours abortive on the Thursday night and Friday morning, with\r\nsuch effect that the Admiralty deemed it inexpedient that further attempts\r\nshould be made, and had even gone to the extent of ordering her to be\r\ntaken to pieces where she lay. Rear‐Admiral Foley, and those who had so\r\nably and perseveringly worked with him, were, however, reluctant to\r\nabandon the attempt to recover the ship, and he pledged himself that he\r\nwould undertake to bring her into harbour. This pledge was redeemed.”(58)\r\nThe divers throughout the operations could work only at slack tides and in\r\nvery fine weather, the under‐currents on the Isle of Wight coast being\r\nexceptionally strong.\r\n\r\nThe _Eurydice_ lay at first in seven fathoms and a half (forty‐five feet)\r\nof water, and to this must be added eight or nine feet of mud into which\r\nthe wreck was embedded. Strong wire ropes were attached to the inner sides\r\nof the ports; the other ends of the ropes were made fast to the four\r\nfloating hulls placed over and across the _Eurydice_, and when everything\r\nwas ready and the tide at its lowest ebb, the process of pinning down was\r\ncommenced—that is, the ropes were hauled “taut,” and made fast to the\r\nlifting vessels, so that as the tide gradually rose to its highest point\r\nthe whole mass of lighters with the sunken vessel lifted as well. Then it\r\nwas that the steam‐tugs took up their positions, and towed the ill‐fated\r\ncraft towards shallower water, till she was left on a bank under the\r\nCulver cliff, with one side and her upper deck above the water at low\r\ntide. Even yet the efforts to float her were interfered with. Frequently\r\nall would be ready for lifting, when the sea would roughen, and everything\r\nhave to be abandoned, the lighters returning to Portsmouth. It was raised\r\npartially in August, 1878, after four months’ continuous labour. After\r\nlying for a few days under the Culver cliff, the _Eurydice_ was again\r\nsufficiently lifted to clear the bottom, and towed together with the\r\nlifting vessels to St. Helen’s Sands. When lifted finally, and towed to\r\nPortsmouth by the _Grinder_, she had two tugs on her port side and one on\r\nher starboard, with their steam‐pumps working, and constantly pumping her\r\nhold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBrighton—“London by the Sea‐side” as it is often styled—is to many one of\r\nthe most fascinating of the English watering‐places. It is both popular\r\nand fashionable, the resort alike of the masses and of the “upper ten.”\r\nIts position on the sea is charming, while at an easy distance are any\r\nnumber of pleasant sea‐coast and inland resorts. It has sprung up from a\r\nlittle fishing‐village to a town of at least 120,000 souls. One feature of\r\nthe place is the solidity and elegance of its public and private\r\nbuildings, while its streets are the best kept in the whole kingdom. It\r\nextends, with its suburbs Kemp Town and Cliftonville, for _four miles_\r\nalong the coast, and is in great part defended by a sea‐wall. The\r\ncelebrated chain‐pier is 1,130 feet in length; while its Aquarium, already\r\ndescribed in the proper place, is the finest in the world.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Brighton is temperate and mild both summer and winter, in\r\nthe latter season resembling that of Naples; and to these facts is\r\ndoubtless due its great success as a resort for the invalid, debilitated,\r\nor fagged‐out business man. Capital bathing, boating, and yachting, are\r\nall at the command of the visitor; there are no finer promenades anywhere;\r\nwhile riding or driving on the Downs, or to the neighbouring rural\r\nretreats (among them that most beautiful of England’s ancestral homes,\r\nArundel), is a treat open to all whose circumstances are moderately easy.\r\nIn the whirl and din of fashionable life there one is apt to forget its\r\npractical connection with the sea, but it possesses a perfect fleet of\r\nmackerel and herring boats, and several lifeboats, belonging to the\r\nLifeboat Institution, the Humane Society, and the town.\r\n\r\n                        [Illustration: BRIGHTON.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1833, at New Stoke, near Arundel, the remains of an ancient\r\nboat were discovered in the bed of what was formerly a creek running into\r\nthe river Arun. It had been constructed of half the trunk of an oak tree,\r\nhollowed out as the Indians of North‐west America do to‐day. It was\r\nthirty‐five feet four inches in length, by four feet six inches. In 1822,\r\na still larger oak boat was found in the bed of the river Rother, near\r\nMaltham, Kent, which was sixty‐three feet by fifteen feet, half decked,\r\ncaulked with moss, and had carried at least one mast.\r\n\r\nThese discoveries sink into insignificance with that made in 1880 on the\r\nfarm of Gokstad, not far from Sandefjord, a favourite watering‐place of\r\nthe Norwegians. A hill or mound, which tradition pointed out as the\r\nburial‐place of some mighty king or chief, was found to contain the entire\r\nhull of an old ship of the Viking days. It is of course a very venerable\r\nrelic, being probably more than 1,000 years old. The Gokstad vessel, built\r\nentirely of oak, is seventy‐five feet long between stem and stern, and\r\nsixteen feet broad amidships; and appears to be of a low build, drawing\r\nonly five feet. The deals were riveted together by iron nails; and the\r\nribs, of which there are twenty, are connected with the deals at the top\r\nby rivets, but at the bottom with ties. Amidships, in the bottom of the\r\nship, is a heavy beam, both ends of which are fashioned in the shape of a\r\nfish’s tail. This beam served as a support for the mast, of which there is\r\nstill a piece standing in its place; while the upper part, which had been\r\ncut off, was found in the vessel. The mast appears to have been about\r\ntwenty‐two feet long. Remains of two or three small boats were found; some\r\npieces inside the ship, and some pieces close to it. In the fore part of\r\nthe vessel a large copper kettle and water‐cask were also found, with\r\nremains of sails and ropes, and some large oars. She had been built for\r\nsixteen oars. A hundred wooden shields had been once placed in a row under\r\nthe gunwale of the ship, corresponding to the number of the crew, the\r\ncentre pieces of iron, or bosses, still remaining. The arrangement of the\r\nshields is the same as that in the famous Bayeux tapestry, on which are\r\nrepresented (among other things) the ships of William the Conqueror. The\r\nold vessel had been used as the last resting‐place of a great Viking. It\r\nwas their custom so to bury their chiefs. The ship was usually placed with\r\nits stem towards the sea, so that when Odin, the Jove of the northern\r\nmythology, should call the gallant chief, he could set sail straight off\r\nland for Valhalla, the heaven of his hopes.\r\n\r\nNewhaven, a little farther to the east, has a fair tidal harbour and some\r\nlocal commerce, but its chief feature is the very rapidly‐increasing\r\npassenger traffic between it and Dieppe, for Paris or London, and the\r\ntraveller who has not tried that route can be recommended to do so. The\r\nboats, some of them of steel and containing all modern improvements, are\r\namong the finest in the Channel service, making the trip to Dieppe usually\r\nin five or five‐and‐a‐half hours. The trip through Normandy and the valley\r\nof the Seine is varied and interesting, and preferable to that from Calais\r\nor Boulogne. Near Newhaven is the once flourishing town of Seaford, though\r\nit is now little better than a picturesque fishing‐village, in the bay of\r\nwhich mackerel are sometimes taken in prodigious quantities, and which\r\naffords shelter and anchorage for large vessels during the prevalence of\r\nstrong easterly winds.\r\n\r\nStill farther east, and at the extreme southern point of Sussex, stands\r\nthe bold promontory Beachy Head, the scene of many a shipwreck in days\r\ngone by. It would be a most difficult feat to scale this great chalk\r\ncliff; and yet the slope of broken _débris_, mingled with scanty grass and\r\nsamphire, steep though it be, does not look impracticable, nor indeed is\r\nit up to a certain point. The writer and his brother once managed to get\r\nwithin a very respectable distance of the top, but then the rocky stones\r\ncommenced rolling down, bringing both climbers with them. After many an\r\nineffectual attempt to secure a hold by clinging to the samphire, and\r\nintervals of momentary rest, neither was very sorry to reach the stony\r\nbeach, albeit considerably bruised, battered, and torn. There they found\r\nthe sea had cut off their retreat towards Eastbourne, and before they\r\ncould reach the shore they had to wade through the fast‐rising tide round\r\none or two projecting corners of the cliff.\r\n\r\nIn the month of November, 1821, a dreadful storm visited Beachy Head,\r\nduring which a French vessel was driven ashore and wrecked. All on board\r\nwere swept into the sea, and only four escaped the general destruction, by\r\nclimbing to the top of a heap of rocks which had fallen, at different\r\ntimes, from the overhanging cliffs. Their perilous situation can easily be\r\nconceived; the tide was encroaching upon them step by step, and it was\r\ncertain destruction to attempt to gain the land. The night was extremely\r\ndark, and the thunder and lightning rendered it still more awful. The poor\r\nmen, finding that they would either be swallowed up by the rising tide or\r\ndashed to pieces against the rocks, determined to deliver themselves up to\r\nthe mercy of the waves, with the forlorn hope of being cast on some place\r\nof safety. At this time one of the men saw, during some flashes of\r\nlightning, a plant growing amongst the stones on which they stood, which\r\nhe knew was samphire, and which he also happened to know never grew where\r\nit could be entirely covered with water. He at once acquainted his fellow‐\r\nsufferers with this fact, and persuaded them to remain where they were\r\ntill morning, being convinced that the height of the tide would not be\r\nquite equal to that of the place on which they stood. The event proved the\r\ncorrectness of his information and the value of his knowledge, for when\r\ndaylight broke the poor fellows were seen, and rescued from their\r\ndangerous situation.\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: DISCOVERING THE SAMPHIRE ON THE ROCK.]\r\n\r\nNo part of the south coast formerly required more vigilant guarding than\r\nthat for many miles on either side of Beachy Head. The coastguardsman had\r\nhis hands full then; his lot is better now. “Amongst the most agreeable\r\nobjects that enliven the shores of our island,” writes the _Saturday\r\nReview_, “are the groups of cottages occupied by the coastguard.\r\nPicturesque one can scarcely call them, for the architecture is simple to\r\nbaldness, and suggestive of Government contracts kept down by close\r\ncompetition, and yet they have generally the picturesqueness of\r\ncomfortable contrast with surroundings that are often bleak and\r\ninhospitable. Dating from the days when our coasts were regularly\r\npicketed, and a blockade was methodically established against the\r\nenterprise of the free‐traders, we come upon them in every variety of\r\nsituation. Now they are arranged bastion‐wise on a commanding eminence, in\r\nthe suburb of some seaport or watering place, in a snug, compact, little\r\nsquare, with a tall flagstaff in the centre. Again we stumble on them\r\nunexpectedly, sheltered in the recess of some ‘gap’ or ‘chine’ where a\r\nlittle stream comes trickling down to the sands through the deep cleft\r\nthat time seems to have worn in the chalk cliffs. Most frequently they are\r\nperched on the crest of the line of sand‐hills, with a broad look‐out in\r\nall directions over ‘promontory, cape, and bay.’ And often they form a\r\nconspicuous landmark on some flat stretch of grass‐grown sand, where the\r\nslow‐shelving shore is intersected by a labyrinth of changing channels,\r\nand where mud‐banks submerged by the rising tides are a perfect paradise\r\nfor the clamorous sea‐fowl. But whatever the situation, the general effect\r\nis almost invariably the same. They are substantial and watertight;\r\nsuggestive of cheery shelter in bright interiors when the wind is howling\r\nthrough the shrouds of the flagstaff, driving the sand and gravel in\r\nflying scud along the beach, and churning and grinding the pebbles in the\r\nsurf with dull, monotonous roar. There are low flat roofs with projecting\r\neaves, and small, strongly‐secured casements, and the gleam of their\r\nspotless whitewash catches any sunlight that may be going. In the neatly‐\r\npalisaded little gardens that stretch before the door, a hard and not‐\r\nunsuccessful struggle is always going on with the unfriendly elements,\r\nwhile the shell‐strewn walks are invariably kept in the most perfect\r\norder. As you approach them of a warm summer afternoon you are conscious\r\nof the briny breeze just tainted with a faint amphibious smell of tar. It\r\nmay not be so balmy or romantic as the resinous odours that breathe from\r\nthe pine‐woods of Bayonne or Arcachon, under the fiercer rays of the sun\r\nof Gascony; but it is decidedly wholesome, and rather savoury than\r\notherwise. The promiscuous use of pitch and tar gratifies the nautical\r\naffections of the inmates. Everything is paid, caulked, and seamed, from\r\nthe keels of the white‐painted boats that are hauled up bottom upwards, to\r\nthe felt‐covered shingles over the out‐houses, and the frames of the\r\ncottage windows, and the palings of the enclosure. Everything, even to the\r\nconcealed refuse‐heaps, is trim and ship‐shape, showing the presence of an\r\neasy discipline and the predominance of habits of tidiness and order.”\r\n\r\nThen the _Review_ goes on to describe the exciting and perilous post of\r\nthe coastguard when import duties were excessive, and lucky smugglers made\r\nrapid fortunes. “The sympathies of the whole adjacent country were against\r\nthem. Half the country people were employed from time to time in running\r\nillicit cargoes, and made a very good thing of it. Those were the days of\r\nhard drinking, and farmers almost openly encouraged a trade that dropped\r\nkegs of cheap hollands and runlets of pure French brandy at their very\r\ndoors. As for the women, of course—to say nothing of their romantic\r\nsympathies with daring law‐breakers—they were all in favour of the men who\r\nfilled and sweetened the cheering tea‐cup, that would otherwise have been\r\naltogether beyond their means. Even gentlemen holding His Majesty’s\r\ncommission of the peace were said to connive at the ‘fair trade’ for a\r\nconsideration, and to express no surprise at the production of mysterious\r\ncasks that had been concealed in out‐of‐the‐way corners of their premises.\r\nThere were certain depôts, in dry caverns, in remote homesteads or\r\nsequestered barns, the secret of which was religiously preserved, although\r\nit was the common property of highly questionable characters. There were\r\ncodes of signals which could be clearly read by all but the preventive\r\nmen, and which gave notice of danger or of a favourable opportunity, as\r\nthe case might be. The officer in charge of the station had his faculties\r\npreternaturally sharpened, and could scent something wrong in the most\r\nnatural incidents. The wreaths of smoke rising from a heap of burning\r\nweeds might convey a warning to some expected vessel. A fishing‐boat\r\nputting out to sea, engaged apparently in its lawful business, might\r\nreally be bound on a similar errand. Then it was the business of the day‐\r\nwatch to scan carefully each craft that appeared off the coast, and his\r\nnatural vigilance was stimulated by the prize‐money that might fall to his\r\nshare. Then the nocturnal promenade was no mere formality. The thicker the\r\nnight the more likely that something might be going on under cover of the\r\nfog; and the ear of the look‐out was always bent to distinguish, amidst\r\nthe murmur of the waves, the sound of suppressed voices, or the plash of\r\nmuffled oars. Nor was the walk by any means free from personal danger, and\r\nindeed it was seldom taken in solitude; for, even apart from the\r\ninveterate animosity existing between the smugglers and the preventive\r\nmen, those were days when deeds of violence were common, and the life of a\r\nman was of little account compared to the safety of a cargo that might be\r\nworth hundreds or thousands of pounds. If he chanced to fall over the\r\ncliff by accident, everything might be satisfactorily settled before he\r\nwas replaced; for when a smuggling lugger stood in for the coast there\r\nwere plenty of ready hands to help to discharge her cargo; and unless the\r\nmen of the nearest preventive station got assistance from elsewhere, there\r\nwas little left for them but to look on helplessly. Boats from the nearest\r\nfishing hamlets swarmed in about the smuggler; strings of horses, in\r\ncharge of people armed to the teeth, made their way to the coast from the\r\ninland farms. The contraband goods, in kegs and bags of convenient size\r\nfor easy landing, were transferred from the ship to the boat, from the\r\nboat to the beach, from the beach to the pack‐saddle, with incredible\r\ncelerity; and when the mounted caravans set themselves in motion, those\r\nwho had assisted at the landing hastened to vanish as they had come. On\r\nthese occasions the smugglers scored a trick in the game, and the\r\ncoastguard had nothing for it but to wait their turn of revenge with\r\nredoubled vigilance. More frequently, however, they succeeded in spoiling\r\nsport, for it paid the smuggler amply to run one cargo in three. The\r\nGovernment people would keep such a sharp look‐out that, oftener than not,\r\nthe friends of the free‐traders could only help them by signalling danger,\r\nand the richly‐freighted lugger had to put up her helm in despair, perhaps\r\nwith one of the revenue cutters in hot pursuit; or, what was better still,\r\nthe enemy was surprised in the very act of unlading, and a valuable\r\ncapture was effected. Of course a successful exploit of this kind was by\r\nno means all pleasure and pride. The smugglers with their friends,\r\ndisguised by blackened faces, were sure to show fight if they had any\r\nchance. As they were busy in the bay, and the unloading was going briskly\r\nforward, their sentinels would give the signal of alarm, and the long\r\ngalleys of the coastguard would be seen pulling fast inshore, and stealing\r\nlike wolves on their prey from round the nearest headland. The attacking\r\nforce would make free play with its muskets and carbines, if it came\r\nwithin reach, and the attacked had to consider that their enemies on the\r\nwater had probably allies on the land in the shape of excise officers\r\nbacked up by soldiers. So the next act in the drama was a _sauve qui\r\npeut_, conducted with more or less order, and covered with a lavish use of\r\ncutlasses and firearms. Very possibly the victors had to count the dead,\r\nand pick up the wounded; and thus the romance and excitement of those days\r\nwere spiced with a very sensible element of danger.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\n               SKETCHES OF OUR SOUTH COASTS (_concluded_).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Eastbourne and its Quiet Charms—Hastings—Its Fishermen—The Battle\r\n       of Hastings—Loss of the _Grosser Kurfürst_—The Collision—The\r\n     Catastrophe—Dover—The Castle—Shakespeare’s Cliff—“O’er the Downs\r\n           so free”—St. Margaret’s Bay—Kingsdown—Deal—A Deed of\r\n      Daring—Ramsgate and Margate—The Floating Light on the Goodwin\r\n      Sands—Ballantyne’s Voluntary Imprisonment—His Experiences—The\r\n     Craft—The Light—One Thousand Wild Ducks caught—A Signal from the\r\n               “South Sand Head”—The Answer—Life on Board.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coast north‐east from Beachy Head is rugged and interesting till\r\nEastbourne is reached, one of the quietest and prettiest of the south‐\r\ncoast watering‐places, and one which has been very greatly improved of\r\nlate by the lavish expenditure of his Grace the Duke of Devonshire, the\r\nprincipal landowner in the neighbourhood. Some of the promenades are\r\nplanted with trees _à la boulevard_. The bathing and boating are both\r\nexcellent; while in the neighbourhood are the ruins of Pevensey, an old\r\nNorman castle, and Hurstmonceaux, a red‐brick castle of the mediæval\r\nperiod, ivy‐and creeper‐covered, and embowered in trees. It is the delight\r\nof artists, who annually besiege it in great numbers. Eastbourne has some\r\nhundred fishermen engaged in the herring and mackerel fisheries. They have\r\na benefit association or club, into which they pay a monthly subscription,\r\nand when their nets are damaged or lost a part of the money needed to\r\nrepair or replace them is found. There is also a lifeboat, which has done\r\nexcellent work.\r\n\r\nAnd next in sequence comes historical Hastings, which extends for near a\r\nmile along the sea at the present time, or, if we include the fashionable\r\ntown of St. Leonard’s‐on‐Sea, its sea front must be reckoned at nearly\r\nthree miles. Many readers will be familiar with the charming glen or vale\r\nin which it is situated, and which opens to the sea on the south. Hastings\r\nis otherwise sheltered by high hills and cliffs, and has a warm, even, and\r\nyet bracing climate; for salubrity it will rank with any of the popular\r\nsea‐side resorts. It has a steady population of about 35,000, of whom 700\r\nare fishermen and boatmen. In one week the herring catch has been worth\r\n£5,000. A boat fitted for the herring or mackerel season is worth £350,\r\nand for trawling £200. The mackerel season commences in April and\r\ncontinues till the latter end of July, while the trawling commences and\r\nends two or two and a half months later. The herring season commences in\r\nSeptember and ends in the latter part of November. There is a church at\r\nHastings, under the eastern cliffs, for the special accommodation of\r\nfishermen.\r\n\r\nThe famous battle of Hastings was fought A.D. 1066, Oct. 14. The alarm\r\nsounded, both parties immediately prepared for action; but the English\r\nspent the night previous to it in riot and jollity, whilst the Normans\r\nwere occupied in the duties of religion. On the morning the Duke called\r\ntogether his principal officers, and ordered the signal of battle to be\r\ngiven. Then the whole army, moving at once, and singing the hymn or song\r\nof Roland, advanced in order and with alacrity towards the English.\r\n\r\nHarold had seized the advantage of a rising ground, and, having secured\r\nhis flanks with trenches, resolved to stand upon the defensive, and to\r\navoid an engagement with the cavalry, in which he was inferior. The\r\nKentish men were placed in the van, a post of honour which they always\r\nclaimed as their due. The Londoners guarded the standard; and the King\r\nhimself, accompanied by his two valiant brothers, Gurth and Leofwin,\r\ndismounting from his horse, placed himself at the head of his infantry,\r\nand expressed his resolution to conquer or to die. The first attack of the\r\nNormans was desperate, but was received with equal valour by the English,\r\nand the former began to retreat, when William hastened to their support\r\nwith a select band. His presence restored the courage of his followers,\r\nand the English in their turn were obliged to retire. They rallied again,\r\nhowever, assisted by the advantage of the ground, and William, in order to\r\ngain the victory, had recourse to a stratagem, which, had it failed, would\r\nhave resulted in his total ruin. He commanded his troops to allure the\r\nenemy from their position by the appearance of flight. The English\r\nfollowed with precipitation; the Normans faced upon them in the plain, and\r\ndrove them back with considerable slaughter. The artifice was a second\r\ntime repeated, with the same success; yet a great body of the English\r\nstill maintained themselves in firm array, and seemed determined to\r\ndispute the victory. While they were galled by the Norman archers behind,\r\nthey were attacked by the heavy‐armed infantry in front; and Harold\r\nhimself was slain by an arrow as he combated with great bravery at the\r\nhead of his men. The English, discouraged by the fall of their prince,\r\nfled on all sides. The memory of the eventful fight is kept green by the\r\nname of Hastings, and Battle Abbey, in its immediate neighbourhood.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: THE LAST OF THE _GROSSER KURFÜRST_.]\r\n\r\nSadly must all readers look back upon the morning of Friday, May the 31st,\r\n1878, when the _Grosser Kurfürst_ went down off Sandgate, so near to land\r\nthat the people on shore felt certain that the commander would be able to\r\nbeach her before she had time to sink, unhappily an entirely erroneous\r\nsupposition. Very shortly before this ever‐to‐be‐lamented catastrophe\r\noccurred, the German squadron, in command of Admiral Von Batsch, was\r\nsailing with a light easterly wind blowing down Channel with all the pomp\r\nand pardonable display of a force so numerically small yet so grandly\r\npowerful. The sea was perfectly smooth, the weather fine, and there seemed\r\nno more reason for anticipating the impending danger than if they had been\r\nlying at anchor in the sunlit harbour of Bremen.\r\n\r\nThe squadron consisted of three vessels, sailing in two columns—the _König\r\nWilhelm_, carrying the admiral’s flag, and the _Preussen_ forming the port\r\ndivision, the _Grosser Kurfürst_ forming the starboard, and less than two\r\nships’ lengths apart from the admiral; indeed, it is said that scarcely\r\none length intervened.\r\n\r\n“In this formation the German squadron came across two sailing vessels\r\nhauled to the wind,” says the writer of the article from which we quote,\r\n“on the port tack, and consequently standing right across the bows of both\r\ndivisions. The _Grosser Kurfürst_ had first to give way, which she did at\r\nthe proper time and strictly in accordance with the rule of the road,\r\nporting her helm and passing under the stern of the first of these two\r\nsailing ships. But the _König Wilhelm_, which it must be borne in mind was\r\nclose to the _Grosser Kurfürst_ at this time, and steering a course\r\nparallel to her, endeavoured at first to cross the bows of the sailing\r\nvessel, but finding she had no room for this manœuvre, rapidly changed her\r\nplan, and, putting her helm hard a‐port, also stood under the stern of the\r\nsailing vessel. In the meanwhile the _Grosser Kurfürst_ had resumed her\r\noriginal course, and thus was lying right across the bows of the _König\r\nWilhelm_, as she came under the stern of the sailing barque almost at\r\nright angles to the original course.... The captain of the _Grosser\r\nKurfürst_, Graf Von Montz, seeing the terrible proximity of the _König\r\nWilhelm_, immediately put his vessel at full speed, hoping to cross her\r\nbows, but the space would not allow it. He then gave the order to port his\r\nhelm, hoping to lay his ship parallel to the course of the _König\r\nWilhelm_, but unfortunately for this also there was neither time nor\r\nspace.” All might have gone well up to this point, however, as it appears\r\nthe _König Wilhelm_ was in charge of an “able and experienced officer;” he\r\nhad given the order to port the helm to steer clear of the sailing vessel,\r\nand then ordered the helm to be “immediately steadied,” intending to range\r\nup alongside the _Grosser Kurfürst_; but the helmsman had become\r\nbewildered, and instead of steadying put the helm still more port. The\r\n_König Wilhelm_ was put at full speed astern, and the fatal crash could\r\nnot be avoided. All now was confusion on both vessels.\r\n\r\nThe _König Wilhelm_ carried away everything from the point where she\r\nstruck the _Grosser Kurfürst_ to the stern, “ripping off the armour\r\nplating like the skin of an orange.” The bowsprit of the _König Wilhelm_\r\nfouled the rigging of the ill‐starred ship and brought down the mizzen\r\ntop‐gallant‐mast on the quarter‐deck, and the quarter boats were swept\r\naway “like strips of paper.”\r\n\r\nThe doomed iron‐clad went down in seven minutes; on board there was\r\nscarcely time left the officers and crew to think much less to act with\r\neffect. The boats that had not been smashed could hardly be got into the\r\nwater; the hammocks had been stowed in some unusual place, so that it was\r\nuseless to attempt to get at them, and thus a very perfect means of escape\r\nwas cut off from the 280 poor fellows that were drowned.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: THE “KÖNIG WILHELM” ENTERING PORTSMOUTH HARBOUR AFTER THE\r\n                               COLLISION.]\r\n\r\nThe experience of the first lieutenant when the vessel was going down\r\nunder the very eyes of a number of people on shore is interesting in the\r\nextreme. He felt himself sucked in, and describes a sensation of enormous\r\npressure on his ribs, as if the water were forcing him down. Then he came\r\nacross another column of water, which as promptly vomited him up to the\r\nsurface again, when he caught hold of a spar, and saved his life. A\r\ndreadful fate befell some thirty unfortunate sailors, who, in spite of the\r\ncommands and entreaties of the boatswain, who was standing on the\r\nforecastle, threw themselves over the bows, and endeavoured to swim away.\r\nBut the sinking ship was too fast for them, and they were caught in the\r\nnetting which is stretched under the jibboom, and, thus entangled, were\r\ncarried down with the ship. The disabled _König Wilhelm_ was almost\r\nimmediately towed into Portsmouth for repairs.(59)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDover is by no means so generally known as many less interesting places on\r\nthe south coast, for the larger number of those who depart for or arrive\r\nfrom the Continent usually pass it by. It has been often incidentally\r\nmentioned in these pages, but no description of its special attractions\r\nhas yet been given.\r\n\r\nIt is situated not far from the South Foreland, in the extreme south‐east\r\ncorner of Kent, on the narrowest part of the British Channel, and only\r\nsome twenty miles from the opposite coast of France. Hence it is the port\r\nfor steamers crossing to Calais on the Continental service, a trip usually\r\nmade in about one hour and three‐quarters. If the reader should cross on\r\nthe now‐famous _Calais‐Douvres_, the luxurious and easy‐riding twin\r\nvessel, he will hardly require the advice relative to the _mal de mer_\r\ncontained in a previous chapter. Dover, though comparatively little used\r\nas a watering‐place, possesses excellent accommodation for\r\nvisitors—bathing‐machines, and all the usual paraphernalia of such places.\r\nIts grand hotel, “The Lord Warden,” is second to none in England, and has\r\nsheltered scores of crowned heads and coroneted aristocrats, as well as\r\nthe less distinguished, though perhaps equally worthy, Jones, Brown,\r\nSmith, and Robinson.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of the town stands that elevated and noble fortress\r\nthe Castle, of which some description has already been given. A short\r\ndistance from it the chalk cliff rises 370 feet above the sea, and hard by\r\nstands a beautiful piece of brass ordnance, 24 feet in length, which bears\r\nthe name of “Queen Elizabeth’s Pocket Pistol,” and was presented to her\r\nMajesty by the States of Holland. It is said to carry a 12‐lb. ball to a\r\ndistance of seven miles. It is curiously adorned with a variety of\r\ndevices, typifying the blessings of peace and the horrors of war. On its\r\nbreech is the following motto in Dutch, which, freely translated,\r\nsignifies:—\r\n\r\n  “O’er hill and dale I throw my ball,\r\n  Breaker my name of mound and wall.”\r\n\r\nTo the westward of the town rises the majestic headland named after our\r\nimmortal bard. Shakespeare’s cliff rears its lofty head _at the present\r\ntime_ to an altitude of 350 feet, but in the great dramatist’s day its\r\nsummit was much higher, as indicated by the enormous boulders and heaps of\r\n_débris_ at its base, the result of frequent landslips and falls.\r\nShakespeare well describes this grand precipice:—\r\n\r\n  “Come on, sir; here’s the place: stand still. How fearful\r\n  And dizzy ’tis, to cast one’s eyes so low!\r\n  The crows and choughs that wing the midway air\r\n  Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down\r\n  Hangs one that gathers samphire—dreadful trade!\r\n  Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:\r\n  The fishermen that walk upon the beach\r\n  Appear like mice; and yon tall anchoring bark,\r\n  Diminished to her cock; her cock, a buoy,\r\n  Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge,\r\n  That on the unnumbered idle pebbles chafes,\r\n  Cannot be heard so high. I’ll look no more,\r\n  Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight\r\n  Topple down headlong.”\r\n\r\n                          [Illustration: DOVER.]\r\n\r\nFrom the heights about Dover the views are magnificent. Seaward is the\r\nbeautiful bay, the Straits and the Downs, with its ever‐changing fleets,\r\nthe ships of all nations. Stretching one’s vision a little farther are\r\nseen the lofty white cliffs of the French coast; Cape Grisnez, near Calais\r\n(which itself lies on low land, and is therefore undiscernible), and the\r\nheights of Boulogne.\r\n\r\nThe antiquity of Dover is undeniable. Julius Cæsar here made his first\r\ndescent on Britain, in August, B.C. 55. Picts and Scots, Danes and\r\nNormans, successively attacked it; while at the period of the Conquest,\r\n1066, the town suffered fearfully, the whole place being reduced to ashes\r\nexcept twenty‐nine houses. But when it became one of the Cinque Ports it\r\nsoon rose in importance, and Dover men largely helped that brilliant\r\nattack on Philip IV.’s fleet, by which France lost 240 vessels. That\r\nenraged monarch retaliated on Dover by burning the larger part of the\r\ntown; but before the year 1296 the British navy had not merely swept the\r\nenemy from the Channel, but had made several reprisals on the coast of\r\nFrance. At the period of the Armada, Dover, with the other Cinque Ports,\r\nfitted out, at a cost of £43,000, six large ships for the Queen’s service,\r\nwhich were the means of decoying the great _Galleas_ of Spain on a shoal,\r\nafterwards engaging and burning her.\r\n\r\nRiding or walking over the Downs some interesting places may be seen on or\r\nnear the coast. At St. Margaret’s Bay, seven miles north from Dover—to the\r\nmerits of the lobsters of which the present writer can testify, having\r\nboth caught and eaten them—there is a pretty little fishing‐village, with\r\n“Fisherman’s Inn” embowered in trees, at the base of lofty cliffs. Here\r\nthe preliminary borings for the possible Channel Tunnel of the future were\r\nmade. Farther on is Kingsdown, a fishing village and lifeboat station, the\r\nmen and boat of which have done specially good service in saving life.\r\nVisible from thence is Walmer Castle and quaint old Deal, so often\r\nmentioned in these pages in connection with lifeboat work on the Goodwin\r\nSands, themselves also plainly in sight. Riding at anchor in Deal Roads,\r\nor outward bound, or on the homeward tack, are seen ships, great and\r\nlittle, flying the colours of every maritime nation under the sun. The\r\ntrip from Dover to Deal and back can be made by any tolerable pedestrian\r\nin a day, allowing time for visits to all the points just named. That part\r\nof the trip from Dover to St. Margaret’s Bay can be made over the Downs\r\nonly, but thence to Deal the coast can be easily followed.\r\n\r\nComing nearer home, the writer must record a case of “derring‐do,” which\r\nwill prove—if after what these pages have recorded of the men of Deal and\r\nWalmer and Kingsdown, of Ramsgate and Margate, further proof were\r\nneeded—that the men of the North and South Foreland are not degenerate\r\ndescendants of their forefathers, who sailed and fought and died with\r\nBlake and Nelson. It occurred in Deal on a Sunday morning in bleak\r\nDecember. A whole gale was blowing from the south‐west and vessels in the\r\ncomparatively sheltered Downs were riding to both anchors. As the various\r\ncongregations were leaving their respective places of worship umbrellas\r\nwere blown inside out, and children were taken off their feet or clung\r\nfrightened to their parents’ limbs, the wind and spray along Deal beach\r\nbeing blinding. Let the “Chaplain” (_nom de plume_ of the excellent\r\nclergyman who superintends the Missions to Seamen) tell the tale. “Just\r\nthen,” he writes, “in answer to the boom of the distant gun, the bell rang\r\nto man the lifeboat, and the Deal boatmen gallantly answered to the\r\nsummons. A rush was made for the life‐belts and for the coxswain’s house.\r\nThe coxswain, Robert Wilds, has for fifteen years held the yoke‐lines\r\nthrough the surf on the sands, and knows the powers of the boat to save.\r\nFourteen men besides the coxswain were the crew, and with a mighty rush\r\nthey launched the good boat down the steep beach to the rescue. There were\r\nthree vessels on the Goodwins. The crew of one took to their boats, and\r\nnot being in the worst part of the sands got safe round the North Foreland\r\nto Margate. Another schooner, supposed to be a Dane, disappeared, and was\r\nlost with all hands. The third, a German barque, the _Leda_, with a crew\r\nof seventeen ‘all told,’ was stuck fast in the worst part of the\r\nsands—viz., the South Spit, on which even on a fine day the writer has\r\nencountered a dangerous and peculiar boil or tumble of seas. The barque’s\r\nmain and mizen masts by this time were gone, and the crew were clinging to\r\nthe weather bulwarks, while sheets of solid water made a clean breach over\r\nthem—so much so that from cold and long exposure the captain was almost\r\nexhausted. The Deal life‐boat, the _Van Kook_, fetched a little to\r\nwindward of the devoted barque, and dropping anchor, veered down on her.\r\nOne cable being too short, another was bent on to it, and closer and\r\ncloser came the lifeboat. If the cable parted and the lifeboat struck the\r\nship with full force, not a man would probably have survived to tell the\r\ntale; or if they got to leeward of the barque the crew of the wreck would\r\nhave been lost, as the lifeboat could not again have worked ‘to weather’\r\nto drop down as before. No friendly steam‐tug was at hand to help the\r\nlifeboat to windward in case of failure in this their first attempt, and\r\nboth the crew in distress and their rescuers were well aware of the stake\r\nat issue, and that this was the last chance. But the lifeboat crew said,\r\n‘We’re bound to save them,’ and with all the coolness of the race, yet\r\n‘daring all that men dare do,’ they concentrated their energies on getting\r\nclose enough to the wreck to throw their line, and yet to keep far enough\r\noff to ensure the boat’s safety. They were now beaten and hustled by the\r\ntremendous seas breaking into and over them, and no other boat could have\r\nlived a moment in the cauldron of waters seething and raging around them.\r\nNotwithstanding the self‐emptying power of the wondrous boat, the seas\r\nbroke into her in such quick succession that she was and remained full up\r\nto her thwarts while alongside the vessel, and as each cataract came on\r\nboard the coxswain sang out, ‘Look out, men!’ and they grasped the thwarts\r\nand held on with both hands, breathless, for dear life. One sea hurled the\r\nlifeboat against the ship, and stove in her fore air‐box, so that the\r\nsafety of all made it necessary to sheer off. Another sea prostrated two\r\nmen under her thwarts. The lifeboat’s throw‐line was at last got on board\r\nthe barque, and communication being established the crew were drawn on\r\nboard the lifeboat through the raging waves by ones or twos, as the seas\r\npermitted. Thus saved from the jaws of death, so astonished were the\r\nrescued crew at the submerged condition of the lifeboat and the awful\r\nturmoil of water around them that some of them wished to get back to their\r\nperishing vessel; but the coxswain and crew knew the powers of their\r\ngallant boat. ‘Up foresail and cut the cable,’ and with its goodly freight\r\nof thirty‐four souls the lifeboat, hurled like a feather, sometimes dead\r\nbefore the wind, and next moment ‘taken aback,’ plunged into the surf for\r\nhome. One of the rescued crew had twice before been saved by the same boat\r\n(the _Van Kook_), and encouraged his comrades with a recital of his\r\nprevious deliverances. Some rum, which was brought for the use of the\r\nlifeboat crew, was generously given by them and all used by the perishing\r\nmen of the barque. And so at last, sodden through and through, exhausted,\r\nbut gloriously successful, they landed the staggering and grateful Germans\r\non the Deal beach, where, despite the storm, crowds met them with\r\nwondering and thankful hearts.”\r\n\r\nAmong nearly all classes who dwell near and love the sea the same heroic\r\nspirit prevails. Only in 1879 Lord Dunmore, with John M‘Rae, Ewen M‘Leod,\r\nand Norman Macdonald, put out to sea in a furious Atlantic gale, in the\r\nnoble Scottish peer’s _undecked_ cutter, the _Dauntless_, when no other\r\nboat would venture out at all, and saved the lives of several men, women,\r\nand children from the yacht _Astarte_, wrecked on a small island‐rock\r\nbetween Harris and the North Uist coast (west coast of Scotland). The\r\nnoble hero of this gallant band is a Murray of the ducal tree of Atholl,\r\nsharing the savage motto, “Forth fortune, and fill the fetters.” The\r\nspirit of daring adventure which spurred his forefathers to feats of\r\nreckless foray and ruthless feud has, in a milder age, developed into the\r\nperformance of deeds of valour for the benefit of suffering humanity.\r\n\r\nSad to say, occasionally, there is another story to be told. In February,\r\n1880, some strapping fishermen refused to make up the complement of the\r\nBlackpool lifeboat—some of her own men being away fishing off North Wales,\r\nand others at Fleetwood—and remained leafing on the beach while they let\r\nthe coxswain take in two joiners and a stonemason, and then start two\r\nshort of the complement. Nevertheless four persons were saved from the\r\nwreck of the _Bessie Jones_, under circumstances most honourable to the\r\nrescuers. On their return, being obliged to run over the bank with a\r\ntremendous sea running, they had the narrowest escape from being capsized;\r\none man was washed out of the boat, but was recovered, and most of the\r\nloose tackle was swept overboard and irretrievably lost.\r\n\r\n                        [Illustration: RAMSGATE.]\r\n\r\nPopular Ramsgate, with its fashionably select annexe St. Lawrence‐on‐Sea,\r\nis so well known by all, that no lengthened description is required here,\r\nfor its actual and practical connection with the sea, in the noble work\r\ndone by its lifeboatsmen, has already been detailed. Ramsgate has a fine\r\nharbour and piers, from which the “husbands’ boat” is often, more\r\nespecially on Saturdays, watched and longed for by hundreds of wives and\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\nMargate had, in Queen Elizabeth’s reign, fifteen boats and other vessels,\r\nranging from one to eighteen tons, there being four of the latter. It had\r\n108 inhabited houses. It now has a floating population of 50,000 to 70,000\r\npeople, the permanent residents being about 15,000 in number. There are\r\nseveral pilots, and a large number of luggers employed in fishing and in\r\nseeking for casualties; it owns a certain number of coasting vessels;\r\nwhile a large number of coasters and French fishing‐boats come in during\r\nthe winter months and fishing season for refuge, repairs, and provisions.\r\nMargate has a Seaman’s Room and Observatory, and Ramsgate a Seaman’s\r\nInfirmary. The local agents of the Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society have\r\ntheir hands full in winter, and generally at other seasons in stormy\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE GULF STREAM LIGHT VESSEL ON THE GOODWIN SANDS.]\r\n\r\nWho that has visited Ramsgate or Margate, has not, some time or other in\r\nhis or her life, nourished an all‐absorbing curiosity to peep into the\r\ninterior and solve the mysteries of those distant beacons, the “Floating\r\nLight Ships.” Those who have seen them either lying peacefully on the\r\ntranquil bosom of the sunlit ocean, or trembling and shaken in Neptune’s\r\nangry moods, still valiant and isolated, nobly doing their duty, must\r\noften have wished to get a closer view. That natural curiosity can be\r\ngratified at last; the curtain has been raised, so that we may peep into\r\nthe mysteries of the flame‐coloured sphinxes, by a writer(60) who went\r\ninto voluntary imprisonment for one week on the Gulf Stream Light Vessel,\r\none of three floating lights which mark the Goodwin Sands.\r\n\r\n“That curious, almost ridiculous‐looking craft,” writes Mr. Ballantyne,\r\n“was among the aristocracy of shipping. Its important office stamped it\r\nwith nobility. It lay there, conspicuous in its royal colour, from day to\r\nday and year to year, to mark the fair‐way between Old England and the\r\noutlying shoals, distinguished in daylight by a huge ball at its mast‐\r\nhead, and at night by a magnificent lantern, with argand lamps and concave\r\nreflectors, which shot rays like lightning far and wide over the watery\r\nwaste, while in thick weather, when neither ball nor light could be\r\ndiscerned, a sonorous gong gave its deep‐toned warning to the approaching\r\nmariner, and let him know his position amidst the surrounding dangers.”\r\n\r\nHere the writer bestows well‐deserved praise upon the services,\r\n“disinterested and universal,” of this lonely craft, and afterwards tells\r\nyou what would meet the eye, if, leaning against the stern, you gazed\r\nalong the deck forward.\r\n\r\n“It was an interesting kingdom in detail. Leaving out of view all that\r\nwhich was behind him, and which, of course, he could not see, we may\r\nremark that just before him stood the binnacle and compass, and the cabin\r\nskylight. On his right and left the territory of the quarter deck was\r\nseriously circumscribed and the promenade much interfered with by the\r\nship’s boats, which, like their parent, were painted red, and which did\r\nnot hang at the davits, but, like young lobsters of the kangaroo type,\r\nfound shelter within their mother when not at sea on their own account.\r\nNear to them were two signal carronades. Beyond the skylight rose the\r\nbright brass funnel of the cabin chimney, and the winch by means of which\r\nthe lantern was hoisted. Then came another skylight and the companion\r\nhatch about the centre of the deck. Just beyond this stood the most\r\nimportant part of the vessel—the lantern‐house. This was a circular wooden\r\nstructure about six feet in diameter, with a door and small windows.\r\n\r\n“Inside was the lantern—the beautiful piece of mechanism for which the\r\nlight‐ship, its crew and appurtenances, were maintained. Right through the\r\ncentre of this house rose the thick, unyielding mast of the vessel. The\r\nlantern, which was just a little less than its house, surrounded the mast\r\nand travelled upon it.” Immediately at sundown the order “Up lights” was\r\ngiven, regular as the sun itself. The lantern was connected with the rod\r\nand pinion, by means of which with the clock‐work beneath, the light was\r\nmade to revolve and “flash” once every third of a minute. The glass of the\r\nlantern is frequently broken, not by wind and wave, but by the sea‐birds,\r\nwhich dash violently against it. In a single night, nine panes of a light‐\r\nhouse were shattered from this cause. On one occasion one thousand wild\r\nducks were caught by the crew of a light‐ship. It is necessary to defend\r\nwith trellis‐work the lights most exposed.\r\n\r\nThe cabin of the Floating Light was marvellously neat and clean.\r\nEverything was put away in its proper place, not only as the result of\r\norder and discipline, but on account of the extreme smallness of the\r\ncabin. The author of the work from which we quote depicts a scene on board\r\nduring a night of storms when a wreck and unexpected rescue took place:—“A\r\nlittle before midnight, while I was rolling uneasily in my ‘bunk,’\r\ncontending with sleep and sea‐sickness, and moralising on the madness of\r\nthose who choose ‘the sea’ for a profession, I was roused—and sickness\r\ninstantly cured—by the watch on deck suddenly shouting down the hatchway\r\nto the mate, ‘South Sand Head light is firing, sir, and sending up\r\nrockets.’ The mate sprang from his ‘bunk,’ and was on the cabin‐floor\r\nbefore the sentence was well finished. I followed suit, and pulled on\r\ncoat, nether garments, and shoes, as if my life depended on my own speed.\r\nThere was unusual need for clothing, for the night was bitterly cold. On\r\ngaining the deck, we found the two men on duty actively at work—the one\r\nloading the lee gun, the other adjusting a rocket to its stick. A few\r\nhurried questions from the mate elicited all that it was needful to know.\r\n\r\n“The flash of the gun from the ‘South Sand Head’ light‐ship, about six\r\nmiles off, had been distinctly seen a third time, and a third rocket went\r\nup, indicating that a vessel had struck upon the fatal Goodwin Sands. The\r\nreport of the gun could not be heard, owing to the gale carrying the sound\r\nto leeward, but the bright line of the rocket was distinctly visible. At\r\nthe same moment the glaring light of a burning tar‐barrel was observed. It\r\nwas the signal of the vessel in distress, just on the southern tail of the\r\nsands.\r\n\r\n“By this time the gun was charged, and the rocket in position.\r\n\r\n“One of the crew dived down the companion‐hatch, and in another moment\r\nreturned with a red‐hot poker, which the mate had thrust into the cabin\r\nfire at the first alarm. He applied it in quick succession to the gun and\r\nrocket. A blinding flash and deafening crash were followed by the whiz of\r\nthe rocket as it sprang with a magnificent curve far away into the\r\nsurrounding darkness.\r\n\r\n“This was their answer to the South Sand Head light, which, having fired\r\nthree guns and sent up three rockets to attract the attention of the\r\n_Gull_, then ceased firing. It was also their first note of warning to the\r\nlook‐out on the pier of Ramsgate Harbour. Of the three light‐ships that\r\nguarded the sands, the _Gull_ lay nearest to Ramsgate; hence, which ever\r\nof the other two happened to send up signals, the _Gull_ had to reply, and\r\nthenceforward to continue repeating them until the attention of the\r\nRamsgate look‐out should be gained, and a reply given.\r\n\r\n“The steam tug _Aid_, which always attends upon, and takes in tow, the\r\nRamsgate life‐boat, soon hove in sight, going to the rescue, thus showing\r\nthe great value of steam in such matters. Having learnt the direction of\r\nthe wreck from the mate of the light‐ship, they proceeded on their\r\ncourse.”\r\n\r\nThe life of the crew of every light‐ship is pretty much the same on\r\nSunday. At dawn the lantern is lowered and cleaned and prepared for the\r\nnext night’s work. At 8 a.m. all hands must be on the alert, the hammocks\r\nstowed, and breakfast served. At 10.30 the men assemble for prayers, and\r\nthe captain or mate performs divine service. After sunset the men meet\r\nagain for prayers. With the exception of the services, the routine on week\r\ndays is the same as on Sunday. The captain and mate take turn and turn—a\r\nmonth on board and a month on shore; the men do duty for two months on\r\nboard for one on shore; and, monotonous as their life may seem to the\r\nuninitiated, it is doubtful whether there is not a beneficial moral\r\nactivity in existence on a floating light that tends to elevate the\r\ncharacter of both officers and men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n             SKETCHES OF OUR EAST COASTS:—NORFOLK—YORKSHIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\n       Harwich; its fine Harbour—Thorpeness and its Hero—Beautiful\r\n    Situation of Lowestoft—Yarmouth; its Antiquity—Quays, Bridges—The\r\n      Roadstead—Herring and Mackerel Fishing—Curing Red Herrings and\r\n    Bloaters—A Struggle for Life—Encroachments of the Sea—A Dangerous\r\n        Coast—Flamborough Head—Perils of the Yorkshire Fisherman’s\r\n     Life—“The sea gat him!”—Filey and its Quiet Attractions—Natural\r\n    Breakwater—A Sad Tale of the Sea—Scarborough; Ancient Records—The\r\n    Terrible and the Gay—The _Coupland_ Helpless—Lifeboat out—Her men\r\n        thrown out—Boat crushed against Sea Wall—Two Killed—Futile\r\n         Attempts at Rescue—A Lady’s Description of a Scarborough\r\n             Gale—Whitby—Robin Hood’s Bay—An Undermined Town.\r\n\r\n\r\nProceeding now to the east coast of our island, we come to a series of\r\nplaces interesting to the men of the sea, and some of them renowned as\r\nwatering‐places. Leaving the mouth of the Thames, we soon arrive at\r\nHarwich, which is acquiring considerable importance in view of the\r\nContinental routes with which it is connected. It is situated on high land\r\nat the mouth of the Stour, and near the confluence of the latter with the\r\nOrwell, immediately opposite the well‐known Landguard Fort. The shore is\r\nbold, and the views of the German Ocean, with its ever‐shifting fleets of\r\nnative and foreign vessels, are grand and extensive. It has a breakwater,\r\ndockyard, and magnificent harbour, in which, it is said, more than 100\r\nvessels of the Royal Navy and between 300 and 400 colliers have ridden at\r\none time. There are steamers constantly plying to Ipswich, about twelve\r\nmiles up the Orwell—a river famous for the beautiful scenery of its banks.\r\nIpswich itself, celebrated as the birthplace of Cardinal Wolsey, is the\r\nlargest market town and port of Suffolk, and possesses respectable‐sized\r\ndocks and ship‐yards, and any quantity of interesting buildings of the\r\nmediæval period.\r\n\r\n                         [Illustration: HARWICH.]\r\n\r\nThorpeness, a dreary little place near Aldborough, on our way up the\r\ncoast, would not attract the tourist, but it was long the residence of one\r\nof Suffolk’s heroes. Joseph Chard commenced life as a carpenter, but was\r\nsoon found at Thorpeness, where he lived in a little cottage built by\r\nhimself, and owned an old boat, which cost him originally fifty shillings,\r\nin which he followed the calling of bumboatman, or purveyor of provisions\r\nand odds and ends to passing ships, from which he frequently conveyed\r\nmessages to shore. Gradually he saved money, and, uniting his old and new\r\ntrades, built a fine boat, which cost him twenty‐five pounds. In three or\r\nfour years more he was rich enough to purchase a fast‐sailing yawl, which\r\na gang of smugglers were obliged to relinquish about that time, and with\r\nwhich Chard won the prize at the next Aldborough Regatta from a host of\r\nborn watermen. Not content with these successes, he bought and studied a\r\ncoasting‐book and chart, and soon emerged a full‐fledged pilot for one of\r\nthe most dangerous localities, the Sands of the Swin—a study almost as\r\ndifficult as biquadratic equations. He assisted at various times in saving\r\n109 lives, no less than eighty of which were rescued in his own boat,\r\nappropriately named the _Thorpeness Stormy Petrel_.\r\n\r\nFarther north, and standing upon the most easterly point in all England,\r\nthe important seaport of Lowestoft is situated. The town is placed on a\r\nlofty eminence, from which fine sea‐views are obtained, and the side of\r\nthe cliff descends gradually in hanging gardens or terraces covered with\r\ntrees and shrubs, below which is a long line of buildings appropriated to\r\nthe curing of fish. It has two harbours, with piers. The herring (more\r\nespecially) and the mackerel fisheries employ from 1,500 to 2,000 men and\r\nboys, while the industries connected with the sea commence at twine and\r\nrope making and end in ship‐building. There is a chapel for British and\r\nforeign sailors, six almshouses for poor master fishermen, and two\r\nlifeboats.\r\n\r\nYarmouth next demands our attention. It derives its name from its\r\nsituation at the mouth of the river Yare, and it is, as all know, both a\r\nflourishing fishing‐town and a watering‐place. Its antiquity is great;\r\nthere are records of it anterior to Roman times. In the eleventh century,\r\nat the time of the Conquest, it was known as _Moche Gærnemouth_, or Great\r\nYarmouth. In 1004, Sweyn, king of Denmark, arrived before it with a\r\npowerful fleet, and plundered and burnt the town. It soon rose again. In\r\n1132, artisans, implements, and looms were brought over from the\r\nContinent, and spinning was commenced at Worstead, a small town which gave\r\nto the yarn the name it still bears. The old town of Yarmouth was formerly\r\ndefended by walls of which the ruins still remain.\r\n\r\n                        [Illustration: YARMOUTH.]\r\n\r\nAmong the features of Yarmouth are the great broad quays, extending about\r\na mile‐and‐a‐quarter, the principal streets running parallel with them.\r\nThere are several substantial bridges across the Yare and Bure rivers, one\r\nover the latter having been erected on the spot where nearly eighty people\r\nwere suddenly precipitated into the water by the fall of the old bridge\r\nsome thirty‐eight years ago. There are several small docks and shipyards.\r\nYarmouth Roads afford safe anchorage, and are constantly resorted to by\r\nvessels in distress, the captains of which do not dare to brave the\r\nelements outside. Forty thousand sail, exclusive of fishing boats,\r\nannually pass this part of the coast. The Roads are formed by several very\r\ndangerous sands, which, in foggy weather, or when heavy gales sweep the\r\ncoasts, occasion many fearful shipwrecks. More than 500 vessels have been\r\nstranded, wrecked, or utterly lost off this coast in the short period of\r\nthree years; as a necessary consequence, the loss of life is also\r\nconsiderable, and the number of shipwrecked mariners who are landed at\r\nYarmouth year after year is very large. The Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society\r\nhas an important branch there. There is a fine Sailors’ Home, which has\r\nlodged 600 to 700 poor seamen in a single year. It was established to\r\nprovide a home for the mariners of all nations, when wrecked, detained by\r\nstress of weather, or paid off, in the latter cases giving them board and\r\nmedical attendance, if required, at the lowest possible charge. It\r\npossesses a museum, library, and reading‐room, and a collection of charts\r\nand nautical instruments. The two lifeboats of Yarmouth have been the\r\nmeans of saving several thousand lives. There is also a little church and\r\nmission for fishermen and sailors near the beach, and a mariners’ chapel.\r\n\r\nThe mackerel fisheries of Yarmouth alone employ one thousand men, but the\r\nherring fishery is the most important source of revenue to the town, the\r\nproduce exceeding one hundred thousand barrels per annum, or one‐fifth of\r\nthe entire yield of the kingdom. A large number of persons of both sexes\r\nare employed on shore in drying and curing the fish. The Yarmouth boats\r\nwith two masts (three during the mackerel season) are manned by twelve or\r\nthirteen hands. They have the letters Y. H. and a number painted on the\r\nbows. They are now of about sixty‐five tons builders’ measurement, many of\r\ngraceful forms, and are fast sailers. A single boat will often take a\r\nhundred and twenty or thirty thousand fish in one night.\r\n\r\nIn salting herrings the fish are simply gutted and placed in the barrels\r\nin alternate layers with salt. Having been allowed to remain in that\r\ncondition for some few days the barrel is found to contain a quantity of\r\nfloating liquid, which is poured off; more herrings and layers of salt are\r\nadded. The branding consists of affixing the month and day on which they\r\nwere caught and cured, the name and address of the curer, and the presence\r\nor absence of the gills and alimentary canal. “Red” herrings are made so\r\nby first being placed in salt for three or four days, then being hung on\r\nspits which hold about twenty fish apiece. These spits are plunged several\r\ntimes in cold water, and after being sufficiently washed, are then removed\r\nto the open air and dried. Next they are suspended from the roof of the\r\nsmoking‐house, which has wood fires on the floor. Those for English use\r\nare smoked for ten days or so, but those for exportation often remain as\r\nlong as three weeks before being packed. As has been mentioned elsewhere,\r\nthey are used by the negroes of the West Indies as a medicinal corrective\r\nto the bad effects of a constant vegetable and fruit diet. Bloaters are\r\ncured more speedily. They are placed for a few hours only in a strong\r\nbrine, are then spitted and well washed in cold water, and are smoked very\r\nslightly for about eight hours only, when they are ready for packing.\r\n\r\nAnd now for an incident which occurred some years since, and which was\r\nindeed a “struggle for life,” although eventually the sufferer was landed\r\nat Yarmouth. It is a sad truism that danger is never so near to us as when\r\nwe have least apparent cause to fear its presence, and the narrow escape\r\nof a seaman, named Charles Hayman, from a melancholy death, with his\r\nvessel in sight of his native soil, is only another of the many\r\nexemplifications of this stern truth. He belonged to the schooner\r\n_Osprey_, of London, and had just made a successful passage from Lagos, on\r\nthe West Coast of Africa, with a cargo of palm oil. The _Osprey_ was\r\nbrought up and anchored off the North Foreland, when a tremendous sea rose\r\nand tore her from her anchors, driving her helpless and unmanageable into\r\nthe North Sea.\r\n\r\nThose on board at once made signals of distress, which were seen by the\r\ngallant little smack, _Fear Not_, truly a most appropriate name, and her\r\nsturdy crew at once went to the assistance of the disabled schooner. The\r\nmaster of the smack offered to take the crew of the _Osprey_ on board, and\r\nthe mate of the _Osprey_, believing her past all power of saving, gladly\r\naccepted the generous offer. The hurricane was still raging furiously, and\r\nit was with the greatest difficulty that a boat could be lowered from the\r\n_Osprey_, but pluck and perseverance succeeded at last, and the valuables\r\nand ship’s papers were, without delay, stowed away in the boat. The mate\r\nand Charles Hayman were the first to embark in the tiny craft, which was\r\nattached to the schooner by a rope, and the remainder of the crew were\r\nabout to follow them, when a heavier sea than they had had as yet to\r\ncontend against snapped the line and cast the boat adrift.\r\n\r\nThe waves washed over and into the boat, threatening to swamp it at any\r\nmoment. Hayman and the mate failed completely to bale the water out, in\r\nspite of their incessant endeavours to do so, and Hayman, foreseeing the\r\ninevitable, stripped himself to the skin, and waited for the moment to\r\ncome when the boat would capsize. He did not have to wait long in his\r\nnudity and the bitter cold; the boat spun over, and carried both men under\r\nwater; however, they soon rose to the surface, succeeded in reaching the\r\nboat, which was floating bottom upwards, and clung to it with the\r\ndespairing energy of drowning men. Heavy seas broke over them so\r\npersistently that scarcely a minute was allowed them for respiration, and\r\nthe mate, a weakly man, with a low harrowing cry sank for the last time\r\nand for ever. Hayman battled on with the courage of a tiger. The smack\r\nbore down to him in the teeth of the gale. He was saved and succoured when\r\ndeath seemed about to seize him, and he was supplied with raiment and\r\nstimulants by his noble rescuers, and eventually landed at Yarmouth.\r\n\r\nThe sea has made, and still makes, many encroachments on the Norfolk\r\ncoasts. Thus at the not inconsiderable fishing station of Sherringham\r\nseveral yards of cliff have been undermined and washed away in a few\r\nyears’ time; and in 1810 a large inn, placed too near the sea, was thrown\r\nin a heap of ruins on the beach. The coast onward to Cromer, a now\r\nfashionable watering‐place, protected by a breakwater and sea‐wall, is\r\nextremely dangerous, and between it and Yarmouth there are five lights.\r\n\r\nBut we now approach a still more dangerous part of the coast—the eastern\r\nshores of Yorkshire. Flamborough Head first demands our attention.\r\n\r\nThe Head is the termination of the chalky Yorkshire Wolds, and it is\r\nsurrounded by islands of chalk, showing plainly that the sea has cut them\r\noff from their former connection with the land. The cliffs around\r\nFlamborough Head are riddled and tunnelled by the sea waves, and there are\r\nmany arches and caverns. The “Matron of Flamborough” is a fine pyramidal\r\n“needle,” standing boldly out of the water. Under the lighthouse are some\r\nremarkable broken cliffs, and then two great pillars of chalk called the\r\n“King and Queen” arrest attention. One of the largest and most rugged\r\ncaverns is called “Robin Lyth’s Hole,” and it can be easily explored from\r\nthe eastern side. The Head is, therefore, specially interesting to the\r\nartist, and, for other reasons, it is equally so to the naturalist. Crowds\r\nof sea birds startle the visitor, who is doubtless regarded as an\r\nintruder, as they flock out from all the crevices of the cliffs filled\r\nwith their eggs, and cover both land and sea in their circling flight. The\r\nsomewhat giddy feat of descending the face of the cliff with the aid of\r\nropes, for the sake of the eggs, is one by which the Flamborough men gain\r\ntheir living in the summer. “A more familiar hazard is run by the bold\r\nfishers of this coast, who, in their little cobles, set forth from the\r\nnorth or the south landing to visit, perhaps, the Dogger Bank, possibly to\r\nreturn no more. ‘The sea gat him,’ is too often the reply to your inquiry\r\nfor some honest fisherman who may have been your boatman round the\r\npromontory, or your guide through the windings of the caves.”(61) Many a\r\nfisherman’s widow or mother thinks sadly there of the husband or son who\r\nwill no more return.\r\n\r\n  “Down on the sands, where the red light pales,\r\n  I sit and watch for the fisher’s sails;\r\n  And my heart throbs still with the old, old pain,\r\n  For the boat that will never come back again:\r\n  But a new world waits for my love and me,\r\n  A world of peace, where is no more sea.\r\n\r\n  “For God is good, and the gift He gave\r\n  Is held a while by the silver wave.\r\n  Not lost, but hidden; I may not weep,\r\n  While he is at rest in the silent deep,\r\n  And the voice of an angel speaks to me\r\n  Of the fair new home, where is no more sea.”(62)\r\n\r\nFiley, a quiet watering‐place, is sheltered by the above‐named headland,\r\nand its pretty terraces, squares, shrubs, trees, and flowers, its sands\r\nwhere a band plays daily during the season, afford a strong contrast to\r\nthe ofttimes turbulent ocean without. The title of the place is derived\r\nfrom the ancient name, “The File,” given to a rocky tongue of land which\r\nshoots out into the sea, and serves in every respect as a breakwater to\r\nthe place. Outside, in heavy seas, great pieces of rock may be seen\r\nrolling and tumbling about, swayed at the will of the waves. This is\r\ncalled Filey “Brig” (bridge), and the promontory is said to have a great\r\nresemblance to the mole at Tangiers. Its extremity can be reached at low\r\nwater, and from thence most lovely views of Scarborough cliffs and its\r\ncastle and Flamborough Head are obtained. At high water the Brig is\r\noverflowed, and the waves often cause a white spray against its rocks,\r\nwhich throw it high in the air. The effect from the esplanade is, for want\r\nof a better simile, very much like a concentration of white plumes.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday afternoon, but one on which no Sabbath bell could be heard at\r\nsea, nor on the usual quiet shores of Filey, a sad event occurred. It was\r\nseven in the evening; the wind had suddenly chopped round from south to\r\nnorth, and now there fell, with the noise of an angry sea rushing over a\r\nsandy desert, a terrific shower of hailstones, and tempestuous weather\r\ncontinued through the night. At daybreak the sea ran mountains high, and\r\nthe storm continued with unabated fury. The wind blew a hurricane; the\r\nsleet came down as dense as a London fog, and obscured the sea from the\r\neyes of the anxious inhabitants of Filey, and Filey from the eager eyes\r\nand listening ears of the tempest‐tossed sailor. At nine o’clock the sky\r\ncleared, and the people of Filey beheld a stout brig, in company with\r\nthree or four more vessels, labouring on in the heavy sea under close‐\r\nreefed topsails, and distant scarcely three miles.\r\n\r\nShe showed signs as if she had been in collision with some other vessel,\r\nor was terribly battered and storm‐riven. After getting about two miles\r\nsouth of the buoy, she was seen to heel over on to her beam ends, stagger,\r\nstruggle to right herself, and, as if aware of the entire fruitlessness of\r\nthe attempt, and giving up in despair, to go down with an awful\r\nsuddenness, taking all hands with her—her name unknown, her history\r\nunrecorded. The only epitaph in memory of the brave fellows who had found\r\nher both their coffin and their sepulchre was that stamped indelibly upon\r\nthe hearts of the loved ones they had left behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf Scarborough there are most ancient records. Its name is Saxon—from\r\nScar, a rock, and Burg, a fortified place. A Northern historian records an\r\ninvasion by the Danes in the ninth and tenth centuries in the following\r\nmanner:—“Towards the end of the reign of Adalbricht, King of\r\nNorthumberland, an army of Danes under Knut and Harold, sons of Gorin,\r\ninvading England, subdued a great part of this province; upon which\r\nAdalbricht, meeting the enemy, and fighting a battle at Clifland or\r\nCleveland, in the north, routed the Danes with great slaughter. But soon\r\nafter this the Danes, leading their forces to Scardaborga, fought and\r\nobtained the victory; then marching to York, they subdued the inhabitants,\r\nand passed some time in peace.” The venerable castle dates from the reign\r\nof King Stephen.\r\n\r\n                       [Illustration: SCARBOROUGH.]\r\n\r\nThe harbour of Scarborough is the only place of refuge on a dangerous\r\ncoast reaching from the Humber to Tynemouth Haven. It possesses lifeboats,\r\nmortar apparatus for aiding ships, a Seamen’s Hospital, Trinity House, and\r\nMariners’ Asylum. The place itself has become a most fashionable watering‐\r\nplace. But sometimes here, as at many other seaside resorts, the terrible\r\nmingles with the gay. Such was particularly the case in November, 1861,\r\nwhen events occurred which threw a general gloom over both the inhabitants\r\nand visitors.\r\n\r\nA schooner, the _Coupland_, attempted the harbour during a fearful gale,\r\nbut could not succeed in entering. She drifted rapidly amid foaming\r\nbillows that chased each other like huge mad cataracts, until she struck\r\nimmediately opposite the Spa promenade. In the meantime the lifeboat was\r\nmanned, and sent out to the relief of the vessel, now in most imminent\r\ndanger. The sea broke upon the sea‐wall with such terrific violence that\r\nthe massive stones on the parapet were dislodged. The rebound of the waves\r\ncaused such a sea as no small craft but the lifeboat could have borne.\r\nArrived at this point, she was watched, and her crew spoken to by the\r\npeople on the Spa. The crew of the lifeboat seemed terror‐stricken at\r\ntheir awful position. Suddenly a fearful lurch of the boat pitched out a\r\nveteran boatman, the leading man in her, and one of great experience and\r\ngood judgment. He was quickly washed up to the Spa wall, and was saved by\r\na life‐buoy. Another of the crew was ejected a few minutes after, and was\r\nsaved by the same means, after a fearful struggle. The oars were now\r\ndashed out of the hands of the lifeboatmen, and they were at once rendered\r\npowerless. The boat was washed heavily up against the wall, and nothing\r\nbut her great strength and excellent qualities preserved her from being at\r\nonce dashed to pieces. Ropes were thrown from the boat to the promenade,\r\nand she was drawn through the surf to a landing‐place at the southern end\r\nof the wall. Here a fatal occurrence took place. Having touched the\r\nground, the men jumped out before the water had receded, and, seeing the\r\ndanger they were in, a rush down the incline was made to assist them. In\r\nthe momentary confusion that ensued another run of the sea came, and\r\nnearly all the party were thrown from their feet, and were now scrambling\r\nto save their lives. Many succeeded in getting up, but another wave washed\r\noff those who were yet below. Two or three times they were carried out and\r\nback again. Among these were Lord Charles Beauclerk, two of the boat’s\r\ncrew, and five or six others. A large wave was seen to lift the lifeboat\r\nwith fearful force against the wall; and as the boat sank down again, it\r\nwas found that Brewster, one of the crew, had been literally crushed to\r\ndeath between it and the stone sea‐wall. Lord Charles Beauclerk\r\nexperienced the same horrible fate, but was not immediately killed; he was\r\nwashed to the foot of the cliff, when two gentlemen rushed to his\r\nassistance. A rope had been previously thrown to him, but he was powerless\r\nto grasp it. The gentlemen just named succeeded in fastening a rope round\r\nhim, and drew him up the incline, the life just ebbing out of him. He was\r\nconveyed to the Music Hall adjoining (sad irony of fate!), where a\r\nphysician pronounced him dead. Two or three others were seen under the\r\nboat, when the waves threw her up almost in the air. One of them was the\r\nson of a Scarborough banker. All these men perished.\r\n\r\nAttention was now given to the shipwrecked crew, who had been witnesses of\r\nall these horrors, and they were eventually all hauled off safely by the\r\nrocket apparatus. In the same gale fourteen poor fishermen of Scarborough\r\nlost their lives. Twenty were lost at Yarmouth, and there were wrecks\r\nstrewed all over the east coast.\r\n\r\nAnd now for a true story with a happier ending, very graphically told by a\r\nlady visitor to Scarborough.(63) It occurred in the mid‐winter of 1872. “I\r\ncan’t write decently,” wrote she; “my hands are still trembling from the\r\nexcitement of the morning, such a tremendous storm we have had, and a\r\nvessel lost in front of our windows again. The sea was one heaving,\r\nsurging mass of foam, and the wind blowing hard from the NE. right upon\r\nthis coast. Our sailor‐landlord came in from a look‐out seaward with the\r\nreport, ‘There’s a fine brig out to the north’ard, but there’s an awful\r\nheavy sea on; I’m afraid there’s no chance for her, the wind is driving\r\nher dead on shore, and I’m afraid she’ll be on the rocks before long.\r\nShe’s a Spaniard, I think, by the looks on her. God help ’em!’ and he took\r\nhis glass and went out, the big tears standing in his eyes, great sturdy\r\nfellow as he is.\r\n\r\n“Of course our hearts were in our mouths in a moment, and with straining\r\neyes we watched and watched. On she came; how one longed for some unseen\r\nhand to drive her back from what seemed friendly houses, and people, and\r\nland, and yet was so fatal! The snow, and hail, and rain made the air\r\nthick every now and then, and when it cleared there was the vessel being\r\ndriven headlong before the wind. Would she get round the Castle rocks?\r\nThat was awful excitement; if she struck there, there was no hope for the\r\ncrew. An hour nearly the suspense lasted; yes, she is past! a slight lull\r\nin the fierce storm, and in that lull a fishing‐smack, for which there\r\nseemed no chance, had weathered it all, got round the lighthouse pier, and\r\nwas entering the harbour, a thing that, by the side of the brig, seemed a\r\nmere child’s toy on those big waves, and had been lost to sight again and\r\nagain. The pier was one black mass of people, and on the sands thousands\r\nhad collected, all eyes on the brig.\r\n\r\n“Now off goes the lifeboat—there is still a chance for the brig. It’s a\r\nbeautiful new boat, that was recently launched, and already she has saved\r\nmore lives (the sailors tell us) than the old one did all the time she was\r\nhere. Her crew have confidence in her, and ‘you know, miss, if her crew\r\nhaven’t confidence in her, it’s all no go; they’d better by half go off in\r\na coble, they’d liever too,’ said an old sailor to me. I felt as if every\r\none I loved in the world were in that vessel, thus tossing and struggling\r\nwith the winds and waves, in uncertainty as to her fate. The lifeboat is\r\noff now, though, to the pier‐head, and the rocket apparatus is fixed at a\r\npart where they think she’s coming on shore. She hasn’t enough sail on,\r\nthe sailors say. Her master seems to find this out, for up go two\r\ntopsails. She veers; now is her chance; if her master knows the harbour\r\nwell, he may yet get her in. He doesn’t, evidently; he has gone a little\r\ntoo far to the south’ard, and can’t get back! One frightful gust, one\r\nawful sea, and her chance is over, and she is driving right on to the\r\nworst rocks of all, where, if she strikes, the men must perish—no lifeboat\r\nand no rocket apparatus can reach her. The lifeboat is pulling\r\ntremendously towards her now, and the sea is fearful; again she veers\r\nslightly—the moments seem hours. How those men pull! they are close to\r\nher, when one awful sea catches them, and the lifeboat is swamped. It\r\nseemed as if I felt the waves dashing over me. I gave an awful scream, and\r\nhardly dared look again; and yet I couldn’t keep my eyes away. She was all\r\nright, and eagerly I counted her men, we could see so plainly from our\r\nwindows. They were all right, and now she is alongside the brig, though\r\nonce or twice dashed away again. Then comes the taking of the men off.\r\nThis was almost the worst moment of all, to see them one by one dropped\r\ninto the lifeboat. One man is going nearly in; the lifeboat is dashed\r\nright away, and there he hangs. The sea dashes against him, injures his\r\nleg, but they get him back into the brig, and then into the lifeboat when\r\nshe can get close again, and now all are in but the captain. He hesitates;\r\nalmost it seems as if he would rather go down with his ship; but he passes\r\nsome papers, or paper like books, into the lifeboat, and then he follows,\r\nand the men pull back. The crew of the brig are faint and exhausted; they\r\nhave had three awful days of it, but the lifeboat lands them all safely at\r\nlength at the pier. I felt as if I had been up for nights, the excitement\r\nhad been so great. If she hadn’t been a new ship and a good one, she would\r\nhave been all to pieces long ago, the sailors say; but she’s lying almost\r\non her beam ends and her deck to windward, with every sea dashing against\r\nher, now the tide is ebbing.”\r\n\r\nWhitby is the last point to be treated here in connection with the\r\ndangerous east coast. It is an ancient town, dating long before the\r\neleventh century, at which latter period it had become a noted fishing‐\r\nplace. At the present time it possesses perhaps 500 vessels, large and\r\nsmall, exclusive of fishing boats. There are a great number of seamen\r\nbelonging to the place who are engaged in ships on the coast, Baltic, and\r\nIndian trade, seldom returning home, but for a few weeks in winter. That\r\nthe men must be generally provident is witnessed by the fact that there\r\nare 800 subscribers to the Mariners’ National Mutual Pension and Widows’\r\nFund, a benefit society under the auspices and management of the\r\nShipwrecked Mariners’ Society.\r\n\r\nStanding on the cliff above Whitby, near the ruins of the old abbey, there\r\nis a most delightful view seawards. The town is below, mapped out in all\r\nits varieties of streets, squares, and quays; its terraces mounting one\r\nabove another; its piers projecting into the sea; its lighthouses, docks,\r\nand shipyards alive with busy artisans; and a capacious harbour, divided\r\nby a bridge across the Esk, the outer part of which has accommodation for\r\n300 sail of ships, while above there is also a large basin. “All this and\r\nmuch more the eye takes in from this elevated stand‐point, which, in fine\r\nweather, and at high tide, is most imposing. The harbour, filled to the\r\nbrim with the blue element, glitters like a polished mirror beneath the\r\nrays of the sun. The stately vessel, spreading her snowy canvas to the\r\nbreeze, is seen passing from point to point along its winding shores. The\r\nmaze‐like coursing of the little yacht, with its slender masts and tiny\r\nsails, skimming the surface of the water like a swallow on the wing, lends\r\nanimation to the scene. The cry of the sea‐bird as it wheels in graceful\r\ncurves, or checks its flight to pounce upon its prey in the bright flood\r\nbeneath, arrests the ear; whilst the loud ‘hurrah’ with which the brawny\r\nshipwright greets the majestic vessel as she glides along the well‐greased\r\n‘ways,’ and cleaves a passage for herself into the flood which is to be\r\nher future home, re‐echoes from the cliffs and shore.”\r\n\r\nSouthward of Whitby lies the romantic Bay of Robin Hood, _alias_ Robert\r\nEarl of Huntingdon, who lived in Richard I.’s reign. Robin, it is said,\r\nwhen about to select a site for a marine residence, resolved to take up\r\nhis abode on the first spot where the next arrow from his bow should\r\nalight, and this being the place, his name has ever since been attached to\r\nit. The little town there is one of the most irregular and comical‐looking\r\nplaces in the world, from the ravages of the sea in undermining the\r\ncliffs. Built on the ledges of these cliffs, at all heights where foothold\r\ncould be obtained, and perched on dizzy crags that overhang the sea, or\r\nhid in nooks approached by perilous paths, or tottering on the brink of\r\ncliffs that vibrate as the breakers roll with smothered sobs into the\r\ncaves that perforate their base, there stand isolated houses, terraces and\r\nstreets, whole sides of which have erewhile slipped into the sea below.\r\nThe town itself is in a hole which cannot be seen till close upon it,\r\nbeing so entirely locked in by peaks and promontories.\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: EARLY SWIMMING.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n            THE ART OF SWIMMING—FEATS IN NATATION—LIFE SAVERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Lord Byron and the Hellespont—The Art of Swimming a Necessary\r\n        Accomplishment—The Numbers Lost from Drowning—A Lamentable\r\n        Accident—Captain Webb’s Advice to Beginners—Bold and Timid\r\n    Lads—Best Places to Learn in—Necessity of Commencing Properly—The\r\n              Secret of a Good Stroke—Useful and Ornamental\r\n    Natation—Diving—Advice—Possibilities of Serious Injury—Inventions\r\n        for Aiding Swimming and Floating—The Boyton Dress—Matthew\r\n          Webb—Brave Attempt to Save a Comrade—The Great Channel\r\n     Swim—Twenty‐Two Hours in the Sea—Stung by a Jelly‐Fish—Red Light\r\n    on the Waters—Cape Grisnez at Hand—Exhaustion of the Swimmer—Fears\r\n    of Collapse—Triumphant Landing on Calais Sands—Webb’s Feelings—An\r\n     Ingenious Sailor Saved by Wine‐bottles—Life Savers—Thomas Fowell\r\n       Buxton—Ellerthorpe—Lambert—The “Hero of the Clyde”—His Brave\r\n           Deeds—Funny Instances—The Crowning Feat—Blinded and\r\n                     Neglected—Appreciation at Last.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “But since he(64) crossed the rapid tide,\r\n    According to the doubtful story,\r\n  To woo ...\r\n    And swam for love, as I for glory;\r\n\r\n  “’Twere hard to say who fared the best:\r\n    Sad mortals! thus the gods still plague you!\r\n  He lost his labour, I my jest:\r\n    For he was drowned, and I’ve the ague.”\r\n\r\nSo sang Lord Byron after his memorable swim across the Hellespont with\r\nLieutenant Ekenhead, of H.M.S. _Salsette_. The distance from Abydos to\r\nSestos is about a mile, but the distance swum was four; the current there\r\nruns so strongly that no boat can cross direct. “It may,” says Byron, “in\r\nsome measure be estimated from the circumstance of the whole distance\r\nbeing accomplished by one of the parties in an hour and five, and by the\r\nother in an hour and ten minutes. The water was extremely cold from the\r\nmelting of the mountain snows. About three weeks before, in April, we had\r\nmade an attempt; but having ridden all the way from the Troad the same\r\nmorning, and the water being of an icy chillness, we found it necessary to\r\npostpone the completion till the frigate anchored below the castles, when\r\nwe swam the straits as just stated, entering a considerable way above the\r\nEuropean, and landing below the Asiatic fort. Chevalier says that a young\r\nJew swam the same distance for his mistress, and Oliver mentions it having\r\nbeen done by a Neapolitan; but our consul, Tarragona, remembered neither\r\nof these circumstances, and tried to dissuade us from the attempt. A\r\nnumber of the _Salsette’s_ crew were known to have accomplished a greater\r\ndistance, and the only thing that surprised me was that, as doubts had\r\nbeen entertained of the truth of Leander’s story, no traveller had ever\r\nendeavoured to ascertain its practicability.” Byron’s allusion to the ague\r\ncaught was simply put in for effect.(65)\r\n\r\nIn presenting this chapter(66) on swimming and feats of natation, the\r\nwriter is earnest in the hope that it may lead to a more general knowledge\r\nand practice of the art. Were it merely the healthy, manly exercise it is,\r\nit would be worthy of all encouragement; but there is another and a more\r\nimportant side to the question. Annually thousands of valuable lives are\r\nlost which might be easily saved, not by others, but by their own\r\nknowledge. Every father of a family should make his children learn at the\r\nearliest opportunity, and, except in the case of very delicate children,\r\nthey will inevitably take kindly to the exercise. Young men should count\r\nit as one of their most pleasant and useful recreations. Cricket, rowing,\r\nriding (if even on a bicycle) are to‐day among the accomplishments of\r\nalmost all respectable youths; let all of them add swimming to the list.\r\nThe first three are health‐giving and invigorating pursuits; the art of\r\nnatation is all this, and very much more besides. Some one or more in\r\nevery large family to‐day travel or voyage frequently; usually one, two,\r\nor more are settled in the colonies or foreign countries, to reach or\r\nreturn from which the wide ocean must be crossed. And in spite of steam\r\nand all modern facilities, wrecks are not unknown to‐day. The writer\r\nstrongly advocates the establishment of Government schools of swimming.\r\n\r\nEvery year the papers record numerous cases of drowning, but the\r\n_un_‐recorded cases are far more numerous. Not long since the National\r\nLifeboat Institution published an instructive chart of the numbers lost in\r\none year in _inland_ waters, rivers, lakes, and ponds. It amounted to\r\nscarcely less than two thousand persons, a large proportion being young\r\npeople, all of whom ought to have been able to swim. The full annual\r\nrecord of those lost at sea and on the coasts would be something\r\nappalling.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that swimming is much easier learned in youth than in\r\nmiddle age, and the younger a lad is the easier it is for him to learn. Of\r\nall places for this purpose none will be found better than a bath. It will\r\nalways be found that where the water is warm it is much easier to remain\r\nin a long period than where the water is cold. It is for this reason that\r\nall our fast swimmers come from inland towns. Boys at the sea have\r\nprobably but a few weeks, or at the outside but a few months, in the\r\ncourse of the year in which they find it practicable to go into the water.\r\nRough days, cold weather, too often deter lads from bathing, though cases\r\nare indeed occasionally found in which men will bathe in the sea all the\r\nyear round, not only in midsummer, but in mid‐winter as well.\r\n\r\nIn commencing to teach a person to swim, the first point is entering the\r\nwater, and here _ce n’est que le premier pas qui coûte_. Where the learner\r\nis very young the greatest difficulty often is to induce him to enter the\r\nwater at all. Still, most healthy boys are courageous enough in this\r\nregard.\r\n\r\n“Having once persuaded a pupil to walk about within his depth, the next\r\ngreat point is to prove to him how great is the buoyancy of the water. I\r\nthink it will be found that, in almost all works written on the subject of\r\nswimming, the same plan is recommended, viz., to place some object at the\r\nbottom of the bath (such as a large stone or piece of white chalk), and\r\nthen to tell the pupil to pick it up with his hand. He will now experience\r\nthe difficult, not of keeping himself up, but of getting down. The\r\nbuoyancy of the water is so great that, supposing him to be about chest‐\r\ndeep, probably he will be unable to pick up the stone at all. He will now\r\nfind from this how very little is necessary to keep a man afloat.”\r\n\r\nAnother good plan is to let some person go into the water with the\r\nbeginner, and float on his back, resting on the learner’s hand. Then tell\r\nhim to take his hand away for a second or two at a time, and, so to speak,\r\nbalance the body on his hand. He will find the pressure of the body barely\r\nthat of a few ounces. In fact, the human body is so nearly the same weight\r\nas an equal bulk of water that the movement of the arms and legs in\r\nswimming is not necessary so much to keep the body afloat as to keep it\r\nafloat in the right position. Many a drowning man has come repeatedly to\r\nthe surface, but often, unfortunately, the mouth or nose, through which he\r\ncould breathe, has not been the portion that reached the surface. Another\r\nmethod by which you can give a pupil confidence is to go into the water\r\nyourself, and prove to him by ocular demonstration how very slight a\r\nmovement of the limbs is necessary to keep the body afloat and the mouth\r\nabove water. All good swimmers know how very little movement of the hands\r\nor feet will be sufficient for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIn commencing to learn, all boys should first learn to swim well on their\r\nchests. Since the introduction of the side stroke it will be often found\r\nthat lads who have barely learned to swim properly at all try to imitate\r\nthe first‐class professionals, and in so doing succeed simply in making\r\nthemselves ridiculous.\r\n\r\n“The great secret of a good stroke,” says Webb, “is to kick out the legs\r\nwide; and here let me observe that it is a popular fallacy to imagine that\r\nthe speed of the swimmer in any way depends upon the resistance of the\r\nwater against the soles of the feet. I have often heard it observed—‘Oh!\r\nthat man would make a fine swimmer; he has got such large feet.’ Now, in\r\nthe movement of the legs the flat of the foot never directly meets the\r\nwater, except in the case known as ‘treading water.’ The propelling power\r\nin swimming is caused by the legs being suddenly brought from a position\r\nin which they are placed wide apart into one in which they are close\r\ntogether, like the blades of a pair of scissors. In fact, the mechanical\r\npower here brought into play is that of the wedge. For instance, suppose a\r\nwedge of ice were suddenly pinched hard between the thumb and finger, it\r\nis evident that it would shoot off in the direction opposite to that in\r\nwhich the sharp edge points. Now a wedge of water is forced backwards, and\r\nthe resistance caused propels the body forward in an opposite direction.”\r\nWhen this point is well considered, the importance of drawing the legs\r\nwell up will at once become manifest.\r\n\r\nAgain, too, in dwelling on the stroke (and by “dwelling on the stroke” is\r\nmeant resting for a few seconds in the water while the body moves\r\nforward), care should be taken that the toes are pointed in a direction\r\ncontrary to that in which the swimmer is going. The movement of the arms\r\nis never one in which great difficulty will be found. The two hands should\r\nbe kept perfectly flat, the palms resting on the water; and at the same\r\ntime as the swimmer strikes out his legs each hand should be brought\r\nslowly round, one to the right and the other to the left, care being taken\r\nthat the palm of the hand is horizontal. Were the hands to be placed\r\nsideways, it is at once evident that the water would offer but little\r\nresistance. By keeping the hands in the position named the resistance\r\noffered by the water in case of sinking would be very considerable. Should\r\nthe beginner doubt this, let him enter the water and stoop down, and\r\nkeeping his hand flat, bring it suddenly downwards in the water; the\r\nresistance the water will offer prevents him from doing this with any\r\nspeed at all. On the other hand, should he strike downwards with his hands\r\nsideways, he will find that he can do it as fast almost as he could in the\r\nair. Now, in reaching forward with the hands the swimmer should always\r\nendeavour to reach as far forward as possible. Let him imagine some small\r\nobject is placed in the water just out of reach, and let him struggle to\r\nreach it; the more he reaches forward the faster he will swim. This is a\r\nvery important point.\r\n\r\nEvery boy should in learning to swim be very particular as to the kind of\r\nstroke he acquires with his legs. Bear in mind that if once you get into a\r\nbad style you will experience ten times the difficulty in altering it into\r\na correct one than you would by commencing to learn to swim afresh; for\r\nthis reason every one learning to swim should go and watch carefully some\r\nfirst‐class swimmer, and note how he moves his legs, and then imitate him\r\nas closely as possible.\r\n\r\nDiving from a height requires, as Artemus Ward observed when he took the\r\ncensus, experience, like any other business; and just as that worthy\r\ngentleman got into difficulties with the two first old maids he met, and\r\nwhose mouths he attempted to examine, not believing their answers to be\r\ncorrect with regard to age, so many a boy who has witnessed the apparently\r\neasy feat of taking a header has come to terrible grief by finding himself\r\ncome down flat on the water, which he has shortly afterwards left with the\r\nappearance of having had a particularly strong mustard poultice on his\r\nchest. Now, in diving from a height of, say, six feet, the heels must be\r\nthrown well up, the legs should be kept straight and well together, and\r\nthe two hands brought forward in front of the head, exactly similar to the\r\nposition that a man takes in making his first attempt at swimming on his\r\nchest. The hands act simply as a breakwater, and they should be turned up\r\nthe moment the water is reached, thus preventing the diver going deep, and\r\nalso enabling him to dart forward along the surface the moment he reaches\r\nthe water. A good diver can dive from a height of forty to fifty feet, and\r\nyet never go a yard below the surface.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, when only fourteen years of age, a boy dived from the top\r\ndeck of Her Majesty’s ship _President_, stationed at the West India Docks.\r\nThe height above water was forty‐five feet, and those who witnessed him\r\nstate that they did not think he went more than two feet below the\r\nsurface. Neither man nor boy should attempt to dive from such a height.\r\nWere they to slip or to fall flat, the probability is that they would be\r\nkilled on the spot. But should it at any time be necessary to take a dive\r\nfrom a high place, bear in mind that you must not give the same movement\r\nto your body as if you were going off from the height of a few feet,\r\notherwise you will turn completely over in the air and come down on your\r\nback, which, should the distance be very great, would probably kill you;\r\nand if the distance be moderate, you would certainly have the appearance\r\nof having had a severe whipping. In diving, and in everything else, it is\r\npractice only that will make perfect. Webb dived off the yard‐arm of a\r\nship quite thirty feet above the water; but if by chance any one from such\r\na height comes in the least degree flat, he will hurt himself\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\n                         [Illustration: DIVING.]\r\n\r\nMany stories have been told in this work of native divers, but referring\r\nmerely to their power of remaining under water, and not their diving from\r\na height; and, so far as swimming goes, no black people approach a first‐\r\nclass English swimmer. Three feet of water are sufficient to dive in, but\r\nno man in his senses would ever make a dive from any height unless the\r\nwater was at least five or six feet deep, as if by chance he should come\r\ndown a little straighter than he intended, he would inevitably dash his\r\nbrains out, in addition to breaking both his arms against the bottom of\r\nthe bath or river. Great care, too, should be taken in diving into any\r\nopen piece of water. Webb mentions a case in which a man was seen to\r\nreceive a fearful laceration of his skull from diving on to a broken green\r\nglass bottle which had been thrown in.\r\n\r\nInnumerable are the inventions for assisting the learner of swimming, or\r\nfor aiding those who cannot swim to float. Foremost in the latter category\r\nmust be placed what is known as the Boyton dress, an American invention.\r\nIt is a complete india‐rubber suit, and can be inflated at any point\r\ndesired, the result being that the wearer can lie down, remain in a\r\nperpendicular or slanting direction in the water, his body being kept as\r\nwarm, and if in exertion warmer, than it would be under ordinary\r\ncircumstances. Captain Paul Boyton crossed the Channel in it without\r\ndifficulty, floating, paddling, and even _sailing_ (for a sail is part of\r\nthe gear), meanwhile feeding from the knapsack or receptacle which is a\r\ncomponent part of the dress, smoking, and drinking cherry brandy amid the\r\nboiling waves. This dress would no doubt enable a shipwrecked person to\r\nlive for days, and even weeks, in the water. Its expense is not great, but\r\ntoo much for general adoption. It was while wearing this dress, in\r\ncrossing the Straits of Messina on the 10th of March, 1877, that Captain\r\nBoyton met with the adventure illustrated in our plate. We translate from\r\nan Italian journal the following account of it:—\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CAPTAIN BOYTON ATTACKED BY A DOG‐FISH IN THE STRAITS OF\r\n                                MESSINA.]\r\n\r\n“Disregarding the counsels of those who warned him of the perils of such a\r\nrough sea, and one so infested with dog‐fish, Boyton let himself into the\r\nwater at eight in the morning, followed by a vessel, which more than once\r\nlost sight of him. He rowed in his apparatus with the aid of arms which\r\nappeared as though made of steel, when he suddenly felt himself strongly\r\nknocked against behind. It was a dog‐fish! There was a flash; Boyton\r\nraised himself to the middle, drew the dagger which he always carried at\r\nhis side, and repelled the assailant. Reassured, he then re‐took the oar,\r\ndrank for the third or fourth time some cognac, and about midday, with his\r\neyes inflamed by the heavy strokes of the sea, arrived at the port of\r\nMessina, saluted with enthusiasm by the crowd of people, on shore and in\r\nboats and steamers, who were anxiously awaiting him.”\r\n\r\nApparently one of the simplest devices for those unable to swim is that\r\nknown as the Nautilus Safety Bathing Dress, the invention of Captain\r\nPeacock. It is simply a short shirt, made of the purest Irish flax, which\r\nfits closely round the neck and waist, &c., by means of elastic bands. It\r\nhas an inflating tube and mouthpiece. The principle on which it is founded\r\nis simply this: Irish flax, _when wet_, is nearly air and water proof;\r\ndipping, then, first the shirt in water, air is blown inside by the tube\r\ntill there is sufficient inflation. Should there be any slight leakage,\r\nmore air can at any moment be blown into it by the wearer. These shirts\r\nare, of course, comparatively inexpensive.\r\n\r\nA seaman’s belt, invented by Captain Ward, R.N., and sanctioned by the\r\nNational Life‐Boat Institution, is highly commended by many authorities. A\r\nschoolmaster says that he has been accustomed for many years to take from\r\nthirty to forty boys, of all ages, during the bathing season, into deep\r\nwater, and that not merely is it perfectly safe, and free from some\r\nobjections urged against many swimming‐belts, but that its use enables\r\nyoung people to swim more rapidly.\r\n\r\nCaptain Warren has invented a life‐buoy which is highly commended. It\r\nconsists of a bladder chemically prepared, to which is affixed a patent\r\nvalve, by means of which the former can be easily inflated. A second\r\ninvention of Captain Warren’s consists of 500 life‐buoys, three feet long,\r\nmade of cork or specially prepared wood, and strung on to a series of iron\r\nrods, which are connected with the turret or mast of the ship. These are\r\nall kept together by means of a band, which, when the vessel is sinking,\r\nwould be cut, and the whole of the buoys could be instantly released. This\r\napparatus would cost £250, but of course it could be made on a smaller\r\nscale if required.\r\n\r\nA most ingenious “Life‐Buoy Seat” has been invented by Mr. Richard Rose,\r\nan old traveller and colonist. It is composed of two semi‐conical buckets\r\nof block tin, the smaller end of one screwing into the other, together\r\nforming a buoy resembling an hour‐glass in shape. Placed upright it forms\r\na capital deck camp‐seat, the upper end being of cork, which of course\r\nincreases its buoyancy. In the event of fire on board the two portions can\r\nbe rapidly unscrewed, and each buoy thus representing two buckets, a ship\r\nwith only two or three dozen would have an ample supply in such emergency.\r\nPractically tested in a swimming‐bath, several bathers could not sink one\r\nplaced there for the experiment, and it took a dead weight of nearly a\r\nhundredweight to do so. The buoy being water‐tight could, of course, be\r\nutilised for carrying a supply of water, biscuit, or other food, valuable\r\nship’s papers, and so forth, and without materially impairing its\r\nbuoyancy, while several lashed together would form a raft. Two ropes are\r\nattached to each seat. When one considers the confusion and panic that too\r\noften attend collisions, fires at sea, and shipwrecks generally, this\r\ninvention would prove of incalculable value, as it could be utilised on\r\nthe immediate spur of the moment.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Humane Society promulgates the following golden rules for\r\nbathers (and which apply also in part to swimmers), prepared by competent\r\nauthorities:—1. Avoid bathing within two hours after a meal. 2. Avoid\r\nbathing when exhausted by fatigue. 3. Avoid bathing when the body is\r\ncooling after perspiration. But—4. Bathe when the body is warm, provided\r\nno time be lost in getting into the water. 5. Avoid chilling the body by\r\nsitting naked on the banks or in boats after having been in the water. 6.\r\nAvoid remaining too long in the water—leave the water immediately there is\r\nthe slightest feeling of chillness. 7. Avoid bathing altogether in the\r\nopen air, if, after having been a short time in the water, there is a\r\nsense of chilliness with numbness of the hands and feet. 8. The vigorous\r\nand strong may bathe early in the morning on an empty stomach. 9. The\r\nyoung and those that are weak had better bathe three hours after a\r\nmeal—the best time for such is from two to three hours after breakfast.\r\n10. Those who are subject to attacks of giddiness or faintness, and those\r\nwho suffer from palpitation and other sense of discomfort at the heart,\r\nshould not bathe without first consulting their medical adviser.\r\n\r\nAnd now we must speak of the greatest swimmer of our day—one who has never\r\nbeen excelled. Captain Matthew Webb swam the Channel when he was but\r\ntwenty‐six years of age. The son of a country surgeon, he had early become\r\nfond of the sea, and obtained his first instruction on board the _Conway_\r\ntraining ship at Liverpool.\r\n\r\nThe event in Webb’s life which first brought his name prominently before\r\nthe public in connection with swimming took place on board the Cunard\r\nsteamship _Russia_, then on the homeward voyage from America. One day a\r\ntremendous heavy sea caused the ship to roll in a manner which rendered it\r\nalmost impossible for any one to keep their feet without a life‐line\r\n(_i.e._, a rope stretched along or across the deck from one point to\r\nanother), and all of a sudden a cry arose, “A man overboard!” A poor young\r\nfellow, Michael Hynes by name, who had been ordered aloft in the main\r\nrigging to “clear the sheet,” had missed his hold, and fell backwards into\r\nthe water. Webb saw him fall, and within two or three seconds was after\r\nhim in the sea, but, alas! could see nothing of him, save his cap floating\r\non the waves. On this occasion he was thirty‐seven minutes in the water\r\nbefore be was picked up by the _Russia’s_ lifeboat, the waves being\r\n“mountains high,” and the ship going at fifteen knots. Webb was utterly\r\nunable to save the poor fellow, who was never seen to rise again, but for\r\nhis noble attempt deservedly received the leading medal, the—“Stanhope\r\ngold medal”—of the Royal Humane Society of London, another from the\r\nLiverpool Humane Society, and £100 from the passengers on board the\r\n_Russia_.\r\n\r\nThe first time that Captain Webb took up the idea of swimming the Channel\r\nwas after a “good try”—but failure—made by Johnson, to swim from Dover to\r\nCalais. Webb commenced by an excellent swim from Dover as far as the Varne\r\nBuoy, about mid‐channel. On this occasion he remained four and a half\r\nhours in the water. His first public swim was from Blackwall Pier to\r\nGravesend, a distance of twenty miles—mere child’s play to him. After\r\nconsiderable practice he made a trial trip from Dover to Ramsgate,\r\nremaining in the water nearly nine hours. He now publicly announced his\r\nintention of attempting to swim to Calais, and he received a considerable\r\namount of encouragement as well as well‐meant advice to make the attempt.\r\nA number of extraordinary precautions were recommended to him—one,\r\nhowever, being sensible enough: that being to cover his body with a\r\ncoating of some kind of grease. On the Ramsgate swim he used cod‐liver\r\noil, and, on the first Channel attempt, porpoise oil.\r\n\r\nThe second attempt of Captain Webb to swim across the Channel took place\r\non August 24th, 1875, and was crowned with success, after a display of\r\nunequalled courage and physical endurance. At four minutes to one o’clock\r\non that day he dived from the steps at the head of the Admiralty Pier,\r\nDover, and at forty‐one minutes past ten a.m. next day he touched the\r\nsands of Calais, having remained in the water, without even touching a\r\nboat on his way, no less than twenty‐one and three‐quarter hours.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the journey Captain Webb was particularly\r\nfavoured by the weather. The sea was as calm as a mill‐pond, and there was\r\nnot a breath of wind. The lugger which accompanied him across the Channel\r\nhad to be propelled a considerable distance by oars. The swimmer was\r\naccompanied by two small rowing‐boats in immediate attendance upon\r\nhimself, one containing his cousin, Mr. Ward, who supplied him\r\noccasionally with refreshments, and one of the referees, who had been\r\nappointed at Webb’s own request to see fair play; the other boat was used\r\nfor the purpose of conveying messages to and from the lugger.\r\n\r\nEverything went on favourably till nine p.m., when Captain Webb complained\r\nof being stung by a jelly‐fish, and asked for a little brandy. He had\r\npreviously been supplied with some cod‐liver oil and hot coffee. The\r\nweather still continued perfect, and the intrepid swimmer proceeded at a\r\ngood rate, taking a long, clean breast stroke, which drove him well\r\nthrough the water. Owing to the phosphorescent state of the sea, he was\r\nsometimes almost surrounded with a glow of light. At 10.30 he was visited\r\nby a steam‐tug, which had put off from Dover for the purpose, and which,\r\nstrange to say, left the man who had ploughed through the waves for over\r\nnine hours without even the encouragement of a parting cheer. At 11.45,\r\nhowever, a Dover boat, on its way to Calais, gave cheer after cheer to\r\ngreet him, and one of the small boats burnt a red light, which cast a\r\nruddy glow over the scene, and illuminated the water all around, the face\r\nof Captain Webb being lighted up by it, so that he was distinctly seen by\r\nall on board the Continental mail boat.\r\n\r\nAt two o’clock next morning Cape Grisnez light seemed close at hand, and\r\nCaptain Webb was still bravely struggling on, although at this juncture\r\nthe tide not merely impeded him, but was sweeping him farther and farther\r\nfrom the shore. He, however, showed signs of fatigue, and young Baker, a\r\nwell‐known diver, sat with a life‐line round him by the side of the\r\nreferee, in case of accident, as it was supposed by many that the long\r\nexposure to cold might cause Webb to become suddenly numbed and\r\ninsensible, and so sink without a moment’s warning. But Webb is a man\r\namong ten thousand; the collapse from penetrating cold which the best\r\nswimmers usually experience after long exposure in the water seems unknown\r\nto him. By nine o’clock he was within a mile of the shore, a little to the\r\nwestward of Calais, and at this juncture, young Baker, then only sixteen\r\nyears of age, plunged in and kept the exhausted swimmer company, not,\r\nhowever, trying to aid him in any way except by encouragement.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CAPTAIN MATTHEW WEBB. (_From a Photograph by Albert\r\n                               Fradelle._)]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, two hours previously a strong breeze had risen,\r\nand the sea, which had hitherto been like a sheet of glass, was running\r\nhigh, with crested waves. Webb was evidently fearfully exhausted. The tide\r\nwas running strongly away from the shore, and the swimmer was battling\r\nagainst double odds when he was least fit for it. Still, at 9.45 he had\r\nlessened the distance by one‐half; he was only half a mile from the beach.\r\nWould he ever reach it?\r\n\r\nJust as the now utterly exhausted swimmer was beginning bitterly to think\r\nthat failure even at this point was possible, a steamboat put off from\r\nCalais, and her commander placed her in such a position that she acted as\r\na kind of breakwater, for the sea was running so high that it nearly\r\nswamped the boats accompanying him. One last struggling exertion and he\r\ntouched ground, so weak that he could not stand. A couple of men instantly\r\nwent to his assistance, and he was able to walk slowly ashore. When the\r\nCalais boat left he was comfortably asleep, a medical man watching by his\r\nside.\r\n\r\n“I can only say,” says Captain Webb, “that the moment when I touched the\r\nCalais sands, and felt the French soil beneath my feet, is one which I\r\nshall never forget, were I to live for a hundred years. I was terribly\r\nexhausted at the time, and during the last two or three hours I began to\r\nthink that, after all, I should fail. On the following day, after I had\r\nhad a good night’s rest, I did not feel very much the worse for what I had\r\nundergone. I had a peculiar sensation in my limbs, somewhat similar to\r\nthat which is often felt after the first week of the cricket season; and\r\nit was a week before I could wear a shirt‐collar, owing to a red raw rim\r\nat the back of my neck, caused by being obliged to keep my head back for\r\nso long a period; for, it must be remembered, I was in the water for very\r\nnearly twenty‐two hours.”(67)\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: CAPTAIN WEBB’S ARRIVAL AT CALAIS.]\r\n\r\nWhen Webb returned to London he met with an enthusiastic reception. In the\r\nCity he was welcomed by the same uproarious heartiness that Tom Sayers\r\nless deservedly received after his fight with Heenan. The cheering and\r\nhand‐shaking of Webb began at the “Baltic,” increased in warmth at\r\n“Lloyds,” and culminated at the Stock Exchange, where “bulls” and “bears”\r\nwere eclipsed by the lion of the day, and whence he had to beat a retreat\r\nto save his right hand from being wrung off.\r\n\r\nThe following will show the value of ingenuity in the midst of great\r\ndanger. It occurred at a terrible wreck, which took place on the coast, in\r\nthe sight of hundreds of powerless spectators:—“In the midst of these\r\nhorrifying moments a man was observed to jump from the wreck into the sea.\r\nIt was concluded by the watchers that he had voluntarily destroyed himself\r\nto avoid dying by inches and hunger. After all, who could blame him? It\r\nwas a question of only an hour or so, for hope there appeared none. But\r\nthe crowd was agreeably disappointed, for the man held his head up in the\r\nmidst of the hissing surges boldly, and although he disappeared every\r\nmoment, yet by the aid of good glasses his head was seen to bob up again,\r\na conspicuous black object in the surrounding foam. Expectation stood on\r\ntip‐toe. Would he reach the shore? was asked by a hundred voices in an\r\ninstant, and everybody was anxious to do something to assist a man who so\r\nnobly tried to assist himself. The minutes that followed were intensely\r\nexciting; every movement of the swimmer was eagerly noticed, and it was\r\nwith difficulty that several generous spirits were prevented from dashing,\r\nat all risks, into the sea to his assistance. Slowly, but surely, the poor\r\nfellow approached the shore—his head well up yet. He is just within the\r\nouter tier of the breakers—poor fellow! he will stand no chance now. See,\r\nhe is caught by a monstrous wave—he rides upon its crest, and is urged\r\nrapidly towards the beach; the horrid wave curls and breaks; he is rolled\r\nhead over heels; he is gone. No; he rights himself, and he is taken out to\r\nsea again by a retiring wave. Back he comes again—head over heels he goes\r\nonce more; but this time fortune pitied misfortune, for he was flung by a\r\nwave within reach of a coast‐guard, who, at the risk of his life, rushed\r\ninto the sea and saved him. The secret of his buoyancy soon appeared.\r\nUnder each arm he had lashed (as seamen only know how) an empty wine\r\nbottle, well corked, and he had stuffed several others under an elastic\r\nGuernsey shirt, and buttoned his trousers over all, and with these frail\r\nfloats he came through a heavy belt of breakers in safety.”(68)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“That man has saved seventeen lives single‐handed,” we heard a marine\r\nofficer say one day at Lowestoft, pointing to a fine handsome young fellow\r\nwho sat on the beach smoking his pipe. “He ought to be well off,” said a\r\nbystander. “He is well off,” was the answer. “He has the satisfaction of\r\nknowing that men, women, and children thank God for his bravery every\r\nday.”(69)\r\n\r\nBefore the establishment of a floating light off Happisburg, wrecks were\r\nvery numerous on the Cromer coast. One of the greatest philanthropists who\r\never lived, Thomas Fowell Buxton, the great anti‐slavery leader, spent\r\nmuch of his time at Cromer Hall, and was constantly on the shore during\r\nbad weather, urging and directing the efforts of others, and often “giving\r\na hand” himself. In the storm of the 31st October, 1823, still vividly\r\nremembered on that coast, Mr. Buxton performed an act of heroic bravery.\r\nAbout noon, a collier, the _Duchess of Cumberland_, ran upon the rocks off\r\nthe Cromer lighthouse. The life‐boatmen could not be induced to venture\r\nout, so terrific was the sea and surf. Once a wave ran up the beach and\r\nfloated the wreck. Buxton sprang into the water, hoping that others might\r\nbe induced to follow, but in vain. Captain Manby’s gun was fired several\r\ntimes, but the line fell short of the ill‐fated brig, on which nine poor\r\nsailors were seen lashed to the shrouds. At length a huge sea completely\r\nbroke her up, the water being blackened by the bursting coal. The helpless\r\nspectators looked on, horror‐stricken. “Poor dear hearts! they’re all gone\r\nnow,” exclaimed an old fisherman; but at that instant a body—was it alive\r\nor dead?—was seen on the crest of a wave. Without waiting for a rope, Mr.\r\nBuxton dashed into the surf, caught the exhausted sailor, flung himself\r\nupon him, and struggled against the strong reflux of the surf, until\r\nothers could reach him. He, with his living burden, was dragged to land,\r\nboth at that moment more dead than alive. Buxton said afterwards that he\r\nfelt the waves play with him as he could play with an orange.(70)\r\n\r\nThe record of a man in humbler life, John Ellerthorpe, foreman of the\r\nHumber Dock gates, Hull, who deservedly earned for himself the title of\r\n“Hero of the Humber” is very interesting. During a period of forty years\r\nhe saved _thirty‐nine_ individuals, most of whom were difficult cases, as\r\nthey fell into the Humber through intoxication.\r\n\r\nHis services were honourably recognised. Medals and other acknowledgments\r\nfrom the Royal Humane Society and the Board of Trade were showered on him;\r\nhe received a donation from the Royal Bounty, a purse of a hundred guineas\r\nfrom his townsmen, and other valuable testimonials. Turn we now to the\r\ncase of another hero, who saved one life more than Ellerthorpe, and until\r\nvery late in his career received no recognition whatever. A hero of the\r\nClyde now appears on the scene.\r\n\r\nIt is to Mr. Charles Reade, the distinguished novelist, poet, and\r\nplaywright, that we owe a “true and accurate account of the heroic feats\r\nand sad calamity of James Lambert, a living man.”(71) Mr. Reade had read\r\nin the _Glasgow Times_ of October 2nd, 1856, how, when a little boy was\r\ndrowning in the Clyde, an elderly blind man would have dived in but for\r\nhis granddaughter, who with a girl’s affection and unreasoning fears, had\r\nclung to his knees and utterly spoiled his good intentions. The boy was\r\ndrowned. The poor blind hero went home crying like a child, saying, “It\r\nwas a laddie flung away; clean flung away.”\r\n\r\nMr. Reade, after long and weary searching, found Lambert in a wretched\r\nlodging in Calton, a suburb of Glasgow, and easily extracted from him a\r\nfund of anecdote, a part only of which can be presented here.\r\n\r\nThe “first case” Lambert had attended to was a twenty‐stone “drooning”\r\nbaker, who gripped him tight to his breast, and nearly succeeded in\r\ndrowning him. Lambert was then a youth of about fourteen. Another was of a\r\npoor old washerwoman who had overbalanced herself in the water, and who\r\nwhen saved wanted to go and pawn her tub that she might reward him.\r\nInstead of which her rescuer “clappit a shellin’” in her hand, and\r\npromised to repeat the kindness each Saturday from his own meagre wages.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Reade had provided the poor old man with a little refreshment, he\r\ntold the following episode in his life.\r\n\r\n“Aweel, sirr, ye’ve heerd o’ the callant they wadna let me save—Hech,\r\nsirr, yon was a wean wastit(72)—noo, I’ll make ye the joodge whether I\r\ncould na hae saved that ane, and twarree mair. There’s a beck they ca’\r\n‘the Plumb’ rins doon fra’ the horsebrae into the Clyde near Stockwell\r\nBrigg. The bairns were aye for sporting in the beck, because it was\r\nshallow by ordinar, and ye’ll see them the color o’ vilets, and no’ hauf\r\nsae sweet, wi’ the dye that rins to the beck. Aweel, ae day there was a\r\nband o’ them there; and a high spate(73) had come doon and catched them,\r\nand the reesolt was I saw ane o’ th’ assembly in the Clyde. I had warned\r\nthe neer‐do‐weels, ye ken, mony’s the time. By good luck I was na far\r\naway, and went in for him and took him by the ear. ‘C’way, ye little\r\ndeevil,’ says I. I had na made three strokes when I am catched round the\r\nneck wi’ another callan.”\r\n\r\n“Where on earth did he spring from?”\r\n\r\n“I dinna ken. I was attending to number ane, when number twa poppit up,\r\njust to tak’ leave o’ Glasgee. I tell’t them to stick into me, and carried\r\nthe pair ashore. Directly there’s a skirl on the bank, and up comes number\r\nthree, far ahint me in the Clyde, and sinks before I can win(74) to him.\r\nDives for this one, and has a wark to find him at the bottom. Brings him\r\nashore in a kind o’ a dwam; but I had na fear for his life; he hadna been\r\ndoon lang; my lord had a deal more mischief to do, ye ken. By the same\r\ntoken he came to vara sune, and d’ye ken the first word he said to me? he\r\nsaid: ‘Dinna tell my feyther. Lord’s sake, man, dinna tell my feyther!’”\r\n\r\n“I never,” remarks Mr. Reade, “saw a man more tickled by a straw, than\r\nJames Lambert was at this. By contemplating him I was enabled in the\r\ncourse of time to lose my own gravity, for his whole face was puckered\r\nwith mirth, and every inch of it seemed to laugh.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said he, “wad ye believe it, some officious pairson tell’t his\r\nfeyther, in spite o’ us baith. He was just a labouring man. He called on\r\nme, and thank’t me vara hairtily, and gied me a refreshment. And I thoucht\r\nmair o’t than I hae thoucht o’ a hantle siller on the like occasions.”\r\n\r\nAfter one or two other savings, that entitled him to a medal or two,\r\nLambert admitted that, “By this time, sirr, I was aye prowling about day\r\nand night for vectims!” Mr. Reade suggested that he had the pride of an\r\nartist, and wanted them to fall in, that he might pull them out and show\r\nhis dexterity. Lambert answered that in those days swimming was not an\r\naccomplishment so common as now; and if such a thing as drowning was to\r\nbe, he would like to be there and save them. “Ech,” said he, “the\r\nsweetness o’t! the sweetness o’t!”\r\n\r\nHe next told a funny story of rescuing a boy, and running up to the house\r\nto have him properly cared for. “Then,” said he, “I’m going oot, when a’\r\nof a sooden I find I haena a steek on me, and twa hundred folk about the\r\ndoore. Wad ye believe it, _wi’ the great excitement I never knew I wa’\r\nnakit_ till I saw the folk and bethought me.” At the foot of the stairs he\r\nfound a bundle of linen, and he was not long in helping himself, coming\r\nback to the room in the wife’s apron and a sheet. “The sight o’ me made\r\nthe lasses skairt and skirl;(75) for I was like a corp just poppit oot of\r\nthe grave.” When he went for his clothes they had disappeared, but at last\r\nhe discovered that a young lady had carefully kept them for him behind a\r\nhedge, fearing that some one might steal them.\r\n\r\n“I come now,” says Mr. Reade, “to the crowning feat of this philanthropic\r\nand adventurous life, and I doubt my power to describe it. I halt before\r\nit like one that feels weak and a mountain to climb, for such a feat, I\r\nbelieve, was never done in the water by mortal man, nor never will again\r\nwhile earth shall last.\r\n\r\n“James Lambert worked in Somerville’s Mill. Like most of the hands, he\r\nmust cross the water to get home. For that purpose a small ferry‐boat was\r\nprovided: it lay at a little quay near the mill. One Andrew had charge of\r\nit ashore, and used to shove it off with a lever, and receive it on its\r\nreturn. He often let more people go into it than Lambert thought safe, and\r\nLambert had remonstrated, and had even said, ‘Ye’ll hae an accident some\r\nday that ye’ll rue but ance, and that will be a’ your life.’ Andrew, in\r\nreply to him, told him to mind his own business.\r\n\r\n“Well, one evening James Lambert wanted to get away in the first boat‐\r\nload. This was somehow connected with his having bought a new hat: perhaps\r\nhe wished to avoid the crowd of workpeople—here I am not very clear.\r\nHowever, he watched the great wheel, and the moment it began to waver,\r\nprevious to stopping, he ran for his hat and darted down the stairs. But\r\nas he worked in an upper storey full a dozen got into the boat before him.\r\nHe told Andrew to put off, but Andrew would not till the boat should be\r\nfull; and soon it was crammed. James Lambert then said it was a shame of\r\nhim to let so many on board. This angered the man, and when the boat was\r\nso crowded that her gunwale was not far above water, he shoved her\r\nviolently off into the tideway, and said words which, if he had not prayed\r\nGod to forgive them in this world, will perhaps hang heavy round his neck\r\nin the next.... ‘ye beggars!’ he cried.\r\n\r\n“This rough launching made the overladen boat wobble. The women got\r\nfrightened, and before the boat had gone twenty yards she upset in dark,\r\nicy water, ten feet deep. It was night.\r\n\r\n“Before the boat coupit(76) athegither they a’ flew to me that could, for\r\nthey a’ kenned me. I’ the water, them that hadna a hand o’ me, had a hand\r\no’ them that had a hand o’ me, and they carried me doon like leed. * * *\r\n\r\n“Sirr, when yeve twa feet i’ the grave, your mind warks hard. I didna\r\nstruggle, for it was nae mair use than to wrastle wi’ a kirk. I just\r\nstrauchtened myself oot like a corp, and let them tak’ me doon to the\r\nbottom of the Clyde, and there I stude upright and waited; for I kenned\r\nthe puir souls would droon afore me, and I saw just ae wee‐wee chance to\r\nsave them yet. Ye shall understond, sirr, that when folk are drooning,\r\nthey dinna settle doon till the water fills their lungs and drives the air\r\noot. At first they waver up and doon at sairtain intervals. Aweel, sirr, I\r\nwaited for that, on the grund. I was the only ane grunded, you’ll\r\nobsairve. A slight upward movement commenced. I took advantage, and gieda\r\nvi’lent spang wi’ my feet against the bottom, and wi’ me, choosing my\r\ntime, up we a’ came. My arms were grippit; but I could strike oot wi’ my\r\nfeet and before ever we reached the surface, I lashed oot like a deevil,\r\nfor the quay. Aweel, sirr, wi’ all I could do, we didna wend abune a yard,\r\nor may be a yard and a hauf and doone they carried me like leed. I\r\nstrauchtened myself as we sank, and I grunded. The lave were a’ roond me\r\nlike a fon.(77) I bides my time, and, when they are inclining upward I\r\nstrikes fra the grund; an’ this time, maur slanting towards the quay. That\r\nhelpit us, and in a dozen vi’lent strokes we maybe gained twa yards this\r\ntime. Then doon like leed. Plays the same game again, up, and doon again.\r\nAnd noo, sirr, there was something that turned sair against us; but then\r\nthere was something for us, to bollance it. It was against us that they\r\nhad swallowed their pint o’ water by this time, and were nae sae buoyant;\r\nit was for us that the water was shallower noo, maybe not more than twa\r\nfeet ower head. This wad droon us as weel as twanty; but wi’ nae mair nor\r\ntwa feet water abune us I could spring up fra the grun by mere force; for\r\nthe grun gies ye an awfu’ poower for a foot or twa. Sae noo I’m nae suner\r\ndoon than up again, and still creeping for the quay, and the water aye a\r\nwee bit shallower. The next news is, I get sair spent, and that was bad;\r\nbut to bollance that, some folk on the quay gat rapes and boat‐hooks, and\r\npickit off ane or twa that was the nearest; and now ilka time I cam’ up,\r\nthey pickit ane off, and that lightened my burden; and bymby I drave a\r\ncouple into shallow water mysel’, wi’ my feet. When I was in seven fut\r\nwater mysel’, and fewer folk hauding me doon, I got to be maister, and\r\nshovit ane, and pu’d anither in, till we landed the whole saxteen or\r\nseventeen. But my wark was na’ done, for I kenned there were mair in the\r\nriver. I saw the last o’ my ain band safe, and then oot into the Clyde,\r\nwherever I heerd cries, and sune I fund twa lasses skirling, takes ’em by\r\ntheir lang hair, and tows them to the quay in a minute. Just as I’m\r\nlanding thir(78) twa, I hear a cry in the vara middle of the river, and in\r\nI splash. It was a strapping lass—they caed her Elizabeth Whitelaw.\r\n‘C’way, ye lang daftie,’ says I, and begins to tow her. Lo an’ behold, I’m\r\ngrippit wi’ a man under the water. It was her sweetheairt. She was hauding\r\nhim doon. The hizzy was a’ reicht, but she was drooning the lad; pairts\r\nthese(79) twa lovers—for their gude—and taks ’em ashore, one in each hand.\r\nAweel, sirr, I saved just ane mair, and then I plunged in and sairched,\r\nbut there was nae mair to be seen noo: three puir lasses were drooned, but\r\nI didna ken that at the time. And noo I’ll tell ye a farce. I’m seized wi’\r\na faintness, and maks for the shore. But I gat weaker, and dazed‐like, and\r\nthe lights o’ Glasgee begins to flecker afore my een: and, thinks I, ‘I’ll\r\nno see _ye_ again; I’m done this time.’ It was all I could do for the bare\r\nlife, to drift to the hinder part of the quay. I hadna the power to draw\r\nmysel’ oot. I just grippit the quay and sobbit. The folk were a’ busy wi’\r\nthem I had saved; nane o’ them noticed me, and I would ha’ been drooned\r\nthat nicht: but wha d’ye think saved me, that had saved sae many?—an auld\r\ndecrepit man: haw! haw! haw! He had a hookit stick, and gied me the\r\nhandle, and towed me along the quay into shallow water, and I gat oot, wi’\r\nhis help, and swooned deed away. I’m tauld I lay there negleckit awhile;\r\nbut they fand me at last, and then I had fifty nurses for ane.”\r\n\r\nThe story of the cause of this hero’s blindness is very sad. He had dived\r\nin the river to save another while perspiring freely. It was winter, and\r\nthe water icy cold. Soon after a great dazzling seized him, followed by\r\ndarkness. This occurred again and again, until at last the darkness\r\nsettled on him, and the light fled for ever.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Reade first saw him, the single public honour paid him was that\r\nhe had the right, with one Bailie Harvey, to pass over a certain\r\nsuspension bridge gratis till his death, while the rest of mankind paid a\r\nhalfpenny! His only pension was one of three‐and‐sixpence a week from the\r\nBarony Parish, Glasgow. Mr. Reade’s efforts gained him an annuity, which\r\nhe unfortunately did not live long to enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE HAVEN AT LAST—HOME IN THE THAMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n      The “Mighty Thames”—Poor Jack Home Again—Provident Sailors—The\r\n            Belvedere Home and its Inmates—A Ship Ashore—Rival\r\n     Castaways—Greenwich Pensioners—The Present System Compared with\r\n         the Old—Freedom Outside the Hospital—The Observatory—The\r\n      Astronomer Royal—Modern Belief in Astrology—Site of Greenwich\r\n    Park—The Telescopes and Observations—The Clock which Sets the Time\r\n       for all England—Sad Reminiscences—The Loss of the _Princess\r\n    Alice_—The Old _Dreadnought_—The Largest Floating Hospital in the\r\n         World—The Trinity House: Its Constitution, Purposes, and\r\n             Uses—Lighthouses and Light‐vessels—Its Masters.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Let the Rhine be blue and bright\r\n  In its path of liquid light,\r\n  Where the red grapes fling a beam\r\n  Of glory on the stream;\r\n  Let the gorgeous beauty there\r\n  Mingle all that’s rich and fair;\r\n  Yet to me it ne’er could be\r\n  Like that river great and free,\r\n    The Thames! the mighty Thames!”\r\n\r\nThe poet’s enthusiasm may be pardoned, for, although there are scores of\r\nrivers, considered only as such alone, that outvie the Thames, regarding\r\nit in its relation to the sea—aye, to the whole world—it stands pre‐\r\neminent and alone. To the sailor the Thames and the Mersey have an\r\ninterest and importance which belong to the streams of no other country.\r\n\r\nThe reader has, in spirit, voyaged with poor Jack to the farthest corners\r\nof the earth; he has seen much of his life of peril and heroism; he has\r\nnoted that the hardships he endures are often unrequited, and that, after\r\na long career of usefulness and bravery, he may lie on the shore “a sheer\r\nhulk,” valueless to himself, possibly to die and rot in poverty and\r\ndistress. The charge of special improvidence cannot nowadays be hurled at\r\nthe sailor, as it might have been in days of old. Even Jack’s improvidence\r\nwas more excusable than the same fault in any other class whatever. The\r\nfact is—as such valuable institutions as the Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society\r\nhave proved—that there was a great desire on the part of seamen to help\r\nthemselves. The fortieth annual report of the Society (1879) states that\r\n48,000 mariners subscribe to the benefit fund organised under its\r\nauspices.(80) The history of this excellent association, which has now an\r\nincome of nearly £29,000, is interesting. “A worthy, philanthropic medical\r\nman, Mr. John Rye, of Bath, had a servant who had formerly been a sailor,\r\nand was in the habit of reading the newspapers to his master. One morning\r\ntheir attention was arrested by an account of some fearful wrecks of\r\nfishing boats, with loss of life, on the north coast of Devon. The servant\r\nasked his master if there was any fund out of which help could be obtained\r\nto relieve the families of those men. The master replied that he supposed\r\nthere was, but he would make inquiries from Admiral Sir Jahleen Brenton,\r\nthen Governor of Greenwich Hospital; and from him he found that there was\r\nnone. They then together drew up a prospectus, and presented it to the\r\nlate Admiral of the Fleet, Sir George Cockburn, who most heartily took the\r\nmatter up, and after circulating the appeal widely, called a public\r\nmeeting in February, 1839, at which Sir George was appointed President,\r\nand a number of noblemen and gentlemen formed themselves into a committee,\r\nof which the worthy Chairman, Captain the Hon. Francis Maude, R.N., is now\r\nthe sole survivor. The following month Her Majesty the Queen graciously\r\nconsented to be the Patron of the Society; and so prosperous was the\r\ninfant institution, that at the second anniversary, at which the late Sir\r\nRobert Peel consented to preside, the sum of £1,100 was collected. The\r\nCommittee next set about to obtain the services of gentlemen to act as\r\nhonorary agents, of whom there are now upwards of 1,000; and whose duties\r\nare to board, lodge, clothe, and forward to their homes all shipwrecked\r\npersons. The Committee meet every Friday in London to relieve the widows\r\nand orphans of the lost, not only at the time of their death, but by small\r\nannual payments. There were thus 9,601 persons relieved in 1879.”(81)\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: THE HOME FOR AGED MERCHANT SEAMEN, BELVEDERE, KENT.]\r\n\r\nSooth to say, and in strict justice, we must not forget how much has been\r\ndone for the seaman on the banks of old Father Thames, both by Government\r\nand private liberality. An excellent home, the “Royal Alfred Aged Merchant\r\nSeamen’s Institution” exists at Belvedere, in Kent, started under the\r\nauspices of the Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society. This institution was\r\ninaugurated, with room for the reception of 400 persons of all grades of\r\nthe mercantile marine, although nothing like that number has been as yet\r\naccommodated at any one time. The Society also grants out‐pensions to\r\nthose who have homes or friends.\r\n\r\nThe most singular and characteristic and yet appropriate features of the\r\nbuilding are a number of little cabins comfortably fitted, and so much\r\nlike the real thing, that it requires only a very slight stretch of the\r\nimagination for Jack ashore to indulge in the fond delusion that he is at\r\nsea again. The large rooms are divided into wards, one for masters and\r\nmates, containing ten cabins, each six feet by seven feet, and perfect\r\nventilation is secured by the partitions being open at the top. Each man,\r\nby this excellent arrangement, has his little cabin to himself, and all\r\nthe sweetness of retirement should he be that way inclined. What a\r\ncontrast is this to the ungainly, unhomely, and barren shelters of our\r\nUnions!\r\n\r\nIt speaks well for the profession that most of the inmates have seen over\r\nforty or fifty years of service, which, judging from what we know of\r\nservice in the maritime navy, might decidedly be called active. On being\r\ninterrogated by a visitor, some of these veterans proved having most\r\nsuccessfully braved the dangers of the deep.\r\n\r\n“How often have you been wrecked?” inquired the interviewer of our\r\n“ancient mariner.”\r\n\r\n“Why, let me see, sir”—then, counting half audibly—“one, two, three, four,\r\nfive times, I think, sir.”\r\n\r\nThe second, on being questioned, answered, simply, “Once in 1825,\r\nsir—going to Hamburg that was; and once in 1828, on the coast of Norway;\r\nand again on the coast of Java in ’42.” This man had also done some\r\nmemorable deeds on shore, which fully made up for his being short by “two”\r\nwrecks of the other.\r\n\r\nGreenwich Hospital next demands our attention, as once the great home and\r\nasylum for the seamen of the navy, although now a hospital only. It was\r\nfounded in the year 1694, in memory of Queen Mary, who had long designed\r\nthe foundation of such an institution. It was also built as a monument of\r\nthe great victory of La Hogue. Sir Christopher Wren furnished the designs\r\nand plans for the edifice gratuitously—a noble gift from a professional\r\narchitect, and valuable to boot. The object of the foundation was “to\r\nencourage the seamen of this kingdom to continue the industry and\r\nskilfulness of their employments, by which they had for a long time\r\ndistinguished themselves throughout the world;” “to encourage them to\r\ncontinue also their ancient reputation for the courage and constancy\r\nmanifested in engagements for the defence and honour of their native\r\ncountry;” “to invite greater numbers of his Majesty’s subjects to betake\r\nthemselves to the sea;” and so forth. In sooth, the condition of the\r\nGreenwich pensioner was not, for a long period, particularly enviable. On\r\nadmission he was required to relinquish any pension he might have gained\r\nin the service. Maimed men received only _tenpence_ a day, and a shilling\r\na week, intended for tobacco and the humbler comforts of life. The\r\nCommissioners at one time stated that “the wives are wholly ignored, and\r\ntheir circumstances are deplorable.” From the Hospital they received only\r\nthe broken meat of the hall and the rations of men on leave of absence.\r\nThe wives were often reduced to the parish. No wonder the poor old veteran\r\nused to be so glad for a sixpence or even a “screw” of tobacco in return\r\nfor his tough yarns!\r\n\r\nThe system has been entirely changed. At present all are out‐pensioners,\r\nand when in good health can follow other employments. On the 26th\r\nSeptember, 1865, the Greenwich exodus commenced. On that day nearly 200\r\nout of the 900 pensioners of Greenwich Hospital who had accepted the\r\nAdmiralty offer of pension allowance, in conformity with an Act passed in\r\nthe previous session of Parliament, left that establishment for the\r\nvarious parts of the country they had selected for their future home.\r\nSince that time the whole have left; and the institution which, only a few\r\nyears ago, had upwards of 2,000 inmates, now contains only a few hundred\r\nsick and disabled. Greenwich Hospital is a changed institution, and the\r\nsystem of rewarding those who have spent their lives in the service of\r\ntheir country is made more consistent with humanity, morality, and common\r\nsense. Instead of hundreds of elderly but still hale and athletic veterans\r\nwandering listlessly about the terraces and colonnades of Greenwich, and,\r\nif the truth must be told, sometimes overstepping the bounds of sobriety\r\nin the numerous public‐houses of the neighbourhood, there are but a\r\nlimited number of indoor‐pensioners, and those are such as may be\r\nfittingly provided for in a place bearing the name of a hospital. They are\r\ndisabled seamen in the strict sense of the term—poor worn‐out old fellows\r\nwho require to be taken care of, and who have, perhaps, no one but the\r\nnation to take care of them. The blind, the doting, the crippled, find\r\ncomfortable board and lodging, and, without doubt, attentive nursing in\r\nthe national hospital. But, as there are constantly new applications for\r\nadmission, it is probable that there will always be a few hundreds in the\r\nestablishment. On the first and third Thursday in each month a board sits\r\nat Somerset House to consider the claims of applicants for admission, and\r\nthose who are passed are sent in an omnibus to the hospital. But for the\r\nlarge body of men who, though too old to reef top‐sails and to work guns,\r\nare not too old to do something for their own living, and to wish for\r\nliberty and domestic life, there is the allowance before mentioned from\r\nthe funds of the hospital, and the power of living where and how they\r\nplease.\r\n\r\n“What the average pension granted may be,” said a writer in the _Cornhill\r\nMagazine_, “we have no means of knowing, but if some of the men have a\r\nlarger sum than £36 10s., so also many of them will have much less, and\r\nwill be unable to command in their homes the standard of living with which\r\nthe Hospital supplied them. They elect to go, we take it, partly because\r\nthey know the government of the place is to be changed, that it is to\r\nbecome a hospital in the narrower sense of the word, and that there will\r\nbe less freedom of ingress and egress for them henceforth; but this is\r\nonly part of a more general feeling in favour of liberty among them, at\r\nwhich nobody who has inquired into their condition can wonder. The\r\nauthorities at Greenwich Hospital have contrived to make a palace as dull\r\nas a prison. The men have had no amusements but a library inconveniently\r\nfurnished. They have not been allowed to have flower‐pots in their\r\nwindows, nor to receive friends and visitors in private; and it is not\r\nmany years ago since they were forbidden to walk on the terraces. Some of\r\nthe punishments, too—such as being compelled to wear a yellow collar and\r\ndo scavengers’ work—have been harsh and injudicious. All these things have\r\ncombined with the monastic character of the place to give a character of\r\n_ennui_ and listlessness to the Greenwich pensioner’s life, which must\r\nhave struck every observing visitor. Dulness has been relieved within the\r\nwalls chiefly by temptation without.\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: GREENWICH HOSPITAL.]\r\n\r\n“Since the age when Queen Mary pictured to herself Greenwich as a place of\r\npious repose, where the sailor might end his days in the fear of God, it\r\nhas become the favourite haunt of the pleasure‐loving cockney—an emporium\r\nof shrimps, a reservoir of beer. Those quaint figures—the ‘geese’ and\r\n‘blue‐bottles’ of local slang—lounging about under the trees of the park,\r\nand loitering through the streets in the dress of another age, have been\r\nregarded by the holiday‐maker from the metropolis as parts of the\r\namusements of the place. They have been paid for yarns in drink and stray\r\nshillings, and have found the doctrine that sailors lived only for grog\r\nand tobacco accepted by their admirers as one of the glories of the\r\nBritish navy. It has been well remarked that, as a whole, the old fellows\r\nhave been more decent in their lives than we had a right to expect under\r\nthe peculiar circumstances. But a chapter might be written on Greenwich\r\nmorality and its effects on the parish rates, which nobody would care to\r\nbind up with the naval histories of Brenton or James, but which would help\r\nto reconcile the reader to the break‐up of an institution which has had\r\nmuch in it to kindle the imagination and justify the pride of our\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: GREENWICH PENSIONERS.]\r\n\r\n“The break‐up is, after all, one in which people will acquiesce rather\r\nthan one at which they will rejoice. It was a noble as well as a pious\r\nidea to gather under the roofs of a grand edifice—at once a dwelling‐place\r\nand a naval monument, and placed on the shores of a river itself one of\r\nthe chief sources of our maritime strength—the survivors of each\r\ngeneration of warriors against the enemy or the storm. Here the traditions\r\nof one age blended gradually with the experience of the next; stories of\r\nShovel were passed on to those who fought under Hawke; the conqueror with\r\nRodney lived to welcome the heroes of Trafalgar—not as bedridden or\r\nimbecile men, though they might be somewhat shattered—but still able to\r\nenjoy life, and to give the vividness of reality to the narratives of the\r\npast. All phases of naval service were represented. One of the ‘saucy\r\n_Arethusa’s_’ smoked his pipe with an old _Agamemnon_, and men who had\r\nfirst smelt powder on the Canadian lakes listened reverently to the\r\nrecollections of those who had seen _L’Orient_ explode in thunder at the\r\nNile. Greenwich Hospital will always be a great and useful institution—a\r\nmighty boon, whether to the sick nursed within or to the poor pensioned\r\nwithout its walls.”\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Greenwich we must certainly pay a visit to the Observatory,\r\na building which has such intimate relations with the sea. The account\r\nwhich follows is that of M. Esquiros,(82) who particularly studied all our\r\ninstitutions connected with maritime interests:—\r\n\r\n“I entered,” says he, “a well‐lighted apartment, the walls of which were\r\ncovered with charts, engravings, photographic portraits of the moon, and\r\nDonati’s famous comet of 1858. Mr. [now Sir George] Airy, the Astronomer\r\nRoyal, is a man who has grown grey in the study of the stars; his\r\nenergetic features indicate the incessant activity of the strong intellect\r\nwhich for more than a quarter of a century has upheld the reputation of\r\nGreenwich Observatory. On his writing‐table were heaped a quantity of\r\npapers covered with calculations, and a maze of letters as to a thousand\r\nmatters of business. A large iron cupboard contains all the precious\r\ndocuments which will, no doubt, one day serve to trace out the scientific\r\nhistory of the nineteenth century. Here, for instance, are preserved the\r\nletters and authentic documents which are destined to modify certain\r\nreceived opinions as to the discovery of the planet Neptune. In this\r\ncupboard may also be found the records of bygone errors and chimerical\r\nideas, which one wonders to find reappearing in this enlightened age.\r\n\r\n“It is difficult to believe that many amongst the English still confound\r\nastronomy with judicial astrology; but Mr. Airy preserves a very curious\r\ncollection—letters that he has received from all classes of persons,\r\nasking what his terms are for _drawing a horoscope_. Sometimes it is a\r\nyoung man wishing to know ‘who will be his wife;’ at others it is a lady,\r\non the eve of embarking in the great business of life, who desires to\r\nconsult the stars. Postage‐stamps are occasionally sent with these\r\nmissives, and he or she who consults the oracle promises to make known, if\r\nnecessary, the true day and hour of their birth. The fact is, that a great\r\nmany people can scarcely understand how the astronomers can contemplate\r\nthe vault of heaven by day and night without endeavouring to trace out the\r\nsecret of human destiny. Some years back a young lady dressed in good\r\ntaste applied at the door of the Observatory; she felt interested in one\r\nof her near relations, a sailor in the Pacific Ocean, from whom no news\r\nhad been received for several years. After she had had a few minutes’\r\nconversation with one of the assistants, she went away bathed in tears,\r\nbecause the stars were not able to tell her if the object of her\r\naffections were still alive.”\r\n\r\nOn the ground that Greenwich Park now occupies there once stood an ancient\r\ntower, built about the year 1440, by Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, and\r\nuncle to King Henry VI. In the time of Elizabeth it was called\r\n_Mirefleur_. In 1642 the name of Greenwich Castle was given to it. Sir\r\nJames Moore and Sir Christopher Wren pointed out the site of this fortress\r\nto Charles II. as the best place for the construction of an observatory.\r\nThe old feudal tower was therefore pulled down, and over its remains was\r\nraised an edifice dedicated to the contemplation of the stars.\r\n\r\n“The building was scarcely finished ere Flamsteed was installed in it,\r\nwith the title of Astronomer Royal, and an emolument of £100 a year. He\r\npresided over the new establishment for more than half a century, and\r\nspent more than £2,000 of his own money. His works will always be looked\r\nupon in England as the starting point of modern astronomy. He may be\r\ndeemed the founder of Greenwich observatory. His successors were Halley,\r\nBradley, Nathaniel Bliss, and Dr. Nevil Maskelyn, the author of four\r\nvolumes, of which it is said by Delampre, ‘that if, in consequence of some\r\ngreat revolution every record of science had been lost, with the exception\r\nof this collection, in it would be found materials quite sufficient for\r\nbuilding up again the science of modern astronomy.’ Maskelyn was followed\r\nby John Pond, who died in 1835; his place is now supplied by Mr. Airy.\r\n\r\n“The Astronomer Royal is nominated by the First Lord of the Treasury, and\r\nperforms his functions under the warrant of the great seal of state; his\r\nsalary is fixed at £800 per annum. One of his principal duties is to\r\npreserve for Greenwich observatory that character which the founder\r\nhimself wished to impress upon it. The Astronomer Royal is therefore bound\r\nby the express terms of his commission, ‘to devote himself with the\r\ngreatest care to correcting the tables of the celestial movements, and to\r\ndetermine the positions of the fixed stars, in order to furnish the long‐\r\ndesired means of discovering the longitude at sea, and of thus bringing to\r\nperfection the art of navigation.’ It is also necessary that he should\r\nreside in the observatory, and devote all his time to the duties of his\r\noffice, never absenting himself for any long period without having\r\npreviously obtained the sanction of the Lords of the Admiralty.\r\n\r\n“Consulted as he is by various branches of the Government, he is able to\r\nrender assistance to the public service by his advice and information,\r\nwell assured that he himself can never be affected by any of the changes\r\nin official power, or by any of the results of political conflict. His\r\nresidence has a garden attached to it, which is parted off from the\r\ngrounds of the park, and well planted with fruit‐trees. He has under his\r\ncontrol eight assistants, and ordinarily six computers.\r\n\r\n“It is curious to see these computers in their two offices, one situated\r\non the ground floor near the study of the Astronomer Royal, and the other\r\nisolated in one of the quietest parts of the observatory, all sedately\r\noccupied in reckoning up, from morning to night, dull columns of figures.\r\n\r\n“Before describing what Greenwich observatory _is_, it would be better\r\nperhaps to state first what it is _not_. It relinquishes to other\r\ninquirers the task of discovering spots in the sun and mountains in the\r\nmoon. The observations of the assistants are not directed either to the\r\nfigures of the planets or to the extraordinary movements of the double\r\nstars, revolving one round the other in the depths of the firmament, or\r\nthe mysteries of the nebulæ. What a firmness of character, what a truly\r\nEnglish strength of will have these observers shown, in voluntarily\r\ndrawing a veil over some of the most splendid wonders of the heavens! At\r\nthe time of John Pond, a telescope twenty feet in length had been erected\r\nin the establishment at great expense, but as it was a strong attraction\r\nto visitors, he caused the instrument to be dismantled. About the year\r\n1847 Mr. Lerebours offered to Greenwich observatory the largest refracting\r\ntelescope which had ever been constructed. The temptation was certainly a\r\ngreat one; it would have been flattering to the self‐esteem of the\r\ninstitution to have possessed a wonder of this sort, unique as it was in\r\nthe world. Mr. Airy need only to have said the word, and the Lords of the\r\nAdmiralty would assuredly have made the purchase. But the Astronomer, on\r\nthe contrary, held the present aloof with a determined hand. What was it\r\nthat he feared? The perfidious influence of such a siren, which, by\r\nconcentrating attention on the beauties of the heavens, would perhaps have\r\nturned away the attention of the assistants from their daily task, and\r\nhave compromised the success of the Observatory.\r\n\r\n“An observation of the sun takes place at least once a week at mid‐day, in\r\nthe transit circle room, and a large portion of the staff of the\r\nestablishment take a part in it; but it is at night that one can form the\r\nbest idea of the mode in which the transit of the heavenly bodies over the\r\nmeridian is duly verified.\r\n\r\n“The first observations made with the new transit circle date from 1851,\r\nand, from that time to the present they have never been discontinued. The\r\nassistant who is appointed, aided by this instrument to watch the state of\r\nthe heavens, is on guard for twenty‐four hours, _i.e._, from three in the\r\nmorning until three a.m. the next day. Except under extraordinary\r\ncircumstances, the same duties are never assigned to an assistant two days\r\nrunning. Having already worked some hours after sunset, he goes home to\r\ntake his evening meal, and when he returns into the transit circle room it\r\nis quite night. The shutters, which, during the day shut in a part of the\r\nceiling, are now unclosed, and by means of this aperture the whole sky\r\nseems thrown open to the room.\r\n\r\n“Having consulted his list, and adjusted his telescope, he commences his\r\nsteady gaze. His intentness can only be compared to that of a sportsman,\r\nor still better to that of a pointer dog, only, instead of a partridge or\r\na woodcock, he is eagerly waiting to see a star get up. There it is at\r\nlast! It comes into view quick and sudden as a meteor. Scarcely has it\r\nentered into the telegraphic field of sight than it appears to approach\r\nrapidly some objects which look like a series of transverse iron bars\r\nplaced at equal distances from each other. These, however, in reality, are\r\nnothing but threads of the thickness of a spider’s web, stretched\r\naccording to a system in the interior of the telescope, and wonderfully\r\nmagnified by the power of the lenses.\r\n\r\n“The assistants are all astronomers by profession, and their eyes have\r\nbeen well trained by continual practice. How, then, can it happen, that\r\ntheir observations do not always prove accordant one with another? There\r\nis a physiological mystery hidden in the fact which it would be\r\ninteresting to penetrate. Each observer, although operating with the same\r\ninstrument and guided by the same plan, perceives a celestial\r\nphenomenon—as, for instance, the transit of a star—either sooner or later\r\nthan another does. This variation is attributed to the idiosyncrasy of the\r\nsense of sight in each individual, or to the more or less prompt manner in\r\nwhich the eye telegraphs its impression to the brain. It must, of course,\r\nbe quite understood that no considerable inequalities of time are in\r\nquestion here; it is, at the most, some fraction of a second that I am\r\nalluding to; but the astronomical transit observations are of so delicate\r\na nature, that the slightest errors would destroy their worth. Under these\r\ncircumstances it has been found necessary to establish an average or\r\nstandard, and each observer gets to know precisely how far his visual\r\nfaculties vary from the ideal. Hence arises a question, incomprehensible\r\nto the uninitiated, which, however, is commonly asked among astronomers\r\nthemselves—‘What is the value of your personal equation?’ This inquiry is\r\nanswered by a figure expressing the particular amount of deviation from\r\nthe standard. The most singular thing is, that the value of the personal\r\nequation is different in the same individual as regards the various\r\ncelestial bodies. Some can very quickly discern the phenomena of a fixed\r\nstar who are much slower in perceiving those of the moon, and _vice\r\nversâ_. In order to obviate the inconvenience which might result from the\r\nvariations in personal equations, they also have recourse to a very\r\ningenious plan. An eye‐piece with two tubes allows two assistants\r\nsimultaneously to observe the passage of the same star over the same\r\nthreads in the instrument; they both listen to the ticking of the clock\r\nmarking the seconds, and separately calculate the results of their\r\nobservations, which are afterwards compared. To obtain a greater degree of\r\ncertitude, they occasionally exchange places. In this way the slightest\r\nchances of error are eliminated. The aberrations of the instrument must\r\nalso be taken into account. Notwithstanding its excellence and the\r\nsolidity with which it is fixed to stone walls sunk into the ground, it\r\nsometimes is affected by slight vibrations, which can only be attributed\r\nto the _terra firma_ on which it is constructed. Mr. Airy has noticed this\r\nsame phenomenon at Cambridge, whence he has come to the conclusion ‘that\r\nthe surface of the earth, commonly regarded as the base of all solidity,\r\nis itself in movement.’\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: THE GREAT EQUATORIAL TELESCOPE IN THE DOME, GREENWICH\r\n                              OBSERVATORY.]\r\n\r\n“‘I am going to show you the clock which sets the time for all England,’\r\nsaid the Astronomer Royal to me, as he conducted me into a little room\r\noccupying one of the oldest parts of the edifice. Covered with its simple\r\nmahogany case, this _Mother clock_, as it is called, is not unlike one of\r\nthose venerable wooden‐cased clocks that one meets with sometimes in the\r\nold English manor‐houses. No one, however, could fail to discover that the\r\nmechanism in this time‐keeper is new and uncommon. Its chief\r\ncharacteristic is that it possesses two distinct attributes. In the first\r\nplace it marks the time most exactly; and, in the next, it communicates\r\nthis power to other clocks as well. It has therefore been called the\r\n_Mother clock_, because it animates in the Observatory eight of its\r\n_daughters_. Its dial is divided into three circles, one of which marks\r\nthe hours, another the minutes, and a third the seconds. One hand only\r\nmoves round each of these dials, and thus points out the generally‐\r\naccepted measures of time.\r\n\r\n“The Observatory transmits signals every hour to the telegraph‐office in\r\nLothbury, in the City of London, whence, by a network of galvanic wires,\r\nthe knowledge of the true time is spread along the lines of railway to the\r\nextremities of Great Britain. This vast Æolian harp covers thus with its\r\nchords nearly the whole surface of the British Isles, and vibrates in\r\nunison with one prime mover.\r\n\r\n“As regards the true time, these telegraphic wires have a double mission.\r\nThe current leaving Greenwich transmits the signal given by the clock at\r\nthe Observatory, and what is called a return current then communicates the\r\nerrors of the other clock on which the _Mother_ has just acted. ‘I would\r\nnever undertake to regulate a clock from which I did not get regular\r\nreplies,’ said the Astronomer Royal; and just as we were passing in front\r\nof a galvanic apparatus, ‘Stop!’ he added, ‘the great clock at Westminster\r\nis at this very moment giving me an account of itself; it goes well, and\r\nis only the twentieth part of a second slow. Twice a day in this way it\r\nkeeps me informed of the state of its health.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow Greenwich one of the saddest catastrophes of the century occurred in\r\n1879, one which has its lessons for all who voyage. We refer to the loss\r\nof the _Princess Alice_. A pleasure steamer, one of the largest and best\r\nknown of the London Steam‐packet Company, with some 700 happy merrymakers,\r\na large proportion of whom were children, left London Bridge on Tuesday\r\nmorning, September 3rd, 1878, for Gravesend and Sheerness, and everything,\r\neven the temper of our uncertain climate, combined to make the day one of\r\nreal and innocent pleasure. How true is it that danger is never so near as\r\nwhen we deem it farthest off. It was eight o’clock in the evening when the\r\n_Princess Alice_ hove in sight off Woolwich Arsenal, with her living\r\nfreight of gladsome excursionists. The song that comes when toil ceases,\r\nthe careless laugh and harmless jest were going round; eager eyes watched\r\nthe dim lights of home glinting through the purple September twilight, and\r\nno whispered thought of peril dulled the harmony of the day, when a large\r\nsteam collier, the _Bywell Castle_, loomed darkly in the gloom.\r\n\r\nThose who feared the least and knew the most from experience were the\r\nfirst to see the danger—the danger that, in the time, no human skill or\r\ningenuity could avert. The _Princess Alice_, steaming on at good speed,\r\nhad attained an impetus, and, together with the adverse tide and confined\r\nspace, defeated the ready efforts of the commanders of both vessels, and\r\nthe collision came. There was no time to think—no time to act; there was a\r\nfearful cracking and tearing, during which it seemed that the _Bywell\r\nCastle_ would walk right through the ill‐fated pleasure‐boat, and in that\r\ndread and awe‐inspiring moment the startled eye saw its fate, and the\r\nhappy heart was stilled in horror. Only five minutes from the time the\r\nvessels struck, and all that was then the _Princess Alice_ lay cradled in\r\nthe mud at the bottom of the Thames.\r\n\r\nSave for the few who clambered on to the _Bywell Castle_, and the\r\nproportionately fewer who could swim ashore, the entire human freight was\r\nhurled into the black and fœtid river, or carried down in the cabins and\r\nsaloon of the submerged sepulchre. How terribly was this proved when the\r\nwreck was raised! The unfortunate passengers were found packed together at\r\nthe foot of the companion ladders with no time to move hand or foot, with\r\nno air to breathe, stifled where they stood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLLISION OF THE _BYWELL CASTLE_ AND THE _PRINCESS ALICE_.]\r\n\r\nCollisions amongst iron ships have been so painfully frequent of late\r\nyears that it is impossible to conjecture what may be the result of this\r\nwholesale loss of life in the future. It is doubtful, however, whether any\r\nprevious accident ever equalled in its harrowing results the loss of the\r\n_Princess Alice_. Excepting the fatal accident to the _Grosser Kurfürst_,\r\nthe running down of the _Northfleet_ off Dungeness by the Spanish steamer\r\n_Murillo_, comes next in horror to the cutting in two of the _Princess\r\nAlice_. This terrible affair, and the heartless conduct of the commander\r\nof the Spanish steamer, will make the night of the 22nd of January, 1873,\r\never memorable in the dark annals of the sea; 293 persons went down with\r\nthe ill‐fated passenger ship. A sad case was that of the _Lady Elgin_, run\r\ninto by a schooner on Lake Michigan on September 8th, 1860. The _Lady\r\nElgin_ was an excursion steamer with 400 souls on board; she sank within\r\nfifteen minutes of the collision and with the loss of 287 people. Then,\r\nagain, in 1854, in this fatal month of September, on the 27th, the\r\n_Arctic_, a ship of the Collins line, came into collision with the screw\r\nsteamer _Vesta_ in a fog. This time the scene of the tragic disaster was\r\nthe coast of Newfoundland; out of a list of 368 all told, 323 were lost,\r\namong whom were the Duc de Grammont and the Duc de Guynes. In the same\r\nyear we have to record the loss of the _City of Glasgow_ with 480 persons\r\non board; and the _Lady Nugent_, a British transport, which carried\r\nreinforcements for the army at Rangoon; the total loss in this case was\r\n400. Neither of these ships was ever heard of after leaving port; a fate\r\nas terrible and mysterious as that which befell the _City of Boston_ and\r\nthe _Pacific_, the former of which left Liverpool on the 23rd of January,\r\n1856, with 186; while the _City of Boston_ had 191 persons on board when\r\nshe sailed from Halifax, N.S., on January 26, 1870. Who amongst the living\r\ndoes not remember that black‐letter day when news arrived in England of\r\nthe capsizing of the _Captain_ off Cape Finisterre on September 7, 1870,\r\nwith Captain Burgoyne and a complement of 500 all told, which remains the\r\ngreatest calamity that has yet befallen the British Navy.\r\n\r\nThe army, however, suffered a loss nearly as appalling in the foundering\r\nof the _Birkenhead_ off the Cape of Good Hope, where a contingent, made up\r\nfrom the 12th Lancers, 23rd and 92nd Foot, helped to make up the 438 lives\r\ndestroyed on that occasion, February 26, 1852. Nor were the greatest\r\nhorrors entirely occasioned by the unruly elements and the sometimes\r\npitiless sea, for added to these ever‐impending dangers was the\r\nincombatable enemy—fire. The most heart‐rending on record of these marine\r\nconflagrations was that which destroyed the S.S. _Austria_ on its way from\r\nHamburg to New York, U.S., on September 23, 1858. By this fire, out of 528\r\npassengers and crew, 461 were either burnt to death or drowned; how many\r\nmet the more horrible death of burning can never be known, nor is it well\r\nfor the mind to dwell upon the painful subject. Going back a little\r\nfarther we find the record of the burning of the _Ocean Monarch_ in\r\nAbergele Bay, August 24, 1848, with loss of 178 lives. Then we have the\r\nS.S. _London_, which went down in the Bay of Biscay on January 11, 1866,\r\ncarrying down with her to a watery grave 239 out of a complement of 258.\r\nThe wrecks of the _Atlantic_ and the _Royal Charter_ are conspicuous in\r\nthe black list: the latter, an Australian clipper ship, was smashed to\r\npieces on the coast of Anglesea on October 26, 1859, when, while some\r\nforty people or so managed to get on shore, 459 of men, women, and\r\nchildren, were added to the ocean sepulchre. The _Atlantic_, of the White\r\nStar Line, struck on a sunken rock off Nova Scotia, April 1, 1873, and 481\r\nout of 931 were lost. The _Annie Jane_, of Liverpool, swells the death‐\r\nroll by 393, by being driven on shore at Barra Island, one of the\r\nHebrides, on September 29, 1853; while the _Pomona_, another emigrant\r\nship, through carelessness in the reckoning, went ashore on the Wexford\r\ncoast on April 28, 1859, losing 386 lives. And this sad list only\r\nrepresents the more prominent cases which occurred during thirty years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the chief outward and visible sign of usefulness of the Seamen’s\r\nHospital Society exists no longer on the Thames, many of our readers knew\r\nthe old _Dreadnought_ well. She was the largest floating hospital in the\r\nworld, and no other ship housed so cosmopolitan a crew as could be found\r\namong her 200 patients. Dysentery, scurvy, hepatic diseases in most\r\nvarieties, and typhoid, were among the medical specialities to be seen on\r\nboard, and it is probable that Budd gained much of his experience of\r\nenteric fever from this ship, which received annually from sixty to\r\nseventy cases of the disease. The surgical practice was equally useful,\r\nand we believe that the first resection (that of the shoulder) in London\r\nwas performed by Busk on the _Dreadnought_. A large number of men, now\r\nteaching in our schools, gleaned useful knowledge here, and (an important\r\nmatter in surgery) learnt how to do little things well. Although in\r\nmaintaining a necessary and constant communication with the shore, there\r\nwere the usual perils of water, including a strong current, a crowded\r\nstream, ice, &c., no person engaged directly or indirectly in the business\r\nof the ship was ever drowned during the half century that she and her\r\npredecessors were moored off Greenwich. The late Dr. Rooke, one of the\r\nablest and kindest of the _Dreadnought’s_ officers, nobly earned the\r\nHumane Society’s medal by saving a boy who fell off a barge close at hand;\r\nthree patients jumped overboard at different times, in a state of\r\ndelirium, but all were rescued and recovered. There were convivial\r\ngatherings now and again in the snug recess of the admiral’s cabin, used\r\nas a mess room by the medical staff. The _Dreadnought_ suffered many blows\r\nfrom without, and was run into seriously on several occasions. But the old\r\nship stood it all, and was missed by the bargemen, who made a cushion of\r\nher wherewith to cannon off to the opposite shore. There can be no doubt\r\nthat the managing committee of the Seamen’s Hospital Society acted wisely\r\nin removing their clients to a home on shore, so that we need not say\r\naltogether regretfully, although truly, “Take her all in all, we shall not\r\nlook upon her like again.”\r\n\r\nOf all the hospitals there is none so interesting as a sailor’s, and that\r\nat Greenwich, which represents the old _Dreadnought_ floating hospital, is\r\nparticularly so. It is here Jack ashore is seen at his best, and his best\r\nis very good indeed as a general thing, especially when all the good\r\nqualities are developed as they are when he settles down to enjoy the\r\nautumn calm of his life, which generally begins in the hospital. Not only\r\nare there seamen from every clime, and every creed, too, here, but one\r\nward is occupied by a few old naval pensioners. In this ward the first\r\nthing that attracts the eye, and is placed prominently over the fire‐\r\nplace, is Dibdin’s simple legend of the “Sweet little cherub that sits up\r\naloft.” Every inmate of this ward could tell his interesting yarn of\r\npersonal experiences of the Battle and the Breeze. One old fellow is both\r\nblind and deaf, and still happy and contented under the sympathetic care\r\nof an ancient cherub, who has sailed through three‐quarters of a century\r\nof life’s uncertain tide. Why the blind tar should be called “the\r\nnightingale” has not been clearly stated, though the fact remains the\r\nsame, and may possibly refer to great vocal powers. His messmate has been\r\nthrough enough battles to fill a volume; while another, an octogenarian\r\nmarine, speaks with pride of the part he took in the _Chesapeake_ affair,\r\nwhich was beaten and captured _thirteen minutes_ after the first gun was\r\nfired by the weather‐beaten _Shannon_.\r\n\r\n“You see,” he is wont to say, as he straightens himself, “by my military\r\ncut that I’m not a regular tar, though I’ve been in as many cutting‐out\r\nparties as any a’most, and had the grape and canister pelting round me\r\nlike hailstones, pretty nigh as often as I remembers feeling real\r\nhailstones. But I remembers best when the king—God bless him!—sent out\r\nthirty barrels of porter, that me and the rest of us might drink his\r\nmajesty’s health in; that was in the time of the war with Ameriky, and\r\ngood times they was too,” a little bit of individual opinion that no one\r\nwould dream of controverting here. Next come we to another pensioner, who\r\nsits over the fire hugging his feeble knees, and who is just in the last\r\nyear of his ninth decade. _He_ tells you of the part he took in 1805, in\r\nthe capture of two French frigates, and some of the latent fire returns as\r\nhe speaks of it; for it was a fight that lasted three days and nights\r\nbefore victory was fairly ours.\r\n\r\nTake the wards _en masse_, and we see peering out of the medley the\r\ndelicate sallow skin and long black hair of the Greek, who is estimated by\r\nevery British commander at seventy‐five per cent. below the English tar in\r\nhauling power and endurance, while the South Sea Islander, the\r\nScandinavian, the dusky Turk, Danes, Swedes, and Norwegians, Spaniards,\r\nAmericans, Chinamen, are here side by side with the hardy sons of our own\r\nisles. In one corridor there is even a Fantee, with the mark of his tribe\r\nupon his ebon‐hued forehead, but minus feet, having lost them through\r\ntheir being frost‐bitten in the Black Sea. Another and more painful case\r\nis that of a poor fellow wrecked off Cape Horn, who, drifting for fourteen\r\ndays in an open boat, reached shore only to find that he must purchase\r\nlife at the cost of both nether limbs. The surgical operator was an\r\nunskilled sailor, the instrument a rough ship’s knife, with which he\r\nsucceeded in performing successfully the dangerous operation, but with\r\nwhat torture to the sufferer can too vividly be imagined. He is cheerful\r\nenough now as he potters about on his stumps, full of dry humour and as\r\ncheerful as any able‐bodied man could be. The light occupations of these\r\ndisabled sons of the sea are varied and congenial to their different\r\ntastes, and their labour is chiefly confined to decorating the wards of\r\nthe hospital. Amongst the many inscriptions are a beautiful white wreath\r\nwith “Albert the Good” on it, and Nelson’s famous last signal. One German\r\nsailor lad has entirely decorated one ward with a taste and elegance\r\nsimply surprising. This boy is an original, seeing that he went all the\r\nway to Jerusalem to learn English! “In Hamburg, his native place, he heard\r\nother boys, and occasionally travellers, say that there was a good school\r\nthere where English was taught. Thereupon, seizing his opportunity, he\r\nworked his passage from Hamburg to Alexandria, took ship to Jaffa, and\r\ninduced the German Consul to forward him to the Holy City.” Evidently he\r\ndid not think there was anything remarkable in this singular method of\r\nacquiring our language!(83)\r\n\r\nThe Thames Church Mission is a society established to minister to the\r\nspiritual necessities of the vast fluctuating population of the Thames,\r\nconsisting of seamen, bargemen, steamboat‐men, fishermen, &c. Services are\r\nheld on board troop, emigrant, and passenger ships, screw colliers, and\r\nevery description of vessels; also in the mission and reading‐room which\r\nhas been opened for seamen, &c., by the bank of the river at Bugsby, near\r\nEast Greenwich. Bibles, Testaments, and Prayer‐books are sold at reduced\r\nprices, and tracts distributed. A chaplain (licensed by the Bishop of\r\nLondon to visit ministerially and officiate on board all ships and vessels\r\non the Thames), four missionaries, and five seamen colporteurs, constitute\r\nthe missionary staff. The Mission undertakes the sale of Scriptures to\r\nEnglish and foreign seamen, and gives Testaments to emigrants on behalf of\r\nthe British and Foreign Bible Society; it places on board emigrant ships\r\npackets of tracts, and distributes the cards and circulars of the Sailor’s\r\nHome among seamen arriving in the Thames. The field of operation extends\r\nfrom London Bridge to the anchorages below Gravesend. The chaplain also\r\nholds Sabbath services on board the training ships _Arethusa_,\r\n_Chichester_, and _Cornwall_, and has weekly classes with the boys; and\r\nthe missionaries act as honorary agents for enrolling members of the\r\nShipwrecked Mariners’ Society. There are many other excellent institutions\r\nfor the seamen’s benefit, from London city to Gravesend town, but which\r\ncannot be described with the space at our command.\r\n\r\nEvery reader knows the Trinity House, but he may not be aware of its value\r\nto the seaman, the voyager, and the interests of commerce. The Trinity\r\nHouse, as it stands on Tower Hill, was built towards the end of the last\r\ncentury by Samuel Wyatt. It is of the Ionic order, and has some busts of\r\nnaval heroes, whose deeds, like themselves, are of the past. Amongst its\r\nmany interesting pictures is a very large Gainsborough, representing the\r\nTrinity Board of that day. This picture, by the way, is upwards of twenty\r\nfeet in length, and, if merit go by measurement, is necessarily a very\r\ngreat picture. The Board of Trinity House has control of the beaconage and\r\npilotage of the United Kingdom. The Corporation existed fully one hundred\r\nyears before its original charter, which was granted in 1514, and was at\r\nthat early date known simply as the “Shipmen and Mariners of England”—a\r\nvoluntary and influential association of some standing, and at that time\r\nprotected maritime interests and gave substantial relief to the aged and\r\nindigent of the seafaring community.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: TRINITY HOUSE, LONDON.]\r\n\r\nHenry VIII. was the first king who granted it a Royal Charter, in 1514, in\r\nrecognition of its well‐tried merit. In this charter it is described as\r\nthe “Guild or Fraternity of the most glorious and undividable Trinity of\r\nSt. Clement.” The Charter of James I. and all subsequent charters are\r\ngranted to “The Master, Wardens, and Assistants of the Guild, Fraternity,\r\nor Brotherhood of the most glorious and undivided Trinity of St. Clement,\r\nin the parish of Deptford, in the county of Kent.” The motto of the\r\nCorporation is _Trinitas in unitate_. The Elder Brethren of Trinity House\r\nare not always exempt from undertaking stern and unpleasant duties afloat,\r\nas was instanced in that terrible time of trial—the mutiny of the Nore, in\r\n1799, when they destroyed or removed every beacon and buoy that could\r\nguide the mutinous fleet out to sea. Its culminating recognition was by an\r\nAct of Parliament in 1836. The honorary members of this Court are men of\r\ndistinction, including some of the members of the Royal Family. H.R.H. the\r\nDuke of Edinburgh became its Master in 1866. The duties of the Corporation\r\nare described in their charter as follows:—\r\n\r\n“To treat and conclude upon all and singular articles anywise concerning\r\nthe science or art of marines; to maintain in perfect working order all\r\nthe lighthouses, floating‐lights, and fog‐signal stations on the coast of\r\nEngland, and to lay down, maintain, renew, and modify all the buoys,\r\nbeacons, and sea‐signals; to regulate the supply of stores, the\r\nappointment of keepers, and constantly to inspect the stations; to examine\r\nand license pilots for a large portion of our coasts, and to investigate\r\ngenerally into all matters of pilotage; to act as nautical advisers with\r\nthe judge of the High Court of Admiralty: to survey and inspect the\r\nchannels of the Thames and the shoals of the North Sea, and other points\r\nof the coast at which shifting, scouring, growth, or waste of sand may\r\naffect the navigation, and require to be watched and notified; to supply\r\nshipping in the Thames with ballast. The Elder Brethren have also to\r\nperform the duty of accompanying the Sovereign on sea voyages.”\r\n\r\nThe light‐vessels of the Corporation are nearly fifty in number, while\r\nthere are more than eighty lighthouses. The buoys on our coasts must not\r\nbe omitted. The number in position can scarcely be approximated, while in\r\naddition—in case of casualties—there must be kept in reserve fully one‐\r\nhalf the number in position. There are also some sixty odd beacons of\r\ndifferent kinds. The working staff of the Trinity House is composed of\r\ndistrict superintendents, buoy‐keepers, store‐keepers, local agents,\r\nlighthouse‐keepers, crews of floating‐lights, watchmen, fog‐signal\r\nattendants,(84) crews of steam and sailing vessels, altogether making a\r\ntotal of nearly a thousand men.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: THE SIREN FOG‐HORN, FOR WARNING SHIPS OFF THE COAST.]\r\n\r\nIn 1837 the Duke of Wellington was Master of the Trinity House; in 1852\r\nPrince Albert held that office, and Viscount Palmerston in 1862. Then came\r\n(1866), as already mentioned, the Duke of Edinburgh, while the Prince of\r\nWales headed the list of a long roll of Brethren, to say nothing of the\r\nnumerous dukes and earls who have gladly accepted the same honour. The\r\nTrinity House Corporation has successfully withstood several most\r\nsearching Parliamentary investigations, only to come out with triumphantly\r\nflying colours, which added to the confidence generally reposed in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n        WHAT POETS HAVE SUNG OF THE SEA, THE SAILOR, AND THE SHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Poet of the Sea still Wanting—Biblical Allusions—The Classical\r\n         Writers—Want of True Sympathy with the Subject—Virgil’s\r\n         “Æneid”—His Stage Storms—The Immortal Bard—His Intimate\r\n       Acquaintance with the Sea and the Sailor—The Golden Days of\r\n     Maritime Enterprise—The _Tempest_—Miranda’s Compassion—Pranks of\r\n    the “Airy Spirit”—The _Merchant of Venice_—Piracy in Shakespeare’s\r\n     Days—A Birth at Sea—_Cymbeline_: the Queen’s Description of our\r\n        Isle—Byron’s “Ocean”—Falconer’s “Shipwreck”—His Technical\r\n     Knowledge—The “True Ring”—The Dibdins—“Tom Bowling”—“The Boatmen\r\n     of the Downs”—Three Touching Poems—Mrs. Hemans, Longfellow, and\r\n       Kingsley—Browning’s “Hervé Riel”—The True Breton Pilot—A New\r\n    Departure—Hood’s “Demon Ship”—Popular Songs of the Day—Conclusion.\r\n\r\n      “I love the sea; she is my fellow‐creature,\r\n        My careful purveyor—she provides me store;\r\n      She walls me round, she makes my diet greater,\r\n        She wafts me treasures from a foreign shore.”(85)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sea, the sailor, and the ship, have been fertile subjects for the\r\npoets, although countries and lands, and those who dwell therein, have\r\noccupied by far the larger part of their attention. Sooth to say, however,\r\nthere has not yet arisen a single _great_ writer whose name could fairly\r\nbe identified with the ocean as its own particular poet. There may be\r\nreasons for this. The poet is usually of delicate organisation, and is\r\nmore likely to be found studying Nature on the quiet shore than on the\r\nturbulent ocean. Maybe he is practically a recluse, accessible to a few\r\nonly; and if of social nature, and not averse to companionship amid the\r\nbusy haunts of men, he yet shrinks from the roughness usual to, though not\r\ninseparable from, the men of the sea. The modern facilities of travel,\r\nenabling the student to con Nature with comparative ease, may some day aid\r\nin producing a representative poet of the sea. At present the position is\r\nvacant.\r\n\r\nIn days of old, however, the poet prophets, David the sweet singer of\r\nIsrael, and one or two writers in the New Testament, gave glimpses of the\r\nocean which indicated an acquaintance with the subject. Nothing can well\r\nbe finer than the Psalmist’s conception of the mariner’s life and its\r\ndangers in the lines commencing:—\r\n\r\n“They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;\r\n\r\n“These see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep.”\r\n\r\nThe prophet Jeremiah draws a beautiful though pathetic picture of the\r\nocean’s unrest when he says: “There is sorrow on the sea, it cannot be\r\nquiet;” and the serious poets have followed his outlines. Milton describes\r\none—\r\n\r\n  “In a troubled sea of passion tossed.”\r\n\r\nMichelet defines its “many voices,” its murmur and its menace, its thunder\r\nand its roar, its wail, its sigh, its “sublime duets with the rocks.”\r\n\r\nThe classical writers of antiquity had little sympathy with the sea. We\r\nhave seen Horace’s opinion of that man’s boldness who first trusted\r\nhimself in a frail vessel on the merciless ocean; and, as Dryden shows us,\r\nthere was good reason for a general dread of the sea, at least on the part\r\nof landsmen—\r\n\r\n  “Rude as their ships was navigation then,\r\n    No useful compass or meridian known;\r\n  Coasting, they kept the land within their ken,\r\n    And knew no north but when the pole‐star shone.”\r\n\r\nVirgil’s “Æneid” is essentially a sea‐poem, yet a writer of critical\r\nacumen considers that “in literature the sea is all the worse for Virgil\r\nhaving dealt with it.... The poem, as nobody needs telling, begins its\r\nevents with a tremendous sea‐piece. In the very first sight we get of the\r\nhero and his companions they are dividing the foaming brine with their\r\nkeels, and the initial incident is a shipwreck. The description assuredly\r\nhas overwhelming vigour in it...; an impression of unusual turmoil is\r\ngiven, and that is what Virgil sought, but it is got by a jumble of\r\nviolence of every kind. Winds, billows, lightning, thunder, reefs,\r\nshallows, eddies, are mixed together. The only detail of disaster left out\r\nis collision among the ships, which with a fleet so crowded is the one\r\nthing that would have occurred had this been a natural storm. Such a\r\ntempest now rages in a transpontine theatre, and in no other part of the\r\nworld; it takes Neptune himself to still it in the ‘Æneid.’”(86) And yet\r\nVirgil lived long by the glorious Bay of Naples; and the famous ode of\r\nHorace, praying that he might have fair weather, shows that he had made at\r\nleast one voyage.\r\n\r\nIf a poet has a genuine feeling for his subject, the lightest epithets he\r\napplies may tell a story. What terms does Virgil employ? They are somewhat\r\ncommonplace. Boundless, mighty, swelling, windy, faithless, deep, dark,\r\nblue, azure, vast, foaming, salt, and so forth, are well enough, but they\r\ndo not compare with many of Shakespeare’s, and later poets. Take three of\r\nShakespeare’s: the “yeasty” waves, the “multitudinous” sea, and the\r\n“wasteful” ocean. These epithets are in themselves admirable descriptions.\r\n\r\nThe works of our immortal bard are full of allusions to the sea, and show\r\nan intimate acquaintance therewith. Perhaps Shakespeare’s knowledge is in\r\nthis instance less surprising than in some other directions, for although\r\nwe have no proof that he ever left the shores of old England, and are\r\nquite certain that he never ventured far, his was a golden day in the\r\nhistory of maritime enterprise. The reign of the Virgin Queen, during the\r\nlarger part of which he flourished, saw the defeat of the Armada, and many\r\nanother repulse in the Spanish colonies. It was the day of such naval\r\nheroes as Howard of Effingham, Drake and Hawkins, Raleigh and Frobisher.\r\nIt witnessed the first English voyage round the world, the discovery of\r\nVirginia—to say nothing of Virginia’s tobacco and potatoes—the\r\nestablishment of the profitable whale fishery and the disgraceful slave‐\r\ntrade, the inauguration of that long‐time monopoly the East India Company,\r\nand numerous lesser developments in commercial prosperity.\r\n\r\nAppropriately, then, the play of Shakespeare which more particularly than\r\nany other deals with the sea is that which is generally placed at the\r\ncommencement of the series in the published editions. The _Tempest_ opens\r\nwith a storm “on a ship at sea.” The fury of the gale increases, and the\r\nvessel is nearly on the rocks. “We split! we split! we split!” sings out\r\nthe honest old Neapolitan councillor, Gonzalo, adding—\r\n\r\n  “Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren\r\n              ground,\r\n  Long heath, brown furze, anything. The wills above be done! but I\r\n  Would fain die a dry death.”\r\n\r\n                        [Illustration: THE STORM.]\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: AFTER THE STORM.]\r\n\r\nBut neither he nor his master the king suffers death by shipwreck, for\r\namiable and tender‐hearted Miranda intercedes with her father. Prospero\r\nreassures her, though Ariel, it will be remembered, had been playing many\r\na prank on the unsuspecting mariners, and with lightning and thunder‐claps\r\nand “sulphurous roaring,” had fairly frightened them out of their wits.\r\nAll but the mariners had “plunged in the foaming brine and quitted the\r\nvessel”:—\r\n\r\n  “The king’s son have I landed by himself,\r\n  Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs,\r\n  In an odd angle of the isle,”\r\n\r\nSings the “airy spirit,” adding, however—\r\n\r\n          “Safely in harbour\r\n  Is the king’s ship in the deep nook; where once\r\n  Thou call’st me up at midnight, to fetch dew\r\n  From the still vexed Bermoothes,(87) there she’s hid:\r\n  The mariners all under hatches stowed.”\r\n\r\nAnd so with the kindly spirit and the rightful Duke we may leave the\r\ntempest‐tossed mariners.\r\n\r\nIn the _Merchant of Venice_ we have admirable illustrations of the\r\ntroubles and anxieties of a merchant shipowner of the day. Antonio is sad.\r\n“Your mind,” says Salarino, “is tossing on the ocean.” Antonio’s friends\r\ncontinue:—\r\n\r\n  “_Salanio._ Believe me, sir, had I such ventures forth,\r\n  The better part of my affections would\r\n  Be with my hopes abroad * * *\r\n\r\n  _Salarino._      My wind, cooling my breath,\r\n  Would blow me to an ague, when I thought\r\n  What harm a wind too great might do at sea.\r\n  I should not see the sandy hour‐glass run,\r\n  But I should think of shallows and of flats;\r\n  And see my wealthy Andrew dock’d in sand,\r\n  Vailing her high‐top lower than her ribs,\r\n  To kiss her burial. Should I go to church,\r\n  And see the holy edifice of stone,\r\n  And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,\r\n  Which, touching but my gentle vessel’s side,\r\n  Would scatter all the spices on the stream;\r\n  Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks;\r\n  And, in a word, but even now worth this,\r\n  And now worth nothing?”\r\n\r\nSo Shylock, though ready to advance the three thousand ducats to Bassanio\r\non Antonio’s bond, doubts whether the ships bound to Tripolis, the Indies,\r\nMexico, and England, may not come to grief. For “ships are but boards,\r\nsailors but men; there be land‐rats and water‐rats, land‐thieves and\r\nwater‐thieves—I mean pirates; and then, there is the peril of waters,\r\nwinds, and rocks.” Soon after it was spread on the Rialto that Antonio had\r\n“a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas; the Goodwins, I think,”\r\nsays his friend, “they call the place; a very dangerous flat, and fatal,\r\nwhere the carcases of many a tall ship lie buried;” and this was followed\r\nby the news that not one of his vessels had escaped\r\n\r\n      “The dreadful touch\r\n  Of merchant‐marring rocks.”\r\n\r\nAll, however, ends happily, and the argosies, richly laden, arrive in\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nPiracy on the high seas in Shakespeare’s days may be said to have been of\r\ntwo kinds: that which was practically legalised, for purposes of reprisal\r\non foreign foes, and that which was for private and individual plunder.\r\nHow prevalent it was may be gathered from the passages indicated\r\nbelow.(88)\r\n\r\nIn _Measure for Measure_ we find the freebooter’s calling satirised in the\r\ncomparison: “like the sanctimonious pirate that went to sea with the Ten\r\nCommandments, but scraped one out of the table”—that one, of course,\r\nbeing, “Thou shalt not steal.” Their reckless life is literally described\r\nby Richard Plantagenet in the Second Part of _King Henry VI._, where he\r\nsays—\r\n\r\n  “Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage,\r\n  And purchase friends, and give to courtezans,\r\n  Still revelling, like lords, till all be gone”—\r\n\r\nwhile Suffolk dies by pirates later on. In the same historical play King\r\nHenry again describes his condition, harassed by the rebel Jack Cade and\r\nthe troublesome Duke of York, as\r\n\r\n  “Like to a ship, that having ’scaped a tempest,\r\n  Is straightway calmed and boarded with a pirate.”\r\n\r\nQueen Margaret in _Richard III._ addresses three noble lords as\r\n\r\n        “Ye wrangling pirates, that fall out\r\n  In sharing that which you have pill’d(89) from me.”\r\n\r\nIn _Pericles_ Shakespeare introduces the not uncommon episode of a birth\r\nat sea, which occurs in a terrible gale, the mother apparently dying\r\nimmediately afterwards, to be later cast into the sea in a chest, and\r\nrevive when thrown upon the shore.\r\n\r\nAnd for our last Shakespearian quotation, in _Cymbeline_ we have a fine\r\ndescription of our own little island and its impregnability. “Remember,”\r\nsays the Queen—\r\n\r\n  “The natural bravery of your isle, which stands\r\n  As Neptune’s park, ribbed and paled in\r\n  With rocks unscaleable and roaring waters;\r\n  With sands that will not bear your enemies’ boats,\r\n  But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest\r\n  Cæsar made here; but made not here his brag\r\n  Of _came_, and _saw_, and _overcame_: with shame\r\n  (The first that ever touched him), he was carried\r\n  From off our coast twice beaten; and his shipping\r\n  (Poor ignorant baubles!) on our terrible seas,\r\n  Like egg‐shells moved upon their surges, cracked\r\n  As easily ’gainst our rocks; for joy whereof,\r\n  The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point\r\n  (O giglot(90) fortune!) to master Cæsar’s sword,\r\n  Made Lud’s town with rejoicing fires bright,\r\n  And Britons strut with courage.”\r\n\r\nNext to Shakespeare in intimate knowledge and power to portray, Byron must\r\nbe placed. What can be grander than his well‐known apostrophe to the\r\nOcean?—\r\n\r\n    “Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean—roll!\r\n    Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;\r\n    Man marks the earth with ruin—his control\r\n    Stops with the shore;—upon the watery plain,\r\n    The wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remain\r\n    A shadow of man’s ravage, save his own,\r\n    When, for a moment, like a drop of rain,\r\n    He sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan,\r\n  Without a grave, unknelled, uncoffined, and unknown.\r\n  *     *     *     *     *\r\n    “Thy shores are empires, changed in all save thee—\r\n    Assyria, Greece, Rome, Carthage, what are they?\r\n    Thy waters washed them power while they were free,\r\n    And many a tyrant since; their shores obey\r\n    The stranger, slave, or savage; their decay\r\n    Has dried up realms to deserts:—not so thou;—\r\n    Unchangeable save to thy wild waves’ play—\r\n    Time writes no wrinkle on thine azure brow—\r\n  Such as creation’s dawn beheld, thou rollest now.”\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration:\r\n\r\n  “HE SINKS INTO THY DEPTHS WITH BUBBLING GROAN,\r\n  WITHOUT A GRAVE, UNKNELLED, UNCOFFINED, AND UNKNOWN.”]\r\n\r\nThe poet _par excellence_ of the sea, partly on account of the literary\r\nmerits of his production, but more by reason of his technical correctness,\r\nwas William Falconer, the author of “The Shipwreck,” on the title pages of\r\nall the older editions of which he is described simply as “a sailor.” His\r\npoem, which is in three cantos, was founded on actual incidents in a\r\nshipwreck from which himself and but two or three of the crew were saved.\r\nAgain, in 1769 he embarked on board the _Aurora_ frigate on a venture to\r\nthe East Indies, but from the time the ship left the Cape of Good Hope no\r\ninformation was ever received of her, and she is believed to have\r\nfoundered with all hands, including the poet. Falconer, although a\r\ndisciple of the Muse, wrote a political satire, entitled, “The Demagogue;”\r\nwhile his Marine Dictionary is, in its revised form, a recognised\r\nauthority to‐day. The poem on which his fame rests is remarkable for the\r\nabsolute correctness of its details. Take, for example, the following\r\npassage, which could not have been written by a landsman‐poet:—\r\n\r\n  “A squall, deep lowering, blots the southern sky,\r\n  Before whose boisterous breath the waters fly.\r\n  Its weight the topsails can no more sustain—\r\n  Reef topsails, reef! the boatswain calls again!\r\n  The haliards and top‐bow‐lines soon are gone;\r\n  To clue‐lines and reef‐tackles next they run:\r\n  The shivering sails descend; and now they square\r\n  The yards, while ready sailors mount in air.\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n  “Deep on her side the reeling vessel lies—\r\n  ‘Brail up the mizzen, quick!’ the master cries,\r\n  ’Man the clue‐garnets! let the main‐sheet fly!’\r\n  The boisterous squall still presses from on high,\r\n  And swift and fatal as the lightning’s course\r\n  Thro’ the torn main‐sail bursts with thundering force.”\r\n\r\nAnd so forth. The fact is, that most readers of Falconer’s poem require\r\nhis “Dictionary of the Marine” at hand, or some old “salt” to explain the\r\nconstantly recurring nautical terms.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: “DEEP ON HER SIDE THE REELING VESSEL LIES.”]\r\n\r\nIt is not wonderful that so many of our poets have written more or less\r\nconcerning the sea, few passing over the grand subject entirely, when we\r\nconsider England’s paramount position on and interests in it. A number of\r\nthem have produced works in which we seem to sniff the briny ocean as we\r\nread them, while only a minority have written artificially and without a\r\ntrue feeling for their subject. Much that the Dibdins(91) indited for the\r\nconcert‐room, the theatre, and to an extent for the sailor himself, is of\r\na trivial nature, dealing largely—too largely—with grog and sweethearts,\r\nand more than occasionally verging on the coarse and indelicate. But among\r\ntheir productions are songs with the true ring, ballads that will never\r\ndie while our language lasts or Britain “rules the waves.” Among these may\r\nfairly be counted Charles Dibdin’s “Poor Jack,” “The Greenwich Pensioner”\r\n(“’Twas in the good ship _Rover_”), “The Sailor’s Journal” (“’Twas post‐\r\nmeridian, half‐past four”), and, above all, that noble picture of a true\r\nsailor, “Tom Bowling”—\r\n\r\n  “Tom never from his word departed,\r\n    His virtues were so rare;\r\n  His friends were many and true‐hearted,\r\n    His Poll was kind and fair:\r\n  And then he’d sing so blithe and jolly,\r\n    Ah! many’s the time and oft;\r\n  But mirth is turned to melancholy,\r\n    For Tom is gone aloft.\r\n\r\n  “Yet shall poor Tom find pleasant weather\r\n    When He who all commands\r\n  Shall give, to call life’s crew together,\r\n    The word to pipe all hands.\r\n  Thus death, who kings and tars despatches,\r\n    In vain Tom’s life has doffed;\r\n  For though his body’s under hatches\r\n    His soul is gone aloft.”\r\n\r\nEliza Cook(92) has followed the same vein in her “Gallant English Tar,”\r\nand has also paid a worthy tribute to those hardy sons of Neptune, “The\r\nBoatmen of the Downs.”\r\n\r\n  “There’s fury in the tempest, and there’s madness in the waves,\r\n  The lightning snake coils round the foam, the headlong thunder raves;\r\n  Yet a boat is on the waters filled with Britain’s daring sons,\r\n  Who pull like lions out to sea, and count the minute guns.\r\n  ’Tis mercy calls them to the work—a ship is in distress!\r\n  Away they speed with timely help that many a heart shall bless;\r\n  And braver deeds than ever turned the fate of kings and crowns\r\n  Are done for England’s glory by her boatmen of the Downs!”\r\n\r\nPerhaps no modern verses are more popular with all lovers of true poetry\r\nthan the “Casabianca” of Mrs. Hemans, Longfellow’s “Wreck of the\r\n_Hesperus_,” and Kingsley’s “Three Fishers;” and no wonder, for they touch\r\na chord in every heart, while vividly portraying the perils of a seafaring\r\nlife. In the story of the “burning deck” we have the record of a true\r\nsailor boy, who would not desert his “lone post of death.” And—\r\n\r\n  “The noblest thing that perished there\r\n    Was that young faithful heart!”\r\n\r\nIn the second‐named poem the skipper has taken his little daughter to\r\n“bear him company.” A hurricane rises, and it is the poor frightened child\r\nwho alone hears the “fog‐bell on a rock‐bound coast.” She runs to her\r\nfather:—\r\n\r\n  “But the father answered never a word,\r\n    A frozen corpse was he.”\r\n\r\nThe ship drifts into the breakers and on the cruel rocks.\r\n\r\n  “At daybreak, on the bleak sea beach,\r\n    A fisherman stood aghast,\r\n  To see the form of a maiden fair\r\n    Lashed close to a drifting mast.\r\n\r\n  “The salt sea was frozen on her breast,\r\n    The salt tears in her eyes;\r\n  And he saw her hair, like the brown sea‐weed,\r\n    On the billows fall and rise.\r\n\r\n  “Such was the wreck of the _Hesperus_,\r\n    In the midnight and the snow;\r\n  Christ save us all from a death like this,\r\n    On the reef of Norman’s Woe!”\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: “AT DAYBREAK, ON THE BLEAK SEA BEACH,\r\n                       A FISHERMAN STOOD AGHAST.”]\r\n\r\nIn Kingsley’s poem, “three fishermen sailed away to the West,” thinking of\r\ntheir much‐loved home; “three wives sat weeping in the lighthouse tower.”\r\n\r\n  “Three corses lay out on the shining sands\r\n  In the morning gleam as the tide went down,\r\n  And the women are weeping and wringing their hands\r\n  For those who will never come home to the town;\r\n  For men must work and women must weep,\r\n  And the sooner it’s over the sooner to sleep;\r\n    And good‐bye to the bar and its moaning.”\r\n\r\n        [Illustration: “THREE FISHERMEN SAILED AWAY TO THE WEST.”]\r\n\r\nNo more splendid tribute has ever been paid to a neglected hero than that\r\nwhich appeared in the pages of a popular monthly(93) some years since,\r\nover the honoured signature of Robert Browning.\r\n\r\nThe year 1692 was specially disastrous to France, and a fleet of twenty‐\r\ntwo vessels were hotly and closely pursued by the English. The squadron\r\ncame helter‐skelter, “like a crowd of frightened porpoises” with the\r\nsharks after them, to St. Malo on the Rance. The pilots who were on board\r\nlaughed at the bare idea of their great ships entering the rocky passage;\r\nand Damfreville, the admiral of the fleet, was seriously thinking of\r\nblowing up or burning all his ships, when out stepped in front of all the\r\nassembled officers a poor coasting‐pilot.\r\n\r\n“Are you mad, you Malouins? are you cowards, fools, or rogues?” said he,\r\nas he hurriedly and impetuously assured the admiral that he knew every\r\nrock and shoal, and could lead the fleet in safely.\r\n\r\n  “‘Sirs, they know I speak the truth! Sirs, believe me there’s a way!\r\n    And if one ship misbehave—\r\n    Keel so much as grate the ground,\r\n  Why, I’ve nothing but my life—here’s my head!’ cries Hervé Riel.\r\n\r\n  “Not a minute more to wait,\r\n  ‘Steer us in, then, small and great!\r\n    Take the helm, lead the line, save the squadron!’ cried its chief.\r\n  ‘Captains, give the sailor place!\r\n    He is admiral, in brief.’\r\n  Still the north wind, by God’s grace.\r\n  See the noble fellow’s face\r\n  As the big ship, with a bound,\r\n  Clears the entry like a hound,\r\n  Keeps the passage as its inch of way were the wide seas profound!\r\n  See, safe through shoal and rock,\r\n    How they follow in a flock.\r\n  Not a ship that misbehaves, not a keel that grates the ground,\r\n    Not a spar that comes to grief!\r\n  The peril, see, is past,\r\n  All are harboured to the last,\r\n  And just as Hervé Riel hollas ‘Anchor!’—sure as fate,\r\n  Up the English come, too late.”\r\n\r\nSo all are saved, and the crews see longingly the green heights above\r\nGrève, all bursting out, with one accord—\r\n\r\n  “‘Let France, let France’s King\r\n  Thank the man that did the thing!’\r\n  What a shout, and all one word,\r\n    ‘Hervé Riel,’\r\n  As he stepped in front once more,\r\n    Not a symptom of surprise\r\n    In the frank blue Breton eyes,\r\n  Just the same man as before.\r\n\r\n  “Then said Damfreville, ‘My friend,\r\n    I must speak out at the end,\r\n    Though I find the speaking hard:\r\n  Praise is deeper than the lips:\r\n  You have saved the King his ships,\r\n    You must name your own reward.\r\n  ’Faith, our sun was near eclipse!\r\n  Demand whate’er you will,\r\n  France remains your debtor still.\r\n  Ask to heart’s content and have! or my name’s not Damfreville.’\r\n\r\n  “Then a beam of fun outbroke\r\n  On the bearded mouth that spoke,\r\n  As the honest heart laughed through\r\n  Those frank eyes of Breton blue:\r\n    ‘Since I needs must say my say,\r\n  Since on board the duty’s done—\r\n  And from Malo Roads to Croisie Point what is it but a run?\r\n\r\n  “‘Since ’tis ask and have, I may—\r\n  Since the others go ashore—\r\n    Come! a good whole holiday!\r\n  Leave to go and see my wife, whom I call the Belle Aurore!’\r\n  That he asked and that he got—nothing more.”\r\n\r\nTurn we now to a “new departure” in sea poetry, one partially inaugurated\r\nby the Dibdins, carried on by Tom Hood the elder, and having of late years\r\nWilliam Schwenck Gilbert for its principal exponent. It is often as full\r\nof nature as the serious productions of other poets, yet itself favours\r\nthe ludicrous and satirical side. Hood’s “Demon Ship” is a fair example—\r\n\r\n  “Down went my helm—close‐reefed—the tack held freely in my hand—\r\n  With ballast snug—I put about, and scudded for the land.\r\n  Loud hissed the sea beneath her lee; my little boat flew fast,\r\n  But faster still the rushing storm came borne upon the blast.\r\n  Lord! what a roaring hurricane beset the straining sail!\r\n  What furious sleet, with level drift, and fierce assaults of hail!\r\n  What darksome caverns yawned before! what jagged steeps behind!\r\n  Like battle steeds with foamy manes wild tossing in the wind.\r\n  Each after each sank down astern, exhausted in the chase,\r\n  But where it sank another rose, and galloped in its place;\r\n  As black as night—they turned to white, and cast against the cloud\r\n  A snowy sheet, as if each surge upturned a sailor’s shroud:\r\n  Still flew my boat; alas! alas! her course was nearly run.\r\n  Behold yon fatal billow rise—ten billows heaped in one.\r\n  With fearful speed the dreary mass came rolling, rolling fast,\r\n  As if the scooping sea contained one only wave at last.\r\n  Still on it came, with horrid roar, a swift pursuing grave;\r\n  It seemed as though some cloud had turned its hugeness to a wave.\r\n  Its briny sleet began to beat beforehand in my face—\r\n  I felt the rearward keel begin to climb its swelling base!\r\n  I saw its alpine hoary head impending over mine.\r\n  Another pulse—and down it rushed, an avalanche of brine!\r\n  Brief pause had I on God to cry, or think of wife and home;\r\n  The waters closed, and when I shrieked, I shrieked below the foam!”\r\n\r\nAfter battling with the water, and half insensible, he finds himself at\r\nlast safely on board a strange vessel; a terrible face haunts him—black,\r\ngrimly black, all black, except the grinning teeth. The sooty crew were\r\nlike their master. “Where am I? in what dreadful ship?” cried he, in\r\nterrified agony. The answer was a laugh that rang from stem to stern from\r\nthe gloomy shapes that flitted round. They guffawed and grinned and choked\r\nto the top of their bent—\r\n\r\n          “And then the chief made answer for the whole:—\r\n  ‘Our skins,’ said he ‘are black, because we carry coal.\r\n  You’ll find your mother, sure enough, and see your native fields,\r\n  For this here ship has picked you up—the _Mary Anne_ of Shields.’”\r\n\r\nThe transition from the really powerful and dramatic description of the\r\nbillows and surf to the ridiculous _dénouement_ is irresistibly and\r\nartistically comic. Hood’s purely amusing pieces are more generally known\r\nthan the above. Take as an example “Faithless Sally Brown;” the girl who\r\nso soon forgot her first Ben is modelled on Dibdinian lines, but the\r\ntouches of humour are infinitely more delicate.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of a class of sea‐songs which can now be heard from the\r\nstreets to the drawing‐room, and from the fo’castle to the ward‐room, is\r\ncreditable to our age. Some of these productions, in which noble\r\nsentiments, expressed in simple and feeling words, are wedded to effective\r\nand artistic music, help to keep alive humanity, love, and honour in the\r\nrising generation. “The poor old slave is free” directly he climbs the\r\nBritish ship; “the sailor’s wife the sailor’s star should be,” and usually\r\nis; while the story of the poor little wounded “midshipmite” is as\r\ntouching in its way as the boy who would not leave the burning deck.\r\n\r\n                          ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐‐\r\n\r\nOur voyages are ended; and we may now peacefully peruse, by the cosy\r\nfireside, the record of the heroic deeds and the startling perils of the\r\nsailor’s career while he is engaged in bringing to our shores the\r\nnecessaries and comforts of our daily life. While we stay at home in ease,\r\nlet us not forget this noble army of “conscripts, fighting our battles for\r\nus;” and when the tempests howl and the lightnings flash, let us breathe\r\nour heartfelt earnest prayers “for those at sea.”\r\n\r\n  “Eternal Father, strong to save,\r\n  Whose arm hath bound the restless wave,\r\n  Who bids’t the mighty ocean deep,\r\n  Its own appointed limits keep;\r\n    Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee,\r\n    For those in peril on the sea.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              GENERAL INDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The names of the Ships in the British Navy are printed in Italics.

In seven minutes\r\n      after the first flames were discovered the ship from stem to stern\r\n      was one sheet of flame. At the last moment the captain, terribly\r\n      burnt, threw himself in the water and was rescued. Three Europeans\r\n      and sixty Chinamen were either burnt to death or drowned. The\r\n      Chinese, determined not to lose their savings, dawdled a little, and\r\n      then threw themselves all together on a ladder, which broke with\r\n      their weight. The gold found on their corpses proved that not one\r\n      had returned poor from California.

The tinned meat and extract works employ a large number\r\n      of hands at good wages.\r\n\r\n   24 Let the reader compare the following verses of Genesis:—“In the six\r\n      hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth\r\n      day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great\r\n      deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.”—Chap. vii.,\r\n      verse 11.\r\n      “And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the\r\n      first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up\r\n      from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the ark, and\r\n      looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.\r\n      “And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the\r\n      month, was the earth dried.”—Chap. viii., verses 13 and 14.\r\n\r\n   25 Vol. III., First Series, page 509.\r\n\r\n   26 This chapter is based on the works of Tennant, Darwin, Gosse,\r\n      Figuier, and other authorities.\r\n\r\n   27 About £48,000.\r\n\r\n   28 In “The Origin of Species.”\r\n\r\n   29 The bulk of this chapter is derived from the following works:—“The\r\n      Conquest of the Sea,” Siebe; “English Seamen and Divers,” M.\r\n      Esquiros; an Article in “The Shipwrecked Mariner,” Vol. XXII.; &c.\r\n\r\n   30 “Tales of Mystery and Imagination.”\r\n\r\n   31 This account is mainly derived from the “History of the Atlantic\r\n      Telegraph,” by Dr. Henry M. Field; “The Story of Cyrus Field;” and\r\n      Dr. Russell’s letters in the _Times_.\r\n\r\n   32 Leblond: “Voyage aux Antilles.”\r\n\r\n   33 “A Year by the Sea‐side.”\r\n\r\n   34 “La Mer.”\r\n\r\n   35 The popular idea regarding the necessity for the letter _r_ in the\r\n      open months for oyster‐eating is tolerably correct in Europe, but\r\n      will not apply to all parts of the world.\r\n\r\n   36 The varied information concerning the oyster contained in this\r\n      chapter is mainly derived from Bertram’s “Harvest of the Sea”;\r\n      Figuier’s “Ocean World”; and from an interesting little _brochure_\r\n      entitled “The Oyster, Where, How, and When to Find;” &c.\r\n\r\n   37 The ancients masticated their oysters, and did not bolt or gulp them\r\n      down. Many distinguished modern authorities agree with them. Dr.\r\n      Kitchiner says it must be eaten alive. “The true lover of an\r\n      oyster,” says he, “will have some regard for the feelings of his\r\n      little favourite, and contrive to detach the fish from the shell so\r\n      dexterously that the oyster is hardly conscious he has been ejected\r\n      from his lodging till he _feels the teeth_ of the piscivorous\r\n      gourmet tickling him to death.”\r\n\r\n   38 “The Harvest of the Sea.”\r\n\r\n   39 _Vide_ “The Natural History and Fishery of the Sperm Whale.”\r\n\r\n   40 In “The World of the Sea.” M. Tandon is commenting on the account\r\n      published by M. Sabin Barthelot, then French Consul at the Canary\r\n      Islands.\r\n\r\n   41 This account of the crustaceans is derived from the works of Milne‐\r\n      Edwards, Pennant and Bell, Gosse, Couch, Broderip, Rymer Jones and\r\n      Major Lord, Figuier and Tandon.\r\n\r\n   42 Louis Cecil.\r\n\r\n   43 The contents of this chapter are derived from Dr. Bertram’s “Harvest\r\n      of the Sea,” Figuier’s “Ocean World,” Hartwig’s “Sea and its Living\r\n      Wonders,” Murphy’s “Rambles in North‐Western America,” &c.\r\n\r\n   44 The reader interested in further details will do well to peruse J.\r\n      Mortimer Murphy’s “Rambles in North‐Western America.”\r\n\r\n   45 A very stout man, placed where no food is obtainable, will (health\r\n      and age being identical) live longer than a lean one. There is a\r\n      recorded case of a fat man living nearly sixty days without food.\r\n\r\n   46 In his “Rambles beyond Railways.”\r\n\r\n   47 This watcher also receives a percentage on the “take” of fish.\r\n\r\n   48 The contents of this chapter are derived mainly from the works of\r\n      Owen, Beale, Maury, Scammon, Gosse, and Timbs.\r\n\r\n   49 Formerly, when spermaceti was only used in medicine, many tons of it\r\n      were annually thrown into the Thames as useless, the supply being so\r\n      much in excess of the demand.\r\n\r\n   50 From an article entitled “Shipmates I have Known,” in _The\r\n      Shipwrecked Mariner_: Journal of the Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society.\r\n\r\n   51 The bulk of this chapter is derived from Philip Henry Gosse’s\r\n      “Naturalist’s Rambles on the Devonshire Coast;” “Tenby: a Seaside\r\n      Holiday;” “A Year at the Shore;” the Rev. J. G. Wood’s “Common\r\n      Objects of the Sea‐shore;” and Madame de Gasparin’s charming idyl,\r\n      “By the Sea‐shore.”\r\n\r\n   52 “By the Sea‐shore.”\r\n\r\n   53 The reader may have found in his own experience that a garment which\r\n      has been well drenched in salt water will always attract damp,\r\n      however much dried by the fire. The only remedy is to thoroughly\r\n      wash it in fresh water, and then dry it.\r\n\r\n   54 This account is mainly derived from Wilkie Collins’s “Rambles beyond\r\n      Railways,” and the Rev. C. A. Johns’s “Week at the Lizard.”\r\n\r\n   55 “A Week at the Lizard.”\r\n\r\n   56 The writer acknowledges his indebtedness to a series of papers\r\n      entitled “Visits to the Sea Coasts,” published in the _Journal of\r\n      the Shipwrecked Mariners’ Society_. That noble institution relieved\r\n      in 1878‐9 no less than 3,452 shipwrecked persons, by clothing them,\r\n      and forwarding them to their homes, and in the case of fishermen,\r\n      helping them to repair damage done in gales, &c., to their boats and\r\n      fishing‐gear. Seven thousand four hundred and ninety widows of\r\n      mariners were relieved during that period, while 2,400 receive small\r\n      _annual_ allowances. A Seamen’s Provident Fund is also managed by\r\n      the Society, to which 50,000 mariners contributed. During the period\r\n      mentioned above ten gold and silver medals, a handsome sextant, and\r\n      £25 in money, were awarded for saving fifty‐one lives on the high\r\n      seas or abroad. The society also organised the “Royal Alfred Aged\r\n      Merchant Seamen’s Institution,” the home of which, at Belvedere,\r\n      Kent, shelters about 100 poor mariners, and relieves by an out‐\r\n      pension a still larger number. Readers of this work who have been\r\n      moved by the many tales of peril and heroism undergone and displayed\r\n      by seamen and fishermen, will do well to remember, and remember\r\n      practically, this worthy and most economically‐managed society.\r\n\r\n   57 _United Service Gazette._\r\n\r\n   58 _United Service Gazette._\r\n\r\n   59 This account of the loss of the _Grosser Kurfürst_ is condensed from\r\n      an article in the _United Service Gazette_.\r\n\r\n   60 R.

Senior in the _Shipwrecked Mariner_.\r\n\r\n   84 The most powerful fog‐horns introduced into this country are those\r\n      known as the Siren signals, which are illustrated in our plate. This\r\n      name is given to them on account of the sound being “produced by\r\n      means of a disc, with twelve radial slits, being made to rotate in\r\n      front of a fixed disc exactly similar. The moving disc revolves\r\n      2,800 times a minute, and in each revolution there are, of course,\r\n      twelve coincidences between the two discs; through the openings thus\r\n      made steam or air at high pressure is allowed to pass, so that there\r\n      are actually twelve times 2,800 (or 33,600) puffs of steam or\r\n      compressed air every minute. This causes a sound of very great\r\n      power, which the cast‐iron trumpet, twenty feet in length,\r\n      compresses to a certain extent, and the blast goes out as a sort of\r\n      sound‐beam in the direction required.” The Siren, which was\r\n      originally designed in New York, and was first adopted by the\r\n      American Lighthouse Board, can be heard in all kinds of weather at\r\n      from two‐and‐a‐half to three miles, and on favourable occasions at\r\n      as many as sixteen miles out at sea.\r\n\r\n   85 Francis Quarles.\r\n\r\n   86 “Virgil’s Sea Descriptions,” _Cornhill Magazine_, October, 1874.\r\n\r\n   87 Bermudas.\r\n\r\n   88 Let Shakespearian students note the allusions to piracy contained in\r\n      the following references:—_Twelfth Night_, Act V. scene 1; _Measure\r\n      for Measure_, I. 2, and IV. 3; _Merchant of Venice_, I. 3; Second\r\n      Part of _Henry VI._, IV. 1, 9; _Richard III._, I. 3; _Antony and\r\n      Cleopatra_, I. 4, II. 6; _Pericles_, IV. 2, 3–V. 1; _Hamlet_, IV. 6.\r\n\r\n   89 Pillaged.\r\n\r\n   90 Wanton.\r\n\r\n   91 The father, Charles Dibdin, and his two sons, one of the latter of\r\n      whom was the author of the popular “All’s Well.” Many popular sea‐\r\n      songs, written by others during the epoch of the Dibdins and later,\r\n      are, however, very commonly but erroneously placed to their credit.\r\n      Among those often ascribed to them are the following, really written\r\n      by the subjoined authors:—“The Death of Nelson” (S. J. Arnold), “The\r\n      Bay of Biscay” (Andrew Cherry), “Rule, Britannia” (J. Thompson),\r\n      “The Saucy Arethusa” (Prince Hoare), “The Storm” (“Cease, rude\r\n      Boreas”: G. A. Stevens), “The Sailor’s Consolation” (“One night came\r\n      on a hurricane”: W. Pitt), “Ye Mariners of England” (Thomas\r\n      Campbell), “Ye Gentlemen of England” (Martin Parker). The well‐known\r\n      song “William and Susan,” in the nautical drama “Black‐eyed Susan,”\r\n      is in like manner sometimes attributed to Douglas Jerrold, the real\r\n      author of the ever‐verdant play, but the ballad itself was written\r\n      by Thomas Gay.\r\n\r\n   92 The reader not familiar with the poetical works of this authoress is\r\n      recommended to peruse “’Tis a Wild Night at Sea” and “The Rover’s\r\n      Death.”\r\n\r\n   93 The _Cornhill Magazine_, March, 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe illustrations have been moved so that they do not break up paragraphs\r\nand are near the text they illustrate.\r\n\r\nAn illustration which was missing from the List of Illustrations has been\r\nadded to it.\r\n\r\nThe following changes have been made to the text:\r\n\r\n      page iii, dash added after “Soaped Rails”\r\n      page iv, dash added after “The First Idea of the Atlantic Cable” and\r\n      after “The Employment of the _Great Eastern_”\r\n      page vi, dash added after “Bold and Timid Lads” and after “The ‘True\r\n      Ring’”\r\n      page 11, quote mark added after “petulantly.”\r\n      page 38, double “the” removed before “captain”\r\n      page 66, quote mark added before “I saw”\r\n      page 74, quote mark removed after “breadth.”\r\n      page 90, “suphuretted” changed to “sulphuretted”\r\n      page 91, period added after “hour”\r\n      page 133, dash removed after “that” and added before it\r\n      page 134, second quote mark added before “That”, “The oysters” and\r\n      “True,”\r\n      page 153, comma removed after “lucky”\r\n      page 165, quote mark added after “stage.”\r\n      page 256, quote mark removed before “If”\r\n      page 299, quote mark removed before “Rover’s”\r\n      page 303, quote mark added before “new departure”\r\n      page 304, quote mark added after “sea.”\r\n      page 308, “vovage” changed to “voyage”\r\n      page 310, “Fiskernœs” changed to “Fiskernæs”\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the punctuation in the General Index has been regularized in\r\nseveral places.\r\n\r\nDifferences between the table of contents and the chapter summaries have\r\nnot been corrected.
